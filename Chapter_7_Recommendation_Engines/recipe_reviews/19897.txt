Okay, after reading about a hundred posts on this recipe, I've taken all the suggestions and put them together to make an excellent Peach Cobbler that was not runny at all. The filling was smooth and luscious! Here's  the list: 12-13 peaches  (about 4 lbs. I found that 3lbs wasn't enough), 1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c white sugar, 1/4c lemon juice, 1/4c orange juice, 3.5 T cornstarch, 2 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 crust recipe (use only 1 egg and 1/4 c water), and butter instead of shortening. After baking I put it under the broiler for a minute to brown it up a bit. Although the crust/topping was delicious, I might try a more traditional crumb topping next time with flour, oats, butter and brown sugar. I think the ideal combination would be using one recipe of the crust for the bottom, then putting the crumb topping on the top. Both are delicious, it's a matter of what your taste is. Please see my photo.

I thought this recipe was EXCELLENT.  I did make a few changes after reading several of the reviews.  I did double the crust recipe-it was a bit much-I could have done just fine with a batch and a half.  I used a 1/2 cup of shortening and the remaining amount was butter.  I used approxiamtely 4lbs of peaches-as far as I'm concerned, you can never use enough fruit in pies.  I used 1/4c lemon juice and 1/4 c orange juice.  I used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch, one teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkle of ginger.  I also used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar as I used fresh fruit that was sweet enough.  I also made the fancy lattice work on the top as suggested by French Blue-it came out gorgeous.  I topped mine with some whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top.  The crust was flakey and delicious and the filling was to die for.....take a look at my picture...and try this recipe!

This is absolutely great.  I've always been a double crust cobbler girl, but it's hard to find that.  I've never made a cobbler before although I consider myself an excellent cook and baker.  I was skeptical about the orange juice and fully intended to follow the crust recipe and combine it with another peach filling recipe.  I'm so glad I didn't.  This was absolutely great!!!  I kept raving about it.  My husband loved it too.  I will be making this again and again.  I did substitute the shortening for butter.  I don't stock shortening.  And I didn't use two sticks.  It was more like 1 1/2 sticks for the cobbler.  Baking the bottom crust first made this the perfect cobbler.  I'll be using this crust for all future cobblers.  I'm making blueberry next (after I make the peach again).  Thanks for a great cobbler.  I didn't do the lattice top either.  I just cut 1 1/2 inch long strips and placed over the top of the peaches.  I just couldn't see myself doing a lattice top.

Great dessert.  Instead of doing the lattice on top of the hot peaches, dust the bottom side of a cookie sheet and do it there.  Then you can just slide it on top of the fruit and finish it off.  This is a great trick with pies, too.

Wow...scrumptious!  This is really more like a giant peach pie than a traditional cobbler -- and that is more than fine with me since I prefer pie crust to spongy cobbler crust.  The crust here...oh my goodness...to die for!  I made 1-1/2 times the crust recipe, and it was just the right amount to split evenly between bottom and top layers.  I took a cue from another reviewer's (FrenchBlue) photo.  She placed the strips atop the pie in three alternating diagonal layers.  Looks so beautiful that way!  I don't think I would've had enough dough to do that with a single recipe.  I measured the peaches in the scale at the grocery store and bought 3.75 lbs.  Ended up being just the right amount.  It took 9 med-large peaches to reach that weight.  I used the full 1/4 c. lemon juice but reduced the OJ to 1/4 c. as well.  Hubby and I both thought the full amount, while it probably would have been good, might've overpowered the delicious peach flavor we were going for.  I just made up the difference in water.  Also added 2-1/2 TBS cornstarch.  Filling was juicy without being runny.  Thank you so much for this fabulous recipe...we loved it! :-)

I have tried about eight different recipes in the last few months in an effort to find a great cobbler. My father-in-law never comments on my cooking, but said after trying this one "You need to write this recipe down! This is really good."
Most are too sweet, but this one is just right and the crust is wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is great for just the crust alone.  I would suggest cutting the sugar in half, as it is awfully sweet.  Also, I would add one tablespoon of corn starch to make it thicker and maybe a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla.  It is wonderful and can even be "better" with a little tweaking.  You need to make sure you roll the dough really thin, as there is barely enough dough for the bottom of the pan as well as the lattice work.  Enjoy!!

I am not a baker and have never successfully made my own dough!  This recipe was excellent.  I served it to my husband and his eyes lit up!   He requested this, along with other recipes from this site, for father's day. I also used canned peaches (drained and washed) and also added some extra cinnamon, brown sugar and vanilla (to suit my family's tastes).  I also used a crumb topping (made with yellow cake mix and butter).  The first time I made it I did the lattice topping.  As with all the other reviews, I suggest making some extra dough.  Otherwise, this recipe was absolutely excellent.  Try it you won't regret it...

My family really loved this cobbler, even the picky ones.  I really liked the crust too.  Instead of doing a lattice top, I used a small cookie cutter (about 1 1/2 inch) and placed the cut crust all over on the top randomly.
After reading other reviews that said to reduce the amount of sugar added to the peaches, let me say that it's not too sweet if you put whipped cream on top.  If you eat it as is coming out of the oven, and you don't like things very sweet, you may want to cut down on the amount of sugar, but for me and my family, it's perfect just as is.

The crust was so flaky and tasted incredible.  The filling was so good too.  It was wonderful fresh out of the oven, with icecream on top.  It was also good cold without icecream.  The orange juice and the lemon juice were powerful next to the peach flavor, however, I really liked the uniqueness of the flavor.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I just used pumpkin pie spice.  It was amazing....will definitely make again.  Oh, and I used peaches that my mother-in-law had jarred last year.  Also, I didn't have cornstarch, so I used the same amount of flour...worked great.

Great base recipe!  I made this per the directions last week, and I found the juices overpowering, so I made a few changes.  I used 1 1/2 packages of store-bought crusts (3 round crusts) , two 29 oz. canned peaches drained, and a 16 oz. bag of frozen peaches.  No OJ, same lemon juice, 1 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, same cinnamon and nutmeg (freshly grated), 3 tbsp. cornstarch, and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I brushed an egg wash on top and sprinkled with a sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg mixture.  Fab-o!

Yes it takes quite a lot of time but it's worth it.  The best peach cobbler I have ever had.  Just a note: You can make the filling in August when the peaches are fresh just leave out the corn starch and freeze.  Take it out of the freezer a day ahead of time and let it defrost in the fridge. Then heat it up put in the corn starch and you have wonderful peach cobbler in the middle of January!  Enjoy!

5* for the crustalone.  Buttery, flaky, my search for the perfect pie crust is over.  For fresh peaches, most ppl are using 3.75 -4 lbs (9 lg or 13 sm-med peaches).  For canned it is (4)regular sized 15 oz cans or (2) 30 oz cans. Crust: 3c flour, cut sugar down to 2T, 1/2t - 1t salt depending on if you're using unsalted or salted butter, a bit less than 1/4c water.  Roll out on wax paper so it's easier to transport.     The filling: 1T lemon juice, 3T orange juice.  I decrease the amount of lemon juice so I could use less sugar.  Decrease the amount of OJ b/c I didn't want a wet filling. 1/2c butter, 1c sugar (1/2 brown 1/2 white), 1/4t nutmeg, 1/4t ginger, 1/2t cinn, 1 tsp vanilla.  the nutmeg, ginger, and vanilla extract are all optional. Finally 3T of cornstarch.   Prebaked bottem crust for 10-15m, then added filling and top crust.  Place a cookie sheet under pan to catch and drippings.  Baked at 375 for 30m, then brush on some egg white, and baked for another 10m until golden brown.

My family loves this recipe! We have made this many times. Only changes that I did was make double the dough, because when I made this the 1st time, the crust was REALLY thin, and hard to work with. After that I doubled the dough, and had plenty for the bottom crust, and I just roll out a flat top crust instead of the lattice crust, because my family love their cobblers with extra crust.... and vanilla ice cream too. Frozen peaches and even drained canned peaches will work with this when fresh peaches are not in season.

This is a wonderful peach cobbler!  Several of the reviews mentioned reducing the sugar to 1 cup.  I did so but was concerned about losing some of the thickening properties so I added 3 tbsp of cornstarch; 2 would have been fine.  I also added 1 tbsp of vanilla.  The cobbler wasn't finished before my family was asking me to make it again!

This peach cobbler was really good, with a few changes it could be awesome.  I didn't like the amount of orange juice in the recipe, I can really taste the orange juice and it takes a lot away from the flavor of the peaches.  Next time, I'll cut it down to 1/4 C or eliminate it all together.  Even though I added 3 T of cornstarch instead of 1, it could have used at least a tablespoon more.    That having been said, I made the crust with butter instead of shortening (the only change I made in the recipe) as others suggested and it was awesome!  I'll definitely try it with other fruit.  Can't wait to try again with a couple of changes.  Although others say it's more of a pie, this was the way I've always eaten cobbler, maybe it's a Missouri thing?  Anyway, great recipe.

I picked this recipe because it had a five star rating.  My husband is a big peach cobbler fan, and I wanted to really *wow* him.  I was not happy with the way this turned out.  It was too runny/watery/liquid, the crust reminds me more of a pie, and it was too sweet for my taste.

One good fix for the dough problem that other reviewers have mentioned is to make this in a 10" springform pan - you lose the use of your pan for a while, since you'll have to serve out of it, but there's no shortage of dough (and since 9x13 pans and springforms both hold the same volume, cooking times/temps are about the same.  As others have also mentioned, I'd lose the lattice-top -- too much like a pie, and maybe experiment with a different crust recipe altogether.

Eleta.......... WOW..... WOW... WOW!!!!!!!!!!! Made me a MOVIE STAR! I was the hit of our large extended family dinner this week and I will make this again and again. I have made Peach cobbler literally dozens of times using many other recipes but never found what I feel is the "REAL" deal. Well if you are from the south and are used to the real country style, down home, GREAT peach cobble - HERE is the recipe. Stop looking! I have attended many competitions for pies, desserts and pastries and this is certainly competitive quality. I am really appreciative that you have published this. My thanks and blessings to you and your family!

I have never felt obliged to write in about a recipes until now. This recipe was absolutely amazing. No other word for it. I made a few changes; reduced orange juice to 1/2 cup (my peaches were very juicy)and under the advice of previous reviewers I added 1 1/2c. white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.I make pies often and have to tell you folks PLEASE try this one. You will not be disappointed!
Oh yes, I also had to increase the cornstarch to 4 Tbsp. That's how juicy the fresh peaches were.
Enjoy!

In my cobbler there are 2 layers of crust and 2 layers of peaches. I make this no other way. So delicious!

I think this would have been better if I would have used fresh peaches instead of frozen ones. Overall, it was too runny and the lemon and orange juice flavor overpowered the peach flavor. I had to have icecream with it to dull the citris taste. The crust was really good. I would advise using less lemon and NOT frozen peaches.

After reading the views, I made some changes that were suggested:
4 lbs fresh peaches
1/2 cup Lemon Juice
1/2 cup Orange Juice
1/2 cup Brown Sugar
1/2 cup regular sugar
3 1/2 tbs corn starch

I'm glad I did since the sweetness was perfect. I'm glad I didn't use the whole 2 cups. I could have used even more peaches since the dish I was using was pretty deep. I added cinnamon to the butter/sugar mix for the top crust. I just mixed it together and brushed it on. Yum! I also just use the ready to use roll out pie crust. I made for pot luck luncheon at work and it was a hit! This is a keeper!

I have made this twice. The first time it was perfect. I made it for a work food day and people were going crazy. The second time, I think I cooked the peach mixture too long and on too high of heat. Both times I made this I took the advice of previous reviewers: Used 58 ounces of canned peaches in light syrup - drained, doubled the nutmeg, reduced the OJ to 1/4 cup and added 1 teas vanilla. It also took alot more cornstarch to thicken the peach mixture - just don't overcook it! I also used my own pie crust recipe, doubled, and covered the whole cobbler with an entire crust, with slits cut in the top.

I'd actually give it 4.5 stars, but definitely bordering on 5.  I found this a little too sweet, especially with sweet fresh peaches, so next time I'll only use 1 1/2 cups sugar with the peaches.  Definitely delicious, though, and I love the fruit juices with it.  A few other suggestions:  Butter the pan before putting the crust in because I had trouble scraping some of the crust out.  So tender and flaky though!  Also, an easy way to peel peaches for all you struggling is put them in boiling water for 30 second or so, then plunge them into ice water.  The skins will easily flake off afterwards.  Lastly, this is definitely a juicy peach cobbler, so don't try baking it and then brining it somewhere by car, like I did!  I don't think it'd be quite as good if it werne't so juicy, though, so I wouldn't change anything about that.  I loved this peach cobbler and will be making it again.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This recipe is awesome!  The first time I had REAL peach cobbler like my grandmother used to make in years.  I took it to work and everyone was raving about it.  It takes more time, but is well worth it!

I used frozen peaches and the recipe tasted great. I'm a novice baker and my crust did not look pretty at all. If you're new to pie crusts here is some quick advice: use ALL cold ingredients for the crust, add the fat (shortening) in pieces, and don't overwork the dough... I will definately make again.

Absolutely delicious.  The cinnamon, nutmeg, and orange/lemon juices DO give this cobbler a flavor unlike any other cobbler I've had, but it is a GOOD variation...  It's quite unique.

The crust is soooo yummy, and I had plenty for the recipe.  I had to add extra flour when I was kneading in the water and egg, because it was a sticky mess...   Also, I didn't bother with making a "lattice" form with the top crust...  I just cut it into wide strips and flopped them haphazardly onto the top of the cobbler for a more rustic look.  (This was much easier than making the lattice, and it tasted just as good, of course.)

This recipe would also be *excellent* with apples.

Pretty good recipe.  You have to stretch the dough in order to have enough, and should definitely cut down on the sugar, and double the cornstarch!!!  Delicious.

This was WAY too watery - the peaches were swimming in liquid and the bottom crust was completely waterlogged.  Even refrigerating didn't help it to set.  It either needs more cornstarch or less citrus juice, because the fresh peaches created a lot of liquid on their own.  The taste itself was good (crust was so-so).  My peaches were a little on the tart side, so the end result wasn't too sweet at all.

I consider myself a fairly experienced cook and I found this recipe EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.  The cobbler looks nice but is sickeningly sweet and I probably will end up throwing most of it in the garbage.  I think that the flavor of the orange juice detracts from the mild sweetness of the peaches.  Undoubtedly too there is way too much sugar in this recipe.

The combination of fruit,juice and spices is
a perfect blend for intense fruit flavor.
The rich crust is perfect to hold the 
exquisite blend of filling.  Warm or cold
absolutely delicious.
I did add an extra tablespoon of corn 
starch to the sugar and spice mixture as
I suspected it may be a little runny.  It
was perfect for my taste and still the filling
juices ran just slightly when cut. I felt 
it was a lot of sugar for just one tablespoon.
A real winner.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I was scared to make the crust but it was super simple. I did however use canned peaches I just drained some of the juice, but otherwise I followed it exactly!!!! My family all wanted seconds.....and I served it with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream! This definitely is a KEEPER!

The crust to the recipe is amazing. However, I am not good at peeling peaches. Therefore, in a bowl I combined 3 pounds of canned peaches, 2 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and folded in 4 tablespoon of butter cut into small pieces and poured the mixture of crust and continued recipe from step 4. My family loved it and the crust was the best I have had in along time. GOOD EATING!!!!

This is peach cobbler like my grandmother used to make and she was known for her cobbler. It was delicious. I would recommend cutting the lattice strips while the bottom crust is baking and putting them in the freezer. It makes them easier to lattice as they don't get so soft. I don't care if it's a cobbler or a pie, it is just what I was looking for. Thank you, Eleta, for sharing.

This is very good. I used 2 tblsp of cornstarch and left the rest of the recipe as is. It was very watery until it cooled completely, then it was fine. I would suggest using a slightly bigger recipe for the crust though. Very tasty though!

This recipe was awesome.  I had been trying to find a great peach cobbler recipe to make for July 4.  This one is definitely a keeper with some tweaking. I used the other reviewers suggestons and did 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown sugar, 3 tbl of cornstarch, 1/4 lemon juice, 1/4 orange juice, and added some vanilla.  I tried the crust using lard but didn't like the porky after taste.  Then I made a crust with Crisco, but mine was too doughy.  I was glad I tasted the crust before putting my peaches in the dish.  I ended up using Pillsbury's ready made pie crusts in the roll.  All I had to do was roll the crust in my dish and over my cobbler.  I used four rolls, since I like a lot of bread and fresh peaches.  Everyone raved about it.  My grandma said it tasted like hers, so that was a great compliment!

This is so delicious!  I have never made cobbler like this before, but this is the only way I will make it from now on.  I followed a few suggestions of other reviewers and have a few ideas for next time.  I used only 1/4 cup orange juice, cut the sugar down to 1 c. and used 3 T. cornstarch, and only used 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I ended up with a very velvety filling with excellent peach flavor!  Next time I will chill the dough again after placing it in the pan (it shrunk a bit too much) and I will attempt to do a real lattice top.(I cheated this time and used a small cookie cutter on my rolled out top crust). Yummmy!

Takes extra effort to make, but it's well worth it. Pastry was flaky and tender (I used butter-flavored Crisco), and I agree with the previous reviewer--don't leave out the OJ and lemon! It adds a hint of bright citrus flavor that wonderfully complements the spicy nutmeg & cinnamon. In a word, delicious!

Wonderful!!  By mistake, I bought a case of sliced peaches (thought they were the individual cups for my kids lunches), so was searching for a recipe to use them up.Even with canned peaches, this was great. I drained the juice from the peaches, melted the butter and just mixed the remainder of the ingredients (did not heat any on the stove since they were canned peaches- didn't think that was needed).  I did increase the cornstarch to 2 tbl. , but don't think I needed to. I did make the crust 1 1/2 times because I like a lot of crust.  Again, it was great, but don't think I needed to do that either.  I was a little worried at first because my bottom crust sank down when baking, and was maybe too thick then.  But after adding the peach filling and baking with top crust, it was great.  My crust dough was a little sticky- I was rushing and not paying attention and added too much egg/water. But after chilling and rolling out with generous amount of flour, it was great.  My family loved this.  Will make again.

I lost my own recipe when we moved and needed to make a peach cobbler for a get-together.  I decided to try this one because it sounded closest to my own. While baking, this cobbler filled the house with an irresistable aroma. The crust is flaky and slightly sweet while the filling is sweet, a little tart and buttery at the same time.  Definitely try this.

I used frozen peaches from Albertson's, and used 1.5 times flour as a thickener instead of cornstarch. I also doubled the crust recipe and didn't even attempt to do a lattice :)  This recipe filled a 13X9X2 lasagna pan perfectly!

This is one of the best peach cobblers I've had in a long time.   I did a few different things such as omitted the orange juice, and I used canned peaches, and used the juice from the canned peaches in place of the orange juice.  I also did as others suggested by cutting the sugar in half, and I also used an extra tablespoon of cornstarch.  My husband and children loved it.  Excellent recipe.

Fresh peach cobbler always taste so wonderful!  I like to omit the nutmeg and add 1/2 teaspoon almond flavoring.  Collegate dictionary defines cobbler as: "A deep-dish fruit dessert with a thick top crust", but, it does not mention "something put together, hastily".  However, it really doesn't matter, does it?  Isn't taste what we cooks are striving for, not semantics!

DELICIOUS! Extremely easy and quick to make. I used a 16 oz. bag of frozen peaches and thought it wasn't going to be enough, but it was. I used butter flavored crisco shortening. I also used an extra tablespoon of cornstarch because I thought it looked too liquidy when putting it in the pan over the bottom crust layer, but after it baked and cooled, it wasn't liquidy at all. Some people here said they made double the dough but I thought just one batch was perfect. And dont take out the orange juice!!! it was wonderful and not orangey. Nutmeg made all the difference. AMAZING dessert. especially with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream. tastes great the next day too! next time i want to add raspberries!

After throughly researching peach cobbler recipes, this one was the winner!  I read each of the reviews and decided to try it on my own.  I did add a teaspoon more of the cornstarch in the peach batter to make sure it wasn't too runny.  It worked out perfectly!  It was my first time making a dessert from scratch and I entered it in a contest and won.  I've already gotten requests from family members to make them their own batches.

I only used this recipe for the crust. It was OK, but I was hoping for a flaky crust which this is not.

I wish I'd read the reviews first because this is truly a terrific recipe but I would've tweaked it a little, and I would've used a solid top instead of latticed one - too difficult for a novice like me.  Otherwise - delicious!

This was my 2nd attempt to make a peach cobbler.  1st attempt with this recipe .  We were having the 1st annual family peach cobbler cook off in honor of my grandmother who is deceased. She made the best.  She passed away 20 years ago, but I pictured it in my head.  I had no clue what she did but  found THIS recipe that looked similar.  The difference I remember was that my grandma used a deep dish glass oven bowl, (not a 9x13 dish). 4-5 lbs of boiling hot peaches. ( not sure what she put in it). 

I copied this recipe to a "T" except I made a double batch of crust. Why you ask.  The crust is the best part.  Plus I layered my cobbler like my grandma did.  Crust in the bottom.  1/2 the peaches.  Another layer of crust, peaches and top it off with another layer of basket weaved crust.  ( ok I couldn't do the basket weave). 

Some tips my mother told me .  Use ice cold water when mixing.  Make sure your crust runs up the entire side of the bowl.  I greased sides with butter, which caused my crust to slide down the bowl during the baking of the first crust.  I had to work it and push it back up. Because of so much butter I was not sure if the bottom cooked so I microwaved it. (Don't tell grandma she'll roll over in her grave).   It worked anyway.  I added the first round of peaches, 1/2 of my 2nd batch of crust. (Thank God my wife said you better make 2). Microwaved again. (She's rolling over now) peaches, top layer of crust.  Sprinkled with more cinnamon and butter.  OMG!  Clay

Very easy. Love that the crust is homemade, unlike other recipes that use canned biscuits and such...

Turned out great!! Used canned peaches (3 large cans) instead of fresh.  Followed others suggestions and used 3.5 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1/2 cup of OJ and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.

This Recipe was great. The only changes I would make is to cut back on the orange juice and increase the cornstarch. The cobbler was very juicy, the fresh peaches were swimming in it. I love the recipe however because it reminds me of the way my grandma used to make cobbler.

This tastes just like my grandmother's peach cobbler that I never was able to get the recipe for before she passed. It is really amazing with fresh picked peaches from the orchard. Yum!

AWESOME!!!!!  I followed this recipe except I doubled the dough recipe (I love lots of crust).  I also didn't have a lemon, so I just omitted the lemon juice.  It came out sooooo goooood!!!!!  I used nectarines, purple plums, green plums, and apricots (my dad is a tree fruit farmer so it was what was laying around at the time).  I will DEFINATELY use this recipe again and again!!!

As written I think it would be too soupy, so I give it 4 stars.  With less liquid (I used 1/4 c. of both lemon & orange juice) & 3T. cornstarch = 5 stars!  The cobbler was perfect this way.   I doubled the recipe for the crust and had a lot left over.  The crust turned out flaky & very tasty.  I sprinkled the sugar on top and then sprayed with PAM instead of trying to sprinkle melted butter over it. Delicious!

If you are looking for a quick recipe this is NOT the one. However, it is delicious and very much like my grandmother's. No wonder grandma was in the kitchen so much. I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 butter in the crust. I used my food processor to sift and blend with the shortening then to add the egg and water. I used my plastic dough blade but a regular metal blade should work fine too. I let the processor run as I poured the egg/water mixture in. I did not use all of the liquid as the dough seemed a little sticky. I turned it out onto plastic wrap and chilled as called for. I used more than 1/2 the dough for the bottom crust. The top crust I rolled out, not too thin onto plastic wrap, and used a round biscuit cutter to place rounds over the top of the peaches. Then I filled in the larger spaces with partial rounds of dough. I liked the rustic look. I sprinkled sugar over the top as the recipe stated but sprayed that with cooking spray instead of melted butter. (I couldn't stand to dirty one more dish.)I used 1/2 cup orange juice and 2 tablespoon of cornstarch. I poured the peaches right into the baked crust just as it came out of the oven so there would be no time for it to get soggy.

Admitedly, the overall appearance was lovely, with an artful arranging of the nothing-special pie crust on top. But HOLEY SCHMOLEY! All that sugar in an already fruit-sweetened filling??!! What's the point? To completely overwhelm any taste whatsoever of the fruit? Ick! 

The second time I gave this a try, I cut the sugar in the filling down to 1/2 cup, used 2 hefty Tblsp. flour per 3 lbs. juicy peaches instead of cornstarch for thickening, and dotted the filling with a little butter once it made it into the dish. I rolled out the crust dough, spread it with a little brown sugar, cinnamon, and chopped crystallized ginger, and rolled it up like a jelly roll. After a chilling, I cut it into slices and placed them on top in a "cobbled" pattern. Only with these modifications did my family find this recipe not only edible, but enjoyable.

I have tried for four years to find a peach cobbler recipe that my husband could be proud of, without mentioning his mother's cobbler.  I finally found one, this recipe is great!  Even though I used shortcuts, like buying pre-made pie crust, and frozen peaches instead of fresh the recipe made it seem that I slaved all day. Totally great recipe!  Thank you!

I did not care for this at all.  It had way too much spice in it.  It overpowered the peaches.  I also added more cornstarch and it was still too watery.  It was so watery that my crust got soggy.  I won't be making this again.

OH MY GOODNESS!  This recipe was the biggest hit of the Texas Peach round up this year.  It was runny until entirely cooled and then was perfect.  I LOVED the crust.  Actually, I had to hand it out to so many people so I wouldn't eat the entire pan.  Two Thumbs WAY up!

This cobbler was a hit.  I followed other reviewers advice and made 1 1/2 of the crust.  I made the filling the day before.  When I went to assemble the cobbler, I felt there was too much liquid.  I strained and left just a small amount of liquid.  I proceeded with the recipe, my only adjustment being to add about 1 cup of raspberries. What was great was that the crust did not turn soggy, even after being in the fridge for 3 days.  I boiled down the remaining liquid until reduced by about half.  It made a WONDERFUL pancake syrup!  2 for the efforts of 1!  Will

Yes, Indeed!!! Yummy!!! OMG... this was just the best Peach Cobbler "EVER"... I was looking for a recipe like "Grandmaw's"... Goodness, I'm so proud of myself (and thankful for this recipe) 'cause I definitely have Granny beat with this one... the only thing I did differently was added 4 TBSP of Instant Tapioca, instead of cornstarch... It was the perfect consistency! Thank ya, Thank ya, THANK YA! (In my Gomer Pile voice)

At last!  A REAL recipe for peach cobbler!!  This is the one I've been trying to find for years because it's so like the one my grandmother made.  If you've never tried an honest to goodness peach cobbler, this one is worth your time and effort.  Those "stir and pour" cobblers are only good when they are fresh and hot but no comparison to the genuine article.

I was asked to do cobbler for a united way function. I was nervous because I had never made one. They needed 10! I saw this recipe and did exactly as written except used store bought pastry. It was SO GOOD!..I have never tasted one this good and the cook at the function told me everyone loved the cobbler and not to change one thing...since I had 13 more to make over the next week for 3 different functions! Thank you so much for a wonderful cobbler!..It was perfect in spices and the lemon and Orange juice were perfect in the mixture ...please try this recipe!.. you will be hooked! I am so glad there are those that love and enjoy sharing their recipes with others..!
Be sure and eat it warm and with vanilla ice cream!  OH SO GOOD!

Super good...super easy. I only made a few changes.  First I used butter instead of shortening.  I also used canned peaches but I did not use the juice. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 and 1/2 cups of sugar.  I also increased the cornstarch to get the consistency I wanted.  I doubled the crust because the crust is my favorite.   It was a HUGE hit!!

Excellent cobbler. I used the suggestions of other reviewers and reduced the orange and lemon juice to 1/4 cups. I added about a tsp of vanilla to the crust. I also used frozen peaches. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

This was really delicious, but I had a few minor changes that I think would put it over the top :) When I cooked this, my crust burned on the bottom, so I decided for the next time to just put pieces of crust inside with the peaches and cover the top with crust - instead of putting it on the bottom.  I used 4 lbs of peaches, but next time I might step it up a little and even try 5 lbs to make more filling!  Another change I made was instead of 2 cups of white sugar in the peaches,  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  The citrus was a little overwhelming, so next time I'm just going to cut the orange from 3/4 cup down to 1/2 cup (very minor difference).  I know it seems like a lot of changes, but really the foundation of the recipe is delicious - definitely worth the time and effort it takes to make it! :)

The filling for this recipe is wonderful.   I have never used the crust portion because my husband loves Pillsbury ready made box crustand says "why bother".  Everytime we are invited to a cookout, this cobbler is what they want me to bring.  Definitely a favorite of friends and family.  I still plan on trying the crust at some point but for now this filling and the box crust is the ticket.

Excellent! This was my first time making a cobbler, and it turned out great, all things considered. I didn't have enough peaches (I was just trying to get rid of the ones I had in the freezer), nor did I have a 9x13 pan. I got creative with some packets of instant oatmeal for the top layer of dough. This stuff is amazing! I definitely will be making more cobblers in the future.

I made a double-batch of this cobbler to bring as a dessert for a charity benefit BBQ, it was a HIT to say the least.  Everyone gave me rave reviews on it and had tons of people ask for the recipe.  I thought it turned out a bit soupy but I never heard one complaint about it!

First of all, I used frozen peaches instead of fresh (since they arent in season), I didn't have any lemon juice so I used all orange juice instead. I also didnt have any corn starch so I substituted it with 1.5 parts flour.  I also added a little extra cinnamon.  I would strongly suggest increasing the crust recipe by 50%, I rolled my crust extremely thin and barely had enough to cover the pan.  

Next time I will decrease the orange juice by about 25% and see how it turns out.

Really excellent cobbler. The crust makes it the exact type of dessert I think of when "cobbler" comes to mind. I've used it with other fillings I found on recipes.com (I just use this instead of whatever the other recipe calls for as crust). If you make it exactly like it says here, it is definitely very soupy. To adjust for this but keep taste same, I made it as directed, then scooped peaches into dish with slotted spoon and then poured in the amount of liquid that suited my preference. This way, everyone can make it as juicy or thick as they'd like but the taste stays true to the original, highly-rated-so- why-change-much  recipe. Worth the effort!

The Cobbler was a big hit; however when I got to making it I realized the recipe didnt make enough dough and i had to scramble to make more and get it in the oven.

This recipe was fabulous!  Wonderful peach flavor and delicious crust.   A little time-consuming but worth every minute.  Hubby asked when I was going to make another before the first one was halfway finished.  The only adjustments I made was decreasing the sugar in the filling to roughly 1 cup (I had sweet peaches to start) and increasing the cornstart to 2 tablespoons.  I doubled the crust recipe and made a full crust on top rather than the lattice to save on time.  I'm off to make another before hubby gets home from work :).

this was AMAZING!!!my hubby who hates peaches even enjoyed it! he did suggest that if you dont like the tang of fresh peaches canned should be used. we paired it with homemade vanilla ice cream. very tasty. i didnt use all of the "juice" from the cooked peaches however and it was plenty moist...i think it would have been to watery if i had used it all.

Absolutely delicious! I began slicing peaches without weighing them first and wasn't sure just how many cups was equal to 3lbs. So I went with 6 cups of peaches and that seemed perfect. I did not read the reviews first, so didn't know to reduce sugar. I will cut back some next time. Believe it or not, we did have some leftovers the next day and I ate it cold right out of the fridge and it was still very good. I also thought the crust is what made this cobbler a standout. I will definitely make this again!

I liked the flavors. But the crust wasnt' a 
"Typical" cobbler crust. It was too flaky. The crust was very very good! I just wouldnt't call it a Cobbler crust. I think I will try to make the filling in a pie form next time. I liked it a lot! Thank you

I have used canned sliced peaches when fresh peaches are not in season...rinse them well under cold water and strain.  They are just as good as fresh and my family loves it!!!

Our peach trees produced 2+ bushels this year.  I have made this cobbler 3  times this summer, only change I made was to make a double crust. This is the BEST peach cobbler ever.  Thanks for sharing!

Thanks so much for this tasty recipe.  I love that the crust came out flaky and buttery instead of soggy.   Also I was pleased with the lattice top using the wax paper tip- suggested by one of the reviews.   I will definitely make again, however less on the citrus.

Good base but needs changes. I made this today and followed the recipe to the T. I read the suggestions but figured I'd give it a go the way it was written. I wish I would have listened to the other reviews. First off DOUBLE THE CRUST! The amount of crust called for in the recipe is just not enough. I am going to make this again and next time split the white sugar with brown sugar as well as sprinkling brown sugar over top of the lattice work, this should make a huge difference. Depending on the temp of your kitchen you may want to chill the dough a little longer, I had been cooking for a while and before I could finish working with the dough it had already started becoming "sticky" and hard to work with due to the temp. This recipe also needs more peaches. I put in the 3lbs it called for but wish I would have added more like others said. This time it turned out a little on the runny side so next time I will do closer to 4 lbs. Lastly I think this would be better cooked in a 8x11 pan vs 9x13. The 9x13 just seems too big for the amount (even if you added an extra lb of peaches) of cobbler. I'll use my 8x11 next time.

I was looking for a good cobbler recipe and I found this one! Boy, am I glad I did. It combined my favorite crust with an absolutely delicious filling. Everything was perfect. The only adjustment I made was to bring the bottom crust up a little higher than halfway up so that the juices stay in.

This was very disappointing.  The dough was very greasy and nearly impossible to work with...and it's flavor and texture was unimpressive.  The lemon and orange juice overpowered the flavor of peaches.  Too much sugar and butter.  It was a lot of work and the result was very bland.

The end result for the peach filling was very good! The crust was just ok. I think next time I would use a brown sugar or a crumb topping. The bottom crust STUCK to the pan. Even though the crust was loaded with shortening, I think a little greasing of the pan would have helped alot. I had to chizzel away at the bottom crust to get this served.

The best! Looked long time for cobbler that didn't have the cornbread like crust.  This was fantastic and I have made it 4 times now, the family and workers love it. The only change I made was 1 and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I've made cobblers for years, but I keep looking for the perfect cobbler recipe. I think this may be it. It took a little longer than some, but the result was worth it. The taste was sublime, the texture just right. I followed the recipe exactly. My only problem was that I didn't have enough crust to make a full lattice top, so I just laid a few strips over the cobbler. Maybe I just didn't roll it out thin enough.
All in all, though, the best cobbler recipe I've found!

I haven't made this recipe yet, but I already KNOW it's gonna be good.  This is the way my mama's peach cobbler looked.  Will make it soon and post another review.  Thank you for posting it! :)

I also used 1.5 crust recipes.  Next time, I will only add 1/2c orange juice.  I also added 3.5T cornstarch, 2t vanilla, and 3/4c heavy cream.

I have been making this peach cobbler recipe for over 3 yrs. I'm a huge baker and have tried many. This is the best one I've found. Its awesome. If its just for my immediate family I used canned peaches and juice its in instead of lemon and orange juice. If I used fresh peaches I use orange and pineapple juice. In my house its gone within 3 days so I don't store it in the fridge, just place foil on top and leave it on the counter because I don't like cold peach cobbler :-) The sugar acts as a preservative.

I have almost entirely quite using this site.  I am so sick of these "better than thou" cooks who take a recipe, then change it beyond recognition.  This recipt is fine, the orange juice changes to peach flavor rather than the reverse, the pie crust is fine--use a pastry marble pin and board-- or make slightly more.  But if you are experienced with pie crust, as I said, the recipt is fine.  The one and only change that may be necessary is to add more cornstarch.   Flavoring changes are always optional, and dependant on ones tastes.

We all loved this cobbler! I made extra crust and covered the top, used 3 ½ lbs. of canned peaches along w/ the syrup,  added more corn starch to thicken, ¾ cup sugar, ½ cup of brown sugar, omitted the orange juice, and added 1/4 cup of cinnamon liquor. Used a 9x13 cake pan and cooked for about 40 minutes.

This recipe was great! Mine turned out more like a pie though. I used the remaining ingredients to create "Peach Cobbler Toddlers" As I call them. I used a cupcake pan and lined each cupcake hole with the crust. Then I added the remaining filling to each one and covered them with another layer of crust. They were perfect for the quick snack! My family absolutely loved them!

This is a keeper! Just made it tonight. Last week I tried a recipe from this site but the crust was cakey. This one is excellent.  Crust recipe is yummy, slightly sticky but just add a little flour when you notice it's too sticky as you roll it. I took reviewers advice of: Increase crust amount. I made 1.5 X, cut sugar by half (I don't like extra sweet dessert), cut orange juice by half, increase cornstarch to 3 TBSP (instead of 1 TBSP), Brush eggwash on top layer dough to make it look nicer. 4 stars as is, 5 stars after modifications. Will make again for sure.

Very delicious! Just made it and ate some with a little vanilla ice cream. The best peach cobbler I've ever had. The only change I made was used a half a cup of brown sugar in place of a half cup of the regular white sugar.

This is the cobbler recipe that I have been searching for for 30 years.  It turns out just like the ones that the older Southern ladies used to bring to church potluck dinners when I was a girl.  Don't deviate from the recipe...you won't be disappointed.  This is a recipe that you will hand down to your children.

I followed this recipe exactly except for adding 3T of cornstartch.  I did not care for this recipe.  It would have been much better without the overpowering taste of orange juice.  The cinnamon was a bit much too and took away the peachy flavor.  It tasted more like "citrus cobbler".  I do have to say that the crust was great.  If you want a real peachy tasting cobbler perhaps leaving out the OJ and cutting back on the cinnamon would do the trick.  Also, even after 3T of cornstartch it was still quite watery!

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe as it was written except for using butter instead of shortening.  The crust was superb and I got so many compliments on this dessert.  I think the only thing I would change is adding a bit more cornstarch to the mix so it wouldn't be as runny.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've attempted peach cobbler probably 5 times in my life and finally at the age of 41 I'VE FOUND CLOSURE.  This is by far an excellent recipe and the crust was perfect.  Using that Mexican vanilla w/lemon and orange juice makes the filling AWESOME.  I almost passed out after tasting my creation and my family loves it just as much.

My grandmother, a former pastry chef, raved about this pie when I served it to her. I did change a few things: like some other reviewers, I found it a bit runny so after cooking the peaches, I took out approx 1/2 cup of the liquid; I also added a 1/4 tsp of ginger. Next time, for the filling, I think I will reduce the amount of sugar to 1 1/2 cups, the butter to 1/4 cup, and the orange juice to 1/2 cup and increase the cornstarch to 2 tbsp -- just personal preference. The pastry, though, was terrific just the way it way. This was the first time I had EVER made pie crust you could actually eat! Thanks for a winner of a pie!

Delicious!  I accidentally used twice the suger I was supposed to but everyone ranted and raved about how much they loved it.  Made it for a going-away party and it was a hit.  I halved the lemon and orange juice and tripled the corn starch as others suggested.  I'll definately make this again.

I brought this to a picnic and everyone loved it.  The crust was great.  I used canned peaches (packed in pear juice).  Everything else I followed exactly.  I would definitely make this again.

This recipe was really great.  An excellent summer dessert.
I did make a few changes that really helped, especially if you are using overripe or very juicy fruit.
Unless you like your desserts really sweet, I would reduce the sugar (per other reviews) to 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup light brown.
I also reduced the liquid (because there was less sugar and my peaches were very juicy) to 1/4 cup lemon, 1/4 cup orange, and 1/4 cup water (per other reviews that the orange flavor was overwhelming).
I also increased the measurements to 2 tbs cornstarch and 1 tbs flour to aid in thickening.
Finally, because I used egg white to seal the bottom crust (to prevent it from getting soggy), I used the left over egg yolk in the peach mixture to act as an additional thickening agent.
The result was a lovely cobbler with a filling that was perfectly gooey, not too watery and not to gelatin like.  Really excellent with ice cream.
Oh, and I also threw in some rasperries for color and a little extra tartness.
Thanks for the recipe!

I made it exactly how the recipe said to make it except that I left it in the oven after the required baking time was up, so that when we were ready for desert it was still warm. A scoop of vanilla bean ice cream went very well with it. I was a little nervous about making the crust because I have never made one before. To my surprise it was actually very easy and delicious! My husband said he loved how it just melted in his mouth. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my mom's friends and they loved it! I had to increase the baking time to get the crust to become golden brown and the filling was somewhat runny but we just drizzled the runny sauce over the vanilla icecream so it was still good!

For the pastry I used butter instead of shortning. For the filling, I added extra cornstartch and 1 cup of cream. Yum!! We loved it :)

It's good but not perfect. It's a little too sweet. I didn't add orange juice and I left over a LOT of liquid coz I realized that if I added it all, it would be too runny. Don't see any difference from a peach pie though.

I adapted this for a pie so I needed it a little thicker-just used 1/2 cup OJ and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  Everything else the same.  It was wonderful.  The best peach pie filling ever.  Thank you.  I'm sure it's great as cobbler too, but I needed a pie this time.

Very Yummy!!  The hubby loved it (and so did I).  I used only a dash of nutmeg, 1/2 cup of the orange juice, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and 2 Tbls cornstarch.  It still came out soupy.  Next time I will use only 1/4 cup OJ and add another 1-2 Tbls cornstarch to help thicken it up more.  I did grease my pan because some had trouble with the crust sticking and it came out perfect.  This is a definate keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

GREAT!! Best peach cobbler I ever had! However, I DID make some changes...(very forgiving recipe)
-doubled crust recipe and layered the cobbler
-I was able to make a full crust on top..yummy.
-slice vents in full crust to avoid overbubbling
-if peaches are ripe, 1/2 sugar.
-double the cornstarch
-i didn't have lemon juice so I added a full cup of oj
-didn't have a pastry blender so i did that by hand
-didn't have a rolling pin so guesstimated by hand
-forgot to bake just the crust for 20 min
-so i lengthened the entire baking time to 1 hr.

despite all my changes (some accidental) it was delicious!!

Now *this* is a true southern-style cobbler!  I doubled the crust and used butter-flavored shortening, but I didn't bother with the lattice top (just draped the pastry dough over the top and cut slits to vent).  I admit, it was a lot of work to peel and slice the peaches, but in the end it was totally worth it.  Topped with vanilla ice cream, what a fantastic way to end a barbecue.

Well worth the effort.  I will use this recipe for "filling" for pies as well.  Excellent flavor.  And the next time I make it as a cobbler, I will double the crust recipe because the flavor in this crust was amazing!  Sweeter than a pie crust but not "cakey" like some cobbler recipes.  Served this with company over and I was disappointed that there were no leftovers!!

I have made this recipe according to its instructions and it is wonderful.  For the sake of time and my own personal tastes I have made these adjustments: I use a total of 58oz of can peaches in light syrup--drained.  I found absolutely no difference in taste or texture.  It saves soooo much time.  I also skip the crust-like recipe given.  I make the fruit filling as instructed and I top with 3 C flour,3T sugar, 1T+ 1 1/2t baking powder, 1 1/2t salt, 1/2C+ 1T shortening, 1 1/2C milk.  Mix dry ingred., cut in shortening and then add milk.  Drop on filling and bake as instructed.  Enjoy!

I have tried many peach cobbler recipes before and this is by far the best.  I did make a couple of changes however.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening for the crust and found it tastier.  I also used a combination of brown and white sugar in the peaches just because I love brown sugar.

This is the recipe I've been looking for for years!  Simply wonderful!!  Just like I've been able to get at the local soul food restaurants here....but now I can do it myself.  The crust will get thick if not rolled thin enough, but it still taste great!

THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE.  MY FAMILY RANTED AND RAVED ALL EVENING. THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME MAKING A PEACH COBBLER BY SCRATCH.  THE ONLY ALTERATIONS I MADE WAS I USED HALF THE SUGAR AND USED BUTTER SHORTENING, IT GAVE THE CRUST EXTRA FLAVOR.  I ALSO ADDED A LITTLE VANILLA AND I DIDN'T USE ALL OF THE JUICE WHEN I ADDED MY PEACHES TO THE CRUST.  WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE OVEN, IT WAS PICTURE PERFECT.  THANKS SO MUCH, I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!

This was my first time making peach cobbler, and it turned out great.  I did what some of the other reviewers said and reduced the sugar by half, and the sweetness was just right.  The only thing that I'll change next time would be to reduce the salt by a bit.

My whole family agreed that this is the best peach cobbler they have ever had. To save a little time, I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust and it worked out great.  The peach filling is wonderful.  I think the orange juice is the secret ingredient!  We can't wait for peach season to arrive.  I'll be making this quite often this summer.

This recipe was fabulous right out of the oven with Vanilla Bean ice cream.  I cut the recipe down about half because all these cobbler recipes make so much.  I kept the crust the same because I like really crusty cobblers.  My crust came out very crispy and flaky.  I also found this cobbler recipe is great using slightly unripe peaches.  The latticed crust, however, was time consuming and I ended up kind of fudging it so it looked like it was latticed.

This cobbler was SO good, I'm ashamed to admit it, but my boyfriend and I had devoured the entire thing between the two of us by the next day! I couldn't find fresh peaches this time of year, so I confess I used canned and drained all the syrup, and it was still fantastic!

This was incredibly delicious! Best dessert I've made so far off allrecipes. Most reviewers didn't change a thing and loved it, so I kept close to the recipe. I made it for half its serving size (9) and only changes I made were subbing 1/4 cup whole wheat flour for white and cutting back sugar to 3/4 cup. I followed everything else to a t, and it turned out gorgeously. I baked it in a glass dish 8x8 at 350 and it took 50 minutes until it was golden brown on top. It made a beautiful table presentation, topped with the "Whipped Cream" from this site.

I've always preferred this version of peach cobbler over the biscuit dough balls on top of fruit. I guess it's because it's the one I grew up loving. I always bake off strips of rolled out crust and layer it in with the filling. Also I think nutmeg can be a bit strong for fruit desserts. 1& 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon with 1 teaspoon lemon extract will complement the peaches nicely. No other juices are needed. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with canned peaches because the (heavy) syrup adds some needed sweetness & gives you a head start with your filling. I think a cobbler of this size needs at least 3 cups of sugar especially if you opt to use fresh peaches. Also a cobbler of this size needs at least 75-90 minutes in the oven. The sugars need time to caramelize a bit & begin to bubble up nicely. You'll need to lightly cover your cobbler with foil for half the baking time then remove it for proper browning.

Crust Recipe NOT CORRECT!  Made the crust EXACTLY as stated.  Used one cup of butter flavored shortening that was room temp.  Came out like a thick, sticky pancake batter.  Could not even roll it out it was so sticky.  Made 2nd batch in my food processor using the dough blade.  Used Ice cold unsalted butter.  Should have stopped at 3/4 cup but did not.  Had to add more flour to get it right.  You need to stop adding shortening when the flour mixture resembles coarse sand with rocks in it.  Then add the ice cold water and egg.  Shortening or butter needs to be COLD!  Reading other reviews on the peach mixture, I used half brown sugar and half white.  Cut back on the juices to 1/4 cup each and it still came out runny even with 2 1/2 T of corn starch.  Will try Elnore's Peach cobbler next.  Just way too much trouble with this recipe.

My family loved this recipe.  I used a few more fresh peaches than called for and .I used fresh lemon juice.I wish I had taken a picture as not only did it taste wonderful but it made a beautiful presentation.  Loved the crust. I have already had requests to make it again.

Thank you for posting this! A bbq place we used to go to in West Texas served a cherry version of this and I never could find a "pie crust" type cobbler recipe to copy it. This is BETTER and the crust is fantastic. Thanks again!

YUM!!!  i normally don't like cobblers and pies with fruit filling, but since my family and i got the opportunity to pick some wonderfully, sweet, Texas hill country peaches, i decided to make a cobbler.  this recipe was JUST what i was looking for.  it even worked well with me halving all of the ingredients for a smaller cobber.  the crust was fantastic (i used butter instead of shortening).  i also used a little brown sugar, along with the white sugar, in the peach mixture.  my husband said the recipe was a keeper...i tend to agree! :)

This was the best cobbler I have ever tasted!! It was so easy too.  I use store bought crust to save time when I make pies and cobblers and no one ever knows.  So because of my 'secret' I do not have a comment on the crust.  The filling is amazing and so delicious...I could of licked the dish clean...LOL  I did leave out the nutmeg for I am not a fan.  This recipe will be in my best of dishes for ever. Thanks for posting and sharing with the world.

This was wonderful. The only thing I think needs changed is increasing the corn starch to 3 tablespoons- the peach filling was a little too thin

This recipe is absolutely awesome!!!  I followed the directions for the most part...I added two more tablespoons of cornstarch.  Next time I will use a little less sugar.  I liked it as is, but the hubby wants less sugar :(

This peach cobbler is outstanding.  The dough rolled out easy and the combination of flavors was perfect. 

I took special care to make it beautiful, too, because I wanted to take a photo and upload it here with my father-in-law's old coffee maker from New Orleans.  

I made the recipe exactly as given and placed the cobbler in a round french white tart pan.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Kim

Fantastic recipe!  Reminds me of my great grandmothers cobbler from when I was little I have only attempted peach cobbler one other time and it didn't taste anything like I remembered so I wasn't really excited about trying another recipe but this one is spot on.  Thank you for bringing back such fond memories.

Was wonderful.  Made it for an office picnic & people some home to their families.  More of a cross between a cobbler & a pie (the lattice top), but a delicious way to use fresh summer peaches. It's a keeper!

Easy to make and delicious. I have never made desert before I am always just making dinners. My boyfriend and friends loved it. I used apples instead of peaches because peaches arent in season and just sauteed them longer in the butter  and juices. I also suggest making more crust as it is a little hard to stretch it all out.

This cobbler was terrific!  I had never made a cobbler before, but I do know what they are supposed to taste like and this was great! I did a couple of changes because I am dieting and I was making this for 2 people. I bought 2 lbs of fresh frozen peaches in the bag. I used 2 cups of Splenda Sugar which cuts down several calories because Splenda has 0 calories and is not as sweet as regular sugar. I also used 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I bought 2 frozen pie shells.  I browned one of the pie shells. I cooked the peaches and combined ingredients on the top stove for about five minutes until all was mixed thoroughly. Poured mixture into cooked pie shell and placed 2nd pie shell on top of cobbler. Poked holes in top pie shell and brushed butter on top and sprinkled top with Splenda, baked 30 minutes and it was delicious and a lot less calories.

This recipe was very good (my first cobbler), only I don't think I am a 'double crust' cobbler person.   There was too much dough and not enough filling (even though I followed other poster's advice and used more peaches).   The bottom crust also stuck to the baking pan even though it was well greased. Perhaps the use of a ceramic dish was the culprit?  The filling and top crust were delicious, (didn't have orange juice on hand, so I made without, and used only 3TBSP butter)   I would make this recipe again, for sure, but next time I will only put a top layer of crust, and double the filling.

This is great, BUT it's not a cobbler. It's a PIE.  The only difference here is that you're putting it in a square pan instead of a pie pan.

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A GREAT PEACH COBBLER RECIPE WITH THE TWO CRUSTS AND I FOUND IT! THIS IS AWESOME.  I TOOK SOME OF THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS AND ADDED 3 TBS. OF CORNSTARCH INSTEAD OF ONE.  USED 2 POUNDS OF FROZEN PEACHES AND ONE CAN OF PEACHES AND USED THE PEACH JUICE FROM THE CANNED INSTEAD OF THE ORANGE JUICE. I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE FOR THE CRUST, BUT AFTER I ROLLED OUT THE DOUGH, IT WAS TOO SOFT TO GET IT OFF THE COUNTER AND INTO THE PAN, SO HAD TO PIECE-MEAL IT INTO THE PAN. ROLLED OUT THE CRUST FOR THE TOP OF THE COBBLER AND HAD TO ALSO PIECE-MEAL IT ON TOP, BUT TURNED OUT GREAT. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS EXCELLENT RECIPE!

This cobbler is good. I used 15 peaches and 1/4 C. of both juices and 5 T.cornstarch. I think the nutmeg is over powering. Next time I will just use cinnamon. the crust is very good and can be used with other fruit pies/turnovers.

The final product ended up tasting fabulous.  The next time I will double or even triple the dough recipe.  I barley had enough dough to cover the bottom of an 8 inch square pan.  So, then I had a ton of extra filling.  Which I later put through my food processor, and then placed in my ice cream maker for a delicious peach ice cream.  I also didn't expect for this recipe to take all day long.

This was absolutely delicious! I am giving this 4 stars. I took everyones advice about this recipe by doing the following changes: 1 cup butter, 12-13 peaches, 2 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg, and 3.5 T corn starch. Including the lattice top I also added a crumb topping: 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup flour and 1/4 cup butter cubed. The ONLY thing I would change about this recipe is the orange juice and lemon juice. Even though I really reduced the OJ by half a cup, it had a trace of citrus flavor. Maybe next time I will 86 both the lemon and orange juice. Other wise, ENJOY! (My husband loved it too!)

Good recipe but lacks a little flavor.  I think it could use vanilla extract or I personally like almond extract with peaches.  Would make again and try adding additional flavor.

I used the suggested "tweaks" by Twitchery and this cobbler was fantastic!! I used 13 medium sized peaches, leaving the peel on for added "peachy" flavor. I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the top crust before baking. I used frozen pie crust rather than the recipe included. The whole family loved it!

After everyone raved about the crust, I was excited to try it!  But I was disappointed...nothing tremendous.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I did follow the recipe.  Also, the filling just wasn't great....it was ok...but not great.  Not sweet enough for me, and it had too much of a citrus taste.  Not my favorite, but not awful.

I wanted to give three stars, but because of the crust, I rate four stars.  I did not want to use too much ingredients in filling; they would overpower the natural taste of peach.  So, I just mix lemon juice, cornstarch, 1 cup of sugar, and peach for filling.  The crust was very good.  Next time, I would use 1/2 cup of shortening and 1/2 cup of butter to give more flavor.

Recipe was good but it was alot of work for a little gratification. Next time I would cut back on the juices and use a non-stick spray on the bottom and sides prior to putting down the crust or use a throw away pan altogether. In addition I would use a refrig dough from the supermarket and save myself the time, energy and mess. Overall it did come out very tasty and the kids thoroughly enjoyed it. Thanks

Overall, a smash hit.  It sure doesn't hurt that the pastry crust is easily done even by someone with minimal pastry crust experience (i.e., an old dude like me).  Got a couple of tweaks to suggest, while we're at it: 1) cut back the sugar in the filling to 1½ cups, particularly if the peaches are ripe; 2) back off the nutmeg to no more than ¼ tsp and substitute anywhere from a pinch to ¼ tsp of ground ginger; 3) make the butter/sugar crust topping optional.

For what it's worth, I supplied this as a dessert for a barbecue and got rave reviews, so this one's a winner.

FURTHER NOTES: it works quite well with apples as well.  Also, using something on the order of 1¼ x the original quantities for the crust would seem to work well for top crust coverage.  When using apples, add in at least ¼ tsp of ginger.

This is great.  I used pillsbury pie crust and rolled it very thin and was able to use two crusts, three would have given a more generous crust.  I made all of the other changes and it was perfect and easy.

This is a excellent recipe. Very good taste. Someone suggested broiling  the peaches for easier peeling.  I don't suggest that you do that.  Its takes away the taste from the peaches. I would suggest just using a peeler.

Although I did make a lot of modifications to suit my tastes and what I had on hand in the kitchen, this recipe was great. The crust is perfect - not the traditional cobbler crust, more like the frozen cobblers you'd buy at the store, which is what I like. I didn't use the orange juice/lemon juice method, just half a cup of water plus a teaspoon of lemon juice. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups. I increased the cinnamon a little and cut the nutmeg in half, but it seemed like it was still a little bit much for my tastes. All in all, it was very satisfying.

Delicious...even with Equal!  This can be made with various fruit - apple, blueberry, etc.  I used 1 29oz can of peaches.  This was more than enough for a two-member household.  I have made it twice and will definitely make it again.

In the three years I have been frequently visiting this site, I have yet to make a post.  However, I  do believe I will make an exception on this recipe. The only thing I did different was add more cornstarch so it would have a "soup" consistency. Other than that, it turned out FABULOUS! Thanks, it's a keeper.

Let's just say I was up till 10:00 PM making this, and was determined not to go to bed until I tried it. And it was well worth the wait. 1st I couldn't decide if I wanted to use Apples or canned peaches(used 3 29oz caned peaches). This has to be the best cobbler/pie (who cares) that i have tasted (don't tell mom) I only used 1 cup white sugar 1/2 cup brown sugar since canned peaches are already sweet, I added 1 tablespoon more of cinnamon, 1 tablespoon of vanilla flavoring, 4 tablespoons of flour and a 1/4 cup of brandy, and whatever else the recipe called for. Served w/vanilla ice cream and OMG!!! SO GOOD. Thanks for such a great recipe. ***Yes this was liquidy when it first came out but that's what makes a good sauce to go over ice cream. The next day the liquid had firmed up  but still just enough liquid to stand up to ice cream***

Simply delicious! I made the lattice top and it looked and tasted great. The family loved it. The only bad thing is that the filling was too juicy, and I even added an extra tablespoon of corn starch. Next time I'll add more starch or cook and reduce the liquids more before pouring into the crust.

I have never made a Peach Cobbler before and this recipe is a good blueprint to one. I only used a cup of sugar instead of 2, and also I added a little more nut meg and cinnimon. Instead of corn starch I used butter. But the end product came out wonderful!

Awesome recipe, love the top crust. I use one or two 16 oz. bag of frozen peaches, butter flavored shortening, and an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. This recipe wasn't liquidy at all and some people here said they made double the dough but I thought just one batch was perfect. mine is quite orangey because i dont think i use as many peaches as the recipe calls for, so if you do the same, you could cut back alittle on the juice but I like its tanginess. scoop of french vanilla ice cream makes this dessert just perfect. next time i want to add raspberries!

this was a great recipe! i am by no means a good baker, and this turned out perfect. i made no adjustments other than taking others advice and halving the sugar, adding an extra tblsp of cornstarch, and using a cookie cutter on to cut out shapes for the top. lattice work is beyond me. thanks for the great recipe and advice!

So easy to make and very flavorful.  I used only 1 cup of sugar and no lemon juice.  It tasted very orangy.  next time I will try to flavor it with peach juice rather than the orange and I will use splenda.  I used fresh peaches too.  I will make this again.

I've been looking for a good peach cobbler recipe for some time now.  I tried this recipe two days ago, and it just didn't quite do it for me.  There is a bit too much orange juice in this recipe.  It is also too soupy.  I think I will try it one last time and reduce the orange and lemon juice, and maybe try flour instead of cornstarch.  The crust was hard to work with, but it turned out pretty good. Use a little bit more cold water and let it chill for an hour instead of 30 minutes.

This was a very good recipe, but the orange juice flavor was just a little too much. Don't get me wrong, no one had problems eating this, but they recommened to not add the orange juice next time, and I agree. Besides the orange juice, this is a very good recipe. The crust was very good and flaky! Definately a keeper (with one adjustment)! Thanks!

Great recipe!! Flavor is exceptional! Despite my other culinary skills, pie crust is not somehting I make well and this crust was light and delicious. This is a definite keeper.

This recipe is sooo good.  There is enough crust if you do a thin bottom crust and a lattice for the top, doesn't have to be a proper one, just make strips and lay some one way and some the other.  Plus cobbler is supposed to be a bit soupy, more so than pie.  I have been making one very close to this since I was a kid but the addition of the lemon and orange make it that much nicer, and the crust is so good.  However, I did have lard on hand, a very good quality one that I make home made tortillas out of and used that for the crust instead of shortening cause I am in a country visiting where they do not have Crisco...  :(  But the upside is that the crust was the best cobbler crust I have ever hand.  Thanks for this rockin recipe!

It tasted great, but when I had to use the remaining half of the dough to place on top of the peaches in a lattice, I didn't have nearly as much as I was supposed to. I had to remake another ball. I would add more of each ingredient to the dough part of the recipe in case this happens again, or to anyone else. Other than that, a great recipe for classic peach cobbler.

YUMMY! 
This was my first peach cobbler ever and it was great. Spices were perfect, but it was a bit too sweet so I would cut back on sugar. Also I added a Tbsp. of vinegar to make up the 1/4 cup water so as to make a flaker crust. It turned out perfect. 
I thought it may be a bit too runny but once cooled completely it was no longer runny. Will make this a lot!

This was sooooo good! I used 2 cans of cherry pie filling (I wanted cherry cobbler instead of peach). I also substituted butter for half the shortening, and used an egg substitute instead of an egg to cut a calorie or two, LOL. I added a bit of vanilla to the crust, and served with vanilla bean ice cream. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Oh My goodness, It was sooooooo good. This was my first time making peach cobbler and it was excellent. I chaeted a little though. I used canned peaches with the juice drained and i didnt lattice the top i just rolled it out flat like the bottom half of the pastry and put some slits on top. It was soooooo good. Thank you for the recipe

I made this for thanksgiving and my parents loved it!! They couldnt get enough of it, and asked me to make it for Christmas as well!! Great recipe!!!  I did however, had to make an extra batch of dough, as it was simply not enough for both the bottom layer crust and the top.  I defanitly recommend to make an extra batch.

Exceptional peach cobbler!  I have been searching for years for a REAL peach cobbler.  Everything nowadays is biscuit-y or cake-y.  I wanted a real cobbler with pastry.  This fills the bill very well.  It is great as is, but for the second one I made, I looked in my refrigerator and saw some whipping cream and on a whim replaced the lemon and orange juice with the whipping cream.  It was incredible!  This is a great recipe!  Next time I'm going to try it with blackberries!!

This was the first time I made cobbler and I took it to work and it was a hit.  I didn't have enough peaches so I did add blueberries and took some of the other's suggestions to cut the sugar to 1 cup and substituted butter for shortning.  I will definately use this again.  Crust was very tasty could use with any fruit.

Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!  I can't believe how easy it was to make, I have never made a homemade cobbler or pie.  I did reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup and I doubled the cornstarch. The peach mixture was still VERY watery, so I just spooned the peached out into the pan and added what I thought would be enough juice.   Rolling out the dough was a challenge, but I think if I had made more, it may have been too thick and it would have have cooked as well on the bottom of the pan.  Great recipe, thank you!!!

WOW! Since my husband is a diabetic, I substituted Splenda in exact amounts for the sugar - and based on other reviews, knocked up the cornstarch amount a bit. It was wonderful!  My husband groaned for 10 mins while he ate his. The crust is superb! Not your cakey - spongy quick cobbler type recipe. Absolutely Wonderful - will make this my only peach cobbler recipe!

This recipe is really great. It's definately mor like a peach pie because of the crust. I used 4 tbsp of flour instead of cornstarch( FYI:for any recipe 1Tbsp starch=2Tbsp flour) and continued to heat the peach/flour mixture until the sauce thickened before pouring onto the crust. My peaches were tart so the sugar was not a problem. The filling is by far the best I have tasted, butI wanted a more flacky crust mine was just like pie dough. I am sorry peoplee had problems with this recipe, but I think if you change to many things you won't get the specifed results. For sure if you use fresh fruit add more starch/flour.This is not what I know as traditional soft dough crust cobbler, but it's good and you can always try a different crust.

I made this for our family Fourth of July celebration.  After reading the reviews, I opted to reduce the sugar to 1 cup, reduce the orange juice to 1/2 cup, substituted arrowroot for cornstarch and increase it to 2 tablespoons,increase the crust recipe by 1 1/2, substitute cold butter for shortening and use cookie cutter cut outs for the top crust instead of the lattice.  I served it warm topped with vanilla ice cream.  This is an amazing dessert and this recipe will become my staple for cobblers.  The crust came out flaky and light -- really just perfect for a cobbler.  Next time I would like to try substituting peach nectar for the orange juice.    I made this again and followed the recipe, except I omitted the orange juice and cornstarch and increased crust by another half.  I cannot tell you how delicious this is!  I'm pie crust challenged, so I used my food processor to form the dough...it still came out incredible.

WATERY. Great flavor, crust is insanely good ontop... my bottom crust came out soggy due to how watery the filling was. I added extra cornstarch to this recipe after reading the reviews and it didn't help at all! I will give this recipe another try only because of the reviews. Perhaps I made a mistake or need to do some more tweaking.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day and my mother in law who usually responds to my cooking as "That was...nice" actually loved this recipe and commented on how picture perfect and tasty it was!!  It was time consuming, but well worth it.  I also used jarred peaches instead of fresh, and it still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I have never in my 38 years made anything with a crust from scratch.  My mom told me she had a taste for peach cobbler and that she had some fresh sliced peaches.  She in turn gave me a look that only a mother can give and I wouldn't dare tell her no.  After a while of searhing for the absolute best and easiest recipes I found this one and I must add for this being my first time baking peach cobbler it turned out great.  Although I did use the butter flavored shortening.  This is a great recipe.  Need I say my mother put in her request for the next holidays and her birthday.  Thanks a million.

I am really not a peach cobbler gal...but I am now. This was scrumptious! The only thing I would change is to use more peaches or less sugar. I think 3 pounds of peaches is not enough for the amount of sugar and other ingredients. I would double the amount of peaches and leave recipe as is.

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  The flavor is just wonderful.  The crust is also delicious, although it is very difficult to put it into a criss cross pattern on the top.  All I do is line the bottom, and then make three long strips to place on top of the cobbler.  It is very good!

This was the first time I made a Peach Cobbler, and boy was it well received.  Everyone raved about it.  Next time though I think I may cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup.  Overall though, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I have many containers of frozen peaches that I am trying to use up (before this summer's peaches ripen) and have I ever found the recipe for that purpose!  This was delicious!!  I am so sorry that I did not have any ice cream on hand because ice cream would have made it even better.  I think I will decrease the amount of sugar next time because it was very sweet.  I too added about a half tablespoon of cornstarch because my peaches were so juicy.  I can't wait to make it for company.

This is not my first time making a cobbler and it won't be my last . I enjoy baking professionally and for my family and friends. Heads up for beginners. no one tells you when you're dealing with fresh fruit that sometimes you get more liquid so here's my suggestion when you make the fruit part of this recipe dip the fruit out leaving the juice. Then placing the fruit in the dish. Then you pour the juice as needed. I took Twitchery and Daisy Mae directions except for I did not use any ginger and I used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon nutmeg. My family loves the taste of cinnamon with the fruit. I also covered the cobbler with a full crust and I brushed  melted butter and cinnamon sugar on top place a hole in the center.. Besides the fruit the crust is the best part of the cobbler so why would anyone want less crust on a cobbler.

Excellent cobbler I made it twice once with the butter crust and once with the shortening crust. Personally I like the way the butter crust looked but I preferred the taste of the shortening crust. The butter crust had a butter undertone taste. But the filling is great I added a little more cornstarch to make it a bit thicker. But I will definitely be making this again

Will make it again. I love peach cobbler! I eliminated the orange juice  (just a personal preference). Dropped the amount of lemon juice to 2 tablespoons and used 2 large cans of peaches(included the syrup from 1 of the cans of peaches).  I increased the cinnamon to 2 teaspoons and decreased the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon (again personal preference). I added 4 tablespoons of milk along with the cornstarch to make the filling creamy. I used 3/4 cups of sugar and 2 cups of brown sugar. Added a teaspoon of vanilla extract . Let it simmer for about 15 minutes. I kept crust recipe as is (this Southern lady will always have vegetable shortening ??) I definitely browned the bottom crust. Added my peaches but I didn't use all of the juice from my filling. I added the second crust cut slits on the top and baked for 40 minutes.   Family and friends loved it.

i used canned peaches in heavy syrup, drained.  With that being said, I only used 1/2 c. white and 1/2 c. brown sugar. i omitted the orange juice since another reviewer  said it gave a weird taste. i added 4 tble spoons of cornstarch to the peach mixture since other reviewers complained it was too runny, any whoo.....great crust. I also doubled the crust because we love pie crust in this family. i am a lazy cook but it wasnt too hard to do this one. most delicious.  great warm straight from the oven with a dollop of whip cream on top. yum yum

The crust is a little bit of work but worth it, I will use this crust again for other recipes. I have made this several times and everytime I make it for parties people ask for the recipe.    There is never leftovers!  The only change I made was increasing the cornstarch to 2T.  This is a good old fashioned cobbler like my grandmother from KY used to make.

I didn't feel like making a crust so I used a pie crust and cut the portion size down to 8. Baked the bottom pie crust in the oven for 20 minutes to reduce the chances of it turning out soggy. While baking the bottom pie crust, I mixed together the ingredients. I had a couple cans of peaches on hand and used those. (Lite Del Monte peaches). Turned out DELICIOUS! Served with butter pecan ice cream for a little different taste.

Just made this and have to say it was the best.  I modified after reading other reviews.  Used 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup orange juice and used 3.5 tablespoons corn starch.  I cooked the peach mixture on low heat after adding the sugar mixture until I could judge the thickness of the peach mixture.  Baked it for 40 minutes, cooled for about an hour, served over vanilla ice cream and my family said "this was the best Peach Cobbler they had ever had!"  Thank you for this recipe!

Exactly how my mom and grandma made peach cobbler. I now cheat by using Pillsbury pie crusts. I only subbed a cup of sugar with a cup of brown sugar and I added half a tbsp of vanilla before pouring half of the peach mixture in the pan. I then like to put a pie crust in the pan to cover as much of the first level as possible; then I poured in the rest and did a lattice top.  I made a peach cobbler worthy of a church picnic. This is a great recipe for an old-school Southern peach cobbler; my co-workers love it too!

I was in a hurry and didn't read the comments, so I ended up with a watery disaster.  It tasted great, but no one would touch it--it just didn't look like cobbler.  My fresh peaches were sweet and very, very juicy.  I'll try again but pour off half of the juice, use more cornstarch, less sugar, and double crust.  (Good crust--used all butter)

I LOVE this recipe! It reminds me of the cobblers my mom made when I was little. I don't do a thing to the recipe (and I've made it several times) and it always comes out great. I actually used food coloring and made a Halloween cobbler today...it was a big hit. I personally don't think it is too sweet but being a crust lover, I suppose you could double the recipe...but then isn't that just making a big pie?

The overall flavor of this cobbler is excellent--one of the best I've ever had.  It was a bit too sweet for me, so the next time I make it I am going to cut the white sugar in the filling down to 1 1/2 cups. It was a bit runny, so next time I will increase the cornstarch to  2 tbs.   I also did not use the dough recipe provided.  I was afraid that the dough would be too cakey.  Instead, I tried the Flaky Pie Crust recipe found in the allrecipes collection.  It was amazing.  I also tried a different topping--a crumbly topping of 1/2 c. of brown sugar, 1/2 c. of flour, and a 1/4 c. of butter, with about 1/4 cup of oats.  Definitely one of the best from scratch recipes I've ever tried!

I have made this recipe twice (for groups of 15 or more) and I received a lot of compliments and they ate it all. My friends especially like the flaky crust. One of them known for his baking told me that the first time he thought it was a fluke; but the second time was even better. I even made the crust the night before and it was very good. My husband, who always asks a 70+ year old friend to make him peach cobbler told me that he would not be requesting that from her anymore because I mastered it. Thanks for sharing!

Note: I modified the recipe to use canned peaches in their own juice. I used the peach juice in place of orange juice and it was wonderful - otherwise I followed the directions.  Oh by the way, I also used butter & shortening  when I made the crust the second time because I ran out of shortening and it was really good.

I made this cobbler exactly by the recipe and it was delicious!  May have used a few more peaches than the recipe called for.  Some have suggested using 4 pounds instead of 3.  This one is definitely a keeper!  Loved the crust, too.

Wonderful recipe as is. I just added more sugar to the top, a tiny bit more cornstartch, & broiled the top to brown it for a few sec. LOVELY recipe! I also felt there wasn't enough crust but after baking it was perfect!

I have used this several times.  This recipe has given others the impression that I am a real cook.  I love it and the best thing is I can take this to any event and it is a great hit. I have added a teaspoon of vanilla flavor to give it a great kick.  Thank you.

OUTSTANDING! The recipe submitted by the top reviewer worked wonderfully and do what (s)he says and add another 50% of the crust recipe into the dough, you'll need the extra to cover the top perfectly. But alas, it was fantastic.

Oh my goodness.  This was absolutely the most delicious cobbler/pie I have ever eaten, and I don't care much for peaches.  I even used peaches that weren't quite ripe enough and it still turned out divine.  If it is too runny, simply add a little more cornstarch.  Mine was perfect.  I also used a crumb topping on top and made it in an 8x8 baking dish.  Absolutely fabulous.

Gave it only 3 because it is a pie and not a cobbler. The flavor is excellent. Cobbler is called cobbler because it is cobbled together.

I really liked this recipe and the only thing keeping it from reaching 5 stars may have been my fault.  It was a little too tart for me.  I cut down on the orange juice and it was perfect but I may not have had enough peaches so like I said may have been my fault

For me the crust needed extra flour but aside from that thisd recipe was perfect!  I used two cans of peaches that I drained and rinsed and then followed the directions here for.  Everyone loved it, including my southern girlfriend who always compares everything to the way her grandma made it.  Thank you!

The flavour was very good, although I found it to be very juicy. I think if one added more cornstarch to the peaches it would help, I'll have to try it next time. Otherwise, it was excellent.

Loved it! This is my new standard cobbler recipe!  I didn't have enough fruit on hand, so I halved the filling and added some bluberries to make an 9x9" dish, but I kept the full recipe of crust.  It was delicious!

Update 10/1/08- I made it this weekend and put the 2 cups called for and it came out delicious! 5 stars!!  I believe since we're using fresh peaches, we must use the 2 cups sugar called for.  Thanks for this recipe!

I followed TWITCHERY's advice that said to cut the sugar in half.  Big mistake!  The cobbler came out fine except for cutting the sugar.  The consistency, pastry, etc. was perfect except I had to add confectioner's sugar on top so that we can eat it. Next time I'll put the 2 cups called for in the recipe. It would've been a 5 star recipe for sure.

This peach cobbler recipes does have the best crust. I have made this several times and everyone always loves it.  It is a BIG KEEPER in my house.  I have even (once) not peeled the peaches and it was still really good.  You can't go wrong with this recipes.  It is wonderful!!!

This is the kind of cobbler I remember as a kid... not the biscuit dough variety.  Like others, I made some changes.  I used only 1 cup of sugar (used 1/2 C white and 1/2 C brown).   Thats the only change I used. However, when I make it again, I will definitely add more cornstarch as the batter was runny and I'll also reduce the orange juice as I think it added to the runniness.  Also, my peaches were fresh, but a little too hard, so make sure you cook long enough for the fruit to soften. I didn't increase the dough, but next time I will as I had to roll it out too thin to easily use.  The crust is absolutely delicious.

I made this cobbler for my husband and his guys at the fire station.  It was very good, but I followed the directions and since it didn't mention "greasing the pan" I didn't.  The bottom portion of the cobbler stuck in hard to the baking dish I used.  However, the rest of the cobbler was really yummy and the guys loved the treat!

The first time I made this it turned out good but a little too sweet. Also i had to double the recipe for the dough so it would cover the bottom of the pan and the top. The second time i made it turned out even better. instead of doing 2 crust i just did one on the top. I did a crust that covered the whole top, not a latice work top. Also instead of 2 cups of granulated sugar i put in 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated sugar. I took it to a party and everyone loved it.

I made this just the other night..I actually made two batches. Gave one to a friend for her birthday and shared the other with my family and my boss. Everyone thought it was AWESOME!! Thanks so much! I thought it was a bit too sweet which is why I left four starts instead of five..but no one else complained.

Pretty much used the pie crust recipe for this cobbler but it was worth more then 5 stars.  My grandmother passed away without leaving her recipe for apple cobbler which is the best I have ever tasted and this crust is the closest I have ever come to her crust.  So, you do not know how much I appreciate you posting it.  The only thing I changed was adding butter flavored shortening.

My boyfriends brother was having a big dinner one night and asked me to make a pie. So i decided to make a peach cobbler. Why i don't know, being that i'd never made one before. Used this recipe. As it turns out, the cobbler was the first thing gone on the dessert table. They all loved it! As a matter of fact, 2 grown men were arguing over the last piece. It was a big hit!!

This is incredibly. My younger sister's friend even called me for asking for the recipe after I made it when my sister was having her friends over. Sadly, I only got a small slice, as all three of them ate the rest.

Outstanding.  So far I've made this twice. I did a few things differently each time.  The first time I added less sugar and used pineapple juice instead of orange juice since it's what I had on hand.  It wasn't as pretty as some of the other pictures posted but not bad for my first lattice.  The second time I still used less sugar and since I didn't have enough peaches on hand I used mixed fruit - golden delicious apples, peach and mango.  Again I didn't have orange juice and was out of pineapple juice so that's where the mango came in.  I thought it would be a nice substitute since it's so juicy.  Well, d e l i c i o u s!  I'll post a pictures of both soon.

I loved this recipe, I also used less juice. 
I also made the crust with 1 cup of unsalted butter instead of shortening. It was the best crust I have ever had and I come from a Pie Eating family.

I absolutely loved this recipe! This was my first attempt at making my own crust and it turned out to be the best. I will never buy frozen again. Although my husband said it was too sweet, that is easily fixed w/ reduction of sugar to 1 1/2 cups. The cooked peaches did run a bit when we cut into it, but the next day it wasn't a problem. If it's too liquidy, I suggest using it as an ice cream topping. Yum!

This recipe is fantastic!!  I did as some of the others suggested and didnt use quite as much OJ or lemon juice..and I reduced the sugar by about 1/2 cup or so because I had some really good juicy peaches.  The cobbler turned out wonderful though!!  Will definately be using this again!  Would be a great dessert to take to a church dinner!

We really enjoyed this with a crumb topping.  Watch the liquid if you are using very juicy peaches.  I cooked 4-5 pounds in the pan with 1/4 cup butter and 1/3 cup homemade apricot jam before adding sugar & cornstartch.

I'm sure this is going to be good because I grew up in NE AR where we used to go to Campbell, MO to pick peaches. No peaches this year as the frost killed everything late this spring! Will certainly save your recipe.

Okay so i cheated, i didn't use homemade crust, i didn't have the time.......BUT it still turned out great!  The only thing I did differently was cut back on the sugar, it called for   2 cups white sugar, but I cut it back to 1 1/2, but i'm not to big on sweet stuff, plus the less sugar the better for us people watching
 our weight  ;-)  

Overall very tasty, but one question, how do you measure three pounds of peaches?  I just filled the baking pan until the amount of peaches satisfied me.

I cut back the sugar in the peaches to just 1 cup like others had suggested. If I make this again I will probably make a little more crust. I thought the orange juice was a little overpowering to the peaches, but everyone else loved it and told me not to change a thing, so who knows?

This was great. I would suggest adding a little Vanila extract and half the sugar and add brown sugar. Ive made this twice and everyone loved it.I would have to say with these minor changes makes it that much better.

Delicious - I had some trouble with the crust but that's because it was so hot and humid I kept having to freeze it so it wouldn't melt! Only change I would make is to double the pastry cause I couldn't get it on the sides - again, maybe the weather? I also cooked the peaches for a lot longer to bring out the flavor. Divine with vanilla ice cream!

This was fabulous.  I used canned peaches and premade uncooked crust and it was still delicious.  I added 2 TBS tapioca to cut down on the soupiness and it worked great.  Thanks!

My dough did not turn out very well because I didn't have a pastry blender. But as far as that, it wasn't that bad. I will definitely make it again once I get the pastry blender.

delicious, a great way to use up our frozen peaches from the summer.  i don't know if it was the way i made the crust, but mine was not flaky at all!!  i'll be more careful with the crust next time.  as for the filling, the only thing that i would change is the amount of orange juice--i'd put in less to let the peach flavor come out better.

I made this cobbler last Easter, and my aunts haven't stopped talking about it since. Relatively easy (I'm NOT much of a cook) too.  Will cut back on the sugar this time, as it was a bit sweet for me, and the OJ really sweetens it up.

Made recipe as ingredients called for but instead of orange juice I replaced with cider. I was out of orange juice. The dough was easy to make and the cobbler was great. Would make again. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for dinner last night; my family of seven absolutely loved it!! I did alter the recipe all little after reading the other reviews, I started by doubling the amount of cornstarch, but that did thicken it enough for me, so I added 2T of flour, which did the trick! Thanks for the post!

This cobbler was delicious.  The crust was really good.  It was a bit soupy. Next time I will cut back on the liquids. I used about 3 1/2 to 4 lbs of fresh peaches 1C white sugar and 1C brown sugar, because my family likes everything sweet.

Yummy!  I added 2 cups of blueberries and 4 cups of peaches.  I 1 1/2 times the crust and just pressed it into the bottom of the pan and did a lattice on the top.  The crust was very hard to work with, but was good tasting.  A very good recipe that I will keep.

I can eat this whole cobbler!  I have made this three times, and always use frozen peaches, however, I let them cook on low along with the butter, juices, sugar and spices for an hour. (I highly recommend doing this)Although, my dough never looks as great as the posted picture, it is wonderful.

An amazing recipe.  The first time I made this I used old frozen peaches and it tasted ok.  The next time I made it with fresh peaches and what a difference.  It was like tasting a piece of heaven.

Tasted pretty good, but was very time consuming.  I also had A LOT of liquid.  Next time I will omit the orange juice, could taste it in the cobbler.

Great & versatile recipe! I used nectarenes. They were very juicy, so I decreased the OJ & increased the corn starch as suggested in other reviews. I've used the crust recipe on other pies. Always good!

I did take the advice of others and cut the OJ to 1/4 cup and added 4 TBS of cornstarch, it was still a bit soupy.I didn't add all the sauce that was leftover I had to use a slotted spoon; overall it tasted GREAT. My husband and his family loved it.

This is the peach cobbler recipe I had been looking for.  I made it for a family gathering and it was GONE!  The bottom crust stuck just a little...and it was a tiny bit soupy but it was delicious!!! I used Dole frozen sliced peaches instead of fresh.  They worked great since they have no added sugar.

Everyone wanted seconds for this dessert. I did however add some blueberries that I had frozen earlier in the year. Delicious. You could use a little more corn starch if you add the blueberries.

This was a good recipe but I changed several things after reading most of the other reviews.  Used splenda (just over a cup) instead of sugar.  Used splenda in the crust also...BTW...the crust is excellent!  Didn't have any OJ but didn't seem to need it.  Also ended up using 3 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I think because my peaches were "very, very" ripe.  Sprinkled the very top crust with a little bit of sugar/cinnamon mixture and drizzled the butter over it as suggested.  It was still quite soft and didn't set up, but still good.  It was not "soupy" though.

This is the best peach cobbler ever & one of my favorite recipes. I've added extra corn starch as others have to the recipe but found that it's delicious either way. Great flavor, love the crust........A definite keeper & well worth the time. Thank you for the great recipe!

the cobbler definately was delicious.  since peaches are in season, i had very ripe peaches.  i think because of that it came out very runny, even though i cooked the peaches longer than required, trying to get the excess liquid cooked down.  i even baked it longer than required.  next time, i think i'll try other readers suggestions and add more corn starch to thicken it up.

A hit! So much so, friends and co-workers want to pay me to make it for them. Two chefs I know rave about it! And the kicker is--I'm new to cooking. I admit I cheat -- I use frozen peaches. But, it still tastes great.

I could not lattice the crust, possibly because I just could not figure it out, so I just placed chunks of dough in with the peaches and it turned out great. First cobbler I have ever made. My bottom crust did stick to the pan.

I received about 10 marriage proposals off of this recipe. It's fantastic. The crust alone will make so many good spin-offs.

Wow!  This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and though it took awhile it was sooo worth it.  I served it hot with vanilla ice cream (the only way to eat cobbler!) and the whole pan was gone in about thirty minutes.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe.

This was great!  The crust is awesome.  I made a small one for my husband and I.  I used the crust as directed, then halved the rest of it, except the cornstarch.  This turned out really good.  Next time I will put in a little less sugar, as we like fruit desserts to be a little less sweet.

Wonderful.  Patty had a good suggestion for making a lattice top.  I added an extra cup of sugar to the peaches, a teaspoon of vanilla and a half cup of cornstarch.  Next time, I'll use more starch.  I also doubled the crust and put a whole crust on top.

I was looking for an old-fashioned peach cobbler recipe and this it...GREAT!  It was the first time I had ever made peach cobbler.  I followed helpful hints given (add a cup of sugar to the peach mixture, increased the cornstarch by one cup and double the crust).  My family loved it!  I will definitely make continuously.

Delicious!  I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about the orange juice - but it added a great flavor.  

DEFINETLY increase the cornstarch to 2 TBL as other reviewers have suggested.  It would have been way too watery with jsut 1 TBL.  I found that the dough made for plenty of crust (which I cut into strips and layed down on top, without doing the lattice).

I had a somewhat tart variety of peach, so I used most of the 2 cups sugar (probably 1 3/4 c).  1 1/2 cups would have been fine, even with the tart peaches.

I made this recipes and southern peach cobbler for a picnic we attended.  Took this one didn't take the other (read that review under Southern Peach Cobbler)  Very tasty. I did however have some problems.  When I tried to "lattice" the top the strips kept breaking appart. I was very frustrated by this.  Also, it was so difficult trying to "lattice" with the hot peaches.  Top kept "melting" and I couldn't move it.  If I make again I will put whole crust over top.

I made this recipe for a Kentucky Derby party and people raved about it!  It was my first cobbler and because peaches were out of season I used frozen peaches and blackberries(one 16 oz. bag of each).  I had also never made dough for crust before so I used refrigerated(not frozen) pie crusts.  Probably not as good as making it from scratch but was still pretty good.  You'll need two 15 oz. packages - about 1 1/2 packages should be about perfect.  The recipe called for 1/4" thick dough on the top but the refrigerated is already rolled to about 1/8".  Maybe double the up the pre-rolled dough on top?  The only other minor change I'd suggest is a light greasing of the bottom of the dish as the juice got underneath the dough during baking and made it hard to scrape out the bottom layer of crust.  This recipe was so easy and tasted awesome!  If I can do it so can you!

This is the best peach cobbler my husband has had. Again I do my christmas parties at work and make this I recently did a retirement party at my job and have been flooded with request to make some coworker their own peach cobbler. One coworker of mine actually gets offended when I make it at home and bring some in and don't bring him any. I love this site the reviews are always so helpful in helping you narrow down the recipe best for you. Another coworker of mine who is also famous for her peach cobbler likes the way the top crust is inner twined she always just threw hers on top.

AWESOME!  This was my 1st try.  The recipe was very easy and the crust was so flaky.  I used Crisco Butter Shortening to kick up it a notch.  I will definitely make this again and again and again and....

I've never tried peach cobbler before this, and it was very good. Although when adding the egg/water mixture, I found that 1/4 cup was too much and had to add more flour to remove some of the extra moisture. I also thought the recipe was a little too sweet even after I reduced it by a 1/4. I also added (a teaspoon) more cornstarch like it was mentioned below. Overall, for my first attempt, I didn't think it was difficult AT ALL. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to impress.

My husband thought this was very good; a "keeper" recipe. I don't like peaches, so I won't include what I thought, but Hubby said that next time, I should decrease the amount of cinnamon. I used 6 average-sized ripe peaches bought from our local farmer's market. It was a lot of work, but I enlisted my hubby to help and also our 4-year-old son.

Just finished this about 15 minutes ago and just had a piece, yummy!  I followed the recipe except added an extra 1/2T cornstarch and I always double the amount of cinnamon in a recipe and I also sprinkled some on top.  This is by far the best peach cobbler recipe I've tasted.  Very delicious.  I think next time I will double the crust recipe since I found it hard to roll out so thin and place in the pan, other than that, it's wonderful:)

I followed the recipe to the tee, and this peach cobbler was outstanding!  After taking it out of the oven, I thought that it was too watery, but after allowing it to cool for a while, the cobbler set perfectly.  It was so great, a co-worker and my mom (a real Martha Stewart) wanted the recipe after they tasted it.  Also, my husband, who works late shift, woke me up 3:00 in the morning to tell me “You did not cook this!  Who cooked this?” When I told him that I did, he said “This is so good that I have to sit down and eat this with my vanilla ice cream!” Delicious!

I am a gourmet cook...involved receipe, but well worth the effort. I used half reduced fat margarine and half a fat substitute. I used egg beaters instead of real eggs and less sugar. It came out gorgeous. I had plenty of dough for the lattice work. I recommend this receipe to the expert cook. I served it with hpomemade peach ice cream for a Happy Labor Day. Enjoy!

The recipe was great!  It was fairly easy and the orange juice added a nice tangy quality to balance the sweetness.

This was very good, but there was not enough dough for top & bottom.  I used all the dough for the bottom and made at crumb top instead. It came out very good. Everyone at my party loved it.

I thought this was an okay peach cobbler.  There wasn't enough dough in the recipe.  The inside of the cobbler wasn't condensed enough.

This makes the Best peach cobbler I've ever had!  The only thing I add is a pinch of ground ginger to the simmering peaches.
The dough is so easy to work with, that I actually look forward to preparing it!  Yummy!

Made all the recommended changes, except used 1/2 shortening and 1 c butter in the crust when doing 1.5 x the recipe.  I would also reduce the amount of sugar in the crust.  The filling is sweet enough!

I made this one for our xmas office luncheon.  Was a big hit and I got asked for the recipe.  Had to double the ingredients cause there were 30 people to serve.  Now I'm going too have to make it for our family xmas dinner.

This is the best peach cobbler recipe I’ve ever used. I always get rave reviews when I serve it.  I must be doing something wrong when I make the crust though. It tends to tear apart when I roll it out and put it in the pan. I always have to piece it together. What am I doing wrong?  The crust has wonderful flavor.

No changes and already made another batch! Very yummy but I have trouble keeping the crust together.  it may be because I live in such a dry environment.  Definitely keeping and sharing this one.

Too much liquid goes in the filling, the crust did not taste good, it was like peach jam in a funny tasting crust. I will stick with my old Betty Crocker circa 1950’s peach pie recipe.

Too much liquid in this recipe which makes it too soupy for our taste.  I cut the sugar in half because I thought 2 cups of sugar would be too sweet.  The flavor of the sauce was very good.  I made it a second time, cut the liquids in half and added 12 oz of fresh raspberries.  Much better!

I made it just as stated however I used off brand canned peaches and instead of white sugar, I used brown sugar in the raw on the top of the crust. For the crust, I used crisco butter flavored shortening sticks. Easy to add. The peach cobbler should have a slightly thick juicy filling otherwise it becomes a Peach Pie and not a cobbler. This recipe is the best and loved by many.

Delicious! I followed the most helpful reviews suggestions, minus the vanilla (I thought I had some, but no.). My cobbler was still a bit runny. I used a little over 4 lb of peaches, not very ripe ones, firm. I did feel that maybe I needed a bit more crust, but it worked out well. Next time I’ll make some changes, more crust, more cornstarch perhaps?

Had a pound of frozen peaches I wanted to use up, so I just adjusted the ingredients for the peaches.  I did do the full crust recipe however, and found it just right amount for a full bottom & top crust (no lattice for me) in 8x8 pan.  Came out beautifully.

I made this dessert looking for a recipe close to my grandmother's who was from Louisiana.  This recipe was right on! If I closed my eyes and ate some I would swear my grandmomma made it.

I've made this twice.  I used ready made pie crusts and added mango.  Both times I took it to pot luck July 4 events.  Everyone raved and several said best cobbler they had ever put in their mouth.

Delicious!  But it was runny.  Gave it five stars anyway assuming it was my error.

Way too much liquid that will not easily thicken.  Cut down orange juice to half a cup or even one quarter.  Also, pastry needs butter as well as shortening for flavor.

Not a great recipe, and this isn’t cobbler, its pie.
As written, it doesn’t have enough cornstarch to set it up (depends how juicy your peaches are though), is far too sweet and the crust needs more instruction wrt adding liquid... if you’re at different altitudes it can come out all wrong.
I still say it’s not a cobbler at all... but for those who had it work for them, bon appetit!

I use my Mother's pie crust recipe for this which none can compare to.  Follow Twitchers suggestions for tweaking the recipe.  It is loaded with lots of flavor.  If I have them, I stir in fresh blueberries with the filling.

This is DELICIOUS!!  I used a Pil****ry pie crust (1.5 of them) on the bottom, and the other 1/2 on the top, and then followed TWITCHERY's recipe, which was just the right amount of liquid and sugar (which is much less than the original recipe).   I know... if you aren't going to make it the way it's written, don't rate it.   But... it was DELICIOUS!!

I was out of nutmeg so I used a bit more cinnamon instead and it was perfect. I loved how the top crust got crisp. Perfect cobbler every time!

A  lot of Southern peach cobbler recipes are soupy.  My grandmother was from St Louis and she made the best cobbler I've ever eaten.  Hers wasn't runny or soupy.  I just don't have her recipe.   I don't really care for cobblers with the biscuit topping.   I was looking for a cobbler with crust and came across this recipe. 

This one has wonderful flavor with the combination of orange and lemon juice and the combination of spices. I added 3 tbsp of cornstarch( I prefer firmer cobblers).   Thank you for a wonderfully flavored peach cobbler.

I was worried about making this becasue my wife had tried a different recipe and her crust did not come out well. This recipe is incredible. I made this for the first time. The only changes I made were that I used canned peaches and substituted syrup from the canned peaches instead of orange juice. Everyone at the cookout ate it up. Will definitely make it again.

I'm an old man who is rather new at cooking, but I had the same experience with this cobbler that I do with lots of pies. It was delicious but much of the bottom crust stuck to the bottom of the dish and became very hard.  Am I supposed to grease the dish?  It wasn't called for in the recipe.

This was the closest recipe I found to be similar to how my grandmother used to make her peach cobbler.  To help cut down on time I used 2 boxes of pre packaged pie crusts and canned peaches in lite syrup. I used 4 of the smaller cans and the juice from 2 cans. For the orange juice I used 1/4 c. as well as the lemon juice. The sugar I cut back to 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  I also added a tsp of vanilla.  The cornstarch I had to bump up to 4 tblsp.  Everyone liked it because it wasn't terribly sweet.  I don't care for overly sweet fruit desserts and this was a great recipe for controlling how sweet I wanted it.

BOOM! This was SO good..  I did make a few changes (more crust and thicker consistency) but over all stuck with the original recipe. My husband loved this peach cobbler. This was my first attempt baking a dish from scratch and I must say I nailed it honey. Thank you for sharing

I loved it. To me, it is more like a peach pie. Call it what ever you want, but I think it resembles and tastes like a pie instead of a cobbler. The crust is exactly like pie crust. I added the sugar gradually and tasted it. I did not use 2 cups of sugar. Another thing I did was cooked it until it thickened just the way I would like it before I put it in the crust. I used all the ingredients including frozen peaches. So by cooking it before placing it in the crust, I was able to determine the thickness. I would make this again, but would use it as a pie. I liked the dough recipe too.

This actually turned out great for me.  I did only a few modifications -- 1.5 tsp pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg, Splenda + Truvia in place of sugar, 1/4 cup of unsalted butter.

I didn't mind that it did come out with more juice. It is a cobbler...not a pie after all.  However, I would add an additional tbsp of cornstarch in the future.  Nevertheless, using a spoon with holes works well.  And, the peaches don't swim in the juices.  I'd also use 4 lbs. of peaches.

I really liked this and was so proud of the way it turned out.   I did make a double batch of dough after reading reviews and we like a lot of good crust. I also cut back on the amount of lemon juice and orange juice, and only used 11/2 cups of sugar.   Unfortunately, my husband was NOT a fan of it at all. Before I even took my first bite, he told me not to use this recipe again! I was shocked! He said it tasted too much like apples! I don't know if it was my fault for changing a few things or not. He said the flavor was just too much like an apple cobbler, the spices overpowered the flavor of the peaches. I will try it again and cut back on things I have gotten from others.  Could you possibly give me pointers?

Fantastic flavor! I used fresh ripe cling peaches. Instead of using the supplied dough recipe I used an all butter recipe. The peaches I used were really sweet, so I could have used less sugar. It was a little wet, next time I will probably not put all the liquid in.

A very good recipe and BTW you don't have to peel the peaches washing them well will suffice. I used whole wheat flour and extra cinnamon. The kids loved it. I did not double the crust as others did but I can see how some would prefer more of the crust. I liked it as is.

I thought that the cobbler tasted great, but the filling was too runny.

I opted to just make a flat sheet of dough on top.  I haven't mastered the art of rolling dough yet so I rolled it out as much as I could and used my hands to spread the rest out. The flavor of the peach filling was amazing. We used donut peaches. I had also never seen these before but they smelled so good in the store, we bought a flat of them. I baked it about 10-15 minutes longer than recommended t get a darker top but everything else was true to the recipe. It was so delicious! We ate it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

My husband John loved this recipe lots! But I must of done something wrong because when we were getting it out of the 9x13 glass pan the bottom crust stuck so bad you could not get it out. I followed the directions right from the page, it baked for 20 minutes in our gas stove. Can you tell me what i did wrong please! I want to make it again without the bottom crust sticking. Thank you Linda Friend

I saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a try.  The only thing I didn't like was adding lemon juice.  It made the peaches too tart.  I didn't add orange juice  but substituted pineapple juice.  The recipe is pretty similar to what I've made in the past minus the juices.

Amazing! I'm basing the rating on the recipe alone, no changes made. I followed it to a T, and it turned out simply amazing. I brought it to work and my coworkers devoured it. I loved the addition of the homemade dough on the top. I'm definitely going to be saving this recipe for use again. Thanks!

This recipe is a great start! Love the old fashioned lattice crust on top. The best part about this is the pre-baked bottom crust. Makes it incredible! I cut the sugar waaaaay back - I used fresh peaches from Fredericksburg, TX, and it was an amazing dessert. I used 1/4 c. brown sugar, and 1/2 c white sugar, and 1 tsp of vanilla. 1/8 tsp pumpkin pie spice combo, and 1/2+ tsp of cinnamon.  3 T cornstarch. Thick and juicy and wonderful.
I tried one reviewers tip of creating my lattice work on a cutting board first rather than on top of the cobbler. However - duh - after I did it, there was no way to put it on top of the cobbler. So I ended up with a mess. Next time, I'll just create the lattice on the top like I always do. 

Make this recipe!

I don't know anything about fresh peaches.  I bought 3 lb, exactly what is called for, and put them into the fridge for a couple of days.  When I took them out and started to peel them I found that several of them were mushy on one side. Not wanting to go back to the grocery I went ahead and used them.  Not knowing how to properly cut peaches I sort of butchered them. Because of the mushy ones, I added an extra TBS of cornstarch to try to keep it from being runny.
 I can sort of do a round pie crust but putting it in that rectangular thing was hard.  It tore and there were holes so I took pieces of dough and fixed the holes as best as I could.  The lattice strips weren't all the same size.  Sorry but I am not Betty Crocker.
We loved it. It tasted fantastic and was not noticeably runny (in spite of the mushy peaches).  We have pledged never to eat another store-bought peach cobbler ever again. 
The moral of the story: If an idiot like me can screw this up royally and still have it come out tasting like a million dollars it must be a good recipe.

The only thing I did different was I used a pre-made crust and frozen peaches because the fresh ones were not in season at the time...I made some personal preference adjustments to the ingredients for the filling which made it outstanding...my family loved it!

This is just what I was looking for. It was my first time making crust and it came out great. I made 50% more crust than the original recipe and omitted the orange juice to suit personal taste.

I have made this recipe 3 times so far. Once for my coworkers and twice for my family. I did make one change as my mother is diabetic and two cups of sugar is entirely too much, so I used 1 cup of sugar instead. This cobbler came out perfect!

I made this but I am gluten free so used a gluten free cream cheese crust. The filling I used 4-(15oz) canned freestone (they cook up firmer) peaches and instead of orange juice I used juice from the canned peaches. I  thought it was a bit sweet but my family thought it was great just the way it is. I did cook the filling on the stove before filling the crust and did have to use 3 tbsp of cornstarch  like others suggested to get it to the consistency I like. No cinnamon just nutmeg and 1/8 tsp salt.  It was very delicious like the one from a local Bill millers.
6/17/2017 made this with 3lbs of frozen peaches I didn't do the orange juice just used the juice from the frozen peaches and about 1/2 cup water. 2 cups of sugar was okay but I don't see it being too much because my frozen peaches were mixed some sweet and many sour. You do need more than 1 Tbsp of cornstarch I did 3 Tbsps and it was a thicker consistency.

My neighbor gave me a full bag of fresh peaches from their tree.  I used this recipe to make my first peach pie.  It came out absolutely delicious!   My changes to the recipe after reading other reviews were: 1.substituted sugar w Splenda and added brown sugar.  2. Increased cornstarch to 3.5 tablespoons 3. Used 4 lbs of peaches  4.  Used 1/4 C lemon  juice & 1/4 C orange juice 5. After baking 40 mins, Broiled crust on low setting for 4 mins to make it perfectly brown.

Oh yeah!  OH YEAH!  Thank you to everyone who tweaked this, tried this, and shared this! I had a bit left over and it NEVER got out of the kitchen. My hubby came home, toasted the leftover lattice pieces while I served up little glass bowls of the leftover sweetness! Oh, what a great way to top off the evening!  Thankyou everyone!  MamaPat

Husband and kids LOVED this!  I'll have to take their word as I don't like peaches.  :)  I followed "Twitchery"'s recommendations for the pie filling (I did use lime in place of lemon due to no lemons on hand), but followed Eleta's crust recipe.

This is the BOMB!! Made this two days ago for a graduation potluck that would be the following day. Put it back in the oven at the event and it was perfectly warm. Tried a little of the juice the night I made the cobbler and loved it! Zingy and sweet. The orange juice really popped out! I was worried about making the lattice top because I hadn't made one before, but it came out fine. Everyone loved the cobbler! My friend's mom had two bowls and finished whatever was left in the pan. She hated to say it, but she said it was even better than her grandma's peach cobbler. The dish went fast and got many compliments. Great recipe ELETA! I will make this again for sure! :)

I'm still experimenting with the amount of ingredients, but at the moment, all I can say is "white peaches" don't work very well with this recipe.  Tasted more like apple pie to our family.

This was a good recipe. I don't know if I did something wrong but this came out a little more runny than I liked. There was not enough crust, so I think I'll double that next time. Overall, very good flavor!

Really didn't feel like I was making the same recipe at all after all the changes as suggested by others...so...I used 6 large peaches and that worked just fine. I didn't add orange juice.

Very tasty!  I, too, read others' comments and doubled the crust, used a little less orange juice, and doubled the corn starch.  If I hadn't doubled the crust, I wouldn't have had enough.  It was still a little too juicy, so I'd recommend using a little more corn starch, although it could have been that the peaches were extra juicy.  I should have brushed the lattice with egg to give it a shiny, browned look.   All in all, I am very please with this recipe.

Did not like this recipe, nor did my family.    The crust was too wet in the making, after following directions exactly. After baking, it was the toughest, hardest crust I have ever made.  We ate the filling, which was just ok.

this was a good cobbler.  It was just a bit too sweet for me.  I will try it again with a little less sugar.

The filling was deliciouse, but very sweet.  I would cut the sugar in half next time.  The crust was too greasy.  I don't know what was wrong with my dough.  It was too wet to roll, so I pressed it down on the pan.  Next time, I will reduce the liquid and sugar.  It was so yummy though.

My husband absolutely loved this.  I personally thought it was way too sweet, but I'm honestly not much of a sugary dessert eater.  The recipe could have been halved, because it's way too much for just the two of us, but I think it would be great for entertaining.  The crust is fabulous!

Although I found this time consuming (mostly because I don't know how to cut up the peaches more efficiently) it turned out really well. Everyone enjoyed the cobbler an it went extremely well with vanilla ice cream...naturally. Thank you! This is a keeper!

Didn't have three pound of peaches. I should have adjusted how much lemon and orange juice I used because it came out  bit too tart. Also will make again but use a bit more corn startch so the jhies are not so runny. It was tasty though.

This was excellent! I used fresh peaches and added some blueberries. I cut the crust with a star shaped cookie cutter. It turned out so well, and everyone loved it. Served it with Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ice cream. I think I will try it with cherries next time. Thanks for the recipe! This one is a keeper.

This made an excellent peach cobbler.  This was my first attempt at peach cobbler and the only complaint I have is the crust did not turn out at all.  Could be my error, but next time I will use refrigerated crust.  Otherwise, excellent, the whole family loved it.  Will make again and again.

This was absolutely wonderful. Not a complaint but to me it was just like a peach pie but in a 13x9x2" pan. I did make a couple modifications. I did double the crust in case there wasn't enough. Next time I will do one and a half times... double was too much. I did 1/2 cup of OJ and 2 T of cornstarch per others recommendations. It was still a soupy mixture so I used a slotted spoon to remove the peaches and then poured over about half of the juice mixture. The crust also doesn't need nearly as much of the egg/water mixture. I just used enough to hold the dough together. I think the excess liquid in the crust in why others have had so much trouble rolling out the dough. I also refrigerated it for about an hour before rolling. It actually came out just like the picture so I was very impressed as were the people I served it to. Definitely a keeper!

Just sitting here catching up on some reviews,it's funny how they pile up on you. Anyway this is the best cobbler that I have ever had. I was born and raised in the south so you know that I have put some cobbler away in my lifetime. The only problems I had with this recipe was I had to use extra cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and make sure you grease your baking dish well.

Delicious!  We used apples instead and followed others' suggestions to use 2 T cornstarch and only 1 c sugar.  I omitted the oj and used 1 tsp+ cinnamon and 1 tsp apple pie spice.  It was not a quick recipe, but worth it.  I may try lard intead of shortening next time for a flakier crust.

Mmmm...this was just what I was looking for!  I'm not good with crust, but the filling is fabulous.  FYI, I cut the sugar almost in half, and it's still plenty sweet.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe...DH is thrilled!

This is a great "peach dessert" but can't really be classified as a cobbler.   To cobble means to "put together hastily."   It is what southern ladies did when the preacher invited himself to dinner after church and they had not prepared dessert.   I would have doubled the crust but cringed at the thought of 2 cups of shortening.  I also wish I had seen the ratings that recommended doubling the cornstarch or not using all of the peach juice.  I will make again, but with a few changes.

My neighbor brought over peaches in exchange for lemons and thats when I found this wonderful recipe.  I have made it 3 times and have gotten rave reviews each time. When I found out I didnt have orange juice but did have peach mango, I used that instead and it was perfect and not too sweet.

Really good but could not give 5 stars because I made changes in the recipe. I did not have any orange juice but I decided I did not need to add any more liquid as my fresh peaches produced a lot of juice while they were in the saucepan. In fact I did not pour all of the liquid over the crust because it would have been way too runny. I also did not try to lattice the crust and simply placed the crust over the peaches. Flavor was really good and my husband gave it a thumbs up. Will make again.

I liked this recipe VERY much.  I would, however, cut back on the sugar if the peaches are very ripe. My cobbler was too sweet.  I look forward to making this again and maybe making it with apples instead of peaches.

this was wonderful. although i must say i cheated a little bit. i used a simpler crust recipe but used the filling from this and it was great. I've made this twice already and my kids loved it, even my picky daughter whose so hard to please. this is definitely a keeper. thanks for the recipe!

My aunt and I were looking for a good old fashioned cobbler and this was it!  My husband who usually doesn't like fruity desserts like this thought it was wonderful!  I'll definitely be making it again.

So good.  After I made the crust (which I doubled because we think that is the best part), I found out that I did not have peaches.  The only thing I had on hand was pears.  Decided to experiment and I took someone elses advice and used (4)15 oz. cans of pears (they used peaches) and you really could not tell the difference between using fresh versus canned because it is cooked in a sauce pan.  (Thanks for the advice ANITASTANKO  Will definetly make again.  Thanks Eleta

This recipe was good but I prefer my cobbler crust to be thicker and sweeter.  I think this would make an excellent peach pie recipe!

This was my first time making a peach cobbler.  I thought it was good, but not the best I've had.  My parents loved it.I like a really goooood crust, this one was ok. Had to add more flour to the dough it was a sticky mess.  Also I used frozen peaches, which were good.  And I added more cornstarch as mentioned below.  Will continue to experiment with different recipes.

My husband loves a lot of pastry crust on his cobblers so instead of putting lattice strips on the top, I put another whole crust on the top and just score it with a knife in a few places to let the juices bubble through.  He says the crust is always the best part of any cobbler.  :-)  Thanks for the great recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

No matter how you try this recipe, it's great.  For some fun flavor changes try pineapple and orange juice instead of just plain orange juice.  I've tried strawberry and orange, but that is truly a flavor preference.  The crust is perfect and I now use this for all of my berry pies.  This recipe has been a big hit with my family and co-workers, experiment and enjoy.

This was very very good!  It takes quite a bit of time to make, and at first I wasn't sure that it was going to be worth it...IT WAS!  I will make it again, my family loved it.  Has a bit of a "spiced" taste.  This would be wonderful in the summer! Thank you!

MMMM delish!!! I doubled the dough recipe (I like lots of crust).  I was kinda "iffy" on the nutmeg and orange juice but the nutmeg gave the most incredible subtle flavor and I dont know what the orange juice did but it was not orangy so its ok with me. I cooked my peaches for a considerable time longer ( I like my peaches soft)I was going to reduce the sugar since so many others suggested it but the peaches I bought were not very sweet so I thought I better not reduce it, didnt matter, was still very sweet, so next time I will use only 1 1/2 cups instead of 2.  I like sweet stuff but it was just a tad too sweet for me.  Even still was a 5 star recipe!!! Since I cooked my peaches longer I added some water (about half a cup). I used butter flavor crisco.  This was the first time I have made a cobbler, took a little time but came out wonderful and was not hard.  Will use from now on!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

excellent and flavorful alternative to cooked pies.  It leaves the peaches fresh and firm.  I had a little bit of a problem getting it to set so I just used 4 Tbls of Ultra Gel which doesn't change the flavor at all.  I used my own shortbread crust recipe instead of this one for a little different experience.

Very good recipe.  Next time I will cut down the nutmeg.  THat is a personal preferance though.  The crust was delicious!!!  I plan on making that for some different desserts.   I did have a time keeping the crust up the side of the pan.  It shrunk a bit.  All in all a pretty good recipe.

The flavor was a bit too "orangey" for me (but it may have been the OJ I used).  Since it is a "from scratch" recipe, next time I will go all the way and use fresh squeezed OJ and lemon juice.  The dough was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for!  Served with vanilla ice cream....you cannot go wrong.  Yum!  I did tweak a little...instead of 2 c sugar I added 1 1/2 cups and I doubled the cornstarch and cinnamon.  I can't wait to make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe, I took others advice and added more cornstarch, did not want to take a chance to have it runny.  Brought it to a get together and it was a hit.

I followed the recipe exactly but added a bit more corn starch and it was awesome!!  Everything about it is wonderful and vanilla ice cream tops it off just perfect.  It got rave reviews from my husband as well as our guests.  They came back for seconds and thirds!

A must recipe for anyone baking a peach cobbler!  I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  In fact, the entire peach cobbler was gone by the next day.

Absoultely fantastic.

Takes longer to prepare than a regular cobbler recipe, but worth the extra effort.  I use white peaches and do put in less sugar than the recipe call for - with less sweet varieties it might make sense to follow the recipe proportions.
