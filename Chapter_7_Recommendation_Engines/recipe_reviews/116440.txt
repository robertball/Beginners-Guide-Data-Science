This is THE BEST recipe ever! It does not need any adjustments. I didn't have a cheesecloth so I just added all the ingredients in the pot and picked out the big pieces when I saw them. Very authentic and delicious.

I ruined it :( (I still gave it a 5 so that its rating wouldn't suffer from my mistakes). I didn't have whole spices so I used ground ones and way too much of them. It was inedible. My advise: if you don't have whole spices either omit them or use ground ones VERY sparingly.

We have visited Germany 5 times and I did not have any cabbage any better than this.  If you had 6 stars, that is what I would rate. I made an all German meal but it was the cabbage everyone raved obout. Even my wife who does not usually like cabbage said she would eat this any time I made it.

This is an excellent and authentic tasting German red cabbage recipe.  I did have to add more sugar at the end of cooking, however, as mine was mouth puckering tart.  It could have been my apples, but I would definitely give it a taste test before serving.

I made this recipe as a Christmas present for my mother. When my grandfather was still alive, they would have this with thier dinner every Christmas. She said it was exactly like the traditional German recipe and loved it very much. It truly is INCREDIBLE! The aroma that fills the house with the apples and vinegar and spices...it's just the epitome of winter. We will be using this recipe often. Thank you.

This is good and pretty.  I wish I'd sliced the cabbage and onion thin, though.  And I suspect that there should be 2 TABLESPOONS rather than 2 teaspoons cornstarch, since no amount of simmering made it thicken or glossy as I'd hoped.

This is the real thing. The Germans call it Apfelrotkohl and it can be found in every market and most restaurants. Living in Germany for the past four years, I've tried many different versions, but this hands down the best. True German red cabbage!

This was wonderful!  Reminded me of the red cabbage my very German grandmother used to make when I was a child.  I made it for an Oktoberfest dinner we hosted (also used the Jaegerschnitzel and Easy Apple Strudel recipes from this website).  My kids wrinkled their noses at the smell of the cabbage while I was cooking it, but it was so worth it! I also served spaetzle (I used a box brand because I didn't have time to make it from scratch).  Yum!

I was looking for a recipe like this one for an Oktoberfest dinner.  When I was in Germany, this was a traditional dish served at holiday dinners, etc. and wanted to find a recipe that tasted just like the one found in Germany.  This is it!  So good and really authentic tasting.  I used ground allspice in my cheesecloth, but it worked.  I also added a little more butter at the end.  I made this in the crock pot and it turned out great.  Don't mess around with other recipes unless you use your grandma's from Germany or something.  Make this recipe.

I wouldn't change one thing in here.

I wanted to give people a hint if they don't have cheese cloth.  I use a tea ball or spoon (for loose tea).  Put the spices in, close it up and put into the pot.  Easy to use, find, and remove at the end.

My husband doesn't like cabbage but he still agreed this was a 5-star recipe and he loved it.  I didn't have whole spices so I substituted 1/8 tsp ground black pepper, 1/4 tsp ground allspice and 3/8 tsp ground cloves.

Great recipe! My hubby and mother loved it!  I had to brainstorm to make as I did not want to spend $ on whole spices or cheesecloth for this one recipe until trying.  Since I did not have cheese cloth,  I used a paper coffee filter and tied it with an oven bag tie to hold spices with whole bay.  I used ground black pepper, ground allspice, and ground cloves.  For those who have never cooked cabbage do not worry that you have little water and lots of cabbage in your pot.  Cabbage cooks down ALOT during the cooking process.  Also for newbie cooks, a good sized sauce pot will work for a dutch oven. It is basically one in the same.=)  TY Ardis for this recipe.

Excellent! Great way to get purple in your diet. Of course I countered all potential health benefits by eating with two big fat juicy Brats! For the spices,  I used a coffee filter instead of cheese cloth and tied it closed with dental floss. Worked out just fine.

As  a West-Berliner, I highly recommend this recipe, which is almost the same as that which my late mother used. What is missing, however, is the peel of 1/8 of a lemon. Also, please, please, cut down on the sugar and vinegar!!!! I suggest 1/2 of the recommended amounts. The end product should be sweet-sour and not sweet and the taste of the cabbage should still be evident. Besides, less sugar is healthier and diabetic-friendly. Another comment if I may- to avoid the red cabbage becoming mushy, I suggest a much shorter cooking time. The end result should be a firm but not raw, crunchy cabbage!

Sonnst ist alles perfekt!

I've been using this recipe for 50 years, except I don't use that much sugar , use ground cloves and don't bother to put the other spices in a cheesecloth etc. No need for that. If you happen to get some of these spices on your plate just put them on the side. I think the most important thing is to cook the cabbage at least 2 days before serving it. The flavour improves with every day Just about forgot, I add 1 to 2 tsp of liquid smoke to the water. Best to try 1 tsp first you can always add more.

I never have whole cloves, allspice, or cheesecloth.  So, I use about 1/4 tsp. ground for each and fold it up in a coffee filter and place it in the pot.  If it starts to get overpowering, I remove the filter. If it needs more, I just sprinkle it in a dash at a time, but I usually won't do that right away because it gets stronger the longer it sits.  In fact, I think this is actually better on the second day.

wow! This is really a good recipe. When I was making this I was skeptical about how this was going to turn out. I liked the apple flavor, I used sweet apples, which wasn't a problem. The only thing with using soft apples is that they dissolve easily, so maybe add more if you decide to do that. Also, it smells really vinegary when it's cooking, but don't worry the sugar cuts it pleanty. I added cinnamon and a little brown sugar at the end for my own taste. Be cognizant that German food is a little tangy so don't go overboard on the sugar and spices, let the cabbage speak for itself! Great!!!

UPDATE: GAVE MY PARENTS LEFTOVERS TO SERVE WITH THE BRATS THEY WERE GRILLING FOR DINNER AND THEY LOOOVED THIS! Super yum! I REALLY enjoyed this. My hubs didn't like this as much as I did, but he is not a fan of sweet sides or cabbage. :( He DID agree that this is as good if not better than our local German restaurant's cabbage tho.... Not only is this SUPER easy to prepare, it's convenient too! I was able to prep during my lunch hour (I now work out of my house) and then start cooking toward the end of the day so that this was done right as my hubs walked in the door. Other than doubling the cornstarch / water slurry (as is, my cabbage was too soupy for my liking), I changed NOTHING. To make good use of one of my kitchen gadgets, I added all of my spices to a tea ball. Oh, and I used 3 smallish Granny Smith apples (my favorite variety) because my grocer didn't have large ones. NOTE: To core a head of cabbage, simply cut the stem off  so that you have a flat surface to lie the cabbage upright, then slice in half thru the stem and then slice each half in half. You'll end up with 4 wedges with a core at the end of each (i.e. quarters). Just cut out the core (on the diagonal) and viola! - you've successfully cored your cabbage! Served with authentic German frankfurters (not the Ballpark stuff!), spatzle, pretzel rolls  and Woodchuck Fall cider, this was an AWESOME meal! I'm soooo glad I have leftovers. :) Thanks Ardis!!!

Finally the authentic red cabbage taste I have been looking for since I left Europe! I use the food processor grating wheel for both the cabbage and the apple. For simplicity I just put the whole cloves and bay leaf right into the cabbage with a 1/3 tsp. ground allspice and bit of ground pepper. Comes out great.  Serve with pork roast and German spaetzle for a truly delicious and authentic dish.  Perfect cold weather comfort food.  Freezes well.

My family and I LOVE this recipe.  It is so simple and tasty.  Since I love my slow cooker, I decided to try it in there.  I followed the recipe exactly but cooked it on low for 6 hours.  Then stirred it and continued cooking for an additional 2 hours.  I then added the thickener and cooked on high for 20 min.  Perfecto!  Fry up some pork chops and make mashed potatoes and dinner is done.

This was done as a test for an upcoming German themed dinner that I will be attending. I tried it the night I made it and the following day (along with Slow-Cooked German Short Ribs from this site), and I have to say that while I enjoyed it the first night, the flavors seemed to have gotten better the next day. I love dishes that can be made ahead! I used the tea ball for the spices and my Kyocera ceramic adjustable slicer for the cabbage, apples and onion. Used 1 heaping Tbls. of cornstarch to thicken.

Yum! I'll never each jarred red cabbage again! This was amazing! I substituted beer for the water and used rome apples because that is what I had on hand. I served it with Schnitzel but had it as a side dish a few nights in a row with quiche one night and meatloaf the next. I tastes great no matter what you serve it with. Will be making agian and again. Thanks for the recipe!!

If I only had all the ingredients, I would have probably rated this SIX stars.  I had a head of red cabbage sitting in the fridge that I bought for something else, but was too lazy to make it.  I'm not a fan of cabbage and especially not a fan of sweeter-type dishes.  But WOW.. I didn't think this would ever taste this great.  I didn't have cloves and allspice, but the recipe turned out phenomenal.  Thank you!

This was the best German Red Cabbage I have tasted in ages. I followed the recipe; I only cut down on the sugar. I used 3/8c sugar; and because I did not have any apples I omitted them. I did not miss them.

Because cabbages come in so many sizes; I decided to weigh the head before starting; it was 2 1/4#.

If anyone knows what I could use to substitute tart apples in a recipe I would be very happy if you would inform me. Thanks for a delish recipe

Oh My....I am trying not to cry at this minute.  I made this for a potluck but doubled it for Xmas and it is the PERFECT recipe. My house smells like the good ole days when my mom and grandma made this.  I can't say anything except that when I followed my mom's recipe...I messed it up...when I followed this recipe...PERFECT!  I changed nothing and I am German...this is THE recipe.

Very good--I've never had any German red cabbage before, so I trust all the other reviews as to its authenticity.  I used granny smith apples, and they did just melt into the cabbage. It might be a good idea to add another diced apple halfway through cooking, so you do get some cooked apple texture. I did add a little extra butter, and I used some chicken stock in lieu of water. Other than that, made just as written.  Thanks for a delicious side dish (I plan on throwing in a few sausages next time for a one pot meal!)

My husband said this was the best red cabbage I have ever made.  I changed a couple things.  Used 1/4 tsp of ground allspice and ground cloves and threw it in with all other ingredients.  Used Granny Smith apples and no cornstarch at end.  I will definitely be making this again.

So yummy and easy to make! I didn't have cheesecloth, so I just put the spices directly in the pot. My 9 year old daughter loved it! This recipe can probably be made without the thickener (cornstarch/water) at the end, it got a bit thick, but it all depends on how you like your cabbage. This tastes just like a German deli's salad that is near our house.  Oh, and my German hubby says that this is just like his grandmother's.

Could not find red cabbage in a jar, so decided to search for a recipe.  Decided on this one and so glad that I did.  Served this to a group of friends and everyone raved about the dish.  I cooked in the crock pot for about 5 hours which is also a great make ahead way to do it.  My husband is trying to think of times when I can make it again.

Delicious! This came out quite sweet and a little tangy-- great flavor. I used Splenda rather than sugar and did not have cheesecloth, so I left the whole spices in the cabbage. It made a ton but improves with time, so leftovers are welcomed!

2014 Authentic tasting. It is an acquired taste. I think saying this feeds only 6 people is a low estimate. Picky kids only ate a few teaspoons.
Nov 2015 Doubled this recipe for about 14 adults. I figured this was one of those love it/hate it type dishes. It proved true. Three people told me this was so good, one woman took some and then decided not to eat it, but her husband finished his own, ate hers and went back for thirds. I did have lots left over, but people were glad to take home the leftovers.

I had been craving this for a few weeks and was not disappointed at all!  This recipe makes for a delicious dish.  I only make half a cabbage for the two of us and it still was too much.  Make sure you have a GIANT pot if you want to make the entire head.  The apples really set this off.  Mmmmhhhmm.

This is the first time I have made German red cabbage but, it won't be my last. Absolutely wonderful. I fixed it with a Jagerschnitzel, my recipe, and a Hot German Potato Salad, my recipe, and got rave reviews! Thanks for sharing. I  change 2 teaspoons of cornstarch to 2 tablespoons. This is THE BEST recipe ever! It does not need any other adjustments. I didn't have cheesecloth so I just added all the ingredients in a coffee filter and tied it together and it worked great. Very authentic and delicious. Our German friends bragged on the whole dinner and had to have the recipe. My Jagerschnitzel recipe is different than any I’ve found on here but they all come close.

I made this for my German father-in-law as part of his birthday dinner.  It made me feel like an incredible cook when he told me that it was very similar to the red cabbage he grew up eating as a child in Germany!!  Thanks for the recipe!

My mom is originally from Germany and came over here in her 20's, so her red cabbage was always the best!  I didn't have her recipe, but since it was a surprise Mother's Day meal, I thought I'd give this one a try instead.  She tasted it, and asked where I got her recipe from!  Probably the best compliment ever.  :)

This is so close to my husbands Omie's recipe. the only thing I do differently is instead of using the cheesecloth I take the onion whole, and stick the cloves in the onion and allspice and peppercorns. Than at the end i remove the whole onion and bay leaf. Oh and I don't add the apples every time.

Great recipe . . . I have fresh red cabbage from the garden and wanted a recipe like this to make and serve as a side dish at cook-outs, this would go great as a side dish at any cook-out and it is much healthier than potatoe salad.
Thanks for sharing,

I used a quart jar of spiced red cabbage that I canned last year with this recipe and it was sooooo delicious! I don't care too much for the flavor of the spiced red cabbage that I canned, but when I use it with this recipe, what a difference it makes. So glad I found this. My family raves about how good this is every time I make it.

ZER GUT.  I actually combined all ingredient without the cheesecloth, and put in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Then I combined the cornstarch and water until after it was done to thicken the liquid. This is an amazing contribution, THANK YOU.  My husband is German, and when I made this for our Oktoberfest meal, he took a bite, and with such exhilaration exclaimed, "YOU MADE IT! YOU MADE IT! IT'S LIKE HOME!" He then told me how his sentiments resembeled that of the character in Ratatouille, Antonio Ego-the food critic, who after taking a bite of the ratatouille suddenly stops and has a flash back of his childhood, rembering how wholesome and good---and magical the dish meant to him. Danke shoen fuer alles! Thank you for everything!

Fantastic!  I would recommend adding 5-6 juniper berries to the spice pack for authentic flavor.  I had some difficulty thickening the liquid but it tasted great and is going to be a family favorite.  This is better than what my German father used to make us.

Outstanding.  The only change I made was to cook it a little longer, about 3 hours.  This went over very well when I served it with Jagerschnitzel and Parsley Red Potatoes (both recipes from this site).  Will probably make again but in my slow cooker.

This recipe would make my German mom proud! I've made it two times now. The first time I used sugar, the second time I used Splenda. It tasted exactly the same so I will be using Splenda from now on. I also didn't have whole spices on hand, so I added a dash of each of the ground spices directly to the pot instead.  This dish goes perfectly with pork tenderloin. Next time I am going to make a double batch since it freezes really well. Thank you for the recipe!! If I could give it 10 stars, I would :-)

I followed this delicious recipe except for three minor deviations:  I used kosher salt, I used just 1/8 tsp. or so of ground allspice and I didn't have a sweet onion so i used a regular yellow onion.  Served with turkey kielbasa and parsley potatoes.  My Polish ex-DMIL said to always use kosher salt when going for the sweet/sour tang.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I found it almost too overpowering...I think I'll add an extra apple or so.  And, of course, it all depends on the size of the cabbage.   Also, my yellow onion wasn't as tender as I would've liked...so I'm going to give them a head start next time.  Oh, also, I upped the corn starch to 2 TBSP.

Awesome! I made this for christmas dinner as I had to make  my vegetable on the stove as my oven was already stuffed.
I did not use the cheese cloth I just put everything in the pan and fished it out at the end.  I had to use a little more cornstarch to get mine the thickness I wanted it.  My mother in law said it tasted just as good as her very German mother in law used to make so I guess that means  its just not me who thinks its good.

loved it! I did not have a cheesecloth, so I just ground the allspice and clove and it worked well. This tasted great and I will make it again and again... I must remember thought that it is too strong to be considered to be a 'side dish' in the meal... it works better as a glorified condiment :)

Sehr Schön. There are two optional tips I found made this dish even better. First, Take the time to cook the cabbage before adding the liquids to the Dutch oven. This will make the end product the more attractive dark purple color than opposed to a lighter pinkish. Though there is little to no change in the flavor. Another  tip I got from a fellow German chef is to use red currant jelly to thicken instead of the cornstarch slurry. This adds a nice extra sweetness. Overall, great recipe. Best enjoyed with some potatoes and browned Brat or Bockwurst. Guten Apetite!

Wow! Thank you so much for this recipe. The only thing I changed was used Agave Nectar instead of sugar and it turned out amazing. My 3 year old daughter has been sick for about a week and getting her to eat has been a nightmare. The purple color caught her attention and she ate 2 helpings. My husband kept going back for more and it even turned into a midnight snack. This dish has made it onto my go to list.

This is something that I had never eaten, much less cooked, but I was looking for a veggie that could simmer on the stove while I cooked the rest of Christmas dinner and I loooove vinegar, so I went with this. I was amazed that the cabbage didn't get all wilty after all that simmering and the tart flavor was nice. It was also really pretty and a nice balance to all the heavy stuff. The guests liked it too.

So easy to make and delicious! It was a big hit with my family, will definitely be making this again. I didn't have any whole allspice so just omitted it, but it came out fine. I made this a day ahead and then just heated it up on the stove for dinner when guests came. Served with Sauerbraten that had marinated for 2 days and this was a bigger hit than that!

Wow!  This was great!  I used granny smith apples and splenda.  I will probably reduce the splenda so it's not so sweet.  Apple provided a lot of sweetness.  I also put the onion in the cheesecloth so I could remove once cooked.

I tried the canned version but only this recipe hit the spot. This is now a new family favorite, perfect with seared duck confit or roasted chicken. Bravo!

Excellent, and my spousal unit said that it smelled like his grandma's kitchen. I do have to laugh at the instruction to put the spices in cloth, tie up corners and "stir with a kitchen string". Not policing, just made me laugh, picturing someone stirring with a kitchen string.

RAVES!!! Brought this to a dinner party as a side dish for the pork chops the hostess was serving. Everyone thought it was fantastic! Per comments cut the sugar to 1/4 cup (I used brown sugar). Cooked it for about an hour on the stovetop, transferred to a crock pot for another 3 hours or so. A friend who took some home said it was even better served cold the next day. Excellent recipe!

Made this as a side dish to a crown roast of pork.  It was easy and delicious.  The recipe does make a large amount.  Next time, I'll probably halve the recipe.  Thanks for a different side dish!

Great, just like I remembered! Next time I will try to cut down on the surgar (it was pretty sweet). A perfect side to any beef, pork or chicken dish.

Yum. Tastes just like my local German restaurant.  Next time, I plan to use less vinegar and water so there is less juice.

I lived in Germany and come from a southern German family. This is the closest to home I've ever had. Every time I make this people go insane. There's never any left and ppl who have never had red cabbage discover a new love for it. This is an absolute staple in my home...the only difference is I like this cold.

I've been making a different red cabbage recipe for years, and while it was alright, it never added up to the quality we'd get at our favourite German restaurant.  Well, this recipe resulted in cabbage tasting that good and BETTER! I can't believe what an improvement the spices make, and all that without an excessive amount of fat or bacon, which is also nice. Basically, this is my new go-to recipe for this dish ... awesome!

This was so VERY good!!  I couldn't help taking spoonfuls of leftovers right out of the fridge - altho' I did like it better warm. :)   I did adapt somewhat - thus 4 stars.  I chopped up about 1/2 lb of bacon and sauteed that with the onions until translucent, then added the rest of the veggies.  I have very strong raw apple cider vinegar, so I only added about 3/4 cup - and it was still too tart. I used brown sugar and I had to sweeten it more to get a balanced sweet/sour taste - I probably ended up with about 3/4 C Brown sugar.  I only had ground allspice so used a scant 1/2 tsp of that, upped the cloves to about 4 whole cloves, and just threw everything in the pot - picked out the whole spices when I ran into them.  I didn't feel like messing with bringing it back up to boil for the cornstarch so I just used some arrowroot I had on hand - turned out perfectly!  :)  This is a definitely do-over, and go-to recipe for me now!

This is soooo good. Even though this is not the quickest recipe around, the aroma that fills your house while this dish is cooking makes it worth the wait. My grandmother came from a German family, and after tasting the cabbage she said this would be something that her mother would have served. This recipes is way better than any other version I have ever tried and no restaurant variety comes close to these flavors.

Delicious!  I made this tonight with some bratwurst and potato pancakes for a German meal.  I did not have the apples so I left those out.  I would have added them if I had them.  The spices were just right.  I was doubting the clove and allspice at first but after cooking for an hour and 15 minutes, it tasted perfect.  I used 1/4 head of cabbage for 2 people and it was plenty for us and we had leftovers.  I used ground cloves and allspice and just put them right in the pot.  I omitted the starch at the end.  Beautiful German dish.

I almost don't have words for this recipe.  

The flavors blended together and created the perfect dish.  I have had red cabbage at authentic German restaurants and this one hit it on the head.  

I had to add a lot more salt, which made the tanginess of the vinegar and the spices that much more pleasant, but you can do this at the very end.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe, it was AMAZING!

Thank you Ardis for this recipe.  I enjoyed seeing my family reaching for second servings of a healthy vegetable.

Based on comments from other reviewers, and knowing my families tastes; I reduced the vinegar to 2 tablespoons and the sugar to 2 tablespoons.  I cut the water to 3/4 cup and omitted the cornstarch. I followed all other instructions to the letter. I will keep this recipe on my "serve often" list.

Yum! This was my first time making Rotkohl from scratch but by no means my first time eating it. My grandmother is German, and I lived over there for a couple years. With a bit of chopped, fried bacon added to the recipe (perhaps in place of the butter), this would be 5 stars.

We made 1/2 a head of red cabbage and cooked the cabbage first in 4 pats of butter and 1/2 cup of water for 20 minutes.  We halved all of the ingredients and added only ground allspice since we did not have whole and put the whole spices in without a tea ball.  We cooked the onions in butter separately and then added to the cooked cabbage along with the rest of the ingredients.  We brought to a boil and cooked  for an additional 20 minutes. My husband said it tasted just like the Hungarian red cabbage that was made by a Hungarian friend.  We loved it and now we have a new vegetable dish.

Delicious and makes the house smell fantastic. I didn't have whole allspice, so I sprinkled in some dried (maybe 1/2 tsp), but otherwise I made it exactly as written. I served it with roast pork. The kids were pretty skeptical about it, but my husband and I loved it.

This had a good flavor, however not what I was looking for, and the texture was...blah. Having a German heritage, I love the sour kick from sour kraut and I'd hoped this would have that. Unfortunately it was way too sweet and not the least bit sour. The texture reminded me somewhat of baby food but maybe I cooked it wrong. This has great potential but it just wasn't for my family. Thanks anyway

My wife was born in Kusel, Germany and always talked about her mother's german red cabbage. I never tried to make the red cabbage because I always knew it wouldn't come close to her mother's. But I saw this recipe and decided to give it a try. My wife said she couldn't tell the difference between the cabbage I made using this recipe and her Mom's cabbage. GREAT RECIPE!! Thanks Ardis!

Very good proportions of spices! This side dish is a staple of Fall for my European in-laws.I added homegrown/homesmoked cooked bacon....mmmm...The only thing that I will change next time is that I will add less water as I found it had a little too much. Thanks!

A solid 4 star recipe.  I paired this with the Wiener Schnitzel recipe from here - plus a hot potato salad recipe I had - great dinner!

This was so simple to make and very delicious. It was a great addition to the diet that I am on because it is so healthy. I don't normally have cheesecloth laying around, so I put the spices in a tea-ball (looks like a metal egg) instead,  and that worked out well.  Thank you for sharing!

I couldn't find my favorite recipe for red cabbage.  This is a near perfect match, the only change I made was using brown sugar, and adding a more of the spices.. this is wonderful.  I have also often cooken the onion with a chopped bacon first.  Thanks for posting

I made this recipe and took it to an Oktoberfest celebration.  It was a big hit especially for my husband. I would slice the cabbage a little thinner than I did and add a little more cornstarch. But it did take longer than 10 minutes prep time for me. In case you are time limited, make it the day before. I think it even gets better in time.

People, this is the real deal. I've tried many recipes and finally a correct version of what they eat in German homes and restaurants. I didn't have a cloth or spice bag so I just threw in the bay leaf and cloves and removed them after it was done. It tastes even sweeter & better the next day.

Very good. 

I didn't have the whole spices, so I used a dash of each. I used a little less than 1/2 cup sugar, and will reduce it to a little less than 1/4 cup next time - it was very sweet. 

Will definitely make again though!

I didn't have cheesecloth so added the spices whole and removed them after cooking, as another poster suggested, which worked OK, but this just was not the recipe I was looking for. It turned out soggy (I like the cabbage a bit more firm), with way too much liquid (which never thickened) and not enough spice. I'd reduce the liquid by half and use ground spices rather than whole. Will have to cruise other recipes to see how much. Really wanted this to work, but I'm going to keep looking...

Soooo good. Tasted just like my Grandmas kraut. My husband lost my cheesecloth, so I opened two tea bags and dumped out the tea leaves and filled with the herbs, then retied with the tea bag string. It worked out fine. I forgot to do the cornstarch at the end, no big deal it was still very very good. Its a keeper. I served with sauteed kielbasea's and my mom make my German grandmas warm potato salad. I also made the easy apple strudel here on All recipes but it turned out terrible, probably because I did too many shortcuts.

I had all the ingredients in my fridge and needed to cook something and found this recipe. Not something I have ever had before except maybe in a restaurant but this was really good. Went well with my crab cakes. I used stevia in place of the sugar so if it was good with stevia you know it is going to be even better with sugar. I didn't have whole allspice so just put a PINCH of ground allspice in and it was great. I forgot to put the spices in a little cheesecloth so will just keep my eyes open for the two cloves (I didn't have any bay leaf).

Absolutely wonderful! I made this for the first time this weekend and had it with polish sausage. The whole family loved it. It was relatively easy to put together. I think the next time we make it I might add a little less vinegar as we thought it was just a little too tart. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is one of the best recipes I have found for red cabbage.  Equal to what we have been served in the best german restaurants.  My husband loves it.
I did not have any whole allspice  so I skipped it.  It was great without it.  
Tip:  I placed the spices in a coffee filter and closed it with a toothpick skewered through two small holes.  Easy to take out of the pot when the cooking is completed.

I thought this recipe was really delicious. My family didn't quite share my opinion, but what can you do?! Anyway, I will say that I was nervous at first thinking that I had too much cabbage (wouldn't fit in my dutch oven and had to put in a big stock pot) and would need more liquid, but it didn't, it was perfect and the flavor was really great.

I used this recipe with my homegrown cabbage. I didn't have a cheesecloth, so I just put the peppers and cloves into the mixture. I also cooked it in my crockpot for about 4 hours or so instead of cooking it on the stove. Then, I zapped the cornstarch and water in the microwave and mixed it into the crockpot. This is a really good recipe. It worked even though I messed it up. Yum!

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted Splenda for the sugar to reduce carbohydrates. The only thing I would do differently is cut the onion circles in half - some of them got a bit stringy as they cooked and became difficult to get onto the fork. We ate it with beer brats and some cottage cheese. A nice, cold beer is the only thing that would have made it better!

I have never been a huge fan of this dish, however this recipe was excellent! I was making the German Rouladen recipe from this site and red cabbage goes nicely with rouladen. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have whole allspice or whole cloves, and no cheese cloth. I substituted ground allspice and ground cloves (approx. 1/8-1/4 tsp. of each) and placed them along with the other spices in two coffee filters tied tightly with kitchen string. Instead of adding the cornstarch at the end, I cooked my cabbage until most of the water was gone (once it had simmered for around an hour or so, I turned the heat up and tilted the lid on the pot) and cooked for another 45 minutes or so. Very good, I will be making this again. Thanks Ardis for sharing this!

I never ate German red cabbage before and this was my first time making it.  It was very good!  I didn't have any apples so  I substituted unsweetened apple sauce, and I used pickling spice in the cheese cloth instead of the individual spices.  I cut down on the sugar a little, but won't next time.  Great recipe!! Thanks!!

This is a fabulous recipe that easily can be doubled or tripled.  I made a quadruple batch for Thanksgiving, froze the leftovers, and served it again at Christmas.  Make this at least a day or two ahead--it tastes much better than when freshly cooked.

This was really good.  Just the right amount of spice.  Tastes just like you'd get in a good German restaurant.  My husband is from Germany and he enjoyed it too. (needs just a bit of salt for our tastes but that can be put on after cooking) Just be sure to use a large enough pot, cabbage seems to expand when you slice it up!

I am making it right now, it's almost done but I made some changes, I didn't have any of the mentioned whole spices so I added juniper berries and ground pepper instead, instead of cider vinigar I put in balsamic vinigar and because I don't use white sugar, I added couple of tablespoons of agave sirup. Instead of water I put in red wine. It's turning out to be very dark purple, probably because of the dark vinigar and wine but the cabagge I used was very dark and tough so it's cooking much longer, about 2 hours and all liquid already evaporated so I am not thickening it with starch since I don't I don't use processed starch. It tastes really good.

The only change I make is to use a tea diffuser instead of messing around with the cheesecloth.  It has a chain and hooks onto the lip of the pan and it's easy to clean.  Very good recipe.  Also good cold.

This recipe is better than the one my mother makes. Easy to make and wonderful flavor.

This was my first time eating German cabbage and I found out I don't like it. The vinegar is too overpowering for me. If you do like German cabbage, this recipe would probably work nicely.

I had to improvise a little on the spices, and I didn't have cider vinegar but I had some other vinegars and this turned out delicious.  It was a nice side dish for our "Oktoberfest" dinner.

I made this for an Oktoberfest party.  I didn't have whole allspice or whole cloves, so I substituted 1/4 tsp of ground allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves.  I had the whole peppercorns and bay leaves, which I placed in a tea infuser.  Our guests loved this recipe with several asking to take some home.

This was a good traditional dish....don't know if we'll make it very often but when we have our German nights I think we'll use it again.

I made this exactly as written. I used a mandoline to slice the onion and apples. This turned out so flavorful.  The taste rivals that of a German restaurant. Thanks so much.

I made this with Weiner schnitzel and it was AMAZING! The perfect German meal. The cabbage has just the perfect amount of sweetness and acidity to make you go back bite after bite. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis.

Great tasting cabbage - just like Grandma used to make!  I didn't have whole peppercorns so I used just a bit of black ground pepper in the flavoring bag.  I served it with the  	 Sauerbraten Klopse and German Spaetzle Dumplings recipes also from this site.

This was great!! It was exactly what I was looking for.  I had to make a few changes...I did not have a sweet onion;so used a white one, had to use sweet apples and substituted red wine vinegar for the cider vinegar.  Next time I will try to have everything that the recipe calls for, I can't imagine it being any better though :)

Way too sweet and way too vinegary!!!  I guess I'm not a fan of German Red Cabbage.

This is so good!  I did use less water, vinegar and sugar than called for and it was plenty.  I also just sprinkled pepper, 1/4 tsp allspice, and scant 1/4 tsp cloves also because I didn't have the whole spices.

This is such a comfort food for me. It brings me home. I eat this on top of mashed potatoes and make it a meal when no one is home. Mmmm. I did not use the apples, added red wine vinegar and used ground cloves and ground pepper rather than whole cloves and peppercorns (just for ease). So good!
