This is delicious!  I cheated a little, and used a can of fire roasted tomatoes with garlic, and added basil, thyme, and oregano.  This would be great as a main dish by adding chicken breast and pasta.

This was a great way to use up our abundance of squash, zucchini and tomatoes from our garden.  I used a large handful of cherry tomatoes instead of plum, uncut.  Served it with some homemade chicken strips.  Will use again!

Add a sprinkle of garlice powder and top each serving with a spoonful of Permesan cheese. Fresh corn kernels cook up well with this, too.

I wasn't real excited about this. I wanted to make it, because it had zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes, all of which I just picked from my garden. It more less tasted like steamed squash with tomatoes juice. From looking at the recipe it seemed like it might need garlic. I am not sure what else. It does, for some reason, taste much better as it cools down though.

I didn't have yellow squash, left it out. I used a mixture of olive oil and butter. I added a large clove of minced shallot to the vidilia onion. I added a dusting of panko and parm cheese. even with mostly hot house grown maters and zukes it was very good. served with dill pickle meatloaf and mac and cheese. when our garden comes in, I'll be sure to trot this easy recipe out again.

I loved this. Very easy. I used zucchini squash. I also seasoned it as it was cooking. 
Then....  I spooned some into a tortilla and topped with some salsa.
Yum!! and filling. 
I also added a little roasted chicken but it can easily be left out for a veggie meal.

My husband made this tonight & it turned out well.  He used the zucchini & tomatoes from our garden. I added a little salt & pepper on top.  He made me dinner tonight and made the meatloaf that doesn't crumble, beer batter bread and mashed red skinned potatoes. It was nice having him cook and wash dishes afterwards as well.  :)

Yummy!  We had this tonight with tomato and basil salmon (also on allrecpes) and dinner was a hit.  Like everyone, I changed this up a bit.  My onion was huge so I only used half and I used 3 brown tomatoes instead of the Roma (what I had).  I used a teaspoon of EVOO when I started because I was out of butter.  When I finished cooking, I added about 1 tablespoon of fresh basil, leftover from the salmon prep.  I do recommend watching the cooking time as I thought the veggie mixture was slightly overcooked.  This one definitely will go into our rotation.

Tried this tonight and it was wonderful!  I followed the recipe but used sea salt.  I'll be making this again; excellent way to use up veggies before they go bad!

Pretty Good... I used yellow squash & cherry tomatoes because that's what I had available. This dish was super easy to make and surprisingly delicious. I did add garlic while the onions were cooking and I added Italian seasoning on everything. Very good and will make again!

This was really good! I loved it and even my picky son who has voiced his dislike for zucchini, tomatoes, and onions on several occasions loved it as well.

It's quick, easy and versatile. You can change it up in so many ways. I added garlic. You could throw in some parmesan, chopped parsley or oregano. But just plain is delicious

This recipe is wonderful.  My Italian grandmother used to melt Cheddar or American cheese  on a slice of bread and spoon this on top, serving it open face.  We prefer American or Cheddar cheese but you can use just about any cheese. This recipe is perfect and is just how I remember it.  Thank you.

It was fine.  Maybe it needs a spice to make it "wow".
