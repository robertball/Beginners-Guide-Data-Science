Great dip!!  My sisters absolutely loved it!  Our house always has Salsa, cream cheese, and shredded cheese; now we will always have canned crab meat as well!   Only changes I made was I left off the olives since none of us like them and used 2 cups of Mexican Four Cheese (much cheesier).  Quick and easy to make when expecting company or dinner is just running late!

LOVED this! I did change one thing though...I had a package of imitation crab on hand that needed used, so I went with that. If this dip was great w/ that, I can only imagine how it would be with 'real crab'. I will be making this again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was very interesting. I never had cheese on crabmeat, but I was willing to try it. I liked it and the ladies group I made it for was very happy with it.

Very good.  Quick and easy!  I used imitation crab and it was fine.  I left off the olives because we don't like them.  Took it to a party and everyone liked it, we ate it with tortilla chips.
