I chose to make this as an entree for dinner tonight and used a red, yellow, and orange bell pepper. I cut them in half and filled them, making 6 stuffed peppers. I really liked the flavor and especially enjoyed a new way to use the couscous.

We really love our peppers so this was another great way to incorporate them into our weekly meals!  I make stuffed peppers regularly but this recipe with couscous and using the mini peppers was a new twist and fun;   it gave greater options for how much any of us wanted to eat.  They are also great for "snacking".  They were easy to grab quickly and pop in your mouth after a few seconds in the microwave.

We both really enjoyed these peppers.  Mine were a little bigger than the baby peppers, and I used it as a main dish rather than appetizer.  I also used pearl couscous so we could tell it was in there.  Very good, and I'd do it again no problem!

This makes for a great appetizer if you use the baby bell peppers.  My family liked this, and I will make again, but next time will use regular sized peppers.  I did use ground sirloin with this and a three cheese combo of Parmesan, Romano & asiago.

I can't believe I never thought of stuffing baby bell peppers before ! I buy them often, in big bags, from  Costco or BJ's to put in the kid's lunch boxes, and sometimes they start to go bad before we finish them.. Now, I know how the prevent that from happening again. I didn't cut them in half because some of them were too narrow and some  had a shape that  wouldn't sit flat on the baking sheet. So, I just cut off the top  and removed seeds and membranes with a small paring knife. I stuffed and baked as directed. And because I couldn't sprinkle the cheese on top, I went ahead and added some grated Parmesan to the filling. BTW, I had about 1/3 of the filling left.
After 15 minutes in the oven, I took them out and flipped them. I noticed that they rendered some juice. I used some paper towels to mop it off and returned them to bake another 10 minutes. The filling was a little bit bland for my taste, but over all a pretty good recipe.

This was great! I didn't add the couscous because I didn't think it'd be necessary. However, my peppers turned out to be a little bit wet (there was a puddle at the bottom of each one). I didn't mind because I mixed the liquid with some wild rice and it tasted delicious. But next time I'll include the couscous with the beef because I'm sure it would soak up all the liquids! Also, I used tomato pasta sauce instead of juice and it turned out to be a delicious choice! I also used larger peppers so it turned out to be a main course with a side of rice. YUMMY!
