This was my first attempt at risotto and I was really nervous, but I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful- creamy and spicy!

I made this last night and it came out amazing.. my boyfriend said it was a top dish. the only difference in this recipe is that I cooked all the veggies with the meat and I used two different sausages a spicy italian and a something else that wasnt so spicy ( a good mix) and insitead of shredding the chicken I just kept it as is. When I sauted the all of the veggies with the sausage it came it out very flavorfull. This was a very flavorfull dish.. very good

Great flavors but a little too much meat. Next time I think I will add more pasta and scale back the two meats.

My whole family loved this! I usually try to stay true to the original recipe the first time I make it, but a few of the ingredients can't be found in my little town. I had Hillshire Farms Cheddarwurst on hand and substituted it for the linguica. I used one large jalapeno pepper, and took the others reviewers suggestion and doubled the orzo,  and the flavors were amazing. Came out so good, even my picky eater cleaned his plate. Smelled so good while it was cooking as well! Thanks Chef John for an amazing recipe!

Delicious, as others have said there is too much meat.  4 chicken thighs and 1/2 pound of sausage are perfect.

This is an excellent change up from the same old boring chicken!  The spices really make this dish flavorful and the red bell pepper gives it color and a texture.  Browning the chicken is a must because you get those great flavors left in the pan.  I didn't have a bay leaf but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  If I was to make any change at all, it would only be to pare back the amount of meat or increase the orzo.  Thank you for this great recipe, this one is definitely a keeper!

Since I've made some minor adjustments I will only give this recipe 4 stars and comment on the version I make. We've been eating my adapted mild version regularly.

As my husband does not like spicy food, I did not use spicy peppers and adjusted by using green and red bell peppers. I also used two whole chicken legs instead of that many thighs and chorizo for the sausage. I decreased the overall amount of meat and used a little more onion and peppers.

The risotto technique is not necessary to achieve the same flavour results as you can also just toss in more of the broth in one go. I would recommend letting it sit there when almost done for at least 5-10 minutes. We prefer this dish the day after because the flavours have more time to infuse. Also doubles for a nice cold salad.

This is excellent! I used bnls/sknls thighs & italian sausage, as it's what I had on hand, and a red & green bell pepper. Wasn't sure which paprika to use, so used 1/2 hot + 1/2 smoked. Didn't have orzo, either, used risotto. Now it seems I shouldn't even be rating this recipe, since I didn't really make IT! Sorry...but the seasonings are what really made the dish, and they are great. I liked having a lot of meat in it, but I'm only feeding 2 - more pasta/rice is a definite budget stretcher. I will make this again and try orzo then. Thanks again, Chef! I love your videos & recipes!

Tasted great, but I agree with some of the others that there was too much meat.  Next time I am going to try  just 4 chicken thighs, and 1/2 pound of chorizo.  We couldn't find linguica sausage, but the chorizo worked well.  Great recipe.

OMG... the only thing I changed was I used actual risotto instead of the orzo.  It was so delicious. I will definitely be adding this to my family favorites section in my recipe book. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Chef John!

This was my first time eating risotto so I really didn't know what to expect.  I mostly followed the recipe except that I used kielbasa for the sausage and I added more orzo (and I still ended up with left over liquid).  The dish came out creamy and delicious!

Outstanding dish!  Followed the recipe exactly save for the linguica sausage, which my market does not carry.  I substituted the Primo mix of hot and sweet Italian sausage, which worked just fine.

First time I made it, no linguica. Used sweet Italian. Underwhelming.  This time, found some linguica-the results were typical Chef John AWESOME!    I sauteed the peppers and orzo in a separate pan, adding broth dipped from the sausage/chicken pan.   When the orzo started to soften, dumped that pan into the main, turned off the heat and covered for 10 minutes while I toasted garlic/zatar bread.

Definitely a new family favorite added to rotation.  Never made risotto before and it turned out great!  Did not find the sausage, so we substituted spicy Italian sausage.

This is such an awesome recipe! I've made it as is which is great, but I typically use a poblano for the green pepper and and one or two extra bell peppers for color and for extra nutrients. I think we do a little less chicken as well. My husband and I like to double the recipe and eat on it for the rest of the week for lunch. Thanks Chef John!

We enjoyed it but like another reviewer noted, it is a bit oily.  Next time I won't use the additional oil to saute the onions.  I may even use a fat separator also.  The flavor was great.  I did make a few changes by using chicken andouille sausage and jalapenos instead.  I also folded in whole green beans the last 10 minutes.  I served in a bowl and added more broth to dip the crusty bread in.  Thanks Chef John.

This was really delicious.  So many layers of flavor and just really good!  I might try it using risotto rice next time just because I like the firmer texture of that rice as opposed to the orzo.

Was delicious.  Husband pronounced it, "Very Good!"  I  has to tweak a bit per what I had on hand.Used  1 red and 1 yellow pepper. Found I had NO chicken or vegetable stack (Yikes!) so used left over wine. No potatoes so used Faro. 1 and 1/4 pounds of Chicken thighs and Chicken sausage. Cut Chicken to bits size piece and cut sausage in to 1/2 " pieces. Baked with Parmesan cheese topping. Smells great! Husband pronounced it, "Very Good!"

Awesome recipe!! Added a personal touch which I would like to share with you: 1) Added fresh broccoli and mushrooms. 2) Added onions to step #3. 3)Chopped fresh cilantro to sprinkle on top when served. 4) used less 3/4 tsp of paprika and cumin instead of one. 5) Made a cheese sauce from gorgonzola and parmesan to pour on top....MMMM....gooood!!

Very very yummy! Husband AND the seven year old both asked for seconds! We like a little more heat than most, so I added extra fresh jalapeño. The only other change was that I put in less meat, as suggested by other reviewers. We all had seconds and there are still leftovers...this makes plenty! A keeper, for sure! Thank you, chef John, for another winner!!! :)

IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT MORE STARS, MY HUSBAND SAID THIS IS A KEEPER. IT HAD AT LEAST 10 MINUTES LEFT TO COOK, AND HE CAME IN ASKING "ARE WE GOING TO EAT SOON, BECAUSE THIS STUFF SMELL FRIKING AMAZING" HIGH PRAISE INDEED, AND IT GOT TWO THUMBS UP. SO KEEP THESE COMING.

I love this, I used bone in chicken breasts the last time I made this (I have made 3 times) and came out great.  The only thing I changed was the amount of the hot green pepper, I only used half of one, just to give it a slight kick.

Nice recipe!  If making for 4, I would scale back the meat.  If making for 6 or 8, I would double the orzo and keep the meat the same.  Very flavorful!

This was really good. I found there was too much meat. I added about 6 chopped mushrooms. I saw that there would be extra broth left over, that there was too much meat and vegetables so I added an extra 4 ounces of orzo. I also added a little peach champagne to the broth.

This dish as a hit with my family. Some picky eaters in the bunch, but my wife and I and all 4 kids loved it. I substituted andouille sausage and kielbasa for the linguica. The timing for the orzo was perfect. I up sized the dish to feed everyone. Excellent favors and creaminess of the orzo. Will definitely be makin ghtis one again.

I used chicken sausage instead of Linguica for a lighter fare.  I added a bit of Cayenne Pepper to jazz it up also.  I usually use Arborio Rice for risotto but Orzo worked just fine.  I did cut back on the herbs.  1 Tbsp was a bit too much I thought.  It was a hit with the family and I will make this again.
