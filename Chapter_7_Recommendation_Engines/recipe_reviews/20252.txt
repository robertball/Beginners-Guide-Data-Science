Very good! The crust is awesome. If you are having trouble with your crust coming together, keep mixing it. I mixed mine in the stand mixer and it comes into a ball just fine. You will need to chill it as directed or it is a little sticky to deal with. I made individual tarts because there were only 2 of us. I used Smuckers Seedless Red Raspberry Jam and it set up beautifully. This dessert is not overly sweet (yes!), so it was a perfect platform for a little chopped white chocolate (dark chocolate would also be great), but it is delicious as-is. I think this  is a great recipe for any fresh berry or fruit. Thanks!!

I hate to write a "bad" review, but something about this recipe isn't right: how are you supposed to make a tart dough without adding any liquid to the flour mixture? (e.g. egg, vinegar, milk, water, etc.) I tried pressing the butter/flour/sugar into my tart pan, but it turned into a powdery mess. I added a few Tbsp.s of water, which helped a bit, but I still found the filling to be too tart for my family's tastes. Probably won't try this recipe again.

Everyone loved this tart, especially the crust.  After it was baked and cooled, I lined it with 4 oz. of cream cheese that had been mixed with powdered sugar and a little vanilla.  I used strawberries (halved, cut side down) instead of raspberries.  I melted apple jelly in the microwave and brushed it over the fruit.  An excellent, easy recipe.

This is awesome - although next time I would add a little cornstarch to the jam when it is heated. Would help the tart hold together when it's cut. This crust is great!

Easy and delicious.  I made it as is the first time but the second time I had a bunch of strawberries to use. I used about 2 lbs strawberries instead of raspberries and I added about 3/4 c chopped pecans to the crust and used an 11" tart pan instead.  Delicious- I used sugar free raspberry jam and served it with lightly sweetened whipped cream.  It was delicious and not too sweet.

I made this for a special occasion.  Everyone loved it with real whip cream.  I also put in individual tart pans.  It was a hit.

Wonderful recipe I have made it twice so far and no problem with the crust at all.  The first time I made it I mis-read the instructions and placed the dough in the pan before chilling. It went it great, so I did it that way yesterday. I mixed it by hand.  I used frozen blueberries as I was short of raspberries and it was even better the second time. LOVE IT! I can imagine this with different berries too.

I made this for Easter, it was beautiful. I ised fresh strawberries and that may have been the problem...the crust was very soggy. It tasted great, but I threw out the leftovers.

Love this tart.  It is not too sweet, and it really highlights the fresh raspberries.  I didn't change a thing.  I mixed the dough with my standing mixer and it worked well, eventually forming a ball.

Very good! I didn't have 8 oz. of raspberry jam, so i used half raspberry and half strawberry, and it turned out just fine. The crust was EXCELLENT, except when making it, add 2 Tbs. of water so that it comes together. I would suggest using a little bit more jelly next time, maybe 10-12 oz? Thanks!!

I followed others' advice and used my stand mixer and just let it keep going until the dough formed a nice ball - which it did.  I used half strawberries and half raspberries (as I didn't have enough of each) and used strawberry jam as that is what I had on hand.  Turned out great!  I love how easy this is and plan to make it during the summer as fruit becomes cheaper!

The crust is very, very good. My husband just love it! He  almost ate the whole tart himself. We especially like the crust of this tart, just keep mixing the ingredients and it will hold together.

Awesome! This was my first attempt at a tart and it turned out delicious. A few things I did different was use 12 oz of jam warmed in pan on stove and added 1 TBS of corn starch. I also melted white chocolate and drizzled on top for a little added sweetness. Perfect. I used 4 c of fresh picked raspberries. This will definitely be a go to for dessert! Thanks

Made this recipe last night to take advantage of my crop of raspberries. I had to add about one tbsp. of soft margarine to the crust because of our very dry climate on the prairies. I used a jar of the raspberry jam I made last week. Very fresh raspberry flavour. Delicious.

I've made this several times.  It always comes out terrific.  I do use a bit more jam, 10 or 13 oz.  I serve the tart with whipped cream and it is delicious.  Everybody raves about the buttery crust.

Very easy and showstopping even for a beginner.  I drizzled white chocolate on top and received raves.  I am thinking of browning some peaches then replacing the respberries for a great later summer dessert.

I have never made a tart before so I was nervous! When I read the reviews I was scared about the crust but I trusted the people who said it was great-and it was! I did it by hand as I have no stand mixer and it came together quickly. My butter was very soft so I don't know if that was why but it was a snap. Then I did as Lori suggested and I put it in the tart pan without chilling and that worked out great too! I then followed someone else's suggestion and put cornstarch in my seedless raspberry jam.The tart looked fantastic when done. I made a white chocolate sauce with white chocolate chips and cream. I was soooo pleased with the results that I shared it with my co-workers who were knocked out by my skill!!(if they only knew!!) Thank you so much for this fantastic tasting and easy recipe.

This recipe gives a great crust and a pretty good filling. Just don’t cook the jam more than once, it will burn it. Either that or I used preservatives.

This was delicious and perfect for baking at high altitude ( we live at 7100 feet) without needing any changes from the original recipe.  I actually cut the recipe in half and made individual tarts.  As another reviewer said, the cooking time remained the same as for the full tart.  I also added some melted chocolate chips and poured it into the crust before baking.  The tarts were rich but beautiful and delicious...and very easy!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

I added some cool whip and I didn't use as much jam, I didn't want it too sweet.  I didn't have a pastry pan, so I spread it out on a pizza stone.  It worked just fine.

Followed the recipe with one small change;  the pastry came together well using the stand mixer and definitely needs to be chilled before rolling and placing in tart pan.  Only change I made was to mix the jam with the berries before putting into the pastry case - other than that - perfect summer pie, will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious! It was very easy to make.  I made this for a tea party and made them into about 15 individual tarts.  Despite the size difference, the crust baked for the same amount of time as the larger one. I used blackberries and blackberry jam. Next time I make these, I will definitely be adding white chocolate or dark chocolate. The tarts don't need it as they were already very flavorful, but I think the chocolate would really set them off. 

I read the reviews before making this and followed someone else's example and didn't refrigerate the crust. I didn't have the time and don't feel it made much of a difference. Thank you for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe!

Great base recipe.  Love the crust!  I mixed mascarpone cheese, raspberry preserves, vanilla , and fresh raspberries together and then added a touch of fresh lemon juice to the mix.  Place mixture in the crust, top with fresh raspberries and chill for a couple of hours.  Yum!

Amazing exactly as it is written. I've also made it by layering chocolate ganache directly on the pastry, then putting the raspberries/jam on top.

The only part of this recipe I stuck to was using raspberries and raspberry jam.  I used a pie crust recipe I cooked over an inverted mini cupcake pan and I topped the finished tarts with a drizzle of dark chocolate.  My husband who loves tart foods really liked it.  I didn't care for it but I like desserts to be more sweet.  The dark chocolate was a must as it balanced out the tartness of the jam and berries.  I did use frozen berries and fresh would have probably been better.  I gave it 5 stars because the main part of the dessert, the filling was easy to do and everyone loved it.
