I love this recipe.  I have made it many times. Skip the salt on zucchini step and don't add any water to the sauce. The zucchini will add the moisture you need.  I also add a clove or two of garlic minced, with the onion to the sauce.  Great with Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

I've never made this specific recipe, but I do regularly make zuchinni no noodle lasagna, and it is great.  My tip for moisture reduction - salt your zuchinni slices, then put in the oven at 350F for about 10 minutes (start to turn brown). Pull them out, pat with paper towels, leave on paper towels until ready to put in lasagna.  This removes almost all of the water from them. Personally, I like to let the juices from my meat add moisture to my lasagna rather than the veggies juice, so that's why I really drain them well.  very good, very healthy!

This recipe was very tasty.  You can substitute your own spaghetti sauce, make sure it's extra thick though because once cooked, the veggies give a lot of juice.  The best solution is to serve the dish with a good bread to sop up the juice!  Great dish for large group, or for reheating during the week in a busy household. It gets better every meal because the flavors continue to meld.  Just serve it with a different side each night like green beans, salad.  Excellent dish!

This deserves 5 stars.  I'm sure it would be just as wonderful made according to directions. However, I do have to admit I did change mine a bit... Took the advice of another reviewer & baked the zucchini at 350 for 12 minutes with just 1 tsp of salt sprinkled on it. Don't forget the cooking spray or they stick!
Instead of making my own sauce, I just used spaghetti sauce. I also used chicken Italian sausage instead of ground beef.
Added the spinach, pepper & herbs (basil & oregano) to the ricotta cheese mixture instead of separately.  Added a layer of chopped broccoli & cauliflower and some shredded carrot to the whole mix. (I wanted lots of veggies!)
Only used one cup total of Mozzarella cheese, half in the middle with all the veggies & cheese and the other half on top.  Also only used about 1/2 of a cup of Parmesan for the top.  Was not overly watery for me.  A big helping point for that I think is drying out the zucchini a bit in the oven and making sure you do allow it to rest for that 15 minutes after baking.  The veggies will soak back up some of those juices.  Delicious! My oldest son & husband ate 3 pieces each!

I made my own sauce. (Their recipe is questionable: who doesn't cook the onions until soft in olive oil before adding the meat, and why no garlic?? What's with the green pepper? This isn't chili. Why sauce and paste? How about good Redpack crushed tomatoes?) I did use salted zucchini, but I didn't add the spinach or mushrooms, because I didn't have them on hand. BUT..key points: the spinach is sure to be watery as they prepare it. Try using a bag of frozen spinach, and cook it in a bowl in the microwave WITHOUT any added water. The sliced mushrooms are going to be slithery and wet if not cooked first. Use a skillet with 1T olive oil and 2T butter over fairly high heat: they will exude their moisture and then brown nicely. Next time, I'm going to sear each side of the zucchini slices in olive oil after salting and before assembling.

I too was a bit skeptical bout this recipe but my mom said its good try it, my kids loved it!  Also for all of you that were talking bout the extra water, my mom told me to add some rice to the bottom of the pan, so i put in like 2-3 handfulls in the bottom and it soaked up all that extra water! workd great! try it!  this recipe is a keeper!!  I also skipped the salt on the zucchini, and used reg. ragu sauce to save time.

This dish is delicious!  I was surprised it didn't call for a little garlic (which I added 2 tbls), otherwise I think it would have been a little tasteless!  The leftovers are even better the next day...just like the traditional lasagna!

FANTASTIC!  It will not be watery at all as some have mentioned, as long as you follow the tips below.
Changes I made:
1. Omitted Green Pepper
2. Used dried basil (2 tsp.) instead of fresh
3. Used dried Oregano (1 tsp.) instead of fresh
4. Skipped the step of salting and letting zucchini sit in colander, instead I sliced zucchini, salted and roasted in oven for at 350 for 10 minutes.
5.  Sautéed mushrooms in a 4 tablespoons of butter and then drained before adding them to the dish.
6.  Did not add any water to sauce.

This recipe was excellent, and we will definitely make it more often. I used the slicing side of a cheese grater to get really thin slices of the zucchini, and then after salting and draining them I blotted them with a paper towel. As others suggested, I also left out the water from the sauce, and had no problems with too much moisture in the lasagna. I also followed the suggestion to put garlic into the sauce, along with a bit of salt and triple the basil (we had a lot of fresh basil to use). I thought the frozen spinach was strong, so I might try fresh spinach next time. We loved the result!

No-Noodle Zucchini Lasagna Haiku: "Who needs the noodles? When there's all this great flavor! I make this often." This recipe takes me way more than 30 min. to prep, so for the many times that I've made it, I always make 2-3 8X8 pans, so that I have additional ones to freeze for another night. I follow everything exactly, except adding alot of minced garlic to the saute, and I usually make the meat sauce as thick as possible, letting it simmer for awhile w/ a sprinkle of all-spice and a bay leaf. Having the spinach squeezed dry (or I'll supplement some fresh), and thoroughly salting, draining and patting the zucchini dry does help w/ the liquid issue that people complain about. Yeah, there's some drippiness when you go to serve this (and it doesn't exactly come out of the pan in attractive slices), but looks aside, it tastes wonderful and the noodles aren't missed.

Haven't made this; however I've used mandelion sliced zucchini as a pasta substitute many times. Salting zucchini and putting in a colander pulls the water out.

The only reason I give this 4 stars is because the prep time was quite a bit.  Not something you can make in a short amount of time.  But the taste was EXCELLENT!  I will definitely make it again!

This was delicious!  I made a few alterations to the recipe: I excluded the beef, used one extra bell pepper, didn't add wine or tomato paste to the tomato sauce (I just used tomato sauce with the sauteed vegetables, garlic, oregano, and basil) and I cooked the zucchini prior to layering it in the lasagna.  I cooked it on 425 for 5 minute per side with a little salt and pepper.  This definitely helped reduce the water in the zucchini.  The lasagna came out the perfect consistency and was delicious!

So many have already reviewed this so maybe no one will ever read this but...
This was SO good.  The flavor is amazing and with the amounts of ricotta and cheese, it tastes like "real" lasagna. I am gluten sensitive so can't do wheat anymore, and prefer to keep away from grains in general. 

I did the salting, and the tricks to make it less watery, but it still was a bit watery.  When I reheated it the next day, though, it was PERFECT, so I think I'm going to cook it once, put it in the fridge, and then just reheat/eat it the next day.  It makes a lot.  It took me more than the stated prep time, but I made it in two pans, and froze one pan.  The time was well worth the amount of good food I got.  

Thank you for a great recipe!

Received rave reviews at a dinner party. As many warned, it was very watery and I had to drain the lasagna pan several times while cooking.  I had salted zucchini before hand and it didn't seem to get ride of water.  It was also a lot of work to slice the zucchini - I used a mandoline.

i skipped the salting the squash and didn't add any water to the sauce... make sure the slices are THIN(it is great for the larger squash you don't know what to use for) i replaced the 1 cup tomato paste with 2 small cans tomato paste and the 1 16 ounce tomato sauce (i used fresh tomatoes) i just added fresh ones and quartered them and removed the skins off and put them in the pan they cooked down wonderfully.  i did put a put as a base in my pan just to cover the bottom very lightly with minute rice and i accidentally sat my oven at 375 for 45 then 350 for 15 with the foil off and the sauce was perfect!  i did use a 12 x 14 pan and just didn't fill it right to the edges that way it was very easy to dish up too. I also in place of the frozen spinach used about two handfuls of fresh spinach and it was PERFECT and not too rich and you couldn't tell there was spinach in there!  i also added just a tsp of Italian herb season and next time i would increase that a little and drop the table of chopped fresh oregano and save the cost of that as it is very expensive... the fresh parsley is very nice but you could use dried if you really had to if nothing was available and it meant you couldn't make the dish otherwise.  i will be making this again and again!

I wasn't to sure about using zucchini in lasagna but was very pleased with how this turned out. I salted the zucchini but it still came out watery so next time I will make my sauce very thick to compensate even w/ that said it was still delicious !

I made this for dinner tonight--didn't even miss the pasta.  I added a tablespoon or two of chopped garlic.  I also baked the sliced and salted zucchini in the oven for about 15 minutes and blotted the slices on paper towels before assembling to remove any extra moisture. After baking, I let the lasagna sit for about 20 minutes before cutting.  Very tasty and had the normal lasagna consistency.

I made this tonight and everyone really enjoyed it.  I did salt the zucchini and put it in the fridge overnight.  Like others have pointed out, there was some excess moisture in the dish but it wasn't a lot.  My guess is that the moisture came from the spinach, not the zucchini.  Also, I want to point out that I used a standard cheese slicer to slice the zucchini. It made pretty thin slices that mimicked the thickness of lasagna noodles.  Finally,I didn't peel the zucchini, which I think is worth pointing out.  I had a peeled zucchini to use as a demo. Trying to slice it without the skin was really difficult.  So, I found that keeping the skin intact makes the zuke much sturdier and easier to slice. Overall, a really great way to use a large zuke and enjoy a noodle-less lasagna.

This is the first one-star rating I've ever given (and I've reviewed many recipes). Perhaps it seems harsh, but I spent so much prep time (way more than 30 minutes) on this meal, and it wasn't worth it. It is perhaps a 3-star meal for taste . . . bland, too meaty, and I missed the noodles, plus I couldn't quite fit all the layers in my 9 x 13 pan. But it isn't bad too eat. It's okay. But a meal that takes so long to make (and requires so much clean-up) should be better than not bad! I was very disappointed.

I made this tonight, following the basic recipe but substituting my "go to" homemade sauce (from the World's Best Pasta Sauce" recipe on this site but eliminated the water for this recipe). I used 3 zucchinis, the first two I brushed with egg and coated in Italian-seasoned panko and sauteed in a little EVOO. It wasn't enough since I wanted a third layer, so I just used the 3rd zucchini/layer raw without salting but I sprinkled some panko over that layer to absorb some of the liquid as it cooked.  I didn't use the other veggies out of family preference. It was not the least bit liquidy, likely due to some combination of the thick sauce and the breadcrumbs. The two different textures of zucchini was good (the raw stayed firmer than the pre-cooked) but I think it could go either way. All in all, all 4 of us loved this and I will definitely make it again. (My 16-year old who was very opposed to the idea of lasagna without noodles said he didn't miss the pasta at all and went for seconds)!

The flavor is quite good mine was very wet.  I did salt the zucchini and omitted water.  Next time I might grill the zucchini first.

I made this for our holiday get together, as a healthy alternative to traditional lasagna.  Of course, all the "ladies" were curious to see what it tasted like...and everyone loved it!  It is delicious.  For those of you with kids, here's my trick answer when they ask "hey, what are those green things??"  Answer: "They're Shrek noodles!!"  My kids LOVE this dish. (5 and 8 yrs old)

Delish! I added a few extras.. I also used 2 yellow squash,  sliced the zucchini and squash using the potato peeler to make thin sheets.  I mixed the mushrooms into my sauce and added a can of tomatoe paste. The thicker the sauce the better, the veggies let off alot of water while cooking.

This was pretty good...I took another reviewers' recommendation to salt and cook the zucchini for 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  I split it into two 8X8 pans and froze one for later.

This was really good.  My husband never thought he would like a vegetable lasagna and he ate plenty and loves it leftover.  This was the second time I had made it and I really liked it better.  I put about 1 cup of rice in the bottom which really made it less watery than the first time.  I also used Prego sauce and cottage cheese and fresh spinach and pre cooked ground chicken because that is what I had on hand and it made prep much easier.  I prefer more mozzarella and less parmesan, so just used a little parmesan on top.  I have a spiral vegetable slicer, so my 2 zucchini and 1 squash were very thinly spiral sliced and cooked up beautifully.  I used a deep pan because when you are initially layering, it is pretty tall, but it does cook down nicely.  Will make this regularly instead of pasta since I am now gluten free.

I picked our very first zucchini from our garden yesterday and then went on a recipe search. I decided to make this vegetarian so I eliminated the ground beef but everything else stayed wonderfully the same with the addition of a few more seasonings and spices. It was terrific! Thank you so much!

This was very, very good.  I did not salt the zucchini because I try not to use a lot of salt but wondered if it would help with the extra moisture in the dish.  Make sure the sauce is thick for sure!  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  Very good!

We are on a low-carb diet and really enjoyed this dish.  The tomato-meat sauce is very thick--don't add any extra water to the sauce as suggested in the recipe.  The zucchini will cook off water when cooked.  I was a little bit afraid of how this dish would turn out after reading the reviewers who had to pour out water during cooking.  It was a little bit watery, but not enough to cause concern.  Next time we are going to use some sausage instead of ground beef to change up the flavor a bit.

Made this tonight. Awesome recipe. My husband loved it and said he did not miss the pasta. In his words, "you can make this for me every night"! Kinda a hit cause I am Italian and love pasta but with that I  love it when those I cook for are happy. We have been married 42 years. Thanks for a new healthy twist! I did follow others advise and baked the zucchini at 325 degrees for 10 min. to try and bring out the water. I also substituted a jar of marinara for the homemade sauce. It was delicious!

No real changes to this already wonderful recipe. We used Sweet Italian sausage vs beef. If you're a South Beach or diabetic diner this is totally worth a try. Opted out of the salt & added water. Bon Appetit

Best I have ever tasted! Only used water to thicken sauce while simmering. Seared zucchini in EVOO prior to layering. Was not runny but yummy!

Great flavour, but really runny. Also, this made way too much for the two of us, even with leftovers for the next day. I read the idea of putting raw rice in the bottom to soak up the liquid, and while I think this would work, rice just doesn't seem to belong in lasagna for me. Sweating the zucchini was a good idea, but the mushrooms give a lot of liquid when they cook too. Just too runny for my taste, but I do like the zucchini strips idea. Next time I'll likely use some noodles too, just to soak up the liquid, and maybe omit the mushrooms, or at least use less.

I Really LOVE this dish!  I've made it several times and have a few cooks notes to share:
~ keep as much water and grease out of the dish as possible.  Do salt the zucchini before hand, and squeeze the thawed spinach so that it's almost dry!
~ I prefer ground turkey to ground beef, and I drain off the rendered water and fat.
~ 15oz of ricotta is not quite enough.  I supplement with a few T of low-fat cottage cheese.
~ Italian seasoning makes a great spice substitute.
~Forget the hot water; just keep adding red wine until it thins out to a favorable consistency.

Can this be frozen?  With regular lasagna, I make it in 3 loaf pans for my small family and freeze 2 of the pans.  (foil in first; then, when frozen, take it out of the pans so they can be reused.

Way too runny. Although it's full of vegies and good for you, my husband and I ate it but didn't care for it much at all. The zucchini needs to be almost grilled in the oven to remove some moisture. The mushrooms, onions and spinach also added too much liquid, maybe they should be sauted in a pan first and liquid removed?? The ricotta was nice but not enough for the layers. As for flavor, there wasn't any. Very bland. I think this recipe has potential, but needs some adjusting.

I give it 2 stars. it is very watery, almost like a stew... not like a lasagna. I had to ladle the juice out. I was afraid of that because mushrooms sweat.  It was also not salty enough. The recipe calls for 1 tablespoon of salt, which is really only used to sprinkle the zucchini. Recipe also does not include that you should pat the zucchini down with a papertowel.  Basil and parsley get lost. I would also have left the meat, veggies, and tomato sauce separate. I will need to experiment. Sometimes less can be more.. onions and peppers could be cut too.

Very Good!  I made a number of changes:
1. I Used Trader Joes Vodka Sauce and cooked the moisture out of it (so I skipped the sauce ingredients) 2. I used cottage cheese (I don't like ricotta) 3. I was out of mozzarella so I subbed Jack. 4. Pecorino Romano instead of parmesan -more flavor)
It was very good!  I also did not sweat the zuchinni, used frozen chopped spinach (not the block) and 1 basket of pre-slice mushrooms -SOOO Good!!

I will reduce the black pepper to 1tsp and use mozz. cheese next time, and maybe a bit more pecorino Romano.  
** Be sure to brown the top -it is ever so much tastier!

This was very good and a big hit at my house.  My husband, who does not like zucchini, even liked it.  Since I had a jar of sun-dried tomato and basil pasta sauce on hand, I used that instead of the tomato sauce, paste, wine and seasonings.  It turned out great and saved a little time.  I will definitely make this again!

I have made it following the recipe and it is a four star.  However, when I tweaked it, it was much tastier!  Great use for all that zucchini from the garden in the summer.  After thinly slicing the zuc, i bread it in bread crumbs and lightly fry it, then make like you would any lasagna.  Excellent.

I learned a lot about zucchini while making this recipe.  There was a suggestion to salt the zucchini and then let it stand in a colander to drain for a while.  I was amazed.   I recommend making this dish the day before, letting it sit in the fridge allowed more of the 'water' to surface.  I was able to drain even more of it out.   The finished product was worth calling home about!

This recipe was delicious. My non-zuchinni eating husband and kids loved it even with the changes i made! We are on a dairy free diet right now due to allergies so i omitted the cheese and egg. I did not salt the zucchini beforehand either. I made the sauce very thick and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also added rosemary to the sauce. Layered it just as instructed. Next time I will top it with fresh tomato slices. IT WAS YUMMY!!! We will be fighting over the leftovers tomorrow.

Excellent recipe that consistently turns out great. Wonderful flavor and the zucchini works fine as “noodles”. I sliced the zucchini and let it sit overnight between paper towels. Solves the issue of being watery.

I recently had bariatric surgery and pasta is a no no.  But, before the surgery I was known for my lasaga.  I figured I'd try one with zucchini vs. noodles to see if it would be any good.  This is a phenomenal recipe!  I agree that you might want to precook the onions and green peppers a bit before the meat.  But, if you like the al dente feel, you'll do just fine following the recipe as is.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and the taste was amazing.  I also used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen because I prefer fresh everything.  It turned out really well and I'm definitely going to make it again.

Absolutely loved it!  My husband (who is not a lasagna fan) loved it as well.  I followed the other reviews and sweated the zucchini and mushrooms and I had no problem with the moisture.  I also used Prego to save some time.  One of my favorite recipes from this site!

the only changes i made were the following instead of using jarred tomato sauce i peeled and diced fresh tomatoes and simmered it until they broke down. and i used cooked, fresh spinach, instead of frozen (i did use the red wine and tomato paste for the sauce) for how healthy this is it's delicious, and very creative, will definitely make again.

Wow! This is better than regular lasagna . We are doing a low carb diet and this was amazing. I did use ground turkey to cut the fat that I seasoned up with curry,paprika and salt and used low fat mozzarella. Can't wait to make for guests...absolutely delicious.

Seemed more like a pasta sauce than lasagna.  Ended up putting it on top of noodles.

I added couple tablespoons of all-purpose flour to the sauce and it thickened the sauce. It turned out not watery at all.

I loved it, the family missed their pasta, but tolerated it. I did broil the zucchini "noodles" for a few minutes to help finish drying them, as I've done this for another recipe and it seems to help!

Pretty good!  I used about 2.5 large zucchinis, sub'd ground turkey for the ground beef, and just used a jar of sauce.  Prep was longer than expected.  I didn't really salt the zucchini slices and had lots of extra liquid, but I wonder if sauteing the mushrooms beforehand would help?  I ended up scooping out the liquid to a bowl then sopping it up with slices of bread.  Yum!  I'll probably make this again.

This was good...the only problem I had was with it becoming very watery from the zucchini as it cooked. Excellent flavor though and I didn't miss the pasta!

My wife and I are on a low-carb diet and this satisfied our craving for italian food.  I doubled the mozzarella, halved the parmesan, kicked out the green peppers (wife hates them).  I wish that I had bought a 3rd zucchini because only 2 gave me little coverage.  My wife complained before I made this that she HATES zucchini and would not like it.  She loved it and even said she liked the dish better than regular lasagna...wow.  I used a potato peeler to trim the ugly green outside off so she would not notice a huge visual difference and then used a cheese slicer to cut very thin and even slices.  If I had thought ahead I would have added some garlic.  We will definitely make this again.  The calories for 1/8 pan were about 505, 17 carbs.

Very good!  Used zucchini, basil, bell pepper, parsley picked fresh from my garden!  I found it hard to thinly slice the zucchini; but did my best.  Used jar spaghetti sauce instead of making my own.  Next time would add minced fresh garlic to the sautee mix.  Would also bake the zucchini slices, as other reviewers have suggested.  Used 1/2 nonfat cottage cheese mixed with 1/2 the riccotta.  Also used lowfat mozzarella, trying to save some calories.  Thank you so much for a delicious, nutritious recipe I will definitely make again!

I made something very similar to this and it was great.  I used turkey sausage rather than the hamburg for more taste.  I also sprinkled on each layer oregano along with the basil.  I used a low calorie maranara sause and I used low fat cottage cheese and low sodium lowfat mozzerella.  It was delicious, tasted just like my regular lasagna just not as ribsticking I guess you would say.  I didn't have spinach either and I used frozen broccoli I steamed before putting in the dish.  It was fabulous.  This just show you can use all sorts of things other than what is listed and it still comes out great.

I also used a cheese planer to slice the zucchini.  I substituted store brand Ground Mild Italian Sausage for the ground beef. (FABULOUS!)  I used some homemade sauce we had previously frozen, so I skipped the red wine and did not add water. I would recommend a plain marinara or tomato basil sauce if yu are going with store bought.  I also didn't read the directions thoroughly and had added the mushrooms to the sauce, which doesn't make a difference and worked out well.  It was a bit liquidy even though I salted and blotted my zucchini like crazy, and let the lasagna sit for abut 10-15 minutes once out of the oven. Though, the bit of liquid didn't at all deter from the flavor! I would keep your sauce as dense as possible.  I also added a bit of my part-skim mozzerella and parmesan to the ricotta mixture.   This really was a huge hit, even with my New York, Italian neighbors, who claimed it was one of the best lasagna's they had ever had!  You can't even tell that there aren't any noodles! It was a definite keeper! Delicious and flavorful! I highly recommend it!

This was a very goood lasagna, would have given it 5 stars but it was a little to watery ( I didnt add any extra water and it was still a lil runny) I let it sit for 15 mins after it came from the oven and that seemed to help...I personally dont mind a lil juice since I like to soak my bread in it!

I've been making a variation of this for years, but hadn't cooked it in awhile.  We used sliced mozzarella, which makes it super easy to layer.  Ground turkey, finely chopped broccoli in the ricotta mixture, and four cheese pasta sauce.

great way to use up extra zucchini! mine was not watery at all, but I did pat dry each zucchini before layering in the lazagna and I did a simple sauce (from my own regular lazagna) instead of the one with wine.

I had a zucchini lasagna once before made by my sister and it was absolutely delicious and held its "form" when served.   You couldn't even tell there were no noodles.  This one was runny and not that tasty.

Wow! I was not expecting the flavor to be so delicious! I did make a few modifications: 1. Made Homemade Sicilian Ricotta Cheese and used 1 ball of it (not sure how many ounces). 2. Doubled the zucchini due to only having small zucchinis. 3. Had to use a combo of Parmesan/Parmesan Reggiano due to not having enough Parmesan. With that being said, it tasted great. Will like to omit the ground beef next time and see how it turns out.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! We made it vegetarian (no beef) used chives instead of onions, used 1/2 ricotta 1/2cittage cheese, no added water and made our zucchini thick sliced.
We have tried all types of lasagna and this was by far THE BEST!

This was very tasty, but if wish I had read all the reviews first. It came out SO watery, even after salting and patting the zucchini dry, same for the spinach (I used fresh cause I had it), and baking it without foil in the hope that some of the liquid would evaporate. When I went to turn the dish halfway through, I sopped up four paper towels' worth of juice, and there were still two paper towels' worth at the end after it sat before cutting it.  I will make this again cause the hubs LOVED it, and the portions are pretty large for the calorie count, but I think next time I will roast or grill the zucchini first to help cut down on the moisture. I used a mandolin and cut the zucchini pretty thin; maybe that had something to do with the way it came out so watery. I did sub ground sausage, too, because I had to use it up. All in all, according to the Italian hubs, it passed muster by a mile for an acceptable lasagna. It's worth a try.

Loved it. Tweaked a few things. Used dried parsley, basil & oregano. Left out the mushrooms. Instead of frozen spinach used a couple handfuls of fresh chopped collard and Swiss chard greens. Used  shredded parm cheese instead of grated . My husband and I loved it. Also didn't put foil on top. I don't like doing that. Just cooked at 325 and the last 20 minutes turned to 350. Which browned the cheese on top nicely

Fantastic recipe.  Used store bought sauce but added tomato paste.  Still came out a runny mess (even after baking zucchini strips in oven as others recommended) but it tasted out of this world.  Used both ground beef and turkey sausage crumbles.  My 10 year old and husband had seconds and my daughter asked for leftovers the next day.  Will definitely make again.  Just gotta figure out how to make it less runny.

5 Start I made this dish for many house guest and they absolutely loved it. However, I did add Italian Sausage and seasoned the ground beef to taste. Also I added a few green onions to the top of the dish as well. It came out perfect and I was requested to make another Lasagna the following day....good luck Thanks to the original cook!!!

My husband and I really loved this recipe.  It did take a long time to put together and we didn't end up eating it until about 8:30pm or so, but it was well worth the wait! I recommend all the strategies others have listed about ways to minimize the wateriness.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe so I was very happy that it turned out so well. Even more amazing: all of my kids ate it!! I used all dried spices instead of fresh to save money. I used a bit more mozzarella and shredded parmesan instead of grated. I also dropped bits of butter on top before cooking. 
I cooked it without the mushrooms as nobody in our house liked them. Next time I willl skip the green pepper as well to make this more kid friendly. The zuchinni and spinach have a much milder flavor than the pepper, so the kids didn't notice it. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, so I used less than 16 oz.

Wow this was soooo good! Even my husband liked it, and he doesn't like zucchini (or most vegetables). I never salted zucchini to draw out moisture before, but it was certainly a good idea! My lasagna was only a little watery. The only bad thing about this dish is the prep time!

I added a good tablespoon or so of minced garlic to the meat, and instead of tomato sauce, I had fire-roasted tomatoes I chopped in. I omitted the mushrooms but added a smidge of carrot to the spinach layer, and used mostly dried herbs. This recipe seems very versatile, but I would suggest NEVER ommit the wine...it was the perfect accent flavor! Definitely making again!!

This is awesome!  I had a large dinner party, and EVERYONE LOVED it!  I did heat up the zucchini in the oven per someone's suggestion, used fresh spinach for just one thin layer and only 1 lb of mushrooms, omitted the water, added garlic.  It was awesome!

Great recipe, but I think weight or number of cups would have been better for both the zuchini  the onions. I had one large zucchini and had to use 2 pans.

I am a first time gardener and plant 6 zucchini plants.  A family of two needs one may be two plants.  So little to say I have to rely on Allrecipes for zucchini things night and day.  HAHA.  A friend suggested I try a zucchini lasagna.  I searched Allrecipes and came up with this hit.

Yes, it was a hit.  It was a hit with my spouse and since I made an entire dish, I took the rest to work where the employees loved it as well.  

I have a potluck on Tuesday that I am bringing it to as well.

Excellent recipe. Everyone loved it. And for me, it definitely needed the salt step to drain some of the liquid out of the zucchini. Delish!

I don't give 5 star reviews often...but this one is worth it!  

I followed this recipe pretty much to the tee...and it was great.  I added 4 ice cubes of my homemade frozen chicken stock instead of watering down the sauce with water.  I also added some garlic powder, but next time I may add fresh garlic.  My picky husband loved this.  I asked him if he missed the noodles...and he said NO, very emphatically! I can tell that I will be making this one often!

I used seasoned turkey meat instead of the beef. Also used a yellow squash along with the zucchini. The ricotta cheese really makes it. I'm not a big noodle lover and cook for a diabetic husband so loved the noodleless recipe. Some had advised that the casserole was too watery so I cooked my sliced zucchini and squash in the microwave in water for abt 5 minutes.

I love that this is gluten-free! We followed the recipe to the best of our skills (we have NEVER followed anything to letter that I can recall) and used seasoned tofu in the place of the meat. I loved that we were able to use some of the zuchini we accidently let turn into belugas in our garden...you couldn't taste that it was overgrown and it didn't go to waste! Yum!

So good! I cooked ground beef, green peppers and onions and added a can of sauce. I used fresh mushrooms, baby spinach and fresh parmesan as well. Was really impressed with this! Didn't even miss the lasagna noodles! It was perfect. thank you for sharing!

What a fantastic recipe...this is exactly what I was looking for!  I'm trying to cut out processed foods like pasta and I had a bunch of zucchini in my fridge.  I can see why you salted the zucchini in the beginning.  I didn't and the end result was a bit watery but still delicious and worth it to me to save on the added sodium.  I attempted to drain some of the liquid off but realized the mess I was about to make and just enjoyed instead.  I used about two cups of leftover sauce that I'd frozen (prepared sauce to which I added ground beef, onions, garlic, zucchini, green pepper, mushrooms and a ton of spices) and made the whole thing in a 9 in square glass pan.  I substituted reduced fat ricotta, fresh spinach and canned chopped portabella mushrooms since that's what I had on hand.  I had to cook it a bit longer uncovered to get a nice browning of the cheese (about 30 minutes instead of 15) but overall it was fantastic!  I even think my husband will like the leftovers despite his aversion to "hippy food!"

I can't believe how well this turned out.  I sliced my zucchini with the "slicing" side of my cheese grater and they turned out great.  I used ground italian sausage instead of ground beef, and dried herbs instead of fresh.  I didn't drain the zucchini, but I didn't add any hot water either.  I completely forgot the red wine (must have had too much in my glass!) but the dish was really delicious and now I have leftovers for a couple of days.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I prepared this last night. The sauce was delicious, and I can't say that I missed the noodles. But there is a few problems. Some of the zucchini pieces weren't cook through, and maybe this was due to that it was really hard to get them really thin.  Also, even though I didn't add the water it was still super juicy.  This made it difficult to serve.

What a great idea to use Zucchini slices instead of noodles. My family loved it. I pureed fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of tomatoe sauce and I didn't have too much juice.

I was a bit skeptical that this would be good at first, but I had a lot of zucchini to use so I tried it.  It was really quite good!  I made a few small changes...I used jarred sauce to save time, used italian sausage instead of hamburger and used fat free cottage cheese in place of the ricotta as I do in all my lasagna/stuffed shells etc.  It had a bit of extra liquid from the sauce but not too bad.  Overall it was tasty, a good source of veggies and may have even been better the next day.  I will make this again.

I love veggie based lasagna recipes.  For the comment about not sweating your egglpant, as a countrygirl, I can tell you, eggplant tends to be a bit bitter if you don't sweat it.  I would definitely not skip this step.  The comments about bitterness are likely not just attributed to the frozen spinach but also to not properly prepping the eggplant.
Where I work there are several folks who loath bell pepper, so to solve this problem, I substitute either anaheim or pablano pepper anywhere bell pepper is called for.  Pablano is a darker green than bell, anaheim is the same color.  Both have a mild pepper flavor but not a lot of heat.  Either will give you the color and an added kick of flavor.
Add a bit of garlic powder or garlic salt to the veggie mixture and spinach mixture and add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of salt to the ricotta mixture to enhance the overall flavor of the dish. For my personal preference I also add additional italian spices to the vegetable mixture, only you know your tastes so adjust accordingly.

So like many other reviewers, I made a few changes.  I tried both hand slicing and the cheese shredder and definitely prefer the slightly thicker cut pieces of zucchini made by hand slicing.  I baked them with some salt and garlic for about 20-25 min at 350 on airbake sheets and the super thinly sliced ones stuck and burned oddly no matter which height.  I added a ton of garlic to the mix (powdered and diced) and I also used ground beef and ground chicken (could not even tell!!).  I also roasted some sliced cherry tomatoes and added them on top as a garnish of sorts-they were delish! Next change was sauce- I spent so much time precooking everything I just used a jar of spaghetti sauce (prego roasted garlic) and replaced ricotta with cottage cheese (strained).  The dish was an immediate hit and no one left a drop on their plate!

I love this recipe and have made it a few times!  
A couple of recommendations: Skip the bell pepper, there’s plenty of vegetables already. Black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon is all I use. Garlic is missing! I add at least 3 cloves minced.  Add a tablespoon of sugar to make the sauce come to life. And lastly, I always double the zucchini because where I live big zucchini doesn’t exist and I always run out of “noodles”.

I made this for a friend who is recovering from surgery. She said it was fantastic! I followed-ish the recipe. As others have suggested, I sauteed the mushrooms before assembling -- important to do this as they release a LOT of water. I rinsed the frozen spinach to thaw it, then squeezed as much water out of it as possible, then pressed it between paper towels to remove even more liquid. I sliced and baked the zucchini separately to release excess liquid. One other reviewer suggested making slices using a cheese grater. I tried that but the slices were so thin, they literally disintegrated during baking so I couldn't use them. Recommend you hand slice the zucchini to approx 1/4-inch thickness. Use a little olive oil on both sides of zucchini, as the slices will stick to your baking sheet. Pat the slices dry after baking to remove even more liquid. I used vegan cheese as my friend has a dairy allergy. I used a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce, and the lasagna was not at all watery because I had squeezed pretty much every drop out of the veggies before assembling.

I liked this recipe, and the ingredients. The cooking method and time worked well too. The problem I had was that it was way too salty!! And I was very sparing when I salted the zucchini to draw out the extra moisture. The moisture in the zucchini definitely needs to be drawn out though. The next time I make this I will use a method for drying out the zucchini that I found in another recipe. You slice the zucchini in thin strips (1/4 inch on your mandolin) and place the strips on a parchment lined cookie sheet and roast in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes, then turn them over and cook them on the other side for 10 minutes. Let them cool a bit and pat them dry.
Some reviewers said they found it bland, if so to the sauce add 1 small clove of pressed garlic (more if your family likes garlic), 2-3 tablespoons of  fresh parsley, and 2 bayleaves. To the ricotta cheese mixture add about 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.

We had a bumper crop of zucchini this year, so we were trying to find a creative way to use some.  This definitely fits that bill.  It was pretty tasty, and the family enjoyed it, even my mushroom hater.  I did benefit from many of the notes - roasted the sliced zucchini for 10 minutes at 350, added garlic to the sauce, used sausage instead of ground beef, sauteed the mushrooms.  One clarification that I found that could be helpful - slice it the "long way" (down the length of the zucchini).  Otherwise, when you roast the zucchini, the seed area in the center pulls away from the edges.  It seems like a little bit more in the way of seasoning could really kick this up a notch - I added some italian seasoning to the sauce, still found it a bit bland.

This is THE BEST lasagna I have ever eaten, let alone made!  My husband & his friend ate 1/2 the pan in one sitting!  I made the recipe like it says just added a bit of sugar to the sauce.  You MUST let the zucchini sit in the colander like it says or your lasagna will turn out a bit runny.  The salt you put on it really draws out the water and is a necessity.

I made it with bison, instead of hamburger, forgot the oregano, but added other seasonings.  Shared it with friends and they all LOVED it!

Trying it with my children tonight!

The only change I made was I left out the green pepper and used a half pound Bob Evan's Italian sausage and a half pound lean ground beef instead of all beef. This isn't the fastest dish to put together, but oh was it worth it. My husband couldn't get enough of this stuff. I love Bob Evan's Italian sausage in a roll. It is so lean and there is never any fat to drain off. The flavor is amazing. You could easily cut this recipe in half if there is only two of you. Short on time? Just use some good, low carb marinara sauce. Mine dish did not turn out really runny like some people said. I really made sure the spinach was squeezed of all liquid. I could have sauteed the mushrooms before adding  because they give off liquid. Make sure the zucchini is patted dry after salting and sitting. If you do all of those three things, you should have very little liquid in the dish.

I'm a picky eater so I omitted the mushrooms and spinach. Used dried herbs instead of fresh (1/2 quantity), fat free ricotta and low fat mozzarella. Halved the Parmesan because as I was adding it it seemed like overkill. I was concerned about moisture from the zucchini per other reviews, so I salted the zucchini, pressed it between 2 paper towels to dry them out and then pre baked it at 350 for 10 minutes - it was a pain but it removed a ton of moisture from them. Didn't add wine to the sauce because I didn't have any, but I did add a bunch of minced garlic and crushed red pepper per my taste. This is a great basic recipe and I didn't miss the noodles at all.

LOVE THIS - my family loved it - I even served it to guests, and they loved it. I was nervous about it being watery - so here's what I did: 
1. I placed the zucchini with salt on paper towels, let them rest, wiped them well!
2. Sauteed the pepper, mushrooms with a bit of olive oil, then added the drained and squeezed frozen spinach - this made them quite dry. Set aside
3. Whole milk Ricotta with one egg. Set aside
4. Saute onion and garlic - add meat to brown then add paste and sauce - I did NOT add water. 
5. Assemble - bake for 30 minutes 
Let STAND for at least 10 minutes! 
It was nice and solid and DELICIOUS!

Great base recipe. I used the suggestion to bake the cut zucchini for 10min at 350. I used prepared marinara and 93/7 turkey. I added garlic to the sauce mixture, I added the sauce at  the end but didn't cook until hot. I don't like adding hot sauce to cold "noodles" I tore 10-12 fresh basil leaves to each layer. It took a lot longer than 45 minutes to cook, I started at 350 for 45 then 375 without foil for another 15. It wasn't watery at all. Light and full of flavor!

I made this exactly like the recipe dictated and served it to guests.  We ALL thought it was DELICIOUS!!  Even my gluten-free daughter enjoyed it, because lasagna is usually not in the wheelhouse of foods she can eat.

I made this a vegetarian dish by substituting eggplant for beef. I cooked the eggplant slices 10 minutes @ 350 and zucinni slices 15 minutes.  After cooking let it sit 20 minutes before cutting.  I add 2 cloves minced garlic also while sautéing the onions. My vegetarian friends loved this too.

As written, it takes a little too long to make for a weeknight meal and it was too watery and bland.  To reduce prep time, I slice my unpeeled zuchinni with a knife into thin rounds. To help reduce wateriness, I salt and dry the zucchini on paper towels while I make the sauce.  Because the mushrooms sweat alot, I cook them along with the other veg and just add to the sauce.

I used italian seasoned turkey meat and less basil and organo. We like spice and garlic so I added red pepper flakes and two cloves while sautéeing the onion.  It was a little watery so I won't add water next time   I didn't have frozen spinach so I used fresh and turned out fine.  I will definitely making this again.

This recipe is fantastic.  I substitute 1 (12 oz) package of frozen meatless crumbles for the ground beef, and you cannot tell the difference! My husband and I prefer this to traditional pasta lasagna, and this recipe is his #1 most-requested dinner!

It takes longer than the 1.5 hours prep but well worth it.  Everytime I make  lasagna with vegetables,  it turns out too watery.  I did just as others has suggested with the zucchini.  Slice the zucchini thicker, salt and put it in the oven for about 15 mins to dry it out some.  I substituted ground beef with sausage.  I used more Tomatoe paste and no water to make it nice and thick so when baking, the vegetables would add some water/moisture to it.  Also, in place of spinach I used kale and sautéed it lightly in a pan before hand.  I also added julienne carrots for color and crunch.  I'm extremely happy with the outcome.  I will definitely use this recipe again.
Bon Appetite!

Very good!! Used jarred sauce but added sautéed veggies and seasonings I like. I did try adding the rice at the bottom to soak up the juices and that worked well no runny anything and I let it sit for prob a half hour before serving the cooler it got the better it was.

Don't be afraid of using this recipe just the way it is written. It was very tasty and you definitely will not miss the pasta. When (not if) I make it again, I think I will add more of the ricotta just because I liked it so much. Also, make sure you slice your zucchini very thin. A couple of mine were a little too thick and I preferred the thinner sliced bites.

this was really yummy.  I added some sausage to the sauce, because i do that will almost all of my Italian sauces.  I also added in a few artichoke hearts.  I will definitely make this again.  I also mixed cottage and ricotta cheeses.  The sauce was yummy, used it to make a regular lasagna for my husband and son and this one for me since I am counting calories!  Definitely will get your veggies in this one!!

This recipe is good but could use some doctoring to be more flavorful. I followed it fairly closely but substituted ground turkey for beef and took measures to avoid the watery mess several reviewers mentioned.  I lightly cooked the mushrooms and drained the liquid and the same for the fresh spinach I used.  This all adds to the prep time which is already time consuming and I felt the result wasn't worth all the effort.  I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.

This is as good as any lasagna with noodles. I almost follow the recipe but I use dehydrated mix of wild mushrooms and hydrate them with water. I use the mushroom water in my sauce and reduce until thick. I also add 4-5 cloves of minced garlic. I use a towel to get all the water out of the spinach. I also have tried it with a mix of Italian sausage and it's wonderful. I've made this several times and usually split it into to batches and freeze one. It freezes beautifully. BTW, it takes much longer than 30 minutes to prepare but worth every minute!!

I love this recipe and so do my neighbors and family members! Every time I serve it I need copies of the recipe to give out because people love it.  This is a great use of the huge zucchinis that come out of the garden.  I've made the recipe as written, which is good.  I've also added carrot to the meat sauce for some natural sweetness...

It was great!  I used Prego, and 6 oz of tomato paste, no water, but did add a splash of red wine, and some Morningstar crumbles instead of beef.  I salted and baked some of the zucchini slices ahead of time.  I also used fresh spinach, probably not as much as I should have.  It wasn't too watery at all.  I also used reduced fat mozzarella, and I found that 8 oz of parmesan cheese was way too much so I used maybe half-2/3 of that.

I really wanted this to work.  It was so bland but a tad better the next day.  Let's face it ..... zucchini is bland and chopped spinach is bland.  I do have some ideas for "next time".

Delicious! It was watery but I skipped salting the Zucchini and letting it sit in the colander. I'll know better for next time. The sauce was so thick I added about a cup of water but I NOW KNOW that I should not have done this. It was still delicious in spite of that. I used fresh parmesan and it was wonderful. Even my daughter loved it.

I made this today. The prep time took a bit longer than 30 minutes but I guess that's because i'm a beginner. Anywho, it was worth the time! My love and I really enjoyed it!

Made this vegetarian (for no reason, other than I didn't feel like buying meat). Instead of the meat, I sauteed the mushrooms with the onions and green peppers, and I added some garlic powder to the sauce and omitted the spinach (mine had gone bad). Other than that, followed it to a tee, and loved it! As did my guests!

In the process of eating healthier and looking for tasty recipes...I came across this recipe and thought,”I love zucchini and lasagna (sounds like a marriage made in heaven)!” And it was...this recipe will be a regular in my household. Some changes I made to save on time and money...I used Spaghetti Sauce and added Italian Seasoning. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a “T.” 

I will make it the same exact way the next time but I will sauté the mushrooms with butter and garlic before adding them to give it even more flavor. Highly Recommend!

This one is a keeper.  I used hot sausage in place of the ground beef for more flavor.  Vegetable stock in place of wine and cooked the mushrooms in the sauce to get the most water out of the vegetable as I could.  Let the zucchini strain for a hour and used paper towels to dry.  The lasagna was not runny at all.  I did use a mandolin to get the zucchini cut to 1/4' thickness

This was very good - to cut down on the water from the zucchini - i baked it - this exudes the water and dries it out - I also used about a cup of rice throughout the dish and the result was a firm lasagna - didnt miss the noodles at all.

This is a great recipe!  I substituted the zucchini for eggplant and low fat cottage cheese for ricotta cheese.  Used fresh herbs from my garden and the taste was incredible.  Will be making this a staple recipe in my kitchen!

This was a wonderful Lasagna!  I couldn't believe the receipe didn't call for garlic, so I added about 3 cloves & it was not quite enough.  I also didn't have parsley, so I used italian seasoning and it worked great.  My family raved about it... will definitely be cooked again!

This was fine, a good way to use zucchini from the garden.  The flavors were fine, just like any other lasagna, but the "noodles" didn't quite do it for me.  Probably won't make again now that my zucchini surplus is used up, but not bad!

No water. No salted zucchini. Add garlic.
Otherwise, this was spectacular trick on your tastebuds! My husband admitted he liked it more than the noodled lasagna. Even better, now you can enjoy this healthy twist on a classic dish with a slice (or two) of guilt-free garlic bread on the side :-)

I should've reviewed this when I discovered it.  I was trying to find low-carb choices that would cover the veggies for my autistic son and still be satifying for my daughter.  This is the ticket.  Side Note:  You can "food process" any veggies you want in the sauce and no one will know!

My picky husband gave it a thumbs up. I didn't think he would like it at all.
I used 3 zucchinis in this recipe - maybe I cut them too thick. Anyhow, I think that sprinkling salt on them and getting some of the water out of the zucchinis helped them from not disintegrating when baked. I also substituted half hot Italian sausage and 1/2 ground pork for the meat. Slightly spicy and very tasty.

Love it, use sausage instead of ground beef for sure.  I also pat dry the zuchinni before layering it on.  Also, try cottage cheese instead of ricotta, it works!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I find salting and draining the zucchini first works well to get rid of lots of the water - I also sometimes put rice in the bottom of the pan, which is good, but adds carbs.  I use a mix of ground beef and sausage.  I tried using canned spinach and didn't like that at all, so will skip next time or use frozen.  Next time I will use cottage cheese instead of ricotta as well - I really didn't like the taste of the ricotta.  I only used about half the mozzarella cheese and just put it on top to cut down on fat/calories (no parmesan).

I would give it 10 stars if I could.  The husband raved and raved.  I used ground chicken instead of beef and so I added extra salt and garlic--lots and lots of garlic:)  Next time, I will add more salt and a lot more herbs but I know from experience that is because of the chicken swap and not the recipe's problem.  I used our own tomato sauce, added the wine and let it reduce as much as possible since so many people had trouble with a watery lasagna...YUM!!!

The meat sauce in this recipe is delicious and I plan on using it for other pasta recipes.  The only thing that I wish I hadn't done was use fat free ricotta -- I should have stuck with the part-skim.  Other than that, the lasagna got good reviews from my family.

This was fantastic! I did not miss the pasta in this at all. I halved the recipe, cut out the meat, used dried herbs instead of fresh (so less than was called for due tot he concentrated flavors in dried) and egg white instead of egg. I also separated dish for baking into 4 mini loaf pans and cut the covered baking from 45 mins to 30 mins. The 15 mins uncovered stayed as is.

It was light,delicious and my Italian husband loved it!  Plus, it's a great way to use those zucchinis that got a little too large in the garden.  Having said that, in my mind, it could never be a substitute for traditional lasagna, when you have a hanckering for oozing cheeses and pasta.  It is, however, a nice alternative and I would definitely make it again.

What a delightful dish!  My family enjoyed this very much.  I made as written except with dried herbs and fresh spinach.  It takes some time to put together but it's worth it.  I liked it even better the next day.

This is the second time I have made this and my family loves it! It is such a wholesome and nutritious meal. I like to have it for dinner and then freeze individual pieces to freeze for lunches to take to work and school. I feel good knowing that it is packed with lots of vegetables and protein.  Yum!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, I read a few recipes and combined common parts. I should have dried out the zucchini more because it was a bit watery. Overall it came out really good, will make it again.

I made it exactly as listed. It was very tasty and filling even though it had no noodles. Hubby liked it too. We had plenty left over which I froze.  Will make it again.

Loved this!  Perfect for this low-carb family!  I did subtract on the mushrooms and spinach, there’s no way my family would have gone for that. . I would, if it was for me!  Kids loved the zucchini, bonus for me!

I thought this was kind of bland.  Salt helped so I'll add some to the meat mixture next time.  It's certainly not a bad recipe.

I will be making this again! I'm allergic to eggs so I just skipped the ricotta mixture and used a bunch of leftover shredded cheeses that I had in my fridge. I skipped the peppers, and I used fresh spinach. It came out great!

It was delicious! My husband loved it too. I used ground chicken instead of the ground beef. Did not miss the noodles. I was nervous it might turn out watery; I followed the directions and was happily surprised that it didn't. You will not be disappointed if you try this. I am going to make this without the meat for my vegetarian daughter.

Great recipe, I did modify it a little bit. For starters seeing that it was so much prep, I went ahead and doubled it and have placed a 2nd one in my freezer. I also increased the amount of ground beef. It called for 1 pound per recipe and I upped it to 1.5 pounds per recipe. Also, the quantity of zucchini used was way off for me. I sliced mine quite thin and used 9 zucchini between both recipes so 4.5 zucchini’s per recipe (they said to only use 2 per recipe but that wouldn’t work). I precooked my mushrooms and drained the liquid as someone else recommended to reduce the excess amount of liquid. I also used red pepper instead of green to give it a more Italian and less chili taste and finally, I added 1 clove of crushed garlic to each recipe.

Delicious. I used Italian sausage rather than ground beef and it was perfect. I baked the zucchini first to eliminate water. Used jarred sauce with mushrooms rather than fresh mushrooms. Skipped the water and added FRESH spinach to the ricotta to reduce moisture. Perfect .

I have made this several times exactly as the recipe states, which is five stars.  Lately I have begun to use two pounds of meat, not one. I use a pound of ground beef and a pound of sweet Italian sausage. Also, in the video, she notes that you should pre-cook the mushrooms, which I do. Lastly, I think it could use a bit more ricotta.

I made it with cottage cheese and used Hunts Pasta sauce instead of  tomato sauce. More favor. I also added Parmesan grated cheese mixed with the mozzarella on top.

Definitely add garlic! Forget adding extra water. It won’t need it. If your sauce is too thick, add an additional splash of wine.

Great concept and I really just wanted some guidelines. I wish I had read these other reviews before cooking, because mine definitely turned out pretty watery and I will be sure to pre-cook the salted zucchini next time. I would also recommend peeling your zucchini first, especially for bigger squash. I used a monster of a zucchini (about 4 inches across and 15 inches long), and the center of the slices got soft, but the peel remained very tough and was almost impossible to bite through in some places. 

Used a store-bought sauce and it still tasted delicious. Overall great concept, I just didn't want to go to the effort of a homemade sauce this time. Still felt nice to get my veggies in with this recipe, and a great use of all the zucchini from my garden!

I used my homemade sauce, baked the zucchini slices 15 minutes, sauteed the mushrooms first, and ended up adding uncooked lasagna noodles as a layer with the zucchini.  Why?  It wasn't my intention but I needed a heartier dish for the men in my family that night.  Turned out very well.

Real good. I used fresh herbs. Sautéed the mushrooms and drained. Did not salt the zucchini so added sea salt to meat sauce.  Took the 9x 13 Pyrex to the max. Plan on 1 plus hours for prep and clean up.

Delicious! Didn't use bell pepper because it just didn't sound good to me in this. And didn't want to buy spinach, when I had kale. So sautéed a little kale to substitute, but went light since it's a stronger flavor than spinach. Spiced up the sauce a little to my liking. Very good meal that you can feel better about eating. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I soaked zucchini slices (I used a mandolin to cut circles) in salted cold water. Worked like a charm- no excess water and made a multi layer of zucchini in the middle: meat, sauce, cheese spinach mixture, zucchini, meat, sauce, cheese mixture. I made the meat separate from the sauce to make sure residual fat was drained. I alway bake my lasagna 2x - once after making and then again on the day I serve.

I didn't add spinach and put the mushrooms in the meat sauce with sausage (roasted and sliced thin). The beef I made into meatballs for better flavor, sliced for the sauce. Great hint about salting the zucchini! I probably patted them to soak up the liquid about three times before I wanted to attempt to use them. Now I know it won't be runny. I made the sauce the day before and reduced it so it was good and thick for the lasagna.

I will experiment with drying the zuccinni first to see if it is less runny.  Also, it tended to be a little more salty than I am used to.  It tasted fantastic!

This was an amazing no noodle lasagna!!  My whole family loved it.  I added garlic to the meat while it was cooking and the sauce afterwards. I also used red wine vinegar instead of red wine. Such a great dish!  It's going in our family favorites!

Delicious! Used ground turkey, halved the tomato sauce and tomato paste, used chicken broth instead of wine, added garlic and swiss cheese, used dried spices and added extra oregano and basil. Lastly, bumped the oven temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes to get a brown cheese crust on top.

I will make again.
Used my homemade canned pasta sauce. Zucchini needs to be precooked to get moisture out. Eliminated mushrooms as my hubby doesn't care for them. Can be easily adapted to personal preferences. Next time I will use mild Italian sausage for a flavor chance. Great recipe for diabetics!

This turned out great and was not watery at all, though I did make a couple of changes use half ground pork/half burger, added garlic cloves, used fresh spinach (maybe that's why not too watery).  It was yummy !!

This dish was absolutely delicious!!  I did use 1 and a half pounds of ground beef instead of just a pound. I also added another 8oz can of tomato sauce and used 1 can of tomato paste. I also cut the spinach down to a 12 oz bag.  For a no noodle lasagna, this one is a keeper in my house!  And believe me, we love our pasta.

As I worked on the zucchini throughout the day I thought. This is way too much work and I’ll never do this again. BUT, then we eat it and it is hands down the best way to make lasagna. It was so yummy and the consistency was perfect ( not like when I make traditional lasagna. Absolutely loved this. Need to buy a mandolin to make the zucchini slicing easier.

Cut the zucchini into 1/4 sized round pieces and just layered  them out, did not overlap. Did not use the mushrooms, spinach or the peppers but added yellow squash and ground sausage. Used jar pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese. No need to get real fancy with this. It was awesome. Cutting slits in the foils helps the water evaporate while cooking.

Great recipe!  Time-consuming to make, but worth every minute!  Healthy and low carb (Ketogenic diet and gluten-free friendly!)  Can be made ahead for company and a great use for your over-abundance of fresh zucchini.  You don't notice the missing noodles!

Really great. I grilled the zucchini to get the water out and give a little extra flavor. Cooked the shrooms to also dry them out some. Added red pepper flakes and a ton of garlic and fennel seeds. Outstanding. My husband to,d. E I have to make this again!

I used fresh spinach cause that's what I had in the fridge, and I didn't use a whole pound of mushrooms. Instead of fresh spices, I used dried Italian Spice, which is a combination of bails, oregano and a few others in the sauce.

Made this whole thing in my Ninja Foodi.  Used 1/2 Hot Spicy Italian Sausage and 1/2 lean ground beef.  Forgot to cook the spinach ahead so had to leave it out and had no mushrooms.  Instead of using grated mozza I used grated Italian style chs blend.  In a spring form pan I pressure cooked 25 min, natural release 10 min then quick release, then broiled 6-7 minutes.  Will deffinitely cook this again but cook spinach 1st step and let drain while I do the hamburger and sauce.

Used ground turkey and zucchini noodles (salted & drained, but uncooked) which worked fine. But next time I will use two packages of the noodles, instead of just one.  Only problem was that it was a tad watery. Will make the sauce thicker and the noodles and spinach drier next time.

This is awesome! My husband saw me making it and said there was no way he was eating it. Well he ate his words and lots of lasagna-2 nights in a row! He also sent some home with a friend of mine for her husband for dinner after she ate with us! I did follow the suggestion to pre-bake the zucchini. I may have also used a bit more wine since I didn’t measure and added more after tasting. And a little more mozzarella.

Even though this has alot of ingredients  (I only added 2 thinly sliced garlic (we love garlic) & I omitted parsley [I just forgot to add] & added an extra small zucchini because I didn't want to waste it), this was outstanding!  I followed the whole recipe including salting the zucchini & didn't add extra water...like sauce thick.  Had to hold over for next day, but WOW, I think even better prob holding over!  Reheats great!

The recipe turned out really well.  Made it the day before and then put in fridge.  I combined the ricotta with the chopped spinach.  Also did sauté the onions and some crushed garlic before adding the sliced mushrooms, and diced bell peppers and then added the ground turkey (instead of ground beef).  Then completed the sauce with the tomato paste and sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this lasagna recently as I had an abundance of zucchini and spinach in my garden.  Had a guest for dinner and everyone really enjoyed it.  I will definitely make it again.

A lot of liquid despite salting, draining, and heating in the oven the zucchini. The flavors were good. I wanted it vegetarian so I left out the meat. Next time I will try adding the rice or perhaps some barley to the bottom of the pan. Followed the rest of the recipe as stated. J David

My husband and I both enjoyed this but I will make some changes the next time because this turned out a little dry.  I was so worried that it would be too liquid that I salted and then also baked the zucchini "noodles" and as a vegetarian left out the meat.  Next time I will use a bottled sauce and add 2-3 Beyond Meat burgers, crumbled and lightly cooked, to the sauce.  I  baked this in a 15 x 11 dish because I was not sure that my 9x13 qualified as "deep dish."  I kept other ingredients the same except using only half the recommended Parmesan.

This was excellent. The only change I made was used Italian sausage instead of ground beef for the added Italian kick. The seasonings was perfect using low sodium tomato products. I could have eaten the whole pan in one sitting. Will definitely make again and again.

Excellent, as on low carb diet. Substituted eggplant as had no zucchini on hand. Peeled the eggplant as sometimes the skin is a bit tough, and to make certain my husband couldn't identify it!

This recipe is delicious! It is packed with fresh vegetables and easy to ensemble. There are no carbs yet it is filling and satisfying. We added garlic bread one night and the next day, because the recipe made so much, we cooked some pasta to go with it. I forgot the red wine so I imagine it would be even better if I had added that! In addition. I substituted ground turkey for ground beef which I think tastes just as good. I look forward to making this for company next time. I know it will be a big hit!

Let's start with FOLLOW the recipe...sometime zucchini has a lot.of.moisture in it and sometimes it does not but.leaving it to dry is good either way....this is the first time I made it and enjoyed it but for those who do not seem to understand it's lasagna....it takes time....every lasagna does so either set aside the time or grab you zoodler and make spaghetti and meatballs instead...thanks for sharing I enjoyed it.

After reading some of the reviews. I put the zucchini slices in the oven at 350° at 10 minutes. Took all the water out. I also added garlic to it as well.  Hands down  it is delicious !!!

This is a tasty recipe but does contain a lot of liquid, even if the zucchini is sliced thin, salted and pre-baked as recommended on this site.  I squeezed out the spinach super well but still found it a little watery in the end.

I used ground chicken with ground chuck and added grated carrots to the mix of onions and peppers.  I substituted cayenne pepper for the black pepper.  The 14 hands wine gave a nice peppery taste as well to the sauce

It has a slightly watery texture, next time I will bake the courgettes in the oven to dry them first - more like dry lasagne sheet, and slice them as thin as crisps. Loved the green peppers added.
Very delicious otherwise!

I’ve grown so much zucchini in my garden this summer and was desperate for ways to make my veggies “stretch” besides traditional zucchini bread. This was a great recipe to do this with. I did make this in 3 glass  bread pans so I could have one pan for my family of four and freeze the other two.  I can’t wait to eat this again.

Fabulous low carb meal! Easy and quick dinner! You would never know Zucchini was in this dish.
The only thing I neglected to do was let the Zucchini sit in salt to remove the water content, this must be done as the 1st one I made was full of liquid! Follow directions, I didn't want the added salt but it is a must.

Good recipe. Salting the zucchini is an important step as it helps remove moisture - zucchini has a LOT of water in it. I do the same when using eggplant. After 30 minutes, I wipe off the salt, spray with EVOO and place on a baking pan and bake 10-12 minutes at 375. Now it’s ready to assemble with your other lasagna ingredients. I agree with another reviewer - what’s with the green pepper? Not for me. Someone recommended using frozen spinach, don’t do it, way too watery. Buy fresh and just layer it in your pan, the heat and moisture from the dish is enough to cook it down and it won’t be watery. DO add some gently sautéed garlic, don’t brown it, it will turn bitter.

I don't think it is necessary to give all the prep to zucchini.  The taste is identical if you just use layers of sliced rounds of zucchini.  The the flavor is good and I didn't miss the noodles.

I made this recipe in the past on my own and it was a watery mess. This recipe gave me a flavorful lasagna that was so good I didn't miss the noodles at all. I removed the bell pepper & added sausage and heaping spoons of minced garlic. I drained the zucc by salting then laying on paper towel. Came out perfect....Also I just wrote the recipe down for my mom. We all loved it.

I am on Keto and really loved this recipe.  Changes I made:  Used cottage cheese simply because I didn't have ricotta...still tasted great.  Add lots of garlic.  Baked the zucchini and spinach at 200 for  30 minutes to dry up the water.  Added more vegetables ie: cauliflower and carrots.  Used lean ground turkey instead of hamburger.It was wonderful.  Even my adult son who never liked my "healthy" cooking loved it. You can put your own twist on this and it will be great.

I made this today and it came out great ! I followed the tips to pre cook the zucchini ten minutes  in the oven to dry it out and also to precook/sauté  the mushrooms to lesson the liquid .  It was still very moist and I think I may even put rice in the bottom of the pan next time to soak up some of the  liquid .  All in all a great recipe for veggies .

This was a great recipe. I used steamed chopped kale in place of the spinach. It wasn’t watery at all. My only complaint was the prep time was a little more than I like, and I didn’t see the point of the tomato paste as much. Otherwise, it was a big hit. We loved it!

I have never seen an Italian recipe that does not include garlic, until now.  So, for a more authentic flavor, I added 3-cloves.
I will adjust my ingredients on the next one.  But this recipe was a good place to start

This was very good. It makes a lot and freezes well. I took the advice of other raters about not adding more water, pre-baking the zucchini with salt, and adding garlic. The only reason for the four stars is if I had made it according to the actual recipie it would have been a bit bland and soggy. Other than this it’s a fabulous recipie and I accoreixate it!

I’ve made this quite a few times now, and make large batches for freezing. Not sure how total time is ever 1.5 hrs as prep usually takes me about an hour minimum. I add garlic, eliminate wine and add the spinach to the ricotta for one less assembly step. I also don’t add water and don’t salt/dry out zucchini prior. Tastes fabulous every time!

Yummy! Great alternative for noodles. I used a jar of pre-prepared spaghetti sauce and turned out delicious. I also have Celiac Disease and this was much tastier than gluten free noodles.

I’m vegetarian so I took out the meat and subbed in regular pasta sauce with the veggies instead of making my own sauce to save time. It was good but needed garlic. The directions also need to be more specific with how to slice the zucchini as I think a mandoline or the slicing side of a cheese grater might make that part of the process faster and cleaner. Also the amount of water from the ingredients could be improved.

I enjoyed the basics of this recipe. I substituted a few things and added a few things according to my liking. First, I used yellow squash. I wish I listened to some other reviews for not adding salt on the squash.  As for the meat sauce, I boiled the ground beef in a small saucepan with about 4-5 cups of water (no seasoning)  and let it cook down for about 30-45min. In another pan, I sautéed onions, peppers, smashed garlic, scallions and a spice mix of ground cloves, chicken bouillon flavoring and garlic salt and added the ground beef to that. Sautéed them all together; then added the tomato paste and some chicken stock to make the sauce. I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving day so I had plenty of other things to keep me busy while the meat was boiling. I know my method might be too long for a regular night's meal but it was worth it.

This was so delicious and my family didn't even miss the noodles.  To make the recipe a little quicker, I did use a good quality jarred sauce that was sugar free.  I also used italian sausage.  This will be a recipe I use again.

Taste great! I used my favorite jar sauce and I also put the sliced zucchini in the oven for 10 minutes on 350 before layering to get some of the moisture out after reading reviews. With those few adjustments this recipe was awesome. My teenage daughter loved it so I am happy.

Excellent recipe and idea.  I did goose up the sauce with a lot of garlic and some sage, but overall a really good dish.  And here’s a tip, for what it’s worth...for making uniform and easy lengthwise slices of the zucchini, try using a wire cheese slicer.  Makes things a ton easier.

Despite the questionable inclusion of green bell pepper and lack of garlic, I really like this dish.  I sauteed the mushrooms and "sweated" the zucchini with salt and added an extra 1/8 cup of wine and it tastes great.  The consistency is perfect.  Will make again, but will saute 3 cloves of garlic with the onion and add more salt.  I don't mind the green bell pepper even though, really, I would not think it belongs in lasagna.  I do miss real noodles but if I have to do without this recipe is a good one.

Great recipe!  I add garlic powder or real garlic &  1/4 cup parmesan  to the ricotta cheese,  I do not use green peppers in any sauces.  I like laying out all the zucchini and salt for 20 minutes wiping the water off this is a great step, even with a thick sauce.  Add 1/4-third more meat and more  sauce I make large casserole 12 nice pieces !  Often use a sauce that I’ve me and had in the freezer, etc.

It was a little too soupy, and that was even without the egg.  It was very tasty with hot sausage instead of ground beef.

I did everything almost exactly...didn’t add mushrooms (personal preference) added a dash of red pepper flakes for a tad bit of heat! I added roughly a half cup- 2/3 cup of water to sauce because it was so thick. I also used more tomato paste because I had 2 small cans and didn’t feel like measuring out for 1 cup. I followed one of the reviews about cooking the zoodles on a pan for 12-15 minutes and dried out on paper towel before assembling the lasagna. It turned out delish! Oh I added fresh minced garlic and only had dried seasoning (basil, oregano) I used an entire 8oz bag of mozzarella per layer (2). What a great dish! I’m eating the leftovers today for lunch.

Thank you for this!  Had the neighbors over and everyone went back for more.  The guys even said you don't miss the pasta. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen but that was the only change I made.  Next time I will add Italian sausage but it's great just like this.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!  I will definitely be making it again.  Of course I doubled up on the recipe because I have 6 children, a husband, a mother and a sister that I make dinner for.   It made 2 large trays and the best part was the next day when we went to eat leftovers (if you could call it that.) it wasn’t dry and it packed even more flavor than the night before.

The zucchini made this the best lasagna I've ever ate. I even left out the cheeses other than mozzerella to keep the calories down and I left out spinach because I didn't think the grandkids would like the spinach and I used spaghetti sauce with mushrooms and garlic.  I think the zucchini gives it much more flavor than lasagna pasta which has no flavor. The next time I will use ground turkey to keep calories down even more. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

We loved it! I did add quite a bit of minced garlic and minced onion in addition to the chopped onion because we love both; the only other thing I would change is next time I will only use the inner thin slices of the zucchini . If I was supposed to peel it, it didn't say so and I didn't. The outside slices were tough, because of the peel.

Will definitely make again!  This stuff tasted amazing, and was a fantastic low-carb alternative to traditional, noodle lasagna.  We left out mushrooms and basil, and used three stalks of zucchini instead of just 2.

I love this recipe! I've been trying to up my veggie intake, and my husband eats low carb, so this makes both of us very happy! I use a mandolin to get the zucchini slices nice and thin.  Also, I added some garlic to the sauce and Italian seasoning.

Delicious recipe!! I appreciate all the comments that have helped me modify it.
I sprinkle the zuccini with salt and let it sit (tried baking method as well I think either works), I sauteed mushrooms separately in a little bit of butter, used fresh spinach, used 2 tsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried oregano, used a tomato sauce that already has garlic/basil/oregano flavor, 1 tablespoon of paste, and added 2 garlic cloves to my onion/pepper sautee. Amazing!

This recipe was fabulous!!  There were three changes; I used white wine, because I did not have any red wine, and I forgot to use mushrooms.  I also did not use "meat."  I used three Boca Burgers ground up and mixed into the recipe.  No one could tell the difference.   They could not believe this was a meatless dish. This recipe was gone the same day!!  Excellent!!

Used mild italian sausage for the meat sauce, and italian seasoning instead of much of the seasonings as it's what i had on hand, but was delicious. Love that it leaves plenty of left overs to have for lunch throughout the week.

I grilled the  zucchini planks first. I brushed them with olive oil (after the salting) before grilling.. This cooks off the water so the zucchini shrinks a lot. I used 4 large zucchini to  get enough for 2 layers. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. It was scrumptious! My zucchini-hating teen lapped it up!  The only bad news: no leftovers. ;-(

I did like other reviewers - baked zucchini slices in oven first, sautéed mushrooms first, and didn't add water.  Also used ground turkey vs beef.  I also agree that the green or red pepper doesn't really belong.  Very good.   Needs more spice, so more tinkering next time - but a great recipe to start tinkering with a lo carb style lasagna.

Amazing! Used ground turkey that I seasoned with fresh herbs (Basil, Oregano, Rosemary) and garlic powder because that's what I had on hand. Like another reviewer I also added a couple cloves of garlic to the meat sauce. Oh, and a small amount of sugar to cut the acidity - less than a tbsp.

Great recipe! I sliced the zucchini about 1/8 of an inch thick to help it hold its integrity. I also both salted it and baked it about 15 minutes at 350. For the meat sauce I used my favorite jarred basil and tomato sauce, only about half of the jar. I did add red wine but no water. Omittted the bell pepper. Sautéed the mushrooms just until they released their water but short of being cooked through and drained them. Sautéed fresh spinach until just wilted and drained it. Included the chopped fresh basil and oregano in the ricotta mixture instead of the meat sauce. Assembled and cooked per the recipe. Absolutely wonderful. My husband loved it.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I thought it was quite good.  I added venison instead of beef. I think it would have been better with beef, but it was delicious.  I did  cut the cheese down some.  I will experiment with changes to improve it to my taste.  You could tweek it a little and make a mexican dish out of it.  Love it and will make it again.

What a great way to use the fall zucchini and fresh herbs left on the garden.  Cooked the mushrooms  before layering. Used drained cottage cheese and squeezed moisture out of the frozen spinach. Salted zucchini and patted dry with paper towel.  Salted the meat. Didn't miss the noodles at all. There was liquid in the pan after cooking but definitely did not throw out all that wonderful flavour. Next day the lasagna cut beautifully and froze the rest with the liquid.  This is going on my Fall list of recipes. EXCELLENT!

OK, I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I just wanted to watch the video and see how the zucchini was laid out.  I basically made it the same way I normally make a lasagna with the only change was no noodles and zucchini instead.  It was delicious.  Adding the salt to the zucchini helped the moisture come out.  Will definitely make again.

I have been looking for low-carb recipes. This was so delicious that my husband took several portions after a tentative small beginning. I ended up substituting a homemade spaghetti sauce but only after I discovered my canned tomato sauce was too old. I used fresh spinach that I had microwaved with a sprinkling of water for two minutes. I used only 1/4 pound of ground beef, but it easily could have been totally vegetarian.

Wonderful flavor. Followed the recipe except I Used store bought marinara due to time constraints, and I always add extra cheeses. I'm a cheeseaholic.

made this using my own sauce and it was sooooo good. I didnt mind some of the runniness of the sauce since I like and make my sauce that way. the addition of spinach and mushrooms was wonderful. I definitely did not miss the noodles. I will be making this again.

I love this! Reviews are important though. Upon suggestions, I doubled herbs, added garlic, sautéed onions &peppers,  fresh spinach, DIDN'T add water. Only used 1container of mushrooms, full fat ricotta, and half of the parmigiana. I know it's a lot of tweaking but so worth it!

Love it.  I've used this recipe twice and it's turned out perfect.  The meat sauce is amazing. I used just a tad more wine than it calls for, but that's just my preference.

I used sausage instead of ground beef.  I also used yellow and orange bell peppers.  I sautéed the peppers and onions in olive oil separately because I like them nice and caramelized.  I kind of wish I added some garlic!!!!

Lasagna turned out great! So tasty and filling, and I love that it includes so many vegetables! I substituted the ground beef with mushrooms (because I'm a vegetarian). I threw white mushrooms in a food processor to give it a ground beef look, then put it on the skillet and did the rest of the recipe as told. My only comment would be to salt the zucchini as early as possible, maybe the morning of the dinner, to drain it as much water as you can. I think the zucchini and mushroom combo left my sauce a little watery, BUT it still tasted fantastic! I highly recommend this recipe.

Great flavor to this dish! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was due to the water/liquid issues.  Does anyone have any ideas on to get more of the liquid out? I did salt the zucchini, used low moisture mozzarella, etc.

I rate this 5 stars based on the modification I made. I cooked down the mushrooms and spinach together in a separate pan to reduce some of the liquid so it wouldn't be soupy. I also added 8oz. Fresh mozzarella to the top which I love. Added some fresh basil to the shrooms and spinach mix, and don't forget to add a little salt and pepper at every stage. Thank you for a great recipe!

Excellent.  I didn't add water to the sauce and made my sauce really thick and it was the perfect  consistency for a lasagna that holds together well.  I did salt and roast the zucchini for 10-15 minutes but didn't cook the mushrooms, as some suggested.  I also used fresh spinach and dried herbs because that's all I had. The next time I think I can slice my zucchini a little thicker.  I also only made half a pan and used most of two zucchini, so maybe three would be necessary for a whole pan.  Adding the red wine to the sauce is a must in my opinion.  I made this for myself and my regular lasagna for the rest of my family and I definitely preferred this one.  This recipe's a keeper.

This is so good, i like it better than regular lasagna, i can't believe it came out of my kitchen! I left out the mushrooms and the green pepper because I don't like them. Sometimes I leave out the spinach too if i'm feeling lazy. I use italian sausage instead of ground beef and add 2-3 cloves of garlic, be sure to get the extra moisture out of the zuc. Add fresh mozzarella on top and it's seriously mouth watering. Freezes well for lunches.

This got mixed reviews. Two at our dinner party raved over it (one being on a gluten-free diet). Personally, I thought it was rather bland, and the zucchini didn't really seem to be cooked (even though it was very thin).  I'd probably try again but roast the zucchini first and add garlic and more seasonings.

So I'm not sure if this rating is accurate because I changed many things only because I didn't have them on hand and refused to go back to the grocery store. I used jarred pasta sauce (24oz.) I realized I needed another zucchini while layering, so that one didn't sit with salt and drain.  The result was absolutely delicious!! Mine turned out a little watery, but I was able to drain some of that off. It definitely satisfied our need for comfort food!!

Finally a GREAT mostly veggie lasagna.  Used ground bison, added a few fennel seeds and red pepper flakes to sauce, and added about 1/4 c. Parmesan to ricotta mix.  Assembled a few hours in advance to allow flavors to mingle.  Hubster definitely wants this again in the future.

I made this as written with the exception of mushrooms (I did not have any). I also added garlic to the meat when adding the bell pepper and onion. This recipe is a new favorite in my house and has been added into regular rotation.

I really liked it, & my husband who doesn't like lasagna went back for seconds. Didn't have any red wine, so omitted that. the sauce really looked to thick for me, so I added a bit too much water, but was delicious anyway.  I also added a tsp of garlic.Took a lot of time to put together so for that reason not sure if  I'll be making it again, but very tasty. Great for low carb diets!

I made this recipe tonight, with a few alterations, like put garlic on the sauce, lightly baked the zucchini to remove some of the moister, and half of the needed onions, but other than that, it tasted just like a regular lasagna! The recipe is amazing, and healthy. If I could, I would cook this everyday!

I made without meat since I had roasted chicken made. Real GOOD!! I used all red wine and added more than 1/4 cup. It didn't take 20 mins to simmer so watch it and add wine if needed. Great low carb side dish.

Missed the thick substance of the noodle lasagna! I know this was healthier and it did taste good, just too watery for me. I will try again with less liquid .

I didn't use the ground beef and it was excellent. I also didn't have the fresh oregano, so I used dried from our garden. I will definitely make this again. The sauce was very tasty.

Personally I ise this as a great tool for basics. I make own spalaghetti sauce from my garden including bell pepper and onion and I make it my own. If u are new to cooking, this is the way to go, if u are a great cook, use this for a checklist!  Love it and always have!!

I did sautéed my onions first, then added the meat, and I left out the green peppers- I used a mandolin to slice the zucchini  and portobello mushrooms, and seasoned the frozen spinach and squeezed out the water. The result was delicious!

I did change mine a bit... Took the advice of another reviewer & baked the zucchini at 350 for 12 minutes with just 1 tsp of salt sprinkled on it. Don't forget the cooking spray or they stick! Instead of meat I added chopped broccoli and cooked it a little with the onion. Added the spinach, pressed garlic, pepper & herbs (basil & oregano) to the ricotta cheese mixture instead of separately.  Only used one cup total of Mozzarella cheese, half in the middle with all the veggies & cheese and the other half on top. Also only used about 1/2 of a cup of Parmesan for the top. Was not overly watery for me. A big helping point for that I think is drying out the zucchini a bit in the oven and making sure you do allow it to rest for that 15 minutes after baking. The veggies will soak back up some of those juices. Delicious!

Flavor is great. Did not use the water.  I tried mandoline sliced zukes, salted and baked first as suggested.  The slices are almost too thin after baking.  Next time I will not salt & bake the mandoline slices or cut thicker slices and try baking.  Either way it was yet another good way to use those "whale" zukes that hide in the garden.

I used one zucchini because our were huge from the garden. It was easy to make but - turned out watery as I suspected it would. I served it with Italian bread to sop up the juice in your plate. It needed the noodles! Otherwise it tasted very good.

There were a few things I did and would do differently.  I did--make it vegetarian with faux ground beef;  I mixed the spinach in with the ricotta & the mushrooms in with the faux beef (I was not going to do that much layer); for the top layer I mixed put on mozzarella and the layer thinly  with the parm.  I would not slice the zucchini thin (I don't own a mandolin and wasn't going to invest), instead I would cut them in thin rounds, thin slicing was a hassle.  Otherwise, terrific!  Especially the ability to modify vegetarian style.

This had very good flavor.  I took other reviewers' suggestions and didn't add water.  I had some leftover pumpkin so I made a tomato sauce with that and poured it over the lasagna when I served it, which enhanced the flavor.  My problem was that I don't have a mandolin and couldn't slice the zucchini thin enough lengthwise.  It ended up too firm.  Next time, I'll slice it rounds and use it that way.  I enjoyed it.

Followed advice about salting and baking the zucchini slices for 10 minutes, and adding the garlic. Also, do not care for spinach, so left it out , but doubled the mushrooms.  This tasted fantastic!! Family LOVED IT, even my EXTREMELY picky eater who initially turned up her nose when I mentioned zucchini.... also, agree to leave out extra water, as it is not necessary. Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe, and one that allows me to  have my Italian dinner and not feel like I am cheating on my diet... ( I'm using MYFITNESSPAL, and was able to just copy/download the recipe onto their site, and had all the calories, fat, etc listed into my recipes now for whenever I feel like lasagna, without the guilt!)

This recipe is wonderful for a low carb lasagna that is just as good as noodle lasagna.  My family loves it!  I used a layer of fresh spinach instead of frozen and made my own favorite sauce.  I will try it using the sauce recipe supplied next time.

I used turkey Italian sausage vs. beef and I did not add water.  I thinly sliced the zucchini, salted it and let it sit in a colander for 1.5hrs.  The mushrooms were pre-sliced. I had to use a 13x9 dish since the 11x9 was overflowing after the first layer. I baked it as directed pulled it out after first 45 min and saw a lot of water.  I take off the foil and baked 15 min. and still more water. I drained some of it and I put it in for another 20 min.  There was a lot of water still so I transfered sections to a new dishes. I ate it the next day for lunch and it tasted ok.  I think it would have been better had it not been for all the veggie's water.  I don't believe I will make this again.

Very good hearty recipe.  I added garlic and substituted ground turkey for the beef and cottage cheese for the ricotto to make it even more diet friendly.  It still had great flavor.  It did get a little wet.  I may try the oven trick next time.

I will definitely make this again. I had company over for dinner and they loved it! They took the recipe home.  I increased the ricotta by 50% and added another egg. I also used two whole cans of tomato paste instead of measuring out the exact amount. I squeezed the excess liquid from the thawed spinach. And blotted zucchini dry with paper towel.  I was amazed how this help held together perfectly as I served it. No excess liquid. Well worth a little extra effort.

This was delicious! My husband even liked it although he said next time I should add black olives. I also did not put the spinach  in only because I forgot to buy it! I definitaley will next time. This recipe is a keeper. I am going to try to make it  healthier to cut down on the sodium.

I used ground turkey instead of beef.  It was delicious. I'm eating low carb now and miss pasta dishes so much. This satisfied my pasta craving and I will  be making it often!

I did use fresh spinach instead of the frozen, and baked the zucchini as other reviewers had suggested. It was yummy! My hubby prefers the noodle version, but admitted that it was very good.

First of all, I used eggplant in place of zucchini (I thought I had zucchini, but they were cucumbers!); I followed the advice of a few other reviewers and baked the eggplant, sprinkled with a bit of salt and rosemary-garlic seasoning. Used prepared spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce & paste and cooked it down with the rest of the sauce ingredients, including a few cloves of garlic. I followed the rest of the directions pretty much as written, except no Parmesan - just Italian cheese mix. Yummy, delicious and filling!!!!

Great base recipe!  I didn't have to pre cook my zucchini, just salted and drained in a colander. My lasagna held up a lot better than I had anticipated and wasn't runny in the least bit.  I'm really impressed!

Good inspiration recipe- tweaked quite a bit. Made my own pasta sauce- I salted the zucchini to leach water from it then rinsed & botted then toasted in oven to further dry.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, which I drained & Rinsed (I added a lot of fresh basil, Parma cheese & fresh flat leaf parsley to this & mixed the the egg)
Hate mushrooms- didn't use - didn't  add spinach, it will make watery- the herb mixture in the cheese added tons of flavor 
I had no mostiure issues with the above technique 
Loved it

Oh my goodness...this is deeeelicious!  So tasty, moist and light, yet very satisfying.   I have had trouble over the years with my lasagnas being dry or really heavy.  I did use mild Italian sausage, for more flavor and I added garlic.  Also, like another reviewer suggests, I did not salt and drain the zucchini--totally unnecessary.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Great recipe for carb watchers or gluten-free diets.  I don't think I'll ever use regular lasagna noodles again!

My wife made this for dinner tonight. When she placed my plate in front of me and asked what I thought I told her I figured it looked like a vegan threw up on my plate. In hindsight I was wrong and I felt other men of the same mind set of anything without a minimum 4 oz. centre piece of meat is a snack should know this is actually pretty good and gets this husband's stamp of approval and I don't even like zucchini!

I needed 3 zucchini instead of 2 and found that the prep time was a bit more than stated here.  I added garlic, but will use italian sausage next time instead (I think that this dish would be great without meat as well).  I will also take the recommendation of another reviewer and cook the mushrooms and sear the zucchini ahead of time.  Also, will switch out the green pepper for a yellow pepper.  (Less of a chili taste that way).

All of that being said, all of my kids (ages 4, 8 & 10) ate this dish, with no complaints about mushrooms, spinach or peppers.  And two of these kids are super picky eaters.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe that can be modified based on your own likes and dislikes. I changed a few things based on other reviews. First, I sautéed the onion and pepper in olive oil, then cooked the meat, then added them all together. I used 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground mild Italian sausage and used paper towels to drain the fat after cooking. Make sure you don't add the onion and pepper sauté until you drain the fat, or your lasagna will be very greasy. I used fresh cinnamon (red) basil, and added some garlic powder. I used a large 45 oz. can of Ragu sauce (Tomato, Garlic, and Onion flavor) instead of making my own sauce. I baked the salted zucchini slices for 12 minutes and let them sit on paper towels to drain most of the water out. I added basil to the sauce mixture, and also added basil, oregano, and parsley to the ricotta mixture. I might use a bit more ricotta next time because we like it and it seemed like there was not enough. I also used more than the recommended amount of mozzarella--I bought two 8 oz. bags and almost used both, but we are cheese lovers. I left the mushrooms out (no one in our house will eat them.) That's it and it came out great!

YUM!!!! I was so surprised by this dish. Will be making this often. I didn't add the ground beef, nor did I use near as much cheese as it called for and even then it was delicious ! Important to soak or pre-cook the zucchini. I sliced them and added salt and allowed to sit on layers of paper towel for an hour and a half before assembling ingredients. I would recommend cooking the mushrooms first, to prevent extra water getting into the dish. I also added garlic, and additional spices. Excellent! Thank you for posting this recipe.

This recipe was an inspiration! I made a couple of adjustments to satisfy my veggie lifestyle. I always make my own tomato sauce, which I had on hand. So I first crumbled a head of cauliflower, drizzled it with a small amount of olive oil and baked at 375 for about 20 min. I then heated up my 1 day old tomato sauce in a sauce pan and stirred in the cauliflower to create the same consistency as meat sauce. I brought the sauce to a boil and then simmered for about 10 min. From there I followed the rest of the recipe and it was spectacular! Best veggie dish I've made so far!

This recipe is great as is when reheated. That being said, the night of - you can literally drain the excess juices from the vegetables. The best thing to do is to follow along with others and pre-cook (very lightly) your vegetables and drain off or pat off the excess water. Otherwise, plan to make the morning of or the day before, by then the juices are reabsorbed into the dish and doesn't make the whole thing seem soggy.

I used mozz cheese/ omitted ricotta cheese. Used Weldon farms tomato and basil sauce- all of the above veggies, but I spiral used the zucchini to look like thin noodles!! I would use waldon farms 1/2 jar- one egg, chicken. Baked 60 min then broiled for 3 min . Was delicious!!

I like it very much! Four stars are because of my first impression - it was a little bland due to the lack of salt... I did make a few changes - I did not have any wine, I used fresh spinach and sauteed fresh mushrooms as someone suggested... I also used fresh mozarella... mmmmm. Nice! I am going to make it again!

This was delicious! I salted the zucchini slices and then roasted them in the oven just to make sure most of the moisture was removed. The lasagna was not watery at all. I really liked the sauce and plan on using it for other recipes.

This is a good recipe, and I've made it several times and would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the one problem, and that is excess liquid that builds up within the lasagna during cooking. I follow the recipe's directions, and I even drain the spinach by squeezing the water out of it with my bare hands. When the lasagna is done cooking I usually remove a small corner slice let the excess liquid run to the corner then drain it. I have to do this at least 3 times before I'm satisfied that the lasagna is well drained. Extra work but it's worth it.

Made it with ground turkey otherwise just as the recipe was written.  My family loved it!  For the reviewers who were skeptical about not cooking the bell pepper and onion until soft, they get soft when they are baked!

I have made this SO many times and love it. The only thing I added that's extra is roasted garlic to the meat process.

This was quite excellent!   I was unable to thoroughly dry out the zucchini even after salting, letting sit and even baking to roast the water out.  The zucchini also fell apart and didn't retain a sturdy texture.  But veggies are veggies and I didn't need it to look good beneath the oooey gooey cheese so I layered the zucchini anyway as best I could.    I'll keep experimenting with zucchini as I'm sure this was my fault.

What I modified:  

I used half Morningstar Farms Meatless Crumbles and half turkey sweet Italian sausage in lieu of the ground beef.  
Added about 3 cloves minced garlic and used fresh spinach instead of frozen. 
Added a tspn of basil pesto to the ricotta mixture and used a jarred sauce with a little extra tomato paste to beef up the tomato flavor.  
Finally I used fat free mozzarella cheese on the first (bottom) cheese layer.  I did this because it doesn't melt very well and I felt it would give the lasagna (due to my zucchini fail) the texture it needed and I was right as it helped bind it.  

The end result was an absolutely delicious, albeit slightly moist lasagna.  My friends said it was one of the best lasagnas they ever had.  

Agreed: this recipe takes quite some time to prepare, but I think repetition will help with the efficiency!  

Thanks for the recipe and introducing me to zucchini!

I made this with a  few modifications.  I did not add red wine, because I did not have any, and I used ground turkey instead of beef.  I spiced the turkey with crushed red pepper in the sauce, to counter act the sweetness of the turkey.  It was absolutely delicious.  My family was skeptical before they tried it, but it was all gone!

Great!  I followed others advice and cooked the zucchini before hand.  I added a layer of broccoli slaw after the spinach.  I didn't add cheese at all because we try to stay away from dairy.  I also added garlic and some red pepper flakes to the sauce because we like things a bit spicy.  I also used turkey instead of beef.  Because it doesn't have cheese, it is not much like a lasagna.  However, it is a winner and we really liked it! Healthy and delicious!

Yum!  I didn't even miss the pasta.  Do add a couple of chopped garlic cloves when adding the onions and pepper.  I used red pepper, not a fan of green pepper.  Great dish, will be making it again!  ( I did not add any water to sauce)

Was really good and was even better after a few days in the fridge.   I used ground turkey too.  I had a half a pan left over so I froze that into individual portions using my seal a meal.

Men of the house loved it, and my dad is hard to convince when something is made with zucchini instead of a white flour carb. I actually made a bagel to go with it, because I'm the one who ended up missing the noodles the most.

We were definitely split on this one and a 3.5 star rating would be more accurate.  Like most, I used this recipe as a base and made it in 2 smaller pans.  I used jarred pasta sauce, added a cup of cottage cheese, about half of the parmesan cheese and some fresh basil to the ricotta cheese.  I replaced the ground beef with meatless crumbles (made for vegetarian daughter and her hubby).  I sautéed the mushrooms and onions, then set to drain while I sautéed the fresh spinach (hate boxed spinach in lasagna). I followed the zucchini instructions which kind of worked.  These took forever to bake - at 45 minutes the lasagnas were barely warm, let alone cooked.  I bumped up the temp to 400 and had to cook for another 30 minutes or so. I still had quite a bit of liquid on the tops, so I used a piece of white bread to soak up some of the juice, which worked well. Overall it was a lot of work (and expense) for something that was just ok.  But those craving lasagna that can't have pasta noodles will love this recipe.

This recipe was outstanding!  I subbed ground turkey for the ground beef and also subbed hot Italian turkey sausage for the mushrooms.  I forgot the parsley.  Also, I added a clove of fresh garlic and some salt to taste in the sauce.  It was flavorful and filling.  YUM-O!

I have made this recipe twice.  I used canned spaghetti sauce (extra thick) and precooked the zucchini to let some of the moisture get out of it.  I did not add any water the second time because the first time the meal was too watery.  The second time I made it I omitted the ground beef and it was still pretty good. The second time I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and used way less.  I also added garlic to the pizza sauce both times.  This is one of those recipes that you can add or take away a lot of things.  You can alter it to your personal taste. As long as you get the zucchini right you can make it anyway you choose.  Getting the extra water out is important or you will end up with a hot soupy mess.

Delicious. I added red pepper flakes for a little kick to the meat and baked off the liquid from the zuchinni. I also used turkey meat which was just as delicious.

I used this recipe but made some minor adjustments. I sliced the zucchini with a cheese slicer, salted it and baked it in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes on a cookie sheet. I then dabbed the slices with paper towels. I used ground turkey instead of the beef, omitted the bell pepper, wine and Parmesan cheese. The Parmesan because I forgot to buy some. I used fresh herb Italian paste from my produce department instead of buying all those fresh herbs individually. I used fresh baby spinach and only used enough to makes one thin layer. I also cooked the mushtooms with the sauce and meat.  Thank you gor this recipe.

It's pretty tasty! There are a few things that I'll switch up next time like a bit more seasoning in the sauce & I'll probably brown the zucchini so it won't be so rubbery but all in all...I'm very happy!

I am so glad I did this recipe. Hubby is on a diet where he can no longer have pastas and he loves lasagna. Other reviewers were right in that you don't miss the pasta in this lasagna. I did read reviews and added some minced garlic to my meat while browning and I also baked my zucchini slices for 5 minutes per side and blotted dry and also pan fried mushrooms for a bit and blotted those dry as well. The finished lasagna was not at all watery and was delicious!

I made this tonight and my family loved it! I did change some things though. After using my mandolin to slice my zucchinis I put them in my dehydrator to pull the moisture out, I also mixed my sauce with béchamel to give it a creamy taste. The lasagna was a bit soupy still but tasted awesome, so next time I think I'll put my veggies in the dehydrator longer and put my spinach and mushrooms in there as well just to pull out more water.

Loved it! I read all previous reviews and followed advice. I eliminated peppers. Added garlic. Used crushed tomatoes and did not add water. I also used fresh spinach and it was fantastic! Salting draining and patting zucchini dry helped eliminate the water... Everyone loved it!

This was pretty tasty use of fresh garden foods!  I used g. turkey instead of beef and fresh tomatoes, 2 Tbs. sugar & salt instead of tomato sauce.  I also substituted red wine with beef broth and 2 Tbs. Balsamic Vinegar.  (I didn't have it, but I think it would have really helped the sauce!)  Also, make sure to really slice the zucchini thin & really get it to sweat with salt & patting with a napkin.  (There is so much moisture in the zucchini!)
Next time I will slice zucchini thin, add cottage cheese & less spinach to cater to the little ones a little bit more!

Really great way to use those giant zucchinis from the garden! Kept for a few days, and super flexible, ingredient-wise. Used ground turkey, mushrooms, onions, basil, and a few other veggies. . .

Superb recipe.  I thought this was a great recipe.  The sauce was amazing.  I thought it odd there was no garlic, but the flavor from the bell peppers (Fresh from the garden) really came out and knocked it out of the park.  It was a great use of an overgrown zuke from my garden too.  The only thing I may have done differently is try harder to slice the zukes a little thinner.  But a slightly crunchy lasagna isn't bad either.  I did sub fresh spinach for frozen, and that may have led to the little leak i had at the end of cooking, But overall, any issues I had were my fault and not that of the recipe.

I liked the flavored and texture but it was a little watery.  I tried to cook off the water from the mushrooms and oven baked the moisture out of the zucchini before I assembled it.  Again, very delicious!  Will make again!

Made this for dinner and loved it fresh out of the oven, however I wasn't crazy about the leftovers - too runny and flavor had changed after sitting.

by far my absolute favorite recipe I've tried from this website, and that is saying something. I always add kale to the sauce and I don't put meat in it usually. I just love this dish. I've made it at least 6 times and will continue to do so.

This lasagna is so much tastier than the traditional dish using pasta. I used canned sauce, fresh spinach, portabella mushrooms and freshly grated mozzarella. I didn't salt my zuchini first and there was a lot of liquid in the pan but I just poured it off and no one was the wiser. I don't plan on ever buying lasagna noodles again. Thank you.

This was excellent!!  I followed the recipe but had to make some changes.  I followed other reviewers & baked the sliced zucchini in the oven for 10 mins at 350. I used sweet red peppers as I didn't have green & canned mushrooms as I didn't have fresh. I used a jar of spaghetti sauce as didn't have plain and dried herbs as didn't have fresh.  None of these changes made a difference.  This was absolutely wonderful and definitely a keeper!!

Tried this for the first time tonight.  It came out pretty good.  I left the wine out as well as the water and mushrooms. I think I will add garlic next time to the meet mixture. I didn't use fresh herb and just used the dried ones in my cabinet.  I also used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  This was only because I couldn't get low fat ricotta or organic which I also try to get if possible.  One note though: I made a small pan of it and halved all the ingredients.  There wasn't enough to complete all the layers.  Next time I will use the full amount even for a smaller pan.  I would also double the cottage cheese/ricotta as I used the full 16 oz in the half recipe and still didn't have enough to complete both layers. If you love cheese then you will also use the full 16 oz for the half recipe as well.  Very glad I found this recipe.  Thanks!!!!

I am salt sensitive and this was way to salty for my taste. I will keep looking for another recipe for Zucchini Lasagna. It is one of our favorite vegetable to eat.

Comforting. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef to make this one more fitness friendly. Who needs noodles with lasagna this good. YUM! My brother in law couldn't stop eating it. My dinner guests are begging me to make it again!

This was sooo good, although my non veggie eating husband wasn't thrilled with it. Next time I make it I will cut the amount of black pepper in half though, because it seemed to overwhelm the dish.

This was yummy.  A little runny, and not spicy, but good.
