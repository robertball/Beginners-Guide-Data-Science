Quick and easy to make especially in the slow cooker. My 27 year old son loved this dish and had three bowels full.  My husband felt it was a little too sweet and suggested a reduction in the sugar.

This was very filling and very tastey.  We made it with keilbasa this time around. Is good with bbq sauce as well. And actually, leftovers are good heated up and fried on the stove a little bit and served with eggs. That is becoming a new favorite.  We also like that this is economical. Makes a lot of food.  Thanks for the post!!
