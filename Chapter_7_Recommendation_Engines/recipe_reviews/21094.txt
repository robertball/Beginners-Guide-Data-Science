AWESOME! recipe.

I double the sauce ingredients.  And tripled the cheese :)

I also used fresh spinach and fried a nice amount of garlic in olive oil.

I used three bunches of fresh spinach to replace the two frozen 10 oz. packages in recipe.

I used the water left over after cooking the spinach to deglaze the fried garlic, yeah...

YUMMY!!! recipe, still gonna fine tune here and there though.

Great as side dish for spaghetti.

I tripled the garlic, added mozarella, two additional eggs and sauteed some onions.  Basically it ended up tasting like spanakopita without the phyllo.  Everyone liked it a lot.

My kids love spinach and this was something a little different to do with it. To actually make it a souffle, I used two egg whites and whipped them to the soft peak stage and then folded them into the spinach. I used a good name brand frozen spinach and also doubled the liquid. I also added some seasonings to the dish and topped with more parm. Yum!

I really liked this. It was totally easy, tasted good, and was a different way to dress up spinach for a side dish. I used fresh spinach, wilted, doubled the sauce ingredients, and used mozzorella cheese in addition to parmesan because I didn't have enough parm. Took much longer to cook than shown in the recipe - I cooked mine a good 35-40 minutes before it was set. I will be making this one often!

This was good as listed. This time I beat 3 egg whites till they were firm. Then mixed all together . It was more like a real souffle light and creamy.  YUM!!

I must have done something wrong, because this was the least souffle-ish souffle I've ever seen!  If I make it again, I'll use fresh spinach as the frozen was stringy & chewy.  I doubled the sauce ingredients, but there still wasn't enough to "enrobe" the spinach.

I tried this recipe today as I was having some girlfriends over for brunch and wanted to make something nice, easy and tasty. Like many others I dressed it up a bit.  I sauteed some garlic and onions and some leftover canned tomatoes (basil and oregano flavored) about 1/4 cup then 1 can of spinach.  I let that cool off.  Then in another bowl I added 5 eggs, the milk and some cheddar/jack cheese.  I then greased a loaf pan mixed all the ingredients and baked it at 350 for about 40 min. It was gone in 10 minutes.  It was so fluffy and delicious. I'll be making this recipe often.  Don't be afraid to experiment.

I don't like spinach, but I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and all the spinach lovers said it was great, so I have to go with what they said.  I did double the sauce ingredients.

This is very good if you make a couple of alterations.  I finely chopped and sauted an onion to add.  Also squeeze the spinach dry and double the egg and milk.  Process everything in a blender or food processor.  This gives it a more souffle texture.  You have to double your cooking time tho.  My son loves it!

Microwave cooking saves energy and doesn't heat up the kitchen so try that method of cooking. I doubled the sauce ingredients and used a one-pound package of spinach.  Next time I'll triple or more for a better souffl√© consistency.

I added some quesadilla cheese to it since I didn't drain my spinach enough.  Next time I'm adding artichoke hearts and making it a dip.  It was SO delicious!!!  My daughter even ate some and she hates spinach.

YUMMM! I've made this about 5 times since the first time I tried it. When it cools, it only lasts about 3 minutes before my household devours it. GREAT way to get them to eat spinach. My dad doesn't care for it, but he's always hated spinach.

I'm still doing a little fine-tuning to get it to cook evenly, taste it's best, and look pretty at the same time. I added an extra egg white or too to make the consistancy firmer. Oh, and double the sauce. I also like to cook it at little longer. I haven't made a bad batch yet. It's a weekly staple for us know. Makes a great breakfast, too.

This was pretty good, but you do have to modify this a little to make it better and more flavorful.  Definitely "double the sauce" as other reviewers have said and for me that meant using the original 5 serving recipe and just cutting the spinach to 1 10 ounce package beacuse I was only making this to serve 2.  I also added a bit more garlic and 1/3 cup of shredded mozarella to jazz it up a little.  This recipe isn't really souffle like, but more a casserole.  As a side dish and a different, lighter way to serve spinach it was tasty with the modifications I made and I will make it again.

Tasted very bland.  I added cayenne pepper and cooked totally towards directions.  Was very soupy.  I will stick to my old recipe that always rises and never fails to please. Will not make this again

I loved this recipe but did alter it a bit -- I halved the amountof spinach, added 1/2 chopped onion, which I sauted in butter w/the spinach and garlic before cooking. I also sprinkled some Goya Adobo seasoning in the spinach mix. Even my husband liked it and he generally hates cooked spinach.

I liked this a lot and so did my family. I didn't give it five stars since i made some adjustments to what we liked.  First, I doubled the sauce and halved the spinach.  Second, i threw it all in the blender and pureed it. Don't forget to season and season well!!

I wish I had seen this recipe years ago....it is absolutely perfect on its own, or.... to put with steak or chicken.    I did listen to other reviewers and used more of the egg, cheese and garlic.  Also agreed that it needs to stay in the oven longer....you really want this nice and set, not undercooked.   Thank you so much for this healthy and yummy recipe!!!

I love this recipe! It's extremely easy and fast (as long as you've defrosted the spinach).  I use a little extra garlic and some pepper. I haven't tried the microwaved version, but it turns out great in the oven. This is a staple in our house.

Used fresh spinach.  Sauteed the spinach with some bacon then drained well before adding the other ingredients.  I, personally, found it a little bland but my family loved it.  My son asked to have it at his birthday night dinner.

I had fresh spinach on hand rather than frozen and after blanching it, that was the only substitution I made. I followed the microwave directions and must have a hotter microwave as the very middle (either egg or cheese or both) browned just a bit and was crunchy. Although the flavor of the ingredients was very good, I'll have to agree with another reviewer that the dish was not very "souffle-ish". I also have to question whether the dish will serve 5 - as advertised... only one egg and I ate the whole thing for dinner.

Disaster.  It never set up.  I took it out after the 20 min. and added 3 more eggs and about 1 cup of flour.  Hopefully it will set up this time.

Good recipe. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added two beaten egg whites in order to make it more like a souffle. I also used only one package of frozen spinach (because I only needed two servings) but kept all the other ingredients portions as stated in the recipe. I will make again.

This was good but very bland it definitely needs more seasoning and something else, maybe carmelized onions or something.  I did double the sauce and it still didnt seem like enough.    Its a nice base recipe, but still needs some work.

Quick and easy and my 8 year old loves it. I added some nutmeg and some cottage cheese, 1 more egg and some cayenne.

That wasn't a souffle by any stretch of the imagination, it was simply cooked spinash. So I threw everything in the blender and added 1 tbsp butter, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 3 oz. american cheese, 3 eggs & 1/2 onion and cooked it again for over an hour.

I took others' advice and doubled the sauce, also using egg whites.  It was still very heavy on the spinach and light on the souffle -- but made it healthier, anyway.  My 5 year-old helped make it and enjoyed eating it.  Husband said he prefers plain spinach.

I did not like this recipe. I doubled the amount of egg, milk, and cheese but all I could taste when it was served was spinach. The finished souffle tasted pretty much like I was just eating spinach with a little bit of cheese flavor in it. It definitely needed some flour or butter or a lot more eggs or something. I will definitely be looking for a better spinach souffle recipe than this one.

This dish surprised me and came out ok. I made it for a family gathering and thought it would probably be one of those dishes that I would have to hide. Not so, my family loved it and one relative asked for the recipe because she thought she could get her children to eat spinach this way.

I am sorry to say this but this recipe was disgusting.  The spinach was slightly crunchy even though I baked it longer.  I used one box of spinach to the amount of sauce the recipe called for.  No one liked it.  My kids love spinach and they would not eat it.  I will definitely never make this again.  Sorry.

Very quick and easy low-carb recipe. I doubled the sauce and baked it for about 35 minutes. The next time I make it, I'll try adding a couple more eggs.

hey, this was a big hit with our 2 yr old.  anything that gets kids to eat veggies is ok with me.  i thought it was pretty good.  easy to make, good tasting.  i doubled the sauce to get more of a creamy consistancy.  it is more like a casserole than souffle.  i did add some red pepper to spice things up.

There was something missing here and can't place a finger to it.  I had everything on hand for this recipe, all except I used fresh spinach.  I doubled the sauce too.  It wasn't very souffle-like, I agree, and even though I used fresh spinach, the dish came out a little soggy anyways.  I might make this again if I had too much spinach on hand.

This recipe was very easy and tasty.  My one year old loved it, and for my 2 year old I added extra cheese on the top.  We had some left over which we put on a pizza the next day and it was so good!  I doubled the egg mixture to cover the spinach a little more thoroughly, too.  Nice side dish!  Thanks!

Great recipe...but like everyone else I changed it some. Used fresh spinach...a lot of it.  one of those big tubs you get at Sams Club. We have an Ninja blender / food processor - that thing is great for mincing everything -Doubled the cheese, and milk,used 4 eggs, used some pepper flakes, added an onion. Next time I plan to mix in some crumbled bacon. 
This is a great base to get started with and have some fun cooking.

Awesome! I followed the recipe using 1 pkg of spinach. I microwaved as per directions and it was perfect! Using crepe boats(oval dishes), I put the souffle in 4 crepes and added a little bernaise sauce on the bottom of each before folding both sides. Added a little more sauce on top. Finished with shredded cheddar and parsly flakes. Broiled until cheese melted. Decadence! Thank you, Jennifer for such a great and simple recipe! My family thinks I'm a super chef and my Aunt just asked for the recipe! I didn't want to tell...

Tried this today.  It had good taste, but lacked the puffiness of a "true" souffle.  I was looking for the souffle crustiness, and this let me down.  Most souffles that I have made prior used flour, as well as egg whites(as some of the other reviewers suggested).  I added mushrooms to mine as well.

First time making a souffle, after reading reviews, I used 3 eggs, separated the whites out and beat them before folding them in to the other ingredients and used 3 handfuls of fresh, chopped spinach.  It never got light and fluffy, stayed more like a quiche. Good, but not what I was looking for.  I'll have to do some more experimenting.

FLOP! There is no flour, not enough egg,  and barely any cheese. Nothing to make it rise up and get fluffy. Followed directions and measurements precisely. Just a watery soggy mess (and yes, I pressed every ounce of water out of the spinach).

I doubled the recipe. It did not rise. I think it is because I did not fold in the spinach. They did not stress that this was an important step. I mixed it with my wisk. It turned out like scrambled eggs and spinach. Perhaps I will try again with the things i have learned.

I did love the flavor, I used the recipe to double the flavor, but nothing in this makes a souffle, it did not rise, just baked like a casserole.  I will try again using the lite recipe as posted, but I dont see anything in the ingredients or instructions  that would make this rise like pictured.

I don't understand how this recipe made it past the Allrecipes editors. With the excessive amount of spinach for just one egg, no whipped egg whites, and a grossly inaccurate cooking time, it's a complete disaster.

I was able to eat it, but only after raising the oven temperature to 375 and cooking it for 55 minutes. And then it's pretty much just baked spinach.

Do not even try this recipe--it never even should have been published here at all. And the finished product bears no resemblance whatsoever to the published photo.

Was looking for a spinach souffl√© recipe but although this one sounded good and easy, the directions were vague as to its size. Perhaps mentioning what constitutes a "small" souffl√© dish or listing how many servings this recipe yields would be helpful.

The first photo is totally deceptive and this recipe isn't a soufflee at all.

Good and easy.  Followed the directions and cooked it in the microwave just to see how it would turn out.  Perfect!

This is teally not a good recipe . Just ends up being dry, unflavorable. People who had better redults changed the recipe quite a bit. You end up with s little dried block of spinach

Easy and tasty.  I did as other reviewers, and doubled the eggs, milk and cheese.  And I really appreciated the info about microwaving it - it was 99 degrees today here in Tucson!  Who wants to use the oven!  Certainly not a souffle, but close enough.  Thanks for posting.

Really easy. The oven was at 400 for something else and it worked fine. I used half frozen and half fresh spinach because that is what I had and I think the texture was great.

I'll make it again but next time I'll add  2 egg whites.  It was more like creamed spinach than the souffle.  I touched it up with a little nutmeg.

Gluten free and delicious. We were shocked to that Stouffer's spinach souffle contained wheat so made this in a pinch by chopping fresh spinach in the blender (healthier and easier than spending 30 minutes squeezing out water from the frozen!). Loved it and can't wait to make it again!

Made it in the microwave exactly as written. Very good. Next time I might try doubling the sauce part.  However, great as written and super quick!

Well, I loved it.  I had some leftover collard greens cooked and seasoned.  I drained them well, tossed them into the food processor, and drained excess liquid.  Then proceeded with the recipe.  Used oven method to cook, but it was delightful.  No, not a souffle, but a fantastic way to use up leftover greens.  Worked with collards.  Next I am trying it with frozen spinach.  Will double sauce since I am using more spinach than I did with collards last time.  Mikey liked it!

Needed more cheese or eggs or something too hold it together.  Also probably one less container of spinach.
