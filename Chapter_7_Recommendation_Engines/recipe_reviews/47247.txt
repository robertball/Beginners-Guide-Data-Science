This is excellent!  I used the following suggestions from other readers:  used an 8x8 pan, 3 eggs instead of 2, enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce, added some black olives and jalapenos on top, used only 8 ounces lower fat mexican cheese instead of 16 ounces, and broiled the cheese on top.  My husband and I both loved it and we'll definitely be making this again!  We served it with spanish rice, salad, tortilla chips and salsa.

Very Good ! I used about 8 fresh roasted Hatch green chiles.(Hatch,NM is famous for thier peppers) Very accessable for me living in AZ. Used 1 lb of ground beef cooked with onion, and a little cumin. 3 eggs and a little hot sauce to the egg mixture. And enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Used mostly sharp cheddar with a little monterey jack. Many compliments !! Reheats well.

I have been making this one for a few years now, with the following changes.
I only use the evaporated milk.
Use egg WHITES only, not as heavy this way.
Enchilada sauce instead of tomato, more flavorful.
I cut the whole chiles into 1" pieces then put them in.
Everyone who has had it, loved it.

After reading the reviews ... used an 8x8 pan, 3 eggs, only the evap milk, 1/2 the cheese - 4 oz of jack, 4 oz of cheddar, and about 1/2 cup enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce. My guests devoured this. Next time I'm adding a total of 4 eggs and a bit more flour to see if it gets fluffier. I'd like to try this with homemade roasted chiles even though the canned whole chiles tasted fine but I wouldn't use the diced chiles - discovered they are bitter, have too much juice, seeds, pieces of stem and ??? Yucky. Took longer to cook in the 8x8 pan (10-15 min. longer) and be sure to let it rest at least 10 minutes before serving. This is such a delicious recipe (despite all the changes) it still deserves 5 stars.  *&$^@*&!  I just reread the recipe and discovered it calls for a 5 oz. can (?) of evap milk. Hmmmmm. Maybe that is why so many reviewers eliminated the regular milk and just used a can (12 oz) of evap milk. That's what I did and it turned out fine. Pays to read the fine print!

Excellent dish when using suggestions of others, and a couple of my own improvements. Smaller pan (8x8 or 9x9), 2-3 lg. fresh roasted pasillo or ahaheim chiles (peeled & diced), 4 eggs, half the cheeses, only the evap. milk. For the egg mixture: Separate the eggs and whip the whites until slightly stiff. Blend together the egg yolks, flour and milk and fold into the beaten egg whites. This creates a much fluffier casserole. The best sauce for this dish is a can of mexican style stewed tomatoes, blended till just smooth. More authentic and flavorful than using enchilada sauce. Never would use just canned tomato sauce - yuck.

As an update, since I make this so often, I should add that I often skip the sauce, and top the casserole with thinly sliced tomatoes instead-before baking. For the reviewer that posted that 4 eggs was too many (tasted the eggs), I should note that I typically make this as a breakfast/brunch dish, so maybe that's the difference.

yum!! You can prepare this casserole ahead of time, then pop it in the oven when you're ready for dinner. I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce for a little extra spice.

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I use chopped chilis, one more egg, and only the evaporated milk (Not the additonal 1/2 cup milk which isn't even listed in the directions.  #2 says mix milk not milks.  Is the extra milk a typo?).  I also bake it in a smaller pan - not the 8x8 - I use that odd pan in between an 8x8 and 10x13.  We serve it with taco pie (fried burger with tomato sauce, served over a baked crescent roll crust, topped with cheese, and add your own lettuce, onion, etc.)  This is definitely a keeper.  Have used lower fat items also and was still tasty.  We had leftovers for breakfast!

I must say this is the best. I usually prepare my own roasted Poblano peppers and stuff them. But this casserole is just as good. It is definitely a keeper.

this was pretty good.  after reading pages & pages of reviews, here are the modifications i did:   (1) used 9x13 pan.   (2) used 27 ounce can of HATCH whole green chiles.  cut them down one side, and laid them face up in pan (3) used 4 eggs instead of 2 (4) sprinkled some cumin in the egg mixture (5) used red enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce (5) used a colby jack cheese instead of using the two cheeses listed (6) cooked for a full 35 minutes (7) added sauce, cheese & olives and cooked for another 10 minutes (8) i added cooked, shredded chicken in between the two layers of chilies.    i will most likely make this again.  enjoy!

Great meal! If you love Chili Rellenos but don't want to fry and stuff peppers...Try this!  I made a few changes with fantastic results:  3 eggs, seperated one can of evap. milk- stamdard size 1/4 cup flour, 8 oz of Krafts new Philly mexican cheese.  6 large fresh poblano peppers.  Deseed the peppers and cut them into chunks and briefly steam them, to soften them. Lay them on paper towels after steaming to gather any extra moisture. Spray oil and then line your 9x9 pan with the peppers overlapping here and there. layer with half the cheese and repeat. Slowly whisk the evap. milk into the flour, add egg yolks, and salt and pepper. In separate bowl whisk egg whites to very soft peaks, then gently fold into milk, flour mixture. Pour over peppers and cheese layers and bake at 350 for 40 mins.  I used tomato puree with sauteed onion, garlic, cumin and chopped cilantro to half a can of enchilada sauce.   Pour over top and heat through 10= 15 mins. Let rest 5 mins and enjoy with Mexican rice and refried beans!

This recipe definately has potential.  I was not impressed with the tomato sauce, I would use enchilada sauce or salsa next time.  Also, I thought there was too much cheese.  Wow!  That is really saying something for me because I am a cheese lover and usually add more than is called for.  Maybe there wasn't too much, just needed something in there with it.  I think I will try a little shredded chicken in the middle of the chilies next time.  I have never had chile rellenos with meat in them, but hey, sounds like it would be tasty!

WOW! I was surprised how much this casserole does taste like chili rellenos. My husband loves chili rellenos and he flipped over this casserole. So did I. Following others on some changes, I used an 8x8 dish, 3 eggs, the evap. milk and about 3 TBS of half and half (milk would do fine).  I had some left over Rotel tomatoes so I sprinkled some of those in the middle of the layers.  I used the amount of cheese called for in the recipe. For the final sauce I mixed 8 oz of tomato sauce with about 1/4 cup very HOT salsa, a dollop of the canned Rotel and 1/2 teaspoon sugar just to enhance the spicy flavors. I love this recipe and cannot wait to try it with fresh peppers.  I used the whole fire-roasted, canned peppers. I think the canned diced peppers would not work well. There are so many ways to play with this recipe.  Salsa verde, enchilada sauce, fresh peppers, various combos of cheese, etc.   When I try a new dish that is said to be like another, as in this recipe, I don't tell whomever I am serving it to that it is like something else.  I just called this a Mexican casserole. That way I don't set up an expectation of how it should taste so if it doesn't taste a lot like the original dish to someone it can be enjoyed for how it does taste. Without knowing the name of the dish, my husband commented on how much this tastes like chili rellenos. :)

This was really good.  I did use 1/2 a can of enchilada sauce in lieu of tomato sauce and only used the evap. milk ( I don't know why there are 2 milks)  All in all, very tasty.  Not spicy.  Great meatless supper with rice & chips

This was excellent..My family and work people loved it and asked for the recipe.  I used Hatch Enchilada Sauce, only 1/2 the cheese on the top and an 8"pan.

I made this with Poblano peppers, first roasted them on the grill, and even left the skin on afterwards. Thought the burnt skin would add nice flavor and it sure did. I could only find 12oz. can of Evaporated milk and didn't want to waste it, so used the whole can and left out the regular milk. I also added two more eggs. I used the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site for the sauce. My husband is still raving about this. We cooked it in a 8X10 dish out on the gas grill at 350-75 degrees. Topped with Monterey Jack/Colby cheese. Note: the egg/milk sauce may look thin when you pour it over the chilies but it thickens  and rises up real nice when it cooks. (of course I added more eggs to mine). Sure was a lot easier than regular Chili Rellenos.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and love it! I do add an extra egg and only use the evaporated milk, otherwise it turns out way too soupy! Sometimes I use less chilis/cheese and have a smaller casserole, sometimes I use more chilis/cheese and have a larger casserole. This recipe is very forgiving. I use this strictly as a vegetarian meal. I did have issues with the sauce that goes on top and tried salsa, enchilada and ranchero sauces as various times. However, I didn't really like any of these - they all seemed to overwhelm the chilis. I took another look at "tomato sauce," and thought that just couldn't be what the contributor meant. I took another look at the Mexican food section, and lo and behold I stumbled on it! Mexican tomato sauce! The brand I like is El Plato Mexican Tomato Sauce (Hot). It adds a flavoring, with a little heat, without completely overwhelming the entire dish. And it comes in the perfect 8 oz size. Love, love, LOVE!

This is soooo good!!  I originally tried this recipe as a way to use up some garden Anaheim peppers someone had given us.  Because I made it that first time with fresh chilies, I now only make it that way.  It takes a little more time (not much though, really), but is definitely worth it!  I broil my peppers, turning occasionally, in my toaster oven til the skin is bubbly and they're soft, then halve them and scoop out the seeds, and coarsely dice them.  It gives it so much more flavor than using canned chilies!  (Not that canned aren't good too...)  If you are going to use fresh chilies, 6 is about the right amount (3 fresh chilies, diced up, per layer).  We seriously LOVE this recipe around here!!  Its one of my husband's new favorites, and my kiddos (3, 7, and 10) all love it too!  (They top theirs with sliced olives, too, which I recommend trying.)  And I love that its super easy!

This is a  quick dish for those nights you just dont know what to make! I made a few modifications on this recipe though.  
First of all I used a 8x8 dish. It made the servings appear much larger. I also used 3-4oz cans of Hatch brand whole green chilis. These are grown/processed in New Mexico and have the best flavor. I also cut the cheeses in half- 4 oz each of  Monterey Jack and cheddar. Also I added a third egg to the recipe. It gave the casserole more body. Thank you Clarissa2 for a reminder of a great dish I grew up on!

I have used this recipe with some differences for several years and it is so easy and SO good.  I give it 5 stars with these changes...

I use whole Hatch canned roasted green chilis if I am in a hurry--the BIG can + one smaller 7 ounce can so that you end up with 20 some-odd ounces altogether.

OPEN and FLATTEN the chilis when layering--it makes for a more delicate blend of the flavors and makes the finished casserole cut very neatly.  I grate about 1/2 a pound of each--Cheddar and Jack.  I use only the evaporated milk (low fat works just fine) and use 4 eggs, which makes a nice, firm layer on top.  Either enchilada or plain tomato sauce works great.  Flattening those chilis makes a big difference in the blending of the flavors.  YUM!  It tastes even better the next day.

I have made this several times.  I've been working it to get it similar to what I always order from  my favorite family owned  mexican restaurant, while limiting fat and calories.  I've used fresh peppers and canned.  Best with Hatch fresh roasted peppers, in season. Fire roasted canned are not bad either. Most recently I used a 1 lb.10oz can of chiles and added  2 stewed chicken breasts and  used only 8 oz. of pepper jack, layered chiles, chicken, cheese, chiles, chicken, cheese.  I always put a 10 inch flour tortilla in the bottom of my round casserole so I don't have to scrape against foil to serve, no one wants to bite into foil bits.  Use Reynolds release or spray the foil so you can lift the whole lot out of the casserole once cooled and set, serve pie wedge style.  For this larger amt of chile peppers I used 5 sm eggs, 5 T flour, 4 T 2%, 1t garlic powder, 1/2 t cumin. The sauce is appx. 1 cup "Enchilada Sauce" by Anna Marie, sans cinnamon and chocolate, and a can of regular Rotel. Next approximation I will mix drained regular rotel with the chiles and use hot Rotel in the Enchilada Sauce.

This was EXCELLENT! I did this recipe AS IS and it was GREAT! I wanted to make one that tastes like my moms. This was perfect! I did everything as is, kept the tom sauce and used both the evap milk and regular milk.  I felt that if i added the enchilada sauce, it might be over power the chili's. Thanks for bringing back good memories of my mom's chili rellenos.

Excellent.  Use 3 eggs and one can of evaporated milk, leave out the regular milk.   Used an 8x8 pan and increased 1st bake to 30 minutes and second time after sauce is added to 20 minutes.  Cooled 10 minutes.   Use an enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato, much better!  My Sauce: 1/2 Onion chopped 2 T oil 1 can tomato sauce 2 tsp chili powder 3 T salsa salt to taste  Saute onion with oil til tender.  Add all remaining ingredients and simmer on low til thickened, pour over casserole and continue to bake 20 minutes.

We had this for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! I changed a few things, using ideas from the other reviewers. I made this in a smaller dish because I used fresh Anaheim chilis and didn't have enough for a 9 x 13 pan (I under-estimated the amount of peppers that were in a 7-oz jar).  I also added one more egg, did not use the 1/2 cup milk (again due to the smaller size dish), and switched the tomato sauce to enchilada sauce. My husband and I really enjoyed this casserole. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe could be 5 stars with a few changes. I used fresh roasted and peeled Poblano chiles. I used only evaporated milk omitting the regular milk. I layered the casserole, (8 x 8 dish), with the Poblanos on the bottom followed by a layer of cheese. I repeated this twice and then topped with the egg mixture. Last, I did not use tomato sauce. I used a can of Rotel, mashing the tomatoes until the consistency was that of salsa. Will make again with these changes.

This is DELISH!  I had forgotten about it.  My Mom make this dish, with two exceptions.  She uses diced chiles, and she adds 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the tomato sauce.  I was so tickled to see this recipe, I gave her a call, and she said it is the same (virtually) as she fixed us kids when we were young!  Glad to have it back in my recipe box!  THANKS SO MUCH!!!!

We have made this a few times already and are now reviewing it. We call it "Poor Man's" chili relleno because it is so easy to make and tastes as good as using the real thing which is way more involved than this recipe. Some Hint of Lime Tostitos, hot sauce and you are good to go!

Absolutely love this recipe. I use 1/2 cup of sour cream.  This makes a silky, fluffy béchamel.  Also this calls for tomato sauce, mine called for salsa. Easy to make and leftovers are just as good heated. I also use shredded chicken cooked in Sofrito sauce on top of the chiles, then layer cheese, pour on béchamel.

I made this recipe as presented and it is FAR too soupy. Listen to the other reviewers and don't use the other 1/2 cup milk! It would also be better to add in more flour & another egg to make it more substantial. Enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce is another must. Then it is a very tasty recipe!

Yum! I used a 27 ounce can of Hatch whole green chile peppers (it was the only brand/size of whole chile peppers the store had). This was a PERFECT amount for two layers in a 9x13 pan. Instead of using the 5 ounces of evaoprated milk and a 1/2 cup of milk, I used a 12 ounce can of evaporated milk. I chose not to use tomato (or enchilada) sauce on top, and just topped with the cheese for the last few minutes of baking. This was a huge hit and my husband has all but demanded I add this to my weekly rotation of meals. I served with Mexican Rice II from AR, refried beans, and a salad. Yum, yum!

Fabulous.  I did accept others' advice.

I used a 9x9 glass baking dish.

I layered in a small can of drained RoTel diced tomatoes with chilies. I used a 12oz. evaporated milk instead of combined milks.  I used a total of 3 eggs and lightened the dish by separating the eggs and beating the whites into soft peaks- then adding the flour, yolks and milk.  This worked great and I highly recommend it.

Lastly, I put sliced black olives and chopped green onion on top of the cheese that goes on in the final 15 minutes. My casserole required about 10 minutes of extra baking. It was a pretty dish that benefits from sitting a bit prior to digging in.

This is one of my favorite recipe's on this site. It is awesome. I added 2 boiled shredded chicken breasts and used Hatch chilies. Add 1/2 tsp cumin, onion powder and garlic powder. Three eggs and 5 Tbls milk. Excellent!!!! EDIT: This the best meal! I make it all the time and people love it. If you have access to hatch green chilis use them otherwise buy canned. It's good no matter what you do. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  Used many of the suggestions.  Large bake dish, 3 eggs, no milk, Mexican Cheese blend. Used 1/2 of 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce after 30 min. cooking. Put spanish rice on top (2 bags of Uncle Ben's 90 sec. microwave rice), that I mixed   with 1 sm. can of black olives with Jalapenos.  Covered with remaining enchilada  sauce and sprinkled  more cheese on top.  Coked for 10 more minutes.  Excellent.  Next time I'll add Chicken to the Chili layers. Everyone loved it!

The reviews for this were excellent so I made it for a dinner party.  No one liked it.  I must have been thinking that this would be a totally different dish because it was not what I expected.  All of the appetizers and side dishes were eaten but almost the entire dish of this was left.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  My husband was WILD about this!  I carefully read the reviews and did follow a few of the suggestions.  I used 3 eggs; sharp cheddar cheese and baked it in an 8" square pan.  It did taste even better the second day.  This is truly a keeper!  Can't wait to fix it again!

This was a big hit at our Cinco de Mayo potluck.  I used fresh roasted anaheim chilis, no yolks and enchilda sauce.  I doubled the recipe and still used the 9x13 pan.  It was only about an inch and a half thick even after doubling.  I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer.

So good it left me shaking my head in disbelief!  Based on other reviews, I doubled the mixture of eggs, flour and evaporated milk, added an extra egg, omitted the regular milk, and used enchilada sauce on top.  Because my favorite chile rellenos are filled with fresh spinach and mushrooms, I sauteed some and added them in between the layers of cheese and chiles.  When baked in an 8x8 pan it needed an extra 10 minutes to set before I could add the enchilada sauce, and I broiled it at the end until the cheese was bubbly.  So, so good -- can't wait for leftovers!

I have made this recipe several times from a slightly different recipe. Mine calls for four eggs and after baking you put salsa on top and sprinkle with cheese instead of the tomato sauce. I bake it in a 9x9 pan until set, about 40 minutes. I also use drained diced chiles instead of the whole ones.

I have now made this recipe twice.  Once, exactly as written and the second time based on some input from other reviewers.  I would give this five stars either way.  There is nothing wrong with the original way it is written.  Dishing it out and serving it alongside beans and rice, it was a great meal.  If you make it in a smaller dish, the casserole is a little thicker, and I do like that, as well.  Servings seemed a little more substantial.  I did find that, making it in the smaller dish, I didn't need as much milk.  I did not cook it longer (as others have suggested you do if you make it in a smaller dish), and it was just fine.  The second time around I made it in a smaller dish, eliminated the second milk and added one more egg.  I liked it eggier, I must add.  So if I make it either way, I will add the additional egg.  And I will always use enchilada sauce instead of tomato.  Either way you make it, be sure to let it sit for about 10 minutes to let it firm up.  This is an amazing recipe and I'm so glad I found it.  One other change I will do next time is use more Monterey Jack cheese than cheddar, because that feels more like the real thing to me.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use green enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, and I double the egg mixture part. I also buy two of the big cans of green chilies. I don't measure the cheese, I just keep layering the chilies and the cheese till it's gone. Oh, I also use the biggest glass baking dish I have. Comes out perfect and it's enough for my family of 6 to eat twice.

I told my husband that we might wind up at Panda Express when I first took this out of the oven.  First, I don't know how anyone can make this recipe work in a 9x13 pan.  I started with a 9x13 and then switched to a 9x9.  The only other changes I made were to add the entire 14 oz. can of evaporated milk, skip the regular milk and add an extra tablespoon of flour because of the extra mlk.  If I make this again, I'll probably put in 1/2 can of evap milk and increase to three eggs.  Thanks!

A grand slam winner...  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and it was wonderful.  Enhancing it with my/our own personal touches will only make it better.  I thank the chef for giving us the road map to a quick & delicious meal, and for putting in the effort to do so.  I'm a "chili relleno guy" when I go to Hispanic restaurants, so you know how pleased I am with this...

I'm adding this one to my most requested recipe list.  I took it to a potluck at work and my co-workers loved it.  I made a few changes based on the reviews I read.  I used fresh fire roasted Poblano and Anaheim Peppers, also added an extra egg, left out the tomato paste and used green enchilada sauce instead.  As for the cheese I used what I had in hand.  Colby cheese.  It was truly excellent.

I took the advice of many of the other reviews: 8x8 dish, omit milk, add a third egg and cooked about 10 minutes longer. I also used Green Enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. This provoded a bit more green chili taste. I also added 1 - 8 oz can (almost all) diced tomatoes (well drained) and sliced olives in the last step (at the same time as the sauce is added). 
This turned out really, really good! Be warned, though - this is a HEAVY dish. After eating we had to leave the dirty dishes for later!
I think shredded chicken would work well and I'll try next time. I'm not sure ground beef would be so good.

This recipe is fantastic.  But I did make a few changes.  First of all I can't make any recipe without a few changes, that's just how I cook.  I used an 8X8 casserole. (Wished I had used bigger) I used my own whole green chili peppers that I had frozen.  Don't know how they compare to the canned kind.  Two layers on the bottom of casserole dish.  Then add half the cheese, them another layer of cheese. (Forgot to save some for the top.) Mixed 4 eggs with a 12 oz can evaporated milk 4 Tbs flour and salt and pepper to taste.  I did not use the extra 1/2 cup milk the recipe called for.  Poured the egg mixture over the chili and cheese mixture and baked for about 35 min.  Then took out and put on a layer of home made enchilada sauce ( about 1 cup.) then put 4 slices of swiss cheese on top as I had used all the other cheese already. Served with olives and rice. It only served 4 adults, but we are big eaters. Cooked for another 20 minutes.  Thank You so much Clarissa2.  I will make this many times again.  Sharon

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for.  It was quick, easy and delicious.  When I have more time, I will try some of the other suggestions as they sound yummy!

This is the best and easiest chili rellenos recipe I've seen.  I've made this numerous times and I always get raves and requests.  I follow the recipe to the letter except I add olives and chives on the top and I put it all together at once and bake it for 45 min.   Thank you CLARISSA2 for a PERFECT recipe.

We absolutely LOVE this recipe! I also use red enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. I add corn tortilla strips to the layers, much like making a Mexican lasagna. I only use 8oz. of cheese, and I add chorizo to the layers to make it a meal.

Family like it DESPITE the fact that I used condensed milk instead of evaporated milk in error! If you are looking for a unique Mexican desert  - try it this way.  Used roasted Hatch chiles from the Farmer's Market. Yum.

I made it in an 8 x 8, as some suggested.  I also topped the recipe with Rotel canned tomatoes.  Rotel has various types of canned tomatoes.  They are all good. Outcome was too cheesy.  It was a cheese over kill (And I LOVE cheese!).  Next time I'll stick to the 9 x 13, as stated, and use the Rotel topping.  Overall, the dish had a great flavor but I think I'll follow the dish size next time.  This is a saver!

I get Hatch Chili's from New Mexico, roast and freeze them every year, and I used them in this recipe.  I only used 5 oz of evaporated milk (fat free), about half the cheese, and enchilada sauce.
This is a great recipe!!  We loved it and I will be making it again!!

I give this four stars for the ease of recipe.  Hubby and I thought it was Very Good, teens not to keen on the whole chilies. I did make a couple of changes to try and make it a little lower in calories.  I used non-fat evaporated milk, non-fat milk in lieu of whole, and did not use the tomato sauce, but used a medium Green Chili Enchilada sauce.  I would make again.

I thought this was a great, easy, HEALTHIER way to enjoy Chilis Rellenos.  I used fresh mild chilies instead of canned.  I sliced them into "rings" and this worked out great.  I also mixed some salsa into the tomato sauce, but next time, I would either use all salsa or just try diced tomatoes.

My family said this was awesome! I had some frozen pasilla peppers so I roasted and peeled them instead of using canned. My boyfriend's mom and I made this dish as if we were making real chile relleno... stuffed peppers with 1/4-inch rectangles of Jack cheese, beat egg whites to a peak, then folded in the yolks, flour, and evap. milk (did not use reg. milk at all) as recipe called for and poured over the peppers (fit approx 8 peppers in a 9X13 pan). Baked for 25 min, then topped with green enchilada sauce and some shredded Jack cheese; baked another 10 min and left in oven to keep warm until it was time to eat. We made homemade spanish rice as a side.

This is fabulous.   It was quick to put together, looks beautiful when it comes out of the oven, and my family loved it.  The only change I made was to add the second layer of cheese before putting it in the oven.  Next time I will double the recipe because it is also great reheated the second day.

This is a great recipe. I have a batch sitting next to me waiting to go into the oven. The changes I made were: I roasted and peeled at least 10 huge Poblanos, used only Evo milk, Manchego cheese (which is what most restaurants use here in Mexcio) and since I had so many chili's I was able to make 3 layers. I also made Ranchero Sauce aka Spanish sauce which is how they are really supposed to be served. It's simple and so much more interesting than Enchilada sauce IMHO. They only thing I didn't add was a pinch of baking powder which I used last time and it makes the eggs rise up and look beautiful. I'll probably add the sauce 10 minutes before serving and then have a bowl of the yummy stuff to pass around. I found the right recipe from Emeril Lagasse. I highly recommend it! Can't wait for dinner.........

My husband and I are trying to eat more meat-free meals and this was so delicious that we didn't even miss the meat!  I used canned diced green chiles instead of the whole ones because that's what I had in the cupboard and ended up using two 7 oz cans and one 4 oz on.  I also used reduced fat cheese and a homemade sauce instead of the canned tomato sauce.  We just loved this and fought over who would get the leftovers the next day.  Thank you so much for the recipe CLARISSA2.

I had some fresh green chili peppers from my garden so after seeding and cutting them in half, I boiled them for 10 minutes and let cool. I used them instead of the canned version. I used the small can of milk but didn't add the additional milk as noted. Baked in an 8x8 pan for an additional 10 minutes and used a can of enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce. This was served with fresh guacamole, salsa and tortilla chips. My family really liked it and asked me to make it again!

Absolutely fantastic and versatile!  We used fresh poblanos from our garden (no need to pre cook), an 8x8 pan, no milk, but suggest you add an extra egg as others have suggested, 1/2 the cheese, and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  We added sliced black olives and fresh minced jalapeno with the remaining cheese for the last 15 minutes. The concept for this recipe is really good and very fast.  We wanted to cut calories and use our garden too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!!  I used fresh chilis (a lot of work roasting and peeling them) and I added 1 extra egg.  I omitted the tomato sauce and made my own sauce.  It was great!  This is a good tasty dish! However, if you use a tomato sauce it will NOT taste authentic.  Using tomato sauce in a chili relleno recipe is NOT authentic.  Soo...if your looking for the authentic taste you would get in your favorite mexican food place...this is not it...You need to add other ingredients to the tomato sauce.  If you want a yummy dish that the whole family will love...this is it! Use fresh chilis and your own mexican chili and it will be the real deal.

This is really good, not the same old thing.  
  I changed it a little. I used a red bell pepper toasted, with a can of chili rellenos, and I also added a drained can of mushrooms. Had I had black olives, they would have been really good. I used about 1/2 cup of flour, because it was too runny of batter for my taste. I used mild picante sauce instead of tomato sauce, to give it a little more flavor. 
  I had already set it up to bake in the 9 x 13 pan, read on and everyone else had tried the 8 x 8 pan. It would've been 5 stars with the 8 x 8 pan. I cooked it exactly as the recipe said, but it needed, I thought, to cook about 10 more minutes. After all , it's not supposed to be a queish.

This is pretty good.  I followed recommendations and added a third egg, Hatch's enchilada sauce and 1/4 tsp of cumin.  My poor child couldn't eat it though because in my inattention I used medium heat enchilada sauce and it was very spicy.  It took longer than 40 minutes to cook for me (closer to an hour) because I put it in an 8X6 pan instead of an 8X8 or larger.

What a terrific recipe.  I will make again and again.  The only change would be to chop the green chilies rather than leaving them in whole pieces.  Served this with tacos!

I just prepared this recipe and it's delicious.  It really tastes like a chili relleno. I wouldn't make any changes.

This was very good. I do think it lacked some body...a little "custard-y". It was GREAT the second day with some grilled chicken & salsa as a side dish.

I made it half with green chilies, half with jalapenos.  We liked the green chilies much better.  They were bigger and less spicy.  Hubby likes spicy food, that wasn't his problem, but the canned jalapenos were so small, he felt like the casserole just fell apart. Green Enchilada sauce was yummy on top.

As a breakfast casserole, I would give this 4.5 stars.  I made it as written and unfortunately it was very eggy and not really suitable as dinner.  It had a good flavor but didn't remind me of traditional chiles rellenos.  This casserole did set up perfectly though and I think that some reviewers may have used large cans of evaporated milk--this recipe calls for using one and a half 5oz cans-- which should only be 1 cup of milk.  If I make it again I will try it with only 3 eggs and see how that works.

This was nothing like chili rellenos.  I added the extra egg as the other's suggested and I wish I hadn't.  It was more like baked eggs.  I should have just stuck with the original recipe.

Excellent!  Took the advice from the other reviews: 8x8 pan, Didn't use the regular milk (only used the 5oz of evap milk), Enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce - only using about 2/3 of the can, 3 eggs, chopped the chiles into 1 inch pieces.  Garnished with black olives, green onion, and a little sour creaam.

Good recipe.  I was searching for something to make with fresh chillis out of a garden.  I came across this one and my family really liked it.  I used fresh chillis (I did not roast them) I just cleaned them cut them in half and took the seeds out.  I did follow some of the other review suggestions - 8x8 pan, 8oz of 2% cheese vs. the 16, 3 eggs (2 full & 1 white), I did use both 5oz of evaporated milk (2%) and 1/2 cup skim milk, added hamburger seasoned with cumin & onion powder, and used the enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Once I added the cheese at the end I broiled it for about 5 minutes.  I would make this again.

This was incredibly simple to make and extremely tasty! I doubled the recipe and used green enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce, as recommended. I also added a sprinkle of garlic salt over the cheese layer between the peppers. Our daughter is a vegetarian and loved it! I also cooked crumbled pork sausage for my husband and I and sprinkled over the top before serving. A little sour cream and some salsa and we were set!

Excellent casserole with a few tweaks. I layered half of the chiles in the bottom of a 8x8 dish covered with a good amount of cheeses then topped with a flour tortilla. Then layered the rest of the chiles, more cheese and another tortilla. To the egg mixture I added a teaspoon of baking powder, some onion and garlic powder and a little salt and pepper. Poured that over the layers and baked for 25 minutes.Poured some red chile sauce over the top and baked for 15 minutes. Topped it with another layer of cheese( all in all I used about 8oz more than the recipe called for)put it under the broiler until nice and bubbly then topped with sliced black olives and chopped scallions. I let it sit for about an hour so it would set up nicely. It was still warm when I cut into it but popped the plates in a warm oven for a couple minutes. It was delicious and leftovers were just as good. I topped mine with a little sour cream. Yum!!

This is such a yummy dish.  I made a few changes I added 3 eggs instead of 2, used all evaporated milk and no regular milk , doubled the chilies and used a medium spicy enchilada sauce.  I baked it in a 8x8 dish so it is nice and thick in the larger pan servings are not think enough.

Excellent! And, quick and easy! I wanted to make a meal from this so I browned a pound of extra lean ground beef with onions, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper. I then put a layer of the meat under each of the cheese layers. For the cheese, I used a 2-cup bag of shredded mexican cheese blend. Based on other reviews, I omitted the milk and used a 12-oz. can of evaporated milk, used 4 eggs, 3 tablespoons of flour and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I baked it in a glass 8x8 pan and cooked it longer as other reviewers did, but the pan was almost too full - probably because of the added meat. Next time I will stick to the 10x13 pan and try it with chicken. My hubby, who loves chili rellenos, loved this!

After reading the reviews, I also increased the eggs to 3 and just used the evaporated milk.  Didn't use as many chilies.  Very yummy and satisfying!  =)

Since this is a Mexican dish, it should be topped with something like enchilada sauce, either red or green, but not tomato sauce.

Instead of tomato sauce I added green sauce.  I even added extra green sauce.  The next time I make this i'm going to add cubed chicken and some pepper jack cheese.. I made this for a pot luck at my house,   I had no left-overs, all my friends wanted the recipe... great comfort food... 

 ok.  I've made this with chicken and pepper jack... soooo good...  plus I added extra cheese...  this casserole is wonderful

I give it a five stars with my alteration.   I used fresh chilis from my garden, put them under the broiler, then let them set to cool. Remove seeds and skin. However canned chilis would have been easier and I'm sure I'll use them come winter.   The "batter" needs to be doubled with the addition of 2 more eggs. Also, to make your own quick enchilada sauce (I didn't have it on hand, and tomato sauce alone sounded gross), use a can of tomato sauce + 1/8 c chili powder, 1/2 T oil and some water. Heat to boiling then simmer.  Of course the initial cooking time needed to be increased with the addition of ingredients. But it is wonderful and very similar -but easier - then chili rellenos that my DH makes.

This was terrific!  I read the comments, and amended the recipe as follows:  I used 4 eggs, beat the whites separately which made the consistency more like a real chile relleno.   I used 12 oz cheddar and 6 oz jack cheese, because this is what I had on hand.  I left out the 1/2 cup milk, and made my own tomato sauce from tomatoes in my garden (tomatoes, onion, garlic, celery, oregano, cumin, salt).  I used a 7X11 inch glass baking dish.    Of note, I forgot I had a small amount still left over a week later, heated it up in the microwave and had it for breakfast this morning.  I think it was even better than the first time!

This was tasty although I can't imagine how it would turn out if using the pan size specified in the recipe. I used an 8x8 dish and enchilada sauce as others suggested. Wish I had added an extra egg, too--it just wasn't enough for our family dinner. I recommend doubling it if you are planning to use it as the main dish.

This was oh so good.I doubled the recipe and still only had one piece left!I had to cook an extra 10 minutes because the middle wasn't done after 25 but that may be because i doubled it.Will make again only this time with shredded chicken to please all my meat lovers.

I used some of the other reviewers suggestions, like using 3 eggs, omitted regular milk, added 1 lb. browned ground beef and onion and broiled the cheese for 5 min. after baking. Oh! I also added about 1 tsp of ground cummin to the hamburger as it cooked. Wonderful. My wife loved it, too. And they are right. Its even better the next day reheated.

My family and I loved this casserole! It was very quick and easy to prepare. I have had this dish twice and prefer to make it with 3 eggs, enchilada sauce, and in an 8X8 pan.  I also omitted the regular milk.

This casserole was delicious!!!  I will definitely make it again.  I used some of the substitutions other reviewers made such as enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and jalapenos.  I also added ground beef with onions.  This was quick and very easy.  A winner in my home!

I LOVE this recipe!  I roast my chili's, add jalapeños and substitute salsa instead of tomato sauce.  It's great for breakfast, so I always double the recipe and I have a yummy treat for days to come.

UPDATE 12/2/18:  Low Carb Version:!  I omitted the flour and used Xanthan Gum instead.  Also substituted the milk and used a mixture of Sugar Free Almond Milk, half and half and heavy cream.  Still yummy!  Keto friendly!

I got this recipe over 30 years ago from a friend! Almost identical - 3 cans of whole chilies, generous 1/2 lb of jack, generous 1 lb cheddar, a large can evaporated milk, 4 eggs, 1 tsp salt, 2 Tbsp flour. 350 for 30 minutes. Then top with the can of tomato sauce mixed with a pinch of onion powder, oregano, small clove of garlic, salt and pepper. Stick back in oven for a few minutes. Yummy! We love it! Oh, I use a 9 x 13 pan.

Wow this was so delicious!!! I was a bit skeptical about this turning out eggy and breakfast-y, but I followed the advice of other reviews and only used the evaporated milk and 3 eggs, and a can of enchilada sauce. Eveyone loved this, and it tasted EXACTLY like Chili Rellenos!! Totally making this again! oh and by the way, I used fresh poblano peppers that I roasted instead of canned stuff.

I rated the recipe as written. 

It's a five star for me with these changes. I used a 27 oz can of whole chilis, halving them to spread them out. Doubled the egg mixture. Used enchilada sauce. Kept the cheese amounts the same. Broiled the last layer of cheese. And sprinkled on green onion before serving.

I made this tonight and served it as a complement to tacos. I only added 3 eggs and used only the evaporated milk. I also used enchilada sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and it was delicious. I did cook it 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for and I only used 1 8 oz bag of monterey jack cheese. Really great!

Only made three adjustments from the precious readers.  Added 3 eggs, used only evaporated and baked it in a smaller pan.  Also served it with sour cream.  Will be making this dish again for sure!

This was really easy to make and it turned out really well! I used 3 eggs instead of 2 because it didn't look like enough after I had poured on the 2 egg mixture. I also used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I served it with olives, tomatoes, salsa, avocado, lettuce, sour cream and chips with queso dip.

This was very good, it's a keeper. I put enchilada sauce on it as suggested. I'm thinking of adding a small can of rinsed and drained black beans and a cup of corn.

I cook this regularly I have used both canned and fresh chiles depending on what's in season.  The only thing I change is for the eggs I use 2 whole eggs and 1 egg white, mix some cumin and garlic powder in the egg mixture, enchalada sauce in place of the tomato sauce, and sprinkle some cheese and green onions on top after I take out of the oven.  Turns out fantastic every time!

Made for dinner tonight along with a taco rice casserole. Followed recipe as written. I think next time I will add 1 more egg though. My picky eater husband even ate it. There is half left and nobody else gets it but me.

This got rave reviews even from my 3 kids 11,12,13!! I used almost a whole large can of chilies( 27 oz) 3 eggs ,just the evaporated milk(about 6  oz)  8x8, and it did take a bit longer to set then the specified time. Then topped with enchilada sauce ,cheese, green onion and black olives. It was awesome and not too spicy for the kids. Oh I also just used Colby jack cheese. It looked so good I forgot to take a pic- next time!! Served with sour cream and Spanish rice!

This was AMAZING! I actually used 8 fresh poblano peppers (instead of canned) and roasted them over my stove burners - it made all the difference. I also took other reviewers' advice and used enchilada sauce. For the cheese, I used 8 oz of queso blanco and 4 oz of cheddar. And I used an 8x8' casserole dish. Garnished with scallions and diced fresh chiles. Cannot wait to make this again. When I do, I will use even more poblanos.

This was delicious.  I did some changes on other reviewers suggestions.  I used 12 poblano chills that I roasted, peeled, seeded, and opened up to place in a 9 x 9" dish.  I used 8 ounces of Jack, 12 ounces of Fresco (a Mexican cheese - not Cotija), and 4 oz. of white cheddar.  I used gluten free flour, and 3 eggs, separated.  I beat the egg whites separately and then lightly folded it into the beaten yolks, flour, and evaporated milk.  I did not use regular milk.  This made three layers, which I baked for 40 minutes, and then topped it with the remaining cheeses and tomato sauce that was "Mexican Style - that means spicy.  I also split olives the sunk them into the cheese for presentation.  I cooked it an additional 15 minutes until it was golden on top.

This was our Cinco De Mayo dinner also served  with fish tacos, black beans and rice.  We loved it.   My husband wants it again in a couple of days, because there were few leftovers.

Easy, peasy, and yummy. 3 eggs instead of 2. Eliminate regular milk; only use evaporated milk per recipe. 3 layers of chilies instead of 2, so it's easier to serve and looks great. El Pato enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Add green onions, olives, and small dollops of sour cream to garnish. Has been a hit at every potluck! Great recipe. Easy and delish, a win win. Thanks!

I loved this recipe. I followed other reviewers advice and used an 8x8 dish and wanted to use enchilada sauce. I didn't have enchilada sauce so I used a can of diced tomato and added chili powder, garlic powder, cumin stirred it together and put over the top in place of the tomato sauce. I also turned up the oven to broil the final cheese topping and added green onion to the top. The end product was amazing. This recipe is a keeper!!!

eh, it was ok. I read some of the other reviews and did it in a smaller dish with less cheese and omitted the milk and used the entire can of evaporated milk. the flavor was lacking... I would make this again just because it was so easy but I definitely would somehow figure out a way to incorporate more flavor.

Rather than use canned chile peppers, subbed 6 fresh Poblano peppers that were oven roasted (broiled skin side 5 minutes & flesh side 4 minutes, and then set aside to steam in a brown paper bag). Added an extra egg. Used 1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk instead of a 5 ounce can plus 1/2 cup milk which is seemingly an error in this recipe. The amount of milk is not overly critical if staying in a range of 7-12 ounces. The idea of using tomato sauce was unappealing so subbed 1 jar Herdez Traditional Chipotle Cooking Sauce and about a half jar of leftover hot picante sauce. After adding the tomato based sauces, topped with sliced black olives and fresh jalapeno peppers, and baked for the last 15 minutes. Topped off with cheese which was lightly misted with olive oil and returned to a turned off oven for 5 minutes. This was a big hit, and we will make again.

Echoing others, I too think the 1/2 cup milk called for is a mistake.
Having used the 1/2 milk in the recipe caused a last minute panic 
where I added additional flour to thicken the eggs, milk and flour
When not added, it's perfect, so therefore it's definately a mistake.

Copying some of what bansreeparikh suggested:  "8x8 pan, 3 eggs instead of 2, enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce, added some black olives and jalapenos on top, used only 8 ounces lower fat mexican cheese instead of 16 ounces"  I made my own enchilada sauce from a recipe I found here, the 10 minute enchilada sauce recipe, 
much better than store bought.

I followed the recipe except I used an 8 x 8 pan, and it came out mushy and the flavor was just okay. The texture probably would have been better if I had omitted the 1/2 cup of milk like other reviewers suggested. I will not make this again.

I have made this recipe several times now and every time no fail results.  I use fresh poblano chiles broil them on each side for 4 minutes and place  bowl with wet paper towels to cover until cool and easy to peel. I also use green enchilada sauce 1 cup instead of tomato sauce.  Use 8 x 8 dish and 3 eggs instead of 2.  Add veggie chorizo sometimes and so delicious!

Not sure why this received so many great reviews.  It's a little boring if you ask me.  I made the modifications that seemed popular, including- 8x8 pan, 3 eggs, evaporated milk only, and enchilada sauce.  I also added sliced black olives.  It definitely needs sour cream and some good salsa.  If you follow the recipe it looks nothing like the picture which includes green onions, olives, and tomatoes.

I made this for a retirement luncheon at work and it was a huge hit.  I made it in a 9x13 inch pan, used 16 ounces of cheese for the filling and another 8 ounces foer the top.  I also used enchiladas sauce instead on tomato sauce.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Yummy!!  I will be making again!!!

I'd have given three and a half stars if possible.  The taste was great but like another reviewer it was too soupy! Our solution was to use tortilla chips and scoop the "casserole" something like nachos.  I used 3 eggs, only the evaporated milk, roasted our own poblanos, enchilada sauce instead of tomato, and otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I would make it again tweaking for the liquidity.  Maybe adding another 
egg. Next time I'll try the ranchera sauce as suggested by a reviewer or make my own.  Good basic to start with.

This was very yummy after making a few adjustments.  Like other reviews, I used four eggs, only the evaporated milk, less cheese, and enchilada sauce.  I also used a smaller baking dish.  I served with a spanish style quinoa (stewed tomatoes, garlic, diced green chiles, black beans, and corn) so we could get some protein.  I will definitely be making this dish again!

Loved it.  Used a 8x8 dish, our own fresh roasted anaheim peppers and layered in a little pulled pork (Alton Brown's Hot Tamales recipe). MMMMMM.  What a great easy to modify casserole.

This was very good and cured my desire for some Chile Rellenos.  It is a very easy and quick recipe.  I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions.  Used 3 cans of chilis, 3 eggs and used enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  Couldn't see the point of the extra 2 T of milk.  Left it out.  I topped with a little sour cream and some chopped scallions.  This was quite good and I would definitely recommend.

I would have gave this a 5,  but i think it needs another can of chilis, or a smaller pan.  I used a 9x13 as called for,  but each can only has 3 chilis so the chilis were stretched kind of thin.  Flavor was is was really good! i could not find monteray jack without jalepenos, so i used weight watchers mexican shredded cheese and cheddar cheese.  It was simple to make, went well with fajitas and spanish rice i made.  I will make it again but with more chilis :)

As other reviewers suggested, I used 3 eggs, only the canned milk and enchilada sauce.  Served with Spanish rice and chips and salsa.  Great meal.

Very simple & delicious.  Used Enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce as recommended, and 3 eggs instaed of 2 & it turned out great.

OMG!  I used 5 Anaheim pepppers, sauteed to soften and since I didn't have any powdered milk around, I substituted a bag of corn muffin mix.  I wish I'd had some enchilada sauce on hand but rolled along with the tomato sauce and added some taco seasoning and chipotle powder to the tomato sauce for a little bit more punch.  All else was according to the recipe and it was FANTASTIC!  I served this to my vegetarian sister and her husband who really enjoyed it as well.  Will definitely make this again.

Chili Relleno is my favorite mexican dish and I cam across this receipe years ago in my mom's country home receipe book. I loved it I did not change anything just followed the directions. Taste just like Chili Rellenos; but as a casserole of course.

Awesome, easy and yummy. I added cooked ground beef. My bf says it would be good with sausage instead of beef too as a breakfast dish, maybe in a tortilla. I will make this one again for sure.

I didn't have enchilada sauce like other reviewers recommended so I added 1 Tbs. Chili Powder, 1 tsp. Cumin, and 1/2 Tbs. Vinegar to the 8oz. can of tomato sauce and it was delicious.  I also recommend whipping the egg whites till fluffy, mixing the yolks with the flower, and folding the yolk mixture into the whites and spreading on top, then baking.

Wonderful. Took other reviewers suggestions by using enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, 3 eggs instead of 2 and a full can of evaporated milk and 4 oz of each of the cheeses. My boyfriend said next time we will pat the peppers dry before putting them in the casserole because they came out a little soupy. Also we are going to top the casserole with salsa next time for an added twist. Over all, a winner that is going into our regular dinner rotation.

Chilis Rellenos are my husbands all-time favorite mexican food. In trying to help him lose some weight, we have stayed away from his favorite mexican restaurant. I used a 28oz can of Hatch's whole green chilis & used enchilada sauce instead of tomato. I also added an extra egg & cut the amount of cheese in half. My husband loved it!! I liked the flavors, not so much the textures. I will definitely make this for him again.

I made a few changes based on other chefs suggestions and it was super.  I added an additional egg, more cheese, and substituted mild enchalada sauce for the tomato sauce.    Delicious!  Everyone at our dinner party raved about it.  Tastes just like you would get at your favorite Mexican restaurant.

I think the only thing I changed was, I used fresh peppers. This was so good, my family of 6 really enjoyed it!! And this recipes was much easier than the traditional frying on the stove top + a little healthier- I really don't like to fry anything!

This was a wonderful recipe and so easy to make!  I made as other suggested some changes: I used 3 eggs and 1 can (12oz)of low fat evaporated milk instead of the 2 milks, I used Ro-Tel tomatoes with gren chilis instead of the tomato sauce, and added 1 t. cayenne pepper and 1/2 t. cumin to the tomatoes. I used only 8 oz of shredded Mexican four cheeses, and at the end, when I topped the casserole with the 2nd half of the cheeses, I placed under the broiler until the cheese was melted. I served topped with yogurt (did not have sour cream), black olives, chopped cilantro and slices of avocado - was a raving success at my house. definetely a "do it again" recipe! Thanks to Clarissa2 and others who contributed to make this a "perfect casserole".

Yuck. The texture of this was really funky. Diced chilies might be better than whole? I followed the recipe exactly, maybe should have used some of the modifications in the other reviews.

very good after a few tweaks...
i added 1 lb ground beef, cooked with chopped onion, i used only 1/4 cup milk, 4 cans la victoria mild fire roasted chile peppers, 4 eggs, chunky salsa instead of tomato sauce, and blended mexican cheeses..... i will fix this again but we really did not like having a huge taste of chile peppers in one bite so the next time instead of layering... i will combine all ingredients together, bake for 30min, then add salsa and remaining cheese on top......
thanks for the basic recipe....

We love this casserole.  For the milk mixture I used all half and half and added 1/4 cup of cornmeal because I thought a light corn taste would add to this, also used a drained can of Rotel tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  After baking for 25 minutes I layered with cheese then Rotel and topped with more cheese then baked another 15 minutes because I just wanted the cheese browned slightly for presentation.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Admittedly, I played with it by adding sauteed onions, garlic, chopped fresh cilantro and a tiny bit of chipotle in adobo to the tomato sauce.The evaporated milk was an interesting ingredient....and the "topping" had a light, crusty mouthfeel. Realy good!

Four instead of five stars cause I believe following the other reviews of this recipe really makes it great. I fire roasted Fresh Anaheim peppers and mixed the laying with only one can of peppers. The fresh peppers can't compare. Also, a great tip, I used Eggbeaters in stead of real eggs (3 portions) This made the egg batter topping really light and fluffy and they only take 3 seconds to whip in my kitchen aid. After adding the sauce, the egg stayed firm creating a great layered effect. I used med spiced encha sauce and this with the fresh peppers was a little too spicy for me, but I am quite sensitive. My boyfriend loved it.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I made a lot of changes.  I have used roasted poblanos, and roasted anaheims and both are great. Fresh is better than canned.  I have made it with canned to save time, but fresh is so much better.  I also omitted the 1/2 c. milk, and used green enchilada sauce in place of the tomato sauce.  I added the cheese on top before pouring on the sauce, then baked for another 15 minutes.  This is sooo good, something we crave if we don't have it for a while.

Excellent and easy - what could be better than that?  The only thing I did other than follow the recipe is add jalapenos and black olives on top.  Served with Mexican rice and salad with vidalia onion dressing - YUMMY!  I will be using this recipe again soon.

This was fabulous!  I left out the regular milk by mistake (didn't notice it in the directions!) and it was just fine.  I cut my chilis in half so they went a bit further.  This is a delicious vegetarian entree when paired with a side veggie.  I will definately make this again soon!

I took everyone's suggestions: 3 eggs, enchilada sauce, 1 lb. ground beef seasoned with cumin. It was good. Definatly needed the beef. My family liked it too - not outstanding or something to get too excited about, but worth trying for something different.

This was the hit of the entire dinner party.  I omitted the tomato sauce and added shredded chicken to the layers, but this has to be the easiest and the best cassrole.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.  Everyone from the party now has the recipe and the website.  Thank you for sharing Clarissa2

This was one of the easiest and most delicious things I've made in a while! I used the 8x8 pan per others' suggestion, and I really liked it that way. I broiled the last topping of cheese at the end so it was nice and bubbly. I'll definitely make this again!

My husband and I love chiles rellenos, and I have tried to make them in the past, but  they were just too much work.  This casserole is perfect for us.  It has the same taste, but it's so quick and easy.  I'm definitely adding it to my list of regular meals.  The only changes I made were to put it in an 8x8 pan and to halve the amount of cheese.  It came out perfect.  I think next time I'll try roasting my own hot chiles instead of using the mild canned ones.

My family did not enjoy this at all, but ate it because it's what I fixed.  To us it lacked in flavor.  Also I would like to add; in my opinion this recipe is poorly written and the video posted does not match the written instructions.  The recipe states use a 9x13 pan, the video states "small baking dish".  The recipe does not call for the peppers to be sliced open and laid out flat, but the video does just that.  The recipe calls for 2 eggs, the video uses 3.  The recipe calls for tomato sauce but the video uses enchilada sauce.  Allrecipe video editors, please take note of that.  Urgh!  I won't make this again.

The only 7 ounce chile green whole peppers I could find were Jalapenos.  Is that correct?  If so, this was so ridiculously spicy that we couldn't really eat it :(  How do I use non-spicy peppers?  Bummer!

I doubled this recipe and used the 9x13.  I used 2 cans diced chills and 2 cans whole chilies because that's what I had.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I didn't have any in the cupboard so I made "10 minute enchilada sauce" from this site.  Sooo good!  My daughter said she'd like it better if the next time I used just diced chills because she didn't like the large slices.  I will make again.  Very good!

Outstanding recipe, we added a few changes.  Added an 8 oz can diced green chiles into 1 1/2 lb ground beef, with fresh ground pepper, diced onion, onion powder, garlic powder and let rest overnight in a sealed baggie in the refrigerator.  Browned hamburger and added into the layering of the chile rellenos casserole.  We did add an extra egg to the mixture.

I feel hesitant leaving a bad review, because I've never had a chilli rellenos casserole before, so my distate for this recipe might be because I just don't like the dish. 

Its just a HUGE amount of cheese, there's really nothing to it.

I modified this recipe slightly and it came out great. I used 8 fresh poblano peppers sliced in half and grilled instead of canned chilis. I also used salsa instead of tomato sauce to give it more spice. I really love this dish because it is so flavorful.

i love it!  I especially like it when I get to mix my favorite Herdez salsa with equal parts of the tomato sauce!  Gives me goosebumps it's so delish! Even better the next day!  Heck, I eat it cold!  As for the Ench sauce?  I think it has a bitter taste to it.  If that's my only choice, I make brown gravy (from scratch) and mix them together about ench60%/gravy40%.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make, and has quickly become one of our new favorite dinner options. I'm making this when the in-laws come to visit next, I'll have lots of extra time to hang out and socialize because it's very quick to prepare.
This recipe is awesome, and definitely has some room for people who make frequent mistakes (like myself). For instance, I accidentally bought a much larger can of evaporated milk (12 ounces, gotta remember to read the label) and added almost all of it. I just added an extra egg, another tablespoon of flour and a little extra cheese. It was a happy accident, because it was still just as delicious as I expected it to be.
I also added some shredded chicken leftover from a store-bought rotisserie that we had the night before. It worked so well, this is definitely going into my permanent recipes.

Swapped out the tomato sauce for red enchilada sauce also roasted the chilies instead of using canned. This came together easily and quick and tasted fantastic. Roasting the chilies myself added time but I had the time to kill and prefer fresh foods over canned. Will be making this one a lot.

Halved the recipe and roasted  4 anaheim peppers by broiling till they turned black and rotated with tongs, as they turned put them in a pot with lid and let rest for 10 mins, to make easier to peel.  Didn't use a whole can of milk, cut back on the cheese by half and only used one can of red enchilada sauce, (maybe not all of it).  Really good with refried black beans and mexican rice.

Made this last night for dinner and the hubby loved it.  Small alterations, I browned a pound of ground chuck, seasoning it with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, cayenne, and paprika (Didn't have any taco seasoning so I had to improvise, then mixed it with some salsa con queso I had on hand.  I put this mixture in just after the cheese and before the second layer of green chilies.  I also used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce as other reviewers had suggested.  It was delicious!

I only gave it two stars because it is so heavy on cheese and lacks Mexican seasonings.  I suggest using Monterrey Jack cheese.  Into the cheese, mix some finely chopped green onion, a couple teaspoons of oregano, crushed.  Then, instead of tomato sauce, I'll use enchilada sauce.  Or mix a bit of tomato sauce with the enchilada sauce if you prefer.

Very, very yummy.  Really tasty and easy to makeI followed other reviewers and added more eggs:  2 whole eggs;  2 egg whites.  Changed to fat free evaporated milk and fat free cheddar.  Only used 8 oz of cheese and added olives to the top.  Used enchilada sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  And used one can of green chiles and one fresh green chile.  Will add this to my regular rotation.

Great recipe! I will make it again, and again. My mom is a seasoned chili rellenos consumer and thought it was amazing! I did make adjustments though. It calls for way to much cheese and to big of a pan, use a square and cook it a little longer. I also added black olives during the last minutes of cooking. Next time I am going to add three eggs and see how firm it gets and enchilada sauce. I will make this again and again and maybe try a layer of cornbread? Thank you.

There was no substance to this dish.  To me this would be better suited as an appetizer possibly rather than a main dish.  Perhaps using some shredded chicken and tortillas to give layers would make it better.  The taste was a bit lackluster, but that is why I try new things.

This is just like a chile relleno but much simpler to make.  I roasted and peeled the poblano peppers and only used the evaporated milk and El Pato sauce rather than the tomato sauce.  It exceeded my expectations!  This is a keeper and as one other reviewer stated, this will be an excellent breakfast as well.

It was amazing! I thought it was a nice, easy, and tasty meal. I followed the advice of others on this and changed the recipe just a tad. I used 3 eggs, only condensed milk, and only Mexican cheese. I also decided to add green onion, black olives, jalapeños, and sour cream to the top before I served it. I feel this dish would also be a good Mexican breakfast because of the eggs. Yumm!!!!

OMG. Delicious. I actually made homemade enchilada sauce. I got the recipe from Food Network... for the Chicken Enchiladas with Roasted Tomatillo Sauce. MMmmm! Will make again.

We had a very busy schedule tonight so I made this ahead of time.  I cooked the casserole last night and re-heated it in the oven tonight.  My family loved it- even my 14 year old went back for seconds and complimented me on a great dinner.  Its super easy to make, the ingredients should be available at any grocery store- even our commissary that can be limited on selection and it doesn't take a lot of effort to make.

I've done this a hundred times for an easy, one-dish dinner. I have a couple of variations that work really well, although the original is just great by itself. 
1. Roast your own, or use freshly-roasted chiles
2. Halve the portions for two
3. Use half and half instead of evap milk (skip the regular milk)
4. Use Trader Joe's RED enchilada sauce for a smokier, more robust version
5. Find a nice smoked cheddar for one layer for some added flavor

We really like this recipe and now have it regularly; it so much simpler than making regular rellenos and tastes just as good.  I've made it with both New Mexico and Poblano peppers which I've roasted (I usually use about 12 peppers) and both are equally delicious.  Also, I use Queso de Chihuahua instead of Jack.

This was fantastic! Rave reviews from all four of us! I gave it a 4 only because I made changes from the original - following the common suggestions - cook in an 8x8 pan, 3 eggs, 12 oz can of evaporated milk and no regular milk, enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I used a lot less cheese - because I was running short of time and couldn't grate a bunch of it. Delicious recipe with the tweaks. Thanks for sharing!

This is a very good foundation recipe. Great for using up your left overs. I did not have evaporated milk so I substituted half and half to 2/3 cup and omitted the milk. Use 3 eggs. My filling I use my left over long grain rice, and beef brisket thinly sliced into 1" length, added a can of black beans, chives from my garden,fresh corn and salt. I also used fresh pablano peppers, seeds removed unless you like it very spicy. I pan fried the peppers in a bit of olive oil in a cast iron pan. After searing the bottom of the peppers I added the egg mixture, followed by my rice filling and used Chihuahua cheese. I had some left over roasted red pepper sauce and added that to my tomato sauce 160z. I increased the amount of sauce due to the filling. Cooked as instructed and put the cast iron pan right in the oven. So easy and delicious!

I made it exactly to the recipe as written.  Wow!  Then I read the reviews and there are a lot of other things to do.  I was leary of using the big pan (too spread out) but did because of the cooking time.  I did not think plain tomato sauce would do anything for this recipe, but it did!!!  I have a similar recipe (I think), making 2 casseroles but I like the flat dish version .... easier to cut up and serve.  I need to find that recipe (over 30 years old) and compare the two.  I will be making this a lot .... we love it.

I think it is better with fresh home roasted Poblano chili's. Only takes 5 minutes under the broiler turning Chili's with tongs till they blacken. Then throw them in a paper bag to steam. Easy to peel. I used 6 for a 8x8 pan. The enchilada sauce is a must. I used a Lawry's Enchilada spice package with a small 8 oz can of Hunts tomato sauce. Was very mild. Victoria in the glass jar has a bit more of a kick. Used 3 eggs. DEFINITELY separate out the yolks and whip the whites till they are fluffy. Then blend the yolks, flour & milk together and fold it into the whites. Makes a big difference. I only had 2% milk so I reduced the amount a little. Can see how the evaporated would make the casserole richer but it was still good without. Add sliced black olives & chopped green onions on top. Was really delicious. Wonderful that you don't have all those calories in there from frying.

I am eatting this as I rate it!  So delicious and easy!  I did make a few adjustments recommended by others:  
I used an 8x8" casserole dish, used a 12oz can of evaporated milk (and no regular milk), 3 eggs instead of two, cooked it for 25 minutes, then topped it with El Pato brand tomato sauce with jalapenos (using just part of a small 7-3/4oz can), and cooked it for 15 minutes more.  I used diced ortega chilies (because that is what I had in the pantry).  I highly recommend this for it's taste and how quick and easy it was to make.  This is a good option for breakfast,or...as a lunch or dinner side dish or main course...My kind of recipe!

I made this for the first time tonight. It was delicious and so easy. I roasted some Hatch Chilies and instead of tomato sauce, I did enchilada sauce. I took the advice of some others and used 3 eggs. My picky eaters loved it.

Enjoyed this dish.  After reading some of the other reviews, I used 3 eggs and used Mexican Tomato Sauce.  Also used only 12 oz. of Monterey Jack Cheese, no Cheddar.  Thank you.

This was absolutely fabulous and easy peasy to prepare...I highly recommend this recipe and thank you so much Clarissa for sharing this recipe. no changes were necessary, but we can think of a few additions that might be nice to add... like shredded chicken in the recipe maybe topped with some sour cream and scallions, but overall an absolute delight and a party in my mouth!

Oh my goodness!  This was so good!  I used poblano peppers and made my own sauce.  I boiled 2 large roma tomatoes with a 1/4 of an onion.  Then blended it adding a teaspoon of chicken bullion and a tablespoon of dried oregano. 
I will be making this again!

This casserole is amazing!  I love Chili Relleno, but can't handle the heat.  So I buy mild fresh chili's, remove the seeds, cut them up and put them under the broiler.  Then I make the recipe just as it calls for and it comes out wonderfully!!

I used fresh poblano chilis (3 lg) I roasted them 1st & removed the outer skin ( preheat broiler to 500 degrees f, then roast the chilis 10-15 minutes, turning chili's 2-3 times to roast evenly) outside of that, the rest of the recipe was really good, I will double the peppers & will triple the eggs, milk & flour next time just because I thought it wasn't filling enough this way, (& cuz we all wanted more)really REALLY good. :)

Based on all the positive reviews, I couldn't wait to make this. It even took me 3 supermarkets to find the big cans of whole chilies. However, this dish was a huge letdown. None of my family would eat it. I thought the "crust" mixture would do more for the recipe than it did. It didn't thicken up or cover any of the casserole. It just ran through the casserole and didn't do much of anything. Also, green chilies are not what are used in Chili Relleno. I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I definitely will not be making this again. From now on, I will go to my favorite restaurant

This is a darn good dish! I just made it in the toaster oven. I followed the suggestions and only did the canned milk. I used El Pato tomato sauce, which is nice and spicy.
I will make this again!

Wow is this awesome and easy. I made it almost exactly as written. Only change was using a 2% Mexican cheese blend and a couple more green peppers. Wife thought it had too much cheese (she's not big on cheese) so I'll use less cheese next time to try to cut down on the calories as well. But am I ever happy I found this recipe!

Pretty good - I added an extra egg, eliminated the regular milk and used enchilada sauce, per previous reviews. My boyfriend loved it, but I felt like there was something slightly missing...

Received rave reviews on this dish when taken to a family dinner.  As others suggested I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato for the topping.  Looks pretty also!

I tried the original way,  than I looked at the plain old tomatoe sauce no spices, no flavor...and put that aside, I love Las Palmas Red Chili sauce...not enchelada sauce..it is too sweet...to use less salt, do not salt to taste, or use less cheese, or find lower salt content cheeses,mozerella is a good choice.  with these changes it makes it a 6!

I made a few of the recommended alterations:  I used a 12 oz can of condensed milk instead of the condensed/regular milk combo called for in the recipe.  I also used more cheese than called for as I like cheesy mexican food.  I used 3 eggs instead of 2 (the mix was very watery and other comments said use 3).  AND I used enchilada sauce vs. tomato.  This was just OK for me.  I think I would make it again but alter it to be more of a dip instead of a meal.  DEFINITELY either use a smaller pan or more chiles because I used 15oz chiles and only had enough for one layer.

I made two alterations based upon other reviewers' recommendations: 3 eggs instead of two and used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I thought it was extremely tasty - I just wasn't thrilled with the texture. Next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I will probably add a few browned hashbrown potatoes or a little browned ground beef. Overall, a very nice dish.

I used extra chilies, added chicken, and an additional egg. I think next time I will add even one more egg. It was really good. My fiance and roommate enjoyed it. I will be making this one again for sure.

Quick and easy! I used 4 tbsp of Bisquick instead of flour and fresh fire roasted chilies that I bought at the farmer's market. I had extra chilies left so I blended them with some fresh garlic and the tomato sauce and poured it on top. My daughter ate 3 helpings!

This is really really good!!!  It's more of a side dish than a main meal.  It would be great with black beans or Spanish Rice.   I made this with 3T flour, 2 eggs 1 egg white, omitted the 1/2 c milk and added a slightly more than 5 oz of evaporated milk.  I used enchilada sauce, almost a full can. I used less than the 16 oz of cheese.  I used an 8x8 pan and cooked it for 30 min the first time and 15 min after adding the sauce and then i put it back in till the cheese melted.  It comes out a bit like a green chilies quiche with sauce on it.  Very good.  I will make again!!

I made some changes that others suggested.  Used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, 12 oz. evaporated milk instead of 5 oz. and omitted regular milk.  Trying to stay away from fried foods and this was a good alternative and very tasty.

Based on the reviews, this does look like a love or hate and I hate to say it but we didn't care for this at all.  I tried it as is except using only all evaporated milk like some suggested and the whole thing was weird.  You start off with cheese and thats always good but then you get a big bite of raw tomato sauce, heading downhill there, and to top it off you get a weird custard texture mixed in with chilis. These things don't go together at all in my opinion.  My husband gave me that apologetic "I'll try to eat it if you want me to but I REALLY don't want to" face so I told him to toss it and I followed suit...that rarely happens in this house.  I'm sorry but I won't be making this again.

It tastes like chili relenos without the labor intensive individual ones.  My casserole was DENSE, because I left out the 1/2 cup milk.  The next time I make this recipe, I will BEAT THE EGG WHITES TILL FLUFFY, and fold in the canned milk/flour.

Should be 10 stars!! This is one of my most favorite recipes on this site. We love chili rellenos but don't like to deep fry. This has the same flavor but much easier and not as greasy. LOVE IT!! We use Hatch chilies - the BEST. You might want to double the recipe and so you have some for breakfast.

I have been making a recipe similar to this one for years. I use fresh anaheim peppers from my garden and char them and peel them. I put corn tortillas on the bottom of my pan and then layer the chili's and cheese. I saute up mushrooms, onions, garlic and jalapeno pepper and put that inside the chili's. I put the marinara sauce right over the chili's and cheese, pour egg mixture and put more cheese.

Very good. I followed advice of previous reviews and added 4 eggs, a 12 oz. can evaporated milk, enchilada sauce, 3 tablespoons of flour and left out the 1/2 C milk.  Consistency was smooth and so creamy tasting. Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it for my wife on Valentine's Day.  I added 1 tsp. of chili powder and 1/4 tsp. of cumin to the evaporated milk, egg, and flour mixture for extra flavor.  As others suggested, I substituted mild enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce.  My wife wants me to make it again.

I used Enchillada sauce and black olives, too. Next time I'll add some fresh cilantro. I did something silly, thinking that the egg & milk weren't setting up so I gently stirred. Turned out more like scrambled eggs, oops! Super fast and easy to make!

This was a good recipe enjoyed by all.  As another reviewer stated, I used 3 eggs, and the amount of green peppers seemed a little small, so you may want to add another can or two.  I thought it seemed like a lot of cheese, but it was just right.  Enchilada sauce or mole would be good in place of the standard tomato sauce.

This is simply amazing. Key word: SIMPLE. Super simple. Only changes I made were to add chunks of chicken to make it a hearty meal, added cumin, pepper, and chili powder to the tomato sauce for spice, cut out the 1/2 cup of milk (used only 5 oz evaporated), and used green chili I roasted myself in the oven. I topped the whole thing off with sliced black olives after adding the tomato sauce and cheese the last 15 minutes. I increased the cooking time to 35 minutes before adding the tomato sauce since I used an 8"X6" pan. Lastly, I sprinkled the cheese in each layer until it looked like enough. I ended up using about half of what the recipe called for, but it was plenty.

Pretty good.  I did the 8x8 and omitted the 1/2 c of milk.  I used regular tomato sauce, but will use enchilada sauce next time for a little more flavor.  Oh, and I didn't use as much cheese.  Husband liked it too.

This was very yummy.  A quick way for my favorite dish "Chili Rellenos".  I am used to the old fashioned way I learned from the Mexican Sunset book from the 50's.  I used an 8x 8 square pan and used 4 eggs, beat for about 2 minutes, and added Enchilada sauce at the end of the cooking time.  I used 2 packages of 8oz shredded Mont. Jack cheese.  I wasn't worried about calories or fat for this, my favorite meal.  GREAT recipe and THANKS for the great, easy rendition of a fav of mine.  ;)

I took liberties with this recipe and started with a layer of enchilada sauce, then a layer of refried beans, then a layer of steamed swiss chard, then a layer of fresh roasted green chilis, then just a fraction of the cheese from the recipe, and finally, I did add one egg to the 'batter' on top.  I did add enchilada sauce at 20 minutes, and cooked it an additional 10-15 than the recipe said- since I added so much other stuff.  It was good- but next time I would add salt and pepper to the dish before it was put in the over.  Nice and hearty, but light, and my 20 month old was asking for seconds!

This was super good!  It was not spicy at all.  I followed many of the suggestions mentioned by other reviewers:  I used an 8x8 dish (this was perfect...prepared this way, there were only 4 modest servings), 1/2 the amount of cheese (I put 1/2 of it on at the beginning and the rest on at the end and put it back in the oven), 3 eggs instead of 2 and 1/2 the amount of regular milk it called for.  I also baked it for 10 minutes more than called for.  It was ooey, gooey and delicious...did I mention super easy to prepare?  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe made this novice cook like like a pro!  I have a gas stove so I fire-roasted 5 large Poblano peppers & then chilled them to take the skin off.  5 Poblanos was enough to make one good layer in a 9x13 pan next time I'll use 8-9 so I can get a second layer (or perhaps 6-7 & using a smaller pan as suggested). I used tomato sauce but mixed it with an authentic morita salsa - it was very yummy but in the future I'll try just using the salsa but using only a thin layer about half or less than what the recipe calls for.  I just want a clean tasting relleno & I thought the tomato sauce was a bit too much.  I used less cheese as well & I use pepper jack, mozerella & chedder.  Next time I'll try using 3 egg whites & use my mixer so it'll be fluffier.  I only gave to a four star because I made some changes.

I used poblanos... cut them up and popped them right in thinking that they would soften during cooking. They didn't. They were crunchy and I didn't care for that. The overall flavor was really good and we ate it all but I'll roast the peppers first next time.

I made many of the adjustments that previous reviewers had suggested...I halved the cheese, added 3 eggs instead of 2, and cut out the regular milk completely.   I also added 2 breasts of shredded chicken and topped the casserole with green enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  The flavor was great, and my only complaint was that I still thought there was too much cheese in it (too greasy; next time I will add even less cheese).  This casserole would taste great as a burrito filling wrapped in flour tortillas!

I followed some other reviewers that added 1 egg , halved the cheese and omitted the regular milk.
I also roasted fresh Anaheim peppers myself. I whipped the egg whites with a mixer and added the rest when they were stiff while whipping . I substituted Picante sauce for the tomato sauce.
Poured half of the batter in the pan, layed half the peppers, half the cheese and then the rest of the peppers, batter and cheese. Turned out GREAT!!

This was sooo yummy. My whole family enjoyed it, even my picky brother. The only thing I changed was using a smaller baking dish, 8x8. And I found a can of Mexican style tomato sauce instead of the plain. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Great recipe!  Instead of the evap. milk, I added an extra egg, used 1 cup milk, and 1/2 cup flour.  I also only used half the cheese and used an extra can of chilis.  We LOVED it!!

I thought this recipe was great, and turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.  I am always looking for meatless main dishes and wondered how a main dish with green chilies for its focal point would turn out, but it was super!  I made it almost exactly as it was written, one minor change is that I sliced up the chilies into somewhat smaller pieces so I could spread them out over the pan a little more.  Also, I did bake it for about 10 more minutes than instructed, as my own personal adage for casseroles, etc., is "bake until it's bubbly," and after topping with the final cheeses, I put it back in the oven for about 3 minutes until they were melted.  I didn't have any trouble with it turning out runny; it came out more like the texture of a souffle or omelet.  I served it with a side of green chili and lime refried beans topped with more shredded Cheddar cheese, and it made a wonderful meal.

This is a great, quick and easy recipe for a chile relleno-like dish. I also do mine in an 8x8" pyrex, add the extra egg and use half the regular milk. I do like it better with enchilada sauce as opposed to tomato, though. (I use the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce recipe, also on this site). Thanks for the post, Clarissa2.

I came home from church one Sunday and wanted a quick and easy something for brunch. I tried this recipe and couldn't have been more pleased. The only disappointment was when I was too full to eat any more. EXCELLENT AS IS, but easy enough to customize for personal tastes. I know I will be making this regularly.

I took others' suggestions and used a 8x8 pan, 3 eggs, and enchilada sauce.  No regular milk. I think it would would be great using only one layer of the chilis as well.  I will try that next time.  My husband and I love this recipe.

I did make one slight change to the recipe - instead of tomato sauce, I used red enchilada sauce. It added a little bit of spice. I fixed this for my Mexican food-loving husband and he absolutely loved it!  My parents are in Colorado now and have promised to bring back some of the wonderful roasted chiles that you can get at the various truck farms outside of Pueblo.  I can't wait to try this recipe with those chiles! This one is definitely a keeper!

YUM!! This is wonderful!  The only thing I did different was use enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. (I used the 10 min enchilada sauce from this site).  I would have like the cheese to have been browner on top.  This is very rich, but very good!!

Like many others I made this casserole in an 8X8 pan with three eggs, without the 1/2 cup of plain milk and we added about 2tbsp chili powder and 1 1/2 tsp cumin powder to the tomato sauce. I served it with a simple store bought taco sauce for those who thought it needed more kick. I liked it plain. It was easy to make and had a wonderful flavor. Definately a recipe I'll start incorperating into my menu.

This was great! Like a few others, I didn't use tomato sauce but enchilada sauce. I also doubled the recipe but still used a 9x13 pan -- I think it would have been a little too thin for my taste had I not. 
Yummy!! Thanks

I've made this dish several times now; my husband loves it! I did follow the suggestions of several other reviewers and made a few changes: I use an 8x8 dish, 3 eggs, about 8 ounces of pepperjack cheese for the layers, and half of a 20-ounce can of red enchilada sauce. With the enchilada sauce I sprinkle on a couple of handfuls more of pepperjack cheese with some sliced black olives and sliced green onions and return to the oven for 15 minutes. I serve it with a Spanish rice recipe also from this site, mixed Mexican vegetables (sautéed corn, zucchini, green and/or red pepper with onion and garlic) and a tossed green salad. I keep this dish in our monthly rotation because it is delicious! Leftovers make a great lunch next day, too. Thank you to the original poster, and thank you to all the reviewers for the tasty modifications.

So good!! I made this for the first time last night and...oh my gosh, I get to have something in the Northwest  that actually tastes like chili rellenos! I used an 8 x 8 pan like others suggested. No milk. I used 4 egg whites (no yolks), which I mixed/whipped into peaks & I also whipped my  evaporated milk and flour (already had the mixer out, so why not?),  and then folded my whites into the evaporated milk mixture.  I used sharp cheddar & pepper jack cheese.  For the tomato sauce, I pureed 1 can of Mexican stewed tomatoes, added a dash of cumin and a heaping teaspoon of (crushed) Mexican oregano.  After taking the casserole out of the oven, I let it set for about five minutes and then sprinkled scallions & cilantro on top. This is a wonderful and simple recipe that can easily be changed up to personal taste. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to find a good brand of canned chile's online , (we're somewhat limited in choices at my local grocery store here), or I'll buy some fresh and roast. Thanks so much for the recipe! My Mother was from Texas, and I grew up eating good Mexican food; tastes like home.  :)

It was good. I made it twice. The first time I added enchilada sauce on only half of the casserole. My husband can't eat a lot of spicy food. He liked it. The second time I added the full amount of cheese recommended in the recipe and I added a little too much enchilada sauce on top. It was good but a little messy.  The crowd ate all of it.  I only got a tiny piece.  I think I will keep playing with the recipe.

Hubby said this was a keeper! I too followed several of the suggestions in previous reviews. I only used 8 ounces of cheese, I used three eggs, I used a whole can of evaporated milk and no regular milk, and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I topped it with some sliced black olives and a few diced jalapeños.  I also baked it 10 minutes longer than the original recipe called for.  It was delicious and I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers for dinner again tonight.

I've made this 3 times and have tweaked it until I think it's just right. I didn't want to change it from being a chili relleno flavor so I didn't add anything different like several reviewers did. I doubled the green chilies and cheese, but I only increased the milk and flour by 1 1/2 times, doubled the eggs and then cooked in a 9x13 pan. Baking the cheese until browned renders the cheese too tough, so I'll just quickly broil it next time. It needs a little salt in the flour/milk mixture. The tomato sauce isn't an authentic flavor for chili rellenos, so I left that off. Like someone else said, you need to cook it 10-15 minutes longer and let it set for 10 minutes before serving.

WOW! Tremendous taste.  A few changes as suggested by others: Used 8x8 pan (had to cut the chiles open to cover the bottom of the pan); used 3 eggs, separated (whipped whites, folded into the remaining ingredients), 12oz can of evaporated milk (no regular milk), 3T flour, 10oz can Rotel chopped tomatoes with green chilis (drained) instead of the tomato sauce. Added 10 minutes to initial cooking time. Topped with remaining cheese, sliced olives and chopped green onion for the last 15 minutes of cooking. 
No way this could have filled-in a 9x13 pan, so next time (and there will be a next time!!) I'll use a #10 can of whole chilis, 5 eggs, both types of milk (12oz evap. milk + 1/2cp milk), 1/4cp flour, and 2 cans of the Rotel [personal preference :) ].
All in all, Great recipe. Will make this as often as my housemate will allow.

I appreciate the submission of the recipe, but  we did not care for this at all. I did add the enchilada in place of the tomato sauce.... this was soupy, way to cheesy and had no foundation.
Thanks anyhow.

I will make it again.

It tasted good; my husband enjoyed it and said it was better than many restaurants because sometimes the restaurant batter is just too egg-y.  However, my biggest complaint is that the recipe itself did NOT match the video.  An extra egg was added to the video, no regular milk (as opposed to evaporated milk) was added; a different sauce was used, etc.  The owner of the recipe/video needs to decide which is the more correct recipe and ensure that the video and printed recipe are the same.

My wife has made "the real thing" for years  and frankly I like this recipe better as it holds together much better; not as saucy.  I stuck to the ingredients exactly. Only change made was the last step adding the remaining cheese and serving. Instead,  I "stung" the cheese under the broiler until brown, bubbly, and slightly crispy. Absolutely love this recipe! Thank You!

This is delicious!  As others mentioned, I used an 8x8 pan, enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, and 3 eggs instead of 2.  Also added black olives on top of the final cheese and broiled it.  Served with "best Spanish Rice".  Fantastic!

I absolutely loved it. Great with rice, beans, and chips.  You can dress it up however you want to. I'll make it again and again.  Husband said, however, that it "tasted like the tv dinner version of chile relleno."  But my husband doesn't like ANYTHING. So the fact that he ate it and thought it was "ok," actually means to normal humans that this is an excellent recipe.

Truly delicious and easy. I used roasted poblano peppers and added one can of diced tomatoes & chilis to the mix as well. Because this is a meal all by itself I used the 3 eggs instead of two to get that extra protein. I left out the 1/2 cup of milk; had I added it would have been WAY too runny. Also cut the cheese down to about 10 ounces instead of the suggested 16. I also used tomato sauce because I'm not a huge fan of enchilada sauce. If you're going to try this recipe, I highly suggest watching the accompanying video beforehand to get an idea of what you want to do. This is definitely going to be a repeat recipe for me as I LOVE poblano peppers! Thank you!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  I use recipes on Allrecipes primarily for ingredient combinations and seasoning ideas, and also for proper proportions.  So I will usually make a few personal "tweaks" to suit our tastes.  I think a good recipe should be able to stand up to that.  It never bothers me that folks will make changes.  That said, I kept pretty close to the original recipe.  I liked the idea of adding chicken, so did that, and used enchilada sauce instead of tomato.  Also, I misread the recipe and used 3 eggs, but it didn't seem to be a problem.  To minimize the fat, I reduced the cheese by about a third.  Four stars for lack of much seasoning.  Needed a little bit of, at least, salt and pepper?  But I will make it again  :)

After reading some of the comments, I do agree with 3 instead of 2 eggs, and no regular milk. I added a layer of browned ground beef (shredded would be even better) between the chilis and cheese.  I garnished with lettuce, tomatoes, and a few chopped black olives on top. Guests have always loved this.

So...I changed it up a bit. 8x8 dish. No tomato sauce.
6 eggs, half the cheese (only jack cheese) a tablespoon of jalapeño sauce. Layered 1 small can of chopped chiles on bottom filled 3/4th of shredded cheese. Topped with another small can of chopped chiles. Poured egg mixture over all and topped with the remaining cheese. Baked 45 minutes until golden on top. Excellent, almost soufflé taste!
Served with salsa and sour cream.

Good stuff. I followed the alterations suggested in the video, using a smaller casserole dish, using three eggs, omitting the extra milk, replacing the tomato sauce with enchilada sauce, and broiling the cheese at the end. It came out great, and my family loved it.
I served it with some Rice-a-roni Spanish Rice on the side.

Having heeded several of the other reviews, I too used 3 eggs, red enchilada sauce and an 8X8 casserole dish. Overall, it was very tasty, but was still a bit too runny when served up. To tighten it up, I might add a little extra flour, or use less milk, next time.

This was pretty good. My husband and I liked it, but kids didn't. I followed other reviewers' advice and used only a can of evaporated milk (12oz), 4 eggs instead of 2, and enchilada sauce in place of tomato. I baked it a little longer too because of the extra eggs. I also used chopped chilies because that was all I had.  It was quick and easy and cheap. Only problem was the kids not liking it.

I used my own roasted poblano peppers that I had grown and froze after roasting.  Also had some leftover taco meat in the freezer that I layered on the peppers before the cheese.  I was going to use an enchilada sauce but was out, so I made my own and it was actually much better.  Best of all, there were 2 pieces left over and we had them for breakfast the next day with poached eggs on top. Delicious!

This was SO SO SO SO easy to make and my boyfriend LOVED it. He is a Chile Rellenos fanatic as it is a dish from his heritage that his mom makes for him and his favorite. To know that this satisfied the taste for him and I even got a compliment too, wow. SO IMPRESSED! Made as the recipes states!

Really good reminder of chili rellenos.  Was really debating what size dish to use.  Doesn't seem like enough food for a 9 x 13.  Finally watched the video.  Huh!  I didn't know videos could be different from the recipe.  They used an 8 x 8 (or smaller) dish, 3 eggs and enchilada sauce.  I followed their advice and it came out great.  Thanks!

Made this last night and it was a HUGE hit even with my vegetable averted 12 yr old!! He looked at it and was like 'ew, what are these green things?'. Then tried it and was quickly asking for seconds! I roasted my own (4) poblano peppers (mainly because I don't even know where I would get canned whole green chiles?), used ONLY 1/2 C of half and half instead of evaporated milk cause that's what I had on hand and added about 1/2 C diced onions, salt, pepper, chili powder, and cumin, 3 eggs, and used Rotel over the top, and did it all in an 8x8 pan, it was super tasty! So I guess I should probably write my own recipe and submit it since i pretty much changed the whole thing!

This is similar to my Chili Rellenos Casserole - the differences are that I use 1 and 1/2 cup of each cheese, the canned milk only, and 4 eggs. I also use chopped green chilis, that way you won't inadvertantly pull an entire chili out when dishing up!
No sauce on top, just hot sauce and chopped green onions, sour cream, etc. on the side. If I want to make it a main dish meal I add 1/2 to 1 lb of browned ground beef, and just layer it along with everything else. This is an endlessly adaptable recipe!

I liked it, but I changed it.  I followed the recipe for 6 people and this is what I did.  Instead of 2 eggs, I used three. Probably could have used 4.  Just used the evaporated milk, not the regular milk.  Cut cheese way back, only using 8 oz. of Colby Jack total. Used a smaller pan 11x7. I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and added chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder and cumin to taste. When I added the cheese at the end I turned off the oven and let the casserole sit in the oven for 2 - 3 minutes to make sure cheese was melted.  Let it sit for 10 minutes before cutting. It fed three hungry people with enough leftovers for 2.

I roasted my own poblano peppers so that may have made a difference.  although I was scepticle I have to say this was awesome!  Try it you won't be disappointed!  I used canned red enchilada sauce in place of the tomato sauce which worked fabulously.  Will definitely make again.

love it!- I have made this recipe a couple times. I tweaked it a tad and used fresh Anaheim peppers instead of chilis....so not really chili rellenos anymore but it made it so tasty and it added a crunch. I also made enchilada sauce in place of the tomato sauce. The second time I made it I added corn and black beans-delicious! Very versatile, great recipe!

This was fantastic! The wife couldn't get enough, and it help up really well as leftovers. Gotta read the ingredient list carefully, as the can sizes (especially the evaporated milk) aren't the most common.  Had a little enchilada sauce left over from chicken tortilla soup, so used that rather than tomato sauce.  It was just right to finish off the dish.

I wish I had read the reviews for suggestions before I made this...Don't get me wrong, its fine as is...It's quick, easy, and flavorful. But it does need something... I skipped the tomato sauce and used salsa.  I also added an extra egg.  I think next time I'll put some seasoning in the eggs...cumin, maybe some green onions???  The leftovers are excellent in tortillas with fresh salsa!

This was delicious! I made a few improvements as others had suggested which included a smaller pan. Next time I will definitely add enchilada sauce instead of tomatoes. I also added some cooked ground beef before baking which was awesome. It turned it into a little more like a chili relleno from a Mexican restaurant. YUMMY!

We really liked this. I added 1 lb ground beef, 1/2 a chopped onion (sautéed)', an extra egg and I just used 12 oz evaporated milk and no regular milk. I used 2 full cans of whole green chilies. I added cumin and garlic salt to the meat and onion as I cooked it. I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and it turned out great. I did use a 9x11 dish and with the meat it was perfect size. Will definitely make again!

I made this dish while on the Atkins diet. I lessened the amount  of flour and used half evaporated milk and the rest half and half. DELICIOUS!!!!  I remained in ketosis and continued to lose weight while eating all of this yumminess!

Winner! Winner! I made this yesterday and I love it. I did half the cheese and used Bisquick instead of flour and it turned out great. Definitely will make this a regular at my house even for company. Thank you Clarissa2.
4/29/18 Update...I’ve made twice with fresh roasted Poblano peppers (12) and the results were awesome.

This looks like it was taken right out of my cookbook.  You can use Mexican tomato sauce that has a kick to it, but most of the people I make it for are gringos and cannot tolerate anything that spicy so I use plain tomato sauce.  Enchilada sauce is a great substitute.  I like all the extra toppings too.  I'm usually too busy to take the time for the garnishes but I love them.  I've been using this recipe for more than 30 years.  Most everyone loves it as written and most think it is spicy enough with just the green chillies, although I get fresh ones and roast and peel them, but most the folks I know don't have any idea what real Mexican food tastes like.

I will make this again and again. My husband just loves it and I know he's eating the leftovers for lunch today. I also used an 8x8 pan, 3 eggs, and most of a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk. For the final topping, I emptied out a 8 oz. can of El Pato spicy tomato sauce and sprinkled cilantro on top of the cheese. Muy bueno!

I watched the video. It looked like the casserole was topped off with mole poblano sauce not tomato sauce. Tomato sauce would be a boring finish to the recipe.

Should have been good, but it was a hot mess. Perhaps it would be best made in a 9X13 dish I don't know, but that seemed way too big, so I took other reviewers' advice and used an 8X8. Also omitted the plain milk and just added the whole can of evaporated (why waste it?) and used half the cheese, which was enough. Used roasted hatch chiles. Came out a soupy mess, even after cooking it longer and letting it rest. I sprinkled some cilantro and green onions on it to see if that made any difference in taste and it relly didn't add anything. won't be making again.

Love this recipe.  When I go to a Mexican restaurant, I always order chili rellenos.  I could not find the cans of whole green chile peppers in any of my stores, so I bought 10 fresh poblano peppers and roasted them and then peeled the skins off and scraped the seeds out. I also used enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  Everyone at my dinner party loved this recipe.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Not sure if I should rate this five stars only because I did use the recommended changes and did not make this according to the original recipe. With the changes recommended in the "Most Helpful Positive Review" it is an amazing recipe. I paired it with the Spanish rice and my family loved it.

Even better the day after!  Made this with 1lb. ground beef.  Browned the beef with diced onion and cumin and added it before the second layer of peppers.  I couldn't find whole canned peppers, so I roasted fresh poblanos and used them instead.  Like others, I used enchilada sauce in place of the tomato sauce the recipe calls for and I broiled the top layer of cheese to melt it.  Very good!

Very tasty with the tweaks from other reviewers:  3 eggs, evap milk only, less cheese, and I added seasoned ground beef as well.   Yum!  Great the next morning with a fried egg on top too.

This is a great meatless entree or side dish.  It was surprising how good it tasted.  Did take into action other reviewer comments such as using enchilada sauce, only using evaporated milk and egg whites only.  It was a big hit.

I made a lot of changes, based on the reviews, so I don't know how accurate my rating is to the original recipe. I used four small roasted poblano peppers, PLUS four small cans of diced green chiles, pepper jack cheese, four eggs, omitted the regular milk, baked in an 8x8 pan until the eggs were set (added about 10 mins to the first cooking time), and made a homemade enchilada sauce out of the can of tomato sauce (Homemade Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site) for the top. We really liked the results.

This is absolutely fantastic.  I used Hatch green chiles that I had roasted and frozen myself and instead of the tomato sauce I topped with a red enchilada sauce.  So good and easy.

Very tasty, and it was so easy to put together.  Next time I might just try all evaporated milk and one extra egg to see if it firms up more.  I had a 10 oz can of enchilada sauce so I used it in place of tomato sauce.  I bet the leftovers will taste even better tomorrow.

These are really good and easy to make I would recommend enchilada sauce as well, just not enough kick. Also drain the chillis well, or it can come or a little runny

Roasted our home-grown poblano peppers for this.  Used the 8 x 8 pan and just the evaporated milk.  Whipped the egg whites separately, then combined the yolks and milk and flour, folded them into the whites.  Enchilada sauce on top.  Rave reviews, and great with eggs the next morning, IF you have any leftovers.

My family loves this dish. I changed it a bit. I sauteed one medium onion and spread it in the chilis before I poured the egg milk mixture. I also added granulated garlic for more flavor.

I tried to incorporate a couple suggestions from the reviews:  (1) I used 3 egg whites and 1 yolk, (2) I used all evaporated milk rather than half regular milk, and (3) I used enchilada sauce (and when I found that quite runny as I was adding it, I stopped and switched to tomato sauce).  I found the egg/flour/milk mixture turned out a little too fluffy and a little too sweet (wasn't bad, just wasn't quite right for chile rellenos).  Otherwise I really enjoyed this!  So if I use this recipe again, I'll stick to the recipe entirely.

Flavor was good but it came out as a soupy mess. I noticed that some reviews said only 5 oz evap. Milk but some said the entire can of 12 oz so I was confused. I used the whole can and maybe that is why. I cooked it longer than suggested when I noticed that it wasn't firming up, but that didn't help. I did notice that when I pit the leftover away that it was a little better, so letting it rest might help.

This is one of our favorite Mexican dishes! We've had it before, but had never added evaporated milk to it. We usually just added fat free milk. Followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! This time making it was extra spicy because I didn't deseed the peppers. I also just added 1 8oz pack of cheddar jack cheese instead of another 8oz of cheddar cheese.

I have made this recipe several times now and loved it every time. It's simple and easy to prepare. I used the suggestion of others and added 1 additional egg to the mix for a little more density. I also use El Pato spicy tomato sauce on top. This recipe is a keeper.

One of my favorite vegetarian recipes!  I often make it for 'Meatless Monday', or when entertaining a vegetarian friend.  I use fresh roasted chile's (I think the canned chiles are too bland) and enchilada sauce instead of tomato.  I'm glad I found this recipe!

I added diced chicken between the chile layers, & used enchilada sauce vs tomato sauce. Next time, I'll add some garlic salt, pepper & chili pepper to the egg mixture, because it was a bit bland.

This was very good, however I changed it up quite a bit. Three eggs not two. I added sliced chicken beast instead of the second layer of green chilies. I also added a small can of mild spicy cubed tomatoes, and peppers and then enchilada sauce. It came out great. I kept all the measurements the same.

This was a very good dish.  As with many reviewers, I omitted the 1/2 cup milk, reduced the cheese by one-half and didn't notice a difference.  I did make the following addition:  added 2 additional eggs, which I separated and whipped the egg white until light peaks then folded the yolk, evap milk, and flour mix into the egg whites.  I also baked it in an 8x8 glass dish.  Next time, however, I will add an additional can of chiles.

Very good if you use enchilada sauce vs tomato sauce. Added cooked ground beef cuz my hubby wants meat in his supper meal. A deep dish pie plate is what I bake mine in. I'm taking two of these to a pot-luck and bet both will be devoured quickly ;-)
Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  I used fresh peppers and found out I should have par boiled them.  The top layer was a bit crunchy but still good.  I used enchilada sauce not tomato sauce for extra flavor.

MAJOR MODIFICATION BUT EXCELLENT!!! I blanched 3 poblano peppers for 3 minutes, cut into strips and used instead of canned chili peppers. I added an entire can of Evaporated milk (12oz instead of 5oz). Used 4 tablespoon flour and 4 eggs. Mixed enchilada sauce dry mix with a 24oz can of tomato sauce and added jalapenos & cheese on top, as suggested by others. This was really good with the modifications.

We'll be making this at least once a month! Delicious and easy. We tried it "plain" without the tomato sauce and half with a Hatch red chile sauce--preferred the red chile sauce on top...but was also good without it, just not as good. I've never tried making chile rellenos...and now I never will. Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy dish. I used diced peppers instead of whole, and for the second layer of green peppers I used a mixture of diced peppers and tomatoes. Great recipe.

I agree with my fellow cooks to use a smaller pan.  It spreads out too thin.  I would omit the tomato sauce because there is no need for it and it makes the dish too salty for my taste.  I rinsed, sliced the chili's and removed the seeds.  The other ingredients are fine the way it is.  I added the last cheeses and baked it longer. I like mine a little more cooked.

This was pretty good and very easy. I had fresh peppers to use so roasted, steamed and peeled them first.(Had three and cut recipe in half.) Didn't do any sauce but it needed some enchilada sauce.  NOT plain tomato sauce though!

Fantastic with some changes. I aggregated a number of suggestions in other reviews and this is a (altered) recipe I'll be adding to my weekly meal plans. I used 9 X 13 pan, spray with Pam, Use 27 oz mild green chilies sliced open to lay flat. I put shredded chicken and sprinkled Cumin on before cheese then another layer of chilies, chicken cumin. Used four eggs, all evap milk with flour mixed in--poured over top. In oven as directed for 25 min. Used green enchilada sauce (what I had on hand) and baked another 15 min. Sprinkled rest of cheese and sliced olives on top--another  min in oven to melt. Took out and let rest about 10 minutes. Sprinkled chopped green onion on top and served. YUM YUM YUM Boyfriend puts HOT HOT salsa on everything and he didn't with this one (said it didn't need it) and went back for three servings and when I asked if I should it make again, he said "Heck yeah!"

Such an easy recipe for such a great tasting result! It gives you all the wonderful flavor of chile rellenos without the work of the original thing. As written, it has a lot of fat and I needed to lighten it a little bit so I used low fat evaporated milk, none of the regular milk and used low fat cheese without noticing a loss in flavor. I will try egg whites next time but used 3 whole eggs this time. I did add a little more cheese to the top so that negates some of my efforts but it did taste great! Also I added sliced black olives to the top since we like them. I thought the tomato sauce was fine but will try mixing it with a little enchillada sauce next time.

Used fresh chilis roasted and peeled  3 eggs instead of 2 and mild enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Turned out wonderful.  My family loved it.

I thought it was ok but my husband raved about it so I am making this again tonight! Like some others I had used 4 eggs in a larger pan, with flour and baking powder (1/2 tsp) added, with pepper jack and cheddar and enchilada sauce. For tonight, it will have much more green chilies (I cut these in half), with more pepper jack, and I am thinking about putting in some leftover roast chicken. I am hoping I will like it more this time!

I served this casserole with Vegetarian Tortilla Soup and salad.  Delicious!  This would also be very good for breakfast served with tortillas and black beans.  Based on other reviews, I decided to use enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  We were out of red, so I tried green enchilada sauce.  We loved it!  I also used a smaller baking pan and cooked for a bit longer...this resulted in a nice thick casserole, which we really enjoyed.  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

Not too bad, but not that great either. I thought it was "salty" and did not use any extra salt at all.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight.I used 3 eggs as suggested and dropped the milk. I did add a generous teaspoon of baking powder to the flour which I think helped the mixture become fluffy and light after baking, much like a chili relleno. My husband lovedd it and so did my son. No leftovers with this one. I also used cheddar and pre-grated taco cheese because that's what I had in the fridge. and since we like food spicey I used hot enchelada sauce instead of the tomato sause, which I thought was out of place for this recipe. This is a good standard recipe that can be tweeked to suite you taste. Very good.

This recipe was amazing. I added twice as many chilies and twice the amount of egg mixture. I also left out the regular milk and just used the evaporated milk. I used enchilada sauce, as the other viewers suggested, but maybe with half tomato sauce and half enchilada sauce it would be better. I felt that straight enchilada sauce took away from the yummy chili/egg combination. This is soooooooo good!

Following others, I used an 8x8 casserole dish, omitted the milk, used just 6oz. of the jack cheese and used 5oz. of enchilada sauce and 3 eggs. It was my first attempt at Mexican food and everyone thought it was delicious!

Recipe was awesome and I can hardly wait to make it again. I used fresh poblano peppers and pre-baked them until they were mostly cooked. I cut them into bite sized pieces before putting them in the casserole. I used 3 eggs like other people recommended. I only had tomato sauce, so I used that to make the Ten Minute Enchilada Sauce recipe from this site. Using the enchilada sauce really added a great flavor. I used about 12oz of shredded cheese that was equal parts sharp, mild cheddar and pepperjack.

Excellent with some changes per reviewers.  Only used 8 oz total of a mexican cheese blend, 4 egg whites(3/4 cups liquid eggs whites from carton), 6oz  evap. ff milk, 4 tbsp flour, (1) 8 oz can enchilada sauce, black olives. layered in a 8x8 glass dish.  Will make again and again! and I am not a big mexican dish fan.

This tasted very breakfasty to me. It was super easy to throw together. I followed other reviews and only used the evaporated milk, increased egg to 3 and cooked in 8 x 8 pan. I only used one can of green chilis since it was in a smaller pan and I also sliced them up.For the tomato sauce I used Salsa Chipotle by El Mexicano. It is tomato and chipotle together. Lots of great flavor. Sadly, my family did not like this at all. I was surprised since they love green chili enchiladas.

This is so good! Everyone at the bridal shower loved it. I just wish I knew a brand of chilis that weren't nearly as spicey as the ones I have tried.

It was great I follow previous reviews suggestions, used the whole can of milk, none of the fresh milk, 3 eggs, 3 Tbs of bisquick, mexican mix shredded cheese, canned chopped chili's and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Will still make some adjustments next time.

To make this even better, add a layer of shredded chicken or pork after the first layer of cheese.  Add the second layer of cheese after the second layer of chilies and then add the egg mixture.

I made the recipe as is except I chopped the peppers and used enchilada sauce in place of tomato. It was very good, but not really "chili rellenos". Maybe if I used Queso Blanco instead of cheddar it might taste more authentic. Also it needs some sort of crispy fried batter like real chile rellenos, maybe crushed fried onions on top or something. It was still very good and a tummy filler. I served it with mexican rice and beans.

I LOVE chile rellenos.  That is my meal of choice every time we eat at a mexican restaurant, so I was really excited to try this recipe.  It tasted just like the regular thing!  So good and so easy!  I did make changes per the suggestions of other reviewers: I used 3 eggs instead of 2, 8X8 dish, and enchilada sauce instead of plain tomatoe.  My husband did request more of the egg mixture next time so I will probably increase the eggs to 5, add some more milk, and increase the flour.

I did not like this recipe at all.  Living in NM, chili rellenos are a part of our diet, so maybe my expectations were too high.  This had the texture almost like a custard.  Rellenos are breaded and fried, not baked into a souffle.  The flavor wasn't bad (using enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce) but I just could not get over the mouth feel.  We threw this away.

I have never submitted a rating on here before, but I really enjoyed this dish. I hate it when people rate things after they change everything in the recipe, so I admit I am guilty of it myself. Made in 8x8 pan and used enchilada sauce, other than that followed to a T. Was delicious...thank you!

i don't know what i did wrong. maybe i didn't cook it long enough. but it was watery and the texture wasn't all that great. i think next time i will cook longer and lay tortillas on bottom and in btw layers. oh and i did get rid of the milk and used enchilad sauce instead and half the amount of cheese. i took everyones advice but it wasn't that great.

I didn't think that this receipe would be one that we would turn into a once a week meal but my family LOVED it! It was full of great flavor and my husband who eats chili rellenos when we go out to restrants was in amazment.  He even raved about it the next day when he came home from work! I did double the egg, milk mixture because I didn't think it covered the entire casserole with the way the reicepe called for and it turned out GREAT! This will be a staple in our house for years to come.

This just wasn't for us.  I like chili rellenos, but this just didn't work.  I can't really put my finger on what was wrong with it.  If I ever did make it again, I'd either use the green enchilada sauce or just tomato sauce instead of the red enchilada sauce, which is what I used based on a couple of reviews I read.  I followed the recipe otherwise (oh, except I added some shredded chicken, too).  We didn't hate it by any means, just didn't go back for seconds and probably won't make it again.

VERY GOOD! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used enchilada sauce) and it needs more chilis.  I say get 4 cans not 2.  It didn't fill up my 9x13.  We ate it with corn tortillas and sour cream.

I loved this recipe! I will definitely make this again! I did make a few changes though. First I trippled the egg's,flour, and doubled the milk's. I also added some garlic to the tomatoe sauce. I used a large can of peppers too. I liked the extra peppers.

I've made this several times now and always to rave reviews.  The only thing I change is that I use green chili enchilada sauce instead of the tomato sauce on the top.  Very good.  Thanks!

Absolutely a five star (with some of the previously suggested modifications.) I.e. 8x8 or 9x9 pan and mild enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I used more cheese than suggested - about 12-14 ounce of Colby Jack and 4-6 oz of Monterey Jack and baked a bit longer... about 5-10 minutes.  I made this for 2 parties with very different crowds and it was a major hit at both.  Everyone seems to assume it's going to be spicy and then, realizing it's very mild (depending on your choice of enchilada sauce), they are in line again loading up their plates.  It's also very easy to make!

This is a wonderful recipie, although I used fresh fire roasted peppers and followed some advice from other reviews.  I used three eggs and one 12oz can of evaporated milk, omitted regular milk, and added 1/4 tsp cumin, 1 tsp onion powder, 1tsp salt and 1 clove of minced garlic to the milk, egg and flour mix. I cooked some chicken breasts and shreaded them with a fork and added it between the layers of chilis, along with some black olives. As other reviews suggested I used enchilada sauce instead of tomatoe sauce, (this really made it taste more like enchiladas though). I split my chilies down one side and laid them open faced in the pan. Thanks!

We also used our home grown anaheim chilis and spicy tomato sauce. It was so good and easy that we decided to make it in a dutch oven on a camping trip. It was delicious cooked on a slow camp fire, too.

Delicious! I made it for Easter, everyone loved it and ate it all up! I made 2 changes: omitted the evaporated milk and only used regular milk; and I used 2 whole eggs plus 2 egg whites. It came out fantastic, I will definitely make again.

Delicious. Made it in 8x8 glass dish as suggested but split the chilis open for layering and added sliced black olives on top of first layer and on top. Used 4-cheese blend (half a bag) and some shredded cheddar for additional color. Also enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. To add some flavor to the 3-egg, evaporated milk, and flour mixture, I ground some cumin and cilantro seeds with some chili powder. This dish is easy to make and turns out well. Next time I'll play with more ingredients, but it's a good recipe to begin with.

This recipe is a keeper with some modification:  I used Anaheim chilies and charred them under the broiler and removed the skin instead of using the canned chilies.  I also added hamburger meat cooked with 1 jalepeno, seeded, 1/4 c. onion, and 1/4 c. bell pepper, chopped and added taco seasoning to the mix.  Topped with enchilada sauce like over reviewers instead of tomato sauce.  Family loved it because it wasn't too spicy but had lots of taste.

My husband and I liked this. I think next time I will cut up the chilies. I think next time I will add just 2 eggs, like it said to do. It was the way we like it around the edges. well don. not crispy in the middle. We still liked it and will make this again. Might try putting meat in it next time

Pretty tasty. I used egg whites and only the evaporated milk.  I took the advice of many and substituted enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and wish I hadn't. I felt it really competed with the green chile. Next time I'd use green enchilada sauce or stewed tomatoes sauteed with onion and garlic. Tasted better the next day.

Hubby loved it so much that he ate THREE servings at one sitting! I liked it but not madly. Daughter didn't like it at all, but in all fairness, she doesn't like chili rellenos.  So...there you have it!

I made this especially for myself and my 15 year old son since we're the chili relleno eaters of the household.  I prepared it in a 6x6 pan. It was quick, easy, and it was all eaten. I liked it b'c it was different from the scrambled eggs/chilis I make (although it was similar). I used red enchilada sauce on top which really added to the flavor.

This came out very good. I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato as others suggested but didn't like it. I'm going to use a green kind next time just because of my own preference. Can't blame the recipe because I changed it, it was otherwise great.

I was looking for an easier recipe than the one I usually use.  This is good, but not as good as mine.  Great for my vegetarian daughter.  ~jtck

This was good but I had a hard time getting the eggs to set.  I don't know if it was my fault or the recipe, I will have to try again.  I also used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce because I had left over enchilada sauce I need to use up.  My husband loved this and for a meat and potatoes kind of guy, that is saying a lot.

Absolutely Delicious! We loved it! We live in New Mexico where Green Chili's are in abundance and Chili Rellenos is one of our favorite dishes and we quickly fell in love with this recipe. Rather than using tomatos we used homemade red chili sauce to top it and it was wonderful! 5 stars from our family!

This was pretty good. I used fresh roasted chilies and half colby/jack cheese and half mild cheddar. I really didn't care for the tomato sauce and I think it had to much cheese. I will adjust those if I make it again.

I used this recipe as a basic starting point and changed it in the following ways.  One layer of chili's, half cheese, next layer of chili's, the rest of the cheese.  Used three eggs, added red onions, cilantro and garlic to the egg milk mixture.  Baked according to the recipe, topped with a can of "El Pato" (the duck) mexican style hot tomato sauce.  It was really good.

This is the second time I have made this dish. Loved it the first time I made it following the recipe exactly.  The second time, I had about 1/2 lb. of ground chuck so I cooked it, drained it and added onions and garlic like someone recommended.  I also used enchilada sauce as someone else recommended.  I used about 8 Anaheim chiles and an extra egg as per another suggestion.  (Added salt and pepper to the egg mixture.)  When layering, I added fresh cilantro and jalapeno slices cuz we love more spicy.  I also used the 4-cheese Mexican blend (Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla & Asadero Cheese) that I had on hand.  WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS!! This is a fabulous recipe and I want to try it with chicken and green enchilada sauce as per another cook.  This is a versatile recipe.

Like many others, I added an additional egg and omitted the milk from this recipe.  Enchilada sauce was substituted for tomato sauce.  This recipe works well if it is doubled in a 9 x 13, but it might be necessary to cook a little longer.  

This would be a great meal with added shredded chicken or beef and served with rice.  Delicious.  With the revisions, this recipe gets a 5.

I didn't intend to change anything in this recipe...except to reduce the cheese to 6 oz each instead of 8 to save some fat and cals. But when I starting preparing it, I realized I had no evaporated milk. So I improvised. I used 1 full cup of milk (instead of 1/2) and 3/4 cup of light sour cream, mixed together to get a thick consistency. I doubled the eggs and flour and used a glass 13X9 pan. I layered all the cheese by mistake instead of reserving some for the top. So since I had already screwed up, I made our family chili relleno sauce and served it on the side instead of topping it with the tomato sauce, and baked it for 50 minutes. After all of my abusing of the recipe, it was still just delicious. Highly recommend.

I also changed a few things based on the other reviews.  I used an 8x8 pan, 3 eggs instead of 2, enchalada sauce instead of tomato sauce, & added black olives to the egg mixture.  I also used fresh plabano peppers cut into strips instead of canned chilies.  Remember to blanch the fresh peppers for a few minutes before placing them into the pan.  This recipe is wonderful!  Even my picky toddlers ate it!

This casserole was Awesome with some personal prefence adjustments.  I used 4 egg whites and one egg yolk with only evaporated milk not using the regular milk. I also added a layer of browned chicken breast and black beans between the chili layers and a layer of fresh tomatoes with the last addition of cheese and fresh cilantro while it was resting.

This is one of my husbands favorite recipes.  The casserole is full of flavor, but not overly spicy.  I use fresh poblano peppers instead of canned chilis, regular milk, and canned diced tomatoes.   This is excellent.

After taking others advice, I left out the 1/2 c milk, added green chili sauce and a few dice tomoatoes. Topped with black olives and a little crumbled cooked hamburger. My husband went bonkers and couldn't stop raving about it!!  We grew some pablanos chilies and he was dying for some chili rellenos.  This was ALOT easier and just as tasty.  Will definitely make again!!!!

I cut up the chiles into bite-sized pieces; used the can of evaporated milk and omitted the regular milk; 3 eggs rather than 2; and enchilada sauce for a little spice, rather than plain tomato sauce.  I also steamed some chicken breast tenders, soaked them in the juice from the green chiles to flavor them, and placed them on top of the first layer of cheese; very glad to have added that bit of protein, texture, flavor to the dish and would do it in the future; would also add sauteed onion (regular or green). Baked in 9x9 baking dish which was just right. Would make this again; really good weekday meal.  Served with Mexican Rice III and margaritas.  Thank you, Clarissa2!

This was just as good as any chili rellenos I have had at restaurants. The only thing I changed was the tomato sauce, I used enchilada saucew instead. I will definately be making this ften.

I've made this several times and it's been a huge hit all around. Everyone who tries it wants the recipe.  I used some of the earlier suggestions - added an extra egg, left out the extra milk, used a smaller pan. Any kind of cheese works well. Chopped fire roasted chiles add a nice taste and are easy, also chopped up several green onions and layered them on top of the chiles, and added chili powder and cumin to the flour. Made it once for a friend with a gluten intolerance and subbed cornstarch for the flour - worked great. Love this recipe!

This was pretty good.  I used an 8x8 pan and mexican hot tomato sauce.  Tasted just like chili rellenos which isn't one of my favorites but my boyfriend really liked it so I might make again.

I didn't have time to read through the suggestions and I made this as written and thought it was wonderful!  It turned out thinner that what I was expecting, but it tasted wonderful!  When I go to a Mexican restaraunt, I always order Chili Rellenos - they are my favorite - and this casserole tastes just like them!  This will be very easy to make when I'm craving Chili Rellenos!  I can't wait to try out everyone's suggestions next time!

I used the 9x13 pan but doubled the amount of evaporated milk(10 ounces) and flour(4 tbs)  8 ounces of shredded sharp cheddar cheese seemed like plenty of cheese. I liked the thin layer of mostly chilies and cheese. The addition of salsa instead of tomato sauce made it to hot for youngsters but great for adults who like spicy food.This is a great side dish with barbecued chicken.

This was casserole was DELICIOUS! I used Hatch Whole Green Chili's which fit the casserole dish perfectly for two layers. The flavors with the egg, cheese and chili's blended to create a Tex-Mex dish that is PURE PERFECTION!! I'm going to make this again and again and again!  And Potluck Work Contest - here I come! :-)

used poblano chilies, chedder jack cheese, 4 eggs, 3 Tflour, 1 can evap. milk,  roasted the chilies, pealed then cut them open and seeded them put one later down then some cheese, then repeat, separated the eggs and whipped egg whites then folded them into the yolk, flour, milk mixture. they did not incorporate well the egg white was mostly on top. when  baked it it the ninja toaster over/air fryer on bake at 350 degree. the top got very brown and the egg  mixture took a long time to cook. next time i will not separate the eggs. served green salsa on the side instead off putting tomato sauce on top. used a small casserole dish so it would fit in the toaster oven which is why it took longer to cook. tasted good.

I've made this 100 times, I think.   I've added an extra can of the 7 oz green chili peppers or 2-3 cans of the 10oz if you can find them. Love the peppers. This fits well with a Keto diet I think!

Just made this tonight. Used 3 eggs and only the evaporated milk, those were the changes I made. I did use red enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. It was delicious! My husband loved it!

My family loved it. The kids went back several times for more. I used a 9X13 dish as the recipe states. I also added ground beef  cooked with onion and seasoning and layered on the peppers. I added several eggs using the recommended amount of milk otherwise it would not have covered the full dish size. I also used enchilada sauce on top.

I used a 9x9 pan. Idk how you can use a 9x13 with so little chilie’s. Anyways, i cut mine into bite size pieces, followed the directions for the most part but like many, used evaporated milk and red enchilada sauce. I also used a blend of monterey and cheddar cheese (it’s what I had). It was really good! If you like tang, like vinegar, you’ll like this. Otherwise, rinse your chile’s from the liquid it comes in. Super easy, serve with Mexican or rice flavored with a chicken bouillon perhaps as it’s on the saltier side but not too salty.

This is what you call a foolproof recipe. Here’s my story. I didn’t have the right kind of cheese so I used the cheese I had. I didn’t have canned chilies so I used fresh chilies and cook them at 450 in the oven for about 20 minutes. That’s all well and good. Then, I messed up this recipe so bad - doubling the milk, forgetting the flour, pouring some of the liquid out, sprinkling the flour on top and mushing it down and then leaving it in an oven I thought was turned off but wasn’t for 20 minutes over the cooking time. I’m usually a good cook but there must have been some synapse misfires this afternoon. Anyway, the point is, after all that buffoonery the casserole was delicious! I couldn’t believe it. Trust me, you cannot mess this up.

Easiness rating is 5 star. This could be a flavor 5-star with some tweaking. I didn't read the reviews for suggestions ahead of time, which is always a good idea to do. An 8x8 pan would have been perfect. I reduced the cheese because it visually looked like a lot. I thought it was unusual to use tomato sauce instead of enchilada sauce, but I used the tomato sauce anyway and did not miss the enchilada sauce at all. It could use the addition of some olives and/or green onions on top for a little extra texture and kick.

I made a few changes as some of the ingredients are hard to find here in Netherlands. I had to use roasted Red peppers, could not find green chilies anywhere ??, used a mild Gouda, they’ve never heard of Monterey cheese here ???????. And topped it with an enchilada sauce I made! This was delicious! I can only imagine how good it would be with the right peppers and cheese....but hey this expat is not complaining ??

I’m shocked at how easy this was. I usually make these the old fashioned way and it’s so time consuming, so I’m happy there’s an easier way. It’s not exactly the same taste but it was still pretty good. I will be using this recipe again for a quick weeknight dinner.

Delish.  I only used evaporated milk.  I used three eggs and 1/4 c. flour in the batter.  I cut the cheese amount in half.  I added Mexican oregano to the tomato sauce.  I roasted 6 jalapeños -- it's basically the same recipe with a couple of tweaks after reading the reviews.  Tastes like the real thing.  I've made it before with canned chilis and enchilada sauce and that was good, too.

I screwed things up, and it still turned out great.
Because I was cooking for a small group I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 casserole dish, the one called for in the original recipe. The doubled recipe fit just fine. My first mistake was that, because whole canned chiles were unavailable in my area of the northeast, I bought chopped chiles, not realizing that there is a difference between chopped and diced. Chopped are pretty mushy and have a fair amount of liquid. I used four 7 oz. cans plus one 4.5 oz can and drained as much as I could.

I used six eggs as per suggestions and just evaporated milk.

My biggest mistake was that I put down a layer of chiles, then a layer of cheese, then another layer of chile, then another layer of cheese, which is not how the recipe goes. Because I was on a deadline, once I realized my mistake, I just kept going. So, it took closer to 55 minutes to set up enough to put the sauce on top. 

I used 24 oz. of cheese, by the way, half way between the recipe and the suggestions.

I did use enchilada sauce, and I'm glad I did, though it was way too bland, so I added a judicious amount of very hot habanero sauce to it. Then it needed closer to 25-30 minutes after adding the sauce.

Is it a perfect clone of chiles rellenos? No, but it was really delicious, and I bumped it up to five stars because it was such a forgiving recipe. Serve with jalapeno slices for people who like more heat.

I love this recipe...takes me back to Mexico!  My only change was enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce, just like many have already said.

My man and I loved this! Changes included: enchilada sauce,  cooked taco seasoned ground turkey,  2 4oz cans green chiles with 2 fresh poblano chiles cut into thin rings (No need to peel or pre cook), 3 eggs, 1/4 milk, dash of cumin and garlic powder to egg mixture,  and sliced olives on top during the last 10 min. Excited for the leftovers,  will add a dollop of sour cream and green onions

Very good! I added  enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce,  3 eggs instead of 2.  Put some black olives and jalapenos on top.  The 2nd time I made this the eggs didn't set and I think its beacause I added Milk this time per the receipe.   Just use the Evaporated Milk!  Also cook it a little bit longer than suggested

Loved this and it will become a regular at our house. I tore the chili’s into strips, used 5 eggs and a 15 oz can of evaporated milk (recipe says 5oz) I used green enchilada sauce instead of tomato snd a bit more flour. I cooled it in an 8x8 pan and it was about an inch high. It was delicious!

Man, was this delicious!  I only made one change, based on one of the review, and that was to roast 8 Poblano Peppers instead of using the canned Chilies.  I roasted the Poblano's 3 minutes per side under the broiler and the "roasty" taste added even more flavor.  When the peppers were roasted, I cut the top off, removed the veins with my fingers and use  the whole pepper as a base and as as the 2nd layer. MMMMMMM Good.  Thanks Clarissa2.  This will become a staple in my menu rotation.

I made this and it was very good...would definitely make again. I did read reviews and altered it according. 9x9 pan, used fresh poblanos I roasted about 8, tore about 5 small corn tortillas put on the bottom to keep from getting soggy, 1 # of grated Mexican cheese. I Mixed 8 eggs, 4 oz evaporated milk, 1/2 tsp each salt, pepper, cumin, garlic powder & onion powder. I made 2 layers starting with the tortillas then chiles, cheese, chillies and cheese on top. Sprinkled with paprika. Baked for 40-45 min (checked to make sure set) until brown on top, let stand 10 minutes.
Note: I added seasoned ground beef in the middle of half and put enchilada sauce on top the last ten minutes. My husband likes meat and sauce....but we both decided we liked the half without better.  Served with green onions, tomatoes, sour cream and avocado.  Yummmmmy. I also will add a bit more of the spices next time.

It was a very small casserole.  I put in an 8" square pan ad it wasn't even halfway full.  Delicious flavor, but would double ingredients if I make it again.

This recipe is easy, inexpensive and delicious!  I used some fresh, roasted poblanos  instead of canned and highly recommend taking this to work with warm tortillas and sour cream.

It was ok -tried it first exactly as written and it definately needed "something". My question is: why does the picture show green onions on top when they aren't listed in the ingredients?  I will try this again with some adjustments.

I took the advice of the others on here and made it with 3 eggs and used enchilada sauce and baked in an 8 x 8 pan. It was wonderful! Will definitely make again.

Yummy.  Followed suggestions of using 3 eggs instead of 2, and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Also, used 2 (10oz) cans of whole green chile peppers since I could not find the 7oz cans. Even fussy hubby went back for seconds. Next time will use 3 (10oz) cans for more substantial layers of the chiles and add layers of cooked ground beef mixed with taco seasoning for even more protein and flavor. Good enough for casual company or taking to a potluck.

This was very good and will definitely make again. Because I did not want to waste any evaporated milk, I used the entire can and omitted the other milk. I also used Asiago cheese, Mozzarella cheese, and Colby Jack cheese since that is what I had on hand. In place of the tomato sauce, I used one half can of Hatch organic red enchilada sauce found in the international section of my grocery store. I used a 7 x10 inch casserole dish. Am having the leftovers tonight! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I couldn't find the canned whole chiles so I used chopped green chiles and used mild red enchilada sauce. I also halved the recipe since there's just two of us.  It was outstanding.  There were no leftovers.  Made Spanish Rice to go with it. This is on my rotation for sure.

I loved the flavor of the dish but it turned out very soupy. I followed the directions in the video. Used 3 eggs one small can evaporated milk and one can enchilada sauce.  I did use a smaller deep dish casserole to make it in. Not sure if it’s the size of the pan that left it soupy. I covered it and baked it for another 30 min but it’s not thick or congealed. Any suggestions?

I’ve been making this on and off for 20+ years with a few alterations: I seperate the eggs, mix the yolks wih the flour and milk and some salt and pepper.  I beat the egg whites and fold them in.  Instead of tomato or enchilada sauce I add a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis, and I dont put a third layer if cheese.  It is great for potlucks and is easy to double ir triple!

Take it from a Mexican family,  this is a very authentic recipe!  One of the few on this site.  Hubby likes his with no sauce but tomato sauce, pico de gallo or tomato sala are great on top.

One of these days I am going to find some pablano chiles.  So far, I have made it with a 15 oz can of carefully reserved and dried pickled jalapenos, a half pound of Jack cheese inside, red enchilada sauce and a half pound of grated cheddar jack on top.  I have done this twice and the fam eats it.  I serve it with Spanish Rice and green salad.  My SIL gathers it all up and days it in a burrito.

Sadly, I’m not a big fan of this recipe. I used 6oz more chilies than was called for and there were still not enough to make two full layers without large gaps. The egg/milk/flour filling was VERY eggy and off-putting. It also wasn’t very flavorful.

Loved this, and made some changes as we always do.  We used home grown poblano peppers (about 8 medium) and used 8x13 pan.  Layered the peppers, then made a chicken mix of  about 2 cups chicken breasts after cooking onions and 2 cobs of corn stripped and added to mix.  Also added about 1/4 cup of raisens and 1/4 cup of walnuts.  After the peppers we did the mexican cheese out of a bag, one half of the chicken mixture and the rest of cheese.  Mixed the egg mixture (5 eggs and about a cup of evaporated mix) and added to the casserole.  Then cooked for about 25 minutes.  Pulled and added about 1/2 cup of the  red sauce and cheese and put in for about 15 to 20 more minutes.  Let rest for 5 minutes.  Was fabulous!  will make again for sure.

I had made this for a Teachers end of school year potluck as a last minute choice,and barely anyone touched this dish! I had to substitute gluten free flour as there were amongst the staff,( including me), with intolerance to wheat products.  I am not sure if because of the gluten free flour,( I did add Xanthan gum to thicken) but the dish was runny! Maybe it was the enchilada sauce,as the chili relleno casserole part seemed firm enough.I did not use tomato sauce,but replaced that with enchilada red sauce,and added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and onion powders for extra taste because based on some reviews this dish was kinda bland without the extra seasonings. I also cut the green chilies into strips to make each serving had adequate green chili. Not a success at the potluck,but I'll make this again,except I'll char broil some fresh Hatch green chilies to amplify the taste and texture and see if that will rectify this casserole.

This was just okay. Tasty but mostly just a pile of cheese. I omitted the regular milk like many of the reviewers suggested, and it was still VERY soupy. I can't even imagine what it would be like with the extra milk. I did use diced chilies instead of whole because that's what I could find, and I don't think that helped with the extra wetness. I added a can of black beans to give it some protein, and sprinkled green onions on top, but it still seemed like it was lacking something to make it a meal -- maybe serve over rice?

Very easy, relatively quick... sure is spicy, and packs a lotta cheese (and therefore quite filling). Good weekday recipe for late nights or after work.  I didn't watch the video, just went by the recipe; used whole milk with the condensed milk; and sliced the peppers so they would lay flat.

Simple and straightforward instructions.  Very easy to prepare, and oh my goodness it's GOOD!  My husband suggested that next time I make it, I could include a pound of 90% lean ground beef already cooked and ready to mix into the ingredients.  But we both really enjoyed this delicious recipe

Followed recipe exactly and the results tasted great but the egg/flour mix didn't cook through, it was a bit runny. I will try this again and bake a while longer!

I stuffed the Pablano Chile’s with potatoes, diced green onions, diced tomatoes and cheese. Then followed recipe. It came out so delicious. I can’t want to use this for our Easter Family get together.

No, it’s not like a real chili relleno but it’s very good. My hubs said it was more like a crustless quiche. We both enjoyed it very much. I’ll be making it often.

I have made this probably 30 or more times. I cut it up into small squares and take as an appetizer - for guests to pick up with a toothpick. I’ve served it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I make it using this recipe except substitute tomatillo sauce from a jar for the tomato sauce... we like the little extra spice.

This was not as exceptional as I had hoped.  I did use verde sauce instead of tomato sauce because I am not a fan of red sauces.  It was ok, I ate it, but can't rave about it.

I made this in an 8x8 pan and I added rotisserie chicken on top of the first cheese layer.  I used my convection microwave and added 5 minutes to the first bake time. I also added black olives just for the color and because we love them in Mexican food. It was a delicious dish and my guy wants it again (which is a miracle)!

i love chile rellenos and this was a great recipe.  i followed other reviewers advice and use a whole can of evaporated milk and skipped the 1/2 cup of milk.  the  blended mexican stewed tomatoes on top versus tomatoe paste  give it a nice refreshing kick.  will definitely make again!

Very good flavor. I used extra hot hatch chile.  I made it in an 8x8 pan with evaporated milk and enchilada sauce. I used hatch chile because I buy 30lbs every summer and freeze it.  I don't care for canned chile.  

Next time I will use a mix of poblano and hatch chile.  

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicious! Added 5 sliced Brats after 1st cheese layer. Used almond flour. I did not have any tomato sauce so I substituted with Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes which I puréed in my vita mix along with one Brat. I used the whole 11.5 ounce can. Out of this world delicious.

This is one of my family’s favorites! I took reviewers’ suggestions and did the following: 3 eggs instead of two, use 5 oz evaporated milk only, enchilada sauce instead of tomato, and half the cheese. I also use gluten free flour. My family loves when I add olives and/or jalapeños to the top! And they really love when I double the recipe lol!

I believe  there are a couple of errors in the recipe.  You don't  need the additional 1/2 cup of milk, and you need more than 2 eggs, you need at least three or four.  Also, I made my own enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce.  With these changes, it's good.

This was wonderful. I usually deep fry, with this my chili’s aren’t sitting in oil. Sooo much flavor. My husband couldn’t get over how good they were! This is my recipe from now on. I did use suggestions of others.

My family loves this, but we do make it with enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.

Added seared flank steak and potatos. Used roasted poblanos and Anehiem peppers. Also got rid of the cheddar and used only Monterey Jack

A very tasty dish. I liked the convenience of the canned chilis and followed the advice of another reviewer by using enchilada sauce in place of tomato. I also added another egg and 8oz of chorizo to ramp up the protein. Will definitely make this again soon.

Quick and easy to make.  Great flavor.  Leftovers reheat well in the microwave.  The only change I made was using a thick salsa instead of tomato sauce.  I think the next time I would use a smaller dish.  It might puff up a little more.  Will make again.  My husband loved it!

Solid recipe! I didn't make most of the changes that people suggested: I made it in the 13x9 pan and used the 1/2 cup of milk. One thing I did change was adding 2 extra eggs (4 total). Also, they were out of smaller cans of green chilies at the grocery store, so I bought a 27 ounce one. Good thing I did, because with a 13x9 pan, one 7 ounce can of chilies isn't enough to make a (mostly) unbroken layer. But 1/2 of a large can IS enough :-) Next time, I think I'll add some shredded chicken and/or mushrooms to the first layer of cheese to add some heft and different flavors. I'll definitely be trying this one again!

I used poblano peppers that I roasted and then broiled.  I also used ground beef that I sauteed with onion and garlic and typical Mexican herbs an spices instead of just cheese.  It was delicious, and I'll never stop making "real" chiles rellenos, but this was good for a weeknight dinner!

I used enchilada sauce as recommended. I also didn’t notice normal and evaporated milk, so only used evaporated. I cooked it a little longer because my oven is spotty and wanted it super melted and yummy. Topped with olives, served with a salsa chicken. Super great! Takes a little time but super easy and minimum dishes. Use fresh block cheese for extra flavor. Gets messy when served if not allowed to cool.

This was delicious after I made some changes. I doubled the recipe. I used real Anaheim chili’s you can also use poblano peppers. and roasted them then put them in a bag to steam the peel off and took seeds out. I did not use tomato sauce either. I boiled about 3 whole tomatoes, an onion, garlic, and 2 jalapeños then blended that up and made my own tomato salsa purée to pour over this. Serve with Avacodo! It’s Delicious.

Couple things -- I used fresh hatch chiles because they're in season, and layered about 10 ounces of peppers per layer. I also used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. I served it last night for a large family function and had to guilt my husband into leaving one piece for me. I got more compliments on this casserole than on the main dish of the evening. One casserole (as a side dish to street tacos) served about 14 adults. I'm making it again later this week for another function!

Thanks for the recipe. We enjoyed this, especially with my modifications. This is how I made my layers:                           1) Bottom layer of tortillas; 2) Fresh Poblano peppers, roasted and skin removed; 3) fresh Oaxaca cheese (similar flavour as Monterey Jack); 4) 1 lb Ground beef browned with cumin and diced onion; 5) Fresh Poblano peppers, roasted and skin removed; 6) Refried beans; 7) Egg mixture (2 eggs, 5oz. condensed milk, and 2 Tbsp. flour - skipped  the regular milk: it would have been like soup); 8) Enchilada sauce; 9) Oaxaca cheese

I have been making this for awhile. I’ve made some adjustments for my husband’s cholesterol: I use egg substitute (3 eggs), mix  low fat cheddar cheese with a vegan pepper jack cheese & use (all) fat free evaporated milk. Other modifications include using medium chunky salsa in place of tomato sauce & I use 3 tablespoons of flour. One of my favorite go-to recipes!

I made it with the suggested modifications (enchilada sauce, no milk - only the evaporated milk). I did also add the black olives and green onions on the top after broiling the cheese to melt it. It's going to be a favorite in my home.

Quick and easy recipe.  I used a Mexican cheese blend and some mozzarella, three eggs and just the 5 oz evaporated milk.  I used red taco sauce on top.

I made it as the recipe called, one thing I would change is to use green enchilada sauce on top and not the red sauce, because I don't care for red. I served it as a side dish for a party and got a lot of compliments.  It is easy to make and tastes good.

Needs a bit of baking powder to give it some texture...otherwise it's flat. Also replace the tomatoe sauce with enchiladas sauce.

Use Enchilada sauce instead of Tomato sauce. Skip the milk and use just the evaporated milk.

This seemed like too much cheese for the amount of egg.  Next time I would experiment with that.

Made this after seeing so many great reviews and I was really disappointed.  I'm not sure what to call this (is it an egg bake?  is it a casserole?) or how to serve it (is it a main dish?  is it an appetizer dip?)  It was too cheesy and overall tasted quite salty despite not adding any salt.  It had a lot of flavor but wasn't a big hit in our house.

Great for a weekday vegetarian meal.  I used three eggs instead of two, Green enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, and mexican cheese blend instead of cheddar/jack.   I served it with Mexican rice III and the whole meal worked out really well.

Wonderful dish — and I don’t even like eggs! I followed the recipe for the most part but I did use Hatch green chiles and enchilada sauce instead of tomato. So good! Thank you!

Made this as a brunch casserole and it turned out great! I used fresh roasted chili’s and 4 eggs, 2 tbs. if flour and tomato sauce on the top and Monterey Jack cheese. Cooked it like the directions said and we loved it.

The family thought it was really good.  I followed the video and  advice from the reviews more than the printed recipe.  I made two layers of fresh roasted pablano peppers in an 8-inch square pan, a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk and left out the milk, enchilada sauce in lieu of tomato sauce and three eggs instead of two.  Leftovers were also very good heated in the toaster oven.  Would definitely make again.

Going back to my standby recipe. The addition of milk and tomato sauce instead of enchilada sauce made this dish very bland. I recommend no milk other than evaporated and ditch the tomato sauce for enchilada sauce. My other recipe uses 3 eggs.

I wasn;t expecting much due to the lack of ingredients, but it really was tasty and tasted like a good Relleno.
I added a small can of chopped chillis to the sauce

I added one egg, otherwise made as written.  Not enough substance or firmness to be a casserole in my opinion.  Good taste, but seems more like a dip than a meal.

I hope you like eggs because this is a lightly flavored egg casserole. Clearly this recipe was made for the “American” palate, as it was quite flavorless. You would figure with that much cheese you could make anything taste good. Not the case people!

It came out really nice & tasty. Family loved it. I substituted evaporated milk for whole milk & I didnt use any tomato or enchilada sauce. I used 3 eggs instead of 2. I used 8 poblano chilis. I will try next time with enchilada sauce. Maybe change it up now & then. So many ways to do it. Gave me ideas.   It didnt sound so tasty with tomato sauce. From the reviews others didnt either. Thanks for sharing your recipe. It was much easier than the old fashion rellenos. Im using this recipe. Much better

Not stringy cheesy enough. Entirely too much liquid.  Would line bottom of baking dish with tortilla chips, use 1 cup of milk instead of 2, or 1 can evaporated milk instead of 2 cups milk and 5 oz. evaporated milk.  Be careful of quality of cheese used.  I used cheap cheese.  Will use better quality cheese next time.  Might try asiago cheese.

This was excellent!  I did incorporate some of the reviewer suggestions but that just shows how flexible the recipe is and how creative the reviewers are.  Rotel tomatoes, black olives, scallions, mixing the tomato sauce with hot salsa made it really delicious.

I am so sorry to say that this was not a success in my house. My husband and I agreed the flavor was definitely there, but the texture, in my opinion, was strange. I was expecting a quiche-like casserole, and my choice of recipes that evening was between this and another that was an actual quiche recipe. Also, I did vary ever so slightly from the recipe and used red enchilada sauce in place of regular tomato sauce, but as I said, it was a texture thing for us. It all came down to the ingredients I had on hand. I will probably not make it again, but I do think it is a good recipe, just maybe not for me. Thank you for sharing.

Made this  Christmas morning for a crowd. Put it in the oven while opening presents. Came out perfect! Made a larger casserole 11x13. I did use more eggs than called. Had a small can of enchillada sauce  I didnt use all of it but should have gave the dish that extra kick! Everyone loved it and it was soooo easy!

The flavor was excellent but it was very soupy. Luckily, I served this dish with Spanish rice so we ended up putting the servings on top of that to soak up the juices. Per other reviewers, I did add an extra egg and used Enchilada sauce instead of plain tomato sauce. Maybe next time I'll try doubling the egg mixture in hopes it will firm it up a bit.

This is great! 4 star because I made changes based on others' results. Used 3 eggs, only 5 Oz evaporated milk. Used red enchilada sauce. topped w jalapeños and black olives. I DID whisk egg whites separately but not sure that is necessary.  Just eyballed the cheese and used a 3 Mexican cheese package. Added some ceyanne pepper, garlic powder and cumin. SO easy and so delicious. Topped only w sour cream. Added maybe 2-1/2 tablespoons of flour. Am making again tonight. Thanks for sharing easy recipe.

This is excellent and I've made it quite a few times now.  Only things I do different is I don't use tomato sauce, I use homemade enchilada sauce  with a recipe I got here: https://cookieandkate.com/2016/enchilada-sauce-recipe/    and I can't imagine making this with tomato sauce - this sauce makes it extra, extra good!!  I didn't use evap. milk, I used regular 2% milk and I also have only used fresh hungarian wax peppers and broil or grill them and remove the skins -- out of this world!

Soo much easier than the fried version and nearly as good. My changes are:  I used fresh pablano (scorched, seeded and skinned) and stuffed them with Fresco Queso.  I used 3 egg whites, which I whipped into a meringue, and then added the yolks, canned milk and flour and continued whipping for another minute.   I used a mix of canned enchalada sauce with pureed chipoltle in adobo sauce.

The video shows 3 eggs not 2 (as in the recipe). I wonder if there was a mistake in the recipe.  I left out the milk like others suggested.  I also added piquante as another viewer suggested.  It was very soft.  Flavour was good though.  I wonder if an extra egg would fix that.  I know chili rellenos is soft but this didn't even hold together.

I’ve made this at least a dozen times in the last 6 months, and have to say it is one of my ULTIMATE favorites! I do take the advice of another review and use fresh roasted hatch chilies, and add a third egg! All said and done: I’m grateful to the person who initially submitted the recipe and want that person to know it will always remain a favorite in my kitchen!!

Excellent to use as written and can be easily tailored to your personal likes.   Definitely a keeper.  I did use fresh Pablanos though, couldn't find the canned chilis.

I added an extra can of the the whole green chillies because 2 didn't seem enough. I'm glad I bought that 3'rd can because it barely covered the 8X8 baking pan I used per another review I read. My son is kind of picky. But this he loved.

This was quiet a pleaser!  I added a few more eggs to make it a bit more robust and baked it a bit longer.  I found the mild enchilada sauce to be flavorful, but will use hot next time.  This recipe was super easy to put together and will definitely prepare it again perhaps adding some more veggies.

As is I'd rank this 4 stars. I thought this was tasty and easy to make. I made it a couple of times and my only big issue with this recipe is that it doesn't seem to call for enough green chilis. Two cans don't cover the pan well. Three cans is minimum IMHO. I have also tried using enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce per other reviewers, and it's probably a personal preference but I prefer to enchilada sauce.

It was ok.  I used enchilada sauce - maybe that is what taste 'off'.  Will not make again.

Giving it four stars due to the changes I made in the recipe.  Used fresh hatch chili's(8)  which I roasted peeled and seeded. Also used my homemade enchilada sauce on top   Put sliced green onions on top of the sauce.  This is a very good way to make chili relleno's for a crowd.  It also reheated in the microwave nicely.

Delicious!  Used fresh roasted Hatch chilis (8 of them), 3 eggs, and 9 oz of nonfat evaporated milk and no regular milk.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used enchilada sauce (homemade), as suggested by others. Definitely will make this again anytime Hatch chilis are in season and available. Amazing recipe.

Delicious as is! I wanted to expand the recipe so I added 5 eggs. I added more large chilis cause I wanted it spicier. Next time, I'd take the whole chilis and cut them in half so they weren't quite so huge to cut through. This would be super fun to make in a Pampered Chef Brownie pan or a muffin pan to make individual servings for brunch. Then served with jalapeños, diced green onions and cilantro on the side for optional toppings. I would definitely make this again!

Pretty good recipe with the change of using red enchilada sauce in lieu of plain tomato sauce. While eating this, my husband and I came up with a few different ingredients to add to the chili layers the next time I make this dish. What is so great about this recipe is it'd be really easy to modify it to accommodate personal preference and dietary need.

I am not impressed with this at all. It would make for a better dip than it did a casserole... it also did not resemble the taste of a real chili relleno at all. Definitely not making this again...

I made this for my husband who loves chili rellenos.  I used 8 oz. pepper jack cheese instead of jack and cheddar; 4 oz. sour cream instead of evaporated milk; and 3 eggs instead of two.  My husband loved it!

I just made this for lunch and it's delicious! I couldn't find any canned whole peppers, so I just roasted some pablanos. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I will definitely make it again.

I added ground beef cooked in taco seasoning between the chilis.  I also changed the tomato sauce to 8 oz of medium picante sauce.  Great!

This came out perfect for me! I was looking for a recipe that would make good leftovers for my boyfriend and I. I found it online and decided to give it a shot before reading any reviews on it. I think it is so yummy but only giving four stars because I think it required a couple of tweaks I made: 
Fresh cut poblano peppers (4 of them) instead of canned peppers. 
Added salt and pepper in each step. (on top of peppers, mixed in with eggs, on top of tomato sauce, etc...) 
Added finely chopped onions mixed in with the eggs and milk. I love onions and I think this made it smell and taste even yummier!
Added the last bit of cheese onto the dish and then put in the oven for the last 15 minutes. This made a tasty gooey cheese layer on top... :-) 
Overall I think it was delicious and I prefer a thinner casserole so it is good to me in the 9x13 pan. If you prefer a thicker casserole I'd definitely put it in a smaller pan though. 

Will be saving this one!!!

I read the reviews and also chose to use an 8×8 inch dish, used 3 eggs and left out regularly milk. I didn't like the tomato sauce or the enchilada sauce. I used Ortega Mild taco sauce which I think is the tastiest choice.

Was really great but had to make a few changes, 1st I added ground beef between the layers of chilies and cheese, then topped with rotel instead of tomato sauce and sprinkled jalapeños on top. Turned out great.

Great recipe!  This tastes very much like the Chilis Relenos we have had in Mexican restaurants. I served it with tortilla chips, more like an appetizer than a main course.  Next time I will make a better meal out of it by serving it with Spanish rice and black beans or refried beans on the side.  Based on others' reviews, I used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, left the milk out and used about half the amounts of cheese listed, and I subbed cornstarch for the flour to make it gluten free.  The can sizes listed made the recipe a bit confusing, since condensed milk normally only comes in 14 oz cans, and the only canned chili peppers I could find came in 4oz cans.  This may be the reason so many reviewers said to leave the milk out.  I assumed the weights listed were what was intended and used 14 oz of chili peppers and 5 oz condensed milk, (but I still left the milk out).  I think it might be just as good with milk instead of condensed milk, so I may try that next time.  This was worth 5 stars for me as it turned out, but because of the confusion and the need to reduce the cheese and leave much of the liquid (milk) out, I rated it 4.

I followed others suggestions 3 eggs, and 8x8 pan. I used both milks but use only a 5 oz can of evaporated milk, as stated in the recipe. I used a red enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and topped with sliced black olives and some sliced green onions. A favorite in my house!

I have made this a couple of times and everyone has loved it. I was hoping that there would be leftovers to make a breakfast burrito the next day, but there was never any left. I did use red chili sauce instead of tomato sauce. I had to improvise the first time because I was out of tomato sauce and it was so good I used it the next time also.

Flavor was spot on! Texture not so much since I felt there was no "binding ingredient". I read some of the reviews and followed some of the recommended variations: used enchilada sauce, fresh roasted green chiles, 4 eggs instead of 3, evaporated milk only,  added 1 pound of ground beef. Here's what I'll do next time to help it bind better: cut each green chile into 4 pieces instead of splitting it in the center, use wheat flour (I used rice flour instead), add mozzarella cheese, and reduce the other cheeses to 6-8 ounces.

Used Mexican blend cheese.  Made this twice and everyone loved it.  Tastes just like the Chili Rellenos I have ordered in Mexican Resturants.  Very good and so easy to put together.  Quick main dinner dish.  Serve with salad, yummers!

Followed recipe exactly except instead of two 7 oz can of chilis I used two 11oz can of chilis.  Came out tasty.  Topped with green onions.  I had some shredded chicken on the side that I ate with it. Read other reviews where enchilada sauce was recommended instead of the tomato sauce.  However, I usually like to follow recipe pretty exact when  making it for the first time to see how I like it. Taste great with the tomato sauce.  Next time I might just add shredded chicken in it.  Thank you for an awesome easy recipe.

This was indeed delicious and even my meat-loving husband really enjoyed it!  I also took the suggestion to add an extra egg, omit the milk and used red enchilada sauce.  My only complaint is that the pan (9 x 13) seemed too big.  Next time I will use the same recipe, but bake it in a smaller pan.

I really liked this recipe.  My husband went back for thirds!!!  I guess he liked it, too.  I added a whole head of cauliflower to this and increased all the ingredients by a third.  It was delicious, healthful, and very filling.

excellent casserole! I've made it now 3 times and it goes into our menu rotation with high marks. Made with canned Hatch chiles and home made enchilada sauce in an 8 x 8 pan makes the best cheesy easy to cut into squares casserole...

We have been making this with the poblano peppers we grow every summer.   After our first round of peppers, we realized that stuffing them was pointless; just roasted them on the grill or under the broiler, put in plastic bag for a bit, cut in half, de-seed and layer.   I've been looking for the eggs, milk, flour ratio because we haven't been adding that, so thanks!    And we use salsa verde instead of plain old tomato sauce to bake, then have regular salsa, sour cream and/or guac on the side to add.   When I met some girlfriends for lunch at a Mex restaurant I told them "I'm NOT ordering chili rellenos since we've already had it about six times this summer."    Next summer, I'm going to try the egg/milk/flour because I think that's what I've been missing out on.

I LOVE Chili Rellenos.  Can take a while to make if you do it the original (long) way.  This recipe takes the original recipe to the next level which makes it doable for the novice cook to the more experienced Chief.  I recommend this Chile Rellenos recipe to anyone  who loves the flavor and  just does not have the experience to make the old fashioned way.

Excellent and easy! Just throw it together, and it is great! I used 3 eggs, only the evaporated milk (not the other milk), and an 8x8"pan. After the first baking time, I poured a whole can of "fire roasted, salsa style tomatoes" (Walmart brand), and then finished the baking. Hubby and I ate the whole thing in one sitting.

This recipe is absolutely the best. The flavors are amazing. It is an easy casserole to make. I added 1-can of chopped green chilis to mine and as other reviewers have noted I used only the concentrated milk. Didn't use the regular milk. I also used 4 eggs in mine instead of the 2 I liked the way it turned out I will definitely be making this again so good! I also used the enchiladas sauce instead of the tomato sauce much better flavor, I also browned up a pound of hamburger and grilled the poblanos peppers!

This was delicious! I would like to say that I made the recipe as is, but I did make a few changes. First, the recipe as written shows 2 (7 oz) cans of whole green chiles. These were impossible to find. All I could find were jalapenos and there was NO WAY that would be enough to create two layers. I'm pretty sure it should say 27 ozs. That being said, I ended up buying fresh poblano peppers and roasting them in my oven first. I am a novice cook and this was very easy, except for the part of peeling them. I only used about 3/4 of the cheese (colby jack). I also used a full 12 oz. can of evaporated milk and left out the regular milk. I was skeptical about the tomato sauce, but I found "Spanish style" sauce in the hispanic section of the grocery store. This did have a better taste to it and wasn't as overpowering as enchilada sauce would be, as some reviewers have used as a substitue. One last thing I did was to fry up some chorizo and add a layer to the casserole.  This gave it GREAT flavor. 
I loved this dish and can't wait to have some leftovers for lunch today. My almost 18 yr old son liked it, but said it had kind of a burnt taste to it. I think that's because I wasn't able to get all the peppers peeled, so he may have had some charring. I will definitely try this again, this time looking for the canned peppers. Fresh is always better, but canned would be much easier.

I used twice as much of all ingredients except for the chilis.  I used the rectangular casserole dish called out in the original recipe.   Instead of using tomato sauce or red enchilada sauce, I went with green enchilada sauce.  Another change I made was to top with the remaining cheese then bake for 25 mins. Then I added the green sauce to the top.   I feel by using twice the eggs, evaporated milk and cheeses, it came out twice as fluffy like a relleno should be.

Loved this recipe. Used chopped green chilis and my wife and I both preferred this versus the typical whole chilis. Followed many of the reviews and added 1/2 lb cooked ground turkey and cooked in a 8" pan.  Thought the tomato sauce was fine but would try with the enchilada sauce next time for an added boost.

Tastes great but definitely not enough egg. It was runny. I used half the cheese and put in ground turkey (seasoned). Instead of tomato sauce I used enchilada sauce. Again, great flavor, verrrrry runny... hence the low score.

I've made this several times.  It's a super easy side dish and it reheats nicely.  It's also good for breakfast.  It's not going to win any culinary awards but it is super easy and very tasty.  And you could modify it lots of ways, I"m sure.

I used rice milk as a substitution since I'm lactose sensitive. The casserole ended up coming out mushy with no texture :( I paired it with rice, refried beans & served with tortilla on the side. Good dish, nice flavors.

I love diced chiles and cheese in my eggs for breakfast, and this kind of tastes like that, but it's a lot more work. I liked it, but I definitely didn't love it. I did read reviews and use enchilada sauce instead of ketchup, and I added olives and we ate it with tortilla chips, but it was just WAY too cheesy. And I love cheese. If I make this again I will add more eggs, cut the cheese in half, and add chicked to give it some substance. It has good bones, just needs some work.

This recipe was a hit, I did make my own substitutions as I prefer fresher ingredients. I used fresh roasted hatch chilies and I used Mexican cheese along with the cheddar. Everything else worked well even the tomato sauce (I didn't think it would be authentic) but since my dish was spicy because of the hatch chilies , it worked well to even out the heat. And was just as good the next day ! I would say if you really wanted to have a fresh ingredient dish use fresh sliced tomatoes on the top... that would be my choice next time.

Easy to follow instructions, not to mention most of the ingredients you may have in your pantry.   I love this simple and tasty recipe....it is a quick meal for the family, however you might want to double the recipe so it actually fits a 9x13 casserole dish and your family can have seconds.  Enjoy!

Made for husband. He wanted ground beef added, so I layered ground beef with homemade spice mix and onions between pepper layers. Cut back 1/4 of cheese , and added black olives and salsa.He loved it. This dish is a lot easier than making it one pepper at a time. It even tasted better the next day to me. I definitely will use this again. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't use tomato sauce at all or any other kind of sauce. I used all Monterrey jack cheese and fire roasted n peeled my own Anaheim green chiles from the garden to make it. For some extra heat one of the tines I made this dish I added hatch green chiles from Hatch, New Mexico. And topped mine after the oven with a fresh made pico de gallo with home grown veggies n cilantro.

Delicious!  I made with whole canned jalapenos and deseeded about half of them.  It was just the right amount of spice.  I also baked in 8x8 pan, used 4 eggs, 3 TBSP flour, and only 1 5oz can evaporated milk.  I also used a combo of monterey jack and chihuahua cheeses!  used red enchilada sauce.  perfect!

Keeping other comments in mind, I added an extra egg, doubled the recipe for one 9X13 pan, and topped it with enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.

MY variation to this recipe was.....I added cream cheese to each layer. (Layers: chilis, small cubes of randomly placed cream cheese, shredded Jack and cheddar cheeses...repeat). 

IT WAS DELICIOUS!! I will definitely be making this again!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out very soupy. The flavor was okay but the consistency was not good. Will just make chile rellenos next time.

This was so easy  and a great recipe!   If you want Poblanos  but don't have the time to prepare them, this will help your craving!  We make this all the time, and sometime add corm and black beans to the 2nd layer for a different variation.  Make sure you get the mexican tomato sauce. We sometime mix 1 hot can and 1 mild can for a little more kick...or a little less kick and then we freeze the rest.

I used canned mild Hatch peppers, no milk just evaporated milk, enchilada sauce , 3 eggs and added cumin to the egg mixture. I also added some shredded chicken to cover the peppers. Followed several of the suggestions. Turned out great. Cook an extra 10 mins. Also made with Jimmy Dean sausage crumbles. Rally good.

This is my favorite Mexican dish! I used fresh poblano chili peppers that I boiled for about 5 minutes after cleaning them out. Used 4 peppers. I used 3 eggs and enchilada sauce. Everyone loved it. I have someone at work who begs me for the leftovers!

I was quite concerned as I was building this, but the flavor was definitely good once it was all done. I didn't read other reviews before I made this, and I wish I had. It would have been better in a smaller dish and with more eggs. If I make this again, I'll use more of everything. The chilies were kind of hiding in there (the 7 ounce can only had 4 chilies in it, and 8 peppers definitely isn't enough for the size pan the recipe calls for). It also wasn't very filling as written. It would definitely benefit from being a thicker casserole. The flavors were quite good, though.

Made with recommended changes: 8x8 pan, 3 eggs, salsa instead of tomato sauce.  It was good and easy dish to make.  Left overs taste just as good.  Easy to modify based off of personal tastes.

Going to try with smoked hatch chile.

The recipe was great.  My husband recently turned vegetarian and I have been looking for meals that I can eat too.  This one reminded me of a good omelette.  I never had chili rellenos before but after this I'll make it again.  He even told me to make the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Great job.  I did use the enchilada sauce like the other reviewers suggested instead of the tomato sauce.

It seems like the foundation of a dish but not a completed one. If made as written, it ends up tasting like a really elaborate and bland omelette.

I doubled the recipe and took one to the local Firefighters Cinco de Mayo - they loved it!  Also, kept one for us.  It was good with the tomato sauce on top.  I think 8 servings is better, instead of 6.

We tried this last night.  We loved it.  I did make a few changes.  Basically because I didn't have as many green chilis as called for, I used some diced tomatoes on the second layer instead and added a little cumin to the tomato sauce.  Excellent!!

I'll be the first to admit that I've never had chili rellenos before so I have nothing to compare this to.  Saying that, I did not enjoy this dish.  I followed the recipe except to follow suggestions made by other chefs:  I used 3 eggs and substituted enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce.  The dish was very runny.  I cooked it a full 45 minutes OVER the time recommended in the recipe and it was still wet.  I ate it as a dip with tortilla chips just to fill my tummy.  I won't be making this again I'm afraid.

A fine beginning, but the recipe seems a bit lacking to me. For one thing, the recipe calls for two 7oz cans of whole chilis in a 9x13 baking dish and getting two layers. I used two 10oz cans in a 9x9 baking dish and got a single layer of chilis. One alteration that I had already decided on was adding some sauteed vegetables (some julienne peppers and onions, some mushrooms, a 15.25 oz can of black beans [drained and rinsed], and some spinach) to the tomato sauce with 1/2 tsp whole cumin seed, 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/4 dried oregano, a pinch of chili flakes, several drops of chipotle Cholula,  and two cloves of garlic. The full pound of cheese the recipe calls for seems excessive (which, as a cheese lover, was difficult for me to say, but it had to be done), so I used a half pound of colby jack and it worked fantastically. So the recipe as written is a nice beginning, but it seems incomplete.

I made this using only evaporated milk, no regular milk.  Also replaced enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce.  It was absolutely delicious!!!

This recipe was a nice change up from our typical Taco Tuesdays menu.  I couldn't find canned whole chiles so I oven roasted my own, which is very easy to do.  (Just roast in oven, turning until all sides are charred, then place in bowl cover with saran wrap and let sit for 5 minutes) The skins peeled easily and tasted great.  I also subbed enchilada sauce like several reviewers suggested.  Next time I think I will increase the eggs.  Tasty!

Giving this a 4 only because I used other reviews and omitted tomato sauce in favor of enchilada sauce.  Also added jalapeno and tomatoes to the top (let this cook for the 25 min before adding sauce). Otherwise followed recipe to the T and it was soooo good!

An  easy casserole to make. I followed some of the advice of others, increasing the eggs to three, cutting back on the cheese, and using enchilada sauce. I also topped it with green onions and black olives. After making the dish, I thought it would be easy to convert this casserole to other dishes, using broccoli or asparagus with the cheeses. Regardless, this recipe is a keeper and I plan to prepare it again and again.

After reading all the review, I also uses an 8x8 I tried 4 eggs instead of two but you could taste the eggs so I don't suggest that one. If to do it again I would use three eggs and I only used evaporated milk and the red enchilada sauce, as suggested. I thought it was okay, my wife did not like it but I will try again with some modifications.

Excellent!  I'd have given it 5 stars but thought it contained too much cheese, and the tomato sauce wasn't a good fit.  Next time I'll add cooked rice on the bottom layer, lessen the cheese, add another egg and use enchilada sauce.   But this is a great base recipe.

Everyone had seconds! Two mods: (1) used pureed Ro-Tel instead of tomato sauce (because that's what we had on hand), and (2) added 1 lb of cooked ground homemade ginger-sage sausage underneath the Ro-Tel prior to the final 15 minutes of cooking.

Omg! This was delicious! I used fresh peppers (not to hard to peel  if you brush evoo  on them &  then broil). I also used only evaporated milk & substituted tomato sauce with mild enchilada sauce (about half the can). I added ground beef in the center. Cooked the ground beef first with onions and red and green bell peppers...it made it a very hearty dish!  I finished it with chopped green onions over the top. I will make this again!

This was really good as is...well with enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. The 2nd time I added olives, a can of shredded chicken and doubled the green chilis to make it more of a meal.

Loved this so much!  I hate when folks criticize and then change the ingredients.  But I did follow some of the earlier suggestions and used the smaller 8x8 pan, only half a cup of milk, 3 eggs, enchilada sauce and browned about a pound of ground beef with a half a chopped onion.  I would never have tried it without this recipe as a starting point.  So, thank you!

LOVE! I have made this several times and have to agree with the other reviewers and the Allrecipes video. Use 3-4 eggs, only the evaporated milk and top with enchilada sauce. I have used both the red and green enchilada sauces and both are wonderful but I prefer using the Hatch Red Enchilada Sauce (medium heat).

Used fresh anaheim and jalapeno peppers, 3 eggs instead of 2, enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce, wheat flour instead of all purpose and I only used the evaporated milk.
I also added in ground beef that I cooked prior with various seasonings (cumin, cayenne, salt, pepper) and chopped onion. Drained grease, then placed on top of the bottom layer of chiles and cheese. Add another layer of cheese on top, then placed on the remaining half of chiles.
Also, I let the casserole rest for 10-15 minutes, then served. Overall, a great dish! Just a few tweaks!

This was really good; my mom and husband called it "restaurant quality." I didn't have cheddar cheese on hand, so I used a mexican cheese blend; I also substituted the tomato sauce for a can of red enchilada sauce.  I didn't layer the chiles b/c there weren't enough for that, but just laid them all out on the bottom of the pan (wouldn't hurt to add another can).  I served with mexican rice.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I made for a bunch of British friends and even though it was delicious they thought it was too hot.  I used a mild enchilada sauce instead of the tomato for flavor, that was definitely a smart move from other reviews.  Will make again just not for my British friends!

I had to make extra so I upped the recipe by a third and on the second layer of chili's I added some seasoning such as a light dusting of Cumin, garlic powder, chili seasoning , oh yea I also roasted Poblano pepper in the oven under the broiler till skin was blackened, then steamed in Tupperware  with residual heat for 15 min, then removed skin and seeds, laid flat and dried on tea towels in place of the canned chili's. My wife LOVED it told me that's is going to be Christmas dinner this year!

Made the changes as suggested from others.  3 eggs, enchilada sauce.   Add some cooked italian sausage and some roasted onion.  Used 4 freshly roast pablanos chopped into bite sized piece instead of canned chilis.

my husband and I both loved this.

We tried as is and decided we would prefer it with some meat added.   Have made this adding chicken and once added ham, both were good. When made with chicken, we added 1 teaspoon of taco seasoning to the tomato sauce.  This recipe is easy and VERY forgiving,  Play with it!  Thank you Clarissa2

My husband brought home some beautiful fresh poblano peppers and wanted chile relleno. I didn't want to do that much work (or frying), so I started looking for other recipes. Made it for the first time today and will keep it for future use. Used fat free evaporated milk  & 2% milk. Used 8 oz. of queso fresco that I crumbled, along with with about 2 oz. of reduced fat shredded sharp cheddar (my husband isn't a big fan of cheese). Like the idea of enchilada sauce. Since I had them on hand, I used diced tomatoes with habañero peppers (drain them first). Served with fat free refried beans and rice.

We loved this dish. I made a few adjustments,  I used the evaporated milk and none of the regular milk. I used 5 eggs instead of 3, I added a dash of cayenne pepper,  3 tables spoons of flour instead of 2, and half a jalapeno as well. I used red enchilada sauce on top because we love spicy food!

This has become a 'go to' recipe at my house. I've made it as written which was good, but after making a few tweaks it turned into 'great - don't change a thing' for my husband.  It's super quick and easy when using canned chilis, but you can also roast your own under the broiler, let them sweat for about 20 minutes in a covered container or plastic bag, peel the char and slice in half to flatten and use in this recipe.

Instead of a 9x13, I use a 8x8 pan, adding 10 minutes to the baking time. In the making of the recipe I use (4) large eggs, 3 TB flour, (1) 10 ounce can of red enchilada sauce and 16 ounces of Mexican blend cheese. 

This couldn't be easier to make or more delicious, with leftovers being fantastic too - if there are any!  I serve this dish with a side of refried beans and tortilla chips.

Very good and easy. Like most people say, use enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Duh. An extra egg is good too. Spice it up with a little hot stuff to taste. Not as good as a good Mexican restaurant but pretty good for us gringos.

This is a family favorite.  I use a 12 oz can evaporated milk and eliminate the 1/2 cup milk and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.

Better than the real thing!
We loved this. I wanted it to be more of a breakfast item, so added some stale bread cubes.  I used diced peppers and half & half instead of evap milk. I cut down some on the cheese, but it still poured out when I cut into the casserole. I topped it with enchilada sauce as others recommend and that added great flavor.

I tried this recipe with a few changes.  I used canned jalapenos and lined them on a 9x13 baking dish.  I used the jalapenos because I was at the grocery store and couldn't recall what pepper it called for. I like jalapenos so I thought that sounded good.  Fresh would have been better of course.  I also used half and half for the milk, cheddar cheese, three eggs and tomato sauce.  I did remember to buy enchilada sauce, but after I opened the can I tasted it and didn't like the taste at all.  I like tomato sauce and knew the sweetness would cool the bite of the jalapenos.  I love this dish and so does my family.  I will make again.

A good go-to that is quick and especially great next day or so as it settles nicely. Video shows enchilada sauce and that is a good call, rather than tomato.

This was not a meal! We ended up ordering pizza! It was tasty but more of dip than a meal! We ate it with tortilla chips! If I make this again I will try variations. Such as not using milk. And adding more eggs!

Wow!  This is fantastic.  It is going to be a regular dish.  I roasted poblano peppers the day before (couldn't find canned or jar), put in paper bag to cool.  Took skin off before using in casserole.  Didn't have evaporated milk, used a little heavy cream (around 1/4 cup) and 2% milk as in recipe.  Used 3 eggs like others suggested and 4-6 oz cheese (jack and cheddar).  I put a little of the cheese on the top before adding egg mixture.  Spooned enchilada sauce over casserole when plated.

I used poblano peppers, roasting them in the oven, then steaming them for 15 min., so the skin comes off easily. I also added a pound of lean ground beef prepared with 1/2 of an onion chopped, and a package of mild taco mix. Instead of the egg and flour mix, I prepared a package of Jiffy Cornbread Mix with 2 eggs & 1/2 cup of milk, then spread over the second layer of peppers and cheese, and mixed a 1/2 cup of red enchilada sauce with the can of tomato sauce for extra zip. It turned out delicious. However, it was a tad bit too spicy, so next time, I'll use the canned chilies instead.

Love this recipe, I hadn't made this dish for years but had vague memories of making it. I used an extra large loaf pan and the whole chili's worked great with their triangle shape when cut open and placed top to bottom. I also used a green enchilada sauce since it was on sale and never remembered having them with a red sauce. I also salted and peppered the eggs and just used the canned milk with the 3 eggs. I also used a little pepper jack cheese with the other cheeses and drizzled the green sauce on it between the layers also. Browning the top layer of cheese is a must. Sliced it like bread and drizzled more enchilada sauce on when reheating. Rave reviews and keeps getting better as leftovers.

I made this today, Outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just couldn't go 100% by the recipe, it's not in my nature. I roasted 4 poblano peppers instead of getting canned chilies. I also used Quesadilla cheese in place of jack cheese, green enchilada sauce in place of tomato sauce, and I subbed 2 egg yolks for one of the eggs. I plan on using this recipe frequently!

There was way too much cheese for this recipe and no one in my family liked the texture of the whole chiles - they thought it was too much. We are used to the chopped green chiles that are sprinkled, but the amount in this recipe, again, was way too much. The whole dish was such a disappointment.

A former professional cook, this is my first ever review on any website. i tried the basic recipe with several changes based on the reviews, and added garnishes as my own addition.
for a 9X13 pan, i roasted 8 good sized anaheim chilis (peeled, seeded, and whole), 8 oz. each of jack and cheddar cheeses, 5 eggs, 4-5 T. flour, 1 twelve oz. can of evaporated milk plus 1/2 cup whole milk, 1 tsp. ground cumin mixed into egg mixture, 1/2 tsp. hot sauce mixed into 12 oz. red enchilada sauce, followed the directions accordingly with these ingredients cooking 30 minutes first and 20 minutes after adding sauce, cheese and olives, i sprinkled some extra cheese after removal from oven and let set 7-8 minutes for easier cutting. i garnished with diced avocados, chopped green onions, cilantro, shredded lettuce, sliced seeded jalapeno (or serrano) peppers, sour cream, fresh salsa (or chopped tomatoes), and restaurant quality tortilla chips. i fixed this for 2 gourmet chefs and a few others, served it all buffet style, followed with mexican flan for dessert. no one knew exactly what the casserole was, but everyone loved it. there wasn't a bite left. i told them it was a genuine mexican dish served u.s. style. no other explanation was necessary. they were all too busy eating!

I tried the recipe, in fact have a rendition (supposedly in "review"past 3 years) that is very close, but I wanted to see what it was like.  It was o.k., but it needed more spices or enchilada sauce.  Mine uses plain milk, one more egg, & enchilada sauce (not tomato sauce, & Hatch brand or home-made.  A/R has excellent ones to try!!!).  BUT, the biggest difference is HOW I used it:  I make a crustless quiche!!!  (Crustless because I dislike crust).  Not just for breakfast, but it's so popular I serve at all times!  I even took premade tart crusts, put crusts in baggie for later & used the little pans, for hors douvres (sp) but that was in the 1980's.  I now have a tart sized pan.  !  Just have to adjust cooking times, whatever you cook it in!  350 degrees works no matter what!  Tons of recipe requests & compliments when I do my recipe, but, unfortunately I didn't get raves with this original recipe with the tomato sauce.  Blessings

This was just ok. I'm not sure what we did wrong. It was quite soupy. I used 3 eggs and just the evaporated milk and enchillada sauce. I wouldn't make this again.

I used my homemade enchilada sauce.  I had to roast some poblanos, since Publix did not have any whole peppers.  I used 3 eggs and an 8X8 ish square dish as suggested.  Absolutely wonderful!  Oh, I did not add the regular mild.  Just the evaporated milk.  I'm sure I used a little extra cheese....being that I didn't measure it exactly!

Family loved it and fought over the leftovers for lunch.   Alterations: fresh poblanos (roasted and skinned), Soy/almond milk instead of condensed, Queso Fresco, mild salsa (2 tomatoes, onion, garlic, jalapeno, salt - cooked down and reduced) instead of tomato paste, 9x9 dish.  Next time will use 3 eggs and more/roasted jalapenos.

We love chile rellenos anyway.. and it is surprising how much this casserole tastes just like them.  I used Mild whole chiles in a can ( large can).. and upped the eggs to 3, the flour to 4 and used the entire can of evaporated milk.  I also made 2 layers of chiles ( blotting the chiles dry onto layers of paper towel ), and cheese before pouring the batter type mixture on top. Used a 9X13 pan sprayed well with cooking spray and took it out at 35 mns.. to pour green enchilada sauce ( 1 - 8 oz can) over the top and another sprinkling of shredded mexican cheese blend, back in the oven for additional 10 mns. ..awesome and super easy!!

It was ok, but a little too flat since it's just cheese and canned peppers.  Wish it had more fresh ingredients for nutrients and thickness.

I usually make regular chiles relleno, with NM long green chiles or poblanos. It's labor-intensive but delicious. I've always heard of this casserole, but have been hesitant to try it instead of my usual method. Finally gave it a try, & it was great! I used some NM green chile I had frozen, but canned whole chiles would work fine here. I actually made two layers of chile, cheese, & some picadillo had had leftover from tacos (chiles relleno often contain meat--don't know why previous viewer seemed unsure about that). I used the Mexican cheese blend from Kraft. I also omitted the extra milk, using just the 5 oz can of evap milk. I even subbed Bisquick for the flour. It helped to make the topping lighter & puffier. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a small can of green chile enchilada sauce. I cooked this in a deep 8 inch casserole dish, & after the first  25 minutes, when I added the sauce, it took an hour or so, rather than 15 minutes, to get done. In fact, I poked a few holes in the topping to let some of the sauce run down into the dish. It turned out just beautifully, with a puffy green topping. With my alterations, I give this 5 stars. You can make this as spicy as you like. Top with some black olives, sour cream or crema, & enjoy!

Yummy! and easy!! I know it's annoying when people rate a recipe then add all their changes, but here goes... I did what other reviewers suggested, and used the whole can of evaporated milk and didn't use the regular milk.  I couldn't find Poblano chilis so I settled for Anaheim chilis, I roasted them and placed them in a bag for a few minutes then peeled and seeded them, I feel it made a definitely difference in the taste as compared to the canned chilis, that also have added salt that I don't need. I used mild enchiladas sauce and I was generous with the cheese.  I made it the night before my ladie's luncheon and reheated it covered with foil, added the sliced olives at the end of the heating.. it was devoured!! yum yum!!

I love the versatility of this recipe.  For more of a southwestern taste, I used fresh, roasted poblano peppers which I thought were delicious but the rest of the family thought were too spicy.  Also, after lining the bottom with chilies, I layered with slices of provolone, then canned chicken I had seasoned with sauted, chopped onions and Kirklands mesquite seasoning, then a layer of pieces of cooked bacon.  On top of the final layer of chilies, I poured a mixture of 3 eggs, 1/2 cup whole milk, 2 Tbsp cornstarch.  I cooked as directed, then poured a puréed can of tomatoes with green chilies on top followed by loads of fresh grated mozzarella.  Awesome flavor!  Thanks for the great recipe.

So good! I had already planned on making rellano's for dinner but was tired so looked up this recipe instead. So glad I did! I used 3 poblano peppers and 2 green bell peppers diced. It made it easier when dishing up for my kids. I have 3, 4, and 8 year olds and they ate every bite! I do think I will try it with enchilada sauce next time though.

Very good, but I doubt I would have felt the same if I would've used tomato sauce and canned chilis. I roasted my own in the oven. 350 degrees, on foil, about 10 minutes on each side, peeled, deseeded, and cut them in half. I used a can enchilada sauce, instead. I added quite a bit of Texas Pete hot sauce to the egg/flour mix for a bit of an extra kick. And broiled the cheese on top for an extra 5-10. I couldn't stay out of it. This recipe has potential and can easily be tweaked!

This Is great recipe. I've always wanted to find something that was lighter( less greasy) than the original chile rellenos. I'm Mexican and all my life grew up with chile rellenos. This is great substitute for that dish. It is easy to make. I don't follow the recipe exactly only cause I didn't have those cheeses handy. I used mozzarella cause it was the one I had. I also didn't use canned chiles but the original Padilla chile. Peeled just like if I was making chile rellenos. I also used la Victoria enchilada sauce rather than tomato. U can actually put any sauce over it if u like. Home made ir store bought. Everything else I followed. Every time I read reviews on recipes I try to read the once that aren't changed and that follows the exact recipe. I only change it cause I was going to make the original chile rellenos but last minute I found this recipe and decided to try it. Even though I change it from the original I know that this recipe will be GREAT if its followed to the T. I will be making this recipe many more times. Delicious!!!!

Escellent dish.  I used 8 fresh anaheim peppers that had been skinned under a 500°C broiler for ~ 10 minutes.  Also removed the seeds as my wife does not like picante' foods.

I saw this recipe and it looked really good. I wanted chili rellenos without the mess. I omitted the flour, milk and evaporated milk. (It just sounded better without them) and I used enchildada sauce in place of tomato sauce.  Also, *very important for consistency*, I beat the egg whites till fluffy and then mixed in the egg yolks.

A good base recipe, but needs work to be good. Definitely sub the tomato sauce for enchilada sauce.  Use 2/3~3/4 of the listed cheese amount.  I used 4 5oz cans of chiles, I think cutting them into big chunks would work better.  The recipe also really needs some meat added to the middle layer for a complete meal or it's just too cheesy.

Sadly, this wasn't what I hoped it would be.  I will say that it has the flavor of Chile Relleno I was looking for, however I have to agree with everyone else - the consistency was too strange.  We ate ours and my husband loved it, but I was hoping for more of a crust consistency.  I gave it 3 stars because my husband liked it enough to eat it.

I really liked it, but my husband said he'd rather not have this in the regular meal rotation. I think that it turned out a little undercooked, and the chilis should have been sliced into smaller pieces. I will try it again slicing the chilis into roughly 1" pieces and baking for an extra 5-10 minutes.

This was fantastic!  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and sliced the chilis.  I also used only 8 oz of shredded cheddar and skipped the other cheese - it was perfectly cheesy this way without being too much.  My husband loved this too and said it was a keeper!

This was super easy and had great flavor.   However, it really didn't hold up like a casserole.  It seemed more like a cheese dip. If you are a cheese love, you won't be disappointed - it's loaded with cheese.  We followed the recipe as written, except we did substitute in enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  My husband and I both thought it could use something else for stability.  The egg/milk/flour mixture did not hold it together at all.  Next time, I think I will try to put cornbread in for the first layer, and halve the amount of cheese.  I also thought shredded chicken would be a great addition.

Yum!  Followed suggestions of other users and made the following changes: 8 X 8 pan (a must!), one can enchilada sauce, 3 eggs, omitted evaporated milk and just used 1 cup milk. Delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe and feel that it makes a great breakfast too.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and used three eggs and I am so glad I did.  I accidentally purchased one can of the whole and one can of the diced chili's, and the diced definitely added a more bitter taste so as another review stated I would not recommend using them.  I also did not have enchilada  sauce, so I substituted zesty tomato sauce. I will make this again (minus the diced chili's)!

We all enjoyed this. I coarsly chopped the chilies, added some onion powder & only used the evaporated milk.  I think I may try using a little more flour next time to firm up the consistency.

Reviews seem to be love or hate, so I figured I would give my opinion in case there are others out there with similar tastes. My husband, who would probably never order Chili Rellenos at a restaurant said that the chilies were bitter to him (they were the canned ones) and he did not like the texture. I generally love Chili Rellenos, but I do not like omelets, especially the cheese/egg combo, and this was a little too close to an omelet flavor for my taste. I know most people love omelets, so I am sure most people will really like this.

The flour mixture for this was a little thin, but the overall taste was pretty good. Next time I will use more enchilada sauce and I will thicken up the flour mixture with a little more flour. Thanks!

This was not good.  I had to cook it a lot longer than what it said to because it didn't set.  When it did finally set, it was not very firm like it looked in the pictures.  I made this exactly like they said to in the recipe so I don't know why mine turned out so bad.  The taste was ok, but the texture -- I made spanish rise from this site with this dish and mixed together which worked.  Will not make this again.

This was such a great recipe but I felt it lacked something substantial so I did change it a 'little'. I added fried pork chops,didn't add the flour mixture (really just forgot) and cumin seasoning and cajun seasoning. All made for a great dish! I made this dish again today on 5/25/2015, this time I put sausage in and it was great

This was super quick, especially since I had shredded Mexican cheese blend on had. I don't know how someone got that nice fluffy picture, ours was pretty thin and dense. It got 3 out of four thumbs up from our house. The 5 year old thought it was too spicy (kind of expected that), but the 4 year old asked for seconds!

This was really, really, really, really good. Really good. Can you tell I liked it? I messed up though. It didn't look like it was going to be much, so I added extra milk but only one extra egg, so it was runny in the center. We'll eat the outside, though. lol I used Enchilada sauce. This was one of the easiest things to make. My husband loves Mexican food, so is very happy I made this. I will make this often. Thank you!

I made a double recipe of this for dinner.  I added a full 12 oz. can of evaporated and upped the floor a bit to compensate for the increased moisture.  I found using so much cheese to be a little oily.  I liked the taste of the enchilada sauce.  Overall this is very similiar to a stratta.

Just to throw in my two cents:  This is a really good, interesting recipe.  Fixing it for a second time, I added hamburger to make it a substantial main course served with rolls and a salad - delicious.

The recipe was very easy to make. The taste was O.K.
I personally would not serve this to guests in my home, as this seems to casual/informal. I rate this as a family style meal.
Based off of the many recipes I have made from this website I can not say that this was the best recipe that I have tried, therefore I can not give it a 5.

Not bad!  Like other suggested, i used enchilada sauce instead of tomato, a little more than half the suggested amount if cheese. i also added a layer of chicken between the chiles.  Other than that, i followed the recipe.  i'd make it again.

I really didn't care for this at all - but my husband loved it and wants to have it again! That won't be happening with me as the cook - but I guess I'll just give it a neutral rating. I did not like the taste of the canned chile peppers at all. And, it seemed real "eggy" like a Mexican fritata or quiche. Just not what I expected a "Chile Rellenos Casserole" to consist of. I will keep searching for a more traditional recipe for Chile Rellenos. Something more like what you would be served at a Mexican restaurant.

Best on changes that other talked about (not a lot of milk, less cheese, one more egg, used salsa instead of tomato sauce) this was very tasty.  I also used the smaller pan.  It still came out thin.  I might double the recipe next time.

This was good.  I added ground beef on top on the chiles to make it a more hearty meal. I also used 3 eggs, as other reviews suggested and I found it to be too "eggy", which I didn't like. Next time, I will only use 2 eggs. I also used enchilada sauce in place of tomato sauce. Overall, a very easy and yummy dish.

After reading all the reviews, I used 3 eggs, both milks and put into two 8x8's instead of one 9x13.  I found a large can of Hatch chile's at super walmart and used them (so much better than the other brands!) I used Las Palmas red enchilada sauce, but next time I think I'll not use any at all.  It was really, really good!  I'm going to try to freeze the other pan to see how it turns out re-heated!

4 or 5 stars... Great recipe with a few changes.  I used whole pablano peppers, then cut off the ends (removed the seeds) and stuffed them with browned lean ground beef that had been marinating with a can of enchillada sauce.  Stuff some cheese in the peppers for extra flavor.  I also found that we didn't need to add a second bag of cheese when it was all finished cooking..just use 1 Mexican/fiesta cheese package when the recipe calls for it (before putting the casserole in the oven).  These changes really make this a fantastic entree.  We serve it with yellow Goya rice.

This was awesome! I fire roasted fresh Anaheim chilis, diced them and mixed with one small can of green chilis. Also used green salsa verde instead of tomato. My husband loved it!

My family and I love chili rellenos, but it was such a hassle to clean them, stuff them, etc., etc., and all that grease when you fry them.  This recipe is absolutely fantastic and so easy!  The only variation I made was to substitute Pepper Jack cheese. I will make this on a regular basis from now on.

This just goes to show that everyone has different tastes. I was excited to make this having high hopes after reading the reviews.  I did not care for the canned peppers.  I think it ruined what might have been good.  Boyfriend loved it though.

This was soooo delicious!  My husband said that it was one of the best things I've ever cooked him!  I added some Mexican seasoning (chili and garlic powder, etc) to the egg/flour mixture, and I served it with extra tomato sauce.

This was ok, but the flavor isn't for us.  I'll admit to making the changes suggested  (I used a 5 oz can of evap milk and no additional milk, an additional egg and used enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce), but it may have been that I used chopped chiles that was really the problem.
Thanks for something new to try!

My husband and I enjoyed this (though my 2 yr old and 4 yr old wouldn't touch it, but that's not all that surprising).  It was very good (but not out-of-this-world) which is why I give it 4 stars.  I would definitely make it again and thought it was very easy.  I did make some changes according to other reviewers.  Used 8x8 pan, used only the 12 oz can evaporated milk, used 3 eggs and a little less cheese, added black beans (would have been fine without the beans, too), and used 3 cans of chiles.  With the smaller pan I had to bake it an extra 10-15 minutes, and I let it rest 10 minutes.  Next time I'll sub some enchilada sauce for spiciness instead of the tomato sauce since my kids don't want to eat this anyway!

OK. I thought it was a little greasy and pretty spicy. I've never had chili rellenos in a restaurant so I didn't have anything to compare it to. Won't make again.

This was good, but did not turn out as expected.  I did leave out the extra 1/2 c. milk & added an extra egg and it was still very liquidy when we served it.  I would reduce the amount of evap. milk next time.  It also took much longer to cook than the time stated (1hr total) but finally puffed up in the end.  We added black (soy) beans to the mixture instead of meat which was good and enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce and half the cheese (8oz total which seemed plenty).

My husband and I loved this recipe. I cant stop talking about it. I used a 8x8 and I already had tomato paste on hand so I watered it down a lot, added some hot sauce, and just put 8 oz on top.

This casserole was nice and cheesy.  It was a bit thinner than I expected.  Cutting the chiles in half helped spread out the flavor.  It seemed to improve the next day.  I served it with the Black Bean and Salsa soup from this website (very easy to make) and they were excellent together.

I made this recipe as is.  I liked it, my husband liked it, but my two kids didn't(ages:1 1/2 & 3: it was the chilies). I told my husband about the changes other people had made to the recipe and he said, "I like it just the way it is".
