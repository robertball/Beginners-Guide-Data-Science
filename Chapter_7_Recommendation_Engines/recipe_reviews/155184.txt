This was great!  Tastes just like the homemade Pozole my  Mexican friends make!  I cubed and browned 2lbs of chicken.  Then in large pot browned 1 large onion and 3 cloves of garlic - added chicken, water, chicken broth, 2 Tbsp chile powder, dash of salt, and oregano and left it cook for about 80 min.  Then added hominy and cilantro.  Served with lime, radishes, tostadas.

Yum yum yum yum yum!  This was great.  Instead of cooking the chicken I used a store bought roasted chicken and took the skin off.  I didn't have enough but it still turned out fine.  The only other modifications I did were to cut back to 1T of oil, use Mexican oregano instead of regular, and I only used about 3T of chili pepper because we don't like really spicy food.  This amount was perfect for us.  The broth tasted just like restaurant Posole...the only difference was the chicken instead of pork but that was just as good or even better!

I have been looking for a long time for an easy posole recipe. This is it!! My husband is Mexican and when I go to his families house they use other kinds of meat and I didn't want to have to go through the hassle like they did. My husband came home from work and I served this with some radishes, lime, and little raw cabbage for toppings. He loved it!! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this the other day and it was good. It was lacking a little taste, so I added a can of enchilada sauce. WOW what a difference! My husband LOVED IT! I garnished it with onion, shredded cabbage and lime juice added a little hot sauce and it was almost as good as my mami's posole. I will make this again

I first had Posole in Mexico on a missions trip.  I use cumin and cilantro.  Have chopped cilantro, chopped green onion tops and other condiments when serving to add various flavors. This is my favorite winter soup.

Great recipes, this is similar to what my mexican mother has been making for years, except she makes her with beef. I doubled up on the hominy and chili powder as we like things a little spicier. Thanks!

I made this recipe for my very picky husband and he loved it! His family is from Mexico and so when I cook Mexican food it is always compared to theirs however, this is a recipe he actually talked to his mom about! YES! FINALLY! SOMETHING HE LIKES! If you are a Posole fan this recipe is for you. It's simple and it still turns out to taste authentic! I brought left overs into work the next day and my co-workers loved it too.

Mexican comfort food! My family's recipe is slightly different: 1) use pork tenderloin, brown it the pot along with garlic and onion. 2) Add chicken broth (reduced to 1 cup) and use 3-4 cups of salsa verde (home-made or Herdez).   3) Skip chili powder and add finely chopped cilantro 4) let simmer for 1-2 hours until meat is tender, then remove from pot and shred with a fork. 5) return the meat to the pot, add hominy. 6) simmer for another 15 minutes at least.  Serve with shredded cabbage, lime wedges, and sliced radishes.

Ever since I came back from Acapulco, I have been looking for an easy, basic pozole recipe and I think this is it!  I added an extra clove or two of garlic and added a couple extra dashes of salt. Other than that it was AWESOME!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Just made a double batch of this for our New's Year day family gathering and it was a huge hit.  Did everything exactly according to the recipe, right down to the garnishes.  Everyone pronounced it authentic-tasting and the aroma in the house was terrific!  I also can feature it with a dollop of sour cream and/or shredded cheese.  Thank you, deedee, for a wonderful recipe!

I have a Mexican boyfriend that always compares my food to his mom's, so needless to say he can be a harsh critic. However, he LOVED this posole and said that it was just as good as his mom's! I did add extra chili powder and also some ground cumin (about 1 1/2 teaspoons), and added one bay leaf, but other than that I followed the recipe. I served this with lime and tostadas. This tastes amazing, and I will be making it frequently!

Great flavor and pretty easy to make. Loved it.  Only change was to add a little cumin (antioxidant). Posole is a great version of chicken soup or broth, similar to what Vietnamese pho is for beef broth. Adding the garnishes at the end: lime, onion, radish and fresh chopped cilantro makes the soup flavor pop, so don't skip or leave them out!

Really Good!  The first time I made this recipe I cooked the chicken in a slow cooker, then shredded and transferred to stovetop for step 2.   The only other thing I changed was to add one-half teaspoon each of Cumin and Cayenne Pepper because we like spicy.   The next time I cooked the chicken as the recipe was written but I definitely prefer the chicken in the slow cooker, it was much more tender.   I will make this recipe again & again!

Wonderful recipe and fine the way it is but I like to add a little red chili powder and some cumin. My family loves it both ways.  Thank you for sharing.

This is awesome!  I added enchilada sauce & cook the onions in it. I served ours with sliced radishes, shredded cabbage, finely chopped onion, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges. I will make this often!

I haven't had posole since I was a kid growing up in Southern California. I was leery of this recipe thinking that it couldn't match the posole I had back then. What a surprise! This was excellent! The only change I made was to add a little cumin to the recipe. I served homemade tortillas with it. No leftovers!

Bravo! Grilling rather than boiling the chicken adds so much flavor. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and oregano prior to cooking. I also used extra garlic and a shallot, and omitted the extra salt (strongly recommend others do this too). It was incredibly tasty and yes, authentic.

Really altered the recipe as to what I had on hand but don't think it changed the taste that much.  Used leg quarters instead of breasts, didn't think the extra 3 cups of water was necessary and cut back chili powder to 3 T.  Used freshly made golden hominy and home made broth.  Just a touch of cumin and the flavor blew me away!!!  Would have loved to have had the lime wedges and the cilantro...this is a truly authentic recipe!!!  Made this for a friend who has just finished radiation for breast cancer and has lost her appetite...but she said she loved Posole and after tasting this recipe, ate a large portion.  Thanks very much!!!

I cooked the chicken in the crock pot and added it with the broth and spices.  I only did 2.5TB of chili powder and 1 tsp of salt.  It turned out great!  I topped it with the tostadas, cilantro, limes, shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, and avocado.

I loved this posole! I live in the southwest and this rivals many restaurant posoles. I did substitute the chilli powder for dried ancho chiles pureed (3 chiles) for a more authentic taste. I used Mexican oregano and added some cumin. I also added a can of diced tomatoes in their juice. It was a great soup!!!

Very good stuff.  I like the spice level.  I thought chicken fried in a pan would be a hassle to shred, so I did it in the crock pot with the water and broth, cooked it on high maybe 2-3 hours.  After that it almost shreds itself.  Then I cooked the garlic w/just a bit of oil in my mini saucepan, and didn't use the onion.  From there, everything was as is.  Though I did only use the tortilla chips and cilantro for garnishes.

How wonderful it was to find a recipe much like the one my dad used each year!  I had smoked turkey left over from Thanksgiving so I used that instead of chicken but it turned out fantastic!! Easy to make and freezes wonderfully!

So simple, yet so flavorful and filling! I accidentally bought golden hominy, but the taste didn't seem to suffer, and I didn't use chili powder. Added lime juice and half a can of Mexican Rotel to the cooking broth, simmered as directed, and garnished our bowls with shredded lettuce, chopped cilantro, and lime. It was amazing! We're even thinking of making a huge batch and throwing a Posole Dinner Party for the start of winter!

This recipe was very easy to follow and turned out great! I garnished it with avocado slices and tortilla strips and served it with mango margaritas. Great family dinner and I was able to freeze the rest for use on a night I don't feel like cooking.

We loved this!  My good friend who has been making posole forever suggested adding a can of enchilada sauce.  I added the enchilada sauce and cut the chili powder to 2 tsp.  I can't tell you how often we eat it.  It is one of our favorite meals.  Thank you deedee for the recipe!

Turned out amazing! The only thing I changed was that I boiled my chicken with some onions, lime, and cilantro to cook it instead of in a skillet. I find its easier to shred that way. I also added some garlic salt. Even my picky (read: impossible) eater fiance loved it!

Very good..The only difference I do is add ground cumin, add pulp from ancho chiles (and the liquid used to boil), use double the hominy, and I use Fiesta Brand Menudo Mix Seasoning instead of the Chile Powder. Overall...very delicious recipe that anyone can use to create their own :)

Very good taste but VERY VERY SPICY!  Next time I will need to use 1/4 the amount of chili powder.  Other then that it was wonderful topped with sour cream, cheddar cheese, cubed avocado, onions and tortilla chips!

This was a good recipe that made tons of leftovers.  I ended up using dry hominy and could've cooked it a little longer but it was perfect on day two!

This is so easy! I've been to lots of Mexican parties and eaten posole and this tastes exactly the same. My husband is from Mexico and he is hard to please when it comes to making authentic Mexican dishes. He loved this and it has become a regular in our dinner rotation. The only thing I do differently is to use chicken thighs (the dark meat has more flavor) and I reduce the chili powder. I boil the thighs, then remove them when they are done, pour the remaining liquid through a strainer and save the broth. I add it back where the recipe calls for it, adding more water and some chicken bouillon if needed. I don't want it too spicy because of the kiddos so usually one, maybe two tablespoons of chili powder is sufficient. Also, I'm usually in a hurry so I've never let it simmer 90 minutes. Maybe 20 max. We garnish with chopped radishes, lettuce, fresh squeezed lime, and sometimes crushed tostadas. One of my favorite meals, and easy and quick to prepare.

Great Recipe! Only thing I must say is please use New Mexico chili powder, or California Chili powder. It really makes a HUGE difference. Also, if you don't feel like doing the chicken, buy a rotisserie chicken instead. I also topped mine with shredded cabbage instead of lettuce. I could eat this everyday!

very tastey!! For an even faster weeknight meal I used a store bought rotisserie chicken and just shredded it. Shhredded cabbage, lime wedges, radish, and tortilla strips for garnish are a must with this traditional soup. Very very good!!

Great recipe. I use it as a guide. Instead of chili powder, I make my own red chili and I don't cook anything in oil. no garlic or onion and I add a bay leaf. I just let everything cook in the pot for 3 hours or until the hominy is tender. 

 My family eats this like menudo, so chopped onions, lime and more oregon are a must.

This is a great recipe, simple and delicious.  I always use a pork roast or loin, cubed and browned for a richer flavor.  I also toss in a couple whole dried chilies for some heat.  Must be served with shredded cabbage, radish, a squeeze of lime and tostadas on the side.

Very nice soup!  Perfect for a frigid evening like ours is tonight.  I followed the recipe pretty close, just added a little more garlic and 1/2 tsp. of cumin, and I only had 2 cans of hominy on the shelves, and it was really good!  We garnished with finely chopped onions, thinly sliced radishes, avocado cubes, crumbled tostadas and squeezed some fresh lime juice on it.    My daughter speaks the language, she hasn't been really fond of Mexican food, but after this she said she's changing her mind!  (and said this has to go into the winter soup rotation).  A bowl is going to the teacher tomorrow, too.  Thanks for the tasty and easy recipe!

Posole is very traditional in NM, where I live, and is always made around the holidays to accompany tamales.  I cook a pork roast and cut into bite size pieces and add fresh red chili (which I make myself from red chili pods).  Also, I use the broth from the fresh posole (homony) in lieu of chicken broth.  Before serving, I sprinkle each individual bowl with cheese and serve with warm flour tortillas.

Good recipe. Very flavorful but the chicken in mine was a little chewy. I cooked it as the recipe described and it also took me a little longer for the hominy to cook than 15 minutes. It was closer to 40 minutes. I will make it again. I like it better with chicken than other traditional meats used for posole.

Delicious! Even my boyfriend who was very adamant that he did not like posole gobbled down a large bowl. I made a few changes to the recipe according to my own tastes, and prepared it in a slow cooker instead of the stove top. I added the shredded chicken, onion, garlic, one 4 oz can of diced green chilies, two 29 oz cans of hominy, 2 quarts of low sodium chicken broth, and one 28 oz can of mild red enchilada sauce to the slow cooker, omitting the water entirely. I reduced the amount of chili powder to 2 teaspoons, and also added 3 small bay leaves, the salt, and oregano and gave everything a good stir before turing the slow cooker on low and cooking for 7 hours. I garnished with diced onion, chopped cilantro and lime (not a fan of cabbage or radish). This recipe was very easy to prepare, and full of flavor, will definitely make again. I highly recommend preparing in a slow cooker, just toss everything in before work, and come home to a delicious, stress-free dinner!

This was easy and delicious.    I hand-shredded a whole rotisserie chicken, and skipped the chicken cooking part.  This developed rich delicious flavor in under an hour.   I put more chili powder and added it to the onions as they cooked in EVOO.   I like spice, so I added some crushed red pepper flakes.

I make this all the time, its very simple and cheap. The only thing ive changed is how i do the chicken. Now i cut the chicken breasts in half and cook it in the pazole instead of pre cooking and shredding it. This method taste better to me and its also a time saver which i deffinatly need!

Thank you for this recipe, this was my first time making it and it came out great! I was soo worried for nothing, this was just too easy to make, I only just boiled and shredded chicken thigh meat instead of breast meat.

I give this 4 stars because improvement can be made to make it taste better and more authentic.  But it is a simple and good starter recipe.  I also messed up on the chicken by boiling it the night before to save time.  It made it rubbery the next day.  I will make again, but perhaps use rotisserie chicken.

Loved this recipe. Tasted authentic and was very easy to make. I'll be making this again soon! Served it with lime, chopped cabbage, cilantro, scallions, and crumbled tortilla chips. Sabroso!

I thought this was great. I made a smaller version for me and my husband with homemade broth (skipping the boiled chicken breasts), cooked and shredded a leg and thigh, and followed the rest of the recipe. Good stuff!

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner. I've always eaten my dad's posole but hadn't made it myself. The only change was that I used beef for stew instead of chicken. Pork loin would also be a good meat option. Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe.  I have made it several times.  I don't make it the same twice in a row.  I was glad to get this recipe as a starter and then I spiced it up to my tastes.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

Thank you for a simple posole recipe to start with. The outcome was delicious and comforting on a winter afternoon. I garnished with a dollop of sour cream and fresh cilantro. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this. I made it almost exactly as written but I used 3 cans of hominy and left over turkey and turkey stock I had frozen from Thanksgiving and  added a teaspoon of cumin. I topped bowls of soup with fresh chooped cilantro and tortilla chips. I may add some roasted green chilis next time i make this.

This recipe was amazing... I love Pozole but I always had to wait for my mom to make it for me. And I tried once to make it, lets just say it was not very good. But I made this recipe last night, & there were no left overs!!! I'm keeping this recipe in my recipe box.. Thanks

This tasted amazing! I will definitely be making this again. I wanted it to be a very thick soup, so here's how I made it. Cut recipe to 5 servings. Used 1 large chicken breast and tossed diced onions into the pan while the chicken was finishing up. Added salt, pepper, garlic and kept the rest of the amounts the same. I diced the chicken, used 2 cans chicken broth, 1 can of drained and rinsed hominy, and 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice. Add 1 small can diced chiles, extra chili powder to taste, a few dashes cayenne, and a large pinch of cumin. Added only 1/2 cup of water total (at end), to thin the soup just a bit. Very yummy! Oh yes, I only simmered the soup for 20 minutes once it was put together. Couldn't wait and didn't need to!

I made this for a church dinner - for 50 people and it was easy and fantastic. I baked the chicken breasts in the oven to save myself some work. And didn't add any water.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, but ended up simmering it  closer to 3 hrs. We loved it!! I'll definitely make it again, and don't think I'd change a thing.  The toppings are a must.  We used shredded lettuce, chopped onion, chopped parsley (didn't have cilantro) and lime wedges.

Couldn't find my original Posole recipe so tried this one.  It was not only so easy, but very tasty!  My skeptical hubby even loved it!  I only used 1/2 of the salt called for because I used chicken bouillon for part of the broth called for (ran out of chicken broth and had to substitute) and because of that, could have totally eliminated the salt.

I know this is a quick posole, but man, was it bland! I am a posole lover (usually I prefer green vs red), and this did not come close to tasting like a shadow of the real thing. I even upped the spices, added an extra clove of garlic, and poached the chicken breasts in the soup before taking them out and chopping/shredding them. I had one bowl leftover for the next day, and I was hoping it would deepen in flavor overnight, but it was still super bland. The lime helped. I also topped it with shredded cabbage and cilantro. I could maybe see this working with a can of red enchilada sauce or adding tomatillos to the soup base, but this is only decently edible, not enjoyable, as is.

Instantpot recipe!  This is one of my all time favorite recipes from AllRecipes. But I wanted to try it in the InstantPot. So, same ingredients, although adjust liquid volume to size of pot. Mine was almost to the max line so I cut it back a bit. Throw in all ingredients and raw chicken, whole. SOUP setting for 30 minutes and 30 minutes NR. Came out PERFECT. I then took the chicken out and shredded it and threw it back in. Enjoy!

Delicious. I made one change. I halved the amount of Chili poweder and replaced it with chipotle  sauce to give it more heat and a smoky flavor.

Loved this!, the only thing I didn't have was the garlic cloves so I used garlic powder which worked the same, and I had already boiled the chicken to make something else and my daughter found this, so I improvised with what I had and it was a hit. I'll be making more tonite.

In the photo it looks like they do not have the grated lettuce, but in fact, a finely shredded cabbage.? I like either in mine so makes no difference. I love Hominy but my husband prefers the 2 c. of frozen corn in place of the hominy. You could also use a can of drained corn if no frozen on hand. Great recipe!

Easy and delicious recipe. I added a can of green salsa/ enchilada sauce to add a kick. Also garnish with fresh radishes, crisp lettuce, lime and onions for a balanced crunch. We ate this over rice or

Wanted a smaller heartier batch so only used 8 cups of chicken stock, no water, half the spices, i did add 1/2 tsp chipotle chili powder and 1/2 tsp ground black pepper. Loved it.

Easy and tasty. My mother-in-law usually makes us Pozole with pork. I decided to give this recipe a try and it was a hit with the entire family! Even my hubby who has been spoiled with some great Mexican cooking by his mom loved it!

I made this tonight for supper, it was sooo good!  I purchased an already roasted chicken.  i pulled out all of the meat and used that in the soup, it cut my cooking time.  I cut up some fresh red onion, radishes, avocado, fresh limes and had sour cream for toppings. It was delicious!  I highly recommend this recipe.  so easy peasy!

The recipe was super easy. My husband is very picky and he ate a two bowls, He loved it. I did change it up a bit, I used Menudo spice mix instead of chili powder and added 2 tbs of knorr caldo de pollo.

This is my goto recipe for posole.  I love the contrast of flavors with the nuttiness of the hominy and the spice of the chili powder... Yummy!  I add roasted green chilies and roasted diced tomatoes to the mix,  and top with fresh cilantro and either queso fresco,  or shredded cheddar!

Loved this recipe!  I added 1/4 C lime juice, small can of mild red enchilada sauce, and about 1 teaspoon of cumin. This is a great recipe on it's own but it also allows you to easily add to your own taste.

great, easy to follow recipe. I doctored mine for a bit more flavor and texture.

I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken stock with a diced onion until cooked through. then I took it out and let it cool for about 30min before shredding.

while the chicken was cooling I like the flavors of my broth marinate and come to a slow boil. I added some cumin, chili pepper and chicken bullion to make a solid, flavorful broth, after simmering for 30min while my chicken cooled, I added the shredded chicken and hominy to the soup. I also added small cuts of corn on the cob to the soup. I thought it would be tasty and I had some since it's in season. the corn was a delicious add, it soaked up the seasonings and was a great textrlure with the soft hominy and chicken.

served it with the chopped cabbage (I found shredded cabbage at my store which made life so easy), cilantro and tortilla strips.

very healthy soup and my husband absolutely loved it. thanks for the recipe!

Delicious . I added some additional seasonings to add more of a meaty flavor considering I wasn't adding pork like the traditional dish calls for & I used less chicken because honestly the broth is my favorite part.

Great easy basic recipe.  I used pork. I used some Penzeys Arizona Dreaming, the 9000 Chili blend and Cumin.  I'm in the habit of making my own chicken stock so I used all chicken stock, no water.  This is Mexican Pho!  All the fresh toppings make it so healthful and a one dish meal good  for a crowd.  Toppings I used were radishes, chopped cilantro, lettuce, cucumber slices, avocado and lime wedges.  I'd like cabbage as well but didn't have any.

This was my first try at chicken pozole, trying to make it as good as my mom does. I added more oregano and chili powder than the recipe called for. I also added a bit of chicken boullion. It is a great recipe that I will use again, probably next time will use bone-in chicken for a richer flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this pazole and I used chicken once and duck another time, I but it really didn't have much seasoning a little bit of scorpion peppers and it took off almost literally, but very good overall, by the way I made it with haddock also now that was good, but different, thank you, and Shalom.

This recipe is outstanding!  I cut the chili powder to 3 tbsp.  I used 1/2 white hominy and 1/2 yellow hominy.  Personally, I like the yellow hominy better- it has a more "corn tortilla-like" flavor.  Be sure to add a can of enchilada sauce- it really makes a big difference!. On the side I had bowls of cilantro, sour cream and shredded cheddar.  I little bit of cheese, a dollop of sour cream and heaping spoonfuls of cilantro- wow I could eat this every day!  I have made it on several occasions for company and everyone asks for the recipe.  This is a new favorite!

Awesome starter recipe! I used more water and bouillion cubes instead of broth (since I was out) and boiled the chicken till it was able to be shredded. I also used one big can of good enchilada sauce to give it the red color (and taste). I also didn't have chili powder so I substituted that with some Tapito. Tasted AAAAA-MAZING!! Thank you!

This was pretty yummy! I added one squeezed lime into the pot in addition to the sliced lime in my bowl. I also like cheese a lot so I sprinkled some on top along with onions, cilantro, and my lime juice.

This is great, easy recipe. I make it a meal and go with 2-3 pounds of shredded chicken breast. I would also double up on the hominy. It's the best part. Instead of chopping onion, I used a bag of frozen Pictsweet Seasoning Blend (Onions, Celery, Green & Red Peppers, Parsley Flakes). I also added garlic salt, lots of chili powder and some cumin, since we like it with a kick. I garnish it with shredded cabbage, cilantro, lime juice, sliced radish, tomatoes, avocado, jalapeno peppers, cheese, more oregano, whatever you like. I just recently made it with Swanson Mexican Tortilla Flavor Infused Broth. Just the right amount of flavor, not too much. It turned out great! My husband loves it! It makes a huge batch, but it will be gone quick.

I've been wanting to make pasole for so long but couldn't find a good recipe- I tried this recipe though and the ratings don't do it justice-- it came out amazing! Only thing I did different is I seared the onions and garlic FIRST then added the rest of the ingredients (all just in one large pot) then simply added 2 cut up limes for added flavor and thawed chicken drumsticks- I let it all just cook together. When I served it in the bowls for my family,  we added another slice of lime and the cabbage.  And instead of tostada shells,  we used a bag of tortilla chips.  :)

I liked it. Easy to make. And if you add the sides, (tostadas, chopped green onions, red radish, shredded lettuce) even better.

My whole family loved this recipe!  I used 3 tablespoons of garlic powder instead of 3 cloves of garlic.  I gave everyone the option of chili powder or using Valentina Hot Sauce for spiceness since I didn't add these ingredients while cooking.  I also placed tortilla chips along the inside of posole bowl and topped it off with slices of avocado.  I also made this posole with shrimp and it was DELICIOUS!!

This was the best! It is really hard to find things that my 5 year old likes and he loved being able to squeeze lime wedge over the posole covered tostada.

Tasty and easy to follow recipe. I served it with soft cooked corn tortillas instead of the tostada shells but I'm certain it would be great either way. There were 8 of us at the table, 6 years old to 39 years old and it was well received by all!

I boiled my 2 chicken breasts in chicken broth with a quarter onion and a clove of garlic.

After it was done, I scooped out the onion and garlic.  Shredded the chicken and put it back into the same broth.

I cooked the chopped onion along with the 3 cloves of garlic in the oil until it was translucent.

I then scooped it out of the skillet and put in the pot with the shredded chicken.  I added the hominy at this point too.

I added about 3 tablespoons of cayenne pepper and about 1 tablespoon of Chipotle pepper.  I also added about 3 teaspoons of oregano. (TIP: Pour the oregano in one palm and with the other, rub it  together to break it down even further and to make the flavor pop.) I didn't add any more salt because I felt it had enough flavor.

I simmered it on the stove for about half an hour until the hominy was nice and soft.

I love this easy recipe, even though I changed it a bit.  I added more spices because my family loves their food super spicy.  :)

Made just as recipe stated. The flavor is very good. For those who say it's too spicy or not enough, remember that not all chili powder packs the same heat nor has the same flavor profile. I didn't give this recipe 5 stars because my chicken turned out a bit chewy. However, my daughters had no complaints! Oh, and don't forgo the garnishes. They really do add something good!

Delicious!  I use a full 6lb 9 oz can of hominy, but otherwise follow the recipe. I garnish with a dollop of sour cream, chopped fresh cabbage and tomatoes and a squeeze of lemon juice.  We have made this several times now, it's a new staple in our house.

Excellent! My husband loved this, tomatoes and all :) (And he hates tomatoes, so that's saying something). Will definitely be making this again. Cut the recipe down, but will have to make it bigger because we fought over the leftovers the next day because I hadn't made enough. Absolutely loved it!

This was really quick and easy to do, especially since I used left over roasted chicken breast. When I read through this recipe it seemed to have too much liquid, so I kept everything the same but reduced the liquid to a big 49 oz. can of chicken broth and no water. It was still too bland for me so I added a can of diced green chili and chipotle pepper tobasco. Better after that, but there are better recipes for posole so I doubt I would make this one again.  I used left-over roasted chicken breast.
