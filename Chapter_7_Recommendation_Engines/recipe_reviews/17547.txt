Turned out kinda mushy . . . not much to it.  I added some ground beef once and it was okay but still not the greatest.

My boyfriend and I made this during Lent, and it was spectacular.  We then doubled the recipe and made it for his family...another big hit!  Easy and tastes awesome. Even if you aren't a chef, you'll wow everyone who loves Mexican-styled meals.  Great with refried beans and spanish rice.

I made this dish for a bank pig out and everyone asked for the recipe. It's even good cold...

Very Good! went over well. My only thought was to next time use a less chunky salsa and maybe trying refried beans.

It was bit too chunky and oniony for the kids.  The older set really loved it.

I have made this twice for my family and we all just loved it. It is so good and is very easy to make.  I just wanted to let you know how much my family liked it.

Really tasty recipe. I used about 4 more ounces of cheese and some dashes of tobasco and it was great.

I added more salsa and used low fat cheese, and it still turned out really good.

I didn't really like this, but it may have been the wrong kind of enchilada sauce.
