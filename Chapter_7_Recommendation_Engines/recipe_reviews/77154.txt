Be prepared to feed an army!  This recipe feeds A LOT!  I am rating this a 3 star due to the excessive salt the first time I made it.  2nd time I made it, I soaked the beans overnight and then proceeded to follow the recipe using pork roast loin to help cut down on the fat.  Added an extra tablespoon of garlic powder, 1/2 tablespoon of ancho chili powder and 1/4 cup of dried minced onion and let it cook adding 1 tablespoon of garlic salt in place of the regular salt at the end.  Thought it was going to have to much liquid, but after shredding the meat and adding back to  the crockpot, it was just perfect!  TWO SIDE NOTES:  1.)  Adding a potato while cooking will take the gassiness out of beans!  2.)  Adding salt BEFORE the beans finish cooking guarantee they will remain hard - wait until the end to add your salt!

This recipe has been in our family for years and is SO good.  We, however, 'build' our Pork Chalupa UP a little differently.  We use a 'bed' of Fritos Corn Chips (Scoops)(or I've bunked tradition and held the Fritos on the side and then built the following on my plate: pile on the pork chalupa, grated cheese, sour cream, diced avocado, green onions, diced tomatoes, (and, for me HEINZ ketchup)salsa if you like.  The flavors all marry so wonderfully.  It is a super friendly quick reheat for leftovers too! (OR we've freezed the leftovers and reheat in a boil in a bag method for a whole other dinner!  The DAY of cooking brings a yummy aroma to your home to boot.  Hope you find this as enjoyable as we have.  Good recipe, good eats.

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!!  Simply DEEEE-LISH!!!  I followed the recipe as posted (cept I had to adjust the cooking time as I had a larger pork shoulder) and it came out it came out perfect.  The beans were not mushy  and the pork was tender & juicy and absolutely yummy and flavorful!  Will make this again and again...

this has got to be the best crock pot recipe I've tried.  I had only 1/2 the amount of pork, and only 1 7oz can of green chiles.  I used the whole pound of dry beans and personally I think that a little less meat (or more beans) would've been better, but I like more beans than meat in my dishes.  I used half the amount of salt and it was perfect.  The dish does come out soupy but I kept all the liquid in it and used a slotted spoon to scoop everything out, extremely tasty.  I did not soak my beans, so I checked it after it was cooking for 6 hours and the beans needed a little more help cooking so I put the crock on high for the last two hours, it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I have been making this exact recipe for years. I originally received it from a friend from Mexico so rest assured this is as authentic as it get. I also serve mine with tortilla chips and sour cream but have used fried corn tortillas.  Thanks for posting!!!

The best!  i was doing the burrito thing until I just figured I'd try other people's taco salad suggestion.  It was very salty, so I would cut the salt by half, especially if you're eating it on crushed tortilla chips.  Covered in lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, shredded cheddar and sour cream, it's awesome.  Also great in burritos, might throw some crushed tortilla chips in there also for some crunch.  The beans came out slightly underdone, so I might leave it 9 hours next time and make sure to stir better.

Wonderful recipe that has been in my family for years!  We do not use the green chili peppers.  Instead we use a little bit of cinnamon (Were from the Cincinanti area:), hot sauce & a little more ground cumin than what they call for in here.  Instead of flour tortillas try using cheese Doritos .. just make sure you crunch them up real good.. put a layer on your plate first..then add the meat/bean mixture and all your favorite toppings!  WONDERFUL!!!

I used fresh garlic and diced up a sweet onion, some homemade vegetable broth to cover the meat and beans. Cooked low for 9 hours and then shredded my pork and placed back in the crock and kept on warm for about another hour. Lots of liquid but used a strainer. Was very good but the second day...REALLY good. It made so much I have two containers that should feed four people in my freezer. Update: We used some of the leftovers to stuff some bell peppers, just added a can of black beans and tomatoes and green chilies. What a great way to use some leftovers. Update #2: Still had leftovers and used them to make enchiladas, just added in some cheese, canned rotel, jalapenos and rolled up in flour tortillas, topped with enchilada sauce and more cheese and baked for 25 minutes...fantastic!

Excellent!  We haven’t been able to find authentic Mexican food since we moved out east.  We piled our chalupas with lettuce, salsa, sour cream, cheese, and extra green peppers.  We also added fresh hot peppers while it was cooking.  It tasted just like the food we used to get at the little Mexican take-out place back home.

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it turned out better than Fabulous, better than Delicious - FABULICIOUS! I made such a mess of the first printed out copy of the recipe, I needed to print another copy. When I went to locate it in my Allrecipes saved recipes, I couldn't find where I had saved it! I went bonkers and surely thought I had lost it forever and had to do some real searching. I couldn't even think of the name of the dish! This last time I used a boneless Pork Loin. OMG! I can't describe how good this is! I break it down into several servings and freeze them for later. We use Burrito size flour tortillas, along with some Mexican Queso Fresco, wrap it up, and warm in the oven for a few moments. Top with lettuce, home-made salsa, Mexican Crema, and finish with extra Queso Fresco. YUMMY! I think I'll go home and eat some tonight!

This has been in our family for years - glad it's been posted.  I use this for a crowd and have the following on the side:  diced tomatoes, sour cream, diced onion, guacamole, chopped olives, and lots of salsa.  Then I have them serve it over fritos and add all the "stuff" on top.  ALWAYS a hit.

I don't understand why so many of you are giving this recipe such high marks when there are clearly two major flaws: 1) the salt issue, you all say it is way too salty (and I agree), and 2) beans should not be cooked in salt, or they won't soften--it should be added at the end. Please stop rating based on your changes to the recipe and just rate the original recipe.  With this many negative remarks, does it really deserve a 4.5 star rating?  I think not.

I soaked the beans for about 2 hours before I loaded up my crock pot, but otherwise I followed this recipe exactly. I had a slight issue with extra liquid, but I just chalk that up to there being no measurement involved when you say "add enough water so that the roast is mostly covered." All I did was drain some of it off before shredding the pork and adding the 3rd can of chilis. The flavor was delicious albeit mild. We have tons of leftovers in the freezer!

This recipe is awesome!  The only thing I did differently was use vegetable broth instead of water.  I only had one can of chiles also, but it was enough for us.  I served it on the tortillas as suggested with a side of green beans and spanish rice. YUMMY!  It did make a ton and I froze the leftovers.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I couldn't find pork shoulder roast, so I used ribs and it worked wonderfully, just had to pick out the bones. I soaked my beans overnight and didn't bother with mixing the beans, peppers and spices (btw, I only added ONE TEASPOON of salt and that was plenty) in a separate bowl...it's a total waste of a bowl! I mixed it in the slow cooker, added the ribs, and covered with a mix of water and chicken broth. The mixture was tender and tasty, with just the right amount of kick. I served them with lettuce, tomato, radishes, cheddar cheese and flour tortillas, passing salsa on the side. It made enough for an army...plenty to freeze for several more meals. Very nice recipe!

for people on Low sodium diets, you can alter this a tad and still enjoy it and still only consume 400-500 gr sodium per serving. Do not add salt and use corn tortillas, they are sodium free. Rinse your chiles before adding them to remove some of the salt.

5 stars for taste but giving 4 stars because I had to cook it in the crockpot for 30 hours before the beans softened up. I soaked them the night before, cooked them on high all day, but they were still hard at dinnertime, so I just kept cooking them. Turned it to Low overnight, then back to High on day 2. By afternoon, the beans had softened and it was delicious for dinner. I will make this again but wanted to make other people with the hard bean problem know to just keep cooking them another day!

I used a pork loin roast to make this leaner and it was fantastic.  The only thing I will change next time is to cook it a little bit longer as the beans were not quite done.  Although I have to admit that half of my family liked the little bit of crunch...

My family loved this and they are very picky eaters.  Was so delicious.  It is definitely a keeper!  I followed the recipe as given except I used pork tenderloin instead of a shoulder roast.

We LOVED this.  I followed the directions to a t except I only had 1 can of green chilies and wasn't going to go to the store for the other 2.  Can only imagine it makes this a little tastier:)  I'm not sure what size shoulder I got, but it was on special.  I wasn't sure how the beans would cook and I was a little leery that they would even soften up and be edible.  I did have to replenish the water after 4.5 hours and it seemed the beans all of a sudden soaked up all the liquid.  Glad I was around to refill.  That fact may make it difficult to do this dish in the crock pot and be away from home all day.  I cooked mine on low for 10 hours.  The meat was delicious and oh so tender, but  the beans, to die for.  I think the fat and flavoring must really get into the beans as they slow cook.  I could eat a whole pot of just the beans.  This makes a TON of food.  I'm going to freeze some of it before my DH turns into a Chalupa!  He has eaten this every meal since I have made it because he likes it.  One more thing, if you refrigerate this you can easily skim the fat off the top.  Shoulder is a fatty cut and what makes this taste so darn good.  Thanks Fanifergus I will be making this again.

Pretty good.  I halved the salt and it was still too much.  If I make it again I'll omit the salt completely.  I liked the bean to meat ratio, perfect for us.  Served for a large dinner get together and it went over well, especially the older kids.

This was so good!  I subbed one can of diced jalapenos for one of the cans of chiles and it was perfect.  I also used black beans instead of pinto due to personal preference.  I cooked on low for 9 hours and it was absolutely perfect!

Easy and delicious. I followed the exact recipe except that I cut it in half. It still made tons of food.

I have to be honest, I was very disappointed with the end result. It smelled really good cooking in the slow cooker all day, and with 4.5 stars I was expecting it to taste good. It was WAY too salty for one thing. Too runny to put in a flour tortilla. My kids wouldn't eat it. This is the first recipe on here that I've not liked. Will not be making this again. Big waste of money and time.

I scaled to 8 servings and subsituted pork for 3 lb chicken tenderloins. Used 2 cans undrained beans instead of dried. Omit salt! (no water in crock-pot) Chicken shreds easily by simply smashing in crock-pot. Served with corn tortillas.

Used white corn tortillas fried for a few seconds in just a bit of veggie oil, and it's even better than using flour tortillas. This was sooooo good!

I have made this many times and we all love it, but for salt watchers, this is very salty so i use only a dash of salt and add a large jar of salsa into the water that covers the dish while cooking. we love the added flavor without the added salt.

I doubled the beans in this recipe and I could've tripled them. I can't buy canned green chilies here and didn't have any frozen on hand, so I used canned red chilies. Delicious and so easy! My guests all took seconds.

A really good and simple recipe.  The only thing's I did different was omit the salt and cooked the roast in the oven, cut it up in chunks, and added to the beans the last three hours.  Made burritos with fresh flour tortillas, topped with red chile, shredded colby cheese, lettuce, diced tomato, fresh guacamole and sour cream.  Served with Spanish rice on the side.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was good.  I made it with the homemade refried beans in the crockpot.  I however will change one thing next time.  After I shredded it I followed another reviewers recommendation about throwing it back into the over to crisp it up and I would NOT do that again.  I think it destroyed the meat.  We started to choke on the meat because it was so dry.  Thank goodness I didn't crispup all the meat because I threw out what I did put back in the oven.

This made for a delicious Sunday dinner at my house! The only changes I made were to use canned beans and decrease the water because the beans weren't going to absorb as much. We all ate until we nearly had to roll ourselves away from the table. Glad there were leftovers for my lunch today!

totally awesome flavor.  I did not have any dried beans so here is what I did.  Cooked pork in green chilies (2 cans) and salsa (1 cup) with just enough water to come to the edge of the roast.  Set you roast on a layer of sliced onion.  Start on high for 30 minutes, drop to low for 5 hours.  Removed roast and shredded, added 2 cans pinto beans to mixture and added shredded meat into same, reheated for about 1 hour on low.  This is awesome served on rice with cheese and sour cream.  Also a pork shoulder is really large, so I used a pork tenderloin, still turned out awesome.

A very good and versatile recipe! I didn't have pinto beans on hand so I used dried black beans instead and it turned out great. In the past I have had trouble cooking beans until I learned there is a secret to it - don't add the salt until the beans are completely done or they will stay rock hard! I therefore cooked the beans and then my hubby added the salt. Here is why this recipe didn't get 5 stars....it was waaaaaaay too salty! When I cook a pound of beans, I add at the most, 1 T salt. My husband added the salt and he dumped 2 T in as stated in the recipe and it pretty much ruined the dish. I love the flavor so next time, I will add 1 T salt at the end of the cooking, stir, let it bubble for 15 minutes or so then taste and IF more is needed, add it teaspoonful by teaspoonful, carefully tasting after each addition.

This was absolutely fabulous!  The only thing I did differently was cut the salt in half (only because I don't normally cook with a lot of salt, if at all).  This was a huge hit with the whole family!

My family really enjoyed this recipe, it made lots and was very filling. I used a can of jalapeños because I couldnt find the green chilies, I expected it to be spicy but is like all the spice cooked away. Anyways instead of using just water I put one onion, 1/2 a green pepper and a bit of cilatro in my blender, added some water and added it to the crock pot. It cooked on hign for 6 hrs. I removed the pork from the pot and shredded it. drained most liquid from the beans and reserved. I mashed the beans with a potato masher and returned the meat to the pot, adding back enough liquid to moisten. It was great with warm tortillas and various toppings.

These were pretty good... but H-O-T!!! My fiance is leaving for a week-long business trip, so we were packing & washing clothes ALL weekend. I needed a recipe that was very "hands-off," so to speak. To boot, our wedding is less than 3 week's away, so every weekend for the past month has been "on the go," running errands, etc. This slow-cooker meal couldn't have been a better match for my needs. And ingredients for it were VERY cheap (I purchased a nearly 4 lb. pork shoulder roast for $5 - the beans & chilies were also CHEAP). I mistakenly purchased 2 cans of hot & 1 can of mild green chilies instead of all mild ones. I proceeded as directed, but when I shredded my meat, it was super HOT!!!!! Since the can I reserved for adding in the last step was one of the "hot" ones, I omitted it altogether. Other than that and subbing chicken stock for H2O (I needed to use it up), I followed FANIFERGUS'S directions exactly. My only complaint is that my beans were a bit crunchy for my liking. I was very surprised they were, given that they cooked for 9 hrs. Other reviews on here advised  soaking overnight, but who wants to do that (this is SUPPOSED to be easy...)???? Served over Frito's Scoops w/ all the fixins' (i.e. lettuce, cheddar, pico & guac) & Mike's Hard Margaritas, this was a very filling meal. On the upside, this makes a TON & leftovers can be served multiple ways to change things up a bit - nachos come to mind.... Thanks for sharing FANIFERGUS! :-)

This is a great recipe!  I have a larger crock pot so we doubled the recipe and froze the extra for quick dinners later.  It freezes beautifully.  My boys LOVE this filling and use it for quesadillas, burritos, tacos, etc.  We still have some in the freezer, but will definitely continue to use this easy and delicious recipe!

I am looking for more easy crock pot recipes this fall and this filled the bill. I served this to company and kids and everyone loved it!  I did double the spices as some reviewers said it was a little bland-with good results; I also chopped onion and added that with the pork.  I used dried beans, but my method was to cover the beans in water, bring the water to a boil, then cover the pan, turn the stove off, and let the beans soak in that for a few hours till they cooled.  Drain and rinse the beans, then throw everything (pork, spices, and beans) in the slow cooker.  The beans were perfect, not crunchy as some are experiencing. Thank you for an awesome recipe we will have regularly.

If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would!!  I acutally did not use this meat rolled in a tortilla, but I used it for a nacho topping and it was great!!  I just shredded the meat, placed it on top of nachos and used Gordos cheese dip (mild) on top of it all.  My husband said that it reminded him of the shredded chicken nachos that our local Mexican resturant makes.  SOOOO GOOD!!  Thanks for sharing.

This dish is a great slow cooker meal as it is quick to assemble and  has a lot of flavor. Having said that, I was eating a chalupa thinking it was good, but I have other recipes for pork I like better when my husband said "This is really good". So, I'm keeping it! It did make a lot, so I made half a recipe, and I froze 3 quart bags of it for future meals. I'm always looking for more ways to serve pork. I couldn't find a 4 pound pork shoulder so I used a 2 pound pork loin roast. I do know it would have been much more flavorful with a pork shoulder though.

I don't really know how to cook beans, so I just used two cans of pinto beans, undrained and they worked fine.  I also used one can less green chiles than the recipe called for.  These were a nice change from regular tacos, but for the price of a pork shoulder I would have rather done something else with it than this.

LOVED this recipe.  Cut back on the spices by 1 Tablespoon, we are wimps:)))  Flavor is fantastic.  My husband could not say enough about how good it was.  I was the pound of pinto beans the night before, placed them in the crock pot, covered with water, about 5 cups.  My husband added the pork and spices and cooked on slow 8 hours.  The meat fell apart taking it out of the crock pots.  Doesn't get much simpler than this, and you'lll love the results.

This has been my go-to recipe on a busy week when I know I will be too busy to cook dinner. It is so easy to make with ingredients that are standard in my pantry, and fun to assemble. The dish also keep well and served for leftovers. Great recipe and thank you for sharing!

This was very good. The flavors were perfect. The pork was sooo tender. All 3 kids loved this, even my picky one! I used a cast iron dutch oven on the stove top and a can of rotel instead of green chilies (its the only thing I had) and it turned out great! I will be making this for holidays it will feed a lot of people.

This recipe is great!  It does feed a crowd (I had 12 and there was still plenty left over for lunch for a few days), and has lots of flavor.  It was great served the next day over Spanish rice - like a 2nd meal from the same pot!

This turned out perfectly. I was amazed at how well the beans cooked with the pork. There was a perfect amount of liquid for the beans to absorb. Really delicious!

Very good and easy.  Very vertical recipe have been able to use meat for many other meals, but makes way more than 12 servings.

My husband loved these.  I did quick soak the beans (boil for two minutes, then cover for 1 hour) just to make sure they'd cook.  The only thing I added was tons of cilantro, lime juice, and salt.  I also mashed the beans to hide them under the meat in the tacos.  My kids and husband can be weird over beans.  :)

This turned out well. Not the best flavor I've had, but it was tasty and very reasonably priced for a *lot* of food. The flavor is sort of muddled and really earthy, but some dashes of vinegar-based hot sauce (I used Tabasco, but any would do, probably) helped add some brightness to the overall flavor. I had no problems with the beans being undercooked, but I did soak them overnight. The description was correct - this freezes very well: I cooled and froze half of the mixture in a freezer bag, and pulled it out the next month for more dinners, and the flavor and textures were just as good as the first time I made it. Thanks!

Considering the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed by this recipe. I thought it was good but not great. It was too salty and there were too many beans. If I ever make it again I will use half the salt and beans recommended. Overall, I wasn't a fan of the flavor.

Made this tonight and served it with a fry bread recipe from this site.  My 9 year old ate 3 of them and never once whined, "what's in this".  Everyone else really liked the recipe too and I loved that it was so easy.  We served tomatoes, avocados, green onion, sour cream, extra sharp cheddar & lettuce as optional add ons.  My only complaint is it was way to salty for our tastes but that's a pretty easy fix for the next time I make this.

I'm rating this is the middle because it was just ok.  It was bland and a pain to get the meat out and shred it.  I don't think I'll make it again unless I can punch it up.

I've made this for years. My recipe only uses 1 tablespoon of salt, I think 2 tablespoons would be terribly salty. I put the dried UNsoaked beans in the crockpot with one more cup of water than this recipe calls for and let them cook overnight. The next morning, I put everything else in and let it cook all day.  I also cut the roast into several pieces so that it will cook more evenly. When the meat is fall apart tender, I take it out and pull it apart with two forks. I then take out the beans and put them in the food processor and puree them.  I then thicken the wonderful broth and it makes the BEST red "gravy". I put the bean puree, some shredded pork, some cheese and a dribble of the gravy inside of a flour tortilla. Total heaven!!

I have made this over and over again because it's one of my families' favorites.  I cook fresh pinto beans in my crock pot and roast the pork in the oven.  Once the roast was done and cooled, I cut it in bite sized pieces and added to the pinto beans, along with fresh chopped green chili grown here in NM, and the other ingredients.  Serves up nicely rolled in flour tortillas with shredded cheese and  garnished with chopped tomato, shredded lettuce, sliced jalapenos, salsa, sour cream and guacamole!  It's a hit every time!

I didn't have a shoulder but used a 4 lb boston butt.  Idk what changes that would imply, but this was really good! I did add fresh garlic and used Sasson con Adobo instead of salt.  Next time, I'll probably kick the heat up a bit.  So far, we've eaten it on corn and flour tortillas, baked potatoes, and will try frying the flour tortillas a bit next time. Hoping it will freeze well, too...it made a lot!

Used a 4.5 lb pork loin roast but otherwise followed the recipe.  As another reviewer mentioned, I thought there was too much liquid at the end of the cooking time but after the roast was shredded and returned to the pot, not so much so.  I boiled the beans (in a pan on the stove) for two minutes, removed them from the burner, added the seasonings and peppers, let that sit for one hour, and then dumped everything over the meat in the crockpot.  This is truly one of those dishes that does not need to be attended and can cook all day (probably).  I was at home and couldn't keep from poking and prodding!  But I think you could put this on in the morning and let it cook all day; when you get home from work, take the meat out and let it cool while you change clothes or whatever, then shred and return to the pot.  By the time you get the table set, the meat and beans will be ready!  I did not add salt until the end (1 tsp).  Next time I would like to try a bit less cumin and a bit more chili powder, and perhaps adding something a tiny bit more spicy, as although this dish had a good flavor, not much spice at all.  I added the salt at the end based on others' recommendations that the beans won't cook to soft if the salt is added.  I've heard the same thing about tomatoes.  Also because I didn't want too much salt.

My family all raved about how great it smelled while it was cooking. My husband kept saying while he was eating it that he needed to stop eating, he was over eating, but he couldn't help himself. The only thing I'll do different next time is I'll use about a half TBSP less salt. We served it in flour tortillas with cilantro and corn salsa which highlighted the flavors beautifully!

I made this recipe because it was rated so highly, but feel it was a big waste of money.  I only used half the amount of pork which was plenty. I did use the lb of dried beans, but only two cans of chilies. I only used 1 tbsp of each of the spices and very little salt. The cumin and oregano were so strong that we couldn't eat the food. I did add some cilantro but that helped only a little. 
Will not make again and was very disappointed in the taste.Would actually give no stars if possible.

I don't know what I did wrong, but it just didn't turn out as good as I'd hoped. After almost ten hours, my beans weren't tender, my roast wouldn't shred, and it was still very watery. I had such high hopes after reading all the positive reviews. Oh well. Hopefully you'll have better luck.

This was absolutely fantastic!!! Reminded me and my husband of the carnitas at Chipotle. Sooo good, I'll be making this over and over again.  Used a pork sirloin roast instead and didn't add last can of chiles.

This was very good and tasted even better the second day after the flavors had time to meld and settle.  For my family, I will cut back on the cumin and chili powder next time.  It was a little overpowering for us and made me think of a bowl of chili each time we ate it.  Nothing wrong with chili but I was expecting a different flavor.  As others mentioned, this made a lot!  I was able to freeze some for another time when I need a quick meal.  I'm glad I tried this recipe and I will make it again with modifications to please my family.  Thank you.

This was alright. I did hold off on adding the salt (and used less) until it was almost done, to avoid the beans staying hard. I added half an onion (diced) to this. Using half beer and half water would probably add more flavour. Only used a half a small can of the chiles. It was pretty bland on it's own. Add some salsa, lightly crushed Fritos and some cheese then you've got something to feel good about.

This was unbelievably good.  Only change I made was to reduce the salt by half.  Served with a side of shredded lettuce, sour cream, homemade salsa, cheese and cilantro.  Will be making this again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Excellent, I made this just as the resipe calls for and wouldn't change a thing! 
It is just my husband and me in our household. I had it for lunch two days later, still had enough to freeze half of it and will get dinner for both of us again and a second lunch out of it too. Very tasty and easy. I am going to try it with beef and or chicken sometime too.

Made this meal for 8 adults and 8 boys and it was a huge hit.  One of the gals is actually going to get a slow cooker so she can make this and another said that it was the best Mexican food she'd had since moving here from Australia.  Huge hit, so easy to make and will make a lot again!  If you can get the raw tortillas from Costco that you cook it makes it even more special!

I made a half batch of this recipe and not only did it smell amazing all day, but it tasted great too!  The only change I would suggest is halving the salt, because even with the other condiments (avocado, onion, salsa, etc) it was too salty for my taste.  But overall, very pleased, and I will be making this again.

Really good! I made half of the recipe and had plenty to feed my family of 5 and still have leftovers for another night. It had a great flavor and I love that there was very little extra salt in this dish. Using the dry beans they came out perfect! Will defiantly make again.

Served this last night for dinner.  Guests thought it was wonderful!  Best thing is how easy it is!  Served with cheese, lettuce, homemade pico de gallo, and sour cream.  Would be great for tail-gating also.

I would give this more than 5 stars if were possible!  I followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved it, even my two picky eaters.  It wasn't really spicy, but had incredible flavor.  I was a little leary about not soaking the beans overnight, but they were tender and delicious.  We put a little oil in the skillet and fried the tortillas until crispy and served it on these.  This makes a big batch, but everyone was looking forward to leftovers.

You won't believe anything this simple to put together can taste so good! The only thing I added was 2 small cans of Spicy Hot V8 to the water because we like things extra spicy & it flavored the beans wonderfully. Great Chalupas!

It's just as well that this turned out so good because it made a TON of food. The only changes I made were to use fresh diced jalapenos instead of canned, and I also added a generous pinch of Chipotle powder and the juice of a couple of limes. My only (minor) complaints are that it was a little too salty, and also the beans were a touch undercooked despite being in the crockpot for 8 hours on High. Otherwise, this was delicious. Thanks!

Very good. I only used half a pound of beans and that was just the right ratio of meat to bean for us. I also only used 2 cans of chilis. The flavor was great. Thanks :)

I used to cook for the Wednesday night meals at church and this serves so many people very economically. I used a large roaster oven and cooked it all day before taking out the pork butt bones and shredding the meat. Serve it on a buffet and give lots of choices of toppings - including warm cheese & salsa dip to spoon over the top and finish with a dollop of sour cream. I serve mine over chips or Fritos instead of a tortilla. Also a good idea for a group meal where each guest brings one of the topping ingredients and the host prepares the meat and bean portion. Share the work and expense.

No changes made except larger roast, and substituted sea salt ( all I had ) for regular salt so it came out a little salty. 
Fantastic reviews from family as well as myself.
Will make it again.

This was great and soooooo easy. I cut it in half though as it makes a TON!  Even cutting it in half--I froze some.  I also tried this as enchiladas using recipe from another reviewer and that was great too. I would recommend sticking around to monitor the beans so you can add water, if  you use dried beans in this so they don't stick to the bottom of the crockpot.  I prefer the dried beans to can.

This was so easy and made a TON of food! I ended up cooking it on low for 10 hours and the beans were not total mush, but a good texture. I like salty food, so it was not too salty for me. I did have to scoop out a lot of extra water, but that was not a problem. I served mine in tortillas with cheese, sour cream and mango salsa.

Oh man, this was fabulous!!  Made 1/2 batch because it's only me.  Was so very easy and made the best taco salad I've ever had!!  It would also be great in a flour tortilla, on a tostada shell, as a taco filling, etc.  So very glad I tried it!!  Thanks bunches for the great recipe!!

Followed recipe as directed except I did soak beans overnight & didn't add salt until ready to serve as suggested in other reviews....beans were still hard after 12 hours of cooking but was really delish!  Served with rice,tortillas & toppings...makes a lot I served 8 people & still had some leftovers for lunch the next day...will be making this one again.

Any recipe that my picky kids like is a five star for me. It was super easy to make. The meat was tender. It made enough for two meals. I think I will freeze some and make enchiladas out of the remainder of the meat next week.  I followed the recipe exactly except I had a three pound pork shoulder. I might have covered it with too much water because I had to drain the meat off after I shredded it. Thanks for the great recipe!

I like to put this on top of Fritos chips. Been making this for years.  Reheats really well. I usually make this before we go camping and  reheat there, bring along individual serving bags of fritos, turn the bags on the side and cut off the top,  open and spread out the fritos, then scoop some chalupa, top with cheese and sour cream. Great hot meal and easy clean up.

This is awesome!  I've made it 4 times and everyone just loves it.  I will admit that I have a shortcut and swap out the dried beans for canned beans.  It reduces the cooking time, and there's no chance of the beans not being quite done.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!

This is absolutely delicious! We had plenty of leftovers and those were even more delicious! I served this with hard tostado shells which added a little crunch, with iceberg lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and sour cream on top. It was a hit all around.  Don't be concerned about the dry pinto beans. With the chicken broth that I used, and the time in the slowe cooker they soften up and make a wonderful gravy just perfectly. Instead of all water I used a 32 oz package of chicken broth and enough water to cover the roast after that. I also used fresh garlic cloves, chopped. I didn't lift the cover after five hours because it looked like there was plenty of liquid in there and I wanted to keep the heat in. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I make this over and over! Everybody likes it, and it feeds a crowd. I like to add a little fresh cilantro and lime to it when I serve it. Don't out the cilantro in the pot with it though, or it will get a soapy taste.

WOW! I can't believe how easy and delicious this meal is! We actually ate it as a soup one night because there is a lot of good broth in it too. I've had it as a chalupa twice and in my omelet this morning. YUMMMY!

Yep, this was good. Didn't use as many chiles because half my family doesn't like heat. Per someone else's suggestion, I soaked my beans overnight and glad I did or they wouldn't have been done. Note: it makes a ton.  We ate it for dinner, lunch and dinner again and still had enough to freeze for another meal. It's a keeper.

I didn't use the cans of diced green chili, but I added a tablespoon of onion powder. I took the advice of using less salt, about 1 tablespoon, and it was awesome!

My husband went nuts over this dish.  So easy to make too. I put in only 1 1/2 T of salt because of the salt comments and added it only after the pork was pulled so the beans would cook properly. Will definitely make again.

Delicious...even better the second and third day.  We added some liquid smoke and some Chipotle hot sauce.  Instead of chile's we used diced fresh poblano's.  Will definitely make this again!

Loved it.  I used Rotel instead of plain diced green chiles and mixed everything in the crock pot the night before.  There are so many different things you can do with this once it is cooked - very versatile!  I have even used venison roast or pork steaks in place of the pork shoulder.  Makes a lot but freezes very well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This has been the "get together" dinner in my family for  20+ years.  (partially because it does feed an army, and paritally because it is DELICIOUS)  We build ours with a mixture of crushed cheese Doritos and plain tortilla chips, then top with the pork mixture and whatever toppings you desire.  I highly recommend this recipe! 10 STARS!

My hubby is a very picky eater but he thought this recipe was excellent. I only did a couple of things different due to lack of ingredients. I added 1 can of diced jalapenos and a package of chili bean seasoning. We loved it and will definitely make it again.

This was pretty good, but my beans did not cook all the way, and none of the water was soaked up.  The pork and seasonings turned out well though.  Would make again, but use canned beans and no water next time.

All I can say is YUM.  Perfect recipe as is.  If it is too liquidy for you just drain.  We used corn tortillas which tasted great but fell apart (because this recipe does come out very wet).  Do use the flour tortillas, they hold up better.

This got rave reviews from my family when I made it for Sunday dinner. I have never cooked dry beans before and was worried that they wouldn't cook all the way through, so I boiled them beforehand and let them soak for an hour before putting everything in the crock pot. I don't know if boiling made a difference or not, but they were cooked perfectly. Great flavors. It does make lots!

This recipe is easy to prepare, and the spiciness is so good!  I cut way back on the salt, and it wasn't missed as the other spices made up for it.  Served with sour cream rice, also from this site.  My husband thinks this would be great in a rice bowl like at Chipotle.

My family really enjoyed this meal.  It definately makes a lot.  I added a packet of taco seasoning at the end of cooking to thicken up the broth.  Next time I will probably only put a half of a pound of beans instead of the full pound.

This is absolutely delicious - it got rave reviews from the adults AND the teenagers.  We prepared it exactly as the recipe stated, and we served it with shredded lettuce, cheese and sour cream, just like a taco.  We've already decided it would be a good dish for a potluck...

Used about half the amount of salt.  Soaked the beans overnight and they turned out great.  Served layered with Fritos at the bottom then meat mixture then toppings.

Sorry, but I have to echo everyone else - my God, this makes a lot.  My family of 5 ate this and we still have about a frillion lbs left.  Very good though, seriously.  I added 2 serrano peppers at the beginning and added about 1/2 cup of green salsa after shredding the pork.  I had no problem with the beans cooking, but I completely covered the meat with water.  I could've used less as I poured off a lot when it was done.

really good.  I had to short cut the beans.  totally forgot to buy them and had hubby pick up canned beans.  let them sit in the pot for the last hour and it was good.  I'll be more careful next time!

I did like this recipe - but, it tasted very earthy and not very bright.  I tried to brighten it up with canned tomatoes.  I also think it needed more beans than the recipe calls for.

This recipe has been in our family for many years also although I have never added green chilies, but will next time. It is one of the most requested dishes that I would get from our children when they were still at home.  I should fix it for my husband and I as we enjoy it so much and it has been a while.  I brown the tortillas, add the mixure and then top it with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream and salsa.  So good.

I make this same meal, and it is wonderful.  My kids beg for it.  You can also make in a pot over the stove using 7 cups of water and simmer for 5 hours.  You would need to soak beans overnight or do the quick soak method that's on the bean bag.  So if you've seen this but just haven't tried it yet, then you better get to it, because you are missing out !!!

Family liked it, but way too much salt for us. I hesitated to put the 2 T but thought maybe I was just being conservative. Next time I would reduce by half at least. We also used less peppers and used dried black beans instead of pinto because that's what I had on hand. The meat and beans came out very well. This does make ALOT! 4 adults eating and enough leftovers for a casserole the next day! We will make it again.

A little salty, and the worst part was that the beans were still hard after 11 hours.  Great meat though.

With the spices added, I thought that this would have much more flavour than it did. It was perfectly tender after sitting all day but the lack of flavour blew it for me. Would double the amount of spices next time.
Update: had frozen the pulled pork. Pulled it out, defrosted it. Rolled it up in soft tortillas, poured salsa, shredded cheese on each. Popped into the oven at 350 F for 15 min or so. Served with sour cream, chopped up tomatos, more salsa - it was better than the first time!!!!

absolutely delcious recipe! I had to ask the butcher for a 4 lb roast, but it was well worth it (I can't imagine ever needing a 9 lb roast!). I didn't need to add any water to the beans (I did soak them overnight), so it really just needed time to cook. the meat was perfectly cooked after 8 hrs and shredded really easily. I served over fritos, as I learned from my mom, and added diced tomato, chopped onion, cheddar cheese, and salsa. next time (and there WILL be a next time!), I'll either ask for a smaller roast or add more beans (just to up the ratio). I'll also probably use less salt, since I serve it with chips. and, finally, I'll invite a crowd! we have a LOT of leftovers! (but I'm so excited to eat them!)

Words alone can honestly not express how fantastic this recipe is. Probably the best thing I've ever found on the website and I will cook it again and again. We used black beans rather than pinto and that was fantastic, too. Thanks so much for this!

This is AWESOME.  I was looking to make some more "authentic" mexican food like you might have in a restaurant.  This totally fit the bill.  We fold it up with toppings in a tortilla and then cook it in a skillet with a little oil so it's toasted.  This recipe makes a ton, too much for my husband and I, so we freeze it, and it freezes very well.

This was sooo easy!  The flavor was fantastic.  I only had canned beans on hand so I just added them to the meat and leftover juices in the last 10 min. and they worked perfectly.  I didn't change anything else.  Will definitly be making again.

Fixed these last night and was disappointed. I browned the meat first, like was suggested. I found the dish to be very bland and ordinary. I ground up some dried chipotle and jalapeno chilies and added it to the pot before I froze the leftovers. I think I will add a can of Rotel tomatoes before I serve the leftovers. I don't think I will make this again. Too many good dishes out there to repeat this one.

This was sooo yummy- i made it just like the recipe, except i just had 1- 7oz can of green chiles (instead of 3- 4oz cans)which i put in at the beginning, and didn't add any later on. The meat was sooo tender and flavorful- definitely recommend this one!!

I made this exactly as written and found it very bland once it was finished cooking.  I added 1/4 c of Mexican seasoning and 2 T of cumin and it didn't seem to help.  I took this to a 'moving' party at a friends house and everyone loved it.  If I make it again I'll probably use chipotle in adobo in place of one of the cans of chiles. Four stars because everyone loved it except me.

I had never heard of Pork Chalupas before.  I came across the recipe and thought that it sounded excellent, and definitely worth a try.  Flavor wise this was very yummy.  I had to change a couple of things though and maybe that's why it didn't quite turn out quite as good as what I had hoped.  First off, I had to soak my beans overnight, because I wasn't going to be able to fit everything in my crockpot.  So I soaked the beans to eliminate some of the extra liquid that was needed.  Also, my pork roast was on the bigger side which didn't help for the room factor.  In the end, what happened was there was still too much liquid so I kind of had soupy chalupas.  I drained some of the liquid before I assembled them but it just didn't seem quite right.  I will try this again, because the flavor is quite fantastic but I'll probably use a different method.

I read the other reviews and reduced the amount of beans by a cup which made it come out with a good meat/bean ratio. I also exchanged some of the green chilis for chipotle chilis in adobo sauce. However, with all the chili powder too, this recipe came out way too spicy so I cooled it off by adding a cup of plain yogurt and it was a hit at the pot luck. Not a bean was left and people were raving about it!

This recipe was fantastic!  We love Mexican food, but have trouble finding it anywhere since our favorite Mexican restaurant went out of business.  I will be making this often, but I think I'll cut back on the salt just a bit.

This was a go to recipe when our teenage boys were still living at home. They LOVED it. It makes a TON and there was actually enough for leftovers! 
Wonderful flavor and not too spicy (I have a sensitive palate) but zesty enough to please my husband who grew up eating fiery food!

I have made this several times now and it doesn't disappoint.  Unlike many slow cooker recipes, the flavours don't get lost in the long cooking.  I was worried about the beans/liquid situation but it comes out just fine.  I serve it in flour tortillas with fine shredded cabbage and some sour cream.

Good recipe.  As others said, it makes a ton, so it was perfect for a lunch-swap group I'm part of at work.  I paired with cilantro lime brown rice and fresh greens as a burrito-bowl style meal.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Cooking notes:
I pre-soaked the beans, and they still needed 8+ hours in the slow cooker.  My modifications: I browned the pork, seasoned in salt and pepper, in a skillet.  Other than that, I did not add any salt until the last 30 minutes.  Seasoned to taste, so I'm not sure how much I used.

  Will make again!

I made it using a 8 -- 10 lb roast, followed the recipe and it came out  wonderful! Next time I'll replace one of the cans of green chillies with the same size can of jalapenos.

I think maybe the complaints about its being too salty may have something to do with the chili power you use. I use a salt-free variety that I can mix to my taste (Penzey’s) and lower the amount of salt to 1 tablespoon.

Lots of leftovers, but a yummy recipe.  I mixed onions, cilantro, napa cabbage with lime juice, salt and pepper on top.  Was a nice light veggies mix on top of this filling  recipe. Definitely recommend!

We thought it was too bland. Didn't make any changes other than making half the quantity. I even added extra garlic powder, chili powder, & cumin at the end after I tasted it & thought it needed more flavor. I served it over salted white rice so maybe that was part of the issue. We even added Sriacha  to try & add flavor but even that didn't help much. 
I would make it again but would try to add more flavor somehow. Maybe with chicken stock instead of some of the water. And maybe with onion powder or minced garlic. I would also serve it over Fritos  or tortilla chips.
It is a very easy recipe, tho, so maybe try it with some of the tweaks others have suggested.

Because of the comments on saltiness, I tried 2 teaspoons instead of 2 tablespoon. That wasn’t enough for our tastes. Beans came out fine. Would probably cook down the liquid next time.
We tried the meat and beans sandwiched between two fried corn tortillas  and added refried beans and chihuahua cheese. Everyone enjoyed the meal.

This recipe is fantastic! I used frozen, boneless pork loin (it's what I had on hand), 1Tbsp salt (was plenty), and minced garlic.  I didn't have dried beans, but added a can of rinsed black beans for the last 20 minutes of cooking. Cooked in my crock pot (from frozen) in 7 hours, and shredded like a dream! My family couldn't get enough...we will definitely be putting this into our dinner rotation! Even my super-picky "tween" loved it. Makes fantastic leftovers, too. Overall, excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing!

It's to die for! Do not add salt while you are cooking the beans. The salt will not allow the beans to soften and will keep keep the beans hard. Actually, you can cut the salt in half and add it when the meat and beans are almost done. Instead of garlic powder, use 6 garlic cloves, finely chopped. Cut the oregano in half. Serve with chopped cilantro. Great recipe!

No changes were necessary.   The seasonings provide plenty of flavor for the pork and the beans. 
We ate it on tortillas as well as in a bowl served with a salad.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I questioned the 2 tablespoons of each of the spices and so wasn't entirely surprised when it turned out WAY too spicy....actually almost inedible... although we like our food much spicier than most.  I fixed it by adding 3 more cups of beans, (2 would have sufficed), more salt and garlic.   I was impressed by all of the rave reviews and can't figure out what I might have done wrong.  I think it must have been my fault because no one else complained about excessive spiciness.

I pre-boiled the beans using a tablespoon of chicken base.  I put all the spices into the pot with the beans, then poured everything into the slow cooker with the roast. It turned out fabulously.

I made it as posted. The pork was flavorful and tender, however, way to much liquid and I think that is what diluted the flavor of the beans. I did as others and used a slotted spoon to serve it, but will try it with a couple of changes next time, mainly less water and soaking the beans overnight (they were a little to firm for our tastes!) That said, leftovers tonight with the meat as the base for BBQ sandwiches.

I made this last night and it was a hit.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 large can of green enchilada sauce in place of the green chiles and some of the water, 2 large sliced green peppers, 1 sliced sweet pepper, 1 15 oz can of tomatoes, and 1 can of black beans, I also added extra 1lb of pork.  I will be making this again.  This is a keeper only thing different is I will add onions to the pot while it is cooking.

I made this recipe in my instant pot with a frozen pork roast. I pressure cooked it for one hour, then slow cooked it for one hour after shredding the pork. It was delicious! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is fantastic and great for a party.  I used a pork loin instead of the fattier bone-in roast, and served it with toppings of diced avocado and tomatoes, shredded lettuce, sliced black olives, sour cream, pickled jalapeños, and shredded cheese.  Everyone fixed their own serving with the toppings of their choice.  Instead of flour tortillas, I offered tortilla chips and Fritos.

Our chalupas are not like this at all so I was leery. These are terrific burritos de carnitas. My family really loved these. My dad likes more beans, my mom likes more meat. They just fill their burritos to suit their taste.  Such an easy meal to put together. Thank you

I followed the recipe but halved the ingredients. I also used an electric pressure cooker.  Used quick soak on beans and cooked at hi for 65 min.  Added 1 can veg broth and water to cover the meat. The beans and meat were perfect.  The taste was overpowering for chili powder and cumin.  Also was quite bland.  I did not have a problem with too salty at 1 Tb.  We put it on top of tortilla chips but they just got soggy.  Maybe on top would be better.  I will make this again but try different spices next time. It was very easy to make in the pressure cooker.

I love everything about this recipe EXCEPT the name!  It is NOT a Chalupa, it is a Taco.  Chalupas are served on a crispy tostada.  Tacos are served in a tortilla.

I made this for the first time with a  2 lb loin roast. I adjusted all the other ingredients in portion to the size of the roast minus the cummin. Cooked for 10 hours on low in a 4 quart Crock Pot. There was a lot of fluid when finished which I separated off for use in soup at another time. 
Served this over Basmati rice with a side of steamed broccoli.... absolutely fabulous.

Wonderful dish. I  read the reviews and decided to cut recipe in half. I still used the pound of beans  and it was great.  I served it on tortilla chips and topped it with  fresh cilantro ,green onions, radishes, tomatoes and chopped avocado. Family loved it. I will  be making this dish during the upcoming summer months.  I don't like cooking in the summer heat so this easy crock pot dish will be perfect.

Yum yum! This was great and so easy. I made half recipe, soaked my beans overnight. The pork was perfect but this left the beans a little mushy, so next time I will add the beans later (and with less water). I went light on the chili powder and salt, and used fresh jalapeños from the garden instead of the canned chilies. Very enjoyable supper, thanks for the recipe!

Oh. My. Goodness! This is DELICIOUS! We had to stop ourselves from shoveling it into our mouths straight from the pot! I followed the recipe as it is and it was amazing! I said it was restaurant quality and my MIL said it was better than that. I did rinse the beans before I cooked them and picked out the bad ones. After the 5 hour mark, I increased the heat to high because our evening plans had changed. The pork was ready a couple of hours sooner and still incredibly tender. I saw another review with a complaint of too much salt, but we thought it was seasoned perfectly. We served it on tortillas with tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, shredded cheese, avocado, and sour cream. The next day I tried it on tortilla chips and the chips made it too salty, but it was perfect on flour tortillas. My husband tried it in a bowl and topped it with sour cream and he loved it that way, too. The recipe is easy to follow and it will feed a crowd. If I could give it 10 stars, I would!

Excellent and easy.  I followed another reviewer's note after rinsing beans, brought to a boil and let sit until cool.  Then mixed in spices, etc. before adding to the pork. I put in crock pot night before and shredded meat the next morning.  However, the meat was a somewhat overcooked.  Next time I will add more garlic powder and onion as it was a bit bland.  thanks for a good, simple recipe and yes, it does make a large quantity.

It tasted good. I cut the salt in half and used jalapeños, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I don't think I'll make it again, because I never have a use for that much food, but if I do I will soak the beans overnight and add the salt at the end.

I have been making this for a couple years now. My husband and daughter always love the burritos I make with this pork. It does make a lot, so I always freeze the leftovers and later toss them in the crockpot to make chili.

I have been using this recipe for over two years now and have never posted BUT this is too good to keep a secret.  It is a great recipe and very easy to make and nothing needs to be changed.  It is our favorite Super Bowl day meal.

delicious! instead of the green chiles i used a 12 oz. jar of green salsa. cut the chile powder in half, and added a diced red bell pepper for color. soaking the beans overnight is a good idea!

This was delicious and so easy!  I did soak my beans overnight to ensure they were cooked thoroughly, and since I don't like things too hot I only used 1 TB chili powder and substituted 1 TB taco seasoning for the other one.  Watch out though--this does make a lot!  A great recipe for having guests over (or to freeze leftovers for later).

I like the recipe but add 7oz. chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and substitute two cloves of fresh garlic for the garlic powder. I skip the salt and serve over Nacho Cheese Doritos (tried tortillas first) with sour cream, avocado, ripe olives, fresh tomatoes, cheddar and lettuce.

Great flavor and very easy.  My only change is to use vegetable broth in place of the water.  Make sure ALL of the beans are covered with the broth or they will not cook evenly. Everyone I make this for loves it; it is one of our all time favorite recipes from this site!

I love this recipe. I've made it a few times now, with both pork roasts and beef roasts (boneless round). It makes a ton of food and leftovers are a great topping for nachos and even pizza.

Simple and delicious meal that my whole family enjoys eating. As written it is wonderful. The only thing I add is a chopped onion, but it is great without it, aswell. I also reduce salt. Just a personal preference. I usually double the recipe, and freeze whatever is left into freezer bags for dinner when I don't have much time. To serve from frozen, I just sit the freezer bag in warm water until thawed then pour into a pot and reheat on the stove (though I'm sure it could be done in a covered dish in the microwave, aswell). Great recipe for make ahead meals!

Yummy and easy! It was flavorful but not too spicy for picky kids! This is a keeper.... it does make a lot of food. I used less than one tablespoon salt, which worked fine. Great that you don't have to soak the beans... a time saver.

Definitely enjoyed these, but probably not enough to make again.  Mild enough that my 6 year-old enjoyed them.

Turned out very tasty! However,  the description of how much water to add was very vague and I ended up with too much at the end (used 6 cups). I used a 2 lb pork sirloin roast instead of the 4 lb shoulder roast (found a screaming deal! ) and put it in with about four hours left to cook and halved the salt . Will be making again!

Very good flavor.  I only had one can of chili's but put in a few shakes of green Tabasco too.  I used two cans of pinto beans and added them at the end, and only sprinkled the roast with salt.

This was delicious!  I think it could be hotter (spicier) but is very good just as it is.  I agree with the other reviewers 1 tablespoon of salt is plenty and do not add it until the end (after beans were done and I shredded the pork and returned it to soak together again, then I added the salt).

This was awesome and so easy! I added 2 10oz. cans of tomatoes and green chili's that I had on hand instead of just plain green chilies. That was the only substitution I made. I was scared to put the beans in with out at least a soak but I did and they were tender and yummy. Everyone loved it and I have enough leftover for lunch for my dh tomorrow and a full dinner another night. Delish!

Absolutely fantastic!! I had a larger roast, and crock pot isn't to big so I just cooked some of the bean chili mix on the stove. This is a wonderful dish and it is so simple to prepare.

this recipe is awesome!!! my boyfriend, kids, and i loved it! the meat and beans had so much flavor it was unbelievable. the recipe says to put enough water to almost cover the roast. well for me it was about 6 cups...but that was way too much. the beans never soaked up all the liquid. it was fine though...i just scooped the beans out. it does make ALOT of meat/bean mixture. i'll have to freeze the leftovers. next time i make this i'll try adding some rice in with it. deff an awesome recipe!!

This was fantastic... made it at Christmas time when lots of family around and this really does make a LOT!  We ate chalupas for days, but it was so good we did not mind!  Topped with guacamole, cheese, black olives and salsa... rave reviews from everyone! Also tried freezing some, and it was still great! Thanks!

The pork itself was very good, very flavorful and juicy. I had a difficult time with the pinto beans softening up: this was probably due to the fact that I only filled the slow cooker with enough water to cover half the pork and not so that the "roast is mostly covered". I think we will try it again - and next time I will follow the directions

This is the first recipe I have reviewed on here but thought I should since it may be the best meal I have ever made.  My entire family loved it including my 2 year old.  It was so good the first night we ate it and just as fabulous the second time around.  I followed the recipe just as written except I didn't have as much pork.  But it didn't really need so much meat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I added half a package of taco seasoning and some more garlic powder while this was cooking.  I also added some jalapenos at the begining of cooking because we like things spicy.  We served this as nachos.  Also, I cut this recipe down to 4 servings instead of 12 and two people ate off of it and there is probably enough left for 2-3 more whole meals with 2 people eating at every meal.  It makes a whole lot!

I ended up making this a little differently, by using lean pork chops (bonless) and adding salsa and using less beans... It is so yumy and healthy, just over steamed corn tortillas!!!

I'm giving this four stars because I thought it was too salty as-is. Still very good, though, and it smelled amazing as it cooked all day.   I separated the cooked pork roast to shred it and kept it in its own bowl away from the beans so I could control the saltiness by adding them in smaller doses.  I served it on homemade corn tortillas with diced tomatoes, onions, a shake of cilantro and a squeeze of lime. I'll be making these again, just with less salt.

I have made this several times and it always turns out great.  I add a little cornstarch mixed with water to the sauce at the end to thicken it a little.  I have a small family, so there is always plently left.  I divide up the leftovers and freeze for future dinners.  I used some in a mexican lasagna last night and it was delish!

I think this is a pretty good recipe, but it was WAY too salty. Will try to make again with maybe 1/2 tablespoon of salt. Meat was very tender and beans were perfectly cooked. Nice flavor, but just too much salt for our taste. Will update when I try again.

I found this to be bland but was simple enough to spice up. I used venison when I made it and it came out very good.   After reading all of the comments I did the whole fritos with all the toppings and wow that is good!

This was really good.  Even my 3-year-old loved it (I took out some meat and beans for her before adding the last can of chiles).  I did cut the salt to about 1/2 tsp., and that was plenty.

This was good and made a ton! I think it needed some more spices, it was a bit tame. We ended up chopping up a hot pepper and adding that!

Soo good! I used dried black beans beacause that's what we had, and soaked them overnight. Followed everything else exactly. We forze some of the leftovers and will definetly be making this again. Thanks!

Good but a little bland. I used dried red chile peppers I got at a Mexican store instead of the canned green chiles. Maybe I just needed to use more. I only made 1/2 or less of the recipe and we ate it for dinner 3 nights in a row!

My husband and I are both big fans of Mexican and of pinto beans, so this was a great recipe, super easy to make, and makes a ton of leftovers. We haven't even used any toppings as it works great by itself. Thanks!
