We loved this. I made this early this morning so it would have time to sit until dinner. I made one small change and sprinkled the top of each serving with toasted coconut. No leftovers. We ate every bite of this salad. The pina colada mix was genius. NOTE: You might want to drain this salad before serving unless you like a juicier salad.

I made this for a bbq. Liked the flavor, but suggest making ahead of time for fruit to marinate. I didn't and added too much to get right taste. Needed slotted spoon.

Pina Colada mix can be found in the frozen juices section at grocery store ..... Bacardi is the brand I use most.  Looks just like a juice can.

Made this for a potluck fruit salad luncheon today.  Followed the directions except used fresh peaches and skipped the banana; everyone raved about the taste.  I served it in individual plastic cups.  One person suggested adding a sprinkle of coconut on top.  Thank you, TARAWVU, for sharing a refreshing recipe

I came upon this recipe while browsing thru the MyPlate recipe collection and I am glad I tried it.  I liked the addition of the pina colada mix in it.  It sets it apart from just regular fruit salad. I always like it when I can put together a healthy dish that my family enjoys! :)

This was such an easy salad to make and everyone LOVED it! I made it just like the directions other than eye balling the watermelon and pineapple. I felt it was easier than measuring the larger fruits. I added the piña colada mix and bananas then let it chill in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before serving. Perfect and delicious.

It was good, but letting it set to long in the pina colada mix made it a little mushy. Very tasty though!
