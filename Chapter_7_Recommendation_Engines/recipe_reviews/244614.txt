i tweaked the recipe slightly, i cut out the sugar, i used homemade peanut butter, added a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of oats, an egg and 1 banana, they are delicious and very healthy as there is no added sugar...

I made the recipe exactly as written and thought they were fine, but nothing special.  They were super easy, crispy (like a shortbread) and had a nice peanut butter taste.  But I prefer my cookies to be chewy.  Great if you need a gluten-free option though.   So my 3-stars is based on the exact recipe.

Then I dipped them so one half was covered in melted chocolate, took them to work, and people gobbled them up.  I still didn't "love" them though.

After reading some other reviews I decided to make them again, but used brown sugar instead of white.  I liked this much better, it gave them a softer texture without losing any of the simplicity or flavor.  I would give the brown sugar cookie a 4 star rating.

Ladies and gentlemen get your cold glasses of milk ready! Super easy and super delicious. This whips up-even by hand- in no time. I even used 3/4 cup of sugar and they were awesome. I weighed each cookie before baking (25 grams each) and it yielded 18 cookies (using 3/4 cup of sugar). Thank you for this recipe.

They're pretty good as is but if you want to take it to the next level, melt some chocalate (i used chocolate almond bark), dip them and set in fridge to chill until chocolate hardens. It taste exactly like a reese's peanut butter cup.
Made these for my fiancee and he absolutely loved them. I don't even like peanut butter and i couldn't stop eating them.

I substituted 1 cup of packed brown sugar for the granulated white sugar and they cooked up perfectly and tasted so good I had to make another batch. So simple and gluten free, too!

I LOVED this recipe!!! Yummy! Made exactly, but doubled and hand mixed.  Very flavorful, super easy and my nephew loved rolling the mixture into little balls. I forked them. They don't spread out so you can put a bunch on 1 cookie sheet. I will be making these again very soon!!! Thank you!

I am diabetic so I substituted 1 cup of Splenda baking sweetener and they turned out wonderful. But you must use the baking Splenda. Even my husband liked them, of course I did not tell him they were made with a sugar substitute at first. After tasting them, he didn't care.

The BEST Peanut Butter cookies ever!  I went on a search in the area bakeries and grocery stores for the best tasting PB cookies after Giant Foods changed their PB cookie recipe a few years ago.  So after not being able to find just the right cookie... I came across the 3-ingredient-peanut-butter-cookie recipe by Heather.  If you want to talk about just the right combinations of nutty flavor, bake-time and cost.  This is a winner all around!  NOTHING, Compares to this!  Thanks so much for these Heather they are awesome and I don't mind the extra calories.

I was certainly skeptical at first. I mean...3 ingredients? My husband and I really don't do a lot of desserts, but occasionally I like a bite or something sweet. Made them and added a touch of vanilla. Shaved a bit of 70% dark chocolate on top, and...YUM! It is raining now so I am heading to the kitchen to make some more!

For three simple ingredients I really liked these cookies. I added a dash of vanilla and used natural peanut butter. I split the recipe in half since it was my first time making these and they baked up beautifully. I would make these again in a pinch for a quick late night snack.

This is a fantastic base recipe. I gave 4 stars because I did make changes. I reduced the sugar by half because I felt 1 cup was going to be way too sweet for my taste. So I did 1/4 cup coconut sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar. 1 egg. I also added in 1 tsp of vanilla. I used pumpkin spice PB (the pumpkin spice was such a yummy addition, btw). I also used a 1/2 tsp of baking powder. At first, I was a bit nervous because after mixing everything, the ingredients resembled more of a batter look than a dough look. I decided to keep going & the cookies came out just fine. I did flatten them slightly with a fork before putting them in the oven. I baked half the batch for 8 minutes. They were melt in your mouth good. Soft & flavorful. They flew out of the kitchen like crazy. The 2nd half, I baked an extra few mins (maybe 2-3 mins more) because there are a couple of people in my fam who prefer a more well-done cookie. Delicious either way. Again, this is a wonderful base recipe to play around with as there is so much you can do with it! Love!

This recipe is one of my favorite cookies and my mother who cannot have wheat can eat these. I made them several times since they are easy and simple and yes different times I tried different things one time I added only half cup sugar this was the perfect amount for me after another time I only did 1/4cup sugar it still was good but not sweet like a cookie ought to be.  Another time I used ground up sesame and a banana very good and addicting instead of the egg it was good. One tablespoon to two tablespoons of water is equals to one egg.  I'm trying to learn to make things without eggs. Resemble chocolate oatmeal texture to me.

I added 1tsp of maple flavoring and 2pcs of cooked and crumbled "facon" ( vegetarian bacon) A simple cookie with ingredients we always have on hand. Quick too, from start to finish maybe a half hour! Rolled into 1" balls. Recipe made 3 dozen small cookies. Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! Excellent taste! The only change I made is extending the cook time to 12 minutes.
I also followed a suggestion made in a review to dip the fork in sugar before making the marks on the cookies.
After I made my first batch this way, I asked my sweetheart if I should continue this or leave it out. He voted to keep the sugar. 
With adding to the baking time my cookies didn't brown or have any dark edges. I have added time to other things I have baked, so I believe it's just my oven.

Excellent quick cookies for peanut butter lovers! And a great dairy/ gluten free option. Stuck to the recipes only added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Made these twice. Once I mixed the batter with an electric mixer as directed in the recipe and the other time by hand. Mixing by hand is a much better option. The batter was a much better consistently and easier to roll into balls. When mixed with the electric mixer, the mixture turned sort of crumbly and the peanut butter released a lot of oil, making the cookies greasy.

This is my go-to for quick and easy baking. It's perfect for the entire family, including my gluten free mother, who often begs me to make them. Today I made them again but with chocolate chips, and they were even better. I'd give this recipe 6 stars if I could. :)

I have made these cookies for....40 years or so, and I don't like them any other way. I use crunchy peanut butter and I only bake for 8-9 min.

I made this recipe and I'm not sure if it was just the recipe or the peanut butter I used (great value) but this recipe just didn't turn out for me. The cookies ended up flat and burnt a bit on the bottom. Ultimately it tasted fine but they looked a little wonky to me. I'd give it two and a half but since I can't, three. It's nothing against the recipe maker, I may have just messed up.

After seeing Buckwheat Queen’s review, my curiousity got the better of me and I had to give this a try.  While I don’t think these are quite as good as a full ingredient recipe, it does work.

Often when I want a cookie I want something sweet, so the first time I made these I was a little disappointed that they weren't. But the second time I followed one other person's advice and rolled them in sugar, when I want it to be even sweeter I also sprinkle sugar on top of the cookies after I flatten them with a fork. I love this recipe because I can remember how to make them with out having to look at the instructions and I do make them quite frequently. This recipe is one of my favorites.

Absolutely delicious!! I was skeptical at first, but I was craving peanut butter and sweets like never before. I didn't have a lot of ingredients, but that's the great part-there's only THREE and it's basic things most people have on hand all the time. These cookies are soft (I did decide to underbake mine by two minutes after trying the original time), chewy and have great peanut butter flavor!! My boyfriend LOVES them and SWEARS that they taste just like, even better than, his Mother's! He had his brother try them and he very much agreed. They've asked me to bring them to Christmas to taste them side by side!! I highly recommend this easy, quick, one-bowl cookie recipe! The only suggestion I have is to add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. It adds a warm sweetness that rounds out the peanut butter perfectly!

I didn't make any changes and the cookies were delicious. The only reason I docked one star is because they crumbled really easily and kind of made a mess. I would give four and a half stars if that was an option though.

I've made this cookies twice.  The first time, I made  them according to the recipe (to a T). They were far too sugary. I made them again tonight, I only used 3/4 cups of sugar. I also added chocolate chips this time. They were still a bit sugary for my liking, but much better than the first time. I cooked them for 12 minutes. They were nice and crispy/brown around  the bottom.  When I make  them again (as I rarely get a crazy for cookies, but when I do they are peanut butter), I think I'll use even less sugar or possibly brown sugar, if it can be substituted for the white sugar. I would even try sugar alternatives but not sure i they would work or not.

I know you’re not supposed to bake with natural peanut butter, but that’s what I had. I used brown sugar in place of white sugar.  The resulting dough was as crumbly as graham cracker crust, so I improvised and packed it into the bottom of an ungreased glass 8x8. I sprinkled a few dairy free chocolate chips on top and then baked at 350 for about 18-20 minutes. I let them cool completely and when the bars came out they were perfect!

This is so easy and very good. I made the mistake of over cooking them. My oven is old and is too hot. I will turn it down next time. I only had enough dough left for about 6 cookies after I filled my large baking sheet so I put them in the toaster oven. The were almost perfect. This is a keeper.

I made these exactly as the recipe stated and they were horrible! Harder than actual peanut brittle and fell apart very easily. I made three batches so all my ingredients went to waste. Do yourself a favor and go with either a box recipe or one with all the standard ingredients. These were very disappointing.

I've heard people rave of this 3 ingredient pb cookie recipe and just decided to try  it. So easy and good! Love that these are gluten free. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and did bake them 5 minutes longer because it didn't seem like 10 minutes was enough so they were more crunchy but still very good. Next time will bake 10 minutes so they will be more soft n' chewy. I got 20 cookies out of it.

Very easy and you probably have the ingredients in your house already! I made these cookies, mixing them by hand, using this recipe but added 1 tsp of vanilla. I made balls then rolled them in sugar. A few of them I pressed out with a fork but the rest I pressed Hershey Kisses into when they came out of the oven. Outstanding Peanut Butter Blossoms!

4 stars...an excellent rating for a 3-ingredient recipe that is ready to eat 10 minutes after you decide to make the cookie!  Hubby approves too.  I will definitely make these again.

This is quick, easy, and delicious.  I make it a four ingredient recipe and add 1 tsp. of vanilla.  Also I sneak a little raw sugar on top before baking.  So technically does that bring it to 5 ingredients? Still good with the originally 3.

Turned out delicious!  I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, and Great Value creamy peanut butter.  My husband said they're better than traditional pb cookies!  I'll be trying a sugar substitute in the next batch, hopefully they'll be just as delicious.

I’ve made these several times.  They don’t work well with the natural peanut butter. But work well with Skippy of Jiff or the like.  I put in some chocolate chips and a dash of vanilla and they are a favorite.

I did what the recipe says, and I am 14 years old who is trying to learn how to bake/cook. However, I made these cookies and it took me like 30 minutes to make it and 15 minites to bake it but the cookies I MADE are a bit chewy, a little sweet. I can say that it was a fail for me but it's a progress! I liked the cookies I made, so I'd make it again!

I reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup, like someone else suggested. I also added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. I took them out of the oven after 10 minutes and let them cool for 5. When I went to take them off the tray, they were clearly not done baking, so I put them back in for 2 minutes. This helped somewhat, and I probably could have kept them in for a few minutes more. 

They are incredibly soft, even after cooking for a while. It’s almost like eating kinetic sand, but the flavor is good. They’re easy to whip up when you just want something sweet and fast.

I made 1 change and that was that instead of baking it for 10 minutes I baked it for 12 minutes and my family said it was really good!  :)

So I liked these cookies. I cut back on the sugar by half a cup because I felt like I didn't need as much. I'm not a fan of leaving it like a ball so I used a fork to press down the center and baked for 6 mins then transfer to a cooling rack.

Made these per recipe first time. Loved them however they were very crumbly so you need a plate. Not a big deal. Second time I used this recipe and added 1 capful of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of maple syrup and some chocolate and peanut butter chips. Next level good for my family. Definitely adding this recipe to my recipe box. Thanks!

I had to use oil because I didn't have any butter, which made them very liquidy; I added a handful of flour so they didn't expand quite as much. A bit TOO peanut buttery for my taste, but they live up to their name.

I add 3 dashes of cinnamon, a cap of vanilla, and a couple extra tablespoons of sugar (to offset the extra liquid from adding vanilla) I also use cinnamon sugar to decorate instead of just sugar. this is a great base or stand alone recipe. I’ve made it a few times and my kids love it.

I wouldn't call this cookie. It's a "go to" recipe if you are having a sweet tooth and your cupboards are empty. Only change I made  was 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It's taste like it is, gooey peanut butter and sugar, no cookie texture. My son's first bite was... It's missing something mom. I totally agree son.

So quick and easy. I follow the directions as written. I’ve made them a couple of times and they’re really good. The only suggestion I have is to let them cool on the cookie sheet about five minutes before you take them off.

They were pretty good but if you make them use a half a cup of sugar or else they'll be way to sugary and maybe a tiny teaspoon of vanilla if you have it but other than that they were great

Very simple to make, however I made another batch with almond butter instead. I brought both to work and everyone preferred the almond butter over the peanut butter. They said the peanut butter cookie was too sweet but the almond butter was just right. It was a big hit. Definitely making it again!

Easy to make and tasty. They definitely take longer than 10 minutes to cook. Depending on the size of the cookie it is 15 -18 minutes in the oven.

I loved the cookies!
But I substituted the white sugar with coconut sugar. Made for a unique flavor that is simply delicious! 
I will definitely make these again!

They are quick, easy and taste great! I added almonds ,walnuts and chocolate syrup to some of them. It makes it good where the syrup is drizzled on top.

This was the easiest dessert to make. I would add just a tad more peanut butter but other than that, it was wonderful. For me, it made almost two dozen cookies. 12 in the first batch and 8 in the second. Definitely a good way to give a sweet snack after dinner. Didn't spend more than 30 minutes to get them all done.

I made these Keto with 1/4 c granulated stevia (instead of white sugar). Quick and easy, peanutty flavor. Baked in my toaster oven. Thumbs up! posted a photo.  4/22/2019

Proceed with caution! Using the recipe as is will give you cookies that are more like a super sweet peanut butter fudge disguised as a cookie.

I cut out the white sugar and used brown sugar. I also cut back the amount of sugar. It worked fine for me and my daughter. To change it up my daughter added a chocolate kiss in the middle of each cookie. We made several batches of each cook. With and without the chocolate. I love peanut butter cookies. Yummy recipe. It’s quick, inexpensive to make and great for a speedy peanut-butter fix! Thank you for sharing your recipe with us. There also alternative ways to change this recipe up, so for that reason and the taste and texture and very little clean up I am giving this recipe 5 stars.

This recipe was very good,  I just recommend substituting half of the sugar for brown sugar.  They did turn out a bit sweet for those in my family that don't enjoy sweets as much but I think these are still great cookies, maybe  add some tweaks to the recipe?

So easy to make. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and I also rolled the balls in granulated sugar before I flatten them with a fork criss cross.

These are delicious, my husband loves them and I usually have the ingredients on hand.  I have also used this as a base recipe,  wrapping the dough around 1/2 of a fun size snickers bar before baking for a peanut butter caramel nougat cookie.

I've made these a few times and love em. Can't really tell the difference between these and the other PB cookies I've made with many more ingredients. Quick and simple, especially when you have a sweet tooth and don't want to run out to the store. These are perfect for a quick sweet tooth solution. Love Em!!

I made this three times now and the recipe is a good one. 

The last time I made it, I tried something different , I added a dash of vanilla, and some whole unsalted peanuts. They came out great! 

Be sure to bake them just until golden brown. The cookie will be soft, but it will harden when it cools.

They were alright, but there it was just SO much sugar. I personally added a bit of flour as the dough was too loose for me to easily make balls out of for the cookie sheet, and I also added some chocolate chips. However my hubby loved them so I probably will make them again but probably with a few tweaks here and there. Probably try some experiments, etc.

I followed some of the tips and used brown sugar instead of white.  I used organic all natural peanut butter, I also added a dash of salt and had to bake an additional 5 minutes at 350 as they were too crumbly after only 10 minutes.  These were pretty good, super easy and took only a few minutes to whip up.  Will make again.

I was craving something sweet and need a quick fix. I googled easy peanut butter cookies and this popped up. I must say for three ingredients, I’m impressed. After they were cooked a put a little honey on top. 

Thanks, 

Alan

Super easy, soft cookies. Small cookies seem to work best because larger cookies crumbled a bit. I tried a couple with crumbled bacon-Shazam! No changes to the recipe.

I’ve made these several ways and my favorite is to add a bit of quick oats and roll the dough balls in sweetened coconut flakes. It’s like a Chik-o-Stik flavor! Yum!

I've been making this recipe for years, exactly as this recipe stated, and no other peanut butter cookie recipe comes close! You can't use just any peanut butter, though. Jiff creamy peanut butter is best to bring out that great  flavor, gooey center, and crispy edges. I'm not intentionally doing a commercial for Jiff, but over the past 30+ years of trying several brands and qualities of peanut butter for this recipe, I've found Jiff to be the best consistency and flavor peanut butter for this recipe.

These are amazing cookies and so simple.. This time I tried adding a teaspoon of vanilla and it just added to the flavor! Very very good recipe to use when you are trying to work with kiddos in the kitchen. Easy to follow for them!!

love these cookies super simple and quick.  my mistake was after the 7 minutes i took them out and they  were very muchy so i put them back in the oven and they came out a bit brown on the bottom but  then they were out for a minute and they were perfect.my tip to you is just take them out of the oven and the will firm up just enough. love these cookies!!!

Have been making this recipe for years now.  Super easy and delish. Lately I have been using different nut butters and cutting the sugar in half. Even better than regular pb. Just today I made a batch with almond and fruit butter-delish.

I've recommended this to others and they ask "is that all?" and the rest of the story is that they do not last long.

Amazing! They were great, even though my dad was skeptical over the fact that there was no flour. But they were very good either way.

They were very good but a little too sweet. I would add maybe 3/4 cup of sugar next time. But they aren't overly sweet, though. I had to cook about 15 minutes but that might be because I used an egg substitute instead of an actual egg. All in all, it's a very good and simple recipe.

Ok, these were easy to make so that is a plus. They didn't have the right mouthfeel to me. They don't actually seem like cookies. More like peanut butter/sugar combo puffs or something. I think if you can't eat flour these may be great but traditional peanut butter cookies are way better for me  because they taste and seem like cookies. They looked so cute ( I used a fork to press down so they looked like peanut butter cookies) but they did not taste/feel legit. They were like some alternative type of cookie in my opinion.

I've made these cookies many times. My sister can't eat wheat and the first time I made these for her she could not believe  how good they were. They are not the BEST peanut butter cookie ever but certainly the easiest. Many people have no idea they are gluten free unless you tell them! Also the batter can be fickle. I've had it turn greasy and once that happens there is no way of saving it that I have discovered. I beat the eggs and sugar first and after that is well beaten I gently fold in the peanut butter. That way I've never had it turn into a big grease ball but just dumping it all together and beating it I have had it turn greasy several times and it will not bake right once that happens.

The texture was chewy and great, but they tasted awful, not sweet at all. Earns a 3 because it's a good basic recipe to start with but needs more sugar and something extra to sweeten it (vanilla extract perhaps?) to perfect it.

I used all natural peanut butter (i'm allergic to the soy in the premixed ones) and it didn't get to a smooth consistency when mixing but they still held together really well and did not last long once they cooled off.  Huge hit!

This is a perfect, classic recipe just as it is written. That's what I'm rating.

I, like many others, like to add/change things up a bit. I leveraged recommendations from others and used half white granulated and half brown sugar, and I cut a bar of milk chocolate up into pieces and added the cookie mix. 

Learning - these cookies (obviously) are very sweet. I made them a little large the first time, and will definitely make them smaller next time (which is THIS week)!

SOOO easy! My daughter is gluten intolerant and trying to make decent gluten free cookies that actually taste wonderful without being a lot of work is amazing! I made these and followed the recipe except decreased the sugar as suggested by previous people and they turned out perfect! I served them to my neighbors and did not mention they were flourless until after they said they loved them...they were so surprised! Definitely a keeper. Anyone who likes peanut butter cookies will love these!

Recipe was easy and quick.  The  ingredients never got smooth and creamy. I used creamy Jif peanut butter and granulated sugar and a cage free  egg. It remained grainy and beaded but was able to  roll into  balls and press with fork as directed. Not sure what  they taste like im bringimg them to a cookie exchange.

So easy, so good!  I work with kids of all ages and abilities and all can participate.  The dough will be soft but don’t worry.  But just make the balls and get them in the oven.  I have done them without rolling them in sugar and they were good too.  Genius recipe.

perfect when you if you are limited ingredients. however the only down side for me is that they came apart before I could get them off the cooking pan thingy (2 eggs maybe instead).. other than that they taste really good.

I made it with chunkey peanut butter and followed recipe, but used mixer and over mixed it.  Batter was somewhat crumbly, taste was great and it did stick together okay.  Its a keeper and I plan to try some of the other variations that have been suggested.

They are great for something sweet you can just whip up in a moments notice. Most people have these three basic ingredients in their house at all times. When they come out of the oven, you can immediately top with a Hershey Kiss or mini Reese's Cup.

First time making anything and loved this! Super easy and delicious! I added a little less peanut butter though! Other than that it was outstanding!

I'm amused by the other ratings where they added a little of this and added a little of that!!! All sounds good, but it's no longer a "three ingredient cookie"!!! Might as well write your own recipe!!! It's like rating a red Chevy, but painted it blue and switched to a Ford motor lol. I'm guilty of the same.... I used a 50/50 white/brown sugar mixture with a pinch of baking soda. It tasted awesome, but the cookies wouldn't stay together. I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, so the next time I stuck to the original recipe and they came out awesome!!! Perhaps a little too much peanut butter as the uncooked batter was a little sticky, but end product was great!!! Great idea for a quick impromptu after dinner desert.

Pretty good cookies. I like the no flour part. I didn't use a mixer I did it by hand and my cookies took about 14 minutes to cook. My hubby approves. Next time ill try with stevia because im diabetic possibly put cranberries and walnuts in too hehe

I use only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and a tsp of flour. Mixed by hand. Love the soft yet crumbly texture.  May add vanilla extract next time, but this is a great recipe to build on!  My husband doesn't eat pb, so I make a batch and cook as needed, for on fresh baked cookies on demand. Also keeps me from eating too many at one sitting :-).

This is an awesome recipe if you want to make something quick, without the hassle of getting all the standard ingredients out. They are soft and moist, not crumbly like some PB cookies. The first time I made them I used the full cup of sugar, but found they were way too sweet for our tastes. The second time I used 1/2 cup of sugar and they tasted better and had plenty of sweetness. Next time I am going to use 1/3 cup of sugar. I put chocolate chips on top when they came out of the oven and they semi melted which made them even more delicious. Great for gluten free diets or carb watchers.  Very happy with these and the three ingredients.

I tweaked the recipe and used coconut palm sugar. In order to make the recipe thick enough to form dough I used two cups of the sugar. I also made a second batch without the extra cup of sugar and added about a cup of oats to it and it turned out well and kind of like a  soft granola bar.

These were way too sweet. This coming from someone with a phenomenal sweet tooth. I couldn't eat them and my 2 year old turned them down as well. They almost have the same flavor and texture as peanut butter fudge.

These were just ok for us. They were definitely easy to make and the taste was alright, but they just aren't as good as a 'usual' peanut butter cookie, IMO. These were fairly 'wet', so I just used a cookie scoop to portion them right out onto the cookie sheet.  I did use crunchy peanut butter , but I don't think that would affect anything in that regard.  Again, these were fine, we just like our regular recipe better. Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the recipe exactly and they are so gross.  The oil had to be mopped up with paper towels before I rolled the balls, after I rolled the balls and after I baked them.  And that might have been ok if they had tasted good. Nope. Nope. Nope. 
Will stick with the traditional recipe with 12 ingredients.

I made a few modifications to this recipe after some trial and error. 

1. The smooth peanut butter I bought already had sugar in it, so I only added a 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of a full cup. It was plenty!
2. I used my hand to roll small balls of dough and placed them on a parchment-lined baking sheet. I flattened the balls with my fingers and skipped the fork part. 
3. These cookies don't need longer than six minutes to bake. 
4. Pulled them out of the oven and left them on the sheet to cool. They firm up after a few minutes. Then I transferred them to the baking rack to cool. 

Even with the modifications, these cookies were just okay.

I made this as bars -- just plopped everything into a 6x9in pan and baked slightly longer than the recommended time. I think I didn't have to, though. And I think should have cut them up and separated them while still warm instead of cooling them down first. It came out rather crumbly-crunchy on top, but quite chewy in the middle, which was what I was going for. Had it with some ginger tea, complimented it great! I think it'll be great with black coffee or tea as well, or with some unsweetened fresh citrus juice. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Not good, even with recipe tweaks. I thought the good reviews were because the cookies were objectively good; turns out they were just good for gluten free cookies. IF YOU EAT GLUTEN, DON'T MAKE THESE. I had to throw them away they were that bad. There was so much sugar, no matter how much you undercooked them they caught on the edges, and they were gross and greasy and just... don't make these. Seriously. Normal peanut butter cookies are worth the effort.

I'd rate it 3.5 stars for flavor; fine but not that special. Easy to make & I subbed brown sugar for the granulated sugar.

They taste incredible. I'm a diabetic so I substitute Splenda, but the only issue I have with these cookies is that they fall apart very easy! If you don't mind eating broken cookies they are wonderful!

I only rate this recipe a four star review because this exact recipe is posted here at least three times and has been on the back of the Kraft Peanut Butter Jars for over 40 years. With that said, it's a simple awesome recipe.  Don't worry about the tops browning when you cook them. If they start to get browned around the edges, you've cooked them too long. They'll have a whitish appearance in the oven. It all depends how thick you make them on how long that they cook.  Mine are average sided cookies and it takes 10 minutes with my oven at 350 degrees.

Love these cookies they taste great and they're easy, easy, easy to make. Very simple recipe, cookies taste just like a peanut butter cookie  should taste. My husband wont stop eating them!  This is my second time making these and it wont be the last!  This recipe  made 36 cookies my first time making them and 40 this time. depending on how big you want them to be. Tip: I dipped my fork in water every time  i pressed them to the dough to keep from sticking to it.   Enjoy!

I am pinning this one. It is so simple and no worries about gluten. I used natural peanut butter to reduce the sugar for my husband that is diabetic.

I love the simplicity of this and it's exactly the type of thing I need to make a quick treat. My son really liked them so I'll have to test them on my daughters. I also appreciate the fact that you can modify these all kinds of ways. Quick, simple & tasty. Glad I found this and I'll definitely make again.

I didn't make any changes. I've never had luck baking cookies, but this recipe was perfect for me. It was 1-2-3 easy! It made my house smell so good, like I was a cookie baker! I love this recipe. As a matter of fact, it's been a while. Time for a batvh!

I used 1 packed cup brown sugar  and added 1 teaspoon Vanilla. After I criss-crossed the cookies, I lightly sprinkled white sugar over them prior to baking.  I've had several requests for the recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times, usually with creamy peanut butter but tonight with crunchy. Came out pretty great! I do, as other users have indicated, add a pinch of salt, baking powder and about a tsp of vanilla extract. I love that since there's so few ingredients, there's barely any clean up!

Way too sweet for my liking. I substituted white sugar for a 1/2 cup of Splenda and for me it was still too sweet. Next time I'm going to try it without sugar at all. Otherwise great recipe and super easy!!

I Came Across This Recipe Looking For Something Quick & Easy To Take My Sweet Tooth Away.  And Surprisingly, It Did Just That. Only Changes I Made To This Recipe Was Adding 1 cup Of Brown Sugar To Add A Little Chewiness To The Cookie. And It Did Just That. I Made This Recipe With Smooth Peanut Butter & Again With Super Chunky Peanut Butter Both Came Out DELICIOUS. This Will Always Be My Go-To Peanut Butter Cookie Recipe For Now On.

Made my first batch tonight ... Perfect for a low carb diet treat. My family loves them 
I did only bake the second batch for 9 minutes.

Very yummy. The cookies were a bit soft out of the oven. I added two more minutes and it seemed to help firm the cookies a little. 

Easy to follow recipe.
