I used a name-brand marshmallow fluff and chunky peanut butter, other than that I kept to the recipe. Oh, wait. I did bake these in an 8x8 glass baking dish, not a 9x13. My brownies were done at a little over 30 minutes at 350*. These turned out insane-good. Crazy-delicious. YES, these are very sweet......cut them small-ish. Milk is a must have with these bars.

Loved it!  So simple, and a nice flare to the treats.  I altered it a bit and blended cheesecake into the brownies, and used all natural chunky peanut butter.  It wasn't as rich as other reviews said, and I'm not a sweets person either.
Will definitely make this again.

If you didn't guess from the ingredients, these are insanely sweet, but they're really good.  Cut them small - a little goes a long way.  And have a tall glass of milk close by.

Next time I think I'll try pressing the rice cereal into the marshmallow fluff, then drizzle the peanut butter/chocolate over the top to make them a bit prettier.  Don't expect these to look fancy, but they are really tasty.  I'm sure they'd be a kid pleaser!

This recipe was excellent and very tasty. I made two changes that aren't necessary but may help (your mileage may vary). First, I added slightly more peanut probably--I didn't feel like getting the cup measure dirty so I approximated. Second, I pretty much doubled the amount of rice krispies called for in the recipe. After adding the specified amount, the peanut butter/chocolate concentration was too high. This also seems to have improved the ratio of the rice krispy portion to the rest of the dessert.

Candler had it spot on...but I tried it as the recipe laid out. The chocy & peanut butter aspect was too thick in height once applied. I used a whole jar of marshmallow creme; reserved 1tblspn for the mix on top just for kicks. 5 kids tested it out - 1 inhaled it. 1 took off the topping. 2 flipped it over to just eat the brownie. 1 picked at it to nibble a bit & walked off. My hubby however eats it up as does my adult daughter - go figure lol
I like the concept of the 3 but it's like a turducken - just because you can doesn't mean you should. :)

Super rich. I only had half a bottle of marshmallow creme, but for future I'd make sure the PB/chocolate mix was proportionate to the marshmallow creme. Less might be more. Instead of Rice Krispies, I used the granola cereal I had on hand, which has candied ginger in it. That added a nice depth of flavor to the brownies. (I didn't use 3 c. though; just a half cup or so. A full cup would prob. have been fine.) I used the tip of another reviewer to sprinkle on marshmallow layer instead of stirring into chocolate mixture. Better to do right after spreading the marshmallow mixture, while it's more sticky from being warm.

I also used semisweet chocolate.

Very good!  I brought these to a potluck at work and the plate was clean in no time at all.  Love the crispiness with the softness of the brownie.

I absolutley love then! I would highly recommend adding a stick of butter to the chocolate peanut butter mix tho. Without butter it is too dry and hardens too quickly. Also highly recommend eating them cold, tastes way better

These are delicious but the name just doesn't do them justice! Super easy to do, hard to mess it up. Great treat to make for parties, just make sure to cut them small as someone else mentioned. They are very thick and rich. 5 Stars!!
