Amazing veriation of an original recipe. Most people unfamiliar with the flavor of the Japanese culture may not admire a recipe such as this. I, on the other hand, have always enjoyed the Japanese variety in food (as well as many other cultures) and have become accustomed to dishes containing such things as nori (seaweed), red bean, raw fish, wasabi (green horseradish) and other aspects. If you are not one for meals other than medium-rare meat and potatoes, then you definitely will not cherish such a recipe. But, if you like your tastebuds to soar on other not-so-common levels, then you really should try this recipe and others like it! ;)

This is a really easy recipe and just like the mochi that I've always loved! It's really good. I make my mochi with a filling inside. Sometimes I use peanuts and sugar, coconut, red bean, or taro filling.

This turned out really delicious!!  The bake time (at least with my oven) was a little too long - took it out after 55 min and the edges were already getting dark.  Also, I think I might cut back on the butter next time, or not grease the dish, as there was butter literally pooling on the top of the cake when I took it out of the oven.  The texture and flavor were spot on, and I will definitely make this again with the tweaks mentioned.

Delicious! I halved the recipe (and therefore used an 8x8 pan and baked for about 30 min.) but did everything else as written. The cake is chewy and sweet and I love that rice flavor. I had extra mochiko (sweet rice flour) & am so glad I took a chance and tried this recipe. I will make this again!

Very much like Japanese mochi so I wouldn't recommend it for everyone (the very sticky nature of it is probably not to many North American person's tastes).

The "scant teaspoonfuls" were too small and stayed on top (bottom) of my cake.  Next time I'll drop more like TBs and try to shove some into the batter.  Overall very good :)

Yum! I did omit the red bean paste and put shredded coconut on the top. We served it at a Cub Scout dinner and everyone loved it. It was gone in a flash.

I also cooked it in a water bath. Delicious!

Quite good. Quite authentic.  My first attempt turned out a bit on the dry side, but I think it's due to my inexperience with cooking at altitude.  The flavors were good.  I will try it again, adjusting for altitude.

This cake (heated up) with vanilla ice-cream is delicious.  I recommend having it with something like ice cream or sorbet to balance the sweet/buttery taste of the cake.

This recipe came out very dry and crumbly. Stuck to the pan really bad even with cooking spray. I've had Butter Mochi recipes that turned out great and I was craving it so I tried this recipe, very disappointed.

You must use the sweet-rice-flour for this recipe or it will be inedible! I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 60 min. I dropped in small cubes of guava-paste in a 5 by 6 "blobs" pattern (they will sink). I toasted coconut and sprinkled on top. Delicious!!

Another variation on this recipe is to mix the red bean paste right into the batter. The cake will be colored by it, and equally delicious! Loved the suggestion to use a water bath when baking; that would simulate cooking the cake in a steamer.

I followed the directions exactly. It came out the same as the pic, but it taste disgusting! It's rubbery and chewy. It's like chewing on an oily rubber toy. Never again.

I spent some time in Asia in college and this tasted exactly like the desserts I would get over there. Made it for my family and sad to say, not a hit what so ever. I also did not use the red bean ( I think I had enough of it to last my life time a few years ago) but used a suggested alternative, pinapple, which did add a good flavor.

I took this to a Japanese themed supper club last night.  While it was definitely easy to make, nobody (including myself) liked it.  Several people told me that it was indeed pretty authentic... perhaps it was just too exotic for my Western tastes.  :)

I love this recipe. Most of my family is less enthusiastic. The texture is very different from American desserts.
