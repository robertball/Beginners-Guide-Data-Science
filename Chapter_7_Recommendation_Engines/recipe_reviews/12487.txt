Not serving this ice cream pie at Thanksgiving from now on, would be like not serving turkey!  I used a ready made graham cracker crust, which I brushed with an egg white and put in the oven for a few minutes to crisp, and then followed the directions.  I made a caramel sauce by melting 1 stick of butter over medium heat, adding 1 cup sugar and stirring until a deep golden brown.  I added 1 cup whipping cream and whisked until smooth.  Delicious!

It's Fall, and I was in the mood for pumpkin pie but wanted something light, and this dessert fit the bill. It is so good--my family loved it! It's creamy and very delicately spiced and still has that wonderful pumpkin flavor. In place of the orange juice, I used maple syrup. To serve I drizzled hershey's new Dulce de Leche syrup over it and the flavor combo was amazing. Thank you for an excellent recipe Nancy--it is a great year-round dessert & would be perfect for Thanksgiving!

I make this pie now every holiday season.  It is the best twist on a standard pumpkin pie that I've ever found.  Everyone I know LOVES this pie; and it's so easy too!

***I have to upgrade my review to five stars. I made this pie twice for two family gatherings and both raved about it. The recipe calls for waaay too much ice cream- enough to make two pies. I just stored the extra ice cream mixture in a plastic container with a piece of waxed paper beneath the lid to stop ice crystals from forming. This pie makes great leftovers and the only hard part is transferring the pie without it melting. I recommend an ice chest or cold-thermal bag with ice packs. This is a sure-fire pie!

I tried this with a commercially made shortbread cookie-type crust, and it was really good!  Quick and easy to make, but must allow time to freeze it before serving.

This is a different wonderful pumpkin pie to serve.  I made this years ago but instead of the graham cracker crust I lined the pie pan with gingersnaps.  Try it you will like it.

Delicious! I served it half thawed and it was amazing. I use the crust recipe for other pies now.

Yummy! Just make sure to let the pie thaw first until you can easily cut and serve it. Top with Cool Whip like traditional pumpkin pie:)

This was excellent. While I was picking up ingredients I spotted ginger snaps and decided to use those as a crust instead. This was a LOT of filling, so I used a 9 x 13 pan instead of a pie plate.  No one could wait until it thawed a bit - everyone dug in and devoured it. Fantastic dessert!

This recipe was good, but made too much. Few people chose this desert at Thanksgiving.

I made this a few years ago for my daughters who can't have typical pumpkin pie because of egg allergies and it has become a staple dish at Thanksgiving. I garnish with whipped cream and whole cranberries and top each slice with a spoonful of cranberry sauce.

Delicious!  I used a premise graham cracker crust to make it even easier.
