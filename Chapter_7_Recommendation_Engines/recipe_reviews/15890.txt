I have been looking for a simple recipe that still tasted like my mother's.  I adapted tyhis recipe by adding cream of celery and cream of chicken.  I also dropped the wine and mushrooms.  I added two cans of chicken broth, which made it moist.  It was delicious!  My family could not stop raving over it.  They were impressed that it tasted better than my mom's!

This was the first time I made Thanksgiving dinner for my in-laws, and I used this recipe.  We all loved it!  It was easy for me to prepare.  I adjusted the seasonings to their taste and it was a HUGE hit!  I got 2 requests for this recipe.

I made this stuffing recipe last year with an apricot-glazed turkey recipe also found here. It was a big hit with my family and my husband's family. I loved it and will make it again this year.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  No one in my family liked it.  I ended up throwing it away.  Even though we love white wine the flavor was too overpowering in this recipe.  Maybe it would be better with 1/2 cup wine and more chicken broth?

This is the best! I omit the egg and add a little more wine and broth until it is moist.  It's a hit with the whole family, including the kids!

I added a little garlic and 1LB of spicy cooked sausage, and enough chicken broth to make it moist. Use a white wine that you like to drink, because you will taste it in the Dressing. My Family and friends love this recipe and I have passed it on several times. Thanks for making our Thanksgiving (or anytime we have chicken)special!!

The cornbread gives this recipe an interesting crunch and sweetness.  Very easy & inexpensive to make.  Yum!

My daughter LOVED this, and she HATES dressing.  I changed it by using vegetable broth since we are mainly vegetarians here for the last few months. I also used a sweet cracked wheat bread to add more whole grain.  Awesome! It disappeared in a flash.

Being a male, I was scared of making the stuffing(as well as anything else) after a grandparent had made it for 20+ years.  This actually turned out well.  Now it wasn't the way Gramma made it, but we had no complaints.  I thought it was a bit dry, but I cooked it on 325 with green bean casserole for over an hour.  Not too shabby for a guy!

I made the dressing and it was not bad. I added a little celery and it was good. I am going to make it again for Christmas.

The 1/8 teaspoon cornbread, should be 8 slices. I used almost an entire pan and it turned out great. My family loved it. I will be using this one again at Christmas.

This recipe was just ok.  Although the ingredients sounded like a great mix I was very dissapointed by the way it tasted.  If I were to try this recipe again I would reduce the amount of wine as it seemed to be the only thing I could taste.

Our Thanksgiving guests loved this stuffing.  I would add a little less pepper next time, ours was a little spicy.
