Excellent. I piped this into rosettes on a parchent lined baking sheet and stuck them in the freezer.  Served them with plum pudding and a brown sugar sauce.

This is delicious.  I'd never had hard sauce before and didn't know what to expect.  I used bourbon because that was what I had on hand.  Don't be confused by the word "sauce."  This comes out as a spread.  I served this with Chocolate Plum Pudding found on this site.

The texture and flavor were excellent until I started putting in the zest.  The orange flavor was overwhelming to my Plum Pudding, and the brandy curdled the mix.  No one else had curdling trouble so that must just be me, I didn't take a star off for that.  I can see how this sauce would be delicious on cinnamon rolls but it was just too much for plum pudding.  Leaving out the  juice and zest and adding the brandy a little at a time to taste would have yielded a perfect sauce.  Oh well.  Next time!

Pretty yummy.  This recipe makes a LOT of the brandy butter.  Next time I think I'd cut it in half.

I wasn't taken by this.  It seemed to add little to my dessert.

The Hard Sauce is sensational with peach, or any fruit cobbler.

Very pretty and tasted good. Not the strongest hard sauce for those who like a strong Brandy taste, but would be perfect for those who don't. This recipe makes a lot,but that was fine for me since I was icing a large fruit cake.
