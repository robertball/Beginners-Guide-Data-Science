This was a pretty decent and easy recipe. Although, the recipe calls for way too many marshmallows, and the sweetened condensed milk made it a little overly sweet for my taste. I would substitute some unsweetened evaporated milk next time, and cut back on the marshmallows. One thing I did that was good, I substitued broken graham crackers for the peanuts. It made it taste like little s'more nuggets. My family loved that.

This recipe was fantastic.  Everyone who tried it had said it was great.  It is such a quick and easy recipe.  I used a 10 1/2 ounce bag instead of a 16 ounce bag of marshmallows.

These were wonderful. The only thing I would do different next time is to add less marshmallows.

Couldn't be easier to make and super-delicious.  I made this for a coworker who can't have egg or gluten.  She LOVES these!  I do believe the marshmallow amount is a typo.  I used 3/4 of a 10 oz bag and it was PLENTY.  I also used half semi-sweet chocolate and 1/2 butterscotch morsels.  So so good!

very yummie, though i find whole milk works best, as no extra sugar is needed.
WARNING
cojack recommended adding graham crackers. if you do this, don't freeze. if you thaw, they become mushy, though you can eat them from the freezer.

I dotn know what I did wrong but this was a gooey mess. THe flavor was great but it was impossible to cut into bars or whatever - you had to scoop it with a spoon - it was more like taffy or something. Oh well

Used 10 oz. marshmallows as others suggested and it was plenty!  I will make these again but I think I will add some peanut butter to the chocolate- it just seemed to be the only missing thing.

This was an easy and delicious recipe. I added crushed digestives though to make it more of an original rocky road recipe.  I've made it twice now.  Very tasty!

The recipe is great! I did change things up abit. I used peanut butter, unsweetened evap. milk, coloured marshmellows( 1/2 of a small bag) and pure chocolate chips because i dont like the taste of semi-chocolate. They melt in our mouth and all over your hands..lol...very addictive!!!!

Easy, quick, and delicious. Used less marshmallows and left out the nuts (allergies), but it came out great. Next time I would make it in a smaller pan, so the bars can be a little thicker.

These were great, everyone ate them up....but this is the same recipe that was submitted by Eaglebrand, even though I didn't use their product, I made the sweetened condensed milk from scratch using another recipe off this site.

Amazing rocky road recipe! My family voted it "best tasting dessert" in our family-wide friendly competition this thanksgiving! Awesome!
I added one thing: a few extra marshmallows scattered on the top and a drizzle of melted peanut butter!

This recipe is extremely easy and fast and the candy is delicious.  I used about 10 ounces of marshmallows, which was an ample amount.

Yum!  The only change I made was to use half of the peanuts specified and replace the rest with dried banana chips.  They turned out amazingly well.

This recipe is good with some changes. Instead of just chocolate chips I used amix of butterscotch, white chocolate and chocolate chips. Instead of sweetened condesed milk I used normal milk and less of it. After I poured it into the pan I sprinkled on butterscotch chips, peanuts and crushed animal crackers. With the changes it was good. Kinda like a s'mores. :)

Another one of my Christmas "must makes". It's nice that it is so easy and makes a lot. I only use the 10 1/2 oz size package of marshmallows though, and that's plenty. I melt the chocolate mixture in a large heavy saucepan on the stovetop rather than in the microwave.

I rated this three stars because it asks for WAY too many marshmallows. I used maybe a third? You could use more, but it's just too much for us, and not enough chocolate with all of the marshmallows. Quick, easy, and something for the kids to help out with.

This recipe was super simple, quick, and tasty! The only thing I did differently was I only used a 10 1/2 oz bag of marshmellows since a lot of the reviews said 16 oz was too much. I do think that next time I would use unsweetened condenced milk because it was a little too sweet. Other than that these were so tasty and I will definately make them again! They would be great to make over the holidays and add them to Christmas baskets :)

Very easy and delicious. I gave it only 4 stars because I too thought it required WAY too many marshmallows. I only used about 5 ounces and found them overpowering. I did subsitute graham cracker for the peanuts, and it was wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!!!

I was a little dissapointed that this was just a gooey mess. I gave it 5 stars anyhow because the "goo" was my fault. I used Evaporated milk instead of condensed....Big mistake. It still had a wonderful flavor and my husband ate and loved it anyway. I will definately make again but will follow directions more carefully :)

OMG! This the best candy I have ever made! It was so good, that my fridge couldn't stop opening. The I brought to work, everybody wanna 2nd /3rd helping. I suggest one thing because it's too sweet, just put less condensed milk, then it taste so nice. Love the gooey-ness, and the crunchy-ness

This turned out like soup. I don't know what happened but it never set up. Don't use to milk you can make the chocolate creamier with just a tablespoon of butter.

These are so good! I brought some to work with me to share with a few co-workers, BIG mistake as I was practically begged to bring them in on a regular basis!

Made these back at Christmas, but just remembering to rate and review everything now.  These were SOOOOOO easy to make and a huge hit with everyone that got them in their Christmas goody bags.    I had a thought that at Christmas they seem to make the colored red & green (pastel) marshmallows and that would probably look really cool mixed in with some white ones. Definitely will make again.

Turned out very tasty, BUT, It turned out really sticky. I followed recipes like it said. Just used the suggestion to use less marshmallows. Was the chocolate mixture supposed to be cooked to a certain temp to set up. I would give it 5 stars for taste but not setting up knocked it down to 3

These were good, but when I added the marshmallows they melted into the chocolate mixture. I added some more on top just so that you could tell they were in it, but I thin I like this one other recipe better for rocky road candy.

These are great, I added the peanuts and marshmallows by feel rather than sticking to the specific measurements and it worked really well.  I also made this adding a cup of peanut butter (I had tasted one before that had that pb taste to it) and it was wonderful!

It took me 5 minutes to make these.  And for that they get a 5 star.  I only used a 10oz bag of marshmallows and they were prefect.

Was a hit at a bridal shower that I took it to.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Only problem I had was that they were still a little gooey on the bottom, other than that they were perfect.  I also cut back to a medium bag of marshmallows and it still seemed like there were too many.

Yummy and very dangerous! This recipe will definitely become one of my "regulars". I love to bake, but liked that I can make this without having to turn on the oven. I only bought a 10 oz marshmallow bag, and didn't even use that up. Regardless, very good and easy recipe.

I made these and put them in litte cellophane bags to give to colleagues at work. They LOVED them! There was definately nothing to bring home. I doubled the recipe and set it in a foil tray. I used a mixture of milk and dark chocolate just for preference but will definately be making this again. Thank you for the great recipe

Great candy recipe.  I received a lot of
complements at our Dance Club.  My Husband and I teach Ballroom & Swing and
I make a lot of Desserts weekly. It's fun
going through all of your recipes.

It was really good. I love marshmallows, peanuts, and chocolate, so the three together were delicious. I did use less marshmallows than the recipe called for though.

Wonderful. Extremely simple. My family totally loves it. Will probably have to make another pan before Christmas!! I too only used 10 1/2 ounce bag of marshmallows.  Thanks for the recipe.

Super Easy. Followed other readers advice, cut back on marshmallows, used real chocolate chips-a mix of flavors. Actually I’ve made this several times now. My suggestion is to use a spray like butter or coconut on the wax paper or cutting utensil so it doesn’t stick. I wear disposable gloves when mixing all ingredients and it helps to spray those a tiny bit too. Just my thoughts,no changes to recipe.

I don't own a microwave, so I melted chocolate and butter on the stove in a double boiler. 
I'm a very amateur Baker, and not a very good one at that. So when I get the choice to do non-bake desserts it's my go to! This was so simple and delicious! You can also add ingredients easily to fit what you like. Cherries would be really good in this think ?? something easy enough to play around with while still being a classic!

It was a sweet simple recipe to follow! It was quick and very yummy! I used walnuts in my rocky road, not a huge fan of peanuts! I have a question though, how long can this candy last for in the fridge? Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This was so delicious, and typically I'm not even that big of a marshmallow lover.  My kids of course loved it too.  I used a non-fat sweetened condensed milk that I had on hand, real butter, semi sweet chocolate chips, and almost a whole 10 ounce bag of mini marshmallows.  I microwaved the chocolate chips, butter, and condensed milk all together in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, which is how I make fudge btw.  After mixing in only 2 cups of peanuts which was plenty, and the marshmallows, I spread the mixture out into a casserole dish and sprinkled the remaining two handfuls of marshmallows on top and pressed them down.  This recipe is a definite keeper, yum!

First time making this and I can’t believe how easy it is! I agree with everyone else, way too many marshmallows..... and I left out the pnuts, but like the idea of crumpled up graham crackers! I didn’t freeze it tho, I stuck it in the fridge..... hope it hardens..... will have to see. Are we supposed to freeze it?

This was a big gooey mess.  The candy didn't harden and the marshmallows all melted into the chocolate.  I used almonds - what a waste!

Easy, yummy go to recipe. I use walnuts instead of peanuts. Usually takes a day to really set up. Dont be tempted to stick it in the fridge as it will soften back up when you pull it out.

I made this candy because my husband loves rocky road and I happened to have half a can of condensed milk in the fridge. ( I halved everything else too) I thought it was just ok. husbands and 5 year old liked it, older 3 kids not as much. Think I'll try a different recipe next time.

The first time I melted the chocolate and butter together and it got clumpy.  So I called TollHouse and they suggested not to addhe t butter until the chocolate is melted.  So I tried it again, melted the chocolate, then added the butter and it got clumpy again.

Awesome and super easy.  I halved recipe using an 8x8" pan.  Measured out chocolate using a mix of bitter & semi.  Once it started to melt, I simply stirred in the sc milk until it hit a consistency I liked.  Then eyeballed the peanuts and marshmallows.  I *almost* added raisins as someone else suggested, but was afraid it would overwhelm.  In retrospect, I think a 50/50 mix of raisins and nuts would be great.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks so much for recipe!
