These kabobs were delicious!  I made this for a bbq recently and instead of basting the sauce on while it was cooking, I used it for a marinade overnight (just meat, no vegetables) and then cooked the kabobs the next day without any extra sauce basted on them, and they were a hit with everyone!

This has to be one of the best beef kabob recipes I've come across on this site! I didn't bother cooking it on the stove though, I just melted the butter in a microwave safe dish and added the rest of the ingredients. I used about 1 & 1/2 cups of low sodium V8 and used 2 Tbsp. of dried minced onion instead of chopped.  Whenever I see a marinade that calls for ketchup I use chili sauce as a good rule of thumb. It just seems to provide that little extra kick. I also used smoked paprika vs. regular because I had some on hand.  I reserved half of the marinade in a small dish for later use and put the beef in the rest and let it marinate for a full 24 hours.  I skewered the beef and veggies separately and used the reserved marinade to baste the veggies. It's important to cook the beef and veggies separate because they cook at different rates.  Plus, you don't want to overcook your beef, cook it to how you like your steak.

I made these for a very large crowd.  EVERYONE loved them!  Be sure to put foil on the grill though.  Kinda messy.

Good but only thought the sauce was so-so.  The tomato juice flavor really overwhelms the other ingredients.  Also, I think about 1/2 the sauce is plenty and I would recommend marinating the meat in the sauce for several hours to tenderize it a bit.

Excellent!  Definitely a keeper!  I halved the sauce, marinated the beef for a few hours before skewering in some of the sauce and saved the rest for basting on the coals---fabulous!  The 10-year old insisted on taking the leftovers to school in his lunch kit the next day.  Look forward to a summer full of kabobs!

I enjoyed the concept but I did not enjoy the sauce very much. It just didn't sit right with me. I doubled the sauce and ended up with a TON of kabobs. This recipe definitely goes a long way. I will probably not be making this again though.

our favorite recipe on this site.  the sauce is perfect.  we marinate the meat overnight in a vinegar/worcestershire sauce, which makes the meat very tender....once you add the sauce to it-its wonderful.

Excellent...I made the sauce, and used 3/4 of it to marinate the steak pieces.  Used the rest to baste steak and veggies as they were cooking....made extras to use for lunch next day, only...there were none left.

Instead of tomato juice, use V-8 regular or spicy.  Its great and does not have that overpowering tomato juice flavor.  Otherwise great!

I can't say this was a keeper.  I didn't enjoy the tomato sauce as a base.  If I were to try it again, maybe I'd use a spicy tomato sauce.  If you like tomato, use more than "1 dash" of hot sauce.  It's very bland. Thanks for sharing this recipe, though.  I think it would be appealing to some, just not me and my 3picky eaters!

My family and I think they are very good,I dont think there is too much sauce as you use it to baste the kabobs while they are on the grill. I do not like tomoatos or tomato jusice but this sauce is so yummy-so if you are not a tomato person dont pass this one up!

This is a great sauce recipe but does nothing to enchance the beef.  Next time, I would marinate the beef (will have to search allrecipes for a good recipe) and just make this sauce to serve on the side.  The sauce would also be good as a dip for beef fondue.

I thought these were delicious!  I added extra onion (chopped too much) and seasoned meat with steak seasoning and a little Lawry's before threading. I grilled on a grill pan with a little olive oil.  Turned out great!

Oh boy do my husband and I love this recipe!  Only the first time  I made it, I forgot to buy tomato juice, so I used a can of tomato soup instead.  It was so good I've been doing that ever since!

Unfortunately, this one was neither "the best" or "saucy".  We were left craving other kabobs we had made in the past.

Left out the tomato juice since we did not have any.  Added just 1/2 cup of water in its place.  Sauce was terrific and a hit.  Will definately make this again.

Very good! I added zuchinni and squash as well as yellow peppers. Definitely use foil on the grill to hold the sauce. It could be messy otherwise.

These were absolutely the best kabobs I've ever had. No substitutions needed. Even my husband who is not a sauce person loved loved loved this recipe. We had chicken the next night and he asked if I had any of the sauce left. This is a keeper recipe. Thanks Debbie!!

I made this marinade tonight for our Kabobs and was completely unimpressed.  It didn't taste bad, but it certainly won't be used again here.

Awesome.  I made the marinade the night before and let the meat tenderize for about 18 hours before grilling.  They were a huge hit.  I even left out the hot sauce because last minute realized I didn't have any.  Will add it next time for a little kick.

This turned out great!. I spiced it up a bit by subbing some El Pato Jalipeno tomato sauce and it kicked it up.

This was a delicious recipe.  I followed the recipe as provided, with the exception of marinating the beef about 1 1/2 hours prior to cooking.  I did double the sauce recipe as suggested and found I had some left over.  I don't mind...it's in the fridge!

I loved the tomato flavor in these kabobs.  I didn't cherry tomatoes so I used a large Roma, cut into chunks.  Also set little bit of the sauce aside in a bowl for basting then marinated the kabob meat and veggies for a couple of hours before skewering.  Delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes and is always a big hit. The marinade / sauce is super yummy - you can literally eat it by itself! You will not stop taste-testing :) The first time I made this, I went straight to the grill. The second-time I marinated for 10 hours. Both were excellent. Definitely don't be shy  brushing that sauce on as your grilling! Can't wait to make again!

My husband said too many vegetables, but I think it was just right . We also marinated the meat overnight and I can't imagine it without that, because even with the marinating, the meat was kinda tough.

Excellent recipe!  I used a London broil because it was cheaper.  Meat was marinated overnight.  We like spicy, so will spice it up more for us next time.

Only loosely followed this recipe - simplified ingredients.  Marinating helps tenderize and flavor beef.   Use almost any combo of veggies: peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions are always good

I didn't have any cherry tomatoes, but with the sauce I didn't feel the lack.  Next time I may marinade all the ingredients in the basting sauce for a bit before assembling/cooking.

Loved this sauce. I did not have tomato juice so I used tomato sauce with a bit of water and omited the ketchup and it was great. next time I will double the recipe I wanted more on the rice that was served with the meal.

great recipe! I lined my grill with tin foil before I ever turned it on.  Because you have to pour more sauce on the kabobs mid way, this took care of a lot of the mess and potential flames! My husband loved them!

Loved this recipe. I did chicken as well as beef, and the sauce was wonderful on both. I was concerned with the base being tomato juice, and a comment that the sauce was overpowered with it, but I didn't find that to be true. It a great flavor.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!  I don't think I will ever want to make another kabob- these were so outstanding that we polished off the recipe in no time.  Fortunately, I had quadrupled the sauce so there was plenty left to make another batch.  I chose to marinate the meat overnight in the sauce and it became so tender that I could have been eating filet instead of sirloin.  An awesome winner!!!

Oh my gosh, these are FABULOUS and easy!  I did not have time this AM, so I threw all the sauce ingredients (melted the butter) in a big ziploc, mixed it up quick, and threw my meat in there.  I took the advice of others and marinated for almost 8 hours.  It added so much taste!  I will make these again for sure!  Next time I will try to make the sauce 'properly' so I can have some for basting.  :)  Thanks for this recipe!

Very good! But a little time consuming & messy. I used measurements exactly but subbed: V-8 for tom juice, Chili Sauce for ketchup, Smoked Paprika for regular, & used Chipotle Hot Sauce. Poured enough sauce to cover/marinate beef for 1.5 hrs (would probably be even better marinating for 24 hrs). Cut up veggies, drizzled w/Olive Oil, salt & pepper & tossed w/a little sauce to coat. Grilled about 4-5 mins per side, basting using only about 1/4 cup of sauce (saved the rest for leftovers!). Hubby loved them, he dipped in ranch - but I preferred just as they are. My stepson LOVES bbq sauce so I'll probably just make the sauce to put on about everything! Will make kabobs for only special occasions on a weekend due to time. Might try spicy V-8 & cayenne next time. Had good flavor, a little hint of spice but prefer a little more punch. Great base recipe!!

thank you for making my first kabob dinner a hit! The sauce was so yummy. A nice tanginess blended with a mild richness and a tiny spice.
Everyone at the BBQ raved...will cook again and again.

I'd recommend marinating or seasoning (at least salt + pepper!) the meat ahead of time.  Brushing on the sauce just before grilling didn't add enough flavor for us, and we didn't love the sauce enough to dip the kabob pieces in it.

This recipe is a kepper! I made it today for the first time. I did cut the recipe in half because there are only two of us. Other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and my wife and I loved it. 

Thanks Debbie Tabor.
