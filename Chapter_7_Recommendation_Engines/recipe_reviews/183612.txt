This is amazing! It has so much flavor with so little work and effort. I made it exactly to the recipe, except I didn't broil, just baked it. This is a keeper.

Awesome!  The second time I made this, I used Ken's Light Italian and added a can of diced tomatoes (no salt added) and it was great too!  Be sure to have this with bread to mop up the delicious sauce!  As a side dish, I mafe Lemon Thyme Rice from this site, and fresh green beans.

This was good dish.  I added a chopped tomato and some mushrooms in place of the artichokes since my family does not like them.  I didn't add the breadcrumbs (using panko)until the shrimp was done and then put it in the broiler to brown a little.   Will definately make again.  Thanks!

Lots of flavor with very little effort.  I crisped the topping up by running it under the broiler.

I wouldn't make this again.  VERY artificial tasting.  Maybe I should have made my own dressing?

Just OK - I left the marinade on for an 1 1/2 hours and it overwhelmed the shrimp. I suggest you cook immediately after putting together. Also, the breadcrumbs were mushy. Broiling for a few minutes might have helped.
