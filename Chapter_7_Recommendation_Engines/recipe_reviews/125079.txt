I tried four different flavored popcorn recipes off this site in the last two days and this one turned out the best.  I mixed the sugar and spices with 3T butter in a saucepan, then poured and mixed into homemade popcorn.  Then I spread the mixture onto a cookie sheet and baked at 200 degrees for 10 minutes.  The popcorn had a wonderfully crispy coat.  It was less spicy than expected, but delicious.  To make it extra naughty for gifts, I am drizzling the finished product with white chocolate. Yum.

This is the first recipe I've given a poor rating too.  I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't very good to my husband and I.  I gave it 3 stars only because we didn't spit it out.  The spices didn't go together well for us.  Sorry.

This was yummy. I added a little melted butter. I think that it really helped the spices to stick. A big hit a my house. Thanks for sharing :)

OH MY.....I just can't stop eating this popcorn.  I love popcorn to begin with, so when I saw this recipe, I figured I would give it a shot.  I cooked my popcorn in the pan, then used spray butter (Pam) to coat the popcorn, and put all the spices in a shaker jar and just shook it all over the popcorn!  Scrumptious.  A real different twist on popcorn...thank you for sharing.

Incredible! The mixture of the spice and sweet goes well together for me. I used more cayenne than the recipe calls for, only because I love cayenne pepper. I also sprayed the popcorn while in the bowl, added spice, and then poured some in the bag, and sprayed any pieces that weren't coated with the spice mixture. I kept doing this to help get every piece covered evenly. Love it, thanks Flo!

I was a little skeptical about the mix of spices - especially combining the sweet (sugar/cinnamon), salt, and spicy (pepper/chili) - but in the end, it turned out AMAZINGLY!!!

I enjoyed this recipe. Try using the same spices when making corn as a side dish. I used a bag of microwave popcorn and decided to shake the spices in the microwave bag. Just sprinkle a little in at a time to get the spices more evenly distributed. You can probably omit the salt when using microwave popcorn.

Tastes great as is!  I made a bunch and put it in an empty spice container that way I can just sprinkle it over popcorn without having to make more.

This was really tasty!  I used kettle corn (all i had) but I really liked it with the additional flavor.  Plus i added a dash more cayenne.

I put the spice mix in a shaker, air popped corn in a big bowl and spray mist the popcorn with olive oil then shake the spices over it and repeat - works great and not too decadent a snack for the whole family on movie night! Love the sweet, salty, slight underlying warmth flavor - good on roast nuts too.

Great twist on the classic popcorn.  I took recommendation of adding 3 TBLS of melted butter, and then baking.  AMAZING.

This is a great variation for popcorn.  The whole family loved it!  I had to double it, and I shook it in a paper bag to mix it which worked great.

The combination of the spices on this
popcorn was just wrong. The whole bowl
had to be tossed out and the kids were
so bummed.

Ok...pretty good....I liked the heat behind it.....hubby did not care for the flavors here. I eliminate the butter since we are all watching our weight and used maybe a sprinkling of Stevia sugar substitute. Sweet enough. Think we may enjoy the savory seasongs better. But thanks for an interesting combo of flavors.

I have made this several times.  I use more popcorn than it calls for, but found it addictive.  My son, emailed me for the recipe after having it for Thanksgiving snack food.

I liked the flavor.  The only change I made in the recipe's directions was to melt butter, mix in the spices, and drizzle over the popcorn.

Wow! I am very pleasantly surprised with the burst of flavors. Liked it alot & I like the fact that I can control the fat and salt. Makes a great low-fat snack! I cooked my popcorn in the microwave using only Pam and a little sea salt.

Personally, I like popcorn with a little zip.  I use just enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan.  Then I sprinkle the oil with garlic powder, cajun spice blend, and salt so they about cover 1/2 the pan bottom.  Swirl around to mix.  Pop corn over medium high heat so as not to burn the spices.  You can always adjust the amount of spice and oil according to taste.

My husband and I loved this!  My five-yr-old loved it!  It was kind of addicting; there were quite a bit of spices left in the bottom of the bowl (which sat on the counter all night) and I even made more popcorn in the morning to use up the remainder.  I snacked on it all day.
Which brings me to my one minor issue:  I wish all those spices stuck to the popcorn the first time around (however, that's not the fault of the recipe, really).  I tossed it in a bowl and shook it in a bag, using cooking spray for both.  I'll have to work on my technique next time to get a good even coating.  I also might try using a little more cayenne next time, just enough to give it a little kick.

Delicious!! Followed the recipe exactly, but added more cayenne. After spreading the popcorn mixture on the baking sheet, I lightly sprinkled some more chili pepper for a spicier taste, and baked at 200 degrees for 15 minutes. Came out amazing! Thanks for the great recipe!

We were a little unsure about this at first but WOW was it good!! Everyone enjoyed it so much. My husband actually said he liked this more than regular popcorn. The only thing I changed was I made a double batch and melted about 3 T. butter which I poured over the popped corn and then put on the spices. I used an air popper and made it in 2 batches. Great recipe!!

Yummy, just the right combo of sweet and spicy.  I needed to add a bit more salt.  The only reason why I didn't give this five stars is because alot of the seasonings stuck to the inside of the bag.

I made this as a last minute "dish" to take to a Christmas party!  A lot of people really liked it and wanted to know what was in it so that they could make it.  My husband and I both loved it but our kids (ages 6, 4, and 3) hated it because they only like buttered popcorn.  We had a little left over from the party and it was definitely better the next day. I recommend that you make it the day before and put it in an airtight container so you get the best of all the flavors.  I will be making this for Christmas gifts!

It was okay...it seemed more sweet than spicy. I've had better out of the store bought shakers. If I make this again I'll probably subsitute the chili powder with something else...???

Fantastic! Great recipe for bland, air popped corn.  Instead of the bag method we tossed the corn in an enormous mixing bowl.

This is the best popcorn ever.  I did a double batch (mixing it in a bowl not a bag and using melted butter not spray) and it turned out great.  We took it to a movie night with friends and everyone went crazy over it. I don't know if I can ever go back to regular popcorn.
