I used 16oz. of heavy whipping cream in place of the egg white.  I mixed half the whipped cream into the pie and put the other half on top of the pie...delicious!!

This is an excellent key lime pie, and I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to having it again! I frosted it with Whip Cream Frosting (from allrecipes too) and garnished with fresh lime slices drizzled with key lime pudding. Alone, I think the recipe may have been missing a little flavor, but with the changes I made, this pie is going on the family recipe list! Thanks! :)

It was alright, I recommend using real ingredients rather than the pudding for a quality pie.
