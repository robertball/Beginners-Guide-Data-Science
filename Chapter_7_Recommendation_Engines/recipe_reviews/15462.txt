I recently made this recipe after printing it out from the Neiman Marcus website, and it says to bake the cookies in a 300 degree oven for about 20 minutes (not at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes).  These cookies stayed very moist and chewy much longer than any other chocolate chip cookies I've made, and I think the reason is that they were baked at a lower temperature.

Good, but this is not the real recipe for the Neiman Marcus cookies. You may actually find it in this site under "Urban Legend Chocolate Chip Cookies", there's a cookie to die for!

I'm sure it's a good cookie recipe, but it's NOT the $250 recipe of urban legend. I received a copy of that more than 15 years ago, and it involved many other ingredients, including grated chocolate and, I believe, oatmeal. I'm still looking for a copy of the "scam" recipe that really did make an amazing cookie!

The $250 story is TRUE! My aunt was the one who was charged for it.  However, the true cookie recipe is a bit different.  She bought two salads, a scarf, and asked to buy the recipe. The waitress said she could if she paid "two fifty".  My aunt assumed it meant $2.50.  She called the account office at Neiman Marcus after receiving the bill and they refused to refund her. So, she told them that she was going to have $250 dollars worth of fun with the recipe.  She printed it in our family's cookbook, and gave the recipe out to everyone she could think of and told them to give it out to others. So, there you have it. I assure you that the story is true, but like I said...the real recipe is slightly different.

I also printed the "Original" recipe from the Neiman Marcus website when they had it there briefly and this one IS it!  It's a delicious, wonderful cookie.  It's on the cakie side rather than raw, flat side.  Mine came out fat but great!

Like another reviewer, I followed the 300 degree oven - after comparing this recipe with the NM website. Gorgeous cookies - not too thick or too thin. Photogenic!

Generally I prefer  a chocolate chip cookie with equal measures of brown sugar and granulated sugar; and I particularly don't care for cookies with more brown sugar than white. While they do impart more of a butterscotchy flavor (especially if you use dark brown sugar), they also make the cookie softer, a characteristic more beloved by Hubs than myself.  I guess you could say that's exactly why I tried this recipe - to please Hubs... and curiosity too, I admit.  What a surprise!  And what a way to wake up your taste buds!  Outside of there being too many chocolate chips for my chocolate taste buds anyway, these are quite possibly one of the better chocolate chip cookies I've ever made and, having baked for decades, I've tried many.  First, they are an inviting delight to the eye, just a beautiful cookie.  Not flat (hate that) and not little balls (hate that too).  Just a nice, thicki-ish, hearty looking cookie.  Reach for one and after one bite you're sold.  One hundred percent sold.  You get everything here that's most desired in a chocolate chip cookie - they're crispy, chewy and soft and gooey all at the same time.  They're rich and buttery, and the espresso makes them taste even more chocolaty.  Feel confident to bake these at 375 degrees as directed.  Absolutely no reason to do otherwise.  As for the authenticity of their being the genuine Neiman Marcus cookie?  I don't know.  And I couldn't care less. (Update: Hubs said he'd have preferred these without the espresso)

These are the best cookies ever. If you bake them at the 8 minutes they are chewy. They have a great balance of flavor.

As a Neiman Marcus employee I can vouch that although this is not the recipe you get in the "Neiman Marcus $250 Cookie Recipe" spam email this one is the real deal. These cookies are really good if you like the "super sweet & not homemade" tasting cookies you buy from the grocery store. They aren't my favorite, but I still eat them whenever we have them at work.

ok, so i made the cookies because the ingredients just 'called' to me. my only problem with this page is it seems that almost ALL the recipe reviews were simply people who felt the need to clarify that it apparently isn't the actual Neiman Marcus cookie. like anyone gives a hoot wether its authentic or not, i just wanted to know how the d*mn cookies turned out so i could know what to expect. either way, BANGING cookies. i'll definitely make them again.

Mmm Mmm Mmm! I've finally been able to make these perfect with the right adjustments. Here they are, for future convenience to anyone else wanting to make these cookies just right:  1. Cut down the sugar to about 1/2 cup brown sugar. But kept the same amount of white sugar.  2. Omitted 1/2 cup flour and replaced it with 1/2 cup oatmeal that I ground into a floury consistency in my blender. Then, sifted with the rest of the dry ingredients.  3. Baked at 300 degrees for 20 min for a tastier cookie in general. It may seem like the cookies will be too crispy and crunchy after cooling, but they keep the same texture/consistency the next day. 4. Oh, and of course I threw in many more chocolate chips than required!  Hope this review helped! =)

I doubled this recipe making about 5 dozen cookies.  I took all the cookies to Culinary School and everyone ate them up!  Excellent as is with no modifications.

Excellent cookie.  The espresso makes it.  I chopped up some of my semi sweet choc chips before incorporating and baked at 310 for about 16 minutes.  They turned out really good.

I think I might be able to shed some light on this.  This is the Neiman Marcus Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe.  It is exactly the same recipe that they used to hand out in the store back before the internet was around.  For some reason unbeknownst to me, they've changed the recipe online to have a different baking temperature and time.  They both work.  There is also a Neiman Marcus bar recipe out there.  That one has other ingredients such as coconut and/or pecans, and there seem to be a ton of variations on the recipe.  Not sure if it's really from Neiman Marcus, but maybe that will clear some of the confusion.

This is the most memorable home-made chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted. It is that good.  I did follow a suggestion made by a reviewer to bake the cookies in 300 degrees C.  This recipe is also forgiving, I made a few changes according to what I have at home:  1.) I used whole wheat flour 2.) Used 3/4 cup demerara sugar instead of 1 cup brown  sugar 3.) I increased the vanilla to 1 Tablespoon.  4.) Used 1 Tablespoon of instant coffee since I didn't have espresso coffee powder.  Lastly, since I generally prefer larger cookies, I prepared the dough by 1/4 cup and baked for about 25 min.  The cookies turned out perfectly: just the right chewiness, just the right sweetness with just the right hint of salt and coffee.

My GOD these are addicting! Filled them into a tablespoon for 'portion control'. Yeah right. Instead of eating 1 or 2 cookies I'm eating 1, 2... 6... then you know it's all bad when my mom has to close the lid so I don't eat more. Followed the recipe exactly (except for sugar free choco chips) and with my tablespoon scoops yielded a little over 3 dozen cookies. It's a hit in my family. My dad bit into it and the first thing he said was "mmmmm... mocha!" followed by grabbing a few more. Okay so see a pattern?

These were ok, but I didn't really care for them. The coffee did give it a nice flavor but that was all that I really liked. They puffed up more than I like. I won't make these again.

I don't know if anyone else had a problem with the batter being a little too dry. I had to add a little oil and about an 1/8 cup of water to get it to a workable consistency. I could taste the coffee in the batter but not after the cookies were baked, which I was glad. I baked them at 300 degrees for 12 minutes. They are absolutely delicious. Soft and done perfectly. I have to say, this will be my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. They were on my mind when I woke up this morning...so, I got out of bed, went to the kitchen, grabbed the container with the cookies, and brought them back to bed with me to eat for breakfast. Ahhhhhmazing!

OH my goodness is all I need to say. These are FANTASTIC! I live in Switzerland, and when I am feeling a little homesick, I make chocolate chip cookies (or whenever I need something really yummy!) and today was the first time I made these and they made my heart melt. They are soooo good. A must make and keep recipe!

This is a very good chocolate chip cookie recipe, but yes I am one of those who is after THE BEST recipe & for me this isn't it......that's why i'm giving it 4 stars.  It lacks slightly in flavor.  I used regular butter and reduced the salt (didn't have unsalted butter on hand).

THE REAL Neiman Marcus cooke recipe can only be found IF you got that e-mail a long time ago.  The closest recipe found has a name "Urban Legend Chocolate Chip Cookie" as Neiman Marcus denounces this "legend".  The measurements are different, but over all the same ingredients. They were drier then normal, so I added an egg-3 total-  **&** Use Hershey's chocolate when grading.  NO coffee is in the real Urban Legend.  (*EWw)

Not as good as I expected. The dough was dry and I when I tried to add extra chips they wouldn't adhere to the dough. When cooled they were too hard.

This is by far the best chocolate chip recipe I've made, and I've been baking chocolate chip cookies for at least 40 years.  My family LOVES them, and they keep asking for more!  The only change I've made is leaving out the coffee powder, although someday I'd like to try it with it.  Baking them for 10 minutes at 350 degrees works well for me, as they're still very soft and chewy.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I like the traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe better. These had too much of a coffee taste for my liking.

fyi, this is not the $250 dollar cookie recipe. We order the espresso-chocolate chip cookies from Neimans all the time, and the recipe above is emulating the ones that can be purchased in stores and on their website. The "Neiman Marcus Chocolate Chip Cookie" as it is called, is a very popular cookie and the recipe has been praised by many, however the $250 cookie recipe is hard to find and quite different- it can be found here in NY Times article under the traditional Neimans cookie-  http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/02/garden/the-250-cookie-recipe-exposed.html

I've been making these for years and have yet to find a better chocolate chip cookie. These are perfect just the way they are. I don't always have nuts or chocolate shavings but still delish!! Make sure you get the oatmeal blended as fine as you can.

Delicious!! Just made these and no one can stay away from them long enough to let them cool!! I went a little heavier on the espresso powder, and chocolate chips (personal preference) as well as cook at 300 degrees for 20 min per the NM website. We felt the espresso powder made the cookies (totally enhance the chocolatey flavor. Yum!) I will make regularly!

They taste good but i found the dough dry, and I used 1 1/2 cups of flour not the 1 3/4 cups called for. I also added almond flavoring.

This was a very easy recipe and came out very  nice.  I followed the recipe w/ the exception of baking, I followed a previous review's recommendation and baked at 300 degrees/20 minutes and they came out perfect.  My boyfriend remarked that this is the best cookies he has ever eaten in his life! will definitely make these again.

I followed this recipe to the T. I rolled the dough two different ways: I made one inch balls and left them like that, and the other I made one inch balls but flattened them. I baked both types for 10 minutes. The first one came out a nice soft cookie, and the flattened one came out crunchier. I prefer the crunchier one, but the other is very good too. They don't taste exactly like the Neiman Marcus cookies, which was expected, but they were a little too sweet for me. I'll probably cut down the brown sugar to 3/4 cup instead of a full cup.

They turned out harder and crisper than I expected, and they weren't over-cooked at all.  I've been trying to find the 'perfect' chocolate chip cookie recipe, and this was not it.

I wasn't actually in love with these cookies as much as everyone else here is. I thought they were just average chocolate chip cookies. I couldn't distinctly taste the coffee in mine. I also had to put them back into the oven for an additional 6 or 7 minutes than the recipe stated because they weren't cooked at all. Not bad, but I'd definitely try something else in the future.

I originaly printed the recipe from the Neiman Marcus site in 1997 - it gets raves every time I make it. Try using mini Hershey kisses and use the whole 10oz bag. This is a big decadent cookie and the extra chips make it even more so. Enjoy!

Been looking for a chocolate chip recipe that doesn't go flat when done and this is it. Kept recipe as is-no point reviewing a recipe that I change ingredients on otherwise it becomes a new recipe-and they turned out great. Thought I would rate it so I can say I used a convection bake. It's hard to find recipes that have been made on convection so I thought I'd throw my comments in that I did the recipe converter and reduced heat by 25 degrees and baked for the full 20 minutes. Didn't have to reduce the time they baked for.

I have been making the $250. recipe for about 15 years. It makes quite a large amount and uses 
5 Cps blended oatmeal, along with 4 cps of flour & a hersey bar. You can half the recipe!!!

This is completely different from the one that I received back when I first went on the net in 1999. 

2 cups butter 
4 cups flour 
2 tsp. baking soda 
2 cups granulated sugar 
2 cups brown sugar 
5 cups blended oatmeal (measure oatmeal and blend in blender to a fine powder) 
24 oz. chocolate chips 
1 tsp. salt 
1 8 oz. Hershey bar (grated) 
4 eggs 
2 tsp. baking powder 
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice) 
2 tsp. vanilla 
Cream the butter and both sugars. Add eggs and vanilla; mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking powder, and soda. Add chocolate chips, Hershey bar and nuts. Roll into balls and place two inches apart on a cookie sheet..Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees. Makes 112 cookies.. Have Fun!!!

This is the original recipe that I got back then with the hoax that it was a Neiman Marcus recipe. Either I have made this recipe above a million times and everyone who tries it loves it. It's a huge recipe but it can be halved.

This is an excellent cookie recipe. chewy, delicious, tender, and the coffee flavoring gives an unusual, rich flavor. It IS the recipe on the NM website, but curiously enough, it is NOT the recipe of urban legend. That recipe involves oatmeal, grated chocolate, and makes 114 cookies.  Discrepancies aside, this is a great recipe. I do recommend baking at a lower temperature...the NM website says 300 degrees.

I just had a cookie and it was heaven in my mouth! I followed the 310 temp - I also used golden sugar instead of brown and only 2 tablespoons of white sugar as I used left over halloween candy! I took a small caramilk or snickers etc and wrap it in the cookie dough - so i cut down on the chocolate chips as well. Baked for 15 minutes. Chewy yet crispy. I also added half a tsp of cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe!

These are so good, especially when they are served hot right out of the oven. I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect. I love how they are crispy on the outside, yet soft and chewy on the inside. I got 24 nicely sized cookies out of this recipe. I really liked the addition of espresso powder in the dough it gives the cookies such a unique flavor. Thanks for the great recipe!

These are wonderful! I just made them today and I already can't wait to make them again. I didn't add the espresso powder b/c I didn't have any. They were still great. The recipe on the Neiman Marcus website does say to bake at 300, which is what I did. I'm not sure what baking at 375 does, but I would rather do what the original recipe states. I also used a mix of milk chocolate chips and semisweet chips. I don't think I will be buying the bag mix from the store any more.

I made one change with this recipe and what I did was half the brown sugar and replaced the other half with white sugar because I don't keep a lot of brown sugar on hand. I made these for my husband's lunchbox. He thought these cookies were perfect, he's a pretty much no-frills kind of cookie lover.  375* for eight minutes made a perfect cookie, done just enough to keep them crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I will say that the smell of these about drove me insane. NOTE: I recommend you take these off the cookie sheet right out of the oven. You'll have to be careful but that's better than having the chocolate chips stuck to the cookie sheet.

The first time I made these it was exactly by the recipe.These are a great small batch recipe.Personally I can't always afford good chocolate chips and I can't stand cheap ones. I find that this batter(minus the coffee) holds up well to other add ins...So far,I've tried several different dried fruits,nuts and leftover candy all with great success.

I went off the Neiman Marcus site for the exact recipe and they are by far the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted. The cooking time is 300 degrees for 20 min as per the site and they turned out perfect!!! I used cocoa powder instead of expresso, fabulous!

I am upgrading my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Having baked these a bunch and following the advice of several, I followed the recipe as directed (still can't find instant espresso!) except I baked for 14 mins at 300.  Yes, I know that is not what the recipe calls for and therefore should not change my rating blah blah blah.  Great recipe - adjust the time and temp and this will impress any cookie lover.  The following is my original review:  This is a very good cookie.  I could not find instant espresso in my supermarket so I used instant coffee.  I will make these for Christmas and use espresso and also cook at 300 for 20 mins.  If it tastes better as a result, I will update to  5 stars.    Regardless - these are very good.

This is a great cookie!! The expresso powder gives it a wonderful flavor. 
Love it! Chewy on the inside and crisp on the out. It was a bit hard to tell when they were done, I think they baked for 12 minutes at 350. Thanks!

I used instant coffee too and it worked fine, you just have to grind the granules through the seive when sifting and they turn into powder.  Yummy!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe, and makes a great "base" cookie dough.  The coffee gives it a more "adult" taste, so sometimes I omit it if they are being made for kids.  Mine come out with a wonderful crakle-top, crisp on the outside and dense and chewy on the inside!  I use a mixture of 1/2 choc chips and 1/2 chopped toffee (like skor or heath bars) and they are just Out of this World!  The toffee chips add a lot to the flavor, giving it a deeper buttery flavor and enhancing the brown sugar in this recipe.  Just great!

This is absolutely THE Neiman Marcus cookie recipe. My family begs me to make them as well as my children's teachers!
Instead of espresso powder I use instant coffee (I think I have Tasters Choice).  When I first found the NM recipe it called for instant coffee.  I think espresso powder sounds more hip!
You can't go wrong with this one.  Just make sure to cream your butter and sugars very well.

I have rated this cookie before but the review before this one made me laugh. This is the EXACT recipe for the Neiman Marcus recipe. You can even check yourself. I thought this was funny that they said the other recipe was better! Anyhow - this cookie is AWESOME no matter where you get the recipe.

I brought it to a party(with adults and teens) and everyone loved it.  I also added chopped walnuts and it tasted really good.  I added another teaspoon of coffee in my second batch b/c I couldn't really taste the coffee. Also, my cookies weren't dry at all.  They were very moist and chewy on the inside.

I really like this recipe.  It IS in the Neiman Marcus website, but it is not the one sent around with the hoax email about the $250, which contains blended oats, not instant coffee.  I've tried making this once with dark brown molasses sugar (from Trader Joe's) and did not thoroughly soften butter before mixing with the sugars and the dough came out dryer than usual and the cookie was a bit tougher and not as chewy.  I recommend using light brown sugar and they come out fantastic!  One of my favorites!

Great cookie! I made them a lot smaller than suggested at  just one tablespoon per cookie using a small ice cream scoop and got 6 dozen cookies. Great taste with the instant espresso power, and I flatened the cookie with a Fork dipped in more of the instant espresso to give them a slightly different look.  As suggested by another reviewer, I substituted 3/4 of a cup of the flour with a cup of rolled oats that I chopped to a fine powder in a food processor, just to give the cookies a but more substance.

I've tried a lot of chocolate chip cookie recipes and this one is the best.  I chilled them in the fridge for an hour as I do with all cookies.  These cookies don't spread too much and keep their perfect shape.  I baked them at 300 degrees for 20 minutes and they came out perfectly soft with a chewy edge.  The coffee is notable and gives a depth of flavor.  I'll leave out the coffee when making for kids.  Delicious recipe and this is my new go to chocolate chip cookie recipe!!!!!

I love this cookies. I tweaked the recipe a little bit such as lower the white sugar to 2 tbs, 50% walnuts 50% chocolate chips,  lower the temperature to 300 F, lower the cooking time to 20 minutes. The result was amazing, thick,  soft and nutty.. just the way we like it ! Next time I will add a little bit more of espresso.

I like this recipe.  I can't vouch for what story is right or which recipe is the original, but I can tell you I got my recipe 45 years ago (still have the original copy given to me) and it does not use oatmeal flour.  It is exactly the one listed above.

The NM cookie recipe (which I've been baking for the past couple of years) can't tie the shoes of this recipe!!! This recipe is AMAZING. Add a dash of extra espresso powder. My oven had to bake for 15 min at 375.  Used a medium sized ice cream scoop so they were thick. Crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside. HELLLLLOOOO! This is my NEW choc chip cookie recipe.

Excellent recipe! I added 1/4 cup fiber & 3/4 cup protein powder to the recipe. Along with those mods, I decreased the butter to 1/4 cup & added 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce all in an effort to make them a little healthier. These cookies are great! I needed to bake them about 2 min longer because at 10 min, the center was still a little gooey. These are a keeper folks!

This was a perfect recipe! It says to use 'melted butter,' and I did use melted margarine on the batch. When I baked the 1st 6 cookies (i was only able to make 12) they ran and were thin. Well, I refridgerated the rest of the dough and those turned out PERFECT!

A good cookie - I enjoyed the hint of coffee and the little flecks of the powder that appeared in the cookies! Not a novice baker, I was surprised that I ended up with relatively flat cookies that did not resemble several of the other photos posted. Even chilling the dough did not seem to make a difference. They puffed up in the oven and then fell flat, except for the mounds of chocolate =) Still, taste good...not in a rush to make again, as I have some wonderful chewy chocolate cookie recipes on file already, but it's always fun to change it up and try something new!

Despite what many reviewers seem to be saying, this IS the original Neiman Marcus recipe. Just go to their website to see for yourself. There seem to be many impostors out there! This is one delicious cookie.

This was absolutely delicious! I substituted half the choc chips with white choc chips but it was still amazing. Kind of like the subway cookies but better

This is a fairly decent cookie.  I did like the crisp outside with the tender middle.  The flavor was good.  However, I and others consider myself to be a master cookie baker and have a cookie recipe that runs circles around this one.  Though an enjoyable cookie, it will not send you swooning or make you hum.

Very good cookies. The coffe gave it sort of a butterscotch taste. You can bake tese just according to taste, a bit longer gives a crunchy cookie, shorter gives a chewy one. both good. I did bake at 300F for about 25-30 minutes tho.

This is a great tasting cookie! When cooled they were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I only omitted the espresso powder (didn't have any)and added 3/4 cup of chopped pecans and was still very happy with the results. Of all the chocolate chip cookie recipes I've tried these came out the most attractive. With other recipes (Tollhouse for ex.) I've baked, my cookies always spread out flat on the cookie sheet probably due to flawed proportions of the basic ingredients (flour, butter, sugars). Also I followed the advice of another reviewer and turned down my oven.  I baked these at 325 degrees.

Delicious! My husband insisted I give this recipe 5 stars - which I'm completely in agreement with. I omitted the espresso, however, for my own taste and used chopped chocolate instead of chips which aren't so easy to find in Denmark. Thank you!

I love these cookies! I took the idea of adding the crushed espresso (I use instant coffee) and add it to other cookies as well. Very Good. A previous review said that you have to eat them in three days as the texture changes....Yours last 3 days? I am lucky if any are left the second day!

Added a little oatmeal, and with vanilla a little butter flavoring, nice and fluffy and sweet! Made severa variations of it in the past.

I make these cookies over and over and they are a huge hit every time. I add a very high cocoa content bar of chocolate to them so they aren’t as sweet as traditional chocolate chip cookies so far nobody has complained!

I liked this recipe but the cookies came out a little hard and lacked something. I doubled the espresso powder but next time I am going to stick with the recipe amount. I will lower the temp to 300 degrees as per some other recommendations. I think I will stick with only semisweet chips. Maybe a little more salt or something would be good (extra vanilla?)

Delicious flavor and the ground oats make a light cookie. They don't spread much, so I press the spoonfuls down a tiny bit.

This is my favorite go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I love the addition of espresso powder.  And with the use of both baking powder and baking soda, the cookie does not spread much or get cakey.  I like to grind some flax seed, chia seed to hide in the batter.  Adding some heath bar chips or oats(whole or ground) is nice too.

Heathers earlier post is correct, this is NOT the original version. I have not made it in years but the truly origonal delicious version is made with powdered oatmeal, grated chocolate and definately no espresso. These were just okay to me.

My husband says these cookies are very good!  Loaded with chocolate chips and even the cookie part is good!  I didn't get to taste them as I gave up sweets for Lent, so I have to go on his testimony.

These were incredible. I will say that we didn't have espresso powder, so I left that out, and I didn't add quite as many chocolate chips. But they were so delicious and I'm sure they would be either way.

Fantastic cookie! Soft & chewy on the inside with crisp edges. Held their shape but not cake like at all. I didn't have the espresso powder but they were still great. Since i usually have to add a little extra fluid to my baked goods because of the extremely low humidity where I live I'm thinking  next time I'll try orange juice instead of water.  Or maybe use cold coffee. Authentic recipe or not these are now my go to recipe.

I've made the original for 20 years, they do call for grounded oats and shaved chocolate. I use dark brown sugar, and I make my dough the day before baking. Letting them rest in the refrigerator for 24 hours really marries the flavored.

So good! I really don't care if it's the "authentic" version because they taste amazing. Definitely cool on a wire rack if you have one, it makes sure the cookies are chewy and not too crunchy. Unless you like that. I don't judge.

The change I made was I added 1 1/2 tsp of reg. coffee (community coffee, dark roast) and baked the cookies at 300 degrees for twenty mins. But I remember when I first acquired this recipe there was oats in it that were pulverized in a blender  but  whatever,  awesome cookies.

When it comes down to it, it doesn't matter if this is the REAL recipe or not. This is an amazing cookie! Especially if you bake them @ the 300 degrees for 18-20 minutes. Come out just perfect. I also use a dash of cream of tartar with any cookie I bake. It makes the dough form a 'shell' around itself as it bakes and makes the 'perfect from the bakery' texture everyone strives so hard to get. Little trick I learned through the years (and the grapevine of many a baker hehe)

loved the addition of the espresso powder. I am thankful to the reviewers that mentioned to bake @300 for 20 minutes. These have a wonderful flavor but I can see where they will not stay soft but just tossed a slice of bread in the container to keep them soft. This is a great dough to work with. I got 2 dozen cookies with the large size pampered chef cookie scoop.

Always good, these are cookies I've been making for 20+ years.  I'd suggest adding 5 cups of oatmeal that is then powdered in a blender in lieu of 3 cups of flour. This gives the cookies a chewy texture.

So okay, I had to try these just because of the name, I thought it was strange that Neiman Marcus had their own cookie and I thought for being such an upscale store, they must be great, but these were only okay.  I prefer a fulffy cookie, these were really flat.  I couldn't really taste the espresso, maybe a little more (around 1/2tsp) should be added.  Also the low temp cooking and the long time in the oven was annoying.  I won't make again.

i liked these a lot, the taste is great.  i thought the texture was a little too crunchy though.  I might try it again, but not bake them as long.  maybe they will be a little softet.

Delish!! My family loved them. Dough was a bit dry and crumbly but when baked they were perfect! I found the instant expresso coffee powder at The Anderson's store.

These were the best homemade chocolate chip cookies that I have ever tasted! They were so moist and the instant coffee gave them a great twist. I will definitely be making these quite often.

I really liked the flavor in these. I used chopped chocolate bars for the chocolate and they were probably the best choc chip cookies I've ever made. They did get hard after a day or so, but the flavor was great!

Every time I make these cookies, someone asks for the receipe!  I have made a couple of adjustments --increase the espresso powder to a full tablespoon and use bittersweet chocolate chips.  Also, sometimes I pulverise one packet of plain instant oatmeal and decrease the flour by 1/4 cup.  Dried cranberries are also a delicious addition.

Although this is a very good cookie, this is not the original Neiman Marcus Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe. A lady bought the redipe in the restaurant and because they charged her $250 she sent the recipe all over the world!   The origanal recipe calls for 2 cups of old fashioned oats that you put in the blender and make flour.  I always make it with the oatmeal.

I don't know about all that Neimun Marcus stuff sounds like a friend of a friend kinda story! What I do know is this cookie is great just how it was. I didn't substitute, tweak or change anything...just YUMMMMMMMM the kids occasionally leave me one :-)

I've never been a very good cookie baker UNTIL now.  This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  I could no believe the results.  The only change I made was that I did not have chocolate chips...go figure...BUT I had a huge bag of dark chocolate, plain M&M's and these were an absolute hit!  Thank you for this recipe.  I can't wait to make these cookies for my nieces and nephews.

This is a very good recipe, however, the infamous $250 recipe does have different ingredients, and one of them is the KEY.  It's the oatmeal that you put in the food processor and make into flour that makes the cookies GREAT! Oatmeal hold moisture just like it does in lotions, soaps, etc. I don't care if their named after a store or not, but these are still good when you don't want the extra work of the other recipe with the oatmeal flour.

Not the Neiman Marcus cookie, but with a slight stray from the recipe it was quite a hit.  The batter was all crumbly and dry so I added about 2 tbsp of Bailey's Irish Cream and the batter came together great.  They got eaten by all my guests and I loved them too!

These were wonderful.  They were soft and chewy, while the edges had a light crunch. They held their shape and didn't flatten out.  I can't stand a dry, cakey cookie, so my husband and I were appy with this recipe. And there isn't much to the recipe...very simple when you're in a cookie crunch.

I've never had this problem with chocolate chip cookies before, but the batter just wouldn't hold together. Once baked, the cookies were crumbly. This could be user error and my family still enjoyed them, but I wasn't thrilled.

Instead of the vanilla I put in 2 TABLEspoons of Kahlua, as well as subbed whole wheat flour for the all purpose. The results were a dense and chewy cookie with great flavor. Not a whole lot else to say about these cookies...delicious sums it up!

More adult than your average chocolate chip cookie.  My husband and I love java flavored anything so I add extra instant coffee.  And it's easier than the scam recipe.

I love making cookies & my husband loves to eat them.  This happens to be the fluffies and best tasting chocolate chip cookie we have had.  Everyone loves them.  I dont' like coffee flavors therefore I don't use the espresso powder.  I have also varied it with white chocolate chips or milk.

These cookies were okay. When they came out of the oven, they were moist and I could definetly taste the coffee, but it also made the cookies a little bitter. Maybe it was my coffee powder (didn't have any expresso powder). My grandfather who loves sweets (he buys chewy chips ahoy cookies whenever he can), only ate one of the cookies. I made them two weeks ago and there are still a few left.

This recipe was ok, maybe it's because of the coffee I used.  Either way, I doubt I'd make it again, I'll just stick to buying their cookies from the store.

A very crunchy cookie.  I added walnuts and used chocolate chunks instead of chips.  Also made this with macadamia nuts, and those turned out very yummy.

Wonderful flavor and texture.  Couldn't find espresso coffee powder so took the advice of another reviewer to grind up instant coffee granules.  This worked fine as a substitute.  I'm sure I'll be making this recipe again and again.

This recipe was GREAT!!  I used Maxwell house instant coffee and ground it to powder in a mortal and pestal instead of using the instant espresso powder.  
I was a little nervous at first because the dough was very crumby.  But, I took a heaping tablespoon and rolled it into a ball and the cookies were great.  My neighbors, friends and husband said, "these are so good you could sell them."  

I used a convection oven and cooked a set of 12 for 6 minutes.  The recipe only yields 14 cookies, so double up...they go fast.

The best chocolate chip cookie I've ever made!! I added Hazelnut Belgium instant coffee and some white chocolate chips and they were great. They make a thick cookie so if you want them a little thinner it might help to press them out some.

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!!!!I think these are the best chocolate chip cookies ever.  My husband and his friends agree.  They don't even get time to cool at my house.

We loved this recipe!  I substituted instant hazelnut cappuccino powder for the instant espresso powder and it was fabulous!

Although the cookie didn't brown the way I prefer, it was quite good. I was tempted to over bake. I used 1 cup of butterscotch chips w/ the chocolate chips.
