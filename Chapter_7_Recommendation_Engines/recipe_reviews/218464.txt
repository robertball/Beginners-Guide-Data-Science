I took a stock class at the local college. Before boiling the bones roast them until they are a deep dark brown. Then simmer with veggies. A very LOW simmer. Bubbles barely break the surface. Time consuming but worth it. In a pinch there are a couple of new "bold stocks" in a box that work very well.

This is a bit time consuming, but the results are very much worth the wait. I didn't discard the veggies, though. They had way too much flavour left in them. I pur√©ed them in my blender, and made a cream of veggie soup that we had the next day. It was awsome! Thanks for this wonderful (and wonderfully flavored) recipe. This is definately a keeper!

In my quest for the perfect onion soup, I came across this recipe. I am sorry to say that it just did not work for us. It is far removed from the classic french onion soup that we all think of. It was time consuming, which I can handle if the rewards and effort pay off. I think that the parsnips were too strong in the stock. I was attracted to this because it sounded so healthy with all the veggies. The color was lacking even though I browned the beef first. I think that some amount of red wine is vital to rceipe or it is just not french onion soup.
I will continue on my quest but do thank you for you spuring me on and for a good stock for vegetable soup.

I have made French Onion Soup many times using a different recipe.  This is not only very tasty (my husband went gushy over it} but easier.  Start the process of making broth one day and finish soup the next and it will seem quite easy.  The taste is in the broth and it is divine!

I made the beef stock from leftover prime rib bone which I made from an Allrecipes dish as well (Christmas Prime Rib - very good). The stock turned out very rich and flavourful; so the soup was excellent. The key is the stock. I did not add parsnips as I don't have them on hand and they seemed weird for stock. I also used Asiago, cheddar and mozzarella cheese which is what I had on hand. Pretty good alternatives too! My family sopped up the soup with Sweet Dinner rolls I made this morning - also from Allrecipes - very good and easy with a bread machine.

The recipe is time consuming but worth it! 
I roasted the beef bones and vegetables for 1 hour, then placed it in my crock pot with 8 cups of water on low for 8 hours.
I had 6 cups of stock after sieving it, I adjusted the recipe to 6 servings.
I omitted the thyme and wine as I am not a fan.
Sauteeing the onions for longer is better, I let them cook on low for almost an hour.
I deglazed the pan after sauteing the onions and flour with the sherry and 1 cup of water.
I added more water after it cooked through as it was too thick, I would halve the flour next time.
This made 4 large bowls of soup that we enjoyed on a snowy and blustery night.

Need a really good beef stock recipe.  Today at the store I started reading labels on all the liquid and other kinds of stock and broth, they all contain among other things, lots of sugar, if not the first ingredient it is in the top. I don't like my beef or chicken dishes sweet unless I want them to be.  Could not find a single one without some form of sugar or sweetener.  I found it incredible.  How do diabetics manage to avoid sugar when it is in so many products?  Thank you for the recipe.

With my own beef stock from roasted marrow bones, this was so well worth the time and effort. My family loved it and so did I. The leftovers were just great and we're keeping this in our file for a future dinner.
