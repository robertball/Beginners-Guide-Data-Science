So quick and so easy! I used a few heavy dashes cayenne pepper instead of the chipotle. Spicy and delicious!

This soup is sooo good, and it's even better the next day, when the flavors have REALLY merged! It is also quick and easy, my favorite kind!

Fun to make, took some doing to get the grit out of the corn, but nice, cold soup.

Absolutely delish!  I did add the cilantro which was optional. I blended in an eighth cup and used the remaining eighth for garnish. Also, my girlfriend doesnâ€™t like chipotle, so I substituted that with cayenne, which added a nice little kick. Going in our favorites!

I liked this a lot, but my family was not impressed.  The buttermilk flavor is pretty strong and they are not fans.

I added some plain Greek yogurt and some crumbled bacon to this for the protein and ate the leftovers  from last night for lunch today.  DELICIOUS!  The addition of yogurt and bacon makes this a five star recipe.

CHANGES: Used Almond Milk instead of buttermilk, increased spices except reduced chipotle powder, added fresh pepper, reduced water a bit, and did not strain it. You only need 3 good sized ears of corn to get 3 cups of kernels, not 6 ears like it says. With those changes, we really enjoyed this. I used fresh sweet corn I cooked then cut off the cob. This was light, healthy, and refreshing. It also is a perfect consistency to use as a dip. We will save it to our faves and make this again for sure. Perfect for hot summer days when you don't want to cook.
