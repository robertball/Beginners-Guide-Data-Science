Have made this recipe numerous times and am finally getting around to rating it.  It's my go-to recipe for when I need something sweet yet substantial in my menu, or want to give a from-the-kitchen thank you gift that's a little more sophisticated than cookies (these pecans look really pretty in a nice cellophane or sheer fabric bag tied with ribbon or raffia).  I tripled the recipe and served them in foil cupcake liners at my daughter's birthday party and both the adults and kids gobbled them up.  The spices are great as written, but I like to add a few dashes of chili powder or cayenne to lend a little spice.  I line my baking pans with nonstick foil, bake them at 325, stir every 7 minutes or so, and watch carefully as sugared nuts can go from happily baking to unhappily burning in a nanosecond.  I can't remember if the recipe directs it or not, but I recommend pulling the foil (with the nuts on) off the pan and letting the nuts cool on the foil on the countertop for 5-10 minutes before gently stirring to loosen and removing from the foil.  All in all, this has been a terrific standby recipe that was the first one I thought of to put in my AR recipe box.

These are GREAT!!!  Only recommendation is that you bake these at a much lower temp and turn them very frequently.  I did mine at 300, and used a spatula to turn them about every 8 - 10 min, as they will burn quickly w/ the sugar in them.

Great recipe!  I have actually modified it a bit after several tries.  I use two egg whites and omit the cloves.  I also double up, at least, on the cinnamon.  Then I stir them every 10 minutes while they are baking.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are great! Flavor is amazing. I also found that if you beat the egg white to stiff peaks, it'll coat the pecans better. Try adding 1/2 tsp of ground chili pepper to the spice mix for a sweet n' spicy treat! I couldn't stop eating them!

Just made these as a snack, and yummy!  I used brown sugar instead of white becuase I like the mollassis flavor, and added 1/4 tsp cayenne for alittle kick.  I would probalby cut back on the cloves or leave them out alltogether.  I like cloves, but not so sure I care for them in this recipe.  I also dropped my oven temp to 300 and stirred every 5 minutes or so.  Were in oven a little over 20 minutes total.  AND I used a Pampered Chef stone so I didn't have to deal with foil or parchment paper.  Made stirring easy.  Overall though, very good.

Wow these are really great!  I did make a few changes however after going through about 40 reviews.  They are as follows:  Used 1 tablespoon of vanilla in lieu of the water.  Used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Reduced ground cloves to 1/8 teaspoon and used 1/4 teaspoon plus a tad more of cayenne pepper.  I used recommended amounts for the egg white, pecans, salt, cinnamon & nutmeg.  I baked on 300 for 30 minutes checking about every 5 minutes and stirred about 4 times throughout process.  I also used parchment paper instead of foil.  Total winner!!!  Husband loves them too ~~

YUM!  These are a great snack all year round.  I actually love to put these in a salad with baby spinach, dried cranberries, crumbled blue cheese, sliced pears, and balsamic vinigrette.  REALLY great!
I think next time I make them I might try adding some chili powder to the mix for a great spicy/sweet flavor.
Only thing I would recommend is to spray the foil with non-stick spray.  As I was stirring them during baking I noticed they were sticking pretty bad.

Perfect recipe! I make a big batch of these and keep them in a pretty jar on the counter to have on hand for salads. Our favorite is grilled chicken salad with these peacns and raspberry vinagarette. Superb! Even my hubby who hates pecans and raspberries lives off of this stuff. Try em' you'll love em! I did reduce my oven temp to 325 and kept my eye on them at all times...they are worth the extra care in babysitting the stove! Thanks Pat...this is a winner!!!!

This recipe is the BEST!  I've used walnuts as well, with similar success . . . and the most wonderful aroma fills your home as a result -- which is especially nice over the holidays!

I was short on sugar, so use half white sugar, half brown sugar and they still turned out great.

I've been making this same recipe (with a few exception listed below) for years and people just go crazy over them. What's great is that they're so easy and quick to make!

The exceptions: 1) add 1/4 tsp + a pinch more ground cayenne pepper; 2) use Silpat mats to line my cookie sheets - nothing sticks to those babies; 3) bake at 300 degrees for 30 mins.

Note about sugar substitutes: I've tried substituting fructose and splenda (for baking) for the 1/2 cup sugar and they DO NOT work! The time I used granulated fructose they were just awful and actually tasted burnt. The time I used splenda for baking they just tasted like all the other spices with no sweetness at all. Stick with good old granulated white sugar!

Been making these for years and my secret ingredient (instead of cloves) is cardamom.  It's a heavenly spice (very pricey but lasts forever). Just substitute ground cardamom for the cloves. You'll have a winner!

Took the advice of others (one of the reasons this is my go-to food site), and used cardamom instead of cloves, doubled the egg and added .5 more cinnamon and 1t cayenne, baked at 300 f for about 1 hour, turning every 10.  They turned out amazing.  I used a mix of cashews, pecans, walnuts and almonds, and was able to add about 1 - 1.5 cups more nuts: deluxe mix!  Not too sweet, and a great balance of spice and nut.  The cardamom smells overpowering while cooking, but the taste is great once the nuts have cooled.  Some easy hints to make these gems last: let cool completely before storing, store in freezer for long life.  Truly gift-worthy.

Yummy!   I had a difficult time and burned the first batch despite many stirrings.   Baked additional batches at 250 for an hour and they came out perfect!   These are on their way to Afghanistan to our son in the Army.

Add the spices directly to the egg mixture before coating the pecans.  Bake at 250 degrees for 1 hr instead of the higher temperature to set the coating but not overbake the pecans.  Stir at 15 minute intervals.

For many years we have gone to our best friends home for a Christmas eve celebration. The coated pecans were always one of my favorites. Every year I'd say how much I liked them, and every year my friend would say " I'll give you the recipe, they are sooo easy"  Every year she would laughingly "forget", Haha ! Well I decided to try to find a similar recipe to make at home. This is my favorite ! I did try a couple others but this is the best one. BTW, my pecans are waaay better than hers, proving she who laughs last, laughs BEST ! I took another reviewers suggestion and do the "one bowl" method. Thanks so much for sharing Pat !

Delicious and a little bit addictive!!!  The recipe doesn't state how long to beat the eggs but in a similar recipe I've used, it directed me to beat until very frothy which is what I always do now.  It coats the pecans very nicely.  I omitted all the spices except cinnamon as I just wanted cinnamon sugared pecans.  I toss the egg coated pecans with the seasonings in a large bowl to make sure everything is nicely coated.  These make excellent gifts or something nice to sit on the buffet table.  Watch the pecans as they can begin to burn quickly.  I bake on a sheet lined with foil with nonstick spray and toss them in the middle of the cooking so they brown evenly.

This was an easy snack that everybody loves!! If the nuts have too much egg white on them it does make a little sticky while baking, so either add extra nuts or don't use all the egg white mixture. I also added a little extra sugar to the mixture. A little brown sugar and nutmeg works well and tastes great! Watch closely so they don't burn.

I made these pecans for holiday gifts last year and they were such a big hit, I plan on doing it again this year. After the nuts cooled, I poured them into decorative bags and mixed them with M&Ms to make them look more festive.  I find that the cloves are a bit too strong a flavor for my taste. Instead of cloves, I use allspice which has some of the flavor of cloves, but isn't as intense.  Also, I know it already says this in the recipe, but it cannot be overstated: Don't let the nuts burn! I recommended turning them 3 or 4 times (instead of 1 or 2).  My mom makes a diabetic-friendly version of this recipe where she uses Splenda instead of white sugar. It's not quite as tasty, but is still pretty good.

Excellent results with the suggestions made previously.  I used vanilla extract instead of water, doubled the cinnamon, substituted allspice and cardamom for the cloves and nutmeg, and used 1/4 cup of white sugar and 6 Tablespoons of brown sugar.  I'm a fanatic about always using parchment paper for all of my baking, but it didn't work well in this application.  Next time I'll just use PAM.

I got this recipe from Taste of Home magazine many years ago and make them every year.  They always come out perfect and are a big hit with everyone.  I was asked to put this in a recipe book that we made at work to sell as a fund raiser for our Christmas families.  Store them in an airtight container and they'll last for a long time.

After reading many of the reviews, I made one change in the list of ingredients. Instead of 1 T. water, I substituted 1 t. vanilla. I made a few changes in the directions, resulting in perfect spiced pecans (no burning). Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Lightly grease a 10 x 15-inch jellyroll pan. In medium to large bowl, beat the egg white with vanilla until frothy but not stiff. Add the nuts, and stir until well coated. In a small bowl, mix the sugar, salt, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, and sprinkle over the nuts. Toss to coat, and spread evenly on the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, stirring 2 or 3 times. Remove from oven and separate nuts with a fork if desired. Allow to cool, then store nuts in airtight containers. Yum!

These are awesome!  I found that the one egg was enough to coat 4 cups of pecans.  I used Splenda in place of sugar since we have diabetics in the family, didn't add salt due to my mom being on a salt free diet indefinitely.  I increased the cinnamon to 1-1/2 teaspoons.  After reading other reviews about the oven temperature being too hot, the first batch I baked at 300 which was still too hot (my oven does tend to run a bit hot).  The second batch I baked at 250 and they turned out fine.  Of course that increases the cooking time.  I scooped them into gift bags for Christmas and people couldn't wait to try them, got raves from everyone!  Rated at four stars since I did change the recipe by using Splenda and increasing the cinnamon.  It does have a five star taste!

Swapped nutmeg for ginger & cardamom and used half white sugar, half brown sugar.  Also subbed 1 cup of pecans for walnuts.  Took to my in-laws for Thanksgiving.

This are fantastic! I read some of the other reviews and decided to add another tsp. of cinnamon, just because I love it, but left all of the other ingredients alone. Was also concerned because alot of people said the nuts burn easily, so I baked them at 275 degrees for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, and they turned out perfectly! I think 300 degrees probably would've been alright, too, so I'm not sure why others had problems with the nuts burning. Definately a keeper recipe!

Very good.  Used a mixture of almonds, pecans, and walnuts.  Doubled the cinnamon, halved the cloves, and added 1/4 tsp ground ginger and 1 tsp vanilla.  Probably will mix spices into egg wash next time to ensure more even coverage.  Baked 20 min at 300 degrees, stirring every 5 min.

I doubled the sugar and eggs, just because I like lots of coating!  I omitted the cloves at the suggestion of others.  These are the best and easiest I have made, and will be making them again for the holidays!

These are addictive!  Be sure to check sooner than the time listed - ovens are very different!  We lowered the temp to 325 and the pecans are usually done in less than 25-30 minutes.

I use this recipe all the time, it is a really big hit whenever I do it. I have made it as written, and also have added a touch of allspice. The one big change I made is that I put everything into a big ziplock freezer bag and use that to get a nice even coating on everything. Works like a charm and is much less messy.

Delish! Changed recipe according to my taste and oven temp. Used cardamom (instead of clove), used just a pinch of nutmeg as I feel it can highjack the flavor profile of an entire dish if not careful,  and added cayenne.Baked at 300 for 20 minutes. Mixed 2 cups pecans to 1 cup cashews. Also used reviewers advice of turning the nuts every 5 minutes.  Very addictive, will be a go-to snack for parties and hostess gifts. Great recipe, thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe - thanks so much, and thanks also to the reviewers who suggested adding a bit of cayenne. I'm having a big dessert party in a few days, and thought these would be a nice addition. I baked them for 40 minutes at 300F, on parchment paper and stirred them every five minutes with a heatproof spatula. They didn't stick together at all. The 1/4 tsp cayenne adds a slightly spicy aftertaste. They are perfect.

I reduced the temp to 325 and at 25 minutes they were almost burned.  Make sure to break them up as they are cooling or they will harden into one massive clump. I was worried about the clove and nutmeg being too much so I reduced them to just an 1/8th teaspoons, but that was too much cause I couldn't taste it all. These are easy to do but I like spiced nuts with a little more zing, like some heat from cayenne.

I too have made this recipe many times, and it is now a Christmas staple for Christmas Eve, and Holiday cocktail parties. I double the recipe simply because they are so good, and go so fast. I agree with the other people. I cook them at 325 and stir frequently. Very classic and classy snack for your Holiday parties...Winner each time!!!

This was delicious! I served them in a mixed greens salad, with pear, feta, and a homemade vinegarette. It was delicious. And now we can't stop eating the leftover pecans. Next Christmas I am going to make these and give them out as presents.

Yum,  I didn't have any cloves so I substituted allspice - really excellent.   This will be a staple for holiday meals  - I have to say I think the allspice was an excellent addition.  Next time Ill try some cayanne as well.  Thanks for such a great recipe

I was eager to try this recipe because of all the great reviews. I'm sure it probably tastes fantastic if your oven doesn't burn it! I guess my oven must run hot, because my poor pecans came out burnt after 20 minutes. I should have pulled them out after my first stirring at 15 minutes. Only giving it three stars as I just feel it really should be mentioned to check on the nuts FREQUENTLY since ovens can vary so much. Really sad I didn't keep a closer eye on them. I'll try it again, but this time check it every 5 minutes, and probably yank it out at 15 minutes. Bummed because pecan halves cost and arm and a leg where I live.

I'm sure this is a delicious recipe if done right.  Unfortunately, I must have goofed. I used pecan pieces instead of halves, because that's what I had, and followed the recipe exactly, even shaving 5 minutes off the time. My nuts burned and stuck to the foil - what a disappointment!  I will try it again, but this time use parchment paper & maybe even a light cooking spray. I'll also experiment with lower temps and check frequently after 15 minutes. And I won't leave the kitchen and trust my husband to listen for the timer! :)

I just finished a trial batch of these and they are very good, even though I forgot the salt. The egg mixture will coat more than 3 cups of nuts. I added a 1/2 tsp cayenne, and only a dash of cloves. In the oven for about 40 minutes at 250. Now if I can keep my hands off them..

Very tasty but had trouble with them burning - twice.  I watched them carefully and even shortened the timing more the second time around but some still burned. May try lowering the oven temperature next time.

This didn't work for me and I ruined 3 cups of nice pecans!  They totally burned after 10 minutes.  I can't imagine cooking them for 30 minutes unless the temperature was 300 degrees.  I live at 5000+ ft.  Maybe that was the problem.  I think they would have tasted good if they weren't burned.

I make this recipe every year and give out as Christmas gifts. Last year I gave gift cards, etc instead and they were all looking for pecans and other goodies I make for gifts as well. Guess pecans and homemade goodies rule in my house. No more gift cards. So easy to make and share - it's a shame not to. DELICIOUS!

This is the best recipe! I gave these as Christmas gifts this year. I instructed everyone to open them early because I thought they might go stale be Christmas. By the time everybody got them, it was 1 or 2 weeks after I made them. Everyone told me they were wonderful and they tasted fresh and crunched like I had just made them yesterday. I doubled the cinnamon but I think it use more. Yum!!!

Wow, these are awesome! I followed the other reviewers' advice: 300 degree oven, added a bit of cayenne pepper, went light on the cloves since my husband dislikes that spice... couldn't get over how good they were; just what I had in mind. yummy!

I made these for Christmas gifts last year, and they got rave reviews. My husband didn't want me to give away as many of them as I did. This year, I'll be making them again. I like the idea of having a signature item that people associate with Christmas. They're simple enough to make, but they make a big impression!

super easy and very tasty-however I would make them again with the reduction of both the cloves and nutmeg. Those two spices were more dominant and I would prefer the cinnamon to be the dominant flavor.

I've made these the last 2 holiday seasons and they are always a big hit. You do have to watch them closely in the oven, they burn easily.

Phew..I pulled these out in the nick of time! So yes, watch closely (I had oven at 300 degrees). Love the basic recipe. I had close to 4 cups pecans so I used 2 egg whites with a splash of vanilla. I also added about 1/2 tsp chili powder & cayenne pepper to jazz these up. Omitted the clove & used allspice instead. Fairly simple and real darn yummy! Thanks for the post.

30 minutes is waaay too much time in the oven.  I probably took the tray out around 15-18 minutes.  Stir the nuts often, not just once or twice!  I substituted vanilla extract for the water.

Wow-these are great! I wanted a sweet snack, but didn't feel like baking cookies. These were a nice change. I followed the recipe, but only baked the nuts for 18 minutes at 300 degrees. I stirred them every 6 minutes. I could really taste the cloves, so if you're not a clove fan you might want to reduce the amount or leave them out.

Spiced pecans have been our gift to coworkers for the last 8 years at least. This is the recipe we follow each year. We add an 1/8 tsp of cayenne for a subtle little kick and have found that for our new oven 24 minutes at 350 is perfect. We also baked on parchment this year and it was MUCH easier than the foil.

These were really great and easy to make.  I was a little concerned that they looked 'dull' instead of shiny and eye-catching.  Next time i may not cook as long, and just boil the sugar mixture in a pot before stirring on the nuts.  I think they'd look more glazed then.  I did use walnuts with the pecans and they are so good.  They are waiting to be placed in glass jars to gift away but meanwhile my husband and i have eaten a good chunk out of them.  Besides the appearance i was very pleased with this recipe.... talk about addictive!

These are very tasty.  I didn't find the cloves too overpowering at all.  They added a nice spicy element.  It's all in what you personally like.  I added a tiny bit more cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It's a winner and I will make these again.

Pat, I don't know you but I love you--:) I have never made this kind of pecan, but have had them many times(the store bought kind) and for Christmas this year I bought pecans and starting searching for the just right recipe. These are so easy and just fantastic. Thank you so much for the "Christmas Gift" of a wonderful recipe! I did turn down the oven heat to 325 and cooked for twenty mins, turning them twice-- i used a disposable foil pan, i knew they'd cook quickly. Peggy in TX.

I make these every year for the holidays for friends and family. I do the recipe pretty much as is, but add in 1/2 tsp cardamom. So delish and easy to double or triple the batch for gift giving. I do make them year round, as well, to add to salads and hot cereal etc.

Amazing! I love how there is no butter in this recipe. As suggested by others, I left out the cloves, cut down on nutmeg (personal preference) and beat the egg whites til only soft peaks which I think helped with coating the nuts. I used raw cane sugar (I ground it so it was finer like white sugar) and cut it down to just over half the amount and it was still sweet enough. Baked at 300, stirred every 10 minutes and it needed about 35 minutes total in my oven.

Haven't served these to anyone that didn't fall in love. Many requests for this recipe. I use (fresh from the tree) English Walnuts instead of pecans. I too omit the clove and nutmeg and double up the cinnamon.

Excellent!  But cannot imagine keeping them in a jar...I eat them too fast!  Agree low temperatures...but had oven on 300 for about 5 minutes, then shut the oven off...it was time for dinner!  After dinner, kitchen cleaned, pecans were perfect!

Awesome and simple recipe. I scaled it up to fit my 4 cups of pecans, and they are delicious. Also, makes the whole house smell AMAZING. I did add a touch of cayenne pepper for a little kick, came out great.

I absolutely loved these pecans..and so did my Hubby. I froze them and they have become a nice little "hold me over" snack until a full meal time. I did not use cloves tho and it they were still excellent!

I make these once a week cause my spouse can't get enough of them.  I use Splenda instead of sugar for a healthier kick.  My inlaws thought they had the best recipe but now they want this recipe. Pretty much the best recipe ever.

I made almost 5 pounds of these this year - one batch at a time - for gift giving, husband's work holiday luncheon, and to set out for snacks.  Everyone loved them, and the house smelled fabulous.  To me these taste like the delicious topping of a pecan pie (my favorite part)without all the gooey sweet filling!  Oh - I did add the 1/2 tsp of ancho chili powder, as recommended by some.  Gives just a tiny kick to the sweetness.

Just perfect! They're so addicting! Everyone expects them for the holidays now and they're gone in a flash. Because of some food allergies I tried another recipe that just uses butter instead of egg whites- what a disappointment. These are the best ever.

I added 1/2 c. brown sugar also and I like the flavor.  In error, I added too much cinnamon.  They are still very good, but I will get that right the next time.

Fantastic!!!!  The smells coming from the kitchen were heavenly enough, and then the taste was even better!! Easy, delicious, extra-wonderful.  I made a big batch for Christmas gifts this year and they were a huge hit.

This was excellent. A friend of mine from Pennsylvania always sends me a tin of nuts every year for Christmas.  This was the perfect way to add a little snap to them.

Wow, are these addictive!!!  Everywhere I brought them over the holidays, they were a hit and I was asked for the recipe several times.  I did mine on parchment paper because the first batch stuck so badly.  Other than that, followed recipe exactly.  Will be making these again for sure.  Thanks.!

I thought that these were just okay. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne because I wanted a little extra kick. I think that the amount of cloves in this recipe is just over the top and it came through in the finished product. If I were to make these again I would probably decrease it by at least half. Also, instead of just pecans I used mixed nuts. Overall, these were so-so.

This is good, but you can add more pecans (another 2 cups) with this amount of sugar.  Also, they do burn before thirty minutes, so I will try cooking them at 300 degrees next time for 15-20 minutes.

These are really fantastic!! I was worried that it had too much cloves and nutmeg but it was really tasty!! They taste great as a snack and also added to salads. I plan on making several batches to hand out as gifts at Christmas.

OMG!  These were wonderful!  Don't make if you are trying to watch your calories.  A small handful just is NOT enough!
When I baked these, I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper and it worked out very well.  They didn't stick to the paper and clean up was very easy.

Yum!  These turned out great.  Only problem encountered was cooking them at 350 for just 20mins they started to burn.  I would lower the temp to 300 and bake for 20mins stirring every 5mins.

Yumm!  I'm making up batches to gift my daughter's teachers at school.  Since I'm cooking 3-4 batches at a time... I mix up the sugar and spice mix in custard bowls (1 for each batch), ditto for egg whites (I use JUST WHITES -- powdered egg whites).  I toss the pecans in a gallon zip bag with the whites to coat, then add the sugar and spices.  It's quick and no bowls to clean!  The second batch, I cut the sugar back a bit (the nuts seemed too sweet) and upped the spices,  since each package of pecans is 4 cups.  More of the pecan flavor seems to come through on the second batch.

YUM! Made these for the first time tonight to bring to Thanksgiving at relatives' and my husband couldn't stop eating them! I cut back on the cloves to about half based on other reviews and they were GREAT! I made another glazed/spiced nut recipe as well and didn't liek it at all, but I'll certainly be making these again.

Very good! I read previous reviewers and opted to cut the cloves down to 1/4tsp. I added slightly more sugar and baked the batch at 325 degrees for 20 minutes, stirring after 10 minutes.

These were GREAT ! I used half the cloves and a little extra cinnamon. I used Reynolds Release non-stick foil so the nuts wouldn't stick. Baked at 325 degrees for 25 minutes. Any longer and nuts would have burned. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe !!

After my mother started a fire in the kitchen making candied pecans one christmas when I was young, I've been scared of making them since.  WOW!!!  These are easy, super tasty and easily modified with different spices for different uses.  I added black and cayenne peppers and extra nutmeg, they turned out great and only took about 5 minutes to prepare!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This is one of my husband's favorite fair foods in the summer and fall.  I got some pecans on sale and wanted to try making these for him at home. I liked that this recipe called for egg white instead of butter.  My husband loved these and thought they were quite good.  He mentioned they could use a little more sugar, though.  He also missed the butter flavor.  

All in all, it made a terrific batch of nuts.  I baked them at 270 degrees and did stir them every 10 minutes---took just a little over an hour.

I have made these multiple times for family, friends, and coworkers and everyone has loved them. They give you the perfect mixture of sweet with a little pizzazz to really kick it off. Brown sugar gives it a little more flavor, therefore I use it more than white sugar, or just a combination. Hope you enjoy!

I mixed all the wet ingredients, then mixed in pecans, then took the easy route and mixed the dry in and tossed it all together. I also agree with baking them at 300° instead of 350° for 30 minutes and turning them every 10 minutes. Delish!

I did just as the recipe said, except once I put the pecans in the oven I reduced the temperature to 325 and then stirred them 3-4 times baking for 30 minutes. These are delicious and definitely addictive!

Definitely lower the temperature unless you enjoy burned nuts.  Also, I recommend cutting the sugar and a touch more salt.

I substituted the cloves with cardamon, as suggested by another user.  All my spices were heaping quantities. I baked them in a 9x13 pan lined with a non-stick aluminum foil.  They turned out great and very tasty.

Good flavor and super easy to put together.  Felt like it needed a little something for extra kick, but not sure what.  Great base recipe.  I'll just have to experiment a little with seasoning.

I made these as snack for Thanksgiving and they were gone almost immediately after they were put out. My whole family loves these. I'm making them again for Christmas. I would suggest using more of the sugar/spices mixture because I prefer more of a coating on my pecans.

The version my mom does uses 2 egg whites and no water, with 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon. Also, she melts 2 sticks of butter into the pan right before she spreads out the pecan/cinnamon mixture. Bake at 325 for 30 min turning every 10 minutes. I think the butter helps keep them from burning and the taste wonderful!

Finally a spiced pecan recipe with the flavors that I've been looking for.  My wonderful mother-in-law makes them during the holidays and she overspices them.  I took the advise of another reviewer and added 1/2 teaspoon to the mixture.  This was a nice find before the holidays roll around.

What a wonderful, simple recipe!  Great flavor, great crunch.  I added some whole almonds to the pecans and the result was top-notch.  I'll definitely make these again, they're an easy way to impress guests!

This is a regular recipe in my rotation, and everyone loves it! I always make it as something to bring to parties, especially holiday dinners.  I didn't make it for Thanksgiving - and people asked me for it! Oops! They're not the prettiest nuts in the world (I think "dull" is putting it mildly), but so addictive.

I used about four cups of pecans and went a tad light with the cloves.  They are so good.  I made a second batch with walnuts and used part brown sugar and I enjoyed them even more.  I will make these again and again.

Very good recipe.  Nice and easy!  I cooked these at 30 degrees for 50 min, turning every 10 min, but think I would stop after 40 min next time.  I was temped to stop, but didn't.  They were just a little too done, but still yummy.  Note:  If you aren't a huge clove fan, reduce or eliminate it.  I love cloves and it's almost too strong for me.    I used a jelly roll pan lines with foil.  Made stirring very easy with the little lip to hold in all the nuts.  Enjoy!!! and Thanks, Pat!

I had to use this recipe because the recipe I've been using all winter has disappeared. I made a couple of changes: used walnuts because that's what I had, left out the cloves, increased the nutmeg by 1/4 tsp , and added 1/4 tsp cayenne.  I'll make this again....and not lose the recipe.
UPDATE 1/25/20: Upped the cinnamon by 1/4 tsp (in addition to the steps I took above). To the wet ingredients I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 TBS maple syrup. This came out strange. I won't make those changes again.

Very good... I cooked on lower heat 200-250 is sufficient or they will burn at the higher heat.  Low and slow makes them more crunchy.   Also, add more spices and sugar...  double everything including the egg whites.  For 3 lbs of pecans it’s not enough.   Let them sit on the counter and cool.  They are awesome.

Instead of cloves I added 1.5 tsp. 5 Spice.
Cooked 20 minutes because at 30 minutes they got way too brown and hard.

Terrible. 30 minutes in the oven was way too long. What a waste of time and money.

Great recipe! Did make the following changes- used two egg whites & substituted vanilla for water - beat to soft froth. Did not use clove but did double cinnamon & almost double nutmeg. Also added cayenne- cooked on parchment paper at 300 foil & stirred every ten minutes in oven.

These nuts
Are my go-to Christmas gifts for neighbors. Watch them carefully that last ten minutes. Makes your house smell amazing all day too! If you're using fresh ground nutmeg that taste really shines through and they'll taste a little like eggnog so unless that's your jam you might want to cut down on that. Great with almonds!!

Good recipe, I find it works best when egg whites are hand whipped to an almost “loose meringue” consistency, popped them in my convection toaster oven at 300 degrees and only needed to stir them around twice,approximately 6-7 minutes apart total cook time was about 20-25 minutes for me

I make these all the time but omit the white sugar and use Swerve Granulated in order to make them sugar free (we have a diabetic in the house).  I used to make them with regular sugar and with the Swerve they turn out just as good.  Other than that I bake them at 300 for 30 minutes instead of 350 and stir them 3 times (every 10 minutes) during the bake.

These are absolutely addictive! After reading many reviews, I made the following changes and the pecans turned out amazing:
2 egg whites instead of 1.
Substitutes half teaspoon+ of chili powder instead of cloves.
Used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.
Mixed the dry ingredients then poured them onto the pecans coated in egg white.
Cooked at 300F for 30 minutes. Stirred them every 10 minutes. 
Coat the aluminum foil with oil first for easier stirring.
Pull the foil and nuts off baking sheet to cool.

I like the addition of cloves in this recipe. I just made then as a test run for a bigger batch next weekend, and they are wonderful! I think next time I will try the vanilla as a substitute for water, and add a bit if cayenne. Not sure why so many folks had issues with them burning. I tossed mine every 10 minutes and they didn't over cook at all. My husband gives them a thumbs up.

These are the best.  Great snack and wonderful chopped on spinach salad.  Yum.  For a more savory snack add a few shakes of cayenne pepper and cumin to the spice mix.

Allrecipes is always my first choice when seeking tecipes.  Every one prior to this was perfect.  This is a Terrible recipe.  .  Made  2 batches and cooked 10 minutes apart.  First batch burned up in the oven last 10 minutes.   The temperature is too high or cook time listed is  too long. Such a shame to waste so many pecans on a  recipe like this.. someone needs to modify it.

This is a great recipe to start with and then experiment to fine tune for your personal taste. I agree with the other reviewer that swapping out the cloves in favor of cardamom is a boss move and adds elegance. Also, I love the kick that a 1/4 tsp of cayenne adds to the mix. However, if you want to take this to the next level, start with pecans that have been blanched for 1-2 minutes. Minor investment up front yields incredible results.

Miserable recipe. I shouldn't have to pour over hundreds of reviews to learn that (1) the oven temperature is too high and (2) 30 minutes is too long. How does that misinformation get by for so long without someone making an adjustment that users can actually see without earning an MLIS degree and researching the review archives? This isn't an "add an 1/8 teaspoon more of cinnamon for an awesome flavor boost" situation--we're talking instructions integral to the recipe's viability!

If I don't make these for the holiday season, I get in trouble when family and friends. I adjust the seasoning depending on what I have in my cupboard and have always had success. Only real issue is your oven- make sure to roast evenly (I mix around 2-3 times) and be careful not to overcook!

Ok, I don't know what kind of ovens you all have that made this successfully and without burning, but you lucked out. I followed this recipe as written and, after 10 minutes, had half my pecans burning. I immediately turned the oven DOWN to 225 and, with frequent stirring, ended up with nicely dried and tasty spiced nuts. Be warned to watch your batch closely if you use the oven temp recommended with the recipe.

Made it just as written (although it should say to beat the egg whites until frothy), but next time I'm going to follow my other recipe for baking, which is 1 hour at 250 degrees. This produces a crunchier coating and lower likelihood of burning. These nuts cooked at so high a temperature became dark VERY quickly. Also, grease the cookie sheet or use non-stick spray - these stuck to the foil in several places.

This is a great recipe. It's become a family and friends favorite. Sometimes I add a tablespoon of whiskey in place of the water or a pinch or two of cayenne or mini chocolate chips to change it up. Works well with walnuts too.

I used 1 lb. of pecans, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp., replaced the water with vanilla, reduced the cloves to 1/4 tsp. and added 1 tsp. cardamom. I also reduced the oven temp to 250 degrees and baked for 1 hour, stirring every 15 min. Yum, yum.

I changed the  following: instead of cloves, I added  pumpkin  pie spice, in the same proportion.   Also to control burning  I baked @ 225 degrees F. For 1 hour and set timer to stir every 15 min. Makes for even cooking.

These turned out great.  I was a little hesitant to put the whole 1/2 tsp of clove recommended but did anyway and they  tasted  just fine.  I used the exact amounts requested except added just a touch of vanilla along with the water.  I  baked at 350 and stirred at 10 minutes and then stirred in another 10 minutes and cooked about 2 minutes more so only cooked for about 22 minutes.  I think they would have been burnt if I cooked the whole 30 minutes.  Definitely will make again.  I can't wait to try in a salad.

Being from East Texas where Pecans are plentiful, I fell in love with spiced pecans years ago.  I read all the reviews with and without additions/changes.  My first batch was half/half brown sugar/white sugar, half/half water & vanilla extract with chili powder - not great and pretty bland.  My next batch was all white sugar (I cut it back some) with ORANGE extract, no water and a bit of chili powder.  WE HAVE A WINNER.  The orange adds a wonderful flavor and they smell wonderful.  So does the kitchen when they are cooking! 

Another difference - an early 'plain' batch burned so I turned the oven down to 275, stirred every 8 minutes, for 45 minutes.  

My coworkers loved them for Christmas gifts and my husband loves the 'left overs.'  Enjoy!

Did not like!  I am a HUGE fan of cloves, yet their taste clashed with the recipe (and I even halved the amount specified!).  Baffled and disappointed - I will resort to the more popular recipe on this site which always produces gift-worthy results.

Made it just as written (first time trying it) and the recipe turned out great. I like the idea others had of using a little vanilla in place of some of the water but even just as written, this was a hit with my family and won't be around long!

I have been making these nuts for years! I always make them to give as Christmas gifts. I put them in a simple Mason jar with a pretty ribbon on it or in a metal tin. 
They are SUPER SIMPLE to make and the spice combo can be tweaked to accommodated personal tastes. I usually use only cinnamon and nutmeg, but have also made them with the ground cloves. I have received endless compliments and requests for a "larger batch", some even offering to PAY me for making them! I have always declined the money, but I COULD turn this into a business endeavor.
I usually make a large stash of these tasty treasures to use throughout the year as well. They make a wonderful topping for ice cream and to add to struedel  toppings, crumbled on pancakes, the possibilities are endless!

I made these as written the first time. Kind of messy and nuts were hard to keep separated. The 2nd time I beat the eggs to a stiff peak. It was much better. The nuts stayed separated. Love these. Will make again!

Love this recipe. Have a batch in the oven right now!
My family recipe that we all used for years is really good. This is even better!!! Customize as you wish, but i love 'em as is!

Added 9/26/16 Just made with vanilla as some suggested and I think that will be my new default version!!

11/2/16  My latest version uses vanilla butternut flavoring.  It is a very strong flavoring so 1/4 tsp is enough when used with other spices. For a less stressful baking experience I turn the oven down to 275 . Learned this the hard way!!

Great recipe minus the time. If your oven seems to run a little warm stop at 20 min. I went 25 first time and almost lost the batch.

Easy and AMAZING!  Definitely reduce the oven to 250-275 degrees.  I double all of the spices and use allspice rather than cloves (personal preference), and I also add some cayenne for some extra zip. I have used Splenda instead of/or half with sugar and it works well. Great for snacking or toss in with a salad. I make these every year for Christmas gifts, but I have to save a lot for my family too!

This recipe is good however I found these not be be coated enough.  I added 1 Cup sugar the second time I made it, and cooked it longer in a lower temperature of 250 F for 45 minutes.  The additional sugar made the flavors seem balanced.

Making this the first time this holiday season! My husband is southern born & bred, so I though he might enjoy these. I added a dash of cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit more, boy do they smell yummy!! I did one thing different, I mixed it all in a big bowl! I did the egg white & water in my large mixing bowl. Then I added the pecans to that mixture, I dumped the spice & sugar mixture into the bowl in small intervals & mixed it all together. I think this method was better because every nut was evenly coated & kept a mess to nonexistent. Can't wait to try them!!

I followed the recipe exactly and am pleased. Next time, I'll coat the foil with non-stick spray and add a bit of cayenne to the spice mixture.

These are fantastic! Made my husband's boss very, very happy as a Christmas gift! This year I'm giving him two bags, one to take home to his family and one big bag to keep at work for himself! 
I did use vanilla extract instead of water, half brown sugar, half white sugar, double the cinnamon and several dashes of cayenne, too. I baked mine at 300 degrees, stirring every 10 minutes, took about 30 minutes total. Thanks for the recipe!

Instead of water I use melted -1 stick of butter, 2 egg whites, 
1 cup of Splenda, and 2 T (sea salt)  (for 16 oz of pecans)
Toss in mixture and cook for at least an hour.
300 degrees until dry, turning every 15 minutes.
Then I add small pretzels sticks,M&M's and small pieces of chocolate candy. I than pack them in tin's for the grand kids
for xmas treats under the tree.

This is a great recipe I have just expanded it for xmas, I fix it both ways, but you could say this is more of a trail mix for kids!

I've made these for several years now at Christmas, and they are everyone's favorite. So super easy to make. I get a 4 lb bag of pecans from Costco so I can make several batches.  I follow the recipe exactly -- stirring is a must.

I made a few changes as others have suggested...I substituted vanilla for the water and beat the egg white until it was frothy and thick.  I also used brown sugar in place of white sugar.  I also cooked them for 30 minutes at 300 degrees, any hotter and they would have burned.  I also turned them every 10 minutes.  Unless you really like the flavor of cloves (which I personally do!), you might want to half the amount of cloves called for and possibly double the cinnamon.  These were still excellent!

OhMyGodSoSoSoSoGood! Made these for Christmas dinner as a pre dinner snack...
It's taking everything in me not to sit here and eat every last pecan in the bowl! Instead I had to sign up just to post a review. I added half a teaspoon of cayenne to the spice mix. You have to keep an eye on it and mix it every 6 minutes. They burn fast. Even still the slightly burnt ones taste amazing too. My husband actually said he could sit there eating the entire batch in one sitting and not even batt an eyelash or even pay attention to what's happening around him.  I will be making these again-with the added cayenne. Thank you for this one!!!

This was a winner...I didn't have any nutmeg since I just made a bunch of Thanksgiving "stuff" so I added a splash of chili powder instead.  The clove mixed with chili powder was a great flavor. I had to beat back the hungry mob (family) in order to have enough to fill my mason jars for Christmas gifts.

I baked it 30 minutes the first time - 20 minutes @ 350 works with my oven.  I have used it with 2 t cinnamon also, it's always a hit!! Easy and fast!!  They are good as snacks or in a salad.  It makes a great gift also.

Made to use on a salad for a dinner party a couple of weeks ago--they were a huge hit!  I had made a double batch, so we sent the extra home with the guests and they were thrilled (also have asked for the recipe). Next time I may go a little lighter on the cloves, but that's my personal taste.

I made this with peanuts instead of pecans and they turned out great.  Pecaus would be better but I had peanuts on hand.

What a great treat.  My husband and friends love them.  I used brown sugar instead of white, and the only spice I used was cinnamon, and they still turned out excellent.

I gave these to my friends for Christmas.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.  I also use walnuts but I cook them a little less because they burn easier than the pecans.

I doubled the recipe for my Christmas Eve party, put in only half the amount of cloves it called for and what a hit! The word "addictive" was heard all around the room!

I tried to cut back on the sugar and was disappointed.  They looked like they were thoroughly coated, but they didn't taste sweet enough.  Next time I'll add all the sugar.

These are wonderful.  I also added a teaspoon of ground ginger.  I'm making another batch today and I'm going to try it with some fresh grated ginger this time.  We love everything ginger.

Very good.  I made this for my Thanksgiving salad that calls for spiced pecans.  Wonderful on the salad as well as just to snack on.

I've made this for the holidays the last few years and it's been a huge hit with EVERYONE!  I used wax paper last year which saved my baking pans.

Wow - these are incredible! I usually buy candied pecans, but these are a whole lot better. They are a great addition to a lettuce salad. Thanks for a treat!

awesome!  I added a dash of chile powder and cumin, and sprinkled with kosher salt before baking.  Perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and salty!!

Wow! These are so easy to make and taste so good. I mixed everything following the recipe exactly.  As one of the reviewers suggested, I mixed everything 
in a zip lock bag and spread the pecans on a foil lined pan that I had sprayed with a little olive oil.  I cooked my nuts for 23 minutes.  Yummy!!!

Good recipe. Due to previous reviews I cut the cloves back to 1/4 tsp. I keep pecans in the freezer since hubby loves them so much. This is another good recipe that is much cheaper to make than buying these out. Thanks.

Wonderful recipe.  Had lots of folks asking for it over this holiday season.  Unlike others, I didn't think the taste of cloves overpowered the recipe.  Will definitely make this again next Christmas!

Oh my gosh!  What an awesome way to serve nuts!  They were SO good, people couldn't keep there hands out of the dish.  I did add some additional spices, as I poured alot of the nuts over our carmel glazed ham.  I added a teaspoon each of Allspice, Ground Mustard and Cinnamon.  Excellent on the ham or straight out of the candy dish!
