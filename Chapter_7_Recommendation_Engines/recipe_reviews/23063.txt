I used Cabernet Sauvignon instead Burgundy and also, I mixed it 50/50
wine with water and after when meat was done, I mixed liquid and ingredients together in blender ( obviously except the meat ), I used vegetables, fruits, cranberies and baked potatoes as a side dish. You can also mix sauce with half and half creme. I made wonderful meal from moose meat. Thank you.

Personally I loved this marinade. My husband didn't like it at all. If you like the taste of wine, than you will love this recipe!

This was the best moose we've had. I used Cabernet Sauvignon for the red wine. Its great! Will use again and will recommend to all my friends.

This really did take the gamey taste out of the moose roast.  Too much of a wine taste for our daughter.  Will use again.

We used this marinade for venison ribs.  They marinated overnight and were smoked all day the next day.   Burgundy wine is really inexpensive and therefore good to use in a marinade.  On other's advice I cut down on the wine and added some water.

Used one bottle of merlot and dried thyme.  I added marjoram, celery salt, sliced celery and mixed in some olive oil.  After allowing  to marinate overnight, it was slow cooked on the grill all day.  We did top the moose with strips of bacon.  I do not eat moose, but those who did really enjoyed it (I will try this made with beef).   Thanks for the recipe!

The wine was overpowering and can be blamed for making this recipe a failure.  Perhaps there is a specific burgundy that would work better with this recipe, but we sure didn't find it.

I've used this marinade 3 or 4 times my guest are always pleased with how it turns out , I've scaled it down for smaller portions... excellent for venison, great for a roast of beef ... huge
