Absolutely loved it!  A good hot weather dish.  I made it as written and served the apples and onions on the side with buttered rice.  This will be a company meal for me.

This was good, but the sauce is veeerrrrryy rich.  I loved the creativity of the recipe, as I have never had these ingredients together before, but I can't give 5 stars because my family didn't love it.  It was a beautiful entree and to present it, I didn't add the chicken to the sauce, but spooned the thickened mixture over the chicken.  If I could rate it 4.5 stars, I would.  Thanks for sharing such an interesting recipe!

This is my husband's fav meal! It is on the menu at his fav restaurant, but it is called Chicken Normandy. I have been looking for this recipe forever! Thank you very much, we moved to Costa Rica and don't get back to the States much, now I can make it here!

Incredible recipe.  I preheated my oven so after cooking my chicken I could let it stay warm.  Simple to prepare, very elegant and the sauce is bursting w/ flavour.  I used a fine Calvados instead of the apple jack brand of apple brandy

Amazingly delicious. We had this over steamed rice, and spinach with lemon juice on the side. I didn't change a thing except I did not take the time to go buy apple brandy. In its place I used half cooking sherry and half apple cider. The sauce, apples, and mushrooms with the rice was the best part, in my opinion.

I absolutely loved the dish but my favorite part was the sauce. Unfortunately, I didn't have the apple brandy but I replaced that with 1/4 cup apple juice and 3/4 cup chardonnay and it was absolutely delicious!!!

Yes I made it and loved it but made a few changes
Everytime I use any kind of liquor  I always reduce it to add more depth of flavors. I advise that you use more of the Apple brandy and reduce it way down before adding to this recipe. I added twice as much and it was so much better the second time I did this and added one more apple I also added a touch of cinnamon and left out the green onions

I searched for this recipe after having this dish at a German Restaurant.  We have made it with and without apples.  Great either way.
