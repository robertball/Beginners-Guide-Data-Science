This turned out great after a few modifications. I sauted the onion & 2 lg cloves of garlic (minced) in a large non-stick skillet. Once the onions were tender I added 8oz fresh sliced mushrooms. I also stirred in 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, the chopped turkey, and a little salt into the liquid mixture before adding the shredded cheese. I used a 12oz pkg of angel hair pasta. I stirred everything together in the same large skillet then transferred to a baking dish. I added the cheese on top, covered with foil and baked at 350 for about 15-20 minutes. I think this may have helped to keep things moist. My husband loved it!

Excellent recipe for left over turkey!  Used a combo of cheddar and swiss cheese then added 1 tsp of garlic powder to cheese sauce.  Great dinner for a cold snowy winter evening.

This recipe has been altered. It now uses only one 8 ounce package of angel hair pasta instead of two. -- Happy cooking! The Staff

This was great!  My kids are already getting tired.  I made this for dinner and they asked to have it again the next day.  I used fresh mushrooms and celery and sauteed them with the onions.  I also used green olives instead of pimentos.  I will definately make this again.

This recipe was very very easy to make! My husband is allergic to mushrooms, but I added a layer of steamed brocolli between the turkey and the cheese sauce for an all in one meal. Works out great for me, I make it in the morning or the night before, when I have the most time, and leave it covered in the fridge until dinner time. Perfect!

As it is, this recipe is still too dry but the flavor is good.  Next time I will double the sauce.  And I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic - just because!

Excellent! Great to get rid of turkey left-overs. I could imagine corn instead of the pimientos. Allows for lots of promising variations.

Great! I followed Sharlag's suggestions and it turned out perfectly. I did add some gread crumb/butter topping and broiled it for a minute or so to turn it brown.

I followed BBHolt's lead and added sherry (a given when I'm making a cream sauce!!). Also added 3 cloves of garlic, as I am incapable of cooking without it! Topped with bread crumbs and I'm rating it based on how GOOD the sauce tasted. Oh and fresh mushrooms.

Not bad...the kids liked it.  My husband even liked it and I thought for sure he wouldn't.  It does need a little more sauce.  I put fresh mushrooms in and it livened it up a little.

I used this for a jumping off point.  Nice to have a no cream of soup recipe. I intended to use  leftovers from a lb of already cooked spaghetti noodles but when I made the sauce I thought there was way too much for the pasta so I ended up cooking and using all of a16 oz pkg. I did add more milk, tossed in some stray cheese (Gouda, Swiss), used half a bag of mixed veggies, 8oz fresh shrooms, and added sherry, 3/4 cup. ( the "missing" flavor for some?)   Oh and about a t. of HOT hot sauce. Also used 1/2 cup each seasoned bread crumbs and parm for a topping.  I ended up REALLY happy with the outcome.

this was a perfect post-thanksgiving dinner because i had all of the ingredients on hand! the only modifications i made were to saute fresh sliced mushrooms instead of using the canned variety & to sprinkle the top with a blend of dry bread crumbs & grated parmesan cheese. although i covered the tetrazzini for the first 20 minutes it still came out slightly dry. next time i'll consider decreasing the pasta or making a little more cheese sauce. thank you earla!

The kids liked this recipe because it was nice and plain.  I was wishing there would have been a little more sauce.... it would have made the noodles a little more exciting.  However, it was an excellent recipe for our leftover turkey.  If you haven't used up those leftovers, I definitely recommend this recipe for an idea!  Thanks for sharing :-)

Great comfort food using left-over Thanksgiving turkey!  I skipped the layering and mixed everything together.

Yum!  Pretty much followed the recipe as-is except for adding a bit of sherry to the cheese sauce and mixing everything together before dumping into a baking dish (rather than layering).  I also topped with bread crumbs.  Definitely going into the regular rotation.

Okay, so we customized it a bit.  
Added one stalk of finely chopped celery and two cloves of garlic to onions.  Used regular spaghetti, green peas, and no pimento's or mushrooms.
Mixed the diced turkey into the cream sauce and heated through before adding the cheese.
For cheese, we used a half cup mozz/parm/rom blend, along with a half cup of a cheddar blend  We then sprinkled grated parmesan on top and sprinkled on some dried bread crumbs.  5 stars for our version from our family.

I too made modifications and did so because the tetrazzini I've had in the past had celery in it and a bread crumb topping but, that's not all. I did not have chopped pimento to use so, I diced up a red bell pepper and sauteed that along with fresh mushrooms, onion, and the celery. It might be worth mentioning that I did not have enough sharp cheddar so, I used mild and some Monterey Jack. After I topped it with cheese I sprinkled it with bread crumbs and drizzled it with melted butter. It came out really well. I'll definitely make it again.

This came out really good.  I added a little diced garlic and extra cheese.  Also, I didn't have the pimentos so I used some chopped up roasted red pepper.  I think it tasted even better the second day.

This was a great idea for leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. I added about a cup more milk, some leftover cooked broccoli, and doubled the cheese amounts, and had a delicious, filling meal that even the kids loved.  Thanks!

What a wonderful way to sneak leftover turkey to even finicky teens!  I added minced garlic to the onion and I used a more cheese in the sauce.  It was a huge hit - I highly recommend it!

I read all the reviews, and I put lots less pasta in, sauteed garlic and celery with the onion, put more diced turkey (maybe 2 cups).... garlic powder also.  I put some fine bread crumbs and parmesan on top.  My husband just loved it; I still thought it was kind of "tame" and I ended up putting some hot sauce on it!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used left over turkey (should have used more, I only used 2c.)  Like the fact it doesn't use canned soup.  will make again.

I found it to be exceptionally dry, and with little flavor.  There should be about twice as much sauce and half as much pasta.  Don't think I'd make this one again.

This dish is wonderful with a little bit of spicing up.  It definitely needs freshly minced garlic.  I didn't have poultry seasoning, so instead added sage, thyme and a little fresh rosemary.  Didn't add the pimentos, used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added slightly more turkey.  So yummy!!

Delicious. My husband even had seconds. I did cut the amount of salt and pasta in half. I also added some sage, rosemary and thyme for added flavor. Great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.

It seems like this should be better than it actually is. I'm not sure what it is missing though. It's a good simple dish and I'll probably make it again if I have turkey leftovers.

There must be a mistake in the amount of angel hair pasta to use!  This was incredibly dry.  I'm sorry I used up my leftovers with this.  Ugh!

My husband thought it was pretty good. I thought it was too dry.  My son didn't like it and he usually likes these kinds of meals.  I will probably try it again, but will make more sauce the next time.

I had to make a few changes because I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I also modified based on other reviewers.   It turned out great and I can't wait to try other combinations.  I added garlic, celery and red pepper with onions.  While boiling the pasta, I added peas and corn during the last 2 min.  Instead of layering the casserole, I mixed it all in a bowl.  Topped it with provolone cheese.  Baked 20 min at 350 covered with foil.  Removed foil, topped with bread crumb/butter mix and broiled for a few min.  I used gluten free pasta, flour and bread crumbs.

I made a few modifications and it was delicious!  I used fusilli pasta since I had some on hand, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I didn't have two cups of milk to use so I used one can of cream of mushroom soup, about 1/4 cup of half and half and filled the rest of the 2 cups with milk. It was delicious!

Really tasty, rated 4 stars because I think simple modifications improved it greatly. After reading so many reviews about this being dry, I ran with Sharlag's idea of adding cream of mushroom soup. I added a can of Cream of Mushroom w/Roasted Garlic soup, and omitted the sliced mushrooms as my hubby doesn't care for overwhelming mushroom taste. I always sub Smart Balance for butter/margarine. Had a 14.5 oz package of angel hair pasta on hand, so I used half of it. Used reduced-fat sharp cheddar, about 1 cup in the sauce and another 1/2 cup on top, and baked in a glass 15" square pan. Such a great way to use up the leftover dark turkey! A big thanks to Earla for submitting and all the reviewers who helped guide me to a delicious result.

I liked this recipe.  I cooked the turkey in hot sauce, italian dressing, wine, minced garlic, and vegetable oil.  i added to the turkey 1/2 a bag of frozed thawed peas, using the peas and turkey pieces as one layer.  I used  1 1/4 cups chopped onion, and added 5 small hot peppers, and 1 cup sliced fresh onions.  I sauteed these in wine, butter, and a bit more garlic, and added the vegetables and stock to 2 cups milk, and one regualar sized can chicken broth.  I doubled the flour in the recipie and added a little cornstarch to the sauce mixture as well.  I used one cup shredded cheddar and 1/3 cup pepperjack slices, shredded,in the sauce. For spices, I used ground white pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, ground red pepper, ground cilantro, ground thyme, and Adobo meat seasoning.
I used another 3/4 of a cup of cheddar on the top, and covered with a mix of ground parmesean and italian style bread crumbs.  I cooked on 350 for 30 minutes.
I made the recipe so that it had a slight to moderate spicy bite to it, which my boyfriend and I appreciate.  I also made extra sauce because I plan on reheating leftovers and do not like things to be dry.
All in all, original recipie was very good, i just tweaked it to my tastes.

Very tasty for leftover turkey.  Took the advice and doubled liquid.  1 part milk, 1 part broth. Peas, mushrooms, and just about anything else can be added.

This was a pretty good dish.  We like our dinners spicy so I added crushed red pepper and garlic to the turkey while browning, but all in all it was pretty good.

I made this with only 1 1/2 cups milk and liked it very much.  I think next time I'll only use 3/4 teaspoon salt, though, and I usually like things pretty salty.  My kids didn't complain once, so that upped the recipe's value in my mind.

Just so-so, would find a different recipe for this dish next time.  Way too bland for our tastes, I could imagine kids liking it because of this though.  Did use a can of mushroom soup because it was way too dry otherwise.  Also, would recommend using a different type of pasta, angel hair really clumped together.

I only made a couple changes to the recipe. I used evaporated milk and used fresh baby bella mushrooms, which I sliced. I used Cheddar/Colby cheese because that was what I had on hand. I used the evaporated milk because I think it has a creamier taste. The can was almost 2 cups so I used a little water to make up the difference. This recipe is very good.

This bears almost no resemblance to Turkey Tetrazzini. Cheddar cheese? Really? Kinda like labeling a hamburger, a meatball. It's a standard turkey noodle casserole.

I used garlic and then sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter and added that to the sauce. Also because of the comments about it being a little dry I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth.It was very good indeed loved by all.

I never  make recipes just like they're printed, but I always tweak them.   This one does need a bit more sauce.  I used fresh mushrooms and tripled the cheese, plus a dusting of cayenne pepper (not enough to make it hot, just enough to catch the hint of flavor).  So for me, this was what I like, a good place to start.

Excellent!  I doubled the sauce recipe because I like cheesy goodness. I used frozen mixed peppers instead of pimentos, and I added a can of sliced olives.  I also used a can of evaporated milk w/ some sour cream in place of the milk, and it turned out great.  Finally, instead of topping with more sprinkled cheese (since I already had extra cheese sauce), I topped with a mixture of breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese.  I will definitely make this again!

My family like it but I put in half the noodles and also sauted onions, garlicm and freash mushrooms ( I hate canned).  I also left out peppers. Then I used more cheese and more milk from the sauce.  I make again the left over turkey!

Other than doubling the recipe and adding some peas, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was moist enough, but not at all flavorful.  Very bland.  Well, at least the leftover Christmas turkey was used up.

It came out really good. I took a few suggestions and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and 8 oz and a half of sour cream. I also added a little paprika and garlic salt to give it a little kick. I used canned portobello mushrooms. The only thing I would change for next time is the type of noodles. I think spaghetti or some other type of smaller noodle would've been better. I also when I poured the mixture over the noodles I realized the mixture was not going to cover.... so I mixed it up the noodles while in the dish. So I would also mix everything together before putting it in the dish. 

Overall I loved the dish...... My boyfriend said it reminded him of tuna casserole, which he doesnt like , so I had food for work for the week which is always a winner in my book.

I didn't have turkey so I purchased pre-cooked chicken strips in the refrigerated section of the store.  My family loved it, they fought for the leftovers.  This recipe has become a staple in our weekly menus.

Too much salt and poultry seasoning. I would cut both in half.

Big hit with the kids (with modifications). I skipped the mushrooms and peppers but added 1/2 of pureed cauliflower to cheese sauce.  I also "pureed" the turkey, I find that chopping it up into extremely small bits makes my fussy 4 year old love this recipe.

This was delicious!  I made a few changes per the other reviews.  I doubled the cheese sauce and added 3 slices of pepperjack cheese.  It turned out perfect!  Will make it next time with Chicken.

The flavors were good, but this was way too dry, even after adding at least a cup of milk to the sauce, and covering with foil for all but 5 minutes of cooking.  I also added some fresh broccoli, parboiled in the pasta pot before adding.

Made this but used a little more cheese than the recipe called for.  A very quick, easy and tasty dish.  Even my 7yr old enjoyed it!

Was a good way to use up left over turkey, but was dry and seemed to be lacking a little flavor. Might try decreasing the amount of noodles or doubling the sauce next time.

This was very good but was cooking for a crowd that I knew would like it a little spicier.  Added green chilies and chipolte peppers in adobe sauce.  Was perfect that way.

Delicious! I was bored with the same old dishes and looked up something with turkey in it (something I had on hand). My husband LOVED it! I made this last week and he has already requested I make it for dinner tonight!

I did tweak it a bit like leaving out the pimento's. Also, I didnt have enough to layer noodles, turkey and sauce so I did one layer and it turned out great!

My kids liked this dinner. I didn't add the pimentos because I didn't have any, but I made it as written and I thought it was good.

This is great for left over turkey.  The pimento really gives it a good flavor but I think I will use a little more than the recipe called for next time I make this.

I thought this was fairly decent but nothing terribly exciting.  I did cut the pasta a bit or it would've been more bland.

This recipe needed some tweaking in my opinion, but my final results were very good.  I used linguine cooked in chicken broth, doubled the sauce and added garlic powder.

My children love this one. I used egg noodles instead of angel hair pasta, and I omitted the pimento. My kids would never eat them! Other than that I made it as directed. It freezes well!

I had to heat the cheese sauce after adding the milk and add another 1/8th cup of flour in order to get the cheese sauce to thicken.  Also, I omitted the onion.  This is the best leftoover turkey recipe I have ever made.  Excellent.
