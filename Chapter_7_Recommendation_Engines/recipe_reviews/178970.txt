Yummy...I added the seasonings to the gravy rather than on top.  There is too much flour called for in the gravy and not enough gravy overall.  I used 3 cups total and still had to make more to serve with the pot pie as there was no liquid.  I also added some sauteed onion and garlic and cooked the frozen veggies in broth for extra flavor.  I will absolutely make this again, but will again add the seasonings to the filling add more gravy before cooking.

Soooo excited to find a recipe for chicken pot pie that doesn't use any dairy (can't have).  I have missed being able to eat chicken pot pie for years!
Thanks so much!

PS:  I saute mushrooms and onions, then add frozen vegetables and cook briefly w/the herbs and then add the chicken.

This recipe is essentially what I made last night. (Wish I'd seen it last night.) :-) I used canned veggies of potatoes, carrots, peas and corn. I kept the chicken veggie mixture on the stove over low heat with a can of cream of chicken soup. The step that I also added was to saute chopped onion and celery in a  little butter and olive oil and then add herbs and then the flour.  After it cooked for a min or two, I added heavy cream and cooked it til it bubbled and then added extra cream again.  I then added the flour mixture to the chicken veggie mixture and cooked it for another 4 min or so to thicken it up.  Talk about a rich chicken pot pie! I found this recipe this a.m.  If I'd had it last night I wouldn't have winged it as much, but I did like the way this recipe is VERY similar to what I did.  :-)  My family went back for thirds!!

This was so easy to make. I followed the recipe except I seasoned the gravy with salt and pepper and also added some parmesan cheese and crushed garlic to it. I served it with tradition garlic bread and some steamed veg. My hubbie doesnt even like chicken pot pie but he loved this one!

This was very good.  My husband kept saying how good it was.  It's going to be a regular in our house.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe last week, as I had a puff pastry sheet that I was trying to get rid of. I didnt have coarsly chopped herbs, but other than that I follwed the recipe to a T. It was very delicious, and the filling was great. the pastry was really great too.. on the night it was first made.  I had a lot of leftovers and had planned on packing it for lunches, but the pastry became kind of soft and sticky when heated in the microwave. Not goos for leftovers, unless maybe you try reheating in the oven.

LOVED the insides.  Disappointed in the Puff Pastery. It was expensive and didn't give enough to the dish. We like more breading.

Delicious.  My family LOVED it!  (even the picky boy!)

Recipe is perfect just the way it is and Easy!  But... next time I'm going to add rosemary and celery.

Also, I had to use pie crust (no puff pastry to be found in my little town.) but the crust was still delicious with the egg wash and all those herbs!

I mainly used this recipe for inspiration, although I think the regular recipe would be good too.  For my filling, I used leftover turkey and gravy from another recipe on this site (Oven-Roasted Turkey Breast) and added mixed vegetables.  I only had enough for a 9 inch pie pan, not a 13x9, so I just folded the edges of the puff pastry to fit on the top.  I did sprinkle herbs over the crust as the recipe states, using the italian parsley I had on hand.  To my surprise, the parsley stayed green and did not burn on the top, which gave it a nice presentation.  Next time I make this, I would spread the pastry out over a 13x9 as called for, or cut off the excess, because the folded over parts did not cook very evenly.

Delicious. You could easily substitute cream of chicken & water for the melted butter, flour and chicken broth, but it was delicious. Using the pastry sheet and herbs gives it a real crispy, fluffy, tasty crust. Better than Bisquick and milk that I have used in the past.

Pastry was good.  Very easy recipe if you are in a hurry.  However, I personally would have liked it to be more creamer.  So, I am looking at another recipe that has fresh veggies and uses chicken soup, and milk...this here is a very simple recipe, just not what I was hoping.

Easy to make, can cut corners if you use dried herbs & good idea for left over chicken and veg if you prefer.
