Great recipe, we will make this one again.  I did use 1/2 cup White Zinfandel in the marinate, I also added another 1/2 cup White Zinfandel prior to reducing.  Next time I will try adding some mushrooms for something a little extra.

Excellent!  I made with balsamic vinegar instead of wine, and it was delicious!  I actually marinated my chicken a lot longer--about 4 hours--and used the BV in the marinade ... I then used the marinade when cooking the chicken and onions (I didn't have shallots, so I used white onions) ... it made the most yummy sauce!  Served over wild rice ... will definitely be preparing again!  Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe it's very refreshing a good summer recipe for the grill!!What I did is used the wine in the marinade and also omitted the sesame oil and used olive oil. I also chopped some fresh parsley instead of shallots and put it in the marinade. I let it sit for about an hour. I cooked the chicken on the stove until it was almost done and then I added the marinade to it and let it cook for about 5-10 min longer. At the end I put it in the broiler for a few min on each side to get it a little crunchy on the outside.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was very quick and quite flavorful. I didn't have the sesame oil so I used olive oil, and I included some of the wine in the marinade. My husband and I both loved it. Thanks a bunch!

Overall a great recipe, will make again.  I followed the advise of the other reviewers and added the wine into the marinade and let is soak for an hour.  I also used white onions instead of shallots and added a little extra wine while on the skillet.  Served it over a bed of rice,

Good, but not great. At least in comparison to the many of other flavorful recipes I've found on here. Easy to make, though, so if I needed something last-minute, this is a decent choice.

This is the best chicken recipe ever.  The chicken turns out very moist and full of flavor.  I would highly highly recommend this recipe to anyone.  I fixed it just as the recipe suggests but I did take the advice of other reviewers and add some White Zinfandel to the marinade.

Delicious! I didn't have sesame oil or shallots but I used vegtable oil and red onions. The herbs flavored the chicken beautifully.

I made this last night. The preparation was a bit lengthy, but well worth it. Loved it!! I had to triple the recipe - added some minced garlic and used onions rather than shallots. I also made a hefty herb mixture and spread on each chicken breast,marinated for about 40 min. Very flavorful! Served with rice a roni, corn on cob & steamed broccoli/cheese. Big hit with the family! Will definately cook again! Great dish for dinner guests!

This was a great dish and quick too!  I only gave it 4 stars because it didn't actually make enough marinade to "pour" over the chicken.  I used the marinade like a rub on the chicken.  The flavor is strong so I suggest bland side dishes to go with it.  I served it with brown rice and spinach.

Really good flavor. I think it actually reduces down too much, would like a little "sauce" on my chicken.

A keeper. Only change was to add cream of chicken to the sauce. As a thickener and extender. Wonderful.

Excellent recipe! Had all the ingredients in the pantry and easy to make.  We used Pinot Grigio because that's what we had on hand.

Yummy!  We used an extra tablespoon of olive oil in the marinade as someone else suggested.  Also, we didn't have white zin, so we tried balsamic vinegar.  Wow!  Very flavorful!

Quick, simple, and tastes excellent!  I was worried the chicken breasts I was using were not going to cook in the alloted time (due to the thickness), but everything turned out tasty and complete!  Thanks!!

Definately should add wine to the marinade and add some extra when you are cooking on the stove.

Delicious! I needed to make a healthy recipe for my grandparents, who have to be careful that certain ingredients don't react with their medications. I omitted the shallots, which cut out the butter, and instead put a bit of fresh parsley on top. I also used balsamic vinegar instead of wine or other alcohols. It turned out perfectly :)

The spice mix promised a lot just by the smell but after cooking the chicken, it really did not have as much flavor as I expected.  I added minced garlic for more flavor and that helped as well as going heavy on the wine.  Maybe if it marinated for longer it would hold the flavor of the spices better.

Friends and family loved it!  It was really juicy and healthy with a side of rice and veggies.  I'm very new to the kitchen, as in this recipe called for me to use a knife so I had to open up a new set.  I appreciated the details in the recipe and I used the reviewers suggestion of adding wine to the marinade and I let it sit for 4 hours.  I also added portebello mushrooms when it was time to add the shallots as another reviewer recommended. My only issue is that I don't know what 'season to taste' means with salt/pepper, so it may have needed more of that in mine.  Thanks for making me look good AR.com!

Followed recipe exactly. There wasn't much to pour on the chicken - more like a paste to spread. Chicken was dry cooked in much less time than recipe instructed. Will not be making again. Sorry!

I happened to have all of these ingredients on hand, so this recipe was the perfect choice in figuring out what to do with some boneless chicken breasts. I made it as stated, and it turned out moist and flavorful. It would go well with just about any side dish, or cut up on top of a salad. I really liked the use of sesame oil, yet I can see olive oil working, too. This recipe is easily modifiable, and versatile, just add less or more of anything depending on which spice taste you want to come through.

Thoguth twice about trying after reading review, but took the gamble and it paid off.  Thought this was excellent!  So easy for the great taste.  I took the previous reviewers advice and added a little more oil to the marinade.  I also cooked for only a couple minutes on each side.

This was a very nice marinade.  I diverted from the recipe a bit and used all of the ingredients as a marinade.  I roasted the chicken in the oven.  Delicious and juicy.  I used fresh ingredients from my garden and not dried.  Will make again.

I can't use wine due to diet restrictions, so I did the balsamic vinegar. It was awfull. I also didn't care for the seasonings..maybe if it were either the rosemarry or thyme but not both. Would not make this again.

I used chicken legs.  Did not have shallots so used sweet onions.  Used more wine about 1/4c. more since legs take longer to cook.  My fussy husband raved about this dish.

Was delish. I served it with rice pilaf and steamed carrots and they complimented it quite nicely.

My family loved this! I did modify it. I used chardonnay instead of white zin, I also used a whole regular onion, and 8 oz of fresh mushrooms sliced and added chicken broth. I spooned out the onions and mushrooms over the chicken, reserved the broth/sauce in the pan and threw some fresh Kale in there until wilted. My teenagers said I was "the mushroom ninja" ;) Hubby didn't speak a word to me because he was inhaling it!

This was a really easy chicken dish to make! I'm always looking for recipes that are great for 1-2 people, and this is one of them.
 I did change a couple of things with the recipe. First of all, I added a few more herbs to the marinade: bay leaves, oregano, and a lemon pepper seasoning. I combined all of the herbs in equal parts olive oil and sesame oil and marinated the chicken in that mixture in a plastic bag in the fridge for 20 minutes. 
I also substituted the shallots for onions and the white win with a sherry cooking wine. 
Serve this with a side of veggies or potatoes and it makes a nice, healthy, delicious meal!
