Terrible--tastes like an ordinary artifical box cake with rum poured on it.  Try finding a recipe where you use natural ingredients.

WOW, excellent cake!!!  I made it for a New Year's dinner, and everybody loved it.  It is easy and delicious.  Instead of yellow cake mix, I used a butter cake mix and it came out perfect.  I will definitely continue making this cake.

This is the Bacardi Rum Cake recipe word for word except they cut the glaze in half for some reason. For the proper amount of glaze, it's 1 stick butter, 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 cup dark rum.  Also, just pour the glaze over the cake while it is still in the pan and it will soak into the cake in 5 mins. Invert onto a cake plate and it's done.

This is ALMOST like my Aunt Hazel's rum cake. You have to double the glaze part and pour slowly over the hot cake (I don't poke holes in cuz I like the nuts to get soaked with it).  Also, be sure to use dark rum for the best flavor.

Fabulous & so easy!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Instead of baking in a big bundt pan, I have a tray that has 12 mini bundt pans and baked them in there instead.  Kept the temp @ 350 and bake time was 18 minutes.  So delicious!  Thanks!

Easy to make and delicious to eat. I made this cake for my wedding and for my sister's wedding and it recieved an enthusiastic reception. I am also about to make it for my new husband's birthday, since it is one of his new favorites.
I tend to add a bit more rum to the glaze to give it extra flavor.

Loved the flavor of the cake.  My family all loved it.  I had some problem getting the pecans and sugar to coat the pan.  Next time I'll combine the two before coating the pan.

This was a terrific recipe.  I made it in one of those fancy Nordic Ware bundt pans and it looked so nice.  I received raves at the potluck and people came up and asked for the recipe and to eat the crumbs off the platter!  Now I'm going to use this basic recipe and try making my own concoction of this cake using other liquers.

Fantastic cake!  I recommend using a stir fry pan (or Wok) instead of a bundt pan.  This makes it way easier to get the pecans spread out on the bottom of the pan, and the thinner cake abssorbs the glaze much better.   More glaze saturation and a more spread out pecan crust = even better!

I made these for Christmas baskets. I used dark coconut rum and baked them in the Wilton Snowflake pan.  It was a big hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

BEST RUM CAKE MY HUSBAND OR I HAVE EVER HAD!  It is absolutely delicious.  I, actually, deleted the nuts because my husband is not fond of them - and it was still perfect.

I had never made rum cake and am not much of a baker, so decided to try this recipe. We all loved it. I did double the rum and get rid of the water though, and made it in cupcake tins, as I didn't have a bundt pan.
All in all, a easy and tasty recipe.

Thought it was good but not the best I've had. It has a pretty strong "box cake" taste to it, which I kind of hate. But other than that, it was VERY moist. heavy rum taste, and the walnuts are a perfect addition.
