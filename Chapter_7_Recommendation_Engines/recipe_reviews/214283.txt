These are fantastic!  I made them for a work lunch that DH had today and it got many rave reviews.  I'm enjoying a piece now.  I only had pistachio pudding on hand and it actually works well - it adds a little extra crunch.  I'll definitely be making it again and again!

This tasted great! I used the "Best Brownies" recipe from this site instead of the brownie mix. I didn't have the vanilla pudding, but I compensated by increasing the milk, powdered sugar and peanut butter-- it still worked well. I was extremely nervous about not thawing the Cool Whip because I know the disaster it can turn in to-- don't worry, it actually works out really well. Finally, I didn't have Baker's brand chocolate, but I used 6 Hershey's snack sized chocolate bars. Also heated it 1 1/2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds.   Overall, this is a great recipe-- I took it to a party and they were completely gone by the end of the night. I will make this again.

Every year we have a desert competition at our church Thanksgiving meal. I made 6 pies, two cheesecakes, and a pumpkin roll. But the pumpkin roll flopped so at the last minute I decided to throw this together at 11pm the night before. As I baked them I thought "watch, this will be the recipe that wins". And sure enough...it got raves! The only brownie mix I had on hand was Giradelli Double Chocolate Brownies. I added molasses and Kalua to the mix. They went so fast my husband didn't have a chance to have any!   I also was afriad of the Whipped Cream chocolate mixture in the microwave. I chopped up the chocolate squares and did it just as it said and at the last 30 seconds of the two minutes it did in fact turn into a creamy chocolate mixture. (after stirring) Give these a try, they are the bomb!

Didn't have cool whip. Just drizzled top with 1/2 bag melted semi-sweet chips & 1 Tablespoon of shortening (mixed together). Amazingly delicious!

My boyfriend made this for me.  It is delicious, but there must be a better way of doing the topping.  I think just the melted chocolate would have been better than the chocolate melted with the whipped cream.  It just didn't need all the extra fat from the whipped cream.

These are so good! I got the recipe from a magazine and my family killed these! I'm definitely making these again! And they're so good cold.

So yummy and satisfying.  One little square is so rich it does the trick.  And the crunchy/salty peanuts make the perfect finish!

Meh. The best part of these was the brownies, I used Brooke's Bombshell recipe from this site.  The peanut butter filling wasn't very good, I think it was the pudding. Against my better judgement I made the chocolate glaze as written. It's not very good at all. Real ganache is so much better, I should have just stuck with that. Overall this recipe is ok, but it's nothing that I would make again.
