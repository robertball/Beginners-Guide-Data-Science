These aren't the prettiest cookies, but they sure are tasty. The smell coming from the oven gave a strong almond aroma, but when you eat them they are surprisingly delicate in flavor. A nice, subtle surprise. I imagine with any other nut butter the flavor would be different, and definitely worth the try (especially cashew butter). This is not your regular peanut butter cookie. These are chewy thanks to the almond flour, get your milk ready, they dunk well. Simple to put together too. Nice recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.

These cookies are very good grain free cookies. I freeze them to eat when Iâ€™m craving something sweet. Easy to make.

Made as written expect added 1 t vanilla extract. I think it would be better to mix the dry ingredient together, then add the egg beaten w/ vanilla, then the nut butter. If you try to just dump all into a bowl it is difficult to fully incorporate all the ingredients. This would be good with peanut butter. I used a 12 oz jar of almond butter. I pressed each cookie w/ a fork tine, then sprinkled on some sugar.
