This just became my favorite recipe on the site. I'm a new cook and a big fan of Chef John's recipes. If you're looking for something different, this is truly outstanding. Check out his video for this recipe on Foodwishes.com which really helped me through it.

I couldn't find any coriander so I minced some cilantro for the meatballs. It is a bit time consuming but WELL WORTH IT.

I never use a recipe when it has only 1 review, but I had ground lamb and some eggplants and 2 hungry boys. So I gave it a shot.

I have to say that I forgot to add the yogurt, and the garlic even though I had both. 
Everyone in my family liked this one, even the kids who don't like eggplants, and even asked for it for lunch the next day. 

I thought it would take longer to make than it actually did, but to speed up the process for next time, I'll make the meatballs ahead of time and put them in the freezer for a quick meal. 

Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I am in the last stages of making this dish and my husband is going CRAZY!  The smell that is filling our house is incredible!  He's been over here sneeking bites and "hangin' around" while I am trying to get this thing done and on the table!  He can hardly wait!   I decided to take a bite of one of the meatballs and OMG!  I am transported back to the time I lived in Turkey.  I am THRILLED because THIS captures the taste of our Adana kebab that I loved so much!  I have said this before and I'll say it again...Chef John is THE MAN!!  Well done, Sir!

This was pretty good....took an awful lot of time to make and I liked it, just didn't love it for the amount of time it took me to make.  I made exactly as written and thought it would have been better if the sauce was a bit thicker.  Maybe if I make again I will try adding more marinara sauce and less chicken broth.

Wow, Chef John, you are my new HERO. Dinner tonight was probably one of my best and I am a woman that LOVES to cook. I didn't make it too spicy, but everything else I did as written. I paired it with your perfect mashed potato recipe, wonderful by the way, and some grilled sweet peppers tossed with olive oil and butter pecan infused balsamic vinegar. All three of my kids have had seconds. I quadrupled the recipe making 1/2 of it now and freezing the meat mixture for another time. WOW, can't wait to try more of your recipes. You're AWESOME :-)

Amazing! One of my favorite recipes to date! I only had ground turkey on hand so I used that instead of lamb but it was still incredible! The sauce was flavorful and the meatballs were moist and perfectly seasoned.

Wanted to offer adventuresome guests an alternative from standard meatballs and sauce, and these lamb meatballs did the trick. The slightly spicy eggplant tomato sauce exceptionally distinguishes this dish from a traditional marinara sauce. A side shaker of grated Pecorino Romano cheese added another level of outstanding flavor to those choosing to use it. The quantity of sauce seemed well proportioned given that we didnâ€™t serve this over pasta or rice. Several people requested the recipe, and Chef John adds another cleverly inventive recipe to his already large collection.

We really liked the taste.  Nice flavor.  Next time I will add more marinara sauce and broth.  Unless I did something wrong,  I had a lot of meatballs and not much sauce.

This recipe was a great way to use up the eggplant from my garden! I loved the method of browning the meatballs in the oven. They were browned like the would be in a pan but I didn't have to fuss with them. The only thing I changed was that I used beef hamburger instead of lamb. (It was what I had in the freezer.) It is a great recipe it will be using again.

Wow this was fabulous.  I loved the rich, fragrant sauce and the meatballs were perfectly flavored.  Because I find lamb a little greasy, I mixed half ground lamb, half ground beef together.  I also cut the salt by 1/3 and did not miss it.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and well worth the wait to eat. For me, what really made the difference is using actual Greek Yogurt as compared to plain North American yogurt - the consistency is thicker. I served it with Barilla rotini that I put shredded marble cheese and feta on top then added the meatball marinara sauce.The only thing I might change when I make it again is to add some red pepper flakes to the burgers to get an extra kick.

This was excellent! I had to substitute something for the eggplant (because I didn't have one and couldn't get out to the store..) so I diced up a couple of yellow squash and it was fantastic. I can only imagine how good this would have been with eggplant :)  will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for my anniversary and it turned delicious. It was really easy to make I just followed the recipe. I paired the recipe with a Pinot Noir wine and it was really good. The only thing I didn't add was the cayenne pepper because I didn't have it but the recipe still very delicious!!!!

Made this today - except for meatballs (which sound great for a 2nd go at this).  I followed the sauce recipe though added in an extra tablespoon of dry herbs (consisting of rosemary, celery seed, basil and parsley), a splash of white wine with vegetable broth and a full jar of marinara.  It was fantastic over pasta - the extra texture/taste of the eggplant and onions sent this easy weekday, vegetarian meal over the top.   Thanks so much!

I'm not a big eggplant fan but I absolutely love this dish. I cube my eggplant into pretty small pieces and it breaks down so much during the cooking you don't really notice it. I've made it several times now without any changes. I like to serve it on top of orzo.

Perfect and delicious. Made a few changes. I added green beans and a chopped potato to make It more hearty. Also needed more sauce and chicken broth. The amount the recipe calls for is not enough. And my little changes, cilantro, dill and a bit of parsley in the meat and the sauce. It was absolutely amazing!!!

Followed the recipe to a T and it was phenomenal. The trick to thickening the sauce, I believe, is to use a good quality marinara that is nice and chunky to begin with and to simmer for a full 45 minutes. I actually ended up adding extra marinara it was so thick! We also added some feta on top. So good!

Love this recipe it reminds me of the Middle East.  The eggplant make it unctuous and delicious. I like to add fresh cilantro to the meatball preparation and I use white bread soaked in milk rather than the breadcrumbs and yogurt. I also like to add some Harissa to the meat mixture but the recipe  works very well as is and is delicious!

this was so simple to prepare and tasted delish. the meatballs were so so tender! loved the idea of mixing the greek yogurt w/the egg and crumbs first. I did add all the spices as listed but also added a heaping 1/2 tsp. of Kibseh spice as well. also added some parsley to the meatballs, and roasted the eggplant cubes, onion, and garlic. a splash of red wine. the only thing I can see that is a bit off is the proportions of the sauce and chicken broth. I had to almost double it but perhaps it is because I added some crimini mushrooms and roasted peppers so the sauce had quite a full body. this is a keeper! so easy and again the balls are so tender.

Lots of flavor for little work. I doubled the spices in the meatballs (personal preference) and also added some dried mint to them. I usually serve this with pasta but served with rice today.

Made as written. Flavors were great, but there wasn't much sauce. I will probably make again, but will increase ingredients to get more sauce. We love lamb, too.

I loved this recipe. Very Flavorful and delicious. I made a note to this recipe for myself to half the amount of cinnamon. It was a little overpowering. Excellent otherwise.

This was just OK for me.  Didn't love it and will not make again. Will try the other lamb meatballs from this site. Followed the recipe but not a keeper for me.

Wow, this recipe was amazing!  Like most people, I read and read and read the reviews and decided the best thing for me was to follow the recipe exactly before making any changes.  And boy was this delicious. Yes, it takes time but I knew before I started as I read the directions. Hubby LOVED the dish just as much as I did and requested the next time I make it to add more eggplant as it was that yummy! The only slight modification was I added 3 shakes of the red pepper flakes to the sauce instead of 2 (which would have been a pinch). Served it with Quinoa and that added a nice nuttiness. Going to surprise my family and make it for them the next time they visit! Thanks Chef John!

Awesome dish. All the family ate it. We put it over cavitappi. I added a couple garlic cloves to the sauce. Didnâ€™t use as much red pepper flakes or cayenne as some family has reaction to things that are too spicy. Still tasted great. Will make again

I have didnâ€™t have marinara so I used some Ragu pasta sauce, and I also didnâ€™t have fresh mint so I used fresh cilantro. I also didnâ€™t have eggplant and this dish still came out delicious!!! Thanks again ChefJohn!

Love this one, it's a keeper! I replaced the marinara sauce with two large ripe garden tomatoes and used beef instead of lamb, because that's what I had. Served over rice, and my husband, who protested loudly about an eggplant dish, went back for seconds!

So yummy!  I didn't want to stop eating!
After reading reviews about how time consuming this recipe is, I opted to just brown the ground lamb instead of making meatballs.  (This means I eliminated the egg, bread crumbs and yogurt).  Sautee the eggplant, garlic and onion in the same pan as the lamb you browned (I set the lamb aside in the strainer).  Add all the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer until desirable consistency.  
Served with brown rice and roasted curried cauliflower.
Garnished with plain greek yogurt and mint.
Thank you for this winner!

I made this tonight with yellow saffron rice and the Syrian Green Beans (also on this site). What a fantastic combination. Everyone in the family loves it, my daughter felt it was a little too spicy for her but my husband and I thought it was perfect. will definitely make again. My husband said it was so good if he didnâ€™t see me making it he would have sworn it came from an ethnic families house. He said I tasted like a family home recipe from the Middle East. We absolutely loved it.

Lamb, cumin, cinnamon, coriander, etc.! I made my daughter and husband taste them straight out of the oven. They could have slapped me, and I would not have blamed them; they were that good. Please at least try a couple straight out of the oven without the sauce to appreciate the spices with the lamb. Heaven! These are the best meatballs I have ever eaten, and ground beef would only disappoint me now. I am never looking back. Lamb is now my meat of choice for meatballs.

My 3rd time making this and they never disappoint. Husband is die hard traditional Italian foodie and loves them. Cannot say enough. The perfect blend of spice and sauce. Have made with lamb, beef and beef/veal/pork mix and all are equally incredible. Thank you for this!

Fantastic! Based on previous reviews and what I saw in the video, I decided to double the sauce ingredients. Made it with chef johns rice pilaf for one delicious dinner! Next time I will omit the mint at the end (didn't agree with stomach) but other than that this one is a keeper!

WOW, Chef John. This was fantastic. It's too good to be found on just any restaurant menu. You've simply gotta make it to believe how different, tasty, and scrumptious this is. Served over rice pilaf is a must.  And don't forget the fresh mint chiffonade that brings it all together.

I bought ready made spicy lamb meatballs - quite easy to get (marks and spencer and Waitrose) and makes me a lot more enthusiastic about making this, especially as I can pre-prepare the sauce.  Also a portion of the whole sauce (with home made marinara) put aside before adding meatballs for the vegetarians.  Added chopped buffalo mozzarella with the mint to both sauces just before serving.  Stress free supper with friends.

Loved the lamb meatballs but using marinara sauce gave it an Italian flavor that didn't match the more Indian flavored meatballs. To correct this I added some red curry paste, some coconut milk, and Garam masala. Served over Basmati rice and it was incredible.  Almost forgot the most important part... my husband hates eggplant while I love it so I purÃ©ed the eggplant into the sauce near the end of cooking. I could still taste the eggplant and he never knew it was there. He just said it was wonderful and I should make it again.

It could be that eggplants are bigger in my neck of the woods, but the dish turned out for me more of an eggplant salad. I'm glad I used hamburger instead of ground lamb, because the focus of the dish as written is definitely the eggplant. A quarter of an eggplant would do if the meatballs were to be the center of the dish.

That said, I like eggplant fine and didn't mind an eggplant salad with tomato sauce. It still tasted good. It just wasn't what it was billed as.

Didn't have any lamb on hand but was looking to use up some eggplant. First time just made the sauce with less liquid and added some other veggies as a side dish. Second time I had some ground beef and was equally pleased with the result. Love the seasonings for the meat. Will definitely be making this again and next time exactly as written with lamb.

this dish is amazing.  i love big flavor, so i added more red pepper flakes to the sauce (1/2 tsp) and cayenne to the meatballs (1/4+ tsp).  i'm also a bit of a lazy cook, but thought the effort for this recipe was completely worth it.  I served this over spaghetti squash, but would be great over pasta or rice.  I will definitely make this dish again...soon.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and added 1 pound portobello  mushrooms.  I used sour cream in place of the greek yogurt because I didn't have yogurt. I only used one eggplant but wish I had used two.  I omitted the mint, didn't have any on hand but will try it next time.  My husband didn't care for the cinnamon but I thought it combined well with the other spices.

Really straightforward and tasty. I left out the cayenne in the meatballs (there were plenty of red pepper flakes in the sauce), but otherwise made it as is. Time consuming, but not at all difficult. Got rave reviews.  It also seems like something that would keep well if made ahead but I'll have to test that another time, since there weren't any leftovers!

This tasted amazing!!!  Left the yogurt, substituted the breadcrumbs for oatmeal, and made my own marinara sauce using a can of diced tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and seasonings.  Served it over spaghetti squash!  Will definitely keep this one.

This was delicious. I modified it for my daughter by removing the chili. Even without the heat, it was flavorful and lovely. It was a bit more work than most of my dinners, but well worth it.  Will definitely make again.

I made a version of the recipe I used all the ingredients but added mushrooms and potatoes to the sauce then served it with warm pita bread. The sauce was good for dipping the pita and I didin't need to serve it over rice because the potatoes were included in the sauce . I also added additional pepper flakes. It was spicy and filling.  I will make this again.

I had ground chicken instead of lamb, but I found this recipe very interesting, so I decided to try it and oooh yes it turned out fantastic (except for the meat, I followed everything precisely). I guess it's yogurt that gives the meatballs incredible tenderness and the spices combination is very nice and unique. Next time I'll double the ingredients and freeze them ahead. Chef John, you're the best!!!

This spice combination is a real winner. I have made this twice and the second time I used half lamb and half ground turkey thigh just cause I wanted to use up the turkey and make a larger batch. Just as nice..maybe even better! I can't tell you how many successes I've had with every Chef Johns recipes. They are always brilliant and easy. I ?? chef John!!!

This was delicious!  I increased the servings to 8 to feed my growing 15 year old son - who ate 3 plates by himself. Next time I make it I'm going to decrease the cumin as it was a little strong, but I'm pretty sure that was a result of improper measuring on my part. Great dish, this is going to become a family favorite.

I made the meatballs only to put in pita breads with spinach and a sauce of plain yogurt and lemon juice.  This recipe rocks!  Thanks Chef John!

Delicious!  Followed recipe for the most part but added 1/2 lb ground turkey to extend recipe. Am on Weight Watchers so made a few changes. Added 1/2 can Rotelle which i had in freezer and 28oz. can of diced tomatoes in place of "marinara"  Did not saute veggies in olive oil--just dumped all together.   Lightened up by using fat free sour cream in place of Greek yogurt (that's what i had on hand) & Egg Beaters in place of egg, and low sodium vegetable broth.  Added 1/2 lb mushrooms.  The liquid cooked down somewhat but I felt this made the sauce chunkier, which i liked.  I like the taste and texture of this sauce.

Reasonably simple to make, as I find most of the recipes here at allrecipes,com to be. As ever, the flavor profiles created here are at least measurably familiar to the cuisine they are supposed to be emulating and this one does so, as well.

I did find that I needed to add more liquid once the sauce had been reduced by half--opted for additional marinara sauce a it turned out. Pretty good. A bit of time more than I was inclined to put in tonight, but still, not bad.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I forgot to buy Marinara sauce, so tonight I used around 3/4 of a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and a few squirts of Amore tomato paste.  I think I like this a little more than the marinara.  LOVE THIS!!!  (I also love Chef John's recipe for Lamb Shanks Vindaloo.  Incredible!)

This was a big hit around our house, made exactly as per the recipe. Lamb, tomatoes, eggplant and middle eastern spices - what's not to like?

As a bonus, I've also made the sauce without the meatballs, but adding the pepper, cinnamon, coriander and cumin from the meatballs.  Cooked longer, until it's very thick, it makes a great side dish.

EDIT:  I've made this several times now, and it never fails to get rave reviews from guests.  Definitely a winner.

I left out the egg plant and used squash instead - fabulous. Really good "soup" or put over rice or other vegetables. Lots of juice.

Everyone loved this dish. Another winner from Chef John. The mini lamb meatballs came out very tender and juicy. It is a perfect meal for 3-4 people. The eggplant sauce was just has right amount of spice. A plus is that the meat balls didn't take very long to make, the squeezing method works very well. Carry on Chef John. I am a fan.

Just made tonight and the sauce itself is wonderfully delicious and I could eat it on its own. I had to substitute ground pork for lamb as my store was out of ground lamb, but still very good. Only negative thing is that in my opinion there is way too much salt in the meatball mixture, other than that I will be making again....and again, and doubling the eggplant/sauce part of it!! I ate mine over top of jasmine rice tonight. Yummy!

AMAZING! To make this gluten free, I subbed a frozen GF waffle (just chopped it in my food processor) for the bread crumbs and I used sour cream in lieu of the greek yogurt. I also added A LOT of crushed red peppers. Very spicy - just the way I like it! Because I made these as an appetizer for a party and I was running errands, I made the sauce on the stove top and baked the meatballs as directed. But instead of adding the 'balls to the sauce on the stove top, I poured the hot sauce over the meatballs and continued baking  (eventually bringing the temp down to 375) for about 30 minutes. Rave reviews! This is totally a great way to use a random eggplant.
