Someone asked what cranberry beans are. I had to look them up. They can be substituted with pinto beans. 
I make a recipe similar to this and it is delish ! Im not sure about the amount of oregano though, that would be a bit to metallic of a taste for my liking. I will definitely try this recipe soon.
here is a link to cranberry beans

Delicious soup. I don’t have a pressure cooker so I made this on top of the stove.
I could not find dried cranberry beans, so I subbed red kidney beans.I also cut back on the oregano, used 1 tablespoon, which worked for us.
I did not add the elbow pasta, I cook it separate from the soup and add it to the bowl then add the soup.
The aroma of this cooking was wonderful and made my kitchen smell so very good. Reminded me of my mom’s kitchen growing up..I did not add the cheese(dietary issues)
Will definitely make this again.
Thank you  Buckwheat Queen for  this delicious recipe.

This soup was good but I expected more after reading the 5 star reviews. I did make a few changes as recommended in a couple of reviews. I used Cannelli Beans instead of the Crandberry and back on the oregano. The taste was just average to me.

Delicious, perfect cold weather soup!  Made a few minor changes:  Used drained canned cannelloni beans  and diced butternut squash had on hand  instead of pumpkin.  Also and added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. and cooked up regular elbow pasta, have no problem with gluten.  Will be making this often.
Thanks
