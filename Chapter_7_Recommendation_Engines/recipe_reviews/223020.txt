These need a little help in the flavor department.  Lime? paprika?  seafood seasoning?  Something!  They were certainly easy but overall lacking in flavor.

1-30-2016 ~More often than not a great dish comes about from just a few simple, quality ingredients.  Fish and seafood in particular, are best simply prepared with a light seasoning to preserve their delicate flavor.  I prepared this as the recipe directed, although I skipped the step of heating the garlic and oil.  I found the instructions to soak the skewers as well as the cooking time informative and spot on for the inexperienced cook who would appreciate them for eliminating the guesswork.  I served this over linguine with clams and it was just what we were after - flavorful, sweet shrimp, simply seasoned and perfectly cooked.

Perfection...easy and great tasting.  I let the oil cool and then marinated the shrimp in it until I was ready to grill, for maximum flavour.  I added some freshly chopped parsley for colour.
