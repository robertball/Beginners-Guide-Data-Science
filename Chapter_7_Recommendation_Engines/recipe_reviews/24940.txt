This was a holiday tradition with my father. If you're concerned about the eggs, not to worry. Don't use them. Similar recipes call for a pinch of salt, too. But I use just milk, sugar, vanilla and snow. Tastes great. Also, regular milk works fine if you don't have evaporated milk. As for clean snow, when it starts snowing a good, fluffy snow coming straight down, we put a large pan outside to catch clean snow. If there's 4-6 inches on the ground, you can skim off the top. Don't try to use a blowing snow or snow that's been on the ground a couple of days. You need a dry, fluffy snow.

There certainly has been enough snow on the east coast for this.  Here is an idea for the eggs:  buy pasteurized egg product in a carton in the refrigerated section of the supermarket.  They're real eggs -- just pasteurized and safe to use.

I love snow ice cream. I don't measure out my vanilla..I just pour a little in there. This is how I traditionally make it, but there is another recipe for snow ice cream on this site that does not require raw eggs..which is probably a little safer for children. We've had plenty of snow on the east coast lately...and this is a terrific way to use it.

Great recipe!  If you don't have evaporated milk, you can substitute Eagle Brand, heavy cream, or a mixture of the two for the evaporated milk.  The snow waters down the taste, so the richer you can make this, the better!

I have been looking for someone else who makes this recipe for years. I think my friends thought I was making this up! 

Nice to see it listed, and also nice to see it stipulated that it is NOT MEANT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.

Certainly dangerous for any 3 and younger...but delicious.

Pretty good!  Before I added the milk mixture to the snow, I divided it in half and stirred about 1/2 c. melted chocolate chips to half the mixture.  I used each mixture on half the snow, creating vanilla and chocolate ice cream - and the chocolate chips didn't dissolve all the way, so it was almost like chocolate chocolate chip ice cream!  A fun experiment.

Great recipe! Even better than the snow ice cream from my youth! If you're concerened about salmonella (an issue for those with weak immune systems or the elderly or very young) then use an egg substitute.

I used to love snow cream, however living in areas with acid rain and a lot of pollution... probably wouldn't recommend it.

Oh wow...sooooo easy! We live in the south and rarely get snow but we got lots of snow at the end of January so I made this for my kids. They were amazed and thought that I was a genius.

This recipe really wasn't to my liking. My kids thought it was okay but not one said it was good. My mom always made snow ice cream with evaporated milk when I was a kid. I've never had it with eggs and for some reason mine was grainy with sugar. Which I'm not sure why the sugar didn't breakdown. But yet I could hardly taste the vanilla and it really wasn't sweet. Made it exactly and my husband said it really so so. I felt it needed more sugar and more vanilla and maybe leave out the eggs. But I can't say I'd maked this again. I actually prefer the other snow ice cream recipe on this site then this one. Thanks  for posting the recipe though.

Make sure you wait until after the first deep snowfall before gathering snow. I never use eggs while making snow cream, and add the vanilla and sugar to taste. Evaporated milk gives a creamier texture than milk. For an extra treat, stir in wild berries. Store leftover snow cream in the freezer. This is a winter treat for all ages.

Just like I remember as a kid! I grew up in Colorado and had this often. I don't like sweets but enjoyed this one for the fun in it. I moved away years ago and hadn't had this in 25 years and boy did it ever bring back memories of good times. LOVED IT! The raw eggs might have typically made me nervous but I have hens and used their fresh eggs and it didn't bother me one bit.

I love this recipe!  I did revise it a bit, and instead of using the evaporated milk I used liquid coffee creamer.  I used the french vanilla flavor with a little of the vanilla cinnamon.   I also decreased the vanilla extract.  The kids loved it!

This was like my Mom used to make for me when I was just a child!!  I mixed the eggs w/an electric mixer 1st, then I added the rest of the ingred. & mixed til blended well. I used 2% milk.Then I slowly added the snow & just blended/mixed/ & stirred til it was like a Slurpee.  It was great!!  Just the way I remembered it!!  Now I make it for my kids & they LOVE it too!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  My Mom always said the snow was cold enough to "cook" the eggs.  Don't know, but we Never got sick from it.  It was just too good not to eat it!!

Made chocolate snow cream by adding cocoa to the existing recipe. The kids loved collecting the snow, making, and eating it!  We rarely get snow in Virginia Beach and the kids loved this recipe SO much they packed snow in the freezer so they could make it later in the week!

I don't really think it's ever safe to consume raw eggs anymore, so this mix (minus the snow and vanilla) is best prepared in advance. I put it all in a Pyrex bowl in the microwave, stirring often, to heat up the mix and dissolve the sugar. Heat and stir until hot, but eggs aren't quite cooked. Allow to cool in refrigerator. Add vanilla right before mixing into snow.

I went into this with very low expectations.  We were all pleasantly surprised.  Excellent vanilla flavor.  Consistency is more like melted soft serve than regular ice cream...but the flavor is wonderful!  A great activity to do with the kids while snowed in!!!

We used to always made this when we were children and now I make it for my children. We live in Va so snow is plentiful. Our Reciepe: (SNOW CREAM)-- 2 CUPS SUGAR...1 CAN EVAPORATED MILK...1 EGG...1 TEASPOON VANILLA. IN LARGE BOWL BEAT EGG..ADD MILK, SUGAR & VANILLA, MIX WELL, THEN FOLD IN SNOW UNTIL IT GETS THICK...YOU WANT IT THICK. YOU CAN MAKE SEVERAL BATCHES AND FREEZE IT. Its best when you eat it after being frozen for a while. When its hard.

This is so very close to the recipe I grew up with!!! My Mom's recipe uses 3 eggs instead of 2 also she added a box of ice cream powder and 2 TBS vanilla, 1 cup of sugar.  i am sure the flavor is about the same.  It is soooo good!!

I only had egg beaters, instead of whole eggs + yolk (to give it that nice off-yellow color).   Fortunately, I found some yellow snow that worked just great!

This recipe was great! I ended up using more snow than it called for, so be sure to have extra on hand when preparing this to avoid having to go back out for more (like I did). I also melted the sugar before stirring it in, to avoid the grainy texture.

I'll definitely save this recipe for later!

Kids love it when we get a foot of snow, means mom will make Snow Ice Cream!  If you have issues using raw eggs, you can always temper them.  Heat the milk to boiling, then very slowly, add the hot milk to the eggs, beating the whole time.  This will "cook" the eggs.  Then cool it down in the fridge before making the snow ice cream.

we always cooked our eggs with the milk, sugar, and vanilla.cooled it in the freezer then mixed in the snow. living in Mississippi we didn't get to fix it much but when we did it was a wonderful treat. Always makes me think of my long gone Mother and daddy back in the 50's.

If it isnt actually snowing, go to your local snow cone stand and buy plain ice. (Bahama Bucks in my town)

This recipe is so simple and yummy after a snowfall.  Because we have little children, we always use pasteurized eggs just to be safe.

This is a great activity to do with kids on snow days!! My sister and I use to love making snow ice cream when we didn't have school. Our recipe had creamer instead of milk and no eggs. All the recipes are about the same though! Add food color to give it a great look. I promise kids will love it!

I used Eggbeaters for the eggs and chilled all ingredients first including the sugar and mixing bowl. This ensured I needed minimal snow and kept the flavor from being watered down. I was very suprised, it was awesome! Tasted as good as Breyer's vanilla bean.
