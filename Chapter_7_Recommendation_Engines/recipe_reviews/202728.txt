I submitted this recipe and wanted to add some tips that were lost in editing.  Don't brown the chicken until no longer pink in the center or it will be dry upon serving.  Just carmelize all sides and when the chicken is added back into the soup later , it will then cook all the way through & still be moist.  2" cubes for the chicken are too big, try a little smaller, but larger chunks do stay moist.  Thighs would be great too.  Only saute your garlic for 30 seconds or less!  Also, oil should always be added to a HOT pot or your food may stick.  I hope you enjoy!  Thanks for trying it!  :o)  UPDATE**  I've found that I prefer americanized chorizo, like Johnsonville's.  One of the mexican chorizos I tried lacked any texture at all and melted into a slurry with no recognizable chunks.  Since submission, I've tried this with shrimp instead of chicken & I LOVE it... much better & it's faster!  I saute 1/4c. chopped onions in the oil/butter and then start the chorizo.  I marinate the shrimp using the "Spicy Grilled Shrimp" from this site for about 10 min.,  just dumping the shrimp & marinade into the soup after the added cream comes to a boil. Turn off the heat, cover, & the shrimp will cook perfectly in the hot soup in about 7-10 minutes.  2 cups of minute rice thrown in with the shrimp cooks perfectly too.  It's awesome!!

I try 2 - 3 recipes a week from allrecipes.com but this one, oh my...I just couldn't keep my thoughts to myself about this one.  I was skeptical that the melding of the flavors would be good, but they were beyond good.  This is one of the most exceptionally good recipes I have ever tried.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.  It is on the spicy side, so it's not for the faint of heart.  Superb, stupendous and totally delicious!  My husband immediately put it in his top 5 of all time.  The ONLY thing I would change is not to add the garlic salt but rather just some more fresh garlic.  It was a bit too salty for me.  And, as the original author of the recipe said, I did cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I will be making it very often.

I did this in a slow cooker and added celery and potatoes and it turned out very good. I topped it with hot peppers, cilantro, cheddar cheese, sliced black olives, and green onions.

I used pre-cooked shredded chicken that I had in the freezer, (I'm working my way through using what's in the deep freeze), used organic chicken broth, used 6 more cloves of garlic, one really big yellow onion, added two very large chopped zucchini and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I did add the cheese to the soup and then tried it and felt it didn't need the cream. After taste testing it, I did add cumin, california chili powder and fresh cilantro. Excellent soup.....great for the low-carber. Even my husband, the soup hater, said that it was really good. I know I made a couple changes here and there but it was to clean out my deep freeze and to use up some of my excess zucchini/veggies. Makes a lot, so if you don't eat soup twice a day......make sure you have enough freezer containers.

Very good.  I used a can of Rotel tomatoes with sliced green chilies, mushrooms, celery and a Mexican chorizo.  I also added parsley and the additional to the topping was green scallions.    I sauteed the veggies first, then added the  chorizo, then the chicken, then the other ingredients.  One pot was used = less mess to clean up.

I'd give this 6 stars if I could! Just made it- SOO delicious! I added some veggies and used coconut milk in place of cream. Turned out fabulous. Definitely a keeper and will make this again and again! Thank you!

Don't look at the nutritional info or you might miss out on a really yummy soup.  It's like a spicy mexican chowder to me.  I didn't even have chorizo (store was out of it) so I used a spicy cajun sausage, and it was still good.  I also think it would be really great with some shrimp.  It was already pretty spicy, so I used some cheddar instead of monterey jack cheese for a garnish, but honestly it didn't need anything.  It was good just the way it was.

As Fat~dog~Lane suggested I added shrimp..  I had 1 boneless skinless breast that needed cooking also....  so I put it in also...  I used a can of "rotel" for my tomatoes...  I did add some onion as FDL suggested also.. Bout 1 1/2# of shrimp, which I put in in the last 10 mins...  Oh yeah, I added a can of black soybeans...  Homemade chicken broth also...  Very tastey...  very low carb....  I also  think this would taste good thickend a bit and served over rice.......

Very good!  I made a lot of substitutions, so it's a bit unfair to rate it, but it was really tasty.
I used leftover rotisserie chicken instead of the chicken breasts and chicken kielbasa because my husband doesn't eat pork or beef.  I sauteed the garlic and then threw the leftover rotisserie chicken in and added the chicken stock.  I added the Worcestershire to the stock.  It was not very spicy, as the kielbasa isn't spicy, but my picky eaters loved it!

I loved this. The leftovers went into the freezer to eat at another time. I just wish I could have found the right chorizo, because mine just turned into a meat slurry. But no matter, was still good.

Used Mexican chorizo, had only plain tomatoes. Pretty good topped with black olives, the cheese, sour cream, and cilantro. Probably will make again, at least to use of my chorizo, if nothing else. I like it...

Made this last night and it was DELICIOUS.  Very easy to put together and loved the aroma throughout the house.  I used 2 cans of hot rotel and 3 cups of chicken stock. Added some cilantro as garnish along with the cheese and sour cream.  Will be making again--thanks for the recipe!

I like a heartier soup, so I chose to shred the chicken, add frozen corn, double the chorizo, and substitute milk for the cream.  I have yet to find someone who doesn't like this!  Yum!

I know people get mad when you change a recipe around alot, but I made one change that I think really worked: The soup was really thin, lacking the right texture, so I added 1 cup of white long grain rice & cooked it for 20 minutes.  Then added the cream.  It was fantastic!  Just the right thickness & all done in one pot!

Seems like the chicken chunks are way too big.  Really 2" cubes?  I cut to 1 to 1-1/2" and thought it was still too big.  Next time I will make 3/4" or so.  On the flavor side, 3 out of 4 in my family liked it.  It has a lot of flavor for a low-carb offering.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe as written to begin with. Ingredient portions seem to be spot on. I used pork chorizo. It just melted into the broth and provided beautiful color. THEN... I added sautéed red bell pepper and onions for extra flavor before serving. I think tomorrow I'll add corn and serve it over rice. Should be a fantastic leftover soup.

The SO just called home.  "I'm eating the soup.  Wow!  This is a keeper."

Modifications made:
*  Instead of browning the chicken, I added the breasts with the broth and tomatoes.  Once cooked, they were removed, shredded, and added back to the mix.
*  Used a tin of plain, chopped tomatoes and a few dashes of hot sauce.
*  No salt was used.  Used addl. fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder/salt.
*  Skipped the cream and garnishes.  Added cilantro.
*  Added a can of corn, 3 stalks of celery, and two small onions.

Very good way to use up chorizo and chicken breast, which were the search terms that led to this recipe. I added two stalks of corn (kernels removed by knife) and since I only had regular diced tomatoes, I added oregano and canned diced jalapeños to add more flavor depth and some great spice. I also added a little table cream, shredded Mexican cheese and a few crumbled corn chips to my bowl (I prefer not to add cream to hot soup still in the pan, or to reheat soups with cream as an ingredient, as it always tends to curdle). Very good soup recipe, thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  Perfect for a football weekend (but here I made it in August).
Made little biscuits to go along with the great spicy flavor

I followed the recipe. It had a great flavor and a beautiful color. I can even add to it to dress it up for company. My sister who does not like soup tried it and liked it. The only thing I would change is the sour cream. I found that it muffled the other flavors. Tip for those who find it to spicy, put a little honey in it. You can mix it right in the bowl then put the cheese on. Thanks for a recipe that I will make over and over.

I've made this several times and it's a family favorite! As another reviewer suggested, I use coconut milk instead of heavy cream and it gives it a wonderful flavor. I boil and shred the chicken instead of cube it, and I also add hominy and jalapeno. I think the Mexican chorizo, not the American chorizo (sausage), is a must. To garnish I add sour cream, jalapeno, cilantro, and chopped onion. This is so easy!

Absolutely delicious when made with the shrimp and minute rice like the author mentioned in their comments, instead of chicken.  It's like a gourmet soup from a nice restaurant.

Very good...easy weeknight meal. Added 1/2 lb. shrimp (at the end) to soup. Also added extra can of rotel tomatoes because we like our food spicy! Will definitely make again.

Love, love, love this soup! I've tried it with both chicken and shrimp and prefer the chicken.  I use a whole pound of chorizo plus I add in some onion and peppers just because I like them. I've also used shredded rotisserie chicken and that works great. Amazing recipe!

Absolutely LOVED this recipe. It was even "Man Approved" by my picky husband and brother-in-law (because I put the Rotel in the blender so they wouldn't see veggies floating in the soup).
I couldn't find chorizo, so I used Chipotle Monterrey Jack chicken sausage instead (It's made by Johnsonville). It has 1/3 the fat and a nice zing to it!
Next time I will skip cubing the chicken and just toss in whole pieces to boil and shred.

This is a very good soup, although I generally prefer my soup to have some vegetables in it. The chorizo gave it some nice heat, though after adding sour cream at the table it is spot on. I will definitely be making this again, although I may modify it to include some vegetables.

Incredible recipe!  Perfect amount of spice.  I only added some onion and pasta.  Unfortunately, I added the pasta to the soup as it cooked and it soaked up most of the liquid.  Next time I make it I will make the soup pasta on the side and add to the dishes before serving.  Seriously absolutely amazing recipe... and it's delicious WITHOUT the garnishes!  But hey, I like spice :)  Thanks for the wonderful addition to my recipe book!

Good 'chowder-like' soup. Here are my changes: Boil a fryer chicken in stock instead of chicken breast, cool then strip from the bones and cut into smaller pieces (it costs so much less!) 2 10oz cans of Rotelle tomatoes 1 15oz can of either pinto beans or black beans, rinsed (add at the same time as the tomatoes)

I made this last night and it was FABULOUS!  Like other reviewers I did tweak it to make it my own:  2 potatoes cut into cubes, 1 small bag of frozen corn, 1 can green chiles and 2 packets of chicken bouillon b/c I didn't have any broth and 1 T of dried, chopped onions b/c I didn't feel like chopping an onion!  :)  I am not kidding, this one was great!

I tried this tonight and it was very good.  I usually make a recipe as is the first time but I did make a few adjustments.  Instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder and omitted the salt all together.  I also used low sodium broth.  The Worcestershire sauce and sausage are plenty salty for my taste.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I used a cup of 2% milk with a couple tablespoons of corn starch as a substitute.  I added a package of gnocchi at the very end and also wilted in a bag of baby spinach for a complete all in one pot meal.  Excellent flavor!!
