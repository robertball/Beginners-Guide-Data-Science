This is wonderful! I didn’t have quinoa so I used couscous, next time I won’t use the entire box so there is more of the veggie mixture in it.  I also used one acorn squash that I partially peeled, sliced in thick chunks, took out the seed, drizzled with olive oil and baked at 400 until tender and brown. We serve them along side and they were pretty and delicious

I liked the fundamentals of this recipe- acorn squash stuffed with spinach and cheese.  I did make a lot of personal tweaks though.  I omitted the almonds alltogether because I personally do not enjoy nuts in my food. For the spices send herbs I added fresh basil, smoked paprika, and a dash of cinnamon.  In the filling I also added a squeeze of lemon juice and smoked cheddar cheese in addition to the ricotta and parmesean. The recipe turned out great! Creamy, cheesy, smoky, and herby!
