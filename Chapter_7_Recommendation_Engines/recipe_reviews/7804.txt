I had high hopes for this recipe after reading all the reviews. They were all right - this cake is very rich and very good. Everyone loved it. 

I thought that it was just okay, since it tastes like a cream cheese brownie, and I don't particularly like cream cheese brownies.

If you really want to get the cake experience with this recipe, I'd recommend baking it in a 9-inch round cake or springform pan. The brown and white looks good together and it makes for a tall cake.

There is a topping for this recipe (original). 1- 8 oz. box of Cool Whip, 1/2 cup pecan pieces, 1 cup coconut all mixed well and spread over cooled cake. Then sprinkle with 2 grated Hershey's Milk Chocolate bars. This makes it completely awesome!!

Excellent and very rich. While I am sure it is great as is, I doubled the cream cheese,added an extra egg and a teaspoon of vanilla, but kept the sugar the same. My family loved it.

We loved this recipe, try it with a butter pecan flavor cake mix and put some pecans on top.  Tasted like a really rich pecan pie.(p.s. just made it again for my sister, accidentally cooked for 1 hour and 15 minutes, thought I burned it but was still really good. Guess you can't ruin this one.)

When they say that this cake is REALLY REALLY SWEET and is more like a brownie, TAKE HEED!!  I even used 1/2 cup less powdered sugar.  I also added one egg and 1/2 cup water to the cake mixture because I wanted it more cakey.  I also didn't like the way the topping was too crispy on the top.  I guess what I was thinking of was a more cream cheesy, softer, topping and this definitely was not that.  I'll pass on making it again..

I had high hopes for this, but was disappointed. Maybe I should have done it in a smaller pan.  It was like brownies with this white creamy frosting that never really stayed put.  Next time I might try it with a 9x9 or 8x8 as suggested for a "taller" cake.  I thought the flavor was fine, but nothing amazing.

I have just found this website. I was looking for something easy, fast and yummy. I read all the ratings and picked this cake. I was very unhappy. I should have stopped after I read the 4 cups of sugar. It is WAY TOO rich and sweet, there is just TOO MUCH sugar, even for my husband who normally eats everything. Sorry!!!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday 4 months ago and he took it with him to work. His coworkers have said recently that they still think about this cake and that it's the best cake ever! My husband has requested it several times since his birthday. Very rich and very good!

I made this for a fish boil at the local fire department.  It isn't really cake-like at all...more like a bar.  I wasn't too excited about it, but my husband is a big fan of them.  Next time, I'll lower the temperature of the oven, and keep them in a little longer.  They were very done around the edges, and barely done in the middle.  I'll be making it again for my husband.

This is so easy and delicious...I love to bake, but I am trying to lose some baby weight, so I bake things and take them to work-this dissapeared in an instant! Everyone was raving about it and asking for the recipe...I will definately make this again!!

I expected a little more flavor, but was overall very happy with them. My friends and I had a brownie bake off, and mine ended up being my favorite. I think I'll try using different flavored cake mixes for variations.

I made this cake for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it.  I wish I had made it and served it the same day.  I think it would have been better. One friend warmed her piece and said it was wonderful.  Great recipe!!

THIS IS WONDERFUL!! IT'S MORE OF A BROWNIE TOPPED WITH CHEESECAKE DESSERT THAN CAKE (AS OTHERS HAD MENTIONED). BUT IT IS TRULY WONDERFUL. MY SISTER IN LAW EVEN CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY TO RAVE ABOUT IT. MY HUSBAND SAID IT WAS A LITTLE TO CHOCOLATY FOR HIM, BUT THAT IT WAS YUMMY. I MADE THIS IN A 10 INCH ROUND CAKE PAN, SINCE I MADE IT FOR A BIRTHDAY. I REALLY LIKED THE PRESENTATION THAT WAY.

I was expecting a cake, but after looking at the ingredient list and reading the reviews, I have to agree that this is more like a bar than a cake recipe.  We found this to be very sweet, so all around we were a little disappointed.

This is an easy, tasty dessert.  The dough is a little hard to mix at first, but otherwise, it's a snap.  I've used several types of cake mix (my husband loves french vanilla, I go for devil's food) and it's always very good.

This was very easy to make.
I think it turned out more like brownies, not a cake. I made it as a "Thankyou gift" for a friend, and she LOVED IT!
I cut them into squares, and kept a few for myself. I couldn't keep my hands off them either.
Good recipe. I will use this recipe again.

When I started making it I thought I was doing it wrong because the bottom layer was so dense but apparently not. Everyone at work was going crazy, I didn't taste it because I do not like chocolate but it was gone in about 15mins, everyone had 2 or more pieces and were raving about it. Very easy to make. More like brownies than a cake though.

I, too, had high hopes for this recipe.  I failed to notice that it called for 4 CUPS of powdered sugar until it came time to add it.  SO, it was no surprise that the finished cake was way too sweet.  For people who like sickeningly sweet desserts, this would be a good one.

VERY GOOD! I cooked a bit longer in an 8x8 caserole dish and used pecans instead of walnuts. Wonderful!
Thank you for the recipe.

WOW this stuff was SWEET. Good, but SWEET. This is really a brownie, not a cake. A little goes a LONG way. Good None-The-Less but I do believe the title should have stated brownie.  Everyone seems to like it (in very small amounts) so I would make it again.

This is definately more like a brownies than a cake, but the real issue for me was that the topping didn't have enough cream cheese taste.  Won't make it again.  :(
