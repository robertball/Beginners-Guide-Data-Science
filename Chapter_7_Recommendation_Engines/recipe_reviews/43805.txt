I have been making this from a recipe book for a while and this is so much easier! Just as delicious too. I had to make my own curry powder using 2 tsp. ground coriander, 1 tsp. ground cumin, 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp. turmeric, 1/4 tsp. ground ginger. Thanks for sharing.

I skipped the whole long tofu draining and freezing step and it still came out great. I'll make it again.

Nummy Nummy In My Tummy, as my 10-year-old says!  
I did use the recommended 1c. vegetable broth (from cube); I mixed the curry powder and 1 tsp ground cayenne (our family loves spicy food!) into the broth, along with two T whole-wheat flour to help thicken it back up a smidge; might should have used cornstarch instead.  Stirred the broth in with the tomatoes (I used canned diced ... much easier).  Served over steamed basmati rice with naan (gotta have those carbs).
Was even better next day, reheated ... flavors merged nicely.
Thanks very much!!!!!

This is a quick and easy recipe for tofu.  My husband and I really enjoy it.  I used minced ginger from a jar and omitted the jalapeno pepper.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a whole can of diced tomatoes.  I can see why other reviewers would have found it dry without the extra liquid.  Great over rice, and even better the next day for lunch!

This recipie has great flavour, I think even people who don't care for tofu would love it! I served it over rice, but I think it would be great with naan as well.

This dish is excellent! My husband thought it was chicken until I told him it was tofu. I am new to tofu. I love indian food, so if you love the curry taste, you'll love this recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. Some additions and changes that I've made: first, I only had completely pulverized tomatoes, so I used them--they work great. My second time making this recipe I added grated zucchini and carrot, plus chopped red peppers, to the onion phase of cooking. The taste was excellent, and my boy friend who's just starting to eat healthy didn't even know he was eating the extra veggie content!

Not great, but not horrid. We served with a side of rice, and in the end mixed them together for a bit more texture- then it was okay.

Sadly, I think this is my lowest rated recipe so far! I wanted to like this so much, but even with adding to it after it was done there just wasn't much flavor to this at all. I tried it the way it was written and then added veggie broth and then added a myriad of spices, but it just wasn't the recipe we were hoping for. I'll keep looking!

I have made this recipe three times in two months and it is ALWAYS a hit. It is great when made exactly from this recipe but I also make a few changes.

First, I tend to add more of the spices because I like things with a ton of bite.  Second, it is even better with some cauliflower.  Yum!  The cauliflower absorbs the spices wonderfully.  I've never had this come out dry and the leftovers taste great!

smells really great and tastes pretty authentic. i added some extra peas. although i didn't, i wish i had put in some cornstarch also because it was a little runnier than curry's supposed to be.

I was very skeptical about this, it was my first time making/eating tofu and there were alot of mixed reviews about this dish. The only reason I decided to make it was because I had almost all of the ingredients. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it!! I made a few changes and it came out wonderful! I used olive oil instead of vegetable (and WAY less). I only used a few dashes of ground cumin, instead of seeds. I used alot more garlic, I can never get enough. 2 cups of peas. Instead of tomatoes I used a can of mexican diced tomatoes(it's what I had and I took the advice of others) and because of that, skipped the jalapeno pepper. I used ground ginger instead of fresh. Even with the diced tomatoes it appeared to be a little dry, so I poured in some chicken stock while it was cooking and that really helped. I ate it over red quinoa. I am still amazed at how much I enjoyed this. I can't wait to eat the leftovers later!

Used this as a base to a mystery recipe challenge, so made a few changes- changed cumin seeds to corriander seeds, doubled the garlic and ginger, added 1/2c ketchup (mystery ingredient) and 1 can diced tomatoes (omitting fresh tomato and salt).  Turned out fantastic!

This is so good! I really like the texture of the frozen/thawed tofu! The only thing I changed was not adding any oil, I just used a non-stick pan and it saved me a lot of calories per serving!

My husband and I DO NOT like tofu, but we love this dish. I serve it on top of basmati rice that I saute with cardamom pods, cloves, onions, and a cinnamon stick  before adding the water to cook the rice. (Cooks illustrated recipe) Oh, yeah, DO use diced tomatoes in the recipe instead of fresh.

New to the vegan diet and I thought it was WAY good. I highly recommend. I made this using ZERO oil. Just omit the oil all together and follow the recipe otherwise. Use a good pan and don't over-stir/over-flip/over-eff-with the dish while it's cooking. If it sticks a bit to the pan, scoot it over to the side and put a splash of water on the bare side of the pan. Scrape the yummy goodness up and mix it with your food. Voila! Clean pan and seasoning goes back into the tofu. Then do the same on the other side. Taking the oil out saves 360 calories in the total pan, 90 off each serving.

This was good, but I had to doctor it quite a bit.  Although, I made my curry from scratch so that might have a lot to do with it.  I would double the garlic and ginger, and it needs about a teaspoon of salt.  Maybe a high quality curry powder would make it better.  I also didn't use the tomatoes since my husband can't eat them.

This was pretty good, although not quite what I would consider Indian food. It's more its own, unique thing. I made a few changes: I used an entire 10oz package of peas, and doubled all of the spices, adding to that grated, fresh turmeric (about 2t total, it's strong), and a good pinch of asafetida. I added a little water to help the whole dish heat through without sticking to the pan (I don't use non-stick) and without having to up the oil. The water cooked off, making a nice thick dish. It's a really nice quick dish. Thanks!

I followed this recipe almost exactly as written and it turned out great. The only step I skipped was freezing the tofu and it didn't seem to make too much of a difference. I was worried that the dish was going to come out a little too dry in the end, but the tomatoes helped keep it juicy. Just make sure to keep the lid on the skillet after adding the tomatoes- this should help it from drying out.

I added more spice and more canned tomato's, as well as the chicken broth recommended by most. This was still very bland. I find when I mince tofu it's hard to bring out any flavours. If I attempt this recipe again I will probably cut into cubes.

Despite my love of both curries and tofu, i found this dish lacking  "something". It was  spicy but incredibly bland (how do you manage that?). I added a bit of veggie broth as suggested; i honestly did not see how you could eat it without. I would NOT make this again!

I really didn't like this...maybe I made it wrong I don't know. at first. I'm not really used to indian food, though-I tried to dilute the flavor a little with chicken broth, and then I thought it was too bland. Oh well. whatever went wrong was probably my fault. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

Okay, after I tweaked it.  I followed the recipe as written except to add a cup of broth as suggested by others.  Good call.  However, as is, it was very bland.  It wasn't until I added extra onion flakes, garlic powder and cumin that I could deam it ready.  This was something different, but not something I would make again.  Thanks though.

I thought this recipe was great. My husband does not like tomatoes so I added a little vegetable broth. I would have like to thicken the vegetable broth with a little cornstarch. I would definitely make this dish again.

I love tofu and I'm always looking for different ways to
cook them. I never thought of mincing tofu at all. Thought it was clever.  Overall, I thought this dish needed more ginger and salt. I wanted to add turmeric but I was out. I did not add peas because I didn't have any. Also, I felt it needed a bit of broth as well because it started to dry out with all the moisture being absorbed, so I added a quarter of  light coconut milk.  I will definately be keeping this recipe for my meatless meals. Thanks!

Great recipe. Good balance of flavors for the tofu. If you think it's too dry, try soaking the tofu shortly in some veggie broth before cooking.

As is the recipe was a little bit bland while at the same time being way too spicy. Next time I will increase the amount of curry and cumin seed, decrease the amount of jalapeno and add the vegetable broth thickened with flour that others recommended to make more of a sauce.  I might also add a small can of tomato sauce to get more of the tomato flavor to the curry as the one tomato included in the recipe did not really add much flavor to the dish.

Pretty good. I liked the diced tofu, I think I'll make my tofu curries that way from now on. I served mine on naan bread. I made a change though; I used a large can of low-sodium diced tomatoes. I prefer these to fresh when cooked. There was a fair amount of liquid, but that's what curries should be like because the rice or the bread soaks it up and adds flavour.

I wasn't that crazy about this... seemed a little bland to me.  Maybe it's just because regular meat keema was one of my favourite dishes as a child so I had high expectations.

This was my first time making this dish. I read a couple of the reviews and decided to add half of a red pepper, 3 small carrots, and extra peas. My husband and my son loved it. I really loved it.  I used store bought curry powder and powdered cumin, rather than the seeds. I love that I was able to make everything in one extra large skillet.
Going to put this in rotation. I must add that, I have exchanged meat for tofu for the past 3 weeks and I have lost a few inches...coupled with exercise and laying off the sweets and my more than occasional glass of wine.

I liked this recipe.  I used about a 1/4 tsp. of curry seeds and about a teaspoon of ground coriander.  I used a can of diced tomatoes without salt.  I ended up adding about a teaspoon of salt at end.  I accidentally added tomatoes with the tofu and curry and it was fine and it was not dry.  I left out jalepeno also.

This was quite good as it was an easy to prepare, with my only sub being green beans for the peas.  Next time I might puree a portion of the tomatoes to make it a little more saucy.

Taking the advice, I added some veggie broth along the way and I can really see how this could have turned out dry.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes and included the liquid from that.  I added more spices and all, because I always do, but I think this makes a really good base to start from.  I served over quinoa.

Delicious way to do tofu! Per advice from other commenters I popped open a can of veggie broth and wound up adding some so the keema wasn't dry, it definitely needed it I like it moist enough that it's easy to scoop with naan, but not soupy. Recommend cooking per instructions until you get to the lid-on for 15 minutes phase. Start adding veggie broth to taste (I checked it every five minutes and wound up adding around half of a 16oz can). I used cumin the spice because I couldn't find seeds at the local grocer, everyone had seconds. Will make again!

This was incredibly dry.  I added veggie broth and some tomato sauce in an attempt to save it, but then the spices weren't as balanced.  While I liked my result, it was pretty different than the recipe by the time I was done.  Also note that the jalapeno kind of overwhelmed the rest of the dish.  The Coconut Tofu Keema recipe on here was much better even though I used inferior curry for that one.  I made both but hoped this would be good because it was a lot less work, but in the end the extra work was well worth it.

Very easy to make. Didn't freeze the tofu, just pressed it for half an hour. Did the suggested 1 cup veggie broth - made it easy for pairing with quinoa and naan bread. Will add more curry powder next time.

Loved this.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, however, I didn't have cumin seeds.  I just threw in a little ground cumin.  I also used a can of diced tomatos instead of fresh tomatos.  I think this added the extra liquid that some of the other reviwers felt this dish was missing.  I added an extra teaspoon of minced ginger too. I really enjoy that flavor.  I served this over jasmine rice.  It was even better the next day for lunch.

Found this recipe when looking for more ways to use tofu. Followed the recipe exactly and the whole family enjoyed it. Lime Juice is a good addition to this and with rice makes a filling meal. Another great vegetarian recipe!

Not too bad, I guess, but nothing to write home about. While it was cooking for 15 minutes, I sporadically added small splashes from a cup of chicken broth, added 1/2 tsp of garlic salt, and a small dash of cayenne pepper.

I haven't tried freezing the tofu as recommended first, because I don't mind it's texture as is, but I really enjoy the flavors created by the ingredients in this recipe. In particular, the comino seeds add a fragrant aroma. As per others' advice, I added 1 cup veggie broth at the tomato stage. I also added some roasted cashews because I had them, and chopped cilantro because I like its flavor. I served this over brown rice for a tasty & filling meal.

Pretty good - you can't taste the tofu much at all (which I think is a good thing).  Definitely add some vegetable or chicken broth to juice it up a little.  Be warned, though: if you don't like spicy, you won't like this one.

Delicious! I added 1 chopped chicken breast marinated with cumin, ground ginger, and olive oil and added some chicken broth as others suggested. I used stewed tomatoes since I didn't have diced tomatoes but the end result? YUM!

Excellent!  It is even better with diced cooked chicken instead of tofu.
YUM!

This dish was a pleasure to make!  The tofu sops up all the flavours and fools people into thinking it's chicken.  I don't even need to eat this with rice.

After reading the reviews, I also added vegetable broth. I enjoyed this dish very much. My boyfriend didn't but he's not big on Indian cuisine. Since I'm the one who reviews...4 stars!
