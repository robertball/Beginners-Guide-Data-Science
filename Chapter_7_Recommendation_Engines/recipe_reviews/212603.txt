Thanks for the great recipe!  I sliced the potatoes so they would cook faster and it still took a little over an hour for these to cook in my oven.  Great flavor and quick prep time.

Yummy recipe, very filling! Few changes... I didn't have cream of broccoli so used a can of cream of chicken soup and mashed up some frozen broccoli and a little cheese with it, tasted great. Also didn't have red chili sauce so used some red pepper flakes, it definitely had a bite and was a big hit. I mixed in the Parmesan and cooked it in a slow cooker because I needed the oven for something else.

As written, this isn't really a stellar recipe- but it would be easy to take it to 5 stars.  Add 8 oz of chopped broccoli, 1/2 c shredded cheddar, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp dill, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to the potato and sauce mixture!
