I love papaya salad. But being in small-town Ohio, I had to improvise on some of the ingredients. I used Chayote squash instead of the long beans and crushed red pepper flakes instead of Thai chilli peppers. I didn't have the dried shrimp, but added cooked frozen shrimp. I loved it. Add more or less pepper flakes to taste.
