Blown away!! Hands down one of the best chili's I've ever ate. Used 1 can kidney and 1 can black beans, added some bell pepper, used all organic ingredients. The Jalapeño and smoked paprika really make the dish something special. This one's definitely a keeper and that's a first so far since becoming vegetarian. Thanks a lot stephlee12!!

Very tasty! Who would have thought vegan dishes can be delicious. You won't miss the meat in it! I used homegrown jalapeno pepper, sweet potatoes and tomatoes, which made me happy to be able to use produce from my garden. Made about 1.5 of the recipe. I didn't have vegetable broth on hand and substituted with vegetable base Better Than Bouillon", combination of kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans. No where in the instruction when to put tomato paste in, so I put it in with the sweet potatoes and spices. I also added a can of drained sweet corn at the end to balance the spices and heat. It turned out very good, nice and thick! Husband loved it as well. Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper!

I will definitely make it again. My family and I are new o the vegan life and this was so tasty it didn't leave me missing meat. I made some changes however : no jalapeño,  I used weet  bell peppers instead and only a few, I also used 1 can of black beans vs the suggested kidney kind, I used 2 fresh cut up tomatoes,  and a can of tomato paste, and organic corn too give it more sweetness  for my toddlers. together it took about 30 min I served it with brown rice and avocado.

engl219.J.L.

Let me start with this. I am an avid meat eater, hamburgers, hot dogs, Texas Roadhouse’s “fall of the bone ribs”; I eat it all. Then one day we had a party and guess what! It was all vegan. Have I ever had something vegan? No. Did I ever think that I really would? Not really.  But let me tell you something; this chili is amazing.  I was kinda skeptical but when I tried it they actually were not that bad. This chili tasted like any other chili that I had had beside it being meatless. 
I do not like sweet potatoes, and in this recipe there are a lot of them. They were used as the meat substitute. However, you couldn’t even really tell that they were in there. They were not to sweet and they soaked up all of the flavor of the rest of the chili. 
The base of the chili was really good. It has a few different types of beans and many vegetables. Also, if you cook it right it is not a watery chili. Let's be honest, who wants a watery chili. But, it also was not a super thick chili. All of the different veggies in it all went together perfectly. 
The chili wasn’t too spicy but it also was not bland. It had a perfect balance of spicy and savory with just a hint of sweet from the sweet potatoes. To garnish it, it says you can put in cheese and sorry cream. But this was a vegan party so we did vegan sour cream and vegan cheese which was just as good.
This chili was amazing. With its accents of different flavors but also the balance of flavors. It smelled amazing and that me

I made this using my slow cooker for a chili cook off at work.  It won hands down!!!  Added Beyond Beef crumbles so folks could have a little heartier chili.  To everyone’s surprise when I told them it was 100% vegan!  Will definitely make this again.

Took this to wrk, everyone thot it was great!  I didn’t have a jalapeño, so I used green chili powder.  Great flavor. It had a nice sweetness to it. I’m a carnivore, so next time ima add some burger. I’m sure it will still be awesome.

This was really good! I didn't have smoked paprika so I used sweet paprika and some chipotle spice blend with a dash of liquid smoke. Skipped the pepper flakes. I would make this again.

I just got finishing making this dish and I really like it. I used sweet peppers instead of hot ones since I dislike really spicy foods and it turned out good. :) Plus me and my husband are vegetarians and my mom is a Vegan so I'm very happy this will keep everyone happy. :3

This was really good. I would definitely make it again, with a few changes. I would use oil for the sauteeing of the onions. It seems like you are not going to have enough liquid, but you are - just. Relax and trust the recipe. I would simmer the tomatoes longer and add the potatoes later so as to lose the brassy tomato flavor that overwhelms the sweet potato flavor. My crew loved it, though, I'm just picky!

Absolutely delicious! This is going to sound crazy, but I went vegan 5 days ago and haven’t “cooked”’in about 3 years. This was so easy and fun to make - and rewarding. Textures are perfect. Flavor is right on. Not too spicy.

Excellent - a little spicy for my taste (but I have a low tolerance of hot dishes).  This, I used 1/2 of the chili powder.   Also added 3 sweet potatoes to make it thicker.   Other than this - followed recipe exactly and it turned out great!

This is a grest recipe. The combination of sweet potatoes with the spiced sauce is a big success. I used fresh tomatoes, fresh oregano and dried cooked beans rather than canned. I used all the tomato paste and cut down a bit on the chili. All in all it barely made it to the table. My son ate half out of the pot.

I have now made this multiple times, with one variation.  I use butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes.  The recipe was too sweet using only them.  I have used both half and half and still prefer the squash instead.

Really good!  I did add some crumbled extra firm tofu that I had in the fridge.  And I put it in my crock pot for 5 hours on high so all those flavors could really come out!

Amazing! I added another cup of vegetable broth becuase it was so chunky, but that's just my personal preference. My family enjoyed it so much as well, and they're the type to eat frozen dinners or just go out to eat.

Probably my favorite chili recipe period. This was my second time making it and it’s amazing! I did add a little salt and a handful of frozen corn at the end but didn’t change anything else! DELICIOUS!!

I suggest you can use some meatless crumbles or mash some pinto beans.  Also, I added some spinach and kale to this recipe.  Served with rice.

I am giving this 3 stars as I loved it, but my husband hated it.  He took one bite and held it in his mouth and talk to me through the food,"What is this?" I thought he was going to spit it out right then and there.  He's actually a pretty flexible eater, but this was NOT his idea of chili.  Too bad for me as I really thought it was great, but I can't eat it all myself as it makes a lot and we are empty nesters.

Excellent chili, just what the doctor ordered on this cool fall day.  The perfect blend of flavors.  I double the recipe to have extra for lunch this week and added two can each mushrooms and chickpeas for diversity.

This chili is great!  The only change I made was using dried jalapeno, since I didn't have a fresh pepper.  I was concerned about the amount of spices but the chili was amazing.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really easy and really delicious.  Only addition was a little Braggs at the end to round out the flavors.

Delicious and so healthy, I added  a touch of cocoa powder  to give it that decadent  taste without being sweet or overpowering!

This is our favourite vegan recipe. I use all the ingredients but I generally roast the sweet potato cubes separately instead of cooking them in the chili otherwise the sweet potato becomes mushy if over cooked. Roasting also speeds up the cooking time because the sweet potato cooks while you are making the rest of the dish. If roasting the sweet potato then you need to reduce the amount of liquid.

Great recipe for a delicious, hearty chili! Family definitely enjoyed it. Some minor change to recipe- no jalapenos.

It turned out great! Next time though I’ll need to cut back on the liquids because my 6 quart instant pot is too small.

The recipe is OK at best, maybe over spiced? Not sure why I'm the only reviewer who didn't care for it...

I'm not always thrilled with vegan options - but this is really good.   I added some navy beans, red bell pepper as well.  Went heavy with the chili powder and red pepper flakes.  Vegan daughter loved it!

Warms your belly! Made it exactly as the recipe states. YUMMY! My daughter is a vegan and loves spicy foods. I made this for the family and my husband is not vegan, so I made summer sausage on the side for him. And, I don't eat meat, but I'm not totally vegan, so I put it on blue organic corn chips and a spoon of sour cream. Absolutely wonderful! Great protein and great flavor. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

Yes I will make again! This is the 4 th time making this for my daughter and I ! I'll make a few changes next time by adding a can of black beans with the kidney beans! I'm making it again for my 18 year olds friends that are vegan/ vegetarian because they loved it the last time I fixed it in the winter!

We really enjoyed this! I would recommend cutting back or out the red pepper flakes during cooking and adding at the end to suit your taste. We halved and it was way too spicy for us and we like spicy.

I mad this as a healthy alternative and loved it.  I made it as it was and ate all week for lunch.  The sweet potatoes give it a perfect blend of flavor with the traditional chili taste.  I am going to make again for sure!!!!

That's a whole lot of kidney beans so I did one can of pinto beans in place of one can of kidney beans. Turned out delicious! Made this with some vegan cornbread muffins for a perfect healthy winter meal!
