I love this! We have made it a few times and I do a few modifications.. I add lemon pepper to to chicken before sauteeing it. I also use the savory garlic cooking creme and add a few spoonfuls of regular cream cheese to the mix. Also - dont skip the lemon zest, its what gives it the amazing flavor! This recipe is so creamy and delicious, without tons of fat and calories. WINNER!

It was good and inexpensive. Nice, quick work-night supper. It was a little bland though. I had to spice mine up a bit at the table.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  The lemon zest called for made it the perfect!  I did make a few changes.  I tossed the chicken with the pepper and about 1 tsp of cajun seasoning before cooking.  I also do not like to cook with frozen vegetables so I boiled fresh broccoli florets for about 10 minutes in salted water, drained, and added to the pan with the cooking cream.  I will definately make again!

I see a lot of people stating this recipe is bland. A grocery store short coming, was a blessing in disguise. I could not find the original Philadelphia flavor, so I picked up the savory lemon & herb flavor and reduced the lemon zest to 1 teaspoon, this made the meal so flavorful. I also make my rice with chicken stock to add flavor, but I have also made this with pasta and it was just as good. This was an inexpensive, easy meal and a great go to for busy days. This recipe also freezes ok, the sauce does dry out slightly, so if you freeze it you may want to consider making extra sauce or adding sour cream when reheating.

This was just okay. It needed more seasoning like thyme, poultry seasoning, something.  Hubby did not like the Philadelphia cooking cream taste.  Won't be making this again.

Easy Cheesy! Quick and Tasty- We both liked it and will make again. I didn't have lemon zest, but I used lemon pepper.

Quick and tasty!  This was an easy recipe to follow, and my hubby loved it too!  I think I may try a few different things next time I cook this- maybe different veggies, more spices, etc.  This will definitely be making a reappearance on our weekly menu in the future!

This was really good and easy to make. I did have to add some things though. I added more pepper and i squeezed a lemon into it to give it that overall lemon flavor. Just the zest didn't make it taste lemony. It's hard to find Philadelphia cooking cream since its so new and the store i went to didn't have original so I used an italian herb one and that worked just fine!

This was not good. I have cooked for my boyfriend almost every day for the last 6 months and this is the first meal he full on would not eat.

This dish has really good flavor (I put in 3 cloves of garlic and squeezed in half a lemon), but there was entirely too much sauce for my taste.  In the future, I would probably put in about HALF as much of the cooking creme.  It could be good if you served it over pasta instead of rice, but it was honestly borderline with how much sauce there was. It overwhelmed everything else.

Very good quick and easy!! I used the Italian herb and cheese cooking creme and that gave it the right amount of seasoning :)
