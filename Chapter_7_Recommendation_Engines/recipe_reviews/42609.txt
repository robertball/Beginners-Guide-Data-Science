Quote from my daughter: "mom, please tell Dave that his chicken is amazing!" Not only did she love it, but so did everyone else. The only thing I did a little differently was the cooking method. I browned the chix on top of the stove, but then finished it off in the oven. I also added some garlic and onion powders to the marinade. The chicken was so moist and flavorful and the sauce was incredible. Thanks so much Dave!!

I'm so glad that I decided to try this, despite the fact that there was only one review.  It was fantastic!  I loved how the sauce thickened as it simmered, and it tasted great over rice.  Next time I'll try this with chicken breasts, but I think it would be fabulous as a sauce for chicken wings, given how thick and caramelized the dish becomes.  Thanks for sharing, Dave!

I needed something simple for dinner that used chicken. I didn't have sherry, so I used red wine like one of the other reviewers did. I also added almost a full tsp. of ginger. I switched the measurements of the coffee and soy sauce to lower the salt a bit. It's marinating right now, but I'll update on how it turned out. EDITED: I'm glad I switched the coffee and soy sauce. It would have been too salty if I hadn't. The ginger was a nice touch. I'd make this again, only I might add garlic.

Delish!!!  I was somewhat hesitant to make this, as there were (are) no other reviews to go on.  Boy, am I glad I tried it!!  This chicken was awesome....very, very flavorful.  I chose to use two chicken breasts instead which worked well!  Thanks for the recipe, Dave - it'll be made often at this house!  :)

My husband and I were unanimous aboout a 5-star rating for this recipe. I only made a couple of small changes: I added about a teaspoon of dark cocoa powder and a few dashes of cayenne pepper. I also cooked it in a slow cooker and then put it in the oven (400 deg F) for about 15 minutes to glaze the skin. It was super tasty with rice and steamed broccoli and carrots, topped with leftover sauce. Yum.

I thought this recipe was great!  I didn't have sherry so I used marsala wine and I also added a little bit of honey (2 TBsp).  I thought it was great.  I took some sauce from the pan for my kids to "dip" it in and they loved it!  Next time I might try using boneless skinless breasts so it doesn't give us sticky fingers.

I think the name of the recipe is misleading and so people are afraid to try it.  My boyfriend couldn't even tell there was coffee in the recipe yet it added the richness to the flavour.  It was surprisingly good though it didn't look like it would be once it was finished cooking.  The flavour reminded me of a szechuan dish but with chicken rather than pork. Worth trying.

I didn't have any sherry on-hand, so I just left it out, adding a little chicken stock to the pan when simmering to make up the liquid measure. As a note, allow an hour to cook the chicken thoroughly - 35min is not long enough! In the end, the taste was deep and rich, but was missing a certain... sweetness, I think? Perhaps the sherry was vital to the recipe, I wouldn't recommend leaving it out (maybe more brown sugar, or another sweet sauce).

Loved it!  Made double the amount of chicken but did not double the marinade.  Took it to a pot luck and it was a hit.  Thanks Dave.

This was SOOOO good.  I did not use chicken legs but chicken breasts.  I pierced the chicken breasts with a fork to allow marinade to penetrate into the poultry.  Wow!  This recipe is a keeper.    Careful tho' not to overcook the chicken - 30 minutes may be a bit too long - mine was done after 20 minutes...

My son and my boyfriend are tough critics.  They rate my meals on a scale of 1-10.  Nothing EVER gets a 10 (just to keep me hopping).  This chicken dish got a 9 3/4!  The chicken was tender and full of flavor.  Definitely one we'll remake and serve to guests.

I usually use this site as a spring board for ideas and this was great. I made skinned thighs and skinon drumsticks.omitted olive oil completely but sprinkled thighs with sesame oil. Added real cocoa and 3 cl minced garlic some grated ginger. Used some good red wine instead of sherry pinch of cayenne.i cooked in roaster basting often and then finished off on barbecue.the sauce I thicken up with corn starch slurry. Oh I added teaspoon instant coffee to my brewed to achieve nice strong taste. Loved the idea Dave thanks! Crowd loved it.

Unfortunately, a "no-go" for us. :( Really thought it sounded good, but while the sauce was heating,  it smelled unappealing. The color was very dark brown, almost black and smelled like something "burnt"...like tabacco. Not appealing at all. After the sauce was done, the flavor tamed down and wasn't too bad on the chicken...just not great. The sherry made a very strong alcohol flavor and the coffee did not seem to complement this recipe. The first thing my Hubby said to me when he took his first bite..."This has alcohol in it.(?)...Not what I was aiming for in taste...and I will keep my "coffee" in my morning mug,lol. Sorry Dave...two stars for the creativity and uniqueness in this recipe.

I really liked this and so did my hubby. :) I used 1lb. chicken breast since I didn't have chicken legs. I decreased the soy sauce to 1/2 c. and added a tsp. cocoa powder and a tsp. ginger paste and sprinkled garlic powder in before whisking all together. 

I ended up using a crockpot on Low for 6 hours for this recipe. I set the chicken in the bottom and poured the marinade mixture over top of it. We had leftover Asian vegetables that got added in the mix in the last few hours. The chicken easily shredded in the marinade with the veggies and it all tasted awesome scooped over steaming brown rice. YUM!

Next time, I'll try it without the crockpot - prep time was a factor on this first try. :)

I solved the "sodium problem" that some users like to preach about by using low sodium soy sauce and GOOD sherry which has no added salt!  Cooking sherry (all "cooking" wines) should be outlawed... try drinking some... if you wouldn't drink it, why would you cook with it?  That said, this recipe didn't thrill me, but it was still good.  The sauce never thickened, so I added a little cornstarch/water.  I used STRONG coffee and the flavor came through as a "richness" which was very nice.  I may try it again with a little cocoa powder or grated mexican chocolate added.  I, too, served with rice on the side.

Great recipe for modification. I used a bit less soy sauce, Belgian beer in place of the sherry, added Siracha and a bit of sweet bbq sauce in addition to the brown sugar. My husband loved it. Had to cook it much longer than 30 minutes on the stovetop though. More like 50 minutes at a low simmer. Paired with ramen noodles with garlic and broccoli and sauteed in clam sauce and white wine. Stirred in a touch of sesame oil just before serving.

OMG! I made one or two changes. I added double the coffee and cooked the chicken in a dutch oven with sauce until it became thick. This will be made again.

Not one of my favorites, but definitely something different.  I was hesitant about the coffee, but it worked really well and the final product looked super yummy.  I tried it with boneless chicken the second time, and it wasn't as good as bone-in.  I will make this every once in awhile for something different.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because husband said it was just "okay."  That said, I thought it was good enough to make again, using some of the tweaks that other cooks have suggested.  I used b/s chicken breasts, REAL sherry (ever tasted any "cooking" wine?  Naaasty!), and instant espresso powder dissolved in water.  After browning the chicken and adding the boiling marinade, it only took about 20 minutes to cook, and the sauce never really did thicken up.  I think that swapping the amounts of soy and coffee, adding garlic, omitting the oil and addding unsweetened chocolate and/or cocoa powder are good tips.  Definitely a recipe to have fun with!

Too oily, fatty, and a serving has over twie the amount of sodium a person is supposed to have in their diets. I'd suggest cutting down on the olive oil and soy sauce. By all means, use a low sodium soy. Use either skinless legs or breasts to cut fat content. Next time, I'll add the chocolate others have suggested. With a name like Mocha Chicken, it definitely needs chocolate in it. Think chocolate is an odd ingredient for chicken? Think chicken mole from your Mexican restaurant. I will leave out the coffee next time. It's really not detectible.

I give this recipe 5 stars because my husband loved it and has asked for it again.  He usually doesn't like new things.  Plus I'm a vegetarian and not real experienced with cooking but this was easy to make and turned out well (even if I didn't get to taste it).

It was ok.  nothing to rave about.  I really had hoped for more taste, but it was quick and easy for a midweek meal.  Probably won't make if again.  Teriyaki chicken is better and easier.

This recipe was delicious!  My husband said he wanted chicken for dinner, and I was looking for a new way to cook it.  I didn't have sherry on hand, so I used red wine.  Otherwise, I followed this exactly and it was perfect!  We both loved it, and I will be making this again.

I used five boneless, skinless halves.  Meant to add 1/8t cayenne to the marinade, but forgot so added it to the marinade after boiling it.  Oh, subbed marsala for the sherry. This is teriyaki chicken.  It's teriyaki chicken.  'More suited to people who like sweet chicken.  No, not crazy sweet; but "teriyaki" covers it.  No, thanks.

Right recipe, wrong name! if not for the other reviews, I would have missed out on this delish dish. Followed the existing recipe plus added 2 cloves of crushed garlic & powdered ginger. Did not marinade. Browned chicken drumsticks on the stovetop while boiling the sauce then combined & put in oven at 375 for about 30 mins. The sauce does not thicken till it cools a bit, so don't overboil. Otherwise, a great recipe & we will make again! My husband who hates leftovers took them for lunch the next day & my daughter asked for the same exact dinner the very next night!

It has a unique taste and no one was able to guess that it was coffee based.  I would make it again, but it's not a new favorite.  I switched the amount of soy sauce and coffee like other reviewers recommended.  I removed the chicken skin and placed in a slow cooker for 6 hours on low.  The sauce did not thicken in the slow cooker, so I transferred it to a pan and boiled for 30 minutes;  minimal  thickening achieved.  The sauce was tasty, and I think I will use it in the future to baste some grilled or broiled chicken.

I also went with 1/4c soy sauce and 2/3c coffee. I used dry sherry instead of cooking sherry. I also used two chicken breasts instead of the legs, and used a minimum of oil in the pan (and I'd go no oil in the marinade next time). I added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and a couple dashes of cayenne pepper to the marinade. I had some trouble thickening the sauce (even with cornstarch, but I was conservative), but after it was cool it was nice and thick.  The flavor itself was great, and I'll certainly make it again!

The taste of the sauce that is created by this recipe is really delicious and unique.  I did switch the quantities of soy sauce and coffee.  Also, simmering the chicken thighs for a half an hour is not enough time to cook them.  I had to simmer them for a half an hour and then cook them in the oven for twenty minutes.  But by the time they were done, there was this very rich thick sauce covering the chicken.  I think this recipe would also work with chicken breasts and would probably be easier to eat, because the drumsticks can get messy (mine did).

Loved this recipe!! Was a little worried about the amount of soy sauce, so put in a little less and a bit more coffee. I didn't have sherry, so gave it a shot of whisky...not really the same, but the basic recipe idea is fantastic!Everyone loved it!! I also browned the chicken in a pan, then finished the legs in the oven, without the marinade. I simmered the marinade down to about half, then thickened it with a knob of butter ( didn't use oil) then poured it over the chicken before serving.

I modified the recipe somewhat, per the reviews I read.  I added minced garlic, 2 tablespoons powdered dutch cocoa and about 1/2 tsp cayenne. I thickened the sauce with a water, cornstarch mixture before serving.   I reduced the brown sugar by half, I reduced the soy sauce to 1/8th cup and added less than 1/8th cup of fish sauce to make about 1/4 cup.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast instead of drumsticks.   I kept the olive oil, brewed coffee and sherry the same.  Next time I make it, I'll reduce the amount of olive oil. Even with cooking a leaner type of chicken with no skin, the oil floated to the top of the sauce.  I skimmed what I could off.   The chicken and sauce have a wonderful, complex favor.  A definite keeper recipe.  It's ripe for modification-- maybe a little more cayenne next time, or a double shot of brewed espresso, or sub in fresh pineapple juice for some of the brown sugar, try some pork instead of chicken.    I served the chicken and sauce over brown rice, with a little bit of sauteed crimini mushrooms on top and steamed broccoli/ cauliflower as a side dish.

I used boneless skinless breasts for this recipe. It was good, but not amazing. I followed the directions exactly and my sauce was somewhat oily and somewhat greasy, and certainly never reached the point of being a "dipping sauce," though I would've liked it to be. However, the chicken was still very good, so with some minor changes this would be a 5 star in my book.

i really, really liked it and very easy to make. Next time I think I will put a bit of cornstarch in  just to thicken the sauce. I served it with rice and will definetly make it again.

I made this for dinner last night using boneless,skinless chicken thighs. We really did not care for the taste of this at all.  It was sweet, with a bitter aftertaste.  Will not be making this one again.

Well, like other people have claimed, the sauce never thickened up for me either. This basically taste like a not-so-sweet teriyaki sauce with a nice "Mocha" color. Maybe that is where the title came from. It definitely isn't for the flavor of the coffee. This came out too greasy for me and I used boneless, skinless thighs. I would not even bother adding the oil to the marinate. This dish creates enough fat on its own. I had to strain all the grease off the top of mine.

Superb!  I had to go out, so finished the chicken in a 300 degree oven for one hour - when I came home it just fell off the bone. The sauce didn't thicken up though, because the fat from the chicken mixed in with it - not good for you, but boy oh boy was it good over rice!  I added two crushed garlic cloves to the marinade- a must have.

I made this this morning for a pot luck, after leaving the drumsticks in the marinade overnight (in the cold garage). I followed the recipe, exactly, only adding a little garlic powder.  I had 17 drumsticks so I increased the recipe only a little, proportionately.  They were gobbled up with 2 recipe requests.  I found that they required almost an hour to cook and the marinade reduced down nicely. I switched them into a slow cooker to keep warm.  They were nicely glazed and didn't require any of the remaining marinade to be added to the slow cooker.  Perfect!!!

we will have to skin chicken next time or decrease oil to almost nothing, too greasy with the skin and all of the oil. double the sauce and added 1 t onion powder and 2 minced cloves of garlic. We browned on the stove and then baked at 350 for about 45 minutes covered and 15 monutes uncovered, very good.

This recipe was great and even better then next day. I didn't have sherry so I used white wine and I also didn't have brewed coffe so I mixed up some strong instant coffee. It was really good even with these changes.

I've made this every week for the past three weeks.  We all LOVE it!  The only thing I do differently now is to add 1/2 a tablespoon of powdered cocoa and two minced garlic cloves to the marinade.  After cooking as directed, we finish it off on an outdoor grill for three minutes per side.  The grill adds a yummy smokiness to the already dark, rich flavor.  Tnanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I made this exactly according to the directions, and both my husband and I liked it.  You don't really taste the coffee, but I'm not sure I'd want coffee flavored chicken so I think that's a good thing.  There was a richness to the sauce that I imagine is due to the coffee even if you don't actually taste it.  Even better than the chicken was the brown rice and broccoli I served on the side with some of the marinade spooned on top.  Yum, yum!  While this is quite good as written, I think in the future I'd add some ginger and garlic, and use chicken breast strips rather than legs.  I'd also consider adding some veggies to make this more of a stir fry.  Thanks for the recipe.

This chicken is the "bomb". I am seriously breaking my diet given the 730 calories per serving. But if I have to break it, this is the way I want to do it! I modified the recipe a little using red pepper flakes(I hate black pepper) and some sweet peppers when I was simmering the chicken(I love sweet peppers). I also cooked it a little longer than the recipe called for(I like my chicken really tender). But still...this chicken is the bomb, really!!!!

My husband and I found this dish to be just okay (edible).  However, it is simple and kid friendly.  Imagine teriyaki minus the grill or broiler, garlic, and ginger ~ unsophisticated.  It’s true, you really don’t taste the coffee.  However, the rather pronounced flavor of the sherry screams for lots of steamed rice and broccoli.  Don’t be tempted to skip cooking the marinade on the side prior to adding it to the browned chicken.  You must cook it separately in order to skim the surface.  Once the marinade/sauce thickens, it does glaze the chicken for a beautiful presentation.  However due to a lack of alluring flavors, this dish will not show up on my table again.

We all loved it.  At first, the marinade smelled weird, but I went through with the recipe anyhow.  I used Apothic Dark red wine, dark sumatra (practically espresso) coffee and it came out wonderful!  I made the recipe as stated. The only "changes" I made was using espresso and my favorite DARK wine.

Absolutely wonderful.  I will probably make again with thighs instead of legs and possibly with chicken breast.  I marinated while i was at work, but may go overnight the next time.  It picked up a lot of the flavor, but I wanted more!  May make a gravy of it :)

Having read all of the reviews I made the following changes:  double the coffee and cut the soy sauce in half.  Add 1 t. cocoa powder, add garlic and a sprinkle of ginger.  Forget the oil altogether!  I used skinless chicken thighs and opted to bake them instead of frying.  Even with baking, there was a good amount of grease when they were done.  350 degree oven for an hour.  I heated the marinade on the stove and poured over the chicken before putting in oven. It turned out  very tasty and is great over rice!

This was some the best chicken I've ever made!  I took the advice of others and switched the soy sauce and coffee measrements.  I also added grated garlic and ginger into the marinade and used red wine instead of cooking sherry.  It turned out fantastic.  I think next time I may try this marinade with chicken breast or tenderloins.

I was really looking forward to this.  Way too salty.  I think if you cut down on the soy sauce, or use light soy sauce, the other flavors will come out.

This is one of my favorite chicken recipes. I change it a little to fit what I normally have at home, but nothing drastic. I use manischewitz red wine in place of cooking sherry, I use low sodium soy sauce, and I never use as much oil as it calls for (I mostly cook without oil and butter). I like cooking it in the crock pot too, after coating the chicken in flour (to thicken the sauce a little). I normally add garlic too, since my boyfriend likes garlic in everything. Then I normally just serve it with rice and put the extra sauce on top. Whenever I make a side of vegetables with it, they never get eaten because the sauce is so good that we have seconds and thirds of the chicken and rice instead!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few changes though.  I did not have sherry so I substituted it with red wine vinegar.  I also used about 1/4 cup of molasses as well.  I simmered the chicken legs for about an hour.  Then I took out the chicken legs, let them cool and then deboned, skinned and then broke apart the chicken.  As I was doing this I added about 2 tbsp of dissolved corn starch to the sauce and brought to a boil for a few more minutes.  I had a bed of white rice, chopped chicken and then brocolli...added a few spoonfuls of the sauce and viola :)  It was more of an asian style dinner and I watched happily as my 20 month old stuffed brocolli in his mouth!  That right there makes this recipe 5 stars!!!

Made two different chicken recipes with a large pack of chicken legs I had onhand. The other one (simply using crushed stuffing mix to coat the chicken that was dredged in olive oil) was the better of the two. This was decent, but a little too different tasting for our liking.

Marinated for about 5 hours while I was off running errands, then grilled it on the george foreman.  I will probably try adding some garlic as suggested in other reviews for next time.  All in all, a great weeknight chicken recipe!

This recipe is just ok.....It smells like chocolate while cooking,and has a very different taste. If you must try this be sure do do it for yourself before serving for guests as you may be disappointed.

I wasn't sure about this because of the mocha in the name of the recipe.  After reading the reviews, I am glad I gave it a chance.  This is fantastic.  We will make this again for sure.  Chicken is extremely tender, it has a nice sweet marinade taste to it.  A definate keeper.

Great recipe!  After reading the review that said the name was misleading, I didn't it expect it to be "mocha-y" but it was.  My house was filled with an unbelievably delicious chocolaty smell.  And the flavor was slightly chocolaty and so good!

Wow.  This is was suprisingly good. I use boneless chicken breast.  I marinated the chicken a day ahead with buttermilk and marinated the chicken the next day in this marinade and put it on the grill.  Chicken came out so soft and juicy.

The sauce on this is excellent!  I did increase the cooking time by about 20 minutes.  I think this would be really good with boneless chicken breasts as well.  Great new recipe for chicken, will definitely make again.

I had mixed feelings about this dish.  The meat does turn out moist but the flavor is almost non existent.  I also took other reviewers suggestions and added a bit of cocoa and chopped garlic.  The sauce does thicken up nice though and glazes the chicken perfectly. We won't make again though....it was just so-so.

At first I thought that OJAGAJ's review was too harsh, in view of the other more enthusiastic reviews. Now that I made this recipe,I have to agree. Ultimately, the flavor was mostly salty/soy sauce. I detected nothing from the coffee. I could never get the sauce to thicken or glaze. Overall, it tasted okay but it wasn't a unique change from many other similar Chinese chicken recipes I've made.

I made this just as the instructions said however after cooking on the stove toe p for more th 45 minutes I had to put the Chicken in the oven to finish it off.  35 minutes on medium on the stove is not enough.

Every bite was flavourful. I  had to marinade them for 10-12 hours because I didn't have time to cook them. The flavour was a bit strong so 5 hours as recommended would have been much better.

My husband LOVES this recipe!  I made no changes.  We've used it with various chicken parts (leg quarter, drumsticks) and it turned out great.  And a little of the sauce is delish on rice.  :)

Went out on a limb and tried this recipe simply because I could not think of what coffee and chicken would taste like. This was absolutely delicious!  Very bold and asain-bbq in flavor! Only thing I changed was a bit less oil because we are on a diet. The chicken was moist and tender, and we will be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was AMAZING! I was a bit skeptical. I mean, who ever heard of using coffee to make chicken? But it sounded intriguing, and I'm always up for new things, so I made it for my husband and I. We both loved it. The chicken was the most tender I've ever had, and the flavour was just... delicious, for lack of a better word. I admit to adding extra brown sugar, because I like sweet things, but WOW! What an idea! I'll have to try it with chicken breast so the rest of my family will try it. Thanks for the awesome recipe! Oh yeah, and I used regular red cooking wine because we don't have sherry. Still awesome.

I thought I followed this recipe exactly but for some reason it turned out VERY salty.  I added water, more wine and some vinegar to cut the salt.  My family liked the chicken but the sauce itself was too salty to put on top.  I will make again and cut down on the soy sauce portion.

Yummy!  Great flavor Dave!  I couldn't taste the coffee.  It reminded me of a mild teriyaki. No leftovers from this one.

My Dad used to slow simmer chicken legs in a bottled terriyaki sauce that I loved! They stopped making it years ago, and I have never been able to get close to it. This was just a little butter away! My husband and daughter both loved it, and I will most certainly be making it again- with some butter to replace the olive oil.

The family seemed to really like the chicken flavor, we couldnt use the sauce as much because it was way too salty. I would cut down on the soy sauce.

Super easy to make!!!  I substituted half of the soy sauce for tereyaki sauce, and it was just amazing.

I liked this recipe for sure and my family ate it all up each time I have made it.  That being said, I do not think the coffee flavour is identifiable at all with the soy sauce overpowering it.  I'd say just omit it as unnecessary.  The other thing I have done is to cook the chicken in the sauce on the stovetop.  The whole separate marinade from meat and cook spearately and then cook together was just cumbersome. It gives the sauce a longer cooking time which turns it into a nice syrupy consistency and sticks to the chicken well, and it also keeps the chicken moist so you can use white chicken  or skinless as well and get fantastic results.

I followed the recipe with various changes made by other reviewers. I doubled the marinade as I was using both legs and thighs. Switched the soy sauce and coffee amounts; this being said I used instant espresso powder in water since I don't have strong-brewed coffee. I used half brown sugar and half regular because I didn't have enough; believe the regular made the dish a little too sweet. Reducing the sugar wouldn't hurt either. I don't buy cooking sherry because of its salt content and simply because we only cook with what my fiance will drink. I did have Marsala leftover from a previous recipe so I used that instead. Added ginger and garlic powder, however you could taste neither of them. Fresh minced is probably a better option, or use more of the two dried. Also added cayenne, but it wasn't enough heat for me; will use more next time. Cocoa powder was another addition, sort of like a Mexican-chocolate approach... Didn't do much for the dish, will omit it. Olive oil was also unnecessary in the marinade... End result was too oily. It can be kept in the recipe in a lesser amount to use when cooking the chicken.  I marinated the chicken pieces overnight, shaking them up every so often. I chose a different cooking method. Since I rarely cook my chicken entirely on the stove, I opted for browning them on all sides and cooking them in a preheated 350F oven (with the marinade) for an hour. Will keep them skin-up next time to be crispier. Sauce didn't thicken at all.

This chicken is the best meal I have had in a while! My boyfriend loved it too! Pops with flavor and the house fills with great aroma while cooking! I added some garlic powder and a teaspoon of cocoa and used white wine in place of sherry. So GOOD!! I served with rice and brocolli and drizzeled sauce over all. I will try this with wings sometime soon! Thanks Dave!

I served this over rice, and it was good. I thought that it was a little too salty so it may be a good idea to use the reduced sodium soy sauce.

This had a good flavor, but I was really hoping that the consistency would be syrupy & stick to the chicken.  My broth was just really loose & watery, so I was a bit disappointed.  I did however switch from legs to breasts because my husband doesn't care for chicken on the bone.

I thought this was okay. I used boneless chicken breasts, cut in pieces, which reduced the cooking time. My only other change was to cut the oil in half after reading so many reviews about the sauce being too thin. It did caramelize nicely on the chicken and the flavor was good *at first* but then, the more I ate, the more I felt like the soy sauce taste was just too much. It had a definite teriyaki-like flavor and my guys all liked it but I probably won't make it again unless its requested.

Cut up a whole chicken, skinned & put in crockpot. Was pretty good, but didn't really need the oil. I also cut back the soy sauce to 1/4 c. since others said it was salty otherwise. Sprinkled in some onion and garlic powders and a little crushed red pepper flakes. Would eat again!

We used low sodium soy sauce for the first time ever on this recipe and it still was salty enough - would not recommend using regular soy sauce as I think it would be too salty then. We covered the chicken and should not have; the sauce never thickened up. Will make again, very good.

Made this last night last minute and loved it!  I didn't get a chance to marinate so I cooked it in a bag and it turned out wonderful!  I think next time I might substitute honey for the brown sugar though to cut back on the sugar content.  Wonderful recipe though!

Excellent recipe! I made it tonight using boneless breasts and the chicken was super moist. I used real sherry (Harvey's Bristol Cream) so I don't know if it made a difference or not. I might use a little less brown sugar next time as I found it just a touch too sweet.

Delicious! I used red wine instead of sherry, and the coffee I used was not very strong because we had to keep the kids in mind, and everyone loved it. I also used boneless chicken thighs. Will make again.

My 10 year old son says "so awesome, bestever chicken thing ever in the world".  So there you have it. I did not think it was salty AT ALL, one reviewer mentioned cooking sherry was salty (I have no clue)...but I did use the Merlot I was drinking a few days prior (leftover!), threw in a tablespoon of minced garlic (We love garlic), and instant coffee granules.  I cut breasts into nugget size pieces, served over rice. A mellow flavor...nothing harsh or overpowering, if you want something punchy, this is maybe not for you.  But it's a good base to start with...then kick it up yourself

I made this last night & it was a hit with hubby, the kids and their friends. It's very easy on the wallet, and tasty. It took MUCH longer than 35 minutes to cook, and next time I'll try baking it rather than pan frying. I will also try a lower sodium soy sauce.  Overall a very good recipe. Thanks Dave!

It looked really good when it was all finished, but tasted wayyyy too salty, I could hardly eat it. It may have been the kind of soy sauce I used, but it was just normal sauce... i'll use low sodium next time and less, also something sweet added.

I have to say that I was dissapointed with this dish.  Very salty..and could taste nothing more than the soy sauce.  Also my sauce did not glaze or thicken..I followed recipe exactly...   Maybe I'll try one more time and follow suit to other reviewers and add in some cocoa and garlic and onion powders and finish baking on the grill or in the oven.  Maybe that would help.

I didnt have sherry, but I added a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and also a couple cloves of garlic.  The sauce is very good..served over brown rice the first night and then chopped up and served over whole wheat couscous with the sauce as leftovers the next...I liked it with the couscous better!!

My whole family loved this chicken which doesn't happen often.  My picky husband, 4 year old and 2 year old.  I used 1/2 cup low sodium soy because that's all I had left and I'll probably make with that amount again.  It wasn't too salty at all.  I also simmered the chicken about 45 minutes.  The sauce thickened nicely and the chicken just fell off the bone.  Perfect!

My household was divided down the middle on this one!  My daughter and I didn't like it at all but my son and husband thought it was great.  My main complaint is it was wayyyyy too salty!!  I would definitely use a LOW SODIUM soy sauce the next time.
However, I loved the rich, glossy, ruddy black 'finish' it gave the chicken.  I enjoyed giving it a try though so thank you, Dave!
