The recipe author basically says to adjust to your own taste, so I bumped up the red curry paste (it has a kick), cut back on the red pepper flakes, and the spiciness was just about perfect!  By all means, use rice vinegar, IMO it's really important to the authentic flavor of this salad.  I did add a little bit of chopped cilantro, otherwise, followed the recipe.  Enjoyed, this is a really nice and easy addition to an Asian meal.

This recipe is a very authentic tasting Thai salad. All the flavours are working well together. My first thought was how can only carrot make this salad good tasting? Well it certainly does. The dressing is so flavourful. Very yummy. I made the half of the dressing and it was the perfect amount. Very very nice salad. Thanks you.

The sauce seemed to be more than was needed, so I saved it and have made the salad at least 3 times with the leftovers. Also added some fresh diced pineapple once, which made it even better.
I just sprinkle the nuts on top.
Many compliments! Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted just like it does in any Thai restaurant, which is a compliment. The second time I made it I substituted sucralose for the sugar and it came out great. That's 774 fewer calories! I would also advise that you half the amount of red pepper flakes.

Really tasty and went well with other dishes, even those that weren't Asian in origin, bringing them to life with a real pop of flavor. Another time I would use less sugar and more carrots as others have suggested, to reduce calories, and will try with the red pepper flakes when not offering it to children.

Surprisingly good. My taster who dislikes vinegar went for seconds. The dressing would work for 1.5 pounds of carrots.
I used 1/2 the sugar (plenty sweet) and did not use red pepper. Next time I'll use more of the red curry paste. I'll definitely use this for a potluck.

Nice, I find it really sweet though.  Double carrots/half dressing, even then the carrots are swimming in it!

This was great, but there is at least twice as much dressing as needed.  I followed the recipe and had carrot soup.  Scooped it out with a slotted spoon into a dry bowl and it was delicious.  I used 1/4 of the red pepper flakes and it was still plenty spicy, especially after a few hours.

this was great.  The dressing easily covers 2 pounds of carrots and cuts the calories, too.  I also used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup and it tasted fine.  I plan to add a fresh jalapeno pepper to my next batch.

Love this!  It made a lot of dressing so will probably add in more carrots or even cabbage next time, onions might be good to.
