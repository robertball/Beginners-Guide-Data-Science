This recipe is an original! True bengali cooking for people who love spices. I like to add a little more turmeric (about 1/2 tsp) and if you really like spice, I add 1 hot pepper (the kind you find at Indian grocery stores.) If you like the sauce very thick, add 1 tbs yogurt and let simmer instead of water. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this with my sister-in-law for my Bengali husband. We didn't change anything except put in 1tbs sour cream at the end (instead of the yogurt suggested, didn't have any). Aunthentic and yummy! Be careful with the peppers, it really does add kick.

This was very good.  I added some chopped green bell pepper and summer squash.  Served with naan, basmatic & wild rice mix (Trader Joe's) and a store-bought mango chutney.

Very good.  I made it with a bit of yogurt and no water.  Served with naan.   Thanks for the recipe!

Truly excellent! I will definitely be making this again. I used Saffron since I accidentally didn't have tumeric -- that, I will do again. I would recommend using more garlic paste and, if you like spicy food, definitely include both peppers.

Added water and a couple dollups of yogurt to make a little gravy.  Tried it both with uncooked and pre-cooked shrimp, I preferred the uncooked.  Will make again and again and again - easy and quick to make!

The first time I fixed this, my family was so impressed!  I've fixed it several times since.  The only change I have made is adding some spicy curry powder.  Tastes very fresh with the fresh cilantro.  Great over rice with a salad.
