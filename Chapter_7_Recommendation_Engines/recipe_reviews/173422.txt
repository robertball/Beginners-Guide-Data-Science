I spent a month in Egypt last year and this was very similar to the koshary we bought in street stalls every couple of days.  The only addition that I would make to complete it is French fried onions as a topping and a side of hot sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make koshary quite a lot, and this is a good recipe. As a rule for cooking rice, use 2:1 water to rice, and it should turn out perfect without needing to be checked or to add more water. You cut time by making things simultaneously (cooking macaroni, lentils and rice on separate burners) and the sauce in another pan. It takes about 15-20 min. cooking time and 10 min. prep. time then. Serve with kababs, chicken and mulokhia, and fattoush salad for a rounded out meal.

My husband would really prefer to never eat lentils.  However, there is an Italian tradition (I'm Italian, he's not) of eating lentil soup on New Year's Day to ensure prosperity in the coming year so he has to put up with them one day a year.  This year I thought I'd try something a little different and found this recipe.  Hubby loves tomato so I thought this might work.  I cooked the lentils and the rice in a chicken veggie broth for extra flavor, the pasta I used was some leftover pastina (really small pasta used for soups) and the tomato I used was leftover homemade pizza sauce.  It was fantastic!  My husband loved it and I could probably get him to eat it a couple of times a year because I love lentils and would like to be able to have them more often.  Thanks for this one!

Pretty good, but definitely needs chickpeas and french fried onions on top to be like the Kosheri I had in Cairo! In the future, I will also use more lentils, crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste, and cooking time is overestimated: only took me an hour from start to finish, including prep which can be done while rice/pasta is cooking.

Sorry, we did not care for this one.  The texture of the pasta with the rice kinda threw us off.

This makes a TON of koshari!!! Which is great because I love it. I would actually say to make it with even more onions as the fried onions are my favorite part. I noticed that the recipe forgets the garbanzo beans, I added a can to mine. It's a great koshari recipe to get you hooked on the dish and to build from if you have certain flavors that you love or would want to add to it.

Eaten almost everywhere in the Middle East, this poor's man feast requires a lot of preparation and utensils to cook. But it is a delicious filling-up meal.

My boyfriend is Egyptian and was very pleased with this meal ( I made it as anniversary surprise!) There is a sauce Egyptians spoon on top of the dish as a finishing touch...it is minced garlic, 1 tbs coriander, 1/2 tbs cummin, 1 tbs red pepper flakes, distilled white vinegar ( just enough to cover the spices) and dilute with water to taste! it’s excellent added flavor! Plus add to the dish chick peas and fried onion crisps to top it

Just like in Egypt! Delicious but will require several of the pots and pans in the kitchen with the rice, pasta, onion frying, & sauce all needing their own dish. So worth the work!

I make this recipe at least once a month for my egyptian husband, it's his absolute favorite.  Instead of    caramelizing  the onions i blackened them because that is how my husband's mother made it.

I'm Egyptian, and this Koshary doesn't really work. The sauce is way too thick because it doesn't have any water. Tomatoes and 3 tablespoons of vinegar is not enough. The consistency of the sauce should be slightly thicker than water. The onion also needs to be fried to crisp before topping. Finally, I felt like nothing had any flavor other than the sauce, which was not how I've ever had koshary, whether at home or elsewhere. Any part that wasn't covered in sauce had no flavor. 

To be fair, the sauce did have good flavor and that made this dish overall okay. But I would look for a better recipe that incorporates the flavors together during cooking, especially the rice and lentils.

We love this dish. In Cairo, it's that takeout or dine- everyone loves. It's also vegetarian (although I sometimes make the rice with some chicken consume). 
I recommend serving it in large bowls.
The down side is, it always takes me 1 & 1/2- 2 hours to make. But so worth it if you have time and a dishwasher at home  (I use ALL the pots & dishes for this meal).

Thanks for the recipe, it tastes exactly as we can buy it here in Egypt from the restaurants.
