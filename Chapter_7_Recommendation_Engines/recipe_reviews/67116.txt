Thanks for this recipe Mr. Hamer.  It does have a very unique taste - but I've giving it 5 stars because it's wonderful to taste foods with "history" to them. I enjoyed sampling this dish - but I did add a shake of Cajun seasoning though!  I didn't do this but think --- cooked in cast iron over a fire - then served with eggs, ham, and a cup of black coffee - you could just close your eyes and imagine how they all tasted together on a cold winter morning, so long ago.  Some may not like the taste of this to fix again - but what a wonderful thing to fix once - especially to let the younger ones know the foods that used to be eaten during the history of our Great Country!  Thanks again!

I tried out this recipe because I'd never had hominy and I was pleasantly surprised. It took a very long time for the milk to thicken, so I added a tbls. of flour. I also added some garlic powder, parmesan, and mozzarella to give it a little oomph. Very nice.

Very easy, tasty, and hearty breakfast dish. I used yellow hominy instead of white, and made a butter/flour roux after cooking the bacon and before adding everything into the skillet. It really helped thicken it up quickly. Seasoned it with fresh ground pepper and my favorite seasoning salt. Goes great over biscuits or toast! Serve with eggs on the side, and sprinkle with chopped parsley or green onions to add some color.  Will definitely make it again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I used veggie bacon, made a roux out of flour and soy milk, then added hominy and several seasonings. Served over fried eggs on english muffins. Yum!

I have been eating hominy for my entire life.  My mom always just served it with butter as a side dish.  I usually put it into soup, or, like my mom, use it as a side dish.  I have never even considered serving it as done in this recipe, but it's one of my favorites now!  Thanks for the recipe!
I put this on top of biscuits, topped it with a fried egg, and sprinkled some chives on top.
