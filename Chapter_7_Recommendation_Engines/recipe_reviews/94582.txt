While I know that pastuerized whites are safe ;o) I chose to go w/ light corn syrup. I only used a couple of tbp for a light coating (just roll the cranberries in it as you would the sugar but lift them out w/ a fork) to avoid excess. I tried using that pretty decorative sparkly sugar, thinking it would be best for this recipe but I was wrong. Hey, it happens! LOL Regular granulated sugar tastes best, looks best & isn't sticky (the sparkly sugar didn't coat completely while the granulated did). I layed them out to dry on a rack over a cookie sheet. They're beautiful! Thanks KF1065! UPDATE---Just wanted to give y'all a heads up not to keep these in an airtight container. (at least ones made using the corn syrup) They lose their frosted sugary coating & get kinda gooey.  The ones I left out in bowls are still perfect. My grndkids loved these & insisted on taking some home.

This recipe is awesome! I am putting together little "Baskets of Plenty" for co-workers for Thanksgiving. I needed one little extra thing to add, and I stumbled across this recipe. It's easy, inexpensive, they look festive & beautiful, and taste great!!
A second note on these-- I made my first batch last weekend as a trial batch. I bought fresh cranberries from the produce section and let them chill in the fridge for a couple of hours until I was ready to use them. Had no problems. Right now I am working on my second batch- using the extra bag of cranberries I had stored in the freezer. The package says you can store them in the freezer and not to thaw them before using. Well the cranberries are not looking great right now, the egg & water mixture got frosty and dried a little bit first and now sitting in the sugar the are thawing causing the sugar not to stick as well. I will have to periodicaly turn them over in the sugar to make sure they're covered while they dry. So it's safe to say-- for optimum quality, use only chilled fresh cranberries for this recipe.

These are delightful. I noticed one reviewer gave it only one star because of the use of egg whites. The recipe specifically calls for pasteurized egg whites, which can be found in stores. There is no danger of salmonella with pasteurized egg whites. It deserves four or five stars.

This is my favorite kind of recipe -- simple to make and yet very impressive looking!  I made these to decorate a cranberry-orange cheesecake for a potluck, and everyone thought it had come from a fancy bakery.

I had a hard time finding pasteurized eggs at my grocery store, so I used dried egg white powder (which is pasteurized and guaranteed free of salmonella).  Just mix up 2 tsp of egg white powder with 2 tbsp of water and whisk until smooth.  This worked great for me!

With the use of raw egg this can/could get people ill with samonilla.  Another alternative is to use unflavored gelatin in a small amount of water.  Simply dip the cranberries into the this mixture and directly into sugar.  Place on prepared surface to dry.  These are very edible!

These were easy and delicious! Helpful hints: used All Whites eggwhites with water to coat cranberries. Drain off liquid and pour onto baking pan coated with sugar. Shake pan back and forth to cover all in seconds.  Air dry. Addictive!

I used corn syrup instead of egg. They are beautiful. I filled a vase with them and put a candle in it for a cheap and pretty centerpiece.

This was AWESOME! I made it tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I was a little afraid to try them, even though they looked yummy, but I love them! Tangy and sweet. I recommend them to anyone. Super quick to make and something truly unique :)
FYI: You can get the egg whites in a little milk like container with the shelled eggs.

I used light corn syrup as suggested by a few other reviewers, and they turned out great.  I think it would be easier to put the sugar in a bowl to coat them, and then lay them out on waxed paper.  But they tasted great and were devoured by the cranberry lovers at Thanksgiving.

Delicious and ignore the ignorant remark about the eggs. Only if prepared improperly is there ever a chance of salmonella. It is a safe bet that if the person telling you about something can't even spell it they have no clue what they are speaking of.

I just wanted to thank the recipe submitter. As my mother mentioned in her review of this recipe, we used these cranberrries in the centerpieces for my  November wedding, and they turned out just beautiful (plus a number of family members enjoyed eating the extras). We piled them around pillar candles in vases and put the vases on top of magnolia leaves, and it was gorgeous and unique. Plus the berries held up quite well over a period of days, which was handy since my mom and sister didn't have to make them all the day of the rehearsal. If I recall correctly, I think they tended to get a little bit mushy if they were sealed up in a container (presumably because of the moisture from the berries), but as long as they were exposed to the air, they stayed dry and perfect. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I have been making these for many years, althought my recipe is different and does not call for an "egg".  These little gems are addicting!!    2 cups granulated sugar 2 cups water 2 cups fresh cranberries 3/4 cup superfine sugar. boil 2 cups water and sugar until dissolved and soak cranberries for 24 hours.  Drain (can reserve sugar water for later use in drinks, roll in superfine (I use regalar) sugar, let dry.

I LOVE Frosting fruits--grapes, etc. are great using this recipe, too.  Just a suggestion, if you want to make it a bit more "decadent".  I like to replace the water with brandy, cognac, grand marnier, chambord, etc.  Make sure it's chilled first, though.  It really adds an expensive taste and presentation to frosted fruits--and is especially nice with frosted grapes.

I used blueberries instead and they were amazing! They practically melt in your mouth. I used them to top a cake and they looked beautiful as well. To make the prep clean and easy I placed the berries in a large ziplock bag. Then I poured the egg white mixture into the bag and shook everything gently. Then I poured the berries/egg whites into a strainer. Then I put the sugar in another big baggie and added the strained berries. I shook this bag gently and then poured the sugared berries back into the strainer and sifted the extra sugar out before placing the berries on a parchment lined cookie sheet.

I made these because I think that they look so pretty. Imagine my surprise when I found out that they taste as good as they look! When I make them again I am going to try them with a super fine sugar. Some of them were a little too sweet. Sugar "glumped" up on some too much. Thank you for these sweet little gems!

Absolutely the best.  I made these as accents for the Christmas cookie plate and they became the stars instead.  I would make them again anytime for a healthier, anti-oxident boosting snack.  I used 1 egg white and added a little light corn syrup and vanilla.  Regular white sugar works best.  NOTE:  Keep them dry and in an uncovered or aired bowl and they last for a long time.  I have had mine for almost 4 weeks and they are still fresh, crisp with a moist berry!

OMG soooo easy and YUMMY!  I was planning on using these for decoration only, as DH, DD and I don't really care for cranberries.
BUT -they are sooo good.  I'm going to have to buy another bag and make more for Thanksgiving day.  I used the carton of pasturized egg whites, and regular sugar, and even rolled them the way the original recipe stated.  I rolled a little bit at a time though, and they came out PERFECT.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved these..great way to get cranberries into your diet.  My husband thought they were a bit off/tart tasting..so next time I used 1/4 tsp of both orange and vanilla flavoring in the water/egg white mix..the flavoring helped balance the flavor for him..now he loves them too :) Thanks so much for sharing!!

These are surprisingly tasty and very festive.  I didn't have pasteurized egg white OR corn syrup on hand, but found that a touch of honey worked just as well.

these are so pretty! very time consuming as others have said but i have found a trick...   i have plastic dishes from target that are essentially just salad plates for single servings. the sides are raised about 2 inches. i put about a 2/3 cup of sugar in the bottom and then batches of about 8 cranberries that have been dripped from all access egg white/h20 with a slotted spoon into the dish. and the shake the dish from side to side like sifting sand at the beach!  super easy, much faster, and requires less touching.

These are a great snack!  A little time consuming to make, but simple enough and taste great, even for non-cranberry lovers!  I served them as a snack this time, but look forward to using them as a garnish in the future!  TY for a great looking (and tasting) recipe!  I subbed light Karo syrup w/a little hot water for the eggs.

I was looking for a festive and pretty way to top some mini cranberry cheesecakes that I made for a party, and this recipe could not have been more perfect for that.  I was actually nervous to try one after I finished, fearing that the cranberries would still be very tart, even coated in sugar.  But these are so good, almost addicting.  I kept eating and eating, until I realized I was going to run out of my cheesecake toppers.  These are a great addition to holiday recipes... beautiful and delicious!

These really are good. I took these to a party and everyone was amazed at how tasty they are.  I used agave nectar in place of the egg white (and healthier than corn syrup).  How to make them was a topic of conversation at the gathering.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've bitten into a plain cranberry before.  Let's just say it was not pleasant.  But these!  These were amazing!  The sweetness of the sugar helps balance out the bitterness and tart of the cranberry.  I love it!   I took the suggestion of some other people.  I replaced the egg with a tablespoon light corn syrup.  Also, instead of using regular granulated sugar I used ultrafine sugar (i.e castor sugar, berry sugar).  If you don't have ultrafine sugar, pulsing regular granuated sugar in your food processor would work!

I'm going to come right out and say the ONLY reason I made these was because they are pretty, and I wanted to impress my co-workers with my Martha Stewart skillz at our holiday party :) I don't like cranberries and I don't like sour stuff. However, I had to taste just one...and guess what, I couldn't stop! These are like candy! With just the right mix of sweet and sour. And they are SO easy to make---I used other reviewer's suggestions as follows: 1 T corn syrup to 2 T water, toss cranberries in mixture. 1 c sugar in a Ziploc bag. I used a slotted spoon to drain berries well before placing in bag, then closing and tossing well in the sugar. Spread it all out on wax paper on a cookie sheet, and a few hours later I had beautiful, tasty frosted cranberries!!! And I do mean tasty. All of my coworkers raved and several asked for the recipe. Success!

I have to say I was hesitant about these, and at first bite they were sour, but after a couple I found myself addicted to them! H even liked these and he doesn't like cranberries.

Since I found this recipe a few years ago, I have made them every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. All my friends are hooked on them too. I found that a little bit of unflavored gelatin mixed with water works very well in place of the eggs or corn syrup. I put a small amount of sugar in a pie plate and roll a few cranberries around, then dump them onto a large waxed-paper lined cookie sheet to dry. Once they are all rolled, I use a sifter and sprinkle the tops with a little more sugar. The leftover used sugar can be sifted and used to fluff the bottom of a glass bowl/jar for displaying the cranberries. Also, try sugared mint leaves to tuck into the cranberry display.Very festive and tasty!

I probably shouldn't be reviewing because I used Karo syrup and a bit of water...but the same technique.  They are elegant and delicious.  Thanks for sharing.

We used these for the centerpiece decorations for my daughter's wedding Nov 28 in Williamsburg, VA.  The wedding color was red and the cranberries fit Colonial Williamsburg's Christmas style of decorating with fruit.  We used pillar candles in hurricane vases and surrounded the candles with the frosted cranberries. They were very easy to make, inexpensive, and made a classy and unusual centerpiece.  Even with the sugar they're a bit tart, but many people loved eating the extra frosted cranberries.  I found that the amount of water and egg white would cover 4-5 C of berries.  To better control the amount of sugar frosting - roll the cranberries in enough sugar to glaze and let dry for an hour, then sprinkle more sugar on top to get the amount of frosting you want.

Awesome.  Crowd pleaser.  BEAUTIFUL!!!  Here are my hints:
-If you find it hard to stomach the smell of the egg whites, try substituting the water with orange juice.  I did that and my picky guests recognized the difference right away.
-Also to make it a little more "festive", I added Allspice, Nutmeg, and Clove (a teeeny tiny bit) just to spice it up a bit.  Play around with the quantities to find what suits you best.

Amazing recipe.  I'm happy I found this!!!

I LOVED these. Such a great idea. I have some tips. The egg whites were essential to use as glue. It firmly cements the sugar on and crystallizes the whole thing. I don't think corn syrup would have produced as good results. I used EGG WHITE POWDER dissolved in water. No salmonella to worry about. Then I found that the sugar gets ruined quickly because the excess binder (egg whites) gunk it up and it's unusable for the intended purpose. So that's what I only used a small amount of sugar at a time in a shallow bowl. I found that dropping the egg white drenched cranberries from high into the sugar cut back on uneven globs of sugar becoming attached. Then I rolled it around and I used them to garnish cranberry cocktails, cranberry mousse, and to put out at dessert just as they are. They're addictive to snack on.

Used corn syrup instead of egg whites. 3/4 cups sugar probably would have been enough. People that don't normally like cranberries liked these! Used on pumpkin gingerbread (from allrecipies) as decorative topping.

WOW! These are amazing.  I had never heard of frosted cranberries, and was truthfully a bit skeptical, but a friend told me about them, and I had to try it.  Brought them to family thanksgiving and we couldn't believe how quickly we ate them all.  I used pasturized egg whites.  These are beautiful as well as delicious.  I've ben instructed to bring them to christmas dinner as well.  :)

These make a beautiful garnish for a holiday dessert, or even to be eaten plain.  Using the recipe directions they don't take any time at all to make, although they do require drying time.  I found I couldn't resist grabbing a few every time I'd pass the counter where they were drying.  They are delicious, with the sweet/tart combination and the crunch of the sugar coating.

What a burst of flavor!  So simple to make and a beautiful presentation.  Using lovestohost suggestion, I replaced the egg white with light karo and water, mixing it in a bowl and coating the berries all at once by tossing with a spoon.  Then I dropped them one by one into a zip lock bag with sugar, gently shaking the bag as I dropped.  I poured them onto a cookie sheet to dry.  It only took minutes to prepare.   Thank you for sharing such a beautiful treat!

I made these on thanksgiving because it was on the homepage as a favorite photo, they were so pretty I just had to try it. They were very easy to make ONCE I realized the trick to coating them: (sorry if this was obvious to you, maybe i'm just slow) Don't roll them around in the sugar with your fingers just drop a couple in the plate with the sugar and gently shake the plate in circular motions, the cranberries will roll around and coat themselves. Once I figured this out I was able to coat the whole bag quickly.   As for the taste, the first one is not so good, but after your mouth gets used to the sourness, by the 2nd or 3rd one, you won't be able to stop eating them! And they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Just drop a couple on top to instantly make any dessert seem fancy.

After buying a bag of cranberries for the first time, I popped one in my mouth and was horrified at what I tasted! I must quickly find a way to eat these that won't make me gag! Lo and behold, here we are. I followed other people's suggestions and used corn syrup in place of the egg. Delicious! I gave some to my friend who was reluctant (apparently she had the same thought about cranberries as I did), and we ended up sitting around munching on them, and before we knew it, the whole batch was gone!

These looked beautiful on my Christmas table. I presented them in a pretty bowl and my guests were so intrigued. My daughter, who can be hard to please sometimes, took home any that were left. I had purchased a bag of fresh cranberries and used half for cranberry sauce and half made up this pretty addition and new Christmas tradition.

SUPER EASY and tasty.  Pleasantly surprised!  I put the cranberries in a Ziploc bag with the sugar and shook but some of the sugar clumped up so they weren't quite as neat as the picture on the recipe.  I think it helped with the time it took for that step, though.  I had problems finding pasteurized egg whites but only because I had never bought them before.  (It was in small print on the front of the box.)  As always, better ingredients yield better results!

I used this technique to also "frost" some evergreen sprigs. Together with the frosted cranberries on top of my cranberry cheesecake, it looked really festive. As for eating them, they were just alright and not really worth the calories for me.

If you are diabetic, use a sugar substitute like *Splenda*.  It tastes the same as using sugar and cuts the

At first I did not really love them, but then they kind of grew on me and were really good. Even the kids loved them. I did not find them hard to roll at all. I used 1 T Karo and 1 T water. They reminded me of those sour sweet candies the kids eat.

I opted to use corn syrup because that is what I had.  These were good.  I didn't take the time to roll them well, so they weren't as pretty as some of the pictures.  I can't stop eating them!

These are a cute decoration. I used corn syrup instead of egg white for safety reasons. Make carefully, or the sugar clumps and the berries look weird.

These cranberries are awesome! Who knew you could eat cranberries raw, without cooking them? The sweet and tart is an excellent combination. I also substituted corn syrup for the pasteurized egg whites. The sugar stuck to the cranberries just fine! Thanks for the great recipe!

Beautiful presentation. I used corn syrup instead of egg white as someone suggested to make these suitable for vegans and people with egg allergies. They are delicious so if you like cranberries try them.

Easy and delicious. My 9 year old prepared these. We used corn syrup. Some tasted very much like grapes.

Just beautiful and delicious!  Kind of like a "fresh" sour patch kid!  I used 1 tbsp. of light corn syrup in place of the egg because my daughter is allergic to eggs.  It was a bit messy and time consuming but so easy for such a pretty and tasty result!  I served mine in a crystal bowl and they looked gorgeous.  A lot of guests at my in-laws' were a bit too nervous to try them (which is true for everything different at my in-laws'!!) but I sure loved them!

Absolutely delicious.  My cranberries are extremely tart, and with the sugar they taste almost like sweet and sour candies, which I love.  Delish!  I took the lazy way out, and mixed the cranberries with the egg and water in a bowl, then drained and mixed the sugar in the bowl with the cranberries.  The sugar bunches up a bit that way but they are still pretty and taste great.  thanks for the recipe!

I thought they were a little tart but people loved them at our Family Thanksgiving yesterday.  They are beautiful and very festive.  I used corn syrup because I didn't have any pasturized egg whites.  Next time I'll try to find the egg whites.  Also, this would be delicious combined with some candied orange peels mixed in.  Love it - thank you for the recipe.

HELPFUL HINT** Fine or Berry sugar will work best with coating the berries fully. :-) Great Idea! They are amazingly tasty ! You can use this same idea to coat edible flower's (very pretty on pansies), blueberries, rasberries and blackberries are some of my fav's.

Delicious and easy.  I brought these to a holiday party and everyone raved.  A little more time consuming than I expected as I did about 1-2 lbs of Cranberries, however very pretty in a trifle dish as well.

Personally, I LOVED these!  Funny how many people just don't like cranberries!  I will most certainly make again but in a smaller quantity for myself.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out great, and looked so festive!  I like the idea another had about rolling them in corn syrup instead of pasteurized egg whites prior to the granulated sugar.  I may try that the next time, so they will be even less tart!

Wanting to try this recipe for years I finally have. I wasn't sure how to rate them. For garnishing they were a solid 5+. I put part of the sugar in a foil pie pan and swirled them around and it couldn't have been easier. I removed them with a slotted spoon to a piece of parchment paper. I continued adding more sugar and more cranberries. They were beautiful! When they dried, I promptly popped one in my mouth and thought, oh oh! Although they were sweet & tangy at the same time, I didn't like biting into all the hardened sugar. They just weren't my cup of tea to snack on. I will continue to make and decorate with them, but I prefer not to eat them. I guess  it's just me, ha ha.

OMG!!! The frosted cranberries made my "Cranberry Lime Splash" cake Picture Perfect. Did I forget to mention SCRUMPTIOUS???? I used meringue powder in place of egg whites and Cranberry Splash soda instead of water. Gotta go eat some now.

This technique also works on other fruits like grapes. Beautiful results. Don't be afraid of the egg whites. If you handle your food properly and use pasteurized egg whites, you shouldn't have any problem.

These were beautiful! I ended up having to use a lot more sugar because it all kept getting soaked by the egg whites and then didn't work. Next time I'll remember to drain the cranberries instead of taking them directly from the bowl with the egg whites

Beautiful and delicious!  I used 1/2 tablespoon water mixed with 1/2 tablespoon corn syrup in place of the egg whites.  Also, I used my food processor to make superfine sugar.  Just pulse the 1 cup of sugar about 10-15 times.

So elegant, and so easy!  These were the talk of the evening.  I used pastuerized egg whites (in the dairy section).  I initially rolled them in super fine baker's sugar, but that ended up turning into a runny mess.  So, I rerolled in regular sugar, and had much better results.  I made them for a garnish, but was surprised by how many people were eating them - even people who said they normally don't like cranberries.

These look beautiful but don't taste all that great.  I wasn't sure if the egg whites at my grocery store were pasteurized so I used the corn syrup which worked great.  I used them to garnish a cheese and fruit plate at Thanksgiving and it made for an awesome presentation (I sprinkled them around on the tray).  I definitely would not just sit them out as a snack because they are still very sour but they work great as a garnish!

5 to look at, 3 for amount of effort and taste.  It takes about half an hour to coat the cranberries evenly, coating them all at once makes them clumpy. And it STILL is too tart even with the sugar on top.  And finally, the pasteurized egg whites are not a kitchen ingredient that most people have handy.  My ravenous boyfriend had one and made a face.  Not a keeper.  Try making the cranberry pie instead, it's easy, pretty and tasty!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if possible!!!  How perfectly simple and very, very delicious.  I can't stop eating them.  I used the corn syrup as I did not have the eggs and they came out perfectly.  I rinsed the cranberries in a sifter strainer, drizzled a small amount of corn syrup on them and then rolled them in a pie pan with sugar.  I will be taking these to all of my Christmas parties this year. 

Update:  All my kids friends are eating these now!  I think they are much better than candy!

Love it.  Wish it didn't use raw eggs but I give these out at the holidays or make them as a healthy snack for my son and they are always a hit!

This turned out pretty good. I put the Cranberry and Egg Whites in a strainer to drain the egg whites off. The first batch turned out well.  With the second batch I didn't straing well enough and it ended up a gloppy mess in places.  Won't make this again as my family doesn't like fresh cranberry tartness.

These were a great treat. Very unique. I will admit that  I took far longer than the 5 minute posted prep time to roll those little cranberries through the sugar.

This is a fabulous mix of sweet and tart!  The cranberries really shine in this recipe.  I did NOT use egg whites.  They are not required for this recipe and you don't need to use them.  The sugar adheres nicely to the cranberries using just water.  Eliminating the egg altogether is great for people who have an egg allergy or are vegan.  I simply  rinsed the cranberries with tap water, drained, and rolled on a baking sheet with granulated organic, unrefined, evaporated cane juice.  Very good and also very nutritious.  Happy ThanksLiving!

This is an AWESOME recipe! Just what I needed to decorate my Thanksgiving pies - with extras left over to munch on. The recipe is perfect as is - can't wait for the reviews at dinner tonight. Thanks for sharing!

I loved making these "snow" berries! Beautiful, easy snack you can make the day before. Set out a bowl before dinner, use on your pies for dessert and hopefully there will be some left over for snacking the next day. I recommend letting them sit out overnight to ensure the sugar is dry.  After two hours there was still an adequate amount of sugar flaking off the berries, so I covered them with a clean dry towel and let them dry another eight hours. Another tip: make a double batch. You'll eat half before they ever reach a destination.

Made this as directed and it turned out great!! You can buy pasteurized Pete & Gerry's egg whites by the eggs in the grocery store. Use a slotted spoon to pull the cranberries out of the egg white and water mixture to keep them from clumping and keep some sugar to the side to sprinkle over top where they may stay bare. Thanks for sharing!!

I substituted powdered sugar which formed a nice crust.

These are yummy. My family gathers around eating these before dinner every Thanksgiving, they're more popular than the other appetizers! I also use corn syrup with a little water because I don't usually have pasteurized egg whites. Plus corn syrup sounds better with cranberries than uncooked eggs to me...
