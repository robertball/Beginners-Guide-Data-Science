I cook for a tiny 91 year old woman who loves spicy dishes, as well as mac and cheese.  I read the first review and doubled the sharp cheese (extra sharp) and, rather than American cheese, I added a can of cheddar cheese soup.  Because my client likes so much spice, I added a can (undrained to compensate for the extra cheese) of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, threw in a few shakes of red pepper flakes, and the result was Wonderful.  This is a great recipe!...creamy, thick, a little kick (more if you choose), and, hopefully, will get discovered.  Thank you so much!

I doubled this recipe. I did throw in double the amount of sharp cheddar cheese (16 ounces for a doubled recipe). Other than that, I made no other changes. The macaroni and cheese was VERY creamy and packed a great punch. This recipe's a keeper--NO LEFTOVERS.

This is the first time I've ever made mac and cheese in a crock-pot and with summer temperatures soaring outside, this was a great way to cook it and not heat the house up with the oven. I did double the recipe, other than that followed exactly. The boys and their girlfriends loved it, it's not the same as oven mac and cheese but it was nice and creamy and we all enjoyed it. I stirred it about three times in the two hours and it was perfectly done in the time specified. I really liked it with just the green chilies and may try that next time omitting the tomatoes and onions at the end.

This is delicious and I just love that it makes a creamy mac and cheese without all of the processed  like in the boxes.
I also doubled the cheddar as per others recommendations and added a can of diced tomatoes (juice and all) b/c I was too lazy to cut a fresh one.  Next time I will cook up some ground beef in taco seasoning and add that too.
LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!

My kids flipped out over this recipe!! I did double it and add cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of fresh toms and a can of corn. Used Pepper Jack and sharp cheddar and it was so yummy!! My boy woke up in the morning and asked if he could have left overs for breakfast!!!  Now that's a win win!!!

This last time I made this I added a fresh Jalepano and cilantro. So good!!

I used 12 oz. sharp cheddar cheese, and threw in a can of rotal (undrained) in place of the tomatoes and green chilis at the beginning of the cooking process.  I also used whole wheat pasta.  I omitted the green onions as DH does not care for them, but I could see them working well in this.  It came out just stellar, nice and creamy and thick, and the flavor was great.  I think what I liked most about this recipe is that unlike baked mac and cheese, I didn't have to put a whole stick of butter, or any butter in it!

This was my first time making mac n' cheese in the crockpot, and I loved it.  The cooking time was perfect in my older crockpot as it doesn't get as hot as the newer models.  I had 6 young adults, all newly married over for dinner and they pretty much finished the bowl!  I only had white American cheese, so I cubed that up.  We liked the mild spiciness to this recipe and it will be one that I make again.  Thanks henrythe8thiam for sharing your recipe.

This is the first time making slow cooker mac and cheese.  I'm used to making baked mac and cheese with a roux based white sauce with lots of butter.  

Substituted PIPE RIGATI cooked for 7 minutes vs the 10-12.  CREAM CHEESE for the American cheese, 8 oz of SHARP CHEDDAR vs the 4 oz.  (per several reviews), 1-10 oz can of DICED TOMATOES WITH GREEN CHILIS (drained)  saving juice for later.  DH does not like his food too spicy.  

Added green onion on the sides....  yes, DH doesn't like them.  

Check slow cooker every half hour since my model is very old and very hot. 

Very creamy, and so easy to make.  This is not your old fashioned baked in the oven mac and cheese.  

This is a keeper for sure.  Thank you

Update...... I will try this with mexican style cheeses next time.

I usually try to make a recipe as written the first time but used cream cheese instead of chunk American and put in Rotel instead of chilies and tomatoes.  The cook time for my particular crockpot was not as recipe stated.  Only took an hour.  Was pretty good anyway...almost like chili cheese dip.  Will try it again maybe put on low and/or double the recipe.

I did make a few changes and realize my 5 stars point to that fact. However the essence of this dish remains intact. I too used Rotel tomatoes with Chillies and doubled the cheese. I also replaced the cubed American cheese with cheese soup.  Either version would have been a big hit with our family.

I did what some of the others suggested and doubled the cheddar cheese. It's delicious even without the extra cheese and is almost spicy enough for my husband.

I have made this multiple times, it's quick and easy and delicious. Very creamy and rich. I only cook it for 1-1.5 hrs, it doesn't need 2 hours for the pasta to become tender

I used only cheddar cheese 4 oz sharp and the rest medium.  I also subbed a can rotel for the individual can s of tomato and chilies.  It was still very mild and if I make again may add some jalapeno peppers or other stronger flavors.

It's still in the crockpot, but I just had to try it. Oh boy! I thought it may turn out too spicy, but it's perfect. I added 8 oz of pepperjack cheese instead of all cheddar for even more oompf.  I forgot to hold out the tomatoes and onions until the end and added them into the mixture along with everything else, but it turned out wonderfully. Thanks for a great recipe!

oh. my. word. This is delicious!!! definitely putting this recipe in my permanent collection! the only thing I did different from the recipe stated is using canned diced fire roasted tomatoes and that was only because I'm too lazy to cut real tomatoes cuz let's face it.. cutting tomatoes is a mess, juice flying everywhere, chunks of goop left over... Ya no thanks haha! seriously though, try out this recipe!
