I made this with a few changes. Used 85% turkey and no milk, cheese or oats in the loaf part. Used 1/2 cup breadcrumbs instead. Filling made with mushrooms, onion & spinach. Added cheese as its own layer on top of the spinach. Very good!

I made this as written, except for using fresh spinach, which is what I had on  hand.  I sautéed the mushrooms and onions, then added the spinach to the skillet and sautéed just until it was wilted.  The meat loaf was pretty good, but a bit bland; next time, I would add minced garlic and maybe some Worcestershire to the turkey. This is a healthy alternative to my usual (much-loved by my family) beef-based meat loaf. I'll make it again, but will try to jazz it up a little.

I hate spinach so I used a dressing with broccoli florets only. Also I made individual sized loafs. Will have several meals from this.

I was excited to try this recipe. I made it exactly as described except I used a whole egg not just the egg white and fresh spinach rather than frozen. I am disappointed to report that it was very bland and therefore my rating of only 3 stars. Next time, I'll need to add considerable seasoning to the meat and/or spinach filling.

I made it using 1 whole egg, whole milk, and I used sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella (just bc this is all what I had in the house) I also added about 1/2 tsp of ground fennel. It was absolutely delicious! An easy recipe, and 5 stars.
