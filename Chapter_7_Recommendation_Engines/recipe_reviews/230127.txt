This was a delicious, moist bread that made excellent use of left-over sweet potatoes.  Allow the bread to sit for some time to allow the spice flavors to meld for  ultimate flavor.  For best results, make a day ahead.

This is delicious, however, I would like to see if I can get away with less sugar. Next time I make this I plan to keep the 2/3 C brown sugar and the sweetened condensed milk, but omit the 2/3 C white sugar.

WOW!  This is excellent!  I didn't have bisquick  so I used the substitute from this site.  I didn't have condensed milk so I googled a substitute and waa laa!  I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly.  I didn't have all of the spices listed but I did have pumpkin pie spice which I used instead. This was very impressive!  I used bundt muffin pans and then topped it with a googled pecan streusel.  EXCELLENT!!   They were awesome with and without the added streusel

My personal best ever quick bread! Substituted old mushy bananas cuz thats what i had on hand, and subbed in flour, baking powder, and baking soda for the bisquick cuz i didn't have that, either.  google "bisquick substitute" and it will pop up. or, look for similar recipes- may seem common sense, but there are new cooks on this site, also. I would have included the measurements, but I doubled the recipe and added tons of nuts and raisins and got 5 loaves, so i prolly played with the measurements a bit. Used white sugar only cuz the sweetened condensed milk  i used was actually called La Lechera (Dulce de Leche) which is a caramel flavor.  Also subbed Butter Flavor Crisco for the butter, again- cuz that is what i had! I added both walnuts and pecans and raisins as the last step before baking.  For the new cooks, put all nuts and raisins in a bowl with enough flour to coat all of them, stir around with a fork, and THEN  add that to your wet batter.  This very important step prevents your nuts and raisins from sinking to the bottom of the pan.  Then i cooked at 325* for 1 hour and 350* for 10-15 minutes or so for a PERFECT BEAUTIFUL CRUST!  Did it that way cuz my last quick bread burned around the edges and was dry. FYI, i happened to have some whole wheat flour on hand that i forgot to put into the batter so i used it to dust  my pans after I greased them. That really made a difference in the wa

Had to make this into muffins to keep the portions under control.  Hubby would have eaten an entire loaf by himself.  And he swears to hate sweet potatoes!

I had so much sweet potatoes leftover. Since we use so much butter in our sweet potatoes I used about 1/2-3/4 cup butter. Didn't have sweet condensed milk so I made my own!  Thanks to the internet!  I just couldn't get a clean knife after baking so it over cooked on the outside!  But the bread itself is really tasty and moist!  I would definitely make this again!

Super easy to make and super moist. Very delicious and sweet. My family loved it, and they are very finicky and critical - hard to please. But they love it.

Yes  I would make it again.  I  reduce the amount of sugar by half for both the brown sugar and the white sugar. It was still sweet enough. I think it could’ve used more nuts. There were many bites without any nuts. I  think it would’ve been better with another cup of nuts.  Raisins might’ve been a nice addition too.  It was still delicious.  I made it in small loaf pans and it made five loaves.

Was not sure about using Bisquick but it made a very good bread.  Recipe didn't ask for vanilla (seemed odd) so I added 1 TBS spiced rum.  I will bake this again and share with friends.

this is a good recipe but I had to make some changes. I added 1 cup of pecans and 1 cup of coconut and 3 cups of flour.
