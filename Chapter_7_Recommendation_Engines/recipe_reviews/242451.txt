This was great, the kids loved it too! My husband especially loved the feta on it. I find salting potatoes before they are baked makes them stick to the pan, so I sprinkled with a little sea salt just after they were cooked. Otherwise I followed everything else in the recipe! We had this with soulvaki style chicken tenders and tzatziki sauce, delish!

I LOVE the flavor combination in this! I chose to cook mine on the BBQ since it was too hot to turn the oven on today. In addition to the lemon zest i grilled half a lemon and then squeezed it over right before serving. Also added in 3 Smashed garlic cloves, just because i love garlic. I used Greek seasoning that i received in my Missing ingredient Package..and it is great! The Mint was awesome!..i will be making this again. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

Tastes like a bit of "Greece" very yummy... The mint is a surprise addition, and a must! Really enhances the flavour... I used the Greek seasoning from Wellseasoned.ca that has terrific flavour and not to much salt!

Delicious. I used Greek seasoning from Missing Ingredient. Love the combination of flavours. Although I love mint I think it was not really necessary. Also, because I am lazy I just mixed the oil, seasoning, and zest together and tossed the potatoes in the mixture before spreading on the pan. I needed a little more than 20 minutes to cook. Would definitely make again!

We really enjoyed these! I made the recipe as is, except that I used mini potatoes instead of the large. My picky father-in-law complimented me on the potatoes, and so did my semi-picky husband :) it was my first time ever using fresh mint, so I didn't know what to expect, but these were really good. Next time I might add a bit of minced garlic & some onions, but that's just because I love that stuff! Would definitely make this again!

i LOVED this recipe.  i made this recipe as written, but changed the prep a bit. i mixed the olive oil with the herbs and lemon zest, then poured over my potato wedges and tossed to coat. they baked up nicely. i liked the way some of the feta melted after sprinkling over the hot wedges. i didn't really get much of the mint flavour. maybe because i use lemon mint as it was all i could find. i will definitely make these again!

These were a big hit. The mint with the greek seasoning was brilliant. I loved them just as they are in the recipe, but since I shared them with 4 twenty year olds, I cut them thinner, baked them on parchment double time until they were super crispy, and added poutine cheese and gravy... wow!

A flavourful and interesting twist on potato wedges/fries.  These are a hit with any meal.  Fast and easy to make; I'd definitely do them again. I fogpt to add the mint whe I made them, so I'll have to remember to add it next time I make this.

Great flavor and excellent side dish for our chicken Souvlaki served along with my tzatziki. I changed the coating process by adding olive oil, Greek seasoning, lemon zest, salt & black pepper in a large bowl and mixing well. I then added the potato wedges and gently stirred until evenly coated. I also doubled the cooking time from 20 to 40 minutes in the oven as the wedges were quite large. Definitely a keeper but I will buy medium-size potatoes next time to reduce the cooking time.

I made these on the barbeque with the ribs I was doing for dinner. Mine cooked at 400 degrees for 40 minutes, they would not have been done in 20, I agree I do like my potatoes a bit crispier. We really liked the flavour though, I scaled to 4 potatoes but only used 1/2 tbsp of Greek seasoning as I felt 2 tbsps would be too much.

Very good. Followed the recipe to a T.  Would really like the potato to be a little crispier.  I'll add a little more seasoning to them next time.  Quick and easy.
