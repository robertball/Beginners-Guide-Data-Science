This is a simple and perfect sweet potato dish. Love the fact that they are NOT overly sweet. (We don't care for the overly sugared/marshmallowed concoctions that are so popular) The brandy compliments the potatoes beautifully and the raisins add a nice touch. You can bake, peel and slice the potatoes ahead of time and keep in the frig. till needed which is an added bonus. I will try this with dried cranberries for the holidays. This dish will definitely be on my Thanksgiving table. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't measure anything and it still came out so yummy :) I love how the brown sugar carmelizes with the brandy!

This was really good and a nice alternative to the sweet potato casserole we usually have with our holiday meals. I did have to bake it for an hour to get the potatoes tender but otherwise made it as written.

Made as directed. Not much brandy flavor, but a nice addition.

This is a nice, simple side dish. I tried both golden raisins and dried cranberries, and the raisins were definitely better. I also sprinkled on some kosher salt. Next time I will add butter on top of the potatoes as well.

This is the recipe for you  if you don't like your sweet potatoes too sweet.  I made about 6-7 lbs of potatoes so that I can have left over but only have about 2 cups left.  Prepared it night before and just stick it in the oven about an hour before dinner. Easy recipe. Thanks for sharing
