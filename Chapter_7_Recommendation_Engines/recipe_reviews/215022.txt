I combined the olive oil , several cloves of minced fresh garlic, salt and pepper together and brushed it onto the portobellos. I guess the above mixture was a brush-on marinade. I put the portobellos aside while I prepared the other ingredients and then broiled the cap side first for about 2 minutes and the gill side, stacked with roasted red peppers, basil, cheese and tomato for about 5 minutes. I served these with the allrecipes.com Burger or Hot Dog Buns and these sandwiches came out great.

Unbelieveable!  Restaurant quality.  I roasted a yellow pepper (only thing I had) and used one side of an everything bagel (again, only thing I had) and it was unbelieveable!!  Didn't change anything else! Can't wait to make it again!

Did some shopping yesterday and found some really nice portobello's and with nearly all other ingredients on hand, decided to give this recipe a try. I used thinly sliced red onion, a bit of garlic powder, forgot I was out of the fresh and tomatoes and basil out of my garden. The sandwiches were delicious and well seasoned. Very flavorful, easy, and a great substitute for a meatless meal.  Adding this to our list of favorites.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good recipe!  I would use a very large pepper or at least two small ones since the one we used was a little too small and would triple up on the mayonnaise/garlic sauce since the teaspoons said to use in the receipe really doesn't make that much for the big mushroom caps so we made more to spread on both the bottom and the top buns for each sandwich.  Everything else was perfect.  Very flavorful!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!  Will definitely make again :)

Excellent....used vidalia onion that I grilled with the red peppers. Fresh basil is key and nice ripe tomatoes...I ate mine bunless for carb reasons...fork and knifed it...lol...I also omitted the mayo and used a drizzle of Honey Dijon Balsamic Vinaigrette from this site...amazing! Served with a tossed salad. Great meatless Monday meal. Thanks!

Amazing! This recipe deserves its great reviews thats for sure.  I grilled some onions and red bell peppers together and added some of the balsamic glaze.  It was absolutely fantastic.  For an extra kick try pepper jack cheese instead of provolone. :) thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Excellent...I had this in a restaurant once and wanted to try it myself. I did mix some fresh minced garlic in the the oil to baste the mushrooms, and used pepperjack cheese. My husband was making noises while eating this that makes me know it is a keeper. Will be grilling this again real soon.

Great! Followed the recipe except for using jarred roasted red peppers because I didn't have any fresh to roast myself. Great fresh flavors. Thanks!!! :)

I dropped the red pepper for a tomato. Used some fresh baked ciabatta bread from Whole Foods. Can not believe how good this was.

Don't have a grill, so used a G. Foreman grill.  (Wish more recipes would offer this as an alternative).  Mixed fresh, crushed garlic w/olive oil, salt and pepper and brushed onions and jarred, roasted peppers and then grilled them.   Did the same w/the mushroom.  Love garlic, so added more to the mayo.  

Guldens mustard on the mushroom side; garlic mayo on the lettuce/tomato side.  Delicious!!

This is a wonderful meatless sandwich. Try omitting the tomato and basil, and use smoked mozzarella instead. It's heaven on bun. Next time I will make it as a panini.

Wow! This is so easy and so delicious! Yet, it does have a "restaruant quality" taste to it.  I added some balsamic vinegar to the olive oil mixture which gave the portobello's a nice glaze. This was a wonderful combination of flavors and perfect for using up really nice ripe tomatoes from the garden! Thanks for a great recipe!

The star of this show is the meaty grilled mushroom and the roasted garlic mayo. Do not forget to get rid of the black  gills...yucky, no flavor and colors up the sandwich.(use a spoon to gently scrape the inside of the mushroom) Fresh basil is genius. The sandwich needs a decent kaiser bun that does not overwhelm...and some beautiful tomatoes. And having made this several times, the sandwich gets cool too fast. So...wrap individual sandwiches in foil, bake 10 mins or so at 375 if you use a melting cheese like mozzarella, munster or brick. great. If not...then just before you serve, add fresh mozzarella, the tomato and fresh basil. People will want this before a burger.

Fantastic!  To the buffalo mozzarella, I added a dash of balsamic vinegar, and my wife, who can be skeptical, raved about it.  Easy to make, and satisfying for when we want a hardy meal, but we are trying to reduce beef consumption.

I love mushrooms, so this was a real treat.  I didn't have basil on hand, but used lettuce and tomato.  I'd advise anyone making this to pat the mushrooms dry or risk having a wet bun.  Overall, it was great for a mushroom lover...and I'd even eat it without the bread.

Delicious!  Takes a bit of coordination to get it all together at the right time, but worth the effort.  Be sure to serve with napkins--it's tricky to eat neatly!

Hubby and I loved this for a quick Sunday lunch.  I roasted the mushrooms, red peppers, and onions on the outdoor grill.  (I was out of garlic, but that could ONLY have made it better; after all, roasted garlic makes EVERYTHING better.)  It was delicious and my husband was, once again, quite impressed with my culinary abilities.  (He has no idea how easy it was, and I don't intend to tell him.)

I made mine with the oil salt fresh ground pepper, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 t. dried crushed basil, 1 T. balsamic vinegar, 1/4 c. water in a resealable bag, mixed it up, tossed in 4 portobello mushrooms,  the onion and peppers. Let it marinade until the grill gets hot. Tastes just like steak. Even the fussy hubby likes that one.
