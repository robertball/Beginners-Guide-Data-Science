This was very tasty and easy to make.  I agree with the previous reviewer that suggested using less gnocchi.  I think next time, I will put in about 12 oz.  Also, I will use half and half instead of heavy cream.  It was a bit rich for me.  Also, I recommend using a dutch oven or something similar instead of a skillet, just so scooping the soup out is easier.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow as most soups are better on the second day.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

My wife and I loved it! We made it as printed except we added sliced mushrooms and used mini tortellini instead of gnocchi. Delicious.

Simple recipe for a delicious fast weeknight supper. I added about 1/4 cup of chopped Parmesan cheese rind (that I had been saving for just such an occasion) with the chicken broth and cream. It added a wonderful depth of flavor to the soup and I didn't have to add any additional salt.

This recipe was the best recipe I think Ive ever tried! I was BLOWNNNN AWAY. AMAZING. The only things I did differently is instead of adding salt to it , I just used chicken broth with sodium because I had it on hand and I used 1 lb instead of a half pound of Italian sausage.

I never like to rate a recipe unless it was prepared pretty much exactly as stated, but this was SO good that I must share.  My only deviations were to use hot italian turkey sausage, half and half instead of cream, and Trader Joe's brand frozen Gorgonzola gnocchi since there was no plain gnocchi to be found there that day.  With the addition of the gorgonzola sauce in the gnocchi, I decided to leave out the parmesan for the first tasting, and found it wasn't needed.  This was absolutely delicious served with some crusty, buttered baguette.  I will have to try it one of these days exactly as directed, and I do expect it to be a little richer with full-fat ingredients.  But even with half and half and turkey sausage, this soup reminds me of Alfredo.  It is absolute comfort food and I look forward to making it again.

I just made mine the exact same way as this recipe but I added Romano and Parmesan cheese and substituted the spinach for kale. I also couldn't help but add some bacon to it as well! Turned out amazing!

I was looking for something to make because I had a pound of sausage in fridge that needed to be cooked and came across this recipe. I did add some fresh mushrooms to it because they were in the fridge also.  This soup has great flavor.

Really enjoyed this dish. Easy to make. Used a combo of hot and mild sausage. And maybe a little extra garlic. Family enjoyed it ( and they’re kinda picky) but will make it again

Great recipe.  I used homemade gnocchi and sub'd half and half for heavy cream.  This will go into our regular rotation.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was actually good!  Never had Gnocchi before and could have left it out this receipt not really needed it was amazing without it (probably used the wrong type. Maybe if I would’ve chosen one made with ricotta I’d like it better).

Fantastic and super easy. I doubled the stock/cream and used 3/4 of a package of gnocchi. Added corn, red pepper, baby portobellos, and parsley. A new quick favorite.

Loved it! I made a change to the gnocchi since we live in a small town and they don’t sell it in our small grocery store so I added cheese tortellini instead and it was delicious.

This is very good soup!  I changed it up a bit.  I make it in a dutch oven because it's easier.  I cook the sausage and drain reserving about 2 tablespoons to saute the onions and garlic for a few minutes until tender.  I don't use flour or tomatoes (family doesn't like tomatoes).  I add the chicken broth and heat until bubbly then add the gnocchi, spinach and salt and pepper to taste.  Simmer until the gnocchi floats about 3 minutes then add 1 cup of fat free half and half.  Less calories and keeps it from being too rich.

This was great. I’ve been looking for a gnocchi soup along the lines of Olive Garden’s (creamy). All the chicken ones I’ve found are bland and taste like chicken noodle soup plus gnocchi, no matter how much of a copycat they swear to be. 

This was flavorful and just what I wanted - creamy. My only adjustment was hot Italian sausage and a teaspoon of chicken bouillon per cup of broth (something I do in every recipe with broth because broth doesn’t have much flavor). It is very filling and rich.

I converted this to cook in the instant pot. I sautéed the sausage, added in the onion, added in the chicken broth and gnocchi. I cooked this for 10 minutes on manual (high) pressure. Afterwards I released the pressure and added in the spinach, cream slurry (flour mixed with cream) and garlic. I found I didn’t need/want the butter in the soup or the tomatoes. Very good, hearty soup!

My fiancé loved this recipe! The only change I made was simply adding in some creamed sherry toward the end. This would be great with any sort of meat or seafood. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I got this recipe in my email this morning, and realized that I had all of the ingredients, so I made it for dinner this evening.

OMG, what a fantastic soup! Everyone loved it, including the kids. It has a very sophisticated blend of flavors and to think - no herbs and spices! I suppose the sausage takes care of that.

I always make a recipe exactly as written the first time, and this had only one minor exception - my Italian sausage was in casings, but it was easy enough to remove. I also doubled the recipe only because I didn't want to waste the whole pound of sausage.

It took me less than 45 minutes from start to finish. I did the chopping and other prep while the sausage was browning, but there was no way to hurry the cream/broth mixture to boil.

I'm going to put some in a small container and freeze it, just to see what happens to the cream base and the gnocchi. I hope it defrosts without compromising the flavor and texture.

This is now in my family's rotation - really "restaurant quality"!

This was a hit, hearty and delicious! I used about 12oz of tortellini instead of gnocchi and about 1/4c each of chopped roasted red pepper and artichoke. Next time I’ll  add more tomato too.

Very tasty! Used beef broth instead of chicken, ground beef instead of Italian sausage, and added sliced carrot and zucchini instead of spinach. Only added red pepper flakes in addition to salt and pepper. Really good flavour and texture! Husband

OMGosh, this is so good!  Made it pretty much as is with turkey italian hot sausage, but didn't measure anything, used half & half, and added a few things: a heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic, a 12oz pkg of mushrooms, a 1/2 a carrot chopped very small, and 1/2 yellow squash chopped small.  Thank you!

This is really good! I added some chicken breast that I had in the fridge that was begging to be used, I also added some portabella mushrooms to the onion sauté'. Other than those 2 small things I followed the recipe. The flavor developed as it cooked, I added no salt but did add a pinch of pepper. This will return to my menu.

This was so yummy, though I found the process of cooking it with the flour and cream to be very time consuming (and a lot of stirring).  I am always afraid to crank the heat too much when with the cream for fear of burning it.  Next time I will make a separate roux and add it near the end of cooking.  I used half and half instead of cream and it was very creamy.  Oh, I added a pinch of cayenne in addition to the salt and black pepper.

I used arugula instead of the spinach and added some bacon. Substituted heavy cream with half and half. I made a side dish knowing it would be a heavy soup but we both were extremely full after 1 bowl. Amazing recipe!!!

01-18-16 ~ A nice soup for chilly winter day.  I had a package of sweet potato gnocchi, so that is what I used.  The texture of the soup was nice, thick but it still had broth.  Next time I would add a little more garlic and maybe a shake or two of red pepper flakes.  All-in-all a soup we both enjoyed.

You have a winner of a recipe here!  Terrific cold weather comfort food.  I used up someBob Evans zesty bulk sausage, about 3/4 lb, and used half and half.  Just eyed the amount of spinach.  Deeeeelish and a do over for sure.

Such a flavorful, colorful and satisfying soup!  The only addition I made was to saute chopped celery with the onion.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great soup. I used half and half (instead of cream), regular broth (not low-sodium) and Del Monte's fire-roasted garlic diced tomatoes and it was really good. Unless you absolutely love gnocchi, I would leave out about 1/3 of the package; it was a little too much for me.
