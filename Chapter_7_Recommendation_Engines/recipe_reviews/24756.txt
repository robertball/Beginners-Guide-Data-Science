Excellent taste! This is an all natural butter that is still spreadable! Make sure to soften and not melt the butter. Now that I've got the hang of making it, I'll never use anything else.

I use this same method, only I use light flavored or regular olive oil, depending on your preference.

I cut this back to 12 servings. The reason why I made this is because I wanted a soft spread that I could add minced garlic and chopped parsley to for homemade garlic bread. This was exactly what I was looking for. I did use SALTED butter. I was able to mix this up around noon (with the added spices) and use to spread on garlic bread at dinnertime. It blew my mind. Who knew that homemade soft spread would be this easy to make and without chemicals? I'm really impressed. I'll use this recipe again for sure. NOTE: Twelve servings (1/3 cup of both salted butter and 1/3 cup oil) makes enough to spread on two sides of one large italian bread loaf. I only used half, there's plenty for next time I make garlic bread.

I made this using my KA mixer.  I had doubts that it would come together but I kept beating it and it did.  It's liquidy when done but does set up in the refrigerator.  I made the full recipe with some added salt since my butter was unsalted.  The taste is good and i would make it again.  The recipe yielded around 2 cups.  Thanks Cal for a good recipe that replaces store bought junk. UPDATE:  My initial batch eventually separated.  So I adjusted the second batch.  I defrosted 2 sticks of butter in my 1300w microwave for 39sec.  The butter was very soft and partially melted.  I put the butter in the KA with the whisk attachment and whisked it until it was smooth.  I added a total of 1cup of canola oil with the first half added very slowly.  This time I added 4 pinches of table salt.  UPDATE:  The spread did not separate when i used my updated method. Update:  I whipped it longer this time so the spread is white and I made 2.5 cups instead of 2c.  Will update with results.

This stuff is ace! Plain butter has 35% saturated fat, per tablespoon, or 1/3 a days worth. That is a lot! I have reduced butter usage in everyday cooking for cholesterol reasons. The only 2 options available, at the market that are not margarine, are whipped butter and butter with canola oil. Whipped butter, is just butter with air whipped into it which reduces the sat fat by half by doubling the volume. They are only selling half the amount of butter too!The butter with canola oil at the grocery store is over $3.50 for 15oz. "This recipe tastes and spreads exactly like that butter." Stick butter cost about 65 cents a stick, which makes this more affordable. I just put two sticks of butter in the empty, clean 15oz container for the same products. I microwaved the butter about 25-30 seconds, until softened and not melted, and then followed the directions for adding the canola oil to it. Make sure to use salted butter or add a little salt. Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I've done this twice now and it works! Just do it 1:1 and add a touch extra oil - then you can use it with any amount of butter you might have already softened. It really makes the butter stretch in our family of 7. :)

What a wonderful idea.  Olive oil would be the oil of choice since that is the oil most often used by the Mediterian people who seem to be very heart healthy.

This is a terrific way to lower the fat for spreadable butter without buying the fake stuff in the tub. Like others recommended, I softened 1 cup butter. Beat it till it was light and creamy in my KitchenAid mixer. Then I slowly poured in 1 cup canola oil and beat another 5 minutes occasionally scraping the sides of the bowl. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt for flavor. This makes a great deal of spread and I can see that i will not only save on fat, I will also save on the cost of butter.

I have to agree with other reviewers that I think it is more of a 1:1 ratio. Also I used salted butter as the recipe did not specify, whether I needed salted or unsalted. After I was done blending, I kept tapping the container on the countertop to make sure all the air bubbles escaped as they will show up later while congealing in the fridge. If they don't escape, it seems to make the mixture runnier faster at room temperature. Thanks Cal for sharing this recipe!

I made half a batch. I had trouble getting my butter and oil to come together (it eventually happened). Perhaps, my butter wasn't at room temperature. I added a garlic powder blend from Penzey's and some parsley flakes. Great flavor! Next time, I believe I will keep the butter and oil amounts equal. I feel that it's a little too soupy at the current ratio.

While I do like this in place of the store bought 'Spreadables' I usually buy, I find this recipe has too much canola oil. I had an issue with the oil separating out of the butter too quickly even before reaching room temperature, leaving an oily mess.  I reduced it to a 1 to 1 ratio the next time and it is still soft and spreadable, but eliminates the problem.

This spread has had great reviews, but I wasn't exactly wow'd by it.  I know, there always has to be one, right?  I can see possibly using it for a flavored butter.  But for everyday butter to put on the table, I still prefer the whipped butter sold at the store.  One thing that I really don't like about it is how quickly it starts to separate at room temperature.  Having oil puddle around the corners of the butter dish isn't very appetizing.  I've read the reviews, and this could be a result of too much canola oil, but as I try to do, I followed the recipe exactly as written the first time.  Nutritionally, the two are very close and, yes, whipped butter does take a few minutes to soften (but not long).  And there is very little cost savings making this as compared to buying the store brand of whipped butter.  If it works for you, go for it, but I'll be sticking with the whipped butter.  This will be eaten, and it was worth a try.

Its a great way to save money. Spreadable butter costs more than regular butter, and is just this, butter with vegetable oil blended in.

Don't think it has less fat though, it has MORE. Butter is around 80% fat, and oil is 100% fat, so this recipe lies in-between. Vegetable oils have less SATURATED fat than butter, so you'll be getting less saturated fat from this, as long as you don't use more of it.

Recent studies have shown that eating saturated fat is not really bad for you anyway, so just enjoy this for what it is, an easier way of spreading butter straight from the fridge, that;s cheaper than store bought.

We have been making the soft spread butter now for years and still think it is the best.  We have varied the recipe to using 3 sticks of butter, 1 cup of olive oil and 1 cup of canola oil as our new standard.  We like the properties and the taste.  Just go slow with the oil addition.  It is easier to blend in the summer when the butter is softer after sitting out.

I love the idea, but the ratio of oil seemed way too high.  I used less than a 1:1 ratio and it turned out great.

Love this recipe! So easy and so much cheaper than store bought brand. We use this on everything. Can alter recipe to make it softer or more firm if desired. Haven’t tried flavoring it with herbs or spices yet.

Canola oil is so bad for us.  I'd like to know which of the good, healthy oils could be used in place of it

this stuff is great!!!! so much cheaper then buying soft butter like this at the grocery store. I only gave it 4 stars because it does get some small tiny tiny  oil bubbles in it but they go away once you take it out of the fridge.  I felt like people should know this. but even though it gets the bubbles  I make this all the time!! Thanks for the recipe!!!!
