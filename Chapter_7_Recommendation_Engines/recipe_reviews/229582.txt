In my humble opinion..... I think it would be better if instead of bisquits  yeast rolls were used and way too much sauce for dish.

I halved this recipe and baked it in a loaf pan.  I also cut the biscuits in half and then into 3rds. Layered 2 layers of biscuits sprinkled with blueberries. Baking time was a bit off, baking it 40 minutes and it still was a bit soft in middle.  We didn't make the glaze, plenty sweet like this.  Husband approved!

Made per recipe and added some home made blueberry simple syrup. Very easy and disappeared quick.
