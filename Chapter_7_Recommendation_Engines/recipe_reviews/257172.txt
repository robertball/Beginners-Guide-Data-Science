This recipe brings me back to my childhood.There are different regions in Italy, and even though this one is form the part of Italy where i was born, Northern Italy, we make it a little different.I did make changes, i used beef shanks as veal is very hard to find here.I used gluten free flour and  olive oil in place of butter.I did not use the wine, i used my own tomatoe sauce  and after searing the shanks added them to the sauce. I  found 55 min. cooking time not enough time to get the shanks tender, so i finished it in the oven at 325 for 30 min. more.I served the shanks over  Penne  Pasta.
My mom made it this way and this is how i remember it.
This recipe could use more seasoning such as rosemary, basil and garlic.

i loved this recipe. i did do a few things differently though. i used 3 carrots and a whole onion, chopped as opposed to a tbsp of each. i didn't have any wine,  so i used beef stock. i added 3 cracked cloves of garlic. i also didn't have any fresh parsley so i left out the Gremolata at the end. before serving i removed the shanks and carrots and and pureed what was left in the pot which made for a great gravy. Very good recipe!
