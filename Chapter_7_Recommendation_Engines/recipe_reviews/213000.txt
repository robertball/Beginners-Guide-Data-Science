These are delicious, but to make them even better, try adding a can of coconut milk or cream to the water that you boil them in. This will give the cakes a strong coconut flavor

I liked how simple and inexpensive it was to make these.  Just like the ones I buy from my local Asian grocery store.  I did have to add more flour for a thicker consistency and I did not ball them in my hand.  I used a melon baller, scooped them into boiling water then stretched them after they were cooked, as I did a coating of coconut.  I would also modify and use 1/4 tsp salt rather than 1 tsp.  It was too salty for my taste.  After modifying the recipe they were great though!  Reminds me of the treats mama would buy for me in the fish market when I was growing up :)

I like the taste but using the recipe provided, I ended up with a really gooey palitao so I ended up having to add more rice flour until it was hard enough to form balls with.  I love the taste though.  It's exactly how I remembered it.  Thanks for the recipe!

The measurements are all wrong.  1 cup of glutinous rice flour, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup water results in pancake batter consistency.  
Also scooping it out of the strainger into the sugar/sesame seed mixture results in a sticky gooey mess that clumps up the sugar in the bowl and hardens into lumps of sugar crystal on the balls when cooled.  
Fail all around from ingredients down to the directions.

Don't know what was wrong but I followed the recipe and had to double the flour and then it just did not taste right.  Not sure what I was expecting but did not like it.  Maybe need to go buy one asnd compare

Lola, I don't know how this recipe ended up being the nice dish pictured herein... I followed your directions exactly as written but all I ended up with is a bowl of waste. looks to me like the ingredients were not given in the right proportions.

I tried this. It became a *nilugaw*. I followed the steps and everything I don't know what was wrong.

Easy to do and delicious! I used almond and sugar plus sesame seed. Thank you! I just had the craving for this today and saw I have glutinous powdered rice. Et voila, I had "PALITAW!"
