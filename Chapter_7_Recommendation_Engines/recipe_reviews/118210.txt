I brought this to a party where some pretty finicky eaters don't mind telling you if it's good or bad and it was VERY well received! It's a winner!

It's always been a tradition to eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day...no one has yet to say, how to eat them on New Year's Day...so I ate them this way. And I loved this recipe. I made my batch with an Italian Dressing Mix from right here on Allrecipes and converted the portion I needed from the batch to fit the recipe, about 1 tbsp & 1/8th tsp to match a .7 ounce packet. But followed the recipe to a T, but used a mild salsa due to kids eating it and it was rather easy and quick. It wasn't hot at all for my kids and my 2 pickiest eaters actually enjoyed it. Great way to use up pantry items and still have a solid and yet light dish to treat the family with. I have no complaints for this recipe. We liked it very very much.

This was a huge hit at a backyard BBQ. I used 1 1/2 cups Pace Picante in medium and added a yellow pepper for taste and color. This recipe made a generous amount that my friends ate with chips and alone as a salad. It is so fresh and summery tasting!   Many asked for the recipe. I had a small amount left over and it has kept so well in the refrigerator.  I have served the leftovers with celery stalks, grilled chicken breast and peppered turkey and cheese wraps. This is my choice for a side to bring to get togethers and BBQ from now on!

Easy easy!  I used the 1.5 pound jar of salsa - and added some freshly chopped tomatos, along with some cilantro - plus I juiced half a lime, and used about half of the rendered lime juice.

Heeded previous advice and ended up using about 1/2 a packet of the dry italian dressing mix packet.  Plenty of salt at that point.

Very hearty and great flavor.  Best to by the chips shaped like 'scoops' for this salsa.  I made it for a get-together, and it recieved lots of compliments.  ...one reviewer said it was far too salty, but mine turned out prefect.  Maybe make sure you are using garlic powder, and not garlic salt.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was much too salty.  Perhaps Italian Dressing mixes come in different size packages but I'm pretty sure I used the typical size as directed.  I was very disappointed and we had to dump the entire bowl.  I'm not sure why my experience was so different from the other reviews but it was.

This is a great recipe. Not too many people liked it because of the black eyed peas (more for me!) but it tasted super great. Those that were willing to take a taste loved it. Thanks for a great recipe.

I added organge bell pepper, cilantro, 1/2 squeezed lime and mild salsa. I only used the italian dressing for salt I don't think I even used 1/2 of a packet. Good recipe not spicy at all! ;-) Enjoy!!

This recipe is awesome.  I have made it several times for several occasions and everyone loves it. The only thing I do different is omit the olives.

I cater small events and I made this for a western themed wedding and served with corn chips. Everyone loved it, it was one of the 1st things gone from the buffet & everyone asked for the recipe.

I was a little skeptical about the black eyed peas, but I made this recipe for the first time for a Mardi Gras potluck and it was a huge success! I used a 1 pound jar of chunky mild Pace, used only half a packet of the Italian dressing mix, and left out the green pepper. I actually prefer my salsa a little spicier than the recipe called for so I added an extra jalapeno and had some larger chunks on top as garnish. Because I used fresh jalapenos, none of the texture was lost by not adding the green pepper. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Ive tried many versions of this recipe, this one with dry italian dressing mix and ingredients is the best! Delish!
