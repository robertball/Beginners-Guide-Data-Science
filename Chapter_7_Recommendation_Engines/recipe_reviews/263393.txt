A solid 5 for flavour but I thought that  the cooking instructions were off. Start cooking the pasta before beginning the rest of the recipe. Because of the longer cooking time I used shrimp that were large, size 16/20. I cooked the shrimp for a few minutes then added the garlic until fragrant. I didn't add the salt to the mushrooms until they were cooked, adding salt at the beginning will draw out the water, total cooking time will be 15 minutes. Should I make this again I will add 1 tbs of butter, at the end, to make it silky. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This turned out very well. The sauce was thickened well with the cheese.  I used heavy cream.  I also added asparagus and red bell peppers.  Make your pasta first.

The only two changes were used jarred mushrooms and didn’t use garlic as my husband has an aversion to it.  Fantastic dish, although it quickly became a bit dry once the creamed mixture was added to the pasta.  (Thus 4 stars versus 5:). I did use some of the pasta water, but maybe I should have considered the  butter mentioned in the first review.  I will definitely make again, it’s a hit with our family!

I don't eat pasta so I am always looking for creative ways to feed my husband and son. I didn't have half and half so used evap milk with reg milk it took awhile to thicken. I also started the pasta first so it was ready to mix when the mushrooms were done. I also added more salt and pepper to taste and some dried onion. They both loved it. I will be making it again (but with the half and half) :)

The mozzarella coagulated into a chewy lump.  Start pasta noodles early.

Excellent recipe. I was generous with the paprika and basil. Do you sprinkle on cayenne after it's served? Might try that other reviewer's suggestion for the butter. Definitely will be a favorite. Might also add avocado slices when it's served.
