This is a very good start, but the recipe lacks 'zing' as it is written. I only used 4 potatoes and added one small onion to the dish, and seasoned the flour with salt and pepper. My kids loved it, and we will do this dish again.

This recipe definitely didn't have any wildly exotic flavors, but it was very simple, satisfying and yummy in a comfort food way.  I poured out all the fat from the skillet after cooking the chops and rinsed it, then sprayed on some no-stick spray to keep the potatoes from sticking. I also added about 1/4 cup of chicken broth because I was worried there wasn't enough liquid and the potatoes would burn, and then after the potatoes were done took everything out but the liquid and added a bit of cornstarch because it was really runny.  I also recommend adding dried thyme, salt and pepper.  Frozen green beans would be good too.  This was great with honey corn muffins and a salad!  Yummy!

This is EXCELLENT!!  I did add a little zip to my mine.  I seasoned the chops with salt & red pepper before coating with flour.  Once I removed the chops from the pan I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic.  The soup/water consistancy was good, not too thin.  We will have this again.  I have a Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker so cooking time was only 15 minutes once all ingredients were returned to the pan.

I love this recipe a lot! One thing that I do change is the sauce/gravy. My husband does not like tomato based ANYTHING! So I came up with a solution. The gravy mix I use is 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 3/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of water. It came out excellent!  Thanks for sharing :)

We liked this recipe and would make it again. We added an onion, some chilli powder and a cup of chicken broth. My husband forgot to put the cover on though. So, some of the liquid evaporated out. He likes it runny and it was perfect for his taste. If you don't like it runny but want additional flavor, just add 1/4 - 1/2 cup broth instead. I think the chilli was key for our liking.

This recipe was easy but VERY bland.  It didn't taste all that great till I put a bit of Tobasco on it.  I think I will have to tweak it more next time.

This was easy to make, which was really nice.  I may make again, but will definitely add some more seasonings next time.

I thought is was very good.  My husband enjoyed it too.  I will certainly make it again.  I used frozen greens instead of canned.  I did cook them before adding to potatoes.  I think that next time I will only use 4 pork chops. I used 5 and my skillet was just about to overflow.  I will also pass on to some of my children to try.

Needs a bit more flavor, maybe try seasoning the flour.  Overall, very good.

Yummy satisfying easy dinner. I advise seasoning your chops (salt, pepper, garlic powder) and layering the potatoes with a little s&p as well when putting them in the pan - otherwise it will be a little bland. I did mess with the quantities of things to suit my pan / family. I used only 2 large pork chops, 3 large potatoes and the full can of soup and green beans. I also used a full can of water (and the sauce was just the right consistency).
