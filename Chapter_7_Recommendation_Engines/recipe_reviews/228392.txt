I've been making a shrimp cocktail almost identical to this for years after ordering one in the Mexican border town of Algodones and loving it.  Like one other reviewer suggested, I also use Clamato juice or a V8/Clamato mix and I also add celery and garnish with cilantro.  I usually make a big batch so it lasts in the fridge for a couple of days.  For that reason I don't add the shrimp and avocado until I serve individually.

This is spot on to what we have in Algodones Mexico. Absolutely perfect. Thanks for sharing. I've tried many times to duplicate it but ... this one takes the cake.

I make this once in awhile because I clean my own shrimp, it's time consuming. Tried this recipe, it's ok but here's what I modified on the 2nd batch...3-4lbs of shrimp peel & cook (set some of the water aside), 1 1/2 pounds of crab meat, 1 whole cilantro, 1 whole onion, 2 celery sticks, 2 lg cucumbers, 3 serranos/jalape√±os, 5-6 avocados depending on size and a few slices for garnish and 1 lg bottle of spicy Clamato juice if not enough juice or want more shrimp flavor add shrimp water as needed and mix everything. I don't use salt, it can be added individually as well as the lemon/lime juice.

Very good and refreshing. It needs celery, and I added 1/2 cup clam juice.
