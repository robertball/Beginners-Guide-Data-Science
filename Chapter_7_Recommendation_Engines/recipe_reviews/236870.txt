I halved this recipe to take to a work meeting today and decided to make it the day before then just heat up in the microwave at work before serving.  I didn't let it sit overnight or for 8 hours and it seemed fine.  It's a bit time intensive and uses a lot of dishes but my coworkers loved it--several went back for seconds.  I didn't have stuffing mix but just cubed half a loaf of bread, tossed in some seasoning, and called it good.  Worked well, and it is relatively easy for all the steps.  I thought it was pretty good.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm the sister of who posted the recipe.   We've made"Christmas Casserole" since we were kids.  Because it's a tiny bit time consuming to make,  we only make it for Christmas, hence the original  name.  Over the years,  I've tweaked the recipe a tiny bit for my household.   I also add a small can of mushrooms, a tablespoon of minced garlic to the bacon/egg  mixture.    You can use bread crumbs instead of Stuffing mix for the topping,  but the flavor is compromised a bit, in my opinion.   I make this up to a month in advance & freeze it until Christmas morning.   I start baking it when the family is up & it's typically cooked & heated throughout & ready to eat by the time gifts are done being unwrapped.   Hope you enjoy our families Christmas Casserole!

This is very good as written and a little different version than many of the other breakfast overnight casserole dishes because of the addition of the stuffing mix.  A nice change.

Wife loved it!! I enjoyed it greatly. I am excited to try the ham and sausage sometime. I just cooked it after I finished all the preparation. I bet the waiting several hours would make this even better!! Great recipe!! Have Fun!!
