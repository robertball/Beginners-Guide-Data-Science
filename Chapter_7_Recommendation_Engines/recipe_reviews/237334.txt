Made the meatballs exactly as written, they were done at 15 minutes, so watch your time.  There’s nothing at all “spicy” in the meatballs, so if you want that “spicy Buffalo” flavor, I’d recommend you mix up the sauce, and taste before you add the honey.  Also, you really want the meatballs well coated with the sauce, so I’d suggest you double it or even triple (next time I’ll triple) because the warm meatballs quickly soaked up the sauce.  I mixed the hot sauce and butter together, omitted the honey (personal taste preference), tasted, and  since we wanted it a little spicier, I added a sprinkle of both cayenne and garlic powder.  Basically, you’ll just have to adjust the sauce to your taste.  This was a nice change from Buffalo-style chicken wings, and not nearly as messy to eat!

Used ground turkey instead of ground beef (personal preference).  Left the meatballs "dry" so that we could freeze the left overs and sauce them according to preference.  This time I went with buffalo style Tabasco sauce for the mild heat.  Not too bad.
