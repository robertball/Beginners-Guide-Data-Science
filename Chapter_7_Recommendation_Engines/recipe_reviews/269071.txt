Just the right amount of spice.  Easy to make and quick. I used Bob's red Mill quinoa which does not need to be rinsed. One cup of quinoa was enough for my family, but I doubled the sauce. Delicious

This was simple and easy and very tasty. I used ancho chille powder as as substitute and it worked perfectly.  I'll make this again for sure.

This was a great tasting vegetarian dish.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used lemon juice in place of the vinegar.  I also felt like this recipe lends itself to additions of other veggies or greens.  I am going to try adding sauted kale next time.  I will definitely make this again. :)

Love it and will make again. The hummus and yogurt portion is a little skimpy, I doubled it. I never follow any recipe exactly, I had a few orange peppers that were looking like old men so I charred them in the oven, peeled and purred.
