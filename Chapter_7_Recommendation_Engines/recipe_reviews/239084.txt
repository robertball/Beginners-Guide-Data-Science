BEST gravy I have ever had. All my family loved it. I added celery and carrot to the giblets and onion. I also cut up the neck and added to giblets. Instead of 6 cups of water I used 4 cups of turkey stock and 2 cups of water.   Will use again.

This gravy came out perfect. I didn't have enough time to cook the giblets for an hour and a half, so I used a pressure cooker instead. Same with letting the turkey drippings cool and spooning off the fat, so I used a stick of butter instead. But still, it tasted great and the texture was just right.

Iâ€™ve used this recipe multiple times now and it turned out great. Everyone loved my gravy. I did not add chopped up giblets or neck meat to the gravy itself, but everything else was the same.

great recipe! It was my first time making gravy and everyone loved it! I actually reserved half of the amount for the giblets and half for smooth gravy and both were a hit.

Yummy!  My wife was a little taken aback at having giblets, so making the broth out of them and the onion and straining out the giblets was just up her alley.  A little salt and pepper to taste and it was delicious.  Super thick too!

Wonderful, robust gravy and easy to make though it takes a while to get to the end. This recipe makes ALOT of gravy (like 5 cups) so I will half it next time for just an average family serving. I forgot to do step 3 (scrape the roasting pan) but it still came out delicious. I will be adding this to our holiday recipe box. Thank you!

My family do not want to know that the giblets are used!  Usually, I use a grave separator (which is hard to find) and take off as much fat as possible before I make the gravy.  Otherwise, I know it is flavorful.  Making gravy is an art!

I made this exactly as written.  This is the first time I've attempted giblet gravy.  I felt it was missing something.  My Mom always adds a pack of turkey gravy mix to her giblet gravy, and it adds a lot of flavor.  I will do this next time.
