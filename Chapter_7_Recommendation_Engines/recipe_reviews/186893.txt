Since kale is so bitter I added a bit more maple syrup than the recipe called for as well as toasted walnuts and dried cranberries.  It was fabulous!!!!

I use less onion, season to taste and add toasted rough chopped almonds.  We enjoy this as a side dish as well as a main dish by adding smoked salmon and Pecorino Romano.  Easy and healthy.  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic! I made a big bowl thinking it would last us for a few meals but no, we ate it all in one supper! The kale I used had purple spines, not sure what variety that is, and it was so pretty. I also cut down on prep time by using bagged carrot slaw and I threw some chicken in to make it a complete meal. I only marinated it for about four hours and it was perfect. I am going to be making this for two family reunions this summer and can't wait to hear the rave reviews!

This was a fantastic dish, but only with some modifications to the recipe to make it that way; hence, I deducted stars.  I used all quantities and ingredients indicated and followed the recipe steps exactly, except that I used equal amounts of oil and vinegar, as other reviewers suggested.  If I had not followed this suggestion, the dish would have been overwhelmingly oily.  

After letting the slaw marinate, I tasted it for salt and pepper (I had added the pinch of each, as suggested in the recipe, when I mixed it earlier).  I found that I needed to add 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the slaw to make it edible; otherwise, it would have been completely bland.

With the modifications listed above, this dish was the hit of my family's Christmas gathering.  We ate it for two more days, and it remained crunchy and delicious.  It was the perfect dish to balance out the heavier foods of a Christmas dinner, and I'll be making it again in the future.

I love this slaw with kale from my local farmers market.  I usually substitute brocoli slaw instead of the cabbage and carrots.  I use organic sugar instead of maple syrup.  Also have used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.  Great healthy salad for the winter!

In the midwest they make vegatables larger!  I only used 1/2 of a cabbage and 1/2 of a "bunch" of kale.  This recipe does not need the full 2/3 cup oil, about 1/2 cup should do nicely.  Otherwise, very good.

Tastes good, Smells good, very pretty! Very fresh! I added juice from a whole lime, used a 1/4 of an onion, and a generous amount of maple syrup. I also added some toasted seseamee seeds.

This was just average for us. It sounded so interesting, but nothing about it made me say Wow. It needs something to vary the texture--some pine nuts or walnuts would be nice, and maybe some sun-dried tomatoes. Otherwise, it was a bit boring. Thanks, anyway.

Excellent way to use Kale! I did reduce the amount of olive oil because my husband and I are watching our calories lately. Simply delicious, thank you.

Very good base recipe, but needed a little something. I added a shredded granny smith apple and an extra tablespoon of lime juice. Very good, but I think it can still be improved. Next time, I will add another granny smith apple and/or golden raisins, plus almonds for crunch.

Wonderful, light and refreshing!  I cut the oil in half, but otherwise made the recipe as written.  I thought the kale would be bitter and tough, but something about the time marinating in the dressing made the end result tender & light tasting.  I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was good, but like other reviewers noted, there is way too much oil in the dressing recipe.  I used half the amount of oil and doubled the amount of maple syrup and I think it turned out much better.  Blue cheese, walnuts, and cranberries are a great addition to this salad.

This was very good.  I added toasted walnuts, craisins, and feta.  I thought it was bland without the feta and divine with it.

I made a variation of this for Easter Brunch and my family loved it.  I used kale, red cabbage, green beans, carrots, and broccoli stem.  I also added garlic, black sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds.  Also only marinated for about an hour.  Thank you for the great base recipe that can be tweaked to your own specifications.

Very, very good.  Nice to have something this fresh tasting using cabbage.  The kale really makes this something special - not just coleslaw.  That fact that it keeps well for several days is great too.  Like some others I cut the oil in half.  And was out of real maple syrup so I just used corn syrup instead (high fructose! bad!).  The flavour woud be only slightly changed by the omission of the maple syrup, I think.  One tsp in all that balsamic vinegar would be hard to taste.  But I will use it another time.  I also added feta and roasted almonds and pecans as we served it.  Yummy.  Even better the next day for lunch with chicken breast cut up in it.  Thanks for posting this.

only had kale and added slivered red pepper. Did not have limes, used white balsamic. Used some brown sugar becuase I was skeptical of the syrup. But I did add the syrup at the last minute as well. This was a really yummy salad. Even my husband loved it and he does not usually eat kale!

Really great recipe, have made it several times with all the kale we get in our CSA.  I never thought I would enjoy raw kale so much!  I usually halve the recipe using kale OR cabbage and use equal amounts of oil and vinegar.  It's also fun swapping in new ingredients to try.  The flavors are just fantastic.  I've found that massaging the dressing by hand into the salad is important in spreading the flavor around.  I've never had time to marinate it -- I bet it would be even better if I did!

I loved the very basics of this recipe. 
However, I didn't have cabbage, so I substituted broccoli heads, and only had sweet onion.
I added pistachios, suggested in another kale slaw recipe. I also added sunflower seeds and raisins.
I did use the same dressing ingredients, but used less olive oil and used pear infused white balsamic. 
I know this is a very modified version, but I think you can be very creative with this recipe, using the very tasty dressing.
Thanks! YUM!

this is a great salad!  I did change it up a little.   First of all, I have learned that you MUST massage kale to make it palatable. Then, I used equal amounts (about 2 c each) of kale and red cabbage and just added a carrot for color and sweetness.  For the dressing, I used only 2 T balsamic vinegar, but 2 T of the maple syrup.  Olive oil was too much, I used about 1/3 cup.  I used the other dressing ingredients as the recipe says.   Adjusting to your liking is key - but I love the idea and made it my own.  You can do the same.  When I serve this, it always goes.  Sometimes people will pick at it after dinner.  It also stays crunchy which is a plus.

This is the best slaw I've ever made. I didn't have the balsamic vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead. I also used a whole head of green cabbage instead of half red. It looked beautiful with the bright orange carrots, purple onions and green kale. The maple syrup makes the recipe. Thanks!

Loved this salad! It will be my new go-to summer salad! I added raw pine nuts for even more crunch and protein. Next time, I might try topping with feta. 
Btw, it was even delicious as leftovers the next day! A keeper recipe!

Kale is all the rage and this recipe is a keeper!  I halved the olive oil, substituted a tablespoon of brown sugar for the maple syrup and kept adding salt to taste.  I used the lacinato kale along with a bunch of the lighter green kale, chopped them, salted them and massaged those puppies til they were limp with happiness.  I only used 1/2 the dressing before I put it in the fridge to chill.  Then added some of the leftover dressing to taste before serving.   Two thumbs up from my guests.  Will be making this again tomorrow! By the way, this portion fed 3 people as a side dish.

The authors direction (in the description) to massage the kale should be added to the instructions. That being said, this was good. I halved this and ended up with about a 2qt casserole dish full. I ended up using about 6-8 leaves of kale and 1/8 head each of red and green cabbage(heads were closer in size to a softball than a cantaloupe). I did not need all of the dressing and lessened to oil to about 1:1 with the vinegar. We liked it even better with some added sunflower seeds.

Sister Slaw Haiku: "This was just awesome! A fresh change from creamy slaw. Leftovers good too." B4 going into my rave of this recipe, I need to recommend that one not prepare the dressing the night b4, thinking that he or she can pour and toss the following day when closer to serving time - the dressing separated into that yellow, gloppy, funk which I can only assume is some reaction b/t the olive oil and the lime juice. So thinking that I was saving time, I ended up wasting those ingredients and starting over the day of the BBQ where I served this (for baby's 1st b'day.) Wish I could recall who on the Buzz suggested this recipe b/c I owe them! This was SO good and I loved the leftovers scooped over romaine lettuce w/ chunks of tomato as a salad. As another time-saver (but successful, as opposed to my making the dressing early lol), I used a bag of coleslaw mix rather than chopping all the cabbage. All of the party guests loved it too; great recipe!!

This is a beautiful salad.  I used the specified vegetables, but I only added about 2 tablespoons of minced onion, as I am not a fan of the lingering raw onion taste.  When I made this, it was the second time in a week that I failed to READ THE RECIPE ALL THE WAY THROUGH before making.  When I had shredded all the veggies, I happened to see that the author recommended to "Chill in the refrigerator for two hours before serving."  Oops, too late to do that!  This had a good flavor.  I added some raw sunflower seeds for extra crunch, and I enjoyed the addition.  Thanks for submitting such a healthy and colorful dish!

This was really good, I'll be making this often! I added toasted walnuts and cranraisins as suggested. I think I will put a little feta on it next time.

I used 1/2 lemon balsamic and 1/2 reg balsamic and juice of a whole lime in dressing.  I also used scallions instead of red onion. Absolutely one of my new favorite recipes!! So healthy ,fresh and versatile...  Thank you

I used kale, apples and green onions because I had it all on hand and we loved this! I also added some poppyseeds to the dressing to give some bite. This turned out great!

I wish I would have read the nutrition information and the reviews before I made this.  The flavor is delightful and refreshing (the kale is well balanced with the onion, lime, and the vinegar) but I would have liked to have it be less fat.  Next time I will definitely decrease the oil since the salad has quite a bit of dressing at the bottom of the bowl.  I think even my teenagers will be pleased with this as a veggie.

Loved it! I used 2 shredded red beets instead of the cabbage and added in some pumpkin spice candied sunflower seeds (cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves, cayenne pepper, black pepper and honey, and then roasted in the oven. Cool before adding to slaw). Also, I left out the salt. Rave reviews by all!

This is one of our favourite side dishes in the winter, as the ingredients are easy to find at the market (or my garden) well past growing season. We probably eat it weekly or bi-weekly. If I'm feeling fancy I add feta, dried cranberries and almonds, but the base is delicious on it's own too. Thanks!

Really loved this! As others suggested, I reduced the oil, added craisins and sliced almonds. I wish the amounts were more specific. I purchased the kale in a bag, so I just guessed.

Yummy.  The contrast in flavors between the lemon juice, sweet flavor, and the vegetables makes an incredible dish.
