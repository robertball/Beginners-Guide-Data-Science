WOW!  My husband and I loved  this...perfect ratio. We didn't change a thing, just chilled the glasses really well.  Don't skip the bitters or the cherries, it adds to the great flavour.

That Shaggy sure knows his drinks! This cocktail is a little sweet from the vermouth, but it packs a punch with all that liquor! The cherry makes a nice presentation, but I usually leave it out.

You are right about using high-quality ingredients - Maker's Mark for bourbon and Martini vermouth (dry for me). I pour the ingredients right in the glass, which I have had chilling in the freezer all day! Got a Waterford martini glass on eBay ... ah, such a delight! It will spoil you for trying to drink a Manhattan made by anyone but your "ownself".

I use bitters also, a classic manhattan made in bars. What I like is Jim Beam instead of regular bourbon, with a little cherry juice. I have also found if you like cherries with your bourbon, try Jim Beam Stag. It is so good just on the rocks. My mother in-law loves it on vanilla ice cream.

This is the same recipe we use, though I sometimes add about 1/2 tbsp of juice from the jar of cherries.

This has been my top listed American cocktail for decades.  My choice of ingredients are Jim Beam Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey, Martini & Rossi Rosso Vermouth, Angostura Aromatic Bitters, and a large, stemmed Maraschino cherry.

My method of choice to build this mythical drink is to stir the contents in a metal shaker for a full minute.  A glass shaker is acceptable, but for some reason it just doesn’t get the drink cold enough.

Stirring produces a crystal clear and icy cold drink.  Pour gently into the glass so as to avoid producing bubbles.  A well-chilled stemmed glass is essential to keep it cold.

Shaking taints this classy drink, it destroys its magic, its romance associated to days when elegant cars and elegantly dressed men and women occupied swank surroundings.  In spite of the Great Depression, there has never been a more classy period in the 20th century than the 1930‘s.

Follow the recipe exactly and you have a concoction that, on your death bed, will be your final request for remembrance of a life well lived.

I like mine stiffer shake 5-10 seconds.  Also chill martini glass with ice and water before serving.  Makers Mark is my favorite whiskey for Manhattens

I cut the vermouth to 1 to 4 ratio for my taste, but the bitters is a new one on me in a Manhattan. Great! It is now part of my repertoir.

Most bar Manhattans are much drier than this, which is a shame because the drink will taste and have a "nose" more like raw alcohol than any depth of flavor.  There's a big difference in bourbons.  For best flavor, use a straight aged bourbon, not a blend, which can be up to 70 percent grain neutral spirits.  To get this drink in a bar, order a "sweet Manhattan" with a straight bourbon. And yes, a dash or two of bitters is essential!

This is my all time favorite winter cocktail.....I prefer it on the rocks rather than straight up and also use bitters and a little cherry juice. I've been known to add 3 cherries....these bourbon infused delights are the perfect end to a fabulous drink. Cheers!!

A Manhattan calls for Rye Whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Angostora bitters. finish with a cherry or a lemon twist. somewhere between 2-1 & 3-1 rye to vermouth ratio. Also if you can find it use Antica Vermouth, it makes a huge difference.

Yum!  I copied the ingredients that the Snake River Grill in Jackson, Wyoming used---Woodford Reserve and Carpano Antica==the best Manhattan we'd had before.  And lo and behold---success!  If you like your Manhattans strong, then this is exactly what you'd love.

The vermouth is really important, too. I used Tribuno Vermouth the first bunch of Manhattans and they were pretty good, but not great. Then I bought Martini Rosso Vermouth and they were great. Cinzano is really good too. 
Refrigerating vermouth seems to make them retain their flavor profile better. I have friends that swear by Imbue, but I can't say that it is any better than Martini.
