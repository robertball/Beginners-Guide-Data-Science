This was fabulous! I used purple onion instead of yellow and placed the sugar, vinegar, and olive oil in the blender before pouring them over the tomatoes. Even my kids liked this. For the adults I added some crumbled blue cheese and black olives on top. Everyone was very impressed! Thanks Chrissy!

This salad was GREAT!  That is, once I made some modifications.  One is (from the advice from one of the reviewers), I used a purple onion instead of yellow.  I also added thin cucumber slices and red and green bell pepppers and used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  I found the juice to be flat - I wanted more dimension than just sour and flat - so I tossed in some Mrs. Dash table blend and a dash of galic salt and then microwaved the mixture so that the sugar would melt and the tastes would blend.  From the spoon it tasted like oil, but dip a cucumber slice and...  WOW!

This salad was really easy to make and very delicious. A great addition to any summer meal. I made it with store bought tomatoes, I can only imagine how great it would taste with tomatoes from ones own garden.

One word to describe this recipe, delicious! This recipe was so easy to prepare. I made a small modification to the recipe since I'm watching my fat intake. I just simply eliminated the oil and it was still fanstastic.

This recipe was so simple and so tasty!  I have a small tomato garden and wanted to try something different (yet easy!) with the extra tomatoes I had, and this was perfect.  I used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and it turned out delicious.  Everyone loved it and raved about it.  It has become a quick, easy, delicious and always popular dish to take to picnics and gatherings.  Great recipe!

Wow! This is an awesome and easy recipe. My company loved it. It was two helpings each at my dinner table. I also used yellow, red and green peppers to add color. Thanks Chrissy for a tasty treat. Deborah

This recipe is great, and wonderful for picnics.  I use olive oil, and even add green peppers, celery, or even celery seeds once in a while.  Just a nice addition to any meal.

A co-worker brought this dish in for a pot-luck luncheon... let me tell you, she was swamped with people begging for the recipe! She made sure to refer them to this recipe - and this fantastic website! I also made this salad to bring to a dinner at a neighbor's, and I was swamped with requests! I came prepared with printed copies of this recipe! Everyone raved about it! I also can hardly wait until tomatoes are in season! Wish I knew at the beginning of this summer! Thanks!

This is our new favorite! Hubby, kids and even mom-in-law went crazy over it... not to mention HOW EASY IT IS TO PUT TOGETHER! We enjoyed it not only at room temp - but the next day was scrumptous! Can't say enough!

The tomatoes of summer are best used for this recipe.  After making this numerous times, I have finally tweeked it just the way I like it.  Yellow onions tend to be very strong, so I recommend using a sweet onion instead.  Split the vinegar into 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 cup white distilled and cut the oil to 1/4 cup. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Delicious!! I added sliced cucumbers and used course ground black pepper in place of regular pepper just for presentation. I didn't thinly slice the tomatoes as the recipe called for but instead I cored the tomatoes then sliced them and used my cooking shears to cut the tomatoes into chunky pieces. This is a great sidedish to serve at mealtime if you can keep it around long enough!!

I have tried several tomato salads on this site and this one is the best yet.  It has the right ratio of oil, vinegar and sugar.  I used the full amount of tomatoes but did halve the dressing and it was more than enough to cover the roma tomatoes.  I used vidalia onion and added chopped cucumber.

Good recipe for speed - I bought, prepared, and delivered it to a barbecue within an hour!  It's not terribly fancy, what you see is what you get, but I was pleasantly surprised to receive many positive comments and inquiries.

With my tomatoes coming on all at once I needed a quick recipe to use them in, this Sweet-n-Sour Salad is excellent.  We've had it at least 3 times a week.  It's easy to make and no chill time.  There are no leftovers either.  If you are a Weight Watcher member, this recipe as is, is 7 points.

This was quite good. I used olive oil (about half of what is called for) and apple cider vinegar. I also added cucumbers.  A very good and light vegetable salad.

I have made this 3 times with rave reviews.  I have always replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and added thinly sliced English cucumbers to the mix.  Last time, I also added some sliced black olives.  You can really adjust the ingredients to suit your own taste and what you may have on hand.  Tomatoes are not exactly in season here on the northern plains, and I found that romas offer the best texture, color and flavor right now.  I can't wait to make this with flavorful garden tomatoes.  I do recommend following the recipe suggestion to serve at room temp.

This is our new favorite. We tried it for the first time last Wednesday and have had it 4 times since. I also did the 1/4 cup balsamic and 1/4 cup white vinegar and the cucumbers and the olive oil. Last night I also added yellow bell peppers and used half red tomatoes and half yellow tomatoes. Makes it very very pretty. One more thought, last night I doubled the sauce and marinated chicken breasts in it for about an hour. It was really good.

I'm embarrassed to say the two of us ate the whole salad in one sitting!  Since I used a slotted spoon to serve it, there was a lot of marinade left over... so I sliced more fresh tomatoes and onion into the bowl and put it in the fridge for tomorrow!

A very nice salad. We added some oregano and basil for a little extra zip and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

Really good starting base. Made this and hubby and I agreed 'something' was missing. This is a good base for a wonderful anti-pasta type salad. Will make it again and add some olives and cheese chunks. Also, used Splenda because hubby is diabetic. Good recipe, thank you Chrissy!

This recipe was great. We had LOTS of extra fresh tomatoes from the garden and I wanted a new way to fix them. I used olive oil instead of vegetable and added 3-4 generous shakes of Mrs. Dash's Tomato Basil and Garlic seasoning blend. I will definitely make this one again.

I am not one to RAVE about a recipe- but this one is SO delicious and now a staple of 90% of our meals! Especially this time of year when our garden overflows with tomatoes! I only hope that I can find tomatoes throughout the winter so that it may be enjoyed all year long! SUPER!

I'm rating this 4 stars even though mine was not. I did something I hardly ever do: I didn't follow it to the letter the first time I made it.  Instead of using vegetable oil, I thought olive oil would be better.  NOPE!  My oil is highly-flavored and it overcame the taste of the tomatoes.  I WILL make this again and I won't change a thing!

I made this today and it was delicious.  Although I only used half the oil (I tasted the dressing after mixing it and it tasted too oily to me so I doubled the vinegar and sugar.  The ingredients reminded me of German Potato salad which I absolutely love so I added a pinch of celery seed and 2 slices of bacon which I cooked til crisp, drained and crumbled.  I'm not sure how much the celery seed changed the taste of the recipe but I think the bacon made the recipe that much better.

This recipe is wonderful.  I used red and yellow tomatoes from our garden and added red peppers too.  I used olive oil in lieu of veggie oil and used a quarter cup rather then a half.  I think next time I will add jalepeno peppers to the mix!

We really enjoyed this, with a slight modification to ingredients, and big modification to prep.  First, I mixed the vinegar and sugar in a container a couple of days ahead.  We've used just that for a simple leaf-lettuce dressing for as long as I can remember, and I knew it would take some time to dissolve the sugar into the vinegar, and this mix keeps forever.  Then, based on the number of tomatoes I had (I used grape, cut in half), I put some of the vinegar/sugar in a bowl, whisked in a little bit of olive oil, salted and peppered and put the onions in, about 2 hours before we ate.  Just before sitting down, I whisked the dressing up again, and stirred in the tomatoes.  Mmmm!

YUM! YUM!  This is better than dessert to me.  I also added a cucumber and enjoy it with lunch or supper.  A great way to use tomatoes that are getting too ripe to keep. Thank you Chrissy.

This was fantastic! I was having friends over for a vegan dinner, and this made the affair a huge success! Naturally, you add ingredients to your liking - but it is a great base - and it couldn't have been any easier - now everyone wants to know what the "secret ingredients" are! Now I can't wait for summer, so that i can grow my own tomato garden!

I love to make this salad in the summer with fresh tomatoes, but I do not use sugar or oil due to family health issues.  Country Tomatoes is what I learned the recipe to be and the tomatoes and onions were used in addition to green bell peppers cut into slices.  The mix was made with equal portions of Apple Cider Vinegar, Sugar (or Splenda  in my case), salt, pepper, and fresh basil and oregano to taste.  It is such a light and refreshing addition to a seafood, beef or grilled chicken meal.

I've now made this five times.  I stuck to the original recipe the first time but every time thereafter I added some chunks of creamy blue cheese and some sliced black olives.  It's good as written but something special with the additions.  Now a family favorite, this salad will be made weekly all summer long.

Loved the ease of this recipe.  But I used 1/2 balsomic vinegar and 1/2 white vinegar to equal the 1/2 cup that was called for.  Also had to add a few dashes of my favorite seasoning to kick it up a bit.

Following suggestions from the others, I used olive oil and added thinly sliced cucumbers.  I also halved the onion to cut down on the onion-breath!  I agree with those who said it made too much dressing - I'll definitely cut that at least in half next time.  Tasty and simple and uses ingredients I almost always have on hand - thanks!

If there were 10 stars I'd rate it as such.  This is absolutely without a doubt, one of the best recipes I have EVER tried!  I make this now in the spring, summer, fall and winter.  It'll perk up any meal and its wonderful just by itself.  I had to start buying double the ingredients; its like potato chips, there is no way you can eat just one and in this case, no way you can eat just a little!

Nice change of pace instead of green salads.  Very good, but messy.  I used extra virgin olive oil in place of the veg. oil.  I also used red wine vinegar in place of the white.  For a little extra added spice I threw in some celery seed.

I'm so glad I am rating this the day AFTER i made them. they really taste BETTER when the flavors sit overnight! I made it 100% as written, it was PERFECT! i enjoy the simple dressing, very nice flavor. Others complain it is too much dressing, just make the dressing seperate and use as much or as little as you need! I decided to add some cuke today, make sure you weep them before you add, or it will have too much water. Also tried with some herbed goat cheese, VERY VERY delish! The only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it didnt' taste that good last night, it was like soup tho - next day is WAY better. i will make this again for sure when summer tomatos are in abundance. thank you for the recipe chrissy!

My family really liked this recipe.   I changed two things:  I decreased both sugar and oil by a third.  Next time I will add green peppers and cucumbers if I have them.  I don't think it will change the taste and it will provide a way to use up some of those excess veggies.

So good! I couldn't stop snacking on it. I had almost ate 1/2 of it before the rest of dinner was done. I had done as others did, used olive oil. I also put a splash of balsamic.

Excellent! I use Splenda instead of sugar and a bit less oil than called for to cut the calories. What a perfect summer salad. Hubby loves!

I love tomatoes and I love onions soi this recipe sparked my interest. I was surprised at how lightly sweet the recipe was. No single flavor overwhelmed the other.  I make this on a regular basis now and the only thing I have changed is that I halved the the vinegar, sugar and oil. This has enough juice to coat the tomatoes and onion so we get all the flavor without added calories/fat.  My husband, who does not like tomatoes standing out in a recipe, really enjoyed this recipe.   My 16 year old, on the other hand loves tomatoes (like her mother) but HATES onions, unless their chopped tiny and cooked into the food. She may not have loved this recipe as much as I or her dad but she liked it and that is a huge ordeal for me. I was shocked.

This was pretty good. Way too much sauce and next time I think I'll cut back on the sugar. It was a little too sweet. But It was very simple and tasty.
Thanks for the recipe!!!

This is really refreshing and good; not too sweet!  Distilled white vinegar is certainly appropriate for this salad, despite the post to the contrary, however I used white wine vinegar and will experiment with other vinegars, too.  I used half vegetable oil and half olive oil, and I used half halved grape tomatoes and "Snow White" cherry tomatoes.  Not being an onion fan, peeled, seeded and chopped cucumber was substituted.  A very pretty presentation and sooo delicious.

I make these kinds of salads just to leave in the fridge for an "anytime snack."  It's pretty good and the vinegar keeps the vegetables fresh tasting for a couple of days.

I have used a variation of this recipe. I use equal amounts of sugar and apple cider vinegar and add fresh herbs to season. I use this marianate for any combination of (fresh from the garden or farmers market) of tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and bell peppers of all colors. It is a salad we enjoy all summer!

I also added cucumbers and used vidalia onion. I did like the balsamic vinegar as opposed to the white vinegar. I served this salad to 65 people and everyone loved it.

This was a hard review to write.  It's not a bad salad.  But it's just very basic, nothing amazing about it.  It's a good recipe, so if you need a simple side, it works.  As my boyfriend said "If you like tomatoes and onions, this is your salad."  But I would DEFINITELY use extra virgin OO next time.

I'm not sure why I had such a different view than everyone else, but I thought the salad was okay at best.  Sorry.  Maybe it is because I used store tomatoes rather than home grown, but the salad over all was just very bland to me.  There was definately far too much dressing.  The only substitution I made was a purple onion instead of a yellow and I used a little bit less oil, about 1/3 cup and it was olive oil instead of vegetable oil.

This is an excellent dish.  With a surplus of summer tomatoes I was happy to come across this recipe. My family prefers it served cold. I make it with and without cucumbers.  Fresh!

This was one of those things where you just can't stop eating it.  I brought it to a BBQ and everyone loved it.  I also added some sliced yellow peppers, cucumbers, and zucchini from my garden.  In fact, it was so good that I had to make it 2 days later for my husband.  Great way to spice up those summer veggies!

The reason I decided to try out this recipe was because of the easiness. Well it was! and the best part was the taste. Because of personal taste, I prefer this recipe as is - I don't care for "Italian" tasting salads - so this was a perfect change!

Who would have thought that something THIS SIMPLE could be so tasty? I was skeptical about the ingredients in this recipe... but after trying it out (I was so TIRED of making sauce from all my many tomatoes!) I found a new taste sensation!!! Even my family loves it - that makes this one EXTRA special! "A KEEPER!"

Made the recipe as written with some of our fresh heirloom tomatoes and one of the side choices for a cookout.  I usually make tomato salad with a lot of garlic and this was a nice change.  Everyone raved about them.

This was fabulous! Next time I will leave out the onion (personal preference, I only like it cooked) and reduce the amount of oil. I used Splenda instead of sugar.

Delicious, simple flavours! I made some modifications as I wanted this to be a lower calorie/fat dressing:
1/2 c vinegar
5tsp sugar plus 2 packages of Stevia
3tbsp olive oil

Turned out fantastic despite the changes! thanks for sharing :)

I really like this recipe and have made it several times. It's a great bbq sidedish. As for reviewers' complaints about the sweetness - yes, it's sweet, so what? It's not like the title and the ingredients didn't give you a huge heads up.

I thought this salad was great and so easy to make!  I agree with the others that it makes way too much dressing.  I had to dump some out.  I also added cucumbers and used 1/2 balsamic vinegar and 1/2 white vinegar.  My other suggestion is that you mix the dressing in right before serving it.  I made the mistake of making it a few hours before serving it and it wasn't nearly as good as it was right after I made it.  I will be making this again though for sure!

Fast, easy & very tasty.  Not the most excitingly different recipe, but it deserves 5 stars for how good it is with ease and minimal ingredients.  Like others have said, change it to suit your tastes. I used cider vinegar & it was great even tho' it had very little time to sit & let flavors mingle. Definitely a keeper and A+ recipe.

This recipe couldn't be any easier.  It's delicious and awesome with summer tomatoes.  Just for fun I added some fresh sliced seedless cucumber, SO GOOD!  Even better the next day after it marinates!

Give me a break! This recipe is way overrated by the #5 reviewers. I give it a 3 at best. My family didn't scarf it down and I had plenty of leftovers. I added black olives(which helped a little) and cut the sugar by 1/2 or I'd have to drop the rating to 2 for a sugary assault on my taste buds.

I liked the flavors of this dish a lot, but I thought it seemed like there was a bit too much of the dressing.  I used large grape tomatoes and those were really good.

Served in a pretty glass bowl, this dish was the star of the table!!  As suggested, I used red onion, cucumber, and a reduced amount of extra virgin olive oil.  Bright, sweet, and refreshing-- I would recommend this any day of the week!

So fresh tasting and refreshing.  I used half of a large red onion and did add some cucumber as others suggested.  With some other herbs, this could pass for a gaspacho salad.  Will make this often this summer when tomatoes are more available.

easy and so good! i used a red onion and added thinly sliced cucumbers (suggested by others) and served it cold. i know the recipe says 30 min. prep time, but it took me less than 10 minutes to prepare, so that's a big bonus. it also looks pretty on the table. i think the dressing could stand on its own for use on a regular salad. even my tomato-hater loved it!

Great with cherry tomatoes from the garden sliced in half.  Also added yellow squash half-moon slices and Hungarian and Sweet Banana peppers, seeded and cut in rings.  Great tomato salad.

I have made this MANY times and am always asked for the recipe.  I use Roma tomatoes when possible (easier to handle) and serve slightly cool.  Last time I used Balsamic vinegar (a little less than called for) and it was great!

This was awesome, I made it to go with our pot roast and it was an amazing complimenting dish, with the tanginess. It was super easy to make and my husband loved it. I made just a small tester batch with 2 tomatoes and now I can't wait for garden tomatoes, that I can actually use instead of freeze and never see again. I will add more vinegar next time and I might try it with cucumbers, but then why mess with perfection. The best thing is I have what little leftovers there are for my lunch. Yummy onion breath. Bring it on!! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe serves four? I think you should double up on it so that you have enough to go around! A tangy delicious treat - perfect for a snack as well as with dinner...just the juice this makes is good enough to drink! Of course, if you don't like the vinegar taste - lighten up on it (I like the tangy zip it adds)! My dinner guests and I all agree: this is a keeper, and one to share with people you love!

Use firm tomatoes and be prepared to spend some time dicing, but the result is well worth it.  This salad is attractive on a buffet table and delicious, especially with beef.

My entire family loved the tangy taste of our tomatoes when we made this - the kids enjoyed helping make it and were very suprised how easy it was. We loved the leftover salad the next day even more! Sort of like the way a pasta sauce gets better with age!

It is great for appitizer, side dish, or a meal by its self.  Even the next day for lunch.  Quick and easy.  Very delicious!
Tip:  Use a sharp knife, this makes it even easier.

I like many here, had an overwhelming amount of ripe tomatoes all ready at once and came on line to find a recipe that would use them up before they went bad basically.  I am not a huge fan of tomatoes, my husband is.  We both LOVED it and because he is a health nut I switched the vegetable oil for olive oil..don't think it changed too much.  I had more sauce than I expected to and ended up throwing some of it out but...what a BEAUTIFUL presentation, I added a few orange, green and even a sprig of mint....Oh lovely to the eye!

My Mother used this very dressing for cucumbers 65 years ago! I like a little white pepper in mine but it is awesome on the tomatoes. So now I am going for some crumbled Feta, green onion, black olives and a splash of lemon juice for the fun of it! A 
keeper for sure!

My husband and I were thought this was delicious, although my 4-year old was a little hestitant.  For her we put it on top of pizza and then she ate it.  I used a little less sugar, and the only thinig I'd change for next time would be to dice up the onion as getting an entire onion slice in your mouth is a little too powerful.

This tomatoe is salad is wonderful.  I made a large batch and it stayed good in the fridge for a week or more.  I used the tomatoes and onions in pita wrap sandwiches and they imparted an incredable flavor.  I found myself going back to the bowl for "just a couple more" repeatedly!  Yummmm!

My husband and I loved this!  I used yellow tomatoes from my garden and added some cucumbers, too!  It made such a nice, refreshing salad and was a great way to use up those tomatoes in a different way.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with three tomatoes fresh off the vine.  That's all we had ripe, so I halved all of the ingredients.  It's hard to believe a recipe so simple could be so delicious, but it's absolutely worth every star!  Thanks for a super recipe!

This was a hit at the dinner table.  My parents had an excess of tomatoes (and were getting a bit sick of just eating them raw).  This recipe allowed them to keep the healthiness of a raw tomato but make it more exciting!    My "small" onion wasn't as small as it could have been, though.  Next time I'll use either milder onion or half of one.    But so, so good!

This was quite good.  I did cut the sugar by about a quarter.  Sweet but not too sweet. So simple and easy to make! Thanks for the recipe.  Next time I will half the oil.  A little too oily for us but still good flavor.

this was good, a very nice simple recipe for the abundance of tomatoes in our garden. Next time I will add some fresh oregano and more black pepper. I would recommend only using fresh garden tomatoes as i can see the recipe being compromised with lesser quality "winter grocery store" tomatoes

I made this on a last second whim tonight and boy I was I ever glad!  It hit just the right note of sweet & sour (I used splenda & olive oil).  I am not sure I liked the tomatoes sliced, next time I will cut into wedges for easier eating.  Loved the onions too!

This is a great summer salad. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4c.(I used wine vinegar and olive oil for the dressing) and added some sliced cucumbers to it. Really yummy! Next time I'm going to add feta or blue cheese. Thanks for a keeper!

I must be the odd (Wo)man out with all the great rating because This was WAY TOO SWEET. Now I'm trying to figure out what I may have done wrong?? I even cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup and used 1/4c white and 1/4c balsamic vinegar as others suggested. I know that the better the balsamic the sweeter, so that could have been one of the culprits, as mine is pretty sweet, the other is that the tomatoes I used were salsa tomatoes, which are very meaty and have NO Juice at all, so the salad never got a chance to dilute, (I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing??) not even by the next day! So I will have to try it again with plain ol juicy tomatoes and plain ol vinegar! Actually, to make a quick and similar version of this I just usually use zesty Italian dressing and mix in sugar to taste. Sorry about the 3 stars, the rating wasn't really fair and I wanted to remove it but found I couldn't!

Yum!  I love summertime when the tomatoes are perfect for this refreshing salad.  It does make a lot of dressing, so be careful.  I added cucumbers (like over reviewers) and did half balsamic vinegar/half white vinegar.  This is fantastic!  Thank you, I've been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.

This salad is so wonderful!  I have received so many compliments and been asked for the recipe by just about everybody who has had it.  I do add a few things to add a little bit of color.  In addition to the tomatoes, I use one green, yellow, red, and orange bell pepper.  I have also added cucumbers as well.  To cut back on sugar, I use either Splenda or Equal (I think usually around 10 packets or so, depending on your taste).  Warning:  this salad is addicting!

Tastes exactly like the one you get on a salad bar yet BETTER!!!!  THANK YOU CHRISSY!!!!!!  YOU ROCK!!!!  I'd give it a 10 if I COULD!!!

I made some ajustments based on a similar recipe I had at a recent family reunion: I used only 5 tomatoes BUT I added a large green bell pepper (chopped) and used a red onion instead of yellow. Then, I used the following amts = 1/4c water, 2 TBLS wht sugar, 2 TBLS wht vinegar, and 1 TBLS of oil (mixed together by pouring into a glass jar I could seal tight and shake).  I then poured it over the tomato/veggie mix and chilled for and hour.  About 1/2 hour before I served this, I fried up 6 slices of bacon, let it cool and then crumbled it into the salad.  Wow -oh -wow! VERY GOOD! Colorful, flavorful, and overall, a very easy recipe! Will make this again!

This was soooooooooooo good. It was gone in no time. I used a red onion instead of a yellow onion and the sweetness of the onion allowed me to use less sugar.

I've made this a few times and it's a family favorite. Simple but so flavorful - the dressing really compliments the tomato flavor.

I only made a small serving b/c my husband does not eat tomotoes or cucumbers, which means I did not measure out the oil, vinegar, or sugar.  Also, I left out the onions.  However, it turned out wonderful!!!!! I ate this with a sandwich, instead of chips, for a nice change.  It was easy to make and a great way to enjoy fresh veggies from the garden!

Followed recipe as written with one exception. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Great flavor. Ended up with a lot of liquid. I think next time I will reduce amount of liquid and sugar in equal proportion . Great way to use up some tomatoes that were quickly ripening.

Simple and delicious- had no veg and needed to use up some tomatoes that were all getting ripe, easy peasy and fresh and tasty. I'm sure it would be just as delicious with cukes and other salad veg!

I made this for Thanksgiving as a side salad and everybody was looking for seconds.  I used a bit less dressing.  This even makes not so good tomatoes taste good.

Just made this for the first time as we finally had a successful crop of tomatoes this year.  Only change I made was slightly less oil and scant half cup of sugar. I did use olive oil after reading reviews. Sprinkled a little  shredded parmesan mix over the top. I would make the dressing to use on salads too. Yummy!

This worked great with cherry tomatoes too. Just the right balance of sweet and sour. I added a little parsley for flavor and color.

Yum!  I made with olive oil and no salt or pepper.  The only thing I would change is to use a little less oil, maybe 1/4 cup instead of a half. A little fresh basil would be good too.  It was fantastic as is, I just think it would work as well with less oil.  We had with fried tenderloins and it was a perfect complement.  I let marinade for about an hour.  This one will be pinned.

This was okay, but I didn't think it was anything all that special. I know a lot of people really loved it but I wasn't that impressed. It wasn't bad  but I can't help feeling like I wasted a ton of tomatoes.

We've been eating tomatoes all summer long from our garden, so now that it's September and we are still picking tomatoes, I thought a tomato salad every now and them would be good. I tweeked Chrissy's recipe a bit...here is what we like. Using 6 or 7 good sized tomatoes, I also add thinly sliced Vidalia onion, chopped green peppers, sweet red peppers, and cucumbers all from my garden. For the dressing I use about 1/2 Cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/3 Cup red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, garlic powder and a dash of oregano to taste. I let this marinate at room temp for an hour or so. The flavors are so much better served at room temp. No doubt you'll have some dressing left over after all the veggies have been eaten up. Don't hesitate to dip your favorite bread in this concoction, very yummy. We like tangy dressings. Your tastes might require that you add a bit of sugar, but I don't think you'll need as much as the original recipe calls for.

This is one of my all time favorites!  I DO add strips of bell pepper and slices of cucumber. Sometimes I give it a south-of-the-border twist and add a dash of chili powder and a splash of Tabasco sauce.

I thought this was great!  Like other reviewers, I halved the dressing ingredients and found it to be more than enough liquid.  I used apple cider vinegar because that is what I had on hand, and also used olive oil.  The only changes I made:  added 1 minced garlic clove, two strips of crisp bacon, and a shake (or two) of basil.  Yum!  I made it yesterday, and it is even better today.  Will definitely make again.

This was a wonderful salad. You gotta like tomatoes of course but if you do, this is the best. The dressing is delightful - get some fresh Italian bread and dip the bread in the dressing ... yum! It was a bit heavy on the onions but either I got onion that weren't sweet enough or I used too many. I would definitely make it again. I think it would make a great dish-to-pass.

I loooved this recipe and don't even like tomatoes that much!!!! My boyfriend loved it too.  I used half the sugar it called for, and still found it a bit 2 sweet, so next time i will prob use 1/8 c. sugar.  I prob could have used 1/4 c. vinegar and 1/4 c. veg oil because there was a LOT of juice at the bottom of the bowl between the juices from the tomatoes and everything else.

Pretty good, but you have to be careful what you serve it with.  It can easily overpower your main dish.  I also used splenda and olive oil to make it a bit healthier.

This was great!  I used a bit less oil and used red wine vinegar, and it was wonderful.  I also used red onions.  I added fresh mozzarella one time, and feta cheese at another serving.  Very good!

Actually, I don't know if this is worth 5 stars as written or not, but mine came out yummy so there you go!  I used apple cider vinegar and tossed in a little oregano, hubby said it was perfect and to write down what I did.  A recipe, though, is really only a guideline ... and I didn't measure a thing!  Oh, well.  It'll be good next time, but probably slightly different again.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful flavors!  Try adding carrots, fresh corn (cut right off cob), and broccoli florets with the tomatoes.  Not only is it beautiful but all the vegetables are enhanced by the dressing!  I'm serving this with sundried tomato/artichoke pasta and crusty garlic bread tonight! Yummy!

This is a very easy salad, however, I made some substitutions. Rather than vegetable oil, I went with olive oil, and rather than the white vinegar, I went with balsamic vinegar. In order to brighten the salad up, I used a variety of tomatoes....regular reds, and also yellow and green. 

I also chopped up some cucumbers and added small squares of cheddar cheese. 

It was a big hit at every summer party I attended.

this was yum! i like mine spicy though, so I included two chopped up birdseye chilies and a clove of minced garlic. for the vinegar i combined balsamic and cane. the addition of cucumbers was good too! i also made a variation using a splash of sesame oil and toasted sesame seeds. this is a good recipe to play around with!

Nice way to use tomatoes from garden, I also added a couple cucumbers to the mix and used half white vinegar and half red wine. The vegetables aren't overpowered with alot of seasonings. I will make again and play around with different vinegars. Thanks for recipe.

Excellent.  I also reduced the sugar, and used half balsamic/half white vinegar and it was great.  To make it a meal, I added cukes, cubed firm tofu, and bite-sized pieces of torn multigrain bread, and drained the extra dressing for later use.

A little (lot) too sweet for me so I had to increase the vinegar to compensate.  I used red onion and olive oil. Next time I will decrease the sugar.

I used balsamic vinegar and added diced red pepper, cubed sharp cheddar & minced fresh oregano and served on a bed of lettuce. DH loved it because of the balsamic vinegar and I thought it was pretty good, but a little "sharp". Next time I will add a bit less vinegar and   also add some cucumber and more onion.

11.2.18  This is the type of quick-and-easy salad that we often eat in this house.  For our tastes, I substituted olive oil for the vegetable, and cut that amount back a bit, otherwise followed this simple recipe.   Certainly nothing fancy here, just a tasty salad to get on the table in minutes that everyone will enjoy.

This was just ok. I served it at FOL lunch. I would definitely decrease the amount of oil! Fresh tomatoes are a must. I made this in the morning and that gave it enough time to get a good flavor. I also used some fresh basil. I would try this again.

This is surprisingly tasty, I have made it twice this week . it's easy to reduce the amounts, just use equal parts of sugar, vinegar and olive oil. I used green onions once and that was fine.

Everybody loves this all year long, and it's especially good right when you pick the tomatoes warm off the plants. It's good to keep a jug of the dressing in the fridge. Simple and perfect.

This is a favourite from my earliest childhood memories.  My grandmother used to make this in the summer using tomatoes from her garden.  Thank you for reviving that wonderful memory.  By the way, I recommend virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.

I added cucumbers to the salad and I liked it but next time I will cut back on the sugar.  I thought it was a little too sweet.  After most of the tomatoes and cucumbers were eaten I added some more.  Great to have for summertime meals.

Delicious! Since everything was sliced thin, the tomatoes and onions took on the flavor in minutes! Only change was to add a little garlic powder. Perfect quick side dish. Especially if you have extra tomatoes!

Have made this twice just as written and it is delicious. After reading through the reviews I am now anxious to try "playing with it" a little. I am going to try the olive oil and/or apple cider vinegar next time and see how it compares to the original. The crumbled blue cheese also sounds interesting. Thanks for a great recipe!

My mother-in-law gave me a bunch of tomatos so I made this recipe.  I think this is a 4* as written as I think it lacks in flavor.  I will for sure make again but next time add some fresh basil.  It just needs a little something more. In fact I just may add some basil to the left overs that I have in the fridge... OR maybe put on some italian bread and make bruschetta with it

I make this every summer when I have tomatoes in my garden. I don't use oil though, personal preference. I also add sliced cukes and either fresh basil or cilantro from my garden for some added flavor.

I wasn't a huge fan of this and either was my husband.  I probably won't make it again.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!! I used olive oil instead of vegetable just for my preference. But it is sooo easy and my fresh garden tomatoes added a beautiful and crisp flavor. Thank you!

My aunt gave me a recipe similar to this in 1959 but hers also had cucumber slices and bermuda onion rings. I make it with red wine vinegar and extra virgin olive oil along with the sugar.  Once you start eating this it's hard to stop.

Very tasty and refreshing. I used my very own home grown tomatoes along with purple onion (I didn't have a yellow onion). I chose to use olive oil rather than vegetable oil because other reviewers chose to. I will be serving this again, but next time I will try adding some olives! Yum!

Very good Very easy. I cut down on the vinger a little as we don't like things to tart and I used olive oil.

This was good but way too sweet. Cut the sugar to 1/4 c. and use apple cider vinegar instead of white. A refreshing side dish to a heavy main course.

This is a great way to use your fresh garden tomatoes.  Just wonderful!  I scaled down a bit - it makes a lot of dressing.  I took the suggestion by one reviewer to add some crumbled blue cheese and sliced olives and we all loved it.

This is another way to use up those extra tomatoes from the garden! We really liked this, but I want to experiment with the dressing next time,only needed about half the amount and I might add a little water so there will not be so much oil. My mother used to fix cucumbers and onions with a dressing similar to this, so I am sure that the extra addition of cucumbers would be pretty good. I like it just like this with the onions and tomatoes... Oh yeah, next I will peel the tomatoes!!
Update, I used a bottle tomato vinnagrette, cause I wanted to try something different , It was terrific!
Also I peeled the tomatoes , just put them it hot, hot water for 3 or 4 sec. and they peel easy.

This salad is so easy and wonderful!  I cut the sugar back a little and sometimes substitute red onions and add cucumbers.  Great side dish for BBQ's.
