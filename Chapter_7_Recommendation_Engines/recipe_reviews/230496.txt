This is really a delicious way to use canned yams. Had a couple of cans in the pantry and didn't want to just do the typical yams with marshmallows. My wife doesn't like yams or sweet potatoes - but she LOVED this! The only thing I added was some miniature gingerbread flavored marshmallows on top. All the many flavors and textures of this dish is just amazing!

It is an outstanding blend of tart and sweet.  I make this several times during the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons and it is always well-received!

This a better looking and tastier twist.   It's almost like a yam/cranberry crisp.    It looks festive and doesn't have. The uber sweet taste that is associated with the yam mallow side dish.   Great for thanksgiving.  Great for Christmas.   I did not measure my marshmallow.  I believe I used a handful or two in the photo.

If you are wanting to have something different then the traditional yams with marshmallows this is the recipe to try....my three year old who is a picky eater even ate it all and then asked for more!!!!
