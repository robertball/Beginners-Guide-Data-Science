freekin delicious, people!!  seriously!  and easy to boot!  for about 1.25 lbs of sea bass i started out with 1 tspn each spice & 1/2 tspn of lemon pepper.  that was too much lemon pepper so i added another 1/2 tspn of garlic, onion & paprika. it was just right. after sprinkling, i patted the fish and it ended up basically as a paste which kind of made a crust as it broiled.  done, btw, on the second rack level of the oven.  as the paste began to crisp i moved the rack down one more level.  i drizzled just a bit of olive oil as the amount called for is too much in my opinion.  definitely does not need the amount called for. also, i served the butter on the side.  honestly, it was delicious with or without the butter.  it really isn't needed.  but that's just me as i try to cut fat wherever i can. served with garlic lemon green beans & brown rice.  scrumpdillyicious!!  p.s. if you are in the long beach area, you simply must visit the fishmonger at the alamitos marina farmers market on sunday.  his fish is amazing!!  but get there early cuz he sells out fast.  bon appetit, mon frer!

Wow 5+++++stars This was great a restaurant quality dish. I made as stated with the exception of sea salt, did not have so I used kosher, but scaled it back some. I also used Chilean Sea Bass which was really expensive (21.99lb) OUCH!!!!. But it was worth every penny. I charcoal grilled mine about 8 min per side over high heat. Can't say enough about this dish, will try a cheaper sea bass next time though. Chilean Sea Bass will be for special occasions. Oh!!! I almost forgot what ever you do please do not leave out the last step with a good quality EVOO it makes a world of difference. UPDATE!!!!!!  I MADE THIS AGAIN LAST NIGHT, ONLY I USED RED SNAPPER BECAUSE IT WAS ON SALE, IT TURN OUT REALLY GOOD, THIS IS A LIGHT FLAVORFUL FISH WITH RESTAURANT QUALITY TASTE. I DID GRILL MINE AND FOLLOWED RECIPE AS BEFORE. 5++++STARS.

I used this recipe with grouper fish.  I thought it was fantastic.  I mixed up the spices and put them in a ziplock bag.  Then I added a little olive oil to my fish and added them to the bag and gave it a good shake.  I let them sit in the fridge until I was ready to cook them. I didn't have time to grill tonight, so I put them in the oven on 400 for about 15 mins.  They were great!  I also doubled the recipe for the spices.  I used 2 filets, very large in size.

This is an excellent combination of seasonings. I recommend that you double or triple the amount of seasoning so the fish is completely coated. I double the amounts shown just for two servings. I am partial to Chilean Sea Bass and have made this several times with that fish. My only other change is that I drizzle the finished fish with white Truffle oil instead of regular olive oil before serving. Truffle oil is a highly refined olive oil with the fragrance of truffles. It’s very pricey but you don’t use much and it is usually only found in upscale grocery stores. If you can’t find it in your area, just do a “Google” search and you can buy it online. It adds an incredible finishing touch to a fine dish and you will not be disappointed.

I had never tried sea bass, so went to your website for a recipe as friends were bringing it for New Year's Eve.  Well, it was outstanding.  All 6 of us agreed.  It was certainly simple to do, and I read the reviews, which are very helpful, and I baked it at 400 for 20 mins. because my stove was being used for a pasta recipe.  Just fantastic, however, I'm going to try cheaper fish, as this cost my friend 45.00!  Wow!  Is there a good cheaper type of fish that will fare well with this recipe?

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I left out the sea salt and garlic and replace it with garlic salt mixed in with the melted butter.  I wrapped in foil, cooked slowly on the grill, and then finished up the fish directly on the grill, for that 'grilled look'.  Place on a plate and poured the butter mixture over top.  Very good.

very nice recipe, easy and quick, good flavor, my only problem was I cooked the fish a bit too long.  also would suggest to add paprika after fish is taken off the grill so the paprika does not burn

For 2- 7oz filets I used 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder 1/2 teaspoon paprika and 1/2 teaspoon lemon pepper. I omitted the salt completely and did not use the garlic herb butter. I lined a baking sheet with aluminum foil, sprayed with PAM and baked the filets at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, then flip them and baked for about 5 more minutes. It was outstanding!

I AM SOOOO PICKY WITH SEAFOOD....THIS WAS AWESOME! By far the best we have ever made at home. Definitely Double the seasonings. Omit Olive Oil at the end...herbed butter in recipe is enough. If you use dried Parsley instead of Fresh...Cut the amount in half or less.

Fantastic! I literally just finished dinner and knew I had to come leave my comments. Every bite was fantastic. Rather than grilling, I took the advice of another member and baked at 400 for 15 minutes. I drizzled with the butter mixture when I first put in oven, then 1/2 way through cooking time, turned fish over and drizzled the rest of the butter. This was to die for! Thanks so much for posting the recipe. It's my new "go to" recipe for fish. :)

 8-31-11 Edited to add: Tried last night on salmon fillets and even my husband, who hates fish, commented on how good it was. Very versatile recipe!

We made this for Valentines day and used high quality seabass from Central Market. We followed the directions to a "t" and added a squirt of fresh lemon juice after the fish came off the grill. We thought it tasted fishy so threw it in the oven which helped release some of that natural butter flavor seabass has. That helped but it certainly wasnt resturant style.

WOW - this is a great fish recipe. We eat a significant amount of fresh fish, and sea bass has become our favourite. This recipe is a definite keeper and the reviews were very helpful in making some adaptations. I omitted the salt all together, reduced the amount of butter by half, and used only 1/2 tbsp of oil drizzled over the cooked fish. Thanks for the special recipe Stephanie.

Awesome! I can't believe anyone gave this low reviews. I've lived in various places, and now live in New Mexico. Fresh seafood is hard to come by in these parts. My husband and I finally caved and ordered some fresh fish from alwaysfreshfish.com. When it arrived, I was so excited to have something fresh and delicious. I was not disappointed. My husband and I both loved every single bite. Even my 3 year old loved it. I did double the spices for more taste, and we broiled it in the oven on low rather than grilling. Super easy to make, but it took an additional 7 minutes to get it cooked properly in the oven. I also covered it with foil for the last seven minutes to keep it from browning too much. Chilean Sea Bass was AMAZING!!! Melted in our mouth like butter. Mmmmm!

This was delicious!!! My 2 and 7 year old daughters loved it. This was the first time I fixed bass, so it was a big surprise. I made a couple of changes though: I mixed all the spices with the melted butter, and spread the butter mixture over both sides of the fish. Then I baked it at 400F for 20 minutes. It was so flaky, buttery, and flavorful! Thanks for a great recipe! Enrique

Awesome!! We rated this our best "at home" cooked fish ever! I added a dash of cumin and left out the parsley. Killer stuff. I fixed this 2 nights in a row-we couldn't get enough. Thank you for a great recipe- I can't wait to have it again. I will be trying it on halibut next-yummmm!

Fantastic!  For an oven preparation I seared the fish 5 minutes on each side in a small cast iron stovetop and then finished it in the oven at 400 for about 7 minutes.  Perfect!

Great recipe.  Like other reviewers, I baked the fish at 400 for 20 minutes.  Half way through I drizzled the butter/garlic mixture on.  With 5 minutes left, I sprinkled on a little parm cheese.

Excellent and easy way to prepare fish.  I used Corvina, a type of Sea Bass that is more affordable.  Baked it at 400 degrees and turned half way through.  About 12 minutes each side for 1 1/4 inch thick pieces of fish.  Also doubled the seasoning recipe.

I have not fixed sea bass before. It was on sale so I thought I would try it.  I bought a 1 lb fillet then got online to find a recipe.  This was the first recipe to pop up and it looked easy and good.  I fixed it and we loved it.  I didn't have any onion powder so used a no-salt seasoning (like Mrs. Dash) and it worked just fine.

Very good! we didn't have onion powder, so we marinated it with fresh onion and the rest of the ingredients the night before. I added olive oil. The day of the party, we cooked it in the oven for 15 minutes, instead of the parsley we used rosemary to cover the fish and covered the pan with aluminium foil.

It was fantastic - my wife even told me it was the best Seabass she ever had. I made extra spice mixture for later use and I'm glad I did.   Thank you for posting this and for everybody's comments. I rarely comment in recipes, but this one deserves the compliment. 

I love Seabass and never make it because it is so expensive and don't want to screw it up by coking it poorly. After running across this recipe and reading the reviews, I made this on the grill outside. I used a combination of post oak, red oak and one chunk of hickory (mesquite burns too hot and makes fish bitter).  I served with veggies cooked on the grill in a foil "tent" - cut fingerling potatoes, red and white onion rings, green and red bell peppers, asparagus, green beans drizzled with olive oil, fresh rosemary, sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  Wrap it up leaving space inside on the top for steaming - think of making a triangle with a chimney with a little hole at the top. Perfect compliment for a splendid dinner. 

Pas others mentioned, I will use this recipe again with other fish.

This was absurdly good... I didn't grill the fish though, I spiced the fish with these exact spices and baked the seabass in a foil packet with a little extra butter on the fish @ 400 degrees for 30 minutes and OH MY GOODNESS!  So unbelievably tasty, it came out perfect and flakey soft and delicious!

I consider myself a pretty good cook.  However, though I love fish, I'm not the greatest fish cooker.  Until this recipe :)  Thank you.  My Sea Bass came out amazing.  My son couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  I made it exactly as posted, not changing a thing.  Great recipe.

I tried this recipe on Mahi Mahi fillets from Costco.  Cooked 6 minutes a side on the upper grill away from direct heat so they baked more than grilled.  OMG!  My favourite fish ever!  Also worked well with Tilapia.  What a great recipe.THANKS.

The seasoning didn't stand up to the bass in this dish. I made the recipe exactly as instructed, but had to cook it for about 5 minutes longer. I liked the flavors, but they weren't enough for the fish.

Good seasoning on the fish.  I seared fish in a little olive oil and then roasted in 425 oven.  Finished with sqeeze of lemon instead of the olive oil.

I broiled this in the oven. I was very please with the outcome. I did not drizzle the fish with olive oil at the end. However, I did add a little olive oil to the butter, garlic and parsley and I drizzled this mixture over the fish. It was a great finishing touch. I can't wait to try this on the grill.

Excellent!! Although it was just too hot to grill out side. I preheated the oven to 500 with a ceramic baking dish to temp, then added a littl EVOO then the fish which I let sit in the butter and spices for 20-25 minutes. Cooked it then for a total of 10 minutes (turning half way). Just a perfect flavor!!!

Leave out the olive oil!  I followed the advice of the other reviewers who stressed the importance of the oil, but it made the dish...oily.  I'd make it again without the olive oil.

FABULOUS! Sea Bass has always been described as the "butter fish" and rightfully so. This recipe enhances that flavor. I do not use a grill so I simply make this recipe in a skillet on top of the stove. It is fabulous.

I caught a nice Striped Bass yesterday and had no idea how to cook it!  I am so happy I came to my "go to" recipe place!  I did triple the spices and just added them to the butter to make a paste. Brushed on the fish grilled about 7 minutes on each side on high and yum!  It did fall apart just a tad. Served with a summer squash/Zucchini and diced tomato medley stir fry which was the perfect compliment! Skipped the olive oil mostly to eat a guilt free ice cream sundae!

Sea bass was a new fish for us to try.  It is beautifully white and inviting in appearance.  The fish itself is delicate and mild in flavor so we didn't want to overpower the natural flavor.  This recipe was spot on for us.  Knowing the delicate texture, we used foil on the grill and had no sticking issues.  The fish had a nice grilled flavor and stayed intact.  Another great addition to our seafood dinner down the shore.

This was Okay, but not great.  Not enough flavor with the seasoning mixture.  Next time I will add some cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit.

PHENOMMMMMINAL!!!!! We NEVER rate recipes...we just enjoy them - this one deserves accolades!!!! Absolutely unbelievably good. We purchased this beautiful Chilean Sea Bass steak, a bit pricy so we did not want to ruin it. My husband is a skilled chef and this recipe took us both by surprise. We tripled the seasoning as others had suggested. It was divine! Our 2 year old loved it as well. For anyone who is wary of new recipes....we cook as a hobby and love to eat - this is a sure fire winner, you cannot go wrong. ENJOY!

I don't eat seafood myself but my husband is a fishing guide on a local lake and loves to eat fish, as do my grown girls. He wanted me to "bake/grill/broil" more fish for him so I tried this recipe.  He almost had it all eaten before we could finish grilling. He says it gets an A+...I guess that's 5 stars.

I made this tonight for my wife because I don't eat fish...at least I didn't eat fish until I tried this!  It was awesome!  I don't know that I'm a fish lover, but I am now a sea bass lover!  I made it exactly as written but shortened the grilling time by one minute per side (grilled for 6 min per side).  Next time I will make more of seasoning mix and cover both sides of the bass with it rather than just sprinkle it on.  The seasoning was perfect.  Thank you for introducing me to sea bass!

This was absolutely amazing! I, like others, made some changes.I didn't like the way my lemon pepper tasted, so I decided to create my own. I used fresh pepper, lemon zest, sea salt, & orange zest and juskept adding until the flavor was right. I also added more butter instead of olive oil once they were done. These were better than sea bass we had at a pricey fish restaurant

This was delish! Instead of Chilean Sea bass, I used wreckfish (also known as stone bass) instead as this is on the "best choice" for being farmed in environmentally friendly ways. I also pan seared rather than grill- it was really yummy!

Very good- I will make it again.  Thank you!
I tried making it without the added salt and drizzle of olive oil and it was 4 star without those.  I could tell it would be better with the addition.  We were happy with it topped with lemon juice as a healthier version, though.

This was very good! I don't know how that much rub would have worked with 2 pounds though. I had two small pieces and used all the rub. I also felt the grill temp was too high. I had the middle burner off and the front and back on medium. I grilled it in the middle. The butter and garlic was delicious. (I did use less of that since it was only 2 pieces of fish.) I will make this again!

Simple and really easy...first try on some whole sea bass...and they were a hit.  I made 4 times as much since I had a lot of fish and it was perfect with all the dry ingredients (including the salt and Lemon Pepper) in equal proportions.

The flavors were delicious smelling. And it tasted even better. The only thing was the cooking temp is a little high, it actually burned some of our fillets. I think next time we will just reduce the heat down and baby sit the fish a bit more carefully.

thought that it was just ok.  I used 1/2 tsp of butter and I still felt that the fish was too oily.  The flavor was good, but I don't think that I will be making this again.  It also smelled up the kitchen for a while and my husband had serious issue about that :) thanks anyway

Easy. Fast. Wonderful. I used the full recipe amounts for two 8oz fillets. I also used roasted garlic cloves in the butter (remove cloves before drizzling). I also used butter flavored non-stick spray, covering the fillets, then sprinkling the seasoning over top & bottom instead of rub. No matter, I think you'll find it difficult to do wrong with variations. Just use FRESH high quality bass & you won't be disappointed. This one is a keeper!!! Melts in your mouth.

Chilean Sea Bass is so unbelieveably delicious on its own it just needs a little something extra when you cook it to truly bring out the wonderful flavor of the fish.  This is the perfect way to do just that.  We used our grill pan on the stove rather than risk putting it on the outdoor grill when we cooked it.  It's too expensive a fish to take a chance.  This recipes was just perfect.  Very flavorful without covering up the taste of the fish that makes Chilean Sea Bass so wonderful.

This is seriously the best fish I have ever made. The sea bass held up well on the grill. I used lemon balm in place of the parsley. A wonderful smokey flavor enveloped the fish. Everyone raved about it for hours.

This is fabulous!  My husband loves this recipe.  We've also subsituted halibut in place of the sea bass and it is great.

WOW!!! This is the best, not one of the best, but the best meal I have ever made myself! And probably one of the top 5 meals I have ever had worldwide.  

I created an account just so I could rate this recipe. I didn't even do that for the weber artichoke stuffed chicken recipe which used to be my favorite thing to grill.

To preface this review, I had a light snack before going to fresh market to get ingredients for this meal. So I am not biased from being too hungry before eating. The layer of flavors this fish has makes your taste buds go off like fire works. Another disclaimer, (Chilean) sea bass is my favorite fish. The sea bass i had in Cinque Terre, Italy still beats this recipe, but not by much!

My dad has made this recipe before, and I took some tips from him. Put olive oil on the fish before rubbing in the seasoning. My dad tends to under season, so I didn't listen to him for how much rub he uses - I made extra.  I also made extra butter garlic parsley. 

Okay for the sides, I used the extra butter garlic parsley for dipping good bread in, and then added parm cheese, and finished in the oven at 400 degrees.

the very best piece of fish I ever tasted! (not to mention that I cooked)! Of course, it didn't hurt that it was from the finest seller of fish I've ever found - at the farmers market in Culver City CA.

Good grief this is delicious. Instead of mixing up the seasonings I sprinkled directly onto the fish and also gave them a very light coat of flour.  I went ahead and mixed the butter, garlic and parsley together.  Finishing with a drizzle of olive oil was great advise.  Off the grill I cover the fish plate with a second plate to ensure it was served moist and hot.

This is absolutely fabulous and easy to make.  The only adjustment I would make is to be sure it doesn't  get overcooked on the grill.  Seven minutes on each side is a bit too long on high heat.  Just keep an eye on it.

Fantastic!  Our family, from age 9 thru 55, all loved this!  We no longer eat Sea Bass (which was our favorite fish) as it is grossly overfished and has high levels of mercury.  I went to the market looking for a substitute and purchased Escolar.  After spending $26 for fish I came home to Google a recipe.  I learned that many get ill after Escolar due to its high oil content.  UGH!  Using this recipe the Escolar was fantastic! We took the risk but we will not again.  I'll be on the lookout for another Sea Bass substitute.

Good flavor!  However, our sea bass was really oily.  Not sure if it was a product of grilling or just a less than great piece of fish!

Coming from my Husband who isn't huge on fish and especially not home cooked......"the BEST piece of fish he's EVER had"......restaurant quality here. Since I used the butter I omitted the Olive Oil drizzle @ the end to cut back on fat content. Simply DELICIOUS! Served w/ a side of shallot/garlic/rosemary fingerling potatoes and southern kale!!

I've never made Chilean Sea Bass before...frankly Ive never made fish in any other way than breaded.  But since I just paid $20 for not even 1lbs I wanted to do something special with it.  This recipe came out GREAT!!!  I was missing one or two ingredients (onion powder, italian parsley and lemon pepper) so I added Sazon Tropical, Szeged Fish Rub and Italian Mixed Herbs instead.  I brushed the fish with butter and garlic before cooking and broiled it at 450F for 30min (brushing with garlic and butter half way through again).  I did add a small drizzle of olive oil once it was cooked as recommended, not sure how much difference it made but why mess with perfection!  ;P   It came out AMAZING!  Flavorful and crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside.  Definitely adding this to my repertoire of fish prep!!!

Based on how limited and simple the ingredient list was, I was seriously skeptical about how this would turn out.  Based on reviews, though, I thought I'd try it.  I was making a special going-away dinner for my son, and it...was...AMAZING!!!  How can three little ingredients (garlic, onion, paprika) make this soooo good???  Doesn't really matter...fact is, they do!  I only cooked my bass for 5 minutes each side, then let them rest for about 5 minutes after they came off the grill.  Trust me when I say this will be our go-to recipe for bass, and we'll even experiment with it for other types of meat.  

A couple of modifications I made:  didn't have lemon pepper (yuck), so I subbed Tajin.  Also, I would cut back on the butter next time.  Even without drizzling with EVOO at the end, this was plenty oily--enough to make us feel kinda queezy by the end of our feast.  

Amazing recipe!  Like others said, it's restaurant quality.  I travel a LOT for a large, national company and eat at the finest places, so I know quality food.  Quit reading and just make this!  :)

Such an easy and delicious fish to cook. This fish has the ability to soak in every seasoning, delivering phenomenal taste in every bite.  Dropping $17.99 a pound when you need 2 is the toughest part of this recipe. :)

This is a great dish.  I also used other suggestions and just drizzled the EVOO with some garlic and herbs.  I've made this twice, and will continue to make it.  It's easy and delicious.

I actually made this with Halibut and thought it was really good.  I know it would be even better with seabass, but I was making it on a Monday...didn't want to spend the extra money.  Very light flavor and love the fact that it is done on the grill.  Thanks!

Fabulous - I'm not a cook at all and made this for my fiance and he was THRILLED - I would say to use less butter than suggested - doesn't need it. Bass is a rich and tasty fish already! It was so easy I'm going to make it for company next week too.

My girlfriend received some fresh striped bass and she used this recipe.  It was excellent.  Very tasty with a little spice.  And the garlic sauce at the end was perfect.  Would definitely make again and recommend.

AMAZINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! My husband is not tremendously expressive when it comes to how much he likes the food. But he was THIS time. He told me 4x how great this dish was. I thought it was super duper tasty. I made 12 oz of seabass for the 2 of us... and kept the ingredients for 4 servings. I love garlic and onions, so I felt that you couldn't go wrong with a little more than each serving amount. It was DELICIOUS. I followed someone else by topping it with Truffle Oil. Did I say how AMAZING this was? I will make this over and over. I made a side of wheat pasta with white wine and green bean salad. All of it went so well together.  Thank you to the one who submitted it!

Was truly a fine dish... Soft, flaky, moist, delicious. I didn't add the butter while the fish was on the grill. Instead, I  drizzled the warm butter/garlic/parsely on after I removed it from the grill, and omitted the olive oil. It was superb. Served with Grilled Shrimp with a sweet apple-jalapeno glaze (Canyon Foods of Dallas, TX), and some sauteed green beans with garlic, and a spinach salad.  It was a  perfect meal.

This was really good, but sounded a little fatty with all the oil and butter, so I had to change it a little to my healthy lifestyle. I used a whole sea bass, sprinkled it with all the seasonings inside and out. Added one tsp margarine into the fish. Added garlic and parsley in and around the fish. Wrapped it in foil. It was really great even without all the butter and oil.

Grilled on BBQ. Flavour was great with seasoning. Used Chilean Sea bass and had to cook longer due to thickness of fish. Omitted the oil as there was enough butter. Definitely keep eye on grill when adding butter (as someone else had stated).

I prepared this to go along with white beans and rice. I doubled the ingredients of seasonings~~Did not have on onion powder, used chives (freeze dried) and added two tablespoons of Durkees Grill Creations, Citrus Grill (u can find this at Sam's club-we really like it :)  We drzzled the butter, but ony used enough (melted in a mircowave) to lightly drizzle all fillets. I sprayed on a little lemon juice just before removing---did not have lemon/ pepper. It was fantastic, and was a pleasure to smell while grilling. Next time, i will prepare a shrimp pasta dish, think it would mix well together ;)

The flavoring is light and not overpowering, but it's a lot of fish per serving.  This recipie also works well with other fish like sole.  You can use foil on the grill if the fish falls apart too easily.

Outstanding!  I've made this several times with different white fish: sea bass, grouper, halibut.   Love the rub as it forms a very nice crust on the outside of the fish if you apply it very liberally.  The butter/garlic adds to the flavor profile.  I can't imagine any making any changes. Perfect as is.  Thank you!

Very easy and tasty.  I did not have lemon pepper, so I squeezed a lemon over the fish before sprinkling with the dry ingredients.

Oh my goodness, this is heaven on a plate.  I had never eaten or cooked sea bass and had no idea it was this good.  It was too cold outside to grill so I broiled it instead.

Really loved the combination of spices and the simplicity of this recipe.  So easy and flavourful. Unfortunately, slightly overlooked the fish, which is why I am giving it 4 stars.  I know had it cooked a little less, fish would have kept more moisture.   Advice: keep your eyes on the fish. Cooks fast! I used a cast iron skillet on medium, and it got that gorgeous crispy brown colour ( and amazing flavouring). 2 minutes less each side would have been perfect.  Will certainly try again soon.  Delicious!

My wife and I love this recipe. It's quick and reliable. I use applewood on the grill. I omit the olive oil drizzle as I find it leaves the fish oily. Also, I reduce the butter by1/3 to reduce calories, although I LOVE BUTTER.

I thought the herb rub was delicious, perfect for the fish.  My complaint is that the dish seems awfully oily.  I only used half the butter called for, and skipped the olive oil entirely, and by husband and I both found it greasy (and believe me, he is no health nut).  I will definitely use the seasoning mix again, sans butter/oil.

I made this for lunch today, didn't have onion powder so I grated some fresh spanish onion into the butter.  I also added a few red pepper flakes to the butter mixture and it turned out perfect!  I grilled this over high using a grilling basket.  The spices formed a great crust that retained the moisture in the fish and added a wonderful flavor.

This was AMAZING!!!!!  Followed the recipe to a tee!  However I poured the butter after i took it off the grill so not to have butter drip everywhere.

I'll give it 3 1/2 stars. Had it marinating for 2 hours. We had it last night for dinner, I don't even recall what it tasted like so neither of us were impressed enough if we can't remember the meal.

Used stripped bass that my husband caught this morning. Recipe was very easy to follow, the only adjustment I think I'll make next time, cause there will be a next time, is to add just a little more Lemon Pepper. I served this with Herbed Green Beans, from this site, and mashed potatoes.

Excellent Recipe.  So easy to make.  We didn't feel like starting up the grill, so I used my grill pan on the stove. I also didn't have any lemon pepper on hand, so I just used pepper and squeezed some lemon on at the end.   Great flavor and the fish had a nice crust on the outside and was flaky and moist inside.  Will be using this recipe over and over.  Thank you!

I had 2 beautiful chilean sea bass steaks so I went online to find the best way to prepare it.  This recipe was awesome! The only thing I added was a spicy mango marinade.  The flavor was just amazing, sweet with a tiny kick! I was outside grilling and I thought the neiborhood was going to join us for dinner. I did however, have to grill the sea bass much longer due to the thickness of the fish...awesome!

I had purchased some Sea Bass and didn't know what to do with it. I found this recipe and it was EXCELLENT. So much so, that I have purchased more Sea Bass and plan to serve it the next time we have company.

This recipe was perfect.  I seared two 6 oz steaks in the frying pan (as per the instructions) and then threw the pan in the oven for 14 min (drizzling butter at the 1/2 way point).  I didn't have the powered onion on hand so I had to improvise by using a lemon pepper spice mixture.  The final result melted in my mouth - very similar to what I've had in restaurants.

Very good.  For personal preference, I would probably cut back a little on the butter and/or olive oil next time.

I've never had Bass before but our friends went to the ocean and came back with some fresh Bass.  So I tried the recipe.  Our friends and my husband are not big fish fans, but we all LOVED the bass.  It was cooked perfect and seasoned nicely.  The garlic, butter and parsley combo really made the dish!  Will use again and again!  Thank you!

Invited to my boss' for a bbq.  Brought some fresh sea bass and the ingredients in this recipe.  The fish was a huge success.  Just go a little light on the paprika.

I made this recipe with only one change. I added the butter after I took it off the grill. This is now in my top 3 fish recipes and I have a lot of them. I did serve it with a slice of fresh lemon.

I only made one small change and it was delish!  I combined the butter and olive oil together with the garlic, and drizzled it on after cooking.  Very tasty.  I'm going to try it with other fish varieties (tilapia, cod) since sea bass is kinda pricy.  Definitely worth the money though

Great recipe, easy, quick and delicious. Go easy on the salt, mine was a touch too salty (plus I had less fish than the recipe calls for). The paprika blackened very lightly, which was a nice touch. Grilled 3 minutes on the George Foreman (fish about 3/4" thick). Thanks!

This one is to be filed in my "recipes to die for folder".  The Sea bass I used was cought fresh off the coast of North CArolina by my next door neighbor.  I seasoned the fish about an hour before I grilled it.  Then basted each side with the herb garlic butter as it grilled.  My fillet was about an inch and a quarter thick, but 7 minutes per side on medium high open flame grill was perfect!

Delicious, easy, very flavorful.  I will definitely make it again.  I'm not an expert at fish preparation, so this was an experiment!  Grilled outside in the snow-covered deck.  Made with zuchinni medley.

Really superb!  Not a fish I use too often as it is too expensive, but when I do I enjoy a excellent recipe.  This is easy and gives great flavor to the fish.  I loved it and so did my husband.

What an easy recipe!  And quite good.  We had sea bass loins - a little too thick, I think.  Next time (which will be soon), I will try with thinner cuts.

I did this except pan fried it - got frozen fillets @ Costco. Thawed, cooked in same pan as I used for melting butter, etc in step 3. Then, 7 minutes each side on medium heat (gas stove). Rave review!! Will do this again soon with the rest of the fillets!!

I cooked fish in foil on grill to keep in the juices and flavors. Don't overdo the spices - garlic butter makes it! Delicious dish!

This was delicious! The key ingredient was the searing pan/dish
used on the grill. It's a round sheet made of stainless steel that helps create a restaurant quality sear and crust. Don't think it would have been as good directly on the grill.

My family loved this! It was delicious . I wrapped the sea bass in foil and then put it on the grill. I did not have to flip them over. I just sealed them in the foil and let them cook for 7 min and then opened them to add the butter/ garlic mixture, then resealed them, and let them cook for another 7-10 min.  I didn't have Lemon pepper so I substituted white pepper. At the end I didn't use olive oil, I just squeezed some fresh lemon on them.  Tip: Make sure you spray the foil with cooking spray before you put fish on foil. I will be making this again for sure!

Followed the recipe except we did not have parsley, used fresh thyme.  Used a charcoal grill.  Timed exactly as recipe describes and fish came out cooked perfectly.  Although it is not clear in the recipe, we started grilling the fish skin side down.  Also, we finished with fresh lemon slices on the plate.  We are at the ocean, so we had fresh caught sea bass and it was a wonderful light lunch.

Delish!! Quick, easy, melts in your mouth. My husband doesn't eat fish so I used the same seasoning for grilled chicken for him. Except I was out of lemon pepper. :/  Still yummy!

Awesome! I did add a squirt of lemon rather than adding olive oil after frilling. Made with Grilled Lemon-Pepper Zucchini and grilled corn.

Nice change from the way I usually fix my sea bass.  We caught these on our last deep sea fishing trip. I doubled the seasonings that was sprinkled on the fish due to other comments, glad I did, but kept the same measurements with the butter mixture.  I had a lot of cilantro on hand so I subbed that for the parsley (just my preference). I then poured the butter mixture over the top and baked at 400 for 13 mins.(The time all depends on your fish thickness, adjust and don't over cook.) I didn't need all the olive oil that was called for, just put enough in the bottom of the pan to coat if baking. Mine weren't thick cuts so I don't think it would have done well on the grill, hence the baking.  These came out Wonderful. Thicker cuts would be great on the grill. I feel this would work well on several different types of fish.

I made this last night for dinner for my boyfriend and I. I had never cooked sea bass before, so I decided I needed a recipe to go by. This one is AWESOME. My guy raved about it and claimed that it was his new favorite. Instead of grilling the filets though, I baked them. They were phenomenal and I will definitely be making them again. I pretty much followed the recipe with a few small tweaks here and there. I did not use most of the butter, as it was a fair amount. Definitely try this recipe if you like buttery, garlicky, delicious fish.

This dish way exceeded my expectations.  Corvina sea bass was on sale at my local Sprouts so I decided to give it a try.  I had never heard of, let alone tried this type of fish.  Lovely!  I believe the Corvina was a little thinner than what was used in this original recipe so we only grilled it 5 min per side instead of the 7 min.  Delicious!

My husband made a modified version of this for me for Mother's Day and it was terrific!  He omitted the chopped garlic cloves (his personal preference; not mine).  He combined all the spices/melted butter/olive oil, then brushed half of the mixture on the sea bass, then baked it for 15 minutes at 450 degrees.  After 15 minutes he brushed on the remaining spice/butter/oil mixture and let it bake for an additional 5 minutes.  It was superb!

Absolutely delicious.  I made this for my husband and myself and this recipe is a keeper!  Will definitely make again and would love to try it with halibut.  Because of the weather, I actually broiled it, but can't wait to try it on the grill!!

This is phenomenal.  Since it is December in MN, we didn't grill it.  Instead, we cooked it in the broiler for about 4-5 min each side.  Seriously, I will make this again and again.  Incredibly easy but definitely restaurant quality.  My husband loved it too!

This was great.  Five stars. I purchased a beautiful piece of wild chilean sea bass and was glad to find this easy recipe.  The only substitutions i made were cilantro for parsley and lime zest for the lemon pepper.  I would serve this to guests.

This was AWESOME!!  I used Chilean Sea Bass (not cheap fish) and it melted in your mouth like butter. I cooked it on a ridged pan and browned on all sides and then put it in the broiler for a few minutes.  Served it with mango salsa!!

What did I do wrong???  It was "ok" but not "great" like so many of you are saying.  Did I not put enough seasoning?  I didn't come close to having 2 lbs of sea bass, and still I did not have enough flavour.  If someone can give me suggestions, I'd welcome them at koolskyy@yahoo.com because I'd really like to make this recipe work.  Thanks.

Made this for my picky husband. Turned out perfectly. I grilled it on top of a non- stick grill pan (qvc) over gas grill. The outside was crispy, very moist and tender on the inside.

Oh my goodness! This recipe made the sea bass taste sooo good.  I didn't have sea salt, so I used Kosher salt and the seasoning turned out just fine.  I will probably scale back on the butter and garlic drizzle next time, as I ended up drizzling all of it on the fish and actually didn't need it.  Overall, it made for a very tasty meal!

This recipe is genius!  I used cod which was not the best texture on the BBQ but the recipe otherwise was just amazing.  I will definitely make it again with a different fish.

I did not care for this recipe. Had to kill the fish with lemon just to eat it. I think your better off just using butter,lemon and pepper on it. Just my personal opinion.

Delicious!!  I didn't have onion powder so I just grated a fresh onion.  We had a 4lb fillet and we cut in half so it would be easier to handle, in retrospect we should have done individual portions.  If you are going to be using a large amount of fish, I would suggest cutting into individual portions before grilling so that every person gets a good amount of the seasonings and butter sauce on each piece.  I used a bit more garlic powder since I love garlic.  Came out great!!

I'm so glad I found this recipe.  My husband went charter fishingand came home with a month's worth of Sea Bass, and I had no idea how to make such a fishy fish taste. Turns out, this is such a great way to eat sea bass! I broiled mine and flipped it (and drizzled it) with extra virgin olive oil because I don't use butter, and it was still delicious.  Thanks!

I'm a picky eater so finding recipes I really like is not easy and does not happen very often. I followed this one pretty much to the letter and it was one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had in my life! I'm thrilled to add this to my repetoire - if sea bass were a little less expenisive I would have it at least once a week.  Absolutely Delicious!

Very good.  I used chilean sea bass (frozen from costco) and it was delish.  I had extremely high expectations because of all the hype from the reviews, so since it wasn't the best fish I ever had, like I anticipated, I was a bit disappointed, but still delish.

what a wonderful fish recipe!!! and versatile as well. my local grocery does not carry sea bass often and when it comes in it is usually frozen. i substituted the sea bass for tilapia. it turned out beautifully. i have discovered Reynolds release foil wrap (release non-stick). it goes directly on the grill and cooks beautifully. and no messy grill! i also added a bit more paprika for color. i was very pleased with this fish dish. kept it healthy with brown rice and cauliflower.

One word for this YUMMY!!  This was really, really good!  I rarely give 5 stars unless the dish is amazing. Couple of things that I did different from the original recipe.  I put a quarter teaspoon of the onion, garlic, lemon pepper, paprika and salt (kosher) because I didn't have sea salt.  I used it more as a rub putting it on the edges along with sprinkling it on the top.  Also, I sprayed pam on the grill and had no problem with sticking.  This is a total keeper, super easy and delish and I'm looking forward to using it on other fish.  Once you put the butter on the fish stay by the grill.  You will get flare ups from the grease.  I have e-mailed this recipe to no less than 10 people today because it was so good.
Thanks for sharing with us!

Just found this recipe tonight and made it for dinner... hubby said to give it 5 stars and I agree!!  I also agree with other reviews to double the spices! ( and I only made this for 2).... ALSO, depending on your grill, ours is gas, cooking on high for 7 minutes per side was way too hot !! It started 'blackening'... so turned the heat down to med.-low.... for the last 7 minutes.  This was fast, easy to prepare, and Yummie !!  I'm always looking for sea bass recipes, and this one will be a "repeater" in our house !!
Thanks for a delious recipe !

Fantastic - used lemon zest and marinated for about an hour - garlic butter is a nice touch.  Made this for company who raved about it.

This rub is amazing. We grilled the Sea Bass and then put my lemon caper sauce over it.

This is a winner.  I make this so often that I have the spice mixture pre-made in its own spice container.  Every guest I have ever served this to raves!  I use my grill wok  for ease of cooking.  The butter/garlic/parsley and bass oil flaming on the grill caramelizing the fish;  I'm salivating as I write this.  Wild Sea Bass is $30lb and worth every cent with this recipe.

Great flavor. I did not really like the drizzle of Olive Oil at the end but tried it without it the 2nd time around. I really like this dish. Be careful not to over salt.

We used the amount of seasonings listed for about 12 oz of sea bass - that worked great. Also, I had no garlic powder, so I used garlic salt and skipped the sea salt. Also skipped the dose of olive oil and butter at the end, as many suggested. To avoid the fish breaking/flaking, we grilled it on a flat grill pan with holes. That allowed the fish to fully cook and stay intact. Delicious and elegant - we will be making it again to impress our friends! :-)

So amazing! I love Sea Bass so that part is a given. However, I don’t want my seasonings to overpower the fish. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I wouldn’t change a thing. Wish I took a picture. Next time!

The only change I would make in the future is to double the amount of the topping, simmer it on the range for 10 minutes and spoon it on the filets on the grill for only the last 5 minutes on the second side. It was delicious and I will make it again as soon as I save enough money to afford sea bass!

Very subtle flavor and very delicious. One of the best meals I ever cooked. I only made about 1 1/4 lb of sea bass (at $39/lb) but I kept all the other ingredients at stated quantities and it was perfect.

WOW! Just ... WOW! So simple and so perfect for this fish! I only used onion powder and lemon pepper (omitted the rest of the dry seasonings) and I baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes for an 8 oz filet. It was PERFECT. So delicious - I will be coming back to this recipe, no question!

We’ve been trying to eat more fish these days. We tried this dish and it came out pretty good, but like the other reviewers we found the price point too high for the experience.  When I’m paying more per pound than I would a fine cut of beef...it better be AMAZING or I’m just going to eat beef. I will try this with other types of fish. I will say the parsley and garlic topping should not be skipped. It is an essential part to making this recipe rate in the “pretty good” category

The only thing I would change is the time to cook the fish, based on the size you have.  7 minutes/side was way too long for the cuts of sea bass that I had.  It was more like 4, then 3.  I made it in a cast-iron grill pan indoors.  Outstanding!!  Family called it "restaurant-quality"!!

This was definitely the best fish we have ever eaten.  We followed the recipe and the fish was moist and delicious.  
My husband grilled it and it turned out SO good.  I definitely would recommend this recipe.

This recipe is great. What makes it even better is using fresh wild caught fish. I actually caught one of these monsters on a spearfishing trip awhile back and I must say...this recipe did the fish justice. If you ever want to try catching it yourself, check out this guide: https://castandspear.com/white-sea-bass/

Made it exactly per the recipe and it seriously is THE BEST FISH I've ever made.  Simple and delicious.  One thing to keep in mind:  Buy fresh, non-farmed raised fish.  It makes all the difference in the world.

Melt in your mouth delicious!  I added fresh rosemary and tomatoes to the parsley/garlic and used olive oil instead of butter. The flavor was outstanding.

This was AMAZING!!!   I baked it in my toaster oven at 390 degees for 18 minutes, turning it for the last 5 minutes.   Then I topped it with the garlic butter.   I did not drizzle with olive oil because it isn't necessary.   This is a restaurant quality dish!

Grilled it!  Not quite a five star. But very tasty.  My husband shopped the seafood shop and bought the pantagonian sea bass ( it's rated as best  eco friendly) crazy expensive. (But use any fish that's grill-able.  I'm cheap so I'd have gone for something less expensive, so I send him shopping!)  THEN I looked up recipes. Worth it.  Very rich.  Followed recipe but added za'aatar to the sprinkle, excellent!  I'm not sure the butter garlic really added that much, as this was so rich to begin with.  Grilled avocado and coleslaw.  Libations of French rosé.  Because this rosé is dry it was perfect to cut through the richness.  Pinot Gris or Sauvignon blanc would also be very nice pairing.  Enjoy!

The seasonings bring out the flavor of the fish.  I have made it several times.  I first followed the recipe exactly and found the fish simply too rich. Sea bass is so oily already that it does not need butter.  

Now, I follow the recipe exactly but eliminate the butter and parsley.  So much more healthy.

Yes yes yes, this is a great recipe as is!  The 2nd time I made it I added 1/8 tsp black truffle oil to the seasonings to make a paste and small squeeze of lemon instead of lemmon pepper.  Also left out the EVOO,  and salt to taste at the end. Himalayan or sea salt.  That's Sweet and Sour Red Cabbage on the side.

I used lemon zest as I did not have lemon pepper, I grilled it outside on a gas grill but I used alder wood chips.  We both loved the fish.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  Cannot wait to make it again.

The garlic -parsley butter caused  large flair ups as I grilled it directly on the grate. This caused a bracketing of the outside, but it still tasted very good. I will give it another try, but probably on foil on top of the grate.

This is a great recipe! I added don't use lemon pepper I squeeze lemon juice on the fish before cooking and add lemon zest to the butter mixture. I have made this many times with sea bass but it would be good with halibut.

This was delicious!!  I did not add the olive oil at the end, and didn't put in any parsley because we didn't have any.  The fish was moist, garlicy and wonderful.  I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Just tried this recipe and was impressed!!  Best fish dinner in a long time.  I used Sea Bass that I caught 3 weeks ago off the New Jersey coast, vacuum sealed, and in my freezer.  The filet's had skin/scales on one side which I like to keep them moist during grilling.  The spices and proportions were great and the flavor was awesome!!  Grilled for 2 minutes on flesh side and then 3 more minutes on the skin side after drizzling with the butter/garlic/parsley sauce.  Came out perfect so didn't even need the olive oil!!

The word "yum" is an understatement for this recipe!  This recipe creates a restaurant quality dish that I honestly was not expecting.   My iPad ran out of charge right before I started prepping and cooking the fish so I had to go by memory.  I didn't measure out the spices, i just put in what I felt was right.  Same with the butter.  So delectable!  I will definitely be making this again. ( Its going to be a regular in my grilling-season rotation)

Fantatic.  I've never cooked Chilean Sea Bass and it is an expensive piece of fish so I didn't want to ruin it.  I read this recipe and then the reviews.  I made a few adaptations based on the review.  I had to do the oven instead of the grill and it came out fabulous.

Made as written except doubled the spices and only used 1 pound of fish (so 4X the spice). AMAZING restaurant quality dish, next time I will serve with rice. Also I used black bass caught on our fishing trip. A keeper!

I just L-O-V-E Love this seasoning for fish.  I make extra and keep it handy.  The only change I made from this recipe is to eliminate the butter and add the garlic and parsley before cooking.

I have used the seasoning on many different kinds of fish; the latest was Red Snapper.  My guests all raved and were looking for this recipe on Allrecipes.com the next day.

I don't really cook but have been trying to learn a bit in the last few years.  Had never had Chilean Sea Bass before, but the counter guy at Kroger told me to just search online and I'd find a recipe.  I did not have all the ingredients, but had close enough substitutes.  I used a bit too much butter, but this is the best thing I have ever cooked in my life.  Don't know if this is how it was supposed to taste, but it was awesome.  Thanks!

Very good.  Added dill since I was out of parsley.  I agree w/others to up the seasonings.  Sea Bass is very expensive, but worth it.  It is not something you eat every night.  It is a treat!

We grilled shark for this dish & it turned out really tasty. The recipe is great as is. We drizzled the butter on the fish when we turned it. As long as you don't pour it all over the grill, it does just fine. As far as the lemon pepper goes, we just used the same amount as the other spices. It gave the fish a
wonderful little tang. We can't wait to 
try this with sea bass. Just couldn't find any this time.

Great taste! My husband caught a giant sea bass on Memorial Day, so I had a bunch of fresh fish to oook. He doesn't normally even think of eating fish but he loved this recipe. The only change I made was to drizzle the butter/garlic mixture over the fillets right before turning them. I cooked this on a grill/gridle on the stovetop (set off the smoke alarm, but it worked great!). I served the fish with coconut rice, garlic lemon green beans and homemade coleslaw. I think my husband will be eating fish again in the future with this recipe--I'm guessing it will taste just as great with any type of white meat fish--thanks!

This might well be the best grilled fish recipe ever!  I have made it 3 times and each time it has been delicious.

Excellent recipe, I didn't have any parley so I replaced it with dried oregano and it was great taste, also I used some roasted garlic instead of fresh. I will try it again for sure!

Fabulous!!
I cooked mine under the broiler (to dark to grill) and it was wonderful.  Only substitution was Onion Salt (replacing onion powder and salt) because I was out.

Excellent -- I didn't use as much butter while the fish was on the grill to prevent flare-ups so I drizzled some more on after it was plated and it was still delicious.  Great recipe -- thanks!

Try this.  I loved it and I am not a fish eater.  I grilled a little longer than suggested to get the crispy cust over the tender flakey sea bass.  Make sure you dont walk away from the grill because this is a very oily fish and it will flare up...even before you add the butter.  Definitely adding to my recipe box.

This was ok, needed more garlic i think though. I would also add a tablespoon of black pepper. I served with chopped tomatoes and sweet corn for a light colourful dish.

I loved this recipe. I added cilantro with the parseley and the garlic with the olive oil, and drizzled it over the fish. I served with stir-fried kale, and it was a healthy, YUMMY dish! I love this site. Awesome Dishes!!  :)

Wonderful! I also doubled the spices, and I used Italian seasoning instead of parsley. I also added onion instead of onion flakes, and the onion was delicious. We will make this again for sure!

Great recipe.  I didn't have any fresh parsely or lemon pepper so I added lemon zest to the butter sauce with the juice from a slice of lemon.  I used fresh thyme instead of parsley to the butter sauce.
