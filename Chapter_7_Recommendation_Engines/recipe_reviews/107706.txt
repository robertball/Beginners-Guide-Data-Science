This was great! I used whole wheat pastry flour, and think I will add a little more brown sugar next time. My family loved it, thank you.

I made these into little muffins and my 12 month old son loves them. I really like that they don't have a lot of sugar. Delicious! ;o)

I loved this recipe.  It's like a harvest quick bread, but not the same old zucchini bread.  The citrus zest is a nice touch, but I only jad orange so I don't know what the lemon would have done.  I baked it a little longer to pull out a clean toothpick.  Wonderful, it'll go into my recipe box.  Thanks.

Great bread! I added a tsp. of cloves and a tsp. of vanilla. This does not have alot of sugar which makes it great for those on low sugar diets. Will make a great breakfast bread. Shared a loaf with friends and they raved. Thank you!

I'm frustrated I chose to make this bread because I used a lot of good ingredients that would have tasted much better prepared almost any other way. I added extra spice, vanilla and almond extract and a 1/4 cup extra sugar, and it is still bland. I'm also going to try a sweet cream cheese and hope that I don't have to just throw the loaves away.

Straight out of the oven, it was a little dry, but with only 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 2 Tbsp of butter; it was to be expected. The texture however was spot on (as another reviewer wrote) and as the hours past, it became more moist. This time however I did add Penzey's Cake Spice (instead of straight cinnamon as I had just purchased it and wanted to try it out), which worked out perfectly with the citrus so I will be using that again...I may add another 1/2 tsp. Next time I might add only orange zest and replace the 1/2 cup buttermilk with orange juice (so it would be 1 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup orange juice) Lastly, I might add 1 tsp of vanilla or almond extract...these are just my additional thoughts. Thanks jandeli for posting this recipe and making quick bread a little more healthy!

It's good but something is missing. I even added cloves, extra cinnamon,nutmeg, and some crushed pineapple and they are still pretty bland. They will be fine for my 2 yr old though...

I made these with a few of the suggestions from the reviews (sub applesauce for oil and used egg substitute) and they came out like rubber:(  Not happy at all...

This was really not good. I doubled the sugar. My kids and I thought it was inedible, though the husband thought it was "fine". I suspect the way this recipe tastes must really depend on how your carrots taste, and I think carrots can vary quite a bit. The ones I used were apparently not good.

This recipe needs more flavor.  I was disappointed.  Also needs more sugar.  I am going to try a sweet cream cheese and see if others will like it.

This has NO flavor but perfect texture. If you like white bread, you'll love this. I substituted applesauce for oil, but no one liked it.

This delicious recipe requires only 2 Tbsp margarine/butter for 2 loaves.  Like some other  fruit or spice cake/breads it is MUCH better after a few of days - so it is a great one to make in advance! I substituted orange juice for the buttermilk, and added 1/4 c brown sugar.  I will make it again to give as gifts, and look forward to trying it for muffins.  Thanks jandeli

The orange and lemon zest was a delight, however overall spicing was really mild. Next time I'll add more cinnamon and nutmeg and cloves.

Sadly it was very bland. Great texture but absolutely no flavor.  No one would eat it.  I will try once more and add more nutmeg and cinnamon.

If you use whole wheat flour you will need to add more buttermilk or bread will be too dry.  I used double carrot because  I had no zucchini.  9x5 loaf pans are really too large; I will use my smaller glass pans next time so bread will be taller.
