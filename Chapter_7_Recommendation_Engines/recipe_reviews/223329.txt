Without the brandy, it will taste okay. However, adding brandy gives the Sangria more of a kick and a depth of flavor. I personally wouldn't leave it out (I love adding apricot brandy to this white recipe!), but make it your own! The great thing about recipes is that they are just a starting point.

We found it far more enjoyable when using Pinot Grigio instead of Moscato and cutting back on the peach schnapps, as the schnapps over-powered the drink.  If you do the recipe as written, I recommend a citrusy Fresca or Squirt over Sprite just to 'lift' the drink a little.

Definite crowd pleaser. I made it for a dinner party, and it was received so well it was requested at our next get together. I made 2 batches that were consumed immediately. People loved it so much I had to put together another batch ASAP because it was the only thing anyone wanted to drink.

This was great for our couples Christmas party! I just used strawberries & peaches in mine and made it at bedtime the night before the party & it was fantastic by the time people started showing up at 6:00 pm! Instead of using brandy, we had coconut Malibu rum so we used that & sprite to top it off before serving in the individual glasses! It was a BIG hit & they've already asked me to make it again!

This recipe was delightful, made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it, even the men! I used Jacob's Creek Mascato, it's one of the sweeter Mascato wines, and I used Apricot Brandy,. I will definitely use this again for our next party.

Love this and I get two treats out of it! 
I used 1/2 cup tripe sec and 1/2 cup peach (I don't like it too peachy)
I have used fresh fruit before and I have used a frozen mango/peach/Strawberry/pineapple blend either is fine.
I usually skip the raspberries just because they are pricey and don't add much.
I usually add 1/2 to 1 cup of vodka (plain or a fruity flavor) for more kick, but not necessary or add this later (see below).
Mix all but one bottle of wine and soda (especially if using fizzy wine) the day before then add last bottle and soda just before serving. Important that these flavors have time to marry.
I have used a mixture of bottles of chardonnay and Moscato (I did this at graduation) slightly less sweet all are good. :)
And finally, when the Sangria is gone and you have a bunch of yummy boozy fruit left. puree it in the blender with a little more liquor (vodka or brandy), freeze it, then when you want a "special" adult slush, spoon it into a rocks glass, add some sprite, and Voila! A whole other treat.

Great great great sangria. Definitely a crowd pleaser. Served it as party punch for 4th of July cookout and had people come over the next day for leftovers. Was very disappointed when I had to tell them it was all gone. Definitely a keeper for parties and gatherings in the future.

I cut the recipe in half because I did not have a pitcher big enough for it!  This sangria lasts at least 10 days, and gets better as it ages!  It is so yummy!!  I mixed pink moscato with a niagra for the most recent batch..... so amazing!  Best sangria I have had.  I will try some dryer wines next batch....just because I am watching my sugar intake.

No raspberries as they clog my dispenser.  Used a bag of frozen mango chunks in lieu of fresh and they were AMAZING all liquored up.  I also added a frozen limeade concentrate as that one ingredient has stuck with me from previous sangria recipes.  Topped off with Fresca before serving.  Sooo good!

This was a big hit. I used a Savignon Blanc instead of Moscato and scaled back a bit on the Sprite. It was delish!

This sangria is delicious! I have tried several different white sangria recipes but this is now the only one I make. Made it for several parties & there were only drops left.Can make it with all the fruit listed or with just what you have on hand. The peaches are a must however.

This is a great basic recipe anyone can make their own. For ex, I started with one bottle of Moscato and used 1/4 c apricot brandy and 1/4 c peach schnapps. I made so many batches that I made slightly different versions each time -- Sprite/Fresca  or frozen mango w fresh fruits. Each version was a hit!

Huge crowd pleaser. Skipped the sprite and substituted peach vodka for the schnapps.  Prep was 15 minutes. It was all gone in about 45. I agree with the other commenter about the brandy (or other dark): don't skip it, it gives a nice spice to the sweet.

I left the brandy out as I'm not a fan of brandy.  I also used frozen fresh fruit to make the sangria cold without watering it down and it worked like a charm.  Delicious and refreshing!

I follow the receipt but I used Paul Masson peach and pineapple brandy and I also used a lil bird dog peach whiskey and a splash of Sweet revenge and ginger ale instead of sprite!!! I made it the first time for Thanksgiving and my family LOVED IT! This is a must for EVERY get together.

Refreshing summer drink. I only had pinot grigio and it was good - plenty sweet. Recommend following other reviewers' advice and adding a large splash of Sprite to each glass so it doesn't go flat. Beautiful presentation with all the fruit. Don't skip the brandy. I upped the amount  a touch and it was perfect.

This is my first review that I am writing on here. And, I'm only doing it because this sangria was a HIT at a bridal shower I went to.  Everyone raved about how good it was. I also brought a store bought red sangria, but no one touched it because they were too busy drinking this peach sangria. This will definitely be my go-to drink for parties from now on. FYI: I didn't necessarily follow the measurements in the recipe; I just made to taste preferences.

I made this for my superbowl party.  It was a huge hit.  It has a nice peach flavor with a little kick from the brandy.  Yummy!  I also added some sliced lime and lemon and it added a little extra color and flavor.

I made this sangria following the recipe verbatim. I am not a fan of wine but most of my guests enjoy it so I thought I would try this. It was a huge hit. Everyone raved about it and had to have the recipe. I am shocked to say that I loved it!  My friend's daughter is getting married in a simple, outdoors wedding and I am going to make several gallons of this to share with her guests.

I served this two nights ago and it was delicious!!  Sweet--just how I like it, and fruity.  I didn't have strawberries so I added sliced plums.  Yummmmy.

I replaced the brandy with white rum since that's what I had, and used plain soda instead of flavored soda to make it less sweet. It tasted great and everyone loved it!

This white peach sangria was absolutely amazing! Instead of regular brandy, I added peach brandy and it came out absolutely great! This sangria was definitely a huge hit at my party! Will be adding this to my summer must haves!

Super delicious! Had to use cognac instead of brandy because that is what I had handy and I didn't want to run to the store, it was a huge hit at our party.

I always run out and the dispenser is in the air while the last few guests are trying to get the last drop. It’s a big hit.

I used 2 bottles of moscato, 1/2 cup of peach brandy, and 1/4 cup peach schnapps. It was a big hit!

This was delicious and loved by all. I made a couple changes. I used apricot brandy and Pinot Grigio.   It is a very versatile sangria and could be changed to your taste.

This tastes like summer in your mouth! Especially great for an outdoor party! It was delicious. I didn’t use the full measure of peach schnapps based on other reviews. And just upped my fresh peaches. This was a big hit. Definitely a keeper.

This is a great summer party drink! Everyone that tried it loved it, the best part was after it was done, everybody gets to eat all the leftover fruit. It was the first real drink I ever made and it was super easy and fun to do.

This was a huge hit at my house warming last year and friends still talk about it.  I am making it to serve at a party tomorrow but this time I puréed all of the fruit (strained the raspberry seeds out) and have it dived into 4 pitchers.  I will freeze one and use it in the dispenser to keep the whole thing cool for the afternoon.  It already smells fabulous!
