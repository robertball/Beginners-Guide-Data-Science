I don't usually rate recipes, but felt this one was rated too low. I've made it several times, and refill my 'Smucker's Sundae Syrup' bottle. No one knows the difference, and it is a lot more economical! I follow the recipe exactly, but only simmer for about 3 minutes, and it is thick enough. Perfect amount of chocolate and sweetness.

I loved this chocolate sauce....deep, rich fudgy flavor and a beautiful, silky texture. It was thick enough to coat a spoon and then some! Being also quick and simple to put together, makes it a keeper in my book.

nice flavour, not too sweet, needed more milk for a pouring consistency. Slightly gelatinous texture, one of my kids disliked. Not the best sauce I've had, sauce tended to form a skin due to milk content, however easy to make from store cupboard ingredients .

The flavor is wonderful, rich and chocolately but if I had followed the instructions I would have had a loose pudding.  I never brought the heat higher than medium-low and reduced it as low as I could as soon as it came to a simmer.  I doubt I cooked this for more than 4 minutes and it is really a bit thicker than I would prefer.  I am already thinking of dark chocolate powder and perhaps less flour for the next time.  Thanks, Chef John!

Just made this sauce and love it! SO easy, had all ingredients in pantry! Rich chocolate taste, creamy, only thing I changed was simmering time. Took it from 6 minutes down to about 4 because it was thick and I didn't want to scorch it. Still turned out great!

I usually make Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce, but decided to try this one tonight. I'm torn because I like Sue's is better, yet it calls for 1/2 cup butter and this one only uses 2 TBS. I'm not concerned about calories, so I'll probably continue to use Sue's, but this was quite good.

I let the sauce cool down a few minutes before adding the vanilla extract at the end.  High heat destroys some of the subtle vanilla flavors.  I LOVE this sauce, heated about 25 seconds in the microwave, over Vanilla Ice Cream - Blue Bell, of course!  Add a small handful of toasted pecans, very lightly salted and roughly chopped, and you have a Hot Chocolate Pecan Sundae that's to die for!

Very easy to make and it reminded me of my Grandmother's homemade chocolate sauce. This is definitely a keeper.

I made this after seeing it under the new reviews and really craving chocolate. I read the reviews first and one person that makes it all the time said it only needed 3 minutes of simmering. I made 1/2 recipe and only simmered for at most 2 minutes. After the milk began to boil, I turned it down to low or 3 on my stove for about a minute whisking and then on off and continued to whisk another 30 seconds to 1 minute instead of turning the stove to medium-high. I have found over cooking stuff like this can cause grittiness or other issues. Although, this tasted fine it honestly reminded me much more of chocolate gravy from this site than the rich, thick, and creamy chocolate dessert toppings I have made.

I think the suggestion of medium high heat is too high (for my stove at least). This sauce looked like pudding when I followed the directions. I quickly added some extra milk and butter to turn it back into a sauce. It tastes pretty good. I added some orange zest and a small amount of fresh orange juice because I made it to go in a cocktail.

Just made this tonight and it turned out pretty good.  I must admit that I think that will add a little more sugar next time.  Delicious!

If you didn't make the recepie the way stated, stop giving it five stars. If it was a five star recepie you wouldn't have had to change it. This is gelatinous. Reviews state to cook it differently and alter the ingredients. People putting five stars when you needed to make significant alterations should be shot

Oh my goodness! I honestly have to say that this is WAY better than the store bought stuff. So creamy and tastes like fudge. Not too sweet and rich with chocolatey flavor.  I would make this time and time again. Amazing recipe!

I used corn starch instead of flour to make it gluten free (use half as much flour called for) and also used Hershey's Dark Cocoa which is about twice as "strong" and only needed half as much of that, too.  It did turn out quite thick as others have mentioned but it does thin easily with a little added milk.  I used this for both an ice cream topping and for a base for making hot cocoa (adding a little cinnamon to give it a Mexican flavor).

I found the consistency of this unpleasantly gelatinous, and it wasn't quite sweet enough either. I'll be going back to Sue's Hot Fudge Sauce, also on this site.

It was Ok. Mild flavor (I had to add more sugar- 1 tbs) and I agree with the comment below, it was somewhat 'gelatinous' in consistency. I guess it depends on what you like.

I think I might have over cooked it.  I added another 1/2 cup of milk to thin it out and I did only a 1/2 cup sugar.

Being a novice in the kitchen, this recipe was really straight forward and easy to follow. I went with a suggestion from one of the previous reviews with not going higher than medium low heat and stirring only for 4 minutes. I LOVE how it tastes!

This stuff is delicious! The kicker was when my kids said it made the best chocolate milk ever. Makes the Hershey’s store bought (chocolate flavoured HF corn syrup) stuff completely obsolete! Super quick and easy to make. Definitely a keeper.

I made this by the recipe.  The taste and texture are very much like chocolate gravy and very little like chocolate sauce or syrup.  This is no doubt due to the flour in the recipe.  I should have known better.

This is the easiest, most amazing chocolate sauce I have ever tasted!! One batch fills 2 Mason jars! I keep one and gift the other. I have used this on ice cream, Boston cream pie, made chocolate cream pie with it, crepes....the possibilities are truly endless!

Good flavor, but it was *very* thick, a lot like a rich pudding. Add more milk or cook for less time to fix this

I’ve made this recipe a few times now, and I love it. However, the previous times I made it, it was coming out rather chunky...I made it again tonight and realized I’d had the burner on too high, and that was what was making it come out that way. So I put it on a lower temperature, and low and behold it came out nice and smooth~ Tonight, I poured a bunch on a Klondike bar, and it was delicious.

Has a pudding -like texture. I liked that this particular variety wasn't as heavy on fat as some other hot fudge/chocolate sauce recipes.  Satisfied  my craving for chocolate to go over ice cream.

Great. Thick consistency and sweet enough (not too sweet). Works really well in coffee, actually.

Like a thick fudge, but not much flavor.  The flour is thickening it instead of chocolate.  Not the greatest.

Oh my gosh.....this is so creamy, delicious and decadent! And that's just from eating it out of the pan! I can't wait to try it on ice cream or whatever. I scaled it down to 8 servings (1 cup of milk). I used the Special Dark version of the cocoa, with wonderful results. I lowered the heat  to med-low after ingredients were mixed in, and let it simmer 3 min, and it was nice and thick. I followed Daniel's advice of letting the mixture cool (~ 5 min) before adding the vanilla, for better flavor. I would prefer not to know anything about calories either......haha!  Thanks Chef John....this is surely better than any store-bought sauce.

From my experience, I ended up halving all the quantities listed as a test batch, and I am glad to say, successful! Followed the recipe exactly, ended up with a nice, rich, smooth, semi-sweet, chocolatey syrup. Surprisingly simple to make. To anyone attempting this, I found that the cooking time is dependent on thickness desired. The six minutes suggested in the recipe results in a thicker syrup. For best results, I highly recommend good quality, unsweetened CACAO powder. (Not to be mistaken with cocoa). Great recipe!

If I could only give 10 stars.  I used this "sauce" on the Mint Chocolate brownies because it's the summer- but OMG- applying this sauce to those brownies- what????!!!!!
Also- the brownies on the second day:  The frost had fluffed a little so they seemed even more decadent.  Diet frosting next time- thanks

Took under 10 mins, so simple and sooooooo good!
I need it fairly pourable so I added more Milk to the end result and cooked for a further minute or two.

This is the weirdest chocolate sauce I’ve ever made!!! It’s wayyyy too thick and has a gluey texture, almost solid! It’s a little grainy too. I think this is all because of the flour. Never making again

Made to drizzle over donuts as a Birthday Cake for a 13 year old girl. Used salted caramel extract instead of vanilla. Thought it looked a bit thin but once poured it thickened to just right consistency. Tasted amazing and rich but not sickly. Will make again! Thanks for recipe.

Thank you for this recipe. As a fraternity chef I am trying to spoil my boys a little as  they study for finals. I wanted to make sundaes but the tiny fudge sauce jars are costly and I needed to serve around 35.  I bought Hershey's Special Dark Coaco, used a pinch of brown sugar and substituted a little cream because I had some left over. They loved it! The next day they were eating it like fudge!

I was a little disappointed in the texture of the chocolate sauce.  It did seem a bit gelatinous and I wonder if that is due to the flour. I followed the directions to the letter.  I will try it again and hope that it turns out better.
Update: 3/22/2017   I warmed up the above mentioned chocolate sauce in the microwave for a minute, stirred in a bit more milk and then the sauce was perfect. I chose this recipe over some others because it did not require as much sugar as the others and I liked that.  I used dark cocoa powder and it was still sweet enough for me.  Next time, I may cook it for four minutes (instead of the six) as others suggested.  It is now rated FIVE STARS. Thanks John

This is easy and pretty good. I might add a touch more sugar next time. 
When the recipe says to simmer for 6 minutes, they mean it. At 5 minutes, (starting from when the butter was melted), I thought it would be too thin, but the thickness was perfect.

Followed the recipe to the t.  (But only made half) It was perfect. Thick and delicious. My 11 year old did most of the leg work. It was easy and delicious!  This will be our go to chocolate sauce.

This was perfect. And way better than anything store bought. I find it's ok to  add a little less sugar, but that's just personal taste.

Brilliant recipe will defiantly be using again. There was one thing I changed just because I had none in cupboard but I switched Coco powder for drinking chocolate and I used full fat milk.  When it was cooled down  it  tasted like a well know chocolate brand moose pot  which  you sprinkle  chocolate of flake into. Everyone's probably going to say wasn't it sweet using drinking chocolate, for my taste it was perfect but you could just use less sugar. Very easy and quick ??

Made it, but I never did any cooking beyond melting the butter. If I want it hot I'll just throw it in a pan. Very good, rich in flavour the butter is very pronounced! I'm never going to buy store bought stuff again!

Simple ingredients to make a delightful chocolatey flavor. I whisked it for the full simmering time, and it came out beautifully smooth.

 Following some review advice, I added a bit of milk after cooking to make it a little thinner for drizzle consistency. 

I really wanted strawberries with a chocolate sauce, and this worked splendidly!

Did this with milo instead just because it was on hand, came out great! I also made a little thicker as it was to dip biscotti in.

Loved this chocolate sauce....deep, rich fudgy flavor and a beautiful, silky texture.  Being also quick and simple to put together. I am surprised at all the failures with this recipe.  The directions were exact, it also helps to watch Chef Johns video prior to making this. As sauce cooled it became a bit too thick so I added some milk until it was the consistency I wanted. At this point you might consider adding additional flavorings.

I followed the recipe exactly. Within seconds of cooking, this became a gelatinous blob. I then put back on burner and added additional milk. It is still pudding like ... not at all a syrup. The flavor is not that great either.

I've made this recipe twice now, both times to accompany ice cream cake.  Counter to many suggestions, I recommend actually decreasing the sugar to 1/2 cup if you're going to use it for something that's already super sweet (like ice cream cake).  I also decreased the time, as many others suggested, and that made the sauce harden to a shell-like consistency in the freezer.  (The first time I made it, I boiled it for the entire 6 minutes and found that it did stay pretty sticky.)  Anyway, the equal parts of cocoa and sugar gave the sauce a more "dark chocolate" taste that was a good contrast to the ice cream.  Just a suggestion, if you are into that kind of thing.

Ok flavor. Too thick so I added more milk. It's almost like pudding. Not what I was expecting. The flour made weird blobs in it that never quite seemed to dissolve. If you're looking for lumpy pudding, this is your recipe.

Though this thickened up way too much, once I reheated it and mixed in some more milk, it was fine.  The flavor is wonderful!
