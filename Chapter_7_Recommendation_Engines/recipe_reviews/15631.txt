This is an amazing recipe.  The cheese doesn't melt completly, but i don't think it should.  Pictures or more detail about how it should look are not needed, just be creative.  The dessert was delicious, can't beat it.  No complaints!

This is an excellent recipe.  I took it to a BBQ that had TONS of food and after everybody ate their main meal they still finished this off...nothing left but crumbs!   Lots of compliments.   And I like how versital it is, you can substitute other pie filling flavors for variety.

Cheese shreds didn't melt and less flour in topping would have improved. I'd like to try with cherry pie filling next time.

Great Recipe!!! Everyone loved this and I only had to make a few minor adjustments to the instructions. I actually doubled the recipe for the crust since the first batch wasn't enough to cover the 12" pizza pan.I baked the crust for an additional 5 minutes since it was a bit thicker than intended and I also only used 1/2 cup of flour for the cheese/sugar/cinnamon mixture. Overall a VERY good recipe - very tasty and I was amazed that the cheese didn't melt also. It kind of became crunchy instead.

This was a hit every time I have made it.  One thing that I have done to add to the richness of the topping is add small dots of butter.  This melts into the topping and gives it a delicious flavor.  The crust does come up a bit short so I have doubled the recipe to give it a bit more thickness.  This is a really easy and delicious recipe.

I give this recipe  a 5 star it is easy to make and yummy too. Instead of canned pie filling, I make my own apple pie filling and for the crust as advised  by others, I double it up and I get 2 8' pie. For the topping it was really amazing. My 5 yrs old boy really love this and so are the rest and I can't stop thinking of doing again soon.

the cheese doesnt melt and the taste of the plain flour with brown sugar is horribly disgusting.. the crust is too thin and it breaks up very easily.

My husband has always like cheddar cheese with his apple pie, so thought he would like this (he DID).  I don't care for canned fillings, so made my own, using 5 med. sized Granny Smith apples. I got distracted, while making the crust, and put the butter, sugar and flour in the bowl together. Rather than dump it out and start over, I mixed it that way and ended up having to add a couple tablespoons water to get the dough to hold together. Was worried it would be tough, but turned out tender and good. I'll try it the right way next time and see what the difference is. Also, next time, I will only use a 1/4 cup or so of the flour in the cheese and brown sugar mixture -- 3/4 cup was way too much. I'm sure the cheese is not SUPPOSED to melt.  A good, DIFFERENT recipe -- thanks.

I as well had problems with the dough not being enough for a 12" pizza pan. I made another batch of the dough. I also would have liked to see what it should look like. I used Kraft shredded cheddar cheese and it didn't melt at all.

I made my own apple pie filling from an allrecipes recipe. My prayer group and the husbands loved it and wanted the recipe. It's a keeper.

I just made a similar pizza today with the exact same crust so I have some advice for the people saying to double the crust - it's not necessary!!  Don't sift the flour for starters -you get too much air in it.  Mix the ingredients thoroughly - it can be done with a spatula - but not to form a ball.  It will be crumbly, and that's okay.  Lightly spread the crumbs on your pan, then pack it down with your hand, shaping the edge as you go.  If it is a little sticky, cover it with plastic wrap, then smooth it with your hand - less messy.  (the 5 star rating is for the crust only - I haven't made the pizza this way)

They're right- it does sound a little strange.  The best part about it was how differnt it was, not necessarily the taste.  Next time I would use a homemade apple filling and I think it would make a world of differnce.

My daughter made this for her Girl Scout troop and it was a huge hit...we used half apple half raspberry like another person wrote in her review.
***I have noticed that when you buy preshreded cheese, there is a powdery type flour coat on it to keep the pieces from sticking together. That might be why the cheese isn't melting for some people. Try shredding cheese from a block of cheese and see if that helps.

I had to add some water to crust because it was too crumbly. I used homemade pie filling. I used less flour like other people. I used shredded cheddar/mozza. I only cooked for 20 mins., but it was overcooked. Next time I will decrease oven temperature.

Forewarned by others, I doubled the crust recipe.  Came out great.  I've made it 3 times now and both my husband and I love it.  Thanks for a great easy to make treat or dessert.

I tried this recipies and I wasn't too impressed. The crust wasn't enough for the filling and the topping didn't set well. The cheese didn't melt like it should have.

This would have been good if the crust didn't have to be precooked.  Cooking the second time caused the bottom to burn before the cheese was melted.

I made this recipe with half apple filling and the other half raspberry filling.  (The store only had 1 can of apple pie filling left).  It was WONDERFUL.  My kids and husband thought it was tasty, too!

While the recipe itself was very tasty, my crust didn't even come close to filling out a 12" pizza pan, and I thought the cheese would melt (it didn't at all).  A few more tips from the cook as to appearance would have been helpful.

I would have given this 5 stars but the cheese not melting was a big let down for me. 

As others have said the crust is NOT big enough for a 12" pan. Next time I will double the crust recipe. 

I used my own canned apple pie filling. 

I followed the recipe on amounts of flour br sugar and cheese. I will decrease amount of flour and use just enough cheese to top the pie with. 

The apple pie flavor is good and I liked the crust flavor too. 

I will make it again. Love to bake this in the fall and enjoy the smells of the season!
