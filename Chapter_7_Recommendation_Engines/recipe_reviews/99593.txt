I changed this recipe around a bit.  I cooked the whole thing in the crockpot for about 7 hours and it was delicious.  I used 4 chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I went heavy on the Worchestshire sauce and only used 2 tablespoons of ketchup. Turned out great!

My grandmother used to make this when I was younger, and then I found this exact recipe in a cookbook I bought so I decided to try it. It came out great, and my husband and roommate absolutely LOVED it! Both went back for seconds, and they were skeptical about it at first.

I believe the reason one user said that it still "tasted like coke and chicken" was they didn't mix it well enough before pouring it on the chicken. Its a great dish, and so easy to make.

This was one of my favorite dishes as a kid.  My family has made a few adjutments to the recipe over the years... 
1/4 C. worc. 
3/4 C. ketchup
10 oz. Cola (regular - we never had good luck with the diet or flavored kinds)
I often double or even triple the sauce and then serve over mashed potatoes. Cooking covered with foil for the first hour will help keep your chicken from drying out.

I made this and thought it tasted like chicken in coke and ketchup.  The flavors didn't blend well or magically change into something tasty.  I recommend you keep looking for another chicken recipe.

Like other cooks, I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs as well as boneless breast.  I browned the chicken, mixed the sauce, then cooked, uncovered, in a 300 oven 2 hours.  I then removed the chicken and thickened the sauce on the stovetop (in same pan)with a little cornstarch.  We loved it!

We made this with 3 Chicken Breasts , bone and skin on, in the Crock Pot all day on low. Less ketchup, more Worcestershire made it a little less tangy than traditional BBQ flavor which tends to assault the senses a tad. We also added a barbecue rub and garlic salt for a little seasoning. It all ended up falling off the bone nicely, very moist! I recommend this as an alternative to traditional BBQ Chicken.

Hubby made this tonight and we really liked it.  My very picky son ate every bite.  Not sure how someone got dry chicken out of this.  Mine was so moist I was able to cut it with my fork.

This recipe is awesome :) A nifty alternative, is to energize it a little bit, and replace cola flavored pop with Jolt Cola's cola flavored energy drink.

This was so easy! I really liked this good tasting, easy to make chicken. I made gravy out of the drippings which turned out nice. I made no changes other than cooking it in a slow cooker. Thanks so much!

Great recipe! 
Chicken came out very juicy, with great flavor. Added a little Adoba to my chicken before hand :) served over rice with a veggie. Big hit with my picky eater too.

This recipe was just ok.  It took way longer than 50 minutes for our chicken to cook and the flavor really didn't permeate the chicken.  Ended up taking the foil off after the 50 minutes and increasing the oven temperature and there was still too much liquid to give it a nice caramelized finish like the picture shows.  The sauce was very good made into a gravy though.  I'll probably do that again but actually cook the chicken differently.

This was OK...nothing I was blown away by.  I only baked it for closer to 35 minutes and the chicken was perfectly done (and very moist).  I haven't decided if I'll make this again; I like that's it low fat / low cal and easy to put together, but then again, so is just a plain baked chicken breast...

This was easy to put together and turned out a dish that my husband enjoyed. For me it was okay but bland and plain and the sauce was watery. I used bone in skin on chicken breasts and since they were huge I baked this a bit longer than an hour. I do plan on fixing this again only simmering the sauce a while to thicken it a bit first. This had a mild barbecue flavor and it's quite a decent recipe and simply needs a little tweaking to make it grand. I think I'd personally prefer this in the crockpot and then shred the chieken and serve it as bbq on a bun instead. My husband was quite satisfied with this as it is.

This was a very bland dish.  The cola mixture didn't stay on the chicken or get into the chicken.  My kids didn't like it either.  We won't be making this again.

My 3 boys are not big meat eaters.  Trying to get them to eat protein can be tricky, but this recipe was a HIT for ALL 3 of them!  They actually asked for more! I will definitely make this again!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I did everything as directed EXCEPT I cooked my chicken thighs and sauce in the crockpot on high for 4 hours removed brushed with bbq sauce and put them under the broiler for a few minutes till the sauce got bubbly. Husband declared them delish! Next time I'll have to use more chicken we picked every last morsel!

Went right along with the recipe. Tasted like bbq chicken you really don't taste the cola. Something different to try with chicken and it was pretty good.

Amazingly, I have used this same recipe exactly as Mom did back in the 1950s.  I liked it then. I use it often as is in a Dutch oven with legs over the campfire coals while camping and in a stove top Dutch Oven when I am at home.  It works for me, and I hear no complaints, just accolades!  And yes, it works fantastically in a slow cooker on low all day!

The original recipe is from Coca-Cola Co. Which is still the best one. This recipe was too bland; needed onion, celery, chili powder. The thing is, when one uses boneless, skinless chicken it dries out or falls apart.

Why is the sauce so thin, I made it first with bone in skin on too greasey, watery sauce;
Made it with boneless, skinless breasts, sauce still watery?

Hardly had any flavor and it was boring, tried dipping the chicken in the sauce and it tasted like tomato soup.

Made recipe exactly as stated. It was very bland as no flavor had cooked into the chicken even though it was covered in the mixture. Will not make again or even try to experiment to make it better.

This has been a favorite of our family for many years and the sauce is great served over rice or potatoes.

Ingredients are easy to have in your cupboard, quick to put together and the result is moist tasty chicken you can cut with the edge of your fork.  I choose a oven pan that goes in my dishwasher. I baked potatoes along side of the chicken and clean up was a quick with no pots or pans to wash by hand. I kept the leftover sauce - boiled it -and will try it with another meat.
