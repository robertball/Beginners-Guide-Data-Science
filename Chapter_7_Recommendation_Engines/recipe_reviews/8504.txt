Edible but not special at all.  The milk & soup mixture tasted very fake.  If I ever make this again I will top with real cheese and sour cream and add a lot more spices.

I've made this recipe over and over again, and it keeps getting better each time.  I've shared the recipe with friends and they say the same thing- delicious!!  It's the one dinner I've made that actually came out the way I hoped.  Thanks for a great recipe that will always be one of my favorites!

This recipe is so good...I used red enchilada sauce mixed with the cheese soup to pour over the top to add more flavor.  I also doubled the recipe for company and it made a nice presentation with the olives on top!  This is a keeper for sure!

Not being a fan of using canned soups as sauces, I didn't think this was going to work as well as it did.  I sprinkled some shredded jalapeno jack cheese over the soup mix and browned it; gave it a little extra zest.

These were good, but they didn't have as much flavor as other recipes.  I will try a spicier salsa next time.

Overall a great dish. I give it 3.5 stars for taste (good for kids, grown-ups added hot sauce), but 5+ stars for ease of assembly, ingredients and quickness for when you have a screaming toddler hanging on your legs!

Don't think I'll make this again. The filling was good, but the cheese soup just doesn't do it for me. I think next time I'll just use shredded cheese and enchilada sauce for a more traditional dish.

Easy to make.  I think next time I will add a little velveeta to the cheese sauce and add some more spices.  Overall I thought it was pretty good.

I was a little hesitant about this recipe at first. As written it sounds a bit bland. But it proved to be an excellent base to start with. I used fiesta cheese soup and added about a Tbsp of taco seasoning along with about 1/4 of the can of green chiles. I also topped the dish off with 1 cup of reduced fat cheese. I decreased the milk to 1/4 cup as well. This turned out to be a good balance of mild vs spicy to accomodate my 8 y/o who doesnt like things too hot. If he werent eating with us, I would have added more taco seasoning and perhaps some spicy traditional enchilada sauce. All in all this was a very good, super quick meal.

Very simple and good.  I made a couple of changes.  I substituted 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup beer instead of the milk.  I also only had cheese soup so I added a 1/2 package of taco seasoning. I used 8 burrito sized tortillas rolled up and baked covered in a 9x13 for 30 and added Moz cheese and cooked 10 more min.

I am so impressed with myself that I actually made not just Mexican food but yummy Mexican food.  :)  These are great and FAST!  I added some things that I just happened to have in the pantry like enchilada sauce and refried beans and we had a yummy dinner.  Texan husband liked these too!  (Try the Oaxacan Tacos Submitted by: Lola on allrecipes!!)

I was surprised how great these came out! I thought the cheese soup and salsa would taste very fake, but I was wrong. I had cheddar cheese soup, and added a salsa seasoning packet to it. I used generic store brand mild salsa, and added chopped onion to the filling along with the green chiles. I used small flour tortillas and came out with about 15 enchiladas. I used the cheese sauce, shredded cheese, and black olives on top. Everyone loved it.

Not the standard Enchiladas, but very easy and not bad to the taste. Probably, child friendly without any hot salsa. Thanks for the Recipe!

I'm sorry, but we really didn't enjoy it, mostly because of the texure.  The filling and flavors were good, but the cheese soup mixture made the tortillas sticky and gooey.  I might recommend not baking the enchiladas WITH the soup mixture, and instead pouring it on (heated separately) right before serving.

It tasted good to me. It wasn't a big hit with my family though.  They can be kind of picky. I didn't have Nacho Cheese soup so I used Nacho cheese from a can. Pretty much the same thing. It seemed a little dry.  Probably won't make it again but not really that bad.

This is a pretty good recipe, especially for a cooking novice like myself. However, I like traditional enchilada sauce on top and a little in the filling mix.

We just weren't thrilled with the nacho cheese on the enchiladas, so I made this again last week using the White Cheese Sauce from this site.

I really enjoyed making this dish. It was the first time making and eating enchiladas. lol (ya I know) I think they turned out fantastic. I made a few changes. I added a can of diced tomatoes mixed with green onion peppers and celery ( I didnt have salsa) and I mixed it with chilli sauce and added the green chillies in. The rest was followed as shown. But it was nice and spicy and my 11 yr old 5 yr old and even my 14 month old, loved them.

I need to use real cheese on top. Plus the photo calls for black olives yet it is not listed. Probably won't make again.

It kind of bugs me (a lot) when I see reviewers dramatically changing a recipe before they even give it a chance...Well tonight, I became the person that annoys me. 

I did not use nacho cheese soup, because that did not sound appealing to me, but my sour cream expired, so my goto recipe was impossible to use. My lazy a** was not driving to the store tonight. I used a can of reduced fat cream of celery, half a packet of enchilada sauce mix, a cup of fat free shredded sharp cheddar, and a cup 1/2 of fat free milk.  I also added green onions because it felt like the right thing to do. 

I'm really against canned green chilies, so I used a leftover veggie quesadilla mixture of salsa, black beans, corn, green, yellow, and red peppers I had in the fridge to coat the chicken. I followed a 4 to 2 spoonful ratio to fill the tortillas, poured the rest on top with an additional half cup of cheddar.  I think my version is fantastical. Although, next time I'll use corn tortilla. I baked them for exactly 27 minutes, which again, just felt right : )

Loved these!  Very easy and flavorful!  My husband does not like things too spicy so this was just right!  Used the recipe for white cheese sauce to pour over it like some had suggested!

This recipe didn't sound all that appealing but it was quite delicious!  I added a teaspoon of chili powder to the soup/milk mixture and then added some cheddar cheese to the top while baking.  Very quick and easy and quite yummy.  The husband liked it...and that says a lot!

Personally I would have added a lot more if I had the ingredients available, but for those on a tight budget or who need a quick meal for a large crowd, I would definitely recommend this.

Spoon into tortillas. Roll tight Place side by side in greased casserole dish. Top enchiladas with rest of small bowl mix and cheddar cheese and drizzle more enchilada sauce on top Garnish with olives and serve with sour cream .

I have made this many times. It is a family favorite. I added a little chili powder and I use shredded cheese both in and on top of enchiladas. I garnish with olives, sour cream and guacamole. Always make double batch so we have left overs for lunch....Yummy.

Not my favorite chicken enchilada recipe but it takes half the time so when time is short I really appreciate having a quick fix meal.
