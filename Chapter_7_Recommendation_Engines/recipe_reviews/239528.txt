I flip-flopped the baking powder/baking soda amounts and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. After mixing this batter up, I let it sit for about ten minutes (maybe more) before ladling it onto the hot griddle. AMAZING PANCAKES. They turned out GORGEOUS. Like something you would see on the front of a food magazine. And the flavor is JUST LIKE OATMEAL COOKIES. As soon as I finished making these, I wrote this down on a notecard and put it in my permanent recipe file. Good job, jasper33!

Sarah Jo brought these to my attention and I'm so glad she did; they are delicious!  I halved the recipe (though I still used an entire egg) and used Sarah's tip to add a splash of vanilla extract.  I did not use nutmeg and used all 1% milk as we didn't have buttermilk.  I did need to add a bit more flour as the batter seemed a tad runny to me.  We didn't have raisins (which was fine by me :) ), but Mr. LTH would enjoy them even more with raisins next time, I'm sure.  I also chose to leave the oatmeal unground, as I like that added texture.  Great pancakes; thanks for the recipe!

These pancakes are both decadent and healthy! Very impressive. They are very good with unground oats. I also doubled the spices and used more brown sugar than white, plus a little extra for sweeter pancakes. They get nice and fluffy!

It's so nice when something good for you also tastes so good! Like others, I added a splash of vanilla. I was also very heavy-handed with the spices. I didn't have buttermilk so I did the 1 T. vinegar per cup of milk substitution trick, and it was fine. The batter looked very runny, but the pancakes came out delicate and crisp.They aren't very sweet but maple syrup took care of that.This recipe makes enough for a small crowd.

This is the recipe!!! I have tried a few and this has the best flavor. I also added a splash of vanilla and some blueberries. Yum! Great with a simple blueberry reduction and fresh whipped cream. To get a really nice pancake I now, microwave the oats and milk for one minute. Let it sit for a few minutes then pulse with a hand blender.
