This is a wonderful recipe. I cook for a crowd (80 people ish) weekly and this is by far a favorite. I tweak a few things for more flavor however. Instead of flour I use Masa, instead of plain tomatoes I use Salsa and Ro-tel. And I add (based on how spicy you like it) crushed chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. This adds more flavor, makes it thicker, and gives it heat.

I had to adjust this as I went along, but it turned out very well.  I didn’t have no-salt-added tomatoes or reduced sodium chicken broth, so I used 3-10 oz. cans of Rotel and regular chicken broth.  I also used more onion (2/3 cup chopped).  I was concerned that the full package of taco seasoning would make this too salty, so I only used about half the package.  Well, it was still too salty, so I improvised by adding a half cup of heavy cream to diminish the saltiness somewhat.   Seemed to work out just fine.  The Rotel gave this some great flavor and a nice amount of heat.  Next time I might thicken this with a little corn starch to give it a little more body.

Love this soup!  Creamy and not too spicy.  I did add diced red peppers, celery & carrots with the onions but only because I like veggies.

A soup that my family really enjoyed and liked even better the second day.  I only had Queso Blanco Velveeta®, so that is what I had to use.  I had a small amount of leftover corn in the fridge, so I added that also.  A rotisserie chicken made this soup come together quickly.  I served this the tortilla chips and the lime.  I think the lime adds a lot to this recipe – don’t omit it.  My husband also added a healthy dose of hot salsa to his.  The next time I make this, I would like to try it with the Mexican Velveet®.

This was just what I was looking for and it was so easy.  I didn't have pre-cooked chicken so I added it with the tomatoes and broth to let it cook.  I also added a can of corn, a can of beans and a can of tomatoes with chiles for extra spice. Once the chicken was cooked, I removed it and shredded it before adding it back with the cheese.  I was impressed with how good this tasted in such a short amount of time. It's a keeper!

I would make this as a dip rather than a soup. It was very thick and all velveeta. Maybe add more chicken broth and less cheese? Next time!

Super easy and yummy, simple to adjust to your own taste.  We've made this many times now and found we prefer to double the recipe for four people b/c it's so popular!  When doubling I use one whole onion, still only one packet of taco seasoning, two cans Rotel (one regular and one mild), and three chicken breasts.

Just made this! I also added about a 1/2 cup of corn and 1/2 can of diced green chilis. I topped it with shredded cheese and a bit of sour cream. This was delicious! The seasoning from the taco seasoning packet was perfect! Mine turned out nice and creamy:) yum!!!

Great soup! I followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out very good. The only thing I did different was to use a lot more onion (I accidentally chopped too much and didn't want to waste it) and use Rotel in place of the canned tomatoes as another reviewer suggested. Both changes added a lot of flavor and gave it the perfect amount of heat. I have made this twice and both times turned out perfect!

Love this stuff. Instead of chicken, I use browned ground beef, and I use my own taco seasoning mix, but otherwise I follow the recipe. It’s pretty good with chicken, too - the switch is based on my own weird chicken texture issues.

I didn't follow the recipe much.  It sounded way too thick.  I used way more chicken stock, Rotel, corn, and no flour. It was delicious.

Who knew taco seasoning could taste so good! I halved the broth and tomatoes, and I added corn and black beans with their juices. With the Velveeta, this recipe was amazing. Didn't even need sour cream or cheese on top since it was already thick, creamy, and super flavorful. Ate it with corn/tortilla chips on top instead. Delicious!

I make this every other week during the winter! Sometimes I add a can of corn and/or black beans. Rotel instead of diced tomatoes adds to the flavor. Too easy no matter what you do to it!!

This was pretty good. Very spicy. So if you don't like a lot of kick then cut down on the taco seasoning. It also needed some more "stuff" in it. Maybe some corn, beans, bell pepper, something.

Tasty, but this recipe needs Rotel tomatoes and a can of green chiles, maybe a can of black beans (rinsed).

I love soup! In rating this, I have to admit that I followed the recipe but not exactly. I had no chicken so I ground up a couple of burgers we had grilled the day before. Since I'm vegetarian, I added that to each bowl for the meat eaters in the family. I also added some corn on the cob we had grilled, cut off the cob, of course. I used Bill Nicols' Taco Seasoning I and instead of chicken broth, I used vegetable broth. I doubled the recipe and am glad I did, because I could have eaten it for lunch every day and still enjoyed it. I added a dollop of sour cream on each bowl.
