The four tablespoons of celery seed must have been a mistake.  Too much made a good dressing too "bitter".  I'm sure four teaspoons would have been the correct amount

This recipie was terrible.  I only used three tablespoons of celery seed because that's all I had.  My kids spit it out.  My husband had one bite and wouldn't eat it.  The celery seed bitterness spoiled a lot of good cabbage.

I loved it -- especially with the horseradish -- but I did use less celery seed.

First, the ease of mixing/storing in a jar works wonderfully.  Second, I used about 1 teaspoon of celery SALT,  red wine vinegar instead of white, 
1% mild to  desired consistency (didn't have heavy cream on hand), then followed recipe almost to a tee (eyed measurements).  Third, this recipe is perfect for a 16oz bag of slaw mix, and finally, my picky, picky boyfriend's rave review was the icing on the cake!  Perfect all the way around! Would probably make a great salad dressing as well as dipping sauce for chicken/shrimp.

Although I made changes to the recipe that had a negative impact - I don't know if this one would have ever been my favorite.  Piggy backing off previous reviews I tried a little yogurt to boost the health factor in this recipe - wouldn't do that again.  My own fault.  Now onto where I don't like the recipe, the honey was too strong.  I think the sugar would have provided adequate sweetness and the honey added a fruity sweetness I didn't like and had to temper with extra vinegar.  As for the celery seed - 1 tsp was enough.  Used it on Broccoli slaw.... too sweet for me can imagine it would have been worse with cabbage mix.

It was pretty obvious to me that there was too much celery seed for my taste, so I adjusted it.  One tsp was enough for me, and I also used fat free half & half (had no cream on hand) and a good spicy dijon.  Between that and the horseradish it had quite a kick!!  Loved it!  I was serving this for guests, but next time will replace most - if not all - of the mayo with nonfat yogurt, as I plan on making this often.  I also like to use both green and red cabbage to make it colorful.

This is a good and tangy coleslaw dressing.  I did sub buttermilk for the heavy cream.  We had a nice tight and zesty head of freshly harvested cabbage from our weekly CSA box and it made a really nice slaw.

DELICIOUS! This will be my new "go to" dressing for coleslaw. Didn't have heavy cream, but half& half worked just fine. I also thought 4 tablespoons of celery seed sounded  like too much so I used 1 Tablespoon and it seemed perfect. Also used Dijon mustard and it tasted great.

I loved this so much.  I used less celery seed and half and half instead of cream.  I also added a little red onion.  It was a big hit around here.

I used less celery seed and no sugar. (The honey made it sweet enough.)

My family loves this. I made it as directed. Recently to change it up a bit I added raisins and some chopped apple.

Extremely good dressing for cabbage.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because I made several changes.  I live in Guatemala, and here people usually just use straight mayo for salads, which I think is yuck!!  Celery seed isn't available here, but the salad is delicious.  I tossed in a couple handfuls of raisins because I like the texture of chewy with the crisp of cabbage.  Otherwise,  I had only apple cider vinegar, and took a triple batch to a party and brought back an empty bowl.  Thank you for this recipe.

I substituted apple cider vinegar, which is what I had. Used about 2 Tbsp. celery seed, which was enough. It was a hit at my house.

As written, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY  too much celery seed!!!!  I even put in only 1 1/2 TEASPOON of celery seed as opposed to 2 Tbsp. when HALVING the dressing but still detected too much celery seed, so I went ahead and doubled all the other ingredients to make the amount as written, (minus adding more celery seed)--was MUCH better and I could actually taste the other ingredients at that point.   For your own tastes, you could make the dressing without ANY and add 1 teaspoon at a time until you think it's a good balance.   Once you fix this issue, it's really a rather decent dressing for slaw and I will make it again, consulting my notes.

Everything a dressing should be: tart, sweet & creamy. I didn't measure anything, just winged it. Didn't have cream, so I used coffee creamer. This tastes like something my granny would have made!

Sounded good, but the celery seed was overwhelming even though I used half of the amount indicated in the recipe.  After serving it the first time and being disappointed, I did tweak it, adding sugar to offset the bitterness, and it was better, but there are so many good recipes out there that it isn't worth the trouble.

Followed zerodramamama's recommendations except I substituted full-cream sour cream for the cream.  I used extra-hot horse radish and it is awesome.  This amount of dressing is about perfect for a one pound bag of prepared slaw unless you like it soupy. I almost forgot- I put about a half teaspoon of lemon too.  Just a pinch of celery seed.  A smidge.
