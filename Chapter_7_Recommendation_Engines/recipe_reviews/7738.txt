MOIST and FABULOUS.  I made some changes.  I adjusted down to 2 cups sugar (divided into 1 cup each), I added 1 tsp salt to coconut layer. Cool cake and slightly cool other layers (gives more control) and I kept out about 1/2 cup of coconut layer (use for something else). slowly add chocolate (stop if it's going to run over for goodness sakes!) decorate edge with "Mounds Bites"
Keep refrigerated for easy serving. RICH!!!!

This cake was very good. The comment from my family was it tasted just like and Almond Joy candybar.

After reading all of the reviews, I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups and the butter to 1/4 cup.  Still extremely sweet.    I didn't have large marshmallows, so I substituted 1/2 package of mini-marshmallows.  I also poured about a quarter of the cake batter into a 4 inch terra cotta pot and used some of the coconut filling and chocolate frosting to give as a gift to a friend.  Even with the reduced amounts, the 9x13 pan was close to overflowing.  Excellent cake though!

Amazingly, even the non-chocolate lovers devoured this cake.  I made the cake from scratch, and cut the sugar in both the toppings by almost 1/2 cup each.  It was totally gooey and sweet nonetheless.  The coconut layer really soaks into the cake--which I thought tasted good--but if you'd like a thicker layer of coconut, let the topping cool some before spreading it on the cake.

I made the Almond Joy Cake for a church fellowship dinner.  Everybody loved it. After reading previous ratings, I baked it in a 
13 1/2 X 9 1/2 roasting aluminum pan. (Disposable kind)bought at market.  It worked perfectly, 
Certainly makes a HUGE cake!

This cake was a hit at our 4th of July BBQ.  I used half of the butter, a little less sugar and shredded coconut and it was amazing.  I also did it in two layers, which I highly recommend!  Great recipe- Thanks!

In one word: RICH.  Everyone at my office liked it and went back for seconds.  I love chocolate and even I felt it was a little too much chocolate.  I only ended up using 1/2 of the coconut mixture because it seemed that if I used all of it there wouldn't be room for the chocolate layer.  I was very busy making the cake and another dish at the same time and somehow left the butter out entirely--no one noticed.  I'd leave it out again because why add the calories and fat if you don't need to. Also, I think I would 1/2 the chocolate layer and maybe just drizzle it on instead of pouring it over the whole cake...I'll let you know how that turns out.

THIS CAKE IS FANTASTIC!!!  I made it a few weeks ago and my husband took it to work with him (after we had eaten some at home) and after the cake was gone, his boss was in there scraping the pan with his fingers trying to get the last little bit!  The only problem I had was I really needed to use a larger pan than the 9X13 as some of the frosting overflowed.  Will definitely make again.  It is VERY rich and tastes just like an alond joy candy bar.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made...and I've made a lot. I am a perfectionist when it comes to baking, so the first cake I made, I used a lot of the toppings and it just didn't LOOK that good. So I just said, "heck with it" and I made a second one and used more coconut topping than chocolate, and kind of drizzled the chocolate topping over the coconut topping. It looked much more appealing that way. But to be very honest, both cakes tasted absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much!

This cake is amazing - I think I gained 5 pounds just looking at it!  Very sweet!! I might try cutting the two top layers in half next time to cut down on the sweetness and also because I had so much left over.

Delicious! Very moist & extremely rich! I used my Pampered Chef 13x9 stoneware pan which is more than deep enough for this cake.  Other views mentioned there was too much of a coconut layer-but I thought that layer was perfect, however I did feel that there was a bit too much of a chocolate layer on top.  Next time I will only put half of the chocolate mixture on top.  This cake is definitely a keeper :o)

I made this for a family gathering for my husband's birthday.  They all loved it.  I would note that the cake needs to be served in the pan.  I needed the pan for another dish, so I put the cake on a tray.  The hot icing ran off the sides.  I pushed it back up and put it in the refrigerator.  That helped.  Next time, I will leave it in the pan.

This cake is absolutley delicious, but there are three things you must do to get the best results. 1.Cut the topping by half. 2. Use name brand ingriedients. 3. Let the cake sit in the fridge for 24 hours. Follow these three steps and your cake will be a definite success.

I was quite excited to bring this cake to a BBQ last weekend, it ended up tasting great! 
It was VERY messy to make, I could not get all of the first topping on the cake, and even from what I was able to put on the cake some of it ended up on my countertop.  I will make this again, but  need to find a bigger pan.  Quite messy/sticky, but otherwise great!

I followed the recipe but only used half of the toppings for the cake.  I thought that too much frosting would kill the cake and make it to soggy.  Then I put the left over toppings between two graham crackers like sandwiches.  They were yummy.

My husband and I really enjoyed this cake.  Almond Joy is one of my favorite candy bars.  When making this--the coconut topping was getting thicker than the cake so I took some off, and didn't put all the chocolate topping either.  I agree with others about cutting both toppings by half.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This one is a keeper!  I made it for a church dinner and let me tell you... I got many request for this recipe... and then I got as many reminders to not forget about getting the recipe.  

Just a note:  This recipe filled every available inch of space in a large 11x14 glass pan.  It's huge... if I were to make this one for the family, I would make it in 2 9x13 pans (so I could freeze one for later) as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, next time I'll add just a bit of Almond extract to the coconut layer (just to tweek it a bit).    

Another note:  If you don't have the large marshmallows on hand, you can use the mini's...  1 large = 13 mini marshmallows... for this recipe you will need 325 mini marshmallows (that also works out to be 6.25 oz or about 3 1/2 cups of the mini marshmallows).  Enjoy this one!!!!!!

I made this cake for my boyfriend and his brother. They loved it. It was gone it two days. Yummy. The icing actually spilled over the cake and onto the counter. There was a bit of clean up. When I make this cake agian , I am going to do it in layers and put some of the marshmellow topping bettwen the layers.

Almond Joy! What a joy! Wonderfully sweet cake. Exactly like the candy bar. Just make sure that the cake and toppings are about equal, i.e. not too much cake under the topping. Tastes much better after having sat in the frige for a day. Made it 3 days ago and still receiving compliments.

This cake sounded like a good idea but it was too messy. Too much topping for that size cake. Next time I will make two cakes with the same amount of topping recipe.

I made this cake for a banquet and everyone loved it!  It would be better to cool the coconut mixture until it thickens before pouring over the cake.  
The toasted coconut adds great flavor to the cake!

I've made this cake twice now. The second time, I cut the filling ingredients in half. It was even better. (The first time, the filling was so high that the chocolate ran all over the counter!) I also used a scratch 9*13 chocolate cake recipe. My family loves it.

Excellent recipe!! It’s very rich, so a small piece is enough (unless you’re a chocoholic like me!). I cut the sugar & butter by half with no noticeable difference. Make sure to pour the marshmallow mixture in and let it soak through the cake for a few minutes before adding the chocolate mixture, this way, it won’t spill over. Still, if you have any left over, save and use on graham crackers for easy smores. Also, let it chill at least 1 day and serve cold, it won’t be soggy after chilling, just wonderfully moist. Also, remember that it has to be kept in the pan you baked it in; taking it out is too messy.

Pretty good! I love sweet desserts but this was almost too much.  It did taste like an Almond Joy but I don't think I will make it again!

I decided to make this cake for my daughter because she loves Almond Joy candy bars.  Well, what a hit!! Everyone that ate it absolutely loved it.  They're all asking for the recipe.

My niece sent me this recipe and I made it right away. I was afraid the toppings would spill over the pan. If the cake had risen any more, it would have been a mess! I searched for the recipe at this website to see if it was here and to read the reviews and found that others had the same problem.  It must be served cold, in my opinion, but it tasted great. I thought it tasted just like an Almond Joy candy bar. Just serve small pieces, it is very rich!!!

This cake tasted much better the second day but we did not like the thick layer
of coconut/marshmallow goop.  It could have stood to be a little thinner.  The 
chocolate topping was delicious and it did taste just like an ALmond Joy bar!

This delicious cake is very rich.  I too had more coconut and chocolate chip layers than were necessary.  I made it the day before I served it and it was a big hit.

This cake is absolutely wonderful, especially if you love Almond Joys.  The cocoanut filling is exactly like the middle of the candy bar.  I would suggest using MILK chocolate chips instead of semi-sweets, as I did, so the topping will be just like a real Almond Joy.  I did not have any problems with the recipe making too much topping as other reviewers say they did.  It's the perfect amount for a 9 x 13 pan.

It is rather rich and very sweet. In the coconut layer I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2 and I probably could have cut it more without it affecting the taste. I also would recommend only 1/2 cup of almonds. Every bite had too many almond slivers. I also used a 10x13 pan and it held all the topping well. I could see a 9x13 overflowing. But all in all, it tasted like a box cake with two thick layers of frosting. I won't make this again.

I read a lot of the reviews and was hesitant to follow the recipe because so many thought this recipe was too rich. My decision was to bake two cakes and divide the topping. I did add some whole almonds as well. I made sure the cakes and the toppings were completely cool. I was very happy with the results. I had many requests for the recipe. This recipe(made with two cakes)  will be great if you need a dessert for work or to take to a function. This way the family will not be disappointed because there will be a cake for them as well! It also can be made a day or two ahead as it just gets better.

Too wet and messy. I did not use all the toppings either. It was a soaked cake and I would not recommend it if looks are also a concern. Somehow did not taste the coconut but only the texture of it. I think toating coconut will work better. Used 2 c sugar, 15 marshmallows, 1c chocolate, 7oz unsweetened coconut flakes and 2 tbsp butter (for chocolate layer). Sweetness was alright with these measurements. Although easy will not make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I used only half the coconut mixture.  In the future I would toast whole almonds to use in the fudge layer.  The sliced almonds were almost non-existent in taste.  My husband has already asked for this cake for his birthday.

This cake is better than you-know-what!  I took this one to work and it was finished off before lunch.  I made it 2 days before it was served so it would have a chance to meld.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for a friend's birthday. It is her all-time favorite cake. I made the recipe exactly as written and everyone loved it. I am not a fan of chocolate cake, but I enjoyed it.
I used about 3/4 of the coconut mixture and all of the fudge topping. 
Next time I may substitute a "real" frosting for the top. It is not frosting... it is fudge. Also, I like the idea of halving the recipe for that layer and simply drizzling it on top. Whole toasted almonds might be better "pressed" into the coconut layer. I may try it with a brownie base too.
All in all, it is very good. I agree that it is rich and sweet. Thanks Leslie!

Very Good recipe.  I reduced the sugar to two cups.  Since it makes such a large amount of toppings, I decided to make two cakes and I had plenty of topping for both cakes.

Wow, excellent recipe!  Definitely tastes like an Almond Joy.  Reading reviews that warned against overflowing cake pans, I used a larger rectangular pan than traditional 9 x 13 - the cake baked quicker and there was plenty of room for the topping.  I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups and no worse for it!
My co-workers raved.  Loved it!

This was really pretty good! The topping was aweomse, and the cake was a little dry, which is why I'm not givint it 5 starts. Overall, though, a nice change from just plain old chocolate cake.

Must have been just me, since it looks like everyone else loved it.  I threw half of it away.  I had a couple of compliments, but I that it wasn't edible.  There is too much coconut mixture and chocolate topping less much to be desired.  Good idea, though.  Still thinking on how it could be improved.

I made this cake for a dinner get together this weekend and it came out superb.  I did take into account previous reviews and cut back on the sugar (half the amount for both the coconut and chocolate topping) and I also halved the butter amount.  It still came out wonderfully and just sweet enough!  I also didn't put on all of the chocolate topping and saved it.  I bet it will be great on top of ice cream!!

this is actually a really good cake I just think the chocolate was too thick I would use less than 2 cups chips if you are not real strong on chocolate.  I tried it & loved it & so did everyone elst It was easy to cook & great instead of the same old recipes Crowd pleaser & not hard to make Great Cake.

Everyone who loves Almond Joy Candy Bars just raves about this cake!  It is moist, tasty, and a nice variation of a chocolate cake.

Very very sweet (a bit too sweet for my liking), but also very yummy. Preparation took me much longer than 20 minutes though.

This is not suited to a 9x13 pan.  The coconut mixture and chocolate topping should have been halved.  Too much, and too sweet.  Total waste of ingredients.  Will definitely NOT make again.

This is positively decadent!  The only problem I had is the frosting was so thick it spilled over the sides of my pan, but it was still so good!

This was wonderful everyone liked, and recipe requested by a few.  Decided to make in a large deep non-stick lasagna pan since many commented on how big this turns out, and was glad I did.  I reserved a tiny bit of the coconut and almonds to sprinkle on top, turned out beautifully.  Definitely better on the second or third day after sitting in the fridge, and all of the tastes come out when you let it sit out for quite a while before serving.  Everyone commented that it tastes just like an Almond Joy!  Will make again.

I usually make banana pudding for holiday desserts, but my mom beat me to it!! This Easter, I got a "Martha Moment": I colored about a cup of coconut with green food coloring and spread that over the cake after I added the 2 toppings. Then I placed a few pastel-colored chocolate covered almonds on top!  Made for a very festive dessert!  Be careful with the toppings- I only used about 1/3 of what the recipe called for.  This is definetly a great cake to make!  I am NOT a cook, but this was easy.  Enjoy!

This is an awesome cake! It is very rich and definitely satisfies any sweet tooth you may have. I made the recipe as instructed and it seemed fine to me. The only thing I may do differently next time is decrease the coconut mixture a little because it seemed like a lot. But other than that it was supurb!

Like a lot of the reviewers said, the topping is too much for the cake.  I baked the cake in an 11X15 pan, and reduced the coconut to about 10 oz, the topping came out about right (still a little too much).  For me, the whole cake is too sweet.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Wonderful.  This got rave reviews from my chocoholic neighbors.  I used a brownie mix instead and it was perfect.  Be careful to watch the sugar and milk boiling, as I ruined my ceramic cooktop very quickly!  Great recipe!!

I made this for a luncheon and everyone loved it.
I do think it would be better baked in a jelly roll pan instead of a 9 x 13 baking pan. I had too much icing and the topping was too thick. A thinner cake would have worked better however the
taste was great!!

VERY CHOCOLATEY!!!  Husband loved it, need a bigger pan as others stated, runs all over the place...   It always amazes me when people rate/review something poorly when they didn't follow the recipe.  Yes, it's very rich, well duh!?!  It's gonna be rich with all of those type of ingredients.  I take this to anything and people are lining up to get the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe to people who will appreciate a rich, one of a kind cake.

This cake was incredible!!  The frosting tastes exactly like an almond joy - my favorite!  The next time I make this I may use a little less frosting, though, as the corner pieces got a little soggy, and there just wasn't room in my 9x13 pan for all the frosting the recipe called for.  I will definitely be making this cake again... it's a new family favorite!

This cake is SOOOO good.  It just fit in my 9x13 in pan.  I let the coconut sit on the cake just a bit, before I put the chocolate on it.  Everybody LOVED it.  Definitely have the milk on hand to go along with it!

Have a sweet tooth? This will more than satisfy, and it doesn't take but about a 2" square to do just that. Absolutely delicious! Better than the candy bar it is named after, I think.

Yummy!  My husband made this for my mother's birthday (isn't he a good son-in-law?) and everybody loved it.  He didn't use all of the the coconut topping or the chocolate, but it was so rich.  You really need to have milk on hand when you serve this one.  I already had a request to make it for another birthday.  A keeper around here!

This cake was wonderful!!!  After reading the other reviews I decided to cook the cake in a large glass baking dish.  It worked really well because it was deep enough to use all the topping.  I made the cake the night before and the cake was almost fudge like.  One small piece was plenty because it is very rich.

This recipe is wonderful!  You must have a sweet tooth and a love for chocolate and Almond Joy's!!  I have used slivered and whole almonds.  I have found the slivered work better.

This was a good cake. As the previous raters stated-you won't be able to fit this into a 9x13 pan. I had to throw out half of the coconut filling and still couldn't put all the chocolate on top.I will try this again in a bigger pan or divide into 2.

I made this cake for my dad for Father's Day. He said it was the best cake he had ever eaten. I will cut the filling ingredients in half for the next one. It overfilled the pan. It was easy to make and fun to watch others enjoy.

"This is the best cake I've ever eaten!"  I received this compliment from several males at a community dinner held recently.  The cake is best if make the day before to let the flavors blend.  Chocolate and coconut loves truly fall in love with this cake.  Personally, I believe the icing is the key that makes this cake outstanding.

My family enjoyed this cake.  I felt the topping was too sweet.  The only thing I would do differently is to cut the coconut topping and the chocolate topping in half. I will definately make this again.

Delicious but very rich.  You only need to serve small pieces.  I also made my own cake from scratch (9X9" pan) and used only half the topping ingredients; it worked great!  The toppings are quick and easy to make.

This is a very rich cake.  I cut the marshmallows into smaller pieces so they melted faster.  I also reduced the coconut and chocolate and it still was a delicious cake.

I have been making this exact recipe for years.  It is a favorite of my family's, at reunions, at church functions and for bake sales.  The only difference in my recipe is that I half the batter and bake in 2 9x13 pans.  2 cakes are better than 1.  I usually put them in the freezer, too...and we'll take out and eat immediately or let thaw out.  Or you can just put in "fridge" and eat in a day or so.  It's good as soon as you make it, but seems like setting a day or 2 makes it even better.  Great with ice cream.

I made this cake for the 4th of July & served it with homemade vanilla ice cream--it was absolutely to die for and I usually don't like cake mix based cakes that much.  Definitely better if made the day before.

I used a 11x15 pan because of the reviews which said it overflowed. It worked perfect.Everyone loved it. You should let the cake sit for 24 hours
because it will seperate from the topping but hey it still tasted great!!!!

This was easy to make and very good overall. However, I think I would reduce the coconut amt. next time and some of the sugar. Too sweet for me, but my husband loved it.

Wow! It's so wonderful.  Huge hit at the company picnic. Tastes a lot like an Almond Joy candybar.

SWEEEET!!  I love rich desserts, but this was almost too much for me!  It did look like a train wreck, but it tasted WONDERFUL!!  I will make this again (probably cutting back on the topping, as others have suggested).  Cut the pieces small, grab some milk and ENJOY!!
