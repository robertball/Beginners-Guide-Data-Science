Very tasty sauce for pork, but I added some pineapple and coconut to the sauce during the cooking process and then strained it before brushing it on the meat and tastes even more tropical. Try it!!!!

I made this and used it as a sauce over pulled pork for a Caribbean dinner party this past weekend and everyone LOVED it. My guests all took the leftovers home with them they loved it so much.

This was very good!  We used this on ribeyes on the grill because I was tired of the same old same old. Even my dad, who is the worst person in the house to feed, thoroughly enjoyed it.  We found it was best when it was brushed on the meat as the meat is cooking instead of just pouring it on after.  Very different flavor, very good.  (BTW- I DIDN'T use black rum, I used gold, and it was still tasty! Oh, and a touch of coconut rum too.)

Holy !  The fragrance of this alone is beautiful. I was skeptical but it came out very well.  I felt like I should add some ice cream to this or something it smelled so good.

Ok, I was born in the caribbean and I decided to try this recipe but it was not what I expected.  First the smell was great but it was not thick like bbq sauce.  I ended up putting some store bought bbq sauce in it 'cause it look ribs stew.  Also the sauce was very sweet so maybe this could be for those with sweet tooths.  Either way don't expect regular bbq sauce here.

This sauce was very yummy.  I put it on chicken and my husband was skeptical but it was very good.

I made this sauce and used it on shrimp kabobs with pineapple and green pepper chunks on the skewers. It was an amazing flavor to experience.

I will second the stipulation on the black rum. I tried this looking for something different. I substituted coconut run thinking it might go well with the Caribbean flavor. It was not good. Aside from the rum disaster, this sauce was too plain like tomato soup to me. I prefer a zingy vinegary sauce and this didn't do it for me.  Perhaps made ahead and allowed to develop, it would have been less tomatoey and more flavorful.

I too thought this smelled better than it tasted. It was okay but it was lacking something to me. It was thin which is fine by me but it needed some zip.

For us this smelled a lot better than it tasted. Not horrible but just not to our liking.

Good sauce. The only thing I'd change would be the amount of rum.
