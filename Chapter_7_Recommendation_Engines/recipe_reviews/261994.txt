This recipe served two purposes: it is dairy and soy free and it uses chicken thighs which my sonâ€™s pediatrician recommended for their iron content. It is also delicious! Even my husband liked it and he is skeptical of new recipes. It has the right amount of sweetness with a good mixture of spices. I reduced the cumin to 1/2 tsp for taste and it was just right for us. I served it with pasta and tossed the pasta in the pan juices before serving. It was also super easy. We will definitely have it again!

Just okay... made recipe as written except did not sear chicken first so we could prep the night before.  6 hours was too long and chicken was a bit dry...  4 hours would probably have done it for small-medium size boneless thighs in a 6 qt crock on low setting. Thyme was overpowering for my taste but the sweet and savory flavor was otherwise good.  If we make this recipe again I'll omit the thyme and reduce cook time.

I used bone-in thighs and let the spice rub set overnight.  I enjoyed the subtle flavor which, needed just a bit of salt.  I will retain the juices and try a heavy for potatoes.  Overall an easy and different recipe.

So easy. Made as suggested except with bone in thighs and only cooked 5 hrs. Perfectly done. Next time will  use cornstarch at end with the juices

Easy to make for sure.  Appreciate minimal ingredients.  Probably should have used better honey as the flavor wasn't strong in the dish. But overall very tasty and would definitely make again.
