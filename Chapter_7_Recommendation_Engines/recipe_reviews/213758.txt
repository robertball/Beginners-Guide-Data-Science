I made this Friday night for dinner. Everything I used in this recipe was bought at Grocery Outlet, even a good local wine for 2.99! I used organic cannellini beans and omitted the salt. I really enjoyed this as did my husband, great basic flavors of each ingredient all coming together nicely. My kids didn't care for it but that meant there was more for me the next day. The crusty bread is a must have with this dish to sop up all those juices, cooksforfourty is absolutely right. And you know, I think this was even better the next day, if that was possible. So simple and so comforting. Thank you SO much for sharing.

The whole family really enjoyed this for dinner last night. I subbed chicken broth for the white wine. I used canned navy beans, they kind of dissapeared while it was cooking. The chicken and sausage was so good!! I served with mashed potatoes on the side. This would be good ontop of egg noodles too. I will def. make this again!!!

5 Stars! But I did make a couple changes to suit my family. First, used mild italian sausage and browned meats before adding to crock pot - not necessary, but does add a nice flavor. Second - Added 1 cup chicken stock along with the wine for more sauce. Last - thickened the juices with water and corn starch before serving. DELICIOUS!

Good slow cooker recipe, but it had a lot of meat compared to the other ingredients.  Adding one more can of beans would help round it out a bit and maybe reduce the chicken to 1 1/2 lbs.  I substituted 1 tsp. dried thyme for the parsley. At 5 hours the chicken was overcooked but the cassoulet wasn't thickened yet. Good flavor and easy to make.

Like others I used chicken legs rather than breasts, because it tastes better.  Also, I started out with dry beans rather than canned, which gave me a lot more control over the end flavor.  I used beef broth, chicken broth, and white wine, in equal parts to cook my beans in.  Then I added 3 baby leeks finely chopped in place of half of the onion, and added 1/2 TBSP of thyme.  It was amazingly delicious!  Cassoulet is one of those dishes that  everyone has their own recipe for, so I think this recipe is more to let people know that it can be made in a slow cooker and give us the times and ratios, which I appreciate greatly.  As far as the "dryness" others complained of, cassoulet isn't soup.  This is the texture it's supposed to be.  Thanks so much cooks4forty for this innovative and unusually healthful take on cassoulet.

This was good, but too salty.  I will make again and omit salt entirely.  Could not find cannellini beans - used butter beans and they were excellent.  Could not find turkey kielbasa so used regular but the low fat kind.  Very good with some tweaking, and certainly very easy!

As per previous reviews of this being too salty, I held back on salting it. I will next time use the chicken broth instead of the wine. I subbed great northern beans instead of the cannelini, and i did end up salting it a bit at the end. My recipe did not start to "break down" and thicken until about the 7th hour. I did use bone in breast/ that's what I had on hand and prefer to use since they dont dry out as bad. Served this with "ali's amazing bruschetta" also from this site. This was a great dinner on a end of the season surprise cold night.  Thank you for sharing!! It was well received.

Yum!  I didn't add parsley but added a tsp or so of dried thyme.  I served it with roasted potatoes and sauteed cabbage.  My entire family loved it!

Having read the other reviews, I took the recipe as a jumping off point and improvised from there. I DID brown the chicken, added plenty of pepper but no salt along with some fresh rosemary & thyme as well as herbes de Provence. Also, I added some finely diced carrot & celery, a can of diced tomatoes & LOTS of parsley. At the end I ladled the juices into a pan and reduced them by about half. The end result was delicious! I wish that I had an alternative to Kielbasa which I use in other recipes but don't really like very much. I also regret serving the Cassoulet over noodles as one reviewer had suggested. Next time it will go straight into the bowl. Thanks, cooks4forty, for giving us a great inspiration!

I made this for my husband and he absolutely loved it.  When I first told him the ingredients, he felt it would be bland.  After tasting it he enjoyed it quite alot.  He didn't even add hot sauce to it, which he adds to everything.

We made this in our trailer while we were camping.  The smell was incredible.  We thought we would have leftovers, but everyone wanted a taste and well none was left.

This recipe is a big yes. Every recipe is flexible; I take "to your taste" very seriously. With that in mind, I knew the kielbasa wasn't what I wanted. I used italian sausage -- the mild, or "sweet" kind, not hot Italian. (Although, I think that might be good too, in a different way.) Many people (most men) don't care for breast meat because it tends to be bland and dry. I use boneless thighs. Garlic: use more, or add it for the last hour or two. Garlic flavor cooks away. Many seasonings do. Crock-pot: don't lift the lid, don't stir, do not disturb. Suppress your natural cook's tendency to check the pot. Slow-cookers only work one way.

This was delicious!!! You definitely want to make sure you have some crusty bread.  The next day I took the leftovers, layered them in a baking dish with thinly sliced potatoes and swiss cheese and cooked just until the potatoes were done and the cheese bubbly.  It was also fabulous.  Will definitely be making again, and again, and again.

I'd actually give this 3 stars for when I followed the recipe exactly as written; maybe I did something wrong but the chicken was very dry and the beans were mushy, but the overall flavor was good. With a few changes, I give it 5 stars. I doubled the wine, skipped the salt, added a can of diced tomatoes, a couple tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, and 1/4 tsp thyme and waited to add the beans until 1-2 hours before serving. Most important, I used whole chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts so they were MUCH more tender.

This was ok, but it turned out pretty bland and the chicken was dry (no idea how this happend in a slow cooker!)  I may try again and add some more seasonings like basil and a bay leaf, and definitely increase the beans and halve the amount of chicken.  It is very, very chickeny.

This was a wonderful base recipe for this classic dish!Any one can customize it to their taste. I used chicken thighs and pork smoked sausage. I also used canned drained great northern beans and pinto beans. I added a chicken boullion cube and chicken broth instead of wine. I love herb blends so I used a country herb blend and poultry seasoning. I love spice so I used seaasoning salt and red pepper flakes. I added celery, carrots, and chunked tomatoes. It was a fabulous meal. I served it with pasta.

Excellant slow cooker recipe. I made a few changes. I used chorizo instead of kelbasa. Browned the chicken as a few picky eaters in the family do not like chicken steamed. Very tasty overall.

Let's face it, dishes made in the slow cooker are rarely as good as food that's cooked on the stove, in the oven, or grilled.  This recipe is worth its weight.  I used chicken stock in lieu of white wine, and turkey kilbaska in lieu or pork.  I cooked it 10 hours on low.  It wasn't dry or bland.  Yes, it will taste better if you take the time to saute the kilbaska and onion beforehand.  But, as written, this meal is simple, nutritious, and perfect for a busy work day.

This is a great dish and I make it often. I will put it into the crockpot just before we leave for church and when we get home it is perfectly done. I rarely have more than a bean left over. The flavor is wonderful and I haven't had to change a thing. The turkey kielbasa keeps the calories and fat down but the flavor doesn't suffer. Highly recommended.

Update: after some comments about the chicken being dry I substituted chicken thighs for the breasts. I browned them first and removed the skin after cooking but before serving. It made a big difference, not only was the chicken not dry but the sauce was much richer.

This recipe was fantastic, delicious and easy to make. I couldn't find turkey kielbasa so used sweet Italian turkey sausage. I served it over brown rice with thick bread to soak up the juice. My family loved it!

I just made this Cassoulet for my daughters French class feast.  I did use thighs instead of breast and chicken broth instead of white wine.  I also seasoned the chicken to my taste prior to putting it in the crock pot.  I had to drop it off at the school so I didn't get to taste it prior.  When my daughter got out of school, she told me it was "amazing" all the kids loved it and she wanted me to make some for dinner.  So it was a big hit!! Thanks for a great recipe!

It has been a couple of weeks since I have made this one.  I was going to make it again before rating it.  However although my husband liked it, his friend liked it more and took home the leftovers.  I can't say I didn't like it but I didn't like ti well enough to make it again.

I agree with Cooks4Fun; this recipe is definitely a jumping off point for something even better.  I've used other recipes for Cassoulet, but always end up putting my spin on it.  It's a basic recipe that you can tweak to your own taste.

This was suprprisingly good! Even my husband liked it, and he usually objects to anything with beans in it. The only thing I did differently was I used Thyme instead of parsley (I like thyme).  The flavors just melded together really nicely, it was easy, and even the kids liked it! And when I asked, "should I  make this again?" I got three 'yes'es!

I used turkey broth instead of wine it worked out just fine.  Try cooking, on low, for only 4 hours instead of 5-6.

reasonalbe starting place, i use red wine, whatever i'm going to drink for dinner.  It needs another onion, it needs a pound of chunked carrots.  I use beans soaked over nite, northern white usually, needs lots of spices, someone suggested tyme, excellent, sweet basil, rosemary - all good.  it wont work without wine, i agree.  I use chicken thighs, and lamb sausage or sweet Italian.  Add some chopped celery in the last 30 minutes.  and a can of tomatoes, whatever is in the cupboard.  my favorite are stewed Italian.  if you have time check the amount of juice in the last hour, this is not intended to be a stew, as others have noted.  I have not seen an advantage to cooking this in a slow cooker over a slow oven.  Unless you do not have an oven.

I tweaked this. Used picked rotisserie chicken and bulk chicken sausage and chicken broth instead of wine. Added chicken about an hour before done and cooked  till thickened.

I first made this as written, but when I tasted it during the last hour of cooking, I thought it was missing something! So I ended up adding 1/2 tsp. liquid smoke, 1 cup of chicken broth because it was a little dry, 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and 4 oz. of cream cheese! These additions really boosted the flavor and texture! It made it a more smokey, creamy cheesy, hearty dish! I served it over egg noodles!

Wasn't real pretty to look at, but tasted good.  I only used 1 can of beans (navy). I did have to add more liquid through the day of cooking (chicken broth every once in awhile to prevent from drying out. I did add celery and some poultry season and old bay like other people suggested.  Served with rice on side.

This was excellent!  I used a chardonnay for this and let it simmer for about six hours on low.  I did serve it with the crusty bread and a nice green salad.  I had enough liquid in the slow cooker to make this stew-like and the flavors were wonderful.  I did use regular kielbasa, which is not as figure friendly, but it was very tasty.

This recipe was disapointing.  I thought as it was, it was dry and not very flavorful.  I ended up using more spices and herbs and adding chicken broth and twice as much wine.  I won't  make it again.  I'd rather have bean soup!

I used andouille sausage and I browned all of the meat first.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes to it.  I think it needed that acidic bite to balance out the dish.  I also added some bay leaves to it.  It's delicious!

This was a great!  i took the advice of others and added 1 cup of chicken broth plus 1 bay leaf.   i used 2+ chicken breasts and 2 large boneless thighs and cooked on low for 7 hours (2 pounds of chix would have been too much).  No need to cut the chicken, it ends up breaking up easily once it's cooked.  i subbed dried parsley for the fresh.  With the added broth, it turns out more like a hearty stew.

I would probably add more beans because they are so creamy and with that turkey kielbasa they get a nice smoky flavor.  Nice and light comfort food.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but I could tell there wouldn't be enough beans for me.  I used about 4 cups Great Northern beans which I had cooked from dried, with about 1/2 cup of their liquid.  I thought my onions were small, but I used 3, about 2-1/2" diam.  I removed the chicken and shredded it and added it back to the pot (I think true cassoulet has chicken pieces), but I could easily cut the chicken in half.  Flavor was better the second day, and nice and onion-y.  Next time I will add a bit of Herbes de Provence for richer seasoning.  But I'll definitely make again!

I gave one star because it was easy as author stated. Used chicken broth instead of white wine, otherwise followed recipe. We found it way too bland with too much bean taste. The chicken was mushy instead of tender. The broth was just bean flavored juice. I served with a crusty delicious french bread. The bread was great, the other not so much.

As written I am giving this recipe a 3, but it has potential to be a 5 star.  Thanks to other reviewers I added more seasoning--2 onions and four cloves of garlic as well as 2 teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning.  I cut back on the salt.  The liquid was a bit of a problem.  I started out adding the 1/3 cup of wine, but soon realized that more liquid was needed.  I then added about a cup of chicken stock as one reviewer suggested, but that may have been too much as the end product was almost like soup.  I would suggest adding an additional 1/2 cup of liquid and see if that is enough.  I  served over rice and it was very tasty and quite filling.

After reading the reviews I was skeptical about this but went ahead and made it anyways.  I made it pretty much exactly as written except used chicken broth instead of wine, therefore I did NOT add any salt. This came out pretty good, tasted kind of like bean soup with sausage and chicken in it. :)

Ok, if you try this recipe, you MUST use the wine or it will be tasteless. The wine is the key ingredient. A few alterations I made: I used half an onion and 3-4 cloves garlic, substituted 1/2 tsp thyme for the parsley and about 2/3 cup wine (I used chardonnay). I cooked on high for 4 hours. Next time I will use 3 cans of beans. I would have liked more beans. It was tasty and is good left over the following day. My 4 year old even ate it!

Liked it, but felt like it was missing something.  Tomatoes?   I added an extra 1/3 cup of broth because it seemed like it was dry.  There were no real juices to this, but it was still pretty good!

This recipe is awesome.  Cooked in 6 1/2 quart Oval Slow Cooker for 6 hours on low, chicken was very tender and came off the bone very easily.  Removed the Chicken from the Slow Cooker shredded and put back in Slow Cooker, stirred everything made sure it was all mixed together properly.  The Cannelini Beans maintained their texture, also had added some Baby Portobella Mushrooms, which also maintained their texture, nothing became mushy or dried out. I used chicken legs and thighs, as that is the only part of the chicken I buy.  I can't stand chicken breasts, even with the skin and bone they are tasteless, as far as I am concerned. The extra ingredients I used, 2 lbs.,Polish Kielbasa, 3 cans Cannelini Beans, 8oz.,of Mushrooms. Followed recipe except the Wine, would have used the Wine, except my husband had to go to work, wasn't a good idea to put the Wine in at this time. The next time I make this, which will be again soon, will make sure he doesn't have to work that evening and use Wine along with Chicken Broth.  This recipe needs more than 1/3 cup of a liquid or it will be very dry. Served this with a Spring Green Salad and Toasted Italian Bread. YUM O. Thanks for sharing a great recipe. Not only is this excellent it makes the house smell good.  Thank You Peggy

This was just awesome.  I seasoned my chickent breast pieces with s/p & poultry seasoning before giving it a quick brown in a pan with a little olive oil.  I threw everything else together in the crock pot substituting ckn broth for the wine, dried parsley for fresh, 5 garlic cloves (we love garlic :)and some dried marjoram, oregano, & a few bay leaves.  Cooked on high for 5 hours.  Served with some sour cream mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots.  We ate dinner in near silence as this was just so good!  I'll try it w/wine next time and fresh herbs from the garden.  Amazing!!!

I followed this recipe exactly, except for omiting the salt and for adding 1 chicken bullion cube into it.  It disolved nicely and  it added the salt the recipe called for.  I served it with honey brandied baby carrots and homemade fruit cocktail along with french bread and honey butter.  My girlfriend's family loved it, and it was a easy menu to do buffet style, informal, yet understated elegance.

This was just okay in my book. After reading the reviews before making this, I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and omitted the salt completely but still felt it was too salty (due to the keilbasa). One other change I made was that I put my boneless, skinless chicken breast halves in whole - which kept them moist and juicy. When they were done, I was able to just break up the breasts into bite sized chunks with a fork. Also - I subbed the dry wine for chicken broth because its what I had on hand. I would probably make this again someday, but will probably omit the kielbasa completely or sub it with meat all toghether. All in all, not bad - but not great either.

Really good recipe with a little tweaking.  The cassoulet recipe I usually use is not a slow cooker one so this turned out to be helpful.  I used 2 pkgs of Polish Kielbasa, chicken breat tenderloins that I chopped into chunks, and instead of wine, I used organic veggie broth.  I add a little more than 2 cups of the broth so it has more of a "stoup" consistency.  Usually I use giant butter beans but I was out so today my cassoulet was beanless. :)  I also add bacon crumbled on top. MMmmmm, not healthy  but sure will be good on a rainy day.

Eh.. this was fair - I thought it was relatively decent, but my husband yucked at it.  I used chorizo as was suggested in a review... it gave a nice smoky flavor but it got very crumbly, almost sawdusty weird texture. Here are some changes I made: during the last 2 or so hours of cooking, I threw a package of frozen potato-onion pierogies on top of the mix to add in a carb. Also I served it with crispy french fried onions when i plated it up. I didn't have parsely so I used fresh rosemary as the cooking spice and added some italian seasoning.  Here's what I would do if I make this again (which honestly I doubt I will..): instead of using actual sausage, I would suggest a nice smoky ham bone... and for some reason I kept thinking this was crying for okra.  I would suggest adding maybe a tad more liquid too.

Loved the recipe, house smelled so good all day. Topped mine with some oven roasted asparagus just to make sure we got our vegetables. Did slow cook for 8 hrs, and came out perfect. Bought a loaf of french bread just like suggested, perfect!

Did everything according to the recipe, but for some reason the beans broke down into a complete gloppy mess.  Fortunately my company was close family, or this could have been embarrassing!  The flavor was good, but the consistency was starchy & way too thick.  Next time I will cook it the same way, but add the beans an hour or so before it's done.

Ok.  Made this tonight.  Would rate 4.5 stars if that were an option.  Changes:  Used chicken thighs instead of breasts - whole - because that's what we like.  Used 1 tsp thyme instead of parsley. Added 1 cup chicken broth (no wine) in anticipation of all the wonderful juices to dip toasted rustic bread into. Cooked 7 hours.  Perfect!  Will make again - easy and comforting and adaptable to individual tastes.

Tried this tonight...delicious. I did think it was a little too salty, though, so I added a medium size can of sauerkraut at the end. We thought it was just the right touch. I'll make this again. Thank you

SIX stars for this one!   Loved, loved, loved it.   It's cruised to the top of our "keeper" list.   Served with saffron rice and zucchini.   I used Sweet Onion Wine from LaBelle Winery (in NH), a dry white with vidalia tones.   Highly recommend.

Great recipe. Made no real changes except no wine in the house, used chicken broth, the rest of the can of broth I mixed in with the next day leftovers.  Had an Easter hambone in the freezer, threw that in to use it up.  Really good with the Italian Bread using a Bread Machine recipe that Destiny posted on this site. YUM!

We thought it was much too salty but the smokey flavor was really nice. Never had cannellini beans before. They were really good. Will need to find other recipes to use them in. Thank you for that.

It was okay. I added thyme and rosemary as others did and cooked it on the stovetop instead. Just something quick and easy to throw together. I'd rather stick with Louisiana red beans and rice or gumbo... Sorry.

Great recipe! Easy week night dinner that tasted like a lot more work then it was. I followed the recipe with these exceptions: I added celery & carrots, used  1lb of chicken thighs seasoned with thyme, parsley, salt and pepper (that I browned first) and combined the chicken stock with the white wine. Absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Made this last night for guests and it was wonderful... HOWEVER, due to my inability to leave a recipe alone, I added more than a few things.  I used 1/2 lb. kielbasa,  not turkey..., I used both boneless thighs and chicken breasts (1lb each).  I browned the meats with the garlic.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup (undiluted) and I added fresh basil, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme, 1/4 cup finely chopped carrots, and a bay leaf to the parsley.  I also added a full cup of wine.  I made this in a 3 quart crock pot and cooked it very low for the full 6 hours. I think a larger crock would have cooked it too fast.  I've discovered that the size of the crock pot makes a lot of difference in how tender any chicken dish comes out.

Loved this recipe! I couldn't find cannellini beans so I substituted northern beans. Before placing in the chicken I seasoned it with paprika and browned it. I also browned the kielbasa for better flavor. Lastly I added 2 tablespoons brown sugar. It was a hit with my very picky husband. We will for sure make it again.

This was very bland.  I was very disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Did not taste anything like an authentic cassoulet.  I'm sure with some tweaking it could improve, but I wouldn't bother.

This was really nothing to write home about.  I had a good flavor but the beans did nothing for us.  Just gave a weird texture.  My husband and I ended thowing most of it out because no one would finish it.

The flavor was good once I added a cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup wine.  Otherwise it was dry and disappointing.

I liked it, but my husband and teenage son were not enthusiastic.   My son thought it was too soupy; my husband thought it was too bland.

This was not good at all. Horrible combination (sausage and chicken).. We Gave the food away and went out to eat instead.

I give this one star for how easy it was to throw together and let cook all day, but I can honestly say that none of us would try it.  It didn't even smell good.  The combination of these ingredients just didn't work together.  such a complete waste of money and food.

This turned out to be a waste of good chicken at my house.  We like all these ingredients separate, but together it just didn't work for us.  I used chicken broth instead of wine, there really wasn't any juice to eat with French bread.  I'm very disappointed when no one eats the leftovers.

No one in my family liked this, and we are not generally picky.  The combination of chicken, kielbasa and beans was just wrong in regards to texture and flavor.  The aftertaste was terrible and stuck with us all night long.

This was really good.  My husband seldom likes food that is all cooked together but he was really suprised at how good this is.  I used a can of Campbell's Soup Chicken Broth and a splash of white wine.  I mixed some flour and water mixed in a cup then poured into the crock pot and turned on high.  Worked really great.  Will be making this often.  I enjoy reading reviews and often use the changes suggested by others.

I loved it, great flavor and simple recipe.  I added a tiny pinch of basil and used chicken broth in place of the wine.

I liked the taste but mine was very dry.  I may have cooked it too long.  I think I will try it again and cook less time.

I didn't like this.  The texture and look were bland and the flavor unpalateable.
