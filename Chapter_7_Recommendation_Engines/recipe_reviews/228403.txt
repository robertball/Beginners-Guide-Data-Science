What a sticky fun recipe! The melted candy corn can be a challenge to stir but the end product is fantastic! I am not a candy corn fan at all but my husband loves the candy bar so I gave these a whirl. They turned out great! My husband said they were "extremely good" and "better than a Butterfinger." The taste is dead on with a slightly different texture which we like because it doesn't stick to your teeth.

Delicious!  My husband, who hates candy corn, absolutely died when we tried these!  He ate half the pan in the first 20 minutes after they were ready.  Only thing I would change is the amount of candy corn.  I would add an extra half cup.  The candy corn is what makes it all stick together, and I felt it needed a little more sticky-ness, they were just a little crumbly. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

Fantastic! SILLY easy and really very much like a Butterfinger. I used a 25 cent clearance bag of smushed "fall mix with candy corn" (the kind with the little orange and green pumpkins) I made it even easier by just sprinkling the chips on the warm filling and spreading them after they melted. Go ahead-you know you want to make these!

This candy is pretty close to the real deal in taste, slightly different in texture.  The melting of the candy corn is pretty simple, but you MUST work quickly with this as it becomes very hard to stir.  Have your peanut butter measured and ready to add before you start melting the candy corn.  I poured mine in a parchment lined small cookie sheet.  Once it set up (I did not put it in the refrigerator) I lifted out the parchment to cut.  This cut nicely into squares and was a nice addition to Christmas cookie/candy platters.  Everyone liked it, no one raved about it.

These are excellent and taste exactly like the candy bar.  I did not use shortening, I just microwaved the chips at 30 second intervals, stirring in between, 'til they were ready.  Also, I stuck the bars in the freezer for several minutes before spreading on the chocolate.  I didn't find this recipe until long after Halloween candy was gone, but luckily, Amazon stocks candy corn year round.  This will be on my Christmas tray for many years to come.

Very sticky, and very good!  My boyfriend was hesitant because he dislikes candy corn but he gobbled it up once they were finished.  Just like butterfingers!

My family make these every year for Christmas. Mom makes some, my sister in law makes some, 
and I make some. We use creamy peanut butter (it mixes easier with the melted candy)  and we use the chocolate candy coating and dip the bars after they set.  Its less crumbly and sticky to eat that way.

These taste like a fudge form of the candy bar.  Awesome!  I doubled the amount of chocolate.  6 oz is not enough at all.  I did good with the 12 oz bag of chocolate chips and did add the shortening which helped the chocolate spread easier.

*Update* As time goes by and package sizes change, (the last bag of candy corn I purchased was 9 oz.) I have found that 1 cup of candy corn to 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter is the best ratio.

I have made this recipe a few times and this time before I started melting the candy corn, I zapped the peanut butter for about 40 seconds in microwave. This helped stirring immensely and gave me more workable time and made it 
alot easier to remove peanut butter from the jar. I will always do it this way from now on.

These are great! I was surprised how much they taste like Butterfingers.  I pressed mine into a square then cut them into Halloween shapes to make them a little more festive.  Yum - thank you for a quick and easy recipe (I think!).  I'm probably going to make these too often :)

We have a peanut allergy and made these with WowButter instead of peanut butter!  AMAZING!! My daughter, who is allergic, has never had a Butterfinger before. This recipe allowed me to modify the ingredients for her and the results were fantastic!!!  I followed the recipe exactly only substituted the crunchy peanut butter for an equal amount of WowButter.

so good and so easy!  I took the advice of others and warmed my jar of peanut butter (I used crunchy and liked the bits of peanuts in it; added to the texture) and warmed it in the microwave for 1 minute, keeping the lid on while I made the rest of the candy.  It was still warm and poured right out of the jar, which helped save time needing to work a bit quickly with the melted candy corn.  Used 2 big bars of hershey chocolate bar w/almonds melted down with a bit of coconut oil for the sheen.  I didn't want to open a new stick of crisco.  I'm glad I used milk chocolate, as I think it tasted more like the butterfinger candy.  Even though the texture is slightly different, it tasted so much like the real candy, and everyone loved it.  No one could believe it was made with candy corn!  It went fast for sure.  Glad I bought a few bags of corn after Halloween.  I plan on making this again.

Terrific, and easy.  Be prepared to stir the pb and candy corn for a while (and I do heat up the pb to make it easier). Btw, I use a kitchen scale to get the exact measurements since it’s hard to find 18oz pb and 16oz candy corn.  Everyone loves this faux butterfinger treat!  (Frankly, I think it’s better than the real stuff)

This recipe  is super easy and people are extremely impressed with your "baking" skills as a result :)
Like other users said, the only hard part is scraping the melted candy off.
I don't use shortening and couldn't justify spending money on it for only this, so I use coconut oil or butter instead instead.  No issues whatsoever.
I made these for my friend who is allergic to gluten for her birthday.  They were a big hit there, as well as when I took them to office for the holidays. People who claim to not like butterfingers say they love these.
I usually don't tell anyone the "secret ingredient" (candy corn) until after they have tried them because a lot of people are not fans of the candy by itself.  HOWEVER, you should be aware that most Candy Corn is NOT vegetarian.  Thus, you should let anyone with dietary restrictions know before they eat some.
I had my husband buy all the candy corn that went on sale the day after Halloween.  We have several bags handy, so this is my go-to when I need to take a treat to a social function.

Hmmm.  Not sure whether the reviewer meant equal parts candy corn and peanut butter by weight or volume, I decided to hope it was volume.  I wanted to microwave the peanut butter but I could not get the foil off of the edges of the jar.  Since I don't have a new microwave in the budget this month I heated the peanut butter on the stove.  Not enough to mix easily, though.  The mixture was cooling too fast so I tried to heat it in the microwave but it was cooking the peanut butter.  It was not sweet, so I put in the rest of the candy corn, which did not melt.  I pressed it into an 8x8 pyrex pan lined with Saran wrap.  Then I topped it with melted milk chocolate chips, heated under the broiler just before it melted completely, then I added another layer of wrap and set it to cool.  An hour later I cut it because my taste testers were leaving for overnight.  It was pronounced AMAZING!!! The chocolate is very gooey so I am going to refrigerate it before individually wrapping the candies.  I cut them pretty small.  There are whole candies in there, and the measurements are very imprecise, but the result is clearly Christmas Magic!

I cooked the candy corn too long. Otherwise, this would have been a delicious treat. My sister made it several years ago, so I know it's super tasty. You can use creamy or crunchy peanut butter. Everyone loved it, even though I knew the texture wasn't quite right. Nothing could be easier, and it really does taste like a Butterfinger bar.

These were certainly easy and inexpensive to make.  Once cooled, though, they became too hard to chew. The taste is good, but the texture made them inedible.

This IS delicious. Like others have said, it is like Butterfinger Fudge!!!! I found it difficult to stir the candy corn, but added the peanut butter and melted it together a little bit.

These really should be illegal to make!. They are insanely good in my opinion! My old roommate won a candy counting contest last year around Halloween, and won $50 off rent, and the jar of candy corn that he guesstimated; he left the jar with us whenhe moved out! :/
This is a great recipe to use to get rid of it all, but I am now going to have to watch myself so that I don't gain 20 pounds. I am going to have to share it around... a lot! Lol.
