This frosting is delicious!  I made a double-layer chocolate cake and then used 1.5 times the ingredients for the frosting, and I had quite a bit of frosting left over!  MMMmmm... and it goes great on graham crackers too! (a great treat for your kid's lunch box in case you ahve never tried it - chocolate frosting/graham cracker sandwiches - just like mom used to make!).  Five stars!  (FYI: I used evaported milk so it wouldn't spoil if left out on the counter, and the frosting tastes great!)

Incredible!  Why would you ever buy the canned stuff again?  I didn't melt the butter, just let it come to room temperature and added 1-2 tablespoons more milk.  Will definately use this as my frosting of choice from now on!

This was a really good, chocolately frosting.  I needed this to fill thumbprint cookies I made earlier today.  I did alter the measurments a bit.  I used a 1/2 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of cocoa powder.  The chocolate taste was not over powering by any means...it actually gave it sort of a fudgy texture which we really enjoyed.  I have made this in the past and substituted brewed coffee for the milk.  Thanks for sharing!!

This frosting was amazing. I made some Peanut Butter Cupcakes, recipe found on this site, piped this frosting onto them. They were so delicious. I did add about 2 tbls more milk to get the consistency I wanted.

Very good frosting.  Be aware, though, that it is quite thick.  After cooking it I had to whip vigorously and pour it on the cake quickly.  It hardened to a lovely, almost crunchy texture.  I had it on yellow cake but it would definitely go well on brownies.

I was so pleased with this!  Because I was using it to pipe onto cupcakes and I wasn’t sure how that would work with melting the butter first, I didn’t.  In addition, I used butter rather than margarine and just three cups of confectioners’ sugar.  It was light, fluffy, and unmistakably chocolate. I know it would have been darker, more fudgy looking, had I melted the butter, and I’m anxious to try it that way on brownies or a sheet cake.

I loved this icing! I didn't have quite enough margarine, so I used a little crisco to make up the difference and I didn't melt them though, I cut it into chunks and then used the mixer to whip the icing until fluffy. I needed to add a little more milk as it was really thick to spread. The second time I made this I used all margarine and still had to add more milk than specified. This is very good frosting, nice and thick a bit sweet so I added some more cocoa powder to tone down the sugar some. Good stuff, I'll use this again! Thanks!

just what i was looking for.
i made mine with vanilla soy milk (all i had on hand) and it worked well. the cinnamon is vital, in my opinion. i put this on banana bread because that is all i had to put icing on and it was g  o   o  d.
i like that is is made with things i always have in my kitchen.

Easy to make.  Tasted good.  Although, I did have to add some more milk to make it the right consistency to spread.

This icing is easy to make and soo good, I'm eating it off the spoon, pairing it up with brownies and I don't think they'll last a day in my house. Will make it again, Thanks!

This had a great flavor and next time I might add the cinnamon as Norma suggests.  I would mention that once the butter is melted you should remove it from the heat before adding the rest of the ingredients.  My icing turned into a large lump and was a bit thick, but that is easily remedied by adding a bit more milk...

SOOOOOO FANTASTIC. This frosting is decadent and rich. In short, delicious. I used it on several different baking projects of various flavors and it was perfect for all of them. My new go-to frosting recipe.

This has to be the best brownie frosting ever made.  I frosted half of the brownie pan with these, and added chopped pecans to the other half of the frosting, then spread it over the other half of the brownie pan.  That way, everyone was happy!  Great recipe!

Even though I've tried some other frosting recipes and liked them, it seems as it's been hard trying to find just the right one for me. I do believe this is it!! I made some homeade doughnuts with a recipe I had gotten on this site, and made this frosting to top some of them with. It's a bit of a thicker frosting, I think, but perfect for doughnuts as it melts down a little when spredding on them warm. I doubled the baking cocoa and added a little extra vanilla and a little extra milk at a time until I achieved the right consistancy.

Sublime.  Scaled this down to half for 18 cupcakes and still had some leftover, but I wasn't opposed to eating it by itself.... Used butter instead of margarine.  And just eyeballed (evaporated) milk in until it got to the consistency I wanted.

Good.  Needed a lot more milk than called for though.  I switched out half the milk I needed with cold coffee and it was fantastic.  Then, not leaving well enough alone, I added cinnamon, which would have been great, except you only need a SMALL pinch! Apparently my pinch is too big.  SO, try the cinnamon, but be very careful how much you add.    I didn't melt the butter, just used room temp, which might be why I needed so much more milk.

I had to use quite a bit more milk than the 3 tbsn called for. And after I added the 4 cups of sugar it wasn't as chocolaty as it was just sweet. So I added 1/4 cup more cocoa and a bit more milk and it was awesome! I used this for a double layer chocolate cake and had more than enough!

Tried this frosting on a red velvet cake and my family devoured it. Used a little extra cocoa to get the chocolatey taste with half the confectioners sugar. Substituted  1 1/2 cup brown sugar for the other 2 cups.

Wanted icing for Cream Filled Cupcakes and this was perfect.  I ran out of powdered sugar, so I only used 3 and about a 1/4 cups, but it was still terrific.  Thanks!

Simple, quick, easy, delicious!  I made this in less than 10 mins to frost some brownies last-minute.  
But I only put in 2 cups of sugar, stopped there as it was still quite sweet that way (I live in New Zealand now and they don't like frostings as sweet here) Thank you!

Used half butter, half criso.  Beat with my hand mixer with the cocoa.  Added powered sugar, vanilla, and milk as needed.  I also added about 1-2 tablespoons of Hersheys syrup for added chocolate flavor.  Used to frost Bakers One Bowl Brownies.

This is the best frosting EVER !!!! I added an extra 1/4 tsp  of milk  for easier spreading. It was the perfect amount for my 13x9 in chocolate cake. I will use this recipe for anything needing chocolate frosting :)

This had a very good, rich flavor. I thought it tasted like fudge. I used it on a Texas sheet cake. The consistancy was not a creamy, but more of a fudge frosting that hardened- like one you would find on top of brownies- but maybe that was because I let the butter melt and bubble before adding the other ingredients. Overall, very tasty!

It made a very little amount and after I started adding the icing sugar, the whole mixture separated and I was left with a huge ball of cocoa powder and gallons of liquid fat. I can't say one good thing about it, just awful.

added a little more milk at the suggestion of other raters.  Confusing because it was thick yet it had the whipped consistency.  I'll make this again.  Yummy.

MAKE THIS NOW! I made this frosting recipe because all I had was cocoa powder and no melting chocolate. I added a dash of cinnamon and it's the best frosting ever. Beautiful consistency. You'll never buy frosting again.

Precisely what I was looking for!  A soft chocolaty frosting that uses pantry ingredients and goes together in a snap.  Consistency is remarkably similar to canned.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of instant coffee to round out the flavor, but it was delicious even without it.

OK I didn't read the instructions as I was in a hurry. I didn't see I was supposed to melt the margarine. I had mine at room temp & it worked perfectly! Wasn't gritty. Came out nice & fluffly! Love it! ...did add a little extra milk.

Tried making this frosting twice.  It turned hard rather quickly and was also very chunky.  The second time I made it I tried sifting the confectioner's sugar to see if that would help, but it didn't.  It tastes pretty good, but it's chunky and hard to spread on cake without the cake crumbling.

A lovely tasting icing though it was a bit coarse. I would do it again. I added a drop milk to it to get it to the right consistency but overall it was great!

i love this recipe! i have made it a few times now and put it on top of brownies. i dont think there is anyway to mess this recipe up and its soo easy. i did change the recipe a few times and instead of adding vanilla (because it can be expensive) i added another tsp of milk and you cant even taste the difference!

Yum...this is super tasty chocolate frosting. I cut the recipe in half and used it to frost the Mmm-Mmm Better Brownies from this site...it was perfect and so tasty! I must add, though, that this frosting hardens up quickly. I made it and let it sit for a couple of minutes, and when I came back and stirred it, I found it to be too thick. More milk was necessary to make it frosting consistency. My family really liked this...it is very rich and sweet. Thanks for sharing...I will be making this again!

it was super thin- i had to add another cup of powdered sugar to even get it to stick to anything. but it would probably be best on doughnuts. That's what i'm trying it on today. It was REALLY good though.

I've never made any kind of frosting before, and this one rocked.  I did scale it back to 12 servings since I was covering a 9x9 banana cake. Super easy to make in less than 5 minutes.

Love, love, love this recipe!!!  Best chocolate frosting ever and it makes a ton.  One recipe was enough to frost a 9x13 cake and let my husband gorge on frosting.  I usually add a little more milk for cakes, but leave the recipe as is for brownies.   I made a gluten-free chocolate cake mix for a friend and it tasted like beans.  I'm not kidding.  If I hadn't had this frosting, the cake would have been ruined.  Luckily, this frosting was chocolatey enough to make up for the horrible cake mix.  Make this frosting--You won't be disappointed!

I took this basic recipe and amended it to make chocolate banana frosting.  I used 1/2 cup butter, melted, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 2 cups powdered sugar, and 1 *small* ripe banana mashed. I omitted the milk and vanilla. Beat together for 5 minutes or so. Fabulous! Thanks for the basic recipe.

Needed a chocolate frosting last minute and I am so glad I picked this one!  I put it on a yellow cake and it was scrumptious!  I love the chocolaty-fudge flavor it has.  It was so good that a cake that usually lasts a few days was nearly gone the first night!   I will use this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious and so easy to make!!! Was amazing with the peanut butter brownies I made, which were super peanut-buttery with chocolate chunks.  Would probably be too rich with regular chocolate brownies for me, but with the peanut butter brownies, it tasted like Reese's mini peanut butter cups in a brownie w/ frosting form----SO SO ADDICTIVE! It tasted just as good for the next two days!  Would DEFINITELY recommend, unless you are trying to diet--You WONT be able to resist!

This is a great chocolate frosting.  It wasn't too sweet and the texture was nice too.  I had to add a little more milk but you never know with frosting I might not need to next time.  Great recipe!

Very yummy! I didn't have any ile so I added Mocha Almond Creamer which added tons of flavor. This frosting was easy to spread over my brownies and harden nice but still creamy at the same time!

This is your classic chocolate frosting.  It's great for decorating cakes.  It is thick and easy to work with.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

This is the best Chocolate Frosting I have ever made!  I used softened butter instead of margarine and it turned out perfect.  No need to melt the butter so long as its at room temp. I needed to add more milk a little at a time to get the creamy texture needed.  The best part is how creamy it taste.  Not like bakery buttercream at all.  Light, fluffy and delicious.

Excellent simple icing.  Takes more than 3 tbsp. milk to make it spreadable, but add slowly (I added too much and it was too runny the next day).  I frosted the "chocolate zucchini cake III" with it, which was a deadly combination.

I grew up with this recipe used by my mom, now 90, on her chocolate cakes.  She taught it to me and said she got it from her high school home ec teacher (around 1932) in Blackwell, OK.  It is a classic.

My first from scratch frosting and I won't be buying any more from the store.  I read that many people used this for brownies, but I wanted it for a cake.  I added condensed milk to change the consistency and was quite satisfied with the results.  I would reccomend this and continue to use it!!!

This is amazing! I actually found this recipie on the back of a Hershey's Cocoa box and then I saw that it was from all recipies so i signed right on and rated it. I made it last night with a friend as a midnight snack to serve my chocolate craving and made it again this morning for my dad because he wanted to try it! Both times we scaled it down 1/4, I think that it needs at least double the powdered sugar to make it thick enough. Thank you so much!

I’ve seen this recipe go well for a lot of people, but for me it just didn’t work right. It is probably because I used really bad likely years expired confectioners sugar which I had to scrape off the side of the glass bowl. It turned out really dry and cracked, the color was off, and didn’t spread well. I had to use a lot more milk and butter in order to get it to mix at all. It still tasted great, so it well deserved four stars

This frosting is very good! I love that it uses staple items I always have on hand.  I used butter instead of margarine, and I added an extra tablespoon of milk to make it less stiff. Perfect for frosting my brownies.

I made the frosting to use on black-bean brownies.  I used extra-virgin coconut oil instead of the margarine.  Just place a cup with the coconut oil (if you have the solid version)in the sink or another container of warm water and the oil will melt quickly.  Use extra-virgin because it has more of a coconut taste.   I halved the recipe and had plenty for my 8x8 pan of brownies.  I had to gradually add more milk to get the consistency of soft frosting.  The amount in the recipe wasn't enough.  My kids loved this frosting and it gave sweetness to the black bean brownies.

This made enough to generously ice a 9x13 pan of brownies. At first I made it as written, but only half a recipe. It was too sweet for me, so I increased everything so that I ended up with the full recipe,  except just over half the amount of sugar, and lots of extra cocoa. I liked it that way better. I also know from past experience that substituting brewed coffee for the milk is amazing, I just didn't have any coffee. I would do that next time if possible.

I followed this recipe to a "T"! Delicious! I used it on a yellow box cake. I always test new frosting recipes on box cakes. If it's a keeper then I'll bake a cake from scratch. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Next time I will double it though. As written it's not really enough to adequately frost a 9x13 cake.

This tasted really good!  It was incredibly easy to make too.  I added about 2 more tablespoons of milk to make it a more spreadable consistency.  It wasn't too sweet and it tasted great on a yellow cake.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Only added half the sugar. Taste great to me! Put over a chocolate cake that was in a pan, so the runny consistency didn't matter.

I made this frosting to use on a Texas Sheet Cake and it was super tasty.  I normally like it a bit thicker so next time I will use a little more powdered sugar and cocoa, but even as written, everyone raved over it.  Great recipe!

It tasted good, but the consistency was too thin. I had to pour it on the cake and it dribbled down the sides. Adding more powdered sugar didn't help.

Tastes very yummy! To make it creamier...just add extra milk...I added about triple the amount of milk so it didn't tear the cake.

I think it is supposed to be put on warm brownies.  the frosting is suppose to set up like a ganache to those commentors who were unhappy with the texture.  If you want soft frosting do a buttercream recipe.  
Thank you for sticking the recipe on all recipe I had lost my recipe.

Works great for cake balls too! Serving size is 32 ounces though. Make half a recipe for 1 box of cake.
If you don't melt the butter, your frosting will be grainier than not. I tried it both ways, and the melting works best for me.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make.  Only thing that I changed was adding 2 extra tablespoons of milk. (was to thick)  But that is just a personal thing.  Great flavor, and the whole family loved it!

Love this but made key changes!!!! 1) dbled the recipe for a large 2 layer cake 2) used room temp BUTTER 3) used twice the ammount of cocoa and only 5 1/2 cups of icing sugar ( remember I dbled the recipe ) 4) used 1/2 milk suggested and added same volume of cold strong coffee...any additional liquid needed to smooth out the frosting was cold coffee....I couldnt keep my teenagers away from the beaters and bowl and because of this I BARELY had enough for my cake ( "but mum, that corner doesnt NEED icing " as they licked their spoons and dipped for more )

Just delicious!  This frosting turns out light and fluffy (although I did add a bit of extra milk until it came to the consistency I preferred).  I did add a hint of cinnamon, as recommended, and it was a great addition.  Mmmmmmm!

Very good frosting - it doesn't have that "too sweet" taste that I usually dislike about frosting.  Really enjoyed, and perfect on top of the "One Bowl Chocolate Cake" from this site!  Thank you for the great frosting recipe!

Absolutely great frosting!  A total keeper!  I made a layered cake (white cake) for my father-in-law's birthday yesterday and used this frosting. It was a total hit with everyone!  My hubby couldn't stop eating until it was gone!

This would be a great icing for rice crispy treats or brownies...I tried to use it on a cake and it was a bit difficult to work with. I had to reheat it slowly to get it to spread and it did not "stick" to the cake very well. Great flavor though and fairly easy to make.

DELICIOUS! Great on brownies, cupcakes, or even soft cookies. I made it twice, and one time I used about one quarter tablespoon less cocoa. It made it a little less strong, better for brownies so that the amount of chocolate is not overpowering. For cookies, blondies, yellow or white cake etc.... the full 4 tablespoons is best. Enjoy!!! This recipe rocks!

This pan frosting is so easy.  After reading some review, I will offer that it must be cooked.  This frosting is poured on hot and seals the moistness in - great for cake or cake brownie.

This is the recipe my mother always used growing up and I have never found a frosting that I like better.  Thanks for sharing it with everyone.  I found that 4 cups c. sugar is too much.  3-3 1/2 seemed to make the perfect consistency for me.

This frosting is delicious!  No need to look further.  I didn't measure my powdered sugar, but I think I used about 2 cups.  I did sift the sugar.  The frosting was perfectly smooth and  chocolately.  The cake I made wasn't great but the frosting saved it.

This is a very tasty chocolate frosting recipe! I used it on cupcakes, I can see where it would be great on brownies or cookies. My mom makes some sour cream cocoa cookies at Christmas time and this would be perfect on those! I will definitely go to this recipe when I need chocolate frosting, though it does dry out and get very crumbly, so i will have to figure out how to make it a bit creamier. It is easy to make and so much better than the stuff at the supermarket!

This is a GREAT thick, creamy, fudgy chocolate frosting!  I am using it on brownies, and can't wait for the great outcome!  I also added a splash of peppermint extract, which is an awesome addition!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Very versatile & delicious. You can add peanut butter and/or nuts to it as well to change/enhance the flavor & it'll still turn out awesome.

This frosting wasn't chocolaty enough, or thick enough. I had to modify the recipe quite a bit to make it taste reasonable. Definitely use a different recipe for frosting.

I made this frosting for the Texas Brownies recipe.  It tastes great (I omitted the cinnamon since there was already some in the brownies).  This does firm up quickly, I spread it on the brownies while they were still warm and it went on fine, but I think it would have been too sticky if the brownies were completely cool. If you want it super chocolately I'd add 1 or 2 more tablespoons of cocoa, but I thought it was good as the recipe called for.

Delicious and easy to make!  Perfect topping for Norma's Texas brownies.  I like frosting, but not in huge amounts, so 1/2 recipe is usually enough to frost the brownies.

Pretty good; tastes a little buttery for my liking and I didn't add the sugar slowly enough so there are some stubborn little sugar lumps. Really helped out the brownies though!

I used butter instead of margarine and half-and-half instead of milk.  Needed extra half-and-half to make frosting spreadable.  This frosting was perfect for my large sheet of brownies.  Will keep as my "stand by" brownie frosting.  Thanks!

Very simple recipe, although I think it requires more milk. I just add in enough milk to make it easy to spread. I found out its WAY easier to spread this while it is still very warm. Ive used this on my brownies, sprinkled with cinnamon and powdered sugar, many many times. Thanx
