These are delicious!  A real hit with friends and family.  I found the icing sugar clumped on when they were still hot so I rolled them after they cooled.

These are my favorite holiday cookies.  My mom made these for us when we were growing up.  Easy and VERY tasty.

I really like these cookies I thought they were great, However next time I will cut back on the pecan. I like Pecan but I think the texture would be better with less. Also I pressed the cookies a little flat

These cookies were just OK.  I found them to be quite dry...my husband wanted me to make these, but when I did, he didn't really care for them.

I exchanged a 1/2 of butter for a 1/2 peanut butter and that was much tastier, next I will add a bit of cinnamon, yum, yum.

I try to make them once a year, usually during the holidays. I even submitted them in a "community bake off" and won 3rd place!
