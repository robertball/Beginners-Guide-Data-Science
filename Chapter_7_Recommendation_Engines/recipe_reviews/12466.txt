I can see how this could flop on some folks but it worked great for me. I read most of the reviews so this is what I did that I believe made my attempt a success: I sifted my flour like it says--some people were complaining about there being too much flour in it making it crumbly -- if you don't sift it, you do get more flour than intended because it is more compacted.  I handled the dough as little as possible--mix it just enough to get the balls to form--it should look marbled, a good sign for flakiness.  After letting it chill (I did that while making the apple filling) I wet a washcloth and wiped my counter, then I put down a couple sheets of plastic wrap so they'd stick tight to the counter.  Then I unwrapped the dough and placed it on the covered counter and put another sheet of plastic wrap on top of it and I rolled it out like that--a plastic wrap sandwich.  It rolled out very quickly, with no turning, and neatly as there was absolutely no messing with flour which could make this crust too dry again. Once rolled out very thin, you simply remove the top plastic wrap and handle the crust gently by lifting up the bottom layer of plastic wrap and placing the crust carefully in your pan. This is a delicate crust, so measure and place carefully.  But, it looked, held-up and tasted great so I gave it 5 stars.  Thanks!

Made an amazing apple pie crust baked at 350 degrees!  I did make one change - I placed the oil in the freezer for an hour prior to making the dough.  It made combining ingredients much smoother.

I made this recipe tonight and it was
very tough.  I realized why when I reviewed the ingredients.  The recipe called for 2 3/4 Cups Flour...too much.
The most flour to be used with 1/2 C oil
should be 2 1/4 C Flour and the least
amount to be used is 2 Cups. Had to throw my
pie away.   Becky S

I gave 5 stars for this one. Now the reality is that things made with high fat such as shortening, etc. do taste the best to the tastebuds, but if you are into healthy eating, this is the piecrust for you. You can have your pie and eat it too. To me, for a healthy crust, this is absolutely delicious. This will be my new piecrust for all of the pies that I bake. Used olive oil for extra health benefits. Finally, to be able to eat pie without feeling weighed down.  Thanks so Much for this healthy variety piecrust. It is great!!!!!!

At last I have found the exact reciepe!! My mother-in-law made an oil crust and I could never duplicate it (I think she gave me the wrong receipe on purpose!!)  This has always been my husbands favorite...Thanks so much. Oil crust is a little harder to roll out than lard crusts, that's the nature of the beast, I roll it out in between  wax paper..

I was surprised to find there are no whole wheat pie crust recipes on this site, so I used this recipe as a basis for my own creation: I used 2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour, added a tsp of fine herbs and a tsp garlic powder, used olive oil instead and soy milk.  Also added parsley.  Baked at 350 F to make quiche.  Very good!  The only thing I would have done differently is cover the edges of the crust with foil so they wouldn't be as hard... the rest of the crust was nice and tender.

Even though this crust is not as tasty as a regular solid fat pastry I gave it five stars because it was the best oil pastry I have tried. I used it for the top crust of a chicken potpie and it was relatively flaky and very  easy to handle. I did not make any substantial changes. I did add some savory and a little basil to the crust since it was not for a sweet pie. I also used olive oil for it's health benefits and rolled the crust out thinly between 2 sheets of waxed paper. I have added this to my hand written cookbook because I will be using it again.

Very easy, the trick is to roll it as thin as possible.  For even better results make the dough first, put into the pie plate and refrigerate while making the filling.

I used this recipe for a long time to make strawberry pies (excellent!) but lost it.  I'm glad to have found it again!  Thanks!!  Oh, I just patted it into the pan instead of rolling and worked very well!

I tried this recipe using skim milk and olive oil for the top crusts of individual chicken pot pies.  Even after freezing, the crusts baked evenly w/o shrinking.  Will use again... thanks!

This crust is a much appreciated alternative to traditional shortening-based recipes! And it's VERY easy if you follow these simple tips: 1) make sure you sift the flour before measuring to ensure that you don't use too much due to dense packing in the measuring cup. If you don't have a flour sifter, stir up the top layers in your flour jar or bag using a fork or wisk, then gently dip in the measuring cup and level off.  2) Chill all ingredients and mixing bowls in the fridge or freezer for at least 15 minutes before you begin. I mixed the flour and salt in a bowl and put that in the freezer, and mixed the oil and milk together and put that in the freezer. 3) Mix ingredients just enough to moisten and finish with hand mixing. A marbeled look is exactly what you're looking for to get a flakey crust. 4) Roll out each ball of dough between two sheets of wax paper to avoid extra flour and potential sticking. And make sure to chill your dough before rolling it out- I put mine in the freezer for about a half hour. 5) If you like a sweeter pie crust, I suggest using an egg white wash and a sprinkling of sugar on top. I don't think it's necessary to add sugar to the main recipe. 6) To make sure the bottom crust doesn't get soggy during baking, try dusting the inside of the bottom crust with flour and sugar before pouring in the filling- about a tablespoon each of sugar and flour. I read this tip in a review for one of the pie recipes on this site, and it works like a charm! Enjoy!

I make this crust all the time! I prefer to use an oil based crust rather than one with margarine (for health reasons.) I use this crust for pies and for quiches. I usually make my pies dairy-free so I substitute about 6 tbsp. water and 4 tbsp. lemon juice for the milk. I also add 2-3 tbsp. of sugar to the crust. I find it rolls out very nicely and easily. I place the crust into a pie plate. I poke it with prongs of a fork. Then I spray a piece of tin foil with PAM and place the sprayed side directly on the pie dough. I bake for 9-10 minutes. Then I remove the tin foil and allow it to bake uncovered for 2 minutes. I then fill it with quiche or pie filling.

My Mother passed down an oil recipe, with the same ingredients, but different ratios. Try sifting 2 cups of flour and 1 tsp. salt. In one measuring cup, measure 1/2 cup oil then add 1/4 cup milk to it. Fold that into the flour mixture. Use immediately. THIS is a no-fail 5 star pie crust!

i would definitely recommend blind baking or pre-baking this crust before adding any pie filling. i used this recipe for an apple pie, and the bottom of the crust tasted oily and remained semi-uncooked, even though the filling was not that wet. the top of the crust, however, turned out fine--flaky and crisp without the oily taste. i'll probably try this again with the blind baking first. hard to give up on such an easy recipe!

This is a no-fail pie crust. Have been using it for years.  However, my receipe calls for 2 c. flour, salt, 1/2 c. oil and 1/4 c. milk.  Mix and roll out between 2 pieces of waxed paper.  Dampen the counter first and the waxed paper will stick to it, put pie crust dough down and cover with another piece of waxed paper.  Roll out and remove top paper and then just flip dough into pie dish.  It's easy to correct any mistakes and comes out nice and flaky.  This recipe says it's for 2 crusts, but I think that was for a smaller pie.  I make 10" pies so use the whole receipe for one pie.  Wonderful, especially for pumpkin pies which usually have a soggy crust.

Loved this recipe. It was quicker and easier to work with than traditional pie crust. I handled the crust very little and rolled it out onto a lightly floured pastry cloth. I used the one recipe to make two single crust pies. One pecan and one pumpkin. I saved a small bit of pastry, rolled it out and cut it into leaves. With the back of the knife, I made leaf veins for sweet little detail. Placing the pastry leaves on the top of the pie for the last 20 minutes of baking, browned them nicely. NOTE: I used glass pie pans, baked my pies at 425 degrees Farenheit for the the first 10 minutes of baking and turned the heat down to 350 for the remainder of the time. I placed foil over the fluted crust so it wouldn't get too brown. The pies were a real treat.

SO easy to put together and rolled out very nicely!  It lifted off the rolling surface without breaking, which is great, because I've had problems with breakage.  I refrigerated for about 10 minutes and it was perfect.  I used 1% milk.  I don't use shortening, so it's nice to have a recipe like this.  I just wish it was flakier, so it gets a 4.  It also got a little hard and crispy on the top.  But I will definitely use it again!

Amazing. 5 stars for a healthier crust. I am trying to bake healthier and this pie crust was a hit. I used olive oil. It turned out flakey but the taste was a little bland. The second time I made it I took 1/8 cup of milk, 1/8 cup of water and beat an egg into the mixture, topping it up with water to get the 1/2 cup of liquid. I also borrowed the idea of adding 2 tsp baking powder from another recipe. I left the dough slightly marbled and rolled it between 2 layers of wax paper which worked well and made it easy to flip when rolling and transfering into the pie plate. The second time the crust was slightly flakier and the taste was not as bland. The crust turns out browner then normal but does not taste burnt.

This is World War II recipe, from a ladies magazine during the days of butter rationing. All my aunts made it, and one of them remembered at my mom's funeral that they learned it from a magazine advertisement promoting the new Mazola corn oil brand. Mom always insisted on Mazola oil, and I agree that it is more tasty than non-corn oil. I printed it on the little memorial cards that the funeral home passes out. I thought that way people would keep it in their recipe books and remember her great pies.

I was a little skeptical but this crust really worked and it was super easy.  It doesn;t quite have the same texture as a butter crust but this is great for beginners, people watching their fat intake or for a heavier pie.  I used it for butter tarts and got lots of compliments.  Be sure to roll it thin!

out of all the pie crusts that i have made i thought this was by far the most flakiest! I added a little more milk because it was a bit dry and left it in the fridge for about 30 minutes and it came out spectacular! i used it for apple pie by grandma ople and it was the perfect compliment! I rolled it out beween two plastic wraps and it was very easy to use! thank you!

First, I will agree with other reviewers, and say- Make sure you sift your flour before measuring. It DOES make a difference. I was in a pinch, and wanted to make a pie, but I didn't have shortening or butter, so I tried this. I was pleasantly surprised!  I haven't cut into the pie yet, but I did use the leftover crust to make little cinnamon/sugar medallions (See recipe for "Piggies" on this site). They baked up nicely, and they are crisp and flaky like a pie crust should be! Yum!

This recipe is really the best! I made an orange meringue pie! It was delicious! And the flour is just enough ... you really need to sift it before measuring. Great! Thank you very much!

Let me start off, I am not a baker.  I love to eat the sweets but they never come out right - I was convinced I was missing the baking gene.  Nevertheless, I was dying to make the "No Sugar Apple Pie" from allrecipes and I really wanted to keep it healthy by pairing it with a pie crust w/o hydrogenated oils (margarine).  So I dared to make my own with this recipe and WOW!  So easy to roll out, made a great lattice top too and SO YUMMY.  I used olive oil and followed the recipe to a T.  It was great the first day and I think even better the next couple days after.  This is now my no-fail go-to pie crust.

This is a great recipe.  My mom has used this for years.  I use canola oil so it is low in trans fat.  Much better for you.

The oil-based crust recipe is soooo much easier to make than the butter and lard-based.  I'm thrilled to have found it.  This is one you can practically throw together.

I prefer 2 thicker crusts so I used 3 c. flour, 1/2 c. milk, 3/4 c. oil and 1.5 tsp salt.  It was so easy and tastes so good I doubt I will go back to the more labor-intensive method.

This was a great crust for my pumpkin pies.  It was very easy to make and has a great texture. I used a tip from another about brushing the bottom with egg to keep it from being soggy and it worked so well. Yummy!  I made some crusts and put them in the fridge and then did not get back to them.  They leaked out the oil that came out of them. But I will just make them as I need them or try freezing them next time.

Oh my gosh, this is incredible! As known: only use oil pie crusts the day of, because oil has the tendency to separate, and then it's not half as tasty as the day before! HOWEVER, if eaten that day, what a pie crust! I follow it verbatim if making a "saltier" pie, like a chicken pot or what have you. And if using it for a sweeter dish like a dessert, I throw in two tablespoons of sugar, just to bring it all together. Delish.

I've never made pie crust before but I have heard that is a very time consuming task. This recipe makes it simple and easy and it can be used over and over. My friends love the crisp and crunch from this crust when it comes out with a fresh baked pie. I'm even using it for Thanksgiving this year.

This crust is SO easy to make- this was my first time ever making pie crusts, and I had no problems at all. I don't like using shortening in recipes, because it seems like such a pain. So finding this recipe was a treat. The apple pie I made with this turned out great. I'm going to be making it again for my family for Easter.

This is almost identical to my aunt's oil pie crust recipe, which is even simpler because there's no need to roll out the dough. It is delicious and it stays light, crispy, and flaky, even when leftover pie is enjoyed a few days later. I use: 2 c. flour, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 c. oil, 1/4 c. milk, mix lightly in a bowl (dough will be crumbly) and press into a 10-inch pie dish--no need to roll it out, so it takes only 5 min. to prepare! These modifications make one 9 or 10-inch crust.

Since I have a problem with cholesterol I have been searching and trying tons of recipes for a pie crust made with oil instead of shortening.  They were flops. I decided to try this one. I followed the recipe exactly as posted. It was AWESOME!  It was very tender and flaky, and it really had a great taste!  My whole family loved it!

Adding 'oil' instead of butter works better for a flakey crust.. I changed the amount of 'flour' (unsifted) to 2 Cups, and increased the 'oil' to 2/3 Cup. for a double crust pie..then brushed the top with milk and sprinkled with sugar... VOILA, a nice golden top!!  Great crust for any pie!

I had to add some water, as the original mixture was quite dry.  It rolled out fairly well, but was still rather dry, and broke apart some when lifted into the pie pan.  I think the next time I make this (and there will be a next time, because my family likes pot pie), I will use a bit more milk.  I don't think using nonfat milk made much difference.

This turned out well. The dough was a little bit tough in the start so I added a little more milk. I agree with the reviewer who said there is too much flour in it. 2 1/4 cup should be enough. I'm going to try that next time. This recipe also works with almond milk.

Baked this tonight for a Basic Chicken Pie. It made a perfect amount for a 8"x8" square pan with a little dough left over. I just mixed Chicken, Green Onions, Celery, Pepper, White Cheddar Cheese and Mayonnaise in a separate bowl poured it into the pie crust and baked it at 350 degrees until the crust was brown. Both my wife and I loved it, would of added more vegetables but used what I had in the house:).  Will make again for sure.

I would add a pinch of baking powder to tenderize and a pinch of sugar as well for taste. Unsweetened soy milk also worked nicely (for those who are vegan).

Worked perfectly, rolled easy, and tasted great. Thanks for the tip on rolling the dough between 2 pieces of plastic wrap. I did sprinkle the crust with cinnamon and sugar before filling it with apple pie filling for a little extra flavor.  This is definitely my new favorite pie crust recipe!

This recipe is wonderful and so versatile.  I don't know what the people giving it low ratings are doing wrong.  I've made turkey pot pies twice and we're going to try it for pizza and I only found the recipe a week ago!  I've used olive oil, canola oil, or both.  You can add any herb you like.  I love it!

I gave this recipe four stars because there was only one downfall...it was a little tiny bit bland. Otherwise a GREAT recipe! So easy, I had prepared the crust and cleaned up in 10 min.! I didn't over work the dough and it came out so nice and crusty. I did not blind bake the crust because I wanted to follow the directions at first, I'm glad I didn't b/c I was trying out a new pumpkin pie recipe that needed to bake 45-50 min. 
Sadly this crust turned out WAY better than the pumpkin filling, lol.
I will use this again cause I loved the crustiness, and under 10 min is too good to pass ip!

This is the perfect, quick pie crust. It is inexpensive and easy to make. Also, it is good for sweet or savory dishes. Mix the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined. Over-mixing will yield an extremely tough crust.

I love this crust! It is simple and works well. I have made it a few times now and love it everytime. I do recommend sifting the flour then measuring it. If it is it to dry (which happened to me) I broke it up and put it in my food proccessor, pusled till in small pieces, add small amounts of oil till moist the let it relax again. Perfect!

I have used an oil recipe for years. I roll it out between waxed paper, laying two pieces on the counter overlapping some. lay ball of dough in center, and cover with two more pieces of overlapping waxed paper.  I place the paper close enough to the edge of the counter that I can fold it over and hold it with my stomach as I roll it out to keep it in place.  Pull the top papers off, reach under the bottom papers and turn them upside down over your pie pan. So easy, so good, and so much better for the heart!

For such a simple and easy recipe it is surprisingly close to the real thing. The dough is not quite as durable and forgiving as shortening crust but it patches back together easily and cooks up nicely. Once cooked, I found it just slightly tougher and less flavorful than a shortening crust but it has all the qualities of the real thing and for a chicken pot pie I actually preferred the added firmness this crust provided. I only used about 2-1/4 cups of flour as recommended by several other reviewers and chilled the dough for a couple hours rather than just 15 minutes to help it firm up a little better, which I am glad I did because it softens very quickly. I would make this again and recommend it to anyone in a pinch or watching their diet.

I don't know what I did that was different than what everyone else who rated this recipe did, but this was the worst pie crust I've ever made. The dough was very crumbly and would not roll out properly. It also ended up being too small for the pan. I've probably made hundreds of pies in my lifetime--almost all of them with crisco. I don't know if this is the way all oil pie crusts turn out, but I will never use this recipe again.

Needless to say I was not too optimistic about making any successful piecrust.  Until this recipe I wasn't very successful at ALL!  BUT, this turned out great!  I had used it to make a chicken pot pie and my family loved it.  I will make this again.

I like the taste of a butter crust better, but this is good for no cholesterol diets.  I used skim milk in mine, and also pastry flour.  Using the exact recipe amounts, my crust was tricky to roll, but not tough.  I will use again.

I made a custard pie with this crust recipe and it turned out terrific! It didn't crumble to peices, but was perfectly flakyand soft. I read a few other reviews and did chill my oil before use. I think it made a big differnce. I gave this recipe 5 stars because I have always wanted to make scratch pie crust, yet was terribly hesitant. This recipe was SO easy and I always have the ingredients on hand!

Finally a crust that works great and I don't have to feel guilty eating!  I followed the advice that Rayncloud wrote and it came out great- sift the flour before measuring and mix only as much a necessary, leave it looking modeled. Do not use extra flour when rolling.  Also chilling the oil first and chilling the dough well helps.  The crust is not sweet so if you like sweetness sprinkle with sugar.  A keeper!!

I used this pie crust with the "Three Berry Pie" recipe (also on Allrecipes.com).  It was delicious, and this crust wasn't at all disappointing!  When I first tried, I didn't think I did a good job "sifting" the flour, so I just used about 2 1/2 c.  It worked well!  I also took the advice of another reviewer by storing the oil in the freezer for about an hour.  The whole crust-making process went swiftly and I was pleasantly surprised with the end result, so thank you very much!

I tried this with a chicken pot pie recipe.  I am pleased to have found a pie crust recipe that doesn't use shortening.  This turned out perfect, flaky and golden brown.  I took someone's advice and rolled the crust in the plastic wrap which worked great.

This makes a great, flaky crust!  Like another reviewer mentioned, I roll my dough between sheets of plastic wrap so I don't ruin the dough by handling it too much or adding excessive flour...I really recommend that method (plus it keeps your table top neat as a pin!).  Also, you can add a dash of vanilla or almond extract for a slightly more flavorful crust should you prefer.

Easy to make and good taste and texture.  A butter or lard crust is still a bit better, but this is an excellent healthy alternative.  I even substitute 1/3 of the AP flour with whole wheat flour.

This was the best pie crust I've ever had, I used extra light olive oil and rolled it out between waxed paper. My blackberry pie was still crispy and good 3 days later.

I just made this crust to top a chicken pot pie and the results were excellent. I think the key is sifting the flour. If you don't you will be using way too much. I ended up using just over 2 cups of flour to get the 2 3/4 sifted. I also followed other reviews that suggested stirring until the dough was just combined and still had a marbled look. I rolled it between two sheets of plastic wrap after 15 minutes of chilling and it was so easy- with no mess to clean up. It baked up beautifully and was super flakey with just the right amount of crispness. I was excited to be able to use olive oil instead of shortening. Thanks for this great recipe. AND thank you to the previous reviewers for their most helpful tips!

Really easy to make. Used half whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier. Rolled the crusts out between parchment paper - it seemed a little oily but was fine when cooked, Used it for a pot pie.

I have always used an "oil" based pie crust.

I was looking to find another and just happened to find this recipe.

Decided to read the reviews first though.

Big mistake on my part.

Those who have NOT followed the recipe to the letter....your crust is not going to turn out.

If you want to use specific ingredients, may I suggest you find a recipe to fit your needs.

Don't "mess" with a recipe and then grinch because it didn't turn out.

Some comments have stated that the crust tasted bland.  

The oil based crust recipe that I use calls for sugar and salt.  If you are making a "savory" crust, omit the sugar.

I use this recipe for a one crust pie only. It is wonderful and very flaky.

Just my 2 cents

Okay, this recipe is so good since there's no need to pitch the shortening/fat/margarine or etc. since you just take the flour, pour in the milk/oil mixture (which, fyi, I froze for a while just in case). Next time I would keep track of how many tbsp flour = 2 3/4 cup of sifted flour cause sifting the flour was the only problem with the recipe. Defintely a keeper

ETA - OMG, this baked up to be so crispy

I currently live in a country that doesn't make pies, therefore doesn't have Crisco, so I needed an oil pie crust.  This was excellent.  I will make this from now on, even when I go back home to America because it is less time consuming than a lard crust (no cutting the lard into the flour).  Make sure to sift the flour and handle the dough as little as possible.  I did find that I had JUST enough dough with no extra left over.  Be careful not to roll the dough out too thick or you won't have enough to work with.  Excellent!  This recipe was a life saver for not having Crisco accessible.

I love it and it taste great. It is very easy to do.
What I do a bit diffrent is, that i let it in the fridge 2 hrs. And to roll the Crust out i do some flour on the work space. Than it goes very easy.

The printed version uses 1-1/4 tsp. milk.  I tried this and what a mess.  I kept adding milk  but it never really seemed right.  Then when I came back to look at the recipe it says 1/2 cup milk.  Maybe some day I'll try it again.

I have used this recipe for both savory and sweet pies.  Because I have heart disease I cannot eat most fats so I use very good quality extra virgin olive oil.  Because I cannot eat salt I substitute 1 tsp sugar for sweet and granulated garlic for savory pies.  I like it a lot for any pie but I like it best for pumpkin pie.

This recipe works very well for quiches.  Something about the texture makes the whole thing taste better.  As an extra bit of flavor, I add  tsp of ground garlic to the dry ingredients before mixing.

BTW - I did not need to roll it out, just set it in the pie plate and pushed it into place.  I then added my egg mixture and baked.

I don't know if I did something wrong, or what, but I ended up with a gooey soft crawling dough.  The end product is kinda nice, but this is not what I'd call pie crust.  It's more like a potsticker dough.

Wished I listened to some of these reviews. Too much flour made it impossible to work with.  I'll give it one more try with the recommended 2 - 2 1/4 and see where it goes..... This is the first recipe that has gone belly up on me from this site....

Made a very nice apple pie (made it with extra virgin olive oil) only had skimmed milk so I used buttermilk instead (1% fat is better than no fat at all) and added some sugar as it was for a sweet pie. Great success and a lot easier to handle than regular butter crust. I was searching for a healthy crust and this is a total winner.

I understand how this recipe could go completely awry but it worked for me without a problem. I had to chill it for longer than 15 minutes...more like an hour but after doing so and keeping the flour amount the same I had no problems out of this. It was incredibly flaky after baking and alot lighter than a butter crust. I made half a dozen mini apple pies with it to try it out and my husband LOVED it! I'm not big on crust because many of them are too "doughy" (not a word, I know) but this was perfect for me. I added a tablespoon of sugar to sweeten it a bit and it was just right. I can't wait to make a full pie with this recipe.

I made this crust for a sweet potato pie that I was craving. I didn't want to drive to the store for shortening and I had oil on hand. Maybe I did something wrong even though I followed the recipe's directions. I didn't like this one. I'm going to have to stick with using shortening. Thanks for the recipe, though. :>|

THIS PIE CRUST WAS AWESOME, I WAS LOOKING FOR A PIE CRUST FOR MY CHICKEN POT PIE. I WAS GOING TO BUY A PREPARED PIE CRUST FROM THE STORE BUT HAD TROUBLE WITH MY TRANSPORTATION, I STILL HAD TO  FEED THE FAMILY SO I TRIED THIS RECIPE AND I LOVED IT. A REAL HIT IN MY HOUSE. I DON'T THINK I WILL EVER BUY ANOTHER PREMADE CRUST AGAIN. THANKS

Thanks for the recipe. It turned out just fine for me to use for a pumpkin pie. Making an oil pie crust is not an easy task.  Getting just the right amount of flour and liquid is tricky. Having a pie crust that is not made from shortening is worth its imperfections .

I used this pie crust to top my turkey pot pie, because I wanted something less rich and a little healthier than my regular pie crust. This really worked well for me! I only had extra virgin olive oil, so I was concerned that it might taste funny in my crust, but since it is the healthiest oil, I really wanted to use it. I ended up doing 1/4 cup olive and 1/4 cup canola oil, and it worked great! I mixed up the dough, and refrigerated it for about an hour, as I made the filling for my pot pie from scratch. I rolled it out between two floured pieces of plastic wrap, and had no problems with it sticking or becoming soft. It was so easy to put the top crust on when using plastic wrap! Just peel off the top layer of wrap,  turn it over on top of the pie, and peel off the bottom layer. It did get a bit soft on top of the hot filling while I was crimping the edges, but it didn't become a problem. My family really liked the pot pie, and didn't even notice that it wasn't my usual crust! It tasted very much like the crust that comes on the store-bought pot pies which they love. Thanks so much for sharing! I will be making this again!

This worked out really well for my Thanksgiving pies. It was slightly dry but we rolled between waxed paper and it was easier to work with. Nice flaky crust and my favorite part, its cheaper to make then standard pie crusts.

Thank you KGB123. I followed your review to the letter for a successful pie crust. Pie crusts have previously frustrated me, so I've bought them from the store for years. This one is relatively healthy, easy and tastes great.

Not bad for an oil crust. I used water instead of milk and the crust was still decent and edible. I recommend using this type of crust as a LAST resort. (It kinda degraded the value of my lemon meringue tarts)

Worked out nicely. If using Canadian white flour you need to use about 1/4 cup less. If using Canadian whole wheat need to use 1/4 cup more. There is a difference between flours in each country. This is probably why people are having different results.

Ok...I am a pretty good cook and know how to work doughs, but this was a disaster for me!! I followed the directions and even the tip from another reviewer about chilling it in the pan I was going to use. This was extremely oily!! I even patted it with paper towels before I used it! I tried herbs in it as well. I felt that was a great idea. It tasted ok, but was just NOT pie crust. Fortunately I was making Chicken Pot pie instead of something sweet! I also used Olive Oil so at least the oil we ingested was somewhat good for us. As I said, the taste was ok, but it was just too oily! I will try it again and let you know how it turns out if it is different or Better!!

I used this for a pumpkin pie over Thanksgiving.  I did sift the flour, but it still seemed to be a little to much, so I add about a tablespoon extra milk.  I had a hard time getting it to stick together very well, so I smashed it into a ball and refrigerated it for a bit, and that really helped.  It rolled out just fine between two sheet of wax paper.  

I used whole wheat flour, olive oil and low fat milk for the health benefits.  I am the health nut in the family, but every one who ate the pie enjoyed it as well.  The only complaint was that it is a little hard to cut, cause it is a bit tough.

I am into healthy eating, so I really enjoyed this crust.

This made a lovely simple crust. I was out of butter and looking for a crust recipe for a vegetable pot pie I was making, and this was marvelous. I loved the texture and it was so quick to make, this is a keeper.

Very good! Quick and easy, and I really like that it uses oil instead of lard. I used canola oil, and I cut the recipe in half because I only wanted one crust. I didn't refrigerate it because I didn't have time, and it still rolled out wonderfully. Thank you. I will be using this recipe again.

I think the recipe could have had better directions. It doesn't tell you how to bake the crust if you want just a baked shell. I also think it was a little tough (and I did not over mix).

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! this is so easy to mix. one thing make sure you sift your flour!! if you dont you have a crumb mess but the recipe says to sift. im not sure why some people couldnt do this.  i did roll mine out between wax paper no mess:)  and i wouldnt have it set over night before you use the dough. it becomes very greasy but i give this 5 stars!!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it didn't turn out at all for me.  When I tried to roll out the crust, it just crumbled into pieces.  I won't try this again...I'll stick to my shortening or butter crusts.

This came out great, and I love it because it has no trans fat (shortening), so it is healthier. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and it still tasted great.

Wanted to try a pie crust using coconut oil.  Followed directions, using 2 1/2 cups sifted flour, melted the coconut oil and when cool mixed it with the milk.  It mixed well and easily came together into a ball.  It did seem like it could have used a little more flour, so may adjust the next time.  Because coconut oil becomes firm when cold, I rolled the dough after just letting it sit in wrapped in saran wrap.  As per other comments, rolled it between sheets of wax paper.  Used the dough to make a banana cream pie, so fully cooked the pie shell without the filling.  It worked great!  I had a hard time stopping myself from eating the pie dough.  Made a couple of cinnamon pie dough cookies, and used the remainder for the crust.  It really tastes great, with a wonderful flavor and aroma from the coconut oil.  Will continue to play with this receipe for other uses.

This, my first oil-based crust, was a huge disappointment. Was looking forward to a nice crust for strawberry-rhubarb pie.  Simply too much flour, and I even sifted it first as others suggested.  I added liquid to the second half and it rolled out just fine. All the handling made it tough, but it was edible.

I have made Crisco or butter pie crusts for years, and I was so impressed with how easy this crust is! After reading several reviews, I decided to go with 1/2 c. each of olive oil and milk, 2 cups of flour, and salt. It was incredibly easy to roll! 

I made an inadvertent adjustment to the menu. Since I was multitasking and making the filling for left-over turkey pot pie, I mistakenly put the celery seeds in the crust instead of in the filling.  Since it was for a savory pie, I figured it wouldn't matter too much.  

I will definitely use this recipe again.

I couldn't get it to roll out well then realized I was on a granite countertop in a freezing cold kitchen.  After I went to a warmer surface it rolled out fine and worked great.

I made this tonight for double crust chicken pot pie.  It is an excellent recipe!  I followed it exactly, chilled for an hour and rolled between wax paper.  It worked perfectly and tasted great.  Thanks for sharing it.

I'm pretty sure I did not make this pie crust right because the dough turned out very dry and the dough didn't roll out right. Probably because I didn't sift the flour.

Thank you!!  This was light, flaky, and had a nice flavor.  It will be my go-to for savory pie crusts from now on.   I followed the advice of other reviewers and rolled the crust out between two sheets of plastic wrap instead of flouring the table like usual and tried to handle it as little as possible.  No problems at all.  It came out like a dream. :)

I can unequivocally say that this was a disaster.  I think there was just too much flour.  I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't even get it to roll out.  It just fell apart. Most people didn't have a problem so it must be me.  However, if a pie-crust disabled person can't make it work, then it negates what should be an easy recipe.

Very good recipe and easy to make.  I was a little worried after reading the reviews about how to handle an oil based crust, but my fears were alleviated after the experience.  I had to increase the recipe to make pie slices, so the dough became sticky, but I just kept gradually adding flour until it was about perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this recipe to make my chicken pot pie and it was great!!! The crust was light flaky and good!! I found that the dough was easy to work with. I used plastic wrap to roll it out after I refrigerated for 15 minutes. I didn't change anything about this recipe,you don't need to !!I will use this recipe again in the near future!! Thank You Donna for such an easy and tasty recipe!!!

Amazing!! When I make pies with it, everyone's favorite part is the crust! The best crust recipe ever!! I used whole wheat flour and it turned out great! I used sour milk with about 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda it place of milk and it still worked wonderfully!

I use this recipe all the time, for all different kinds of pies, from chicken pot pie to fruit pies.  I use soy milk to keep it non-dairy, and when I'm making a fruit pie, I like to add in 1-2 Tablespoons or so of sugar to sweeten it up.  Thanks a ton, Donna!

This crust is great! I love to make chicken pot pie with it, because it doesn't get soggy on the bottom. Flavors are perfect, and it is so easy! I don't even roll the dough out, I just flatten between my hands until it is large enough to cover the pie pan. Always cooks perfectly with a flaky texture. Love it!

Not the best tasting crust I have ever made, but I would most certainly use it again because it's the easiest pie crust I've ever worked with. I followed the recipe exactly. I heard somewhere that if a recipe calls for 1 cup flour sifted, it means measure it first, then sift it. If it calls for 1 sifted cup flour, then sift it first, then measure. Pay attention to this and you should have no problems. I didn't, and it rolled out like a dream (between wax paper though)!

Great! I cut the recipe in half to make a single crust for a quiche. I usually butcher butter and shortening based crusts by overworking them and making them tough, but this crust was flaky and tender even though I worked with it quite a bit. Of course, nothing beats a "real" crust, but in a pinch, when you're short on ingredients or concerned about how unhealthy regular pastry is,
this works great!

This was an extremely easy pie crust to work with.  I am trying to get away from lard, butter, etc., so this seemed to be n excellent substitute.  I miss the flavor of the other types of crust, but the filling of the pie is the best part, right?!  Will use this recipe in the future.

This turned out terrible for me. I used peanut oil (I don't see where anyone recommends a particular kind of oil) and I substituted 3/4 cup of flour with whole wheat. I tried not to handle it very much. I chilled the oil as one reviewer recommended. I couldn't get it to hold together, had to make a patch work crust to fit the pie dish, and when it was baked it was as hard as a rock! The apple filling recipe I used was great tho, so we just ate the filling. Anyone have any other suggestions as to where I went wrong. I would really like to have a good oil pie crust recipe since it is so much healthier.

Very good crust. I left mine in the fridge overnight as suggested. Also, I rolled it out between sheets of wax paper. It was a little difficult to roll out, but well worth the struggle. Made an excellent, flaky, crisp crust. I used for an apple crumb and a pumpkin---yum!

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions--sifting the flour, etc--and it didn't roll out well at all. Added some extra oil to it and finally got it to stick together enough to make my beef pot pie. I probably wont use this recipe again. Hard to find a really good flaky pie crust recipe.

It is convenient to use oil, but the dough has to be rolled too thin to fit two pie bottoms. Dough is tough at the first roll.

I used 2 cups pre-sifted flour and swapped the vegetable oil for olive oil.  I would use 1/2 tbs  less salt next time. It still turned out very good!!

I don't sift or roll.  I just put everything in the pie pan and mix it until it flakes and then pat the flakes around the pan.  MUCH easier, healthier, and cheaper than buying a crust at the store.  It's FLAKEY and tastes GREAT!!  I think the only trick is not to over mix.   I'm going to make five of them tonight.

I love your recipe! For years, I have used an oil based crust recipe I found on YouTube and have never been in love with it. This one tastes better and is much easier to work with, and requires less oil! I made it tonight for a meat pie, and it was a hit! My only change was that I used seasoned salt and a bit of dried parsley since it was a savory dish.  I can't wait to try it out on an Apple Pie! ??

Good heart healthy crust.  The key is to roll it between two pieces of waxed paper.  You don’t even have to refrigerate it!

I don't normally sift, so I use just 2 cups of scooped-and-dumped flour and it comes out alright.  (That amount may not be perfect - I'm a very amateurish crust-maker - but it's close and it's easy.)

Easier to roll out and handle if it's chilled first.

This is almost exactly the recipe taught to me by my mother, from her mother. My measurements are slightly different -- 2/3 cup oil, 1/4 cup milk -- and I agree with Becky S that 2-3/4 cups of flour is way too much. I use only 2 cups of flour, and often don't bother rolling it out. It's just as easy to press it into a pan with your fingers. An oil crust is definitely different than a shortening & cold water crust, but everyone LOVES my pie crust. When we were kids we would just bake it on a cookie sheet and eat it by itself! This crust has a great flavor, and the recipe is easy and never fails me.

I made this using Amy's All Purpose Gluten Free Flour. The texture of the bake pie crust was great - flaky and light. Because gluten free flours tend to taste a little flat, I doubled the salt. My entire family was happy with the end product, even the one's who can eat gluten!

This is a crumbly dough, which is why it is flaky when baked. To roll it out, roll between two pieces of wax paper.  First, dampen the counter and put down one piece of wax paper (the water helps hold it in place). Then the dough, the second piece of wax paper. Roll out very gently, and mend cracks.

My mother almost always made this oil pastry dough for all her pies. It always turns out well. It can be re-rolled if needed. She would take the dough that was waste, re-roll it, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, bake it on a cookie sheet until browned and give it to us kids for a snack. Suitable for savory recipes, too. I think it keeps refrigerated for a day or two wrapped in plastic.

I made half a batch for a quick crust for quiche. I patted it into a tart pan and blind baked. My husband loved it and keeps requesting it. Even quicker and easier than rolling out dough.

Worked very well for me , except I didn't roll the dough out 
too thin . I tried picking it up to put in pie pan and it tore to
pieces . next time  I will roll  out on plastic wrap so I can pick 
the dough up and put it in the pie pan all at one time . Just  
a tip  from me .

I have made thousands of pie crusts in my life.  I have used every combination of fats, proportions, etc.  This crust was a snap and amazingly flaky and tasty.   I like my pie crust a little salty to contrast with the sweetness.  This one provided an excellent balance of everything.  This will be a go-to for me.

Made with Gluten Free flour and almond milk for my Gluten Free dairy free in-laws and they said it was great.  It rolled out well but had difficulty when transferring to pie pan.  Had to push out into the pan.  They said it was wonderful and asked for the recipe.

I only gave it four stars simply because an oil crust cannot compete in flavor with a butter crust. Like kgb123, I was careful to sift the flour, and like him/her, I used plastic to roll out the crust. In my case, it was even simpler because I have a circular plastic zip-up form to use. The crust is simple to make and produces a quite tasty result. I've used this recipe for years now and have had nary a complaint.

Long story short, the only thing my recipe had in common with this one are the ingredients....I made a major mistake which caused my measurements to be way out.....however, it worked!  Never having made ANYTHING from scratch before, I was amazed.  Basically, I had intended to make it a LITTTLE too wet due to the reviews, and, well, that worked.  I was only making a half batch...so I calculated everything, wrote the new measurements on my print out.....measured 1/2 flour, a little less than 1/2 salt (due to a review that said use less), .....then proceeded to forget to use my half measurements for oil & milk, so used a little MORE than regular (ok, if you follow, that's a little more than TWICE the oil & milk it should have been).  Well, when I went to roll it I added flour until it was no longer 'too wet', and it worked perfectly, and was easy to handle.  I definitely did not have the 'too dry' problem.

I will use this recipe again.  I sifted my flour, and if I had used the intended 'just a little more' than what is suggested for oil/milk, I believe it will work perfectly.  Or, you can do it my way and make it way too wet to start, then add flour as needed.  :)  Oh boy.

My house burned two years ago and with it my beloved Betty Crocker cookbook.  The reprint seems to be from a later edition and does not contain the recipe for this crust.  I have been searching for this recipe ever since.  Thank you so much.  
My pie baking has suffered greatly from the loss of this recipe.  Now I can get back on track.

Crust was crumblier than I like but not bad. I was glad to see a crust made with oil instead of shortening so will try again.

I couldn't even roll it out.  Most likely, after reading the other 1 star review, there is way too much flour.  However, I read that review too late to save ingredients.  I'll have to try another recipe now or lose my apples.

Awesome and simple recipe that is simple yet innovative.  I agree with some other reviewers that sifting the flour does help with how it turns out.

I used this recipe for both fruit pies & meat pies. No changes in amounts as I use rye flour & grapeseed oil. The result is a short crust pastry with a mild nutty flavour....I have recieved numerous requests for the recipe. It is good.

This worked fine for me, and did not take much effort at all. Be sure not to cook it too long, the edges tend to burn when you make a pie. Just put it in quick and don't let it brown, when it looks like it is rising a little take it out and put the ingredients in and it should work. I like the flaky texture and it tastes good, so go for it! I am sure you will be pleased.

I got compliments from the crust because people know how hard it is to make, and it worked in a sinch. I don't like needing to chill things too long so I like the short chill recipes. The final product was a bit too hard for me. It was pliable enough to make lattice work on a pie. This is a good backup crust when I am out of butter!

This dough was difficult to work with.  I followed directions exactly - sifted the flour, worked minimally with the dough - and it was terribly hard to roll out, as it kept falling apart.  I ended up having to pat it into the pie pan piecemeal.  The taste was okay and it was flaky, but I probably won't make this again.

Have tried other oil crusts and this one is the flakiest and is easy to roll (use a silicone mat and a marble pin.) I have always made great pie crusts but this gets two thumbs up from the family.

I liked the idea of using oil instead of butter. However it was very difficul for me to roll out. I used white whole wheat flour. I'll try it again with all purpose flour

This was better than another oil pie crust that I tried.  I liked the taste and it mixed together very easily.  It was a little difficult to roll out.  Next time I might try rolling it between sheets of plastic wrap.  But, in the end it worked and it wasn't too tough or too crumbly so I'll keep using this.  I kind of like using the oil since it's healthier and less expensive.

This was a good recipe, however we encountered a minor glitch, sifted the flour, added the exact amounts, and apparently from getting the freshest All-purpose flour possible, it made it too dry. The crust wasn't flakey as it should be it was a little tough, we made a pumpkin pie with this recipe for Christmas dinner. And it was a wonderful addition, the crust wasn't perfect. I have been experimenting with pastry recipes for one day, I intend to be a pastry chef, and must practice with new things all the time~ If you're trying to learn to bake, this may be a little too intermediate for you as far as cooking goes, but before that it works lovely, mixes up well, et cetera. If it sticks to your hands too much, then yours is too dry.

I love that you don't need flour to roll it out.  The less mess the better!

This was bland and fairly crumbly. It got the pie covered, but I definitely won't make it again. Next time, I will stick to shortening.

I love this crust recipe, and love that I don't have to buy shortening to make it. I will increase the recipe next time, because I didn't quite have enough dough to make my pie.

I followed the directions exactly, but it was hard to mix it into a ball. It kept falling apart, so I added a fourth more oil and milk each. It's in the fridge right now, so we'll see how it comes out.

Yes it is flakey, which is why it is getting 2 stars...  This crust is awful.  It tastes terrible, it is hard as a rock on the edges and it is very difficult to work with.  I used wax paper to roll it out to avoid absorbing extra flour (had to add extra milk to get it to stick together in a ball in the first place.)  I will still be looking for a good oil crust because this is not it.

Didn't much care for this one.  It seemed to asorb the filling and blend into the pie.  Had a bit of trouble getting it to roll out properly.
