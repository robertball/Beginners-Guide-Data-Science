Mmm ... good. My husband made this for dinner tonight, changing only the quantity of water. (He used less 'cause he doesn't like soupy beans.) Oh, and he didn't know we had ham, so he only used the ham hocks. Still, this was deee-lish. I actually had seconds, which I hardly ever do. Oh, and you have to cook them longer than 2 1/2 hours. Just test them every half hour or so after that, and throw the ham in when they're about done. BTW, if you cook dried beans to death and they are still gritty or mealy, it's because they're too old; even dried beans don't last forever. They have a moisture content that lessens with age. No recipe can make old beans taste good.

This soup turned out terrifically, but that's because I read all of the other reviews before making it, and attempted to fix the problems other people had noted:  (1) to get tender beans, I soaked the dry beans overnight, discarded the water, and made the soup  with fresh water, simmering for 2 hours--the beans were nice and tender; (2) to make the soup less watery, I used 6 1/2 cups water instead of 8--the soup turned out thick and hearty; (3) to avoid saltiness, I didn't add any salt, and used turkey ham instead of the traditional stuff, eliminating the ham hock as well (this may not have affected the saltiness, but it sure cut down on fat and calories).  It's an easy recipe to experiment with--have fun and enjoy!

Yep... this is pretty good (it's how I make mine).  But, why stop with Northern beans?  I use every kind of bean and dried pea I can get my hands on.  And I never take the time to soak my dried beans.  I "de-gas" them by just covering them with water, adding about a tablespoon of baking soda, and bringing them to a rolling boil - about 3 times.  After each boil, drain and run clean water over them to remove the husks.  Then add the rest of your ingredients and cook away!  You'll find the other beans/peas give your soup a much more "full" flavor.  And the "de-gassing" ... well... de-gasses them! LOL  Try it - I think you'll like it.

This is a good basic recipe with one improvement.  The secret to any good soup is the stock from which it is made.  So first, the ham stock should be made separately from any other ingredients because it takes a few hours to get the ham flavor fully out of a ham bone.  I would also use ham hocks in addition to (or in lieu of) the ham bone, because ham hocks have many joints and contribute a lot of protein richness to the stock.  A properly done stock will actually gel if stored in fridge - the gel is the protein not the fat.  Once the stock is made, you can strain it and toss the ham hocks and bone out because if done correctly, the flavor from the hocks and bones has now been transferred into the stock.

Once the stock is done, add the beans only, and cook till done.  Finally add the more tender ingredients like veggies and ham meat.  Cook as long as you like for your veggie tenderness.

Like any soup, it benefits from a night in the fridge before eating!

Excellent, excellent soup!  Use chicken broth (mostly), leave out the salt (my ham had enough), and cook in the crock pot (that's the easiest way, since the beans do have to cook a while).  I soaked the beans overnight, then put EVERYTHING in the crock pot and cooked from 9 - 5 on HIGH. Puree about 4 cups of mixture in blender around half way through and put back into pot (makes it creamier).  Add more broth/water if it's too thick.  Take out bay leaves and bone at the end, and cool for a little while if you want (will be really hot if you don't). Husband and kids 8 and 11 loved it. 6 yr old...well, she's still picky.

Oh my gosh!  I followed other reviewers advice and subbed 4 cups of chicken stock for water and was so surprised by how much flavor this soup has. I let it simmer several hours on super bowl sunday and it thickened up great. Even better next day.  This is THE best recipe I've tried here.

For years I've been craving the bean soup I used to get at a deli on the town square in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. I saw this recipe and had to give it a try. After reading the reviews, I decided to use the crockpot method recommended earlier. The result? A delicious, hearty, bean soup that my whole family enjoyed and has rated "a keeper". One note here: instead of ham hocks I used the bone from a spiral sliced ham (honey flavor). Enough meat was on the bone that I didn't need to add anymore, and it had a nice, smokey flavor.

Taking note of some of the comments on this soup, I soaked my beans overnight first, and did not add salt.  I do think it was plenty salty, and would have been too salty with added salt.

This is one of the best bean soups I have ever had, and was very easy to make.  I am not the best at soups, so I was thrilled with how simple this was, and how well it turned out.

The flavor of this wonderful soup is anything but basic.  I've made this twice so far and loved it both times.  To help make the beans soft, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the soaking water; it helps in breaking down the outer shell.  However, do remember to drain off the water with baking soda and use fresh water for making the soup.  I took two cups of the soup, pureed and added back into the soup to thicken it.

Great basic recipe.  I both bumped up the flavor and simplified prep as follows: Soaked the beans overnight in a crockpot (just covered with cold water), in the morning I drained the beans and returned them to the crockpot. In a skillet with a tablespoon of butter, I browned a roughly diced ham steak (didn't have a ham bone)with the chopped onions, garlic, celery and carrots. This took about 5 minutes. I then added the ham/veggies to the crockpot with all the spices and 8 cups of chicken broth (instead of water) and cooked all in the crockpot all day (10 hours) on low. Soup was fantastic, great flavor, not bland at all and very simple to prep. My husband says it is the best soup I have made this winter...and I make a lot of soup!

This soup was excellent. I used a shank ham bone to make the broth two days prior so I could skim all of the fat. I didn't add any salt, as the ham is salty enough. I bought a bag of "calico beans" which were great because of the variety of beans. I only soaked them for two hours before adding them to the broth and they came out very tender. Once the soup was almost done, I took out about half of the beans and pureed them in the food processor to make a thicker soup. It was perfect and delicious. Thanks!

Excellent bean soup!  I had a ham-hock left over from Easter and this worked out great!  I soaked white beans overnight and cooked all about 2 hours.  Wonderful!

If there were a contest for Ham and Bean Soup this would surely take 1st place!  I used one can each of navy beans, butter beans, black eyed peas (rinsed), and garbanzo beans.  Added 1/2 bag of baby carrots and one can of sliced boiled potatoes.  Pureed 1 cup of the soup and added back in (this is a must)!  I served this for a hearty dinner with a fresh loaf of Tuscany bread and a bottle of 2 Buck Chuck Chardonay. (traderjoes.com) Totally awesome!!My boyfriend said "smells good" the moment he hit the door.  Unfortunatley he "accidentally"?? took BOTH left over bowls to work today and I am still pouting! Thank you so much for a great recipe.  I am already contemplating asking everyone I know to save their ham hocks for me!

Here's a tip:  do not add the salt until after you have finished cooking the soup.  Cooking beans in salt results in a less than tender bean.  You may also find that adding the salt at the end will also decrease the cooking time for this recipe.

I really liked this soup! It had wonderful flavor, but I did make some alterations. I found that 1 hour soaking with hot water wasn't quite enough, so I put the beans in a pot with water to cover them with an additional 2 more inches of water. Then BOIL the beans for 5 minutes, take off from heat, and then let them sit for 1 hour. DRAIN the bean water off..To the stockpot ADD 64 ounces of chicken stock, the beans and all the rest of the ingredients, though I used more celery, about 5 ribs of celery. I also pureed about 1/3 of the soup and added it back to the pot, before adding the diced ham pieces. I found this soup to be QUICK, FLAVORFUL and SATISFYING..

This was beyond delicious. Made it with the following differences:  used 6 cups of chicken stock versus the 8 cups of water.  Didn't have bay leaves on-hand so used a tsp. of italian seasoning.  Used 3 stalks of celery and a spiral cut ham bone instead of the ham hock.  Soaked the beans in water for 6 hours, drained/rinsed the beans  Put all ingredients in a crock pot on low for 10 hours.  Excellent!.

This was fabulous~ with modifications. I always read other's reviews. DON'T add salt!! The ham hocks are essential for authentic bean soup. I used 4 cans of navy beans, 4 cups of chicken stock and 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth. 2 ham hocks, no other added meat. 3/4 cup carrot, 1/2 cup celery and an entire onion, carmelized. 2 t. garlic. Bought to a boil and simmered for an hour, removed hocks, cooled and seperated the meat out and added it back to the soup, simmered another 1/2 hour. Skimmed off the fat, mushed some beans against the side of the pot to add body to the soup. Near the end I added a couple dashes of hot chili sauce. Not enough to add heat, just round out the flavor. It was so good we ate it for 2 days. YUM!!!

This soup is my husband's and my absolute favorite soup to make on cold Sunday afternoons in the fall and winter. Even better, this soup is even more delicious the next day, because the soup thickens a bit and the flavors meld. We always make a loaf of honey wheat bread in our breadmaker and sit down to a simple supper of fresh bread and butter, and a bowl of this soup. It doesn't get any better than this! And don't forget the ham hock, it does add a wonderful smoky flavor to the soup. This soup also freezes very well, just reheat on your stove in a big pot. A BIG thanks for this recipe!!

"Make sure you give this one 5 STARS", my husband says!  Terrific recipe!!  Sometimes the simple recipes are the best.  I soaked the beans in water, but cooked them in chicken broth.  This is the only change I made to this recipe.  Thanks so much for this great classic!

Yummy! Made this with leftover Easter ham. I took some advise from previous reviews. Soaked beans over night and the next day drained, added fresh water and cooked about 2 hours before adding anything. I then added ham, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, dried mustard and bay leaves. I also took about a cup of beans and pureed them to make the sauce a bit thicker. It ws very good! I know because my husband said twice... "this is REALLY good"

Ok the only reason I have to give this 5 stars is because of the changes I made (don't get me wrong I am by no means a perfect cook) but I soaked the beans for 48 hours then I put it all in the crockpot and had it on low all day.  I added some Garlic Pepper as well as some Celery Salt it was pretty bland.  I just kept cooking it until it looks kinda like pea soup.  PS I tried to add a photo so you can see how it turns out..........Perfect comport food Thanks!

I made this for Soup Supper at our church last year and it was such a hit they asked for it again this year. I substituted some of the water with 97% Fat Free Chicken Broth which added to the flavor of the soup.

This was very tasty.  I made a few changes.  I soaked my beans overnight.  I put everything in the crockpot on low before I went to a brunch and it was done by the time I got back. There weren't enough carrots/celery/onions.  I ended up using 1 1/2c chopped onion, 2 stalks celery, chopped, and four carrots, sliced.  I also added more garlic. (I can't be the only person who saw '1 tsp' and scoffed.  We love garlic here!)It tasted a little flat so I also added one cube of bouillon, another 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and about a tablespoon of chipotle hot sauce.  It didn't make it spicy at all, just gave the soup some body. (It IS 8 cups of water!  A little hot sauce won't make it spicy, even for the little ones)  I also didn't add any chopped ham.  My ham hock had quite a lot of meat on it so after six hours in the crockpot, it fell right off the bone.  I shredded it and added it back to the pot.

I followed the recipe pretty closely as regards amounts, but 'adapted' the procedure.  I soaked the beans overnight (1 lb navy beans, 1 lb baby lima beans). Well yes, that's twice as many but I was doubling the recipe because I was using the leftovers and hambone from the Christmas ham. The dry mustard surprised me. I held off adding it until the broth was hot, then tasted it, and then added the mustard powder.  It did add just the right amount of additional positive flavor. Perhaps the most useful observation is how much better dried beans are.  I would tend to describe canned beans as 'mushy,' but the dried beans are best described as 'creamy.' I guess this 70 year old 'dog' can learn new tricks. In short, this soup is hearty, delicious, and more importantly, easy!

Very good recipe.  I don't usually change things up - not that brave.  But I read reviews and did the following:
3 celery stalks
4 c water/ 4 c chicken broth
I sauteed the onion, celery, garlic before adding. 
I also added a can of condensed milk - loved this addition.  Made it more creamy, thickened it.
I used the crock pot.  PUt beans in the boiling water, let sit for an hour.  Than cooked on high 4 hours,  OPened up, took the meat off the bone.  Cooked 3 more hours.  Opened, added more ham and milk. Let cook about an hour more.  Very good.

Used the quick soak method on the bag of beans, let sit for approx 2 hours and then put them in the crock pot with the ham bone. Added chicken broth as others suggested and omited the salt.  Turned out great.  (Incidentally, I used a frozen leftover ham bone with quite a bit of ham still on the bone.  The meat fell off the bone within a few hours in the crock pot. Yummy!)

This is a good hearty soup.  I boiled my beans first and then soaked them for 1-1/2 hours.  I substituted chicken broth for the water and threw it in my slow cooker.  I gave it a few pulses with my handmixer to thicken it up a bit.  I didn't have any celery, so I subbed celery salt.  Good flavor.  I'm planning on serving this with a fry bread also found on this site.  Thanks for sharing J.A.

I made a lot of changes... used a big thing of chicken broth instead of water, and 1.5 big cans of canned white beans. Sauteed 4 cloves of garlic with more celery (with leaves!!) and carrots and the onion, 2 ham hocks, then added 1/2 can of tomato paste (cause that's what grama did!!) the broth and beans.Totally delish!!!

I soaked beans overnight and added baking soda. I used half chicken broth and half water. I did not add any salt. I added extra onion, celery and carrots. I also added a little extra garlic. The ham hock and bay leaves give it such good flavor. I Let it simmer on the stove for hours. It smelled wonderful and tasted delicious !!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This was tasty. I didn't mess with the recipe except to use canned beans since I didn't have time to soak dry ones. Nice consistency when simmered long enough, not too watery. Lovely recipe, thank you.

I liked this!  I had never had Ham and Bean soup before but I wanted soup and had a leftover spiral cut ham bone.  Definitely soak the beans overnight.  I used the largest crock pot with chicken broth about 6.5 cups.  No salt, used black pepper.  2 cups carrots, 2 stalks celery.  I cooked it on HIGH for 6 hours, low for the first 4.  Carrots were too mushy for that but it seems like thats what it took to get the beans to cook.  Maybe add in carrots and celery later next time.

The soup was great, everybody in my family loved it. It was my first time making bean soup and it turned out excellent.  I think it might even be better then my grandmothers bean soup which is legendary.  I took some advice from other reviews.  I used 4 cups chicken broth in place of half the water.  I also soaked my beans over night. I used two smoked hocks along with my ham bone which I let simmer for six hours before discarding bone and fat.  I added one tsp of cayenne and eight oz. can of tomato sauce. I also took the advice to add more vegtables then the recipe called for.  I added three potatoes cut into small wedges. Let it simmer all day and you will have one of the best bean soups ever.

Delicious! Even my fussy child liked it.  I altered this recipe a bit though. I bought the big glass jar of ready mixed beans and intermixed the recipe on that label with this one.  Did 6 cups of beef broth, added tsp of mustard powder, salt, pepper, can of green beans, can of roasted chopped tomatoes, cubed ham, chopped bunch of green onions, garlic, and the 2 bay leaves)

Loved this recipe! Before adding the ham, I put 2 cups of the beans in a blender and pureed it, returning it to the pot.  Then I added the ham and continued cooking it.  The puree made the soup creamy without the added calories.

My family loved it!  Thank you to all the reviewers. I used several of your suggestions.... I used 3 cans of northern beans to save time and just drained them.  I doubled the veggies.  I used half water and half chicken broth but I did need all 8 cups of liquid.  And in the last half hour I added a little potato leftovers to thicken it.  Oh yes, I also used a tbsp. of regular mustard since I didn't have powder.  Thanks again everyone!!!

Fantastic bean soup! Made only a couple changes, boiled the beans in large pot of water for 10 min.with 1/2 tsp. baking soda then soaked overnight-drained and rinsed in morning.(I hate hard beans) I used a leftover honey baked ham bone from our christmas party. Used 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken broth. 1 tsp. garlic powder instead of garlic clove. No celery-only because i dislike it cooked. placed all in crockpot on low before I left for work. The only bad part was I didn't get to smell it cooking all day. Very, very good.

Everyone loved this soup, even my 11 year old daughter.  I did subsitute 4 cups of vegetable broth for half of the water and I used a bit more carrots and celery than stated in the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent recipe.  I substituted ham broth for the water, however, and also opted for the crock-pot method.  De-gasing the beans before hand allowed the beans to become very soft, and I found it was not necessary to puree a portion of the soup this way.  I also used a good bit more ham, and sauteed the ham prior to adding it to the soup with about 1 Tbsp. olive oil, 1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, 1/2 tsp. ginger and about 1 Tbsp. honey.  I then added the whole saute directly to the soup.  Delicious!

This recipe was the terrible!  Even after soaking the beans overnight, they were still crunchy and this reminded me why I don't eat ham.  Definitely would not recommend this to anyone

Just made this today.  Delicious, followed the recipe as written.  Not necessary to soak beans overnight or boil bones longer as I read in other comments.  Beans are tender and ham flavour is wonderfully infused with the times and instructions provided.

I tried this soup this evening, and really liked it. My husband usually doesn't care for ham and bean soup, but he polished off two bowlfuls! I didn't want to make a pond of soup for just us two without knowing if it was good, so more or less halved the recipe.  Also I made it easier by using canned beans.  I had bought an almost ten-pound presliced bone-in ham and had sliced off and used most of it, but there were a couple of cups of meat left on the bone (which wasn't very large).  At the suggestion of some commenters, I simmered the ham bone for about an hour in 4 - 5 cups water with two bay leaves. (No added salt was needed, but I threw in a few grinds of pepper.) Meanwhile, I cut up a heaping cup of the ham, reserving the rest for later.  I drained and rinsed a 14 1/2 can of great northern beans (navy or lima beans would do, I should think) and let them simmer with the ham bone.  I cut up three carrots, peeled; three trimmed celery ribs; and half a large onion; and sauteed the vegetables for 5-10 minutes in a little cooking oil, in the bottom of a larger pot.  I added a minced garlic clove for a minute, then added the chopped-up ham, along with 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, and sauteed for a bit.  Then I poured the ham bone, beans, and water into the sauteed stuff, and simmered the mixture for about 45 minutes.  (You may need to add more hot water.)  Mm. I'm saving this recipe!

I had the bone left over from our Christmas ham and wanted to make a ham and bean soup so decided to try this recipe. I thought it was very good and I only made a couple of modifications. I prefer to soak my beans overnight so I skipped the first step; although the instructions on the bag of beans matched the first step of this recipe, so I'm sure either way is fine.  Secondly, I used 4 cups beef broth and 4 cups water. I had enough meat that came off the bone that I didn't need.to add any more. Finally, I prefer a thicker soup so I took out 1 to 2 cups of the soup mixture and pureed it, then added it back to the soup. This one is now part of my recipe box.

Awesome recipe - perfect soup recipe.  I made this in my slow cooker, using a leftover ham bone, and added about 2 cups of leftover cubed ham.  This was easy and everyone raved about it.

This is a very tasty soup! Like most of the other readers, I altered some of the directions: I soaked the beans overnight,omitted the white pepper (could'nt find it!), added seasoning salt and black pepper towards end of cooking time, and did not add extra ham (there was alot of meat on my ham bone). I also cooked my soup on simmer for at least six hours because I wanted the soup to be really thick and hearty. I loved the flavor, my kids picked at it, and my husband liked it but he's not real big on soup.  Will definately make again!

My family could not get enough of this soup.  It was even requested for the annual snowmobiling trip to keep the guys warm.  The only change I made was to do half chicken stock and water, and cook it in the crockpot overnight.  Instead of chopped leftover ham, I used a meaty ham bone saved just for this occasion.  This is a simple meal great for cold winter nights.

I made this back in Dec. when my sister and her family were visiting and I had a ham bone in the freezer waiting to be used.  I soaked the beans overnight, and used some chicken broth (I think I only had one can) in place of some of the water.  It was so delicious!  Everybody loved it!  I'm wishing I had a ham bone right now, because this soup would really  hit the spot on this cold, snowy day.  Yum, yum!

This is the best Ham and Bean Soup I have come across.  I make this recipe often, especially when a taste for Ham and Bean Soup comes over my family.  It is soo good!!

I changed this recipe to include baby lima beans as well as the great northerns.  As suggested by other reviewers, I soaked the beans overnight instead of using the "quick-cook" method.  I also used chicken stock instead of water and added liberal amounts of celery and carrot.  This is such an EASY soup to make, and it freezes well.  A fantastic way to use up the rest of my Christmas ham.

This recipe is good. I added just these minor changes.  used a ham bone. Used a whole  onion and also added two cut up slices of bacon and ham base.  when you can't find the onion your soup is done.  Simmered about five hours.  The ham base was all the sodium i needed so didn't add any. After I took out the bone (most of the meat had fallen off) I cooled it and my Australian Shepherd had a fabulous and healthy chewy for himself. Kove this soup

I use "mixed beans" in a bag and it really is so much better than bland Northern.
I use both, ham hocks and I buy a small chunk or "real ham" on the bone.
If you buy these packages of "pre cut diced ham", DO NOT.
There is no flavor in them, and they "just don't produce the same results and flavor".
Plus, "they make your soup look fake with these "perfect square cubes!' floating around.
But seriously, the flavor is "just not the same". Do not forget the "smocked ham hocks", because "that IS the secret ingredient to a fine tasting Bean soup.
I do add, diced onion, celery, and carrots.
Be real careful with your salt, wait till almost finished and taste the soup.
The reason for this is because both the ham hocks & Ham are cured with salt. I also mix "low sodium chicken broth" with equal parts of  water( for the broth base)
Just be careful and watch your salt.
Freezes well.

Wonderful Soup !!  Kept pretty much to the recipe...tho..did saute onions, celery and minced garlic in butter prior to adding and did substitute chicken stock for 3/4 of the water..plus twice as much veggies along with three small diced white rose potatoes as well...and added some potato flakes to thicken a bit at the end - increased white pepper by double but added no salt - cooked in crockpot all day first few hrs on high..then the rest on low..about 10 hrs total - house smelled heavenly all day and the soup was just to die for !! (used 3 cans small white beans...drained and rinsed) Simply Excellent !!

This is a very good, basic recipe.  As written, I am rating it 4 stars as I found the result to be very bland.  The next time I made it, I used a 20 oz. bag of 15 bean soup mix beans, chicken broth instead of water, and the meaty leftover ham bone from a spiral sliced Holiday Ham along with a chunk of pork jowl bacon.  Still found the result to be bland until I decided to add the Cajun seasoning packet that comes in the 15 bean mix and simmer longer.  That did the trick - not too spicey at all, rather just enough "something extra" to give the soup a lot more flavor.  We all loved it and agreed that it should get 5 stars made this way.  Still, this is a great basic ham and bean soup recipe that you can adjust to suit your own taste.  Oh, and I tried the reviewer suggestion of bringing the dried beans to a boil with a tablespoon of baking soda 3 separate times (and rinsing) to "de-gas" the beans.  I had such high hopes for this; but, alas, it did not work at all - for any of us :(

Good basic recipe.  I also used chicken broth (my homemade stock so it's low sodium) for 1/2 the water and used more carrots, onion & celery than the recipe called for.  I didn't use a ham bone so I added some ham base and left out the salt called for.  Also didn't use the mustard - didn't sound right but maybe I should have tried it.  I will make this one again.

We've tied many ham + bean soups before, but this one is by far the best!  We added larger amounts of carrots + celery than called for in the recipe + omitted the onion altogether, but only due to personal preferences. The only truly important note I might add is to be sure to increase the bean soaking and cooking  time to 3-4 hrs for soaking, 2-3 hrs for cooking. After trying so many ham + bean soup recipes, we've learned a few things - one of them is that 60 min.s is just not enough soaking time for beans. That said, this recipe really is the best - and so easy! Thanks very much for sharing it!

This recipe is great and easy.  One simple suggestion: do not add salt until the beans have cooked for an hour or more.  Salt keeps the bean tough.

This was delicious and easy.  To save even more time, I threw the veggies in whole and pureed them in a small food processor after the soup was done, then added the puree to the broth.  It makes for a thicker broth and my kids, who seem to have an aversion to vegetables, don't even know. I also added a 1/2 cup diced tomatoes and a 1/4 cup cooked spinach to the puree for added flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great soup.  I liked it even better the next day.  My daughter (5), who usually won't eat anything with beans, even liked it.  My 3 year old wouldn't touch it.  I soaked my beans the night before and simmered them all day.  I did not add the salt and it was plenty salty.  We will definitly make this again.  So good and so easy!

I basically combined this recipe and another that I found online that was quite similar.  Here’s what I did.  I soaked the beans overnight.  I used 7 1/2 cups of chicken broth, no water, a ham shank and one cup each of the carrots, celery and onions.  I used all of the other ingredients except the additional chopped ham.  My ham shank had quite a bit of ham on it, which was plenty.   I started by sauteeing the carrots, celery and onions in about 3 T. of butter and then added the rest of the ingredients, except the salt.  I kept this at a low simmer for 3 - 3 1/2 hours. I simmered covered for the first 2 1/2 hours and then took the lid off so it would cook down and get a little thicker.  My version yielded 9 cups of soup.  Hubs loves bean soup and gave this two thumbs up!  A definite do again!

I followed some of commenter's suggestions and threw everything into the slow cooker after soaking the beans overnight. I didn't have any bay leaves and only added about half the salt. It turned out great. Plus, it made my whole house smell delicious! What a nice way to be greeted when I walked through the door. Perfect way to use up leftover ham.

My husband and two children raved about this recipe.  Normally one of my children will like a recipe and the other will give it a "thumbs down," but not in this case!  Yea!  It will go on the "Kids Like List."  I followed the recipe with these alterations: 6 cups homemade chicken broth instead of the water; one tsp. chicken broth base instead of the salt; and one ham bone left over from Easter instead of the ham hock.  Oh, I also used a homemade batch of mixed dried beans instead of just the Great Northern.  I soaked them overnight in my slowcooker, drained and rinsed them and then cooked the soup for about 8 hours on low.  I will definitely make this again and will probably use it for my freezer meal exchanges.

Was excellent! I used leftover spiral ham bone with meat on it, added 4 chicken bouillon cubes and omitted bay leaves and mustard since I didn't have any plus I used 2 lbs of mixed dried beans. I quick soaked the beans for an hour and then rinsed off that water and used fresh water to cook the bean and soup. Best I've ever made!

This is a GREAT basic starter recipe, first I started with stock made from a honey store chicken, then used some better then bouillon paste. I added a bit more water cup or so, I used two cans of great northern beans, and crushed 3 cans of Cannellini Beans to help thicken. I also used an Immersion Blender and ran around the pot 3 or4 times which ground up some of all the ingredients just a pinch of salt. Honey baked ham, roasted red peppers, onion, two cans of roasted tomatoes, pepper, garlic, bay leaf, carrots, no celery hate those things. I had read another review about dry bean not lasting forever, I had started this soup with my old beans and it dawned on me all these years I had made soup with dry beans and had to soak and cook them for a week before I could get them the least bit palpable so thanks very much for this bit of information that dry beans not last forever I guess they had been sitting way to long in some warehouse.

Delicious!  Served with cheese biscuits for a perfect winter meal.  The only thing I did different was use a 16-bean mix and substituted half the water with chicken broth.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This ham and bean soup was delicious!  I followed some other reviewers' suggestions and bought a bag of mixed dried beans. I used the quick soak method and it worked fine.  I put the leftover bone from our Christmas spiral ham along with all the other ingredients in the crock pot for 8 hours on low. Along with a loaf of Italian bread we had a hearty meal for a cold winter night!

I was searching for a use for the left over Honey Baked Ham we had.  I was skeptical but thought I would try this... WOW!!!!  My husband can't stop talking about how good this soup was and even my kids (6, 4 and 18 months) gobbled it up and asked for more.  This week I am buying another ham for the sole purpose of making this soup again! Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

Wonderful! Just the way I remember it growing up. Suggestions: If you buy dry beans, DEFINATELY soak them overnight. Another review had suggested that. I used low-sodium chicken broth in place of water. I cooked the beans in the broth for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours or till tender. Try a smoked ham hock if available. It gives it a nice hearty fall feel. I also added 2 teaspoons of tomato paste for color & a little extra flavor. Yummmy!

I made this in my crock pot and it turned out great.  I used 2 cartons of low sodium chicken broth, almost an entire turkey ham, carrots, onions, celery, bay leaves, mustard powder and pepper.  Cooked on high for about 7 hours and served with cornbread.  Be sure to soak the beans over night.

This was the best bean soup I have made. Did follow the advice of others and pureed about 2 cups of the beans to thicken and used chicken stock in place of water. Everything else I followed exactly and it was wonderful.

Great soup!  My teenager loves it and my non-soup eating husband enjoys it too.  I soak the beans overnight; use 6 cups of low-sodium chicken broth and 1 cup vegetable broth, no additional salt, and extra vegetables.  I have used spiral ham bones, smoked turkey legs and wings.  I throw everything in the stockpot and let it simmer until the turkey is falling off the bone, 2 to 3 hours, then remove meat/bones and shred, returning meat to pot.  I have always pureed half the beans but I didn’t last time and hubby said he liked it better that way.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Was excited to make this soup to use up some leftover ham, then found out that someone had eaten the ham I'd planned to use! So I made this soup MEATLESS and it turned out soooo good,lower in fat and much healthier! I sauteed the veggies in a bit of olive oil, then dumped in 1 lb of navy beans I'd soaked overnight and most of the next day (drained & rinsed). I added 2 cans of chick. broth, 1 can veg. broth, a cup and a half of water, & about a tsp of garlic powder in lieu of the fresh garlic, and the other seasonings (left out the salt). To give it the smoky flavor I would have gotten from the ham, I added about a tsp. of liquid smoke. Cooked all for about 2 hours and it turned out to be the best bean soup I've ever made!

Wonderful recipe for left-over  ham! I followed the recipe & put the whole ham bone in to cook along with the beans, veggies & seasonings.I used canned chicken broth instead of water for more flavor. When the soup is done,pour about 1/3 of it into a food processor or blender & puree it, then add it back to the soup. We thought it had a much better texture because it thickened it up. My husband had three bowls of it at one sitting!!!!!
You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Excellent and freezes well.  I didn't have a ham bone or ham hocks, so I just added a tablespoon  of chicken "Better than Bouillion" paste.  I didn't find 8 cups to be too much water -- maybe others cook the beans covered that will keep them thinner.  Toward the end I mash about a cup of the beans (same as I do for red beans).   The cooking time was longer - even after an overnight soak I simmered them for about 4 hours.  Kept some for immediate and froze a couple of containers for future lunches.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

Very tasty, and I am not usually a fan of soups.  After reading reviews made the following adjustments: 1. soaked beans for 6 hours, then discarded soak water and made soup with fresh. 2. used 6 cups of liquid (1 can low sodium chicken stock, the rest water). 3. used leftover bone with meat from a honey ham. 4. Added NO salt 5. combined all ingredients into crock pot and cooked for 10 hours on low (overnight). 6. pureed about 1 cup of the beans and some of the broth, and combined back into pot. RESULTS: beans were breaking down - cooked too long. Otherwise it is amazing.  glad I added the chicken stock instead of all water, but did not add any salt.  I love the "extra" flavor of the honey ham - that flavor, along with pureeing the beans, makes it look/taste very rich.

This soup turned out to be everything I hoped it would!  Just had a bowl for lunch with some homemade bread and it was delicious.  I made a few small changes:  First, I soaked the beans overnight, then rinsed them.  I had about 5 cups of homemade chicken stock on hand which I brought up to 8 cups by adding fresh water.  Instead of a ham hock, I had two large ham bones I'd frozen after a couple of nice holiday dinners.  I cooked the soup as directed in the recipe, just adding a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper.  After an hour of simmering, I removed the ham bones and cut off any meat that hadn't already fallen off.  This gave me plenty of ham and I didn't need to add more.  I also took out a couple of cups of the cooked beans to puree, then added them and the chopped ham back to the pot.  Simmered another half hour, and everything was perfectly cooked.  The result was a thick, rich, flavorful soup.  Luckily, no one else in my family likes beans so I get to freeze this soup in single servings and enjoy quite a few hearty lunches in the future!

I gave this a 3 because I feel like I simply must have done something wrong. I used hamhocks, lots of tender loving care went into this and what I got was bland enough that I tossed the lot.  Otherwise I'd have clocked this a 1 star. I really tried to get this rocking but it was just not to be. In retrospect, I think this needed some more veggies and some sugar, just a little. I'll look a little further afield.

The soup itself tasted pretty good, but it ravaged my husband and I's tummy for more than a day after eating it. I guess dried northern beans are one bean we need to stay away from!

Great! Made in slow cooker, 2 hours on high and 5 hours on low. Out of celery so used celery salt.  Used half water and half chicken stock. Added potato flakes as suggested to thicken liquid.  Also used Lawry's Seasoned Pepper instead of white pepper. Will definitely make again!

This turned out really good, however I did make some changes.  I soaked the beans for about 7 hours, then put everything in the crockpot on high.  I did not have a ham hock, so added 1 c extra ham.  I used 4 c chicken broth & 4 c water, added extra garlic & also did not have any celery.  After about 3 hours on high the beans were still crunchy & the soup was very bland.  So I added some spices, garlic powder, seasoned salt, paprika & red pepper and put it in the fridge overnight. Then put on low the next day for 6-7 hours.

I thought this was very good, used half low-sodium chicken stock and pureed half the soup before adding the ham to make it really creamy and delicious.

This was a great basic recipe for bean soup!  I followed the advice of others & used chicken broth instead of water, used calico beans (which I soaked overnight according to the directions on package), left out the salt and pureed 2 cups at the end for thickening.  I cooked on high in the crock pot for 9 hrs.  It made a lot, so i am going to freeze it in single servings for later.

This bean soup is OK. I followed the recipe, except I prepared in my crock pot. I did soak my beans overnight, using a 1/2 tsp. baking soda as suggested. I thoroughly rinsed the beans and tossed them in the crock pot with all of the ingredients. I went shy on the water, only using 6 cups instead of 8. After all day in my crock pot the beans were nice and tender. However it still tastes a little bland. I try adding more salt and pepper, but nothing. We crushed in saltine crackers, but still a thin soup and bland, no real flavor. I will NOT be fixing this again.

I love bean  soup and have been making it for a very long time.  This one is the best yet.  I used chicken broth & water.  The ham hock was pretty good size and yielded enough ham for the pot.  I put everything in the crock pot, set it on high for 1 hour then on low for 6 1/2 hours.  At the 5 hour mark, I removed the hock skinned and removed the meat.  Returned ham to pot.  I used no salt, but did chop up a jalapeno pepper in it. I would highly recommend this soup.

I used a slow cooker on low for 8 hours. Per previous reviews, I used chicken stock instead of water and eliminated the salt. To thicken, 1/2 way into cooking process I took some liquid and beans and blended them.  I added 1 tsp white pepper and 2 packets of Slenda to amp up the flavor.  My poor easter ham was overcooked (by 90 minutes! - oops), and the ham bone was not very meaty.  To compensate, I added some of the drippings from the original cooking of the ham (less the fat, of course).  The base was still less thick than we wanted, so I put the soup on the stove and reduced for 30 minutes prior to serving.  I added onion, carrots and a bit of corn starch/water mix.  It thicken up beautifully.  When setting it to boil prior to serving, I added the chopped ham & onion.  The end result was wonderful.  Perfect thickness for our taste, cooked but not pulverized onions & carrots, juicy ham pieces, and subtle but robust flavor.

This turned out very well and was a perfect way to use up leftover ham and the ham bone from Christmas.  I used a 15-bean mixture instead of just Great Northern Bean, and I did as some of the others and simply put everything in the crockpot for ~8 hours.  Yum!  And it was enough to freeze about half for later.  :-)

I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water per other memeber's recommendations. Soaked beans overnight and rinsed in the am. I brought all ingredients except chopped ham and white pepper to a boil and then simmered for 1 hour. I then discarded the ham hock and transferred everything else to the crockpot, added the ham and pepper and cooked on high for about 4 hours and then low for 2 more. It was pretty good.

I'll be honest, I made this soup because my husband wanted it but it was really good.  Like other reviewers I made some changes too.  I used a 7 bean mix, did mine in the crockpot (HI 9 hours) minus the ham hock.  I decreased the water to 6.5 cups and added 4 bullion cubes, I also pureed 4 cups of the soup half way through the cooking.  Next time I will keep the 8 cups of water and not puree half of the soup plus I'll cook it for fewer hours.

What a great and easy recipe.  I didn't have any ham hocks so I went without, I still think this was really good without them.  Next time I will plan ahead and make sure I follow the recipe exactly with them to see how the difference is.  We will be enjoying this one very soon.

This recipe was so good! I used a 15 bean mix instead of the great northern beans. I also cut down some of the water to 5 cups (partly because it didn't fit in my crockpot and partially to have a thicker soup). I also added 3 chicken boulion cubes. I started the soup on low in my crockpot at around 8am, took the hambone out at around 2, for the last hour I turned it up to high to soften some of the beans and ate at 5:30. I thinkened it up with some corn starch. I really wished I had some french bread with it. Highly recommended! My mother-in-law (who is a staint) really liked it and asked for the recipe.

We liked this soup.  I couldn't make it as written because I didn't have a ham bone (just chopped cooked ham) so it might have been lacking in some flavor but it made a great meal, nonetheless.  I also had to use pinto beans instead but they seemed to work just fine.  I crumbled some bacon over the top just before serving.  The next day this was so thick and flavorful--it was great over rice!  Yum.

Very nice soup. The only thing I did different was to add about 2 more cups of water, and I blended about 2 cups of the beans, ham, and veggies and added back to the soup to make a little thicker and it gave it a little more taste.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe word for word, but this is a wonderful starting point!  I soaked the beans for about 8 hours before adding them to a crockpot with 2 smoked ham hocks, as well as just chunks of ham.  I increased the amount of carrots, celery and onions and for the liquid I used water and chicken broth to reach the 8 cups needed.  After stirring it all together, I let it cook overnight (about 9 hours) and set it to warm until lunch.  It was delicious!  I might soak the beans for less time when I make it again, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  I made the recipe for Homesteader Cornbread from this site, and I will definitely be making the two recipes together again in the future.

Very good! I soak the beans 1/2 day + over night and added in red beans as well and used a spicy brown mustard, chicken broth & shredded/tore the ham up. At first I threw everyting in the crockpot, but ran out of time, so put it on the stove for 1 hr to finish up. I didn't add much salt at all tot he seasonings, but found it to be too salty for my tastes.

The flavor on this was great, but I made it with the directions exactly as written and the beans were not even close to done at the end of an hour and a half. I let it go 2 more hours, and still pretty crunchy beans. I then put it in the refrigerator overnight, and then cooked it in the slowcooker all day long the next day. That worked and then the beans were maybe just a little overdone. If I make it again I will soak the beans overnight, and then put all the ingredients in the slow cooker for the day.

I had a little trouble with the beans not being tender. I'd soaked them overnite, then cooked the soup for two hours...not quite enough time. Otherwise I thought it was a good recipe, and I'll repeat it with a few adjustments. I pureed some of the beans and used less water, omitted the salt and tripled the celery...good flavor.

Delicious! I also did what other reviewers did and used 8 cups of chicken stock instead of water. I did not use salt. I used just a dash of the white pepper. The house smelled heavenly. Real comfort food! When my husband came home from work he wanted to eat immediately. He loved it.

This was wonderful. Like many other reviewers I soaked the beans longer and used veggie broth instead of water. My son usually eats all of his bread first with any dinner. When I served this soup he didn't touch his bread because he was too full from all the soup he ate.

Tasty and simple to make.  I used a left-over ham hock and substituted chicken broth.  I am historically not a fan of white bean soups, but this was very tasty!

This was yummy and really easy. The only thing I did different was puree half of it before adding the ham to make it thicker since we like it that way.

I am not into bean soups but was looking to branch out so I tried it.  I replaced half the water with chicken broth and soaked the beans over night.  The soup came out nice and thick and very tasty!  I also didn't have a ham bone to put in it and it came out great anyhow.

YUM!  Simple to make.  I think next time, I will use great northern canned beans to save time in that area, and I will also use some chicken bouillon to give it a bit more flavor!  Thanks for sharing J.A.!

This was good, however the second time I made it with homemade vegtable broth instead of water and it turned out much better.  I really think it was worth the extra effort.

Very tasty recipe, also make the house smell good.  However, next time I will use canned white beans instead, the dry beans were hard.  I used my hand held mixer to puree some of the soup, gave it a kind of thickness.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my very favorite soup! I wait all year for fall and winter so I can make a huge batch of this deliciousness. Of course I made some changes, but as a guideline this soup is fab. I double the amount of carrots as I like the sweetness they add, and 3 stalks of celery. I like to boil/high simmer my meaty ham bone in a stock pot for a few hours, boiling down the water until it gets to about 8 cups or so. I also throw in any of the gelled orange protein from the pan I originally baked the ham in. This step really makes the soup for me! The ham flavor is out of this world. I like to throw it all in a crock pot so I don't have to watch it, which is an added bonus for this recipe. At the end I blend a few cups and throw it back in to make it creamy.. If it turns out too thick, I throw in some chicken stock. I skip the salt until the very end and add as I see fit.. The ham and potential chicken stock is so salty, I usually don't need to add any extra. 

This is the ultimate in ham and bean soup. You won't regret it!

I used a bag of 15 bean soup mix, minus the season packet, and used the quick cook method instead of soaking.  I cooked the ham bone in with the beans the entire time.  Didn't have mustard powder, so used a few table spoons of spicy brown bottled mustard.  The flavor was a little flat for my taste, so I added several large spoon fulls of pan drippings from the cooked ham and a few shakes of smoked paprika and POW!!  KILLER flavor!!  This is definitely the best pot of beans I have made in years with just a few minor tweeks to the recipe.

We found this soup to have no flavor at all. Was a big disappointment and waste of my time.

I made this soup today and it is great. I was looking for a recipe like my dad always made for us at home. I cooked two ham hocks and used the broth to soak the beans overnight using 9 cups of the broth. Simmered it for 2 hours and I will say this is one of the best soups my wife and I have ever tasted. Thank you for the recipe and for the great memories of my Dad.

We had this for dinner tonight, and my husband and daughter (who both hate ham, but like beans) had second servings. I forgot to use the bay leaves and pepper, which would make this even better. I used the bone from a spiral sliced ham I made for a work event earlier in the week instead of a ham hock. I used low sodium chicken broth in place of the water.   I soaked the beans overnight on "keep warm" in my crockpot, then drained them before putting all ingredients in the crockpot on LOW all day.  I removed the bone in the evening, and put the full crock in the fridge overnight.  In the morning, I skimmed a lot of fat from the surface, then put the crock on low to warm through.   I will make this next time I have a leftover ham bone.

A nice solid soup. I soaked the beans overnight in the unheated crockpot. In the morning I drained them, put in fresh water and the turned the heat on with the ham hock and seasonings. It stewed all day and was very yummy. I did add extra carrots because we can never have too many veggies. Will make again!

I liked it, but I wound up adding a lot more of all the spices to give it more flavor. I also served with cottage cheese and salsa on top. Would be great with garnish of chopped fresh tomatoes and green onions as well. (I soaked beans in cold crockpot overnight with baking soda, then rinsed in the morning, added rest of ingredients, and cooked 4hrs.)

I always add a little tomato juice and some ketchup. I use half water and half chicken broth. I also add just a little cajun  seasoning.  Never add salt until done and then add if you need to. It always takes almost 2 hours to get it really tender.
If you add some potato, it's the Senate version.  I usually just add some instant potato flakes which also thickens  it up.

Excellent flavor, easy to make.  I wasn't able to soak my beans overnight, so I put them in boiling water for 2 minutes then turned them off  and let them sit for 1 hour, then continued with the recipe.  Turned out GREAT!

This was SO yummy!  I cannot understand how other reviewers find this bland--this was SO flavorful and I even forgot to add the mustard powder (oops!).  I used the leftover ham bone from our Christmas brunch (I used the Tangy Honey Glazed Ham recipe from this site); it made for a scrumptious soup!  I'd never cooked dried beans before and this turned out great.  I did add cooking time to every step; I had a lot to do around the house and figured the extra time couldn't hurt.  I did mash some beans and add a potato to thicken it up.  Next time around (and there WILL be a next time) I'll try some of the tips for de-gassing the beans. ;-)  Even so, this soup's flavor makes it totally worth the burpy aftermath.

Really tasty soup but waaaaay too many beans. I used half the amount of beans, much better the second time around. Secondly, I used 1/2 chicken stock, 1/2 water. Thirdly, I cooked and then chilled the soup in the fridge overnight, and skimmed the fat off the next morning. Ham is quite fatty, and I pulled a LOT of fat off.

This was a great basic recipe.  I'm a huge white bean fan but had never once made them from dry.  It was a cinch!  After the 60 minutes of soaking, I returned the beans to a boil, added the remaining ingredients and left in my slow cooker for several hours on low.  The carrots were tender, the celery and onions were perfect. Kids and hubby loved. I did add a teaspoon of italian seasoning which gave a nice flavor.

Splendid and cherished recipe! I've been looking for my mother's  recipe for this for ages--all her recipes were in her head and were lost after her passing. I've never adequately recreated it at home. Now I realize it's that mustard powder which finesses it--I'd never have thought to add that ingredient. It's a wonderful soup. Thank you for restoring a precious memory!

Amazing.  Easy.  Soak your beans over night and you can skip the first step of boiling your beans for 60 minutes prior to beginning the 60 minute simmer with the ham hock.

Excellent recipe.. I dont lessen the water, but I do add 2 potatoes (diced) towards the end of cooking to help give it a little starch and thicken it to more of a stew.  I am not a celery fan, so I use 1 tsp celery seed in place of celery.  If you have a good meaty ham hock you dont need to add any more ham! YUM. good comfort food

I looked up this recipe last night, I read all the reviews, I used the suggest too use chicken broth and I'm very glad I did it gave this soup lots of flavor, I cooked the beans in water for 60 mins. Then poured that water out, then put the chicken broth in pan bought it to a boil then added beans, ham bone and the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 1 1/2hours This came out so good ( this is the first time I have ever made this) so easy, I would do it again.

I made this yesterday and followed the recipe exactly, except I used dry Pinto Beans.  It was fantastic!  My honey devoured it!  He's got a nice helping for lunch today, and I have a little as well.  This will be a staple in our house!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a nice basic recipe that can be made with a lot of variations. I thought it needed a bit more spice so I doubled up on the mustard powder and white pepper, as well as added a little onion powder. I soaked the beans overnight and discarded the water, using fresh water for cooking.  Instead of cooking this on the stove, I used the slow cooker - the result was amazing flavor and creamy beans!

Great recipe and not so difficult to prepare. In order to make it even tastier I added a few slices of jamoniberico de bellota  - aka iberico ham or patanegra- thinly cut. Because iberico has a strong and delicious flavor you do not need much, only 50 grams or 1.8 OZ for four people added once the soup is finished.  You can buy your jamoniberico at BuyJamon.com  BuyJamon.com buy jamoniberico online and have it delivered to your door.

Soaked the beans overnight, discarded the water and did the slow cooker method. I think next time I will just try making it in the pan as the beans were overcooked and made more of a creamy soup.

Turned out delicious! Very full of flavor. Used a 10-bean blend and leftover ham bone. I only used ~4 cups of water and it was perfectly soupy. I cooked overnight in my crockpot--about 7 1/2 hours--and it was perfect.

This is just a wonderful recipe.  I have not had ham and beans for years, and my family had never had.  Made the changes recommended by ROGAMIL-soaked the beans overnight, rinsed, and cooked with fresh water. Reduced the fresh water to 6.5 cups to make thicker. Did not add any salt. Yummmm.

My family loves this soup.  My son and I are pretty picky eaters and my wife doesnt usually eat soup.  Within 2 weeks of having this soup both my wife and son were asking to have it again.  I cooked mine in the slow cooker for the ease.  Other than that the only other thing i did differently was to add prepared mustard instead of ground.  I was out of ground.  It was still the best ham and bean soup I have ever tasted

Fantastic!!..once I added some chicken boullion and a little garlic powder.  I crocked Navy beans, ham hock and water on high for 4 hours then added the rest, minus ham for 3 more hours.  Didn't have ham and didn't miss it.  It tastes almost like Campbells Bean and Bacon..my favorite as a kid.  I am shocked...the toddlers are eating it, "Hey Mikey!"  For a nostalgic treat, crushed Ritz crackers on top....Yum!!

This is good, I prepared the beans by letting them soak over night then through everything in the crockpot for the day, except I didn't have any extra diced ham to add, but it still had wonderful flavor from the ham hocks.  I did pull half the soup out of the pot and pureed it for a thicker heartier soup.  Hubby and daughter both loved it.  I'll be putting this one in the keeper pile and it will be in my regular winter rotation.

I was looking for a basic recipe and Basic Ham and Bean Soup is a perfect started.  I used comments from others and added a few of my own tricks.  Thank you to J. A. McConville for submitting this recipe!    To save time I used 2 cans of Sylvia's Pinto beans and the liquid rather than cooking my own beans.    As other suggested I substituted 1/2 the water for chicken stock and I fried the onions (used 1 1/2 cups of onion) with a few pieces of bacon. I also added one chopped potato with a little more equal parts water and stock to ensure I had enough broth.  Thank you also to "allrecipes.com" for providing a great place to post recipes and allow others to add their comments and ideas!  Perfect for a cold winter dinner - will definitely make again!

It is very BASIC.  There is no "ump" in the soup.  I followed the advice of others and pre soaked the beans over night.  It was ok and very bland.  I'm not one who likes bold flavors, but this was terribly bland.  I won't make it again.

This was FANTASTIC!! my whole family loved it!!! I used half great northern beans and half lima beans just because that is what I had in my pantry.  I added half tsp of dried tyme just because tyme always makes soup taste better and I mashed about a cup of the beans half way through to make the soup creamier and thicker. It worked out great. I recommend making this with cornbread and try doing what I learned from my grandparents. They add a little vinegar and chopped raw onions to their bowl of soup right before they eat it. I tried it with this and it was very tasty. :)

My family LOVES when I cook with Great Northern and/or Navy beans. And, yet, in 40+ years of cooking, I had never before used "hocks" in my preparations. But my supermarket had them on sale ($0.99/lb.) so I thought I'd buy some and see what I might be able to do with them. Which is how I came across this recipe. I used 2 "hocks" and left out the haml other than that, I followed the recipe. My soup/stew was DELICIOUS. Not only will I be making this again and again, but I think I'll be using ham hocks in many of my preparations from here on out. Succulent and DELICIOUS, NUTRITIONAL and ECONOMICAL to boot. When one is attempting to feed 6 (+1 "on the way"), who can ask for more?

I chose this recipe because of the high reviews, but I wasn't excited about the end result. This was my first time making a bean soup and while the broth had a wonderful flavor, all you could taste was broth and beans. All the veggies were so mushy and had no flavor of their own.  I think I'll try this again, but I'll put the veggies in half way through cooking so maybe they won't be so mushy and I think I'll add some potatoes as well since it seemed to be lacking something more solid other than the beans.

This was great.  I followed some other reviews and did 4 cups water 4 cups chicken broth.  I also boiled the beans for 10mins then put it all in the crock pot and put in the fridge for the night, then in the morning I turned it on and cooked it on low all day and it was PERFECT whenever I got home.  So all in all it cooked in the crockpot on low for 10hrs.  This was great and I'll make it again for sure.

I was pretty nervous to make this soup. It is my first...but now first of many! It was easy, i made a few changes. I added all the same veggies & spices, & added potatos. I used 4 cups water, and 4 cups chicken stock. I cleaned and let the beans sit in hot water for about 30 mins. then I started adding everything in the pot, i let the soup boil, then put on low for about 30 mins. Then brought it back to a boil, and added a rue of 3 tablespoons of flour and some water to make a panacake paste. As the soup was boiling I slowly added the rue, this thickend the soup then salt & pepper for flavor...and WOW it was delicous & with the changes i made it was done FAST! everyone loved it...thanks for the recipe.

This is an exceptionally great recipe. I did however not add the hocks, just because I didn't have any on hand and it still had super flavor. Will certainly make this one again.

This soup is pretty good. I took others advice and used half water half chicken broth. I must say I was expecting more flavor.

This reminds me of my mom's bean soup -  plain, basic ham and beans.  I used the defatted drippings from baking the ham and definitely recommend against this.  It was flavorful and delicious, but incredibly salty, which may be why it tasted so good...Didn't think it was bland at all.

Really good! Used chicken broth instead of water. Next time I will double vegetables. I degassed the beans by bringing them to a boil, taking them off the heat, and adding 1 tsp. baking soda. Then I let the beans sit over night. I drained and rinsed them. It's fun to add the baking soda because it fizzes up. Thank you for the recipe!

My husband likes bean soup so I made this to have on these cold winter days. I had to double the cooking time even after soaking the beans overnight. The soup was incredibly flavorless. We've had great luck with recipes from allrecipes.com but this one was a total bust!

Very good soup.  I soaked the beans overnight and simmered the soup all afternoon.  I reduced the liquid to 6 cups and used chicken broth in place of water.  I'll make this recipe again.

Great basic recipe. I used canned beans and half chicken broth, half water. Definitely watch the salt content. Good way to use up leftover ham.

This was so bland and boring that I had to add chicken bouillon and Mrs. Dash to it at the last minute.  If I'd had more time, I could have doctored it up more.  Sorry, but this was not tasty at all!

This was actually quite good.  However I only gave it 4 stars because I had to tweak it quite a bit; so it's a great starter recipe.  I soaked the beans overnight and this morning I dumped everything in my crock pot.  I pretty much followed the recipe but like some suggested, I used half chicken broth and half water.  I didn't have the northern beans so I used regular pot beans that I use for pork & beans.  I used 4 carrots and 4 celery stalks with the leaves.  I had to add 4 packets of chicken bouillon, some Season All seasoning, lots of pepper & salt because it tasted kind of bland.  I used 2 bay leaves and the onion & garlic as per the recipe.  Oh and I added a good splash of Franks Red Hot Sauce as someone suggested.  I thickened it at the end with a mix of cornstarch & water because I like a thick, hearty soup. I skinned the pork hocks (2 of them)because I was afraid of a lot of grease.  I then thought there would not be enough meat so I added 4 pieces of thick sliced bacon (sliced up).. next time I'll add more bacon and perhaps a ham bone if I have one plus ham meat.  The end result was very good.  Thank you for this recipe, it's going in my KEEPER Recipe Book.

Very good and satisfying soup. I used ham hocks alone with pieces of ham. I didn't have dry beans but did have one of the ginormous cans of great northern beans in the pantry and used those instead. It was wonderful.

So so good. So flavorful. I did use chicken base to use all chicken broth. I think that did a lot for the flavor. Family raved. This'll be my go to ham and beans soup. (Oh, and I live at a high elevation> it was taking FOREVER to cook. I put in in the crockpot for the next day. I guess that's the best way for me to make this.)

THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT RECIPE.  I SOAKED THE BEANS OVERNIGHT AND PUT IN IN THE CROCKPOT.  THE ONLY ADJUSTMENTS I MADE WAS TO ADD ONLY 3 CUPS OF WATER AND A CAN OF BEEFY MUSHROOM SOUP.

Okay, maybe it is because I am kind of upset right now, but this recipe really made me mad!! I was expecting dinner to be done at 7:30 (according to the recipe time) and we finally started eating at 9:15, and the beans were still done completely done. Surely not worth your time.

My first time making Bean soup. Delicious!
What I used: thawed leftover Christmas ham bone with two cups of the meat What I did different- half chicken broth/water, dash of oregano,thyme,rosemary,extra pepper and The puree of  2 cup beans.
What will I do next time: try the mixed bean recipe, won't puree, I didn't like it in the soup.
Total soaking and cooking time, 3 hours and 45 minutes. Beans were fine.

Delicious! My husband especially loved it. I used leftover honey-baked ham and soaked the beans overnight. I added fresh water and threw everything in the crockpot when I left for work. So easy. I think it would be good cooked in stock. You could add chicken or smoked sausage with the hame for a different taste.

My family loves this soup!  I make it in the crockpot almost exclusively, soaking the bean overnight.  I've taken the advice of others and use 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 water, omit the mustard, and add a dash or two of Liquid Smoke to give it an extra smoky flavor.  It's a winner every time!

I had a left-over chunk of spiral ham, so I cut off the rest of the meat and cooked it, with the shank, veggies and spices in 1/2 low-sodium chicken broth (at the suggestion of others) and 1/2 water for about an hour. It cooked down really well! Then, I added the beans (from a can) and simmered for 30 minutes...about the same amount of time it took to make some corn bread. Added no extra salt. It was fairly thick and VERY flavorful. Husband LOVED it! Great recipe!

WOW!  I recieved rave reviews for this soup that I brought to the family get together Christmas Day!  My kids even loved it, and they never like stuff like this.  After reading other reviews, I used half water and half chicken broth.  I had doubled the recipe, so I used one ham hock and one smoked ham shank which was perfect for the added flavor.  Everything else I did exactly as listed.  This recipe is definately one I'll use again.
Thank you for sharing!

This soup was wonderful, even though I made a few alterations.  I did have to cook this longer than the recipe suggested because the beans were still hard after the time suggested.  I waited until the end to add the salt because I didn’t want the soup to be too salty and I did need to add it.  It was still lacking a little flavor so I added some chicken base and a little more pepper and then it tasted great.  This soup also freezes great - I have been eating it all week!  Thanks for a great addition to my cookbook!

I also opted for the crock pot.  I cooked it on low 9 hours.  After a long day, it was a perfect hot healthy meal.  Thanks for the recipe.  PS> I added 3 chicken boullion cubes.

Great basic recipe. I tweaked it a little soaking beans overnight & rinsing. Then used half chicken broth & half water. Added a little garlic. USED 4 OZ. MORE OF BEANS than the recipe called for. Cooked beans in broth mixture until reasonably soft and MASHED (with a potato masher)some of the extra beans. Great thick, hearty soup. Served with crusty bread and salad.

Soup was great.  I have never had much luck with dried beans as far as getting them tender so, I used 1 Jar of Randall's Northern beans instead of the dry Great Northerns.  Substituted 4 cups of water plus two chicken boullion cubes and a can of chicken broth for the 8 cups of water.  Cooked it for the same amount of time.

This was a great way to use the ham bone I had leftover from Easter.  It had a nice flavor and was economical to make.  The only complaint I had was I like soups that have a lot of broth.  This one was very hearty.  I added about two cups of extra water.  It was still very full and I could have added more.

This is a really good recipe.  I did let the soup simmer about 2-3 hours and that cooked the beans til tender and thickened the soup as well.  Great flavor.

Excellent.  I finally made bean soup like my mother-in-law.  I did leave out the garlic and bay leaves and subbed half of water with chicken broth and it turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was trying to find a recipe like my mother used to make, this was it.  It is delicous. I used a smoke ham hock instead to give it a smokie flavor.  I gave some to family and they loved it, it is the best!

This recipe was great, very flavorful. I ended up needing to cook the Ham bone longer because the meat was not cooking off well. Next time I will heat the beans up and in stead of letting them soak for an hour I will add the ham bone and simmer for an hour. Because I ended up cooking the beans and extra hour it was thicker than it is supposed to be but I thought it was great. All the kids ate it and it was better left over the next day for lunch. I will make this recipe again.

This is exactly how I use ham-hocks or leftover bones from those fancy spiral-cut hams!  I even serve with cornbread, as stated in another review.  J.A. uses the same ingredients I have always used (in a different proportion); except J.A. adds garlic-I might add some next time...This is an old recipe and my Mom always called this dish Navy Beans-although I don't know why...Thanks for sharing A.J.

this is wonderful!  do not salt until the last hour when the ham has a chance to flavor the soup.  i used 3 cans of northern beans instead of soaking the beans.  i also added 1.5 cans of water.  i added extra seasonings (ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little cayenne pepper and 2 extra bay leaves).  i didn't have mustard poeder so i added yellow mustard.  the soup wasn't thick enough for me so i added 1 tbsp of cornstarch.

My husband LOVED this soup!  He talked about it for days.  He even said it was better than his mom's bean and ham soup!  I substituted vegetable broth for the water and added more carrots and celery as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

After many failed attempts at different kinds of soup, I finally found one that works!  I added a few peeled, cubed potatoes, which may have helped thicken it.  Definitely a keeper.

LOVED this recipe!!!  Absolutely delicious.  Will become one of my favorites. To speed up and simplify things a bit, I substituted a 48 oz jar of cooked Great Northern Beans plus 1 jar of water for the dry beans, 8 cups water and salt and proceeded with step 2. To help thicken the soup, I added a little flour to some broth to make a paste and then blended it into the soup.

Following the advice of a reviewer, I boiled the hambone for several hours and used that for my broth rather than using water or chicken broth.  I also added a few dashes of hot sauce, which added flavor but not heat.  Many reviewers write that additional salt was not needed.  I think the addition of salt should be made on a case by case basis depending upon the ham used.  I added salt at the end.   Lastly, I did emulsify a few baked potatoes (skin removed) with some broth in order to thicken it.   Very delicious.

Used this recipe as a base to cook the ham hock left over from Christmas dinner. Substituted chicken stock for half the water and dijon mustard for mustard powder. Did not add salt or bay leaf. Put a little ketchup in, which worked nicely with the glaze seasonings that came out of the ham. Excellent with corn bread. Followed advice of others and pureed a portion to add more body. Very happy with the results!

The best trick with a soup like this is to puree a couple of cups of the soup at the end to make a thicker mixture that still has plenty of whole beans.

We loved it and the only complication were that I mis read the directions... I added the cold water ad beans to heat brought it to a boil - where as I should have brought the cold water to a boil then added the beans I'm unsure if this is why my soup was so thick- I had to add water upon reheating for dinner the 2nd day. I would prefer it without the chunks of ham personally but my family loved it- hammock gave AMAZING warm and hearty flavor. Love it! Thanks so much I shall read more carefully next  time!

Great basic recipe. I had pork leg available (these meat available in Asian food markets), sautéed meat with onions and garlic in a pot, salted to taste, then added 6 cups water, let it boil, then put all ingredients in slow cooker for 4 hours on high. Husband couldn't find dried northern beans so bought canned northern beans instead,  so I drained the beans, after 4 hours in slow cooker, added the beans, and let cook on slow cooker on low for another hour....taste yummy with rice (I'm Asian ...gotta have my rice!!).

I substituted 6 cups of chicken stock for 6 cups of water. I also don't love the smell of white pepper, so I used black pepper. Also waited to add the salt until the end because of concerns about making the beans tougher and overwhelming the salt because of the ham added later. I did the quick soak method for the beans and cooked them a bit longer than described and it was fine. I often forget to soak the beans until the next day when I want to eat them. This soup is a wonderful meal when served with some warm bread and a fresh salad. I did the traditional spinach salad for this dinner."

Followed recipe to a T and ended up having to add beef bouillon (because that's all I had on hand) and the beans were still crunchy. I didn't read any of the other reviews because all I saw were 5 stars and figured it must be a good recipe. Highly disappointed.

Wanting to do something with a leftover ham bone, I tried this soup, making a few changes. First, I cooked the onion, garlic & celery (increased to 2 stalks) in some olive oil. Put it in a crock pot & added a packet of Vigo seasoning, which made the color & flavor richer. Yummy!

I used a "bean mix" that I let soak overnight instead of just great Nothern, otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. The beans took over two hours to cook, it was terribly bland and watery and not very good. Don't know what I got wrong, but won't attempt again.

I tried this , it is pretty well the same way I make it.  However, this recipe calls for mustard powder.  I added 1/2 of what it called for and it is very very overwhelming.

Amazing! I omitted the celery and carrots (not a fan) and it was so good. Like someone else said, it was even better the next day. Next time, I'll make it a day ahead. Making it in advance and refrigerating it also gives you the chance to skim off the fat before reheating...a little healthier. I didn't save any leftovers for my husband. Oops.

Hearty and delicious!  Added 2 cups of chicken stock to this and everyone raved at how good it was.  The ham hock was already salty, so I did not add any additional salt and it was perfect.

i followed this recipe exactly and it had no flavor i had added another 1/2 tsp of salt still no flavor. after i decided to go ahead and add additional spices and salt it started to taste ok. i dont know if i would make it again. at least not without making alterations but that is just my opinion and everyone has a different taste pallet. but this was very easy to make.

Very good recipe.  I had to boil mine fore a bit longer for the beans to soften which was fine.  It did thicken up a bit so I added a little chicken broth to thin it out.

Good basic recipe with lots of room for individualizing. I used an immersion blender that gave the base, including the beans and ham, a thick texture, then added more ham and more beans for "chunkiness." I only make this soup about once a year because my husband's not a soup lover, but I'm holding onto this recipe for future use.

I thought this was an average soup. Not a lot of flavor so I had to add  a lot of chicken base w/it(I wish I had ham base, would've made it much better). Didn't wow me, I won't make again :(

I made this for the church community and it was a big hit. I followed the recipe as is. I added a little cummin for more of a smoky flavor. Several people want the recipe.

used a brown sugar smoked ham which made it too sweet for my taste.  Added tomato paste and green chilies, but was still too sweet -- kinda like canned pork and beans.

Great basic soup recipe. I covered the pot after I turned off the heat. After the 60 min soak I poured out half the water and replaced it with chicken broth. The only other change was some extra mustard powder and a little thyme. Great soup, hearty and tasty!

This soup was very good.   I used the bone from my Christmas ham. I also used chicken stock instead of water, plus the beans that I bought had a packet of "ham flavor," so I used it, too.   I also added extra carrots and celery.  After sitting in the fridge overnight, the soup was quite thick, as the beans continued to absorb liquid.  It was still very good, though, and I will make it again.

This soup is fabulous!  I needed to use up leftover ham from Christmas and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't have any bay leaves).  I like my soup with a good bit of broth, so for the last 30 minutes, I added more water and threw the bone back in.  It was GREAT anyway, but I just wanted more broth.  Next time I'll increase it in the beginning.  No probelms with the beans for me, but I may cook it a little longer than the intended time to soften them a bit more.  The recipe is fabulous as is!

I made this soup after reading some of the reviews posted. I made mine in a 12 quart pot, I used 8 cups of water plus chick broth. I also pureed an amount which made the soup thicker. I added whole cloves and more garlic and onions to mine. It looks and smells great! I love this website!

Turned out very yummy!  I didn't have a ham shank, so I ended up putting in some extra pieces of ham I had, to help flavor the soup some more, would have been excellent if I had saved one!  But still turned out very good!

This didn't really come out the way I was expecting...  I cooked in the slow cooker for at least 12 hours but the beans didn't really break down and become a thick soup like I thought they would, it still seemed like beans and vegetables floating in broth to me.  With the leftovers I skimmed all of the liquid off the top and used an electric mixer to blend it up and I thought the texture was much better and looked less unappetizing.  It did taste good, and I forgot to soak the beans overnight so I used the suggestion to boil the beans with baking soda a couple times which seemed to do the trick.

SOOO GOOOOD. I had a ham hock from Easter and made this soup. I followed other reviewers and used half chicken broth half water. But only 6 1/2 cups. I used a 15 bean soup bag o beans that I soaked over night. I tossed it all together and let it simmer for about 4 hours. It was amazing!!

I read several reviews before I prepared this. I used baking soda to "degas" the beans during their initial boiling (for ten minutes) , rinsed and then proceeded with the recipe. I believe a ham shank is better than a ham hock (more meat, less fat and skin) and I increased the vegetables. To me using chicken stock increases the flavor and the salt is not necessary with what is in the ham. The bay leaves and mustard powder are good additions.

Found this too "beany".  I would make it again but I would use less beans.  I let it cook in the slow cooker all day on low.

This is a delicious, bone-warming recipe. I added an additional 2 cups of water to increase the amount of broth and as with most recipes, I double/tripled the garlic. Yum.

Very good. I made this in a 5 qt crockpot. I subbed chicken broth for the water. I didn't use quite 8 cups. I did put the beans on the stove for about 45 minutes. Added everything to the crockpot and let it go on LOW for about 7 hours. I let it cool down and put it in the fridge. It was a lot more runny than what I would have liked. The next day I skimmed the fat off and put it back on LOW (after it sat out for a bit) for a few hours. It wasn't as runny (or soupy) at all the next day. And it was delicious!

Gosh, this was really bland! I had to add beef broth, italian seas, basil, parsely, and Mrs. Dash to make the broth taste like something other than water.

Delicious and basic.  The only drawback is the amount of time it takes to cook the beans.  This is a dish that would be great to cook in abundance on a free day to store in the freezer.

Fabulous!!! I followed other suggestions and used vegetable broth in place of half the water. I also blended about 1/3 of it 30 minutes before it was done and added it back in as a thickener. Will make again for sure!

The soup was amazing. I used the recipe as a guide (doubled it and added another 20% veggies to make it heartier+potatoes the last 15min). In retrospect I would set aside the amt of ham necessary for the soup without glaze since the additional seasonings alter the soups flavor. Enjoy!

Amazing soup!  I got a very good smoked ham hock from the local butcher.  It had plenty of  meat on it ( removed most before cooking), I used canned chicken stock instead of water and I pureed the soup before adding the ham.  Thick and creamy -  mmmm.

The only reason this got 4 stars is because it is truly a basic recipe and all of the suggestions I used from earlier reviews made it a fantastic soup. I used my ham bone and leftover ham, add as much as you have. I subbed chicken broth for the water and due to a change in my schedule even used canned Great Northern Beans, 3 cans. You couldn't tell, you could use more. I added a can of green beans and a mixture of soup seasoning. Thickened it with the instant mashed potatoes, a little at a time till it was right. I never would have thought to do that even though I am an experienced cook. I know, lots of changes but I got the start with this recipe and it was a big hit! Just some crusty bread and a salad for dinner.

This recipe is definitely basic just as described. I tried following it exactly with the exception of using a fifteen bean mix instead of just great northern beans and it was really plain tasting. I added a package of cajun seasoning that came with the fifteen bean mix, extra garlic and a can of diced tomatoes and this recipe became superb! It made our house smell wonderful & tastes exactly like I was hoping for. I'll use this often in the winter. Thanks!

Just a great basic bean and ham soup recipe. Delicious. I did not have a ham bone, so I substituted half the water with chicken stock and fried the onion with some bacon in a little oil before adding to the soup to bump up the flavor. It also needed additional salt on the final simmer. But the result was outstanding and very hearty.

Fabulous!  Used 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups water.  Did not use ham hock.  Made a day in advance.  When I put in frig, there was a good bit of broth, but the next day the beans had soaked up most of the broth.

great recipe, if you want to add more flavor and thicken it up, add instant mashed potatoes to desired thickness, add more water if you want more potatoes.

I modified this recipe for what I had on-hand, which was limited, so I made adjustments to add flavor. No need to add salt.  By the way, adding a teaspoon of baking soda to the already-boiled soaking water did indeed soften the beans - but DO NOT add the baking soda to boiling water like I did, or you'll be cleaning your stove top for awhile! Using the baking soda for the soak really helped soften the beans and lessen the cooking time. Be sure to drain and rinse after they soak.   I used kidney beans, since that's what I had. I added 5 cups of water a and 2 cups of El Pato tomato sauce for the liquid. El Pato is my secret ingredient for flavor, along with 4-5 veggie bouillon cubes (Chicken or beef bouillon is too salty + I like the veggie flavoring more). Using the El Pato makes the soup perfectly spicy. You can vary the water to El Pato ratio to suit your personal taste, of course. I didn't have any veggies except an onion and omitted the mustard powder, so the flavor boosters really helped. I added 6 cloves of garlic - 1 teaspoon would never do it for us. No need to add salt. I used a 1-1/2 lb. meaty ham shank that was just fantastic.   I served this w/ homemade baguette. I had intended to give some soup and a loaf of bread to our neighbor, but we ate almost all of the soup last night!

simple yet delicious. this is one of those recipes where the leftovers taste even better. i used chicken broth instead of water (although i had to add some water about halfway through because it got very thick), didn't use the ham hock, and left out the salt. i'll be making this often, i'm sure.

Best bean soup i've made yet.  Changed a few things.  Boiled beans and onions for 1 hr. then transferred to slow cooker and added ham bone, chopped carrots, ham, chopped tomatoes and seasoning.  Cooked for 4 hrs. on high and thickened.  Served with corn muffings and add fresh chopped onion on soup.  Yummy so good.  Great for cold michigan evenings.

I loved this recipe!  I took the advice from some of the comments and cooked it in the crock pot and I added in two cans of bacon and bean campbells soup and the flavor was outstanding.  My family goobled it up even after eating ham for three days! They loved it.

OMG!!! This bean soup was amazing! I have struggled in the past to make beans edible but let me just tell you...my family ate this batch up in record time. I didn't have to change a thing. It was awesome! I loved the ham chunks in it and it was so flavorful. I will definitely add this one to my monthly meal plan. THANK YOU - THANK YOU - THANK YOU!!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I agree about a little less water to make it hearty. I also added a large can of diced tomatoes with the juice. It addes a nice tangy taste.

I was short on carrots so I used what little I had and added 1 chopped red pepper.  I, too, used 1/2 chicken bouillon and 1/2 water.  I followed the recipe, but instead of letting it cook on the stove after adding the ham hock, I threw everything in the crock pot and let it cook all day.  Beans weren't mushy and the house smelled like heaven.

This was a nice easy soup to make and very flavorful. On the advice of other reviewers I used chicken broth instead of water, but I think I would prefer half water and half broth. I also didn't have a ham bone and thought it was still very good with just the chopped ham. I also didn't have any celery so I used celery salt and navy beans in place of the great northern. I thickened it with a little flour/water mixture. This reminded me of a soup my mom used to make except she used lima beans.

This recipe is so easy to make! I started out by boiling the ham hock in plain water until the meat was falling off the bone. This enabled me to take the ham, bone, and fat out of the water to seperate. I used the "broth" as part of the liquid called for in the recipe. It did turn out a little plain tasting, but nothing that a little added spices didn't cure!

This is such an easy flavorful recipe! Not sure if it is the dry mustard that makes it so good??? I soak dry beans overnight then combine all ingredients in the crock pot and cook on high for 4-6 hours.  I then smash some of the beans and it almost makes a stew.  Great Fall weather food!  This is a keeper.  I will make this again and again.

This was very tasty. I did as someone suggested and added a touch of liquid smoke. I also added a small amount of chopped fresh spinach. I do admit that after eating a bowl of it I could feel my arteries clogging. I refrigerated the rest and skimmed the fat off. It still was a bit fatty tasting but not as bad. Maybe next time i'll trim my ham hock better. Overall, it's a great tasting soup.

Very good bean soup recipe. I used half white beans, 1/4 pintos, & 1/4 kidneys because that's what I had. I didn't have a ham bone, so I sauteed some chopped bacon and added it at the beginning, and just chopped up some ham sandwich slices to add at the end. Delicious!

This was just the recipe I was looking for.  I used 8 cups of water with 4 chicken buillon cubes, and soaked the beans for about 90 minutes.  I did not use a ham hock, I just added diced, cooked ham for the last hour of cooking.  I thought the beans were still a little firm at the end of the cooking time, but still edible.  Great, hearty soup, excellent flavors.

I omitted the salt and used 3 cans of low sodium chicken broth and 1 can of veggie broth and a half a can of water.  I followed all other instructions as directed, and it turned out quite good.  I did not think it was watery, there was some broth, but not too much, and it is soup after all.

A very good bean soup.  I soaked the beans overnight, I've found it gives a better texture to the beans when they cook if they've been  soaked first.  I used stock that I made from my left-over Christmas ham that I had frozen, using that and chicken stock in place of the water when cooking.  Made a nice, large potful of soup--froze the leftovers for another hearty winter dinner.

This was very tasty and easy to do.  I had a very meaty ham bone left from Thanksgiving, so the broth had lots of flavor.  I partially mashed the beans at the end of cooking to make the soup a bit thicker, other than that I changed nothing.

This is a wonderful soup recipe!!! My daughter is a picky eater but loves this. I chop up the celery, onion, and carrots extremely small (almost minced) and she can't even tell they are in there. Would be very easy to double for a get together. I soak the beans for 2 hours instead of 1.

Delicious down home taste! I did soak my beans overnight in the refrigerator, and to the spices I also added 1 tsp. dried basil, and 
1 1/2 tsp. ground coriander seed. After the beans were cooked through, I added an extra tsp. of salt. I also used two ham hocks instead of one. I simmered it on the stove for 2 hours, and since I had to leave the house before it was done, I ended up putting it all in my crock pot to simmer on low for 3 hours while I was away....came out nice and thick! This is comfort food! Serve with hot corn bread and butter. YUMMY!!!

I had to cook the dry beans WAY longer than the hour stated in the recipe- more like overnight in the slow cooker!  I also added chick bouillon and other spices as I felt the broth was a little bland.

Loved this recipe. It tasted just like the soup mom used to make! Only a bit of minor tweaking based on previous reviews. I used chicken broth and water (about 2/3 broth). I soaked the beans for about 36 hours and they were tender, not tough. Did not add any salt, just pepper. Let it simmer for about four hours. It was perfectly delicious. Thanks, J.A.!

I think it's a testament to the strength of this very basic recipe that so many of us rave about it and yet almost everyone who has rated it has made some adaptations to it, successfully.  Mine came out great, here are the adaptations i used:
~15 bean mix instead of Great Northern
~omitted salt
~increased carrots (used a full lb of carrots) and celery
~did boil/soak method, but soaked for three hours
~did remove and puree a portion to thicken it. 
~when i added the chopped ham back in, i also added about 1/4 lb of dry Acini Di Pepe (small pasta like orzo) 
~when serving i drizzled about a tablespoon of 15 year aged Balsamic Vinegar on top. the sweetness of the Balsamic contrasted beautifully with the ham.

I've never been able to make very good bean soup.  Using this recipe and making a couple adjustments, my soup turned out great, the best I've had.  I used a bag of mixed beans that I happened to have on hand, and seasoned with the ham bone left from Christmas.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I left out the salt until the end, and then adjusted the amount for our tastes.  I replaced some of the water with chicken broth and added a couple chicken boullion cubes.  I also took out some of the beans, mashed them with a hand potato masher, then added them back to the pot to thicken the broth.  Excellent taste!  My mother, who has been making great bean soup for years, loved the soup that I took to her.

I buy whole hams just for the bone to make this soup!  All of our friends and family members love it so much that each time they have a ham bone, they bring it to me to make the soup and we each get half.  The recipe is awesome, and really hits the spot during the winter.  I usually soak the beans overnight and let the soup simmer for a few hours.  It tastes even better the next day.  Best to wait until the end to add the salt though, as it often doesn't need it.  Try it, it's great!

Great flavorful recipe!  I used a mixed bag of beans (15 bean mix) that I had on hand, along with remaining meat and bone from a honey baked ham and then followed the recipe exactly.  Tasty stuff!  The whole family enjoyed it.  It was much better than my regular tomato-based 15 bean soup recipe.  I'm looking forward to trying it with just the great northerns in the future, but it's good to know that adaptations also turn out wonderfully. Thanks for the recipe!

Made a big enough batch (with peas instead of beans) over the holidays to serve at a couple gatherings.  Almost everyone complimented it, and nobody complained!  Comforting, rich flavors make this a new winter staple!  A perfect way to put the leftover ham and bone to use after the holidays!

I never make soup with water when broth can be substituted, chicken or veggie usually.  That was the only change I made!

Perfect served with a dollop of sour cream or dash of sherry!

Great basic Ham & Bean Soup recipe. After reading reviews, my comments are: 1) Adding diced tomatoes to soup adds color and flavor; 2) Beans soften easier by soaking overnight; not adding salt until cooked; and adding a piece of kombu (dried seaweed which both flavors and softens beans). After cooking, I remove kombu which becomes slimy and detracts from presentation. 3) If using chicken broth, use low sodium broth to avoid over-saltiness. Also, unless needing to use up leftover ham, I use smoked turkey legs which are lean and considerably less salty than ham. When using smoked turkey legs, I simmer them first in water and/or combined low sodium chicken broth. Then I remove them and cook beans and other ingredients in the tasty broth. And, about 30 minutes before soup is done, I add diced or shredded smoked turkey meat into the soup. 4) Freshly ground black pepper works just as well as white except there will be black specks in the soup. 5) Adding fresh or dried parsley just before serving adds a nice touch of color to soup.

This soup is outstanding! I followed previous reviewers suggestions and boiled the beans 5 minutes before soaking them and then drained them and used chicken broth to cook the soup in. This recipe was a hit, and I will definitely make it again and again!  Delicious AND easy...

This was a very easy recipe for a delicious soup.  I followed another reviewer's reccomendation to soak the beans overnight.  Unfortunately, the beans came out a little too mushy.  Next time I would soak them probably a couple of hours less.  I also used half chicken broth and half water.  As such, there was no need to add any salt. The soup was a hit at our home.

Superb!! I soaked the beans for 8 hours before proceeding with your instructions (used 3/4 lb. Navy beans and added 1 can small red beans with the ham towards the end of cooking). Substituted 2 cups vegetable broth for 2 cups of the water. I cooked a little longer to soften beans more. Simply fabulous!

This needs more than 5 stars!  Sooo good!  I made a pot of this Saturday afternoon.  Saturday night, husband & his college-boy brother ate it all.  The only change I made was using navy beans rather than great northern beans.  Don't leave out the mustard powder - it's a must.

I am not a big ham & bean soup person, but my husband absolutely loved it...said it was the best he's ever had (also received rave reviews from my father). I included some of the suggestions from other reviewers and used vegetable stock (4 cups stock/4 cups water) and omitted the salt. May try next time with a variety of beans. I, too, followed the advice of other reviewers and added more celery and carrots.

Delicious!  My husband even said it was better than his mothers!  I used part stock to the water to make it flavorful, and omitted the mustard powder, and simmered it for several hours to thicken it. Very good and hearty soup!

My husband declared it his favorite soup.  I used dried navy beans, soaked them several hours then cooked the soup for several hours until the beans broke down and the soup became thick.  In total it took 10 hours, but worth it on a snowy, cold winters day!  I suggest more carrots and celery.

This is a delicious recipe! I found it took longer to get the beans thoroughly softened but it was worth the wait.  I served it with Waikiki Cornbread (recipe available on this site.) Big hit.

I used a left over spiral ham bone, boiled it for stock, let it sit overnite in order to skim off the fat.  Then I started w/the beans in the ham stock and followed the recipe from there.  I doubled the recipe and used baby limas and great northerns.  I pureed the carrots, celery and onion so my kids wouldn't pick them out, but it still gave the soup every bit of nutrition and flavor.  They loved it!

I simple recipe for that leftover ham!  I added 2 diced potatoes to the recipe
which helped thicken the soup.  I also used half navy beans and half northern
beans.  It turned out delicious!  My husband absolutely loved it and wants it to
be an 'after Easter' tradition from now on!

Phenomenal. Looked up to add a few notes. I doubled the recipe. I added 4 sprigs of thyme, 1/2 tspn paprika and 1/2 cup brown sugar since my ham was not super sweet. I thought it would have been good with twice as much carrots and celery, and will do that next time. This is a KEEPER!

I made this soup the day after Thanksgiving and it was WONDERFUL!  We had a ham bone that still had a decent amount of meat on it so I decided to put it to good use. While the soup simmered, the house smelled AMAZING!!  I made a big batch, froze half for a future cold and snowy day and savored a bowl while I decorated the tree.  It was memorable, hence the photo and my first review.

I have been making bean soup for years so i thought i would try something new. I added lots more water and chick broth. This is much too thick to be called "soup," but the taste was fine. Also I never discard the ham hock. it usually has a lot of meat to add to beans. I sometimes season mine with salt pork if i cant find ham hock.

I definitely needed a bigger pot! Lol I didn't have all the ingredients so, I used red beans, cannellini beans and some potatoes...no celery or the extra ham...but, my natural 'flavor'(lol, i crack myself up) for life helped me! Oh, also...DELICIOUSO!!!

Was delicious, my wife got the already chopped ham in a bag at the store. I would recommend not doing that, get the slab instead and chop yourself, otherwise you will be chewing on small bits of rubber...also i personally remove as much fat from the slab before cubing .

First off, I have been cooking dry beans for years and the rule of thumb about beans is NEVER add the salt to the cooking beans. It will make the beans hard and tough. Add the salt just before they are fully cooked. This is a recipe I have used often very yummy!

Turned out great but I made a few adjustments: I used veggie broth in place of water, canned beans in place of dry, 2 ribs of celery and two carrots instead of one. My whole family gobbled it up. Thank you :)

This is a great basic recipe to build a soup that suits your consumers. Good Lord use water to soak beans, do the dishes, or wash out your underlovelys. DON't make people you love eat stuff prepared in water. How many great stocks are there. AND  out there? I used home made veal stock together with home made chicken stock. Salt and pepper are favor basics, meant to make our food taste incredible by drawing out flavor. Guess we all gotta do what we gotta do, but I used ham hocks, left over ham that had been marinated in real maple syrup, smoked beef sausage. AND I SALTED AND PEPPERED RIGHT UP FRONT. Incredible is the adjective that comes to mind. Loved the reviewer that used every sort of dried bean she could find. You betcha for heavens snakes, it is after all, bean soup! As always, the recipes found here are just great. What makes it fun is reading what other people do to jazz up the ball. There really aren't any wrong answers here. It's just whatever spins the spinner on your beanie, blows up your skirt, puts a zip in your get along, and twists the valve on your creative juices. Most importantly SHARE with us, I, for one, learn and enjoy hearing what all you tricksters do.

Just finished making this. prepared it using the Power Pressure Cooker, so it didn't take as long as the directions say. Took 30 minutes flat! The ham and northern bean soup was VERY good! the flavor and consistency of the soup was very nice. I wouldn't change a thing!

Excellent first-time bean soup for getting the basics down.  Didn't make any significant changes, but next time I won't be using 'cubed' salad ham - it's too stiff and doesn't cook up well.  real, chopped/shredded ham is the way to go.  If you don't have it, use bacon!

We both love this, I make it all the time.  I soak the beans overnight.  Use fresh pressed garlic.  Add dry cumin to the spices.  Heat over med-low flame until it gets thick and the beans fall apart, which takes about 3 hours.  Like a lot of soups this is even better the next day.  He likes it served over cornbread topped with fresh chopped onion.  I just eat it with a spoon.  Delicious!

Loved it! I soaked the beans over night, I used a crockpot, and put in chicken broth instead of water and just enough to cover the meat and beans. It came out perfect! Wonderful over cornbread...mmmm

I made this today and it was fantastic!  I make mine in a crock pot.  I DO NOT soak my beans first.  I rinsed them then put them right in my crock with 8 cups of water and 5 Tbsp of chicken bouillon granules. I omitted the ground mustard and the salt (with the ham hock and chicken granules, it was plenty salty). Cooked it on high for six hours and it was perfect.  We put a little ketchup in it (try it!), served it with salad and corn bread and it was quite a delicious winter meal.

Pretty good!  I made my own stock by boiling the hambone and veggie ends for an hour + in the water.  I was leery of the mustard, but it was subtle and quite nice.  I liked this dish quite a bit, but I was the only one in the family to get seconds of it, hence the 4 stars.  Thanks!

Yummy! Made with water and drippings from cooking spiral ham. Used ham bone as well. 

Will try next time with more veggies, some potatoes, and maybe half & half to make this a cream-based soup/chowder.

Super easy and tasty. I added some extra spices and more carrots and celery.  Great way to use the ham bone with its special flavor.

This was amazing! I tried it with the beans whole, but then took a hand masher and mashed the soup in the pot for a bit and thought it was even better that way. I also soaked them overnight.

This was fabulous!  My husband had seconds. I took the advice of one review using 8 cups of chicken broth instead of water. We added diced potatoes along with other veggies.   I also let the beans soak overnight. So good!

The end product was so salty - absolutely inedible!
If I try this again I would use low sodium broth and no ham hocks or no ham.

Made it but had to do some changes, we are Puertorricans and it was kind of bland for our taste. I added some sofrito, extra garlic,olive oil, cilantro and a sazon cube!!! It came out delicious!

Added Chicken broth which I think helped with the flavor and tweaked some of the other ingredients. I think I would try a different recipe for ham and bean soup next time...

I liked it but I think a little more beans would be/would have been better. I used spiral ham(brown sugar glazed) so it was a bit sweet which didn't go quite well in this recipe but I think it would be/have been really good with the regular ham. I'll definitely try this recipe again with more beans and regular ham.

I've never tried ham and bean soup but for some reason this caught my eye. I like the flavor of bay leaves. I soaked the beans overnight so I skipped step one. I absolutely loved it. Thanks!

Used 15.5 oz canned great northern beans and 29 oz chicken broth.  Added that to step #2 in pot and simmered 60 minutes.   Delish!  I am so impressed!

This was a good base recipe to add spices to increase or develop the flavors we like.  I used homemade chicken broth instead of water, didn't have enough carrot, so I used a parsnip to make up the difference.  Soaked my beans overnight the old fashioned way...more economical and I can control the sodium that way.  Smashed 1/2 of the beans at the end of cooking to thicken the soup.  Very good on this cold winter day!  Homemade corn muffins were a nice accompaniment.

I just made this recipe for New Year's Day. I did a few variations. I had a ham bone from a Christmas spiral ham. I put it in the crock pot overnight to make my own stock. I used canned beans for simplicity sake...they were great and I added a head of cabbage because I LOVE CABBAGE. I also did not have to add the mustard because my left over ham was glazed with it....
This soup was PERFECT!

I didn't put in onion, and instead of chopping the ham I put it in the food processor.  It flavors the broth better and ham in every spoonful.  I use to have to process the meat for my dad since he couldn't chew the ham and continued to do it after he passed away because everything has more flavor with ham.

This is good soup but it really needs a couple tsp. of chicken bouillon or cubes to give it a nice broth flavor...not too much though since the ham is salty.  Came together nicely though...great served with a piece of homemade cornbread!

Until I tried this recipe, I didn't think I could make a good bean/ham soup. I used vegetable broth instead of water to simmer the beans.
Altough I did not keep the bone, as I should have, it was still very good. Don't put in more white pepper until after you taste it. I added about 1/4 tsp. after about 2 hours because I could not smell it, but it was there.

This was most excellent.  With that said...I followed a few others comments.  I soaked my beans overnight.  I also used about a cup or more of each vegetable...carrot, onion and celery.  I did my cut prep work the night before...so I put the beans along with 8 cups of veggie stock (my Dad doesn't like chicken) and all the veggies (minus bay leaves...Dad doesn't like that either :-) in a crock pot on low for 8 hours the next morning.  I got home and took my hand mixer and mixed some of the soup so it would have a thicker consistency. I made homemade cornbread and honey butter to go on top.  This was a perfect meal for a cool evening.  Thank you for sharing!

This is the best soup recipe I've ever tried. I followed the recipe exactly and the broth and flavor was amazing.  I was so tired of split green peas and ham soup (gets too thick) and made this today.

Ah! White pepper & dry mustard give the kick created in this soup!
I used a blend packet of 7 beans mixed and set in water over night then rinsed and set the slow cooker on 6hrs. I did not add carrots so I doubled the chopped celery, plenty for six heart bowls!

Yum! This was really good bean soup. I like a lot of vegetables in it so I added a diced potato and a handful of frozen green beans. I also give the pot of soup a healthy squeeze of ketsup to add to the flavor. Don't laugh, it's really good.

I made this soup for dinner tonight with some leftover ham and it was good!  I added some low-sodium chicken broth for additional flavor.  Chopped up all the veggies, the ham and beans and added everything to the crock pot for an all-day simmer!  Served with cornbread.

mistakingly added paprika instead of cayanne, but it really tasted great!  used tomato sauce instead of juice because i didn't have juice.  again, it turned out great.  Also, calls for way too much chix broth.  made mine in the slow cooker-i have a very large one or it would not have worked out. alot of juice so i added potatoes near the end- next time i will added a lot more potatoes-seemed to make it a little more hearty.

takes about 4 hours, start-to-finish. Makes about 4-5 BIG bowls of soup. For this kind of time, I would advise doubling the recipe, so you have more soup for leftovers. A good basic soup, but again, would probably add more spices for more flavor. I included 3 thin pork chops for more meat; added the meat along with the veges to cook through. Also chopped up the ham hock once it was cooked through, for more meat.

Simple and delicious. I actually used this as a base and did a few things different after reading another recipe (The best bean and ham soup, but didn't want to cook for 10 hours). My husband thought it was more ham stew then soup. I used 8 cups of homemade turkey broth (instead of water), 16 bean variety and soaked overnight (instead of northern), 5 carrots, 3 celery stocks, 1 can of diced tomatoes, 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 2 tbsp spicy golden mustard (instead of mustard powder), 2 tbsp brown sugar, vegetable broth to cover ham bone, and deli baked ham sliced thick and chopped. Yes, I know this is pretty different but again I liked the sound of the other recipe, but just didn't want to cook for 10 hours :).

This is just what the name says - a great "basic ham and bean soup".  I added more beans and definitely upped the seasonings, but this recipe provides a great place to start.  I also did the traditional overnight soak, so I can't comment on that part of the recipe.

Perfect, the mustard is key. Otherwise, this is basic. However, less is more sometimes. Just right.

We loved the soup.  I followed the recipe exactly except I soaked my beans overnight and rinsed the beans out well, used a meaty ham bone, omitted the salt, decreased the water to 7 cups, and put in 4 chicken buillon cubes. I cooked it in the crockpot for 10 hrs and took out the bone and cut the meat and put the ham back in the pot. It was very flavorful and the beans were nice and tender!

I can only give this three stars because although what I ended up with was good, I followed other users suggestions. Use fresh water after you soak the beans and only 6-1/2 Cups. I also thought it was a little bland. You might want to spice it up a bit. I'll try it again with some more alterations!

Took other suggestions .. used 2 cans chicken broth, added water to make 6 cups. Didn't have a ham hock but it didn't seem to need it for flavor (though I did have to add a little bit of salt to compensate). Excellent recipe!!

Yum! Delicious recipe! Got a thumbs up from the whole family of picky eaters. I soaked beans about 5 hours, boiled and simmered another hour and threw in the crockpot for 8 hours with seasoning veggies, and leftover bone from a spiral cut ham. this gave it a thick consistancy but that was fine! Very good, thanks for sharing.

I came looking for a ham soup recipe with no peas or potatoes.  This was quite good.  I used kidney beans and soaked and rinsed them.  My ham was very salty so I was glad I didn't add salt.  I had a big ham bone with a lot of meat on it so I started off with more water and boiled it down before adding the soaked beans.  Good simple recipe though!  My 4 year old loved it.

I really liked how simple and easy this recipe was, if you soak the beans over night you can skip the first step, and get right to the cooking. I do not understand why people add chicken stock because if your using ham, that does not come from the same animal, so that is just a little weird. All I did was added 8 more cups of water after it was reduced, and add the salt, mustard powder, and white pepper to taste, and it was back to flavor again. Thanks for posting this! Now I am going to eat my soup. :)

This is the best bean soup I've ever had! I made a few adjustments, I put chicken 2 bullion cubes in because I didnt have chicken broth off hand. I also used a 16 bean melody that I found at the grocery store. I also added more veggies and a little pinch of crushed red pepper flakes to give it some heat. Great recipe!

I made ham and bean soup tonight and followed this recipe using it as a base. I made the following changes mostly based off others suggestions and the soup was wonderful. I omitted the celery, I halved the recipe so I used 2 cans of beans as well as their juice, 2/3 lb bacon fried drained and crumbled, 1 can of chicken broth only two cups of water and 2 chicken Bouillan cubes. I do most of my cooking by taste and so I continued adding fresh ground pepper until satisfied which was alot. I will save this recipe and my notes and make this again, thanks for the starting point.

This recipe is perfect, just used a ham bone for flavor because I had one from our Christmas ham, was wonderful an deserves 5 stars for taste and simplicity.  Just remember you need plenty of salt, beans tend to soak up everything you put in there.

Great soup. I make it in the slow cooker. I always have some in the freezer. My two year old loves it and asks for it while pointing to the freezer. I tweak it every time but this is my starting point.

Personally, I thought this was pretty good however, the other 4 people who ate it thought it wasn't so good. My 2 small children took a couple bites and wouldn't eat anymore. Suffice it to say I won't make this recipe again.

This was just ok. It needed way more veggies and ham then called for. Also maybe a little more seasoning or something. I had bread and butter with it, and that in itself tasted better to me and my family than the soup.

I used a Honey Baked ham bone for my soup and this was a delicious, simple recipe.  I also used  chicken broth in place of all of the water. Will definitely be a keeper in my kitchen. Thanks for sharing.

The was GREAT. I used 1/2 pinto and 1/2 great northern beans; reduced the water and used the majority of chicken stock for the liquid.  I didn't have a ham hock (and don't even know or want to know what it is) so I put the ham in at the beginning.  You won't be disappointed in this recipe!  Thank you...

Good, but even with adjustments (substituted in chicken broth and used a ham bone plus ham) it lacked in flavor. While I thought this was mediocre, my fiance scarfed down 2 bowls so I averaged my score out to 4 stars. I think this could have been much better with a bit of tomato paste and spice.

Wonderful!  In the past, I've used a recipe from my Mom & made in a pressure cooker.  This recipe was much, much better.  Sorry Mom!  Minor changes I made: (1) cooked in slow cooker for 6-8 hrs, (2) substituted chicken stock (Kitchen Basics) for water, (3) used piece of smoked ham shank, (4) used jar of Randall Great Northern Beans - didn't rinse, (5) omitted salt since ham is a tad salty and (6) tossed in some left over maple flavored bacon (Bob Evan's) I had from the previous morning.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

I didn't have ham bone but did have ham so just cubed it to use.  I used dry northern beans which I'd soaked for approximately 18 hours and used about 6 cups of chicken broth. I cooked the beans in the crockpot on high for a couple of hours and when they began getting tender I added everything else (except the cubed ham) to the crockpot.  When the beans were cooked but not overly soft I added the ham. I like all kinds of soups, with broth or creamy, but this soup just seemed like it 'should' be creamy.  I had a can of northern beans in the pantry so I opened it and used the immersion blender to make it creamy then added it to the soup.  Delicious!  I liked the subtle taste the mustard gave the soup, something a little different.  I will be making this again!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I used homemade chicken stock instead of water. I liked it ok, it was a little bland, though. I'll keep looking.

I made this tonight for my children. We don't eat pork so I subbed a can of new potatoes for the ham. I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water, the texture came out wonderful, I soaked them for a few hours and let them cook down for about 3 1/2 hours. I left out the salt because I thought it would have been too salty with the chicken broth, but I was wrong they were under-seasoned, I guess because I had no meat. But I used this as a base recipe for white beans. I served over rice with cornbread

This is a favourite in our house!  The last time I made this I also added some broccoli that needed to be used and I didn't have enough beans, so added some pearl barley when there was about half an hour's cooking time to go to make up for the lack of beans.  I will also be able to make this using my slow cooker some time!

As written, this is only 3 stars because the flavor was flat.  I added a tablespoon of chicken base and that did the trick, oh and I also added black pepper.  With those changes, we thought this earned 5 stars.

This was ok, not sure if I'll make it again, but if I do I will blend half of the beans and water in order to get a creamier texture rather than having it so watery.

I really liked this soup! It's different but good!  I added some red potatoes and chicken broth per suggestions.  And then I added a little cream to fool my husband into thinking it was more of a creamy soup. I also used canned beans to save time.  It was better the next day! Very tasty and easy!

Excellent and very easy!  Great way to use leftover ham.  The chaanges I made are as follows: boiled beans for 5 minutes in water nd then soaked for 60 min.  I drained the beans and added back to pot with 6 1/2 cups of chicken broth and an additional 1 cup of water.  I used 1/2 bag of baby carrots, 4 stalks of celery, 1 large russet potato and 1 whole onion.  I then let it simmer away on the stove top for almost 2 hours. It was perfect!

This was very good, but I did make some changes after reading other reviews.  I soaked the beans overnight, used 4 cups chicken broth and 4 cups of water.  I also added a large can of tomato sauce as we like it a little thicker and a dash of tobasco.  Really good soup for a cold day.  Thanks for sharing.

I soaked the beans overnight and put everything in the crock pot in the morning for 9 hours.  It was a bit mushy, will test it at 7 hours next time.  I used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 water.  Added some red hot too.  Very good!

After reading a lot of the reviews, we soaked the beans overnight, used a leftover Christmas spiral ham bone with a little meat still attached, used 4 cups of water and 4 cups of chicken broth, doubled the vegetables (tripling the garlic!), and added a dash of cumin for additional flavor.  Since the beans soaked overnight, we only had to simmer for about one hour... any longer and the veggies would have been too mushy.  Soup was really great, even the next day!

This was just okay. Good enough not to throw away the left overs but not special it just tasted like a bunch of beans. I read all the reviews and it was cooked right and I did the salt and pepper thing but I felt like there was definitely something (flavor-wise) missing.

This is a very good recipe.  It reminds me of a favorite soup I ate as a kid.  I "degassed" the beans as some other reviewers suggested and it worked like a charm. I also added the salt after cooking just to be on the safe side.

This soup is excellent.  A perfect comfort food.  I realized while I was making it that I didn't have any bay leaves, so I did without.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  YUM!

Just what I was looking for to use up that ham bone after Easter. A little bland for my family and me so we kicked it up with some extra garlic and spices. Excellent starter recipe. Takes me right back to my mom's kitchen.

I usually do this in a crock pot starting late morning.  I follow the recipe as follows but add a dash of hot sauce near the end.  It's something my dad has done to his ham and bean soup to give it a little kick which we really like.  Pretty good basic soup.

This is, indeed, a basic soup. Pretty good but a little lacking in flavor. I'm not sure exactly what it needs.

This was a great recipe.  Awesome flavor.  I soaked my beans overnight and then cooked in the crock pot all day.  I added some hot sauce to mine since I like things a bit more spicy.  Will definatley make again and again!

This was excellent but the beans were hard as a rock!!!! You definately need to boil the beans MUCH longer or soak them overnight.  I simmered mine the whole night and they were "just" tender - but an awesome taste!!!!!

I made this soup tonight and it turned out great with the adaptations of other reviews.  I used chicken stock instead of water.  Pureed about 4 cups of the mixture half way through for added thickness.  I added 3 potatoes and a can of tomatoes. I also soaked the beans over night and put it all in a crock pot for another 8 hours on High.  It taste great and it was very easy to make.

I thought this recipe is one of the best ones i tried.  Instead of using mustard powder. I used regular yellow mustard.  And it came out great.

This turned out great. This was my first time making ham & bean soup and doing it straight from scratch with dry beans made me nervous. I followed other reviewers suggestions and modified the recipe a bit. I used the 15 bean mix (soaking them overnight in a pot of water) and used 4 cups water and 4 cups chicken broth. I omitted the mustard powder, bay leaves and white ground pepper because I didn't have any of it and didn't add any salt in fear of it being too salty. I put everything in the crockpot in the afternoon, cooked on high for 4 hours, added the chopped ham and cooked for another hour. 

It was good, but not the best. It needed salt & pepper for flavor. I won't use the 15 bean mix again because for some reason one of the type of beans didn't cook well- it was still kinda crunchy. When I make it again I'll omit some of the water because I like a thicker soup and maby try blending some of the beans like others suggested.

YUM!  This had great flavor.  It was thicker than I was anticipating and seemed more like a stew to me.  Also, I omitted the salt--there was plenty of salty flavor with just the ham alone.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Great, easy too! I put everything in my pressure cooker at once since I didn't have alot of time and it was done to perfection in 2 hours. Used 4 cups veggie broth and 4 cups water, left the salt out till the end, it didn't need much. Thanks, I'll be making this again!

Excellent use for your left over ham!  I did not use the ham hock and I left out the onion.  It was the best ham and bean soup I have ever had.  It is extremely flavorful and has such a nice presentation.  I served it with cornbread.  I wish I had some right now!

My husband loves it when his dad makes ham and bean soup. So when we had left overs this time around he had me make a batch. I have tried before and failed, so the preassure was on.  It didn't fail.  I was so happy that it turned out so well and my husband thought it tasted just as good as his dad's if not better.   Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Very, very good, even my hubby, who isn't fond of bean soup, said this was the BEST bean soup I'd ever made.  Will definitely be making this again.  I did use part chicken broth, and I did puree part of the soup at the end to make it thicker.  Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

I make this recipe with the leftovers from my Christmas Honeybaked ham.  I usually use a package of assorted beans, but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  My family loves it!

Everyone in my family loves this soup, so easy to make using the leftover ham from Thanksgiving or Christmas. Great flavor even the kids like it. Good for New Years Dinner.

Absolutely wonderful.  I did soak the beans over night, which worked out perfect.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Quite tasty. I made it in a slow cooker (all day) and pre-soaked the beans. I added tons of onion and garlic and a bit of corn starch to thicken. I made it with some jiffy cornbread (in an iron skillet of course) and it was a great combo.

Very good and easy!  The only changes I made were substituting half the liquid with chicken broth, and using double the amount of beans, which made the soup thicker.  Next time I make it, I won't add salt, as it doesn't need it.

This soup was wonderful! I did use 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water like some others suggested. I also used 3 ham hocks instead of just 1 and my husband & I thought the flavor was wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

Followed some suggestions: Cooked in the crock pot on low for 8 hours, Added 3 chicken boullion cubes, did not add salt. Used Honey Baked Ham bone. Did the quick soak method. Soup was very thin but delicious. Upon reheating the next day it was still very thin. Will probably make again.

Overall, I thought this soup was rather bland and not very thick at all, but I tend to like thicker soups--so I added 1/2 cup of uncooked rice and it thickened up nicely.  But it is still missing something and I can't figure out what it is.

This was a wonderful soup - excellent on cold winter evenings!  I used a smoked ham shank which gave it a nice flavor.  I did not have dry beans, so I added a couple cans of northern beans toward the end of cooking.  Great with fresh italian bread!

This recipe is very good.  I also recommend soaking the beans over night.  The over night soak directions are right on the bag. Also, I had a hard time finding a ham hock, so I used instant ham stock.  I couldn't even tell the difference.  Thanks for the recipe!  My family loves it.

This was so good!!  I put everything in the crock pot and let it simmer all day.  Made some cornbread for dipping.  I've been looking for a good ham and bean soup recipe.  Happy to say I'm looking no further!  This one hit the spot!

Can't go wrong with this one, beans and ham, yum! I do soak the beans overnight rather than the boil and soak method. And I usually allow for at least an afternoon of simmering to get the best flavor and for the beans to be done.

I don't like ham and bean soup but my hubby gave this 5 stars. He loved it. I used canned beans instead because I kept forgetting to soak the beans!

This was a great recipe for our Easter leftovers.  I soaked the beans overnight, to make sure they were soft and I didn't add the salt, as others reccomended, but did add some chicken broth powder near the end to add flavor.  It was excellent!!  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

I cheated and used 4 - 15 oz cans of Great Northern.  2 were drained, 2 all in.  It made it a little thinner than I normally like.  Good soup all around!

I tried this wonderful soup recipe in search of ways to use up that leftover Christmas ham.  What a great find!!  It's easy and very good.  The mustard powder is what caught my eye. I like recipes with that special secret ingredient.  My husband says it's so good that it brings tears to his eyes!!!

Yum!  This was easy and the results were delicious!  It was even better the next day!  I omitted the celery since I didn't have any and added potatoes to thicken it up a little.  I'll make this again and again!

I usually don't deviate from recipes the first time I make them, but I needed to stretch this a bit more...I doubled the ham, added a can of cream of celery soup, two cans of water, and two cans of beans.  I also pureed about half of the mixture to thicken it.  I wished I had just made it the regular way, but it tasted great, even though it ended up looking like what comes out of a can of Campbell's soup.  Pretty hard to mess this up though...I would make again!

This soup was wonderful...since my husband and I are living on a budget (in France...) we replaced all the meat with 1 1/2 cups of "lardons," a cross between ham and bacon, in which we sauteed the onions and doubled the garlic.  We also used chicken broth instead of water and seasoned with herbes de provence and 2 tbsp hot dijon mustard.  It was amazing--a very flexible recipe!

This is  a great soup- I modified by using chicken broth and and added an extra smoked ham shank. To thicken, I added one can of navy beans (mashed up) and one  diced  potato. 
The flavor was improved also by the addition of thyme.
 I will make this again!

Very good!  I added some diced tomatoes for flavor and color and used a 15 bean mix. I also took some of the other reviewer's tips and blended a portion of it to thicken it. I plan on making this soup with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving too.  This was a very simple, hearty soup and I will be making it several times this winter, I'm sure. It's very easy to customize this recipe to your own individual preferences and I'm looking forward to trying some ideas using this soup as a base.

Pretty good soup.  Was nice and somewhat flavorful without being too much.  I added hotsauce to mine and thought they were great.  This recipe turns out results that could be served to large groups with some condiments to make everyone happy.

This was one of the best bean soup recipes I have made. It tasted a little bland so I added a tablespoon or two of tomato paste I had left over. That did the "trick"!

Great recipe!! I'm not big on dried beans so made mine from a mix of canned pinto and northern beans. I prepared the vegetables, spices, broth and ham first, then added the beans the last 30 minutes and let it simmer. The northern beans were almost non-existent, but they added just the right texture so broth wasn't too watery. The pintos gave it a browner color, but tasted great!Will definitely make this again....and again!

This was easy and delicious! It was a great way to use up a ham bone and leftover ham.  I added more water than the recipe called for.  I will be making this again for sure.

This soup turned out pretty good. I cheated and instead of soaking the beans used a 40 oz. can of great northern beans and added 4 cups of ham broth for the liquid. It worked great and the family loved it.

Fantastic recipe.  It's best to soak beans overnight.  Cooking time is much less this way. Only change I made was to sautee the onions, garlic and ham bone first. I then added the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for a couple of hours.  Friends and family loved the taste. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  I used pinto beans that had been soaked overnight.  Also added a tsp of dill weed for added flavor.  Very hearty soup.

I used 3 cans of beans instead of dry and skipped the first step but the beans disintigrated in all the boiling.  Not a problem though since I was planning on blenderizing a bit of the soup to thicken it. When I made it next time I'll start with only one can of beans with the ham hock and let it disintigrate and then add the other two cans right towards the end so they stay whole.  Ham hocks are super cheap, I had a package of two for $1.  I used both but next time I'd use only one and freeze the other for some other type of soup.  I added a lot more carrots and celery than it called for, that was quite good.  I think I'd recommend half of a large bag of baby carrots and a whole package of celery (is that called a bunch?).  I put in an 8 oz ham steak chopped, but I'd use even less next time.  Didn't have any bay leaves.  And don't add the salt, the ham hock and ham will make it salty enough.
  
Since all the beans disintigrated and there wasn't much body to the soup, I was thinking that I might add cabbage next time.

Very tasty. Skipped the salt since I thought the ham would be salty enough. To make it thicker, mash or puree some of the beans. Yumm.

Make a few modifications.  Cooked overnight in a slow cooker.  Used 3 smoked ham hocks, no salt, mustard, bayleaves or pepper.  Increased carrots, celery and garlic.  It was still a little salty; next time I will use 2 instead.  This is a wonderful soup that really sticks to your ribs!

I loved this soup!  Like everyone says it is super easy!  However, I did use chicken stock instead of water, and I added a 16 oz. can of tomato sauce and a can of diced tomatoes.  I also added a 7 oz, can of diced chilies to spice it up!  Yummy!

Excellent recipe...This was my first attempt at Ham and Bean soup...I followed suggestions, putting chicken base in water to give it more flavor.  I only found ham shanks, instead of hocks and then added diced ham from deli...it was great!  I followed the directions for cooking the beans, because I forgot to soak them overnight...it worked perfect.

Absolutely the best recipe.  Even my ultra picky kids ate this.  Everyone loved this.  I did add a little bit of cornstarch just to thicken it up a bit.  This was gone in one day!

This is a great way to use left over ham and was liked very much by the whole family, even my 20 month old.  I didn't add any extra salt as I think ham is pretty salty on its own.  It was very easy to prepare and very good.

I thought this was a great soup! I was stumped as to what to do with this dang ham bone and this really had great flavor and was pretty painless!  I used dried lima beans instead and subbed onion powder for chopped onion.  I also prepared the beans according to package instructions instead.  I think the mustard powder was a great flavor enhancer!  Thank you!

This is a really good recipe. I use 4 cups of stock and about a cup of water and cook  the ham bone in it for a couple hours. I then add the beans (presoaked) to the broth and leave the bone. I cook that for a couple hours too adding some smoked parika. Once the beans are soft I rough mash them to make the soup creamy and thick while leaving some beans whole.  Next, I add tiny potatoes  (red or yellow) cut into 4ths. I continue cooking until the potatoes are soft. Serve with greens and a dinner roll, biscuit or cornbread.  Makes a delicious, hardy stick to your ribs soup!  One of my family's favorite meals!

Excellent, and I did follow the suggestions for using chicken stock for most of the water, omitting salt altogether. Best batch I ever made. I never thought to use mustard powder before!

This is a great recipe!! I soaked my beans over night and threw everything together to cook. It turned out great. I didn’t have white pepper, so I used my black. I brought everything to a boil and then let it cook on low for 5-6 hours. So delicious. I didn’t add any salt to the pot, but when I served an individual bowl, I added a little Himalayan salt to it. This is a great recipe for that left over ham bone!! The fat and collagen from the ham bone make this soup so delicious and nourishing for the body!

I made the recipe exactly except I used an immersion blender to cream it up. What I would change: leave out salt, add more carrots. This recipe was sooooo good!

Good soup! I did soak the beans first to cut down cooking time and used a 15 bean mix. We did leave the hock in a portion of the soup, which was a bad idea. It made the soup kinda gross and the meat on it is completely bland after being boiled.

Made this for dinner tonight. It was a hit for my wife, teenage son, and me. Only modifications I made were to throw in several diced red potatoes.  We enjoyed it with cornbread and a nice Finger Lakes Riesling. Yum.

So great. For fun, I used a Wagner Drip Drop roaster. After a quick boil/rinse of beans, I added everything else &  put the whole mix in the oven with the lid on top. 20 min at 475 degrees to get the temperature up, then three hours at 275.

I forgot the celery at the grocery store and I used 3 cans of beans instead of the dried variety. I also used more chicken broth so it'd be more "soupy". Loved this!  Super easy!  I made some biscuits with it, but I think corn bread would go great as well.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was my first time making a bean soup. It turned out surprisingly well. I was skeptical about putting the dry mustard in, but it gave the soup a rich taste and creamy color. I will make this again.

This was the best soup I have EVER made.  I took a lot of suggestions from other reviewers and it turned out excellent!

I soaked the beans overnight, used the crockpot, cooked on low for almost 10 hours, used mostly chicken stock and a bit of water, removed about a cup and a half of beans in the 8th hour, pureed them and put them back in the soup to make it thicker. 
I used garlic powder instead of garlic, omitted the celery and added NO salt. (none needed)
I used a ham bone and added 2 cups of diced ham. Next time I will double it to 4 cups. I also used black pepper.

The carrots were a bit too mushy so next time I will add them about half way in. 

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would. Delish! :)

This was a great recipe!  Thank you so much! :) I made a few changes (totally not necessary though) because of how long I cook the Beans ... I used 11 cups of water vs. 8 cups.  I added 2 cups of cubed potatoes. The amount of Ham I used with the Ham Hock was 4.5 cups. (It was left over from our Easter dinner).  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  :)

I quick soaked the beans first. Then, I followed other reviewers advice and decreased the amount of water in the pot with the beans to 6.5 cups (which was still too much in my opinion). I also added a whole peeled onion to the simmering beans, and discarded the onion at the very end with the ham bone. Next, I made sure to season the beans with salt, pepper, and a bit of dill weed before adding the chopped ham. Lastly, I ended up simmering the beans for much longer than the recipe called for to reduce the amount of liquid (about 1.5 additional hours). They are delicious though!

I used three different kinds of beans none of which were great northern, but I'm sure they would be excellent as well. Other than that, I stuck to this recipe and it really came out great!
We only have a couple more months of soup season. I'm sure I will make it a couple more times before it gets too hot.

In a hurry so used 5 cans of Northern Beans undrained. And 1 can Northern bean undrained and pureed in a blender to thicken. No water used.  Was a little too thick so added small amount of vegetable broth. Best ham and bean soup I've had. Will make again.

OMG GOOD! Of course, I started with my own stock ( a combination of previously frozen chicken stock, and stock I made from the ham bone  that remained after I picked it clean to make this soup)!  It seems logical that the quality of the ham makes a difference, too. I used a nice spiral sliced ham that we had already eaten from but had enough meat for a nice soup. The ham was very sweet because of the glaze I made for it  ( the one from the package, basically corn syrup  and even more sugar plus the flavorings (?). I drained off as much as possible of the fatty congealed  broth from the left over ham because I didn't want my soup to be overly sweet.  That got put in the freezer for beans/chili for later on. I  After putting the best meat aside, i boiled the remaining bone and whatever meat /gristle sticking to it for maybe 30-60 min or so minutes ( actually, brought to a boil and then simmered it).  Mostly followed recipe except following changes: used pinto beans and prepared mustard cuz it was what i had on hand, added tomato sauce and Tomato bouillon cuz looking for a redder color to match my beans. I wish i would have had canned diced tomato, that would have been awesome.   used plenty of potatoes and carrots cut in large chunks.  I added chopped green pepper.  I also think sweet peas would have been colorful and good, but my son ( 12 yrs old) was glad i didnt   add them!  Oh, was out of celery so i added generous amounts of celery salt as my only salt.  Really believe the

Excellent soup, I did pull aside some of the broth and mixed with flour to thicken.  Also, if using chicken broth as water replacement, ( I used 4 cups water and 4 cups Chicken Broth), use low sodium due to the salt in the ham and recipe.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

I have looked high and low for the perfect bean soup and this is it. The only thing I’ve changed is to omit the salt (too much for my taste) and substitute water with whatever amount of chicken broth I have in the refrigerator. If I have none,it’s all water and vice versa. No more do I soak beans overnight or slow cook it all day in a slow cooker.  But you can if you wish and that’s the beauty of this recipe. Just DO NOT substitute or replace anything. That’s the secret to the wonderful flavor. Thank you J.A.!

Delish! I used 4 cups chicken broth plus 1 cup water and the flavor was amazing. Didn’t have celery or bay leaf but didn’t miss either. The broth was absolutely delicious but I do like it a little thicker, so I took the advice of grinding up 2 cups of the soup to just thicken it a little bit.

It seemed flavorless so I think I would have used 2 ham hocks, and more of everything else except beans.    It had great potential and I’ll doctor it up next time.

this turned out so good, just added potatoes to bulk it up and some red pepper flakes to give it a kick. I love seeing recipes and then making them my own, but this one is spot on looking forward to my next ham bone.

I make ham stock from the New Year ham bone in the crockpot while the beans socked over night. I also puréed 1/2 a cup of the cooked beans and ham and added it back to the soup for a thicker soup. This recipe is a keeper for left over holiday ham.

I didn't have white pepper, so I just used regular black pepper. I also chopped up about 4 cooked strips of bacon.  I added a little more ham because I wanted more meat in this batch than the last batch. Turned out amazing.

Delicious!  I soaked my beans overnight and then followed the recipe using a crockpot instead of on the stove. My soup needed the salt that the recipe called for. This was a great use of my Christmas ham leftovers and was a hit with the extended family!  Use less water if you like thicker soup, but mine was fine with the 8 cups.

Delicious flavor. I used a small bone-in ham butt which I baked separately and then de-fatted the broth and cut meat into small cubes and added to soup. Cooked beans with the bone-in portion.  Otherwise followed as is. 
One note, it took a lot longer to cook beans until soft.

This was super good! I made it as stated except for throwing in a few extra onion slices and celery pieces. I simmered it on the stove, but left it on longer than suggested -- I added at least an hour to the recommended time. It was very flavorful and I will definitely come back to this recipe.

This  soup is yummy.  I lost my recipe so I used this but I used chicken broth and  about 2 cups of water. Also I cooked the bone and ham shank , for about 2 hours before I added the other items.  I also added bacon and the broth from my ham. My husband loved it and so did I.

Have made this a few times and I only do two things different from the recipe -- I soak the beans overnight and I use low sodium chicken broth.  Soaking the beans overnight keeps them from absorbing too much of the stock.  I do everything else exactly like the recipe and my family loves it!

Warning to others.  Pay attention to type of pepper. I made a mistake and used black pepper instead of white.   Way too much pepper and I had to try and fix it by removing some broth and adding some without pepper.  I made the stock overnight in the crock pot for a richer flavor and  I added some diced tomatoes.

This is really great. I followed Recipe exact and flavor was wonderful. I think the real contributors that make this excellent are a good Ham Hock, and the dry mustard. Excellent. Thanks for the Recipe.

This was delicious! The only difference I made to the recipe was to use chicken stock instead of water. This will definitely be a regular in our house.

My husband keeps telling me this is the BEST soup he's EVER had!!! So, it was  a hit.  I used an express method of cooking to get the beans softer faster.  I also used more veggies, and pureed about 2 cups of the beans and veggies after softened to thicken the soup.  It was absolutely delicious!!

Made this with a leftover ham bone with PLENTY of meat left on it. I didn't add any salt and swapped the water for low-sodium chicken broth. Even though the other flavors were good, it was WAY too salty for my taste.

I love this recipe, even though I strayed a bit. I liked Gusto's suggestion of making a stock with the ham bone, and I don't care for ham hocks, and I cooked my beans in an instant pot.I don't want to take anything away from the post, Those changes in the beginning and the rest of the recipe, produced the soup I grew up on. Awesome! Thanks.

First let me say I am not a bean soup person. I have disliked bean soup since I was a child, many many decades ago.  I made this for my husband and friends. Cooked it in the slow cooker and forgot the bay leaf. Oops! My husband ate two bowls the night it was done. I divided most of the rest and packed it up for my friends. I had to taste it since I made it and was I surprised. I finally found a bean soup I can enjoy. My husband finished up what I kept and my friends gave it rave reviews. Now I have to make more in the near future. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe. So simple but oh so delicious.

I made this today for dinner.
I had made bacon for breakfast, so I sautéed the onion, carrots and celery in 1 TBSP of bacon fat, and this added quite a bit of flavor. I also used 1/2 low sodium chicken broth and 1/2 water. I also used 8 oz of Great Northern beans and 1/2 pinto bean, which was what I had on hand. My husband said this was the best bean soup I have ever made. We loved this soup! Thanks for the recipe and reviews!

Love this soup. Made as stated with water and chicken broth. At the end if it’s too watery I add dried instant mashed potatoes. You’ve added a veggie and it thickens the broth - instantly.

Super easy and so so good. Even the kids enjoy it. We added a Portuguese sausage as well (skin linguica) and it added an extra layer of flavor.

Great soup with delicious flavors!  I only added chicken broth to Supplement  the water, and 2tbsp Liquid Smoke!  It was yummy and my husband said it was the best soup he’d ever had!  He’s not normally a soup lover.

Made this yummy soup using a ham bone from Christmas. I made a slight modification and used chicken stock instead of water for the base of the soup. The soup was really tasty and was even better as leftovers, as the broth thickened. Next time I may not use the bone of the ham, because of the fat that boiled off. This may have been why it was so tasty, but next time I’ll use cut up ham pieces.

The recipe as it stands is seriously lacking but provides a good base. 1.) you need to soak the beans overnight  2.) Dont use water as the base for the soup. Use low sodium chicken stock and add NO salt. 3.) I use 2 pounds of beans and add 2 cups of frozen yellow corn. You can also add 2 large cubed and peeled potatoes.

So good, and not hard at all to make! I used chicken broth rather than water, and it was super rich. We ended up adding more water, which was good since it had so much substance to it. Will definitely make again.

4 stars since I made a few simple changes. Boiled ham first for 1-1/2 hours and cleaned meat from bone - reserved liquid.
 Added 2T minced garlic and one finely diced potato. Sweated all in pot w/2T oil before adding other ingredients.
32 oz low sodium chicken broth and added reserved ham broth as needed.
Only seasoning needed was a little bit of pepper. Did not need salt. Thickened nicely and was delicious.

I followed directions , added 4 cups chicken stock in place of 4 cups of water. Mine turned out slightly bland, I actually ADDED a little salt and I almost never add salt to anything. It was wonderful.

Like some others, I made a ham stock first, by simmering ham bone, vegetables, and spices for several hours.  Added the stock and the bone to the beans after straining it.  Added vegetables after beans were nearly done.  I also used fresh Savory in this recipe as I do for almost all my bean recipes.  It is one of my most essential spices.

made as directed - no need to go an make stock etc...this is as it is called BASIC Ham and Bean soup.  Very good - perfect consistency between soup and stew.  Just simmer longer if your beans aren't to your liking...not rocket science - basic soup.  Thank for sharing this delicious recipe.

A very good day to day recipe that doesn't try to make a culinary delight out of a work-a-day meal.  The spices are subtle but make the overall soup satisfying.  Cornbread is a must.

This basic recipe was nice.  I used a ham bone from a Honey Baked Ham rather than a ham hock.  It turned out great!  When I make bean soup, I'll use a smoked ham hock, which has more flavor.  As far as the beans, I will cover them with water, bring them to a boil, turn off the heat, put on a lid then let them soak for a couple of hours.  Then I drain and rinse.  It takes down the "gas factor", if you know what I mean.   Thanks for posting!

Totally followed the recipe, except used dry pinto beans.  Soaked them and didn't drain the water.  Used a leftover meaty ham bone.  Was very good!

We liked this recipe very much. I used two ham hocks and no additional ham.  I also used 4 cans of chicken broth, about 5 cups, instead of water.

I did these in a crockpot.  I soaked the beans in the crockpot overnight, then dumped the water off in the morning before turning the crockpot on.  I used a ham hock as well as the chopped ham.  I didn't have fresh onion, so I used a bit less than 1/4 cup of dried chopped onion.  My family is a little garlic-adverse, so I only used 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic.  I used black pepper instead of white.  I dissolved 6 chicken bullion cubes into 6 cups of hot water instead of using 8 cups of water, which is like using 6 cups of chicken broth.  I did not add salt.  Cooked in the crockpot on low for about 6 hours.  I think it turned out great!  I will make again.

I found it a little bland.  I added some ham base found in the soup aisle in a jar.  I didn't have a ham bone.

Made this after Easter and it was delicious.  Used 3 cloves of chopped garlic as I usually add more then a recipe calls for.  Almost forgot the dry mustard and so glad I added it.  It brought up the savory flavor a notch.  Shared with neighbors and they loved it as well!  Even my 2 teenagers liked it!  Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe twice now both times substituted with a smoked turkey leg,  the remaining ingredients of the recipe as written. Delicious, thick hearty soup!  Soaked white northern beans overnight before cooking. Beans were tender and soup was nice and thick. Love it.

I have made this soup twice! So delicious! As much as I hate it when others do this, I did tweak it slightly. I soaked the beans overnight the second time because I live in a high altitude and the soup took 3 1/2 hours to completely cook the beans. I used great northern bean/pinto bean mix (at the request of my BF) and omitted the mustard, but added 2 TBS of chicken base (I didn't have any ham base). I added 3 small potatoes cut into chunks to add to the heartiness.  I also added a few sprigs of thyme as well as the bay leaves. This soup recipe is definitely a must have recipe for my household!

Yumalicious!  But i made some changes: I did not add salt, because I added a heavy tsp of "better than bouillion"  chicken base.
I found soup to be thin so I took a can of refried beans with no fat and some of the hot liquid. I blended that together, then added that to the pot. 
I  used 2 cans of beans undrained at the end of cooking instead of the dried navy beans .
Flavor and desired consistency was perfect!

Great recipe!  i used it as a base really...I've never used dried beans or boiled a ham bone before.  We had a nice old fashioned ham for dinner (butt portion) and I had leftovers.  I trimmed it down as best I could and boiled the bone with a large amount of meat on it for about 2 hours with a celery stalk and large onion wedge.  I put 4 chicken bullion cubes in the water during the last hour.   In a seperate pot I soaked the beans for 3 hours (cold), then brought them to a boil for 3 minutes, covered and let it sit for an hour.  Then drained and rinsed them.  Strained the stock and added to it the beans, minced onion, celery, carrots and spices (i didn't use the mustard, and i added thyme). Amazing!

This is THE Ham and Bean soup to make! The only change I make is to add chicken/ham stock (Home made)about 1 1/2 qt. per pound of dried beans, instead of water to cook the beans and ham bone in, and add about 4 stalks of celery....everything is the same, only I double the ham, and the pepper. I also soak the beans overnight in just plain water, drain, rinse and then cook for several hours the next day. I also don't add salt until the end- taste first- the ham can be salty enough. Mash some beans against the side of the pot to thicken it, or use a stick blender right in the pot for a bit to puree just some of it, but not all of it. Delicious!

This soup is amazing.  I did nor make any additions. I had a ham bone and some residual meat frozen from a few months back. I put it in the soup and deboned it after an hour of cooking. 

Absolutely delicious!

Beans definitely need more soaking time .. After 3 hours they were hard in center so I cooked on med. heat about an hour, then simmered 2 more hours. I dumped bean water after 3 hours and coked in 4 cups vegetable broth bad 4 cups water. Definitely needs thickening .. When I added the ham the last 30 mins. I made a bean paste with 1 can great northern beans and stirred into soup. Tasted awesome! Oh and remove those bay leaves .. Recipe failed to mention! I'd make this again.

Very good - I used a spiral ham bone and chopped the leftover ham after it had cooked in my slo w cooker for several hours.  I used navy beans, which took quite a while to tenderize, even though they soaked all night.  I added a diced potato and a 1/4 t. Cayenne pepper and my husband really liked it!

We loved this recipe. I made a couple of changes I used my ham bone from Christmas with some ham still on it and let it cook off into the soup I did not add any additional ham. I used 2 cups homemade chicken stock and 6 cups water. It tasted a lot like my Grandmas bean soup!

My family really enjoys this soup. I followed one reviewer 's recommendation to make broth from a ham bone. I  chill it overnight, then remove and save the fat. I use a small amount of the saved fat for sauteing the vegetables and use the broth instead of water for my soup. I don't add any salt, so each person can season it as they prefer. I serve it with cornbread and everyone, including the grandchildren, love it!

The BEST ham and bean soup according to my super picky husband that doesn't normally like ham and bean soup and ate 3 bowls!! I added a little extra mustard and white pepper and a dash of cayenne. I cooked it in my electric pressure cooker for 17 minutes, NPR for 15 then QR. Added about 1 1/2-2 cups diced carrots, cooked another 8 minutes, NPR for 15 then QR. Start to finish in 55 minutes! (Sorry for all the electric pressure cooker lingo but thought this may help someone else :)

This soup was good, however, it was really all beans and no "soup". Next time I make it, I am going to increase the water by 2-3 cups and will add more vegetables as they got lost in the beans.

This was so easy to follow. I used chicken broth instead of water and doubled the carrot and onion. I also added cabbage to the recipe. This was a big hit!

I didn't have a ham bone so I rendered down some salt pork and sautéed all the vegetables in the grease (after removing the solids), then added the vegetables to 3 cans of white beans, water, and 1 pound of shaved deli ham.  It is amazing! 
I am serving it with a warm loaf of sour dough bread.

Loved this but after many more hours than stated here.  I followed the guidelines but my beans were not done for a couple more hours.  We managed to eat them at dinner but the whole dish was MUCH better later.  Allow more time with raw beans or use canned ones.

Delicious recipe. I used a spiral cut ham bone and the flavor was wonderful. Like others, I soaked my beans overnight, and I also blended up a few cups of the cooked  beans to thicken the broth. I will make this recipe again, but the next time, I may add more beans and ham for a more hearty soup.

I, like other reviewers, used 4 cups chicken broth (so I omitted the salt ) and 4 cups of water and cooked the veggies prior to adding the beans.

I always make some changes, I used a smoked pork hock to make the broth separate from the beans using celery onions and carrots. Then pulled the meat off the bone put the big bones and broth in with the beans after I did a quick soak cooking everything together.(reserving the meat until it was done) -as always my hubby and family love beans :) Thanks!!

I used chicken stock instead of water, and put all of it in the slow cooker for about 8 hours. Thickened with a little corn starch and water. Absolutely wonderful! Will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe as is. I did need to use a little cornstarch rue to thicken it up, only because this is the way my family prefers it. This is definitely a keeper of a recipe and have made it several times now

I made this exactly as written except that I added more than 2 cups of chopped ham, because you can never have too much ham! This was absolutely the best ham and bean soup I've ever made. Thank you for sharing the recipe.  Its my new favorite!

I made this recipe but I did follow some reviewers and substituted chicken broth for the water. It is a super easy and very delicious recipe.

This soup is seriously delicious!!! I had a bag of Pride of the Mill 13-Bean soup mix and bought a meaty ham bone at Honey Ham. Soaked the beans for 24 hours - never knew this was to "de-gas" them but, okay, thanks for that. Cooked for two hours on simmer, covered, removed the bone and meaty pieces to clean and chop. Also, used half chicken broth and water. Putting it in the fridge to cool - if it doesn't thicken up some, may process a cup or so but prefer a soupy texture over thick.

One of the best Ham and Bean recipes ever! I used left over chunks of ham, chopped, from Christmas and didn't change a thing.  I froze portions, and defrosted and ate it over a two month period - it was delicious! Thank you so much very sharing this recipe.

This is a tasty, cheap and easy dinner. I used leftover ham and more than stated. I also soaked the beans for about a day and half in cold water, dumped the water, rinsed beans again and then sautéed some cut carrots, celery and garlic in olive oil (used tons more veggies than recipe stated) before adding the beans and water. I let mine cook about 1-1 1/2hrs over a rolling boil. One of my kids really enjoyed this, the other liked the beans but not the ham.  Hubby and I really enjoyed it. Top the soup with grated Parmesan.

This is very good made according to the directions. My husband especially likes it. It turned out to be more of a stew than a soup (thicker) and the beans were a bit soft. I will cut back on the cook time by 15 minutes next time and reduce the seasonings a bit. I have a new electric range, so it may be cooking a bit hot.

The only change I made was using low sodium chicken broth instead of water since this was the second soup I made with my ham bone (my mother in law's brilliant suggestion). Other than that, I followed everything exactly. It is so delicious and now my freezer will be stocked all winter with two delicious soups. Who am I kidding? It's so good, it probably won't last a week. :)

This was so hearty on a cold winter's day. I cheated a bit and used canned beans (great northern white), which meant I only needed about 1/2 the liquid. The only trick was, I needed about 7 cups of liquid to boil my ham hock. So... I took other people's advice and used chicken stock instead of water to cook the hock. Then, I removed about 3 cups of liquid before I did anything else. You can save that for another batch, and you won't have to boil another ham hock:). After that, it was really a matter of removing the hock, dumping the remaining ingredients in and letting it cook to your desired thickness. Serve with corn bread. Mmmmm. Delish!

Absolutely awesome.  I made this for the wife and in-laws and everyone loved it.  Perfect on a cold winter's day looking out at the Wisconsin snow from the warmth of the house while watching football.  :)

This was easy and very flavorful....but I too read reviews and added chicken broth instead of some of the water to add some taste.  I used turkey ham as well - the texture of that meat has something to be desired, but was still good.

I used organic low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  I doubled the amount of vegetables.  Like others, after cooking 7 hours in the slow cooker, I puréed about half the soup and then added it back in to thicken it up.  My family loved it!! They did notice it was sweeter than most bean soups, which is because I used a honey baked ham instead of regular.

This was so good! I took the advice on some of the other reviews  and cooked the ham bone for a couple of hours before adding the other ingredients.  My husband went back for thirds.

The soup turned out great, for being the first time I ever made a soup.  I had a 13 bean soup mix to use.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.  Made in a 8 qt slow cooker.  My family enjoyed it so much, it disappeared quickly.  I will definitely be making again.  Thank you.

First of all, 5 stars because my husband is a great cook and made a lot of adjustments to this recipe.  I started off following the recipe, and once it was at the simmer for the second 60 min mark I tasted it and it was super bland.  So I asked my husband (who loves to cook and is a huge foodie) to taste it and help me make it taste better.  He added about 2 tsp more salt, dried oregano, pepper, fish sauce (he is half Vietnamese and uses this stuff in everything) and we had to cook it for about 2 hours longer than what this recipe called for.  I also added 3 times the amount of celery, twice the amount of garlic and carrot, and about the same amount of onion. (I like veggies in my soup!)  With the adjustments my husband made, it turned out WONDERFUL.  This soup was exactly what I was caving on this cold rainy day, and I would make it again (with the same adjustments.)

I made this today and our family absolutely loved it.  Even my 12 year old had some and he is a picky eater.  I took the advice from some reviews about soaking the beans over night.  I didn't change anything else and it turned out delicious.  It does serve a lot so we will be having leftovers.  
Great recipe.  We will be doing this next time we have a ham bone.

I soaked the beans over night. If you soak the beans over night, reduce the amount of water in the recipe. Mine didnt come out anywhere near as thick as it should have. The flavor however is still Deeeelish.

Great recipe, but made minor changes based on other reviews. First, I soaked the beans overnight. Second, I replaced the 8 cups of water with 7 cups of low sodium chicken broth. Third,  I left out the salt since the broth and the ham bone provide plenty.  It turned out very delicious, can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.

Don't add any salt, a ham has plenty. I added about 3 cups of small pcs of Kale with all the veins removed. The dried mustard was a great ingredient, I have never used in soup.   I  cooked down my ham bone a few days ago and removed the fat while it was cold . I added a quart of chicken broth.  Yum

11-28-15 ~ I had two ham bones in the freezer taking up space.  Tried my hand at bean soup, which I do not enjoy, but my family does.  They though it was good, but want me work on the thickness of the soup, the next time.  Overall, they thought this was very good and would have me make it again.

It was great. My family loved it. I soaked the beans overnight as suggested. Threw out the water. Used 3 cups water and 3 1/2 cups chicken broth instead of the 8 cups suggested. It made for a hearty soup. I would double the recipe to have seconds.

I used canned assorted beans and chicken and vegetable stock instead of water.  I mashed some of the beans into the soup to thicken it, as I like a thick soup. I only used ham as we don't have ham hocks here.  Very tasty soup.  Served with cheddar biscuits. Delish.

This is my go to recipe for bean soup.  The only thing I do differently is substitute the ham hock for diced ham and that is just family preference for the kids.  Have not changed anything else to this recipe.

It was delicious except I should have left out the bay leaves. I will definitely omit the bay leaves from this recipe from now on. I didn't care for the flavor they added to the soup. The soup was delicious other than that. I also used 8 cups low sodium chicken stock instead of water, which I will do every time I make this soup.

I didn't have a lot of time to make it so I used canned beans. It was ready have an hour of boiling down but still too thin for my liking, so I thickened it with a bit of flour. Yum!

This was all right but it wasn't my favorite. It wasn't super flavorful and I tend to like a thicker ham and bean soup and this was rather watery.

This is the second time that I've made this soup and my family loves it.  I  de-gassed the beans as one cook suggested (it works!) and reduced the liquid to 6 cups of chicken broth, no water, plus I puréed about three cups of the soup mixture for a creamier texture.  I also added about two cups of chopped fresh kale at the end with the diced ham.  The result -- a delicious hearty soup.

I wanted to make ham and bean soup with a left over bone from a spiral cut ham.  Last year my husband said the recipe I made was too salty, so I tried this recipe.  After reading the reviews, I decided to leave out the salt.  I didn't have mustard powder so I substituted 1 Tbsp. of prepared mustard.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  My soup was thick.  My husband said it needed salt (go figure).  I would rather add salt than have too much.  So I added extra water to each individual serving so the beans wouldn't soak up the water in the pot.  My husband added salt to his and said it tasted good but thought it was a little bland.

This recipe is a good idea, but is quite bland.  Follow the other reviews and make some adjustments:
1. Soak beans over night
2. Double the celery
3. ADD SPICES.  I used oregeno, rosemary, and seasoning salt.  The broth just tastes like water otherwise.
4. Puree 1/2 the soup after it's cooked and add it back in.  It gives it a much creamer consistancy.  
With revisions, it's a quite tasty soup!

I have tried this recipe and have found that you can use the beans that are already cooked and in a jar so you don't have to fool around with soaking them. Just strain the liquid and fill the jar three quarters of the way up and use that for your stock. I also use 6 strips of bacon to make it a little heartier. Most grocery stores have ham that is already presliced or cubed making this the easiest recipe there is with little to no effort.

This is a great recipe! I like to mash some of the beans in the end to make it a little thicker, but not too many! I usually don't measure my vegetables 'cause you can't have too much. It is perfect with leftover ham and a great way to use a ham bone.

Good recipe but I always add more veggies. I also add a few teaspoons of Horseradish to my bean soups to give it just a boost of flavor.

Like this easy, simple soup!  Soaked beans overnight then cooked all ingredients in crock pot all day on low except for 1-1/2 hrs on high mid-day.

I would love to make this with a ham bone, but it was still very good with turkey ham.  I threw in the little bit of cauliflower I had left over and it just disappeared into the soup--ideal for my veggie averse family.  Also made it in my pressure cooker, perfect for very mushy beans--what we like.

I didn't have the ham bone, just leftover meat.  So, that may be why mine didn't have much flavor.

I used smoked turkey instead of ham, 16 bean soup instead of Northern beans. The soup was hearty but I thought it lacked flavor and needed a lot more seasoning.

I liked this recipe.  I used chicken broth and omitted the salt.  I also had some leftover mashed potatoes so I threw them in at the end for thickening.  It would have been fine without them.  Served with cornbread ... Yum!

This soup is OK, but I'm not a huge ham/bean soup eater.  The reason I'm rating this a 3-star aside from that, is that I had to practically double all of the spice ingredients in order for my soup to taste like soup and not water.  I even cooked it longer than suggested to get all the flavor out of the bone.  Maybe my ham bone wasn't a good one.

Have to say pretty BLAND. I am going to buy chicken base and add a tablespoon as someone suggested to see if that helps. I had such high hopes but won't make it again unless I can doctor it up and make it more palatable.

I made it in the crockpot and i must have a small crockpot because after adding all the other ingredients i didn't have enough room for the total liquid so mine came out more stew like. It was alright.  We didn't care for it too much, but then again we aren't stew/soup people.  Good basic recipe though

Pretty good.  I added red chili pepper.  I may have added a little to much, it was pretty spicy.  Beans were good and next time I will use a ham bone instead of just chopped ham.

The broth and flavor of this soup was really good. I used the nine bean soup mix bag (cause it was on hand) and wish I would have stuck to just the northern beans. There is a bean in the bag mix that stays crunchy and it's just weird.

Outstanding! The one change I made was I did, like others did, decrease the amount of water to 6 cups rather than 8. The soup came out rich and mellow, with a thickness that was just right. Not too watery, not too pasty. I will make this many times again.

Delish!  I wish I would have read the reviews first because I definitely would have cut back on the water.  Instead I added a large cube of veggie bouillon and used my hand blender a bit to thicken and flavor the broth.

Very good! And since this is a "Basic" recipe I won't nitpick, but suffice to say, I'm still looking for that perfect recipe.

Great recipe!  My only change was how I cooked the beans.  I brought water (substituting 1/2 the water with chicken stock) and the ham hock and beans to a simmer.  I covered and simmered for 1/2 hour, then let the pot sit until cool and refrigerated overnight.  The next day, I skimmed off any fat and reheated.  Once the soup was at a low simmer, I added all other ingredients EXCEPT the chopped ham.  I cooked veges, beans and the ham hock on low heat for another couple of hours and then about 1/2 hour before eating I added the chopped ham.  The soup was great!

I made this as listed - almost.  I did take the advice of others and substituted 1/2 of the water for chicken broth.  Also, I didn't have a full bag of Northern Beans so I made up the difference with Pinto Beans.  The outcome was surprisingly good.  My only complaint was that it was pretty salty so next time I'll be sure to use low sodium chicken broth.  Overall, very good recipe deserving of 5 stars since it got my 9, 7, and 5 year olds (not to  mention my husband) to eat beans.

This soup tasted great!  I didn't have a ham bone so I used 3 cups chopped ham left over from Christmas dinner.  Also, I brought my dry beans to a rapid boil and then removed from heat and let sit for 4 hours.  When it was time to finish the soup I drained the beans and filled with 6 cups fresh water; the beans only had to cook for an hour before they were tender.  I then added my ham and cooked for another 20 minutes.  I like my bean soup to be thick.  If you have the time I recommend this method.  I made "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" by BETHANYWEATHERSBY also on allrecipes.  It was a great accompaniment to the soup.

I doubled this and am so glad I did!  This was the best ham and bean soup I have had bar none.  My dad has had a lot of bean soup in his day and he said he could eat this recipe daily.  I only changed a few things to suit our particular tastes. 1-I used half water and half chicken broth 2-Once the soup was ready, I pureed 6 cups of it in my food processor to make it more stew like than soup like.  I had enough for a meal with leftovers and 2 meals to freeze.

Very good.  I made with split peas and lentils since I burned my beans and didn't feel like going out to the store for more.  I did add some hot sauce for flavor.  Very good.

Really fantastic!  $5.00 to feed a family of 6!  I choose a medley of beans and "de-gassed" them like someone else suggested, that worked like a charm.  I soaked the beans for the afternoon after I degassed them and then used chicken stock instead of water.  I also blended 2-3 cups right before serving...not an essential step just depends if you like a creamy texture or a broth based texture.

I thought it might be a little too watery at first- but I let it simmer for a few hours, and that really allowed all the flavors to come together.  Delicious!

Not quite what I expected.  I was disappointed.  I made a double batch too.  The beans seemed to turn mushy, even though I cooked this as instructed.  What I'm doing to compensate for it's thickness is adding water before reheating and it seems to help.  Despite all of the seasonings I added, it still lacked some flavor and I found myself having to add more directly to my bowl.  I'll keep looking for another ham and bean soup recipe.

Very good, very easy, and very inexpensive!  I made this for my family's Christmas eve meal and got rave reviews.  To fancy it up for Christmas, I used a spriral sliced ham and it was wonderful, but Before I just used a ham hock and it was equally good.

This was okay for me.  My husband liked it better than me, but as I made it, I am sticking to my rating.  I usually love mustard, but it didn't taste right for me in this recipe.  Perhaps if I eliminate that in the future, it may be a lot better.  I will try that next time, as I think that would really make this soup for me.

I was so disappointed that this soup wasn't it for me. The only thing i changed was used 1/2 water and 1/2 veggie stock. After 10 hours in the crockpot it tasted just like broth out of a can. I think I have been spoiled by my gram's ham and bean soup, i just can't find any like it!

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  I made a few minor changes:  used 4 cups of low sodium chicken broth, 2 ham shanks and no salt.  I removed the meat from the shanks (1 cup) and then added 1 cup of ham.

Great soup and I don't like ham and bean soup!  I used 1/2 veggie broth and 1/2 water.  Didn't have any bay leaves so I used a little poultry seasoning.  Also didn't have a ham bone, just left over ham from Easter.  It was great!  Much better than the first time I made it when I prepared exactly as the recipe reads.  I think the veggie broth was what made it great!

A great recipe for left-over holiday ham! I didn't use the hock. I subbed canned small white beans (4) instead of dry beans. I also added 1 jar of petite diced tomatoes and added a bit more celery. This soup was devoured by my family.

Very good. Used some chicken broth, and pureed some of the beans to make the broth thicker. My son, the picky eater, ate all of his. Thanks for the recipe, much better than canned soup.

I used the bone from my  my Thanksgiving Day ham and i must say- i was hoping this soup would have more flavor... I thought it was lacking something but i am not exactly sure what. I will keep trying and next time will not use our spiral ham bone.

I have to give this 3 stars unfortunately because it just wasn't up to my expectations. The beans weren't soft enough even after 2 hours of soaking and an additional 20 minutes of cooking time. I didn't add the ham hock because I didn't have one but instead added some cooked and cut up bacon pieces. I think the broth was good but needed a ton more seasoning. I would have preferred the soup to be a bit thicker consistency also, it just seemed really runny. I will probably make again but with some changes.

Easy.  All ingredients in the house.  Very tasty and basic.  Only change was to follow another reviewer's suggestion and pureed half the beans to give it a better texture.

I didn't care for this recipe that much.  My husband said you either like bean soup or you don't and I guess I don't.  He said he liked it, but he wouldn't take it to work for lunch and it is now sitting in our fridge and no one will eat it.

Very good soup.  I used about half chicken broth, no salt, and extra garlic, and I cooked the beans a little longer before adding the rest of the ingredients.  It turned out very well.

This is quite good!  I used 4 cups of chicken broth to start and added more as needed.  I kept the recipe the same, except to finely chop the ham in a food processor.  A good weekday lunch soup!  Thank you

I used canned beans instead of dry because I didn't have time to soak them.  I also used half chicken broth/half water per the suggestion of others.  I thought it was good, not great and overall a little bland.  I have some leftover right now that I'm going to try and flavor with some more spices.

the smell was worth 5 stars, but the taste was a little bit blander than I would have liked. This kept perfectly in freezer bags for over three months! I will make this again.

This was absolutely delicious!  I cooked it longer than called for and used only cubed ham, no garlic (husband can't handle), and no bay leaves.  Perfect and even my daughter in law and grand daughter loved it and they don't eat ham and beans!!!

This soup was delicious!  My family really enjoyed it.  I took the advice of another viewer and made cornbread to go with it.  I also cooked it in the crock pot after having the beans soak over night.  Thank you for sharing!!

Really great taste, but my dried beans took longer than expected.  I brought them to a boil (no salt), then let them sit overnight in the water.  Tough.  Prepared the recipe as written (added a little chicken broth base and diced potatoes).  Still tough!  Reheated two days later.  Not tough.  Next time I'll use canned beans.

Very easy and with an addition of 2-3 chicken boullion cubes (since I had no mustard powder) it was a hit with my family.  Also, I tried using a salt pork instead of a ham bone and thought it was absolutely delicious!

I made this on a Sunday mid morning and it was ready by lunch. Perfect for gameday when the guys want to snack all day.
I used my leftover Honeybaked Ham bone and poured the juices in when the hambone went in.

Wow This is delicious! I can't believe that I made soup that tastes this good! I did have to cook it a bit longer than the recipe to get the beans cooked thoroughly. I added one can of chicken broth toward the end as it needed a bit more liquid. This was VERY VERY salty. I wish I had not added any salt. But, the ham does dictate that this will be a salty dish. I should have put some cut up potato slices in to absorb the salt. I will be sure to use reduced sodium broth next time. I used a bone from our spiral sliced honey ham and used 2 cups of leftover ham from this.  Thanks so much for the submission!

This soup was excellent!  The only thing I found was that it needed more liquid toward the end of the cooking time, so I added more water.  It was perfect and had wonderful flavor.

Great base recipe.  Even my 10 year old liked it!  I added about 4 or 5 tsp. of chicken base (boullion would work) to the water.  Also added some garlic powder, more celery and thickened it with a little cornstarch when done cooking.  I will make again.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  If the ham bone is meaty the two cups of ham is not needed.  My husband and I enjoyed this soup.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was so, so bland...the seasonings were the right ones but i had to triple the amounts and then add some liquid smoke.  the final result was really good, i will probably make again with same adjustments.
