The technique of baking the onions and finishing them on the stove is genius and gave me time to get other things done. Layering the flavors intensifies the deliciousness (deglazing the pan with vinegar and wine). The consistency of the soup was perfect. I used balsamic vinegar and red wine in place of the sherry and asiago and gruyere in place of the sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack I used more thyme and a bay leaf in the stock. We had Caesar salad with it and a glass of Italian red wine.

Thank you for a tasty recipe! This was yummy. It's definitely not a traditional french onion, but it was a nice change of pace! I think my onions were a little big, because there were a lot in there, but the broth was soooo good!  Easy to make too! It's a keeper!

I tried this recipe exactly as written and deem it to be snackey.  I generally like French Onion soup and order it in restaurants when they feature it so I can compare it to what I make.  Theirs seldom measures up. This one is very good, much easier to make and takes a lot less time than my my version.  I buttered both sides of the crouton up and toasted both sides up so that the crouton is extremely dried out then the cheeses Chef John suggested.  This allows the crouton to suck up as much of that delicious broth as possible.   It's heavenly comfort food. 
I think this recipe however should come with some sort of a disclaimer which Chef John should have included...  Please don't watch the video as you cook this recipe, I'm sure Chef John will not be responsible for any half eaten computer screens.

I hope you read my review before trying this recipe and find my comments helpful!
The total cooking time is in error, confusing and needs to be corrected.  The recipeâ€™s directions indicate that the total cooking time is 1 hour and 20 minutes.  However, the steps in the recipe indicate that the cooking time is over 2 hours.   
The bread can easily be browned in the oven after the onions are removed from the oven and placed on the stove top to cook.  I turned off the oven when I removed the onions and browned my bread in the oven when it was off.    
This is a mild tasting onion soup.  I prefer a more savory onion soup and added Worcestershire sauce and red wine to the finished soup.

This was excellent!  Not salty and had a "good finish" in the mouth.  Used all beef broth but no other changes.  A KEEPER!!

This had a really good flavor to it.  I didn't make it with the bread because I was already making grilled cheese for my son although I will have to try it the original way.  I have never made french onion soup, I was glad for the easy instructions but it was a very time consuming recipe.  Apparently this was the less time consuming version so I'm glad that I chose it.

This is a wonderfully flavored soup and the diced onions and onion baking shortcuts are definitely a plus over traditional French onion soup. Of the three soups I served tonight, this was the least popular.

This recipe is wonderful.  I make the base and store it in the refrigerator. Then when we're ready for soup I just warm up a couple bowls of the base, toast a few slices of bread, grate the cheese, assemble and bake.  In less than 15 minutes we've got a tasty bowl of French Onion Soup with an American attitude.

I will definitely make this again. My husband said it was the best onion soup EVER!  Took longer to accomplish than the time posted but it was worth it.  Allow at least two hours from start to finish and maybe a little longer.  Didn't change anything although I did not have unsalted butter so used salted nor did I have Sherry Vinegar so used wine vinegar instead.  It was delicious !

Delicious! I used my Le Creuset so I could cut down on pans (went in the oven with onions, them used as soup pot in the stove). Sliced onions on a mandolin to make prep quicker. I also used only beef broth (that's all I had) and added browning seasoning to kick up the Umami. Used only Gruyere.

I made this following the recipe to a tee. Its good soup but it seems to be missing something... I followed a similer recipe that used gruyer (sp) cheese which I thought tasted a bit better.

No changes to this recipe other than I just camelized the onions on top of the stove instead of in the oven  and then on the stove. It was very good!

Super yummy. I was intrigued at using the oven to make this soup, thinking the onions would obtain a roasted flavor. What a treat! Try this soup. It's amazing. Chef John you never disappoint!

Complete and total awesomeness!  The 2 hours plus of cooking is totally worth it because it cooks down to this thick and rich broth that is so restaurant worthy.  I did miss the traditional cheese on top but what's stopping me?  Not a thing.  I love it...it's the best french onion I've made at home.

Excellent! Taste was on point. I added another generous splash of sherry right before serving and made grilled cheese croutons with sourdough and havarti rather than broiling the cheese over the top because I was taking it to someoneâ€™s house. My guy was over the moon about it!

I made this soup with extra onion and garlic because my husband and I both had a cold. I made this soup with both Cheddar/Monterrey jack and Swiss. Both turned out great. I used low salt broth and the au jus sauce made it great. Last but not least, this soup is fast to make.

Really Good! Followed instruction exactly except I made half the amount and I used sweet onions instead of yellow. It was very mild.  Hubby loved it and he's a connesieur of onion soups....said it was "restaurant quality"- high praise for him. Easy recipe, just takes time.

Oh my goodness! This was soooo good.  Best French Onion soup we have ever had.  Not salty and very flavorful, unlike any soup you could get in a restaurant.  Halved the recipe for my husband and I and we had a hearty bowl plus a third bowl left over. Prepared the recipe as written, with the exception of using Swiss and Provolone cheese and used a multi grain bread for the toast. I made it a few days ahead so it would be an easy dinner to prepare after work.  Thank you so much......AWESOME!!!

At first I thought the sherry was too strong so I added probably a cup to cup and a half more beef broth.  Now it's good and once I added the bread and cheese, I didn't even taste the sherry.

I've made French Onion soup from a recipe perfected over 20 years.  I had a 'hankering for some soup, so thought this recipe looked simple, with everything on hand to complete it...  It was a SIMPLE recipe to duplicate, and IMHO vastly better than my own.  The layered flavors of Sherry and Red Wine Vinegar are glorious - but use care (as suggested in the video) with the vinegar..  Make it on your next cold damp day.  Perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly.  We invited a couple last minute for dinner tonight. We all thought it was great.  Chef John never lets me down.

This soup was delicious but you definitely need to serve it in appetizer portions because it is so rich.

Great comfort food for those cold Florida evenings (73F)!  Warms you right up with delicious flavor profiles. Long process for soup but a well delivered video and written directions actually makes the build quite easy.  However, one would think Sherry is readily available at major stores... just not to be!  Great recipe and well recommended.

This is very good and much easier than the traditional method.  Slicing the onions this way is faster and to me tastes the same.  I ended up making it in 2 pots because I underestimated the amount of onions - it's a lot!

Everyone fell for it! I made a change. We are pure vegetarians. So I used vegetable broth. It took an hour but turned out fantastic!

I carmelized the onions on the stove instead of the oven. It worked great! Great soup!

Even though I overcooked the onions a bit, the overall flavour was excellent.  Only one thing I would recommend is to make sure to not add the salt until after the hourâ€™s simmer is complete.  I added the salt and pepper as the simmer was underway; there is some reduction during that time, which in turn intensifies the saltiness.  
I made this with a mix of cheddar and mozzarella on homemade French bread.  I would make this for company any time. Delicious. Thanks Chef John.  UPdate: if using salted butter don't add any other salt to the soup.

I wasnâ€™t a fan of the sherry but itâ€™s maybe a personal preference . Next time Iâ€™m going to use red wine and mozzarella cheese

Loved this soup!  I did add two beef bouillon cubes and never really got my onions to brown in the oven. Substituted Cabernet for sherry as I did not have sherry on hand. Family loved it also.

Did the onions on the cooktop. Used Brandy rather than Sherry. Use Apple Cider vinegar rather than Sherry vinegar. Added about a T of Worcestershire Sauce.

I made one significant change:  As I did not have any FRENCH bread on hand, I added a package of fresh tortoleni to the soup. It was terrific!
