Reduced sour cream & mayo, no salad dressing, no butter milk and used Milwaukee Iron Seasoning in place of cayenne. I make it every Sunday.

Wonderful with pulled pork on a sandwich; great as a side dish. I mixed green and red cabbage with one carrot, grated. Omitted the celery seed.  Also cut down the cayenne to between an eighth and a quarter of a teaspoon - plenty of zing without being too hot. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

I needed a coleslaw recipe for my pulled pork and this was perfect. I did cut down the cayenne to 1/2 tsp and it was still quite spicy, great for the sandwiches but a bit much as a stand alone slaw. I will definitely make this again. Thanks

Turned out great but was really spicy (especially the next day). We will try it again but with much less cayenne.
