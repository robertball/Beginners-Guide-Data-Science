I made this with my kids and they loved decorating the cookies. As far as taste goes, these were just okay. Cooking for 5 minutes was definitely off. They needed at least 8-9 minutes. We prefered them crispier than chewy so we cooked longer than even that. Also, the rolling of the dough was a bit difficult. I won't make these again.

Everyone who tried these cookies when I made them really enjoyed them. I baked them for about 9 mins.
