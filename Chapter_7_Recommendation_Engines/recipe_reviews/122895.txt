Ok, I really was only expecting to use this recipe as a guideline, not expecting it to turn out sooooo good!!  My hubby, a connessieur of mashed potatoes, was in heaven eating these and said they were the absolute best he's ever had.  I have never made homemade mashed potatoes so I was quite surprised for such a high compliment.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the butter and milk and salt to make them creamier and tastier (yes, and unhealthier.) I also took the "Betty Crocker" tip and returned the potatoes to the hot pan after draining to evaporate leftover water.  Worked great!!!  I also think warming the butter and milk really helps when you go to blend the potatoes.  This will absolutely be my standard recipe for mashed potatoes!  Thanks for posting!

Thank-you, thank-you!!!
I have been making mashed potatoes like this for years (I too like the simple old-fashioned way) but had forgotten the amounts of butter and milk in proportion to serving size...it had become hit or miss; though good, they were never quite right.
These were perfect!!!!
Just a note to those who want to "prep" ahead of time....peel and cube the potatoes a day (or two) ahead of time, put them in your pot covered with water and add some lemon juice - about 1 TBSP per 5 lbs of potatoes. Cover and refrigerate until you're ready to cook them - no need to drain them. The lemon juice will keep the potatoes white and fresh and won't alter the taste.
A tip I learned from my MIL, God bless her!

PERFECTION! Smooth and Creamy mashed potatoes! I use 1 or 2% milk, I add a little bit more milk than it calls for. Less butter, I'm watching calories these days. Also I add in a bit of dry parsley to give it some color. The key really  is cutting up the potatoes before boiling them, I mash them when they are super hot and add the hot milk in whip it together. Then add a bit of butter and the s&p + parsley. My dad yesterday was asking me how much butter I put in them, he was really surprised that I barely put any in since they were so creamy and fluffy! I love mashed potatoes.

I have made mashed potatoes w/ all these ingredients before but it seemed warming up the milk made a huge difference.  I also popped a whole clove of garlic in the pot w/ the boiling potatoes and mashed it up w/  the rest of everything else and it was wonderful.

This is by far the best mashed potatoes!! I did change  few things. I added 1/2 cup melted BUTTER and 1/2 cup warm milk. I aso boiled a clove of garlic along with the potatoes and then mashed it in with the potaotes, what a great taste!! This is our family keeper!

These are great but taste even better if you use heavy cream for the milk! I also leave out the salt if using salted butter for those of us on low salt diets. Everyone wants to lick the bowl! The secret is the warming of the milk!

Very good, I put the potatoes in cold water and let them come up to a boil and then cook ~15 mins (instead of putting them into boiling water) - I think they get less soggy this way.  Used a ricer and just mixed in the warm butter/milk and s/p - excellent.

Add butter first, then mash lightly, then add hot milk.  Do not mash vigorously or potatoes will toughen and not be fluffy.

Lovely and classic. We always use Betty Crocker's tip of returning the pot to the hot burner after you drain the potatoes - gets rid of any leftover moisture before adding the milk.

These were good, but I had to make some changes for them to be the buttery-creamy-yummy goodness that I grew up on.
1. Instead of milk I used 1/2 cup warmed heavy whipping cream.
2. I used a whole stick of melted butter instead of a half.
3. I needed a LOT more salt than what was called for. Probably over 1 1/2 tablespoons. I also added a lot of pepper.
But, I'm from the south and I like BOLD flavor. This are a great basic recipe, though!

Great recipe by itself or try substituting garlic butter.... taste is similar to a certain seafood joint's garlic mashed potatoes. Food for thought! Thanks again for this fabulous recipe!

Just HEAVENLY!! So creamy, tasty and left my tastebuds wanting more...!!!
Made qty exactly as stated aside from melting the butter with the milk & adding some fresh chopped parsley to mix. Used this with beef strogannoff and was an absolute hit with the guests! The secret is definately in the warm milk and in my case also melting the butter.
Will definately make again and again!5 Stars!!!!!

YUM!!! I have never made mashed potatoes before and this was really helpful so I could know exactly how much butter and milk to use. Also, very helpful that is specifically calls for warm milk. I would have just added cold milk..and now I know it makes a big difference when you have warm milk / butter. This is my staple mashed potato recipe!!!

This is a truly traditional recipe.  Have been making it for years.  For those who like creamer mashed potatoes, try Yukon Gold; they don't have to be boiled as long as Russet.  Yukons taste great even without the butter.  If you like garlic potatoes, add mashed garlic cloves to the water, then remove before you mash the potatoes.  Also, 1/2 & 1/2 milk works great, or you can mix the 1/2 & 1/2 with low fat milk to cut down on calories.  As someone else suggested, putting the drained potatoes back into the hot pan removes excess water.

This was surprisingly good! I thought it would be bland but oh, it was delicious. It was smooth, soft, and it smelled good. I heat the milk with the butter (it's easier to mix it in with the potatoes afterwards). I've made this a few times, but now double the milk & butter. It makes them creamy.

My mother makes the best mashed potatoes I have ever had... but she doesn't use a recipe. So from the time I moved away from home 10 years ago I have been trying to duplicate them in vain. Until I found this recipe. I never thought it could be so easy! The only changes I made (based on a phone call to Mom) were using 3 red and 3 white potatoes instead of all russet to give them better texture and a dash of baking powder to make them fluffier- her magic ingredient. They were outstanding! Thanks for sharing this great basic recipe. I will be making them again and again.

For the smoothest mashed potatoes, only add the seasonings and the butter and use mixer until lumps are removed, THEN add the milk and continue with mixer until mixed well.

Absolutely delicious! I used as much milk as I wanted for an even, creamy texture, and I added some powdered and roasted garlic to it for more flavor. The general consensus confirmed that it worked out wonderfully.

This is basically the recipe I make, but since I changed one thing, I gave it four stars instead of 5. This is a very good recipe, but I put chicken bouillon granules in my potato water while the potatoes are cooking. The granules just give the right flavor to the potatoes to make them perfect. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This is a delicious,traditional way of making mashed potatoes. Please note you could add more butter, milk, salt and pepper to taste. This is fool proof if you taste as you go, and you will end up with wonderful, classic mashed potatoes. I add a bit more butter and always use whole milk. You can't go wrong with this recipe, and this is a nice change from the rich mashed potatoes I always make. :)

This recipe had great flavor. I did add a little chopped parsely. Unfortunately, I whipped the potatoes too much so they were too creamy for our tastes. Next time I'm sure they'll be a 5*

These were great. I used garlic salt instead of salt and I didnt mash mine I used my hand mixer and beat them until fluffy. Definately a great simple classic recipe.

This is the exact recipe I've always used for mashed potatoes.  When boiling your potatoes make sure they get a little 'mushy'.  It will be easier to mash them if you do.  I also use an electric mixer instead of mashing them.  Add the warm milk gradually if you do this and you will not have any lumps.  They will be light and creamy.  People will think you've spent a lot of time and effort when you really haven't.  If you follow this recipe you will NEVER want instant mashed potatoes again.

This was really good.  So easy my 14 year old made it.  Followed the recipe exact.  They turned out absolutely perfect!  If I could give more then 5 stars I would.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe and helping teach my son the basics.

These were bland to our taste as written.  We added two ounces of softened cream cheese, and that made them more pleasing to our palate.

Absolutely fantastic!  With a recipe so simple, I will never use the boxed stuff again.  Boiled potatoes w/a clove of garlic & also mashed it in.  Used some heavy cream mixed w/1% milk.  Just perfect!

These were good, but I listened to the directions and boiled potatoes until "very tender" and thought they were water-logged.  I'd follow the ingredients again but use better judgment when to drain- probably just at tender so they aren't so wet.

This recipe is great! I followed other reviewer's recommendations and doubled the milk and butter. I also made sure the milk was warm before adding the potatoes. They turned out great, in fact I made this recipe two days in a row! Will make again.

I substituted half and half for the regular milk for a very special dinner and added just a dollop of sour cream.  What awesome reviews I got.  These are just wonderful.

These potatoes were great! I use the same ingredients when making potatoes, but this helped get them to the right consistency. I found when I did the exact measurements, the potatoes still had a gummy consistency. When I doubled the milk and butter, the potatoes finally came out creamy & fluffy like everyone else raved about. 4 stars b/c I still had to make adjustments. 5 stars when I doubled the milk & butter in the recipe. So fantastic, thank you!

Made this to accompany grilled salmon. Adjusted quantities since it was just me but did add a generous amount of warm milk, butter and salt. Very tasty and the texture is fluffy and creamy! Will use this recipe again when making mashed potatoes!

I cook my salted potatoes, which I have cut into equal size chunks, until a fork can piece them easily. I drain them and put them back into the cooking pan, off the stove. Any water that drains evaporates off. I heat about 1 cup of milk in the microwave. Put the drained potatoes in a mixer bowl. Turn on the mixer, slow at first, while the potatoes are mixing slowly, add butter or margarine. Turn up the mixer to whip the potatoes and add the milk slowly, scraping the sides of the bowl. Keep adding milk slowly until they are whipped and hold their shape. Taste, adding more salt and pepper to taste.

I doubled the "liquid" (butter & milk) and still felt that these potatoes could use a little something more... I just couldn't put my finger on what. In a rush I served them anyway for Thanksgiving. Everyone thought they were amazing. I made twice as much as I THOUGHT I needed and they were gone before left over time. I'd say it's a good traditional recipe. Not fancy or over the top... just a good hearty recipe.

My mashed potatoes used to never come out right, until I learned that U MUST use warm butter and warm milk. Thats all. And lots of salt and pepper. And next time I wanna add chives or something for more flavor.

Great simple recipe! I use heavy cream in place of milk, or use buttermilk if no heavy cream! It gives the potatoes a whole new texture and adds some dimension to the taste!

Fantastic mashed potatoes.  I boiled a garlic clove with the potatoes and added a bit of extra milk and butter.  I added half a package of ranch powder at the very end just because that's what my mom did growing up.  They were perfect.

Nice basic mashed potatoes.  I also doubled the milk and butter as another reviewer mentioned.  I used white pepper instead of regular.  These reheat well in the microwave too.

This is an awesome mashed potato recipe! My russet potatoes were really small so I upped it to 9 of them and then I worried about the mix. I used evaporated milk like several suggested--this is SOOOO CREAMY. I made them a second time and added some garlic and parsley and cheddar--delicious!

This was really good and simple. I didn't have russet potatoes (I'm not sure what kind they were though) and used 10 large instead of 6. Used the same amounts of the rest of the ingredients and the mash came out creamy and tasty.

This was my first time ever making mashed potatoes from scratch & I have no regrets!!  This was simple & delicious.  After reading a few reviews, I did double the milk & butter.  Added parsley, garlic & pepper to taste.  This recipe is a keeper & no more boxed taters!!!  Thanks...

Perfect. In the south, mashed potatoes are a staple several times a week and they had better be done right, it's just expected. This yielded the results everybody loves.

Amazing! I just began cooking so these were my first attempt at mashed potatoes and my family was blown away. When I finally broke down and told the secret was the warm milk and butter my husband said "hmm, that makes sense, I should have thought of that". I used my left overs for potatoe pancakes with cheese in the middle. TOO DIE FOR!

love this recipe. however i recommend to boil the potatoes 40 minutes instead of 25 so they are very mushy to mash.

Without a doubt this is the best when it comes to a simple, good old fashioned mashed potato recipe.  I've used it a couple times before & decided to give it the stellar rating it deserves.  The proportions are spot on & my mashed potatoes come out perfect every time!  No more guessing & adding while mashing like I used to do.  This is such a quick & delicious go-to when I need a side dish in a pinch.  Thank you SO much for sharing this all-time classic!  :)

This is perfect.  I have cooked since I was a little girl but was never able to make mashed potatoes as good as mom's, until NOW!  Perfect flavor and consistency.  Whipped in my kitchenaid stand mixer til smooth.  The key is to use hot milk to keep it warm while mixing. Never thought I would use a recipe for mashed potatoes, but this is it!

Quite possibly the best mashed potatoes I've ever had.  Extremely creamy, with a thick enough substance to be filling.  I added a little extra pepper and a dash of onion powder, and the only thing I can really say is "wow".  Great side dish that goes with almost anything, and the best recipe for traditional, no-nonsense potatoes I've had.

Yummy!! These potatoes are good! The salt and butter amounts are perfect. I did add more pepper though, about 1/4 teaspoon and some chives from my kitchen garden.

I love mashed potatoes and this is a great base..I doubled(love to have left-overs to make potatoe pancakes the next day) and added a spec more butter than called for..lets face it mashed potatoes are fattening already why not up it alittle.  I have made these a few times and have also added in some sourcream for an extra creaminess and that was delicious too! Oh..instead of hand mashing I just use the mixer and whip them up good.
Thanks for the share.

Use the tip to return the potatoes to the hot pan after draining to evaporate leftover water. Works great!!! Warm the butter and milk to help blend the potatoes.  Cream, 1/2 and 1/2 or evaporated milk work wonderfully.  Warm the serving dish too - and dollop more butter and pepper on top.

WOW.  I was just going to use this as a guide for the amount of milk and butter but this whole recipe was great.  The only change I made was to use Yukon gold potatoes.  I will never make mashed potatoes with any other kind.  Thanks!

Out of this world!! I used part half and half and part milk (instead of all milk). They turned out so creamy and delicious that everyone at the table had seconds! My husband says he has never tasted better mashed potatoes - he insists I double the recipe so there will be lots of leftovers for him!

This recipe is exactly what it says.  I also used evap milk as we drink 1% or 2%, not creamy enough.  Be sure to return potatoes to hot pot to cook off excess water.  This recipe is a great reference for amounts and you can always customize to your menu and your family's tastes.

Delicious. Simple and traditional just like the name says. I cooked my potatoes with 1 tbsp of minced garlic added to the boiling water just to add a very slight flavor. For my siser-in-law with the dairy allerigies, I used the water the potatoes had been boiled in instead of the milk, and soy margerine instead of the butter. You couldn't tell the difference between the two types. Very yummy!

This is an EXCELLENT, easy recipe for mashed potatoes.  I changed a few things though.  I added about 2-3 times the amount of milk and added 1/4 cup creamcheese (warmed up) and that made it SO creamy.  Also if you add a teaspoon of baking soda it makes them creamier.

I use this recipe often when cooking for my nieces and nephews who like a simpler taste. The only thing I like to do different is added minced garlic to the water as I'm boiling the potatoes. LOVE this never-fail recipe.

So easy and simple ingredients. I added garlic powder to the mix. And used red potatoes instead. I kept the skin on which adds texture and taste.

Nice, easy recipe!  I used this as a guideline and made a few substitutions.  I did not have any milk, so I substituted a vegan version of cream cheese.  For margarine, I used Smart Balance Organic.  I confess that I didn't really measure the ingredients -- I just added a large dollop each of Smart Balance and cream cheese, enough to make it creamy and fluffy.  Turned out yummy!!

Loved this!  This was exactly what I was looking for.  Simple with a nice, light garlic flavor.

I modified it to make it creamier, tastier, AND still healthy.  I added the following:
- 1 cup warm nonfat milk
- 1/4 cup light version of I can't believe it's not butter
- 1/4 cup nonfat sour cream
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon pepper

LOVE IT!!!

this is exactly how i make my mashed potatoes. simple and delicious. once youve made mashed potatoes a few times, you dont need to follow the recipe. cube up potatoes, boil, mash, add butter/milk/s&p to taste. use heavy cream and more butter to make them more decadent, use skim milk and the fake butter stuff to save on calories!

I just fixed this tonight and it needed A LOT more milk to make it creamy.
I boiled the potatoes for about 25mins but think less would've been better b/c they ended up a little dry.
The taste was great though.

Not quiet KFC, but pretty darn close! I followed another reviewers recommendation of double the butter, milk, salt and pepper - definitely helped! My son is allergic to milk so I used Nucoa and soy milk and his was just as good :)

My mom has always been the master of mashed potatoes in my family but she lives 1100 miles away so I finally decided it was time for me to learn! This recipe seemed easy enough - too easy to be honest - but I took a gamble. They turned out AMAZING! I used red potatoes and left some of of the skins on for flavor. I also warmed up both  the milk and the butter before working them into the potatoes which seemed to make a huge difference in the consistency.

My only complaint? That I didn't make more! I had to resist the urge to eat them since they are for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner.

So easy and absolutely delicious. I made this with red potatoes instead of russet because I like it with the skins. I used about 8-9 red instead of 6 russet, depending on the size. And then I added half the amount of milk and replaced the other half with whipping cream. But I've made them with just milk before and they turned out great too. This is a new family favorite!

Great recipe. I just added 1/4cup more milk, dill weed to taste, garlic powder to taste, few more shakes of salt to taste, & more black pepper (8 servings intead of the listed 6). Great recipe to tweek with a little. I think some"Slap Ya'Mamma"cajun seasoning would ROCK this recipe (maybe next time I make these)Oh yeah.

This recipe is so easy and a perfect base, I use heavy cream in place of the milk (during the holidays) add a spoon full of  sour cream for that extra zing. 
I put my potatoes through a potato ricer then fold in the room temp cream and butter, it make the perfect textured potatoes. 
I also save some of that starchy water used to boil the potato's for making gravy.

Yummy!  This works best with seasoning.
I added abt 3/4 milk and used three potatoes. After cutting up the potatoes and putting them in the pot i boiled half a clove of garlic with them.  I also added the same amount of butter/margarine as the recipe calls for, vegetable seasoning, sweet chili seasoning, grated provolone cheese (1/2 cup) and mash it all together.

I boiled them in chicken broth instead of water which gave them more flavor. Used a little extra salt and pepper, and these are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had!!

Simple and delicious - followed as is.  After draining potatoes (and before mashing) I put them back in the hot pan to singe of any extra water. Don't know why anyone would ever make instant!

Yum to the max!! I made a roast and wanted mashed potatoes that were easy and didn't take very long. This is it! Perfect. The only thing I changed was to lower the amount of salt added. Thanks so much for sharing this!!

This was delicious. I was very surprised with the outcome considering it was my first time making it. The only change was that I added a teaspoon of dried parsley to add a little color. I will definitely make this again.

These mashed potatoes are so simple and soooooo Yummy! My family loved them and so did I.  The only thing I did different is add a couple of minced cloves of garlic to the potatoes.  I did also make simple gravy but they would have been fine without it.  I will make them again and again.  Defiantly worth a try.

These mashed potatoes were the best I have ever had... anywhere. I am a serious mashed potato snob and I have never loved them as much as when I made them the other night. Even my husband said that they were "perfect". Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I knew the basic ingredients for mashed potatoes but never could quite get the proportions right. These were perfect! I warmed the milk and butter together before adding to the potatoes. I've never done that part before and I think it made a huge difference. Great recipe yet ever so simple =)

Fantastic! Thank you so much for a delicious, standard mashed potato recipe.   (By the way, I didn't have whole milk so I used one part skim milk and one part half-and-half and it turned out great!)

I know it's nothing fancy or different, but there were VERY good. I kept the skin on (personal taste). This is a great base recipe that you could alter to your liking, but it is super as is!

Wonderful basic mashed potatoes.  If I have heavy cream I use that instead of milk.  Be sure not to use an electric mixer or a masher, so as not to end up with gluey potatoes.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe. The only thing I do differently is use a full stick of butter and heavy cream. Great place to start though.

Great recipe but had to play with it to make the hubby like it.  Added Garlic Powder, Dried Chopped Onion, Oregano, Basil, and Parsley to taste.  He requests this one anytime I make Lemon-Pepper or Fried Chicken.

More than worthy of a 5-star rating, these potatoes were easy to make and very much appreciated! Thanks to the reviewer who suggested to add milk when boiling - they came out much creamier the second time I made them.

I've used this basic recipe for years, but I've never warmed the milk and butter before.  It really does seem to make a difference, though.  I don't know how or why, but it works better.

Great recipe! Less is more with this basic favorite. My little tweak is that I leave about 50% of the skins on. Warming the milk and butter before mashing is key, I think. Putting the drained potatoes back in the hot pan for evaporating the remaining water is a great idea too! Thanks for the hint! :)

wow, simple is really the best.  used 1/2C butter, and the same am't of milk, next time will use more milk and less butter for a healthier meal.  added 4 cloves of garlic and some garlic powder, plus doubled the salt.  will definitely make again....absolutely loved it.

It doesn't get much better than this. I'll never understand why people used instant potatoes when these are so easy and taste infinitely better.  I used red potatoes, leaving the skin on and used my Kitchen Aid to whip them up. No need to double the milk and butter IMO.  They're perfect.

Great recipe! Very easy to make and still heats up really well the next day. I would add more butter next time and instead of white pepper, use black pepper instead.

These mashed potatoes were the best I've made yet! I think the warm milk  really helps fluff them up nicely. I also added in extra butter. I'll definitely be making these again. Thanks alot for nice recipe.

I really like these mashed potatos. I was looking for a basic recipe just so I could put the right amount of butter  and milk. It turned out perfect, and I got no complaints from my boyfriend. This was exactly the recipe I was looking for.

A good, basic mashed potato recipe.  Yields excellent texture and is a good base recipe to add your favorite flavors (i.e. garlic, more pepper, sour cream).

Wonderful recipe! So easy too, and way better than instant potatoes. I use kosher salt. These are great even all by themselves, without gravy or any toppngs to "doctor" them up. They are even creamier and richer if using condensed milk or half and half. Sometimes I add chicken broth.

This is a traditional simple mashed potato. For variety you can add creamy horseradish, roasted garlic pieces or carmelized onion pieces. Of course, the potatoes will no longer be creamy white.

Always good!  I like the buttery taste of Yukon Gold for my mashed potatoes, so that is what I frequently use.

This is what I usually put in my mashed potatoes, but I don't follow a recipe.  I'm glad I followed a recipe this time...The mashed potatoes came out great!  I used cold milk (instead of warm) and added an extra 2 tablespoons of butter.  Excellent!

I've made these several times.  I put the butter in the milk and warm up in the microwave, so the butter is mostly melted.

Great and simple recipe !  I didn't even need the entire 1/2 cup of warm milk added (only 2 tbsp) because after boiling the potatoes it turned really fluffy. I never realize what a difference it makes to using Russet potatoes. Next time Im going to skip the butter because I couldn't even taste it. It only needed salt and pepper

Very easy and good.  Wish i added garlic for more flavor!  Def warm milk.  Seemed to make a great consistency.  Perfect for making leftover mashed potato soup!

These turned out perfect! I think that warming up the milk and adding the butter at room temperature makes a big difference.

Very good.  I used a ricer to mash the potatoes so they came out super light and fluffy.  A little garlic powder adds a nice touch also.

These mashed potatoes were excellent.  I doubled milk and butter because it was Thanksgiving, but next time...I will stick to healthier percentages.  I whipped these rather than mashing and they were a sensation!

These were so awesome that I couldn't get them out of my mind the next day and had to stop to get more potatoes to make them again.  Fillet mignon, these potatoes and a greek salad was a killer meal.

I actually wish I followed this recipe verbatim but I didn't and I followed what some other people said and my mashed potatoes came out a little more runny than they should have. So I say follow the recipe exactly and you'll have thick creamy mashed potatoes. Also add a little bit more butter and salt as my southern husband said it could use something and once I added some more salt and butter, he loved them!

Instead of doubling the butter, milk, and salt; try using 1/4 cup of sour cream. This is how my grandmother always made them and they are absolutely delicious. It just adds a little tang. Cut the tangyness with fresh cracked black pepper just before serving

DELICIOUS!  I must add, however...my mom taught me to make mashed potatoes with these ingredients and also adding a little mayo and cream cheese.  We had mashed potatoes this way growing up and now I make them this way for my family.

Pretty close to how I make them, but I add a little sour cream.  Makes the potatoes really smooth.

I don't make mashed potatoes very often and can never remember the ratios when I do. Decided to try this based on the great reviews and I wasn't disappointed. A really quick and fantastic recipe. Next time I think I'll add in just a bit of garlic but it's a winner as is.

Great texture, easy to make.  The only thing I would say is that it may need just a little bit more salt.  My husband and son really loved these though, and my husband is a hopelessly picky eater.

These were very good. I used an extra 1/4 c of milk and doubled the butter. Also sprinkled parsley on top. I think some chicken broth would be great too!

So yummy! I used twice the butter, but only used 1/2 cup of milk like it says. I also added more salt, but that's just the way I like it. I love homemade mashed potatoes, and this is the best recipe I've ever tasted!

these came out a little bland for my taste, but that is probably because i dont cook with added salt or pepper if i dont have to. i didnt peel the potatoes(never do), drained them then added them back to the hot pot. added the other ingredients, mashed and served them in the same pot.

These are delicious! I added a little extra milk, but I didn't need to add anything else like salt  or pepper after they were done. They were perfect. I would like to try a gravy with it next time.

PERFECT. I use Half and Half instead of regular milk. VERY Creamy. If you like garlic mashed potatoes, add several garlic cloves to the potatoes when you boil them. The flavor will cook into the potatoes AND they get blended with the potatoes when you ash them!

I am not usually a mashed potato person, or really any kind of white potatoes, but this recipe is very simple and good. The potatoes come out with a buttery and creamy texture with absolutely no hint of being dry. I can stand to eat these which is a big deal for me!

this recipe was so AWESOME that i actually signed up to make this review. i made a few tweaks to the recipe and it ended up being the BEST mashed potatoes i've ever had in my life (and i LOVE mashed potatoes). so much flavor!  i only had red potatoes so i used 8 medium red potatoes instead of the 6 medium russet potatoes.  the key is to skin and cut the potatoes into really small cubes (helps with mashing later on - i think it's fine if there are small chunks.. makes it more exciting).  i boiled the potatoes with 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. salt and boiled it on high heat for 25 minutes. return the potatoes back into the pot and add 1/2 cup warm milk and 1/2 cup (1 stick) Blue Bonnet (i guess it's margarine?). i only added 1/2 tsp. of salt.  the result was creamy and super flavorful mashed potatoes with a hint of garlic. you can eat this without gravy! enjoy :).

These turned out very creamy...I used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of russet. They are not my grandma's famous mashed potatoes, but we all still enjoyed them.

This was my 1st attempt at homemade mashed potatoes and this recipe was PERFECT. I used nonfat milk, I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, and added 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic. I did not double the milk or 'butter' and they came out super creamy and fluffy. I hardly had to mash them at all. DELICIOUS!

I didn't know why there was a recipe for mashed potatoes when all they are is potatoes, butter, and milk? So, of course I had to see why and followed the directions on a holiday. These were pretty good. I keep the recipe for the holidays, because it is more butter than I like to use during a regular week. But, I like the concept of heating the milk and butter, I think that is the added touch. And, they make great potatoes as leftovers for casseroles I am thinking because of the little bit of extra butter.

LOVED this recipe thanks so much. I was looking for an old fashioned simple recipe as I lost mine and needed the measurements on the butter & milk. Came out wonderfully.  Also the tips about warm milk were great :)

Super easy. Used less butter and more warm milk.  Also used more potatoes.  I think the key is to make sure the potatoes are really done and the milk is warm.  Turned out fantastic.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.

This is a solid mashed potatoes recipe, and that means a lot coming from someone who has had many failed mashed potatoes attempt. I will definitely keep it in my recipe box for later use. Two notes on what I encountered when I made them: 1.) You might need more salt and pepper, especially if you are using unsalted butter. 2.) I only had almond milk because my family doesn't drink a lot of dairy milk. The recipe still turned out some creamy and delicious mashed potatoes. (Just make sure you aren't using a flavored almond milk!)

These are great but next time I will be doubling the milk and butter as others suggested because I did find them a bit dry when I followed the recipe word for word. Other than that these went great with the chicken fried steak recipe I found on this site. Thanks for sharing!

your standard mashed potatoes. Nothing too special, but they're still very tasty.  Needs plenty of gravy.

Nice easy recipe.  Used Lactaid Milk and "Cant believe its not butter" due to food alergies.  Left some skin on the potatoes and topped with chives.  Family loved them.  Hubby added a topping of sour cream to his.  Will make these many more times.

I just got finished making these. I took the first sample and I gotta say THESE ARE THE BEST MASHED POTATOES I'VE EVER MADE! I cant wait till my family tries this. The last few times I made mashed potatoes it didn't go so well, but I think this one will be a hit.  I added a little sliver of butter with the milk I heated up for extra richness

This is exactly how my mother has always made these. Instead of cubing the potatoes, she halves and then quarters them instead. It works well. :)

I liked this recipe, but it's a bit different from the one I often make with sour cream or cream cheese.  I added five cloves crushed raw garlic, a little pepper, and about a teaspoon of finely chopped fresh rosemary.  That much garlic might be too strong for some, but we enjoyed it :)

Unbelievably simple, yet soooo good.  I reviewed others comments and took some of their advice.  I too doubled the amount of milk and butter to make a nice creamy version, and left the amount of seasoning as is.  It turned out perfect and doesn't call for alot of different ingredients.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe!

I'm going to toot my own horn here and say that I'm a pretty good cook, but mashed potatoes were always my Achilles Heel. When I read this recipe I though "Pfft! That's how I make my mashed potatoes more or less! How could these be any different?". I don't know how warming the milk makes all the difference, but it really does. My potatoes were so smooth and creamy. I always use seasoning salt on potatoes because it tastes so much better than regular salt. And sometimes I even leave the skin on the potatoes because I like the dimention it adds to the flavour, but never when I'm serving my MIL. I think she'd swoon if she saw skins in her mashed potatoes ;)

This is the best Mashed Potato recipe around, no doubt. I tend to add a bit more pepper than most people probably do, but that's what my family likes. It's the only recipe I've used since I found it.

Great, simple mashed potatoes recipe.  Just what it says - traditional mashed potatoes.  I added a little garlic powder and a bit more black pepper.  I thought about some parmesan cheese, but left it out.  it was great.

I usually add a bunch of stuff like cheese, bacon, green onions and garlic to my potatoes, but this time I just wanted plain, and I was worried they would be bland. Boy, these were tasty!! I followed the directions exactly, and they were very good. Warming the milk was a nice touch!

I just made this recipe tonight and I am so happy I did, the potatoes came out wonderful!!!! I added less butter (mainly because I didn't realize I didn't have much) and compensated with the milk and my husband (who is a butterholic) did not notice. This is definitely in my bot of recipes!!!!

This is definately  what the recipe says - your basic traditional mashed potatoes. Very delicious. I used only 3 potatoes but the written amount of milk, salt, and butter. I think you really need to double the amount of butter and milk to get them nice and creamy. I served these with sour cream, bacon bits, and cheese, and they made for some wonderful loaded mashed potatoes!

Delicious as is!  Maybe a little extra milk/butter - but I don't think you need to double anything like some reviews suggested.

Great base.  Instead of boiling the potatoes in water, I boil them in chicken broth.  It gives them great flavor.  I also mix in grated parmesan cheese.  I'm in charge of mashed potatoes for our family holiday gatherings.

I was so excited to actually have fluffy potatoes for once, instead of the gluey ones I normally make. I don't know what did the trick with these, but they were wonderful!  I'll be making potatoes this way from now on. The proportions of potatoes, milk, salt, and butter are perfect! Thanks for posting this recipe.

I will NEVER make another basic mashed potato recipe again, this is IT!  I've made these several ways.  The first time, I tried them as written.  Delicious and super-fluffy!  So yum!  My husband actually told me that he has NEVER had a mashed potato that he has not had to put salt or butter on.  He did neither for these!  The second time, I doubled the recipe and added twice as much milk and butter, which was suggested by other reviewers.  As written for 6 potatoes, adding 1 cup of milk and 1/2 lb of butter is to die for!  I won't make them this way all the time due to all the extra calories, but YUM!  I like to boil the potatoes with salt added to the water.  That way, the flavor is already in the potatoes and you don't really have to add too much to the finished product.  These are so fantastic and I love them!  I've made them three times in the last week, and I'm not one to make homemade mashed potatoes except for a holiday.

Great basic recipe.  Fluffy, tasty and perfect for gravy with Thanksgiving dinner!  I used 1 tsp. kosher salt in the water while cooking the potatoes and 1 tsp. kosher salt mixed in at the end with the butter and milk.

Finally, finally, finally a simple and easy way to make great home made mashed potatoes - I have been making them for years, but wrong - and have hated how they always came out gluey. The heated milk seems to be the trick, and I got a hand masher which also seems to help give them the right consistency. I did a couple things a little differently - added chicken bouillon to my water that I boiled the potatoes in for more flavor and I used half and half instead of regular milk since I had some I wanted to use up. These are perfect potatoes, and I could have eaten half the bowl myself. :)

I was really impressed with this recipe! I did follow recommendations of returning the drained potatoes back into the pot, I added more hot milk(I think a whole cup) and a little more butter. I boiled the potatoes with a few cloves of garlic and mashed it all up together. I also used garlic salt and onion powder to season it. Mashed up really well.

Very good. I used red bliss potatoes and a 1/4 cup evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I also added onion/garlic powder.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great. It stands alone, or would be easily modified to fit your preferences (cheese, garlic, whatever).

This was okay, not great, but okay. I had to doctor it up with more salt and add pepper. I guess you can say the southern in me came out, for I have to have pepper. But it's a good base recipe.

These are FANTASTIC.  Follow the recipe exactly and you will have such a treat!   It's Easter and I'm about a million miles from home and these just hit the spot.  They're so much like what my grandma used to make for us!    Mashed potatoes seem like they should be easy, but somehow mine have never come out quite right...until now!  Thanks for posting this!

Excellent, didn't change a thing.  Since I've been married mashed potatoes have been my nemesis, I could cook elaborate meals but the mashed potatoes always were a flop, not anymore, these are perfect!!!  I use this exact recipe for everything now that requires any kind of mashed potatoes, I use it for the pan pierogies from this site and my Sheperd's pie, makes those dishes great.

Five stars from my family. A great basic recipe for mashed potatoes. Be sure to add that salt. It makes a difference. I only had a spoonful left.

it did not really turn out the mushy way i wanted, more like a little bit rice soup, but not really, and i think is too much butter.

This is a good baseline recipe, but it's pretty boring.  I usually add some sour cream and parsley or chives.

I love my Mom's mashed potatoes so I've always been reluctant to make them since I didn't think I would measure up.  This recipe came the closest to what my Mom does when she makes it (the woman never writes anything down or measures) and turned out just like hers.  One slight difference - she boils the milk first, so I did too. UPDATED: I HATE reheated mashed potatoes so I turned the leftovers into the Mashed Potato Soup recipe on Allrecipes

Excellent. Before this recipe I always just threw in some milk and butter and hoped for the best - but now I will always use this recipe.  I used a Potato Ricer the "mash" the potatoes.  If you haven't tried a potato ricer yet I highly recommend it - they will be the fluffiest mashed potatoes you ever had!

i halved the recipe and it was enough to feed 3 people.  this was so yummy, it didn't even need any gravy.  this was a simple recipe and i will be making it again.  i think next time, i'll add some garlic to it.  =)

I have always made mashed potatoes without a recipe, and the result varied from "ok" to "very good" - a hit or miss kind of thing. But now that I used this recipe, my mashed potatoes came out EXCELLENT! I am glad I have every ingredient measured now. I will use this from now on. Thanks!

Sorry, the warm milk didn't do it for me.  I like my potatoes a bit fluffy and somehow the warm milk made them gooey.  I couldn't seem to remedy it afterwards.  Everyone else said they were good, but it wasn't the taste that bothered me, just the texture.

I made these mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving and they turned out great.  I took one reviewers advice and added a clove of garlic to the pot when I boiled the mashed potatoes and mashed it up with the rest of the potatoes.

The mashed potatoes turn out much better if you use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and increase the butter to a stick(1/2 cup).  My great grandmother made hers like this for YEARS..YUMMY!

I have always used basically the same process to make mashed potatoes, but warming the milk does indeed make a difference! This is now how I make mashed potatoes! DH loved them! The only change I made was more salt and butter.

Pretty basic mashed potatoes.  "Traditional" as described, so I rated it high.  But don't look for anything surprisingly good if you have had homeade mashed potatoes before.

Perfect consistency and seasoning when followed exactly. Just like my grandmother makes, but I've never been able to...until now! I make a triple batch and stick them in the freezer for later meals. They are great reheated for a super-fast side dish.

I find that using a ricer rather than a traditional potato masher is easier and makes the potatoes come out creamier. A rice cooker with a keep warm mode is very useful in keeping it warm until ready to serve

It's nice to have the actual amounts of butter and milk...usually I guesstimate and sometimes they turn out and sometimes they don't.  So I tried this and I think it's the perfect ratio.  I was tempted to add more milk but I left it a little firmer (I am used to using lots of milk) and it was fine.  Sometimes I add onion powder or onion salt for an extra kick.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really easy to make. I've only attempted to make mashed potatoes once and it turned in to a glue like paste. It was a mess. Needless to say I was very wary of trying again. This recipe was great. I received praise from my BF who is hard to please

I was looking for a quick recipe for mashed potatoes that didn't use cream (just because I didn't have any on hand) and this fit the bill. I added a little garlic salt w/ parsley to kick up the flavor because I didn't have any gravy on hand (yes, it was time to go grocery shopping). Made it in a cinch and it was delicious. I will turn to this recipe again and again when my pantry becomes bare!

Yum freakin' yum!  This recipe is so simple and quite frankly the most delicious mashed potatoes I have ever had. (sorry, Grandma)  I did substitute red potatoes since that is what I had on hand but I think they'd be great no matter what sort of potato was used.

This was a very easy recipe to make.  I used red potatoes and kept the skin.  The flavors were good but not as rich as I expected.  Next time, I'll go with a little more butter and full fat milk to capture more flavor - and not think about the calories!

I've made these mashed potatoes several times now, and they all turned out great.  Since I only have 3 to feed, and we like them a little creamier, I used 4 russet potatoes with 1/4 cup warm milk, 1/4 cup margerine, 1/4 sour cream, and garlic salt to taste, blended with an electric beater... yummy!

Excellent easy recipe!!  I also added garlic butter for a little more flavour, but other than that the recipe was simple and perfect!

This is pretty embarrasing but I could never succesfully make homemade mashed potatoes until I followed this recipe.  They turned out great and my husband loved them.  Very easy and delish.  Thanks!

Really, really good. The only thing I did different was add two tablespoons of whipping cream and I used a cake mixer to whip the potatoes once I they had boiled. This gave the potatoes a creamier texture (but not runny) and a better appearance.

Delicious mashed potatoes I must say!  Only reason why I didn't give it five stars is that it lacked a buttery taste.  I had to add more butter than recommended and I'll probably clog my arteries! I also used garlic salt to give it a mild garlic taste which made it even better!

I love mashed potatoes! Mmmm... This is pretty much what do, although I have never actually measured it. I just make it "to taste." Sour Cream can also be a substitute for the milk. It just depends on my mood if I put milk or sour cream. Lol. :)

It's a good basic way to make mashed potatoes.  I like to throw a couple cloves of garlic into the pot with the boiling water.  Then I mash the garlic with the potatoes.

You can't go wrong with this one if you want a quick and easy recipe for basic 
mashed potatoes! I used skimmed milk and Smart Balance instead of butter, plus added white pepper, salt and garlic powder.  Delish!

The texture was good- I had never made mashed potatoes with a recipe so I thought I would give it a try. The texture was great but they were really bland following the recipe as written- we like buttery potatoes and these had no taste so we add a bunch more butter and they were fine- good to use as a base I guess but I think I'll stick to my no recipe mashed.

I doubled the recipe for Christmas dinner and used 1/2 cup half and half and 1/2 cup 2% milk. I also boiled potatoes with Chicken Boulian cubes. I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt and pepper, and 1/2 tsp salt. 3/4 cups butter. Everyone loved it they came out nice creamy and fluffy! Will be making it alot more

EXCELLENT!! I took the advice of the other readers and boiled the potatoes with water and whole milk and added a teaspoon full of sour cream. That really made the difference.I made them before without doing that, and they weren't creamy enough. Other than that it's a great recipe!!!

My husband and mom loved them.  I added more pepper (fresh cracked), and I cooked the potatoes in a can of evaporated milk and water instead of just water.  The real test will be tomorrow to see if my daughter will eat them or not.

I thought I made great mashed potatoes until I tasted these!!!  LOL.  Huge hit at Thanksgiving.  Creamy, dreamy, delicious.  Who would have thought that warming half and half would make such a difference but it did.  Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a great recipe, and perfect as a starting point.  Like some other people I doubled the butter and milk, but it only made my potatoes soupy, so I would recommend just adding as needed.  I tossed some minced garlic in the boiling water, and added garlic salt and parlsey to taste.  Once I cooked and added up some extra potatoes this was great, just watch your measurements.

I tweaked this and the kids loved it!  Added cream cheese, sour cream, 1/3 cup milk, 1/3 cup whipping cream, a stick of butter and I use a mixer to CREAM the potatoes.  They were AMAZING!

Soooo yummy and creamy. I used half and half instead of milk and warmed it before mixing and also upped butter to 1/2 cup like other reviewers suggested.  Would be awesome with garlic in it.

I've never made homemade mashed potatoes and this recipe was not only really simple but delicious.  Will try a couple different flavor variations using this recipe as a base, but definitely never make them from a box again!

They were perfect--I was not really following the directions too closely as I was simultaneously cooking Shepherd's Pie (hence, the necessity for the mashed potatoes) and they still came out dreamy creamy.

Perfect mashed potatoes every time. I've been using this recipe for years now (it is almost identical to the recipe my mom has used her entire life) and will never stop using it. They are a hit with anyone that comes over for dinner!

I really didn't expect these potatoes to turn out this good!  Who thought a few changes like heating up the milk would make such a difference.  I also melt the butter first before adding it.  They taste great and have a great texture.  I was never able to get mashed potatoes right until this recipe.  Thanks!

I really liked this recipe! I prefer a more creamier mashed potato, but my friend thought it was fabulous! I added salt to the potatoes prior to boiling (I found a video of Alton Brown giving tips on mashed potatoes) and I added about a teaspoon of crushed garlic. It was so good, I made it a second time, and I really can't cook! lol

I normally have a weird consistency to my mashed potatoes, but this recipe gave them the perfect balance and creaminess. I whipped mine with a whisk, as I don't have a masher and they came out delicious. Thanks!

Great recipe and easy to follow especially for my first time making mashed potatoes. I added romano, parmasan, and mozzarella cheeses and it was delicious! I will definitely make these again and again and I'll leave the boxed mashed potatoes at the store!

These potatoes are exactly as titled.  Traditional.  No fancy adders, and very, very good.  I used about twice the amount of milk.

Awesome. Like many others I add double milk, butter and salt. I think I may have even exceeded my own mothers recipe. So easy and the results were perfect.

Delicious and creamy mashed potatoes, and couldn't be simpler to make.  I cube my potatoes and they cook up in an instant--make sure to drain well, I return drained potatoes to the heated pan to evaporate any remaining water.  Heating your ingredients really helps, too.  I like to leave the skins on for a more robust look and taste.

You honestly cant screw this up, I use fat free spray butter and fat free half and half, tastes yummy. I have made TONS of different types of mashed taters, with sour cream, cream cheese, etc. and this simpley recipe is so yummy. I also add granulated garlic and some parsley for some color.

Simply briskly stirring these after they boiled for 25 minutes made a fantastic batch of fluffy mashed potatoes.  I never had to use a mixer, nor a traditional masher!  Doubled and heated the butter and milk (used part Heavy Cream and part whole milk) prior to mixing. I found the salt needed doubling also.

Delicious base recipe.  I changed it up a bit.  I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup milk (to make it a little more creamy and not too dry).  I also added about 2 Tbsp. more butter.  It was fabulous and tasty.  Well enjoyed by all of our Thanksgiving guests!

Love this recipe!  I will definitely be using it for my Thanksgiving dinner.  I've never made mashed potatoes before and these turned out wonderfully.  Based on the reviews, I doubled the butter, milk and salt and after draining the potatoes, returned them to the hot pan to evaporate and remove the excess water.  Yummy!!!

Just had these for dinner tonight and loved them!! Followed the recipe, but added 1 tsp of garlic powder as another reviewer had suggested. Actually, my fiance made them, which shows how easy they really are!! He and I both thought they tasted fabulous! I added gravy to mine, but he ate his plain, so they are good either way! Enjoy!

Good recipe.  I used 4 medium sized russet baking potatoes.   Next time I would probably decrease the amount of milk; my potatoes were almost too creamy.  I also used about 1/2 cup of unsalted butter.  I'm not sure how much salt I used but I added just enough.  Update:  I used 2 large russet potatoes, 1/2 cup of butter (yikes!) and between 1/2-3/4 cup of milk.  Delicious!

I made one change...I used 1 part butternut squash and 2 parts potatoes to use up some of our fresh squash.  I cubed the potatoes and the squash and put them in to boil together.  I boiled them for longer...40 minutes before I mashed them.  Turned out great and I was able to sneak in some veggies that the kids didn't even notice.  Thanks for the recipe.

AMAZING! I expected it to be more difficult to make mashed potatoes from scratch, but this was super easy.

These were amazing! Boiling the peeled/cubed potatoes really helped mash these to a smooth consistency. I actually quadrupled this recipe when I made it and they still came out wonderfully. I wanted garlic mashed potatoes so I sauteed fresh garlic (minced very fine) in the butter, then added the salt, pepper, and milk to the butter/garlic mixture and added it slowly as I mashed the potatoes--this helps to distribute the flavors evenly.

These were so good.  I made this recipe for a pierogie filling. I don't make mashed potatoes often because I don't really care for them, but I tried some of these to make sure they were ok, and wanted more!  I definitely make these for my family.

Fantastic recipe! For those who like things a little more precise (or aren't using russet potatoes) I found that 1.5 lbs of potatoes works very well.

Great traditional way to make potatoes.  However, both times I have made these I'm sure I cooked them too long, but less than the time the recipe calls for.  I suggest checking the potatoes early to see if they are done, or you may end up with a soupy mess!

Great! Can't go wrong with this recipe. I do double the quantity of butter, add a little extra milk, and sometimes I mix in some garlic and/or garlic powder and Parmesan cheese.

These were very good.  They are simple, but go perfectly with something that the "loaded" potatoes would be too much for.  They are light and fluffy, and good as is, but you can add more salt, pepper, etc.. for your personal taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out really well. I was cooking for two, so i only used one large russet potato, but kept all the other ingredients as what they were listed.

This is the only way my kids have eaten mashed potatoes while at home because this is the way I have always prepared them (about 20 years). The only difference is that I use half and half in place of the milk. A never fail recipe that is perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Simply delicious! And this is coming from somoene who is NOT a mashed potatoes fan.  I just can't stand runny/watery/etc - must have substance and flavor and these have both.  Hubby doesn't like garlic ones, but I added a clove to the pot and boiled it with them - without overpowering, it added a nice subtle flavor.  RETURN POTATOES TO PAN on very low heat for about 1-2 minutes to evaporate water before mashing.  5 stars mmm-mmm-good  :-)

Wow, I cannot believe how easy these were to make! My boyfriend loves when I make him cheesy-stuffed baked potatoes, and I didn't want to waste all of the scooped out potato so I looked for an easy mashed potatoes recipe. This only took me 5 minutes! I used a little less butter than called for, a dash of garlic powder, and sprinkled in some parsley. They tasted like I slaved over them for hours but it only took 5 minutes! Thanks for the great recipe, this one is a keeper!

These turned out fluffy and delicious. I used red potatoes and when I boiled them, I added a cube of chicken boullion. I added a little more milk and a little more butter then it said to, and I also mashed in some garlic powder along with the pepper.

Great simple mashed potatoes!  I cut the potatoes fairly small (1 inch cubes) and cooked 20 minutes.  Came out perfect!

I have used this recipe so many times, I finally decided I needed to rate it! THANK YOU! Great recipe. The only thing I change is I use yukon potatoes and I add 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream. Just makes it the perfect mashed potatoes.

These are perfect, simple mashed potatoes.  I had a few extra potatoes, so I increased the butter to 6tbsp.  After draining, I returned my potatoes to the hot pan for a couple of minutes to evaporate the excess water before mashing.

These potatoes were great!  very easy to make. (first time i've ever made mashed potatoes) I doubled the butter and put in 3/4 cup milk like the other reviews stated and they came out way to soupy.  next time i will use the 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup milk like the recipie states.  I threw in a cup of shredded cheese to combat the soupiness and they turned out great.  4 stars because no one can top my MIL's potatoes :)

I just made these for Thanksgiving. Soooooo good. Here's what I did different. Doubled the recipe, used half and half instead of milk, added some roasted garlic. Sooo good. I ate a small bowl with some shaved parmasian cheese I had. I could have eaten them all. Very simple and easy.

I love this recipe for mashed potatoes.  I boiled in 1 can of chicken stock and water.  I also added sour cream to make it creamier.  Basics with just a little extra.

A little bland, but this is def. your average mashed potato. Will probably make this again for a normal family dinner, but for a dinner party I would prob seek out something a little more unique.

Though relatively easy to make, they really were too bland for me, and I even added extra margarine, salt, and pepper to it. In the end, I had to use gravy to compensate for its blandness.

I rate this a 4 because even though the recipe is simple and quick, I think it lacked a bit of taste. Maybe next time I'll add a little something extra to it. Also, make sure you cook those potatoes well through. The result otherwise is not good.

I never made mashed potatoes before.  I wanted a simple recipe and this was it!  Although simple - it tasted great!!  I did double the milk and butter per other reviews and was glad I did.  I also followed the tip to add potatoes back in the hot pan to make sure to remove excess water from drained potatoes. Thanks for a great recipe, which I will be making over and over.

Good!  The texture was perfect, but it is quite rich (probably amplified by my use of whole milk).  Heated the milk together in with the butter in the microwave which worked well.  Next time I might try substituting grated cheese for some of the butter.

They were good, but they seemed like they were missing something.  I will probably add Ranch dressing next time.

I've used this recipe several times, but for a change, this time i boiled the cubed potatoes in chicken broth, it tasted even better that way. i also added cheddar cheese to give it a twist. this is a great recipe!

i used this recipe to make mash for a steak dinner i was preparing for my man. The potatoes turned out to be light and fluffy! However, that was only achieved after I doubled the amount of milk called for. Overall, this is an amazing recipe to be used as a base for mashed potatoes! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I always heat the milk and melt the butter before adding to the potatoes.  I use my KitchenAid mixer to whip these up nice and fluffy with no lumps!  My oldest could eat five pounds of potatoes when I make these.  A simple basic recipe that makes absolutely fabulous mashed potatoes!  I wouldn't change a thing, this recipe is perfection!

Yes, I had to look up a recipe to make mashed potatoes! These were spot on! I doubled the butter cuz, well, cuz I wanted too, that's why. I don't own a masher so I mixed them w/my hand mixer which left yummy little lumps...mmmmmm!!

Easy and delicious. I'm never exact with the amount of ingredients--like the other reviews said, double (or at least add more of) milk, butter, salt etc. I also added some garlic.

Very good. I wanted to add more liquid and flavor without increasing the butter and milk, so after mixing the called for amounts in, I added some chicken broth, a couple dashes of hot sauce, and a bit of garlic salt. Not enough of any of those to stand out on their own, but they definitely boosted the overall dish. I also left the skins on and tossed in finely chopped spinach. I will definitely use this as my guideline for mashed potatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

So good and easy!  I did double the milk and butter, because I like mashed potatoes that are moist and creamy.  I also substituted garlic salt for regular salt.  My husband loved these!  Will definitely be making again!

Quite nice - personally like a bit more butter flavour - but then; a bit of butter tucked in the top of the little 'mound' aleviates that, now worries!  Will make again; thanks for the recipe.

Very good, I made a turkey breast today and wanted to make "real" potatoes as the husband calls them. Okay when I'm in a rush the BC instant potatoes, gets the job done! They were very creamy and I did add just a little more milk to satisfy our preference.

I forgot how easy it is to make mashed potatoes! I only used 2 big potatoes so I kept the other ingredient amounts as written. It was good but not outstanding. I will try again but use other posters hints of adding cloves, garlic and keeping the potato skins on.

I made these to go along with the Roast Sticky Chicken Rotiesserie Style, also found on this site. My boyfriend thought they were great. I however, wasn't that impressed. Then again, I'm used to mom's mashed potatoes, and nothing will ever compare to that. :D So, four stars because my boyfriend loved them, but only four stars because nothing can compare to mom's.

I have been making mashed potatoes with sour cream, cream cheese, and onion powder for years. I wanted to try the more traditional way, but didn't know the proportions, so I used this recipe. It turned out great as-is. I cannot imagine adding DOUBLE the amount of milk, like some reviewers suggested -- they were just barely thick enough with the amount suggested! (I am a butter-lover, so I think doing double the butter would be a fine idea!) I suppose it really depends on how "medium" your potatoes really are. I just used a variety of sizes out of the ten pound bag I got and figured they'd equal out to "medium."

Awesome! This is my first time making mashed potatoes EVER--because I generally don't like them. I followed suggestions of garlic in the water, sour cream, whipping cream, butter--I did it all! Again, awesome!

great easy recipe.  I did replace the butter with Garlic butter (for added flavour) and I whipped the potatoes after I mashed them for a smooth creamier texture.

I did as someone recommended and threw two cloves in the boiling water, only I crushed them first and then mashed with the potatoes. I warmed the milk and butter together, didn't measure the salt and pepper but did it by sight, and added a dash of garlic powder. These were so easy and so delicious! Great with the southern gravy I made.

This recipe was pretty good, but not the best... of course I did change it some.  I kept the skin on the potatoes, added 2 Tablespoons of sour cream, added 1 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, a tsp. of Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb Flavor, and sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top.  I don't add salt to anything... and in this case I'm thinking that these would've turned out much better if I had...

Excellent! My kids are not use to real mashed potatoes so they didn't like them but my husband and I LOVED them! I did add more butter and milk to make it really creamy. I also added some seasoning for flavor.

I was excited by the reviews, but this was waaaaay too much milk...I even had thrown in a couple more potatoes and it was watery...I drained off as much milk as i could (along with most of the spices i added :-( ) then microwaved, and then broiled them trying to dry them up....they were like another reviewer stated like baby food

Good base recipe for mashed potatoes!  I've made these several times.  I usually make 12 servings because they're just as good reheated.  I've added sour cream a couple times as well as rosemary and garlic- versatile recipe, but doesn't need a thing added for plain traditional potatoes.

I love mashed potatoes. I've never measured before, this seams to be right. And oh soo goood.I've used milk, cream,1/2and 1/2, whipping cream, all kinds of different spices, and I've put cream chesse, and grated chesse in it.But use an electric mixer for these. Not so much a potatoe masher, not if you want them creamy.

I have made much better mashed potatoes, these tasted water logged and too smooth. The cooking time is too long, and there was too much liquid added. My husband said they weren't too bad, he thought they were instant mashed potatoes. That means it's a no for me!

These were excellent potatoes!  I can't believe I have gone through life so long without making my own mashed potatoes!  I will be keeping this recipe and no longer buying the boxed potatoes.  I did add a little extra butter and used a hand mixer.

Good-bye boxed mash potatoes!  This was so easy!  I probably used a bit more butter and milk than the recipe called for as I like mine a bit creamier.  Season to taste.

Great way to make mashed potatoes.  I used russet (peeled) and red potatoes (with skins), and added about 2 tblsp of sour cream.  Used a masher...looked very gourmet and tasted devine!

With so few ingredients, I thought for sure these were going to be rather bland, but boy was I in for a surprise! These are wooonderful alone, with gravy, or any other way you can think of having them! Try them and you will NOT regret it!

To make this pareve used 1/2 cup butter substitute (or margarine) and 1/2 cup broth.  I also used 2 different types of potatos to add a bit of texture.  It was excellent!

Yummmm... I doubled the butter =P and roasted 4 cloves of garlic.  Cut the hard end off the garlic, left skin on, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil, 30 min @ 400 degrees... squeeze the garlic out of the skin and mash along with the potatoes. also, added about 1/2 cup of milk to boil the potatoes in. 2nd time around: added small drained can of whole kernel corn and used a good amount of coarse black pepper.  Awesome!

This is a good basic recipe for mashed potatoes.  I used a potato ricer to make them very smooth and creamy.  Five large russet potatoes produced more than enough for eight of us.  I added horseradish to one third of the mashed potatoes for a great twist on traditional potatoes.  Thanks for a great dependable recipe!

Very good! Only change I made was I added some minced garlic, alittle extra salt and butter (but that's just to reflect my taste). Simple recipe that is fairly quick to make! Thanks for the recipe!

That's a very good basic mashed potato recipe. Seems like everyone has a little tweak that they add....I do, too.  I substitute buttermilk for regular milk and still use but a little less unsalted butter. MMmmm, I want some now!

My mashed potatoes never really tasted quite right, and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong.  I wanted to find a simple recipe to follow, and this one turned out perfectly.  They actually tasted like real mashed potatoes for once.

If you're looking for delicious mashed potatoes, this is it. Nothing fancy, but the recipe (along with the betty crocker tip of putting the potatoes back in the pan for a few seconds after you drain them) was GREAT. I warmed up the milk and the butter before i added it (and probably ended up putting twice as much butter). YUM.

Made this last night with the Glazed Meatloaf II recipe. They were delicious!!! The warm butter and milk are definitely the trick, as stated by several viewers. I doubled the milk to 1 c. and doubled the salt as well. I also added a little extra black pepper. They were fantastic and my husband said they were as good as his moms...BIG compliment!!

These were amazing! I left the skins on the potatoes and added more salt/pepper and butter after they were done for taste but I followed the recipe as is and they came out fantastic.

I have been making mashed potatoes this way for years. This is how my grandfather showed me how. I love mashed potatoes and making different varieties, but this one is a classic and sometimes just can't be beat.

Very creamy and delish!  Used 1 cup warm milk, 1/2 stick butter and 2 tbsp I can't believe its not butter. LOTS of salt (very much needed and I am not a salt person).  Husband even commented on the creaminess.  A definite winner!

I only had unsalted butter, and so I had to use 1/2 cup and still add salt for flavor.

Delicious! The key is to warm the milk and the butter. I added just a bit more butter, but it didn't really need it. I'll definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these last night along with cheesy turkey meatloaf (from this site), and they were really good. I usually make mashed potatoes from a box, but I will no longer be doing that. I was surprised at how easy these were to make. I never knew real mashed potatoes were so easy to make. My husband really liked them. I didn't make gravy, although that would probably make them even better. I think next time I'll put more butter in them. This is definitely the way I will be making mashed potatoes from now on. Thanks for the simple and quick recipe!

Yummy! I'm only twenty and i'm trying to learn to make down-home style cooking; but trying to make things that compare to anyones grandmothers recipe down here in the south would most likely result in low reviews... but this was a hit!  I made these one day and put them in the fridge then when me and my friends came back from a night out on the town everyone dug in! and loved them! thanks a lot!

These turned out pretty basic.

Only thing I did different was use Yukon Golds. I also added a couple tablespoons of butter to melt in the middle and on top of the potatoes.

I'll stick to my way of making potatoes with real butter and sour cream.

These were so good. I added some dried parsley for color and garlic powder for flavor. I made them with the simple beef flavored gravy recipe from this site. Since the gravy had butter in it I decreased some of the amount of butter in the potatoes and added more milk. These were delicious with corn and the glazed meatloaf I recipe from this site. I won't make mashed potatoes without heating up the milk first ever again.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written and it turned out wonderfully. I've NEVER been able to make mashed potatoes, but my hubby kept asking me to try again so I thought I would. He ate several helping and kept saying how delicious they were. I'll be using this recipe all the time!

I love mashed potatoes and I have made them several different ways. This was a great recipe! My wife and I enjoyed it. I always add garlic to mine and today was no exception. I roasted some garlic in the oven and put it in as I mashed the potatos! Turned out exquisit!

Perfect!  I feel like a great cook until it comes to mashed potatoes...but these turned out great!! I boiled two slices of an onion with the potatoes then mashed them with the rest of the potatoes.  I boiled 5 potatoes, used the milk and added about 6 tablesoons of butter with some lawry's salt.  I feel very proud tonight :)

Wasn't the greatest.  The russet potatoes didn't really do much for me.  I'll stick with my Yukon Gold recipe.

Thanks, though...

Definitely a crowd pleaser.  Good basic recipe that you could add herbs and other flavors for variation.

You were right! This recipe was so easy and delicious. I love potatoes but never took the time to make mashed potatoes at home. I will from now on and I'll never use flakes again!

This was a great recipe!!  I added a little more milk than it called for just because my roommates and I like mashed potatoes a little more creamy and soft.  Excellent!

Simply? Awesome! Mashed potatoes seem simple, but I always had problems with the proper amounts of milk and butter. I generally add a small amount of garlic powder, but my family and I are funny about garlic anyway.

These are a great and simple recipe recipe for mashed potatoes. I make them regularly, personally I use cream instead of milk and I warm it in the microwave first to help in blending everything together and to prevent the cold cream from cooling the taters.

This recipe was great to get me started. Since I used organic potatoes, I didn't peel them. I just washed them really well and the skin added to the texture. I added some extra spices (dried chives, parsley, and  thyme), and threw in a pressed clove of garlic. I also used soy milk instead of milk since my partner is avoiding most dairy these days. We topped ours with some nutritional yeast gravy and yum! Thanks for the recipe.

Okay good baseline for a simple mashed potatoes recipe and I will always refer back to this one!  Having said that....have fun...spice it up if you would like..try different types of potatoes, try garlic (Disclaimer...I add garlic to EVERYTHING) , try a touch of sour cream...you choose have fun but use this as a guideline!

Excellent recipe - just like Mom makes 'em! However, how I make them is to add a tablespoon or so of sour cream to the potatoes; and, I mix them with my mixer or bread maker! I found that my bread maker (getting little use these days) was perfect for making the creamiest mashed potatoes! I just turn it off after it goes through its initial cycle.

this mashed potato really tastes like a classic homemade one. I made it exactly like the recipe and it turned out fine; the only mistake i made was mashing it without cutting the potato up as suggested, but it still mashes up the same (just that it became quite a good workout for my arms). However, not a 5star cos i felt that it wasn't something outstanding enough for me to keep wanting more of it. I ate it with Swedish meatball sauce, and i thought it worked well with the potato for its gravy. Good recipe, but not the best around.

SOOO easy to make (once you get the potatoes mashed).  I added chopped green beans with the melted butter while it cooked and put all ingredients together and poured it over the mashed potatoes and mixed.  Just delicious.  Will definitely make again.

So easy and delicious! They are creamy and light, a great side to any meal, and are very versatile. I followed the recipe exactly, and it accompanied my braised short ribs very nicely. If I was cooking a more basic meal, I may add a bit more character to the potatoes, like scallions, chives, or roasted garlic. But this recipe is going to stay in my recipe box as a reference for what the exact measurements are for great mashed potatoes.

Very tasty!  I've always made out of the box potatoes becuase I was concerned about the time and patience with mashing them.  This was so easy, I was shocked I haven't been making these the whole time!  I doubled the milk per others reccommendations, but husband said it wasn't necessary.

These were good. Made as specified. Next time I may try some of the other reviewers suggestions as to spices, substitutions, etc. just for fun. But these are good as is and would be perfect for topping casseroles, etc. as well.

Best mashed potatoes I ever had!  I used 1/2 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, and used what potatoes I had - russett and red, but I left the skin on the red ones, other than that followed the recipe.  I let the butter and 1/2 & 1/2 warm to room temperature while I cooked.  I used an electric mixer which made them creamy with no lumps.  I never used a recipe before for basic mashed potatoes and now I'm sorry I didn't.

I didn't love this. It was very easy to make but extremely bland when made the way the recipe called for. I did enjoy how fluffy they were and with fresh garlic they were fine.

Awesome recipe.  I substituted the 1/2 cup of milk for a 1/2 cup of half & half to make them extra creamy.  There are plenty of ways to add different flavors to this recipe, such as adding garlic or cheese, but the mashed potatoes are great just like this.

This is a good, classic mashed potatoes recipe.  I followed these directions (double recipe) and for creamier potatoes added one package of Neufchatel cheese.

These potatoes turned out very good. I mixed gold and red-skinned potatoes and left the skins on and added scallions and extra butter...and heating the butter and milk prior to mixing it with the potatoes does make then creamier. I did need to add a little extra salt but other than that, this was a yummy recipe for mashed potatoes.

These are pretty good.  I LOVE mashed potatoes, so you'd have to mess up a recipe pretty badly for me not to like them.  Hub thinks they need some garlic.
The only con that I can see is the prep time...you have to REALLY want homemade mashed potatoes.  Other than that, viva this recipe!  :)

I am absolutely obsessed with potatoes and have tried countless experimental mashed potatoes recipes, but this one is the best. I added a couple sprigs of fresh thyme to the water while cooking the potatoes, and it gave the final product a wonderful taste. I highly recommend it!

Great potatoes but I doubled the butter.  The consistency was perfect!  We ate it without gravy, but I think gravy on these would be better because the taste is very simple.  Next time I make these without any gravy, I might add some other flavors to it like sour cream or garlic.  Will make again and again!

This recipe was a great help.  I have made mashed potatoes for years but they were never just right.  I always added the right stuff, just never the right amounts!!!

My guest loved these, I didn't think they were that special. Sorry.
