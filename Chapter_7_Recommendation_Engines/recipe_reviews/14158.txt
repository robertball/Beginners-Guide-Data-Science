This is a wonderful recipe. After reading other people's reviews, I decided I needed to add something to sweeten it up. So I took two table spoons of honey, instead of sugar. I also used usual balsamic vinegar and didn't add any herbs so that I can enjoy just the taste of vinegar, black pepper and garlic. Turned out great! My boyfriend commented that this dressing makes him wants to keep eating salad.

As suggested by previous reviewers, I added some honey (to taste) to balance the tanginess of the (Alessi) white balsamic vinegar.  Just couldn't seem to unpucker the lips after the initial taste test (reason it only rated four stars).  No other changes were necessary.  Used greens I had on hand, ie., romaine hearts and iceberg lettuce.  Threw in some roasted sliced almonds, dried cranberries and some crumbled goat cheese.  YUM!!

This has become a staple vinaigrette for me.  I use double the garlic, and it has a nice kick.  I usually make double and store it for about a week in the fridge.  Thanks Gary!

I have made this several times and it is always well received by my guests. Since the two main ingredients are the balsamic vinegar and the olive oil, the secret to success is picking the correct brands.  Use a high end balsamic vinegar and  the
extra virgin olive oil that fits this recipe!  All brands say "extra virgin" on the bottle, but they are not all equal in taste.  The extra virgins I like with this are the less expensive “Goya” brand and the more high end "B.R. Cohn."

This was a really tasty dressing that I used over pasta salad. You can certainly play around with this recipe using your favorite herbs and spices, or sweetening it up a bit with a little sugar. Thanks Gary!

3:1 oil to vinegar ratio is important.  If you follow the 3:1 ratio you will not need to add extra sugars or other unnecessary ingredients in vinaigrette. I would have rated this a 3.5 star but you can not do halfsies.  Otherwise a good basic vinaigrette.  Oh and don't store this too long if you use fresh garlic.  There is a chance that botulism could take up residence.  If you roast the garlic first then you are much safer.

Calorie/Fat watchers...i add about 1/2 cup of water to make the dressing thinner so that it will go farther and i will use less..plus it coats my salad better. I have very good luck doing this. Perfect salad dressing. I love it!!! I did read other reviews and added a blop of honey. I'm going to try Splenda next time instead of honey. This dressing is awesome on my mixed greens, feta and pine nuts salad.

Great Dressing.  Try the different balsamic vinegars for different tastes.  We use this for almost all salads and then sprinkle some freshly grated parmesan on top.  Wonderful

Very good, very simple.  I recommend using salad oil instead of olive oil as olive oil tends to overtake a recipe.  Like others, I added a tsp of sugar and herbs.

A great salad dressing that tastes good and doesn't require a billion different ingredients. It is definitely a good go to recipe, that beats the bottled stuff, and is more economical. A suggestion, substitute the balsamic vinegar with seasoned rice vinegar to make a basic Asian styled dressing.

A family favorite!  The dijon and garlic are a perfect match.  As with any recipe like this, the quality of the olive oil and the basalmic are going to make or break the recipe.  Taste both separately to see what your preference is.  Fabulous together!

What a great, quick vinaigrette.  I use this recipe all the time!  It's great on mixed greens and a wonderful dressing for chicken, roasted red peppers and fresh mozzarella cheese wraped in wheat wraps.  And the best part is that it's easy and with ingredient that one always has on hand.

Delicious recipe.  I made it to use in the blackbean and corn salad recipe also found on this site and it was very tasty.  I did substitute regular balsamic vinegar because I did not have white and I added a little sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a no brainer since I love all the ingredients already. I just throw the salad into a ziplock and pour a little dressing in at a time and shake it all up to get it nice and evenly coated.

I cut back on the olive oil by about a 1/3 and added 1/2 cup of sour cream to thicken it and make it a bit creamy.  Mayo might have been a better option, but it wasn't available when I made this.  Sour cream tasted just fine to me though.  This is a great recipe and goes well with Courtney's Salad

Really tasty and easy salad dressing.  My husband even liked it and hes a ranch dressing and nothing else guy.  I did add a little dried onion and just a little powdered ginger to really add some zing!  I cant wait to try it on cucumber salad!

I used traditional balsamic vinegar. I didn't find this dressing to be anything special. The vinegar taste was a little too strong and we couldn't taste the other ingredients.

This salad dressing is delicious, but adding a tablespoon or two of honey is a must. If you don't keep ground mustard on hand (I don't), you can add 2-3 teaspoons of prepared mustard with good results. YUM!!!

Delish. This dressing is especially good with a salad including fresh, homegrown tomatoes. I've made it half a dozen times, now. It's permanently on the recipe rotation! Make sure you add a bit of sugar, as suggested by another reviewer. I add a good teaspoon, or so.

Great basic recipe!  I only took away 1/2 a star because I think that it was slightly heavy on the vinegar.  I added some honey for balance.

I never need to buy balsamic dressing again! I used dark balsamic vinegar, since that's all I had. I also keep a packet of Trader Joe's crushed garlic in my freezer; that made it even easier. I took someone's advice and added two cloves, as well as a spoonful of honey.

WOW!  I used more garlic and used regular balsamic.  I also used 1/4 cup vinegar and 3/4 cup oil instead of the measurements given.  This was to die for.  I will never eat just olive oil and balsamic again.  I will prepare it this way always.  If you love garlic, this is the dressing for you!

I bought salad for dinner last night, but realized that after we moved a few weeks ago I had thrown out all of our dressing! I didn't want to go to the store, so I looked up this simple recipe to try. I am SO glad I did! I just threw the ingredients into my mini-blender and it was 5 star restaurant quality dressing. I was so impressed with the robust flavor, that I think I'm going to serve it at an upcoming housewarming party next month. I doubt I'll buy store-bought vinaigrette ever again.

I thought this recipe was fabulous!!  I didn't have any ground mustard, so I used plain old yellow mustard and it worked out fabulously.  I also thought it was missing a little something so I added onion powder and celery salt.  Those two little ingredients amped up the flavor 100 fold!  Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe has become a family favorite and staple in my house.  my mom asks me to make it almost every week.  i make it to the recipe, except i also add some herbs from my mccormick italian herb seasoning grinder.  i was skeptical using equal amounts of vinegar and oil, but it turned out really nice.  the mustard gives it a nice tang w/o being overwheleming.  along with homemade croutons, this makes the best salad!  thank you for the recipe!

I loved this dressing.  I did add honey to sweeten it up as suggested by others.  I served it with field greens, red onions, pecans, dried cranberries & bleu cheese crumbles.  My guests loved it too!  This is a keeper!

This is my kind of vinaigrette.  It's easy to tweak to your taste.  I love balsamic, however, I thought this could benefit from a little sugar.  I used a good quality white balsamic, and extra virgin olive oil.  Knowing I love garlic, I used a heaping 1/2 tsp. of garlic and 1 heaping tablespoons of white sugar.  Dry mustard, kosher salt, and fresh cracked pepper fnished it off.  This is light, slightly tangy and a perfect compliment to Italian dishes.  I was looking for a good white balsamic vinaigrette and I'm gladly stopping here!

I'm sure it's good as written but...I only had 1/3 C olive oil, so added 1/4 C white balsamic and tblsp fresh lemon juice. Had poupon style mustard. Used fresh crushed garlic. added in 1 tsp of pulverized dried Italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp dried minced onion + 1 tsp Mirin (sweet cooking wine). Also, for elmusifiing I used 1 tsp mayo. I had a cleaned out  "squeeze bear" honey comes in and shook it up in that. Tasted seriously good. Need to buy more olive oil so I can make larger quantity for summer time salads (with or without lettuce). Would be excellent marinade too or for pasta/potato salads for cookouts. Easy, quick and look forward to making with fresh herbs in summer. I made early in day so flavors married together.

quick and easy and tastes great! i made the following changes after reading the comments below: used traditional balsamic vinegar, added an extra clove of garlic, added a squeeze of honey, and accidentally left out the salt and pepper. next time i will use less olive oil and add the salt and pepper. this was great, thanks for recipe!

Not much different from my usual oil and vinegar dressing (three Tbspn olive oil to two Tbspn balsamic) - I do prefer more salt and pepper. Arugula, tomato, avocado, mozzarella, toasted pine nuts... And no honey for me please - I love the tang!!

Very good!  I used dijon mustard instead of ground mustard, which worked well as an emulsifier too.  I love vinegar, but this was a little too zippy for me.  Next time I will reduce the vinegar to 1/3 cup and maybe add a little honey.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I did want to suggest another way to add sweetness: use a good quality aged balsamic vinager, which has a natural wonderful sweetness. It will make all the difference, and create a better balance.

I didn't add in any herbs, so maybe this is where I went wrong.  The taste was too "vinegary" for my liking.

Although I used traditional balsamic, I think the 1:1 ratio of balsamic and olive oil was a little off. Something just wasn't right. It was very easy, but not our favorite, sorry.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, but it was quite sour.  I don't like sweet salad dressings, but this was too tart even for my taste buds.  I added 2 tbsp raw honey, and it was perfect.  With this addition I will make it again and again!

Incredibly tasty! I found that I was out of salad dressing at the last minute before my dinner party and lo! Allrecipes bailed me out, yet again! Dinner guests raved about this dressing. I love that I don't have to keep processed, bottled salad dressing around until it spoils only to throw it out. Made this in minutes and cost me pennies. Definitely a keeper.

this is a great recipe.  make sure you use a good quality balsamic vinegar. it should say "of modena" on the bottle.  the longer it's aged the better it will be. i added 2 T. of sugar. it was delicious!!thank you(:

This is an excellent recipe and the perfect accompaniment to a leafy salad. One modification is to use a generous teaspoon of Colmans English Mustard to really add a kick!

Easy, delicious, totally dependent on the quality of the balsamic vinegar and the olive oil.  Good ingredients = good dressing!  Next time, I will use a bit more salt and dijon mustard.  Thanks for posting!

The dressing was just ok. I LOVE white balsalmic vinegar and thought that 1/2 cup might be too much and it was. Probably would half the vinegar next time and add another clove of garlic.

Delicious and so easy! Followed the recipe for the most part; only thing I did different was doubling the garlic (I can never have enough garlic).  This will be something I make often.  Thanks for the recipe!

I also thought it was a little too "vinegary" as written.  I added a little more oil and honey to compensate.  Will make again with changes.

This vinaigrette sauce has too much balsamic vinegar.  The ratio should be 2 parts extra virgin olive oil and 1 part balsamic vinegar.  Please don't use sugar and please don't use an inferior brand of balsamic vinegar.  A good mustard - either seeded or not - is essential too.

Just made this and I'm in the minority - I think it needs more balsamic and another clove of garlic.  Next time I'll add another 1/4 cup balsamic and keep the oil the same.

This is a very good recipe.  I love balsamic vinegar, but this has just a little too much "bite."  I added a little more than a teaspoonful of real maple syrup.  Loved it!

Perfectly delicious! I added about 1 tablespoon of honey but I think it would have been delicious without just a bit tangier. I used regular balsamic vinegar because that's what I had. Also added a dash of rice vinegar. Poured this over a Chef's salad - diced tomatoes, cubed cheese, diced chicken (from a rotisserie chicken), diced cucumbers, roasted cashews, etc and it was out of this world!! I will keep this dressing on hand from now on. It takes about one minute to prepare and is absolutely define! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

An easy-to-make dressing. I made as directed and then tasted the result - I did find it a bit too vinegary tasting, so added 2 tbsp. of maple syrup which cut the acid and enhanced the flavour.

Hubby usually prefers ranch dressing, but we don't eat salad often enough before the bottle spoils (tsk, tsk). Made this tonight and served over baby spinach, fresh mushrooms, and avocado. YUM! Can't wait for the kids to try it. Thanks for the post!

Fantastic!!! First of all, I scaled this for two salads.  I served it over a simple blend of romaine lettuce, roma tomatoes, hard boiled egg, red onion and Danish bleu cheese crumbles.  I added a dash more chopped garlic, otherwise, I made it to scale.  Tart, tangey and delicious, this goes a long way!  I highly recommend this recipe and this will be a keeper in my recipe box, thanks!

This was great!  As others suggested, I added some honey.  One thing I found is that this is better made in advance and put in the fridge for the flavors to marry.

This is a great recipe! I used regular balsamic vinegar and regular yellow mustard, and like others recommended, I added 2 tbsp honey and 1/2 tsp sugar to reduce the tartness. I blended this in my Magic Bullet blender, and the result was a restaurant quality dressing! Thanks for sharing!

This was exactly what I was looking for. I used a bit more garlic, partly because I had to use garlic powder and partly because I LOVE garlic, and I, like other users, added some honey and oregano. Absolutely delicious on my mixed greens, farm-fresh green bean, tomato, and feta salad today! I'm so glad I have a lot left to make a tomato/mozzarella salad.

Thanks for this GREAT vinaigrette!

My favorite dressing by far! I no longer need to waste money at the grecoery store on dressings that are full of preservatives and chemicals. I usually add a tablespoon of honey to sweeten it up a bit.

I store it in a glass bottle from a sore bought dressing in the fridge and it keeps nicely.

Simple and Easy. Has a little zest. I used regular balsamic. Can be used as a basic and experiment with other vinagers. In which I plan to do.

Basic. Zesty. Yummy. I used half regular "red" balsamic and half natural rice vinegar. The result was fantastic. I probably put in a little more salt, pepper and fresh garlic than called for, but it turned out perfect!

This was okay... needed some more flavor though, most of the flavor comes from the vinegar. I will add herbs or more garlic next time.

It needed something (maybe my using regular balsamic was to blame), but my husband was happy that I made a vinaigrette as opposed to all the cream-based dressings that we have in the fridge. I used garlic powder and prepared mustard as I had seen that done on a cooking show, and it turned out fine. I dipped some bread in it and got rid of the craving for bread-oil-dippage. :) Thanks so much for the recipe, Gary! It'll be a great base recipe to play with!

This is one of my all-time favorite dressings.  I use the regular (not white) balsamic vinegar and fresh black pepper.  Sometimes add fresh basil or rosemary if I have it.  Simple and so delicious!

Love the vinegary tang to this.  Used regular balsamic instead of white because of what I had on hand.  Tasted great on our salad.

Very good basic recipe; however, not 5 stars for me because it has a very overpowering vinegar bite to it.  I combatted that by heeding the advice of other reviewers and adding about a tablespoon of honey.  When done this way, I will make it again and again.

Good basic recipe.  I liked it as is, but other reviews are right - it is very vinegary. I added some sugar and a bit of freshly squeezed orange juice and it was even better.

I make this frequently Much depends on the balsamic vinegar.  The better the quality, the better the results.  One or two batches came out 'vinegary' but it was the product not the recipe.

This is a very good light dressing.  I scaled the servings down to 2 and added 1/4tsp good quality honey.  That made enough for a large salad for our family for dinner with seared chicken breast in top.  I'll definitely make again.

I added maybe 1/2 a packet of Splenda to cut the vinegar a bit as other reviews mention. The recipe itself is pretty good but, it needs just a tad bit more of "something" (zip, bite, depth). Definitely a keeper and I will play with the ingredients in the future.

I used plain balsamic vinegar and it was *outstanding*. Sometimes I add just a dab of honey, but not always. It's even better the next day when the flavors have a chance to blend. We almost always have a bottle going now, and I will never buy it at the store again :)

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I like the tangy vinegar flavour so I kept the ratio of 1:1 with oil the same but I didn't have ground mustard so I used 1 tsp of dijon instead.  I also added 2 Tbsp of honey like other reviewers.  It was just enough sweetness to balance everything off.

I've made this several times, and each time I've found it's improved by the addition of just a bit of red wine vinegar- maybe a teaspoon or two. It just seems to give it a smoother, less oily texture/taste. Upping the garlic doesn't hurt either!

Tasty, but added extra garlic, mustard powder, 5 drops of stevia, and a couple tablespoons of ground dijon mustard (what I had) to give it more flavor.

Very yummy!  This appealed to me primarily as the ratio of oil to vinegar is equal - I always alter the oil/vin ratios in dressings as we find the oil is normally way too high in our opinion!  This one was more typical of what I tend to make!  I also liked the white balsamic as I tend to use regular balsamic.  Using the white yields a slightly lighter dressing, nonetheless, fantastic!  You can't beat homemade dressing, so much better than store bought!

It was really good! Would have been better with garlic (I was out) but it was perfectly serviceable as it was! I made it in my little 3-cup chopper, so it was well-emulsified, too!

Love this dressing. If you don't have a really good sweet balsamic then you probably want a little more oil to vinegar ratio than called for, and maybe a tad of sweetener. I love vinegar so even though my balsamic isn't the best I kept to the recipe. Don't have white balsamic so used regular. I also emulsified it in a blender and ended up with a somewhat unattractive color, I don't think I'll bother with that next time and just shake it.

Fast and tasty, but it needed a little something so I doubled the amount of garlic and added a tablespoon of chopped basil, a teaspoon of oregano, a 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and teaspoon of honey.

4 stars as written, but a 5 star recipe with the addition of a touch of sweetener.  Made half a batch, added one packet of Splenda, and this is wonderful.  Just got some white balsamic, and this is the first thing I've made with it.  Definitely a keeper!  This one is going in the recipe box.  Thanks for sharing.

Nice flavor - I cut the oil/vinegar to 1/3 cup of each and left the rest of the recipe the same. I also mixed in some greek oregano.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic.  At first I thought it was a 4-star recipe but after a day in the fridge it went to 5-star status.  I used the dark balsamic and it is delicious.  Bravo and thanks!

Great recipe!  I find using Dijon mustard emulsifies the oil and vinegar and adds wonderful flavor.  I also use herbs de Provence or fresh herbs from my garden.  This keeps all week in the refrigerator.  Better when it is room temperature.  This also works as a great marinade for veggies, chicken, glaze for salmon on the grill, etc.

Delicious. Simple, too. My only comment would be for those unfamiliar with dry mustard to sample this recipes with slightly different amounts. I ate this on a salad with red onion, parsley, and green beans.

I was looking for a basic simple recipe and this one was great!  I added a tsp of honey to soften the tang and 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1/2 tsp of rosemary for some extra zip.  rave reviews from my hubby who is NOT a vinaigrette fan!  very light and refreshing, perfect complement to a simple salad.

The basic recipe is good, but I like the flavor of garlic and herbs, so I added extra garlic to taste, and some fresh oregano and basil.  It came out yummy.  You can even sop up the dressing with sour dough garlic bread.  Excellent!

I'm on a low sodium diet and it's been impossible to make a decent salad with any kind of store bought dressing or packet - enter this magnificent flavor combo that brings Romain and Iceberg lettuce alive with robust sweet and tangy goodness without any sodium. With homemade bread toasted with garlic into croutons, sliced radish, shaved carrots, it's a feast!

This is a very good dressing.  The only change that I made was adding an extra minced garlic clove and 1/2 tsp. of dried oregano.  I used it over some fresh cucumbers and tomatoes from the garden.

It has become my very favourite dressing....I love it..I make 1 small substitution though which is 1/2 white balsamic & 1/2 dark balsamic...maybe just me but I think it's better this way.

This is a terrific and easy to make salad dressing. I have an old salad dressing carafe with lines on it showing the ratio of oil to vinegar, and a splash of water, which I added. As other reviewers stated, the balsamic vinegar needs to be a good quality, but it also needs a sweetener to balance it out. I used between 1-2 tablespoons of good quality raw honey, to taste. I may add a dash of Dijon mustard next time, but this is great not only for salads, but as a light sauce for steamed vegetable, pasta, even on chicken.

We forgot the balsamic dressing for our Thanksgiving Salad and I found this recipe on All Recipes website. It was a huge hit. The only thing that I used differently was dark balsamic vinegar instead of light. It was so delicious that I will never use store bought again.

I followed the recipe, as written, tasted it, and agreed with other reviewers that it needed a little honey to sweeten it up.  I added about 1 tablespoon and blended it in and it was perfect.  Everyone in the family loved it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a really good dressing but like others it needed some sweetener so I added a little sugar and really liked the result.  I'm making this again but will use some honey instead of the sugar. This is a great dressing poured over the spinach pomegranate salad from this site.  Looks beautiful with a Christmas dinner.

This is our go-to dressing.  Sometimes use prepared mustard instead of ground, sometimes use a different kind of vinegar, sometimes use granulated garlic instead of real garlic (but only in a pinch, the fresh garlic is so good). It always turns out good. 

We find the balsamic to be sweet enough. If use use a different vinegar, we add honey.

I'm new to cooking from scratch (or mostly from scratch). This was extremely easy to make. I did use regular Balsamic instead of White Balsamic because that's what I had. And, I used 2 cloves of garlic. It was DELICIOUS!!! I'm trying to cut back on sugar, and the main way to do that is to cook from scratch. Compared to the store bought dressing I used to use, this has a lot less sugar; it tastes better; and it costs significantly less. Some mentioned it wasn't sweet enough. I have no sweet tooth so I thought it was perfect.

I have been looking for a good vinaigrette and thought this one was it.  But I knew right away after making it and tasting it that something was missing.  I added a little more salt and sugar to taste.  That made it just right.  I then went back and read the top reviews and the few I read all seem to agree!  Cut the bitter with a little sweet to balance it out.

I used a clove and a half or garlic, and changed it to a 3:1 ratio for oil to vinegar. Also used regular balsamic vinegar. It came out real nice.

It's good, but a little bland when I made it according to the recipe. I found it quite sweet on its own with the white balsamic, contrary to other reviewers. It may depend on what kind of balsamic vinegar you use (quality makes a difference?).

I like this for my regular dinner salads. I also sweeten it with a little honey, sugar, or Slenda (roomate is diabetic) and I use it over mixed greens with sliced strawberries and blueberries and feta cheese. The berries add their own sweetness so don't oversweeten the dressing. We have this as a lite summer meal on hot days.

I made this dressing to go on the Spinach Pomegranate Salad (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/spinach-pomegranate-salad/detail.aspx) for a dinner party last night.  I followed the advice of others and added 2 tsp honey.  This turned out great!  Glad I have some leftover to add to my greens today.

I just whipped this up for our salad- Delish!!!! My husband loved it too.  I followed the recipe then went out to my herb garden and added purple & green basil, rosemary, oregano and thyme. OMG it is great. Now I can not wait to taste it tomorrow after the herbs have a chance to mix.. This would make a great marinate for any meat.

This is a very versatile vinaigrette. Delicious as a marinade for vegetables. I normally don't like zucchinis but after marinating and grilling they tasted amazing. Also good drizzled on homemade mexican pizza.

Really tasty!  I think you'd be fine to back off the olive oil a bit even, and maybe up the mustard by a tsp. (maybe that's a little too much...I'll have to play a bit).  I'm hoping the flavors marry a bit with the extra that I have, but it's really good right away anyway...a win/win.

This was very good, I used regular balsamic which I reduced by half.  Prolly a little too much as it was sweeter than I expected.  I also doubled the garlic as we are big fans.  Simple, good, easy, Thanks!

Try a good balsamic vinegar before you sweeten the vinaigrette.  The dressing should be sweet enough without sugar and honey.

It was a good flavored, very simple base for balsamic vinaigrette.  Next time I think I will try to add more garlic & will try adding the honey for sweetness.

This was a very good and simple recipe. As suggested by several other reviewers I added 1 Tbsp of honey, I think it definitely needs some sweetness in it.

Very yummy!  I halved the recipe and marinated some grape tomatos in it. Plan to pour over fresh spinach. I did add a squirt of honey..mmmm Edit: when my hubby ate this he said it was one of the best salad dressings ever.  He really loved it and wants me to make it often.

Excellent, basic recipe for salad dressing and tastes MUCH better than the bottled varieties.  I only made one serving, (being that I live by myself) using 1 TBS of each olive oil, balsamic vinegar, splash of regular vinegar, several dashes of garlic salt instead of crushed garlic and reg salt, fresh cracked pepper, couple dashes of ground mustard and didn't add sugar as I like the strong tangy-ness of the vingars.  Made the perfect amount for a medium to large salad for one.  Also, try topping salad with toasted, sliced almonds with this dressing, superb!

Excellent dressing can't wait to serve it to my husband tonight with a dinner salad.  I reduced the olive oil a little bit and took advice of others to add some honey.

Overall, this was a great recipe. It was a bit sour so I added some honey to balance the flavors. I probably won't use quite as much vinegar next time, but a great, quick, easy recipe!

I did not have a white balsamic vinegar on hand so I used a dark one in place of it.  Also added 1 T of honey to the dressing, used dijon mustard, increased garlic to 3 cloves minced.  Have made this several times and I love this dressing!

This worked great. The first time I made it, I just used what I had. So I made it with Balsamic Vinegar, instead of white, and used an herb infused olive oil I'd been given. Left out the garlic because the oil tasted like garlic anyways, but the mustard powder really gave it a great taste.

Loved it!

I tried this in hopes that I would have a use for my balsamic vinaigrette (since I became a vegetarian, I don't have any pot roast to cook it in!), didn't really care for the stuff... until now. 

My fiance who is a die hard ranch dressing fan requests that I make this all the time now.  I'm so addicted!  

It's perfect!  :)  I use the pre-minced garlic that you get in jars (in oil) just to make it easier faster.   Plus I use kosher salt. 

Wonderful!!

Quite easy and tasty! I'm not a 'tangy' person but did enjoy this. I didn't have the white so I used the regular balsamic. I used this vinaigrette with the Cucumber and Tomato Salad from this site which complemented it very well.

This is a recipe I have used for years.  It is a favorite.  I use the regular balamic vinegar, although I imagine the white balsamic would be great as well. I also add a bit of honey for sweetness.  My 13 year old loves this dressing.  It is the only way she eats salad. This is a keeper and always prepared and ready in my fridge. Try it with a romaine salad with almonds and dried cranberries. Yum!

Even with honey added, this dressing was a bit too tangy for me.  To me, it needs something to tone it down, I'm just not sure what.

This is a very tasty and simple vinaigrette dressing.  I also added a bit of sugar to it to take away some of the pucker, but it was delicious on my salad.  A keeper!

I used white balsamic raspberry blush vinegar and added some honey to offset the sourness. It was great with baby spinach! I'll definitely make this again.

I wanted a basic olive oil and vinegar dressing and this one is perfect.  I used regular balsamic because it is what I had on hand.  I did add 1 t. sugar, but I think this would have been great without it as well.

I thought this was pretty good.  I normally don't rate a recipe that I didn't have the original exact ingredients called for, but this time I will since it was close.  As other reviewers stated, I used the dark balsamic vinegar (as that's what I had on hand).  I also added a little honey.  Very tasty.  I think overall, though, our family prefers the Oriental Vinaigrette on this site.  Still a great recipe when you don't have the ingredients for that one.  Overall, quite tasty.

I thought this was very good. I added about 1 T of Grey Poupon Course Ground Mustard and 1 T of honey.  I halved the recipe as it makes alot.  I also used the dark balsamic vinegar.  Yummy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I really liked the salad dressing and I'm horribly picky about dressing.  I added sugar like some suggested and it was yummy.  It tasted like it might be missing a little something, but I'm not sure what.  At any rate I'll definately continue using it.
