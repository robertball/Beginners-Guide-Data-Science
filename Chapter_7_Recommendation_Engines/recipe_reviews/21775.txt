This is really a great recipe as is, but I like to experiment and have had some good results with both the original and my own modifications (friends pleading for recipe is a good sign!).  

I used two 8-oz. packages of mascarpone cheese, plus one  8 oz. package of cream cheese, 3/4 cup sugar, and several tablespoons of fresh lemon juice as modifications to the cream cheese mixture.  Also increased heavy cream to 2 cups.  Folded 1 1/2 bars (6 oz.) of shaved Ghirardelli white chocolate to the combined cream mixture as a last step in that process.
 
Omitted the cocoa dusting.

Fresh,homemade poundcake works best and is worth the time.  Used 1 1/2 loaves.

For raspberries, thawed and crushed (with juice) 1 1/2 10 oz. packages and mixed with approximately 1 cup of raspberry liqueur (Razzmataz).  Used this mixture to generously cover each pound cake layer.  It was more like a cold compote, but delicious.  

Used 1 pint of fresh raspberries (3 total) for each of the berry layers, saving about a dozen to garnish the top.

I just made this for a dinner party we're going to tonight and put some off to the side for my husband and I to try in case it didn't work out. I couldn't wait to write a review!  WOW!! We both loved it and it hasn't even set yet for the 4 hours in the refridgerator as suggested! 

 A couple of things I did:  I used 3, 8oz pkgs of cream cheese as others suggested and increased the sugar and other ingredients accordingly. I also used 2 cups heavy cream as other suggested. I used regular pound cake from the store and drizzled grand marnier over the slices. Instead of using cocoa, I used dark chocolate chunks sold in the baker's isle.  For the raspberries, I used 2, 12 oz frozen packages.  As they were thawing, I added about 1/4 cup of water so I would have more syrup to pour over the cake slices, and sprinkled the raspberries with sugar. On the top, I garnished with a couple of raspberries and dark chocolate chunks and then did sift just a little bit of cocoa on the top layer only.  YUMMY! And it looks fabulous in the trifle dish.  If the others at the party like it half as much as we did, it will be a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Instead of the cream cheese mixture, I used a large box of instant vanilla pudding to cream with the whipped cream mixture. I did dribble a little liquer on the angel food cake. The pudding made it real easy to make and my whole Mothers Day party was in awe. Very yummy and very easy and very fast to make.

Made this for our 4th of July party and it was a hit!  Prepared the recipe in an 8 x 11 casseroll dish and not a trifle bowl.  Decorated the top with fresh raspberries, blueberries and red colored sugar.  Will definitely be a regular at my house!

Oh my gosh! This recipe is so easy and tastes great! I used blueberries with the raspberries. Next time, I might do more of the cream cheese mixture. I was almost out by the time I got to the top layer. I had guys asking me for the recipe to give to their wives :)

I made this recipe and added layers of shaved chocolate.  I didn't use the cocoa as I was out.  It was very good!  Will definitely do again.

This is a very good and easy recipe. We have tons of raspberries growing in our back yard every year, and this gave me a new and tasty way of using them.

This was an awesome dessert! I served it to my board of directors and it was a huge hit. The raspberries were a little too tart, so I also sweetened them with a little sugar before adding them to the trifle. Yum!!

This was excellent.  I used angel food cake and added raspberry liquer and frozen blackberries with the frozen raspberries!  Big hit!

**one important note - LET THIS SIT OVERNIGHT so the cake absorbs the wet toppings, it is much better that way.**  i am the office baker, so i regularly bring things in for folks to try.  this recipe, however, blew everyone away.  they raved about this one.  the only change i made was to make more of the cream cheese/heavy cream mixture as other reviewers suggested.  it was wonderful!

This was WAY too sweet. I'm from a british background and I know my Nana would push her plate away after the first bite. If I do this again (which is doubtful), I would half the sugar in the cream cheese mixture and not sweeten the cream at all. Also, I would double the frozen berries. This trifle was very, very dry. In traditional trifle, the sponge cake is supposed to be saturated in liquid. A very dissapointing dessert.

I have made this a few times and it is great. The only change I make is to put good quality semi-sweet chocolate shavings in the layers and not use any cocoa powder, and added sugar to the raspberries as they were too tart. I put lots of big chocoate curls on top of the whipped cream that tops the trifle, it looks really nice, and the chocolate with the raspberry is sublime!

My family loves trifles.  This one is by far their favorite.  I shaved chocolate between the layers just as other reviewers had suggested.  I also used frozen raspberries and blackberries.  Will continue to make until the compliments stop... and I don't think that will be happening.

I made this for a birthday dinner and it was absolutely delicious!  I pretty much followed the recipe but made a few small tweaks (I usually do for all recipes) to kick up the flavor. I took the advice of a reviewer and added some sugar to the raspberries to reduce the tartness and added just a touch of cinnamon to give the flavor a little more depth.  I also added some lemon rinds to the cream cheese mixture because I wanted a stronger lemon flavor.  Instead of cocoa powder, I grated semisweet chocolate between the layers and made chocolate shavings to decorate the top.  It looked beautiful and I will definitely make again!

This recipe was very good and easy.  I will make it again, but I will probably use it as a summer desert.  I also think it would be great using fresh raspberries in season and some peach slices.  I also used angel food cake instead of pound cake as I like the lightness of the angel food cake as compared to heavy pound cake.  My husband said this was his favorite triffle though as compared to sweeter ones I make with chocolate.

I served this for dessert with Christmas dinner. I did use angel food cake instead of pound cake, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This was a huge hit and looked beautiful on the table. Easy to make, very tasty and beautiful presentation. I'll defenitely be making this one again.

I have made this for the last 7 Christmases. It is a big hit always.
 I use fresh raspberries and fresh lemon juice. I spread raspberry jam on pound cake, since I don't have juice from frozen fruit.

Excellent Recipe!! I have made it several times. I have used other fruit; blackbaerries, strawberries, with good results. Usually make more whiiped cream to use on top, I put it on right before serving and garnish with fruit.

The best trifle EVER!!!  I used a mix of berries which included raspberries... sweetened them, as recommended by others.  Also, used 2 C of heavy cream, so I had lots left over for the top.  Will make again!

I give this four because I think there is room for improvement but overall a GREAT recipe. I used two low fat cream cheese and a mascarpone cheese. Also, the pound cake freshly baked is a much better idea, it only takes a few minutes to mix it and it's worth the time. Made mine with 3 tubs of frozen strawberries and then used freshly sliced strawberries on top for decoration. I left the sugar as it stated since there was already additional sugar in frozen strawberries. (I would have used raspberries but strawberries are much cheaper here!)

This was a huge hit, although it was a bit dry.  Next time I'll add more raspberry juice to each layer of pound cake. Delicous!

Yes, this is the one!! Look no further. I made it for a bible study potluck in the fall and everyone raved.  We are having another one tomorrow and everyone said I had to make this again.  I changed it a little bit.  I used fresh raspberrys as well as frozen.  Also used fresh blueberries.  I added sm package vanilla instant pudding to the cream cheese mixture. Yum Yum.  Taste like the cream in Boston Cream Pie.  Very lite and tasty.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was a really tasty recipe, but it was too dry.  The fruit needs to go on the pound cake to moisten it up.  The layers should go: pound cake, fruit, cream cheese mixture.  Then it would be about perfect.

This is soooo good!  I have never made a trifle before and I'm so glad I chose this recipe for my first one!  I did add a little more heavy cream and I also added blackberries but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  My whole family loves it and I got rave reviews when I took it to a friend's house.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I made a few changes only because my son is not fond of sweetened cream cheese.  I used only one package of cream cheese and increased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Also left out the lemon juice.  Folded all the sweetened whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.  This made the filling very light and not to "cheesy" tasting.  I also suggest cutting the pound cake into thinner slices and overlapping them in order to make layers in a trifle dish.  I used frozen raspberries in a light syrup and they were just sweetened enough.  Also important to pour a little juice on each of the cake layers as per the recipe as this helps to break down the cake so it can absorb the filling.  I was only able to buy an orange pound cake at the store ... and it turned out great!  Orange and raspberry compliment each other beautifully.  Thanks for a great recipe that can be altered to suit individual tastes!

The presentation is wonderful; red and white layers. But this recipe lacked the complex flavors I would look for in a trifle.My guests seemed to enjoy it, but I don't believe its anything special.

This is the best trifle I have ever had.  I alternated raspberries and nectarines, and I also alternated custard and the whipped cream/cream cheese.  Just heavenly!

Incredible! A little more work than instant pudding, but so much worth it. I would recommend wiping the inside of the bowl between layers so you can see the layers of fruit through the glass, otherwise the cream covers up the look. Enjoy!

I like to rate recipes as they're written  As is, this is an ok starter.  But should definitely be tweaked as several reviewers suggested and increase the cream cheese mixture.  Also, the only frozen raspberries available to me at time of making this had no sugar added.  I definitely would say that they needed sugar.

Just made this for my raspberry lovin daughters birthday. Hubby loved it, daughter - not so much. I took into consideration all of the suggestions given by other reviews.  I doubled everything, soaked the rasberries overnight after sprinkling with sugar and sprinkled the cake with the raspberry juice. Overall it was a good dessert. However, next time I will add much more sugar to the raspberries, soak the pound cake in more raspberry juice, still use more of the cream cheese filling than the recipe suggests but not as much as double and I will still double the whip cream and berries. Also, will probably use a mixure of berries, not just raspberries.

Huge hit! I brought this dessert to a large party and everyone raved and went back for seconds.  I thought it was easy to make. I used angel food cake instead of pound cake and used bittersweet chocolate shavings instead of cocoa powder.  If you drizzle the berry juice on the angel food cake it won't be soggy if served within 6 hours but after that it got soggy.  Next time I may not drizzle the juice on the cake layer. I will definitely make this again and again! Thanks!

I made this recipe for a work function and it went over well not great.  I did make some changes - I used two frozen Sarah Lee pound cakes, I also chopped two chocolate bars and sprinkled on top of the cream cheese layers. Next time I think I would use three blocks of cream cheese and add a little more sugar to compensate as I ran low on the cream cheese mixture.  Also instead of lemon juice I added some Grand Marnier as orange would go well with the rasberries and choclate I added.

I reduced the serving size to 9 servings and the calculations on the ingredients side changed, but the directions on the recipe side, didn't.  I just wasted two cups of sugar and cream, but I'm glad I caught that. Instead of raspberries, I used strawberries, cut up lengthwise. I put the '9 servings' into 5 champagne glasses and it was beautiful!  Topped it with a whole strawberry and used peppermint cocoa powder from Starbucks.  You could barely taste the cocoa, though.  I didn't think it would taste that great, because I'm not a big fan of pound cake, but after keeping it in the fridge for four hours and after having everything stiffen up, my guests were so impressed... I was VERY impressed!  It was so delicious!  I was sad that I couldn't have seconds and I'm sure others were, too.  Thank you so much for sharing the wonderful recipe.  God bless!

This was really yummy, and everyone really enjoyed it. I took others' advice and added strawberries, and I'm glad I did.  Next time I make it I would use less of the cream cheese mixture, and add a layer of just plain Cool Whip on top of the cream cheese.

As is, I thought this recipe was a bit lacking. But after I tweeked it to fit my tastes, it worked out wonderfully. I added Hershey's chocolate to the cream mixture & replaced the frozen raspberries with fresh ones in between the layers of cream & cake instead of on the pound cake. Finished it with the extra whipped cream & more raspberries. It was a nice finish to our holiday meal.

Excellent recipe. A very cool and refreshing dessert after a meal. I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese to cut back the fat and used a combo of raspberries and blackberries. I also followed another reviewers advice and put a little Grand Mariner on the pound cake slices.

I loved this recipe and so did the family. Made this for a BBQ last year and now everyone asks me to bring one wherever I go!
I had made some changes I used lady fingers instead of pound cake, and drenched them in rum instead of frozen raspberry juice which added a little more depth. I also used half fresh and half frozen raspberries. Awesome recipe.

Easy and excellent!  I made this for my husband's work potluck.  They all loved it!  I used only frozen strawberries, and used light cream cheese, but it was a big hit.  I only wish I would have sent the recipe along with it, thus eliminating the step of having to send it along the next day due to numerous requests.

Absolutely delicious. I mixed blueberries and raspberries.  Forgot to put the whipped cream in the fridge so it went flat when I wanted it later. However I had canned whipped cream so not a disaster. Recommend highly....Suggest you use lots of cake because the juice increases the longer you leave it sitting in the fridge...

I loved this recipe.  I made some modifications based on the fruit I had on hand and some of the other reader suggestions.  I used fresh raspberries and put them in some water and sugar so that it would reduce the tartness.  I also used fresh mango and strawberries.  For the filling, I used the cream cheese mixture and added vanilla pudding so that it was a little lighter.    I also subbed angel food cake for the pound cake.  The trifle was a hit with the family.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  Very easy and tastes light and refreshing.  I used fresh raspberries along with a raspberry angel food cake I got from the market.  It's a very forgiving flexible recipe.  Everyone enjoyed it and went back for seconds.

Made this for a dessert on the weekend.  It was really nice.  The only changes I made was I used fresh raspberries in the trifle itself...the frozen raspberries I crushed and used the juice to soak the pound cake....I mixed in some rum with the juice as well.  It was for adults only.

DELICIOUS!!! This was super easy(i was a little scared because the sugar/whipped topping mixture wasn't getting real thick (peaks) but it still turned out fantastic after 4 hrs in fridge). Was sweet, but not over whelming as long as you have a small serving. My guests raved over this---will be making for many events to come I'm sure. Have used angle food cake, which is a perfect mix with the berries & less calories. Many Thanks!

This raspberry trifle was divine.  I had an excess of fresh red raspberries on hand, so I tried this recipe & the molten choco cakes w/ fresh raspberries (also delightful).  The only changes I made were to substitute angelfood cake instead of pound cake - since this was already made at the store & I felt like skipping the baking - and also I used 2 cups heavy whip instead of 1 1/2.  Can you ever really have too much???  I will make this again next year when berry season rolls around.

Really yummy. I used all fresh berries though...rasberries, blackberries, and some blueberries. Instead of cocoa, I used a premium dark chocolate bar (70% cocoa)and grated it over the layers. I froze the bar first, and placed it back in the frezer between working on the layers (so it didn't get soft and stop grating).
Really yummy.

This was delious. Kind of a lot of work, though. I added 1/4 C water to the raspberries as they thawed to create more juice & sweetened the raspeberries with some sugar. I used 3 pkg of cream cheese & an extra 1/4 C sugar since others said they didn't have enough cream cheese mixture. I used an angel food cake instead of pound cake. Instead of cocoa powder, I followed others suggestion & froze a Hershey's bar & grated it but it started to melt quick so I couldn't grate much. My husband made all the layers & did an excellent job. It turned out so great. Thanks Bonnie!

Excellent trifle recipe!  I made it with angel food cake and mixed all the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture because I'm not overly fond of cream cheese.  The trifle was lovely, garnered positive reviews from all my guests, and the pickiest member in the family (who hates trying new things) even asked for second helpings.  A five star recipe!

Excellent dessert!!  Made this for Father's Day BBQ and it was a big hit by everyone. I used strawberries as others had suggested, fresh ones that I added a little sugar and let them sit in the fridge...this created a litte sauce that I drizzled over the cake. I did not have cocco powder so I sprinkled the top with fine crushed walnuts!! Looked awesome and gave it a great taste.  Will definitly make again!! Thanks Bonnie!!

I made this trifle for the first time for a party. This is a fabulous dessert! People went back for seconds and thirds. I poured (not drowned) cream sherry over the cake slices which is what the tradition English trifle recipe calls for. I will make this again and again!

The Raspberry Trifle was very good. I served it in individual cup and it looked very fancy. Yes the raspberries were very tart so I would suggest blueberries(that is what I am going to try next time) or just not serving it to children. I did have to use store baught whipped cream since my blender was not working and it turned out very yummy. This overall was Fresh and creamy!

Excellent recipe - got rave reviews.  I made this in wine glasses and it looked very special.  Added a sprig of mint on top as a garnish.  To cut on calories, next time I will substitute angelfood cake, splenda, and fat free cool whip - and I'm sure the results will be very delicious!

This trifle was okay. The raspberries are very tart. Maybe sweetened frozen raspberries would be better. Like another reviewer said, this recipe has good intentions. I too think it would be wonderful with strawberries. You need to be a fan of raspberries to enjoy.

this trifle was fantastic! i used 2 pints of fresh sliced strawberries based upon another reviewer's suggestion. sprinkled sugar on the strawberries and let them sit for a while as it made a nice syrup. i also used angel food cake instead of the pound cake. it all made for a great strawberry shortcake that was delicious and beautiful!

Not good. I followed the recipe exactly. The frozan raspberries were not a good flavor in this and the poundcake was dull. I would recommend using your choice of fresh fruit and using angel food cake if you are going to try this...

I made this recipe for a party and it was a huge success.  I made a few changes though.  I used a box yellow cake, mixed berries and a shredded Hershey bar.  I'll definitely make this again.

I made this last night for a ladies church meeting.  It went over so well.  I made another trifle from the site and this went before the other one.  It was a nice combination of flavors.  I did add some sugar to the raspberries and chocolate shavings instead of cocoa.  It was wonderful!  I will use it over and over again!  Thanks so much!!!

Everyone raved about this, but I slightly changed it. I used cool whip and I made a yellow cake. I mixed together 1/2 cup boiling water with 1 packet(3 oz) of raspberry jello, and 1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam and spread it onto the cake with a pastry brush than cake than I cut it into cubes. I used fresh raspberries from my garden and mixed in a few strawberries. Makes a lot   Yummmmm!

This was a good basic recipe, but we thought it was lacking something. Next time, I think I'll drizzle the pound cake with orange juice or amaretto - just something to give it a little kick. I thought the raspberries were a bit tart as well, so next time I'll add a bit of sugar to them or try the recipe using strawberries or even peaches with sugar and cinnamon. The pound cake seemed a little heavy. I like the idea of using angel food cake like other reviewers suggested. This is the kind of recipe that's fun to experiment with. We'll try different combinations until we find a favorite.

This was okay, I think it needs to be a little sweeter, the raspberries may have been too tart. I would probably add a little more sugar to the cream cheese mixture.

EXCELLENT....almost like a cheesecake trifle. What better combo could exist.  I used strawberries and angel food cake instead...but great! Everyone loved it. No better way to use fresh fruit than a trifle...and this was excellent.

This is the best dessert I've ever made or ate! I made it for treats for our team meeting at work and it was an absolute hit. I ended up using a 9X13 inch baking dish, and it still turned out great. The package of pound cake I bought was 16 oz. and the raspberries came in 12 oz. packages. I used all of both. I also whipped all of the cream since I needed more to cover the whole top of the dish. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I served this at a dinner party last night and it was a hit. Even my husband who has never liked raspberries loved it. I followed the recipe as written except for adding a few fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint for garnish. It is so beautiful in the trifle dish you will get alot of WOW's when you serve this.

I will make this again and again for company just because I love all the compliments I get on it.  The taste is not only wonderful but the presentation (in a trifle bowl) makes everyone think I am such a gourmet cook when in fact it was so easy to prepare.  The leftovers weren't as good but I only had leftovers on the night I made it for just me and my husband! Thanks

This is wonderful and easy.  Being a little on the weight conscious side I used angel food cake instead of pound cake and used low fat cream cheese - worked great.  Can even change fruits especially if you can't find raspberries in the frozen food section.  GREAT!!!!

I made this for 15 woman who all loved the trifle and wanted the recipe.  I brused Gand Marnier on the slices of pound cake to "dress" it up a little.  I will make this again for sure.  Great recipe for entertaining.

This is now my favorite dessert.  Every bite was heaven!!!!!!! I poured a little bit of raspberry liquor on the pound cake.  It made the dessert even better.

I made this and everyone LOVED it.  Three people asked me for the recipe.  I am a NOVICE cook, and I'm hoping someone can give me feedback on what I may have done wrong.  The cream cheese and whip topping mixture was not enough....so I ended uop having to go out and get more.  It turned out fine, but I'm sure it had TONS more calories! Just wondering if I need to make it thinner or something.

Yummy! I added some vanilla pudding as per another reviewer. Everyone loved it. I personally did not like the cream cheese in it. I would use half the amt. next time. I also added some blackberry's to it and used homemade pound cake.. It was super easy to make. I would make it again.

This is such an awesome dessert.  I had a great time making it and eating it.  I made my own pound cake (grandmothers pound cake II) also used 2 quarts of fresh respberries sprinkled with a 1/3 c sugar and threw in some fresh blueberries.

Awsome! I did like it a little better with angel food cake. (cut in small chunks) It was a bit lighter. i also did it in individual mini trifles for a dessert table.  RAVES!!

Ok, this was really great...Made a double batch with fresh strawberries and blueberries soaked for a while in creme de cassis and a sprinkling of sugar, used two containers of mascarpone to one neufchatel and topped with white chocolate shaving.  Lovely to look at and delicious, to; a school gathering devoured both of them today.  Many happy people!!

This was quite delicious and definitely pleased my guests.  Next time, I would use a little less cream cheese because that taste was a bit too prominent.    I'd make this again.

I made this for an anniversary dinner. My boyfriend is a huge raspberry lover, he really appreciated it. The whipped cream was just perfect and I found myself making more later to eat with leftover trifle.
I should say that the amount of cake you will get from this recipe is way more than you will eat after a two-person dinner. I say cut it in half for a cute medium cake and minimal leftovers.

This is incredibly good as is. I have done minor things to change this a few times I have made it and it was really good...such as different berries, orange marmalade on the pound cake, etc. Delicious!

This was delicious! I made it with a bag of frozen mixed berries, Sara Lee frozen pound cake, light cream cheese and fat free whipped topping. Next time I will try Angel food cake, like others suggested. I tried to make it lower cal/fat and it was still great!

I made this for my mom's early Mother's Day dinner. It was excellent. My husband said it was "Resturant quality." I forgot to get two bags of raspberries and used some fresh sliced strawberries with one bag of raspberries and it turned out good. I finished the last bit of it last night. WILL be making this again!

Yummy!!! We made 3 trifles for a big party and I have to say this was my favorite. Everyone liked it.
We used fresh blackberries since they were on sale that day. :) and mashed a few of them to use for the juice. Delicious!

I wasn't going to make this recipe because of the cream cheese but I took another reviewer's idea and substituted mascarpone.  I also omitted the lemon juice.  It made a nice summer dessert.

This was really, really good.  Reminded me of a cross between a cheesecake and berry shortcake.  I made it for Easter Sunday and my husband had finished it by Monday evening.  I added fresh, dark chocolate dipped raspberries to the top for garnish.

It was REALLY cheesy - more like a cheescake texture, so if that's what you're going for then you will love this!  I am used to traditional trifle so for me it was a bit rich, but my family loved it!

I modified this recipe slightly to work with what I had on hand.  I used one package of raspberries, one of strawberries.  I used one cup of heavy cream.  I didn't seperate the berries from the juice, I did cake, berries and juice, and cream cheese mixture as my layers.  I was thinking a little grand marnier or amaretto splashed on the cake layers could be quite tasty as well.  I'm going to try that next time!

VERY GOOD! I didnt think this would turn out good because I used angel food cake instead of the pound cake (I couldnt find it) but all of my friends loved it and begged me to make it again, it made alot but it all finished. I did use a mixture of berries(raspberry, blackberry, blueberry and strawberry) and they were all fresh, but any would work I'm sure! Overall great recipe and will make again.

This recipe is GREAT!  I made it for an open house.  I did substitute angel food cake for the pound cake, and instead of using cocoa powder- I grated semi-sweet chocolate.  I used Birds-Eye frozen raspberries in light syrup.  The mix of flavors with the raspberry and semi-sweet chocolate- and the real whipped cream- cream cheese- it was so light and flavorful.  I had several guests request the recipe- I will definitely make again!!

My granddaughter and I had a great time making this. It was a big hit at a family gathering, everyone enjoyed it. The only change we made was to use 10 ounces of raspberries and about 16 ounces of strawberries.

I have never made a trifle before this and it was so easy. This trifle was sweet and rich. I made it for a work function and had many, many compliments on it. THanks!

I made this for a New Year's party.  It was a big hit!  I made a few changes due to lack of ingredients on hand, but I think it would have been just fine as written.  My changes were to use a prepared yellow cake mix, mixed berries sweetened with a bit of sugar, and grated dark chocolate instead of cocoa.

My tip would be to make sure the cream cheese is good and soft, or folding in the cream will be a challenge.  Also, this is very simple, but it does take awhile to put together, so start plenty early.

This was pretty  good for my first attempt at making trifle.  Was also my first attempt at using cream cheese as I'm not particularly fond of it.  But this turned out real good.  My partners scoffing it down as I type and the only complaint is that I got the cocoa a bit thick in some places.  Only changes were I added more sugar, used strawberries as I didn't have any raspberries on hand, and I soaked the sponge in a little raspberry jello before it was set.  The only other thing I'd like to change is the cream cheese layer as I can still taste this too much, but that's only 'cos I'm not a big fan of it.  Thanks for the great recipe Bonnie :)

Wonderful! I made it for a party, and have had several requests to bring it to other gatherings.  I made a white cake from a mix & used it instead of pound cake...more trouble, but worth it, I think!

Yuuuuummm-eeeee! Very very good! I used Splenda instead of Sugar, used "Reduced Fat" Cream Cheese, and Angel Food cake instead of Pound cake. It's alot lighter and not so buttery. Next time I may use another "berry" along with the raspberry. Very good! Great raves from my company.

Light, not-too-sweet, crowd pleasing dessert.  The raspberries add a nice contrast from the white filling and the cocoa adds a little zing.  I ended up adding a little to much raspberry juice and the pound cake was a bit soggy.  Everyone still loved it though!

Easy to make and very delicious!   We used fresh raspberries and mashed up about 1½ cups to get some juice happening. After  that we followed the recipe as written and it came out...  Perfect!  I ended up forwarding this recipe to a friend who really enjoyed this dessert.

I increased the quantity to two cups of heavy cream and kept the sugar measurement the same. I used angel food cake instead of pound cake and  fresh blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in the layers rather than frozen.  A light, tasty dessert which is quite versatile.

I have made this literally for the entire decade it's been posted on AllRecipes. It's a great holiday favorite, and I use our prize-winning chocolate cake recipe to make the cake portion instead of pound cake. Rave reviews from guests. It always looks like the most beautiful thing on the table and garners "ohh" and "ahh" every time. You can't go wrong with this one. I have also used leftover birthday or wedding cake in the past that had  or had not been frozen. You'd never know.

This was excellent and easy to make.  I didn't have a pound cake so I used a peach bundt cake.  The cinnamon topping on the cake added a nice touch.

I used angel food cake instead of pound cake. I think it gives it a lighter feel. I also used fresh raspberries that I sugared early so they would juice up. That was a great choice too.

On a 100 degree summer day when you're having a bunch of people over for a barbecue and you want something impressive that doesn't require the oven, this is the thing.  I made this exactly according to the recipe except I used fresh raspberries (well actually, the recipe didn't mention layering the pound cake after the initial mention of the bottom layer, so I messed that up a little before looking to my left and noticing all the cake I was neglecting).  It looked beautiful in my trifle bowl, and  I'll definitely make it again.

Very sweet.....cut sugar in cream cheese layer down and use only 1/2 of sugar in whipped cream.  Otherwise, very good.

I had some leftover chocolate cake I wanted to use up, so decided on this recipe. I made it in a 9x9 inch glass pan with only one layer of each (cake, cream, raspberries and whipping cream on top). It turned out fine, although I had to make more whipping cream than in the recipe. Also, I found the cream cheese too rich for our family, so will reduce it next time or use marscapone cheese instead. Also, I will moisten the cake more. Over all, it's a great way of using up leftover cake. It reminds me a bit of Tiramisu. Will definitely make again.

This was delicious!  I used a variety of fresh berries (blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, etc) as they were on sale.  I did not add the chocolate; but followed the rest of the recipe....very good.  Everyone wants me to make it again soon!  Since I did not use the frozen berries, mine was probably a little dry compared to the original; if you wanted, I am sure you can make a little syrup or juice to mix the berries in before adding them.  We did not and still enjoyed it.

This was so good.  I didn't think it was dry at all, just need to make sure you use all of the juice of the berries.  I left out the cocoa as I didn't have any and it was still very good.  A keeper!

substituted angel food cake, used frozen blackberries, raspberries,strawberries, which i mixed with some berry jam and a bit of water...used the immersion blender to make it less chunky...used 3 low fat cream cheese, and pint of heavy cream, less sugar in the heavy cream/cream cheese mixture...made it the night before i needed it....it was great, you can modify as needed...i messed up and got too much cocoa in one spot, but other than that we loved it!!

this was just ok for me....but i did change it so maybe it was my own fault. I could not find pound cake so i substituted a fruit pound cake. It was very moist and flavorful. I just had a hard time getting the cream cheese mixture to spread and my barries did not make much liquid. I served it at a church function for women and everyone said they loved it but for me it was just so so. Thanks for sharing. Great idea. I may try again!

This was delicious!  Several reviews mentioned they sprinkled the raspberries with sugar so they wouldn't be as tart.  I'm glad I didn't take that advise, because I  thought the tartness of the raspberries went great with the sweetness of the cream mixture and cake.  Wonderful recipe!

Very good and super simple to make.  The frozen raspberries were a little tart, so maybe next time I will sprinkly them with sugar.  I might add some liquer next time to soak the pound cake.

Wow, this was delicious! Only thing is I ended up making way more than I expected (my fault). I used individual glass cups (as per my picture) opposed to one big dish, and it turned out great! I also used 95% less fat cream cheese to lower the ridiculously high fat content a little and it still tasted great.

I recently made this recipe for my in-laws and it was a huge hit.  They were very impressed.  I made my own pound cake as I didn't want to run back to the store.  Thanks for the great recipe.

MMMMMMM!!  Yummy...I think that this recipe is hard to make look pretty.  I couldn't tell the difference in the layers; but the taste of each layer is really good.  However, I did use frozen thawed mixed berries; they were a lot less expensive in the grocery store compared to just frozen raspberries.

I confess I was really hesitant about using a whole pound of cream cheese.  I thought it would be too rich, but it wasn't.  This was my first trifle.  I followed the recipe exactly and everybody really liked it.  Also, it kept really well in the fridge for several days without getting soggy.  I'm looking forward to trying it with other berries, such as boysen/marion/loganberries.

I did make some changes - but just because we live out in the hills and I did not have all the ingredients!  I substituted angel food cake for the pound cake and fresh raspberries for frozen.  Because the berries were fresh, I did not have the required juice SOOOO I just had to substitute lemoncello and boy was it ever yum! This recipe would be great both ways I am sure.  Thank you Bonnie - it was just lovely...if I could double the stars I would.

I used mixed berry frozen fruit instead of the raspbery (only b/c raspberry wasn't available). It was wonderful! It was a big hit at my Christmas dinner. Will definitely make again!

This was the first trifle that I've ever made (in my new trifle bowl and really ever!) and I made it for my mom's surprise birthday party.  It was so yummy and fresh and just light enough after munching a lot.  It fed over a dozen people and everyone commented on how nice and looked and how good it was.  Great light desert after a heavy meal!

Made this for a small dinner party and wasn't too impressed with the flavor.  The kids at the party were oohing and ahhing when they saw it but just moved it around the plate instead of actually eating it.  Wouldn't make it again.

This was very good, but I'm stingy with 5 star ratings.  I used dessert cakes and a bag of frozen mixed berries.  I poured a bit of water and a bit of chambord over the berries.  This made a great sauce to drizzle over the cakes.  I need to work a bit on my presentation, but the dessert itself turned out delicious.

This was great, and I have had many requests for the recipe.

I used sugar cookies instead of pound cake (because I had some dough already made) and frozen blackberries because they were cheaper!  :)

Also omitted the cocoa - it was sooooo good!  Thanks!

FABULOUS RECIPE!  I have made this for two parties so far and it has received nothing but rave reviews each time.  Please note that you won't have any leftovers . . . just an empty trifle bowl. . .  so you better save yourself a piece if you'd like seconds.

Good, but the raspberries make it a bit tart.  I may try soaking the raspberries in sugar overnight first.

This is an elegant dessert to bring to a party! I brought it to two baby showers and got rave reviews. Great presentation in a trifle bowl. I substituted cool whip topping for the heaving whipping cream and sugar--just too much work. The last time I made it I had to use strawberries and it was not as good. Also, this serves a lot of people.

Fabulous!!  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception that I could only find mixed fruit bags when I was shopping... So I used that and shredded Hershey bars for the chocolate element.  This will be a repeat performer at all our parties!!

I made this for my family and they all loved it. I also used yellowcake after reading other reviews and i used blueberries and strawberries. I also added a fourth cup more of sugar to the cream cheese mixture. It was amazing, I will definately make again.

I was just OK. I wasn't crazy about it, but my guests really seemed to like it. I used angel food cake like the others said, and mixed berries. I don't think I'll make this again.

Absolutely amazing.  I'll definitely make this again.  I used angel food cake in place of pound cake (after reading other reviews).  I layered with raspberries, blueberries and strawberries to keep with the patriotic theme of our fourth of July party.  My last layer was a layer of whipped cream and I created a flag design on the top using blueberries and raspberries.  It was a hit!  Next time I may use 3 packages of cream cheese--the glass bowl I used must have been very wide and I had to layer it very thinly so I'd have enough.  Used lowfat cream cheese and Splenda.  Spectacular!!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was a hit!  I brought it to a get together and everyone just raved over it.  It was so light and not too sweet, just perfect.  The BEST part is that it was soo easy to make and all the ingredients were readily available.  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe has good intentions.  I wonder if just sweetened whipped cream would be better.  Also, a flavored pound cake like lemon would be good.  I'll try again!

Pretty tasty, but the pound cake did not absorb the other ingredients as expected.  The cake is probably too dense.  Maybe i will try yellow cake next time.  Otherwise it was a pretty good dessert and a big hit with my brother.

I thought this was a good trifle but the raspberries were a little tart.  Next time I would sweeten the raspberries.

This dessert was AMAZING! So good, my boyfriend's family could not stop raving! I served it after dinner at a fancy restaurant and even the waitstaff wanted some! I am making this again today for 4th of July picnic and am adding blueberries to give it a patriotic look.

I loved this recipe and so did my family!  The raspberries were a little tart so the next time I made it I used frozen blueberries.  It turned out perfect! I've made this several times and with a family of five, it's gone within two days!

I really changed this recipe due to my dietary restrictions and what was at my local market at the time. I used the basic recipe, but used the following substitutions:
Used fresh strawberries, splenda instead of sugar, Enttenmann's sugar free pound cake. I used sugar free strawberry jam and made sandwiches of the cake, then layered. I also sprinkled the cake layers with rum. Yum!

I was very pleased with the results of this recipe.  It was fairly simple and made a nice presentation and best of all, it tasted good.  I did add the grand marnier as suggested in prior reviews and thankfully I had it on hand.  Would highly recommend.  I invited soem friends for cocktails and dessert last night and we all enjoyed it- as well as the pina coladas I made for the first time(used recipe from coco lopez cream of coco can)  But I suppose this dessert would go best with wine.

I made this as alternative to cookies post-Christmas dinner. It was delicious. In fact, I was forced to give the recipe to three of my aunts before they left! The filling + raspberries essentially taste like raspberry cheesecake-- only better. Also, I just used Entemann's (sp?) yellow pound cake and it worked wonderfully.

Very pretty! I did brush the cake with Grand Marnier as others have. I will probably experiment with other booze-Godiva Liqour maybe? Baileys? Anyway this was great for the holidays, and I found using frozen berries was just as good (and cheaper) than fresh.

Wonderful! There was a contrast in taste, from the raspberries to the sweetened cream cheese, that WOWed everyone! 
My cake also turned a bit soggy, so I would recommend either serving it immediately or puddling some juice around the base of the cake as you serve it.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe that I made for a women's group meeting.  The presentation was lovely and the taste met everyone's expectations!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I've made this dessert twice now and each time have been asked to make it again.  Since I had trouble finding ready-made pound cake at the market, I substituted angel food cake, which was very light and delicious!

This was quick (although I made my own pound cake), easy and delicious and really not too caloric considering how rich it is.  I used light cream cheese and light Cool Whip (instead of the real whipped cream).

Excellent and easy to prepare. Even better the next day as the flavors soaked in.
