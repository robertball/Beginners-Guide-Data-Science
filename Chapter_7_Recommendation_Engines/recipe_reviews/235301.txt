I think this is a recipe for loaded mashed potatoes, not twice-baked potatoes as the picture suggests. Sounds good though, but I want to make what is in the picture - which also has green onions.

Absolutely delicious! I threw it in the crock pot on low for a dinner party & they stayed nice & creamy even after a couple of hours. Will definitely make this again!

My family gobbled the entire 9x13 dish of these in one evening (is that a good thing?  lol)  Needless to say, they were delicious.  I admit I added broccoli to ours, we always do when making loaded potatoes.  Thanks for sharing.  Next time I will consider caramelizing some onions first rather than just adding them raw.
