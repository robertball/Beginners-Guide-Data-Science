This recipe for mincemeat is absolutely scrumptious!!!  The only problem I found is that it needed more sugar.  I made a batch and froze it in Ziplock freezer bags, and it was even more delicious half a year later!  Two thumbs-up!!!

This is about ten years later, and I just made this recipe again.  I'm putting it in FoodSaver bags now and vacuum sealing it.  It's SO GOOD!!!  Now that my kids are older, I'll be keeping this in the freezer each year!  I just measure about four cups of mincemeat and put it in a FoodSaver bag and freeze it.  One recipe makes almost 5 four-cup bags.  Delicious!  Yum!!

Way better than store bought mincemeat. I made some changes, though. First, I used beef rather than pork. Next, I could not find gooseberries so used dried currants that I plumped up in hot water before using. Also, I only used the zest of the lemon & used only the zest & juice of the orange. I got 5 quarts & 1 pint out of this recipe. Very good to make Mincemeat Bars which is a recipe on this website. Labor intensive, but well worth it if you like mincemeat.

This recipe is nothing like the canned mincemeat you buy in a store! I used venison and did a quarter of the amount of the recipe to test it. Exotic flavor! Yum! --Ginny Carol

While I am sure the recipe tastes fantastic, it is not safe to can in a waterbath. Any meats need to be pressure canned. I would not recommend processing this recipe in the manner described.

My grandparents never canned it. They put this in a crock and let it age with boubon and brandy. They made it in October and let it "marry" until the holidays.

This is very similar to my recipe from my grandmother (born in 1899).  It is a Christmas tradition at my house.  My husband and all four sons and their families look forward to Mincemeat pies each holiday season.  I don't think Christmas is the same without them!

Delicious! Next time I make it I will use slightly less vinegar and slightly more sugar, but that might be because I used fresh sour cherries (perhaps they are more sour than canned???).

I never had mincemeat before, got curious a few days ago and decided to try this recipe for the holidays...GREAT IDEA!!! It is absolutely delicious!! I only gave the recipe 4 stars becuz I'm not sure how it would taste with the pork, being that i used all beef in my version!
