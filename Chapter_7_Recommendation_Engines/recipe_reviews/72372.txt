So we made this sandwich, but with a LOT of twists on it! We added chicken breasts, roasted red pepper instead of using canned red pepper, nixed the lettuce and pickle, and put it on ciabatta bread. It was awesome this way!

It didn't taste at all like anything fresh and though I'm a huge cheese fan, I don't think this sandwich bests showcases the cheeses used.

I love the mayo and ranch mixed together, and overall, quite a unique sandwich. Thanks!
