Family-favorite Spaghetti Pie Haiku: "I am sorry Hunts, I do love your tomatoes, not this recipe." Yawn, this was really tame. The spaghetti "crust" was pretty tasty, especially up and around the edges of the pie pan where it got a little crispy, but the meat filling was just soooo boring, and I'd even added chopped orange bell pepper, garlic and onions to the meat as it browned b/c the only thing called for to mix w/ it was the can of tomato sauce. Sorry for the disappointing review, but this really could've benefited from some Italian seasoning and maybe a flavorful spaghetti sauce instead of regular tomato sauce. As we were finishing it up (and there are leftovers, but nobody's interested), we agreed that just eating a regular plate of spaghetti w/ meat sauce and parmesan would've been way easier and made our bellies content.
