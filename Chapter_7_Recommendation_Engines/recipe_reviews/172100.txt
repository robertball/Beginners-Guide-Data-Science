At first I thought this doesn't looks so good, and I waited while my husband took the first bite.  He loved it and wanted me to make more!  I think it is one of his favorites now.  The serving size is perfect with a small side.  Great recipe for just the two of us.  It was so easy and great to make after a long day at work.  Thank you.

I rocked this recipe with uber lean ground turkey, instead of the white bread... I used the heal of some wheat bread, and a couple of texas toast garlic crutons...I was outta green onions...so I used some french onion soup mix (just a pinch or so) which really popped this recipe... tasted great no lardy or greasy sludge with the use of ground turkey... this was so much fun and really easy...the best part I ate it right outta the mug...and it was really cold out so the mug warmed up my oh-so-frozen hands.  THANK YOU

The texture to this loaf is not the same as when it is in the oven, while it had good flavor I didn't care for the texture.  I probably will not make it again.

This is a quick and easy recipe for meatloaf.  I adjusted it for a pound of ground turkey, and it worked well in 4 mugs (with some additional cooking time).  I also added some spinach a green kick.  Thanks!

Really good, but I made a lot of changes to make it healthier, such as using multigrain instead of white bread and making it in a muffin tin instead of a mug. I also used less milk and one more small egg. In the future though, I would probably add more bread or use leaner meat to reduce the amount of lardy residue that came out afterwards.

This was a fantastic way to make meatloaf. With three kids under the age of 5 I love recipes that are quick and still resemble a real meal. I did make a few changes like adding thyme and basil. I also like my meatloaf with bread crumbs instead of white bread. In the end I would totally make this again.

Thank you for this recipe!  No, it doesn't have the same taste or texture as if you bake it--but the point is you don't have time to bake it and you have some thawed hamburger in the fridge or maybe you don't need a whole meatloaf.  I doubled the recipe, adding some grated carrot, made two mini loaves and cooked on a microwave safe plate.  My son gobbled it up.

Fast, easy and great taste.  We don't eat white bread, so I substituted wheat bread in one mug and rye bread in one mug.  Both were excellent.  Also used a Tbsp. of regular sweet onion in place of the green onion.

This is great! Like most  reviews, I adjusted some spices to my liking/availability. It's like eating a home cooked meal without waiting. I was nervous about cooking ground beef in the microwave but it turned out ok, I used 4:30 minutes and it was plenty. A great dinner when in a time crunch!

This is a blessing if you're single or just want a smaller portion of meatloaf.  I added onion powder and extra worchester to mine and then cooked it a little longer to get that burnt crispy bit that all meat loaf should have.  Can't call it the best meat loaf I've ever had, but it's the best meat loaf out of the microwave.

Who would think this would work?  Meatloaf - in the microwave?  But it works just as described and was very good!  I cooked mine for 6 minutes - just to be safe.  And I think you could use any meatloaf recipe (I have a personal favorite I will try next time) and it would work just as well.  Thanks for a brilliant idea for a FAST and yummy dinner!

It was very easy to make but we all thought it was bland. Had to use a lot of ketchup to get flavor. And I followed this recipe exactly as written.

I tried this recipe twice, and both times I was impressed by the flavor, but the process was unappetizing, as was the remaining fat in the mug. I will not make it again, though I think it is a really good idea.

Good, but not great. Good enough that I'll make it again and try to get it to come out more "traditional." Thanks for submitting it!

I haven't found many meatloaf recipes that I like, but this is not only fast and easy, it tastes great!!  My husband loves it too.  It's perfect for just the two of us.

What a great idea!  I tweaked the recipe, so this review is for the technique. It made a delicious mini-meatloaf. However, I had to microwave it for closer to 10-11 minutes and the bottom burnt a little while the middle was still pink. Perhaps I will flip it next time.

Was very good and very easy.  The only change I made was to use ground turkey instead of ground beer.  The next time I make it I will add some red pepper and some bacon.

My husband loves meatloaf. I decided to try this recipe, mainly because it's quick. I made this a few days ago, and as usual I did not follow the recipe. LOL My husband says that's why he's a better cook than I am. :-) I initially mixed everything together, then realized that I was supposed to soak the bread with the worcheshire and milk. Since I put the bread in last, I plucked it out and put the worchesthire and milk on the bread. Essentially, I ended up doubling the amount of both those items.  I had to cook it longer than the recipe stated because even though most of the meat was cooked, the top was still raw. I ended up flipping the meat over and cooking it for an additional 2 minutes. It was a hit at my home. I liked this so much, I emailed the link to my sisters and Mom. Everyone should have a quick meatloaf recipe and this one was moist and flavorful. I know this one will be on my 10 day rotation.

Amazing!  Who knew?!  I topped mine off with a squeeze of ketchup and it made my night!  This simple recipe can be customized for any taste.  I've tried it several times and added a little crushed red pepper flakes, or some minced white onion.

Quick and easy enough but a very greasy final product! If you forget just one of the ingredients be prepared to have a horrible outcome so pay attention to what you are doing. An easy meal to prepare for my ill father in a pinch and a wonderful looking product if you actually plate it but I prefer the more complicated version if I have to eat it at all.

So fast and easy.  I substituted cow's milk for rice milk and it was still REALLY good.  Great when you're cooking for one.

I have a picky eater at home and since we are a soccer family there is no time to make long cooking meals.  This meal was ideal and when adding some of my son's favorite flavors (BBQ sauce and spanish seasoning), made this dinner a big hit.  I agree with another who reviewed; I added croutons (sea salt and pepper flavor) to the bread mixture.  

FYI:  We put the BBQ sauce on when there was a minute left.

Why have we been spending so much time using the oven for a one of our favorites?  This is quick and is as good as some of my favorite oven dishes. It can be altered and tweaked with any flavored you have.

This is an awesome recipe that can be altered and customized as needed.  I love it!!!  Today I used ground turkey, 1 TBS Fiber One cereal (ground), 2 TBS milk, 1 TBS Lipton Beefy Onion soup, and chopped, fresh parsley.  After cooking, I put a bit of ketchup on top but gravy would work nicely too.  Yum!!!

Genius! I am very surprised how well this worked and I wasn't going to say anything if it didn't but I will definitely do this again. First, if it would work in a mug I thought why not a small baking dish. (corningware)I was worried about the fat at the bottom so I made an elevation platform punched with holes out of a stiff curved paper plate, but will be looking to replace that with something from BBB maybe. (not metal) All the fat went to the bottom and I just lifted the loaf out easily. Changes I made: 1 lb of chuck, rather than deal with chopping onion, grn pepper, using ketchup, this is supposed to be easy and fast so I borrowed from another recipe here and added a half a small jar of medium salsa (which has all those things in it)and an egg to the mixture. Everything else was the same, total cooking time was 9 minutes on 70%, 4 minutes in broiler to get the perfect bark on top and a splash more of salsa. I saved at least an hour and it is delicious, firm and sliceable. Thanks grl2005!

Don't be fooled by this recipe's simplicity - it is quite tasty for Meatloaf in a Mug. 

I personally double the Worcestershire sauce and use 1 teaspoon instead of 1/2 to give it more taste.

I made this this morning so I could chill it for a meatloaf sandwich later today. I mostly followed the recipe. I didn't have bread, so I used crushed cereal as the binder-Kix, to be exact. I didn't use the milk, but ketchup instead-meatloaf has to have ketchup in it. I also made a glaze with a bit of ketchup, vinegar and brown sugar and put that on at 2 min cooking time. The time was pretty close in the recipe. It was not quite 100º @ 4 minutes, so I just upped it another 2 minutes, and it was done. I did use the 70% power. I have a 900 watt microwave, so the rest of you can judge cooking times by this and the wattage of your microwave. This is a very nice idea and I am glad you posed it. Thanks!

I had some extras that I needed to get rid of so to the ingredients above I substituted 1 BubbaBurger and  I added one egg beaten and some chopped onion.  I put the mixture in a ceramic dish 5"Wide x7"Long x1"deep and put it into a 425 degree toaster oven for about 35 minutes (visually check) .  If you have some left over spaghetti sauce you might want to top it with a spoonful about half way through cooking.
It turned out really good and I'll make it again
