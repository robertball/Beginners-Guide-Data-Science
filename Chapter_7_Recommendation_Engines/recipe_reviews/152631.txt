This cake was great, and went very fast! I frosted it with one box of pistachio instant pudding and one package of dream whip, mixing both together with 1 1/2 cups of milk. Next time, I plan on adding walnuts to the mixture.

I'm glad I found this recipe!  My mother made this pistachio coffee cake for years and I've always loved it.  She would put half the batter in the bundt pan, and then sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon, brown sugar and chopped walnuts and then add the remaining batter.  Other than that, this is the recipe that I remember from my  childhood - and it's super moist and delicious!

I have made this cake for many years and when my young nieces and nephews would "decorate" this cake with various candies (Brach's chocolate stars, candy corn, M&Ms, whatever... (lots of finger licking going on too:) Back then, they called it the Kermit-The-Frog Cake... I made a buttercream frosting with both vanilla and almond extract, a few drops of green food coloring (a few drops put into the cake also), it made a beautiful bundt cake everybody loved.

This is one of those recipes I get asked to bring to gatherings.  To make it with a heavier pound cake consistency add an 8 oz container of sour cream.

I love this cake and have been making it for years--I have to say in my opinion it is much prettier if you use white cake mix instead of yellow.

This is a wonderful cake! I baked mine in a 9 x 13 cake pan and it was ready in 30 minutes. I used the recipe for Cool Whipped Frosting made with pistachio pudding instead of vanilla. Then topped it with chopped pecans and served with sliced fresh strawberries and it was delicious! A definite keeper in our house.

This is a good base recipe but it really needs some jazzing up. I found it to be very bland, I almost added another box of pudding & now wish that I had because it really needs it. I also added some white chocolate chips which helped but I don't think we'll be doing this one again as is.

I can't believe I never reviewed this recipe!  Found this on AR years ago and have been making it ever since.  It has become my signature cake, everyone loves it.  And if I haven't made it in a while, I am reminded so.  Try it you'll love it.

Made this cake for work and everyone absolutely loved it ... many asked for the recipe.  I omitted the food coloring because the pudding already made the cake green. I covered the cake with whipped cream and toped with sugar toasted sliced almonds â€¦ Delicious!

I love this cake! I think next time I'll add finely chopped pistachios to the batter, but it's great without them. Perfectly moist but not to the point where it falls apart.

I made this years ago and loved it.  This time I tried to reduce the calories to get it to a lower weight watchers point value by using sugar free cake mix, sugar free fat free pudding, egg substitute,and applesace instead of oil.  Still came out well but next time I will use some oil to improve consistency.  5 ww points plus per serving though and worth every point!

Not as pistachio tasting as I expected - but still great.  I wonder if you could use 2 boxes of pistachio pudding to up that flavor?

I've been making this recipe for years - even before I found it on allrecipes.com today!  (I don't add food coloring... it's not really needed.)  This is a staple for brunches, bridal/baby showers, pot lucks,  you name it.  Trust me - serve it with coffee or milk and it will disappear.

When I made this cake, I added a few things.  First, I threw in some chocolate chips which was yummy, but it doesn't need them.  Second, I frosted the cake with a jar of white frosting I had in my pantry.  I also sprinkled coconut on top and it was FANTASTIC!  As far as the food coloring, I understand that it makes it more "pistachio" looking; however, it can be left out to avoid adding any artificial coloring.  Will definitely make this recipe again!
