My 3 year old daughter had a great time helping me fix this dish. I used my own basic cornbread recipe over on the breadrecipe site instead of a box of mix. Doused it in Tabasco. This one comes to the next potluck or picnic.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I've eaten it before and I am so happy to "have the know how now."  I used the frozen crayfish tails that I bought at the local grocery store.  If you don't like this, either you aren't from cajun country or you did something wrong.

i  think the flavor of this is excellent. but the texture made as is was not what i was expecting. it came out dry and crumbly just as another reviewer said. if i made again i would probobly add the liquid called for on the box recipe and continue with recipe from there.

This was OK, but the cornbread mixture came out dry and crumbly.  If I make it again, I will add a little more liquid to the cornbread mixture.

I bet you used those imported Chinese crawfish. That is a huge risk. They often are horrible and RUIN recipes! I only use Louisiana crawfish (after trying to save $ and getting a bad package of frozen Chinese crawfish tails).  BLEGH! 
I haven't tried this recipe, but it looks great so I am giving it a 4 just so I can warn people not to use Chinese crawfish unless that is your only choice.  I am looking for a specific recipe, and I am not sure if this is it.  I am from Louisiana and really, honestly swear that there is a difference in quality. 
If I were to make these, I add a sprinkle of Tony's. (That goes into everything!) Tony Chachere's is as important as the Trinity in my book. (I mean the cooking Trinity (onion, bell pepper, celery) not the Divine one, because THAT one IS SUPREME ;)

This was good, the only thing I did was make my own cornbread mix instead of using store bought.  This is because I don't like sweet cornbread.  But this was delicious...

This came out very well, but some changes. I substitute d crabmeat, shrimp, pollack fillet for the crayfish, came out great.  One thing not specified in the original recipe,  make sure you drain the a canned diced tomatoes.  It is also fantastic the next day pan fried.

I love this. I made it from scratch instead of box mix and I used a little butter milk to thin it down some. Not going to be the same texture as normal cornbread but the flavor is great!
