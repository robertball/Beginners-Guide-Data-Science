If you are making these, here's a tip. Do not use apple cider vinegar - it's not the same thing as cider vinegar! It'll completely ruin your sauce. I found that out the hard way, had to throw out the sauce plus my house stunk for days. I tried it again with regular vinegar and it was great - I'm sure cider vinegar would be even better.

Good recipe. The meatballs are too plain, though, with only salt and pepper. One should either use seasoned bread crumbs or add some seasoning spices (dried parsley, sage, etc.). I added three more dashes of soy sauce to mellow the sweetness of the sauce.

These sweet and sour meatballs are absolutley great.  The sweet and sour sauce is great on chicken wings also.  I have made this recipe at least a billion times now and it's a hit with everyone.  Absolutley great!!!!!!  Believe me you will love this recipe and it's simple.  

Sometimes instead of making my own meatballs.  I just buy the already made meatballs (like Armour meatballs).  You just have to put the meatballs in the oven for 30-40 minutes (frozen).  Make the sauce while you wait for the meatballs.  Then just put the meatballs in the sauce.  

This is also great with mashed potates.  Just sit the meatballs right on top of the mashed potatoes and it'll give your mashed potatoes a great taste.

Yummmmmmmm!!!  These were sooooooooo good!!!  The only kind of vinegar I had on hand was white wine and I only used about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup and the sauce turned out perfect!  I think I'll even be making the sauce alone to pour on chicken.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It is impossible for an average cook like myself to look at this simple ingredients list and determine that it could be converted into the wild, delicious taste extravaganza that resulted! I have 4 children, from 10-17, with a wide array of likes and dislikes.  This one was a unanimous 5-star Eat Like A Viking contest.  I knew I would have to double the batch, but it still disappeared.  Great recipe and so easy, no fuss.

I-LOVED-THIS! We had this recipe yesterday for dinner and I feel like having it today too.  I did everything as written EXCEPT for the cider vinegar.  I did not have any, so I used white vinegar instead, ONLY 1 TBS.  That's all you need trust me, if you put more, ur recipe will be ruined just like other reviewers have said.

FANTASTIC recipe! I took advice of other reviewers and halved the vinegar-I also only had white vinegar, so I used that. The only other change I made was add a small can of pineapple tidbits w/the juice. This was fast, easy and so delicious!

I made this and my family loved it! A welcome new addition to my menu planning. I did have make a few alterations due to ingredients on hand and it still turned out delicious. I used Balsamic vinager (3 TBLSP) in place of cider vinager,  teriyaki sauce in place of soy sauce and added some Worcestershire sauce (3 TBLSP) to the meat mixture. Yummy!

This recipe is also a off version of my moms. A sweet fav of mine.  I like altering recipes to my taste and this one is great and easy to do that with. I first used more spice like other readers said(montreal steak spice,ground pepper,garlic salt) I mixed the ground beef 1/2 and 1/2 with pork. I've always found it a bit sweet with that much brown sugar so I cut it in half.  I also used white vinegar, doubled or tripled the soy sauce, cut the ketchup in half(not because of the taste, but because of the color..I prefer a darker/richer sauce) I also added a touch of dark molasses(about 1 tbsp)To add to the richness of color.  I doubled the recipe and by the time I was ready to eat there was only two meatballs left...Wow..an amazing recipe for sure! It's a great start to any great meal...playing with any recipe can be fun and adds a bit zest to everyday menus. Thanks for sharing it was nice to see a different version than my moms..got my creative thoughts going! Just goes to show...Moms and great mother in laws are a blessing to us when we are newbies to cooking!!!

These were good, but not 5 star quality. The sauce does seems starchy and I used only 1 tblspoon. Also it does seem to be a bit too much vinegar. I used apple cider vin and it was fine. All in all it worked for our dinner, but not sure if I'd make it again.

These were amazing. I brought them to 3 potlucks and got rave reviews each time. I cut the vinegar and brown sugar in half. I also added about 2 tbsp of pure Canadian Maple syrup as well as a few cloves of garlic to the sauce. Great recipe. Thank you

Wow!  This is my new favorite recipe for when company comes over.  I doubled the recipe the first time out and it is totally awesome, I wanted to eat the entire pot all by myself.  The sweet and sour sauce is absolutely perfect, so simple but so delicious, and the meatballs cooked up great. I had my doubts as the meat mixture was pretty wet, but those doubts were proven unfounded as they came out wonderfully.  The only change I made is that I sauteed the onions before adding them to the meat mixture as I'm not a raw onion fan.  I would definitely do that again though I would dice them really finely for 1 to 1-1/2 inch meatballs.  Still, the flavor is phenomenal and I am so thrilled with the results!

Fantastic recipe! After reading some of the reviews with opinions on vinegar & how sweet it was, I cut back the amount of sugar to two tbsp and used white vinegar. It was fabulous! This really is a 5-star recipe- it's fast, easy, and had rave reviews from my husband and 4yo daughter. I think at one point they were described as "nuggets of deliciousness"... yes, it was that good. 

Cathy, props to you MIL for this recipe! 

For a little added heat, my husband and I added a little sriracha sauce.

This is a great recipe. I used ground turkey and regular vinegar.  I did not have ground beef or cider vinegar on hand.  Everything turn out great.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is sooooo good!!! I added a little pineapple juice and reduced the brown sugar....just did it by taste. Didn't have cornstarch so I used flour. Also added onions, red and green peppers, and pineapple. Love it!

This wasn't terrible, but it wasn't a hit either. The vinegar overpowered the dish for us. I made it as it's written, maybe I should have used some advice of others.

I'm sorry to say we did not enjoy these at all. I even followed the recipe exactly. The meatballs were hard (could be my fault, although I never have a problem with meatballs), and the sauce was overly sweet.

Just found this recipe and had all the ingredients so I thought I would try it.  Delicious!!  We had the meatballs as our meat for dinner and also had baked potatoes and put the sauce over them.  Very easy.

OMG this was so good. I used half of the vinegar, used apple cider vinegar taste great, not sure what prev reviewer was referring to. Made a few changes, used 2 eggs instead of the one. With the whole cup of bread crumbs more was needed for the meatballs to roll better and not fall apart. I used Italian bread crumbs, added garlic powder , pepper , salt. dash of ginger. Used 1/2 onion diced small. Onion needs to be diced really small or else meatballs will have hard time rolling and staying together. I browned the meatballs then baked while i made the sauce in the bowl. I sauteed green pepper, then added the sauce, then added pineapple chunks, added the meat back and let simmer. Severed over while bastmati rice. Was awesome. The hubbie was like "wow this is great" I will keep this is rotation now and make again with my changes.

I made these after reading all of the reviews and I was so disappointed. My 13 yr old son who eats anything and everything didn't even like them! Too sweet, too sour, too many bread crumbs. I was hoping this would be a good option for me because I like sweet and sour but I don't like chunks of fruit with my meat as most recipes call for. Oh well, on to the next. . .

Love this recipe!  Have made it many times for various occasions, it always goes over well.  Rarely do we have leftovers.  Much better than the kind made with jelly.  Easy to prepare...although I do save time and use frozen meatballs.  (just put the meatballs frozen in the mix, put the slower cooker on and stir occasionally).  Turns out great everytime

This was ok for me.  I made as directed but found the ketchup a little too overpowering in the sauce.  However, I liked the meat balls.  I made with some white rice and steamed veggies

I just made this sauce as I already had pre-thawed my frozen meatballs.  I followed some of the advice of others. I used 4 TBS of Basalmic Vinegar, used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar and added some pineapple tidbits.  We needed something to take to my 8 y.o. granddaughter's Christmas party. My granddaughter loved them and said she was going to tell everyone that her "mommaw is an awesome cook and she made them."  They were a hit and all that was left was the empty pan.  i will definitely be making more.

This sauce was amazing!  I only made the sauce part of this recipe because I wanted to use it on pre-packaged meatballs, chicken wings and ribs.  It was very easy to make and was a total hit.  I froze the extra for a quick dressing on a future dinner.

My family loves these meatballs, even my 1 year old is crazy about them! I omit the onion and add a mix of onion powder, garlic powder and a bit of salt and pepper to the meat. I also use distilled white vinegar and about 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of a cup.

I baked my meatballs for 40 mins in the oven. While they were cooking, I made my sauce. I had checked out a few other recipes and saw one that used bottled chili sauce. I decided to add 1/2 cup of that too. It gave the sauce a nice tangy kick. I only used 3 tablespoons of regular old white vinegar because that's all I had. I think that was plenty. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added garlic and onion salt to my meatballs. Salt and pepper didn't seem like enough. When my meatballs were done, I sprayed my crock pot with Pam for easy clean up, dumped my meatballs in and poured the sauce over top. I left them in there for about 2 hours and served them over rice. I think they came out great and will try again.

This recipe was really good but the best that I have had. I used frozen meatballs for easier preparation but I think the next time I am going to try the handmade ones. I did add some frozen peas and carrots (suggested by another reviewer) to add some vegetables and served over white rice. Will definitely be added to my recipe box!

This was very delicious! The sweet and sour sauce is the best I've had and will use it for other recipes as well. I chopped the onion very fine and still had a little crumbling problem but I found making the meatballs by hand helped them stay together better. Very yummy and I have already made several times. Served over eggnoodles. Thank you!

My husband and I absolutely LOVED this! I used ground turkey in place of beef and they were so good! I reduced the vineger to 1/4 cup as others suggested and it was perfect! Going to try the sauce as a marinade for steak and burgers also! Thanks for a great-quick meal!

I really liked this recipe for two reasons. It was easy to make and most people will have these ingredients right in their pantry. I read other reviews and did make a few changes. I used 1 1/2 lb. of ground beef, 1/2 an onion, chopped, which was plenty. I used 2 eggs since I had extra ground beef. I also only used 1/2 cup of italian bread crumbs as that was all I had. I then baked at 350 degrees for 45 mins, turning once, as another viewer suggested and it was nice and moist. The only thing with baking it is that all the fat sits in the pan after baking. I guess I could've tried to drain it or scrape it out but I didn't have time and it wasn't too much fat. I guess the amount of fat would depend on how lean your ground beef is. I then added the sauce(I only had white vinegar so used 1/4 cup)on top of the meatballs and baked for 30 mins more. When first made, the sauce is quite watery, but does thicken after baking and sitting a bit. It wasn't too sweet for my taste like others said. I even made some itty bitty balls for my 21 month old daughter who's not a great eater and she loved them!! They were just the right size for her to hold and munch on. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is so excellent. It's is really easy to make. I just added a little more cornstarch the thicken the sauce a little more. It was delicious. Also I didn't use a whole onion maybe a half of one and I also added chopped green pepper.

The sauce makes this recipe ..... the meatballs are dull.  Next time I will add some herbs to the meatball recipe.  I am disappointed with the high calorie content but sometimes we just have to SPLURGE!!  I used ground turkey and Gluten Free bread crumbs.  I buy a lot of ground turkey when it goes on sale ..... it's great to have a REAL NICE 'change of pace' recipe.

This was great!  I made them small for a holiday party and the guests loved them.  The meatballs were great plain and the sauce made it even better.  I read the other reviews and also made some adjustments...1st I doubled the recipe, but didn't double the vinegar, didn't quite double the seasoned bread crumbs, and didn't double the minced onion.   I used apple cider vinegar which is all I could  find.  I also baked the meatballs.  When I made the sauce, I added it all to a large pan on the stove and transferred to a crockpot for serving.  I will make them again for sure :) Thanks for the recipe!

I like this recipe but I use it strictly for the sauce ... I make my own meatballs with seasoned breadcrumbs and oregano and also grated parmesan cheese with no salt) or in a pinch I use store bought pork or chicken meatballs ... at my grocery store they have some real nice ones that the kids like almost as much as my homemade ones

loved this recipe!  the only changes i made were to add 1/2 tsp of ginger powder to the meatballs and 1/2 tsp to the sauce.  because i wanted to cook the meatballs in the afternoon but not eat it for a couple of hours later when my husband came home, i browned the meatballs and put the sauce ingredients in the slow cooker.  once the meat was browned, i dumped them in the slow cooker and put it on high for a couple of hours.  perfect!  when we were ready to eat i made some brown minute rice, and opened a bag of salad :)  easy and so yummy!

YUM!  I only gave 4 stars because I made some changes, but this is a GREAT starting recipe.  I've never made sweet and sour meatballs before, but I had an idea of the flavor I was going for, and this recipe was a super starting point.  After reading the reviews, I used seasoned bread crumbs, and on personal preference, used onion powder instead of chopped onion.    Next time, I would use some onion powder in the sauce as well, and maybe add a little bit of salt to it as well.

Loved this recipe, but too much cornstarch-- I cooked the meatballs in the oven at 350 degrees so that they would brown all over and cooked the sauce separately in a skillet with half the cornstarch and it thickened just fine.  Added the meatballs and tossed them around a bit (3-5 minutes or so) and laid them atop a bed of brown rice--yummy!!

Unfortunately this recipe was very disappointing to me. First of all- you do NOT need a whole onion. WAY too much! And I agree with other reviewers that the sauce had way too much vinegar. Also, the meatballs had a very strange chewy texture... overall this was edible. But I won't be making it again

These are really nummy! I did add garlic powder and italian seasoning to the meat mix and instead of chopped onion I used onion powder. I wanted a soft texture. I prefer these meatballs over store bought anyday. It takes a little time to prepare and individually roll, but I think it's worth it. The sauce was great too and really completes this dish. I think the flavor of these is even better reheated the next day. I will be making these again and again.

I was very disappointed w/ these meatballs. I reduced the amount of onion to 1/4 of a cup and I used seasoned Panko breadcrumbs. The real issue was with the sauce, it was way too sweet -- no one in my (usually not picky) family liked it.

Don't let the 5 star rating fool you!  After reading the reviews, I gave it a try.  I decided to decrease the amount of onion to about 1/4 cup. 
Glad I did because the entire onion would have been WAY too much (and I love onions).  I also decreased the amount of cider vinegar to 1/4 cup.  Again, glad I did.  Everyone in my house commented on the strong vinegar smell and my 3 year old refused to eat it because of the smell. 
As for the rest of us, we agreed that it's merely edible and by no means a 5 star recipe.

I used my usual "concoction" when making my meatballs and used the sauce from this recipe.  The next time I make this I will use less  vinegar, as I found it a little tart. UPDATE: Made this again last week for seven of us and used half the vinegar.  It was delicious, and is the recipe my mom says she wants to use from now on.

I love this recipe! I make it weekly now. I substitute ground turkey for the beef and use half the amount of onion. I also bake my meatballs in the oven. Even my VERY picky 4 year old gobbles this up :)

Too much onion! The meatballs didn't stay formed in the skillet, so I ended up with a pot full of sweet and sour ground beef! The appearance of it scared away all my family members, and we're not that picky! Not likely to try this again.

This was delicious; not sure what type of cider vinegar I used as it was no longer in the original container. I prepared it according to recipe but after the first serving, I added a tsp. of red pepper flakes to my personal tastes. Yum!

This turned out pretty good. Some of the meatballs fell apart and I only used half of the onion. I think it would be good with Broccoli and Pineapple. I added a TBS of worcestershire sauce in place of TBS soy sauce.

Great meatball recipe - best I've tried and I'm going to play around with it. The sauce was a bit sweet and tart my first time making this, but my husband LOVED it. I'm going to try some of the suggestions from the reviews about the sauce, but I'm sticking with this meatball recipe and may just try with barbeque or other sauces.

YUMMMMMMM!!  I made the sauce from this recipe and it was a HUGE hit!!  My meatball recipe was different and about twice the quantity but it was because of the sauce I am sure that we almost ran out of meatballs at dinner!  Hurray for a new recipe to add to our family favourites - thank you!

I found the sauce was too sweet for my liking. I loved the simplicity of it though, especially since I did it in a slow cooker on high for 3 hours. Not much work, which I liked. I might try this again and reduce the sugar.

The first time I made this recipe as written, and it was too sweet.  The second time, I substituted plain tomato sauce for the ketchup, and it was pretty close to perfect.  Kids loved it.

Loved these! Kept to the ingredients listed but instead of using the method here, i made the meatballs up and put them in a 9x13 pan raw. I heated the sauce ingredients up and poured them over the meatballs and baked them in the oven at 325 for an hour and 15 minutes and they were scrumptious!!

I followed the recipe exactly but the sauce seemed too 'vinegar-y' so I ended up adding additinal ketchup and soy to the sauce before cooking.  The vinegar was STILL too strong... DH couldn't even eat it.  I ate it and liked it, but I tend to like vinegar-y things.  I won't make again, though, as I'm the only one in the family who did eat it.

These were good but needed some extra seasoning for flavor. A touch of Garlic and Adobo in the sauce did the trick.

These were fantastic! I used turkey meat and less bread crumbs to save calories and fat and they came out simply spectacular. I love the sauce and have since used it with chicken and various other meals. It was so simple to make and all of my dinner guests loved it!! I will continue to make this over and over again.

This was fabulous!!!  Even my four year old liked it and ate seconds, which never happens!  I did omit the onions, used 3/4 cup white vinegar and used more soy sauce, probably around 2 1/2 tablespoons.  Definitely making this again soon!

I just made this.  It is really good.  Next time though I will leave out the breadcrumbs and the egg.  Just a little less vinegar and they will be perfect!  I did add some minced garlic to the meatballs.  Excellent!

Ok it is a good basic recipe but it needs a bit of veggies in it . So I added some green pepper chunks, some carrot strips and 1 small onion.Let it simmer in the sauce with the store bought italian meatballs for an hour and voila. That gave it some extra flavour and added veggies to your meal.

This is truly a 5 star recipe!  I actually love this flavor of sweet n sour more than the restraunt style.  Healthier Tweek:  1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup stevia and then I used turkey meatballs.  The raves during dinner amongst hubby, a 5 yr old and a 12 yr old made me blush.  Next time I'll decrease the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and 1/3 cup stevia and I bet it will still be a super 5 star recipe!!!  Thanks for the recipe...a true staple to my collection.

I used frozen meatballs when making this due to the fact that I planned it at the last minute and hadn't taken ground beef out of the freezer. Anyway, I think the flavor in this recipe is more in the sauce than the meat. The sauce was incredibly easy to assemble and tasted good as written, but I did make some changes to please my palate. I added about 1/4 cup of honey BBQ sauce and about 1/8 cup more of brown sugar. I thought it was terrific with these changes and plan to use this sauce with other meats - chicken, shrimp, kielbasa,...

This will now be my go to meatball recipe!  I did bake the meatballs rather than fry them. Oven set at at 350* for approxinmately 30 minutes depending on size.  As for the sauce, it received rave reviews from our guests.  No changes needed here. Thanks Cathy!  Fantastic!!

delicious!  I doubled the recipe but didn't double the breadcrumbs or the cornstarch.  I ran out of brown sugar and had to use white sugar.  But other than those issues, I will definitely make again!

This was great..took it to a Halloween party last week and everyone raved. I did tweak it some though. I replaced half of the ketchup with our favorite bottled BBQ sauce to give it a little tang and also added a couple of pinches of cayenne to give it a kick. Also used my own meatball recipe which was similar but with kicked up flavors (onion, garlic, red pepper flakes). Delicious..this will become a party favorite!

I seasoned the meatballs with a little bit of cajun seasoning.  I baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes.  Then I put them in a slow cooker and poured the sauce over top.  I cooked it on low for a few hours to let the sauce permeate the meatballs.

I followed the instructions exactly, but the sauce had such an overpowering vinegar taste that we couldn't eat it.  That's unusual because I love vinegar.  If I ever tried this recipe again, I'd cut the vinegar at least in half.

These meatballs were great and the sauce was perfect.  I used 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef, 2 eggs and the other ingredients as listed in the recipe.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, turning once.  Then I added the sauce and baked them for another 30 minutes.  They were tender and delicious.

my wife made these for me and she's not the cook, I loved them but found them a little too starchy, try substituting half the cornstarch with flour, you will still get the thickness

This has been a family favorite of ours since I first discovered it here back in 2000.  When available, I use the sauce with frozen pre-packaged meatballs and it becomes a quick and easy party snack or super quick dinner served over rice.  When I need to make the meatballs by hand, I usually form meat patties instead, to save time.  We cook them up like hamburger patties in a skillet or in the oven, and then pour the sauce over and simmer a bit.  Microwave works, as does stove top, oven, and crock pot, once the meat is cooked.  So versatile, and SO TASTY!!!  My whole family loves this.  Oh, also, sometimes, I'll double or triple the sauce.  It can be kept indefinitely in the fridge.  Makes those prepackaged meatballs super-easy!

Just made this for Dinner with creamy mash an added cheese and ginger to the meatballs an was superb!, I'm not sure what cider vinegar is I'm in australia (corn starch is cornflour) so I presumed white vinegar would do, which it worked out great =). Definitely a good easy meatball dish

Sweet, tangy, sour deliciousness. I eyeball my ingredients and it always turns out delish. Mix the meat with some onions, salt n pepper, maybe some breadcrumbs or even some celery for that crunch texture...however you make it the sauce is perfect. Keep in mind not to make the meatballs too fancy or the sauce may not pair well. I only use the amount called for the cider vinegar and if I don't have that I use regular vinegar but not as much. I mix the sauce to my taste then thicken it with corn starch and water after pouring the sauce over the cooked meatballs. Love this recipe its soo good!! Simple and delicious!

I served this appetiser dish to my good friends last night and they raved about it and cleaned the dish out. That always makes a cook happy. It was very easy and quick to make.

Made this tonight and it was a hit! Loved the sauce, perfect balance! Used Apple cider vinegar and it was great (one reviewer said it wasn't the same as cider vinegar). I used my own meatball recipe and baked them in the oven to make it easier. Will definitely make again!

Awesome! Doubled mine and just added 2 splashes of white vinegar. I also added 2 cloves of garlic then sauteed it with the onions and some dried oregano and dried basil.

This is very similar to the recipe my mom has made for ages. My adjustments: I chopped half an onion and added 6 cloves of garlic and seasoned bread crumbs to the magic bullet. It came out quite watery from the onion juice. I added it to a mixture of half ground pork and half ground beef. I added some extra breadcrumbs to make the mixture less runny. The meatballs came out really moist and delicious. For the sauce I added a bit less white vinegar like has been mentioned previously. I also replaced a bit of the ketchup with sirracha hot sauce. 
Delicious!

The sauce is really good.  I reduced the sugar, as suggested by other reviewers.  Even so, it seemed particularly sweet.  The meatballs themselves are pretty bland.  Would have appreciated more seasoning in the recipe.  I might try adding some spices recommended by other reviewers.

I tried this recipe last night and my kids LOVED it.  I made a couple adjustments, I uses gluten free breadcrumbs and gluten free soy sauce.  I also used white vinegar just because I didn't have any cider vinegar in the house.  Still was a big hit!  We will be adding this to our regular rotation of meals.

Super easy.  After I brown the meatballs, I put them in the crock pot and pour the sauce over.  I let them cook until we are ready to eat!  4 or more hours.  We love these meatballs over mashed potatoes.

I made this recipe as it's written, simply because it's easy to adjust the flavour however you wish. I did find the flavour sweeter than I like (our palates run more on the tangy side) so I added a couple of splashes of lemon. Really cut the sweet down, and really added to the flavour overall.

Nice recipe.  I used white vinegar after reading a comment that Apple Cider Vinegar was not suitable.  I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added a 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning to the meat mixture before cooking the meatballs.  The sauce was not too strong in vinegar flavour and not too sweet either, all good comments from DH and DS tonight.  I will make this again and again.

I thought these were really good.  I baked the meatballs at 325 F convection for 15 minutes.  When I made the sauce I only used 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp cornstarch then brought it to a boil.  I added the meatballs and then simmered for 20 minutes.  Served with brown rice and green beans.  Next time I might even use less cornstarch.

Meatballs taste really great, but they are extremely sweet, so only make them if you like sweet dishes.

I also thought that using a whole onion would be too much, but it added a great flavour.

Used frozen meatballs which I cooked in the over at 350 degrees for 30 minutes then added it to the sauce which I mixed in a pot and brought to a boil.  My 28 month old loved it.  Will definitely make it again and again!

This was easy to make, but far too sweet. Next time I'll reduce the amount of brown sugar.  In fact, I'll probably halve the sauce recipie as well as there was far too much for us.

This was a great recipe! My partner and daughter absolutely LOVED it! I used regular vinegar to instead of the cider and really like the tangy flavor. Very easy to make and delicious. . . big batches = great next day lunches :)

I'm really no good at making meatballs.  In fact, my husband loves nearly everything I make for him, but when I made him meatballs, we threw out the leftovers.  I tried these because I had ground sausage to use and was a little tired of pasta.  (I will use ground beef next time - the sausage didn't render a lot of the fat out because of the binders)  These are really good!  Everyone really liked them and they're sooooo easy.  Let them eat meatballs!

This was a super recipe!  I did exchange the water for pineapple juice, then reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added pineapple, green peppers and some crushed chilies at the end.  Superb!!

Great I baked the meat balls in the oven until they were done. And I followed the ingredients just as the recipe said. They came out great. I will use this recipe over and over! Thank you for sharing! I did not think it was too much vinegar. Just right!

Easy, kid friendly, and fast too. I thought it was a little too vinegary, but The Hungry Teen gave this five stars. We did miss the pineapple and green pepper usually in sweet and sour sauce. I used dried chopped onion about 2 T or so worth. The meatballs were really dry and I added a splash of milk, maybe 3T worth. There was plenty of sauce, which is always a plus. Although this was good, it didn't make my favorites. Thanks Cathy for a great meal.

This is a good recipe. With my variation it just made it better. Instead of frying the meatballs I baked them @ 350 degrees for fifteen minutes and then added them to a crockpot with all the other ingredients and adding a mixture of sweet peppers diced for added texture to the dish and then served it over white converted rice for a great meal!

OMG! Want a super easy diner idea?! Use pre-made frozen meatballs! Defrost/brown in pan, mix and pour on sauce(I also use white vinegar), add frozen peas and thinly slivered carrots if you want, simmer 15-20 min. and serve with rice! Excellent sauce!

They were easy. they weren't bad, but need some tweeking. The sauce was a little starchy, and the ketchup flavor dominated (my opinion). I think I will try it again, only using less corn starch and 1/4cup ketchup 1/4cup BBQ sauce (instead of 1/2cup ketchup)

Yum!! Would have given it 5 stars for the sauce (which is sweet and perfect over rice) but only gave it 4 stars because the meatballs themselves are quite plain. I doctored mine up with some extra ingredients: some dijon mustard, soya sauce, worchestire sauce, extra garlic and onions.

This made a lot, and it was a bit hard to fit all of them in my large skillet, let alone stir them! However, using tongs to turn them worked pretty well. I used about half the amount of sugar and it still came out way too sweet for our taste. The flavours were fabulous, and we all loved this over pasta, but I would decrease the sweetness some more next time. Thanks for sharing the recipe, it's a keeper after very little  tweaking to our taste!

This makes a very yummy sweet and sour sauce, my husband and 3 year-old son loved it! I used regular vinegar since that's all I had and did add a bit more soy sauce as it is very sweet. I already had meatballs in the freezer that I had made previously, so didn't use that oart of this recipe.

YUM!!!!! These are quick and soo good. I changed a few things though. I used a splenda/brown sugar mix, only a half of an onion, added crushed red pepper and Italian seasoning. The red pepper gave the sweet a spicy kick. These will be made again!!! Great recipe.

I used ground turkey for a healthier alternative. I found them a little sweet so the second time I made them, I used about 1/2 a cup of brown sugar. I used red wine vinegar and they taste great. We love these!

Great recipe to tweak to your liking. I made the sauce as directed then decided to add some Rooster hot sauce (Asian kind).  It cut the sweet and added just a hint of heat.  I also pulled the meatballs from the pan and let the sauce thicken by itself.

I had no idea what to expect with this dish considering the variety of reviews it received, but I was pleasantly suprised.  I followed the recipe exactly but substituted regular vinegar for the cider vinegar.  I also added some chopped up onion and green bell peppers toward the end of the cooking because to me a sweet and sour dish isn't complete without them.  The sauce turned out great and would be wonderful with other foods as well (chicken wings, egg rolls, etc.).

I did not care for this recipe.  I baked the meatballs in the oven and poured the sauce over top allowing it to simmer in the oven.  It had a very strong flavor of vinegar.  It just did not work for me.

Really good! I didn't use the onion though, my husband wont eat it. I did cook the meatballs in the oven for 45 mins at 350 then, added them to the sauce in a crock pot to keep warm for an hour. I did think there was going to be too much vinegar (as stated in many reveiws), but once the meatballs were added, it was perfect! Will make again.

OMG! WAY to much vinegar!!  The amount of vinegar called for completely ruined my sauce, had to dump it out and remake with half as much...sauce was good after this change. Really wanted to like this recipe since it got 4.5 stars, but found that the meatballs were very bland for our liking.

I made these for the second time tonite.  I cut the vinegar back by 1/2.  Used 1/8 C apple cider vinegar and 1/2 C white wine vinegar.  I also used 1 1/2C of water.  I did my own thing with the meatballs using 1/4C fiber one, 1/4 C quick cooking oats, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp seasoning salt, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 of an onion, 2 egg whites and pepper to taste.  This turned out great and will use this recipe again.

This was easy to make and good. I substituted 1/4 c. Splenda brown sugar and simmered in a slow cooker all afternoon.

So easy and good! I cheated and used frozen meatballs, and instant rice the whole meal was ready in under 20 minutes. I'll make this again for sure!!

These are so delicious and easy, especially over rice.  They were even better than I thought they would be.  The best meatballs I've tasted.

These are fabulous!  They make getting your hands all icky worth it.  I used white vinegar and halved the amount.  Like a fool I froze half thinking I'd made too many for one meal, but they were SO good, we could have eaten them all by the next day!  Definitely going into regular rotation around here.

Terrific recipe - easy, fast prep and cook time, and best of all very few dishes to clean afterwards.  I did however heed the advice offerred, halved the vinnegar, and used white instead of cider vinnegar. My family liked it a lot, but if you have anyone that is anti-onion, this is not for you; my 12-year-old commented on all of the onion inside the meatballs.  However, everyone else loved it.

We love this! I only use 1/4 to 1/2 c. chopped onion- sauteed first. I also used 2 eggs & only 2/3 c. of seasoned bread crumbs. The sauce is what makes the recipe. It is delicious. Yummy over rice!

This is a very tasty recipe but is a little too sweet. I serve it with pasta, which seems to go well. But, it's a bit much after a while. I think it makes a good appetizer, though.

This was sooo yummy! After reading previous reviews, I used only half an onion and baked the meatballs instead of browning in a skillet. The sauce was fantastic! I will definitely make these again!

If you can brown the meatballs without them falling apart, you're home free.  I cooked the meatballs in the sauce for 1/2 hour on low heat.  I thought the sauce would be too sweet.  It turned out perfect.  No leftovers at a recent potluck dinner!

I was intrigued by the easiness of this recipe -- it is easy but on the whole pretty unremarkable.  Way too much onion turned my daughter off immediately.  Just an okay sort of dish I wouldn't make again.

For the most part, "cider vinegar" and "apple cider vinegar" mean the same thing in common usage. However, fruit-flavored vinegar and individual branding practices add a few wrinkles to this rule of thumb. In most cases, cider vinegar and apple cider vinegar refer to the same thing so don't be afraid of using it Sylvie is just miss educated

The other reviewers made me nervous about using apple cider vinegar so I used 1/2 apple cider and 1/2 distilled white. I also substituted Murphs Bloody Mary Mix for half of the ketchup. This recipe was truly AMAZING.

Delicious, now if I can figure out how to take a picture!! New favourite, and I used apple cider vinegar with mother, I added a taste of siracha and a taste of Frank's hot pepper sauce, those are the only changes I made, over rice and a salad on the side. Thank you so very much, really enjoyed making these!!

I tried making this recipe exactly as posted but could not get over the cider vinegar taste, as it was very strong. If I make this again I will most likely half the amount of vinegar in this recipe.

Found this recipe about a year ago. It's a HIT!!! my family loves it and I now make it often. I use ground turkey or chicken sometimes and cut back on the sugar. Either way is yummy!

I have made this several times now...and only begrudgingly give it 4stars because I did add/make a few changes. I add peppers and onions to the sauce and then put everything in the slow cooker on lows for a few hours and let the flovours develop. The men in the house request this one often. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

Easy recipe but the Meatballs and sauce came out tasting too bland for my taste. May experiment with in the future.

Amazing recipe. I used lean ground turkey meat and no egg or bread crumbs. I’m gluten sensitive. Froze the meatballs for a bit before browning them. Added a touch of pepper. It turned out fantastic. Served over plain brown rice.

These were a big hit as a Thanksgiving appetizer!  Everyone loved them.  I tripled the recipe and they still disappeared!  I also used cider vinegar for one batch and regular white vinegar for another.  The regular vinegar was much better.  I baked the meatballs at 350 for 20 minutes.  I brought the sauce to a boil on medium-high heat then reduced the heat until it was the desired thickness.  They turned out great.

A tip: I always find that just ground beef can have a tendency of being too dry. I use equal parts ground beef, pork and veal. Trust me you will never have a dry meatball again!

3.5 star as is. 5 star with half the sugar and an extra dash of soy sauce. I also added 2 dashes of war sauce to the meatball mix with fresh chopped parsley. Served with plain white rice and steamed asparagus...will make again with these changes.

excellent sauce-- it would  be good w/ chicken or pork.   I used frozen  meatballs -- I also put a can of chunk pineapple w/ juice ,  chopped onion   red pepper,  sliced carrots serve  over jasmine rice --- I  did use rice vinegar  and only had 1/4 cup and  rest cider - I think white vinegar be milder   - I had  to put some extra sugar -- just a tad w/ vinegar taste but don't leave out -  you need it   - I use only 1/4  c. ketchup   but  I  will be making this sauce  again  -  delicious  homemade sweet and sour base sauce

This was a really good dish with bold flavors. I followed other reviews and halved the amount of vinegar (used white vinegar), added a can of pineapple tidbits with the juice and some Mrs. Dash onion and herb spice. Overall I was very happy with the dish and will be making it again.

Yummy! I line baking sheets with parchment paper and bake them all at once.....usually for about 12 minutes. Be careful not to overbake - makes them dry.  Then put them in the sauce in the slow cooker on low for a few hours.

Easy to make and my family, which includes teens... loved this recipe. The only change is that I added dried parsley, garlic powder and dried oregano to the plain breadcrumbs before mixing into ground beef.  I also used regular distilled white vinegar in place of the cider vinegar.  The sauce was so good and I'm thinking about using it for chicken too.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is really great.  I ended up substituting the water with grape juice that I needed to use up and it made the sauce too sweet--I should have cut back on the sugar.  I also added a bit of mustard and a few spices to the meatballs.  Overall, easy and yummy!

I normally don't like ketchup based sauces but this was pretty good. I only had white vinegar and adjusted the amount based on other reviews. I started with 1 TBSP as per one suggestion but was too weak so I added about 3 TBSP in total and was delish!

The cider vinegar overwhelms it a bit. I think i would reduce it a bit or do 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 cider. 1/4 cup each.

These meatballs and sauce were very good.  I'll use the recipe again.  I made the following changes.  I used venison instead of beef, added 4 cloves of garlic minced, also a couple pinches of Chinese 5 spice seasoning for the meatballs.  For the sauce I used garlic scape white vinegar instead of the vinegar listed.  As for cooking I fried the meatballs in lard and after adding the sauce I cooked it til it was the thickness I liked - didn't time it at all.  We had buttered noodles and applesauce to go with the meatballs and entire family was happy with meal.

This is my go-to recipe for sweet and sour meatballs. I make it exactly as written, cook them in an electric skillet, and serve over white rice. Absolutely delicious.

This recipe was really good. I would grate the onions not chop them. The onions were a bit big but I will  make this recipe again.

Its a sweet and sour sauce so it is going to be sweet and sour.  I made it exactly according to the recipie other than adding some chopped red and yellow peppers and some shirachia.  Did not find it had too much vinegar.  Used the sauce over frozen meatballs which makes it a super fast dinner

Love this recipe. Its easy to make and my family loves it. I tend to not put as much vinegar in it though. With the recommended amount I think it tastes too much like vinegar.

this was far from the first time I've made this recipe and I love it every single time! I don't eat beef or pork so I make it with ground chicken or turkey instead. I didn't adjust a single thing when making it this time except for being a little short on cider vinegar so I topped it off with white vinegar. I couldn't tell the difference

Made just the sauce with packaged meatballs. I loved it and could not stop eating them. Made sauce in a sauce pan exactly as directed but with Apple cider vinegar( didn't know there was a difference between cider vinegar) and loved it. Great over rice!!! I will get to the meatballs eventually and I'm sure I'll add something to make them a bit more flavorful.

Excellent flavour. I've made these several times and sometimes make changes, although they are great as is. I usually add a grated carrot to the meatballs for extra  nutrition, and have substituted green onions for regular onion. A family favorite!

Everyone loved these meatballs. I did add carrots and pineapple chunks that I had on hand and needed to use up. I will definitely be making this dish again and again!

I made these but IMO the recipe calls for too much breadcrumbs.  My meatballs were falling apart and were also very bland.

Pretty good. I made a couple alterations to mine.  Instead of water I used apple juice. cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 C. the first time I made it. the 2nd time I made it I still substituted the water with apple juice. However the 2nd time instead of brown sugar I used a small can of crushed pineapple and eyeballed in a couple tablespoons of old fashioned molasses. and I loved it the 2nd time. the deeper flavor of the molasses really added in another layer of flavor I think was missing.

I used 1/3 C APPLE CIDER VINEGAR & doubled the soy sauce & used 2/3 C sugar instead of a whole cup.  Came out great, my picky kids say it's delicious.

Made this last night and made a couple changes.. Added only 1/8 cup brown sugar and about 3 tbsp of white vinegar (thats all I had on hand). My son enjoyed it, however I felt it was quite sweet and that it was missing something. For as simple and as easy as this recipe was I'd make it again but I'll definitely be tweaking it up.

Good basic sauce recipe. Add orange zest! It really makes a difference. I halved the sauce and it was plenty saucy for 6 servings with extra sauce to pour over rice. I used a quarter of the brown sugar (so if you make the full recipe, use half). If you use as much sugar as the recipe calls for, it'll taste like candy. I used apple cider vinegar and I quartered that as well (again, if you're making the full recipe, use half). You can always taste the sauce and add more sugar or vinegar but if it's too sweet or vinegary, you can't go back and the whole thing will be ruined. I made my own meatballs (just mixed half a pound of Italian sausage and half a pound of ground turkey) and lightly sauteed an onion, a red bell pepper and a yellow bell pepper. Overall, a good dish.

This is a fantastic recipe and definitely has the taste I remember from my childhood. I did make a few changes the second time I made it: I added grated onion and some paprika, garlic powder, and pepper to the meatballs, cut down the sugar and vinegar by about 40% and threw in a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, a few dashes of hot pepper sauce and a teaspoon of molasses! So all in all it was a departure from the original recipe but I liked it better with the changes. My husband likes it with fries!

used Rice Krispies cereal (for a lighter texture) instead of bread crumbs and added an extra cup of cereal. Also added a clove of minced garlic. The sauce is pretty good, next time I think I'll add pineapple tidbits and diced bell peppers.

I loved this! Super easy and pretty quick. I used wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar and it still tasted just like sweet and sour meatballs from a restaurant. I will definitely recommend this to others.

Very good, my first try at anything Sweet & Sour. I did use seasoned bread crumbs, thanks to a review I read. Used regular white vinegar. Also the only type of 'ground beef' I use is either caribou, musk-ox or moose. My 5 yr. old loved the sauce, but I thought it was a lil on the sweet side, but still very good.

Great recipe for a sweet and sour sauce! It is sweet but the kids love it.  I use white vinegar in place of cider vinegar and usually half all of the ingredients for the sauce as the original recipe makes a lot of sauce, however if your family loves lots of extra sauce then that may be the way to go.  Additionally, my family is not a fan of onions so we omit these and also add garlic powder and seasoning salt to the meatballs.

Pretty good, but I did make a few modifications. I used Panko bread crumbs because that's what I had, only used half an onion, added some ground ginger and garlic powder, cut the amount of vinegar to 1/4 cup, and used 3 tablespoons of soy sauce.

Wow, how easy. I thought meatballs where all ways hard :D They tasted amazing, maybe the sauce was a little too sweet if anything. My little brother requested, no, demanded I make them again. Thanks for the recipe, I'll make sure to make it again ;)

This recipe is fantastic! It turns out great every time I make it, and I have yet to meet a picky eater who doesn't love it. I do make a few changes though, first of all, I make this with ground turkey instead of ground beef. I use Italian flavored bread crumbs, they are really emphasized as a flavor with the turkey and makes the dish more flavorful. Second, I followed the suggestions of some other people, I use half the amount of vinegar (1/4 cup instead of 1/2) and substitute white vinegar for cider vinegar. Try it! You won't be disappointed.

I used prepared meatballs but made the sauce pretty much as written (cut down the amounts but kept proportions the same) and really enjoyed it! I really like vinegar-y tastes but my boyfriend does not but we were both happy so I'd say the proportion of vinegar was right on. Will try a little less sugar next time maybe with some hot sauce.

This is an excellent recipe. My second time making it, and I added coarsely chopped green and yellow bell peppers when browning the meat. I also think 1/2 an onion is plenty - be sure to chop finely or use the food processor. Yummy sauce!

These didn't taste bad but I was definitely a disappointed.  The meatballs themselves are a little bland and the sauce didn't really come out thick enough.

AWESOME!  Made a couple changes.  I had no eggs so I used 1 cup water in a double batch and garlic powder to taste and with the sauce I used worchestershire in place of soy sauce plus I found it didn't need cornstarch to thinken up.  Wow!  It was totally tastie!! =)

I thought the cider vinegar was too strong. My husband wouldn't touch just from the smell. It tasted okay. This is not something I will make again.

I made these meatballs last night for a party and they were a hit!!  I made some mods though, added some grated nutmeg and fish sauce to the meatballs as well as some hot pepper, which I think helps balance the sweetness of the sauce.  I also added some fish sauce to the sauce.  Great recipe and real bonus to my cocktail party.

The recipe is good, but keep in mind while mixing the burger to add in italian seasoning.  the recipe as it stands here comes out pretty bland, but the overall meat and sweet and sour is solid.

Great recipe! I have made it several times with great success. Instead of bread crumbs, I add herb seasoned stuffing mix, I also add 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper for some spice. **also works well if you brown the meatballs and the finish everything off in a crock pot.

After burning the meatballs using my usual recipe, I tried this one.  One reason I tried it was because I had all the ingredients as part of my regular pantry.  This recipe was fast, easy and tasted great.

I just tried this tonight and it was crazy good! Being a health nut i made a few alterations to it like using splenda instead of sugar and using an egg white instead of a whole egg. The end result was still awesome. Can't wait to finish off the leftovers.

It was surprisingly very good.  I did cut the vinegar to 1/3 c. as I don't like much vinegar. And I did use apple cider vinegar because that's what I had and it turned out fine.

I just made the sauce and dumped in some frozen swedish meatballs. Added red pepper slices and had to muck around a little with the vinegar/sugar ratio but it turned out fantastic.  My wee ones loved it and have asked for it again.  Awesome, quick, and easy recipe.

I love meatballs and am always looking for new recipes. This was easy to prepare (though the prep time was much longer than stated) and smelled delicious. I did find the meatballs rather bland but then this dish is really all about the sauce! I will make these again but with some tweeking. I found the sauce a bit too sweet (even using 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 tangy bbq sauce). But the consistency was great - like something you would find in a restaurant.

These are so easy and so good! They are the only kind of meatballs my kids will eat and they get excited when they see them on the menu. Definitely on the rotation at our house. I also always use apple cider vinegar 'cause that's what is in my cupboard and they turn out just fine. It's a keeper!

These are some of the best sweet and sour meatballs I've ever had. Everyone in my family has their own way of making them, but by far, these are the winner. Serve them over Thai Jasmine Sweet Rice and it's an easy meal for any occasion. We actually served them as an appetizer at my High School Graduation reception.

D/H loved (surprise!).  After all the discussion on the vinegar, I was very leery.  Started with 1/4 cup but found it bland so added the remainder--it was fine--and I don't consider myself a lover of strong flavors. Also, cider vinegar is a little more mellow than white vinegar.

Very tasty - an excellent sweet/sour sauce.  I made some slight changes to the meatballs: only 1/2 of a large red onion, chopped VERY fine (almost like grated) and 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs. I used only 1/2 cup brown sugar in the sauce and next time may decrease the vinegar a bit, too.  I made 15 meatballs from the recipe and used 9 for the sweet/sour sauce, will freeze the extra six to have with tomato pasta sauce and spaghetti.

delicious recipe with a couple of simple modifications! for the meatballs i only used 1/2 of a chopped onion and seasoned my bread crumbs with parsley, garlic powder, and italian seasoning. for the sauce i used white vinegar rather than cider and cut way back on the amount, using only 2 T. i also used only 1 T cornstarch and only 3/4 cup brown sugar. any more sugar would have been much too sweet (even for me-and i LOVE sweets!) i baked the meatballs for 30 min at 350 and then put them in a crockpot with the prepared sauce as well as sauteed carrots, green peppers and onions. i let it all simmer on low in the crockpot, stirring gently and frequently, for about 2 hours and served it all over brown rice. it was wonderful!! i will definitely be making this one again and again!

I made these for dinner and my family loved them. I had been trying to find a recipe for meatballs for the longest time and now this will be a usual for dinner. The only thing that i had to add was salt to the sauce and more vinegar because it was just too sweet but other than that it was great thanks for the recipe.

This is a great recipe. I am in search of the meatball recipe that will make my fiance go "wow!" and he gave this a 8 out or 10. I gave it 5 stars though because it is delicious. The only thing I did differently was to use regular vinegar instead of cider because I did not have any.

I was very impressed with this recipe! I did half the cider vinegar as others recommended.  I browned the meatballs then stuck them in the crock pot for when we returned home a few hours later.  They were a great hit! The only problem is I can't stop eating them:)

Thinly slice carrots and green pepper and simmer in sauce as it thickens. If using frozen meatballs, heat in the microwave before adding to sauce.

The only thing I changed was the vinegar. Soemone suggested   1 tablespoon but I felt that was too little as the sauce was too sweet and didn't have enough tangy sour to it. I think I will try with 2 or 2 1/2 next time.

Loved this recipe, and my husband has asked that it go into the rotation.  I actually didn't have any vinegar, so I used pineapple juice (along with chunks) and a bit of lemon juice for the tang, and it turned out just fine.  I also cut back on the brown sugar, as the pineapple juice added some sweetness.  On top of it all, I didn't have any soy sauce, so I added some salt to make up for it.  That is the best thing about this recipe...you can substitute and mix it up, and it still turns out great!

Awesome sauce! That IS exactly how sweet and sour is supposed to taste and I've tried and made maybe 25 different varieties and this is a top 3 sauce of mine now. Keep it all the same if you are a S&S fan.

My husband requests these meatballs all the time, and they are a quick dinner. Also good to double the recipe and bring to a party for appetizers. Definitely use seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the regular.

The only changes I made were to cook the sauce down to thicken it, instead of using cornstarch and making the meatballs pretty small. Sauces thickened with cornstarch break and get watery easily, and I wanted to use these as mini meatballs for bento style lunches.

The sauce was a little sweet, but very good- in the lunches I packed 6 half-inch meatballs for the kids (8 for me) with an onigiri and assorted veggies. The little bit of sauce that was left in the container was great for dipping the veggies in.

This is a perfect recipe for bentos or lunch, but for dinner I would cut back on the sugar to about half a cup.

We thought these were superb.  However, I did cheat, I used store bought meatballs because I was pressed for time and that I did not have any of my homemade frozen meatballs left. I always make a bunch cook them in the oven then freeze theme in individual meal servings. All I have to do is make the sauce and that takes just a few minutes. We really liked the flavor of the sauce and there was plenty of it to pour over rice. Thanks Cathy.

This recipe is very very good!  Maybe a little too strong vinegar smell, but the flavor is very good.  The meatballs may need some texture...  Hmmm..  But it's all placed out very well!  Everyone enjoys it.

I made a healthier version of this recipe and everyone in my family loved it!(even my dad,which believe me was a surprise) I replaced beef with turkey and used egg whites only.The sauce was incredible. It made more than I expected,but it made for some great leftovers. You can use this for a turkey burger recipe to.

Highly recommended. I agree with some of the other reviews that the recipe tastes a bit heavy on the vinegar side. Nevertheless, after dipping my finger in the sauce my first words were "Yumeeee!". This would definitely make a great appetizer!

Family loved it.  At first i thought the sauce might be too tart as the vinegar made my eyes water while it cooked.  I ended up pleasantly surprised though because there was a good balance between sweet and sour.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  I cut the sauce recipe in half because it makes so much, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  Loved it!

These meatballs were very easy to make, just remember to allow yourself some prep time. One onion was way to much and next time, I'll use less bread crumbs. Some of the meatballs fell apart while browning, so make sure that they're compact when you shape them. The sauce was perfect and had the greatest flavor. Yummy!

This recipe was so EASY & so DELICIOUS!  The only thing that I did differently was chop up some garlic really fine and add it to the meatballs and of course baked them in the over for about 45 mins.  They turned out great, and lots of leftover sauce for adding to your rice!  I would make this recipe again and again....just because they were so good!

These meatballs were really great,  a real family favorite.  I made mine in the oven instead of a skillet but they were still wonderful.  Will use this recipe many times in the future.

Incredible! I've made this recipes about four times & each time my husband couldn't get enough. The sauce is fantastic, though it does have a bit of a bite from the vinegar. I plan on using Chubbycheeks idea & use the sauce over chicken. Leftovers also warm up nicely in a microwave.

It was quick, good tasting, kid's loved it. We had company over and we tripled it and it was completely gone. The kids gobbled it down. I think this is an excellent meal for any one looking for a quick, easy, delicious meal.

These were great!  We didn't have bread crumbs on hand, but substituted crushed Ceasar salad croutons...the flavour they added was fabulous.  We'll definitely be making this over and over again.

Make meatballs small enough(so you get more!) to serve as a finger food at a cocktail party. DELICIOUS!

My family loved these Sweet and Sour Meatballs. The only changes I made was in adding onion soup mix to the ground beef mixture, for added flavour; and I cooked the meatballs first in the oven on a greased cookie sheet so they wouldn't stick together in the pan.

Yum YUM Yum!! My husband and 17 month old
son love these tasty little meatballs!!

Very easy to make also.. just rolling the
meatballs takes a little time.  I usually
make extra sauce and use it over chicken
too!!
