I've made this several times, but most recently for Easter dinner.  My husband really likes it a lot....I enjoy it too and it's a nice change from your typical boring side dish (i.e. mashed potatoes & a can of veggies!). The first time I made it exactly as stated, but subsequently I've made a couple of changes: (1)omit the celery....it has enough celery flavor from the soup alone and we're not huge celery fans anyhow (2)used a tad more cheese as we are definite cheese-a-holics.  I will make this again & again.

This was okay.  I think the recipe would be better with garlic, ground pepper, and sliced mushrooms, as well as broken cracker pieces on top.  I also think that fresh broccoli might be better than frozen (although of course more work).  I didn't cook the celery long enough, so it was too crunchy for my taste (I strongly dislike raw, crunchy celery).  I also think that there are better options than American cheese - if you're going to consume all the calories loaded into cheese, it's my opinion that a tasty cheese will make those calories more worthwhile.  I feel that a better option would be Swiss, sharp cheddar, gouda, feta, or parmesan.  American cheese is too bland and not worth the calories!

I wanted something for Thanksgiving other than boring old green bean casserole, so we made this. It was great! I used most of a head of fresh broccoli, cut into small florets, and closer to 1/2 cup of cheese for maximum cheesiness. It turned out really good...so good that I snuck down later that night to finish off the leftovers.

I had this at my sister's.  She added more salt than was called for & it was delicious!  Even my picky children loved it.  I plan to make it over & over!

I made this for Christmas 2001.  What a hit!  My nephew asked me to give the recipe to his mom because she doesn't cook this good at home.  A definite keeper!

Great!  I had some fresh broccoli on hand so that is what I used.  I also only had long grain rice so I made it first and then continued on with the recipe.  I added some minced garlic, garlic powder, and pepper to the mixture.  I also added more cheese.  I ended up with more than what the 1 1/2 quart baking dish would hold so I just used a bigger dish.  This was really a great dish and I will definitly be making it again and again!

Yummie- I added to this some left over chicken cut up and I only had one can of soup so I added a can of milk.  Also, I don't have instant rice so I used long grain and cooked it as on the package, then went from there.  It was very tastey, although I think it would be better with the 2 cans of soup.

Good, however, we like more zip by adding a can of green chilies or substituting the cheese with Jalopeno Cheez Whiz.

It is easy, and smells so delicious when it's cooking.  But for some reason I thought the taste was just 'okay'.

Very good recipe.  I used fresh broccoli, and it turned out great.  Very creamy, could have used a bit more of the cheese, and maybe a bit less of the soup, but overall really good.

This was a good casserole, and you do have to cook it for the entire hour in order for the cheese to melt... Thanks.

I used 1 1/2 cups fresh broccoli and doubled the cheese.  It was very good and a nice switch from a potato or pasta side.  It would be good for a pot luck.

I really like this recipe, although it doesn't usually go over very well with my two young children. I usually omit the onion because I don't seem to miss it when it's not there. I also recommend using an 8 oz package of velveeta and melting it before mixing it in. When I just dice the cheese, it clumps together in the casserole and makes the flavor inconsistent.

Great and simple to put together! I think I would add chopped leftover ham to it to make a main dish of it.

This was great but I changed it a bit. Instead of cream of celery I added cream of broccoli (that's what I had) and instead of the american cheese I used shredded Cheddar and just mixed it in. The kids loved this as well as hubby and I will make this again. Thanks

A nice change from just a side of rice or broccoli. I thought this was good, but also average in taste.

This recipe tasted very good.  I used lowfat processed cheese and although it didn't melt as well as regular, it tasted fine.  The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I've had slightly better versions.  This is perfectly acceptable, though.

So good-it is important to cut the processed cheese into really tiny cubes in order to ensure it melts properly throughout the casserole.
