In historical circles we call these  "stoved potatoes, or stovies". They are indeed a treat and go well with any meat recipe. They can be "kicked up" for serving with beef by adding a tablespoon of horseradish to the cooking pot. Adding grated onion also adds a kick. Great treat for those who love potatoes.

Great! I do recommend leaving the lid off and letting the water boil out and the potatoes get a little crusty. These were yummy and a big hit!

These were quite good.   I took the lid off and let my skillet go dry for the last 5-10 minutes, this crisped up the skins a little.

OK, I'm a big fan of potatoes, so I had to try this recipe. I'm an experienced cook, so I figured this simple recipe would be a piece of cake. Well, it is. BUT ... it took me two tries to get it right. For anyone who has poor results on the first try, I say try again! You may have to play with the level of heat (that's what I needed to do) to get great results. But when you get it right, MAN, THESE TATERS ARE GOOD! I was just popping them in plain, without even adding butter. The crispy outside and fluffy inside make these really, really good. Definitely worth a second chance.

I made this for dinner last night and guess what?  It tasted like, um.....cooked potatoes!  I followed the recipe exactly and they never made a peep.  Not even a whimper, much less a scream.  They'd have to sing a little song and do a little dance before I'd bother with this again.

Kevin clearly stated you needed a cast iron skillet for this recipe.  I didn't use one and they didn't turn out correctly.  This is mostly a warning that you must use a cast iron skillet for this recipe to work.

I, too, do not have a cast iron pan.  I grew up using them, but alas, they are all still in Oregon with my mom.  And I do not have access to them, but I decided to use my nonstick pans anyway with the thought they would not turn out the same as advertised.  And, no, they didn't, but I'm okay with that.  They actually cook pretty well this way, even in a nonstick pan--they turn out very soft and buttery, and the salt flavors the potatoes almost like the Salt Potatoes I've tried--but with way less salt.  I also put in some dried rosemary and parsley, and I liked them that way.  I had to cook a bit longer--about 10 minutes more, but I knew they were done when one potato pretty much fell apart in the pan.  Nice potatoes, and easy--just don't expect a crisp outer shell  in a nonstick pan.  I also don't know what the "screaming" is all about--maybe they are "screaming good"?  Not a clue, but thanks for the recipe!

These potatoes are the best; I did not have a tight fitting lid, so I dissolved salt in water and added more as it evaporated. They turned out wonderful!

Simply the best potatoes!! I ususally make them with dry onion soup mix, but these were soooo much better.  My husand could not stop eating them!  He kept picking on them after we finished our meal.  I will most definately make them again. Have to admit, I got nervous that they were not going to crisp up so I drained the pan and transferred to a sheet pan and put in the oven at 400 for a while after cooking on the stove.

Mine were screaming, "were done!" after 1/2 the time called for ;).  These are good potatoes, especially considering how easy they were to make.  I do however think that they could use a bit of kick, maybe some sliced jalapenos in the skillet would do the trick-  Thanks Kevin!

So very easy and so very delicious.  I used a nonstick pan and did not get that "crunchiness" as described but we didn't miss it.  My husband repeatedly said how good they were.  Take the advice of the description and just try it - you will be surprised!  Thank you for this recipe, this will become a staple in our house!

They didn't scream, nor did they crisp and they were just so-so. Not worth the effort.

I like this recipe and will try again.
I didn't have kosher salt on hand and substituted 1 tables. of sea salt with
over salty results.  The skins didn't crispin so at the end I removed lid and cooked awhile longer.  At very end added butter, minced garlic, parsley and pepper.  Thanks for sharing Kevin.

I made this as stated, other than adding 1/2 the salt.  Used my cast iron frying pan and had the burner at med-low for about 40 min.  They were done perfectly, only, I never heard any "screaming" so I'm not sure what that's about.  My only complaint?  I wish I'd made more!

We loved these potatoes!  The insides were the fluffiest we've ever had.  I used a non-stick pan and it worked just fine.  I'll definitely keep this recipe.

I must have done something wrong because my potatoes came out more like boiled new potatoes without the crunchy outer crust that was supposed to be there.  I used a cast iron skillet on an electric ceramic top stove - don't know if that makes a difference.  I'd like to try these again though to see if I can get them right.

Really good.  I used a non-stick skillet and the bottoms were brown and crusty, while the insides was perfectly tender.  I thought I would need more spices than salt, but keeping it simple allows you to taste the potato flavor.  I used Eastern potatoes (which are larger), cut them, and put them flesh side down in the pan.  Because my potatoes lied flat, I couldn't get the other sides to brown.  If I have large potatoes next time, I'll put them skin side down and attempt to flip them over when I shake the pan.

I must have added too much water because they didn't have any crunchiness to them.  But they were steamed very nicely.  I don't prefer to use cast iron, but I tried it for this recipe.  I think I will use a different cooking method in the future, such as steaming with herbs.  My husband thought they were good too, but nothing special.

I wanted something different to do with some Michigan red potatoes I had purchased at the local farmer's market. I cooked the potatoes as instructed. At the end of the time, I added some margarine,  garlic powder and black pepper to the potatoes and rolled them around in the salty mixture to coat them. I then let them cook for about another 5 minutes. They screamed. They weren't crispy. But, they were delicious!!! My husband (with his finicky self) actually loved them.  I'll definitely do these again.

Absolutely loved these potatoes! I own a 12" cast iron skillet with a cast iron lid, so I was fully equipped. The creaminess of the potatoes was remarkable. It reminded me of Syracuse Potatoes, without the effort! When these were done, I removed the 'tators from the pan, scraped out the larger salt "formations" and threw in a half stick of butter. As it was melting in the residual heat, I returned the potatoes to the pan, tossed them around and sliced each in half, and then flipped all the halves cut side down. I'd made a pork roast with sauerkraut and kielbasa, and we served ourselves right from the stove top (steamed and buttered broccoli rounded out the meal). Great meal, and I've made these screaming potatoes twice since then. Thanks for a real keeper, Kevin!

Effortless and tasty. Served with butter, the potatoes were deliciously creamy with crispy skins. I will be making these often.

So simple and so easy! The key is a well-cured cast iron skillet and use yukon gold or red potatoes. The skins come out crispy, yet the inside is firm and moist. Definitely slather in butter and sprinkle some chopped herbs to dress 'em up a little. Great recipe!

These tasted like little baked potatoes....not exactly what I was looking for.  They tasted good with gobs of butter, but didn't have much flavor straight out of the pan.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I am glad it is being shared here.  We love these potatoes.  Sometime we make them with Mrs. Dash added with the salt, but they are great with just the kosher salt.  They can also be made in a non stick pan and turn out great.

Delicious.. I recommend turning them one time during cooking as soon as there is a crust on one side and maybe you need a bit higher heat. The person who gave a bad review clearly didn't do it right, I bet they thought they could substitute a regular skillet for cast iron because it is impossible to cook with cast iron and not have crispy edges, this is why we like cast iron. And they did squeal a little after I turned them

Made as directed, exactly. They were ok. Not extraordinary, but a way to cook them without watching over them. Tastewise, I agree with the reviewer who said they tasted like potatoes.  After tasting, I added some seasoning along with the butter, and that helped; otherwise, bland but for the salt. Also made a salt lick on the bottom of my pan, so I had to scrub that off. Too bad the peels weren't crispy.

Absolutely delicious!  I added fresh rosemary and onions, the potatoes were infused with flavor.  Nice not to have to turn on the oven in the summer.  This will definitely be a house favorite.

I used a good heavy deep dish pan (because i didn't have a good sized cast iron skillet on hand) and small russet potatoes, added about a tablespoon of butter, sprinkled with an unknown amount of salt and granulated garlic, and they came out great.

Served with butter and chives, even better.  It really was worth the try :)  Definitely will make again (and there's so many ways to customize it).

very good! I used regular red potatoes, (didnt have new potatoes on hand) and they were great, so tender. I used cast iron skillet with glass lid, so I could "watch" them, cooked for about an hour on low. Can only imagine how good new potatoes would be! So easy, love the fact that I can put them on and leave it to attend to other things.

I cooked them in olive oil and used sea salt instead of kosher salt. They were quite addicting. If I can ever keep myself from eating them right off of the skillet, then next time I will top them shredded cheese, sliced marinated jalapeno, scallions, bacon bits and sour cream -then serve them to my hubby or guest on the skillet with a couple of beers.

My skins didn't come out crunchy.  Also, had to mix up the potato on my plate to "mix in" the salt flavoring.  Was too salty just to eat a bite with the skin.

5, 5, 5. This recipe is simple, inexpensive, and surprisingly DELICIOUS! I couldn't understand how something with so few ingredients could taste so awesome. Try this, if you cook it correctly, you will surely love it.
