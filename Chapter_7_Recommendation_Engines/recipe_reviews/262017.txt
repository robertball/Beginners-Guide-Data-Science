FillCooked this for my Korean son-in-law. He and all of us loved it. He sliced a cucumber to dip in the yummy sauce. The cool with the heat is excellent. Served the ribs with rice and a no-mayo slaw, perfect meal! Canâ€™t wait to make again!

Unfortunately, I used country style pork instead of ribs.  I also did not use the beer.  My bad.  The sauce was excellent but the meat was very dry.  Better not to substitute.  Try it with BBQ cabbage wedges drizzled with garlic oil if you don't care for rice.

Amazing! This is my first allrecipes recipe. The ribs  turned out delicious and didn't have that "porky" flavor, likely due to braising them in beer. We purchased the hot gochujang, which made them spicy. I made one rack and only needed 2 hrs in the oven. I finished the ribs under the broiler for a couple of minutes per side, watching closely the whole time.  I'm uploading a photo.

Super tender, a hit with the family. I thought it would be too spicy but it was not... just flavorful.    We did the broiler option instead of the grill.. 3 minutes on each side and it was great!
