Absolutely fabulous. No sundried tomatoes? Use Rotel just be sure to thoroughly drain the can using the can lid to squeeze any excess liquid within the tomatoes. I love this recipe and so did my husband. We actually don't use ground beef here but we used 93% 7% ground turkey and it was phenomenal. We also didn't have the provolone cheese which was okay because it was splendid. A must try recipe!!!!!

As written this is a decent recipe but with a few simple changes it's great! I added 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp rosemary 1 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. I like my meatloaf with a bit of a glaze on top so I brushed with ketchup mixed with Italian seasoning. Next time I will omit ketchup from meat mixture entirely and only use it in the topping. My only real complaint is with the texture- very crumbly. Next time I will omit the bread crumbs and replace with bread and milk. Sounds like a lot of changes but really the original recipe is pretty much intact. The provolone fresh basil and sun-dried tomatoes are right on the mark and I'll definitely be repeating this one!

Great flavor! Used 2 whole eggs instead of using only egg white. I will reduce to one egg next time as it was a bit crumbly. Excellent recipe that family loved.

Great Recipe. If you're only two people it's a big meatloaf. So I weigh out the whole recipe divide into four pieces cook one and freeze the others for future use.

Recipe was okay. Had to add seasoning because it was too bland.

Best meatloaf ever! My husband said he never wants to eat a different meatloaf recipe again. Followed almost exactly....except no bread crumbs so crunched up veggie straw chips (improvising at its finest lol). Also our grocery store didn t have shredded or block provolone....I cut up slices actually think it was better cause there was pockets of cheese. I baked in 4 mini loaf pans for 30 mins to speed it up. So flavorful and moist! Can t wait to make it again.

Not a bad recipe.  I added sausage to the filling.  Even with that I felt it was somewhat bland.  The family liked it though and I'll make it again and just see what I can add to bump up the flavor a little

It was pretty tasty although a bit too oniony for our taste. I'll probably make it again.
