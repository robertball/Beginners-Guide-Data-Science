For those, like me, who are relative wimps when it comes to mixed drinks and who don't really care for the strong taste of alcohol or overly sweet drinks, this one's for you!  While I do drink red wine regularly, and my beloved Chocolate Martini on Friday nights, I don't often venture beyond that. With an overabundance of Bailey's on my hands I came across this during an ingredient search and thought, what the heck!  And frankly, I didn't really expect to like it, I was just feeling curious and adventurous.  What a pleasant surprise! If you like Bailey's, I don't see how you could NOT like this.  For lack of a better way of describing it, it's like a milky, fizzy, "lite" but refreshing version of Bailey's.  Really nice! Kind of plain looking on its own, but a few chocolate shavings dressed it up real pretty.
