I just made these and they are great!  They remind me of pecan pie YUM.   I took the advice of some and cut down the brown sugar but I think I will follow the recipe exact next time (we like rich desserts).  I found the best way to do the crust was cut up the cold butter then mix it up with my hands.  For those who say it was a gooey mess then I think they just didn't bake it long enough.  They should come  out of the pan just like a bar cookie.  I will definately make these over the holidays.

I haven't made the Yum Yums yet but I am sure it is one that I have been looking for for years. I will get back and tell you. Bye for now
Sorry I didn't get back sooner but these were the Yums Yums I was looking for. My husband is so happy. His mo used to make them and no one in the family could find the recipe. Thankyou Dorothy

These came out WAY too sweet and WAY too mushy.  I was very disapointed and definitely will not make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe.  It worked out really well, although for my taste I found that the top was just too crispy for me.

This was an interesting recipe. The crust was quite moist and the topping was decent. I wasn't expecting this to be as "bready" as it was, however, it was a nice surprise. I will definitely consider making this again.

No stars if I could.  I actually went back and re-read the recipe to make sure I didn't screw it up.  These went straight into the garbage.  Gross.  Way too sweet, very mushy (and I cooked mine an extra 15-20 mins!) and the sugar never cooked!  It was still crystalized and crunched in your teeth as you ate them!!  We didn't even finish our servings.  What a waste of lovely ingredients.

I made these butter tart squares for my family today and although the kids loved them - hubs and I thought they were a touch on the sweet side. I did alter the recipe slightly by adding about 1/2 tsp salt to the wet ingredients, along with 1 tsp vanilla extract. These squares were dead easy to make...took less than 10 minutes to whip them together, and the end result is very decadent. A note to those who complained of the bottom being dry and crumbly, I let my squares cool completely in the pan before cutting...this is the trick to ensuring the flaky, buttery bottom doesn't fall apart on you! The next time I make these, I will eliminate the brown sugar from the base, and reduce the sugar in the filling by 1/4 cup.

Excellent bar recipe when the weather gets cooler and something moist and gooey is needed with you favorite hot beverage.  I didn't use the coconut, but used 1 cup of chopped pecans.  It tastes like pecan pie cookies.  My husband said, "You can make those again...anytime."

These treats are sweet, buttery, and chewy. The goodly amount of brown sugar, adds to the texture.  It's not a cookie that I will bake often, because of that boosted sweetness.  But, as long as they are made for "special occasions", these are treats that will be made for many years to come, because they truly are "yum-yummy".  I've watched a tray of these disappear in a New York minute!

They turn out way too mushy and gooey! They'd be great if you could actually get a hold of one and eat it.

These bars were GREAT!!!!  I did reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup but I still thought they were delicious!  I got so many compliments from my family and church members!  My college has these bars in their dining halls and I had been searching for the recipe. These are even better! Thank you, Janice!

very sweeeeeet!  Can't help but wonder if the amount of sugar is wrong in this one.  I cut brown sugar down to 1 cup and it is still too sweet.  Won't be making this again.
