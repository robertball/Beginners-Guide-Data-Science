This recipe works brilliantly and I have cooked artichokes for over 30 years.  However, the importance of choosing a proper artichoke cannot be overstated.  People often attribute a bad outcome to the recipe itself, without consideration of their own laxity in ingredient choice.  No recipe can fix a poor main ingredient but a good recipe can elevate a good ingredient to greatness, as I believe this recipe almost does. To finish the artichoke to greatness, cut in half and grill for 5 minutes over hot coals.

I made a dipping sauce of equal parts mayonnaise and sour cream, with chopped shallots, parsley, capers and some Worcestershire sauce. It brought the freekin' house down. This recipe rocks.

This recipe is amazing.  I've tried it with regular sea salt and kosher salt, and kosher salt is definitely the way to go.  Make sure that lemon juice gets on their fast, because they brown quickly.  

It's even better with baby artichokes, because you can eat the inner leaves whole.

This is a quick and easy way to cook an artichoke. Couldn't find commercial-grade foil, so I used three sheets of regular foil. Whole egg mayonnaise makes a fresh dipping sauce. I'll use this recipe again.

Since artichokes are my favorite food, I wanted to start trying alternate cooking methods. My favorite had been steamed, but boiled artichokes were my go-to since I don't actually have a steamer. When the dietician told me I needed to add some more good oils and fats into my diet, to include extra virgin olive oil, I found this recipe and tried it.

I do not cook my artichokes any other way now! I've made these dozens of times, and they're delicious! I usually use pepper instead of salt since I'm on a low-sodium diet, but both ways are wonderful. Sometimes I get adventurous and add oregano or other seasonings ;) Other than that, I follow the recipe, and it's amazing!

This is a great recipe.  I love garlic, therefore, I cut slices of a clove and insert in different area's of the artichoke vs 1 clove in the center.  I provides more flavor for the entire artichoke.

I've made these twice and they turned out amazing! Absolutely tender and flavorful. I use a dipping sauce of mayo and a few drops of sriracha. I followed the recipe exactly and it doesn't need any changes. Btw LOL to the lady to changed the cooking method and then rated this recipe 1 star for the artichokes getting too black. Where has all common sense gone?

Delicious. Chef John never dissapoints. It was my first time preparing artichokes and I was a little intimidated by them. This recipe is very easy with amazing results.

These were ok, but definitely not my favorite way to prepare artichokes.  Probably won't make them this way again.

This is a great easy recipe.  I will make often now.  It's very important to prepare your artichokes properly.  Gluten free Gigi gives an excellent artichoke prep video on you tube.   You MUST prep properly before proceeding with this recipe!

This was easy to make and did not get a bunch of dishes dirty, so I liked that about it.  The flavor was okay, not stellar but not bad.  However, the big negatives for us were the scent and the appearance of the artichokes.  I normally steam them and they end up a brighter green.  Using the roasting method, they came out dull colored and had a kind of stinky smell, both of which were unappealing.  I will probably not make this recipe again.

Fabulous! I will be sending this recipe to my sisters and neighbors and will NEVER again trim and boil artichokes.  Last night (Saturday) I followed the simple recipe, put the artichoke in the oven for an hour and watched a TV show; I then added a marinated piece of salmon on a grill pan and 15 minutes later they were both finished with minimal work on my part---and they were delicious!!

Delicious!  I can't wait to make these again. I added a pinch of crushed oregano and black pepper to the other ingredients, stir everything in a small bowl and then drizzle between the leaves with the garlic cloves in the center. I don't think I'll be steaming artichokes ever again. Thanks Chef John for a great recipe. Oh, and I've kept the cloves to use later on in something else!

I did core the artichokes removing as much of the choke as I could with a knife and then placed the garlic clove in the opening. Also made sure they were covered in lemon juice to prevent  discoloration.  They came out perfect and one guest had never had fresh artichokes.  She loves them.

For whatever reason I felt overwhelmed when I first read this recipe.  But after doing it once, I flew right through the preparation the second time around. I put the ingredients together in a different order which I feel helps my hands from getting all slimy from the olive oil. Garlic first,  lemon juice, salt, and lastly the olive oil. I also usually cut the garlic pieces into quarters, if they're large, and put one in the center, then the rest placed throughout  the leaves. It really is tasty. Great dipped in plain lemon juice if you want to avoid the fats. (Other than the drizzled olive oil).

Easy way to make artichokes! They turned out excellent, the salt is crucial. Also decided to add blue cheese at the last 5 minutes of cooking and it melted beautifully and melted between the leaves. Definitely will make this again!

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made artichokes this way several times now, and it is by far a favorite in my house. I sometimes tuck more garlic cloves into the artichoke. I have tried it with ghee, but prefer the olive oil. I usually make a curried aioli for dipping with mayo, toasted curry powder (whatever is on hand), and fresh lemon juice. It's so easy and fairly healthy, if you don't use as much mayo as I do.

These were unedible. I did make an adjustment to avoid using aluminum foil and put them in a covered dish. But at this temperature they were pretty blackened. I tried to eat the hearts, but they just didn't have any flavor.

I have never prepared fresh artichokes until this New Year's Eve.  They came out wonderful and I served them with drawn butter for dipping.  Also, spread the roasted garlic from inside of the artichokes on baguette slices.  I looked up how to cut and wrap the artichokes on you tube.  There's a good video that uses this recipe. Search 'how to roast artichokes".

This was the best way to make artichokes.  No messing boiling.  The taste was amazing.  Will make this way again soon.

I just use water and lemon juice.  The oil makes the leaves very slippery.  The garlic takes away from the subtle artichoke flavor, so I leave that out too. Other than that the artichokes come out perfectly each time.

I am growing artichokes in my garden and I made this with my first harvest of the season.  I also grow Meyer lemons so it was naturally the right move.  I added a few cracks of pepper to this recipe.  It was amazing.  I have to add that a fresh picked artichoke has such tenderness and freshness.  Best artichoke dish I have ever had!!

I will give this five stars, but I deviated from the original recipe. The only thing I did not change was the olive oil. I did not use lemon, it is unnecessary. I “core” my artichokes before roasting. This way there is less work and more time for eating while hot. First, cut off the end of each leaf with kitchen shears and the full top of the artichoke with a knife. Open wide and scoop out the center of the heart to get all the prickly center removed. This is done easily under running water. Cut the end of the stem off, but leave most of it because there is a lot of edible meat in the stem. Dry off then drizzle with olive oil. Add sea salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic powder making sure to get in between all the leaves and center. Wrap in foil. I think the time and temp is too high and long. I roast at 375 degrees for 1 hour. You can test the tenderness in the stem. If the stem is cooked through, it is done. I use a melted butter sauce for dipping. I usually add a little hot sauce to the butter, a nice jalapeño hot sauce really makes it delicious!  So overall good base recipe. Enjoy a Hagandaaz ice cream bar for dessert!

I love artichokes and have never cared for the recipes with bread crumbs or steaming them. I followed this recipe as written. EXCELLENT!! Dipped the leaves in a little olive oil and garlic. Will definitely be my "go to" artichoke recipe.

Simple and fool-proof recipe with okay results. I love garlic so I used at least three cloves per artichoke, and distributed around the entire thing (not just in the centre). Even more garlic would have been good, for my taste.

Very simple! I added 3 or 4 garlic cloves to each. I also mixed the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper and granulated garlic together before pouring over the artichokes. Came out tender and flavorful.

So easy!  And delicious - we didn't need a dipping sauce because it was already full of flavor.   The leaves were buttery and soft.  It tasted so decadent. The video was very helpful.

I never give any chef John recipe less than 5 stars so it pains me to give this one a 2 star rating. I followed the instructions exactly as written but we really didn’t care for this. The artichokes were really tough, so not sure if I should have roasted them longer? Flavor was pretty bland too. Back in the day, I would have melted a stick of butter to dip them in, but I’m trying to eat healthier and was hoping to learn of a better way. This was not it for me.

This was my first time cooking an artichoke, it was rather disappointing.  I think if I had cooked it another 20 mins or so, it may have been more tender.  As it was, it had the celery like sheds left after chewing for a while.  Texture aside, it was still rather bland.  I will try again with a different recipe.

This is really nice and simple recipe. However if I ll do it next time I will cut the artichoke in half then remove all the inner fibers/pistils then cook in the same way. It will help to enjoy when eating. My husband didn’t like it just because he found it hassle to eat.

Not sure what happened, but the artichokes were never tender.  I followed the recipe exactly, even gave it another 20 minutes, so an hour and 40 minutes.  The leaves looked soft, but couldn't pull off the meaty part of leaf with your teeth like usual.  I have had a couple fluke bad artichokes in my day, so maybe it was that. I will never know.  We could not eat these.  The recipe looked great and I sure wanted it to work, but did not this try.

This intensified the artichoke flavor which I didn't care for alone, until I dipped it in some mayo.

This was fantastic. It came out perfectly and the only thing I added on top was a little bit of truffle salt.  I would  absolutely make again.

while we did enjoy the recipe, this was just a little too time intensive for my liking.. but i'm used to making mine in the microwave with chicken broth.. which only takes about 20 minutes.. instead of putting whole garlic cloves i sliced mine up and wedged them in between the leaves.. the roasted garlic slices were my favorite part.. ty for the recipe

Thus recipe is good but I cooked it and it came out way too hard. I'd recommend trying it for an hour, maybe even less.

Made this recipe the other night..it was only fair. It tasted oily and we found that it didn't have very much taste. I had even added extra garlic. I will not use this recipe again.
