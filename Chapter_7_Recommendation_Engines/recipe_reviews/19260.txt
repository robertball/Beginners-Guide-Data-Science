I am absolutely shocked by the negative reviews.  Obviously, those folks didn't prepare them correctly.  They are flaky, crunchy - very similar to shortbread except cinnamon-y.  I get RAVES anytime I make these.  So, don't let the negative reviews keep you from trying these!!
These are not traditional cookies...they are supposed to be flaky, crunchy, NOT leavened ( so for heaven's sake don't add baking soda)  Make sure they are pressed out evenly.  And don't take them out too soon or they won't be crispy.  They are not supposed to be overly sweet either..sort of like Mexican Wedding Cookies.  The sweetness comes from he powdered sugar sprinkled on top.    So, if you want a super sweet, sugary cookie...this is NOT it! 
But, if you want to try something different and you love cinnamon and pecans...then give it a try! :-)

Sorry but I did not care  for these bars, they are much too sandy dry for my taste, even though they were easy to make. You also forgot to list the vanilla in your ingredients.

Dry . . . but . . . does taste good.  (Would make a good pie crust.)

These treats have been made in our family for 4 generations with a little variation from the recipe stated that might deal with some of those that were not wowed by what we have always called "cinnamon sticks".  Our recipe calls for 1 1/2 softened sticks of butter/margarine and only 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon.  We never added the vanilla extract but I will give it a try on the next batch.  Nor did we top with the confectioner's sugar.
What I always found the secret to be was to really work by hand the prepared dough until it is very moist all the way through.  I would then roll it out on the well-greased cookie sheet.  Yes, it will be very thin but as you press in the pecan pieces it rises up a little bit.  Watch them closely turning your pan half-way through the cooking time to get an even browning.  They can go from golden brown to well done very quickly so don't overcook.  Slice them into rectangles while hot in the pan and then remove with a spatula and let them cool on wax paper.

I decided to give this one a shot in spite of the quasi negative reviews... The bars did not hold together well and were very dry.  They also were not sweet at all.  Maybe another egg and another 1/4c sugar would fix it?

These cookie bars are not as good as they sounded.  I wonder what some baking soda would do.

TERRIBLE! Unfortunately, I rose early on a Sunday morning to make these for a funeral this afternoon.I prepared them exactly according to directions. They are way too short and crumble to pieces when removed from the pan. There is no way I can share these...

Loved this recipe.  It tastes similar to a short bread with cinnamon, topped with pecans and powdered sugar.   Everyone loved them.  Easy to make as well!

Took these dry, crumbly bars to a funeral and they were thrown out. The nuts were good. Double checked for mistakes or omissions but I followed the recipe. They looked ok....

I agree with the people who found this  cookie too dry.  I thought it tasted floury and not like a shortbread.  I did like the cinnamon flavor and will probably try it again with some alterations to make the base a little moister.
