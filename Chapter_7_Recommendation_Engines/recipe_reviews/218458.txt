This was absolutely delicious. I do not know why, but this recipe called to me to be poured over vanilla ice cream a la banana foster. I am so glad that I did. Although I did not change the recipe any, I did use an apple corer to core the pears (easier in my opinion). This also sliced them. One thing I would recommend though is use either less sugar or unsweetened orange juice. Otherwise it will be very sweet. All in all, a wonderful treat.

Taste was nice, but pears fell apart.  I could not core a pear without cutting it in half, so my pear did not look anything like the photograph.  Would not try this for guests without testing it ahead of time..  

I won't make this again.

This was delicious. On the suggestion of another reviewer, I used much less sugar - half quantities. I was also skeptical about the amount of vanilla extract - I've never used a recipe that called for TABLESPOONS rather than teaspoons of vanilla. So I used half quantity, but on tasting the juice decided to add the other half. What a difference it made! The extra vanilla really balanced the cinammon. I would recommend preparing the recipe the night before serving because the pear flavor really comes through. If you are a ginger lover, add some chopped crystallized ginger. It really complements the other flavors. Definitely a winning recipe!

I have never bothered to rate a recipe before, but this was so good I couldn't resist. I didn't have brown sugar, so I substituted a random amount of honey. This was spectacular.

I didn't have orange juice so I used 1 cup Hungarian apricot brandy and 1/2 cup water instead.  I also quartered the pears.  I served them over vanilla ice cream.  It was sweet but really yummy.

I quartered and cored the pears before cooking. They were so delicious on their own, but I also ate some with my morning oatmeal with a little of the syrup drizzled over. They would be awesome over waffles, pancakes or ice cream too! The tablespoon of vanilla really comes through in the final taste, and your house will smell great while the pears cook.

The amount of sugar is too much for me. I suggest reducing the sugar. As written the sugar masks the natural sweetness of the orange and pears. I made these into little Halloween rats for fun. Thank you for the recipe.

Elegant, simple and delicious! I like the orange juice alternative to the alcohol-based simmering stocks. Was surprised by the call for 1*tablespoon* vanilla, so only used 1 teaspoon--seemed a nice balance with the orange and cinnamon and didn't overwhelm the flavor of the pear... Will make again tonight for my mother!!

Delicious. I couldnâ€™t eat a whole one so cut them up to top ice cream. Had extra sauce that I saved to top ice cream too.

I made this for dessert tonight, after French onion soup and roast chicken. What a perfect ending to a great meal! I used the Splenda brand brown sugar blend and skipped the white sugar, but still excellent! All that was left was the stem!

I substituted honey for the sugar and added in some cloves to the poaching liquid.  I served it with coconut cream which helped cut the syrup.

This was a good recipe that was easy to make. I was looking for ways to enjoy fruit without having to buy processed fruit cups. The ingredients are usually in the pantry, so nothing special to buy. I think I would use less cinnamon next time, though.
