I combine both tandoori I and tandoori II for my chicken Tandoori. I use the yoghurt and lemon juice from I and combine it with all the spices in this one. Then I leave it in the fridge for about 3-4 hours and place it in the oven for an hour. 

I tried it the first time with the vege oil and vinegar on top of everything I mentioned here (from I) and forgot it this time, and I liked it better this time. 

This is wonderful over some rice, tho you need to keep your rice moist, as there is no sauce. It might be better over buttered noodles, I don't know.

If I make this again, I will add the yogurt and lemon juice.  The chicken was tender, but rather dry.

I made this with yogurt instead of oil and vinegar, and marinated it overnight.  It turned out really well.  Everyone liked it.

Excellent!  I love the fact that this recipe makes chicken loaded with flavor with no added calories!  It's perfect for anyone trying to follow a reduced-calorie diet.  I cooked mine under the broiler, and it turned out just fine.

The best is to use skinless boneless thighs, for the added flavor of the dark meat.  My husband loves this and because he is on a low carb diet, it is very easy to make with some roatsed asparagus or steamed brocolli for an "ethnic break," for the typial low carb fare.

Good recipe but not quite tandoori chicken. I used yogurt in the marinade as suggested by other reviewers. I made the recipe with boneless tenders. They were good but I think I will try some of the other tandoori chicken recipes on the site to find something more authentic. Thanks for the recipe though!

I love the flavors of India so I loved this recipe. Not only is it easy to make but my boyfriend had seconds! For an easy complete dinner serve chicken over jasmine steamed rice and grill up some mixed veggies (onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes) along with the chicken.

I have had this in restaurants many times, but this was my first attempt. Not the same spice taste as what I am used to but turned out pretty good, paired with Bombay style potatoes and chickpeas in mild curry sauce. I got lazy after that and bought some naan at a local market :) Otherwise a great start for an Indian style dinner

This was ok; I was hoping it would have more flavor. I used the spices as written but used only 2 chicken breast halves and marinated for the whole day. I agree with another reviewer that this is more of a curry powder chicken than tandoori chicken. I don't know if I will make this again, but thank you for the recipe anyway!

This recipe was absolutely yummy... it left my house smelling like Indian food all day. I mixed the spices in with about a cup of yougurt and let the chicken marinade in that mixture for about 30 minutes. Delicious!

A great recipe--very easy and good if you're dieting.  I'm not sure how authentic the taste is, but whenever I make it people say it tastes just like it's from a restaurant.  The only change I make is to double the amount of everything (except the chicken) but it's not necessary.  This is, to some people, very spicy, so you may want to use only 1/4 tsp of the red pepper.

Wonderful recipe.  It was very tasty!  I would recommend serving it with something other than plain basmati rice since there isn't much of a sauce.   The spices were perfect!

Very easy way to give great flavor to chicken.  I slightly deviated from the recipe by cutting the chicken into cubes and marinating the chicken in the tandoori paste for three hours.  The chicken was cooked in a skilled over medium high heat and served over brown rice.  I found a nice side dish to be mashed sweet potatoes.  It was a nice sweet contrast to the flavor of the chicken.

A touch salty (although i may have oversalted because i didn't measure), but otherwise had great flavor! I put it under broiler and it worked fine. I needs to be served with something because it's so dry. I served it with red lentil curry and it was delicious - but i like the idea of marinating in yogurt and lemon and will try that next time.

I made this dish tonight with basmati rice and it was very nice.  Instead of chicken breast I used chicken thigh with bone in.  Doing it this way only made enough for  three pieces of chicken so I used Tandoori Masala to spice up the other 3 chicken pieces and it wasn't as good as Tandoori Chicken II pieces.   This recipe by far was delicious, and good, spiced just right and I will be serving it to my future husband.(When I find him).  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Cheers

We would give this 10 stars if we could.  I doubled the maranade, and ended up only doing 2 chicken breasts.  I'd still just double it for 4 breasts.  Instead of water I used plain yogurt.  The chicken sat in the fridge for maybe an hour before going on the grill.  I served it with coconut rice, hummus, yogurt sauce, cucumbers, grilled peppers, and feta cheese.  We are doing this again for dinner, although this time I am making peppys pita bread (on this site) and make some nice sandwiches with this chicken.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good. I do agree that it is more like curry chicken than tandoori chicken. I used 1 cup of plain yogurt instead of the water, and saved some of the marinade out to serve with the cooked chicken. I would make this again.

It wasn't bad but it was more like curry powder chicken- not a real tandoori flavor. I'm sure one could find a better recipe for tandoori chicken.

I didn't grill this, but cooked it in a cast iron skillet on the stove-top instead. I thought it was a little too salty. Perhaps 1/4 tsp salt would suffice? It sure is easy to put together though!

this recipe is great. my husband loved it! i used the suggestions i had read in the review and added 4 spoons of yogurt, a spoon of lemon juice and doubled the spices, because he's indian and loves spicy food. i made this in my foreman grill and it came out wonderful and VERY healthy. i will definitely be using this marinade again & again :)

Made this tonight. Made it with half the amount of chicken and twice the sauce (with half the salt)... Hot and spicy and wonderfully tasty! Thank you for sharing this recipe. Love it!

This was very good.  I didn't add salt at all and doubled the spices because I found it wasn't enough to cover the chicken.  I did not double the amount of water and the paste consistency came out great.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a great version of my favorite Indian meat dish, was just a bit too spicy for my kids though.  Our local Indian restaurant's tandoori chicken has more of a smokey flavor than spicy.

Quadrupled the spice rub (except the red pepper flakes) for 2 lb. boneless chicken breasts, cut into large chunks. Was quite spicy anyway, but depends on type of curry powder you use. Broiled in oven for about 5-6 minutes on each side, checking frequently until juices in chicken run clear. Served with mango chutney. Was a HUGE success! Delicious flavor; very juicy and tender!

This recipe is so flavorful!  I sauted the chicken until golden, added 2 more tablespoons of water to the spice mixture, and added it to the pan.  I then covered the pan and simmered until the chicken was done.  Delicious with the Marinated Vegetable recipe and roasted red potatoes.

I doubled the spices, and rather than use water I used 1 cup of yogurt.  Marinated the chicken thighs for an hour, then baked in the oven.

Came out awesome! Though like others said, this isn't really Tandoori chicken.  Doesn't matter to me, I will be making this again.

This recipe was awesome.  I took the advice of another review and doubled the spice mixture.  It made just enough to coat 3 large breasts.  I cut each boneless breast into 3 chunks and grilled on a stovetop grillplate.  My boyfriend was blown away.  A keeper for sure.

This recipe was tasty and so simple to prepare. I tried making my own Garam Masala spice blend last weekend for an Indian Beef dish, and had leftovers to use in this chicken recipe. I find the flavour so much brighter when you grind your own spices. I left out the food colouring (I don’t think it’s necessary). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

really good.  I was afraid it would be dry so I coated my chicken thighs and legs with olive oil, then covered the chicken with the herb mix and grilled indirect heat.  awesome.  really good as leftovers too.

The flavors were really good. As others have stated, it was a little dry so I'll probably try the Tandori I version to increase the moisture. However, the spices on Tandori II were perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good, but I used the yogurt and a spritz of lemon juice *also omitted the ginger* and let mine marinade for 5 hours before baking in the oven at 350. Amazing with Jasmine Rice and a delicious Spicy Orange Peanut Sauce!

Our family loves a LOT of flavor & this recipe definately delivered.  The changes I made were: 1) doubled all the spices (more flav!) and 2) I added 2 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil & 1 tbsp of water (vs. using just water).  Also added a dash of fresh squeezed lemon.  I made chicken-kabobs & marinated the cubed chicken pieces for 1/2 hour.  They were PACKED full of flavor - this recipe really worked great as a BBQ marinate!    Will definately use this recipe again & again over the summer months!  Thanks for posting!

Surprisingly like that in restaurants (without the neon-red color), plus no dairy for lactose-issues DH.  However, type of curry is key - for instance McCormick makes both "curry powder" and "RED curry powder" (latter is "gourmet collection blend"), just plain curry powder would be disappointing compared to restaurants.  5 stars also for being ridiculously easy.  Used all the spices, only 2 chicken breasts, and lime juice (squeeze bottle) instead of water.  From previous reviews I anticipated a fine line between dry outside and raw center, so I cut chicken into 1-inch cubes (about 12 cubes per breast) and stuck on mini-skewers, no marinating time other than stirring cut chicken with other ingredients, grilled 4-5 minutes each side (turning once) on indoor Jenn-Air grill, "Hi" setting, basted second side with more lime juice.  With good-quality rice made in rice cooker (vs. cheap "fluffy" stove-top rice), whole thing was surprisingly not dry.  I could see adding fresh mushrooms, onions and maybe cut kielbasa to skewers.  Hotness scale with full 1/2 tsp red pepper on only 2 chicken breasts: - my 80-yr-old mom/small children would scream - bordering too hot for me - bordering too mild for firemouth DH Something akin to "hot" chinese food/"mild to medium" thai.  Thanks for great recipe when unexpected snow storm caught me with empty pantry!

This may have turned out better if I had baked it or cooked it on a real grill.  I used the Foreman grill and it got a bit dried out.  It still had the indian flavors that we were going for. So all in all not too bad!

This was ok. The chicken was very bland.
I doubled the spices, except for red pepper. My husband said it was good, but needs more spice. My kids said they did not care for it. I have to agree with the kids, will not make again.

I think I combined this with Tandoori Chicken II too.  I used boneless chicken thighs and used cinnamon, salt, pepper, curry powder, cayenne pepper, allspice, ginger, paprika, and garlic powder.  I didn't grind them into a paste but just threw them all in a bag with the chicken, along with the juice of half a lemon and olive oil.  I was not able to grill this due to bad weather (rain) for 3 days in a row so I just pan-fried them. I've never made Tandoori Chicken before so I didn't know what to expect.  I got a very cinnamon and curry-tasting chicken.  Yum! I had this with rice and homemade kimchi.

Easier than expected!  I would have cut back on the crushed pepper a bit.  The turmeric could have been omitted.  Those are the only changes I would have made.  I served it with an off-the-shelf jar of Peanut Satay Sauce and over rice.  Easy, low calorie/carbohydrates and fast!

Really terrific, with suggested changes made by others.  I first made it with chicken breasts, and used natural yogurt instead of water, letting it marinade for several hours.  It was really good as written with yogurt, but we decided we wanted it a little spicier.  Second time, I used cubed pork and doubled the spices.  After about 6 hours marinading, I cooked it stovetop and served it with rice.  The pork was tender, juicy and really good.  Next time, and there will be many next times, I want to use chicken thighs and reserve the sauce for when the meat is cooked.  I would add a photo, but it is only a dirty bowl at this point.

I've made this recipe many times. So many times that I've pre-mixed the seasonings in a large spice jar to have on hand at all times! The only thing I do differently is reduce the salt a bit and reduce the water so the paste is thicker.

I haven't grilled the chicken yet but you can NOT make a paste with 2 Tbsp. of water. I think there might be a typo and it should be 2 teaspoons of water. I tried with the 2 Tbsp. and it's a liquid.

I followed this recipe as written.  This tasted nothing like  Tandori Chicken !!  The only thing I tasted was a very dry (the chicken was moist but the recipe was dry) piece of chicken with curry all over it. Very boring, will not be making this again. But thank you for the recipe anyway. .

Taste is individual, but I found the marinade isn't a sufficient quantity to fully flavor the chicken. But this is easily fixed by increasing the amount and length of marinade time. Also consider using yogurt and lemon juice as other reviewers suggested. If you like lots of flavor, for four chicken breasts quadruple the marinade ingredients and sub 1 Tbsp plain Greek yogurt and 1 Tbsp lemon juice for each 2Tbsp water.  I brushed the paste onto the chicken, then marinated for 2 hours.

Easy prep and cooking for this, I however cooked the chicken in small cubes in a cast iron skillet rather than on the grill and LOVED it.  I paired it with Carrot rice, samosas and pistachio rose ice cream for desert. WOW WHAT A HUGE HIT!

This turned out awesome!!! I made this with a few alterations based on what I had and my cooking style. I had 6 chicken breasts, so I increased the spices by 3 times the amounts, plus I like a lot of flavor. I reduced the red pepper flakes in half though. I substituted Kikoman's red curry paste (which also adds heat) in the amount of 1 tsp. Then because I had a homemade BBQ sauce that I needed to get the last of out of the bottle, and I wanted a marinade, I rinsed it with 2 Tbs lime juice and added that. Because I wasn't doing this on the grill, I also added 2 Tbs liquid smoke. I marinated the meat for 3 hours and cooked it in my ceramic frying pan. PERFECT flavor, definitely a keeper!

Though I made this, I did not eat it as I am Vegan. I made it for my husband to accompany a "side" dish. When asked what he'd rate it, he said a 4 because of the spiciness and he's not huge on very spicy food.

Very nice change from the usual chicken fare! Squirt with lemon or lime before grilling,yummy! Double the spices for more of a kick. Thank you for this recipe!

Absolutely yummy!  I did change one thing on the recipe, instead of using chicken breasts, I used chicken tenderloin strips.  I also cooked it on an electric indoor grill.  It was quite tasty and my family loved it too.

As written, this recipe isn't that great. Instead of water, I mixed the spices with oil ad lemon juice and marinated chicken breasts in the mixture for the afternoon. To cook them I seared them in a frying pan then finished them offf in the oven with the rest of the marinade poured over top. In the end ths was much tastier than I expected.
