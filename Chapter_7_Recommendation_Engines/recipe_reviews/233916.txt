Just tried this recipe and it's excellent!  The only thing different I did was add chopped fresh mushrooms to the stuffing and I used dried parsley instead of fresh. I baked the chops at 325 for 1-1/2 hrs. - turned them over for the last 15 minutes to brown the other side. As a side I bought a bag of small butter potatoes and used the garlic potato recipe I found on this site. We cut them in half and tossed in olive oil, parsley flakes, minced garlic and salt and pepper. I had some chop stuffing left over so when the potatoes were baked we added a little velveeta cheese and half and half to the leftover stuffing mixture, cooked it just until the cheeses melted and spooned it over the potatoes. Delicious! I'm terrible at overcooking pork chops but these were tender and moist and I used bone-in chops because I got them on sale. Family loved this meal - thanks John!

Made this tonight because I had all the ingredients.  I had low expectations because I thought it would be dry but I was blown away.  It was delicious.  I made it with pork chops on the bone and can't wait to make it it with the boneless chops the recipe calls for.  This one is keeper.

This by far is the best recipe I've tried here. Looks complicated but actually very easy. I saut√©ed some Granny Smith apples with a little brown sugar and cinnamon and put on top. Yummy!!

I liked this, but I wish it came out more moist. You never know with pork. Mine came in a pkg of two, so I froze one. For this, I put it in the freezer for an hour, and it made it easier to cut. Good combination of flavors for the stuffing. I did saute a chopped apple, red grapes and craisins in a little butter, and added brown sugar, and a touch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper. Nice fall dish, along with butternut squash and a red blend wine. I just had half a chop, since they were quite large.

I love it! I did not put the fruit on top. Instead I put a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of bacon with a can of milk all mixed up on top the last 15 minutes. It was great! Made up some of Chef John's Spaetzle. Fantastic Meal!

I made this exactly as written and we loved it.  I cooked it the recommended 45 minutes, but will cut that back by at least 5 minutes next time.  A great dinner for low carb dieters.  The pork chops are so large that we split one and were quite satisfied.

We're from CO, at a far high higher altitude than southern CA, where we're visiting for the holidays, so we baked the chops a bit too long. But easy to make. Substituted crumpled Gruyere cheese, and used packaged Craisons as fruit.  Just used a bit more canned sauce. Delicious, Chef John!

My boys who can take or leave it when it comes to pork chops absolutely loved this recipe.  I had to make this gluten free so I used gluten free panko instead of the bread crumbs.  I had to do a little browning on low broil at the end but it worked out great. I was even TOLD  by one of my boys that I had to add this recipe to My Favorites. I will be making this again and again.

I have an allergy to milk products so I used dairy free gouda and italian seasoned breadcrumbs. This dish was enjoyed by all.

I rarely write a review. This recipe is so incredibly good I just have to  give it a great review.   I think the secret to this recipe is to  follow the instructions and make sure you rub the Porkchop in oil before you put in the egg wash. These porkchops turned out so  tender  and moist. My porkchops were only 1 inch thick. So I adjusted my cooking time to 50 minutes  turned them over and cooked an additional 10 minutes. Turned out perfect.  I could not believe how well these porkchops turned out!!

Loved it ! Family said best dinner I have made. I did coat my apples in brown sugar, I used the bacon grease with a table spoon of olive oil and butter, cut grapes in half tossed them with the apples let them simmer on low the 45 minutes ..... I turned the apples over once. I will make more sauce next time ! I also added onion and spinach to the stuffing, made extra bacon to go in with the apples....... So good thanks John

I combined this with another recipe for apple and cranberry stuffed chops. I must not have used enough cheese because we couldn't taste it at all. Next time, I will brown the chops in a skillet first and then finish them in the oven.
