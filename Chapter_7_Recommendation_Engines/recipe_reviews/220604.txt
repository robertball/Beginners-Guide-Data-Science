This sounds like a good option for a hot night dinner but I think I would puree a garlic clove with the tomatoes.

I was really surprised at how good this tasted. This was my first time making a raw tomato sauce. I blended the onion and garlic with everything else though. I added a couple leaves of basil too. I'm trying to think of a way to make it thicker but it's really good.
