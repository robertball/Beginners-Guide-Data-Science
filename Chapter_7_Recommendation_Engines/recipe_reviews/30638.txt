This is an excellent recipe that is easy to make with a sauce that is to die for.  Serve with a good red wine to bring out the truely remarkable flavors of this dish.

This was an excellent tasting steak.  The sauce was absolutely delicious.  I found it a bit dry though.  I think the cooking time may have been too long.  This one will stay in my Recipe file.  Try it with Cabernet Sauvignon.  Yummy!

Have made similar brandied steaks but the flavor of the oil in these is much better.   Will not use round steak - much too dry.   Prefer strip loin or sirloin.  Certainly impressive company fare.   Thanks.

This recipe is good, but not perfect.  Make sure you go easy on the salt to avoid having an extremely salty pan sauce.  Further, if your are using a thicker cut of meat, I would suggest searing the steaks on both sides and finishing in a hot oven (obviously use a oven-proof pan).  This provides much beeter results with the meat as opposed to an excessively long pan-fry as noted.  The oil made from the sage, rosemary, and thyme is great!

The meat you should use for this recipe is Chateaubriand not top round as suggested.

This was very good! Demi-glace is a bit hard to find--I ended up going to a smaller grocery store to find it. I halved the salt, used margarine instead of butter, and used half and half. It was a little bit salty, but that's because I didn't "clarify" the margarine. To ignite the brandy, I lit the end of an uncooked linguine noodle and put the tip in the sauce. I also made the roux, but thought the sauce was thick enough after adding the half and half. I used the top round steak, which ended up a little tough. I would suggest buying a better cut. The sauce was SO good, though, that the meat toughness almost didn't matter!

I did not use the roux and I only cooked 8 minutes per side.  I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Absolutely awsome!!  Next time I am going to try some Drambuie fresh out of the freezer for a topping!

Although this is a bit of work and takes time to make the demi-glace from scratch it is well worth it. Everyone loved it and I will most definitly make it again. Very tasty!

Heck yeah!  I loved cooking this recipe just as much as i loved eating it.  I made with mashed potatoes and corn and the meal was delicious.  The sauce was banging.  This is going in the top 5 file!!

It bugs me when people change ten things and then rate a recipe 5 stars. That said, I changed a bunch of stuff and am rating this 5 stars! That's because the the technique outlined here would produce great results regardless of the changes I made. I didn't have any of the fresh herbs, so I left them out (didn't want to attempt with dry herbs as I think they would just burn). ALso I had no veal demi glace (shocker) so I used plain old beef broth. Otherwise followed recipe, and it was nearly as amazing as the fancy restaurant dish that made me want to try this. One major tip though, unless you have high ceilings and a good metal range hood, take the pan outside to add the brandy/ignite. I was really glad I did when I saw the 8 foot flames shoot up! The sauce comes out a little salty, but soooo good, and the restaurant's version was salty too, so I think that is how it should be.

At first I didn't understand what all the hype was about.  The sauce tasted so so.  Something happened though, as I kept eating it, and my husband agrees with this, the flavor got better.  At the end of our meal we found that we really enjoyed it.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe.

I enjoyed an easier depiction of this recipe. Using olive oil and butter instead of clarified butter. And using beef bouillon instead of veal demi-glace. It came out very good, and the flaming brandy is a nice touch.

We had fun making this one.  It was the first time we had ever intentionally ever lit anything on fire in our kitchen! LOL!  I would stop after the fire step and NOT use the cream.  It made the steak heavy and added an unnecessary flavor.

Really good, not good for you, but tasty. My brandy never did flame up (dern) but the sauce was really good.  I sliced the steak then drizzled the sauce over it for a nice presentation.  Definately a special occasion dish due to high fat content.

Amazingly rich flavor!  It was slightly salty, but I suspect that had more to do with the commercial demi glace I used, than the recipe.  I'll keep that in mind and adjust next time.

I added sliced portabellos and garlic and sauteed those along side the steak.  I removed the mushrooms before I flambed the steak and continued with the recipe and added them back in at the end - they were a perfect complement.

Carb Watchers,  I've made this recipe about 8 times now and agree with the other reviews that the fresh herbs make this dish 5 stars.  Pulling the herbs out of my garden makes this dish economical too. I do use the heavy cream!  The first couple of times I made my own demi glace, but now I use 1-2 tsp Better Than Bouillon low sodium and 1/2 cup of red wine for the liquid.  I think my version has 1 or 2 net carbs and is quicker to make.  Now the meat is tricky, I've used many different types, but I continue to return to the round steak because its price.  I usually use a meat tenderizer, poke, rub it, and store in refrig hours before seasoning.  My children do not like fat or gristle, so I wouldn't pick a ribeye.  I like the idea of the chateaubriand/filet $$$$... even a T-bone would be nice, BUT I would still tenderize it to be safe; most steaks can end up tough.
