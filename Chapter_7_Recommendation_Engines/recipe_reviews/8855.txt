This is a favourite comfort food for my family, but differs from the above recipe. Milk burns easily, so I suggest using a can of water instead & adding another can of cr of mushroom (or other cream soup). Also, place the ingredients in a casserole dish and bake at 350 for 1 hr with the lid on, and 1/2 hr with the lid off. Make other variations to suit your tastes. Adding fresh dill, garlic, fresh mushrooms and/or cheese can make all the difference in the world.

My mom has made this for years and it is one of my favorite dishes. One thing to remember though, rice does absorb liquid so you may want to add milk if you notice it drying out.  Since I have been making it, I pre-cook my rice then add all the other ingredients and bake it for 25 to 30 minutes just to heat everything up.

Well, I'll never do that again. After all that waiting, stirring, adding liquid, adding spices, taste testing, and baking. It just wasn't worth the trouble. My boyfried felt bloated after one serving, but still gave it 3 stars. (He wasn't the one who had to cook it.) It tasted like baked gruel with freeze dried chicken when all was said and done. (Sorry, Kris.) Such things should only be consumed in prisons. Can't wait to scour that pan for 90 minutes. Urbanites, turn back!

This recipe is SO OLD.  It's the first one I made about 35 yrs ago for an old, old boyfriend. I would only recommend it for the novice cook, otherwise it's very bland and boring.

I think I am going to try it with minced dried onions instead of the soup mix--since many people didn't care for strong taste...and it's so much cheaper and healthier than those salty packages.  I am also going to use some white wine and water instead of the milk.

I did things a little different. I combined several of these tips from other users and made my own. i simmered about 1 lb of boneless skinless chicken tenders in a little butter with onion flakes and minced garlic. At the same time i cooked one cup of brown rice over the stove. and had some broccoli flourets in the microwave. i poured the rice in the caserole dish, chopped the cooked chicken and the steamed broccoli and spread it over the rice. i then added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cup of skim milk and spread it out evenly over the chicken. i then put shredded cheese (mild cheddar) on top of that. i cubed 3 slices of bread  and spread it out over the cheese. then sprinkled some onion flakes and italian seasonings on top of everything (lightly sprinkle). I baked on 350 for 45 min.  It was the best caserole i ever made and ate.  the cubed bread added a little crunch. and everything just blended together perfectly.   SOOOO GOOOD!!!

Thise dish wasn't as bad as some of the other reviews read. I just used 1/2 packet of the onion soup mix, pre-cooked the rice, and then mixed it all together. I would put a layer of rice and then a layer of cheeses. After that was done, I put my chicken breast on top (with spices that I normally use on chicken) and cooked it for 30 minutes. Turned out great! No use for the extra water or milk if rice is pre-cooked!

I love this recipe. So simple and easy and tastes amazing. I love using onion soup mix so this hit the spot. I always precook my rice and mix everything together, then I top it with cheese and put it under the broiler. I do use less milk since I precooked the rice.

I read the reviews before making and changed a couple of things. I precooked the rice in a rice cooker. Mixed 1.5 cups milk + 1/2 package dry onion + 1 can condensed mushroom soup with the precooked rice. I used whole boneless skinless chicken breasts on top of the mixture and poured remaining soup over the top. Baked uncovered for 40 minutes at 325.

After 30 years, I finally admitted how easy this is and now my husband makes it. 
1) We use water instead of milk with Bone-in chicken thighs for lots of moisture and flavor.  This takes about 1 1/2 hour at 350.
2) For a leaner and quicker dish, use boneless skinless thigh meat, cut up, and substitute chicken broth for the water. Cook about  1 - 1 1/4 hours.
We love cooking with onions and often add 1/2 medium onion diced and a jar of pimentos. These add even more moisture and flavor.

Just like Mom used to make!  I also left the onion soup mix out and replaced it with minced onions instead.  I love this meal! Easy enough for a rookie but your Mom will be asking you for the recipe if she never made it for you before.

My husband and I love this for supper!  Thanks for sharing!  I used leftover rice so I skipped the milk and then in my effort to get our vegetables in, I added a bunch of frozen veggies to make it into a one-pot-meal!  (I also added a little sprinkling of cheese on top!) :)

My kids and I love this. It doesn't take 3hrs to cook if you cook at 350 for 1hr - 1hr & half....I used minute rice. I've used brown & white. Both where good. I also added a stick of melted butter.

Easy to make but it was very boring and bland. Def. needs something else. I boiled 3 chicken breast and shredded it with a fork instead of cutting into pieces. i used a cup of chik broth and 1/2cup of milk. i also put worshishishishire in it which really helped to add some zip to it. 3hrs?? no way!!! it only took about 45min!

I did alter the recipe a bit, but it was fantastic!  I used a package of Broccoli Chedder rice instead of plain white rice.  I forgot, not opted out of the onions, but will probably add some minced next time. I only had to cook it for an hour and a half.  My boyfriend asked for it for lunch the next day.  YES!

Didn't work for me.  After three hours the rice was mushy but still had crunchy bits.  I enjoyed the taste but this was for sure just a one time dish for our family.

It was an ok dish, however it would be better if it's covered instead of being uncovered. It drys  out if its uncovered like the recipe says!

This recipe is great...but I think you have to alter it.  I put in half the onion soup mix, but I doubles the mushroom soup, added onions, cooked the rice, and added corn and peas. I added some spice, garlic powder, pepper, and dill weed. I mixed the chicken in the recipe after it was boiled and cut up.  Both my husband and I loved it.

My family loved this meal, but i did make a few changes. I had leftover breaded chicken, so i cut that up.  I made a cup of minute rice, and set it aside. I then heated up a can of cream of mushroom soup with a can of milk. Then I added a can of mushrooms, and two cups frozen mixed vegetables. I omitted the onion soup. I put it all in a casserole dish, and topped it with pie crust, cooking it at 350 for 40 minutes. DELICIOUS!

I consider myself to be an above average cook and I could not get this to work. I thought it would be something easy to throw together and forget about. I tried this twice and both times the rice would not cook all the way through.

This was my first time making this recipe. I stripped leftover chicken off a whole bird that i had roasted rotisserie style. The only alteration i would make for next time would be to throw in some veggies to give it some crunch and may be half the packet of onion soup. My bird was marinated in onion and garlic for it's first cooking and still had a strong flavor. I took another reviewer's advice and precooked the rice and just heated up. Also added shredded cheddar to top.

Easy but I'd have to say it's incomplete. I cooked at 325-350 for an hour and it was dry. So I added 1-2 cups milk on top, stirred it up and then added two cans of green beans. Like others the onion tase was strong and is so close to grren bean casserole. SO I added them. The added milk help undry it out and made the whole thing salavageable.

Yes, this is an old recipe. I don't 
put the chicken in it since it's too plain. I only like marinated or rotisserie chicken. This is an excellent, rice side dish. However, it is too oniony/salty. I use one Lipton Beefy Onion Soup Mix then I double the rest of the ingredients: 2 cans of 98% fat free, cream of chicken (or mushroom) soup, 2 cans (21.5 oz) 1% milk, 2 cups instant rice, and add 1/2 cup melted margarine. It only takes 45 minutes but cook 10 minutes longer if you like it a little bit crunchy on top. My whole family loves it!

When I read this recipe, I thought what could be bad about all of these?  I read several of the reviews, I needed a "bland-ish" dish for my husband this week to help calm some reflux issues - I thought this would work.  I did 1/2 wine, 1/2 milk instead of 1-1/2 cans milk; I cooked covered 1 hour at 350, then uncovered for 1/2 hour.  I stirred in some cheese, I used skinless boneless chicken instead.  And, I only used 1 T the onion mix.  I am well beyond a novice cook, but to make something quick, with what I had on hand, and minimal effort this evening, I gave this a shot.  I mixed everything very well, even brought out a wisk.  I used a Le Crueset buffet casserole dish instead of the 9x13, but surface area is about the same.  Parts of the rice was gooey, part was dry, chicken was fine - my 3 year old LOVED it.  Rice tasted like cream of mushroom soup with a touch of onion soup with a touch of wine.  No subtle flavor, just convenience factor.  It wasn't bad, but as others said, perhaps with cutting down the onion MORE than 1/2 packet (I used 1 T total), maybe adding different spices, it has potential for a "I don't know what else to make for dinner, but I've got all these ingredients"-dinner.  My non-picky husband suggested I don't need to make this one again.

perfect for a beginner cook. Since so many people suggested leaving out the onion, I didn't include any during my preparation. I heated my oven at 350 degrees and baked the ingredients for about an hour. Also, I used 1lb of skinless, boneless chicken & it was definitely enough. I sprinkled shreeded cheese throughout the mix as well as italian seasoned bread crumbs. My boyfriend loved it! Super easy! I'll definitely be making this dish again soon : )

This is a good recipe for people who have very little experience baking/cooking but want to make something simple. I halved the recipe and it still took about 90 minutes to cook it properly. I also used brown rice and skim milk, which made it a little healthier without disrupting the consistency.

This was delicious! After cooking it was kind of dry so I made up some more sauce on the stove top and poured it over the casserole. Turned out perfect!

This recipe is very tasty! I had to make some changes though. I boiled the rice in chicken broth dir 10 minutes, and I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour.

My family loves it! It's perfect for a hearty, no-fuss dinner. I used water instead of milk, as another reader suggested, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I saw some complaints about  the onion flavor, but the balance was just fine for us. I've added the recipe to my "family faves" file.

I doubled the rice and wet soups, because I feed an army! I also used chicken quarters. I sprinkled and dry yellow onion soup mix on top. I added frozen carrots (about a cup) and frozen broccoli ( about two cups) to the rice. I backed it covered at 275 for almost 3 hours. The kids loved it! I will definitely make this again.

3 hours is WAY too long to bake this. The rice was a horrible mixture of gummy and crunchy from being overcooked.

I don't understand what it means by 1 1/2 cans of milk. Is that evaporated or condensed? Can I use normal milk? Help.
