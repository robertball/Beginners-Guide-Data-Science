Normally I try to make a recipe three times before rating it. I've baked five batches of these excellent cookies. Because they're made with oil rather than shortening, butter or margarine the texture is different but every bit as good. Cookies made with shortening, margaine or butter tend to have crispy or crumbly edges, but when baked properly, these crisp up nicely on the edges also. For those with cholesterol, saturated fat or trnas-fats issues, this recipe is a great find. You are giving up nothing with these cookies. The flavor is excellent, and the texture very satisfying, and the batter freezes well.
I would suggest making a batch but baking just one tray to see how they turn out in YOUR oven, because as we all know, the recipe numbers for temperature and length of baking time vary with our own particular oven. Mine was spot-on, but cookies baked on the lower rack burned a little while upper rack cookies were perfection. I add walnuts, but I assume you can add anything you want, craisins, raisins, coconut, any kind of nut. You can even leave out the chocolate. But who'd be crazy enough to do that?

Many thoughts about this recipe, which is pretty good.  Almost certainly the people who disliked these cookies used old, rancid oil to make it.  You must use reasonably fresh oil.  To improve the flavor, if you have it, you can use a few tablespoons of sesame, almond, walnut, coconut or other nut oils.  If you only shop at the grocery store, your best choices are probably corn or peanut oil, although any will work.  You could also add one or two Tbsps of melted butter to add a bit of butter flavor without all the saturated fat.  Moreover, the fat in this recipe can be reduced a bit without affecting the texture much.  Since this is basically a Toll House Cookie recipe that uses oil instead of butter, and butter is 20% water and milk solids by volume, you can reduce the amount of fat by 20%, replacing it with milk or water, and still get a good result.  So use 3/4 cup (12-13 Tbsps) of oil, and about 3-4 Tbsps liquid.  If you use the fat + water, make the recipe with bread flour, and mix the dough awhile after the flour is added (say a minute), you will have a chewy textured cookie.  Whole-wheat flour and some added spices (about 2 tsp mixed) makes a good spice cookie.  Adding 2 tsp corn syrup to the recipe (you can use pancake syrup) will help the cookies stay moist and soft.

These cookies came out a lot better than some of the other recipes that I have tried. I like that it is made with oil instead of shortening (which many other recipes call for) because oil is something that is commonly used in my house. I wouldn't know what else to use the shortening for. The flavor for these cookies usually come out very well. I have occasionally had trouble with the chips falling out of the dough, but that happens very rarely. Either way, I've used this recipe at least 15 times now, and I am usually very satisfied with these. They're soft and chewy, and not dry at all.

These were okay.  They come out looking very nice, but I too found the taste to be quite bland.  They were very convenient, however, because of the oil instead of the butter.  I probably won't be making these again.

These cookies actually came out really good. I admit they probably aren't as good as cookies made with butter, but I only had canola oil so I decided to make these. They came out crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I also didn't have almond extract so just used vanilla. I will probably make them again using more vanilla extract and chocolate chips.

These were great when they were warm from the oven but once they cooled my family and I were not as happy with them. There was something missing. Not a bad recipe but I will probably not make them again.

I love this recipe.  The  batter is a little oily, but i find it easer to put in the pan.  Instead of making small cookies i use my glass casserole dish and spread the cookie dough evenly.  They bake perfectly and end up being like a brownie cookie.  Very delicious!  I use a tad more brown sugar because I like my cookies with that extra hint of brown sugar, and I use smart oil which is a mixture of vegetable oil and olive oil.  I also cut out the almond extract.  This is perhaps the easiest cookie I have ever made, and delicious wither fresh from the oven or chilled in the fridge.

For a chocolate chip cookie made with vegetable oil, this is pretty good.  I made the recipe the first couple of times with just veggie oil (soybean).  Then, one time I did not have enough veggie oil, so I supplemented with corn oil (about half and half).  The cookies turned out even better with this mixture.  The corn oil seemed to add an additional level of richness that the cookie didn't have previously.  I highly recommend trying a combo of these two oils.  I've thought about using all corn oil, but I'm happy with how they are turning out now and don't want to risk it.  I also bake on convection bake at 325 and for about 11 minutes.  I'm sure the temp and cooking time will just vary from oven to oven.

the best cookies in the whole world.  I made this cookie because I didn't have butter in the house.   It is now our standard cookie.   I keep these in the freezer for in 8 minutes cookies.  I spread the dough out on a wax paper coveredcookie sheet and then cut the dough into squares with a knife.  then I place the sheet in the freezer. In about 2 hours I pull the sheet out of the freezer wrap the dough in freezer paper or large zip lock. when you want a cookie, beak off a line of dough squares and prepare.

Sooo yummy! I was looking for a cookie with oil because I had a serious sweet tooth one night and was out of butter. I only changed a few things... I used 2 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and used 2 cups of choc chips (I've made these twice so far and the 1st time with 1 cup there weren't nearly enough chips!) They come out soft and chewy!

I was hesitant to make these after reading a few not so great reviews, but gave it a try since I was out of butter and needed a veg. oil recipe. SO glad I did! My family loved them, they were a nice thick cookie, nicely crisp on the outside and chewy moist inside. Our new go-to recipe for sure, and so simple, I'm actually not sure how they wouldn't turn out for anyone. 4 star instead of 5 only because I did make a couple of changes, using milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet, and omitting the almond extract in favor of extra vanilla. And they needed to bake for 13 minutes exactly so a little longer than the 8-10 stated- perfect every time and we've made them on 3 different occasions now. Use nice big rounded tablespoons for best results!

Love that these don't include the trans fats via butter/shortening like most cookie recipes.  I made mine with white choco chips and thought they were really good!  They baked up beautifully and I really like the texture.  I added butter flavor extract instead of almond and I think next time will up the dose to 2 teaspoons of butter extract just to reinforce a more buttery taste.

We made a huge cookie and put it in for fifteen minutes.  It was a little cakey, but still pretty good.  Actually, it was even better than my Betty Crocker chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I actually got this recipe off another website.  That recipe called for 3 full cups of flour and no almond extract.  I followed that one (since I didn't find this one on allrecipes until later).  These were surprisingly good.  Love that I don't have to take out the beater.  One star off since mine did not spread.  Couple of the photos on allrecipes show that their cookies did not spread as much either.  Next time I make this, I will make it with 2.5 cups of flour, and if it spreads more, then I will increase the rating. Edit (8/31/2012, 9/16/2012): I followed this recipe twice now and used 2.5 cups and it spread plenty now!  I baked it at 350 for 11min and it came out perfect - a bit crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  5stars!

i'd been looking for a recipe using oil instead of solid fat, and these are a winner every time i serve them. i don't bother with the almond extract, and hold back about 1/4 cup each of oil and sugar, and use a 1.5T scoop and bake on a Silpat. yields about 31 cookies that way.

I read the other reviews about the flavor and used 2 teaspoons of vanilla and nixed the tsp of almond altogether. I also used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil. The first batch of cookies came out great and tasted way better than I expected. With the second batch I added 1 tsp of sour cream. I didn't like the puffy way they came out of the oven with that second batch using the sour cream, but they tasted wonderful, even better than the first ones! I've been searching for a really good chocolate chip cookie recipe and this is it. I don't understand why other people had such a problem with their batter, their other measurements may have been off because this cookie dough has the same consistency as the ones with butter and it's not "runny" at all.

Afraid these didn't live up to their name claim. They're not even really very good and thus certainly not perfect. Even the addition of almond extract in addition to the other ingredients didn't salvage the cookies from the lack of oomph and flavor imparted by real butter. They were greasy and lacked a nice texture and flavor.   In my estimation, cookies are bad enough for you that there's really no point in eating them if they don't taste amazing. Just go buy butter and make real cookies, you'll be glad you did.

I did not care for this recipe. Substituting veg oil for butter takes the chewyness out of the cookie and just makes them cake like. Additionally, the flavor that real butter imparts is just irreplacable.

Had no butter or milk so i though i'd give this recipe a try since I was craving a snack. The cookies were good! Since I didn't have chocolate chips either I just froze up some melting chocolate and cut the pieces into tiny chunks. So i guess this was more of a chocolate chunk cookie. Either way it was still very good. 

(PS. Also: instead of Almond Extract i used Almond Baking Emulsion)

Ok so I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder to rise them a little and "trayed" 1/2 the dough, with the other 1/2 of the dough I added 3 tbsp. peanut butter and 1/2 cup pecans, ended up with 2 types of mind blowing cookies! This is my new "go to" cc chip and pb chip cookie recipe! Thanks :)

YUMMY! Following others' suggestions I added an extra 1/2 cup brown sugar and 2 teasp. of vanilla extract instead 1 of almond. Make sure you cream sugars and oil just like you would butter & sugars, using a hand mixer, for at least 7 mins. Use hand mixer until you add dry ingredients, then use spoon.

When these were warm out of the oven, I gave them a 3 for flavor, 5 for taste. But the next day they were 5 all around. Great texture and suprisingly not cakey. Will make again.

TERRIBLE! The worst cookie recipe I have ever made, and I have made A LOT of cookies! I like rying new recipes but I regret trying this one!! In the first place they have no taste at all, completely flavorless except for the chocolate chips. The also bake up like bread, they are puffy and bready more like a muffin. Homemade cookies should be soft and gooey. If you'd like to make some flavorless chocolate chip bread then by all means this is the recipe for you but otherwise keep searching!

These cookies were fairly easy to make. I found that there was too much flour, but maybe that was an error on my part. The cookies were very sweet, and tasted and smelled a little too much like almond extract. I'd recommend omitting that or using less than 1 teaspoon.

Great recipie! Just chewy enough, I don't like my cookies to be very crispy. There was a bit too much almond extract, I would use half or three quarters of a teaspoon. Also good cookies to experiment with, different kinds of chocolate chips or nuts can be added.

Awesome! I, like most of the reviews, had no butter/marg. So I google, Chocolate Chip cookies made with oil!! So happy, so pleased! I added a little "egg"-tra salt, because I am a salt queen :) and I am always low in salt...extra salt with the sugar will bring out more flavor. Yummy!

I really like the texture of these cookies with the crispy outside and chewy center but the flavor is lacking...I also found it very difficult to keep the chocolate chips mixed with the dough.  They kept falling out as I would scoop a spoonful to drop on the pan. I probably won't make these again unless I was in desparate need and ran out of butter.

This is an excellent all-purpose recipe that you can tailor to your heart's content.  For example, I used maple extract instead of almond for a nice chocolate-maple taste.  I used three teaspoons of maple to get a good solid flavor; adjust to your own taste.  I also made a batch with peanut butter chips instead of chocolate just for fun.  The recipe is versatile enough that you can do just about anything with it.

I've tried to make chocolate cookies with several types of fat. Every time I make it with butter, I am not satisfied with the flavour and texture. However, this idea of of using vegetable oil is phenomenal, and I will never go back to using butter for chocolate cookies ever again!The cookies came out crispy on the outside, and chewy and moist on in the inside, which to me, constitutes the best cookie ever! However, I added an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar based on reading some other reviews. It is really necessary to add that extra brown sugar, because it allows the cookie to form a lovely crust! I gave the recipe 4 starts for the incorrect amount of sugar, but a definite five stars for the idea of using oil!

I was curious about the idea of using oil so I thought I would give this recipe a try. I changed the recipe some such as omitting the white sugar and almond extract. And instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil. I also used whole wheat flour and added walnuts. They turned out amazing! Thanks for sharing- I would have never thought to use oil!

This is the best cookie, just the right consistency.  I didn't use almond extract, just increased the vanilla.  I have a convection oven and baked them for 10 minutes at 325 degrees.  I flattened them a bit before baking and they were just PERFECT.  Thank you Emily.

Moist and chewy cookie.  I only gave it four stars since I did modify the ingredients a bit by following other reviews.  I used 3/4 cup oil with 2 tablespoon water and I used bread flour.  I measured out the dough to one tablespoon and added about 9 chocolate chips to each, I ended up with 45 cookies.  I baked at 375 degree and the cookies were perfect.  Great to freeze.

This is the exact texture of a cookie that I have been looking for!  I love the idea of putting some almond extract in it.  Since I used about 3/4 bag of Nestle Milk Chocolate Caramel chips and 1/3 bag of semi-sweet chips it gave it such a great mixture of flavor.  I think the caramel goes great with the nutty almond flavor.  This really is a wonderful cookie!

In our never-ending quest to cut margerine out of our diet (we don't use butter for baking), we found this recipe.  Prepared exactly according to directions - minus the almond extract - by my 16 year old son, they came out PERFECT.  For someone who is not accustomed to the flavor of butter in baking, they are fabulous.  The color and texture are great.  The batter was a bit "funny", but it all worked out in the oven.

This recipe as is produced a very oily batter that needed more dry ingredients to make it the right consistency. I'm not sure how much more past the 2.5 cups of flour I used because I added some little by little. They tasted ok - but I won't try an oil vs shortening/butter/margarine recipe again.

I made these cookies with my boyfriend, after various attempts with other recipes.  And I have to say....that these have been the best recipe so far.  They were by no means bland in anyway, and we will definitely be making them again.  We omitted the almond extract (as we too did not have any) and used double the quantity of vanilla extract. We also added a little more baking soda.  I truly believe that the oil made all the difference to the texture.  I have consistantly been disappointed with a 'cake-like' texture, which have been rather try, but these were wonderfully moist.  A definite recipe for any cook.  I would recommend anyone to try these.  In fact we have eaten them all and are about to make some more this evening! A wonderful find!! Thanks Emily :-)

It's about my 5th or 6th time making them, didn't use chocolate chips but added a truckload of ginger and it's still great! (Kinda defeats the point of a chocolate chip biscuit recipe but it's a great biscuit base anyway).

For the oil, I used organic coconut oil instead and they came out looking great! Tasted yummy for not having butter in them and were fairly simple to make.

I tried this recipe but it was so wet that i couldn't even bake them as separate cookies, so i decided to try a cookie bar, but it took more than 10 minutes to bake, and when it finally was done the top was burned and the inside was barely baked at all. I know this could be my falt for deciding to turn it into a cookie bar, but it would have turned into a cookie bar anyway because of the wetness of the "dough". The cookie bar wasn't so bad, but i wouldn't make it again.

I prefer to cook with Olive Oil and wanted to attempt making a non-butter cookie recipe.  I made the recipe with Gluten Free Flour as I have Celiac Disease.  They turned out great.  Delicious, chewy and crispy.  I think the key is to add a good amount of vanilla and plenty of chocolate chips to help add flavor to the oil.  I also added in some hot chocolate mix for a chocolate twist.  I also recommend that you really beat in the sugar and oil so it is not grainy in the cookie (use a mixer).  Really grateful for this recipe.  (Also if you use GF flour - you can sift it to help it from clumping)

I followed the recipe exactly except I ran out of flour at two cups, so I used 1/2 of bread flour instead. The cookies came out delicious. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the texture is a bit different than cookies made out of butter. The texture seems smoother with these. I wanted to make choc. chip cookies and I did not have butter on hand so I made these. I will make them again.

Was craving chocolate chip cookies and ran out of butter. I've made oil cookies before very similar to this recipe, but this particular one turned out fantastic!! 9 min was the perfect baking time for me for a goey center and crispy edges. I never follow recipes exactly, so I modified this one by cutting down the white sugar, less brown sugar, and adding 2 tb of butter and some cinnamon.  Yummy! My husband devoured them!

I am very happy with this recipe. My daughter is allergic to nuts and dairy so using vegetable oil is perfect also after I made this recipe I realized I could substitute vegetable oil for butter in other recipes. Also I used imitation almond extract and they taste very good, my favorite chocolate chip cookies!

These turned out great when I only used 3/4 cup oil, took out the almond extract, and added 1/3 cup Herseys dutch chocolate. I also left them in the oven 10 minutes and let them cool on the cookie sheet so that the oil and brown sugar finished baking. I made a batch of these along side ones made with butter and everyone liked both. Some couldn´t even tell which were made with butter and which with oil.

I'm a cookie monster and had to find a recipe that allows me to eat as many as possible. I had to scour the Internet to find a recipe that used oil.. I read that you can substitute part oil for butter in mostly any ratio you want as long as the wet/dry/fat proportions stay the same as the recipe. I did 1 stick of unsalted butter and about a half cup of vegetable oil. Lessen the amount of almond extract because it takes over! I'd do 1/4 teaspoon almond extract and more vanilla. I also did a little less white sugar and a little more brown. I also added a 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee since I was using a 61 percent vhalrhona bar ! It really accentuated the quality of the chocolate..  This recipe yielded an amazing flat cookie that was crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. The more amazing part was that these cookies retained their moisture and stayed chewy for days.. Though it really didn't take me that long to eat em all.. Play with this recipe and you will be soo happy.. It seems like the perfect recipe to get all iron chef and add all sorts of things like chilli flakes? Ginger? Black pepper? Toffee? I'm on a cookie rampage!

My entire office loved these cookies! Used a little less oil than required (a little more than 3/4 cup). I used olive oil since that all I ever use, but I  recommend using veggie or canola oil. Still though, olive oil wasn't bad at all. If that's all you have, use it! Also, I have a lot of Indian friends who don't eat eggs. So, as a replacement, I used flaxseed meal from Trader Joe's. For every one egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal plus 3 tablespoons cold water. Can't taste the difference at all!

I tried this recipe because I needed to bake cookies and didn't have any butter on hand. It worked surprising well. They aren't as flavorful as the buttery ones, but I think oil is healthier anyway. I'll certainly keep this on file for future baking.

These cookies were hard and crumbly (surprising!) and as I was looking for a moist, slightly chewy cookie, we were VERY disappointed   The oil could be tasted and gave them a heavy, almost slightly fishy aftertaste. Also, there were almost NO chocolate chips in them. I added almost another cup to the dough after the first bach, so that there was more than about one-two cc per cookie.  We have experimented with many different recipes, and my daughter did an experiment for her science fair, and most people (74%) prefer the taste of cc cookies with shortening. That is what I will be using from now on. DO NOT waste your time or ingredients with this one.

The mixture was too oily and we had to add more sugar. There was also too much flour as we could taste it. Sorry, but 1 star!

I just made these and I was worried cause the reviews said they were cakey and tasted like they were missing something....I just added 1/2 more of brown sugar and these were perfect!  I like how they come out in a perfect circle almost every time and they taste great!  I've been searching for a chocolate chip cookie recipe that I really like and I think I've found it!

only cookie known to make u hungrier after eating it.  i used slightly under the recommended veg oil, found it was a lil much when making special batch. if used for medicine, sprinkle with powdered sugar so the extra oil doesnt run off the cookie, but instead sits on top for max dose.  great when made without special oil. also, try peanut butter choco chips. tasty!

These turned out amazing! I did tweak the recipe: used a little more flour (like 2 3/4 cups to 3 cups) and for leavening used 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda. Then I refrigerated the dough overnight. They came out of the oven fluffy and delicious. Couldn't even tell they were made with oil instead of butter. Will definitely make again.

I'd give these 4.5 stars if I could. Not perfect, but really good. I followed exactly using 50 serving conversion. Almond and the oil are great! The are tasty and look nice out of the oven. I also used my mini-cupcake pan and those were delicous as well.

This is my third time baking homemade cookies and I was online only to find a secret on how to make the cookie softer. The first time I made cookies I used the recipe on the back on the morsels pack. The second time I used a recipe from online. The cookie dough came out both times to be to loose and baked to crisp. This time I came across a recipe that is out of this world! When I bit into the cookie I felt like I was three years old again. The cookie was soft and moist and they looked just like the picture! Which usually does not happen. right? The kids, whom are my worst critics, loved them too. I did not have almond extract but next time I will try that. I think substituting butter with oil was the trick. Two thumbs up to the cook!

I thought this was a pretty good cookie.  I don't care much for almond extract in chocolate chip cookies so I left that out.  I do think it's important to use a good oil.  I had plain old vegetable oil on hand and that had a distinct flavor that wasn't that great.  I'd like to try it with fresh canola oil or maybe peanut oil.  The second day was the best day for these cookies.  The flavor of the oil had mellowed out and the cookies were really chewey.  After that they got kind of dry.

for a cookie made with oil this is the best. of course the butter version TASTES better but if your out of butter..these are almost just as good. i made it with wheat flour instead of regular flour..added about 1/3 cup blended oats and about a 1/2 cup of walnuts and they ended up great. and they look beautiful which was suprising to me since the batter was very greasy

Theses weren't the best cookies I've ever had but they satisfied a cookie craving. I reduced the oil to 3/4c and added a little milk to make the batter smooth.

I just gotta say, this is hands down the yummiest chocolate chip cookie I've ever eaten and the texture is just perfect.  My DH and Ds have had to have some every night for a week now.  And all I did was mix up the dough and keep it in the fridge for when they ask for them - I made the second batch of dough today.  I'm not sure what all these other people are missing - these are great.

The Worst Chocolate Chip Cookie I've ever made! I made these because I was snowed in with no butter. I did not eat a single cookie, I knew when I tested the batter that they were horrible. Taste like vegetable oil, YUCK! I guess if you have a limited diet and must avoid butter but I think I'd rather skip the cookie myself.

These looked great and were crispy on the outside and chewy in the inside. Almond flavoring was a little different, I might just use vanilla next time. The dough looked so odd that I was worried about how they would bake, but they looked perfect. Thanks for recipe!

these were good! I was a little wary of using oil instead of butter and I admit that the batter looked a little weird but once they were baked they were lovely, delicately crispy on the outside with a soft, fluffy center... of course they're different from a butter recipe but by no means bad.  I haven't tried them cold yet though, so I guess this is based on them being fresh and warm out of the oven (which is near impossible not to like..)

WONDERFUL!!! The softest best tasting chocolate chip cookie around.  I made these for the holidays and they were eaten up by my family before I could give them out to neighbors.  I had to make another batch.  I didn't have almond extract but doubled the vanilla, it was superb!!! I am going to make another batch today to bring to the Superbowl Party. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I was pleasantly suprised by these cookies.  I didn't think they would be good without butter, but they were great.  The texture is soft and chewy.  Next time I would cut back on the almond extract because it was a bit too strong for me, but otherwise good.  I still think I like cookies better with butter, but this is perfect when you are out.

I love the idea of using vegetable oil instead 0f margerine or butter! Much lighter cookie. I altered this recipe a little by substituting the chocolate chips with a half cup of milk chocolate wafers, and a half cup white chocolate wafers, chopped in halves and quarters. I didn't have almond extract so I just used extra vanilla extract. They turned out wicked! And tasted even better, very flavorful too!I reccommend using the melting wafers I think they make a huge difference! Thanks!

I made this recipe because I wanted cookies, but didn't have any butter or shortening, only Oil. This is the only Chocolate chip cookie recipe I could find that used oil. I wasn't sorry! These cookies were very moist and my whole family loves them. I added more chocolate chips, omitted the almond extract(only because I had none) and doubled the vanilla to make up for the lack of almond flavor. Also, I used a little less white sugar. I love these cookies and will definitly make again! Thanks Emily!

Mm, these cookies were excellent. Even without the butter! I made some changes though since I can't help but be calorie-concious. I cut the oil down to 1/2 cup and the omitted the white sugar. It was still good though - although it takes a bit more elbow grease to mix the dry and the wet ingredients [since there's less of the wet ingrident].  Oh, and I didn't add the almond extract.. only because I didn't have any on hand.

I just clicked on this recipe to try out because I have no butter. I have not tasted them yet but I added more flavor like butter extract and vanilla +butter extract. They look good in the oven. I'm anxious to taste!

Yummy! The cookies came out soft on the inside and crunchy at the edges. Didn't have almond extract, so used twice as much vanilla extract. 
The recipe yielded 25 very big cookies, next time will use a smaller spoon to spoon the dough out so that the cookies come out normal sized (in which case the recipe will yield ~50 cookies.)

Super easy cookie recipe. Not as brown as traditional butter/shortening cookies, and much longer than 8-10 minutes but I think that's because I made large cookies. I will make these again.

A few tweaks as I used what I had left. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze half. I used king Arthur’s bread flour, I omitted vanilla and almond extract since I didn’t have any, used coconut sugar instead of brown sugar and it was delightful!!! I baked these 7minutes and they came out soft batch and cooked to perfection on the cooling rack! This was great for my daughter that is not having dairy. I used Enjoy Life Dairy Free chocolate chips as well so it was pretty  dairy free chocolate chip cookies!

I'll never make cookies with butter again!

I only did two different things, used 3 cups of flour (cause mixture was a little watery) and chilled for ten minutes before scooping (personal preference). My husband said they were the best cookies he's ever had!

The cookies were okay. The first try at the batter and it was really bland and boring, had no taste or flavor like the other comments. I’d recommend following the recipe but not adding chocolate chips. Instead, take a chunk of the dough and add some chocolate chips to it before baking it to taste it and see if you like it. This stops you from waste all of your chocolate chips and that way you can modify the recipe. For me I added a little over the 1 cup of packed brown sugar and two times the amount of white sugar, you’ll also need the salt in this so don’t forget to add it otherwise the salt won’t be able to enhance the flavor.

Normally I bake without salt but this needs them. I saved severally failed batches of dough and a bag of chocolate chips doing it the way I did. Making one batch and adding on the things I felt it needed, after the third time I added more sugar (and finally included the salt) it turned out good. Not perfect, but it was okay and since I have a sweet tooth I’m still going to eat it but I wouldn’t recommend this if you aren’t feeling a little experimental (meaning you want to try your own recipe but are to afraid of ruining the dough, this gives you a base so that you can add what you want to make it your own)

Lovvvvvve these!  I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and had to use olive oil as that’s all I had. Perfect chewy texture with a slightly crisp edge. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Needed to use up some chocolate chips and wanted to make a dessert last minute for some high schoolers.  I was searching for a cookie recipe that didn't need butter or shortening since I don't have either typically.  Found this.  So many mixed reviews, wasn't sure how they would turn out.  I mixed in some sesame oil and I didn't have enough brown sugar so I switched the brown sugar and white sugar ratios.  Overall the cookies were not bad.  They all got eaten which I consider a success!  You could definitely taste the oil though.

Yum! I think this is a great recipe. After reading the reviews and some comments that the lack of butter led to a bland cookie, I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons imitation butter flavoring. Why not - I already had it in the pantry. You can get it in the baking aisle at Kroger or HEB. I bet Walmart has it too. I use it for combining with rum flavoring extract to make a buttered rum flavor, but I guess that's beside the point. Added to this recipe, it gave an end product that tasted basically just like traditional chocolate chip cookies. The cookies do have a little bit different texture, but I prefer it to traditional. Working with the dough is a little different, but not too difficult. It seems like the cookies rise more than traditional, and they brown less readily. But they taste great and are easy to make!

I wanted cookies, but didn't want to wait for butter to soften and I tried this recipe.  Because I only had canola oil, so I used it, added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of butter flavoring.  I feel guilty reviewing this recipe, as I altered it, but I liked my  cookies warm and also after they had cooled completely.

Delicious !!!  However it had a little bit too much oil.... we will try to use about 1/4 cup (maybe a bit more) LESS of the Vegetable oil.  But other than that - they were delicious !

These are great if you’re trying to avoid cooking with butter. I didn’t have almond extract, so I doubled the vanilla extract.  Worked great! I also replaced the regular flour with gluten free flour to handle the food allergies we have in the house. They always come out great for dunking.

Just made these and was hesitant because of the reviews, but they were dang good! My 5 year old is off dairy so I made these and used dairy-free chocolate chips and they weregreat. I ate one to test if it was "dairy-free" good or "actual" good and it was totally actual good. Plenty of flavor. I'd make them and serve them as a regular cookie anytime. 

The only changes I made (I know, drives me crazy when people do this and review it too. Sigh) were a tad bit less oil (3/4 cup maybe/) based on reviews and then swapped out the almond extract for another tsp of vanilla. I didn't want to risk adding a new flavor that my kids would probably reject. ;-) I never write reviews (even thought I read them religiously) but this one needed another positive for those who all the lukewark reviews make anxious.

I made one modification which I found gives these a slightly finer texture - I substituted the white sugar for icing/confectioners sugar. Yum!

The day I made them I was at first disappointed. I thought I detected an aftertaste. I used canola oil which had been opened 2-3 weeks. I thought the next time I would try saffola and open it the day I baked. The following day I tried them again and they were great! My mom liked them and grandson inhaled them! I still prefer butter but as my daughter can’t have dairy these were a great substitute! I noticed when I went to her house there were only 3 left!

I really liked this recipe & didn't have the time to make cookies so I used a 9 inch glass pie pan. I had 2 bake it for 40 minutes @ 375 degrees. Plus I didn't have almond extract so I added another tsp of vanilla & it came out great! The bars is a little dark but the center is really soft! Thanks for the recipe!

Substituted almost everything, I make my own gluten free, wheat free flour, I used Splenda white and brown sugar, but i did use the egg, oil and salt as the recipe called for. I also used sugar free choc chips. Turned out great with the sbstitions.

I was a bit concerned making cookies with oil instead of butter. But I am glad I did! The kids had fun helping to make them, and they definitely enjoyed eating them!! I would make these again. They are quick, easy and made with normal on hand ingredients! You won't be disappointed.

I have to say, this was my first time making cookies from scratch, following a recommendation to use a blender to cream the sugars, and using half the almond and then half a tsp butter extract, and using tbsp to scoop, and just following the recipe otherwise, they turned out excellent. I couldn't tell the difference between them and store bought dough.  They spread alot for me so next time using tsp, but am definitely making these again. ??

I really liked the sound of this recipe but was concerned when I read a few negative reviews. Being without any butter and craving some cookies left me with no choice! I followed the recipe as written, but did add an eighth of a teaspoon of almond extract and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. Also, I dusted the chips  with flour before I added them to the batter. I baked the cookies for between nine and eleven minutes depending on the pan used. (non-stick or aluminum) They were very flavorful and had a nice chew to them. I think leaving them to cool on the pan eliminated the slightly oily texture that some complained about.

To those missing something from these cookies compared to butter made cookies, as an extra teaspoon of salt to make up for the lack of salt in the oil that the butter normally brings.

Okay, so I don't add ANY extracts to mine and instead of brown sugar, I take white sugar and add honey until it reaches the right consistency. I also add more chocolate because you always need more. They come out so good that a friend of mine with a gluten allergy willingly ate 9 of them- and they were not small cookies and she is a very small person.

I make these gluten free with Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 flour and Enjoy LIfe dairy free chocolate chunks.
While this isn't the exact same texture of ccc's it is pretty darn close.  Added in dried crans, walnuts and about 1/4 cup rough ground oatmeal.  Add extra vanilla and maybe some cinnamon. 
I make a batch, keep it in the fridge and bake a pan of cookies whenever we want some.

Absolutely delicious! These did not last long as the whole family loved them. I came across the recipe because we were out of butter and I'd like to get away from using butter anyhow. I absolutely love the almond extract in here. Thank you so much. This recipe will be heavily used in our family :)

Perfect cookie although I added some peanut butter & cut brown sugar to only 3/4 cup. The peanut butter really gave it more flavor & it was a perfect sweetness to it. Also instead of chocolate chips I used Hershey nuggets chopped up.
Took a little out added caramel sauce to it & made into 1 cupcake that I then made vanilla frosting. Needed only 1 bday cupcake so it was perfect.

Just made these awesome cookies for the second time, and they came out great. I made a few substitutions to make them a little healthier and I don't feel the taste was compromised at all. I replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour, half the oil with mashed bananas, and half the brown sugar with honey.

Made these all the time especially for my fiancé that lives in Guam. I send it via post office and my mom in law and my fiancé loves the recipe. Even my best friend is addicted to them that I make these almost every week. I just cut the sugar in half because I personally don't want it to be too sweet....and because of that, my family and friends loves them. Thank you for this great recipe!

I was positive I did something wrong when this dough was ready, it was very crumbly and oily in my mixer bowl, but I trudged on.  Glad a didn't mess with it.  This may be my new go-too recipe.  Tender,slightly crispy on the outside, soft in the middle.  I followed the recipe exactly.

I think cookie recipes, without butter tend to be just mediocre. These cookies come out soft, chewy, and perfect every time!! Don't change a thing. ;)

These were outstanding! I didn't have butter and wanted to bake cookies, so this was perfect! I should note that I am a butter snob. I think everything can be improved by using real butter. But, like I said, I was out. I read in the reviews that some people thought something was missing, so I doubled the salt. They were perfect! I also didn't have almond extract (sad, I love it) and I used caramel bits instead of chocolate chips (didn't have those either). This is an excellent cookie recipe that can do with a double dose of salt, and can rival the quality of a cookie made with real butter.

I decided to stop using shortening, so I looked for a recipe with oil and found this one. I did not have any almond extract so I used coconut extract. I am really happy with it, they came out delicious. I left them in the oven for about 12 minutes though, not 10.

Instead of 1 whole cup of semi sweet chocolate chips, I used 1/2 cup white chocolate
Chips then 1/2 cup if the semi sweet chocolate chips.  My husband and boys devoured them!     This recipe makes a lot of cookies, but I always drop them by 1/2 tbsp. so it looks like more and there super tiny!

I'm a professional baker and was looking for a recipe to use instead of my fave choc chip cookie recipe. I needed to switch out oil/ butter for my husbands cholesterol needs. I used part canola part sunflower oil which I use I. My organic cake recipes so I know that the taste of the oil is fine. I even added more vanilla which I always do incase it was bland. The cookie itself baked on parchment paper popped up nice and did not flatten after cooling( always a plus) however the taste was blahhh.

These cookies came out amazing. The only not so great thing and it wasn't a big deal it getting the chips to stay in the dough. I made it work and everyone loves them. The use of oil I like because butter is so expensive. I will make them again and again. ??

My 2 years old niece is allergic to milk protein so I was looking for a cookie recipe that doesn't have butter or trans fats. I made these and they came out excellent, substituted chocolate with dried berries for the same allergy problem. She loved them and so did everyone!

I make cookies vs buying for my kids and freeze them. I used organic flour and eggs. THEN IM OUT OF BUTTER! YIKES! :) I made 2 batches today for first time. I used canola oil. I was out of almond extract so added a tad more of the vanilla. The first batch I finished up old brown sugar and I put in chocolate chips and plain M&Ms. They were good but did have a odd after taste and texture was a bit different. The 2nd batch I opened a newly purchased brown sugar. I used chocolate chips and butter scotch chips. The dough itself was so much better. Texture and taste. I think the butter scotch chips gave it a good flavor as well. My 11 yr old liked the first batch over 2nd.Easy and will use again. It made more then 2 dozen. Rolled into small balls and shaped PERFECT cookies. Soft bake gooey 8 minutes and 11 min harder/crisp
My picture Right: batch 1 and Left Batch 2. Cook on napkin was a batch I forgot about. Crisp not burnt.

I did like that these made a very full cookie, however I too found them very bland. I wish I had added a bit more brown sugar. They were however a great substitute recipe for when I'm out of butter!  I replaced the eggs with apple sauce as well but was still surprised at how un-sweet these cookies are. A good basic recipe but definitely will need some tweaking.

The worst I've used for chocolate chip cookies. The consistency is really clumpy and the "dough" got so bad couldn't use beaters anymore. The time was also way off, I had cooked for 11 minutes, then additional 2 minutes another 4-5 times. The cookies also didn't seem to rise/spread as much as they should in comparison to other cookies. Overall disappointed in this recipe will not try again.

I searched for a recipe for cookies made with oil because we were out of butter & margarine. This recipe popped up, so I thought I'd give it a chance. I used 3/4 cup canola oil, and 1/4 cup milk. I found the batter to be quite moist, more like cake batter, but the cookies turned out great! They were crispy around the edges, and soft and chewy. Not quite as chewy as other recipes I've tried, but my family and I were very happy with the outcome.

My cookies turned out hard and lacked the chewy texture I was looking for, but they tasted OK. It's decent for a recipe substituting butter for oil, which must be taken into consideration. Both times I made them I used less oil and omitted the white sugar. It provided a good cookie base, though I don't think I would make these for public consumption. Butter cookies still taste better, in my opinion.

I experiment a lot with trying to make recipes healthier.  I made these last night with a good quality coconut oil, organic wholemeal flour, used the correct amount of brown sugar but omitted the white, and omitted the almond essence but added a bit more vanilla.  I also chopped up a 200gram bar of organic milk chocolate for the chocolate chips.  They were fantastic and my kids love them. Next time I will use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup xylitol.

Delicious!  I stumbled across these when I had a major craving for fresh cookies, but very little butter.  I've given it 4 stars because I did modify things a wee bit.
I used 1/4 cup melted butter and 3/4 cup canola oil.  I eliminated the almond extract because I can't stand the stuff, and increased the vanilla to 1 tbsp instead.  I used a combo of white and semi-sweet chocolate chips to use up what I had in the cupboard.  I also added 1 cup of rice crispies.  Something I've seen before with cookies and they add a bit of extra texture. 
I used my cookie scoop and baked for about 10 min.  If you want a chewy cookie do not leave them in too long, you want them to almost be a bit underdone.
These were a huge hit and are sure to be made again.

Out of butter so I decided to try these. Made them just to the recipie and won't be attempting them again. Not very sweet, would recommend leaving out the almond oil because it leaves a strange taste with the chocolate. Texture is good.

It was really delicious!  The cookies came out thick and moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I replaced the tsp. of Almond extract with another tsp. of Vanilla.  My kids didn't even know that I was out of butter.  YUMMY and very suprised I could make such great cookies without butter.  They don't taste great until they are cool.  :)

Good Recipe but I did make some changes which I think make the cookie much better, the first time I made this recipe I followed the recipe but the cookies turned out pretty dry . I changed the recipe by adding 1/2 tsp. baking soda & 1/2 tsp. baking powder. I also only added 1/2 cup oil + 2 Tbs cup oil, 2T water, & 4T milk. This greatly improved the texture & taste of the cookie, it turned out chewy & soft & now I love this recipe & its much healthier without the butter. ?

These are actually really good, and take all of 5 minutes to put together! Bakes up wonderfully into a soft, light cookie.

Really wonderful cookie!  I made this recipe without the chocolate chips and the flavor was like a grown-up sugar cookie.  I will definately be making these again.  The ONLY downside is that the oil causes the dough to slide right out of the bowl-- no dough to munch on while the cookies bake!

I didn't mind them.  My boyfriend and a couple of guest enjoyed them.  I think they would of been better without the almond extract.  I didn't like the taste of the almond but if you enjoy that taste then these are good cookies.

I liked the cookies. They weren't the best cookies in the world, but they were stil good. I used 3/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1 cup. At the end I needed to add a little  bit of water though. These cookies are very good for people with allergies to dairy products (exept for the chocolate chips). My daughter doesn't like nuts so I left those out.

My Dad is allergic to butter, so this is a great alternative. The first time they turned out a bit cakey (my measures may have been off). If you have that problem, try taking the baking soda down to 3/4 tsp. As another member noted, losing the butter also means losing the milk solids. So, to reduce the oiliness, I used 3/4 oil with 1 tbsp water and about 1/2-1 oz of cream cheese to replace the saturated fats and milk solids. Add a bit extra brown sugar and a bit less salt to compensate for any cream cheese flavor, and that should bring these tasty treats closer to the original butter recipe. Enjoy!

Just okay. I definitely prefer the taste and texture of butter in chocolate chip cookies but if you are looking for an alternative these are fine.

Truely the best cookie I have ever made. I never had real butter, and somehow the cookies I made (with margarine) always had a bread-like texture or were cracking hard. These cookies are healthy and pretty darned good! I made a batch and it was eaten up by my family in seconds!!

I'm not sure why I'm not giving this a 5 - it is a great cookie!  I just need to experiment with some other ingredients to see how versatile it can be - has anyone tried this recipe with oatmeal?  I used safflower oil and it was yummy!

Great cookie if you don't have butter.  I added a little extra salt (because I usually use salted butter in my cookie recipes) and used double vanilla (no almond).  Turned out perfectly.  I still like butter cookies better, but these were a good second place (and less expensive).

This is a great chocolate chip recipe! I didn't have almond extract, so I just added a bit more vanilla instead. They tasted very rich since there's so much oil in them. In the future I'll try to cut down the oil to the perfect amount.

We put in two batches at once and each had a different texture. The heating element is at the bottom and the cookies on the bottom rack had a plain, smooth surface. The cookies on the top rack had a crispy, textured top layer, as well as a crisp bottom layer, with a perfect center. We chose to cook the rest of the batter on the top shelf.

For some added texture and nutrition, we added maybe 1/4 cup of oats (we didn't actually measure it) to the last half of the recipe. I preferred the choc chip oat cookies, but both the plain and oatmeal ones were excellent!

Something's missing from these...I tried them because my original recipe calls for butter, of which I am out of at the moment. Definitely not perfect, not the worst, but I will NOT make them again.

I made a couple substitutions in the recipe - whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and splenda instead of sugar.  That way I can call them "healthy" and eat them guilt free. :)

I don't like using butter in my recipes so this was a great find for me. I used vanilla instead of the almond extract. They're really soft and chewy and delicious.

Super yummy!  I usually make a yummy chocolate chip cookie recipe that is crispy but these are much softer.  I will keep both recipes to use because they are a perfect opposite and just as yummy and delicious!  If you are looking for a great soft cookie recipe without being mushy this is it- these are great!

Delicious.  I love my cookies soft, and this recipe does exactly that.  I added one cup of flaxseed to the dry mix, and thus had to add a little extra vegetable oil to keep the consistency good.  I also added about twice as much vanilla extract.  If you do not like the tast of almond extract, add about half as much.  Overall, a big hit!

These were quit epossibly the worst cookies I've ever tasted.  The use of oil instead of shortening was a very bad idea--the cookies tasted almost rancid.  Cannot recommend.

These cookies came out great! I'm not personally a huge fan of chewy chocholate chip cookies,but even I thought they were delicious. My husband and guests really, really enjoyed them and kept complimenting them. I was running low on flour, so I used 1/2 cup of whole-wheat flour and they still came out terrific.  Thanks!

I tried this recipe because I am doing a cookie sale fundraiser with my youth group. I didn't want to use butter because of the expense. The oil worked fine. I tested the recipe prior to using it the day we did all of the baking. I made sure that the cookies stayed soft for 2 days. They did!  And they weren't bland like other reviews said.

Very Good, great to put in lunch box, I love the unique flavor the almond extract gives Thanks for sharing the recipe.
