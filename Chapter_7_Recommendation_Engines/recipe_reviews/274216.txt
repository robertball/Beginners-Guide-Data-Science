Added more chicken stock and curry paste as previous reviewers suggested.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This was a simple recipe with simple ingredients and I love it when I find a recipe like this that’s easy to make with ingredients that I usually have on hand.  However, I omitted the fish sauce because I didn’t have any.  I also substituted small egg noodles for the rice because I was craving chicken noodle soup but with a red curry flavour.  Lastly, I used 4 cups of broth because I like there to be plenty of the liquid part of the soup, and next time I will probably add 5 cups broth.  It was excellent with noodles, nice red curry flavour, and I will make it again soon.

I used my turkey carcass boiled down for the broth and meat then used Tika Masala Sauce as I couldn't find curry paste. I added more curry powder and turmeric to make up. I served the soup with Naan Bread, cilantro on top with a dust of red pepper. It was great.

7.19.19  This is a very mellow soup, and I deviated from the instructions only once, and that was by adding more red curry paste to suit our tastes.  Nice contrast between the sweetness of the coconut milk and the kick from the red curry paste.  Very easy to make and comes together quickly.  This one’s a keeper.
