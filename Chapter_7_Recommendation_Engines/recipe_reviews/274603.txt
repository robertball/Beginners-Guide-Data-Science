I have made a recipe that cooks chicken thighs on the same cooking sheet with the potatoes.  The recipe is the same except it has 3 tablespoons of lemon juice with the rest of the ingredients and marinate for at least 20 minutes. Delicious!  I ordered the zaâ€™atar spice online and store it in the refrigerator.  It is worth the price!  I will make again.

This recipe was easy as is. It tasted fine but I might adjust the amount of za'atar since I feel it is a bit too much for the amount of potatoes. I halved the recipe and still it seemed a lot as the flavor was a bit overpowering. Thanks for the recipe!
