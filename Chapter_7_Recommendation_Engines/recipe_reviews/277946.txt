Super tasty! A problem I found is that once the cold shrimp hits the melted butter/oil mixture, it starts solidifying and clumping up, so it's a little difficult to toss together. I ended up spreading what had solidified over top the shrimp once in the dish. I used extra large shrimp instead of medium, and mine were done at 12 minutes, so definitely start checking before the stated 15-18 minutes. You don't want to overcook shrimp. I used Italian seasoned panko because that's what I had on hand - it added even more flavor. I also found I needed less panko than stated. I used just over 1/4 cup and that was plenty.  I loved the crunch of the panko with the buttery shrimp!

I made two minor changes that I think improved the dish. Instead of plain panko, I used the seasoned ones. Then I mixed them with the butter in the original recipe to form a buttery toipping.

Love this! Only thing I would change for next time is use less butter.

This was perfect! Quick, rich, and yummy!  I added more garlic, and a tad of Parmesan on top of the bread crumbs.  17 minutes. Melted the butter slowly, and added the shrimp, with not too much temperature difference.
