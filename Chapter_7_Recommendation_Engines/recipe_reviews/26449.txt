I omitted the chicken broth and added a cube of chicken buillon instead.  The soup was still a little thin, so I cooked it uncovered for a bit.  The result was spicy and delicious.

I loved this soup!! I will definitely be making this again. I think it helped that I used my homemade chicken broth and fresh lime juice in the recipe. It was relatively easy to prepare, my fiance helped and this one will be a regular on our dinner table!! We got creative and added "mix-ins" to the soup, shredded mexican cheese, avocado, and chopped onion. I substituted fat-free sour cream for the yogurt which worked well. One of those recipes that's even BETTER the next day.

I could see this becoming a staple in our house, it was delicious.  I left out the red pepper flakes since I was using medium spicy salsa.  I served with the Baked Tortilla Chips found on this site.

Very easy and incredibly delicious.  Even people who think they don't like black beans have tried it and loved it so much they've asked for the recipe.  I "tweak" it using either medium or mild salsa based on my guests' preferences, but I prefer medium.  Wonderful!

We really enjoyed this.  I likewise blended the two cans of beans and left the third one whole.  I used medium salsa and about half of the crushed red pepper.  I thought it had the right zip, but hubby thought it was a touch too spicy.  Will definitely make again.  Yummy!!!

This was a very delicious and easy recipe.  I wanted a more chunky soup, so I saved some of the black beans from the blender, and had them swimming around whole.  I also threw in some smoked sausage to ruin an otherwise healthy dish!

Suprisingly Yummy! This recipe was great! After I put the ingredients together, I was a little unsure of how I would like it, but it tasted great! A small dollop of fat free sour cream instead of the yogurt topped it off!

I have used this recipe numerous times and absolutely love it!  It is delicious, easy, filling and definitely better the next day! I also top mine with fat-free cheese and sour cream.

This soup is not pretty but it is yummy.  My husband didn't want to even try it, but he said to make it again.  I used Pampered Chef Southwestern Seasoning in it.  Yummmmmmy
