This is our FAVOURITE cinnamon popcorn recipe.  We tweaked it a little; but stuck to the skeleton of the recipe.  It was fast, easy, and great all the way around!  We used three bags of light microwave popcorn, a 7 oz. pkg. of Red Hots, and added approx. 1 tsp. cinnamon oil.  I love that you don't have to bake this recipe and it works just fine.  If you like it warm and gooey, eat right away; but if you like it crisy let it cool!  Bravo to this winner of a recipe!

I had lost an old recipe a while back and found this one about 2 years ago. My family and friends rate it as a favorite, only problem is it disappears as fast as I can make it.  Great for Christmas time!  The only thing I do recommend is putting it on cookie sheets (spread out), and cook in oven @ 200degrees, stirring every 15 min. for 1 Hr. total(This was part of my original recipe I had). It truelly takes away the stickiness, and will disappear faster without as much of a mess.  Love it!!

I made this recipe with air popped popcorn which was really easy.  I also took note of other reviewer's notes of "stickiness" and went ahead and boiled the candy to hard crack before pouring it on - which worked great.  My only complaint is that it tasted more "buttery" than "cinnamony" maybe because I used real butter.  The butter just overwhelmed the red hots.  Maybe I will try a little less butter next time.  Otherwise - it looked great! This would be awesome for Christmas!!

This recipe is awesome!  It tastes just the popcorn you can find at a gourmet shop!  The only thing I will do differently next time, is dry the popcorn in the oven for about 30 minutes on 200 degrees.  It is still a little chewy to me.

Very pretty pink color!  I agree that it was too chewy so I did throw mine in the oven @ 200* for about 30 minutes.  Gives it a nice crunch.  Not a hot cinnamon flavor, more mild and it is buttery.  All and all pretty good.  I am going to make some more for my child's Valentine's party at school.

Oh this is really good!! THANKS for this yummy recipe!! I tried SKYCANDYGIRL's suggestion "I cooked the cinnamon mixture in micro, stirring every minute until candy was melted and then let it boil for 5 minutes straight, undisturbed." & scorched the heck out of the mixture & had to toss it (must have too powerful of a microwave?)... then followed the recipe to a "T"... THEN threw it in the oven @ 200 for 30 minutes (stir every 10 minutes) & it came out perfect & crunchy. My 2nd batch was a double batch & it came out just fine.

I think next time I'll add more red hots but there is nothing wrong with it the way it is either.  It was really good the first night but the second evening it was awesome!

I love this recipe! It always gets compliments and a recipe request.  Plus, since the shop that I first tried cinnamon pc at is now closed, it's so nice to be able to make my own.  Plus this is sooo easy!!  5 stars for sure!!!

I thought this was pretty good.  I followed exactly.  The paper bag method doesnt really work well at all.  I ended up dumping mine in a large roasting pan and stirring it.  Then I baked it in the oven for 30 minutes too.  Came out just a tad chewey, so next time I will cook the candy mixture a couple minutes longer.  Thanks for posting.  I will definatly make this one again!

This turned out ok.  I wasn't as hot as I would have liked.  It also turned out chewy, not crunchy.  I will retry this with suggestions from other people (Cook the candy longer, use less butter and more red hots)

UPDATE: I retried this reciped and used 1/2 the butter, twice the amount of red hots and twice the corn syrup and cooked the candy to 300 degrees.  WAY BETTER.  It's hotter and delightfully crunchy.  Very please with the changes.

Would be sooooooo much better if it was baked.  It would be crunchy.  Next time I try this, I will bake it like I do my Amish caramel corn recipe.  

This one is mushy.  Hardly anyone touched it at the party, and the caramel one was almost gone!

I can't believe how good and simple this recipe is.  I used one 6oz box of the "Red Hots" candies & it turned out great.  I used two bags of microwave popcorn (light butter). I recommend "drying" it in the oven for 1 hour at 200 stirring every 15 min.  It takes more time but will be good enough to give as a gift.  I will never have to buy cinnamon popcorn again.  Thanks ALISSASMOM!!  :-)

Pretty good, I made a couple minor changes. I added just a tiny bit of cinnamon extract and wish I had added more, just to give me a little more spice. I also microwaved the whole bowl for 30 seconds and stirred, making it have a little more crunch.

I love cinnamon/redhots, this is quite good, I agree with previous review of it's more buttery than cinnamonnie but it still tastes good, next time I'll use a little less butter and more light corn syrup and more red hots. I also used microwaved popcorn, and cooked the syrup over the stove. I poured the shaken popcorn out on a sheet of parchment paper to cool. Edit: I made this a 2nd time, this time using less butter, and more corn syrup and redhots and also baked for at hour at 200 degress, flipping the popcorn every 20 minutes. turned out amazing! I bought cinnamon oil, so next time I'll be using that as well, can't wait to try it!

Incredible! This is definitly a very nice change to popcorn.  I made it for our game night with the friends and everyone loved it!  I didnt make it exactly tho. Some reviews mentioned it not being cinimony enough and it was too sticky.  I used 2 microwave bags of fat free butter flavored popcorn(fat free has less flavor to it), and one 8 ounce bag of red hots. First of all, Im much to lazy to pop my own popcorn and it seems a waste to only use part of the 8 ounce bag of red hots, so i threw them all in. I cooked it on medium heat until the red hots were melted and bubbly. Then I mixed in with popcorn then baked for 15 min in a 300 degree oven.  These were not sticky or chewy. Just right for me. Very awsome and looks so pretty. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was easy to make. I cut the recipe in half. I did one bag of popcorn. 1/4c. butter, 1tbs corn syrup, 1 oz of the candy. Cooked it on the stove until everthing was melted together. Waited till it kind of foam up a lil. I put the popcorn in a larg bowl. Then mixed it all up. Came out great! My mom love it!

Not as "red hot" as I thought it would be (much of that flavor cooked off), but I think what makes it addicting is that little hit of "red hot" you get after the first bite!

I used two bags of movie theater butter popcorn and three mini bags of kettle corn popcorn. I used six ounce boxes of Red Hots, and left the other ingredients as noted. I had to make two batches of glaze because it didn't coat well enough with just one batch. I didn't have the sticking issues that other reviews did. Maybe because I didn't have as much glaze? I think one batch of glaze would sufficiently cover 1-1.5 bags of popcorn. I definitely popped more than the 1/2 cup the recipe called for, and will scale down next time. Tastes delicious!

Updated to add: I took the leftovers to work, and found the entire bag on a co-worker's desk at the end of the day!

I made this today to go in Christmas packages. I am not sure what went wrong or where but the sauce never quite became a sauce. The butter and syrup melted and mixed but the red hots never totally melted away, they became a gooey mess. I mixed it all and baked it to everyone's suggestions to get the crunch but I am still not sure this recipe will make it into the packages. It tastes okay but not sure that it will be a big hit.

I made this for my Twilight party (I wanted lots of red food) and we loved it. I didn't realize until I started cooking it that I was out of corn syrup so I used honey and it worked. I did take the advice of others and baked it. Mine took longer to crisp up; probably because on the honey. Kids and adults loved it! Thanks!

This was very good.  I made the popcorn on top of the stove in veg oil, and it was a little greasy.  So I added a microwave bag of popcorn and it turned out fine.  I rolled the popcorn into balls right before it set, everyone loved them. Will make again!!

I just tried this recipe. It turned out great. I read the reviews of others . I didn't have cinnamon oil so I put about a tablespoon of ground cinnamon in with syrup. I also used Brachs Cinnamon Bits instead of red hots. Used one teaspoon less of butter.  Also listened to everyone else and dried it out in a 200 degree oven for an hour turning ever 15 mins. It is wonderful!

I added extra red hots to this recipe.  It was good, but not great.  The flavor wasn't strong enough even with the extra red hots.

I used air popped popcorn for this recipe and took the advice of another reviewer and used alittle less butter than called for. Otherwise, this was delicious. I did not bake mine as others have and found it came out just fine so it seems as an unnecessary step to me, but it probably depends on how crunchy you like it. I mixed this half and half with kettle corn for my son's Valentine's Day party.

I sent this to my husband in Iraq, and he enjoyed this surprise. I did have a hard time getting the popcorn evenly coated in the paper bag so I ended up dumping it all back into the pot and mixing it with a big spatula. Next time I'll also probably spread it out on wax paper to let it dry a bit because he did mention that the popcorn clumped up some. However the taste was great, and his soldiers have requested more.

very good, but I would change it just a bit.  I only used 1/3c butter and it seemed fine.  I changed the butter due to other comments about it being mushy or too buttery.  Next time, I'd also like to try using a bit of cinnamon oil for more cinnamon flavor.  This was still very good and cinnamon flavored just as it is, but I'd like maybe a little more flavor.  I also baked mine just 10 min at 200 degress, stirred it, then shut the oven off and left it in the cooling oven.  It turned out very nice and crispy after baking.  Though I really did like it just straight after pouring the syrup on it, also.

This was a good recipe, but I made some adjustments based on other's comments and my own popcorn experiences!  I used air popped corn and doubled the recipe.  Then I used 3/4 cup butter (instead of 1 c) and let the butter/red hot mixture boil for 2 minutes in the microwave after it had completely melted.  I also sprayed a paper bag with cooking spray, mixed the popcorn with the sugar mix in the bag and microwaved it for 2 minutes, stirring after 1 minute.  It was crunchy and yummy!  Next time I might add cinnamon oil.

This was a really good snack we all enjoyed it, I set my oven at 200 and spread the syrup covered popcorn on a buttered cook sheet and baked for 1 hour stiring the popcorn every 15minutes it was just like store bought carmel corn.

I loved this recipe. I used brown sugar instead of white to give it a cinnamon roll taste. CAUTION: Highly addictive.

I used an air popper and the wet popcorn everyone talks about was not a problem because I didn't have to use the oil.  The flavor of cinnamon is quite off.  I was expecting it to be more cinnamony and maybe hotter.  I'm not sure, but I think I might try a recipe with a revision using hot tamales or something.

I had great results with this recipe. Paperbag method and all. I did need to use microwave popcorn, but simply microwaved the popcorn and did the sauce part on the stove top.I popped 3 bags of light popcorn to one 7 oz bag of red hots, and kept the remaining ingredients as is. You do need to shake the contents of your bag for a solid minute, but it works out fine.

I used a bag of lite microwave popcorn & I'm not sure how much cinnamon candies I used as I had, long ago, poured the bag into an airtight container but I think it was about a cup (maybe a bit more) & it tasted like just the right amount. I too crisped mine up in a 200 degree oven for 30 minutes to avoid sticky hands. Both my grandsons loved it ... even I ate my fair share. Thanks!

I am a very seasoned cook and baker.  I made this today and let me tell you I will NEVER do this again!  I was looking for an easy cinnamon popcorn recipe and tried this and ended up burning myself more than it was worth!  The cinnamon mix stuck to the bag and didn't shake in the bag very well.  I grabbed the bag that was tipping over and burned my finger in the process.  I wasted popcorn, redhots and corn syrup and have a huge burn on my finger.   DO NOT RECOMMEND!

The second time I made it I increased the syrup ingredients by 1/3 which made it really good.  You could achieve the same result by decreasing the popcorn.  I used microwave popcorn, natural flavor w/o butter.  It worked really well.

One of my favorite popcorns, but it definitely needs to be tweaked a little. I use air popped popcorn &  put in into a large dutch oven. Then make the cinnamon stuff in the microwave, stirring every minute until it's completely melted. Pour the hot cinnamon syrup over the popcorn & stir w/ a spatula or wooden spoon thoroughly until combined. The bag idea doesn't distribute the syrup well. You definitely want to stick it in a 200-250 degree oven for a good 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes to crisp it up.

I made a half-batch because I wanted to try it. Really delicious, but a little chewy. I'm wondering if air gets at it may dry out a bit. The next time I make this I will follow some of the reviewers' suggestions such as baking it in a low oven, possibly microwaving the mixture longer, cutting back on the butter and increasing the red hots. I'm thinking also that the hot, humid weather is probably not the best for something like this.

I increased this reciped taking in account from JESUSDIEDFORME.  I MADE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO RECIPE: 
6 bags for Pop Scret Homestyle 
3 boxs of (6 oz each) Red Hot for a total of 18 oz Red Hots
1 1/4 cup butter plus a little more butter for a (total butter 1 1/3 cup butter)
a heavy measure of 1/4 cup plus 1 tblscorn syrup plus another 1 - 2 tbls (total 1/4 cup plus 3 tbls. corn syrup)  I HEATED ON THE STOVE STOP FOR BETTER CONTROLLE. 

NO CINNAMON OIL USED may cause a verision. 

Good Luck!

This popcorn is the best! I took the suggestion of air popping the popcorn and found out that if you double the recipe you can add an extra 1/2cup of uncooked popcorn ,there was pleanty of syrup to cover it. I did tweak it a bit though. Spray your paper bag with a cooking spay, popcorn comes right out without sticking. I added 1/4t of cinnamon oil to the syrup mixture right before pouring onto popcorn. And most important spresd on cookie sheets and bake at 200* for 1 hour. It comes out nice and crisp! enjoy :)

This is fantastic if you want a quick and easy snack that is a little funkier than plain popcorn, chips, or the like.    It's also easy to cut the recipe down to a single serving, which is nice.

5 star all the way! Cinnamon popcorn is my favorite flavor of popcorn and I always thought that I could probably make it myself.  Well, now I can.  This recipe was perfect.  However, taking the advice of others I used only half the butter and I did spread it out on a baking sheet and baked for 1 hour at 200, stirring every 15 minutes. (My caramel corn recipe bakes it this way)  It came out crunchy and very flavorful.  I also doubled the recipe because I was so excited to try it and I am so glad that I did.  Thanks!

Fantastic recipe! To give the popcorn more cinnamon flavor and make it less buttery, I used fireball candies instead of Red Hots. Just the generic store brand worked excellent. However, due to their size, the fireballs won't melt completely before the mixture is ready, so I just strained them out.
