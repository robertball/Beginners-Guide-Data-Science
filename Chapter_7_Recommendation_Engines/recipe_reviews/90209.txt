I loved everything about this recipe, except for the cooking of the frozen peas. I recommend putting your frozen peas into a bowl of cold water to thaw for about 20 minutes, drain well, then add to the onion/garlic saute mixture for just a couple minutes to heat through. This way, you'll avoid the wrinkly and mushy look of overcooked frozen peas, and the peas will stay a vibrant green color. The flavor of this dish is great and is a nice change from the same old blah peas. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

Let me preface this by saying I am not a big fan of cooked peas....raw & hidden in a salad w/lots of other yummy stuff (and dressing!), is good....cooked, bleh!  These peas, however, me likey!  These were excellent, as well as quick/easy to prepare, made w/ingredients readily on hand at our house, and an added bonus...good for me!!  I cooked according to recipe, except I didn't measure oil (dash), onion (1/2 of one...looked like enough and it was, thought the whole onion would not have been too much either), or garlic (lots and lots of pre-minced).  I also panicked a little and added some extra broth because it didn't "seem" like enough (it would have been...that's what the recipe is for, moron).  One caveat, my peas ended a little on the mushy side because of my own timing....I tried to let them sit (covered still) while the rest of the meal caught up....so I recommend serving immediately.  Thanks for a great veggie side, easy enough for weeknights, but respectable enough for guests, too.

I love this reciPEA. I like to cook my peas in the microwave so they can keep their pop. When I say Cook I mean defrost. I poured the chicken stock over my peas and defrosted them for a few minutes. After I sauteed the onion and garlic I poured it over the peas. I let it marinate for a few minutes before serving. My three year old loved it.

These peas were very tasty.  I didn't want to open a can of chicken broth to use only one tablespoon, so I used water and sprinkled in a few chicken boullion granuals.  I took the advise of other reviewers and topped the peas with freshly grated Parm.  Very good recipe, thank you.

Very tasty and elegant way to serve peas.  I had only canned peas, so used 2 cans.  It would have been better with frozen, as the recipe states.  I used a regular yellow onion, and 1/2 of it would have been plenty.  A whole Vidalia or other nicely flavored onion would be best, as the is the predominant taste of this dish.  Instead of the chicken broth, I used a whole bouillon cube dissolved in 1/3 cup water and used the whole thing.  Extra salt was not needed.  Very nice, easy, and versatile side dish!  Thanks!

Wow I was surprised at how good this simple recipe turned out.  My family has never been a fan of peas so I was looking for a way to make them taste a little different...this recipe was it.  I did have frozen corn leftover from another recipe so I put it in the last 2 minutes to heat.  Hubby ate 2 helpings (so did I)!  Next time I'd like to try it with a little crumbled bacon.

Very good for what it is  - simple peas with onions and garlic.  The problem here is the cooking time - 10 minutes?  No; just long enough to heat through.

The best peas I've ever had.  I followed the recommendation of using chicken bouillon dissolved in water in lieu of the broth.  Very tasty!

I've made this many and thought it was fantastic. Its the perfect compliment when your cooking an italian and still want your family to have a vegetable side dish. I make this when I make any thing from risotto to lasagna.

I was looking for something to spiff up boring frozen peas to get the fam to eat them without force - saw this recipe and was like OK I'll give it a try but I doubt it'll be good because they aren't adding much - BOY WAS I WRONG! I used butter instead of olive oil and caramelized the onions (diced) - then added the peas and the rest of the ingredients...just sprinkled a few chicken bullion granules and water over the top instead of the broth. the taste was phenomenal. I ran out and wanted more, and again kinda craved them the next day - who'da thunk it?? Hit a grand slam with this one!!

Great side dish. Used fresh peas (started out with 1 kilo of peas in pods) and added bacon in the beginning with 1 tbs. butter to saute the garlic and onion.

I am giving this 5 stars because I HATE peas, and this recipe allowed me to eat them. :) My toddlers loved it as well (but they love peas, so that's to be expected). I used a 12 oz bag of peas because that's all I had, but I didn't need to adjust the recipe at all. I used one medium onion. When I added the peas they didn't need to cook a full 20 minutes. I removed them from the heat at about 12 minutes and kept them covered for another 10 minutes (just waiting for the rest of our dinner to be ready). They were done through with a little crunch left in them. Great recipe!

Easy and quick. I cooked these for a bit less than the 10 minutes stated (I don't like soggy peas), tasted them, thought "eh, peas" added a very small amount of salt (homemade stock with no added salt) and took to the table.  They ended up sitting a few extra minutes covered.  My first bite, I thought "Wow, really yummy".  I think the salt helped a little but what made the difference between eh and wow was the few extra minutes.  Don't rush this and let the flavors come together.  You won't be disappointed.

Great recipe for a side dish with a nice Italian twist! Plus, it's a great way to perk up plain 'ol peas.  Very easy to throw together and has a wonderful flavor.  This would be a nice accompaniment to any main dish.

I just love this extremely simple recipe.  It really does make a very quick and easy side, but taste's so good.  I followed the recipe exactly other than added chopped bacon.  I know this will be used by me again and again!

This is a delicious way to prepare peas.  I used half an onion, diced.  Don't worry about how little liquid the recipe calls for.  The peas turn out flavorful and perfect by steaming.  There is so much flavor from the oil, onions, garlic and salt, that the stock wouldn't have been missed.  I'll be making this frequently.

These peas were wonderful! I sauteed the finely chopped onions in EVOO and a little butter, then added the garlic. Then turned off the burner until the rest of the dinner was ready (grilled hot dog and mashed sweet potatoes and salad). When the rest was almost ready I added the peas, some water and a little chicken bouillon and Lawry's season salt & a dash of pepper, and 1 finely chopped white mushroom. Heated that all through and our amazing dinner was ready. This recipe made my favorite veggie even better. Thanks WORSHIPWARRIORMT!!!

Italian Peas' Haiku: "Easy, tasty peas. But they didn't keep their 'pop.' Still, I'm glad I tried!" I love frozen peas - their bright green color and satisfying pop, but this recipe made them more shrivel-ey than I like. On the other hand, the simple addition of garlic, onion and chick. stock was delightful, and /licks-lips/, all the better w/ a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top!

This side dish has always been on the table growing up.  I have to say that I prefer when my mother cooks them with canned sweet peas, they have a little more flavor than the frozen peas.  But either way, they are a staple in Italian Side Dishes.  MMM MMM MMM.  Please make sure to do exactly as the recipe says though, do not use a microwave to cut corners!

If you LOVE just plain peas with butter and a little salt....then this recipe might not be for you.  Made this recipe and the pot wasn't emptied as it usually is when I make peas.  In my opinion, there's not much improving on something so simple and tasty as plain peas with butter and salt.

Very good.  One time when I made them, I didn't have an onion, so I seasoned them with onion powder, and it still came out pretty well.

I made this recipe as written tonight and it came out fantastic.  My wife and I were really surprised by how much difference such a small recipe could make in "just peas".  There is also a ton of opportunity for tweaking in there as well!  Great Recipe and Thanks!!

This is an awesome recipe. Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients. 
The onions and seasoning perfectly enhance fresh green peas. Out of all the dishes I made for Thanksgiving this one recieved the most praise.

I did make a few changes to this nice dish. I thawed the peas under cold water. After caramelizing the onions, half the amount, I added the garlic, one teaspoon Italian seasoning. some onion powder, the salt and pepper and a tad of the red pepper flakes someone else recommended. I then added the peas and tossed continually until they were hot. After placing a cover on them and letting them sit for an hour they were amazing, as everything had married so well.

This was just ok. A lot better than plain peas but from the reviews I read, I expected more.  I made the recipe to a T  but I thought it could use more flavour so I added a bit of butter and dill. This made it much better.

This was great!  I made it twice, one with frozen peas and once with fresh peas, and you could really tell the difference, so I'd definitely recommend the fresh ones.  I got my fresh peas at Trader Joe's in the raw chopped vegetable section.

"How to make frozen peas taste even better" --this is the way to do it! I really don't know how I didn't have garlic around, so I subbed a little good quality garlic powder...though I know it's not the same. I like frozen peas and usually have them in the freezer for a quick veg side, so next time I'll use the garlic--yum! I did not want to open a can of chicken stock for this so I used a quick splash of water.

Excellent, easy, and fast! Just finished dinner and my 3 year old actually ate his peas! I did add to the orginal, used up some leftover bacon and top with shredded Parmesan. I also cooked mine for only 5 minutes, I can't stand mushy peas. I thought it was a good recipe, but the addition of the bacon and Parm was really wonderful! Thanks for submitting, this one is going in my regular rotation! :)

I was skeptical but this worked out beautifully. Living in an off-campus dorm room, I didn't even have garlic, onion, or chicken stock! But with onion powder, garlic salt, season salt, and boullion cube I made a very tasty little dish. Highly recommended!

Im surprised how good this was given how conventional all of the ingredients were.  I used chicken boullion granules because the peas had enough water with them since they had been frozen.  Delicious!!  They were not mushy at all.  I think I may never have plain 'ol peas again!!

Very quick and easy.  I don't usually like peas, but this is a great way to use them.  I made as a side dish with Chicken Scampi II from this site.  I can definitely see myself making this again.

Super good! We love frozen peas and this added to the Eggplant Tomato Bake that we made to go with this.  I had to make a few changes,  I used real butter instead of olive oil to saute the onions first, and chicken boullion cube with 2-3 Tbl. water - no salt due to the boullion cube.  this kept me from opening a whole can of chicken stock. This was a big hit and delight.  I also served a nice Merlot with dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't believe I'm saying this, without any sort of sarcasm...those peas were DELICIOUS! I seriously ate the entire bag to myself.  Yum, yum, yum and HEALTHY!?  What!?  What happened?  Where am I?  Peas usually make me gag.  Thank you Worshipwarrior MT!!!

Pretty good.  Don't usually like peas.  I'm always looking for ways to spruce up vegetables.

Liked this recipe, but even with cutting back to 1/2 onion it was still overpowering to the dish.  Even so, I will make this again - I'll just use 1/4 of an onion.

Very good. Nice flavor. I thawed the peas in warm water then just heated through as a previous reviewer suggested. We liked them and would make again - maybe will add some mushroom next time!

defrost frozen peas & add just enough to heat.  Fresh peas, blanch for 2 min. & then add & cook for another 2 min.  We use chicken broth constantly so having a tsp. in the fridge is normal.  Boullion is too salty.  Otherwise a fantastic way to serve peas.

These have been served in my family ever since I was a child.My grandmother was italian.It is our tradition to serve them at special occasions.Frozen has never been used.I buy a young tender pea in a can like the Leisure brand.Garlic was never used but I may give it a try.I have served these to friends that have never tasted peas cooked this way and always recive complements.These are a keeper for me.You need to try them at least once.

Loved this recipe.  So simple. I have an old Italian cookbook and their recipe calls for a little grated parmessan on top, which is more fattening, but tastes great.

I, too, cooked my frozen peas first then added them to the sauted onion and garlic.

This recipe added a little something extra to peas fairly quickly and easily.  However I was not impressed with the end result.  It didn't taste all that different than frozen peas heated up.  I will not be making this again.

Haha.  I made this with 1 tablespoon of chicken bouillon, instead of chicken stock - and it still tasted good!  If you opt this route, cut down to a 1/2 tbs of bouillon and don't add salt.  I would also cut down on onions next time - too much onion flavor.

this receipe is very good but i really simplified it! i cooked the onions & garlic in oil in a microwave safe dish with lid till tender.  heated 1/3 cup water dissolved chicken bouillon cube. 
added peas and broth to onion/garlic and cook approx 8 minutes on high or till your likness. then you can just use same dish for table!

I'm not sure if I cooked this wrong and that's why I was unimpressed, but I really didn't think they tasted much different than a regular bag of peas without the onions or garlic. I didn't use fresh garlic though, I used already minced from a jar. Maybe that made a difference. I'd rather just make normal peas and use some salt, pepper and butter.

Very good in a pinch recipe..I had peas and garlic and onion and tried this.  Put Parm cheese on top of them before serving and they were good..I think next time going to put some hot sauce in them for a little extra kick as they were a little bland....

Just okay, nothing spectacular.  My husband has been making a variation of this dish for years.  He doesn't use chicken stock. and I think this is an unnecessary step.  Keep it simple and enjoy.

I made this as directed and while it was pretty good, it wasn't amazing like I was expecting based on the reviews.  I found that 1/2 onion was plenty for us.  Still, it's a easy, different way to prepare peas, so I'll hang on to this recipe.

I cannot believe how good these are! Don't be fooled by the simple ingredients. This is one of those recipes where the whole is much greater than the sum of its parts. These peas will be making frequent appearances in my kitchen.

Goegeous, simple way to enjoy those peas in your freezer. So much more elegant and tasty than your typical boil, drain, douse-with-butter routine.

This was fantastic. So simple and so good. Just added 1 extra tablespoon of chicken stock and kept the rest the same as the recipe.   Thanks.

These peas are very tasty.  My family loved them even my 13 month old.  They were a quick and easy to make frozen peas really something special.  They will be added to my weekly rotation. Very Yummy!

I loved these, and found them even better the next day as leftovers.  I sometimes use the bags of microwave steamable peas and then add in other ingredients.  My family however did not like the recipe which is why I only gave 4 stars.

Great variation for peas.  Super easy and quick to make and much better than plain peas.  I also always have all of the ingredients at home so that's another plus! Will be making this again for sure.

I'm not sure what about this recipe makes these peas "Italian."  Peas are my favorite veggie, so I'm always looking for new ways to cook them.  This was just peas with onions and a little garlic -- nothing about them tasted Italian to me.  Still, they were pretty good.  Nothing mindblowing here, but tasty.

I had high hopes for this.  We love peas, and who doesn't love garlic and onion?  It tasted fine, but honestly wasn't any better than the super simple way I've made all kinds of frozen vegetables including peas, broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, and brussel sprouts.  Just cover with water, add salt and a few good shakes of garlic powder, cook to desired tenderness, drain and add butter, salt, and pepper to taste.  Simple, and it tastes just as good as this recipe.  I may try it again but sautee the onion and garlic in butter rather than olive oil--I know, it's not as healthy, but it may taste better!

I used red onion in place of white.  It was super easy and very flavorful.  You will be fine using frozen peas, which also makes it low cost.  This takes less time than stated, maybe 10-15 minutes.  Now a part of my rotation.

This was good. I used half a chicken ramon seasoning instead of stock. Next time Im gonna add some mushrooms. I think they would go perfect. Also The longer it sits the better it tastes.

I used 1/2 of an onion, very finely chopped and it was plenty.  Good recipe.  Definately use frozen peas, not canned.

This recipe for revving up your peas is wonderful! Although I like peas, I have tried many different ways to jazz them up. This one suits my taste! I love garlic, and I love onion, and that is a must with this recipe. Thank you for the recipe! I could eat the whole thing by myself!!!

This is an awesome recipe. When I went to cook dinner, the only vegetables I had were peas and my husband hates peas. I found this recipe and he really liked them! I didn't have chicken stock, so I used beef broth. I also cooked it in an iron skillet, which I think also added to the taste. Definitely going in my "keeper" binder!

I don't even like onion but I have to say these were really good. I just picked the peas out. My DH liked these a lot. The only change I made was to use only a quarter of a vidalia onion, minced, it looked like plenty so I can't imagine using a whole onions' worth. I will keep this recipe, WorshipwarriorMT, tell your mom thanks, these peas are awesome. I can see these on our holiday table they are that good!

Delicious! I ran out of chicken stock so substituted beef stock and added a smidgen of flour just for some texture, and it was fantasic.  Will add fresh sliced mushrooms next time. Great recipe. Thanks!

Never would have thought to cook peas in olive oil, however little, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was nice and easy and had a nice moist flavor to them.  Will be cooking my peas this way again!

I hate peas. I LOVE these! So much, in fact, that I had to make them a second time for everyone else, because my "tasting" turned into my meal for the night.

Only change: I thawed the peas the night before in the interest of time. Nothing else needs to be changed. They are addictive!

WOW. These peas are crazy good! I used a little less onion, a little more broth, and a smoked sea salt and black pepper blend. Delicious!

This recipe seems impossibly easy with so few ingredients that I thought for sure it wouldn't be good. Oh its good. I made 2 batches and ate them all myself. Not at once, but these are that good. Ive tried both olive oil and butter for the fat and it actually makes little to no difference both ways are great. Must try! Will def be in my go to's.

We make this as well. We use more onion and sauté the peas until they crinkle and a few have some browning. People who are correcting her cooking time: this dish calls for a softer pea bite.

This is a very good vegetable.  I happen to love peas and the onions were just a additional positive.  My husband suggested less onions but I loved it.   You can always use less onions is if you prefer.  I will definitely make it again.

These were ok.  Made as directed but wasn't very thrilled with the flavor even though we love onions and garlic.  Probably would not make again.

Delicious, sweet flavor. A great light compliment to any dish - not just Italian. I paired with broiled tilapia in an herb Lemmon butter sauce with butternut squash risotto. My husband said he "never realized he liked peas so much" after having this dish.

Like some others also stated, I HATE peas, can't even stand the smell.  My husband loves them.  We've been married 12 years and I haven't made them once.  So I set out to find a way I can make them that I might enjoy at least a little, too.  I admit I was a little skeptical, "such a simple recipe couldn't yield dramatic results"-- but I was wrong.  I not only found these edible, but I dare say I liked them!  Not loved - you can still taste the pea flavor (of course!), but definitely something I could eat again.  My husband, on the other hand, loved them.  So I gave five stars - if you like peas, you'll love these, and if not, they can still be a game-changer.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner to satisfy my daughter's request for peas "like Aunt Liz used to make." Well, I have no idea how Aunt Liz made them but this was a huge hit. I was really surprised at how flavorful this dish is (I wasn't expecting great things). It was so easy and a big payoff for so little effort. I'll be making this regularly.

I was looking for a way to dress up plain old peas, and this was just what I needed. So good! Only cooked the peas for 5 minutes instead of 10, just my preference for tender-but-not-wrinkly peas.

Oh how wonderful this recipe tastes!  Honestly, I have never had better tasting peas. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought at first a whole "medium" onion would be too much but it was just right. The peas are not at all mushy. Frozen peas are the way to go unless you shell fresh ones. Medium low heat using a gas oven is how I made them and 15 minutes was all it took once the peas were added.

This is an excellent twist on plain, old peas.  My family loves them!  I use Better Than Boullion as the stock and less than a whole onion (but then I always have large onions on hand).  Delicious!

these turned out well.  Was unsure of how 'done' the peas were suppose to be so I cooked until warm and starting to soften but not squishy.  was a very cheap side!

Very tasty and very easy.  I did not use olive oil but used a bit of bacon fat instead as it fit in with the rest of the meal.  I like this recipe because it seems so versatile and adaptable.  Thank you for sharing.

Wonderfully easy pea side dish that brings a lot of flavor.  I added a few sliced mushrooms that I sauteed with the onion and garlic, and it made a nice addition.  The best thing is you can throw this together last minute with very minimal work.

This is the first time i prepared peas that were not in a can. They were awesome. I used 1/2 of a red onion I had broth on hand so substitution was made.

This makes canned or frozen peas so much better! I don't use chicken stock just plain old water.

These peas tasted just like any other pea dish. I thought with the garlic and onions and chicken stock it would put a new spin on this bland dish, but I felt like it was a lot of extra work that didn't result in any better of a dish.

These were so good.  I have to say the kids DID eat them. We did not tell them there were onions in the recipe so they did not mention anything.  We ate them all!

This is a parent's dream recipe. Easy (I used canned peas) and my daughter had 3 helpings! She loved the peas! Normally, I am lucky is she eats 3 individual peas...she had 3 helpings of this! Thank you for the recipe!

I was a little disappointed in the outcome of the cooking method. The flavor was ok. I might try these again with a tried and true cooking method.

I love dressing up cooked veggies and this is definitely a keeper!  I got nervous that the onion and garlic would overtake the dish too much so I cut back on the onion.  I also used about 1/3 cup of chicken stock cause I wanted the flavor of it and didn't think 1 T. would do the job. edited: like someone elses tip to thaw the peas in cold water first.

This was good but some of my picky family still did not like it. My husband, who doesn't like eating peas, added some bacon bits to his and then was able to eat them.

My husband said, wow you made peas taste good. I did put a little parm. cheese on them right before bringing them to the table, and I feel that added something to the dish.  But I love cheese on everything.  My husband ate them as is, I put them on pasta as my main dish.  Excellent both ways. Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to add something.  My husband's Grandmother made canned peas by sauteing onion in a little olive oil until soft, draining most of the water from the can of peas and heating them up together.  So simple, but makes them taste very different.

This recipe i thought was going to be just wonderful based on the reviews but i was let down to some extent. after it was done i still felt that it would benefit from just a few more ingredients. itself served as a great base but adding a small amount of lemon zest, a dash of dill weed, 2 of thyme & adding butter to the olive oil (50/50 for frying) i think made this dish much better. still a good dish....so a well deserved 4 stars. thanx.

I will now add peas to our diet again.  I think the last time we had them was when the kids were at home!!!!   This makes the humble pea into something special and might even serve them to company.  Thanks a lot

This was really great. I am not a fan of frozen peas, but after reading the reviews...I figured this was a safe bet.  Turned out great! The only thing I changed was I used a Tbsp. of beef broth (since I already had an open container).

These were good and easy to make, but they weren't anything special. Great for when you need a quick side, though.

Excellent. The chicken stock is good for moisture to simmer the peas in, but I used water and a heaping tablespooon of  chicken boullion. This adds more flavour.  Also, I don't think peas need 10 minutes of simmering time.  A few minutes at most will be plenty. THX

Very good.  I cooked this at Christmas, and it was easy to make ahead.  I sauteed the garlic and onions beforehand and poured over the frozen peas and stuck them in the fridge.  Then, when ready to eat, microwaved the frozen peas and served.  Even those who don't usually like peas liked them.

This is delicious and barely takes longer than boiling a bag of frozen peas.  We sauteed the onion and garlic, then after a couple of minutes added sliced mushrooms.  This dish is very aromatic and tastes wonderful!

Did not care for this recipe. Frozen peas with pearl onions would be easier and taste the same in my opinion.

This was tasty and helped the peas from being the same old thing. I do think next time I might stir in a bit of roasted red pepper sauce to really give it a zip. I used red onions in this.

Hmm.  After all is said and done, I just kinda thought they tasted like . . .well, peas. They aren't bad, they just weren't that spectacular for the two of us.  Perhaps using more onions is what makes people love these?  I only used a few--we aren't big onion fans, so if I had used what was called for  I know we wouldn't have liked it.  So, thanks for the recipe.  Maybe I'll try it again and doctor it up a bit.

Well, I started the recipe before I checked my freezer, and I only had a bag of mixed peas and corn.  I otherwise followed the recipe to the letter, and it came out fantastic.  Definitely a keeper.

Great side dish. I made the basic changes too : i only had canned peas so i used those, cut back on onion and garlic, swapped chicken broth for a chicken bouillon and water, and completely forgot the s&p but turns out it didn't need it. the only other way i knew of to prepare peas was to make a cheesy sauce and this was not only healthier but also tastier!

Delicious peas, and easy too!  Instead of using chicken broth, I added Bragg's Liquid Aminos and some garlic salt.  I also added Herbs de Provence.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was hoping to be more impressed with this recipe.  To me, all the neat added ingredients just didn't do a whole lot for the frozen peas.  I was interested in a way to "jazz up" frozen peas, and unfortunately, this still just tasted like frozen peas with onions.

We made changes. We double the recipe except we added 21oz peas instead of 16oz.  We did not have any stock so we used beer. It was a hit!!!!  Made it yesterday for the New Years!!!! In addition, someone told us to use metal pan instead of my expensive Cuisinart pan. Will try next time! Thank you for sharing the recipe
Happy New Year!!! 2020

Went exactly to the recipe and it was just okay. The onion was, in my opinion, far too over-powering! The rest was nothing spectacular. The olive oil and garlic were nice touch but with the onion it was hardly noticeable. I may try again with less onion.

This was pretty good and easy to make. I have a lot of peas to use up and we enjoyed this recipe as a nice change from the usual boring peas. I liked the addition of garlic and onion in the peas. The amount of broth used is perfect, but if you're out of it or don't want to open a new box/can, just use water. I'll probably keep making this as my go to for quick and easy peas. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved this and he is not a huge pea fan, plus it is a cinch to make.  We are thinking it would be good to cook cauliflower or Brussels Sprouts this way as well.

I first saw this recipe in “All Recipes” magazine with the ingredients catching my eye. Well, since I had no frozen packages of peas and I did have a frozen package of peas within mixed vegetables & decided to use as a substitute. I followed the recipe but cooked for 10 minutes instead of 5. This was both easy & flavorful. A week later after purchasing peas, I did try the original recipe—this too, was just as wonderful.

The broth and olive have nothing to make them adhere to the peas. 
This could be made much better with a small amount of broth.

I'm usually not a big fan of peas but these had great flavor and frozen is much better than the mushy canned peas.

My husband and I liked this quite a lot for peas. I was trying to rate it 4 1/2, but it doesn't allow halves. I modified the recipe as I didn't have everything exactly as needed. I eyeballed an amount of reconstituted onion. What we joking call regurgitated onions. ha ha! And I used a seasoned chicken bouillon cube in a 1/4 cup of hot water. I added all the liquid, much more than the 1 tablespoon. I think the extra liquid stopped the peas from shriveling. Anyway, we both liked them very much. I printed and added this recipe to my recipe book. Nice to have a more flavorful pea with dinner.  Yum!

This is a good recipe for cooking peas in a different way. I did change it a bit by using frozen pearl onions and defrosted them in a small bowl of cool water, just like the peas and I used Pacific's organic low sodium chicken stock. With a bit of white pepper, this came out very good the first time; it was even better the second time when I decided to roast the pearl onions first, then sauteed freshly sliced garlic in the pan and continued the recipe as I did before, adding the roasted onions at the last minute of cooking. That came out even better!

I have been making these peas for many years. I defrost in the microwave for 3 min. Saute"onion and garlic and add some sliced mushrooms.  Sometimes I use a bit of butter with a table spoon of olive oil. I also at times slice olives and add to the pan with the thawed peas. You can add chopped  red pepper to make a festive garnish for holidays. I have added all of this to cooked rice to make a yummy side dish. The cheese added on top is a must for a lovely Italian taste. I use Romano.

These were so easy and good...we usually don't eat peas that much  but served them with crockpot chicken with cream of mushroom soup over red garlic mashed potatoes from this site.  Hubby and kids ate a ton!

I'm always looking for different ways to serve vegetables.  It's amazing what a difference just a few additional ingredients make to a bag of frozen peas.  

We have made this multiple times and it is definitely a keeper

I have never made peas before so I used this recipe as a guide though I changed it up a bit.  1. I used peas picked from my garden, not frozen. I had the pea portion on the skillet for about 5 mins. I didn't have any broth so I added some extra olive oil to make up for it, and added Tony's.   I love this recipe and look forward to trying it again with the broth! :D

Great, tasty peas! I soaked the peas in cold water to thaw and added them in at the end just to warm so they stayed fresh and not at all mushy. Got lots of rave reviews!

These are really yummy! They could do with a little more flavor, so maybe I'll add some sea salt or lemon next time. Also, thank you to the person who recommended thawing the frozen peas in cold water first- definitely made a difference. Will definitely make again!

Great as is, I had fresh peas so used those and added a little extra chicken stock to make up for the lack of extra moisture. Also added some cherry tomatoes at the same time as the peas because I had some sitting around and that was a nice addition.

This recipe has made me enjoy peas again! There's usually a bit more liquid than I find necessary, but that's okay. I also like to chop up some sun-dried tomatoes and throw those in as well, to give it a bit more flavor.

Had some sauce left over from chicken tagine - used instead of stock - delicious - the highlight of the plate. Will definitely use again. Thank you.

This is a good basic, but flavorful rendition for a side dish when you want to put something together quickly to go with your main course.  Folks who like peas should find no fault with this one.  I've made this twice and it was received well by the pea fans in my household.  Plus, except for the frozen peas, I always have all of the other ingredients in the house--convenient.

Loved these peas! Only thing I would change next time is maybe to add some spices-just to make em pop.

I give it 5 stars because I love veggies. The onion and broth gave it a kick. I used a bit more broth than recipe called for. It was just enough broth to cover the bottom of the pan. This prevented my peas from getting dry and losing flavor.

I made this with veggie stock due to the number of vegetarians at dinner and added a pinch of nutritional yeast. My sister and niece loved it. I used organic frozen peas and just zapped them in the microwave for a minute and then stirred in the onion mix. Everyone had thought they were fresh from the farmer's market.

Made today.  Cut recipe in half as I only had 16-oz of peas.  I added fresh mushrooms with the onion and garlic since I like mushrooms.  I added the peas but only cooked for about five minutes as the peas were already thawed.  I didn't have chicken broth so used vegetable broth.  The taste was OK but I wasn't wowed.  After the first bite, I added some Parmesan across the top but it didn't really boost the flavor.  I probably won't make this again.

Tasty. Like others, thaw the peas first. Also, the chicken bullion isn't necessary. You can add plenty of fresh basil toward the end.

Another simpler way is to melt butter or EVOO in a skillet, add minced garlic and the peas, some fresh or dry parsley or basil, salt, white pepper, put lid on and steam/saute until  tender over medium/low heat - no need for broth or water.

I made this recipe as posted, except used fresh peas, and found it to be ok but not great.  Next time I'll add fresh dill to increase the flavor.

It's OK, but it could be made less boring  and more colorful by adding some chopped carrots and a little red pepper when frying the onions.  A little tomato paste or chopped tomatoes and fresh chopped dill at the end would make it super tasty.

This is so easy & tastes great - simple ingredients that provide robust flavor. I'm a huge fan of garlic & sautéed onions, so this was a no-brained when it came to deciding whether to make this one or not. I added Parmesan cheese at the end before serving & it enhanced the flavor seven more so.

When you have time to put some effort into frozen peas, this is a nice touch. I defrosted the peas in the microwave with the broth.

These were very tasty. A nice change from the canned peas That I normally make. I microwaved the peas first as to soften them a bit. They still turned out a little firm for our tastes. Next time would just microwave them longer. Easy and tasty. Will likely make is one again.

I had a big dish for lunch, and they were great! I liked a reviewer's suggestion of putting the peas in a bowl of water for 20 minutes to thaw, which I did. This way, when you add them to the pan, you only cook enough to heat, about 5-6 minutes for me. No mush or shriveled up peas. I also topped with a little parm-romano cheese, a very nice touch. Thanks for the recipe!

This were simple yet had that extra little something. I cut my onions up in a chopper just so there wouldn't be huge chucks of onion but the onion and garlic really gave an extra level to the peas. Will be making these again soon.

Delish! What a great way to dress up plain (i.e. bleh) peas!!! :) Both my hubs and I really enjoyed this simple side dish. It paired nicely with our stuffed sole and pierogies (which I sauteed in butter, minced onion and garlic - yum-o!). My only criticism is with the cooking timeframe. It does not take 5 minutes to saute your onion / garlic (it took me more like 2-3 minutes MAX) and it certainly does not take 10 minutes to cook your peas (yikes!). As many others have advised, in order to maintain their vibrant green color, simply heat your (defrosted OR completely thawed) peas for just a couple of minutes and then proceed as directed. If you need a quick veggie dish to serve with your next meal, look no further. This will NOT disappoint! Thanks for sharing your mom's great recipe, WORSHIPWARRIOR. :-)

Great option for frozen peas, which are usually very bland.  I used lots of chicken broth - about 1 1/2 cups - and just removed with a slotted spoon.

This recipe was so easy, yet so delicious! I used canned peas (drained) instead of the frozen peas the recipe called for; and it turned out great! My family LOVED them.

Delicious!!!!

I used more garlic than called for.  As per reviews, I nuked the peas and just stirred together for a minute over flame.  I used a lot of coarse pepper cause my kids like spicy.  I used chicken soup powder with boiling water.  Yum!

My family absolutely loved this! The peas tasted delicious. After trying the peas like this and enjoying every bite, I decided to add in a bit of bok choy and green beans. It was wonderful  served over rice. Thank you so much for the veggie inspiration!!

Very good, but that was an awful lot of onion and garlic; next time I make it, I'm going to halve the amounts and use a small onion and only one clove garlic.  I also added an extra tbsp of chicken broth since the first one seemed to steam off as soon as it hit the pan.

I'm not a big fan of cooked peas but these I really liked.  I eyed all the ingredients and did not use can broth.  I used instant bouillon powder and water.  I will for sure make these again as my whole family loved em.

Easy to whip together as a side dish. Loved the combo of peas and onions, but not the addition of garlic - I'll leave that out next time. Other than that, the peas were cooked perfectly!

Made according to directions. Good, dressed up peas. No fabulous flavor...just peas, onions and garlic. Maybe add some more chicken stock or butter next time? Great for company (better than plain buttered peas).

I tried this recipe with fresh peas from the farmers market, but added more broth to allow them to cook through in the liquid, and added a little butter towards the end because I love butter. Wow!  Excellent recipe, wonderful sidedish.  Thank you!

These were so simple and very good! I only had red onion, so I used that (it was fairly large, so I just used 1/2). Also, I added an extra clove of garlic. My family really enjoyed these and I will definately be making them again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This dish is amazing. Even my kids will eat peas when I make them this way!   I rarely have chicken stock on hand, so I just shake a few chicken stock granules in and add a tablespoon or two of water.

In my opinon, these were not worth the extra effort as the garlic and onions did not give much flavor or excitement to the peas. Also - the cooking time is too high. I cooked for only 5 minutes and the peas were already mushy.

I have never been a big fan of English peas, but this recipe has put them on my list of favorite sides!  Only substitution I made was to use shallots in place of the onions.  Really good! Thanks so much for sharing.

Simple, but delicious! I actually like peas as they are so this was perfect for me as the other flavors did not overwhelm the dish.  Only change was to use vegetable stock instead of chicken because that's what I had open.  Nice way to dress up peas! Thanks!

VERY easy and quick to toss together. Peas are a dish we usually overlook, so this was a nice change. Found out into the recipe I didn't have the onion I thought I had, so I used dried chopped and some onion powder, minced garlic juice, chicken broth and a sprinkle of garlic salt (so in retrospect, did I even make the same recipe? : ) Same basic idea, just tweaked to what was onhand and we enjoyed it.

I agreed with everyone else. I followed the recipe and was underwhelmed. This did taste just like normal peas with a little onion. I think more garlic would maybe make this better or maybe some dill?

They were good.  I thought the chicken stock would add more flavor than it did.  I think "Peas with Mushrooms" on this site is a better way to make peas.

Nice, but not spectacular.  They took much longer to cook than the recipe said, but that may be because I used a too-small pot.

Good recipe, but I thought it needed a little something. I added dried basil and oregano. It was good, but I think next time I will use fresh. Just onion and garlic doesn't make it "Italian" enough for me. I will also try butter instead of the olive oil next time. But I'm glad I tried this recipe. Thanks for posting.

While trying to find a veggie both my boyfriend and I liked I came across this recipe.  It was an instant "Let's try it!"  We had to substitute lemon juice for chicken broth since we were completely out and didn't even have bullion to work with.  We really loved the citrus flavor that the lemon gave it.  Also instead of cutting up an onion and adding that to frozen peas we used a bag of frozen peas with pearl onions.  (The grocery store was running a sale on frozen veggies and we were feeling lazy.)  He wants me to make peas this way more often, he says they have so much more flavor than regular plain peas.  I have to agree with him.  This will be on the menu again.

I love peas! This was a delicious side. Super easy to put together and little time to make. No chicken stock, but I added frozen green beans. I imagine a few chopped carrots would work nice as well.

Great side dish.  I made it with long grain rice and Dijon and Honey grilled  chicken breasts.  Directions were easily memorized, took very little time or effort.  I added cracked black pepper and a pat of butter.  My daughter hates veggies with a passion and she was scooping them up.

I have cooked my peas like this for the past 40+ years. I now have grandchildren who now just love these. They are also good if you substitute butter for the olive oil.

I used extra garlic (pre-minced to save time), garlic powder, added Italian seasonings, and some bacon pieces since I thought they sounded good.  I used half of a yellow onion; half seemed like enough and the yellow onion was what I had on hand.  I’m not a huge fan of peas, but I can definitely eat them this way.

These didn't make us stop and say WOW! but they were definately very good & I will make them again and again.  Much better than plain, boring peas.

Good stuff. I typically cook my peas like this so it was good to see it on allrecipes as a consumer favorite. My family has cooked it this way for years, but we never knew it was called "Italian Peas". This recipe is a great way to make peas that the whole family will enjoy. Note: I buy can peas and use instead of frozen peas and on occassion I add either parmesan cheese or feta cheese to the pot during the last 5 minutes of cooking. This adds a nice flavor.

My son and I both love peas, so I made this recipe for dinner last night.  These were so good that I decided I am going to make them as my 2nd vegetable for Thanksgiving this year instead of the usual boring corn.  It is amazing that such simple ingredients could make such a delicious difference!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and a different twist for peas. . . even on a weeknight. I used boullion instead of stock, just so I didn't have to waste a can of chicken broth for the small amount this recipe calls for.

This was a hit! Never had a 6 year old ask for seconds on veggies before, but this did the trick...I too used a dash of parmesan on top before serving.

I've used both regular onion and minced onion and came out great.  I don't like to open up a container of chicken stock or a whole bouillon, so I've used Tammy's Herbal Rub (by John Henry) mixed with heated water as a stock.

Dee-licious. Made as is and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese on top. I've noticed a theme in many Italian dishes to use the chicken broth-garlic-onion combo, and am very fond of it. Would recommend these flavors for asparagus as well. This was a perfect side to the Spaghetti Carbonara II recipe found on this website.

Delicious!  It's the only way I can get my husband to eat frozen peas.  (He only likes canned peas but I can't stand their mushy texture.)  I dated an Italian years ago and his grandmother made peas just like this.  I tried to duplicate the recipe for years but never succeeded until now!  Thanks!

As far as peas goes..this is really good!!! It is very garlicy, so if you don't care for as much garlic just adjust it. I also only had canned peas on hand. I would suggest to puy them at the very last minute as to simply warm them in the mixture. I may have over stirred them but my kids didn't care and the taste was very good. Thanks!!!!

This was very good.  I used a little less olive oil than it calls for.  My son who doesnt like peas at all said this was "o.k."  I'll make it again when we're looking for someting a little different than plain old steamed veggies.

Very good.  I normally find peas a bit too sweet but the onions counterbalanced that wonderfully.  Used vegetable broth and canned peas, which didn't seem to harm anything. Thanks!

Delicious. And way more than just „onions and peas“ even though I didn’t have frozen peas but used canned ones. Instead of warming them up in the pan I mixed them with the sautéed onion and garlic, broth (had to use 1/2 cube chicken bullion dissolved in water) and the seasonings, then put them in a casserole pan, sprinkled with 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese and baked for 15 min at 350° F.
However - to call this "Italian Peas" some Italian Seasoning was (as from another reviewer suggested) inevitable.

I was looking for a quick side to my baked fish dinner and I found it. I love peas but I can't get anyone else in our home to eat them. A little onion and garlic definitely helped! Thank you!

These were delicious.  I made them on a whim, and so I only had garlic powder and onion powder to use with my frozen peas, but they still turned out wonderfully.  I probably would have given my own version 4 1/2 stars, but I can imagine that with the fresh ingredients it would make five stars.  I will be making these frequently now.

My husband and I both love this recipes.  I make this dish quite often now and the only ingredient I add is a small sprinkle of red pepper flakes just before serving.  We like our food on the hot and spicy side so this adds that extra "zing" that we enjoy.

This was good and fresh-tasting.  I cut the recipe in half and used a very small red onion; it looked great with the bright green peas.  I used a splash more chicken stock.  Served with Lemon Thyme Rice and Lemon-Garlic Tilapia.

I used frozen, thawed pearl onions & let them caramelize a bit before adding the garlic. I am out of chicken broth so I mixed a little bit of chicken base w/ water (I made several tbp though) & it turned out much richer than it owuld have been if I had used broth (will repeat next time). I also added fresh sliced mushrooms (I added them after the onions but before the garlic). We loved these....thanks WORSHIPWARRIORMT!

Everybody loved these peas!  I'm not a huge pan of peas myself, and I think this is about the only way I'd eat them.

This was great.. only changes we made were I used a shallot and one extra clove of garlic.. and sprinkled italian seasoning (2 shakes)
came out wonderful.. I will so it again.. though next time I might add some chopped proscitto.. to give it a more italian feel to it.
Thanks for the great recipe!
served with crockpot gravy roast & mashies

I didn’t really notice a difference in the peas. I followed the recipe exactly and it just tasted like peas mixed with onions. I probably won’t make it again.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer who said that this tastes like peas and onions.  That's it.  No less no more.  That said, my 20 month old gobbled hers right up, so I'll probably make them again.
