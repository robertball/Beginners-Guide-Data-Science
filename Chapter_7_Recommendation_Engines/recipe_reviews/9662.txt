This recipe is a pain.  I agree with the other poster that the directions are unclear.  Why tell someone to preheat the oven and then go on to direct the cook to use a double boiler for 20 minutes?  my oven was on all afternoon.  

I also could not use the pastry bag or a cookie press.  The recipe was runny and only the liquid squeezed out.  It never thickened as the recipe stated.  

This seems like a very laborious way to make macaroons compared to all the other recipes out there.

Great recipe and very delicious!  I make this one at Christmas, sprinkle the tops with red and green sugar before going into the oven, then dip the bottoms in melted chocolate after the macaroons have baked and cooled.

I thought the directions were not very precise. Also, the step with mixing the almond extract with the egg whites needs to be defined better. Was I supposed to beat it in and make it like a merengue? Then I was unable to use the pastry bag either for some reason; had to drop it by spoonfuls. They tasted good but I was hoping for great.

I've made these twice. They're very light and airy, but remind me more of a meringue cookie. Very tasty.

Great recipe! Very easy! Used maraschino cherries instead of candied cherries & it worked as a nice substitution.
