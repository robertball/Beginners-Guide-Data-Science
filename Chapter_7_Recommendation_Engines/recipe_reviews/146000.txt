I cut waaaay back on the cilantro and that proved to be a good call for Hubs and me. Just before I served this I gave it a taste and thought to myself, "Uh-oh.  We aren't EVEN going to like this. TOO limey!"  But I went ahead and served it anyway, hoping for the best - and hoping I had enough other food in case we couldn't eat this.  But to my surprise, not only did *I* like it, but Hubs did too!  It's obvious this rice is much better served *with* something, in this case carnitas. They were perfect together!  The amount of lime juice and zest ended up being just right, but I know the full amount of cilantro would have dominated to a fault - glad I cut it back to a fraction of what the recipe called for.

I used Jasmine rice with the proportions of 2 cups of rice to 3 cups of water.  I increase the lime to juice of 2 fresh limes. Fabulous!

A very light and delicious side dish for mexican foods.  I loved the lime flavor.  I used Uncle Ben's ready rice that only takes 90 seconds in the microwave, so there was no need for water and then just mixed everything in -plus an additional bit of salt.

I tweaked this recipe to get a little closer to Qudoba's. 
I boil the rice in 1c of water, 1c of chicken stock and 1tsp of salt. Boil for about 17mins, then remove from heat, remove lid also...put a dish towel on top and return lid...allow it to sit for about 10mins...this makes sure the rice is fluffy because the towel absorbs the excess steam...after it sits, then stir in your cilantro and fresh lime juice to taste...for my family its usually 1 to 1.5 limes....this has saved me from buying cilantro rice from Qudoba every other day for my 2yr old! Thanks!

My husband won't stop raving about this rice! I did make a few changes. I started with melting the butter, then sautéed 1/2 of an onion and 2 cloves garlic for about 5 minutes, added in the rice and cooked for 3-5 minutes, then added in chicken broth (instead of the water called for), and seasoned with salt and pepper to taste. Then cooked it according to the rice's package directions. And last I added in lime zest, lime juice, and cilantro just before serving. I did increase the lime juice to 3 tbsp, because we like limes in our household. Overall an amazing and delicious rice recipe that makes a wonderful side and is so flavorful!

We all loved this rice.  I cooked it in a rice cooker and then mixed everything in a bowl.  The rice came out fluffy and tasty.

I make this same rice, but instead of long grain rice, I use instant rice - as directed on package.  When water and lime juice (1 tablespoon per cup of water) are heating, I add about 1/2 cup diced onion, a tablespoon of butter and a bit of salt.  Once it boils, you add the instant rice, cover and remove from heat.  It's simple and fast, some may not like instant rice, but to me, it tastes the same.

Very good flavor, very, very easy indeed!  Just like the rice at Chipotle's!  We used it the first night as an accompaniment to some Lemon-Cilantro Chicken, and fluffed and heated it up the next night for fajitas!

Eep! I've been making this for months and forgot to review it until now. Anyway, this rice is so good. Very light and yet still lots of flavor. Excellent flavor profile for all kinds of dishes, from Mexican to Island to Asian. It's just really bright and as simple as plain rice. Try it! My little twist is to give the rice a VERY quick sauté in 1/2 Tbsp. evoo before cooking. It makes it extra light and fluffy.

I did not make this recipe yet, but I have noticed people are mentioning how sticky the rice was after they cooked it.  I've always been told to RINSE the rice before cooking because it will rid it of the starch that will make the rice clump up and have a gooey texture.  Just wanted to let you all know.

VERY good rice & extremely easy to make.  I love the rice at Qdoba & I was pleasantly suprised to find that this was *almost" just like it.  There was a bit too much lime taste in it that sort of overpowered everything else at times (next time I will cut it down to 1 tsp), but all in all a very basic & easy recipe to follow that recieved rave reviews at my deck party.  Thank you for sharing!!  :)

Very simple, very good. Thank you. I cooked the rice in my own homemade chicken stock instead of plain water. I served it with Asian Ginger Grill Marinaded porkchops, which are also from this site.

Too lime-y for me but that is an easy fix!  I will cut lime by half.  Glad to find this and it was great with my Black Bean/Pork Tenderloin Chili.  I put a couple scoops of rice in a bowl then ladled some chili on top.  Ty for the recipe!

Good recipie, not too flavorful.  Everyone liked the rice inside the fajitas, but didn't have enough flavor to be a stand alone side dish.

Awesome and light! I toasted my rice in a little olive oil, used chicken stock instead of water and cut the butter in half.

I made this to go with California Chicken and wasn't disappointed. Very fresh tasting and healthy. I did use brown rice because that's all I ever have on hand. I zested twise as much lime by accident so I just threw it in anyway. It was still quite good but probably will be better with the amount as written.

I'm giving this 5-stars as it is very good! My only complaint, and I'm pretty sure it isn't the recipe, but me, is my rice "clumped" together.  The flavors of the lime and cilantro were wonderful. My husband put this right into his tortilla but I ate mine as a side.  Fantastic either way.

I've been wanting to fix this rice for quite a while.  Being a big fan of lime and cilantro and not a huge fan of rice I was curious to see how the flavors blended together.  The blended very well.  I can't wait to make this again - although the next time I will add a little more lime and increase the cliantro also.  This is just a personal peference as the recipe is great as written.  Thanks ENSeeber for posting this recipe.

Used instant rice and cooked it in chicken broth instead of water.  That's the only change.  Made it for a party.  I THOUGHT that what the recipe called for was too much...of the cilantro and such.  Wrong.  Follow the recipe.  Everyone loved it.

Great Recipe! I did make several adjustments.  I made the rice in the rice cooker with a chicken broth cube, and added some Kaffir Lime Leaves (into the rice cooker) to give it a subtle lime flavor instead of the zest.  Afterwards, I added only bit of lime juice for freshness. Had it with some Thai seafood soup I made; the rice complimented it well.

Very easy and fresh tasting. A nice departure from  pilaf or steamed rice.  I paired it with the Margarita Gilled Shrimp found on this site.  They were perfect together!

I made the recipe as written. I was so disappointed as lime, cilantro and rice are staples in my house. This was just so bland...not at all what I expected. It would make a good filler for a burrito but not as a side.

My hubby loooooved this rice. He said it's so much better than Chipotle rice. Well, I admit. I did change a bit but I think this recipe does give a very good basic?? idea.
Well, my hubby doesn't like cilantro too much so I probably used about 2-3 TB spoon of it. For lime, I didn't put any zest it in cause I wasn't sure if I would like it. Oh, and I did use chicken broth just like other reviews suggested.
My hubby loved it but I thought it was okay(still more than 3 stars though). I didn't like the butter smell too much. I'm a little too sensitive to smell so next time, I may try different type of oil.
It was good in taco for sure. It didn't have whole a lot of flavor on its own but as a filling, it was definitely good. My hubby couldn't stop saying how much he liked this rice. Oh, and it's so easy to make.
So it's definitely a keeper.

This recipe is bright and delicious. I added more lime juice because I had no zest (only a squeeze bottle). I also added 1T of butter to finish. I thought the amount of cilantro was great, but I love cilantro.

Very good.  I used a minute rice and followed box directions.  Used fresh cilantro and a lime.  I used 1 lime to 6 servings of rice.  Not overpowering and very good under Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Meat.  Topped with black beans and fresh corn.  Family loved it.  May have been a bit spicy for the little ones though.

This is a refreshingly different recipe. My family loved it! When bringing the water to a boil, I added 1 packet of Goya ham flavored seasoning. That is the only change I made. We served this rice with homemade baja fish and shrimp tacos. It was wonderful!

I would actually give this only 3.5 stars.  Though, I made it with whole wheat orzo instead of rice.  

I liked the flavor combination of the lime zest and cilantro and I would definitely make this again but i was a little more bland than I was hoping.  

Next time I would like to try adding sauteed garlic and jalapenos for an extra kick.

Delicious!  I used the Everyday Food's version, using EVOO instead of butter.  This has HUGE cilantro & lime flavor.  Made as a side for baked tilapia.  Would be excellent tucked into fish tacos, too.

Followed recipe exactly.  Absolutely LOVED it!  Hubby went crazy over it.  We love the flavor of cilantro and it went perfect with the lemon-butter baked shrimp!!  Can't wait to make again.
Thanks for a great recipe.

This was ok. Not a whole lot of flavor. I served it with grilled chicken, but perhaps it would be best served with something that included a sauce, like enchiladas.

This recipe makes a great side dish for spicy Mexican recipes. Like naples34102 commented it was too limey when you tasted it alone but it paired beautifully when served with spicy meat. (I served it with the Slow Cooker Guisado Verde recipe from this site.) Modifying the Guisado Verde with Herdez Salsa Verde kicked the heat up beautifully in pork and this lime cilantro rice was ideal. Thanks I doubled the recipe (made no changes) and saved the leftovers to make burritos the next day.

It went very well with the chicken! 
Rice was a little bland for me, but it was good especially with Coronas! 
 hubby liked it! ;)

This rice was excellent! If you like the rice at Chipotles you will like this. For the 1 Tblsp. of butter I used a butter/canola oil blend. I didn't think I would like the lemon rind and tasted it without it. It definitely needed the flavor of it, and it worked perfect. The rice at Chipotles is a little less sticky and has a slight oily sheen, but I think I actually liked this one better. My rice was completely done in 17 minutes. I did not see salt on the recipe, so I added a small tad to taste when it was done. My only advice, is to make it fresh and what you will eat. It does not taste as good from the fridge as the lime sits. Thank you for the recipe.

Perfect! Tried separately with both white and brown rice, and would not recommend the brown rice version. On the other hand the white rice was a wonderful accessory to the key west chicken I grilled!

We did as others suggested, using chicken broth and eliminating the zest. Otherwise we followed the recipe. Very good and a great home-version of the chain restaurant's rice.

I made the recipe with no variations and the lime just overpowered everything.  Even I, who will try to see the good in any bad situation, could not force myself to eat this dish.  I will attempt to make it again, but this time with a smaller amount of lime and chicken broth instead of water.

I am glad i only made half of this recipe, as it seemed pretty bland and flavorless, despite the amount of lime, zest, and cilantro.  I wasn't overly impressed.  It was really pretty, and I had high hopes, it just wasn't something I'll make again.

This was decent. I LOOOVE Chipotle's rice, but have never been able to perfect it at home. Mine always seems too sour (i.e. too "limey"). Although not completely satisfied (nothing compares to Chipotle's rice...), I must admit I do like ENSeeber's version better than Mrs. Brown's (which I have tried previously). The two aren't really that different, however. The main difference is that there is quite a bit more cilantro in this recipe (and I think that's why I like ENSeeber's rice slighly better than Mrs. Brown's). Naples34102 advises adding less cilantro and attributes doing just that to having "saved" this recipe, but I have to disagree. :( I guess it's a battle of the taste buds lol! My hubby REALLY liked this and said that he'd eat a bowlful for dinner with a chopped, grilled chicken breast mixed in! And while I like this better than the last version I tried, I still can't award more than 3 stars (I just don't like this enough to award more). My only suggestion for improvement is to substitute chicken broth (or bullion / water) for the water called for. It adds sooooo much flavor! Anywhoo, this was a nice accompainment to tacos in pasta shells (grannycancook). The light and refreshing rice complemented the heavier, meaty shells perfectly. Thanks for sharing, ENSeeber! If for nothing other than having a unique side to serve with my taco pasta entree, I'll keep your recipe handy for that. :-)

I used Basamti rice (the only rice I use), cooked it with chicken broth, cut the cilantro and lime zest (by at least half) and added one seeded, diced tomato.  It was delicious and went so well with Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken from this site!

Fantastic recipe!  I did not cut back on anything.  The only change that I made was to add two cubes of chicken bullion.  I felt like this gave it the perfect amount of flavor and made it a dish that would stand all on its own!

I've made his rice a few times already, and for some reason I think it's lacking.  I'm not sure what it is, but I envision it tasting similarly to the rice that Chipotle uses, and it just doesn't.

This is okay, but the cilantro & lime are both mostly lost in the rice. I can't say that I need to make this again (and I've tried it 2 times just to make sure)

Admittedly, I can cook about anything, rice isn't one of them.  So, I used uncle bens microwave rice and added the butter, cilantro and lime.  It was pretty Limey, but overall tasted great with our Snapper Veracruz tonight.  I will make it again.

Used long grain wild rice for a nuttier flavor and a toasty crunch.  Served with homemade barbacoa, grilled veggies and taco bowls (corn tortillas shaped on muffin tins).  Awesomely light flavor...perfect for summer.

I loved this, but tweaked just a little. I used Hinode's Jasmine ready rice. Omitted the butter, and used just a drizzle of olive oil. No salt, added a few shakes of cumin, garlic powder, and black pepper. Used about 3 tbsp of bottled lime juice (only thing I had). I used one cube of frozen cilantro. Plenty for me. I served with Baked Cilantro Lime Swai fillets and zuchinni spears. Yum! Thanks for the inspiration.

What a nice change from regular white rice. I made this to go along with Margarita Salmon from this website. The lime juice and zest made such a nice refreshing summertime Zing, you don't need very much zest, but I did use a bit more than a teaspoon. I love Cilantro so anything with that is a winner for me. I will make this again for sure.

This rice dish is a great, light alternative to traditionally heavily flavored mexican rice. It was super easy to make and had plenty of flavor. I made mine using some Jasmati rice I had in the pantry and I cut back a bit on the cilantro (I'm not a huge fan of cilantro to begin with). The rice was perfect!

I have no idea what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly and the rice turned into a big ball of starchy paste.  Maybe I will try it with instant rice next time and see if I can get a better outcome.

I was attempting to duplicate the rice at Chipotle ended up tweeking the recipe quite a bit- used butter, garlic powder, seasoning salt, cut-up the cilantro, lime zest/juice, and chicken broth NOT water, stirred on occassion because the cilantro will float atop of rice, but put in all ingredients in pot boil, simmer as usual- it was FANTASTIC!

I thought this was a little bland.  It was simple and refreshing but it tasted much better once I put some sauce I made on it.  I also had to add some salt and pepper.  Probably won't become a regular at my house.

Really good recipe.  I only changed a few things but only for personal preference.  I always make my white rice with vegetable oil, add salt and a pinch of onion powder, garlic powder and black pepper.  I also skipped the lime zest since I used the bottle version of lime juice.  It was perfect!

Splendid recipe!  Did not change a thing but I was tempted to use olive oil instead of butter which I intent to try next time.  I served it with Peanut Butter Chicken (also on this site) and a cabbage slaw salad - We had a Thai-type dinner!  Warning - No leftovers!

I went with lime zest, lime juice, cilantro, salt, rice. My super-duper picky husband LOVES this side dish. I made it just for me, he tasted it and now I make it twice or more each week for both of us empty nesters. For me it makes vegan more fun.

It turned out just like I wanted, similar to a popular chain restaurant's in my opinion.  I did use my rice cooker instead of stove top. I just followed the directions from the cooker for long grain rice (did add the butter with the rice in the cooker) then added the lime and cilantro with zest at the end. It was delish. Will repeat this one every taco/fajita night!

This was vwery good.  I felt it needed salt, so added a tsp. along with lime zest and juice.  Also, I would taste test the rice before adding juice from the 2nd lime.  One juiced lime may be enough for you.

I found this recipe to be perfect as is as far as the ingredients and measurements. I ended up only using about a 1/4 cup  chopped cilantro since that was all I had left on hand and felt that the rice could have used more. Hopefully next time I will have enough cilantro to do the full 1/2 cup. In reading the other reviews mentioning mushy rice, I did saute the rice in 1 tbsp. oil first (used olive oil) until the rice was becoming translucent/starting to lightly brown. Then I added the water (you could use chicken broth too). The rice came out perfect and fluffy. My total cook time was 25 minutes, but I suspect I had the heat too low. Thanks for the sharing the recipe that reminds me of Chipotle's rice!

I don't think it tasted like Chipotle rice but then I don't eat their rice by itself so I could be wrong.  I made this with Basmati rice and fresh lime juice/zest and cilantro.  I don't really feel like the cilantro taste came through.  It really just tasted like lime rice to me and I even added more cilantro than called for.  We had it for dinner plain with pork tenderloin and asparagus.  Both of us had seconds of the rice and there is very little left even though I made the entire recipe.  Thanks!  I usually have cilantro and limes around so I'm sure I'll be making this again.

This is a good recipe. The lime/cilantro flavor comes through but is not overwhelming. I added salt and pepper to the rice water like I normally would. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.

That is a lot of fresh cilantro. I use dried cilantro because I go through it so much so I use about 1 heaping Tbspn. I also put chicken broth into the water; it adds so much flavor.

Made this last night for dinner to go with a spicy pork tenderloin and Black Bean and Mango Salad. It was perfect, just enough limey flavor and cilantro. I don't eat at that burrito place, so I can't compare, but this is definitely going to be made again at my house. Only change I made was I added salt to the rice with the butter. You can't cook rice without salt!

our whole family loves this rice. We are big cilantro people and find this to be the perfect compliment to a wide variety of dishes. One of our favorite twists on this recipe is to make it as a sticky rice using traditional Thai rice and following sticky rice instructions found on this site.  Thank you!

This is really good. I cook the rice in chicken broth to add flavor. Sometimes, I will also toss in about a tsp of cumin.

OMG I love this! It's become a staple in our house for those times I can't think of a side dish.  I use my rice steamer to cook the rice then just mix in the lime and cilantro. I don't measure anymore, just throw it in and taste until I'm happy. I also use spray butter to give it that buttery richness without the fat. I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

wowzers...this was good.  It does taste so much like chipotle's rice (which we love!!).  The only change we made was to use 2 T lime juice, but no lime zest.  We also thought the cilantro amount was perfect.  We will make this often!!

Very good flavors but it came out too wet. I don't think putting butter works well in my rice cooker. It also needs salt and maybe half the cilantro. But a very good basic recipe to make a quick and delicious side dish.

This was a pretty good dish.  A bit limey, so I would cut back on the lime.  Easy to make, which is a plus for me! I was trying to recreate to rice from Chipotle,  and it was pretty close.

My rice turned out a bit soggy after adding the lime juice and I don't usually add butter to my rice, so next time I will cut back on the water by 2 TBSP. i had over 1/2 c chopped cilantro but threw the extra 1/4 c in anyway and I think it was a good call. I thought it was a bit too limey but my roommates really enjoyed it and my boyfriend who puts hot sauce on everything decided that he didn't even need any to enjoy his rice! Usually serving sizes here end up being too large for me but possibly due to the flavor of this recipe we barely had leftovers between the two of us, so I'll double this next time and share some with the roommates.

I made this for my daughter's 26th birthday party. We served it with Chili and corn bread. It was the best rice I've ever had. What a hit!

Pretty good, but no where near as good as Chipotle's, it's missing something...

My husband and I loved this.  So refreshing and light.  Served this with chicken enchiladas, and then the left overs with spicy italian pork cutlets, also from this site.  This would go with so many main dishes, the combinations are endless. Thanks for the recipe.

My  husband really liked this, and that's saying a lot!  He's not a big fan of rice.  I used minute rice, and added in the other ingredients.  I served it with grilled chicken on top and "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" over that.  It was an awesome meal!    Thanks so much!

Maybe this isn't fair but I used Jasmine rice and cooked it in a rice cooker and added the butter at the same time.  Results were gummy.  BUT the added lime and cilantro was very very good

This had great flavor!  We used it in our Chipotle style burritos and they were awesome!  I did what another suggested, used Jasmine rice, the juice of two limes, and forgot to zest the limes, so omitted that.  It's worth a shot if you love the restaurant's.

I've prepared this several times for the family - we're big fans of Chipotle Mexican Grill and especially like their rice, which is very similar to this.  I like to add the line juice, cilantro and zest only a few minutes before serving...the color is more pleasing.

Way too much cilantro and lime! It was too sour to eat. I bet it would be much better with half the lime and cilantro.

Too easy...a solid quick fix to plain rice. I added butter after rice was cooked along with the other items, and I also included a tablespoon of salt to the water for boiling the rice and a little bit of the chopped cilantro.

Super easy recipe! I added a tablespoon of lime juice to the water mix and then halfway through, I threw in some cilantro. Added the remainder of it when it was finished. Served this with Margarita Chicken and mango avocado salsa and it was just perfect!

This rice was good, but bland.  For the amount cooked, I needed 2t zest and 3T juice.  I also added 1/2 t salt.  The cilantro flavor is excellent and the lime just needed to be beefed up a little.  It is a nice alternative to plain rice.  I served it with Mexican food.

This rice is great, it tastes just like the rice at chipotle! I don't really like cilantro so I substituted that with parsley. I also made this in a rice steamer, it came out perfect! Thanks!

Used in veggie burritos and it added a nice tang. Very easy to make.

I like this recipe. It has a light taste that pairs well with heavier Southwest-flavored foods.

this is very easy to make. it just lacked the yummiest that I was hoping for. It didn't have quite enough flavor, I would probably make it again but add some other ingredients. Good base to go off of.

Really good and  flavorful but mild. I scaled it back by half since only 2 of us were eating and used instant rice! Paired very nice with the rest of my dinner and was super easy to make. Thanks for the simple tasty submission!!

This recipe was pretty good it was not that flavorful though it had just a hint of lime. We doubled the lime to give it a zesty kick and that improved the taste.

The lime was the prominent flavor in this dish (although I am making it using cilantro grown in March, which is not a flavorful as summer cilantro).  I steamed the rice so that the grains were firm and separate and the overall dish was not "gluey" which sometimes happens cooking rice on the stove. After the rice was perfectly cooked, I stirred the lime-cilantro mixture into the rice. After tasting, I sprinkled a bit of sea salt on the rice.
 
Next time I make this, I will reduce the lime and increase the cilantro.

I made this last night- however I used brown rice which adjusted the cooking time. I also, used 1 Tbs. of lime juice per other reviewers suggestions. Served with swiss chard & black beans this was a quick, easy & healthy meal!

This rice is fantastic.  I thought the amount of cilantro and lime was great to start.  Salting the rice (about 1/2 tsp) at the end really brings out the flavor of the cilantro and lime.  I ended up adding more (C&L), but even the most cilantro-sensitive person would think this was okay.  1/2 cup chopped cilantra for me was about 1/2 a bunch.  I ended up using the whole bunch and the juice of two limes, maybe around 1/4 cup.  One other thing I did differently was add 1/2 finely chopped onion in with boiling water and I added a bit of chicken bouillon to the boiling water to help flavor the dish.

Delicious easy rice preparation with refreshing results. I sauted rice in evoo prior to cooking as suggested by another reviewer. Paired with Firecracker Salmon from this site and home grown tomatoes. Wonderful way to end the work week. Will definitely make again

After trying a few forks full, we had to adapt so we could eat it. We added orange marmalade because the lime was over powering. Since this is similar to a rice we use when making Mole, which has cumin, rice, orange marmalade & cilantro, we'll keep using that instead.

Definitely needs some help. I made it as directed, then had to change A LOT to make it palatable. First, add some salt to the rice. Or, better yet, cook it in chicken or veggie broth (just add a bouillon cube to the water, or use straight-up stock). It could also use some garlic and/or onion, or garlic powder. The lime and cilantro ratio was fine, but it lacked flavor overall.

Great change from my usual Mexican rice (tomato and onion based).  I left out the lime juice and salted the rice before I served it.  Family gobbled it up with steak tacos.  This one is a keeper!

good flavor except I think the lime does something to rice and becomes very gooey after adding the lime juice too it.

Tripled this for a 50th birthday fiesta. Served as an accompaniment to Chicken Kabobs Mexicana & Kris' Amazing Mexican Beef both from allrecipes.com.  I did wash the rice a bunch before actually cooking which did help with it not being sticky like rice can be.  Didn't actually measure the cilantro, just chopped until I thought it looked like enough.  I didn't think it tasted like Chipotle's, but was about as close as I think I could get it.   Lots of compliments from the party guests! Will be making again but on a much smaller scale.

My rice was sticky but I think it was because I'm not sure I used long-grain and I didn't rinse it. However, the flavor was fantastic if you like lime & cilantro!

Very tasty. I added a little salt to the cooking water and used dried cilantro. This was light and refreshing and was a perfect side to my chicken enchiladas. This would go with any mexican type food. It was very good. Thanks!

I made this for a baby shower with a Fiesta theme and it was a big success. I quadrupled the recipe and only used half of the cilantro that was required. 

If you like a lot of cilantro flavor, go for the full amount. The flavor I achieved by halving the cilantro was mild but you still tasted it without it becoming too outrageous.

Good flavor, and very pretty. I did not find the amount of cilantro to be too much like some other reviewers, but I will be cutting back on the lime next time. (I should have started with a Tbs and tasted.) This went spectacularly well with some grilled chimichurri shrimp.

Followed some other suggestions and cut back on the cilantro....good idea.  Found the lime zest to be not really needed.  Just used a little more lime juice to taste.  Went well with the spicy garlic lime chicken recipe on the site.

I love the flavors!  I had previously tried making cilantro rice using dried cilantro (no lime), and it didn't work.  I would give this 5 stars except that my husband felt that the flavors were too strong.  He's willing to try again if I cut the lime juice to 1 T.  This recipe is a keeper, a pleasant change from most rice dishes.  I served with Key West Chicken from this site and green beans.  Excellent combination.

Has a very fresh taste that goes well with any Mexican meal.  I served it with fish tacos.  My boyfriend said it was plain.....and it's not a "wow" flavor, but a subtle fresh flavor.

Easy and flavorful side dish!  However, it was slightly too limey.  I did not add the lime zest, but did use 2 Tbl. lime juice.  I think I will cut the amount of juice to 1 1/2 Tbl. next time I make it.

This was a simple recipe, but, good.  Our local Mexican restaurant serves a cilantro rice that my husband loves and this is very close to their recipe.  I generally serve this in soft tacos with shredded roasted pork butt in tomatillo salsa, black beans, & queso cheese.

This went great with the Chicken w/Red Chile Sausage from this site.  The only change I made was I added a tablespoon of chicken boullion powder.

good starter recipe... after making this a few times I have the following changes, sautee rice with the butter in the skillet first, instead of water use chicken broth. for my own personal tastes I doubled the cilantro cooked half with the rice and put the other half in at the last few mins of cooking. also used a little more lime.  I love chipotle's rice and this is even better. My whole family loves this!

Good. My family liked it. I used instant rice and just added the cilanto and lime right before serving. A little salt and pepper as well. Didn't add the zest, didn't want it too limey tasting. Will make again for sure.

This was a good base, but you need to modify it slightly to match whatever you are serving it with.  When I served it with some sauce poured over it (Halibut in Rice Wine sauce), it was very good!  When I ate it by itself, I couldn’t get over the feeling that “something” was lacking.  The family liked it a lot more than regular rice, so it gets points for that, but I think when I make it again (yes, when, because I think this could be turned into something really good) I’ll add something to give the flavor a little more substance.  If I serve it with a Mexican dish, I’ll add a little cayenne.  If I serve it with an Asian dish, I’ll sauté some ginger with the rice ahead of time.  If I serve it with Indian, I might add some saffron.

Unless you love lime, you can definitely halve the juice over the rice. It was tasty and light fare. I might suggest adding some chopped veggies (perhaps peppers?) to kick up the mexican flair even more.

Very good for a spur of the moment side dish. I used 3 cups of minute rice. A Tbs of lime juice, Tbs. of butter and a tsp of salt per cup of water. After done I added 8 tsp of frozen chopped cilantro we can get in the frozen section. Thawed.  Easy, tasty and fast. Served it with a creamy green chili chicken dish and a Mexican salad.

Like a precious reviewer, when I first tried it after making it I didn’t think I would like it.   Tasted too much like lime; however, once it was served it was a hit.  Easy to make so I’ll be adding this to my quick meal list.

I had some jasmine rice that I had made from the day before that I had cooked for a Chinese dish so I just used that and heated it up a little, added a little butter and salt. I added the rest of the recipe and didn't skimp on the cilantro. It was a very good side to my enchiladas! Thanks for the recipe it's in my favorites!

I went with 50/50 water and chicken stock.  I also added a bit of Better Than Bouillion (chicken).  My rice was nearly ready after 10 minutes, so I fluffed up with a fork, turned the heat off and left it on the burner while I finished the rest of the meal.  It was a great side dish for Instant Pot Pork chops.

I am not a fan of cilantro, I'm one of those people that it tastes soapy to, so I used parsley. Next time I will either halve the parsley or double the rice. But a very nice side dish, that I will be making agin.,

Follow the recipe as it was written Except for the cilantro I put what I thought was a good amount for my family.  The amount called for was Way way to much unless you like cilantro like that- turned out so soooo fricking good!

I thought 50% cilantro sounded like too much, so I web searched other recipes and they all called for 1 to 2 Tablespoons per 1 cup of rice, not 1/2 cup cilantro to 1 cup rice. Glad I did. ?? I added am more lime juice, too. How much I can’t say because I did it to taste. It was a hit, though. I had several people at the dinner ask me for the recipe.

Waaayyy to much cilantro and lime.  Very overpowering. Ended up throwing the batch away. May try again halving the zest, lime. And cilantro.

I made a few tweaks based off of other reviews.  I melted the butter and sauteed the minced garlic for a minute, then added in the rice for about 4 minutes.  I did add dry minced onion because I didn't have an onion on hand and it sounded like a good flavor to add.  Used chicken broth instead of water - just poured it in with the rice, quickly brought it to boiling and cooked at stated above.  Did the full amount of lime and zest but cut the cilantro in half.  I also added in some salt, it helped bring out the lime flavor.  This went well with the Ropa Vieja I made for dinner.  Very simple but really delicious.  I'll make this again, using the same tweaks but hopefully adding in real onion next time :)

Liked this recipe, though I did make a few changes as some other reviewers had.   I used Jasmine rice and sauteed some finely diced onion and garlic in a tablespoon of butter for about 3 minutes before adding the chicken (in place of the water) to the pan.  Also added a bit of garlic salt.

I used jasmine rice instead. Added more lime and cilantro, cuz I love them both. I cooked the rice in a rice cooker, kept it on warm until dinner. Then added the lime and cilantro.  Yummy. Good the second day too

It was very easy to make and tasted great with the spicy rubbed pork I made. It was mild and yet flavorful and a nice contrast to to spices. Will make this again.

I made this last night to accompany a garlic lemon tilapia.  It was a nice accompaniment; however my family thought it was too limey.  Next time I will reduce the lime juice and lime zest.  Thanks!

I love this recipe, it's very addicting. Only adjustment I made was I used the juice of a freshly squeezed lime, amazing flavor and would be tasty in taco bowls and with fish!

Turned out not having enough flavor. I like to be able to TASTE the lime and cilantro and not just see it. I will make again but will use broth instead of water and increase the lime juice and cilantro.

Made this for Christmas with chicken tacos. Very good. I didn’t use as much cilantro. Only because I used most of what I  had in the salsa.

This had a wonderful lime flavor and I'm sure zesting the lime had much to do with it.  I changed from white rice to Basmati brown rice and decreased the water a bit (I made a BIG batch, increased the recipe 5x, so instead of 10 cups of water, I used  8 1/2 cups). Would definitely make it again.

awesome is all I can say. fun to make and worth the reward. added the rice to our tacos and we we're all blown away with the flavor it added. we used Jasmin rice in place of the long grain it was awesome good. Girlfriend loved it and her so had fun helping me make it. recipe definitely going into favorites list.

First time, I made the recipe as written.  It was lacking flavor.  The second time I added a 1/2 teas of sea salt, a dash of pepper and garlic powder.  I also added a bit less cilantro, family request.  This was much better.

This is a perfect rice/side dish for a Mexican meal.  I made one batch to taste it and then made another batch for a big family meal. I added sauteed garlic and onion.

My hubby & I absolutely loved it! I did however make one small change. I replaced chicken broth for the water. Otherwise followed recipe. We initially thought it would be too much cilantro but can be accommodated if need be for those that don’t like cilantro. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Want to kick this up? Add Knorr Tomato Bouillon to the water.  I used 3 limes because they seemed a little dry, no zest, and extra cilantro. 
I like Jasmine rice in this recipe. We eat this a few times a month. Take it for pot lucks and it is the first to disappear.

I used long grain jasmine white rice and cooked my rice in the microwave instead. I didn't use lime zest because I was lazy. I used fresh cilantro and lime juice(from a bottle).  I added 1/4 tsp of salt because I used unsalted butter. This was still absolutely fantastic!

I love cilantro and lime so I use 2 whole limes and 3x the cilantro that this recipe calls for. I made it by recipe the first time and it didn't have quite enough flavor. I use a tip from another reviewer; when done cooking the rice, cover the rice with a towel to soak up moisture. Be careful not to overcook the rice. I make this recipe often and I like to add smoked salmon or tilapia to make it a meal.

This was very good; however, it needed more punch of flavor.  Just a bit bland...added more cilantro, lemon and a pinch of salt.

We really liked this but, to be honest, I followed the suggestion to substitute chicken broth for water.  I also just juiced 1 large lime & used about a teaspoon of zest.  Really didn’t measure the lime or cilantro- just added until I was satisfied with the flavor.  I also put in a pinch of salt to make the flavor pop a little more.  All in all, delicious!  Thanks for a great, light side dish recipe.  This goes into my rotation for rice sides

This recipe is the bomb for vegetarians! I’m a poor college student and do not have zester-thingy, and was only able to add cilantro and lime juice, and it was still bangin’! I highly recommend for people who are low on funds and want something fun to go with their veggies!

I had left over rice in the fridge from the day before and it came out great.  Great way to use your left over rice for something different.  I also added black beans to it.

I followed the directions, as well as what some other said in their reviews. I cut back on the cilantro,  added cumin salt and pepper. And I prepared the rice like mexican rice and browned the rice in the butter along with the cumin salt and pepper. Then instead of using all water I substituted half of the water with chicken broth.  It came out delicious this way, not bland at all. Paired it with chicken and green sauce tacos.

Delicious!  I made one change, I felt it was a lot of cilantro  for my family so I cut it in half.  Amount would be fine if you love cilantro and want to taste quite a bit.

This was okay but I’m going to play around with it to see if I can’t make it more interesting & find a seasoning or something to compliment the lime flavor– as it stands it’s good but a little plain. (I also used a rice cooker instead of cooking stovetop and just mixed in the butter afterwards.)

I didn't make any changes but served it with salmon as suggested.  It complimented the salmon and made for a delicious light meal which included a green salad.  I will make this again!  Simple, easy and especially tasty.  Thank you!

This was pretty yummy, especially for it being super easy. Very flavorful--though next time I may add a dash of salt. I did wind up only using about half of the cilantro and that seemed to be perfect. I served this with Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken as well as the Fresh Corn and Zucchini Saute, both from this site, and everything paired very well together.

This is a simple and tasty recipe to make.  I typically just make my rice in the microwave using chicken broth instead of water to add more flavor.  I then add in the the other ingredients right after the rice comes out of the microwave and is still hot.  I have found that the amount of lime juice and zest are about right for our family.  I do, however, add in probably a teaspoon or so of cumin to give the rice a little added flavor.  This rice is a perfect side dish when you have meats or main courses with a lot of flavor because while this is zesty, the flavor is light and will not overpower everything else.  I have seen similar recipes where black beans are also added in so I may try this too at some point so mix things up a bit.

I was surprised how well this went over with the family. I was a little nervous because of the lime. But my rice lover in the family gave it 2 thumbs up so that was great. I served this with Simple Carnitas (on this site). Great combo.

Easy to make and light, fluffy dish that goes well with fish. I will make it again but might sub 1 cup of water with chicken broth to give it a more hearty flavor!

Very good. I used one cup of chicken broth and one cup of  water and cut back on the cilantro. I think the amount of cilantro called for in the recipe would have been too much for our tastes. After cooking the rice I covered the top of the saucepan with a dish towel and allowed it to sit for ten minutes to absorb the  moisture. Perfect!

We never use butter on rice so it was a great addition. The proportions were great too and much better than when I did it on my own. I did not have that much lime zest but it still worked out great when I just shredded the outside of the partial lime I had.  I also only used a partial fresh lime and the rest was jarred lime juice.

I loved this!!..i gave it 4 stars because I didn't have a rice cooker (on the to do list) so it was a bit sticky. But the taste is crisp and tart soooo good. The only thing I tweaked was I added an extra tsp of lime juice.  Delish

This is so good, and will be a more frequent visitor in the rice rotation. We felt this was missing something, so I added small diced fresh pineapple--maybe 1/2 a cup, and it was perfect. Had as a side the first night, and the second night had in chicken soft tacos.

We thought the rice was very good. I put a bit more juice in it, and a little more zest. It was a nice addition to the pork that I made, that had lime in the marinade.

The family liked this as a dish with Old El Paso beef enchiladas and refried beans. We don't care for spanish rice so this was a good alternative. Very fresh and it was still good as a leftover. I plan on making it again.

Kept forgetting to substitute water for chicken broth, but it still worked out because of the little extra butter I used. It was still a little plain so I added a little more lime juice, a couple pinches of salt and pepper and sprinkled on some cotija cheese before serving. Worked out great!

Such a simple recipe, but it is truly a crowd pleaser!  I used veggie broth instead of water to enhance the flavor. Turned out perfectly!  Can't wait to make this recipe again on our next taco night!

I had only had this dish in a restaurant, but really like it then.  I can now say the same about this recipe!   I used instant rice, added a little finely chopped onion that I had sautéed in butter to the boiling water at the same time that I added the rice.  Once it was done in 5 minutes, I added the cilantro, lime juice and lime zest.  My husband who does not care for rice,  and I both really liked it!  We had it first with shredded venison soft tacos.  I rewarmed the leftover rice in the microwave to serve tonight with cilantro lime grilled salmon, also from Allrecipies.

recipe was good, but I made it a second time and made some adjustments.  I made it in my rice cooker.  I threw in 3 cups of rice, 4 cups of water, 3 tablespoons butter, juice of 1 lime, 2 tsp Chicken bouillon , 1 tsp lime zest, mixed it all and let it cook.  when it was done I threw in the 1/2 cup of cilantro and let it all sit for about 15 minutes...delish.

I made the cilantro rice and it was really good. I did cut back on the amount of cilantro and was glad I did. It turned out perfect. I served it with fish so the flavor was really nice with fish. I will make this again and again.

One of the easiest dishes I've ever made... And though it didn't require much time, it certainly didn't lack in flavor. 

I zested my lime, squeezed the juice, and chopped up the cilantro and mixed it all together in a large bowl. I popped the rice in the microwave and poured the rice onto the lime/cilantro mixture. I mixed it all together and added a pinch of salt and garnished with a lime. 
It was delicious and it took me a total of 5 minutes! 

* I used 2 packs of Instant Jasmine Rice and didn't use any butter.

Super easy and a nice change to white or yellow rice. I never have limes so I made without the lime zest and still great. A nice compliment to Tilapia with Mango salsa.

I made this as a side dish along side wild Alaskan salmon. I had 10 guest over and everyone loved this rice dish, even the picky eaters liked it!
I sautéed some fresh garlic in evoo and the dry rice for a few minutes before adding the liquids. I used low sodium chicken stock instead of water. I added the lime juice, zest and cilantro at the very end so you get the full flavors. It was fabulous!!  None left at the end of dinner :)

I was expecting to love this since I love Chipotle's cilantro lime rice. It had a really weird taste that I'm attributing to way too much cilantro. I probably also could have cut it finer. The only other change I made was I added a ton of salt, it needed it!

This is a very light and refreshing side for grilled foods or anything spicy.  I suggest cutting down on the amount of cilantro-I used 3 Tablespoons and it was enough for my family, and we enjoy the flavor of cilantro.

This was delicious and super easy!!! My husband and I love cilantro, so I didn't cut back on it as others have done. I will say that it was a bit bland until I added salt...then it was perfect!  We loved it! I served it with Chicken Mole, black beans and guacamole. It was a hit and I will be making this as a side for many of my dishes!!!

Maybe my expectations were too high but we did not care for this rice at all. It turned out mushy after the lime was added.  The lime was overpowering, and it seemed to lack something - maybe salt?  I was hoping to duplicate the rice at Chipotle, but this was not even close.

Easy,  clean flavor. I make either Jasmine or Basmati by the package instruction.  After it is cooked, I add the butter, then the rest of ingredients and let it rest for 5-10 mins with cover on.

This dish is made to accompany a meal and it does it perfectly. On it's own the lime is overwhelming. But mixed in with a spicy dish it neutralizes the flavors. We loved it.

Can't get enough of this stuff.  So easy and so flavorful.  I don't measure the lime juice, zest or cilantro.  I just keep adding until it's just right for my taste.  Now I can get delicious "Chipotle" rice at home and without having to spend $7 on a burrito.

I made this in the rice cooker with chicken stock instead of water and just a bit of vegetable oil. Turned out really good. The lime taste is a little on the weak side, so I'd add a bit more lime juice and lime zest next time. Mixed in a bit f butter at the end as it was just a tad dry. Turned out pretty good. I think some additional lime juice and zest would make this a 5 star recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This rice was quite scrumptious. I was worried the lime would be too overpowering, but it was perfect. The dish is light, but very flavorful. Like other reviewers suggested, I significantly cut back on the cilantro. But otherwise, recipe is great as is. Will definitely make again.

Very good and simple recipe.  It tastes a lot like the rice at our local Mexican restaurant.  If  you have a rice steamer I would cook it in that rather on the stove.  It gives the rice a better texture.  Instead of adding butter while it's cooking, I used a little drizzle of oil while mixing the ingredients in to keep the rice grains separated.  We really enjoyed this.  Thanks for sharing.

This rice is very good. I had to use parsley as I did not have cilantro at the moment. I think I would use a tid bit less water to avoid it to end up sticky. I did add a little extra teaspoon of lime juice as I like it a lot! I also added a little bit of salt to it too!

Great way to dress up rice! My family really liked this. Next time I will try replacing half the water with coconut milk, I think it would be a great match.

Thiis is wonderful with wine poached whole sockeye salmon. I used basmati rice so a slight change in timing and half the cilantro . The citrus in the rice  is a great balance with the salmon.

This was a great side dish for our chicken chili verde.  The rice was light and fluffy and had a delicate lime /cilantro flavor.  I will probably add a little more lime juice as my family enjoys that flavor.  My eldest daughter loves the rice from Chipotle and said it tasted like theirs.  Thanks for sharing --we really enjoyed it!

Good. I added garlic. Works well with leftover white rice too!  Just add a bit of water to the pan and reheat rice. Add the rest.

I was a little afraid it would be too much citrus for my kid but he didn't even seem to notice it. I think it could actually use a little more lime, but it's pretty perfect as is. After it finished cooking in the rice cooker (and it sat for 5 minutes) I added the lime and cilantro and salt. This went perfectly with the whole roasted chicken recipe.

Easy & delicious.  Made the rice in the rice cooker then added the other ingredients, making no changes in quantities.  It has a lot of flavor without a lot of calories.  Will make this again.

Pretty good - I added salt and pepper and an extra pat of butter before serving as it seemed a little bland.  I used up some basmati rice for this.  Served it with something spicy and saucy and it was a perfect match!

My family devoured this easy twist to a typical staple.  I served it with a lime-cilantro inspired 'mexican chicken cacciatore" on top of the rice.  My kids liked it, hubby said "it's a keeper!"

It would probably be good in a burrito, but by itself it is not very good. If you do decide to make this, start with a few teaspoons of the lime juice and only add it to taste.  The whole amount of lime juice called for in the original recipe is WAY too much.

I am not sure what happened with this recipe.  I followed it exactly as written and either my ingredients were bad, or I just don't like the cilantro lime flavors together.  After trying a bite and disliking it, I had my husband try it, and he also said that he couldn't eat another bite.  With so many higher ratings, it may just be our personal preference, so I won't try this one again - Sorry!

This does taste a lot like the rice in Qdoba's burritos. I used a rice cooker and we ate it as a side with the "Fish Tacos with Honey-Cumin Cilantro Slaw and Chipotle Mayo" (yum!) from this site.  I thought the rice was a fresh, tasty, and simple side; my husband thought it was good, but didn't feel it was flavorful enough to be a stand-alone side dish. Perhaps using broth instead of water would give the rice a little more flavor.

I used a rice cooker, and then mixed everything together. I used slightly less cilantro than called for, because I didn't quite have 1/2 cup on hand. I'm glad though - the full amount would have been too much for us. We had "Chipotle Night" at our house, and this rice recipe was perfect!

This was fabulous! I used instant brown rice and followed the instant directions. Then added the lime and cilantro after. I will definitely make it again just the same!

This was so good! Wonderful flavors! The flavors were a little bland, but rice isn't usually served as anything other than a side dish. It complimented the spicy garlic lime chicken I made from here. Will definitely make this again!

Great! I left out the cilantro because I don't like it - I also subbed brown rice so that increased the cooking time - I bet it is so delicious on white rice, but it is good on brown too :o)

Make sure to use an aromatic rice like basmati for this. I even found the brown rice version.  I added a chicken boullion to the water. Start small with the cilantro and then taste it. I like cilantro alot so 1/2 cup is ok for me.

Goes well with everything...Spanish, Asian, Indian, Med... You really don't have to measure, just add what you have or want.  Olive oil works well too instead of butter.  Add a little ginger for Asian flare.

Excellent!  It was a big hit at the make your own burrito bar I set up for a party.  I used a long grain brown rice and skipped the zest (I had bottled lime juice, no fresh lime).

This dish is amazing and definitely reminds me the famous restaurant!  The only modification I made was instead of using long grain rice, I used Basmati Rice.  It's pretty much the same rice they use in the restaurant and it smells really good when it's cooking!  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was great! Really good flavors to make white rice a little more exciting. I will definitely make again- also, what an easy way to use up extra cilantro- I always seem to have some leftover from other dishes, so this was perfect. Thanks!

Not bad if you want to make quick additions to jazz up plain rice.  My husband and I thought the lime was a little overpowering and I wasn't altogether "enthused" about the taste.  Probably won't make again.

Wow!!!  How super easy is this!!  I didn't really measure what I was putting in, so it was just the juice of one lime (that seemed to be really, really juicy).  Omitted the lime zest.  But, it was SOOO easy and VERY good.  I didn't add the tablespoon of margarine in with the rice, and I felt the rice was lacking a flavor, and that was it.  I will make sure to do that next time (got the wife's permission to do so; normally, she doesn't like that in anything).  Will make this again in a heartbeat!!!

With just a little salt and pepper this is great! Very crisp and refreshing.  A good change from the usual Mexican rice!

I loved this rice! I could almost eat it by itself. I did increase the amount of juiced used to the juice from 1 1/2 limes. Very very tasty and very very simple!

Really tasty and easy too.  I did not zest the lime due to a time crunch.  The rice really didn't need it anyway. The lime juice provides a nice salty taste.  We paired this with chicken tacos.  Very good!

A very delightful dish!  I used unsalted butter and added 1/4 tsp. salt.  I also only used about 1 Tbsp. lime juice because it's all I had left!  It tasted great with "Margarita Grilled Shrimp" from this site served over top.

This recipe was great.  Very simple and healthy.  I was afraid 2 tbs of lime juice would be too much, but it was perfect.  I used jasmine rice because that was what I had on hand and it was a good complement with its nutty flavor.

Very fresh and clean taste. Great served along side chicken enchiladas or any other Mexican main dish. I did not have white rice, so used brown. It was really good marriage of flavors, the brown rice has a bit of a "nutty" flavor.

I made this to go along with Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs from this site.  It was great.  We liked it a lot.

Very refreshing and easy.  I made this purposefully with a hot spicy chicken and it was really refreshing to have this as a side dish.  I used one whole bunch of cilantro and squeezed the whole lime into the rice after I zested it.  GREAT.
