These had a great flavor.  I did bake them, but don't overbake or they will dry out quickly.

I also baked them, but  I added about 1 1/2 cup of crumbled blue cheese to the ground chicken mixture.  (I made a 3 lb batch, so reduce cheese for smaller batch) The cheese gave it great flavor, and the result must have helped against getting too dry. My family loved this. Will make it again!

These were really good.  I baked them and they came great.  Used extra hot sauce on the side.

Yummy meatballs. I didn't need too much oil to get these brown so it worked out well. I had some leftover Gorgonzola so I melted that on top.. yum

Followed the recipe, really thought this would be better, but was very disappointed.  Threw most of them out.

I really liked these.  I feel like spicy things really satisfy my cravings. I served them really hot with light ranch dressing and they were healthy and good.

They turned out a little dry but not bad.  I baked them instead of frying, so I could have overcooked them a bit.  If I make them again, I'll simmer them in a bit of salsa, or serve with cheese sauce.

definitely don't overcook these! they dry out fast! also could use less of the stuffing for a better result.
