These were pretty good. They are very plain though, you definitely need to serve them with some sort of sauce. We served ours without buns and topped with dijon tartar sauce.

I really enjoyed these tuna patties. Since tuna is packaged in 5 oz. cans nowadays, I slightly decreased all the other ingredients except for the egg and the tomatoes. I used canned tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh ones. I cooked the patties 5 minutes longer on each side and served them with an easy remoulade sauce.

I deviated from the recipe slighty but was very impressed! I used Pace diced onions with green chili's for a little more flavor.  I will definitely be making these again!

Not that flavourful.  Needed maybe some spicyness?

Kids liked it but my husband and I did not. Bland but tuna was overpowering.

As a base, these are great.  I've seen on here that some people think these are bland - if you utilize the Rotelle Tomatoes and Chiles they are not bland. I didn't have a can, so I used a can of diced Chiles, a 2oz jar of diced pimentos and 1/4 tsp ground Cayenne - these are all flavors my dad and I like.  Once these were finished in the pan, I added a slice of cheese and some Kraft No-Fat Mayonnaise (with a little cayenne mixed in) spread onto the Sandwich Thin, and it was a hearty lunch.

A lot tastier than I expected. Both my sister and mother loved it! However,  I made some alterations, instead of  onion powder, I used actual onions (I love onions too much) and used cod instead of tuna. But the basics of the recipe were quick and easy to follow. Will be making again upon request of my mother. :)

I've made several versions of Tuna Cakes, but this was by far the best recipe.  We don't like raw onion so I substituted a teaspoon of onion powder. Also, don't over mix. I topped the cakes with my homemade aoili and served them on a bed of cole slaw. My husband rated the dinner "restaurant quality".

I made this gluten free. I used 2 cans of Sprouts Fried Onions. Chopped 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion. For spices I added garlic salt, sea salt, Walgreens chili powder. I also added about 1 cup of finely sharp cheddar. Then I fried mine up and served them with Wishbone Ranch. It was a big hit. They tasted like crab cakes. I left out the tomatoes because I usually don't use tomatoes with any fish that I cook. It was a good base recipe.

I liked this. It was very easy to make, however I used fresh garlic, paprika and a squeeze of lime for some added flavour. It took a little longer to bake as I wanted some big patties. 
Thanks for the dish. I will be using this more often as a healthy and fun substitute.
