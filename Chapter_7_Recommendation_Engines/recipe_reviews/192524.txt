This soup is a very good base for your own tastes. The only problem was that I had to add a few bouillon cubes, since my stock didn't come out very flavorful. I also added spinach, mushrooms, and green beans. My husband said this was restaurant quality soup.

Very good! I didn't use the lemon juice or packaged wild rice. I had a big container of wild rice, so I added a cup of that with some oregano, thyme, garlic salt, and black pepper. Also ommitted the garlic.

A good recipe to be sure. Please wait until youve added the chicken/veggie/rice/juice to the soup before seasoning with boullion. The flavor really comes out when they meet. I ended up adding some cream to my bowl to kick it up a little more.

This soup was so good. I made a big pot of this and my husband loved it. The favor was out of this world. I will make often. Good with a salad and some bread.

I made this when I had a few friends over and discovered I did not have any wild rice, but did have some Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice Mix.  My only change was to use 1/2 and 1/2 in place of the cream.  It was a great success with both the guest and children.  Very easy to make and stands up to being in the crockpot well.  Thanks for sharing....you save the day!

My 1 year old daughter liked it much.  I didn't have fresh parsley nor fresh lemon juice but still...she ate all of it.  I thought it was ok.

This was ok, not as flavourful as I hoped and too much rice.
