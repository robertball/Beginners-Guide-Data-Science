I am always looking for breakfast food, as I am allergic to eggs, gluten, dairy, and soy.  I gave this recipe a try.  Here are my recommendations:  Use rice you've already cooked (maybe left over), as the water to rice ratio in this recipe produces dry rice.  Also, recommend using a GF flour blend rather than just one GF flour.  Also recommend adding some xanthan gum.  The recipe turned out very crumbly and didn't hold together.  Overall, I thought flavor was lacking, and the consistency was dry.  The good part is 8 grams of protein in the recipe per serving.
