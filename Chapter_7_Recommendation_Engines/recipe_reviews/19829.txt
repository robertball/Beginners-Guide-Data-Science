I was looking for a quick and easy recipe to make in order to use up my fresh pineapple.  This was amazing!  Definitely a keeper.  The only changes I made was using fresh pineapple, enough to cover the bottom of the dish, 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar, and sprinkled a generous amount of ground cinnamon on top.  My family loved it, so I will be making it again soon.

This was a great recipe to use up the pineapple that my boyfriend bought, promised he would eat and then of course, never did.  :)  I didn't know if it would be enough so I added some kiwis to it as well and it turned out tasting really good.  The only thing I would have done differently (and should have followed the others' advice) is cut the butter in half because it was WAY too much and made the centre liquidy. All around great flavour though.

2 stars for helping me find a use for my fresh pineapple, but egg???  I ditched the topping recipe and topped it with brown sugar, rolled oats and cinnemon.  It was awesome!

It was surprisingly good.  I used one can crushed pineapple and one can pineapple tidbits.  The topping was quite sweet which was actually a nice contrast with the pineapple.

Very good!  The whole family loved it!  I halved the butter though because I thought 1/2 c was too much...1/4 c worked just fine!

What an amazing dessert fresh out of the oven topped with some whipped cream. I made this to use up a fresh pineapple that was starting to look old. I had my doubts. I even made my husband try it first because I didn't think it would be any good...I was way off! In the past month I have made this 3 more times and have served it to company without complaints. Put your doubts aside and try this recipe!!

After spreading the pineapple in the baking dish, I combined the remaining ingredients and then evenly spooned little dollops of the dough over the pineapple. Total prep time was less than 10 minutes!  In baking, the dough spread out and covered the pineapple beautifully with a crisp on the outside, chewy type dough that was delicious! I served it with vanilla ice cream and hubby took leftovers to work, ate it cold, no ice cream and told me he'd be happy if I made this one again!  The tartness from the pineapple and the  sweetness of the dough was a great combination.

This recipe was a hit at a July 4th picnic/potluck.  I made the dessert according to the recipe, except that I substituted one fresh pineapple (I had one on hand, but one wasn't enough so I had to combine it with 28 oz. of canned).  It was delish - everyone raved about it!  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was very easy to make and a big hit.  Put out cool whip to serve with it, but the guests thought it was great alone.  A few 
people asked for the recipe.

Delicious!  I used fresh pineapple cut in chunks.  I halved the recipe and made in a loaf pan.  It baked in 30 minutes.  Excellent with a spoonful of cool whip!

Just tried the recipe and the language (smooth) for the topping threw me off a bit.  There is nothing to liquify the mix but 1 egg. So to get it smooth through me off.  Just popped this in the oven and I hope this turns out great. The mixture was thick and not smooth.

This was SO GOOD! I used 1 can of crushed pineapple and 1 can of pineapple chunks, reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and mixed the cinnamon right in with the rest of the topping ingredients. Mine only took about 20-25 minutes to cook. I served this warm with vanilla ice cream~DELICIOUS!!!! I will definately be making this simple, yummy recipe often! Thanks for sharing. :)

We just got back from Hawaii and had a family picnic to go to. We were still feeling the island spirit so we were looking for something that would travel well and be made with pineapple. This did it! The only things I changed were that I added shaved coconut to the topping mixture (and reduced flour by 1/4 cup in place of the coconut) and before I poured the butter on top I sprinkled chopped macadamia nuts for that extra Hawaiian flair. This was a hit! Will definitely make again, perhaps with some chunks of pineapple vs crushed. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Nothing to write home about. Good idea though.Definitely called for too much butter and I've never used an egg in crisp toppping before. I would make pineapple crisp again but just use my regular crisp topping recipe.

Thank you for sharing this great and easy recipe!
It is just as delicious as my fave apple crisp
but less laborious (i.e. no peeling or slicing apples)

Yummy!  I used a whole fresh pineapple and half splenda, half brown sugar.  Delish!  I found that it didn't need to bake quite as long as the recipe calls for though.

Not real impressed....The egg was not enough to make the dry ingredients become smooth.  Seemed like a lot of cinnamon.  Easier and tastier to just use a cake mix to make a cobbler.

I would suggest spraying the pan with Pam first since the topping bakes on and is hard to clean off. I was a little unsure of the egg in the topping, and the idea of melting the butter and pouring on top instead of mixing it into the sugar and flour unmelted, as is usually the way to do a crisp, but this came out very well and very crunchy.

This isn't knock-your-socks-off-good but I'm giving it five stars because it is really delicious and just so  easy. My guests made lots of yummy sounds :). I did 1/2 cup dark and 1/2 cup light brown sugar; just 1/4 cup Earth Balance margarine; one can crushed pineapple and one can tidbits; and I went crazy with the cinnamon! Make sure you drain the pineapple really well!!

This recipe didn't turn out for me at all. It was too bready and didn't have very good flavor. I think I'll stick to the usual upside down cake!

YUM!!! Followed the recipe exactly and WILL make again. I might add some vanilla or almond extract, just for kicks! Other than that, awesome! I served with vanilla frozen yogurt and it's gone, now! (Came out of the oven 15 minutes ago!!!)

"Smooth' is misleading here...'sandy' may be more appropriate when describing the mixed together topping.  Be aware, it is not a liquid by any means.  I used a combination of diced peaches, plums and cantaloupe for about the same amount as recommended for pineapple. Lovely and different.  Everyone ate it up!

Excellent!  I have been searching for a way to bake with fresh pineapple.  All my muffins, cookies and cakes have crumbled - possibly because of the acidity?  Anyways, a crisp is the perfect solution and this one is easy.  I used self-rising flour instead of added baking powder and salt and I halved the butter and sugar because that suits my preferences.  I think I'll experiment with adding some coconut and cashews for a truly tropical treat.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I have made this countless times this spring/summer. I've used only fresh cut-up pineapple, peaches, blueberries, mango, kiwi and a mix of fruits together.  I have only received rave reviews and requests to bring it along.  I thought the egg in the crisp was strange too, but I went with it and it's ALWAYS a hit. I sub brown sugar for brown granulated (organic) sugar, use less than called for and sometimes add honey or agave sugar (syrup). Lots of cinnamon too. My mother-in-law said I should rate it since it's fantastic.

This is a great substitute for the Apple Crisp. I used fresh pineapple, and half the butter. It turned out great. You have to try the topping as it is in the recipe, egg and all.

I think this was my fault as I used a fresh pineapple. The crisp was yum but the rest was not. I used 1/2 the butter as suggested but still it did not mix well with the pineapple. I love the idea, but for me did not come out well.

The end result was disappointing. One egg was not by any means enough to make the topping "smooth". It had a cement-like consistency and was almost too hard to chew. I used 3/4 cup sugar (still a little too sweet) and 1/4 butter. I also added one apple. I am glad this wasn't very expensive to make, because now is not the time to waste food.

I have always wondered why they always tell you to drain the juice out in pineapple recipes generally - that's where most of the flavour is!  So, I am making this with the juice boiled down & then mixed with the melted butter.

Excellent dessert. I love oats so I added a layer of old fashioned oats on top of fruit and also mixed in oats to the batter mixer. I also used a little of the butter to help mix the batter instead of pouring all of it on top.
I also used fresh pineapple cause I had it.
Turned out fantastic!

I used about 3/4 cup light brown and 1/2 cup dark because I ran out of light. I only mixed dough, to which I directly added  a few shakes of ground cinnamon, until about half of the flour was wet and there were a fair number of clumps. Baked 40 mins. Loved it. Will make again.

I decided to use half the amount of butter on top just to cut a few calories and if you're careful when you pour it over the crisp it'll cover. Also, I used one 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and half of a 20 oz can of chunked pineapple (chunks spread evenly). Personal preference. 

As well, this crisp is ridiculously tasty and if you like pineapple at all you will be hooked. As in, "I ate the whole pan by myself...Oops!" kinda hooked. So baker beware.

I was searching Christmas afternoon for a dessert,as I hadn't properly planned. I had some pineapple that needed to be eaten, so when I came across this, I figured why not! Well, I am so happy I did. This was the best crisp I have ever eaten!! As other reviewers remarked, the topping was a bit dry when mixing, so I added in some veg oil. 
It was crispy, even after being refrigerated. It was so delicious, I had to print the recipe out for the mil. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

This was very good but not excellent. I found the topping to be absolutely delicious, but the pineapple portion of the cake was just okay. I think I would have preferred it to be more sweet. I think I'll try making this again with the pineapple in heavy syrup...it might make it more flavorful.

I thought this idea was great, but wanted more of just the "crisp". So I left out the egg and baking powder. Mixed all the ingredients (minus the pineapple) together till it was crumbs. Sprinkle over pineapple. Delicious!  I added 1/4 cup rolled oats, also.

My new "go to" dessert! I even made it in individual ramekins for a dinner party. One note is the original recipe says to combine the topping until smooth. With one egg and all of the dry ingredients, I don't know if you'll ever get something smooth. Mine turns into a crumbly mixture so I use all of the butter or else I don't think it would cook properly.

This is absolutely delicious, Bea! It takes no time at all to prepare, and was better than we had expected. As another reviewer, I think the "smooth" descriptor of the crumb topping is a bit misleading. It came together kind of like the consistency of moist sand for me, and I sprinkled it over the pineapple. I did spray my 9x9 first, because I was a little weary of sticking. Next time I might use 1 can of crushed, and 1 can of tidbits, but otherwise there's no adjustment necessary for a quick and easy weekday dessert!

this tastes amazing!  few changes:  i use 3-4 fresh pineapples, add some brown sugar to the pineapple, use 1/4 cup butter, and sprinkle cinnamon and white sugar generously on top before baking.  Delish!

i had an open can of crushed pineapple that need to be used. i added a little orange jucie and brown sugar to the pineapple in the pan. and i only used 1/4 melted butter, as others suggested. 40 mins would have been way to long for mine. it was nice and brown after only 20 mins

This was dessert on a cold, rainy night and it was a 10.  Cut the butter down by half and the crunch came out excellent.  I added brown sugar to the pineapple as another suggested and it gives the pineapple a nice texture, almost a bit of a chew.  This with a big gob of vanilla ice cream on top is a home run!  Excellent for a last minute dessert idea as it's all stuff in the pantry.

This recipe is perfect as written. So easy and tasty! Next time I won't drain my pineapple so much but leave just a little juice to mix with the butter. I used the drained juice to marinate chicken for skewers on the BBQ.

I wouldn't know because the "pour melted butter " on after was not a separate step which it should be. Now I think I will have pineapple goop, but I'm sure it will still taste good so whatever. Will probably try this again but to those who contribute recipes, please keep steps that clearly stand alone separate.

What a simple but delicious recipe.   I have made several times and will be taking this to family 4th of July picnic.  I use one fresh pineapple and 1 large can of crushed pineapple.  I do cut back on the butter in topping but otherwise make as directed.  I like to serve with cinnamon ice-cream.  If you can't find it at local supermarket just buy a good quality vanilla,  let soften at room temperature, then add a couple TBLS cinnamon or to taste and mix well.  Then refreeze.  Yummy dessert and simple to make.

Easy, yummy recipe!  I think I'll stick to peach or apple crisp in the future though.

Really good.  I made a few changes, though.   I used fresh pineapple, cut into chunks.  I measured 20 oz which was just about one half of a pineapple.  I halved the fruit (20 oz instead of 40), butter, and dry ingredients, but used one egg, and added 1/2 cup old fashioned oatmeal to the crumble mixture.  I baked this in a 6x6 dish for 40 minutes.  This is a wonderfully springtime 'cobbler'. Very easy.

I made it as directed, the topping didn't get smooth (no liquid, only one egg) I tried it anyway....
It smelled good, but it didn't taste good... my friends didn't like it either...

Made this exactly as written.  Way too dry!  Perhaps I drained the pineapple too well, but it was dry as was the topping.  Taste is good, but will not make it again.  Definitely needed some whipped cream on top to moisten it a bit.  Ouch.

I thought this recipe was great! I bought a pineapple and didn't know what to do with it and this was the perfect way to treat it! I did add a couple different things like oats and white sugar on top to help absorb butter and make a sweet crust. I also topped it with ice cream, caramel, and praline pecans! YUMMO!!

Very Good, I used a fresh pineapple and 1/2 c brown/1/2 c white sugar.  Minimally processed pineapple and drained. Was perfect, every one loved it. Super easy to make, this is a keeper.

This was delicious! I used one fresh pineapple instead of the cans. In addition, I only used 1/4 c. of butter as other reviewers suggested. I also did not use an egg or baking powder for the topping and it still came out great!

This was delicious warm out of the oven, but we didn't like it cold.  I served it with frozen whipped topping(still mostly frozen), it was good served like that.  I would make this again if I had a can of crushed pineapple to use up, but probably wouldn't make a point to make it again.

This was fab! I actually made it for my husband's birthday, looking for something that I could use fresh pineapple for (his favorite) that wasn't a pineapple upside-down cake. So I replaced the canned pineapple with a whole fresh cut pineapple I chopped in the food processor, and it turned out perfect! Easy and quick to make, excellent flavor and consistency. My husband loved it with whipped cream. Definitely a keeper!

I saw a recently done picture of this and had to try it (it looked super good). It is good, a nice change from the traditional apple crisp and a hit with my husband the pineapple lover. We think its better served cold with ice cream instead of hot. thanks!

Egg in a crisp recipe I admit seemed different, but this was delicious, my husband absolutely devoured it.
I used only 1 can of crushed pineapple and added 1 kiwi. I made more crisp mix but not exactly doubled, and I just mixed the melted butter in with it. Delish!

Anything pineapple usually works for me and this really works, I added some extra pineapple as a topping I threw on after baking to add just a bit more pineapple deliciousness to it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was a quick and easy way to use up a fresh pineapple that I didn’t want to waste! My kids typically want fruit crisps over cobblers (with cinnamon oatmeal topping) so this was a little different for them, but loved by all! My only substitution was the fresh pineapple instead of canned, but I might try adding grated coconut to the pineapple next time. And maybe a little more cinnamon! Definitely a keeper!

Delicious, simple, quick, and so satisfying with some ice cream. The only adjustments I made was halving the pineapple amount because I was worried about it fitting in my small pan. I did everything else according the recipe and was very happy with the results for my first cobbler/crisp dessert.

I gave it 5 stars - 4 stars because it is quick, easy and good. And 1 extra star because the recipe is a good base for something a little different.

As written, it was a little sweet, so I suggest you lessen the amount of sugar.

Also I took some of the mixture (about a third) and adden a little leftover pineapple juice in the topping so it resembled a slightly thick cake batter. I cook it along with the original.

The original was like you would expect a crumble or crisp to be. The second was more like upside down cake.

I had such high hopes for this recipe, and then went into a panic when I was not able to "stir until smooth" as the recipe instructs since the only liquid for 1 cup each of flour and sugar is a single egg. Fear not! This turned out wonderfully. The butter soaked into my dry grainy crumbles and the oven did its magic and what came out was essentially pineapple upside down cake without the cake or cherries. Ends up that's exactly what I was looking for. So this gets 4 stars from me, losing one for not accurately presenting how the dry ingredients will come together. Full marks for deliciousness.

This was so delicious & ridiculously easy to make! I read some of the reviews & followed not doing a full half cup of melted butter. Also, of the quarter cup , I used half pure unrefined cold pressed Coconut Oil &  half butter. The crust was perfect!

I made this to use up some canned pineapple and pears. Took other reviewers' suggestions and decreased the brown sugar and butter by about half. So easy to put together that I got it in the oven while dinner was cooking on the stove.  It smelled so good during baking! Turned out just as I'd hoped. Kids and I loved it!! Definitely saving the recipe.

Thank you for this. I also only added only 1/2 cup of sugar and it was perfect. I also added a sprinkle of shredded coconut and dried oats too. Worked very well. Also, my oven it only needed to be in for 12 mins!! Not much cooking required at all.

Good and Easy.  Just a little too sweet will do less on sugars next time.

This recipe should be called Pineapple Cobbler, for there is a batter dalloped on it. Crisps have rolled oats, flour, sugars, etc.

I only used one 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple (it was all I had at the time in the pantry) and it tasted fabulous!

Really delicious! I was sceptical but made it just as the recipe said, only with fresh pinapple. The egg added a nice consistency to the topping.

These directions are incorrect.  The directions say to mix the ingredients "until smooth".  However, when you view the directions on the video, it shows that when you mix the ingredients together it becomes granular.  Mine was not smooth (it was granular) so I added another egg to make it smooth.  Consequently, the crisp became "cakey".  I didn't check the video until after it was done baking.

Excellent sweet desert for those who love the flavor of pineapple upside down cake but with a crisp instead! Made forty servings with rice flour in place of traditional flour. Also added raisin granola and a splash of vanilla to the crisp mixture. Delicious!

I did exactly what the recipe called for and it came out pretty good. Think next time ill use more brown sugar and leas flour as it had more if a over powering flour taste but that couldve been my measuring. But was good and will make again

Highly recommend. Very simple fruit dessert recipe and great for a bbq or cookout with ingredients I already have. I used half pineapple and half strawberry and used a simple icing drizzled on top made out of powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. I plan on using this as a basic recipe for other fruit "cobblers" as well. I was going to use peach and blackberry this time but only have peach and blueberry. Goes great with whatever I throw on the grill for dinner.

I made this for a "new" dessert for Thanksgiving. I added a can of pineapple chunks .I doubled the topping ingredients and in error combined them all together. Continued to spread evenly over top using a 8x11.5x2 pan. Turned out Yummy!

All the yummy flavors of a pineapple upside cake with less work.  I used a whole cored pineapple from the market.  I could see this with a little grated coconut added to the batter - a pina colada twist.  May try next time.

This was very good.  Not too sweet.  I made two changes. I am allergic to cinnamon so I left that out and I used a cup of gluten-free baking mix instead of flour since I can't have it.  It still turned out great!

This was delicious!  By far the best crisp topping I've had. I thought maybe just canned crushed pineapple would be dull, but on the contrary - it was wonderful. I did the recipe as is and served warm with top quality vanilla ice cream. I'll try this topping with other fruits too. A keeper!

We enjoyed this as a nice change from more "traditional" fruit crisps. I used 1 can crushed/1 can chunks (for texture), but it would definitely be better with fresh pineapple. My husband thought it was great as-is, but my personal opinion is that the pineapple layer is a bit bland so next time I will mix some brown sugar and spices into it, as well as putting it on the top. Also, I will cut the flour down by half as I felt it drowned out the sugary, spicy flavors.

This is the bomb! I was nervous when I added the egg and couldn't get it to a smooth consistency, but went ahead with it. I am so glad I did. I used pineapple rings and crushed pineapple. It is not too sweet, but sweet enough. I also used a bit more butter, just because I am a butter fan. Thanks Bea, for a great recipe. YUM!

My husband loved this recipe. The next day he was searching for leftovers(there were none!)I used fresh pineapple and it turned out delicious.

This was great - I used fresh pineapple but didn't have enough so I mixed in so chopped up canned peaches and that was a great combination.

This recipe was wonderful. I only wish I had some ice cream to put on top. The post who ditched the egg and use flour and oats missed out on a good thing.

I am only giving this three stars because it didn't turn out right but, it tasted fine.  I'm not really sure that the topping is so great with pineapple because it reminds me more of something over a peach cobbler or apple crisp.  But, since it's so easy I'll hang on to it and try again.
