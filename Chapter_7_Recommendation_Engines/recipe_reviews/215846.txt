I used half of the ground beef and half of the sausage and about 1.5 cups of mozzarella/mixed Italian cheese and a total of 32 ounces of sauce (Ragu light tomato and basil).

This recipe is so easy and adaptable to everyone's tastes.  I only used beef instead of the beef/sausage combination and also omitted the mushrooms.  I also used a different pasta sauce, and I think just about any kind would work in this recipe. This is a favorite of my kids' and of mine because it is simple, quick, and the whole family loves it!

Fantastic!!  All I changed was to reduce the amount of cheese (not a big cheese fan), but other than that I followed the recipe to the letter and it is wonderful!  I'm very much a novice in the kitchen and even so, it turned out great!

Make this with 2 sweet and 2 hot Italian sausages that you cook and break up into small pieces.  Use 1 lb. of rigatoini.  Mix together the sausage, rigatoni, 2 cups marinara and add 2 medium size ripe tomatoes, diced plus about 1 tsp. of oregano and 1/2 tsp. hot red-pepper flakes plus 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves coarsely torn plus 12 oz. of mozzarella.  Toss well and add extra mozzarella to the top and bake until cheese is melted about 20 minutes. KC*

I tend to only review recipes if they're real standouts (or stinkers). This was delicious!! And it made sooo much. I have a casserole dish that's bigger than 9x13 so I guess maybe a 10x15, that's the dish I put the pasta mixture into and it filled it right up to the rim! I didn't want it to run over while baking so I scooped some out to go into a 8x8 dish. The changes I made were I used two 240z jars of sauce and one of them was marinara-and that was plenty and I do not like pasta dishes on the dry side. Whenever I see a pasta recipe I immediately think "onion and garlic" so I diced up an onion and minced several garlic cloves into the meat mix. I also used more mozzarella (2 1lb blocks) and I put it throughout the pasta and on top.  And I totally forgot the mushrooms! Which is fine w/ me, b/c it gives me a reason to make this again soon! And when I do make it I'll add 2 cans of mushrooms and a can of diced tomatoes.  This is a great recipe b/c it's easy, absolutely delicious and makes a LOT.

This is easier to make and tastes better than lasagna in my opinion. I omitted the ground beef, used 1 lb of ground hot Italian sausage, half a lb of rigatoni pasta, 4 oz canned chunky portabella mushrooms, crushed my own 28 oz can of roma tomatoes, 8 oz packaged Italian mozzarella cheese mix, and covered the whole thing in spicy pepperoni. A dash of Italian seasoning and a touch of garlic powder in the sauce blended nicely with the flavors as well. This was perfect for my sweetie and I with some leftovers to spare. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for this recipe!

The recipe turned out quite good an easy lasagna type meal. I added diced tomatoes for a little extra zing.
