3 out of 4 of my kid's liked these. We used them to make bean burrito's. By themselves they need something more to flavor but when paired with something (like in the burritos) they were ok. They were a little on the dry side also but I drained and rinsed my beans since the recipe did not specify if they needed to be drained or not.

I prefer the taste of refried beans that use bacon grease or lard, but these aren't bad and are certainly healthier.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of chopped onion with the garlic to give a bit more flavour.

As I prepared this tonight I was thinking our enchiladas would end up served with just rice. I wasn't hopeful about them at all. First, I meant to add some bacon - and forgot. I figured this was now going to be hopelessly non-flavorful without it.  I did add half a tomato (peeled, seeded and chopped) I needed to put to good use and that proved to be a nice addition. After I mixed this up I gave it a taste and thought it had too predominant a taste of cumin. To top that off, the beans were soupy. But I kept simmering and stirring, reminding myself that the beans I get in Mexican restaurants are sometimes kind of soupy! They did thicken up after 10-15 minutes of simmering, and Hubs remarked that they were pretty "D" good.  And I didn't even miss the bacon!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I included the liquid from both cans of beans.  The flavor was great. Only problem was that I did not mash up the beans all the way and my family thought they were a bit chunky.  This recipe fed my family of 5 with one scoop for leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe, definately a make again.

I tried this recipe, minus the lime juice, no one in my family liked them. (they're spoiled, because I cook my own beans), but I was out of homemade beans, so I decided to try canned beans, big mistake.Oh well, live n learn!....P.S.when I make refried beans, I also use a little bacon grease, delicious!

I don't eat the ones in the can...they are nasty sooooooooo wasn't sure if I wanted to try this or not, but needed some type of veggie.  My hubby and I thought they were  delicious.  I didn't drain them and didn't put any lime juice on them because we don't like the flavor of lime.  We like them a bit on the soupy side and that is how they turned out.  For the amount of work they took, I should have given them a 5.  Next time I just might put cheese or sour cream on them.

Very good! Was searching for a quick recipe after I found I was out of canned refried beans. I halved the recipe, and DID use the liquid from the can (I used black beans, which were great). There wouldn't have been enough liquid otherwise. I guessed on the other measurements, and mashed them a bit, and they tasted great! Didn't seem to take the full time, and the black beans were a good change. Will definitely make this again!

Just whipped this up and added paprika, red pepper flakes, taco sauce, garlic powder, pepper, and 2 tsp of ranch seasoning (gives it a sour cream tang) and it became an awesome dip for corn chips!!

I had prepped black beans in my crock pot, and was afraid they wouldn't be soft enough- but came out just right.

I used this a base recipe but I don't think it was too far from the original so I thought it would be okay to review it. I used all organic ingredients and it's much cheaper to make these than to buy canned organic refried beans.  I used one can of pinto beans and one can of black beans (both undrained) because I like the combination.  I used lard instead of oil and sauteed a quarter cup diced onion and 1/2 of a 4 oz jar of homemade diced chilis in it (along with the garlic). If I used oil, I would use olive oil instead of canola because of the issues with conventional canola (GMOs and pesticides).  I thought 1 tsp cumin would have been too much so I used 1/2 tsp. I also cut the chili powder to 1/2 tsp because I was using diced hot peppers.  I added 1/2 tsp Mexican seasoning (from Mountain Rose Herbs) and a few shakes of onion powder and garlic powder.  I didn't use lime b/c I don't keep it on hand. I would use it if I had it.  I added some fresh-ground black pepper, but that was totally unnecessary as these beans turned out pretty spicy.  It bites in the back of the throat.  Lol.  I pulsed it with my stick blender after the beans had simmered for 5 minutes (with the lid on), and kept it a little chunky.  I then simmered for about 10-15 minutes (stirring often) and turned the heat off when they still looked a bit soupy because I know that hot refried beans thicken up when cooled.  I would definitely recommend this recipe over canned refried beans for the cost factor.

first off, OH MY I won't be using canned anymore! I tweaked just a little, but stuck to this basic recipe. With oil & garlic I added onion bullion and some onion flakes ( also used pre-minced garlic instead of clove)I didn't have time to soak beans so I used a can of pintos and a can of small red beans. Also added a little powdered red pepper, about 1/2 tsp to this recipe. Even got the thumbs up from my husband!! YUM!!!!!

These are super easy and full of flavor.I usually use canned refried beans with no fat.  However, they are terribly bland and taste nothing like restaurant quality. Regarding the draining of the canned pintos, I drained one can and used the liquid from the other can.  The beans seemed a little soupy at first, but the liquid got cooked out after simmering 5-7 minutes and the beans were perfect. You can always reserve some of the bean liquid and add it back if they become too dry.  The lime juice helps with this as well. I might cut back on the garlic next time, but other than that, these are very good.  The oil brings out the flavor of the pintos.  I used them on tostadas.

These were awesome, everyone thought they were delicious and wanted to bring some home from the Mexican themed party we had. One friend said I would put the Mexican restaurants out of business lol. I made mine a day before the party so I just had to heat them up. Maybe that helped the flavors meld together more too. I would definitely recommend making these, and they were super easy too. I'm going to be making these often. Although, I didn't really add all the lime it called for, now that think about it. I will next time and see how the taste differs.

Perfect when you don't have all day...I added a healthy squirt of Sriracha to some ketchup, mixed it with some chicken stock and let it cook down an extra five minutes....best we've had in awhile on tortillas with steak. Yum!

I thought this was great.  It was quick and easy, as advertized, and everyone loved it. Couple things:  I did pour in the liquid from the beans liked others recommended and that is the right thing to do.   Also, chopped a small onion and sauted it in the oil before adding the garlic.  And, finally, I used a national brand of pinto beans that included jalapeno.  Muy bueno!

Delicious and simple!  I drained one can of beans and left the liquid in the other.  I boiled down some of the liquid.  Perfect consistency and moistness.  The lime juice enhanced all the flavors!  This will be my go-to refried bean recipe!

Oh so yummy and oh so easy and such simple ingredients.  Made it exactly as  recipe reads.  Dumped just the top portion of liquid from cans of beans and then used the remainder  in cooking.  Lime juice makes it so delicious.  Better than restaurant refried beans.  This will definitely be a repeat dish.  MMMMM

I made these last night. Since I am the type that will not "soak beans overnight" kind-of-process - this was ten times better than buying canned refried beans. As others have stated, I will never buy a canned refried bean product again. This is the perfect answer to being easy, quick and flavorful-with a homemade taste versus a canned taste!

I made these beans last night and they were perfect!

I made the recipe as written with one exception - I simmered the beans for about 10 minutes after they were mashed to cook off some of the liquid just a little bit.

I wasn't entirely sure about using both cans, undrained, but glad I did. They were delicious and the perfect addition to our chicken tacos. 

If you prefer your beans on the thicker side, reserve a can of liquid and add it in to your desired thickness once mashed.

Definitely making this again.

Who knew making refried beans could be so easy?  In Canada we have weird can sizes, so I used one 540ml can of Pinto Beans.  I sauteed 3 cloves of chopped garlic in a pan with olive oil and added about 1/4 chopped onion.  I added the beans and their liquid, sprinkled in some salt, cumin, and chili powder- and put a lid on it for about 5 mins.  I'm picky with texture so I dumped all the contents in my food processor to make sure they were smooth and combined with the liquid.  These were delicious, great texture and flavor- and my kids liked them.  At 88 cents for a big can of pintos (compared to $3 for a small can of refried beans) you can't beat the price either

This is a good basic recipe for refried beans. It can easily be modified to suit your own taste buds. I added a little vegetable broth, smoked paprika, and onion powder, threw everything into my Vitamix and blended until creamy. It went well with my "Chipotle"-inspired Southwest salad and was way better than the store bought stuff. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand and try different variations.

I make homemade beans but I also use canned beans.   Here's  a simple ingredient:    Bacon fat.    I don't use lime or chili powder.   I make my own adobo spice mix:  Cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and Ground Mexican oregano..   For one can and I use a tablespoon and a half of bacon fat.   You can Add a small wedge of diced onion and adobo spice mix.  Drain some of the liquid and reserve it just in case you need more.   Heat bacon fat then pour in beans.   Now fry those beans.  The liquid will turn a milky color.  You can add some tomato sauce Or green chili if you like.    ENjoy your beans.   If you add to much liquicd just simmer a little longer.  Now you can add salt if needed.   Remember the beans will thicken as they cool.  Buen Provecho!

I made this but drained the beans, measured out 4 cups of cooked beans & filled the cup to the brim with water (filling the gaps between the beans). I boiled it for a bit to let the water evaporate which added an extra 10 min to the cooking time. I also used 2 t pre-minced garlic instead of fresh. I mixed it all up with my immersion blender. It came out great- until I added the lime. This tasted much better without it. Otherwise this would be a 5 star recipe.

I didn't have pinto beans so I used black beans. Better than canned re fried beans and takes the same amount of time to cook!  I also used coconut oil. Might try them with bacon grease for extra flavor.

It came out great and I don't like beans!  I thought bacon drippings would add a nice smoky flavor so I substituted the bacon drippings for the oil and the flavor it imparted was culinary excellence!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe. I often times add more spice because I like spicy food, but it is super easy to make and very delicious! I do however, leave out the cumin because I really hate the taste of cumin in general.

It was good but, the incorporation of seasoning and lime just reminded me how American white wash dishes that are typically simple. Over all I enjoyed it but I think I’m just gonna stick to what I know

Very good!  Although I did change things a bit!  Didn't have pinto beans, used great northern.  Drained some of the liquid off, but not all!  Only other thing I did was eliminate the salt, added 1/2 chopped onion, add 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper because we really like more heat!  Great recipe though...so much better than the gross ones in the stores!!

Easy and delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I did not rinse the beans and I used some of the liquid in the canned beans to get the consistency I wanted.  I will not buy canned refried beans again.

I didn't have limes or lime juice so I omitted it.  I only had 1 can of beans so I cut the recipe in half, except for the garlic (we love garlic!)  This is definitely a keeper.

Easy. I cut the recipe in half, used bacon grease, and added chopped onions. Kept most of the "juice" from the can of beans (used kidney as it was all I had). Also added a little coriander to compliment the cumin and a hefty teaspoon of butter after the bean were mashed.

I have made it several times with the pinto beans and the nothern beans. I prefer the pinto beans and instead of using canned I used the fresh pinto beans. It turned delicious and creamy. I' m going to make it my favorite with all my taco and burrito cooking.

Good recipe for in a pinch when you need to make refried beans, but it was on the bland side. Definitely needs more seasoning if you will be serving as a side dish instead of on tostada or inside tacos or burritos, where one won't notice lack of flavor. I used black beans instead of pinto. I drained the beans as recipe doesn't indicate to drain or not drain. Added drained beans after cooking/smashing the garlic and 1/4 cup chicken broth. Continued to follow recipe as written. If after mashing it seems to get to dry, just add a little more broth and stir to combine. Next time I would add some diced green chilis or salsa, and maybe an extra 1/2-1 tsp of cumin or chili powder. Will make this recipe again in a pinch, but with some alterations. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Quick and easy, absolutely. A bit on the bland side, though. I used them as a filling for enchiladas and they were good, but on their own we thought they needed something more.  At first, they were soupy even though I had drained them before cooking. As they sat and cooled, they thickened. Thank you for the recipe

Thisis an easy and great tasting recipe. I only had black beans on hand so I used them and they were great. I did add some minced onions and cumin. These refried beans are so much better than canned. I will definitely be making these again.

I've made this recipe endless times now. I've used canned black beans and canned pinto beans. I've also tried with my own beans I soaked and cooked myself (both black and pinto) and turned out the same. Definitely use the water with the can or add water if you're using your own beans. So good and vegan! Our 2 year old and 9 month old eat it up too. Great in a burrito or as a side.

I found this recipe when I went in search of a quick replacement since I had no canned refried beans on hand. I only had canned black beans so I used 2 cans of those but only about 1/2 the liquid. I substituted the bacon grease for the oil and added about 1/2 onion, chopped to the pan with the garlic. In addition to the spices in the recipe, I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne. I didn't have any limes, so i used about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. Used the immersion blender and left them chunky. Delicious! thanks for making me a convert.

These are pretty darn good and certainly better than the canned ones.  I use a little leftover bacon grease to saute the garlic, then simmered the beans about 15 minutes to soften the skin of the beans before blending.  I used a stick blender to blend them.  Topped with a little cheddar and homemade pico de gallo.  I make these often with tacos.

What an easy and flavorful recipe. No refried beans for a recipe, and no desire to get into the car and get some, but had beans. I was amazed at the small amount of time it took, one recipe that truly met the “time it takes”! Flavor was almost intense! And it enhanced the recipe I was making so well.

As is, the recipe is OK, but is much better than canned, undoctored refried beans. I have tried this with a substitution of pork lard or bacon grease  and find both to be significantly better in flavor and texture, but also find that I have to limit the additional spices with better canned beans. I really like a version based on Goya black beans with a little lard, lime juice, adobo and cilantro.

Wow - this was easy and delicious too, I might add.  I am out of canned refried beans and wanted some for a recipe that I'm going to make in a day or so.  But I did have a package of dry pinto beans so I decided to make my own refried beans.  I used this recipe as a base, since I started with dry beans and as I had some lard, I wanted to try it the "authentic" way, so used lard to fry them.  What I basically used this recipe for was the spices (including a bit of lime juice) and the proportions. These refried beans are delicious -- and my 1 pound bag of dried pinto beans made the generous equivalent of 3 cans of refried beans and tasted very good.  And the price is so much less.  Granted, it may not always be possible to take the time to cook dried beans first, but I expect using canned pinto beans (or black beans, kidney beans or whatever beans you prefer) to make these will still save a lot of money and yield enough to freeze for another time.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Very good. I fried up some bacon first and used the fat instead of canola oil. Also added chicken broth to the beans because I rinsed and drained them before adding to the pot.

I used bacon grease as others suggested. I left the broth in the pinto beans and let them cook down, smashing them with the back of my wooden spoon. I forgot to add the lime juice but we loved them anyway!  I will make again whenever I want refried beans.

Made homemade pinto beans and used fresh garlic to make these creamy, perfectly spiced refried beans.  So good, I will never buy another can again.

They were very tasty, but I added some water to mine since the mixture was too dry.

First time making beans, not a bad recipe but I felt like the refried beans turned out kinda dry. It was easy enough to make though.

This turned out delicious. I was looking for new flavor combinations for my weekly bean wraps and this was a perfect start. I added onions, increased the cumin and lime juice, and added a dash of cinnamon. I dis not drain my beans to allow more liquid and added and some farro. Served  the beans on flour street taco wraps with avocado slices, black olives, and romaine lettuce. They were delicious.

Really good base, I omitted the lime juice, used black beans (all I had) and I added finely diced onion and sautéed on low until tender then adding the garlic and half of a diced jalapeno. For extra flavor, I added about a teaspoon each of oregano and chipotle pepper. I also reserved the can liquid and added only what was needed because I prefer to add my own salt to taste, plus I threw in a little bit of chicken broth.

This is a good quick recipe, especially if you use crushed garlic from a jar like me :) and the only tweak to the recipe - I would suggest is to add a line, saying "season to taste"

These beans were delicious! I did use butter instead of oil (did not have canola on hand). I also used 1 can of pinto and 1 can of black beans, and kept most of the liquid. I partially mashed them  with a potato masher. I will make these again; thank you!

I sauted some fine diced onion with the garlic and bloomed the spices in that.  I did cook my canned beans in chicken stock to soften them a little.  Then I added them to the saute and added some liquid from prior cooking of the beans and mashed.   I did use bacon grease instead.  I think they came out very good.  Handy recipe to have on had.

I didn’t have pinto beans, so I used a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans. Since these are not necessarily traditional beans to use for this, I did add a bit of extra flavor by including a packet of onion soup mix and let it simmer for a bit before I added the other spices to it. But man, this was delicious and so easy! This will definitely be added to our rotation. Thank you so much!

I made these beans and they were great! I made half the recipe and used 1 teaspoon minced garlic, sautéing lightly, for like 1 minute. I didn’t drain the beans, I just dumped them by themselves with 1/2 teaspoon each of salt, cumin and chili powder. They are very flavorful and perfect for my family members because it is not spicy. 5 minutes was enough to meld all flavors. They mashed beautifully and thickened in their own. I won’t be buying refried beans anymore.

This was a very easy recipe and with a few tweaks got some superb flavor out of it. Per others suggestions I used bacon grease for the oil and sweated a halt cup diced onions with the garlic. I also doubled the cumin and chili powder. The texture was good, but I think next time I'll only leave liquid in one can of beans instead of both.

After trying 30 minute pinto beans in our new Quick Cooker, we decided to make refried beans from them.  No cooking for us!  We drained the beans, added the seasoning, doubling the cumin and  lime juice, with the addition of Southwestern Seasoning that I had on hand.  Delicious!  I'm sorry for the changes, as I feel that its really not the same recipe, but this became a great basis for something with a little more flavor that we prefer.

I've made these she the only thing I add to them is a bit of butter of bacon grease, pickling juice from the can of jalapenos that's always in the fridge and add cheese once heated. perfection! the house from the jalapenos gives it a needed kick.

This recipe does what it says on the tin: quick and easy. As written, the result was more than acceptable.

Keep in mind liquid from the can when figuring the final consistency. You may need to drain one or both cans, or let the excess liquid cook off if you want something thicker.

Was very good, however my family thought it lacked in flavor. Texture was great, only drained some of the juice from one can as I was afraid beans would be too runny. Will make again, but maybe next time add more of the seasonings.

I’ve made this recipe lots of times. The spices are perfect. I use water instead of oil to make them fat free. I like it better with real cloves of garlic, but I’ve used 1 tsp of granulated garlic in a pinch with good results. I add 1 tsp onion powder and viola perfection. I use beans I cook from dried, but I’m sure it would be good with canned too. 

To make this recipe even quicker, I don’t smash anything. The spices are right. The only difference is the presentation.

I recently moved to Japan and I've been trying my damnedest to try to recreate my favorite foods with ingredients I can find here (and I. in a pretty rural area to boot). So far it's been pretty hot or miss so I was sceptical this would come out at all like what I'm used to, especially since I haven't been able to source any pinto beans around me. I tried this recipe on a whim with some borlotti beans that I found at a foreign goods store and I must say, I'm impressed with how it came out.

The instructions didn’t say to drain or not and I drained this before reading comments, so my version includes draining the beans, adding onion powder and smoked paprika. I measured the garlic and lime juice with my heart. These were delicious!

I only had red and white kidney beans. I also had a few strips of bacon that I added, primarily just to use it up.  And at the last minute I added about a tsp of red chili flakes.  I love that little bit of lime that hints around on the taste-buds.  I might just eat it all before it makes it to the dip I was planning on making.  Will make this over and over again.

I made this using leftover bean soup, minus the soup juice, and it turned out terrific.  Much better than the canned stuff you buy in the store.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent & easy. I like it!  I skipped the lime, added some shredded chedar on top. Put finished beans in a warm oven to hold temp until the fajitas were ready to serve. They were a hit!

First time I made this I had run out of the canned refried beans.  Took a chance, and this was good!  Tonight, I didn't have pinto beans or refried beans.  I used a can of mild chili beans (which are pintos).  Drained them, mashed them, then added the spices according to the recipe.  Again, it was good!  Thank you for a very versatile recipe!

This was not good, very bland.  It's really annoying when people rate a recipe as positive, and I waste my time and money.   I decided to have a Mexican feast for Christmas this year and tried this recipe in advance to be sure it was decent.   It was not.

I used canned refried beans and doctored them up with this recipe. I think it's the lime juice that helped the most. Plain canned refried beans are terrible!

These were SO much better than I expected them to be! I halved the recipe and skipped the oil/garlic part because I used  squeeze-bottle garlic. Also, you don't drain the beans. I let them simmer about 12 min to thicken up. Had with Enchiladas Suizas from this site. Why buy the store stuff when easy recipes like this are even better!!!

I used black beans, doubled the spices, added onion to the garlic, then some oregano.  Those little beans like to escape the masher!  Very tasty with my roasted veggie tacos.

I had a big pot of pinto beans left over and wanted refried beans.  I just made this.  It's very good, although not great.  Not enough flavor for me, but it's so easy, I'll probably make it again but add my own spices.

Followed the recipe closely, except I cooked dry Pinto beans in the pressure cooker for about 30 minutes.  

Extraordinarily Flavor!  I can't see eating canned re-fried beans ever again.

I tasted them before I added my touches to the dish. My family likes sharp cheddar on top of their refried ., also I added a half cup of soft, cooked rice prepared in chicken broth before mashing them. I served cooked pippian sauce and another sauce dish of fine diced fresh tomatoes (no seeds) along side of the refrieds, but not in the dish.  My family have definite likes and dislikes in their meals.  The dish was received well and I personally liked it very much.
Thank you for sharing  the Easy Refried Beans recipe. 
P.S. The rice was a leftover from last night's dinner  and it also went well with the pintos.

5.7.18  I typically have refried beans in the freezer, but ran out, so I thought I’d give this this one a shot.  The recipe doesn’t tell you whether or not to drain the beans, but I did, and reserved the liquid.  Didn’t use all of it, but I did add some to reach the consistency that we like.  I tasted and added a good sprinkle of garlic powder (will add more fresh garlic in the future) and several good shakes of sriracha.  It certainly doesn’t get much easier than this.  In a pinch, I always have a can of pintos on hand, so I suspect this won’t be the last time I make this.

I did not drain the beans and had a total runny mess.  I would suggest only draining one can of beans.  The flavor was good though.

Nice, simple recipe.  I used black beans and it worked just the same. I also used already minced garlic, probably lost some flavor for a sophisticated palette, but it was fine for my family. I also added a little unsweetened almond milk to make it a little creamier. I did drain my can, so maybe i wouldn't have needed to add the milk if I didn't drain my beans, but the recipe doesn't specify. I .t needed some salty seasoning, so I added a dash of Adobo seasoning.

I used 2 cans of cannellini beans was all I had on hand. Tastes real good and easy to make. I ended up blending in my food processor. Will make again. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I used slightly more garlic.  Just make sure to cook it pretty thoroughly or it tastes too garlicky (yes, that's actually possible).    I also added an equal amount of finely-chopped onions about two minutes before mashing the garlic.  I also slightly increased the lime juice.  They were a little soupy, so I plan to drain one can of beans next time.  Quite good!

These. Burritos. Were. The bomb. I'm not spoiled on special magical homegrown beans, I enjoy a taco bell, and have hungry friends. I didn't have any refried beans which led me to this recipe, and I didn't have any pinto beans either! I used a mix of red kidney beans and some white beans... I used extra cumin and salted to taste as per required. I DID cook them in their own juice and then just reduce them for a long time, they were just so good!!! Recommend.

I found this recipe at firs to be a little lackluster. 3.5/5 stars. So I made some changes that really made it perfect. First double the recipe. Instead of using 4 cans of pinto beans you can add some flavor by using 2 cans pinto 2 cans black beans. This helps out the flavor a lot. Go along with the cooking process until you get to the point where you have to add the lime. Instead of adding an entire lime (doubled recipe), as I found it quite the overpowering flavor, I added 1/8th of a large lemon. And there you go. How to make a already good recipe into a great one.

Perfect!  Like others have said, will never buy canned again. I only had one can of pinto beans and used all liquid from can and consistency was perfect.  Didn’t bother with lime. Thanks for sharing!

They needed more flavor so I used a chili powder mix from some ramen I had laying around which spiced it up nicely. It was also slightly dry, next time I'll try adding more oil.

LOVE THESE!!! These are my "go-to" refried beans - I triple and quadruple the recipe and make it for crowds and everyone goes nuts for them. Super fast, easy, and TASTY!!!

Note: These can be VERY dry - if you aren't going to eat them immediately you MUST add moisture. I use chicken or beef stock and just add it until they are the consistency I want.

This recipe worked very well for me.  One of the big reasons it was so successful is because I used canned Pintos a la Diabola - they were already seasoned and spicy.

Delicious!  I added rice bran oil.  I never measure oil, but it was about another tablespoon.  It was for a recipe that called for refried beans, and the recipe included more wet things like avocadoes, tomatoes, more lime juice, and sour cream, among other things, so it didn't matter that mine looked a bit drier than your picture.  Still, ALONE, these beans were delicious.  Will definitely make them again!  Thanks!

Other than throwing a few peppers in with the garlic, I followed the recipe. Very good. I've tried several different ones but this is just what I was looking for. Simple and very tasty, especially after it's been in the fridge for a few hours. I use it as refried beans and also bean dip with chips. Thanks much!

I was fixing Mexican tonight  and my pantry was bare when it came to refried beans I usually buy. Came here and found this presto instant recipe and it was fantastic !! I will never buy canned refried beans again (sorry, Old El Paso). Made recipe as listed. The only thing I added was about 1/2 tsp onion powder. Drained just a small amt of the liquid from the pinto beans and added rest--consistency was perfect. And they are low-fat too, b/c I could control amount of oil I used.   I used my immersion blender and it made them silky, but I was able to leave a few beans just chopped to add a bit of texture we like.  It literally took me about 8 minutes start to finish. Outstanding !! Thanks for the recipe :)

I am clearly not a refried beans connoisseur  since I don't mind the canned ones, but these are much tastier. I used black beans and bacon grease instead of oil. Two out of three kids ate them and the third one rejects all beans, so I call that success!

So I took the basic bean/spice ratio then changed everything else about the recipe. I used 3 types of beans, navy, pinto and black. I added 2 diced green chilis and a diced tomato. I drained the beans and added 1 C of chicken broth. Then I cooked it all for 3hrs in a slow cooker. I would rate this bean recipe a 5* but I think I changed it to much to really acknowledge the recipe as 5*. Reserve the bean juice for if it gets too dry.

I made a half recipe.  I wanted to cut the sodium down so I really rinsed the beans well.  To make up for the lost liquid (which these really need), I added some water while cooking. I also added paprika and garlic powder as per someone else's suggestion.  Would make again.

I added in sauteed red onion, finely diced.  I pureed the mixture once it cooled and had to add in much more olive oil and lime to get it moving in my processor.  It was quite good, better than the canned variety.

I try to use whole foods so I did make the beans from scratch.... Soaked them over night, then slow cooked them with the spices.   I also used unflavored coconut oil.....The flavor is really good. I did, however, add more lime juice, chili powder and cumin because I like the extra flavor. I also used my Kitchen Aid Mixer to mash the beans which made it faster. 
This one is in my recipe box. :}

Found it dry as I drained the beans. Also the shell of the bean tastes tough. 
I added a can of chop tomatoes and some chilli flakes. Nice with cheese on top and nachos. 

Still looking for a way to soften the shell. 

Good recipe though.

No more canned refried beans in my house. This recipe works great. I've used canned and dried beans and either works great (as long as the dried beans soak overnight). Have to keep adding hot liquid til you get the texture you like and you can experiment with adding other veggies if you aren't a refried bean purist.

I made this in bulk for the filling for some chimichangas I made for my  son's birthday party. The flavors were pretty good. Other reviewers are right, it is a little bit tricky because the recipe doesn't say whether or not to drain the beans. I drained them because I am not a fan of bean slime. After I added the spices to the beans, I put the beans in a food processor (instead of smashing them) and added water until it reached the correct consistency. I added a bit more cumin and chili powder for flavor, too. Overall, it is a good recipe. The food processor worked well, too. If you decide to use a food processor, just make sure you don't over-process the beans.

Although I'm not a refried bean fan, my husband is. I made it as written and he said he prefers the canned variety.

We loved these beans.  Although the recipe does say I added half the liquid from the beans. Definitely a keeper.

I thought the recipe was delicious. I did use 30 oz of slowed cooked beans that I had cooked the night before. I drained and rinsed the beans before putting them in. The only thing I did different was that I added 1/4 - 1/2 cup of water and 1 jalepeno.

Super Simple and super delicious.  Wife and I loved it.  Cumin is where its at and considering it is very healthy I'm glad I found this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!:)
I forgot to add that I cook the beans under a pan for aprox 30 min on low heat in cast iron skillet.  Beans are super easy to smash with a potato masher afterwards.

I cooked the beans with the liquid, but drained most of the liquid prior to mashing.

Well first thing is the recipe doesn't specify to drain or not drain the beans. I drained one and not the other and the consistency is good for me. I used an immersion blender to "mash" the beans. If you feel like changing it up a little or are lacking in the pantry department you can't try the recipe with black beans too!

My mum had decided she wanted to make Mexican pizzas for dinner but we didn't have any re-fried beans, you know the canned ones, and my pa was at work. Ma was just like fine we'll make it another time but I had joined on the bandwagon and wanted her to make Mexican pizzas too, so I asked her if we had pinto beans. Long story short we did have pinto beans and I was stubborn and decided to make the re-fried beans myself.
After looking at a bunch of really complicated and time consuming recipes I came across this one. This recipe is a 7 ingredient recipe, which two of them aren't really needed unless you want to put it in your beans, that would be the lime juice and salt. I made the beans and added the salt and lime after doing everything else and it tasted no different to me. So, yeah, this is a good recipe the only thing I added was Adobo, because I put Adobo in everything haha (you don't have to do this of course).

P.s. the recipe doesn't specify it but just a heads up-when opening the can of pinto beans don't drain the liquid, you need it! You dump the whole can into that pot.

This recipe is super easy and takes less than 10 minutes to make. It was good and tasted way better than canned re-fried beans and worked perfectly for our Mexican pizzas.

Great, easy recipe.  We make tacos or enchiladas about once every week or two.  Sometimes we have a little nacho bar as a snack during a game or movie.   I've always like refried beans when we go to the local Mexican restaurants, so I wanted to have them at home and introduce them to the rest of the family.   At first I bought a popular brand of canned refried beans.   They looked terrible and tasted worse.  No one would even touch them.   So I looked up a home recipe and found this.   They are great!   The whole Family is now willing to eat these beans with their tacos or nachos.  And we have even began having bean burritos using this recipe.   I found for our taste they are even better if you add a little chopped onion to them while cooking.

I followed this recipe to the T. Except, I only used one can of beans. So, essentially, I doubled the spices, garlic and lime. Boy, was it good!  Cooking for one; when I reheated left over beans, I added salsa to moisten them. So good! Next time, I'll probably add the salsa after mashing the beans.

I was  just trying it out and I made a large batch of these beans. I did not use lime juice. I used some of the liquid of beans but poured some out. I think It still had to much liquid. But you need some liquid to boil the beans. After mashing beans I added Colby jack cheese (my secret ingredient)! And everyone loved them!! Ladies who only make beans not from the can even thought they were really good!!! Saving this recipe! Definitely add the spices but add to taste, i honestly think I added more than it says to but I kept tasting then adjusting, because I used so many beans. 3 of the largest can of beans. (And everyone ate all the beans!)

I think I'm in the minority of people who prefer canned refried beans to this recipe. I just made these for dinner (I typically wrap plain refried beans in a tortilla) and found that they were more flavorful than the cans I've been buying, I just wasn't a fan of the texture. I think you final product will be quite relative to the beans you begin with. I had a can of pinto beans (Southern Home Brand) and used them along with the liquid of the can. They're really flavorful and great when you just want refried beans and don't have any!

After making these beans, I am now ruined and will never be able to eat canned refried beans again. These are the best, in my opinion. Great flavor and very quick and easy to make. Whole family loves them, ages 3 to adult.

I specifically like Luck's pinto beans as it is a thickened.  So I knew I must use a large can I had, no draining. Not too far away from the original recipe, only using more of each seasoning.  Including using the juice from a whole lime.  I loved it. Gave me the confidence to try starting with dry pinto beans. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is quick and easy. I do add onion as one reviewer suggested. One thing I will say....I've made this many times  with regular canned pinto beans and I just dump the whole can in (undrained) and it comes out perfect. The past few  times I have used organic pintos and I think there is more liquid in the organic so if you use them, do not add all the liquid in the can, but add most and see if you need more to your liking.

I didn't make it exactly as the recipe says, but only because I am eating it (as I type) by itself and added a couple things to improve the taste as I don't typically like refried beans by themselves. I'm broke and pregnant with gestational diabetes, so I have to follow a specific diet, and beans were all I really had in the cupboard that is acceptable on my diet, lol. all I did to change it, though, was half the recipe, add a slice of american cheese, and about a tablespoon of butter, and it is remarkably delicious. I'll make this again.

Better than the canned version but still needs some more flavor.  I did as others suggested and sauteed onions with the garlic which probably helped.

I've made this twice in one week! I see that people are saying that it's too dry or too soupy, so I drained one can, and left one the way it was perfect. I have nothing to tweek about this recipe.

I didn't have Pinto Beans on hand, but I used Great Northern and those worked pretty well. Added onion for flavor, otherwise stuck to the recipe. Thanks.

I added another teaspoon of cumin AFTER the lime juice.  My son who is 13 liked it better that way.  He also added chopped onions and rice AFTER so he could make his wraps the way he likes.

It was a very quick, fast and easy recipe.  

I did think about putting the beans in the NurtiBullet vs. mashing them as that was a job but didn't.  Maybe next time.

This is quick, tasty, and nutritious. Far better than the canned glop. I added a bit of chopped onion and cut back a touch on the chili powder. I reserved a bit of the  bean liquor from the can in case I needed it and I did not add the lime juice, but wonder if it preserves freshness or colour. Delicious in a seven layer dip.

I followed recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I didn't have refried beans but had a can of pinto beans on hand, so I made a batch of refried beans at http://allrecipes.com/recipe/quick-and-easy-refried-beans/ .  Will definitely be making this again!

Easy and delicious! I minced the garlic, then browned it. Did not mash them in the end as I liked the consistency already. Did not use lime juice.

Was craving bean dip but only had a can of pinto beans. This recipe was PERFECT!! I only slightly drained the beans, I used minced garlic from the fridge, dark chili, then totally forgot the salt, didnt have any lime juice ... but added my favorite Chile Habanero sauce to it. I used a hand masher and the consistency was perfect. I topped the beans with shredded cheddar and sour cream and hubby and I ate it ALL with Tostito Scoops.... yummmmm!! Thank YOU!!

Very simple to make, but much too dry and needing flavor. Adding onion, stock and more spices next time.

This was a decent base recipe, but I do have a few suggested changes. I followed the recipe to the tee and it wasn't great. It was a little soupy and the flavor was kind of off. Next time I will make the following changes: Only use 1/2 of the liquid in the cans, cut the lime juice in half, and cut the chili powder in half. I think those changes would make for a good refried bean recipe. Unfortunately, this recipe as it is, wasn't satisfying.

Pretty good base recipe. I had to add some garlic salt and more chili powder.  It was a little underseasoned for my taste.

Made this tonight and I will never buy refried beans again!  First of all I used black beans, but everything else was to recipe. Taste was phenomenal, texture was better than a can and my husband loved them (usually he ha no opinion on refried beans). In the U.S. We were able to buy canned refried beans whenever we wanted, the lack of availability made me seek out this recipe, I wish I would have done this years ago!!

4.5 Stars: Quick and good.  I halved the recipe and may have used a bit too much garlic, but really liked them.  Go easy on the lime.

Awesome flavor a definite go to recipe.  This recipe really added that extra umph to my tacos hubby loved it. I used black beans with the liquid I found the lime to be a tad bit bitter I tried lemon before and I think I prefer it over the lime. It could have just been my lime seeing as it was also a bit dry I just sprinkled in a little sugar just to cut the bitter tast and they turned out great. Love it !!! Thanks!

These came out very good, and very easy. I made a few changes, I used one tablespoon of bacon grease (that's all I had left in the freezer) and one tablespoon of canola oil. I left out the lime because I didn't have one. I drained one can of beans and left the liquid in one can, the texture was perfect for bean burritos, not too dry or too runny. I will absolutely do this again.

I used home canned black beans instead of pinto beans.  This recipe is delightful.  I will never purchase canned retired beans again.

I made these tonight, because I too did not have a can of refried beans.  These were fabulous.  I only had black beans, so I used those.  Also did not drain the beans.  The lime juice adds just the right flavor.

Very good!  I cut corners and started with a can of refried beans but the add-ins took them up to the next level.
