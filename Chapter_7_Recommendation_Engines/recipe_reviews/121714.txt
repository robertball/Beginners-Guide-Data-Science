I made this recipe with frozen meatballs from Costco and it turned out great!  I substituted the water with 1 cup of milk.  I put frozen meatballs in a crockpot and coated them with the soup mixture.  A few hours later, dinner was ready.  Serve by itself or with cooked egg noodles.  Will add fresh mushrooms next time for more flavor.  Thanks for sharing, Marilyn.

Very Easy and good. It tastes like an easy swedish meatballs. I just threw it all in the slow cooker for a few hours and added some frozen peas the last hour.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I changed the recipe to include the ingredients I had on hand.  I used lean ground turkey in place of the beef and Italian bread crumbs. They had great flavor and smelled amazing while cooking -- and my toddler ate them right up! This is a keeper.

I don't know why more people hasn't tried this recipe.  It was a great last minute meal option.  I made the meatballs with turkey and baked them.   I made the sauce with a couple of  changes.  I used skim milk instead of water and stired in some low fat sour cream at the end.  This was really good over egg noodles and a side salad.  Thanks for the post.

This was a very tasty and easy recipe.  My mil makes something similar to this, so it pleased my husband.  I omitted the basil and fresh parsley because the only bread crumbs I had on hand were Italian seasoned.  I'm glad I did, because my husband noticed the seasoning from the bread crumbs that his mom doesn't put in.  I thought it turned out great and this will be the recipe I use from now on.

This was a great last minute dinner recipe!! I mixed the soup and water together before pouring on top and used a little extra water so all of my meatballs would be covered.  I served over rice and my kids and husband all approved.  We will definitely use this recipe again!!

For a different flavor, substitute cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom.  Serve over noodles.  Yum!
