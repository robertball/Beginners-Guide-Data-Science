i was so nervous about this brine- my husband chose the recipe, and when it was hot it smelled AWFUL! i let it cool, and it smelled a little better, but just a little. i made just a turkey breast (though it was huge!), so i brined it about 12 hrs, then roasted it with butter and maple syrup glaze (martha stewart has a good recipe). my husband's fave holiday is thanksgiving- he took me aside to say it was by far the best turkey he's ever had. not bad for the vegetarian chef!

This is a great brine, the soy sauce gives the turkey a lovely rich color and the turkey was very juicy. I put the garlic cloves in the cavity for cooking and people were fighting for them! For smaller birds, use a shorter time in the brine to keep it from being too salty.

I rated this recipe last year about this time and still love it, I just wanted to add to the review. This year I actually had a nice big 5 gallon bucket from Lowes with a lid to Brine it in for two whole days before putting it in my new convection oven.  I made a twenty pound turkey.  I used some of the brine to baste the turkey, but not much about a cup.  I substituted the brown sugar for a brown sugar I made with stevia instead, so basically molasses and stevia in the raw. I did double the recipe though since I needed more than original recipe called for with such a large turkey.  This Brine is super delicious though.  For those of you using a brine for the first time, make sure you rinse the brine off before cooking/baking otherwise the salt will overwhelm you.

This will be the brine that I use from now on.  It was excellent.  I put it together the Tuesday night before Thanksgiving so that it could chill over night and I could start brining the turkey on Wednesday.  I did a taste test after it was simmering for several minutes and decided to up the maple syrup to 2 cups instead of 1 because I wanted more of a maple flavor.  With this addition, it was perfect for my taste.  The finished turkey turned out neither too sweet nor too salty and so moist.  I cooked a small turkey - just under 11 lbs. and the amount of brine this reciped yielded was perfect for that.  You might want to consider doubling the recipe if you are doing a large turkey.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Best brine ever! I've made turkey with this brine several times and now I've started adding a couple tablespoons of liquid smoke and a couple teaspoons maple flavor extract to kick it up a few notches.  Bake it with the maple glazed turkey recipe from this site and I have had so many people say that it's the best turkey they've ever had. I even have people offer to pay me to make their turkey for them! I quadruple the recipe and brine 2 birds at a time in a cooler checking the ice.

This is my favorite and only way I will roast a turkey or chicken now!  It leaves the meat so moist!  I know it may have a bad smell but it will make the best Thanksgiving Bird you have ever had!  The very first time I ever roasted a bird I used this recipe and everyone raved about how amazing it was and how well I did!  easy for cooking beginners as well!

I use this brine recipe every year for Christmas and thanksgiving turkey! My picky family loves it! It’s easy to make and makes for a delicious, moist turkey! However, I do not use sour mash whiskey, I use a Canadian whiskey. I also add a little extra whiskey and maple syrup just for extra flavor. Also, I only use 1/4 cup of sea salt.

Amazing brine, use it for turkey and whole chickens. I usually don't have the whisky around so I've made it without- very delicious and doesn't smell terrible when you make it. ;)

Favorite way to do the turkey and also pork tenderloin! i've used this brine for 3 turkey dinners and everyone just loves  how tender and flavourful the turkey turns out! i just prep the brine in an 18Q stock pot and keep it in there for about 72 hrs in the fridge. I've roasted it  twice in an electric turkey roaster which makes for quicker roasting time!  I did a 15lb turkey, patted it dry and pushed fresh sage leaves under the skin and rubbed unsalted butter all over the turkey. Then start roasting at 450 degrees for 10/- 15 mins and turn down temperature to 325 degrees . According to a turkey site, a 15lb turkey (stuffed) turkey would take 4h 18min but with the turkey roaster it was ready in 3H 25min! Turned off roaster and let it rest in there for an hour before carving.

So incredibly good, I can't believe I haven't tried it before! The only change I'll make later is to add maple concentrate when making turkey, and maybe put some apple slices in the cavity for more fruity flavor.  That said, it was the moistest turkey I've ever eaten, and I WILL make it again - often!

I had never brined a turkey prior to trying this recipe. I used to inject the bird with marinade or herbed butter to regulate the moisture. No longer. I could not believe the difference brining made in producing such a moist, flavourful turkey.

I have made this brine for my Thanksgiving Turkey since 2014. My brother and I competed last year - he smoked his turkey and I did my brine for 48 hours. I won! I don’t use the whiskey, so I can say it tastes fabulous even without it! The key is to plan ahead - make the brine the weekend before Thanksgiving so it has time to cool. Then soak your turkey in it for at minimum 24 hours. I always add a cup of the brine to the bottom of the roasting pan.

My whole family agrees... the Thanksgiving turkeys I've brined using this recipe have been the BEST anyone has ever had!  Juicy and delicious!!  

I must admit, I had my doubts the first time I combined all of the ingredients.  The "unique" smell of the brine had me questioning what local restaurants were going to be open... just in case LOL.

I am happy to say that my senses were deceived and a new tradition was born.  I hope it's one that will carry on for generations :)

Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I’ve been making this brine for years now. I make a few changes, but I stick pretty close to this recipe. I don’t add the soy sauce because I place a basket weave of bacon over the top of the turkey half way through the smoking process. I use Jameson whiskey and it give a nice flavor. As I stated above, I smoke the turkey for about 5 hours, basking it orange juice. Has been a hit every year and I’ve had to buy bigger turkeys every year so I can have some leftovers.

i made this 2 years in a row. I did add lemon and cinnamon sticks to this adds a little flavor. Juicy and moist use a oil less fryer to cook the turkey in. First year did a 28 pond bird, this year doing a 14 pound bird. Last year everyone who tasted it said its the best turkey they have ever had

It was delicious. You could really taste the maple syrup. The turkey was very moist. I made the brine on Tuesday night and cooled over night. I put the turkey in a home depot bucket with the brine on Wednesday morning and let soakk for about 24 hours. I highly reccomend this.

We have made this brine 2x, once with light brown sugar(because I didn't have dark brown sugar) we left the turkey in for 2 days and the put the turkey on the grill with indirect heat for 2 1/2 hours. 
Each time I have loved the white meat and usually I won't touch it. The flavors and how moist it is amazing. My whole family loved it!

This was excellent. It left the turkey moist and delicious. None of us could actually taste the ingredients, I'd hoped that more of the maple bourbon might have come through. But we all noted that it was one of the tastiest birds we've had in years. I will certainly use it again.

Wasn’t impressed at all. Too much sugar caused the turkey skin to burn. And the flavor of the meat wasn’t “maple”. In fact, it wasn’t much of anything beyond normal turkey (almost as though I hadn’t even brined. Not at all worth the time/money.

This is hands down the best brine I've used for my Thanksgiving turkey. Be forewarned, the prep is nearly unbearable. As soon as the bourbon hits the brine, your house will smell like the aftermath of a frat party. My family nearly revolted. But the taste is incredible. I smoked my turkey over cherry wood, and the result was beyond a doubt the best Thanksgiving main course anyone in the family had ever had. I prepared my brine a day ahead, to let all the flavors marry, and brined the turkey for about thirteen hours. The flavor was pronounced without being overpowering, and the smoke was a perfect accompaniment. As another commented suggested, place the garlic bulbs and thyme in the cavity while cooking. I will be using this brine again.

This is the  Best Brine ever!!  This is my go to recipe for turkey and chicken.  We usually let soak for 24-48 hrs!  Then smoke away.  My hubby will rinse off bird before smoking though.  It’s a smidge salty if you don’t rinse.   I sometimes add more maple syrup if I want it a little bit sweeter.  I recommend trying this!

This brine wins over the hearts of my family every year!  I would suggest using Jim Beam Maple whiskey in lieu of sour mash/inexpensive.  The flavor this whiskey adds is phenomenal, not to mention tastes delicious cold by itself :). Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe to the T. Everybody loved it. I also was a little nervous prior to making it. But it ended up being a hit. I am currently making it again for New Year's Day. Can't wait. My sister-in-law also asked for the recipe and she made it and it was also a hit. Highly recommend

Made this for Thanksgiving two years in a row. Came out juicy and tender. I did not include the garlic and it had plenty of flavor..

I have made this brine 3 times now. Over the years I have tried many brines but this one is now my favorite. The favors  penetrate the meat nicely.

Wow! The only change was using only 1/2 a cup of whiskey. I made a turkey breast for Thanksgiving and used this brine overnight.  I received several comments that it was the best turkey they'd ever had and I have to agree.  Even the sandwiches the next day were super juicy. I believe Thanksgiving dinner is way to much fuss for the payoff, but if I ever have to cook another turkey I'll be using this again because it was the best part of the meal.

I like the idea of brining, though I have never tried it; living on a farm and having two children that needed diversionary contributory activity we had syringes available and used them to inject our turkeys with various beverages.  French Columbard white wine by Franzia was one o out favorites but is no longer available in 5l box.  Blitz Weinhard's Yakima Red beer was another well liked flavoring.  The thought of brining had never crossed our minds.  It will be tried at some time, thanks for the idea.

I usually dry brine my turkeys but this year for Thanksgiving I wanted to attempt something different and let me just saw, wow. Amazing flavour throughout the entire bird! My only variance is that I added some maple extract, just to really let the maple flavour shine.

I have been wanting to try this recipe as brining is the way to go for roast turkey.  This was absolutely excellent and kept the turkey extra moist despite me slightly over cooking. Didn't change a thing and followed it exactly unlike many brine recipes. This recipe is a true keeper!

Tried it for thanksgiving 2014. Added 2 oranges and 2 lemons quartered. It was great. Best turkey ever. Not only very juicy and flavorful, but looked fantastic. The brine smells terrible but sure was yummy.

Wowser!!  A hit.  Best thing about it is the terrific colouring it gives to the cooked turkey.  Looked like it was perfectly done after two hours.  Through tin foil on top to manage.  Very moist - many comments from our guests.  Should have planned better to brine longer to get full taste.

I used this brine for my Thanksgiving turkey this year and it made the most delicious bird I've ever tasted! The color was incredible, too. The maple flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked, but the bird was so tender and juicy it didn't matter. If you're going to brine, this is the way to go.
