Loved the flavor but it was a bit dry for my taste. I used pistachios instead of almonds and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Will definitely try it again, maybe sifting the flour and adding a bit more oil.

Just rated this so I could post.  Went looking for  PaneangeliÂ® Lievito Pane degli Angeli since I've never heard of it.  This is what I found for those of us without that on hand.  A possible substitute is  1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder plus 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

I was able to get a 6 cup Bundt pan (advertised as usable in an Instant Pot or oven) Which was the perfect size. A friend gave me the Italian baking powder with vanilla. I would recommend sieving this baking powder as the lumps did not dissolve!  I shared the cake with friends who quite liked it. I will try this cake again, but perhaps use regular baking powder and almond flavouring.

I agree, it was a bit dry. My lemon juice was about 3/4 fresh squeezed with a top-off of bottled juice to make the correct amount. Family enjoyed it, though! Photos are too big to show.
