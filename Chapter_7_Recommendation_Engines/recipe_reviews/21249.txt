I don't think there is enough liquid in this. I doubled the eggs and still it didn't work for me. I won't make this again.

I added a little bit of the reserved clam juice until the consistency was good.. otherwise it would have been too dry.  Not a lot of flavor.  Will try again and add some minced onions and salt and a dash of old bay seasoning.

Easy to fix.  The problem with the written recipe is there is not enough liquid, just as other reviews say.  If you reserve the clam juice when draining, you can add back in enough to make a really wet batter/dough.  My can was a little bigger than called for, but the more clams the merrier! And you need more than 2T oil.  I used 1 1/2" canola oil and fried small blobs, dropped in very quickly, until brown, then dried on a flat paper bag.  I did a test one first and found I needed to add more salt and also added a few generous shakes of Old Bay.  Finished product reminded me of when I was a kid in Rhode Island, going to Rocky Point with my family! Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012

This recipes is missing the mark all together.  It didn't have enough liquid and when the batter came together it was a horrible flop.  I do not recommend it At all

I used a packet of Bisquick Honey Butter Biscuit mix (1 cup), 2 eggs, a tablespoon more oil, and a full cup of chopped clams. They came out just great!

they are definately right. This thing really needs some liquid, it's just too dry. But apart from that I found it quite nice.
