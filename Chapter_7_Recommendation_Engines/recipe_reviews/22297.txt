OMG!!!  can I give it 6 stars?  I cut down the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and added crushed pineapple to it. Fried the chops (thick ones) to brown them, threw it all in the crockpot for a couple of hours and it was the best.  Pulled apart with a fork  and excellent flavor.  The absolute best pork chops I have ever had.

These were wonderful! They really were tender, full of flavor, and very easy to make. Based off of some reviews, here was my modified recipe:
-1/2 c soy sauce 
-3/4 c teriyaki sauce
-1.5 c pineapple juice
-2 c water
-1/2 c cornstarch (dissolved first in the water, warmed)
-1/2 tsp garlic powder

I heated up the previous ingredients in a saucepan; 
Rubbed 3 medium pork chops with ground pepper and a little minced garlic, browning each side for 3 min in a pan with oil over med;
Placed browned pork chops in a slow cooker, covering with the saucepan liquid, and cooked on high for 1.5-2 hrs.

My husband loved them (which is the ultimate test). I made these with asparagus w/ balsamic butter from this website, and it was a fantastic dinner. Thanks for the reipe!

This is a great recipe.  I read the other reviews and I too was concerned about the salt so I used low sodium soy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  I also used pineapple juice instead of water.  This gave the pork a fantastic sweet and tangy taste.  I also used the sauce to stir fry some veggies.  My husband loved it. The only mistake that I made was not making enough!!!

What am I doing wrong with this recipe?  I've made this twice because I want it to come out right.  I absolutely LOVE the taste of the sauce.  Used low-sodium terriyaki as suggested. But, my chops have come out dry and tough both times.   I'm still giving it 4 stars because the sauce is fantastic.  And my family said they like it though, despite the dryness.  Must be something I'm doing wrong??

This recipe officially wins as producing the moisted chops EVER.  I browned the chops then put all ingredients in a crockpot and cooked on low for about 4 hours... meat was soo moist ..could cut with a fork!   I also used low sodium soy sauce.   I think I could have used about half the soy/teriyaki and would have had plenty to cover the chops and cook..seemed like a lot of sauce was wasted...but overall great flavor and with some tweaking is a keeper!

I followed the earlier suggestions of using low salt soy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  Instead of the 2.5 cups of water, I used 1.5 cups of water and two 8oz cans of crushed pineapple w/ juice.  It turned out wonderful, a definate keeper!
(served with rice pilaf and green beans)

I have been making a similar recipe for 20 years and have found that covering the skillet with a lid as the chops simmer helps to keep them very moist. Just check periodically to insure that the liquid hasn't simmered away.  Hope this helps . . . .

Excellent and really easy recipe. The meat was tender and full of flavor. Cut back on the soy a little by preference and add red pepper flakes for a little kick at the end. Also using some pinapple or OJ next time sounds like "stepping it up a notch"! Five stars for taste and ease of recipe. Thanks Joan! Will cook this for my family often!

These turned out perfect. We were looking for a healthier way to cook chops other then frying them. I lightly browned the chops in a skillet along with some seasalt, pepper, oregano, and minced garlic, then poured the sauce mixture over the chops in the skillet and brought it to a boil. Once it boiled I transferred everything to a baking dish and baked at 325 for about 30 minutes with foil on top. I removed the foil and baked for another 10 minutes. They are perfect! Very flavorful and pairs great with broccoli and rice!

I've made this several times because when the kids finish their dinner it becomes a regular. Though I have learned to use low sodium soy sauce because the first time I tried it the salt was a bit overwhelming. Now it's perfect.

I followed the recipe and found the chops to be very dried out and very salty.  No one wants to see this one again in my house.

This is the best recipe for pork chops I have ever tried.  They really do melt in your mouth.  I also tried this recipe with chicken, same ingredients except chicken was used instead of pork chops.  I do not recommend this, you can't taste that you are actually eating chicken.  But I have made the recipe with the Pork Chops several times and my fiancee loves it.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Here's what I ended up doing with this recipe. I had really thick (1") chops, so I browned those in the oil, seasoned well with granulated garlic and pepper. Transfered to the crockpot. Added 1/2 cup each low sodium soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, chicken broth and pineapple juice. I also added a thinly sliced onion to the crock pot. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Delicious, fall apart pork is what we ended up eating, over rice pilaf, with mixed veggies. Thanks, Joan.

The flavor of the sauce was very good, but like some other reviewers, my meat came out dry.  I followed the recipe exactly, but used thin pork chops rather than normal ones.  I assumed that they would cook faster since they were so thin, so only simmered them for an hour rather than the full hour and 20 minutes.  I don't think the additional 20 minutes would've made a difference, though.  My only thought was that maybe I browned them too long before adding the liquid.  I'd still make them again, just not sure about how to keep them from drying out.

Decent. I made the recipe as written for two pork chops, and used half the mixture as a marinade. Marinated them for 6ish hours, then simmered in the rest of the sauce for about 45 mins. Turned out great - very tender and pretty flavorful. Thanks!

I liked this recipe. The meat was tender but a little salty. It would be excellent stir-fry meat.

Upon reading the other reviews, I decided to add a 3/4 of a 20oz can of crushed pinapple w/ the juice and only added 2/3 of the soy (low sodium) and teriyaki sauce that was called for.  I browned the pork chops and placed all ingredients in the slow cooker.  I thickened the sauce when the chops were done with a cornstarch slurry, served over brown rice and topped with the remaining pinapple left in the can, I also served with shelled soybeans.  I feel the sweetness to balance out the salty in this dish is a MUST!  Very good dish after tweaking, I fear it might be too salty otherwise.

These pork chops really do live up to their name! My husband and very fussy mother-in-law loved them. Said this was a keeper! I just made a couple of slight adjustments for our families dietary needs. I used about 1/2 the amount of the soy sauce (and used low sodium variety) due to a salt restriction, due to using less soy sauce, I doubled the teriyaki sauce. I also, substituted 1/2 the amount of water with pineapple juice. Delicious!

Overall, a great recipe, the pork chops were very tender. However, it was a bit salty, and that was using the lite ingredients. I added a little more water than was called for to cut the saltiness down a bit. My husband and kids enjoyed it. I'll be making this again. Thanks!

Very good and very easy.  Cooking time should be varied based on thickness of chops.  I used fairly thin chops and they were overcooked at 1 hour 20 minutes.  I would recommend 1 hour 20 minutes for chops over 1/2" and about an hour for chops 1/2" or less.

The flavor was good, but mine didn't get as tender as I thought they would. I would make pork chops again using this method.

I usually hate pork chops and I LOVE this recipe. My mom and I found this recipe while I was awaiting the birth of my twins. The recipe is super easy to make and everyone in the house raved about the taste. Even my super picky 18 month old gobbled them right up!

This recipe was pretty good. I did as a few others suggested and used juice in place of the water. I used orange due to an allergy to pineapple. I also put them in the crock pot on low for 4 hours. They literally fell apart. No need for a knife. I would be careful how much soy and teriyaki you use. Also make sure that both are low sodium. I used low sodium and had to add additional orange juice because it was still way too salty.

Wonderful!!! These were great! I did add the pineapple juice. Mostly because I didn't have enough soy sauce for 1/2 cup.  Hubby said they were the best he's had!

I really didn't like this recipe.  It was WAY WAY WAY too salty even after using reduced sodium soy sauce and teriyaki.  Won't make again.

Did these tonight, tried to add a picture. These were good, husband even liked. I did take the suggestions of others and added a small can of chopped pineapple, also, 2 teaspoons of brown sugar.  had to add a bit more water towards the end.  A butter knife will cut these. Will make again.

These were heavenly pork chops! My entire family left the table wanting more. I followed the recipe as written and added a can of crushed pineapple as suggested by a rater, excellent. A must try recipe.

wow! absolutely wonderful! so tender or  "soft" as my daughter puts it!  I made it in a crockpot with low sodium soy and a can of pinapple chuncks with juice.  i measured the juice and then added enough water  to it to make the required 2&1/2 cups of water.  Maybe this comes out better in the crockpot but these were anything but dry.

Made this recipe according to directions. Used 6 boneless pork ribs instead of chops.  Used others suggestions for low sodium sauces, which still turned out way too salty. So I did add a can of crushed pineapple to help cut saltiness.  Good, but still very salty.  Will have to make again and just use half amount of sauces so it is not so salty.  I also added a 28 oz can of La Choy stir fry vegies with their juices and a little brown sugar.  I put this over Kame Rice Stick noodles. Yummy.  Kids enjoyed it.

I should have got thicker chops.  I used thin chops for this recipe.  Was not as flavorful as I hoped.

If you are using thin pork chops, use less water.

After reading some reviews I used low sodium soy sauce and threw everything in the slow cooker for about 8 hours. Chops were falling apart.  Family really enjoyed these.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because I modified the recipe. With my adjustments, I'd give it 5 stars. First, I sliced my chops lengthwise so that they were thinner. While they were browning, I mixed up the sauce. I was running low on both soy and teriyaki sauce, so I just put in all that I had. It ended up being about 1/8 cup of soy and 1/2 cup of teriyaki. Based on other reviews, I added half of a 15-oz. can of crushed pineapple. I poured the sauce over the browned chops, covered the skillet, and simmered for about an hour and 15 minutes. Both taste and texture turned out great. Husband and kids ate it up! With garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, it was a great meal.

This really was "melt-in-your-mouth" quality! It was a tad on the salty side, and I used low fat/low sodium teriyaki sauce.  I also added two tablespoons of honey. It was quite good.

I took the other reviews into consideration and used low sodium soy sauce.... put the chops and liquids into a crock pot and cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours...  probably the most moist chops I've done yet.

This is excellent and easy to make. I used 1 cup of pineapple juice and 1 cup water. Next time I will use less soy sauce and more pineapple juice. I also sauted snap peas and zuchinni in this sauce. Also served with white rice.

Good flavor.  A little salty, but low sodium soy helps.  I'm going to try spicing it up next time with garlic, pineapple juice or other spices.

I did not care for this recipe.  I made it as directed (but did use 3/4 cup teriyaki and 1/3 cup soy).  I salvaged it by added a BUNCH of extra water, pineapple chunks and brown sugar.  The chops were tender, but way too strong.  No chance of making this again.....sorry.

EVERYBODY ENJOYED THESE CHOPS. SUCH AN EASY DISH W/ A LOT OF FLAVOR. I TOO USED LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE, WOULD DEFINATELY BE TOO SALTY W/ REGULAR SOY. I USED BONE IN THICK CHOPS, ONLY TOOK ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO BE FULLY COOKED.

I had a feeling that a recipe rated this high,couldn't be wrong. The chops were excellent!!! I used cuts of pork loin about 3/4" thick and the meat was perfect!! Didn't have any of the dryness problems as a few reviewers got. I did add 1/4 cup of fresh pineapple juice and a squeeze of orange freshly cut in half. Not an unhappy stomach in the house. Way easy to prepare, this is a definate must try and add to the recipe books!!

I added two teaspoons of honey, a cup of corn starch, pineapples, and cut the amount of water in half and substituted the rest with pineapple juice.

I then put this with the chops in the crockpot for two hours. Then in the oven (bathed in the sauce) for an hour, flipping them at the 1/2 hour point.

I made half pork chops and half "chicken chops". Tasted GREAT with both!

These were BY FAR the best pork chops I've ever eaten. My guests were completely surprised at how good they tasted! (I'm new to the cooking thing).

To my family, these just tasted like pork chops with soy sauce on them. It didn't seem like the extra cooking time did anything to make them taste better. I think I would rather cook my pork chops for 30 minutes in the oven breaded than to spend this much time on this.

Way too salty.  Would not make again even with low sodium ingredients.  Easy but not worth it. Would never make again.  Sorry!

This was a great recipe.  My family really liked it and it was really easy to make.  It was a little salty for me so I suggest using low sodium soy sauce.  However, the meat came out so tender.  I served it with rice and the sauce was a great little gravy for the rice.  I will be making this again.

Switch up the teriyaki sauce with a high quality marinade, pepper the sides of the chop before browning, and drop the cooking time to one hour, and you have some delicious, tender pork chops.  The meat was coming off of the bone as I lifted the chops from the water, very tender!

I used light soy sauce and light teryaki sauce. It was delicious, moist, easy to make, and a big hit with the entire family.

These weren't all that great. The flavor does not permeate the meat and all in all the flavor isn't too impressive. I won't make these again.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to add some crushed pineapple, like some other reviewers did, and a little less soy sauce. These pork chops were tender, but they lacked flavor. I only tasted a hint of the teriyaki; other than that, they were just salty.

My husband loves these. They are good and fall right off the bone. Because they are pork chops, they really are not what I would call moist but I have never tried a recipe where pork chops ever come out moist. This at least makes them soft enough that is makes up for that.

I MADE A FEW CHEANGES TO THE RECIPE AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I'M NOT A FAN OF PORK CHOPS BUT MY HUSBAND LOVES THEM SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE THE RECIPE A TRY. FIRST I CUT BACK THE SOY SAUCE AND TERIYAKI TO 1/2 CUP EACH, USED 1 1/4 CUP OF PINEAPPLE JUICE, 1 CUP CHICKEN BROTH, DISSOLVED 1/2 CUP OF CORNSTARCH IN A 1/2 CUP WATER AND 3 TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER HEAT IN A POT THEN PUT IT IN THE CROCKPOT FOR A FEW HOURS WITH THE PORK CHOPS I BROWN WITH GARLIC POWDER AND SEASONING SALT. I TOP THE PORK CHOPS WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. THW RECIPE IS A KEEPER.

This recipe was not even close to worth the time it took. The taste was okay and it was somewhat tender but not worth an hour of waiting. Plus I thought that it was a huge waste of the different ingredients as well.

I had to replace the teriyaki sauce with worcestshire sauce because i didn't have any. I also added some garlic powder. The pork chops were nice and tender but the flavor was okay not great.

Really liked the flavor of the chops but they were quite tough.  Next time will try the pineapple juice, may even marinate them for a bit so I won't have to cook them so long.....or find thicker chops.

These pork chops were delicious and Tender!!  I served them with Lipton's Asian Side LoMein and Green Giant Frozen Terriyaki Vegetables.  Probably one of the Easiest Meals I have ever made, but one of the best, as well!  My boyfriend loved them!

Again, the whole family enjoyed a recipe from this site.  I will be making this again.
I simply browned the chops, I only had thin chops.  Than added them to the liquid, which I had pre-warmed in the microwave, in the slow cooker.  I also cut the water by about 1 cup and added pineapple juice, as well as using low sodium products.  It didn't take too long in the slow cooker, maybe 2&1/2 hours.  Next time when I use thick chops I will plan for a longer cook time.  YUMMY!!

This is amazing! I thought that simmering them submerged sounded kind of odd.. but they turned out wonderfully! I reserved the sauce from the pan, and poured it on the meat when I plated it. The sauce is wonderful on broccoli as well!

This took way to long to where half way through I dumped the liquid out and just fried them.  Nothing like some fried pork chops.  The porkchops and teriyaki flavor did not go well to me.  I will not make this again.

Easy and yummy recipe. They were ready in 45 minutes instead of the original time stated. I used 1 in. chops and seasoned them with pepper and garlic.  They were tender and went well with my favorite green bean dish.  Thanks.

My son loved this and he has never enjoyed pork chops before. I used centre loin chops and I still found it a bit tough but my son had no complaints. I will definitely make again but use less soy and teriyaki sauce.

I usually ask my husband how many stars he would give the recipes when i make them. This time i didnt have to ask. He told me that he would give this zero stars. I thought the flavor was really good. I only cooked it for 45-50 min. and it almost burnt. I flipped the chops many times. I gave it 3 stars cause i liked it but my husband didnt.

THIS WAS REALLY GOOD. I USED TURKERY CUTLETS INSTEAD OF PORK CHOPS TO MAKE THEM LOWER IN FAT. I ALSO PUT THEM IN THE CROCK POT FOUR HOURS OR SO. QUICK AND EASY.

This recipe is the best!  I usually make this on lazy Sundays when I don't feel like being in the kitchen all day.  The chops were so juicy and fell off of the bone.  My fiance loves them and the leftover chops (if there are any!!!) are just as good the next day.

My suggestion to those who say that the chops get dry is to use thick (1-1/2 inch) pork chops with the bone instead of the thin boneless pork chops.

I used chicken breasts instead of pork chops.  The taste was fabulous.  However, it did seem like an awful long time to cook.  Also, there was an abundance of the sauce left over which ended up as waste.

The pork chops were a little dry and this was after adding the pineapple chunks as others suggested.  This meal took a long time to cook and I was not impressed with the outcome.  Would not make again.

This dish was fairly decent, however, I did find it a bit too salty as other people on here did as well.  Next time, I'd maybe go with a bit less soy sauce, maybe 1/4 cup.  There's plenty of liquid, so I can't see being that big of a deal.  Also, next time, I think I'm gonna add some pineapple juice, just to sweeten it up a bit more.  The meat was super tender though, it almost fell apart as I tried to take them out of the pan.

Wonderful.  I use either pineapple or orange juice instead of water sometimes to cut down on the saltiness of the soy sauce.

I had to simmer my chops a little longer, they were pretty thick. They were tender, but a bit too salty. A very easy dish to prepare.

I agree that more water would help, but it was great with rice, and I'll probably

This is a good dish overall but the salt from the soy and teriyaki sauces are too strong. If I make this dish again I would decrease the soy and teriaki sauces and add more water the flavor will still be there.

Made as directed and then put in crock pot.  Served on a bed of white rice. It was delicious. Lots of sauce but worked great on the rice. Flavorfull and fell apart with fork but some bites were a little dry but still awesome.

These were amazing! I did have to play around with the amounts a bit, but damned if I can tell you how much. LOL But wow, moist, flavourful...even my hubby liked them, and he's pickier than the kids.

This recipe worked out so well I made an account just to post this! Instead of whole, I diced the pork chops, used low sodium soy sauce and cooked it in a wok, phenomenally simple recipe! 6 stars! I used the same recipe with different ingredients, its a winner every time! Favorite is pork, Worcestershire sauce and BBQ sauce, fantastic! The meat always comes out "melt in your mouth," and the flavor goes all the way through every time, this is one recipe I never mind taking the time to cook for so long. Thank you!!! ******

No. No. No. DO NOT PUT SOY SAUCE IN THIS!!! Good recipe but with ONLY teriyaki and MAYBE BBQ or Worcestershire. TOO SALTY! I even just used half of the suggested amount cut with rice vinegar. NOOO! Too much salt! Try it procceeding with caution, JUST USE TERIYAKI. Trust me, it's enough flavor.

The flavor was good, but cooking it for so long made them COMPLETELY dried out.  I would make this again, but cut down the cooking time by quite a bit.

I tried this tonight and agree with the other reviews. The flavor is very nice but mine came out tough as well. I brazed both sides of the chops before adding the liquid, simmered for 1 hour 20 minutes. Let them rest for about 10 minutes before serving but still tough. I wonder if it is the cut of chop, mine were very lean. Suggestions appreciated.

I amended the recipe used 1/2 cup soy 1 cup terakayki juice from tine of pineapple.  I added all ingredients to a saucepan and added 2 heaped spoonfuls of cornflour mixed to a paste with water, bring up to the boil an then pour over the browned chops.  I also added some of the pineapple cubes.  Cooked at gas 175 for 2 hours and the port just melted in your mouth!

Served with egg noodle stir fried with green beans and cashew nuts and slight soy sauce.

Very simple recipe but very bland. Also the only time I have ever cooked any meat totally submerged in a liquid and it still turned out dry and tough.
