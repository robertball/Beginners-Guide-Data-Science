Crispy Pork Carnitas Haiku: "Method is perfect, texture moist crispy heaven, but cinnamon? NO." The cinnamon totally wrecked this for us; b4 the broiling stage, my husband actually removed about half of the meat and rinsed it off under running water b4 returning it to a separate pan to broil on its own w/ bbq sauce. I decided to try to recipe as it was written by CJ, but my nostrils and my house were already permeating w/ the overwhelming scent of cinnamon that I had a feeling I was in for disappointment. W/ enough cilantro, salsa and colorful taco-toppings, the meal was salvaged for my daughter and I, but like I said, my husband had already separated, de-cinnamoned, and doctored his own pork. I did everything as written, and the method I will absolutely recreate for a pork butt again, but will not be using cinnamon. Oh, I also want to add that the directions never mentioned shredding, so we left ours in the 2" cubes, which did fall apart nicely anyways, but b/c the hunks were so large, there wasn't enough surface area to get crispy when broiling, so I would shred the pork after straining as well.

I cannot believe that I am the first one to review this recipe. I have another carnitas recipe that I usually use but this one looked interesting and I have used another one of Chef John's recipes and loved it. I followed the directions and the ingredients except I didn't have the Chinese 5 spice. I substituted Goya Sazon sin achiote. The carnitas were juicy and crispy. Do not forget the drizzle at the end. I will be deleting my other carnitas recipe. Thanks Chef John.

I made two batches using this recipe today.  The first I made as written but the second I left out the orange and cinnamon and added some thyme, oregano, and onion powder.  The second batch was much more to our liking.   Although the orange is okay, I think the cinnamon leaves a bad taste to the meat.  I was very happy with the way both batches cooked.  Both were juicy, tender and crispy.  I may change the spices used, but I'll definitely continue to use the cooking method.

I made this as is, I didn't care for the five spice & cinnamon. But the pork was tender and juicy, so I made some substitutions to the spices. I used 2 tsp oregano, 1 tsp cumin, and 1/4 onion powder. I also have cooked this in my slow cooker for 4 & 1/2 hours on low, it came out just as fantastic.

This has become my favorite meal.

Pro tip: if you like garlic, save the cloves and mash them into a delicious spread that you can put on the tortilla before loadin' it up.

I tweaked the recipe a little bit -- instead of orange juice / orange peel, I use the juice from two limes.  The orange peel ended up disintegrating the first time I made it, and, though I tried really hard not to get any pith, it gave it a sort of bitter taste.  The lime juice goes really well and doesn't overpower it.  I think I cut back on the cinnamon a little bit, too.

I usually serve it with fajita stuffs - flash fried green peppers and onions with a tiny bit of seasoning in a warm tortilla, and sometimes over cilantro lime rice.

I love this cooking method, perfect every time! I do take the liberty of adjusting spices to my taste (which means leaving out the cinnamon and five spice) and to what I have in my spice vault, when I have New Mexico green chili, look out!  The trick is no peeking for the first part and baste, baste, baste for the finishIng touch!!

Easily the best carnitas recipe you’re going to find. It’s super simple and is almost cool proof. I do add smoked paprika, chipotle and ancho chili powder to the spice mixture for more complex flavors. Always a hit!

This method is spot on. The pork was so tender! I'm not sure the cinnamon works here. I found that with the five spice powder the cinnamon was just a little over the top. When I make this again (and I will) I think I'll omit the cinnamon and maybe add 1/4 tsp of cayenne instead to balance the flavor of the five spice.

Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Made this tonight and it was delicious.  The meat was ender and juicy and the flavors worked great together.  My only change was that I used 2 cinnamon sticks instead of the ground cinnamon.  I made a slaw with fresh lime juice, cilantro and pinch of kosher salt and ate it all on corn tortillas and garnished with pico de gallo.  We will definitely make this again!

OMG PEOPLE whaaaaaaat are you talking about?!? Make this exactly as Chef John says, you wil not be disappointed. Just ridiculous, melty, flavorful, makes your house smell amazing pork goodness. This is absolutely delicious. The cinnamon and Chinese 5-spice does not overwhelm, it boosts the pork flavor like I’ve never experienced before. I had a 7.6 lb pork butt, bone in, and it took me a minute to cut it all up and I could have gone a wee bit smaller on the chunk size. I doubled the recipe to account for the amount of pork and had to split it between a 9x13 and an 8x8, but even just eyeballing it, it worked out spectacularly. My husband tried it and closed his eyes while chewing, it was so good (a la Remy in Ratatouille). Don’t be afraid, make it just like it says. Watch the video. You won’t be sorry. Thanks Chef John!

I'm planning to make this tonight and have a question. The instructions say to chop up the fat removed from the pork ... but never says what to do with it after it's chopped ... Put it in the baking pan with the meat for flavor?

The cinnamon, orange and 5 spice overpowered the pork. The technique did produce tender meat and I will use it again but substitute lime juice and coriander for the flavors I didn't care for.

I was so disappointed.  I usually love all of Chef John's recipe, but this one was way off mark for pork carnitas.  The Chinese 5 Spice was much too over powering in flavor.  Did not go over well at all.  I tried to rinse off the meat the second day and added some Mexican type seasoning to cover up the taste, but it didn't work.  Do not understand why so many good reviews on this as I followed the recipe and am an experienced cook.  Perhaps we just are spoiled living in Southern California and having super good Mexican food here.  Never had a Pork Carnitas taco taste like this.  I will keep the Chinese 5 Spice for Asian recipes.

My family loved this! After reading the other reviews, I did take the cinnamon down to a sprinkle. The pork came out tender and crispy and very flavorful. I topped mine with grilled onions and bell peppers. Perfect!

Made these last night after marinating for 2 days (just didn’t have time to cook it on the first day as I started late!)

They came out just how Chef John said they would…delicious.  Only difference, I cooked mine in a Dutch oven and for the broiler step used a regular tin foil backing pan.

I used all ingredients and added some regular table salt when I put the pork under the broiler.  The salt brought out the other flavors even more.  Yummy.  

Definitely a keeper.

I made it as per the recipe except that I used a pork loin since that was what we had on hand and I really wanted to try this. I think it will be better w/ the fattier cut. I felt that ours was too dry. We liked the flavor, even with the funky spices. I didn't like the smell of the cinnamon and orange while it was cooking, and figured I had really blown it, but had no objection to the flavor.  Next time I think I'll try some of the spices and lime juice that others suggested instead of cinnamon, 5 spice and orange. Update: left out the orange, 5 spice and cinnamon and used lime juice, cumin, taco seasoning, onion powder, garlic, and used the proper cut of meat this time. Absolutely delicious. Family thought it was so much better. Be sure to serve w/ cilantro.

I’ve tried other carnitas recipes, and I typically use a slow cooker version, and more often than not I’m disappointed in the results. Not this time. This recipe was spot on. I didn’t change a thing. Absolutely loved it. Not sure why people leave reviews and say they’ve changed this to that, substituted a for b, used this instead of that, deep fried instead of baked, left this out, added that in. Thanks for reviewing a completely different recipe. If you can do cinnamon, five spice, and cumin, this is for you. Don’t change anything.

The flavors blended very nicely, a rich and satisfying meal that disappeared quickly.  I like Chef John's way of adding orange peel--I am now using that method in other recipes.

I thought the methodology behind this recipe is great, but the cinnamon was a bit much.  Toned that down a lot, stayed with the orange/juice, and added a lot of garlic.  I did use  my Le Creuset dutch oven - I wanted the meat to really cook in the fat, just like my local taco shops do, and then a really thorough shredding and browning.  Must do simple salsa fresca - Chef John - Bravo!!

Amazing!  I made this for a family challenge taco night and I blew out the competition.  The meat didn't even make it out of the dish before it was depleted everyone loved it.  I am going to keep this one for a go to dish.  You will not be disappointed.  The five spice gives it a great flavor that is unexpected.  So tender...I made it as the recipe called for.

Delicious!  Amazing flavor!  My entire family loved this dish even  my DIL who doesn't like pork! 
After reading the reviews I did leave out a couple ingredients,  I omitted the cinnamon &  orange peel. (I might try it including them at a later date) and I didn't have the 5 spice so I  used a little cayenne.  
After it had cooked the 3.5 hours I used a couple of forks & tore it up some. Not completely shredded but more of a chunky shred and then broiled it.  
I am so happy I tried this recipe, I was so good! Well worth the lengthy cook time  and it really was quite easy to make. This is definitely a keeper and I can toss my other Carnitas recipe out! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really liked the technique in the recipe, but felt something was missing in the flavor, more heat or chili maybe idk. I did low and slow one night, then reheated in a skillet and threw it under the broiler the next. Be careful if you decide to reduce the sauce, it gets strong quick.

We have made this recipe over 5 times and did not change a thing. If you like authentic mexican tacos you will love this. I was skeptical about it, I normally make cow tongue tacos and the ingredients seemed odd but its AMAZING! This is the street taco lovers dream! My husband and I watch food wishes all the time. We have tried numerous chef john recipes and not one has disappointed us. We dress ours using corn tortillas heated on an ungreased skillet with finely chopped red onion, salsa verde, cilantro and freshly squeezed lime. I highly suggest watching the youtube video for this recipe!

Made this as written with no changes outside of letting the meat sit in the marinade overnight. Was incredible! Paired it with Chefs Johns fire roasted cherry tomato salsa (as recommended on foodwishes) and added a little bit of white and green onions (ran out of fresh cilantro) and put it all in a warm corn tortilla - amazing! Would definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as is. This was a definite hit-even to my picky husband. We live in Southern California, and we eat "real" authentic Mexican food on the regular so the cinnamon didn't scare me.  I left it in, and it reminded me of my friend's mom and the mole she used to make. In regards to the cinnamon, I barely even tasted it at the end. To me, it just tasted warm and 'rounded'. Thank you Chef John! I watch your Youtube channel when I work out on the treadmill(so I can eat more food!) =)

Made it just as written - except doubled the recipe.  It was awesome!  Great flavor, all spices and combinations work.  The pork is delicious even before crisping it up.  Thank you for a great recipe - already made it twice.

Normally I make and review the original recipe, however, based on other reviews I made a couple of changes.  I omitted the cinnamon and Chinese 5 Spice, and added 1/2 tsp coriander, 2 tsp chili powder, and 1 tsp oregano.  I also added 1 yellow onion chunked.  I used the peel and juice from 1/2 a large organic navel orange and followed the technique exactly.  I finally found the richness and depth of flavor other recipes were lacking.  This is fabulous served with pico de gallo, sour cream and lime wedges.  Making this my go-to from now on, all other carnitas recipes are out the door!  Bravo Chef John!

Really good!  Very interesting spice combo.  Perfectly tender meat inside a nice crusty outer layer.  My husband loved it.  And so did I.

We love Chef John. After reading other reviews I cut back slightly on the cinnamon but I’m not sure I needed to. Nothing was overpowering, very flavorful. Appreciate the step by step directions. We served this pork with 5 spice roasted potatoes & green beans. Yummy!

Great recipe. So yummy. I accidentally forgot the garlic and it was still good. I did add garlic powder to compensate. Can’t wait to make this again, not forgetting the garlic.

BOMB. A little putsy, but worth the extra effort to cube it and crisp it under the broiler. Do not do what I did and accidentally buy a pork shoulder picnic roast; it had a large bone in it. I also didn't thaw it thoroughly as it was frozen around the bone. 20 minutes into trying to cut the meat off the bone I was regretting not throwing the whole thing in the oven. 4 hours later I did NOT regret the extra time I took to cube it, because increasing the crispy surface area was SO worth it! 
I had a 7lb roast so I almost doubled the recipe. Did not use 5-spice, used half the cinnamon, added 1 tsp each of dried oregano and thyme. Was still great, most of the salt came out in the juices, so basting the meat during the broiling process added much of that flavor back. That being said I think I would use half the salt next time. Will definitely make again!

I really enjoy this recipe. I have made it a few times and although I never quite get it crispy, it is delicious every time. I definitely agree that some fresh pico de gallo is the perfect compliment for this!

I did a thorough trimming of the fat, and did not re-add it to the pork cubes, becuase I did not watch the video. That being said it came out perfect. In my opinion the written directions should be as comprehensive as the video.

We liked this, but the orange flavor was a bit overpowering.  Next time I will try reducing the amount of orange zest, or maybe even eliminating the orange zest.

Love it. The orange peels are essential to that authentic tanginess. We like ours a little crispier, like it came off of a parilla so I broil it a few more rounds.

This recipe is amazing!  I have never made carnitas before and the meat turned out just beautiful. I left out the cinnamon, as others suggested. I added paprika and onion powder instead. It takes a long time to cook, but it’s not labor intensive.

These came out so tender and amazingly flavorful! I didn't have the 5-spice powder, but used everything else on the recipe. I left it a few minutes less on broil than what's specified on the video, but they still came out crispy enough and absolutely delicious. Definitely one of my favorite pork shoulder recipes here!

This is by far the best carnitas recipe I have ever tried...and I have tried some of the best!!! Was afraid to use the cinnamon and Chinese spice after reading reviews so I used a regular carnitas spice medley of oregano, crushed pepper, onion and garlic powder. Was so easy... have always cooked the roast first and then shredded it. This is so much quicker and easier. Next time I may try the slow cooker. Thank you Chef John!!!You NEVER disappoint!!!

This was a big hit at my house!  Even the kiddos were requesting it to take for lunch to school.  Broiling made all the difference in the texture of the meat.  Absolutely faithful to the flavor of the original with a little lighter cooking style.  Loved it and we will make it again!

I didn’t add the Chinese powder but the rest was identical to recipe. The broiling without flipping is genius.

Very good recipe, used pork and lamb with sliced bell peppers red onions and minced garlic. This version made carnitas tacos with assorted aiolis The meat was tender and very juicy served as shown by Chef John and also on leftover buttered angel hair pasta.

Followed recipe exactly, except for Chinese five spice I didn't have, I just used Goya all purpose seasoning instead. These carnitas were delicious!! I'm planning a family dinner with these later this week, can't wait because I know they'll all want the recipe! So good! Thank you!

I typically don’t like or write reviews that deviate from the recipe. That said, there were so many negative reviews on the cinnamon, that I substituted half teaspoon of chili powder and chipotle chili powder, also added a quarter cup of root beer soda as my pork was leaner than expected. Also used entire head of garlic and some adobo sauce for some heat. Simply fantastic and I am sure if you are a fan of cinnamon Chef Johns recipe will suit you. A word of caution. Last instruction says baste meat with some fat drippings and broil for 3 minutes, then repeat. Fat can pop up and catch fire in broiler. As others recommended I reserved garlic to spread on tacos for next meal. Made Jasmin rice with half of reserved liquid, half water, diced onion and chopped orange peel from recipe. Served carnitas over. This is definitely a keeper. Simple, easy, light clean up. Ideal to serve guests as you won’t be a slave to the meal in the kitchen. Enjoy!

The technique is a keeper! This has been the best texture and tender carnitas result we've tried. The flavors weren't exactly what we wanted, but that's okay. We'll play up the orange and lime more next time. We haven't found our ideal cumin ratio. I'm allergic to cinnamon. I'm well aware of how often it ends up in dishes...even savory. You have no idea. It's in mass market chillis, all kinds of restaurant meat dishes, and of course 80% of desserts. Finding it here was not a surprise. I bet it tastes delicious (I love cinnamon but my body hates it).

Chef John has done it again!  This may take some time but the cooking process ensures absolute tender meat.  Don’t forget to brush the juices in between broiling!  I used all the ingredients but I didn’t have pork shoulder, I settled for boneless pork ribs and trimmed most of the fat off and chopping up to throw in with the mix.  It’s crucial to do this as the fat gives a lot of flavor to it.  My GF and I had this for dinner and she couldn’t stop licking her fingers.  This is a winner for me, I mean us!

Best tacos ever! I omitted the cinnamon and orange peels, just used some orange juice. Added some garlic salt and onion powder. I make a lot of tacos and this was by far the best! Topped it off with a pineapple Slaw. My new fave!

Wow! After reading several reviews regarding the cinnamon, I was skeptical but as a NATIVE south Texan, I can vouch for the authenticity of these carnitas, the flavor is SPOT on! I kept the spice proportion as written but adjusted for the amount of pork. The grocery store only had "value packs" of pork carnitas, so I put half in the freezer for a later time. I think I cut the pieces too small as the 3 1/2hr cooking time made them literally ready to fall apart, the technique "saved the day" after broiling. (Yeah, I took the rest, out of the freezer the next morning, cuz they're THAT good!) Cut them more "chunky",  "stumped my toe" with the spices, reduced cooking time to 3hrs and tossed them between each broil to acquire an even crispiness , for the next batch. I have so many questions for Chef John regarding his background, how he finds the right combination of spices for his consistently authentic recipes, and profession. Another hit, Sir!! Thank you!

Delicious flavor (omitted the chinese five spice, though) and texture, that few minutes of broiling is key.  Patting myself on the back for cooking this in disposable foil pan:).  Another winner from Chef John!  (if you don't know his baked chicken wings recipe, do yourself a favor and look it up)

Made this today.  A few people mentioned the level of cinnamon, so I cut the amount in half.  Other than that I made it as written and it was excellent.

This turned out great! I've been craving carnitas. I doubled the spices, and used Chef Johns flour tortilla recipe. I did use pork loin, instead of shoulder, because its what I had.

This is the most delicious meat ever. I've done it as written many times. Today I seared the meat, then put it in the crock pot with everything. Finished it in the oven and it was amazing, but slightly easier.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would. This is hands down the best meat I’ve ever tasted. The meat turned out perfectly tender and juicy with a little crisp on the outside. Everything about this recipe even from the very beginning is filled with delicious aroma and tastes. The video is very instructional and easy to follow. Chef John has become my families new favorite chef. Almost every night I hear “is this one of chef Johns recipes?” Because everything he creates is scrumptious. TRY THIS RECIPE... EXACTLY HOW IT IS. You won’t be disappointed.

Saw that a lot of people were saying not to use cinnamon, and to use limes instead of oranges. It came out AMAZING! The only thing I would recommend is to shred the meat before you put it in the broiler and use a thinner baking sheet for broiling, otherwise the top crisps too much while the middle is still juicy. Overall, a really good recipe.

After reading the first few reviews, I did omit the cinnamon and five spice, adding in coriander and granulated garlic. I think I will try it with both another time, I read further reviews and they liked it as is. My hubby loved it and so did I. I plan to reheat what was left adding sautéed onions and bell peppers and maybe some mushrooms. Super yummy!

This is a fantastic recipe. I modified to use a cup of orange juice instead of an orange, and substituted Fiesta Pork Rub in place of the cinnamon and Chinese spice. The first time I made it hubby ate almost 2 lbs by himself. Highly recommend!!

I've made carnitas in the crockpot, in the oven,... Hands down this is the best version I've ever made. Followed directions as written. One minor change-half the cinnamon. I've used cinnamon in carnitas before and knew a little goes a loooong way! Thank you Chef John once again for a huge winner!

I prepared this exactly as written and it was one of the best and tastiest ways to use pork roast I've ever made.  My husband loved it and has asked that we have this again when the children and grandchildren visit.  No better recommendation.

I made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I added all the fat from the picnic so I thought there would be plenty of juices but I ended up with only 4 or 5 tablespoons.  I cooked it in an egg at 275 for 3 1/2 hours. It was falling apart when I tried to remove it to  the collander.  I browned it as directed.  It was fabulous.  The fat had all rendered out and the flavors were fantastic.  I put it in corn tortillas with some pico de gallo and some cotija cheese.  I will be making this on a regular basis. Thanks Chef John!

Excellent recipe!  Next time I will bake long under the broiler.  Followed to a tee except only put 1/2 of the cumin.

This is the second time I made this. This time I left out the five-spice as it was too strong for me and didn't seem to fit. But the method used here is the best I have ever seen or tasted. Bravo!!!!

Really good. Mine didn't have any juices to drain off so not sure what I did wrong or what happened, but they were still great! Think I may try to use the spice/oil/juice mixture as a marinade and then put in the crock all day to finish off under the broiler to see if I can make an easy set it and forget it meal.  Made a pot of rice and homemade guacamole to go with it. YUM!

Awesome recipe especially not having to fry in skillet.  Like others, skipped the cinnamon but changed to 3/4 teaspoon five spice, 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon fresh roasted / ground chili powder.  Five spice does change the flavor but I like it, if you don't just pass altogether and follow rest of recipe.

this. was. DELICIOUS! i followed the recipe exactly, except for the Chinese 5 spice because i didn't have any. but i looked up the ingredients to that spice and noticed it had cloves, so i added a few of those by themselves to the rest of the ingredients.  this recipe turned out to be SO MOIST and flavorful! i saw others saying that they didn't like the cinnamon, but i thought it was perfect.  the flavor of the orange and the cinnamon were both just scrumptious.  i made this for myself, my husband, and a buddy of ours and we ate it up! i served it with finely diced white onion, cilantro, and tomato on a corn tortilla and the juiciness of the meat was all the moisture we needed. i think i'll make this for my dad the next time i see him :)

I found it to be overseasoned.  This is easily remedied.  I cut the cinnamon in half and the 5 spice by 25%.  This was perfect for my taste.  The texture and flavor is way better than the many crock pot and dutch oven recipes I have made.  I experiment with different salsas.  Today I made traditional molcajete salsa.  Spectacular!!

I left the cinnamon out on principle and after reading the reviews I'm so glad I did. Everything else I did as per the recipe - even the orange peel and juice, which made me a tad uneasy. I just made this last night with homemade corn tortillas and I became the hero of the world. This is easy, solid and repeatable and most importantly so delicious you won't believe it came from your own kitchen. Yes, make these quickly!

I don't know if it was the cinnamon or the Chinese 5 spice, but it tasted funny..The texture was perfect though, and I'll make this again but leave those two ingredients out.

Great recipe, followed it as written, just delicious.  The mix of spices and slow cooking make this dish moist, slightly sweet and unique.  The exotic flavor of the cinnamon, cumin and 5 spice along with the brightness of the orange work so well. It tastes like you have been cooking all day and yet it is so simple.

Really, really good.   Omitted 5 spice powder (didn't have any) but otherwise made as directed.  Next time I'll up the cumin a little and cut back on the salt.  Served as soft tacos with corn tortillas, salsa and guacamole.  Thanks John for another great recipe.

Great recipe!!! I omitted the cinnamon......my only error was adding a little more salt than necessary..... I think that a little more than a teaspoon would due.
