Red lentils don't take an hour to cook. I used 3 cups of water and simmered on a low boil for 30 minutes. Used two large tomatoes and a big bag of spinach. Added a chopped red chili pepper, increased the turmeric to 1/2 tsp, and added a dollop of Patak's vindaloo paste. Served with rice. Delish!

this came out great - i have one word of caution.  I'm new to Indian cooking, and I was very unprepared to cook the mustard and cumin seeds until they start to splatter.  They splattered all over the stove and the floor!  I think I heated the oil too hot. Be prepared with a lid when you do this and don't heat the oil too much before you add the seeds.  Otherwise, delicious!!!

I made this in the instant pot. Started with the saute function to cook spices and onion/garlic in coconut oil, then added rinsed lentils and broth. Pressure cooked 10 minutes, let sit for 10 minutes, then released steam. Stirred in tomatoes and spinach and added salt and cayenne to taste at the end. Served over brown rice with cilantro and labneh. Delish!

This tasted much better than anticipated. Served it up with some chutney and the sweetness brought all the flavors together, even got the kids to eat some too.

Thank you Lucky for the satisfying meal we had tonight, not a bad recipe for someone just being introduced to Indian cooking. I do however feel that it needed more of a kick. We ate it with naan.

This recipe is great! I doubled the recipe and also added more spinach, onions, garlic and spices! Really good and flavorful but best of all easy for my first time making an Indian dish!

It made for a decent meal, but I thought it needed more spices. We had it with bread since we didnâ€™t have rice ready.

Recipe was very good. I added lemon juice (1/2 lemon) at the end to give it that extra kick. Also, as other reviewers pointed out:
1) the seeds splatter so make sure to cover them
2) the lentils boil over easily so make sure to NOT cover them completely
3) Lentils dont need an hour to cook. 30 minutes is entirely sufficient

Delicious!
I didn't have on hand the mustard seeds or turmeric, will buy them and make it again, I bet it will be better. To try to compensate for that missing flavor I substituted chicken broth for the water.
Lucky, thank you for sharing your mom's recipe!

This turned out great!  This was my first try at cooking an Indian dish, and I was relieved that it wasn't intimidating at all.  An hour to cook the lentils was just the right amount of time to get a perfect dal consistency.  Additional comment - I made this again but didn't have red lentils and used regular lentils.  I would say it is very important to use red lentils.  The consistency was much better with the red, and it absorbed the favors much better.

I switched it up at bit to add more veggies and taste more like a curry dish. added mixed greens, half a minced zucchini, grated carrot. Gave it a sweeter flavor so added a teaspoon of curry powder, tsp of garam marsala, berebere spice and a half teaspoon salt. Great spicy flavour. Nice to be able to make this recipe versatile. Serving it with basmati and naan.

Delicious! I didn't have cumin seeds so I just used ground cumin. I also threw all my spices in with the mustard seeds, and it still came out very flavorful. Did a little more than the pinch of turmeric, and I also used split lentils instead of whole. A great recipe!

Used ground mustard instead of seeds because I didn't have them. Other than that stuck with the program. Tastes great.

If you're doubling the recipe, be sure to double the amount of water you put in with the lentils. The auto feature neglects that!!!
