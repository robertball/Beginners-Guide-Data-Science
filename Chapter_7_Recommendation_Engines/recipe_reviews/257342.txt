I  read over this recipe and followed it pretty loosely. I made a pasta salad with mayo/yogurt based dressing and put that in the bottom of a glass bowl then layered on diced peppers, grated carrots, diced celery, diced tomatoes ( I’ll use grape tomatoes next time ) then cubed sharp cheddar. I topped it with 17 devilled egg halves and sliced green onions. I dusted the eggs with paprika. 
It was a  very, very, very impressive looking salad when it was all done. Took a good amount of time to make but definitely worth the effort. I thought it was delicious and so did my family. I will make it again and probably change up the ingredients and presentation for fun.

i personally liked it but I made this for Christmas it looked so good. It it wasn’t a hit at our dinner.  If you have a lot of other options my family went for the other options.  this was pretty but not practical for people to put on their plate with the layers.  Just a thought for anyone making this.

I did make a few changes. I did not make the dressing, as it is very caloric and cholesterol-heavy. I did another dressing on the side. I brushed the fish with olive oil and a flavored vinegar (almost any would be good) and salt and pepper and baked in the toaster oven for about 5 minutes until 145 degrees was reached. Other than that, my family does not eat bacon; instead I used cheddar cheese shreds, which was so pretty! My only criticism is that it is very difficult to get down to the bottom of the trifle bowl, to the lettuce. Next time I make this, I will halve the layers and make it in double layers (repeat the layers) except for the eggs. It was beautiful, delicious, filling, and a wonderful one-dish company meal. I served it with fresh bread from my bread machine.
