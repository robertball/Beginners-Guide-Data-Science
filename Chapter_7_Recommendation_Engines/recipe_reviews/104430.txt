This pie went over very well. I brought it to a birthday dinner for my father, and the whole family enjoyed it. We did not think it tasty "boozy".

This was a very elegant and light dessert.  The only thing I would change is to maybe make extra whipped cream to garnish the top along with some chocolate curls.  It tasted a little bit "boozy" but not overwhelmingly so...just needed to be prettied up a bit, I think.

Not too heavy but still nice on flavor.
