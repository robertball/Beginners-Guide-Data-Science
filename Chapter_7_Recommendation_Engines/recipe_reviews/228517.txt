I did not have heavy cream on hand, I substituted evaporated milk. That was the only change I made. I did use pure vanilla extract, not imitation. I cooked these in my cast iron skillet--instead of spooning 3 tablespoons of batter into the skillet, I used 1/4 cup. I also used a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar mix on top of the pancake. Cooking them in the cast iron skillet gave the pancakes this wonderful crust that was absolutely amazing. The kids and I adored these pancakes--we literally ate ourselves silly with these this morning. BEST. PANCAKES. EVER.

This was everything it promised!! OH Yummy!!! I didn't have heavy cream, so I followed a substitute of 3/4 c milk and 1/3 c melted butter. I doubled the recipe and made 16 good size pancakes. They're really rich, so a few go a long way. Thanks for such a great treat!!

These are pretty good if you make them with a very light sugar mix topping.  I had two teen boys taste-test these.  The first batch was very sweet.  They gave them 3 stars.  I gave the recipe 4 stars, because I made another batch that had a VERY thin layer of the sugar mixture on them.  Not sure if I would make these again, unless serving them for dessert.  They came out a little thin, but the texture was fluffy as the submitter stated.

Loved the "crust". Very good flavor. Made a horrible mess on my griddle, should've skipped the butter, I think.

Nice flavor, but I've tried these about five times and every time they stick to the pan, no matter what I do, and then when I flip them the sugar topping gets scraped off.

This is a nice variation on the traditional pancakes.  The pancakes were light and fluffy which contrasted nicely with the crunchy sugar topping.  I didn’t have any heavy cream so I substituted light cream which worked out very well.  I thought they would be too sweet, however they weren’t and we still used maple syrup.

These are excellent pancakes. I used evaporated milk as I had no cream on hand. I added some chopped nuts to bump it up a bit. They are really good but I gave them a 4 as I think I preferred the ones that I made without the cinnamon sugar than with. Otherwise amazing - no syrup needed if you do put the sugar mixture on.

Oh. My. Yes. This was so, so good. Only change I made was that I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just upped the milk to 1 1/2 cups. Made these on my griddle at 400. It made 16 pancakes for me. We made a pear sauce to serve over top, using 2 diced pears, 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup of sugar, dash of cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Used a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up. We had this for dinner, and it was the most wonderful fall meal. This is definitely a keeper for us! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!
