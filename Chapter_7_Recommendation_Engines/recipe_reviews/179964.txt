Really good! Added 2 tbsp of butter before adding wine, a pinch of cayenne and freshly ground salt & pepper. When it was done, I added some fresh mozzarella and put it back into the broiler to melt a little.  I had a bag of fresh spinach so served the shrimp over that. It was delicious! Even my 7 yr old loved it.  Thanks, will certainly make it again.

This was good - I didn't have mozz so I just used parm and some bread crumbs for the broiling part. This was very fast and simple!

This is delicious. I, for one, am not offended by the use of cheese with seafood. My husband took one bite and asked me to make it again - soon. I served this with pasta and it was a complete hit! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I loved this simple recipe. I never make a dish with a wine that I wouldn't drink..that being said, I replaced the wine in the recipe with a nice Sutterhome red wine and made sure it was reduced efficiently. I added some rosemary to the simmering sauce then added fresh basil and a bit of cayenne for kick. SUPERB!

This was a quick, easy and delicious meal!  The garlic infused shrimp...awesome.  I added red pepper flakes just to try it.  Yes it was a great addition, however it was not necessary because the meal was perfect as is.  I thank my husband for the suggestion to make shrimp scampi.  I tossed in some linguine to complete the meal.  Gonna make this again very soon!

If you like plain.....This recipe is for you.  My boyfriend liked it, but it just tasted like plain shrimp to me.....i love shrimp, but i would have rather saved myself the time, and bought cooked shrimp and had shrimp cocktail!

I'm sorry but we weren't impressed.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  It tasted kind of bland.

I have to admit, I made this because Pam's picture looked so good.  I tend to like to use the recipes that have pictures.....I know, not fair.  This was really good.  I followed the recipe with the addition of a little butter and a shake of hot pepper flakes.  Hubs and I both agree that I should make this again.  I served over linguine.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Although it is completely delicious, we felt as though something was missing.  I was not sure what sides to pair with this dish.  I just had garlic bread.  Next time I will pair this dish with a side of garlic bread and asparagus.

This was good but a little too bland. Wish I had added red pepper flakes like others suggested.  Served it over rice pilaf with roasted asparagus.  Still a good quick dinner!

I made this as is with additions of red pepper flakes as others suggested and butter.  I know the butter takes the heart healthy out a little bit but it was oh so good!
