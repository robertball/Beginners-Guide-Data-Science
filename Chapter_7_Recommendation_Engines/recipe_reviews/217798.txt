This was SO GOOD. Definitely will make again. It wasn't that time consuming, either. The only changes I made were to omit the olives and substitute green beans for asparagus. I especially loved the toasted pine nuts in it. My dad told me how to roast a red pepper: cut it into flat pieces and put them skin side up under the broiler until they turn black, then peel the black skin off. It turned out great. I might actually put in more veggies next time.

I liked how fresh it tasted, but probably won't make it again.

This was pretty tasty, and makes great leftovers if there's only two of you.  I was lazy and used prepared pesto from a jar, and I also increased the veggies to a cup of each.  I wasn't in the mood for crisp veggies so I sauteed them in coconut oil for 3-4 minutes and then added a half cup of chicken broth, which I reduced uncovered.  Tastes good hot or cold.  Thanks for sharing.

We thought this was delicious! I did use my own homemade pesto sauce that I had in the freezer, which is very similar to the one in the recipe, except for the lemon juice. Also, I didn't measure any of the ingredients, but I do know that I used more of everything called for, omitting the sun dried tomatoes b/c I didn't have any. I would def make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was awesome however I upped the garlic to a whole head, and doubled the cheese and basil. Turned out amazing definitely going to be a weekly meal. I also added broccoli, left overs were just as good as well. Very flavorful and earthy highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe was super delicious!  I added more garlic, olive oil (thin out sauce just a bit), cheese and a few extra basil leaves to sauce and I changed most of the vegetables to ones we prefer (red bell peppers, zucchini, mushroom, peas, and onions) but everything together tasted so yummy and fresh!

OMG this was amazing! I didn't have any olives and didn't add roasted red peppers bec my son doesn't like spicy.  I added a little more olive oil to the pasta and to the pesto mixture. Other than that, no other changes. Even my picky little eater loved it! WOW! Thank you!

Delicious and so fast to pull together!  Used fresh basil from the garden and grapeseed oil for the pesto.  Also increased veggies by about 50% across the board and then used all the pesto.  Added half the pesto to the veggies and mixed in thoroughly, then added the penne and the rest of the pesto.  The flavor was just right for us.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Literally just finished cooking! this is awesome! I did not use the kalamata olives, but i did grill the pepper, asparagus and zucchini! yum yum yum, I also skipped the lemon, partially because i forgot, and this was the first time i made pesto. Other than a little struggle with the food processor, so easy! definitively a new favorite!

Really delicious.  It’s an easy work night meal (especially when working with pre-sliced veggies) or dinner party.

I liked it. I left out the pepper and zucchini and put cucumber in. It was ok it needs the pepper but the cucumber was good. I used a premade pesto and it turned out fine.

This was so yummy! It was fast and easy too. The only change I made was to substitute spinach for asparagus.
