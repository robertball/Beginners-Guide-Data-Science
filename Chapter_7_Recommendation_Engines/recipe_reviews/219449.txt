I really liked this--just be sure to watch it or it could burn if it bakes too long.  It took about 20-25 minutes for our topping to get brown enough, 30 minutes would have been too much.  The main thing I liked is that you don't feel like you're eating pure sugar.  The peaches shine, and if you wanted to add a small scoop of vanilla ice cream to it you won't blow your diet.  Pecans would also make a nice addition.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This is SO much better than regular peach cobbler. It doesn't give me that sick feeling from consuming too much sugar. I used honey in place of brown sugar and brown rice flour in place of the cornstarch in the peach mixture. I used half whole wheat and half brown rice flour, 4 TBL vegan butter, and slightly less white sugar in the biscuit mixture. Thanks so much for submitting, I will be using this for apple cobbler also!

super easy, whipped this up while the hubby was bbq-ing some chicken. substituted splenda for sugar, and didn't notice any sweetener-taste. the dough was nice and crumbly, and the peaches weren't overly sweet. i'd definitely make this again, and i'd likely add raspberries or something else to give it a little twist!

I didn't have whole wheat flour, but I did like that it is lower in sugar. Best peach cobbler I've ever made!

Mine cooked in 20 minutes - so watch it carefully - love this recipe - not too sweet like many cobblers, I used 1/4 t of nutmeg, I was out of lemon juice - I used a bit of orange juice instead - loved it.  I also cut back on the butter a bit using 5 tablespoons and it was still good - may try to go even lower next time to see if I can get away with it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it's a definite keeper.

Loved this!  Used even less sugar than the recipe called for, left out the white sugar, and none for the top.  That's what probably is making everyone's topping burn.  Mine was fine at 30 mins.  Cut the flour to half in the topping and added oats, I like a more substantial topping.

We have wonderful peaches here in Oregon, and I planned on making my usual cobbler when I had a surplus.  I'm thrilled that I tried this recipe instead, which makes a superb cobbler.  We all liked the balance between the topping and fruit and that it was not cloyingly sweet.  I made the recipe as directed, but used only 1 TBS brown sugar on top. This is a recipe I'll share and make over and over. Thank you!

I used Splenda brown sugar blend instead of regular brown sugar but used the same amount. Turned out fabulous! I had to give out thirds!

At last a peach cobbler that isn't sickenly sweet - otherwise we just can't eat it.  Thanks indeed for adding something to my files that is super.

I mixed a variety of fruits- 5 peaches needed using up, supplemented with frozen mixed fruits. It only needed 15-20 minutes to bake. I had put the timer on for 25 minutes, but at 20 minutes it was slightly burnt on the tips. Really easy recipe though. Served it up with the low fat Cool Whip.

I thought this was sort of on the bland side. I typically like these lightened up versions of classic dishes too. The topping just sort of tasted like a cake without any richness. The fresh peaches I thought would be great, but it seemed like they just were not seasoned or sweetened enough. I have not tried a lot of cobblers as I usually make crisps. I may just be accustomed to them. The dough soaks up too much of the sweet liquid. I made a couple of small changes to make it slightly healthier nothing completely recipe changing. I think, I will stick with my usual peach crisp recipe in the summer.

I used 12 peaches because I wanted a deeper dish cobbler. I increased the brown sugar and cornstarch accordingly. I didn't have quite enough flour so I threw in some oatmeal and used margarine instead of butter. It took about 25 minutes to bake and got rave reviews by everyone who tasted it!

My husband and I loved it! I used Splenda instead of the sugar and the Splenda brown sugar blend instead of the brown sugar to lower the calories even more. I also had to use frozen peaches, but don't listen to the conversion tables online as I bought much more than I needed. It sure makes dieting a little easier when you can have a treat like this!  :-)

This is pretty easy and turned out beautiful. I agree with other reviews that this is plenty sweet if your peaches are sweet. If they're not very sweet you can sprinkle a lil sugar on them before dropping the batter on top. Wish I could post my pic but this site doesn't make it easy, image from my iphone is too small. lame. I'll be making this again. Thanks for posting!

I liked the syrup. It wasn't overly sweet and that let the peach stand out, but my family was disappointed in the crust. There wasn't much and it wasn't very crispy. Next time I'm going to try a more traditional topping but I'll probably do the filling the same.

I made a Peach/Mango Cobbler using this recipe for a Thanksgiving dinner and party and it was a hit! No fresh fruit was available so I did have to use frozen fruit from a bag, which may have added a little more juice then I needed… I will drain off some of the liquids next time. I cut the mango chunks in half to make them thinner. This recipe is quick and simple and tasted great (I also made a Peach/Mango Pie)

Not bad.  The topping was fabulous.  Our peaches weren't terribly sweet to begin with, so we probably should have added some sugar, but I think with sweeter peaches, this amount would have been fine.  Family loved it.

The directions are wrong. Mine completely burned in about 22 minutes. I smelled burning and went to the oven and sure enough, burned. The recipe may be ok but if the directions are wrong than it's not a good recipe.

Excellent! Just the right amount of sweetness and the topping was delectably light and crisp.  I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour and, since I was using what I could salvage from a bunch of seconds/bruised peaches, I went by weight instead of number of peaches. Two pounds does it. And don't bother peeling the peaches, for heaven's sake! Oh, and thick chunks work just fine.  :) I will be making two 6-quart pans of this for a community dinner and will report back on making it for a crowd.

My daughter and I went peach picking and when we got home to make this recipe, I discovered that we were out of butter! I substituted unsweetened applesauce and left off the final sprinkle of brown sugar and it turned out amazing! The topping became cake like but very moist and fluffy and not too sweet. It soaked up the juice from the peaches just right. My non-sweet tooth husband loves it as do I. Will make it the same way again.

I love this recipe. It's simple and the results are great. As did others, I baked it for 20 minutes after adding the dough. Also, I used ground ginger rather than nutmeg.

Love this lower sugar recipe...just sprinkled about 1/2 teaspoon brown sugar on the top instead of what was recommended.   The biscuit topping tasted like a yummy cake, but I would add some oatmeal to the top to make it more crunchy.   Very delicious...would make it again!

I made as is, but drained most of the liquid that accumulated when baking just the peaches (before putting the topping on).  Other than that, I followed the recipe as is and it was incredibly good.  My whole family loved it.  Said it was better than any they had, even from a restaurant.  Served it warm with a small scoop of French Vanilla ice cream on top.

I loved this! I found this recipe in search for a peach cobbler that wasn't loaded with sugar. Tastes way better than regular peach cobbler in my opinion! I made it out of peach season so I had to use canned peaches but it still turned out great. Everyone who tried it loved it. I will definitely make it again

Wonderful recipe, and uses way less sugar than most.  You don't even miss it though.  The only change I made was to use fresh grated nutmeg and an additional teaspoon of baking powder to make the topping a bit fluffier.  Serve with good quality vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt-YUM!

I will make this cobbler again. Loved the lower sugar and that the peaches were the star not the topping. I did not make the sugar mixture to sprinkle on top because I had some left from another recipe. I used less and it was still sweet. It may have kept the topping from burning as sugar turns to carbon at high temperatures.

I find that adding white/brown sugar or just plain wheat  in fruit cobbler dessert usually does not work for me taste-wise cause I can get fresh picked fruit in my area and I  like ice cream or yogurt with it. I always trying to find a way to cut back added sugar without messing up the structure cause I like a nice biscuit topping; plus I am always looking for ways to use other grains and nuts instead of the empty, lacking.  boring wheat. So.... I will take this recipe and modify it but if anyone out there has already done that please share.

Healthy and pretty good. Used the butter and sugar but replaced the flour for my own whole grain half oat and half wheat flour that i milled with my vitamix. used half peaches and half nectarines from our fruit share....really good. could have added in red cherries or some other fruit like plum probably and would have tasted good too. probably stay with half nectarines and half peaches...good combo...could do all peaches but probably not all nectarines. evan says 'love it.' had it for breakfast

Baked at 20 minutes instead of 30. The 425 temp really cooks it up fast. Used fresh Georgia peaches-only the best! Definitely could add some oats in the topping for a little more substance. Most definitely a win for the entire family.

This was absolutely wonderful, made exactly as presented, will definitely make again.  I used frozen peaches I had picked this summer, let them defrost first and then proceeded as instructed.  I love finding low sugar alternatives for recipes.

This was bursting with flavour!!!! So delicious and I didn't know it was "healthier" because it tasted SO good!!! I was able to make it healthier by using 4Tbsp butter and not 6Tbsp - only complaint...not enough servings!

Awesome!  I thought 425º was too high for my glass dish, so I baked it at 350º for 30 minutes and it was just right.

Yummy! This is now my go-to peach cobbler recipe. You can really taste the peachy goodness. I didn't have whole wheat pastry flour, so I just used regular old all-purpose.

I make the original version of this recipe a few times every year when the peaches on my tree are ripe.  I don't know that I even taste the difference from the original recipe.  THANK YOU for adding this modified recipe as a separate recipe so we didn't have to sift through the comments.  I will be making this again soon!
