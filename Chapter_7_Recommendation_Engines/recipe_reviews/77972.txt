Truly the best chowder I have ever had!  I forgot to pick up some clam juice but added 2 extra cans of clams for the missing juice and I wish we had left-overs.

Delicious! I followed this recipe almost exactly. The only changes were extra bacon, and a little extra cream. I served these with Rosemary Drop Biscuits by FrackFamily5 for a very tasty meal.

I like my clam chowder to be meaty, so I might add another can of clams in the future.

Famly loved it and I have two little boys and a husband who does not particularly like seafood.  I served it in a sourdough bread bowl and it was a hit.

Too many potatoes in my opinion. Overall a good chowder. Everyone in the family enjoyed it.

I used skim milk to lighten it a bit.  Sacrificed some of the rich thickness you would get with cream, but the results were still great, and the flavor was outstanding.  I recommend adding a dash or two of hot sauce!

This was good but I think a bit bland.  I was searching for a thick creamy recipe like in restaurants. While it's thick, it's not creamy thick in my opinion.  I think it needed something else too.

We love clam chowder so I tried this recipe because of the reviews but We didn't care for it too much. It was bland and didn't taste too much like clam chowder. It tasted more like potato soup. I don't think I'll be making this recipe again.

Flavor of this Soup was excellent however,  not as much clam flavor as I like for a clam chowder.
