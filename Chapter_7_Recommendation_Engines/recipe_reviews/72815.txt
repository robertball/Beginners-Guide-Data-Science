OUTSTANDING!  I followed reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 cup less sugar, more cherries, added a tsp of Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus spice blend, and a tsp of vanilla.  I also used half white sugar and half Sugar in the Raw, because I like its richness in baked goods.  I made one-and-a-half of the recipe for the cobbler part because I like mine with lots of the good stuff.  I used a cherry pitter, so from start to finish the prep time took less than 20 minutes.  The finished product is fantastic.  The taste and texture of the cakey part of the cobbler is just sublime.  This is the one to try if you're looking for a good cobbler recipe!!

Wonderful!  I picked up a pail of Door County Wisconsin cherries while on vacation and have made this four times  (for myself and to share with others)  I did add one additional cup of cherries.  It's almost like "magic" how the cobbler forms!

Someone at work gave me a tip on how to pit cherries--use a drinking straw.  Just hold the cherry flat on a plate, push the straw into the cherry, then pull the cherry up over the straw.  The pit remains on the end of the straw.  It worked great--(much better than my $10 cherry pitter.)

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I hate to give something a bad review but I really did not like this recipe. I expected cobbler to have a biscut-like drop dough. This is more like a sponge cake or an upside-down cake. The end result was good, a little too sweet but definetly not cobbler. sorry.

Thank you for this recipe -- it has been a huge hit.

We have a Montmorency cherry tree and I've been looking for ways to enjoy these tart cherries.

After reading all previous reviews, I edited the recipe to follow the majority:
1. changed amount of cherries from 2 cups to 4 cups
2. added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour/sugar/baking powder/milk mixture.

I used sweet cherries and also halved both sugar amounts. Very tasty. I used 2% milk which worked great. I also added 1 t. vanilla in with the milk, and sprinkled cherries with cinnamon, brown sugar, and cocoa powder. Thanks a lot!

Wow - easy and delicious! Plus it uses "fresh" fruit vs. canned which makes a huge difference.  For the batter I got away with using 1/2 cup of sugar vs. a whole cup and like others I added a bit of cinnamon. I used buttermilk vs. milk and added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of almond extract. While I poured the batter into the 9x13 dish I kept thinking, "Is this really going to be enough?" and while it spread thin, in the end it was plenty. I doubled the amount of fresh cherries and even though my hands looked like something out of a horror flick it was worth it. I just might have to try this with fresh peaches or blueberries. I tossed the cherries with 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. This baked up beautifully in 55 minutes! I sprinkled the top with a bit of powdered sugar and served it with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream  - YUMMY!

Sour cherries are in season & we’re fortunate to have an orchard full of them quite close.  (They also offer free cherry pitting to boot!)  This cobbler recipe is easy & really delicious.  Like other reviews suggest, we doubled the sour cherries (4 cups), added 1 tsp. vanilla extract & ½ tsp. cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper!  Addition:  Please note the extra cherries could add additional cooking time (ours was about 20 min.).

Delicious! What a wonderful, quick easy recipe! I added a lot of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, as well as a big dollop of maple syrup to the batter, and it was great! My hubby raved and raved about it. And my three-year-old could happily lick the batter because it didn't contain eggs! I will definitely being making this again! - Many, many thanks!

Wonderful! this was a huge hit... got future hubbie to pit the cherries! 
I used only 3/4 cup sugar in the base and only 1/2 cup in the cherries - and it was wonderful.  Served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!!!

This recipe was quick and easy! It was my first FRESH cherry cobbler.  I have always made it with pie filling.  This is SO much better!  Loved it and will definitely make it again SOON!  It was a hit with the family too.

This was very yummy.  I made this with the cherries off the trees in my backyard -  which made it extra special.  For the batter I substituted 1 cup of packed brown sugar for the white sugar and it gave it a really nice flavor!

I agree that this is more of a sponge cake with cherries than a cobbler but it still is good with a few changes. Definately use 1/4 cup of butter and an 8x11 baking pan. You will need to bake this for the 50-60 minutes suggested if you use the smaller pan. I used half white and half brown sugar for the batter and I added 1 tsp. vanilla extract,1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. The milk I used was skim milk. I used 3 cups of cheeries, 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and approximately 1/4 cup or less of white sugar as I used Bing cheeries which are already very sweet. I would substitute lemon juice for the almond extract if using blueberries or blackberries and adjust sugar accordingly. When it came out of the oven I sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar. Fantastic on its own or with ice cream. See you at the gym to work this lovely dessert off?

This was a very easy recipe and turned out great!!!  As usual, I tweeked it a little.  I added 1/4 tsp. of almond extract and a tsp. of lemon zest to the cherry mixture.   I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the cake mixture.  Finally, I topped the cobbler with a streusel mixture which is as follows:  1/2 c. brown sugar; 1/2 c. flour; 1/2 c. oats; 1/4 c. melted butter, 1/4 c. sliced almonds and 1/4 c. shredded coconut.  I am very happy with the way this turned out and will definitely be making it again.   Oh yeah, it is so definitely worth it to use fresh cherries!!!!

Unbelievably delicious!  I followed the advice of others and added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter.  I used less sugar and mixed white with brown, since I used bing sweet cherries.  Next time I will use slightly less butter, maybe 1/3 cup.  I put this in an 8x11 dish and it turned out perfectly thick.
Try this, you will not be disappointed!

Man, I messed this up six ways to Sunday. The cherries were Bing & were huge & I used too many. The batter didn't rise but turned out more like a butter toffee candy bar intersected by semi-deflated cherries the size of plums. My bad. Am I eating it? Uh, hell yeah! Even made incorrectly, it still tastes awesome:o)

Very easy and flexible recipe.  Because this uses fresh fruit which is highly variable you will need to adjust sugar, I picked and pitted my cherries immediately before making this and my cherries were tart enough to make my mouth pucker, I used the 3/4 cup of sugar in my cherries but had closer to 2 3/4 cups of cherrries.  Perfect sweetness for my taste. My cherries were especially juicy and thus made more of a sauce on the bottom of the pan, more like an upside down cobbler.  I have made this with "drier" cherries and it turns out as more of a "studded" with cherries cake, pouring the batter into the hot butter makes nice crispy, chewy edges.   I do  decrease the sugar in the cake by 1/3cup as I like my desserts not overly sweet.  So taste your cherries, adjust sugar accordingly and enjoy.  This is a keeper.

I should have suspected it wouldn't be good when I melted the butter in the dish.....way too much butter! The edges were extremely tough from so much sugar in the batter and from being "deep-fried" in the butter. Also the edges tasted very salty from the butter. I like the idea of the recipe but don''t know how it could be fixed. I agree with other reviewers that the dough was very pastey, almost gooey even though it was fully cooked.

Delicious coffee cake-like cobbler. Sour cherries are a must! I only had 1½ cups of cherries, so I cut the recipe down to 3/4 and baked it in a 9x9-inch pan. I sprinkled sliced almonds over the top before baking, both because I love cherries with almonds and because I think it looks pretty. I dusted the top with powdered sugar and served it with whipped cream.

This was a huge hit with the folks at work.  I substituted peaches for the cherries and made it for my tatting group and they loved it.  Great easy recipe.  
I made 3 minor changes/additions - I added a beaten egg and a dash of vanilla to the batter and used self raising flour instead of the all-purpose flour and baking powder.  1 serving is less calories than an average candy bar.  Two thumbs up for this recipe.

I was surprised that this was to go in a 9x13 as it seemed to be a small amount of batter and cherries for that size. But I went ahead and followed the directions, and sure enough it was flat with the cherries all spaced out. It would have fit better in a 9x9. It really was almost inedible and I certainly wouldn't call it a cobbler.

Not sure the pan size is right because it was very very thin, but OMG the flavor was wonderful.  I didn't change anything except used both brown sugar and white sugar to stir into the cherries.  I was so excited today when I saw the first sour cherries at the farmers market, and I wasn't disappointed by the recipe I used to showcase them!  Nice and buttery, sweet and tart...what more could you ask for!

Pretty good, but the 3/4 cup sugar added to the cherries was too much. Next time I'll cut back to 1/2 cup.

Tried this recipe, and it was very good, but don't bake it that long!  A toothpick inserted into a cobbler should NEVER come out clean... that's more of a fruit bar.

Excellent recipe! Made a few changes: doubled it, cut the sugar by about a quarter, substituted full-fat coconut milk for most of the conventional milk, sprinkled toasted almond slivers on top just before baking.

Slammin, bangin, awesome, delicious were the adjectives used when I served this to friends & family! I followed the recipe with a few small changes.  I added a pinch of kosher salt to the batter ingredient.  Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar to the fruit ingredients and added fresh grated nutmeg and cinnamon.  I baked it in an 8 x 8 pan (9 x 13 just seemed too big) after 30 minutes I sprinkled sugar on top and returned to oven for another 20 mins.  Will surely be making this again.

I made this three times this summer. Once with just cherries, once with peaches, and once with half plums/cherries and it is a great recipe! Soooo easy and come out perfect each time.

Very Good. Easy to make.  Only used half of the sugar and it's sweet enough.  Can't stop eating it!

This recipe is not fool-proof, I guess. I am not sure what I did wrong, but the bottom was very hard. It was like all the sugar sunk to the bottom and then carmalized after baking. It still tasted good, just was difficult to eat without using a knife. I added vanilla extract and a little cinnamon for flavoring and used about 1/4 cup less sugar overall. I think if I made this again I would first put the cherries in the baking dish, then the cobbler part on top of them. Maybe that would help the hardness on the bottom???

This was a good starting point. Very easy and quick. I will make mine in a smaller pan next time. I used a bigger one and it was long and thin. I like thick cobbler.  I added tsp. vanilla and used nutmeg (allergic to cinnamon). The rest I did exactly. I am still going to try a few others on here that I found to see how they compare; but I still really enjoyed this recipe. Thank you.

Overall good.  I cut down on the sugar with the cherries because are cherries are sweeter than most.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I doubled the amount of cherries, and it worked very well.
I also tried a pineapple version, using brown sugar instead of white, and it was even better.
Both times I reduced the sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup, and the sugar on the fruit to 1/2 cup.  I used sweet cherries, and canned crushed pineapple.

I made this for dinner last night. Based on the reviews that I read and the fact that we do not like our dessert too sweet I did make a couple of changes. I doubled the cherries to 4 cups, I did 1 1/2 times the recipe for the top and cut the sugar almost in half.  I added cinnamon and vanilla based on the majority of reviews that I read. 
The butter bubbled up around the sides of the pan, spilled out in the oven and resulted in a tough texture on the edges of the cake.  This would be better defined as an upside down cake rather than a cobbler. It was just ok and I will not make this again. I bake regularly and my family felt that in comparison to what I normally bake they would rate it a 2 or a 3 out of 5.

This was delicious.  Very sticky though.  I put it in a 8 1/2 round baking dish and it overflowed.  Luckily, I had put it on a baking sheet before hand.  Happily, though, what stayed in was fabulous.

This was a wonderfully simple recipe! I had everything needed already in the kitchen and back yard! We just moved to a house with cherry trees and I have never made a cobbler before. The only thing I would change is more cherries. I was in a hurry to make this so didn't read the reviews that suggest to do so. All in all a fabulous recipe and definitely recommend!

Great recipe!  Followed it to a tee and baked for 55 min. The corners were almost caramelized and absolutely delicious!  We had some sour pitted cherries frozen back from last summer that when thawed had about 1/4 cup of juice.  Poured that on after placing the cherries on the batter. Definitely a keeper!

SUPER easy.  I picked the cherries from my own trees and pitting them was the hardest part.  I had a bunch of unexpected company show up the evening I made this and it was all gone before I could blink!  Will definitely make again!

Excellent as is, but better if you add more cherries.  I use four cups or cherries and add a little cinnamon to them and a little vanilla to the batter.  I've also made this using blueberries and blackberrie with excellent results.

This is a super easy cobbler and very yummy! As suggested in other comments I added cinnamon and I was very happy with that decision. Canned or fresh peaches can be substituted for the cherries. When using canned peaches do not add the extra sugar but pour some of the juice over the cobbler. Very delicious!

This is a great cherry cobbler recipe. It can be used for a variety of fruits - just tried blueberry tonight. The best part is that it is so easy and wholesome - so much better than powdered baking mixes. It can be made in a pinch - so it's a great dessert for dinner guests.

I live in Michigan and it's tart cherry season!  It's a very short season, so I picked cherries this morning and was looking for different ways to use them when I ran across this recipe.  Because of the many reviewers that stated the cobbler part was sparse, I added 1 1/2 times the amount of ingredients listed.  Adding the 1/2 t. cinnamon & 1 t. vanilla with 1/2 t. almond extract.  I also took their suggestions and used 4 cups of fresh cherries instead of the 2 cups, but kept the sugar added to 3/4 cups as written.  Lastly, I sprinkled the sliced almonds on top just before going into the oven.  I give this 4 1/2 stars...it was very good and I would make it again.  You gotta love those fresh tart cherries!

Great recipe and very easy to alter.  I had 6 C of fresh cherries on hand so I increased the ingredients by half.  Also, took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the sugar and added vanilla but should have cut way back on the butter.  I used a 10X13 baking dish and baked for 55 min.  It came out almost custard-like but very yummy!  Will cut back the butter next time around.

Here are my changes and it came out great! I work with police officers and they couldn't get enough of it!
I used 5tbs of butter, 2 Cups flour, 1 1/2 Cups sugar, 2 Tsp baking powder, 2 tsp all spice, 2 tsp cinnomon, 2 Cups milk, and almost 3 whole cans of cherries. I baked it in a 9X13 pan for 1 hour 10 mins @345 but my oven runs a little hot...  hope this helps for those of you wanting to cook it in the bigger pan.

i followed the recipe completely except for only adding extra cherries. after an hour and 45 minutes, it still wasn't done, but i took it out anyway. ironically, my family loved it! they had never had cobbler before, and they loved the custard-like texture. i will try again to see if i can make a "true" cobbler though in the future.

While making this recipe, I discovered my oven was out of propane, so I cooked it in my slow cooker. I put the batter in and set it on high for an hour.  Surprise--it was still good!  It had a crust around the edges and a gooey center.  It could have cooked longer, but I had very hungry book study participants.  I served it with vanilla greek yogurt on top.  Next time I'd like to try it in the oven!

I do more cooking then baking.  Note: Don't bake on the bottom shelf of the oven.  I had fresh sour cherries from our farm share.  Bought a cherry pitter from Bed, Bath, & Beyond.  My family is eating healthier so we tried this recipe using Splenda for all the white sugar.  The recipe was good but had that sweetner aftertaste.

I followed others advice and doubled the cherries and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. instead of 1 c.  This was pretty good, but I think a crumble would've been a better use for the cherries.

Good flavor . I used 1/4 cup butter as suggested instead of the 1/2 c. Sprinkled a little cinnamon on top. It seems like there is alot of cake for only 2 cups of cheries. So next time i am going to try 4 cups cherries. Maybe some almond extract mixed into the cherries too? I baked it in a 8 X 8 inch glass baking pan. We liked this and will be making it again. Thanks.

This recipe was terrific! I did double the cherries to 4 cups, added cinnamon to the batter and almond extract to the cherries...It came out wonderful. I will definately make this again.

An excellent recipe. I doubled the cherries to 4 cups and next time will use 1/4 cup less sugar. Good hot or cold, and freezes well.

Wow! This was so easy and so tastey.  The sponge like topping was just as I remember it from my childhood. We did add cinnamon, nutmeg and hint of pure almond extract to the cherries. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe using basic ingredients - appreciated and used the suggestions to reduce sugar, increase cherries, and add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  My family loved it!

We have a cherry tree in our back yard and I was always looking for a quick and easy recipe to use the cherries.  I found it!  My husband and I made this last night and it was great.  I took the suggestions to add some cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to the batter.  We both rated it 5 stars.

This is what my mother used to make in the summer with fresh cherries.  We didn't call it cobbler however, as it didn't have a biscuit topping. It is called a baked cherry pudding. it's delicious.  I add almond extract to the cake portion.

Very good!  Like others, I used doubled the amount of cherries (4 cups, using sweet cherries since that was all that was available, used half the amount of sugar, and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the cherry mixture.  It was a big hit.  Since I did not have a cherry pitter, I cut the cherries in half to remove the pit, and it actually worked out well.

This recipe was pretty good. I didn't find any tart, pie, or sour cherries so I used regular. If you do use regular cherries, I would recommend not adding any extra sugar to them, they will be fine the way they are. I doubled the amount of cherries for a little more flavor, and it was perfect. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough crust to cover the cherries, so next time, instead of using four cups of cherries, I will use three cups!

Absolutely perfect cobbler recipe. Very sweet so I do recommend lowering the sugar amount by about a half cup if that is something you worry about...still cooks beautifully and tastes amazing!

Incredible! I used 3 cups Bing sweet cherries, and only 1/2 cup sugar in with them. NEVER have a heard people rant and rave over a dessert as much as this one. Will be making again,  and soon!

Turned out pretty good. But the cobler turned out to be cherries in sponge cake. Good, but not what I expected.

This got rave reviews from the kids. I loved the chewy part right at the edge. While I prefer cobbler dough to be a bit more biscuit-y, I'd definitely make this again, maybe changing up the fruit a bit. I could also see using the frozen pitted cherries as well.

I had some grocery store bing cherries to use up - perfect in this recipe!  Few things I did differently: 1/4 cup butter, 3 cups of cherries & sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before I put it in the oven.  Awesome!!!

I have 2 cherry trees in our yard-so I needed to make a recipe that used fresh cherries! This was really good. I used less butter (1/2) as others have suggested and did 1 1/2 times the amount of the dough, and more fresh cherries. I agree with the person that said that the dough was not like a bisciut, but more 'sticky'. But when my husband got home he raved about it. We brought it to our local winery (we live out in the South Bay in CA)where we have picnics and shared the cobbler-everyone loved it! So I'm making it again to bring tonight! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the guidance of others and reduced the sugar a bit, and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cobbler batter.  I used probably five or six cups of cherries too - and it was divine.  I made this for a family party, and it was wolfed down - no leftovers and no one got seconds!  I would definitely make this again.

Delicious. Used one cup extra cherries, halved the sugar (both times) 1% milk and 5 tablespoons butter.  Cooked for 55 minutes and it came out perfectly. Simple! Thanks.

I only had a little more than a cup of cherries, so I halved the recipe and used an 8 X 8 baking dish. I also added a liberal amount of cinnamon (unmeasured, just guessed) to the batter to liven it up. Easy. A great recipe.

Delicious and buttery, but I think it could've used at least another cup of cherries (there were about 3-4 cherries per serving) and it was really, really sweet. I would cut the sugar to 1/2 cup or less. I had a lot of leftover sugar after mixing with cherries. I couldn't believe how nicely it baked without any eggs.

This was pretty good, but we like juicy.  Next time I will add some water to the cherries and cook until slightly thickened, pour in the baking dish and then the batter on top.

Great recipe, although I will do some thing different next time. I agree that it's too sweet as is and will cut about 3/4 of a cup of sugar out of it next time. I also will use another whole cup of cherries. (I used frozen cherries that were already pitted so it saved a lot of time.) It's yummy with whipped cream, but also delicious with a splash of heavy cream poured onto it. Thanks for the excellent use of cherries!

Good, but too sweet. I should have done as other reviewers suggested and halved both sugar amounts. The cherries retain their flavour nicely, which is not my general experience when baking with them. Used gluten-free flour, and it turned out to be a nice cake-like dish. Got very soggy the next day though - if I make this again I will make sure we have company so it all gets eaten while it's still warm.

One of the easiest recipes I've tried in a while and it was decadent. No one would believe how easy it was to make it. The only change I made to the original recipe was to roll the cherries in brown sugar and white sugar

Excellent! I made it gluten and dairy free for my son. It works well with soy flour and fruit juice instead of milk. Also, non-dairy butter. Yay!

I can not tell a lie... This is undoubtedly one of the easiest and best cherry cobbler recipes out there. I've made it twice in one week and this time I'm making two! We did increase the cherries to four cups. But mostly because we had a lot of cherries the first time and it seemed to work very well. Just lower the temp 20 or so degrees and cook it about 30 minutes longer. Yummmmmmmm E!

Very good.  I only got about 8 servings out of it...maybe I was too generous with the servings.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I used about total of about 4 cups...mix of frozen (but thawed)cherries and peaches.  You could use just about any fruit.  I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It is a keeper!

Delicious! I have never made a cobbler before but based on everyone who ate this, this is an AMAZING cobbler. That is a LOT of butter though...

This was wonderful! I love cobblers, so it is no surprise how much I loved this. It tasted just like I imagined, maybe better. Here are the adjustments I made: I used coconut oil instead of butter which was a wonderful flavor to incorporate, and made me feel better about what I was eating. I used only 1/2 cup white sugar for the batter, and only 1/2 cup white sugar for the cherries. I used sweet cherries and it was a perfect amount of sweetness. With the cherries I also added cinnamon, a splash of vanilla, and a drizzle of maple syrup. Best dessert I've ever made!

I followed the instructions to a T and it came out hard as hell on top and I couldn't get it out of the pan.   delicious though.  Probably won't make it again but happy I at least gave it a go.

Wish I read the reviews first.  Definitely needs twice the cherries and half the sugar.  I will try it again since we have a cherry tree brimming with fruit right now!

Made a big mistake the first time I did this recipe because I tried cutting it in half and I replaced the sugar with splenda (to make it diabetic friendly). It turned really hard and the cherries didn't sink in the batter. I redid the recipe with the original ingredients, but I added more cherries (used sweet cherries instead of sour) and also used blackberries, and I added cinnamon and vanilla extract like others recommended. I found that the butter taste was overwhelming (too much butter perhaps), it was good overall but I probably won't make it again.

This was different then what I would normally think of as cobbler, more like a cake, i felt. Either way, this was pretty darn tasty! Made with sweet cherries and a bit less sugar, very good. Will make again for sure.

This is 5 star!  I added sliced apples, cinnamon and vanilla as suggested by other reviews, increased all ingredients by one half to make up for the added apples, and left out all sugar (my hubs is trying to avoid sugar.)  It turned out amazing, reminds me of "french toast" consistency, although it is definitely better with a tsp of brown sugar added to each serving.  We decided to try adding some brown sugar over the top near the end of cooking time next time- WILL make this again!

I took the suggestion to add vanilla and cinnamon to the mixture.  I also altered the amount of sugar in the recipe- my alterations: 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup raw sugar to the batter.  1/4 white sugar to cherries.

The steps for this cobbler were easy enough--my 12 year old and 2 year old worked together to make it.  We used about 4-5c cherries; so between the extra juice and all of that sugar, we ended up with carmelization on the sides of the pan.  We will try cutting the sugar and spraying the pan with cooking spray next time!  Overall, though, my family enjoyed this cobbler and we will make it again!

WAY TO MUCH BUTTER! Using fresh cherries, I was very excited. Taking the first corner bite while it was still warm, it oozed butter. I think 1/2 the butter & mixed into the batter would be much better. Made a batch for my neighbor, but could not bring it over. As I bought a ton of cherries, I will try again with my own suggestions & repost my results.

I made this recipe as written except I halved the recipe. The dough was tough and there was very little cherry flavor. We didn't care for it. I won't make again.

It's missing something alright. Namely, batter! 1 cup sugar, 1 cup flower and milk in a 9 by 13 is NOT enough batter. It ended up being a very very thin batter with far too much butter so that it was more like a brick hard (fried!) fritter. I'm going to stick to a biscuit type batter. This one was a waste of time, oven energy and ingredients.

I made this recipe with sweet cherries since they were in season and I had a ton!  This was very easy to make (aside from pitting all the cherries).  I cut back on the sugar by half since I was using sweet cherries and I added a little cinnamon when coating the cherries.  I think my oven is a little lopsided, because all the cherries sunk to one side...  A good recipe, but I think it is missing something, I just can't put my finger on it!

Awesome Recipe! I used half the butter and about 3 1/2 cups Cherries...The cobbler did get crunchy around the edges before it was done in the middle...I baked it for 45 minutes. Will definately make again!

My family raved about this recipe. I did make a few changes. I used a 9inch square pan because I only had about 2 cups of sour cherries like the recipe calls for it was plenty for this size pan.I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture and some lemon peel to the cherries otherwise everything else was the same. This is a simple and delicious cobbler.

I made these for a potluck I attended yesterday. They were very popular! I did make changes based on others comments. I used 1/2 cup butter (but I was sopping butter out of the pan halfway through the baking so I would recommend using half that) and used the whole 1 cup of sugar, but used 1.5 cup of flour, 1.5 tsp baking powder, and 1.5 cups of heavy cream (instead of milk). I used about 3-4 cups of cherries, but mixed them with the listed amount of sugar and flour. It was quite good, but I think I under-cooked it a bit, it was still a little soggy in the middle on the bottom of the pan. I think decreasing the butter would help that as well. A couple helpful suggestions: I cut most of the cherries in half after pitting them, to help cover the majority of the surface. Mix the cherries really well with the flour, this helps them to not sink to the bottom of the pan. Also, the recipe says to "pour" the batter into the pan, but the batter was really think, so instead I dropped big dollops of it around the pan then used my hands to spread it out, some of the butter got in between and on top of the batter, but it didn't seem to be a problem. Will definitely make again with half the butter.

I've made this 3 times in a week (bumper crop of tart cherries this year) and it's delicious but not consistent.  As others suggested I halved the butter, doubled the cherries, cut back on the sugar and added some cinnamon to the batter.  I also added extract (vanilla to two, almond to the other) and almonds to the top (2 tablespoons, sliced or slivered).  People have gobbled it up all three times so the lack of consistency is in how it looks and not in how good it is.  The first time no cherries stayed on top.  The other two times it looked more like the one in the photo here.  Strange since I did the same thing all three times with cherries from the same tree.  Anyhow, this is a good basic recipe for cobbler that I'm sure I'll make again and with other fruits.

THIS IS A GREAT BASE RECIPE.  I ADDED CINNAMON AND THE MELTED BUTTER TO THE BATTER MIX, VANILLA TO THE CHERRIES, AND DID CHERRIES ON THE BOTTOM WITH THE BATTER ON TOP.  EVEN MY SON, WHO IS NOT A CHERRY FAN, ENJOYED THIS ONE.

This is a great recipe!  Best to use a cherry pitter though to make the job easier.  Also recommend cutting back on the sugar otherwise it's a bit too sweet.

Sorry but we definitely did NOT like this. The cherries did not cook through even after cooking it 10 minutes extra. They were a weird texture, almost like grapes. I cut the butter down by half and it was still WAY TO GREASY... a spongey bland cake swimming in butter with half cooked cherries. I prefer a crisp or a crumble over this anyday.

All was set for what appeared to be a great recipe. I used 4 cups cherries,  added a bit of almond extract to the cherries and cinnamon to the batter - as others suggested. The only problem was that even 45 minutes was WAY to long of a baking time for my oven. The cobbler burned and sugar baked up the sides of the pan- it is soaking in the sink as we speak. What a disappointment after pitting all of those cherries! Watch your cobbler carefully when baking.

This cobbler is easy to make.  The topping is a little too buttery and softer than I expected.  Served warm with a scoop of ice cream made it taste better. I used Bing cherries instead because they are more readily accessible.  It was good, and I might try it again.

Didn't change a thing other than halving the recipe.  Awesomely good!  I will save this to make again! Definitely better than canned cherry pie filling, even if pitting the cherries do stain your fingers.  YUM!!!

Substituted 5 fresh sliced peaches for the cherries.  Even using more than 2 cups of fruit, this was still predominantly biscuity.  I would prefer more fruit, but some of those that tried it liked it this way.  We had this with a dollop of Cool Whip.

Followed all the directions with all of the ingredients, including cherries picked at an orchard a couple days before.

I checked it at 35 mins in the oven (following the 350° F instructions) and it was already dark brown so I took it out. My oven is good at keeping heat, so I would start checking on it around the 30 min mark. Really tasty!

LOVE THIS RECIPE! DIDN'T HAVE SOUR CHERRIES SO I USED SWEET AND IT WAS PRETTY AND DELICIOUS. I WILL BUY SOUR CHERRIES NEXT TIME AND WILL ALSO TRY CANNED PEACHES.
IT IS WELL WORTH TAKING THE TIME TO PIT THE CHERRIES AS OTHER THAN THAT THE RECIPE TAKES NO TIME AT ALL.

Made cherry cobbler for the first time in my life at 2 AM during an episode of insomnia when I realized our cherries were about to go bad. Stayed up talking to my roommate while pitting the cherries, and together we waited eagerly in the results. It was delectable, but very sugary! Next time I may try to reduce the sugar content a tad. Absolutely will be a next time. Cheers

This recipe is fantastic, it turned out just the way a cobbler should turn out, moist and lovely texture with crispy edges and just the right amount of filling.  That having said, I did make some changes to this recipe.  First, I doubled the amount of flour, cherries, milk, and baking soda.  I kept the amount of sugar the same but it could have used a tablespoon or two more.  Second I did stir the cherries just a bit after pouring onto the batter to make a more even consistency.  I kept the baking time the same, and it turned out near perfect.  I have no idea how the original recipe would turn out with all that butter and only I cup flour.  I would not try it that way, I will continue to double the flour, milk and fruit

I love this recipe and agree tweaks are good to enhance its overall enjoyment y each individual. What makes it great is it is flexible!  The base recipe it there and is great! Hats off to the chef!  That said, I have a question for everyone.  I use frozen sour cherries I get from Michigan and of course, four cups of frozen cherries is way different from un-frozen and when thawed, there is a tremendous amount of liquid.  I fear using all of the liquid from the defrosted cherries in the recipe worruying it will be runny, but some is necessary.  Any ideas on how to adjust this matter so it works best?

Made this with blueberries instead of cherries (family preference) and it was incredible! My grandmother refused to believe that I made it from scratch and kept asking me to tell her what bakery I went to. Jeeze, thanks, Grandma!

DELICIOUS EASY This is as good and easy as most reviews say.
I followed recipe but added cinnamon and less sugar and touch of vanilla. Also more  like 3 cups cherries. So good to take as a dessert when going out,
except for cherries everything would be on hand. Just plan ahead. Cherries could be pitted ahead of time , I swear 15 minutes in morning and it's in the oven. I used paperclip method of removing pits . It works. 2nd review I have now bought a cherry pitter,,much faster. The Blueberry Cobbler is also delicious. So much easier than making a pie. Iloveit

There's not enough cherries in ratio to cake, the batter is too runny, making for a loose, weak cake result, and it's much too sweet.

This is a really easy basic recipe for all types of fruit, the fresher the better.  I want to emphasize the word EASY. This is the kind of dessert recipe that is perfect for a beginner, or for anyone who is short on time, but wants to serve a dessert that looks like you really went all out!  It also has the benefit of being very light. It's the perfect dessert to serve after a somewhat heavy dinner, particularly after beef. The changes I made were slight. I used fresh whole black sweet cherries, pitted the day before. I used close to three loosely packed cups of cherries. I determined the amount of sugar for the cherries by their taste alone, keeping in mind how much of a somewhat-tart contrast I wanted the fruit to be to the sweet light and airy cake they would be nestled in. There was some sugar and flour left in the cherry bowl that I sprinkled lightly over any cherries that lost their sugar going into the pan.  That's one tip I can give you; place the cherries one or two at a time into the prepared pan of batter with a spoon. Try to keep them evenly spaced and don't roll them in the batter. Make sure they still have sugar clinging to the tops. For desserts like this one, I recommend a glass baking dish.  This dessert is perfect with a scoop of homemade custard based vanilla ice cream. Everyone will love it, so if you're baking for a lot of folks, I'd suggest you make two pans, because people will want seconds!

One of my new favorites! Perfect with vanilla ice cream, tastes like an old-fashioned cobbler, something grandma would throw together on a weeknight. 
--Somewhat like a pineapple upside-down cake texture, all caramelized around the edges. Am trying it with peaches and blackberries today, will let you know how that goes.

Amazing and really easy except for pitting cherries. A friend recommended frozen cherries and I may try that next time.  I look like I had murdered somebody after pitting those cherries. I added extra cherries and some cinnamon but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was soooooo good. Served with vanilla ice cream while still hot.

I have made this many times.  The best part is that you can use any fruit.  I've used blueberries, raspberries, rhubarb, and even a mixture of fruit.  They have all been great.  It is now my go to recipe for cobbler of any kind.

I made this when friends were visiting us from Florida.  Big hit.  The only thing I would change is maybe letting the sugar sit on the cherries for an hour or so, because I like sweeter, but if you are not a big sweet eater, this recipe is delicious the way it is.

Not bad, but I prefer a more biscuit-like texture to my cobbler. This was more like cherry cake. It tasted ok, but didn't come out as good as I was hoping.

Came out perfect.  Followed the recipe to a "T" and family loved it.  Used Sweet cherries and about 3 cups (like lots of fruit).

I needed to make a desert really quick for a last-minute dinner I was invited to (I'm known for my desserts) - I didn't want to make the same old thing (brownies, cupcakes, etc as there are little kids involved) so I had a whole bag of cherries in the refrigerator and decided to look up cherry crisp or cobbler recipes and found this one - I followed other reviewers' suggestions and halved the sugar amounts and added vanilla and cinnamon - it totally does not look like it will be enough cobbler/cherry ratio, but it is absolutely wonderful - I will be using this recipe again and and again and giving the recipe to anyone who wants it in the future!  A definite keeper!

Love, love, love this recipe!  So easy, tastes so fresh.  My husband went crazy over it.  I couldn't find tart cherries, so I substituted 1 cup of frozen (thawed) sweet cherries with 1 cup of frozen (thawed) rhubarb for tartness.  It was perfect!

this is my go to fruit dessert. In a hurry I have used canned fruit and it works very well. I have used apples,pears, peaches and cherries.When the fruit is in season , I do prefer the fresh fruit. when using canned peaches I cut up the peaches first.I also add cinnamon to the batter and sprinkle it over the top before I bake it.We all love it.

Do Not use the 1/2 cup of butter the author suggests--it's about twice the amount necessary!
Also, Do add the vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg suggested by reviewers, otherwise, the batter will be tasteless.
I found that cooking til toothpick comes out clean is Too Long for a cobbler.
Also, the 9x13 pan is a bit large but some people found that the 8x8 is too small. I will try a 9x9 next time. 
More batter would fix the Large Pan problem.

We had a bumper crop of cherries this year ...so many in fact, that our tree lost 2 large branches from the weight of all the fruit...a lot of fast picking to save the fruit from the broken limbs(still a ton on the tree}and decided to try out this recipe first... Made it just like the recipe...OMG...had to rush out and get vanilla ice cream...thought it was amazing...I am scared to look at the calories...right now I'm just enjoying the flavor!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I used sweet cherries so I did not add as much sugar to the cherry mixture.  Will definitely use this recipe again.  Will try it with other types of fruit, as well.

Absolutely delicious!!!  Baked it today for Father's Day! Followed previous reviewers and made the following changes: 6 TBL. of butter instead of 1/2 c., 4 c. of fresh sour cherries instead of 2,(kept the sugar amts. the same with the increase in cherries), 1 tsp. pumpkin spice, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. almond extract, 1 tsp. salt...sprinkled a teaspoon of sugar over the top the last 5 min. of baking.

I made this recipe with my kids - my son pitted the cherries:)  My daughter says, "I liked it but I thought that it needed a little more cherries and a little bit more sugar.  Other than that it was a yummy snack to eat with cherries."  My son says, "You put in just the right amount of cherries and sugar."  Okay!  So I am in the middle it was just right.

This recipe has become a family favorite -- and I use it for more than cherries. It's great with blueberries and right now I have a peach version in the oven. It's easy and quick to prep. I have a large family and everyone loves it.

DELICIOUS! Made this with cherries straight from the tree, ones that were a little bitter from being there too long, and this turned out incredible. With ice cream, my family devoured a wholeeeee pan in 2 days.

This was my first cherry cobbler. I used fresh California grown cherries as they are in season right now. I am absolutely in love with this recipe. I didn't mind the extra time pitting the cherries. I did add a dash of cinnamon on top before putting in the oven. I consider myself to be a novice and this was super easy and scrumptious!

I followed the recipe.
I used cherries that I canned from
the tree I grew from bareroot stock.
Anyway, the recipe is easy and I
thought it was a good one.

Wow. My 12yo daughter called me at work to tell me she had picked cherries off the tree in our yard and wanted to make a dessert with them.  I did a quick search and pointed her to this recipe -- she made it  by herself and the whole family raved!!!!  She didn't change a thing, and it really tasted like cobbler to me!

This is fantastic...I don't know why people criticize it except that I used natural turbinado sugar (to taste). A neighbor down the street has a wonderful Montmorency cherry tree. No one except the birds seem too interested it its fruit so I asked permission to pick the cherries...in exchange for sharing some of what I made....picking them and pitting them took the longest obviously, but I used Martha Stewarts paper clip pitting technique and I got pretty fast at it (5 cups of cherries in one hour). Montmorency cherries are slightly sweeter than most sour cherries so require less sugar---and I have a real sweet tooth. Yet-- I can eat them right off the tree without puckering....so taste really is subjective. I baked it for only 40-45 min and it was golden and perfect. I like the buttery cakey texture...it makes it less dry like a lot of cobblers. I took 1/3 of it to the neighbors who let me pick their cherries and decided to make another....it's a sure hit with us! So so so Simple!!!! THANK YOU! ;)

So I'm new to cooking, in the case the name fooled you ;) but I tired this recipe and loved it! Like the others suggested, I halved the sugars (and substituted brown for the cherry mixture) and added some cocoa and cinammon. My only problem was that when i melted the butter then added batter, the butter floated to the top (which kinda defeated the purpose :/) and didn't cook well with the rest of the batter, so I ended up pouring a lot of it out. It still tasted great! Next time, I'll just halve the butter and pour the batter SLOWLY over it :)

I doubled the cherries, but used canned cherry's in water (Oregon Brand). I used the cherry juice/water to pour on top after everything was added in. I also would use 3/4 cup flour instead of 1 because it is too much of a cakey taste with 1 cup flour. I also baked it for 40 minutes and it was perfectly golden.

We made this recipe.  It was awesome.  We enjoyed the mixture of the tart cherries with the sugar that was added.  The crust is great.  This is one easy and quick recipe to make.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe! As others have stated I cut down the sugar in both parts and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I did add one more thing that my grandma taught me with most fruit desserts. I added a tsp of lemon juice, it just gives it that little extra flavor. I cook at a hunting ranch and the men just loved this.

This was good, but I wouldn't call it a cobbler. More like a cherry cake...

I had the worse experience with this recipe.  I followed the directions to a t!  The cherries were sticky and greasy and the cobbler part never set up right at all.  Idk...just wasnt my cup of tea.  Better luck to others.  Im gonna stick to dropping the batter on top.

Because I didn't follow the directions exactly, I gave its current average rating, just to tell others about my experience so they avoid creating the mess I baked.   I followed the recipe exactly--- except I halved everything and baked it in a smaller, round pan. Reviewers suggested using more cherries and less sugar, so I did that too. I added about 1/3 cup extra cherries probably? I also had to keep a close eye on the cobbler since I was baking an altered amount in an altered pan. I started off checking at about half the recommended time. I checked on it a couple more times before I finally took it out, so I doubt it failed from excessive heat loss due to opening the door to check on it. (My apt oven doesn't have a glass window or light sadly) I took it out when it was golden brown. The end result was not cakey or light at all. The cherries were quite sticky. It was very very chewy and greasy. The flavor seemed tasty but the texture was just too chewy & tough anywhere the cherry/sugar mixture was.   I would consider making this recipe again without halving the ingredients, but I would definitely caution anyone from trying to halve it.

Great recipe! Our crop of sour pie cherries were especially juicy and sweet this year, so I did reduce the sugar by a bit. I also added a scoop of chocolate whey protein powder just because it was on hand. I love how easy this recipe is!! I love melting the butter, stirring the batter, and just dumping everything in without any fuss. And it was delicious. I look forward to making it again!

made it w/ 4 cups of fresh sour cherries. halved the sugar. 4 stars for how easy to put together. it has to be one of the easiest recipes ive ever made. 3.5 stars for the taste. its good but needs something else. maybe vanilla? or spice? def sweet enough for me.

WOW!  All I can say is this was awesome!  A friend of mine gave me some sour cherries from her tree, so I went looking for a recipe to use them up.  I'm so glad I found this one!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of cherries (but left other quantities the same).  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter (forgot to add the vanilla as another reviewer suggested, but turned out great without it!).  It was the perfect combination of tart and sweet!  I've already made it twice, and I'm sure I'll be making it again!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe! :-)

I used 8-10 C. whole Bing cherries, which are sweeter, so used less sugar and some lemon juice.  It baked up just fine with the same amount of cobbler.  It did take 3 hours to pit all the cherries, even with a nifty pitter from Target.

Not bad, but a little on the sweet side. I did make some substitutions for allergies and I cut down the butter to 1/4 cup as suggested by other reviewers. I used Ghee(clarified butter) and soy milk in place of regular butter and regular milk. Over all,I really liked this cobbler. Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar or maybe I will use a 1/2 cup apple sauce and a half cup sugar in place of the 1 cup in the recipe. :) Over all, I am pretty pleased with how this turned out!

I made this for Father's Day as written and it was gone quickly.  I made again decreasing the sugar in the cake part by about 1/4 cup and used a combo of rhubarb, fresh cherries, strawberries, and raspberries from our garden.  It was delicious.  Even though the fruit is added on top it bakes in the cake nicely.  Best served fresh and warm!

This was very good!  My hubby is diabetic so I used sweet cherries and cut the sugar in half and then used half Splenda, half regular sugar.  It turned out a bit spongy (I've noticed that Splenda can do that to some cakes and bars), but the taste was great.  Oh, I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla extract to the crust.  Next time I will use double the cherries and may even put it in an 8x8 pan to make it come out a bit thicker.  That way each bite would have cherries.  Thank you!

Crunchy-on-top-old-fashion-goody!  I added 1/2t vanilla, a few drops of almond flavoring and baked in 7 x 11 pan.  Will add more cherries next time for decadence.

I did not care for this. I made it just as the recipe says no adjustments and the Cherries tasted great but the breading was soaked with butter and so sweet it was hard but sticky around the sides of the dish. I have braces and I could not eat it cause it would stick to my braces like candy.  I might as well mixed sugar and butter together and put cherries on top and ate it..   Sorry to be so harsh but it was bad.  :-(

This is the third year I have used this recipe.  I have two wonderful cherry trees and when they are ready to be picked I quickly find this recipe.  It is awesome, but I always double the amount of cherries called for.  My husband likes to have lots of cherries in the cobbler, and so does everyone else it seems.  Wonderful!

This is a great recipe!  After 7 years, my sour cherry tree produced a prolific amount of cherries this year.  I'm not a big fan of pie so the cobbler recipe was a welcome way to use my cherries.  Thanks also to whomever suggested pitting the cherries with a drinking straw.  It made pitting all those cherries easy.  I tweaked the recipe by doubling the amount of cherries, adding a 1/2 tsp. vanilla, an extra TBSP of flour and an extra 1/4 c. sugar to the cherries.

I just made this recipe with Door County cherries.  I omitted the 2nd amount of sugar, just mixxing the cherries with the 1 tbsp of flour.  It was very good, slightly tart.

Made with fresh Door County cherries, this was a huge hit!  My only change would be to cut back on the sugar added to the cherry topping, as it was sweeter than it needed to be.  I took the pan to the office and it was gone within the hour.

I followed the recipe, but used individually frozen cherries, slightly thawed, but I can't believe it would make that much difference.  The cobbler was half an inch high, and carmelized around the edges so that I couldn't even cut it.

Chewy and pasty.  Not something I would expect from a 4 1/2 star recipe.  I salvaged the cherries for left-overs but threw out the rest.

This turned out very good!  I wasn't sure at first reading through the directions how this would turn out.  The batter was very thin.  My husband loved it and took the rest into work the next day for his office.  I didn't have fresh cherries so I used frozen.  And I love cinnamon so I added 1/ tsp. to the batter.  Thank you for the recipe, I want to try it with other fruits!

I liked this cobbler a lot.  I doubled the cherries and cut back on the sugar and butter by 1/4 cup each.  It was a pain in the neck to pit all the cherries, but I would probably make this again.

This was exactly what I needed to use up the cherries. I took the advice of previous reviews and 1/2ed the sugar and added twice the cherries. I also doubled the batter ingediance. I like it cakey. It was great and really easy. 

Next time I will add vanilla to the batter.

Thanks

This was fantastic!  I made it this afternoon and fed it an hour later to 4 hungry preschoolers, and they loved it.  All had second helpings, and one asked for the recipe to give to her mother!

This recipe was really good! It turned out a little on the sweet side so I will cut back on the sugar a smidge the next time I make it.
Well worth the effort in picking and pitting the cherries on my tree! :)

This is my go to favorite cobbler.  I like a lot of 'crust' so I usually double the crust amount while leaving the cherries the same.

DELICIOUS! Followed a few suggestions from others... I used 1/2   white sugar and 1/2 Sugar in the Raw and added 1 tsp vanilla to batter.  I doubled cherry mixture...next time I'll drop back to 1-1/2 amount of cherry mixture.

So easy and amazing how perfect it comes out everytime.  I actually froze bags of cherries with the stem and pit.  On the day before I plan to make the cobbler I thaw the cherries and it makes the best cobbler.  I have made this several times and again it has come out perfect if you follow the recipe.

It’s not crumble, it is more like a pancake texture. 
For me it was just too sweet, I will reduce the amount of sugar next time.

Super easy to prepare and fast for a quick dessert.

This turned out well in spite of using sweet cherries (I didn't have tart ones on hand).  To compensate for this I cut back on sugar like others suggested, but also made a lemon frosting to drizzle over the top when done - this added the tartness I was missing to complement the sweet, and cherry and lemon flavors pair well in general...  To make the lemon frosting I simply added lemon juice to some powdered sugar and stirred  it up.

The first time I tried it it was very cakey (if that's a thing). I am trying it with a tsp lime juice in the cherries and 1.25 tsp baking soda in the batter and in the oven it is proofing up more and giving a crisper exterior thus far it looks good. I may try oatmeal with it next time just for kicks.

Made this according to directions except for doubling recipe. It's way too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut half the sugar out of crust and half out of fruit. I can tell if I'd done this it's a great recipe. It's good now, very easy.

Ty for the recipe I’ve been trying to figure out what else to do with my cherries. I’ve actually got a 25ft tall tart cherry tree on my property. I’ve already got enough cherry jelly & jam to last me the whole year. Plus I’ve got enough cherry pie filling in jars to get me though the year. But I’ve always wanted something else to do with them. Now I do ty so much for the recipe.

I don't recommend this. I did as others advised - added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the batter, reduced the butter, reduced the sugar - and it was just okay. The dough really comes out tough, like it would be better eaten with a knife and fork. A waste of good cherries, IMHO.

This dish is wonderful.  I made some of the changes suggested by others: used ½ cup of sugar in the flour mixture; added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon; used 4 cups of cherries.  I will make it again.

I’m not sure if the recipe was right, I followed it with the batter on the bottom and it was dense and doughy. All of the pictures look like the batter is baked on the top...

This is a salty sweet vacation for your mouth!  Soooooo good.  I substituted 1/2 cup of the sugar in the cobbler with 12 packets of truvia.  Tasted great!  I also didn’t mix the cherries with 3/4 cup sugar.  I only used 1/2 cup.  Still delicious!  I wouldn’t decrease the butter because the salty endnote really makes this spectacular.

I had fresh sweet cherries that needed to be used.  Fortunately,  I found this recipe.  I did increase the cherries to 4 cups; however, I think next time, I would maybe use 3 cups and cut some in half.  I also added, per other reviewers, cinnamon & vanilla extract to the batter and cut the sugar in both the batter and the cherry mixture. Cooked perfectly in 50 minutes; removed and sprinkled top w/ brown sugar and put under broiler for a couple minutes to caramelize.  I used 13x9 baking dish; maybe, next time I will use smaller dish for it to be thicker.  Was delicious served warm with vanilla ice cream. This would also be a great recipe for blueberries or peaches or apples.

Cherries lacked flavor 
Could be user error
Definitely cook for 45 min instead of 60
Similar to peach cobbler recipe and consistency
Ice-cream compliments it well

My sister-in-law and I made this for a BBQ night dessert and it was delicious! Can’t wait to make it again and try using other fruits. 

The only alterations to this recipe were that we used sweet cherries, and we sliced them in half because they were too large to spread out and cover the dish.

It tasted good, but the proportions were off for me. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the cobbler was way too buttery (and I love butter). I had to pour off about a quarter cup before I served it. Also, it took more than an hour to bake. Again, I think I must have done something wrong, though I did follow the directions. The cobbler tastes good, but doesn't look like the picture, and it's more cake than cobbler.

It came out GREAT!!!! The ingredients are spot on! As a personal preference, I added 1 tsp. of Vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. of Almond extract. I also, doubled the cherry amount to 4 Cups instead of the recommended 2. I read all the reviews beforehand, and changed up my recipe assembly slightly.  After melting the butter in the preheating oven, I added my 'coated' cherry mixture to the butter, with the cherries now being begun as the starting layer of the dish. Next, I drizzled the batter over the cherry/butter mixture. It baked a perfect 60 minutes in my oven. In the last 10 of the 60, I scattered brown sugar atop the mixture and baked. It was excellent! The finished dish was a perfect ratio of cherries to caramelized crust consistency. It was SO easy. I will definitely be making it again.

A yummy dessert and super easy to make. There aren't many recipes for fresh-picked cherries, but this was a great way to feature this delicious fruit! I had all of the ingredients on hand already and it worked perfectly. My only complaint was that it becomes very gooey and sticky on the bottom of the pan, but that also means that it's extra sticky and delicious! A little whipped cream or vanilla ice cream and you have a sweet treat!

Like other reviewers, I added more cherries - a generous 4 cups and loved the result. I also added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon.  I just wish fresh tart cherries were available year round so we could make this wonderful dessert whenever we wanted!

This is the exact recipe my mammaw made.  The preparation was only slightly different in that she would heat up the oven with a skillet in the oven, then prepare the batter and fruit.  When the skillet and oven were nice and hot she would put a stick of butter in to melt for about 5 minutes, then add the batter and then finally the fruit on top, never stirring.  The batter bakes up all around the fruit.  So glad I found this recipe, thank you for sharing!

This was really good. I had to tweak the recipe a bit as I did not have sour cherries. I used three cherry varieties, Bing, Rainier, and Strawberry Rainier. I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter as well as a pinch of salt. When tossing  the cherries with the flour and sugar mixture, I used half as much sugar and added a couple of dashes of cinnamon. I turned out absolutely fabulous and everyone who had it asked for the recipe.

Holy butter and sugar! I used 1/2 cup instead of a cup and it was still super sweet. I used a 9x9 instead of a 9x13 but kept all ingredients the same. It came out great except there was way too much butter. This must have been due to the 9x9, but judging on how much butter there was I think there would have still been too much even with a 9x13. So yes, this is a great easy recipe, and of course it tastes good because its drenched in butter and sugar.

I wasn't sure if I melted the butter right (I melted it completely until it was a liquid), but it was a hit with my family! So simple and quick! I would definitely make it again :)

I used red cherries - cut the sugar on those to 1/4 cup. I used 2/3 cup sugar in the cake portion, added cinnamon.  Added vanilla to the melted butter - also cut the butter down by 2 tablespoons. I also cut the cherries in half. 

It came out amazing. Perfectly sweet.

This cobbler is awesome.   the batter baked just the way I like it, a little chewy.  I also used less  sugar and added cinnamon, vanilla,  and almond extract as recommended by others, to the batter. I increased amt of cherries to 4 cups.
FYI. I didn't have enough all purpose flour so I made up the difference with almond flour.   It turned  out fine.

This is the easiest and most delicious recipe.  You don't have to use cherries!  Any berry will work.  I used a mix of fresh blueberry, strawberry and blackberries.

Great recipe. I doubled everything except the butter and sugar but wish I had doubled the sugar. Despite using sweet cherries, it lacked the sweetness I was anticipating. Next time, I will just double it all. I may also cut the bigger cherries in half.  I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter as suggested and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Doubled, this made a thick, full cobbler in the 9x13 and is packed with cherries. After reading the edges get almost deep fried due the butter, I gently mixed just the edges after pouring the batter in. My edges were crisp but not tough or fried.  Overall, it's delicious and I will be making again.

If I could give it zero stars I would. Followed exactly and this receipe is a disaster!Very hard toffee on the bottom. This is not a cherry cobbler.  Waste of ingredients. Threw it out.       Do Not recommend.

I really liked this classic cobbler recipe, as I prefer ones in which you place the fruit on top of the batter. I halved the recipe and used coconut oil instead of butter, as I'm lactose intolerant and typically substitute coconut oil for butter in most recipes. Because I was trying to use up past-their-prime cherries, I had more than a cup - more like 1 1/3 cups. I used a glass pie pan. I've never used cherries before in a cobbler, and I was very pleased with the result.

EXCELLENT!  I made the recipe according to directions except I added more cherries than the recipe indicated and increased the amount of flour added to the cherries.  I didn't increase the sugar, though, and the sweetness was perfect.  I made it for a potluck, and everyone loved it!  My baking pan was slightly bigger than the recipe recommended, and the crust was a little thin.  The next time I make it, I think I'll double the crust ingredients to make it thicker.  Other than that, it was delicious!  This recipe would be great with plums, apples, blueberries, or any other type of fruit used for crisps and crumbles.  Definitely making it again!

The flavour was nice, but I didn't like how greasy it was.  Nobody else seemed to mind however, and liked it, so I'll probably make it again (I just won't eat it).

Sorry, we didn't care for this. My 4 year old wouldn't even eat it, and when it comes to sweets she eats everything.  This was like a cake with some cherries scattered across the top and a chewy, crispy caramel-like layer all around the edge that was kinda odd. If you try this, you'll want to at least double the cherries.

I purchased a basket of sour cherries at a local farmers market. I followed recipe exactly except I added a teas of almond extract to the cherry mixture. I baked in a 10 inch round tart pan for 50 min. It looked pretty but there was spill over in the oven so protect the oven floor with foil. Tastes delicious!

I followed recipe except for using frozen cherries. I never stray from the original recipe the first time I make it but I only had access to frozen cherries and felt like making dessert. I agree that  the pan size is too big and makes for a flat  cobbler. Even though it tasted good it had crispy edges and the rest was  gooey like a custard and not the usual cobbler texture. Maybe its because I used frozen cherries? The flavor was good but the I think I will stick to a more traditional cobbler next time.

Anything with 1/2 c butter and only 1 cup flour cannot be expected to become cobbler.  And this recipe is no exception.  Ended up with an overly sweet (after I had already cut down the sugar)  - syrupy gloppy mess of cherries with minimal dough with the whole mess swimming in a lake of butter.  Blecchhh.

Ive made this several times and its perfect every time. Easy to make. You can pretty much sub out any fresh fruit too. Its not overly sweet and the salt from the butter is really nice constrast against the fruit. The edges basically fry in butter making them crunchy. This is my go to cobbler now any time I gave fresh peaches or cherrys on hand.

I made this for a Special dinner with guests. Everyone enjoyed it, but I personally felt disappointed in the texture of the cobbler. It felt more like a sponge cake shortbread thing with not enough goo. Ice cream or whip cream made it better. Next time I will look for something more traditional with dough on top or a crisp topping.

Super easy and everyone raved about it. I did use 3 cups sweet cherries instead of sour so I only used 1/4 cup sugar on the fruit. I used 1/2 c buttermilk and 1/2 c whole milk. Wonderful!

I made a gluten free version using Pillsbury GF all purpose flour and made a 1/2 recipe. It was definitely more cake like than a traditional cobbler but overall tasted great. As I suffer from celiac I do not bake often and will make this again.

I would make this recipe many times again. I did add a tsp of vanilla and a tbsp of cinnamon to dress up the batter. As for the fruit I added about two cups of strawberries in addition to the two cups of cherries. It helped to sweeten up as well as bulk up the recipe. two cups of fruit only is not nearly enough. Furthermore, I had VERY sour cherries to work with, so in the fruit mixture I added another cup of sugar. And It was wonderful. The texture and everything was fantastic, I loved it.

We loved the dough. Much different than that Bisquick type dough that everyone makes! The only problem is there wasn't enough for my large Cobbler Pan so it came out very thin. Will probably double the recipe next time.

I will make it again but with changes. So sweet it was hard to eat. I will cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and butter to 1/2 cup and double the cherries. I made it with Gluten free all purpose flour and was happy with the crust. Not the same as white flour but I was very happy with the consistency... just need to adjust the sugar. Loved the method!

I followed this recipe and made the adjustments that many reviewers recommended (less sugar, more cherries, added cinnamon and vanilla) and this was a complete flop. The cobbler was a weird chewy consistency - I was hoping for a light fluffy soft cake with crispy edges and moist cherries throughout. Won't make this again.

Made this for my dad for Father's Day it tasted great but mine did not look like the picture at all! Still, very good. I did add more sweet cherries to mine and cinnamon to the batter, I think next time I would use a smaller pan though. The dough was really tough to work with but worth the end result. Thanks for posting!

No changes were made to this recipe. I was absolutely delicious! Will def. make again and again! Not too sweet, like some recipes. It actually had the perfect sweetness. Plan on making it with splenda next time (for the Husband).  Will leave a review for that variation of it, as well.

I made this with rhubarb in my RV.  So easy to put together!  I increased the cake portion by 50%. Increased baking time by only 5 minutes.  I will make this again with any fruit.  This cobbler is outstanding!

Great basic recipe.  Having the butter in the pan really enhances the crust while using much less butter than other similar recipes. I made this cobbler a few times. I used less butter before and it was still very good.  You can use any fruit. I usually use 2 cups fresh fruit mixed with a little sugar.  I used strawberries and blueberries the last time.  I  usually add a little vanilla to the batter. I also like to sprinkle a little brown sugar on top before baking.  It adds another layer of flavor.

With an abundance of sour cherries this year decided to make this with 4 cups of cherries. I would have been disappointed with less. I kept the sugar at the same level as I like the tartness of the cherries. Made it in a good-sized oval casserole probably about 8x10 .  I also added about 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter, and almond extract to the cherries.  As other writers pointed out it is more like an upside down cake but it is delicious, especially warm with some vanilla custard ice cream!

I found it a bit too sweet - otherwise, the consistency and the texture was great. The edges became a little well-browned, but we don't mind that. Well worth the effort of pitting the cherries, for sure.

Loved it, and followed the recipe pretty closely, except used less white sugar than suggested.  Our cherries were Rainier, so not too sweet, but a great dessert regardless!

Per the other recommendations, I doubled the cherries.  I used sour cherries from the tree out back and cut back on the sugar as recommended from other recipes.  Although we normally  don't like too sweet it was on the tart side.  I will try again using the amounts from the recipe.

I followed the advice from the referrals and increased the cherries to 4 cups so increased the flour to 2 T but left the sugar at 1/2 cup. I did not have tart cherries- I used the cherries that are in season now. I also added 1 tsp of almond extract to the cherries. For the batter I increased the mix by 1/2 and used 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar/splenda mix. I used 1 cup almond milk and 1/2 cup sour cream. LOVE this web site and all the advice from those who have actually made the recipes!

The friend I made this for gobbled it up!  I reduced the sugar and added more (sweet) cherries.  My friend loved it, and it was really good, but it wasn't quite what I was hoping for, in terms of cobbler - it was more like a really great cherry pancake.  Thanks for the recipe!

This  tastes awesome, however I used less sugar, alot less and added agave nectar in lieu of white sugar and it's still too sweet for me, but its good...also, think I will cut down on the butter next time...but overall a great recipe. I will use it for peach and other cobblers as well.

Based  on suggestions of other reviewers,  I too reduced the sugar and butter, increased the cherries, and added a little cinnamon and vanilla. The consistency and texture was unusual: not quite a cobbler, not quite a cake, a little spongy, a little crispy around the edges.  Baking for 65 minutes was perfect. Unfortunately, I had only sweet cherries, so I don't think this was as good as it would have been with sour cherries. Still, I did like it, and all my coworkers loved it. I will try this again with sour cherries, also with peaches, maybe blueberries, etc. It reminds me of a dump cake recipe.

This is the best cherry cobbler I think I've ever had! Well worth the time to pit the cherries! Changed a few things -- little less sugar, cinnamon, more cherries (cause more is good). Very adaptable recipe -- going to try peaches next. Thanks Miranda!!!

I made a smaller version of it since it's just my husband and I which was a mistake because it's so darn good!  I used 1/4c melted butter, 1 c self rising powder (did not have bake powder),  1/2 c sugar and 1/2 c milk.  Lightly mixing everything together and poured on top of melter butter.
I doubled the cherries (4c) and added1/4 c sugar, 1 tbsp flour, 1/2 tbsp of vanilla and 1/2 tbsp(ish) of cinnamon-tossed to make sure everything was covered.  Popped it in the oven for about 40-45 minutes and it was PERFECT!!  
Thank you for a great, super easy recipe!

Reduced overall sugar by 3/4 cup and still found it sweet (maybe because of the cherries - they weren't sour). Was very buttery and will try to reduce that next time. Easy to make and I'll make it again with a few changes.

I have made it using the  recipe 1 1/2 time for the batter with the addition of 1\4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. I have changed the fruit from cherries to black berries, fresh frozen peaches 4 cups of the fruit and same amount of sugar for the fruit. Every one that has the different fruits types loved it. Then said you can make it anytime for them.

Everyone loved this.  I used Rhubarb and went with the standard recipe changing it only to add a teaspoon of cinnamon sugar to the batter and then sprinkling the top just before baking.  I started with the single batch and ended up doubling the recipe and using 8 cups of chopped Rhubarb.
I ended up with my 9x13 pan being about  1 1/2" thick of delicious Rhubarb Cobbler.   My neighbors are asking for more.  This is super easy and a KEEPER.

This recipe came out fine but too thin for my liking. I would bake it in a smaller pan (ie. 9 or 12 inch square).

I made the recipe exactly as presented. It did not come close to my expectations. The cobbler was very inconsistent. I would call it more of a shortcake. It was also very very sweet. I would never make this again.

My only change would be to use a 8x8 dish.  Found that the 9x13 was way too large.  But will definitely make it again,  just loved it!

I made this dessert but with 1 change - I used unsweetened frozen cherries since they are not in season yet where I live.  My husband loved it!

This banana bread is awesome! It's the first recipe for banana bread I've ever tried and I don't need to look any further! It is delicious!! The only thing I did differently was mash the bananas & mashed a full cup. It did take more than 2 but it all depends on the size of the bananas. A cup after mashing is perfect! I also added 1 tsp cinñamon. Wonderful recipe! Thank you for sharing it!

This was really spectacular, I did what the most helpful review said to do and added a little cinnamon, vanilla, and 1/2 the amount of sugar. The only thing I would do differently is cook it for maybe 5-10 minutes less because the edges became tough. But it's delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made this cobbler and while the taste was good I think that the 9x13 pan that was called for was too large and there should have been more cherries added. I will try this again but with the above changes.

Because I am diabetic, I substituted Stevia ( according to the substitution tables) for the sugars and as a sugarless dessert, this cobbler was rather good.

I used less sugar, and split the sugar between white and brown.  I, too, added vanilla in the crust and sprinkled with cinnamon.  This was a huge hit with my husband, and in his words, "a definite remake".

Flavor was good and I did enjoy the crispness of the crust.   As others suggested, I added more cherries as well as 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. I sprinkled brown sugar on top the last 5 minutes.  Topped with vanilla ice cream.  Thank you for the recipe !  I will make this again!

We loved this cobbler.  It was so easy to make and had a fresh light taste.  I did double the amount of cherries 
( because I had lots! ) but, otherwise, left everything else the same.  This is more cake-like, so if people are looking for a crisp or biscuit like consistency...it's not the recipe to use.

I made it with some others' suggested changes,  I added a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla which  helped.  Do not expect this to be biscuit like,  it is spongy and very  sweet.  I liked it, my boyfriend liked it but my sister said too spongy and my friend said too much cinnamon.  Since I like biscuit texture better, I won't be making this again.

Used chopped fresh peaches, whole-wheat flour, oat milk and extra-virgin olive oil, much less sugar and added a handful of chopped pistachios to the fruit. Wonderful. An extremely flexible recipe.

Way too sweet. It has potential so I will try it again, reducing the butter as half a cup made the consistency too oily, and definitely half the sugar.

1. It's worth the investment in a cherry pitter. (But doable with a knife and patience)
2. Made the recipe as is (except I used "sweet cherries" because that's what I was trying to use up) and it was fantastic even though I over baked it a little. Pay close attention toward the end before the timer goes off. This baby goes from lovely golden to brown on the bottom pretty quick. 
3. Some people found the recipe too sweet but I found it to be just right (even though I used "sweet cherries", and my boyfriend thought it could use a little more sugar. 
4. Next time I will try adding a little vanilla as other users suggested and will get back to you :-)
Lastly... i'm pretty sure you're supposed to use unsalted butter. Just a note for next time.

Made this over the weekend. Turned out great! I followed everyone else s advice and cut the sugar and it worked out great, topping the finished product with a scoop of ice cream also adds a bit of sweetness as well ;) I added a teaspoon of Vanilla extract and pinch of Cinnamon to the cherry's when I was tossing them. Loved the recipe, cant wait to try it again, so easy to make!

I used far more cherries than called for by the recipe because I wanted to avoid having leftover fruit, so my result was a lot wetter than the way this cobbler looks in the photo. That's not bad, but maybe next time I'd keep that ratio closer to the recipe. I do think this was probably written for tart cherries. The ones I used were rather sweet on their own and it was way too much sugar. I wish I'd used about 1/4 cup rather than 3/4. Still a good experience. Would make again.

Made it as directed. Easy (except pitting cherries. A bit time consuming but you only need two cups and worth it.). If you want to know if it's good, check out my pic. Hint: mines the empty dish. My family devoured it and wanted seconds.

This recipe was only ok.  The texture was very spongy, not what I was expecting at all.  I don't think I'll be trying this again.

This is a really good recipe!! A must try for cherry tree owners as well as people who just love fresh cherries. My husband couldn't stop eating this. We grow Bing Cherries and so we cut the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of the 3/4 cup called for in the cherry mixture. Everyone has enjoyed this and it will be a regular in our home. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!!!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but mine was SWIMMING in butter (like biting into bread that had been soaked in warm butter through and through). The batter wasn't enough to fill the pan, and ended up like a butter-sogged fried sweet bread that was hard and crispy on the edges because of all the butter. Maybe 1/2 the butter and a smaller pan would fix this? Once my arterties clear out I may try some of the other reviewers' suggestions... but then again, cherries are an expensive fruit to test recipes one...

Great recipe. I used 1/2 cup less sugar, used only 6 tablespoons butter and used skim milk.  It was still excellent!!

Love the method and the taste. I'll try it again with a little less butter; the edges got too crispy even baking 40 minutes - my oven's probably hotter than it should be. I used the full amount of sugar because I used buttermilk so it might have been too tangy with less. Much prefer this to syrupy cherry pie filling.

It was pretty good. While making it I found I was a little short on some ingredients, but it still turned out pretty tasty.

This is good, but definitely NOT a cobbler.  It's more like a muffin with a sponge-like texture.  Thanks for sharing, but I'll try another one next time.

Best cobbler EVER!! I'm gonna try it with other fruit now I used not quite double the cherries, and added a little bit of Cinnamon Vanilla Sugar I had (in like a shaker canister) and it was perfect.. I actually undercooked it a tad but we didn't care, because 2 of us ate it all in 24 hours!

It was very tasty. I used sour cherries in a jar, they are already pitted. I did not add sugar to the cherries as they were already sweetened. Next time I'll reduce the sugar a little more. Probably will half the butter too.

I made this when someone gave me some fresh cherries, it was great. I love the cake texture. I did add vanilla to batter and cinnamon to the cherries and cut down on the sugar. I am trying it with apples today. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was so quick and easy to make!  I substituted frozen blueberries - and cut back on the sugar a bit.  Also added 1/2 t. salt to enhance flavor a bit. The topping was a little chewy - but I live at altitude, so it might have been because of that - so next time I'm going to cut back even more on the sugar.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use just half the sugar listed in the recipe as suggested. I'm glad I did because it was still fairly sweet. I also thought that a stick of butter seemed like a lot so I cut that in half too. It was easy enough to make but, overall, it just didn't wow us. The cake on the edges was crispy/sugary and the cake in the center of the pan was really chewy instead of soft like I expected it would be.  Maybe baking it in a slightly smaller pan would have improved the texture. I also think that this could have used a lot more cherries.

My father-in-law gave my family a bucket of fresh cherries, and I thought this recipe would put them to good use.  It was easy enough to throw together and produced average results.  An entire stick of butter isn't really necessary, and more cherries would have been nice.  The cobbler was rubbery and burned around the edges.  It was good enough with real vanilla bean ice cream, but nothing spectacular.  The recipe wasn't a total disaster, but we couldn't eat the burnt edges.  In any case, I doubt I'll use this recipe again.

I thought this had a weird texture.  Very chewy and sponge like.  Not what I was expecting.
