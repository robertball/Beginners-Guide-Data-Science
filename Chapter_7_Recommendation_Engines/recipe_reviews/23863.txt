I started with a base of sauteed onions and carrots (in olive oil).  Boy, was this delicious!!
I added much more kale and used 2 cans of chicken broth.  My husband didn't think he was going to like it, but he changed his mind quickly!!  I will make this again and again.

This was great!  I used low-sodium chicken broth (more than called for so it was more of a soup), extra kale, about 4oz turkey kielbasa, and half a can of diced tomatoes.  I'll make this again for sure - so easy!

I was tasting this from the pot and decided that it was just a bit too bland for my taste. I threw in a can of diced tomatoes and it tasted wonderful. That may just be me and my strong desire for taste. A fun way to use kale.

This is an amazing recipe! I am growing kale in my garden for the first time - but didn't know what to do with it. Now I know! Thank you!

This recipe is dellicious and FAST! From start to finish, under a half hour with the only dirty items in your kitchen being one pan and a cutting board.

I substituted chicken stock for the water. Added alot of richness. But I didn't use that much, so it wasn't a "soup". Just enough stock for a nice, rich sauce to cover everything.

I initially made this because I wanted a healthy soup, but was quite impressed with the taste too. However, this was only after I cooked the ingredients in chicken broth and added a splash of red wine vinegar at the end. My boyfriend and I really loved it, and it was quite filling. I recommend this if you want a delicious way to consume your greens.

this is simple and good. i changed it up a bit to what i had in the garden and cupboard. cooked bacon in a 5qt cast iron dutch over then drained most of the grease. sauteed the onion and garlic in same pot, adding chopped kale and chard when the onion was soft. stirred it up a bit then added 6 cup water, salt, pepper, thyme and parsley. brought to a boil for a few min til the greens were cooked. then tossed in a drained/ rinsed can of kidney beans and topped with the cooked bacon(chopped up). that was it. easy peasy and good!

I love this dish much better than the soup. I use chicken broth and turkey sausage. I saute the onion, garlic and sausage together in a little olive oil until the onions are caramelized, then I add the broth, seasonings and kale. My sweetie calls this his healthy food and wants it when he is under the weather. I cook this with vegetable broth and without the sausage for my vegetarian daughter, who loves it, too.

Fantastic with a few smal changes.  First I sauteed 1 onion with the garlic in smoe EVOO.  Secondly I added about 1/2 cup of white wine and a splash of red wine vinegar.  Let it all sautee for a few minutes and then added the Kale and Turkey Kielbasa.  I also followed other reviewers advice and used low sodium chicken broth to replace the water.  Only took about 15 minutes to make and was absolutely delish!!  Thank you, definately a keeper!!

Wonderful soup!  Added carrots and used chicken broth instead of water, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  We all loved it.  Thanks, Sally.

This is easy and healthy.  As is, it's a little bland, but I add one beef bouillon cube, about 4-8 oz total of the sausage, and a pinch of cajun seasoning.  Great recipe

Delicious! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used chicken stock (low sodium). I also sauteed the onions until they were soft, and I used vegetarian kielbasa since I don't eat pork or red meat. It was truly delicious!!!

This is pretty good--good enough to make again, but not for company or any special occasions.  I used homemade chicken broth instead of water--for nutrition and flavor, and used andouille as it is what I can get easily. I must say this is the most I have enjoyed kale ever!

I rec'd a bunch of kale in my Bountiful Basket and didn't really know what to do with it until I came across this recipe. It was simple, healthy, and flavorful. I also added in some chopped carrots that came in my basket. I would make this again.

I have never cooked with Kale and this seemed simple enough.  I substituted chicken broth with vegetable broth and did not use the kielbasa sausage instead added half a stick of butter and LOVED it!

My mom is at home after just having an operation and she loves soup so I'm happy to use these recipes! This is a great soup!! Instead of water I used chicken broth as a base. Everything else I kept the same.

I love a 2 serving soup and this was a good one.  I only wish the broth was a bit stronger...maybe some more kielbasa would have made it a little richer.

I took this recipe and went for it with what I had around the house.  I used Italian sausage and added a can of diced tomatoes.  I cooked pasta and with about four minutes to go I added the kale to the other simmering ingredients so it would wilt.  I did not add any water or broth but served it as a pasta sauce.  Everyone in my family devoured it!  I'll definitely use this again and try it as a soup.

My family really enjoyed this!  I used a little more kielbasa (I used turkey kielbasa), tons more kale and I used chicken broth (low-sodium) in place of the water.  One more little note/tip be careful when seasoning with salt and pepper (if you do) the kielbasa offers saltiness too!  Really good and a great way to use kale.  Yum!

This was an easy and very flavorful soup, I did use swiss chard instead of the kale and also added some chicken stock to make it more of a soup/ stew.

Yum! Subbed vegetable broth for about 1/2 of the water (maybe more) and doubled the amount of kale. Everyone gobbled it up, including the 1-year-old!
