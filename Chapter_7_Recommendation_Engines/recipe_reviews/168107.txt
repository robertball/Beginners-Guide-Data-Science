I used fresh bread crumbs in the meatballs and homemade ranch dressing mix. I did not add the extra salt in the sauce. I'm sure this could be a good recipe with some doctoring--as is, we didn't care for it.

Wow!  This is good!  I followed the recipe except I left out the bell pepper since I didn't have any, and I used dried minced onions (too lazy today to chop onions today).  My package of ground turkey was 1.25lbs and I made 15 meatballs.  When I added the sauce, I spooned some on each meatball, and I flipped them over when baking was done before letting them rest.  I also resisted the urge to just put in the whole can of diced tomatoes and measured out 1 cup as written.  Yum!!  You can't taste the Dr. Pepper and I bet you'd get the same result with Coke, too.  I served them over rice and fresh broccoli. Everyone loved them!!

Yum Yum Yum!!! This recipe was great, loved the flavor it gave. The only thing I did diffrent was brown mine in a pan and place in a crock pot, all the ingredients stayed the same, and this was delicious. Will def do again, thank you for the recipe! :)

This was really good.  Served it with white rice and everyone gobbled it up.  My neighbor called for the recipe because her kids told her how much they liked it!  Added this to our regular menu.

I have to be honest, I cannot taste the Dr.Pepper.That being said, the meatballs Rocked! I liked the sauce too. My son said this dish tasted like my meatloaf without the vegies. I even add extra soda to sauce,to try and "DR" up the flavor, didn't help. I like making it, easy and I made 3 lbs of meatballs,used 1/2 for tonight and will make meatloaf out of the rest some other day. Thank You Lyndsie these were fun!

The meatballs in this recipe were good, but the sauce was not.  We did not like the flavor.   The combination of the Dr. Pepper and tomato created a cinnamon taste that was unappealing.

I made the recipe exactly as written and loved, loved, loved the sauce.  But...the meatballs were way too mushy for our tastes. I will certainly make the sauce again but will use my regular turkey meatball recipe instead.  Note...there must have been some kind of Dr. Pepper shortage in our area.  2 major supermarkets were out and the mini mart I finally went to had only one 20 oz bottle.

These were delicious!  The only thing I changed was I didn't add the green pepper, my family doesn't like them. This was delicious over mashed potatoes.  This is going down as a family favoriate.

I really liked these a lot. I expected the sauce to taste more like a bbq sauce but it was closer to a porcupine ball sauce. I served them over onion rice and corn with a kick, both from this site. If I were to make them again I would double the sauce and add cornstarch to make it more like a gravy. The meatballs are a little soft so serving them over rice gives the meal more of a contrast in texture rather than over mashed potatoes.

Great recipe. Very tasty. Had to use 2lbs of ground turkey (since it only sold in 1lb packages). Increased other ingredients to match except for the soda. Came out perfect. Served over rice. Very tasty. Made about 30 golf-ball sized meatballs, they'll be leftover this week. Thanks for sharing!

This is good; very reminescent of Coca-Cola Chicken which is a favorite in this house. Followed the recipe exactly and thought the Ranch Dressing would change the flavor, but I did not detect it.

This recipe was so easy and tasty. My kids enjoyed it. I eagerly passed this recipe on to my friends who have since made it for their families. I will make this dinner again. Most of the ingredients were already in my kitchen. I love how the soda gives the meal just a hint of sweetness.

This was a delicious recipe, the flavors melded together phenomenally! The only thing I did different was lessen the amount of Dr. Pepper, to reduce the soupy-ness of the sauce.

They were a good healthy alternative to regular meatballs but it was missing something and the meatballs turned out a little dry inside because of the low fat content.

I just made this recipe last night for the first time.  I must say it is scrumptious.  The sauce is very tasty.  The only thing I did differently was use half red pepper/half green pepper rather than all green pepper.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I will for sure be making this again!!!

I made these for my Dr. Pepper drinking son's birthday dinner and he loved them.  My husband liked them, but I didn't at all.  I thought they were too salty and too sweet.  Our individual ratings were:  5 - 4 - 1 = 3.33.

My family and I absolutely loved this! I used ground beef instead of turkey and Italian breadcrumbs. I didn't have any green pepper or onion or ranch, so they didn't get tossed in! But I did have garlic and I minced it and tossed it in some Extra Virgin Olive Oil in the bottom of my Crock-Pot while I was preparing the other ingredients. After making the meat balls I put brown sugar and ketchup in the pot and mixed it well then added one can of Dr. Pepper and my meatballs, they weren't covered so I added another can! A dash or two of Worcestershire sauce and about 5 hours later...YUM!!!! Thanks for this awesome recipe!! It is a favorite of my family (and my neighbors!) now!!!

Very Easy recipe, great leftovers! Added too much Dr. Pepper, but still very tasty. Sort of like meatloaf with a kick, would be great with whipped potatoes.

this dish was amazing though i would not add as much bread crumbs next time.  And I put the meat balls and sauce on a piece of focaccia bread and melted a slice of mozzarella on top.  The family loved it.

These were actually pretty good!  I didn't use the whole can of Dr. Pepper, I think it would have been too much liquid if I had.  I also left out of tomatoes.  I didn't think the sauce tasted like Dr. Pepper, just a sweeter BBQ sauce.

My son made this on a Scout campout a few years ago and everyone liked it so much it has become his "signature dish".  He is leaving for Navy boot camp in a few weeks and the only thing he requested/insisted we make for his going away party is Lyndsie's Dr. Pepper meatballs!

My family loved this recipe and fought over the leftovers. I altered the recipe to use hamburger (which is what I had on hand) and used a whole 28 oz can of tomatoes. I served it over basmati rice.

The meatballs were good but I did not like the sauce one bit. The Dr. Pepper makes it too sweet and I just did not like the combination.

These were okay.  I thought the sauce was a good consistency, not too soupy; however, I thought the sauce would be sweeter.  The kids did not like them much.  I think the reason was the green pepper--it was too strong in the meatballs and in the sauce.  I will probably try them again using 1/2 red bell pepper in the sauce and no bell pepper in the meatballs.  I would also cut the black pepper to 1/4 tsp, and the recipe calls for too many bread crumbs; I think 1/2 cup would be fine.
