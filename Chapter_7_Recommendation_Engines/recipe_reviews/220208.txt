Too much dill weed - suggest reducing it.  There is no need for the extra salt b/c the parmesan cheese is salty enough.  You don't need to use 1/2 cup of milk for the fish., use just enough where you can dip the fish fillets. I suggest unsalted butter, also work quickly w/ the sauce b/c it will separate if you don't serve it fast enough.

this was fabulous and one recipe my husband said to make again. I served with lemony quiona and frozen peas with butter and garlic. I added seasonings to the milk as well and added some extra seasonings to the wine sauce. Really Great, thank you. the whole meal took about 30 min to prepare and sit down to eat, not bad for a weeknight.

The fish was amazing!! It was cooked perfectly and the coating gave it a really nice crisp. So no complaints on the fish. The reduction on the other hand was not a very good flavor and it was very gummy and goopy. I am not great at making reductions so I don't normally try. I tried making it twice and just could not get it to be good. I ate the fish with out any sauce and loved it, my husband put some lemon on his. So three stars because in my opinion the fish is what matters and it was good with out the sauce.

Delicious! I can't speak for the proportions b/c I tend not to measure anything, but the combo of ingredients is wonderful.

Also for anyone having trouble with the sauce, check out a few of the Chef John videos. They will teach you how to make a roux (which is what this sauce is), and you will never have trouble with sauces again! A good reference is the Homemade Nacho Cheese Sauce by Chef John. 

Btw, thanks flygal97. The spinach, onion, garlic saute was a perfect side next to a bed of rice. :)

I just used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Made the white wine sauce creamier.

I would follow the steps exactly as listed. I made more tilapia than the recipe called for, and had to create more sauce from scratch guessing at the amounts because the flour I had leftover burned the pan. Otherwise very good!

I left out the dill since neither my wife or I are that fond of it and we both love this.. I'm going to experiment with the recipe and different wines just for fun.

Very tasty, but needed to add much more milk to get anything like a 'sauce' consistency.

I thought this was okay. All that parmesan flavor is a little overwhelming.. Although it made for a nice crispy breading. I think an important part of this recipe is picking the right wine, because if you don't, the sauce comes out tasting weird. :P

The fish was good -- though next time I think I'll use a little seasoned salt to give it a bit more flavor boost.   I don't know what happened to the sauce but it came out as a glutenous mess that couldn't be saved. Maybe I had too much leftover flour...?

The sauce was a little too thick, and the only taste was the wine...
