Wow, this was delicious!  my first time using tofu, and it turned out wonderful.  Like other reviewers, I just added diced tomatoes instead of the jar of peppers.  Then added some veggies i had on hand, some extra spices (paprika, pepper, and red pepper flakes) and it was ready...very flavourful.  It also froze and thawed well.  Thanks!

I was very pleased for my first try cooking with tofu.  Easy recipe and delicious.  My very picky 7 year old niece ate 3 bowls!  Instead of asparagus and mushrooms, I used fresh spinach and zucchini.

This was good, though more of a pepper sauce than a tomato sauce.   Might be better if you substituted some crushed tomatoes for the peppers.

This was my first recipe using tofu. I really liked the texture it gave the sauce. The only thing different I did was to add about 1/2 cup grated fresh parmesan to the sauce instead of putting on top. Will definately make again.

I really, really liked this recipe.  The flavors are great!  I was worried my husband would not like the roasted red pepper flavor, but he liked it as well.

I love the idea, but the 2 cups of broth is WAY!! too much.  Use 1/4 c., maybe?

I agree with leaving out the peppers and substituting tomatoes.  Liked the cream sauce idea.  I also cooked the mushrooms and onions in 1 cup veggie broth (instead of oil) until most of the liquid was gone.  They added a great flavor.  Will make again without the peppers.  The peppers I had gave it more of a vinegar flavor.

This was very creamy and quite good. I added cayenne pepper instead of the chili paste. I agree with the reviewer that said something is missing. I increased the salt, tomato paste, italian seasoning but was still not able to fix it.

I altered this recipe quite a bit, but the idea of blending up some firm tofu and adding it to sauce is a great one, and one I use regularly now.

I found this sauce to be very flavorful and unusual. After reading some reviews commenting that the sauce was missing something, I tried using beef broth instead of veggie broth. It worked - the sauce was delicious. And the bit of chili paste adds a perfect background of heat.

This recipe was easy and very tasty. I substituted sliced eggplant instead of pasta and it was delish! Nice texture, too.

My tofu was previously frozen, and I'm not sure if it was the 'silken' kind but it was somewhat gritty and never melded into the sauce. Also, I was skeptical of the 2 cups of stock so I only used about a cup (water + beef bouillon cube instead for more flavour) and omitted the jar of roasted red peppers as that seemed like it wouldn't add too much besides a vinegar-y taste. I love onions so I used a whole one, used okra and spinach instead of the asparagus, about four large mushrooms sliced, 4 large cloves of garlic minced and heaping teaspoon of minced fresh hot pepper. Didn't use the hot chile paste. Low sodium canned diced tomatoes. For seasoning and taste I used pepper, seasoned salt, generous dash of cinnamon, 2 bay leaves, onion & garlic powder and two packets of sweetener to cut the acidity of the tomato. I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with a bit of water to thicken, and added about 1/4 cup of Parmesan directly into the sauce. Also sour cream to fix the creaminess. I  had a small container of bbq sauce in fridge and tossed that in too, as I remember someone I know adding ketchup to their sauce... Strange, I know, but it does a little 'something'. Overall with changes it was good, so I would imagine so-so without any. I'm not sure if it'll be a repeat unless I happen to have leftover tofu (doesn't mean this isn't tasty!).

Excellent recipe, but seriously lacking something.  I cannot identify what is missing, although if I am to make this again, I'll add either a lot more chili paste and/or lots of red pepper flakes and more garlic.  I think that would help.  Overall, much healthy than using cream.  Thanks!

This was good, but I thought it was going to taste different than this.  This was sweeter than I though and less rich.  I'd rather use tomato sauce and whipping cream.

This was very easy and very good. I was amazed that you can make a "cream" sauce with tofu. This dish could've used a bit more flavor. But overall it was very good.

This is a wonderful creamy sauce.  My son gobbled it down. The extra sauce not used is great to keep for leftovers.

This was fabulous! I was skeptical because I don't like tofu normally, but I decided to give it a try anyway, and I'm glad I did. The only thing I changed was I used frozen petite asparagus, 11oz. roasted peppers, 12.3 oz. tofu, and more garlic. I also added some parm. cheese to the sauce. I will pass this on to friends & family.

Based on reviews and ingredients on  hand, I used two cans of diced tomatoes and a 14oz pack of silken tofu (no peppers or paste).  I added more than 10 stalks of asparagus (1/2 lb?).  Will definitely make again.  Using gf pasta, and omitting the cheese on top, this makes a balanced and delicious vegan, gf meal.

Fantastic!   My carnivores loved this.   I made it using 100% whole wheat rotini and cooked the pasta in vegetable broth.  A hearthealthy, vegetarian entree that is flavorful, robust and even better as a leftover two days later.   Made it when entertaining and it was simple and didn't lock me away from the guests during preperation.

We really enjoyed this! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but did make a few changes. I used beef broth like another review had mentioned, used about 2 tbsp of garlic, instead of chili paste I added about a tsp of chili power and couple shakes of red hot, and added about a 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese while it was simmering. Also, I found the sauce to watery so I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch and let it simmer for about 5-10 min. I really liked the texture and the taste. It made a lot so we froze half of the leftovers. I will be making this again!

This was very good and easy! I've never cooked with tofu before and it came out great! It's a perfect way to get quick and easy protein and it is delicious, very creamy! I will definitely make this again!
