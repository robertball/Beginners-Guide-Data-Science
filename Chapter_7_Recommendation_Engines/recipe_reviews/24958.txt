This was just delicious and, as the submitter states, quick and easy!  I prepared the recipe with the ingredients exactly as written, choosing not to sub any brown sugar as other reviewers suggested.  I wanted to see for myself how the recipe stood on its own.  I was not at all disappointed. I think it would have been easier and neater to mix the batter up in a separate bowl, then pour the batter into the baking dish, but this is a minor issue. I spread the chopped apples over the entire surface of the batter, rather than confining them to the center as the recipe directs, and the "pudding" (which is cake-like) had evenly distributed apples throughout. I served this with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with warm caramel sauce. Mmmm, sweet autumn comfort food at it's best. Hubby must agree, as he went back for a large second helping!

An old-fashiioned recipe that is easy, good and substantial.  Reminds me of grandmother's dessert that we used to pour cinnamon flavored milk or cream over.  Works best when you mix the apples into the batter - not just in the middle and remember to use cooking apples!  Some others are bland and too sweet.

This was okay and very easy, but why pour the apples in the middle?  Mine stayed there!  I'll stir it next time to even out the apples.

Very quick and easy, however really quite unimpressive. The flavor was a bit bland, better with ice cream, but just okay. Not outstanding, I'm sorry to say.

I was looking for a quick and easy apple dessert recipe and this is it. I brought it over to a friends house and it was a huge hit! There was even some stiff competition...a Cheescake Factory strawberry cheesecake... but this won hands down.  Serve it warm with some ice cream.  Yum!

Very easy and delicious! I mixed the batter in a separate bowl and poured it into a 9 inch pie dish then layered the sliced microwaved apples on top.  I used half brown sugar and half white with a tsp. of vanilla in the batter.  I spinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar and it smelled wonderful while it was baking!  Definitely serve warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.

I didn't care much for this recipe. It was a little flour-y tasting. Serving it with vanilla ice cream made it much better but I will not make this again. Sorry.

Oh heavens! Was this ever better than I expected! And easy! I used two large apples and put it in a large flat corningware pan... I don't think that's the way it was intended.. but OHHHH my! What a nice taste! The apples were perfect after about 5 minutes total in the microwave! Oh yummy!
Thanks for the recipe.. it's a keeper

my family calls this cobbler . For generations it's been one of the first recipes our girls learn to make. We use the same amt. of butter , no matter what size pan , then merely increase everything else in even increments , for different pan sizes . I use self rising flour & skip the baking powder & salt . It works with any fruit , fresh,frozen or canned and the only ones that need precooked are those like apples that won't get done in the allotted baking time . As for seasoning , use whatever's appropriate for the fruit you're using , same goes for sweetening the fruit itself ...none for canned , your preference for the fresh . Once you figure out your own spin on this recipe , its virtually fool proof !

Perfect! Simple, classic old-fashioned dessert.  A very, very moist pudding cake that is mildly spiced. I mixed the ingredients in a bowl instead of the actual baking dish and then transfered over and distributed the apples evenly over the top. This worked out great and the apples were spread out and in every bite. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup. There were 4 of us here for dinner and all 6 servings were gone by the end of the night. :) Thanks for sharing!

You must try this with 1/2 dark brown & white sugar,add cinnamon & vanilla extract to the batter and mix the apples up in the batter. Who needs ice cream? This dessert is rich and heavenly and worth every splendid calorie!!!!

This is an all-star in my recipe box.  I've made this many times as stated but today I changed it up a little.  Used 1/4 C. butter, 1/4 C. white sugar, 1/2 C. dark brown sugar and added 1/4 C. golden raisins and 1/4 C. dried cranberries. Consistency was more like moist bread pudding & the taste is terrific!!!  Love the original recipe and just thought I'd pass along these variations.

I made this using the suggestion in other reviews to use a combination of white and brown sugar, and it was wonderful! Even my husband liked it, and he's not a sweet-eater! I'll be making this again.

I just made this recipe and I quite like it!  I made it exactly as called for in the recipe (wait, no...I added a tsp of vanilla to the batter).  It is easy and very yummy and I haven't even added ice cream yet.  The only thing I'd change really is the amount of apples.  I think next time I'll increase it to 3 cups.  Also, I used an 8 x 8 square casserole dish and that was the perfect size.  Try this recipe and enjoy!

I've been looking all over for this recipe. Every time I move the recipe seems to get lost. I learned this recipe when I was cooking in a restaurant; and had to pare it down for at home.   For those who complain the apples stayed in the middle, you pour the apples down the center of the pan. I use a glass 13X9 pan.  I usually go down one side and up the other as opposed to dumping them in the middle in a pile. That's how I was taught.   We served it warm with vanilla ice cream in the restaurant.   I also learned to melt the butter in the pan, then add the flour mixture minus the butter, then add the apples.

this was really very good. i did though change a few things. instead of cinnamon i added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. and 1 tsp vanilla. i mixed the chunky chopped apples in the batter. i did all these changes because of reading what some of the viewers said about blandness. it came out fabulous. moist but firm. was a hit at the sunday potluck. people were fighting to take the leftovers home. great recipe.

Wonderful! Used a bread pan and it baked evenly throughout! Used 1-2 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp allspice, and a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.   Mix the apple mixture evenly throughout the batter...don't just plop it in the center. 2 cups of apples as written is good for a la mode.  However, if you prefer to use caramel sauce and/or whipping cream as a topping, you may want to consider 3-4 cups of apples.  After the apples are cooked in the microwave, you end up with only 1-1/4 cup.

Excellent Apple Pudding, and very easy to put together!  I added vanilla essence because I love the stuff, but I followed the recipe besides that and it was great.  Thanks Laurie Nanni!!!

This was really amazing.  Everyone raved about it and I really loved it too, even though something of this texture is not normally my bag.  It is almost like a bread pudding, so the title is appropriate.  I used about 2.5 cups granny smith apples and I mixed them throughout the batter.  I also mixed in a separate bowl then poured into greased pan.  Upon removal from oven, I spread caramel sauce over the top and left it sit for a while.  Really, really good.  I will definitely make this again.  It would be great for a brunch or a breakfsst pot luck.  And so easy to make.

I followed the recipe exactly for this dish - and while the flavour was excellent, the middle of the cake was not cooked thoroughly and the edge was getting overcooked.  Next time I make this - and there likely will be a next time given the speed with which you can make this dessert - I will use a larger dish than the "small baking dish" dish called for in the recipe.

So simple and good! My husband and I really enjoyed it. I took it to a family dinner and everyone ate it up. I followed the directions as stated excluding the apples being applied to the batter. I spooned them over the entire batter than baked. Once it came out I made a bread pudding glaze to put over the top! It was EXCELLENT!!!

OMG!  Thumbs up for me on this one.  The only thing I changed was the sugar and went with the recommendations from some other reviewers and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.

I thought it would be more like a pudding. It is quick and easy to make, more like a good coffee cake.

Yummy!  This was like a very moist southern dump cobbler.  It would be wonderful with any fruit...peaches, blueberries, cherries, pears, plums, blackberries, raspberries.  This is my "cobbler" recipe from now on.  And sooo easy.

WOW this one is a sweet tooth's dream. How anyone could call this recipe "bland" is beyond me.
Very easy to whip up great with vanilla icecream and butterscotch sauce if you can handle all that sweetness rolled into 1.

This recipe was absolutely delicious...I made it exactly as the recipe, except I did cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup.  It was perfect for our tastes.  I did use golden delicious apples, and they worked out great.  My kids are begging me to make this again.

Ifound this recipe simple, and a winner with all 5 of my children. We sprinkled it with icing sugar on serving and it was delicious. I spread the apples over the base of a baking tin and poured the sponge mix over...yum....will be making again

This recipe is amazing.  I have tried everything from gala to fuji to granny smith and they all work really well.  I have to substitute splenda and whole wheat pastry flour for my diet needs, but no one I feed it to seems to notice and they all want a copy of the recipe.

Very good.  I used a little less butter and reduced sugar to 3/4 c.  You can also use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and it turns out real good as well.

I made mine in a round 2 quart dish, and the deeper center didn't firm up (suspected that might happen.) Aside from  that, this was alright...like another reviewer said, it's more like a coffee cake. Not outstanding, so I don't think I'll try it again.

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed the other reviewer's advise and added 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, instead of 1 cup white sugar.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, 1 tsp. of lemon extract.   A sprinkle of allspice and a sprinkle of ginger to the batter.  It turned out to be quite flavorful.  However, I usually like my cobbler to be more crusty and not so spongy.

I followed someone's suggestion to use half brown and half white sugar.  The result was delicious.  So simple and good--I will make this many times, for sure.

I wanted something with apple and cinnamon around 11pm. I didn't want to go to the store to get ingredients or anything. Enter Virginia Apple Pudding from allrecipies.com. Words cannot express asflkhfgdr I will do my best though. If I have the chance to time travel the first thing I would do is travel back to the moment I took this out of the oven, I would be there waiting with some Häagen-Dazs® in one hand and Einstein in the other (Honestly Einstein would not be my first choice as a timetraveller companion but in my opinion he earned his passage with relativity, just as much as I had with the apple pudding). The only reason I gave it the 5/5 star rating was the surprising lack of dairy product in my freezer (Which comes at no fault of Laurie or her awesome recipe). If I had tried it A la mode I am sure it would've gotten the 6/5 star rating it truly deserves. If I do make it with some vanilla icecream on hand I will be sure to post pics. I would step on a Lego® for this recipe. Give this recipe a wizz I say its worth it, if you accidentally add too much apples and cause a time paradox try and preserve this recipe for the rest of us. Many thanks!

Simply delicious and so easy!  I made this just as the recipe is written and I really enjoyed it.  But next time, I think I'll add just a couple drops of vanilla extract and a couple tablespoons of brown sugar.  I may also add a little extra apple and cinnamon.  Anyway, the consistency is wonderful and it kind of just melts in your mouth.  Great dessert for the Fall.

We really liked this. Because I tend to be messy, I mixed the batter in a bowl and then poured it into a baking dish. I followed other reviewers and spread the apple all over the batter. In taste and texture this reminded me of the steamed apple pudding my aunt used to make, but took a 1/4 of the time to cook. Thankyou Laurie.

It was great! Made it for work, needed an extra dessert for a "Fall Favorites" menu real quick. I used extra apple, mixing it into the batter. I also added an egg. Served it with a little fresh cream drizzle dusted with a bit of cinnamon, wonderful...Could also make it to a brunch menu...

Very good, I did change the recipe a little bit for high altitude. I preheated the oven to 400 degrees. For the batter I used 1/2 cup dark brown sugar plus a 1/4 cup white, 1 tablespoon more of milk and about a 1/4 teaspoon less of baking powder. The butter, flour, cinnamon and salt I kept the same amounts. The apples I sautéed in a pan with some butter, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon cardamom, and 1/4 teaspoon salt until soft. I stirred the apples in the batter like others recommended put it in a glass pie pan and baked for 25 min. I served it with a drizzle of heavy cream, (very good) whipped cream would be very good too. It was fast I I liked it a lot, will make again.

Delicious!!  My hubby thinks it would be extra good with berries instead of apples - just skip the microwaving step.  I love that you can always have the ingredients on hand.  It would be good with canned pears or peaches - again skip the microwave step.  Thanks for sharing!

Changes (preparation mostly): I baked apples in the oven for 10 minutes, instead of microwaving them. Also, I mixed everything in a separate bowl, and then poured batter into the baking dish. Finally, I spread apples evenly around the dish, and not only in the center. It was easy, quick, economical and delicious! My fiance had seconds!

Super easy, but original recipe is a bit bland. I substituted dark brown sugar for white, added 1tsp vanilla, a bit of cardamom to the cinnamon, and it was fantastic. In my convection oven it took about 27 minutes. Served with fresh whipped cream, it becomes divine! I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but this is irresistible with a few modifications.

This recipe is not only super easy, but tastes wonderful!!  I made some modifications suggested by another person...sub cinn. w/ pumpkin pie spice and vanilla and used half white sugar half brown sugar.  I also made sure to distribute the apples evenly among the mixture, not in the middle as directed.  Not sure why it is suggested to pour it in the middle...I didn't need any vanilla icecream!  Next time I will use half wheat flour and half white just to see b/c I get the impression it will still taste just as good :)  YA GOTTA TRY IT!

Tasty and best of all, QUICK and EASY.  I made this on the way out the door to dinner at the in-laws and took it fresh out of the oven in an insulated carrier.  It's definetly not meant to be spongy and cake-like, but very moist and pudding-like.  I had no complaints, although next time I'll try it with less butter for calories' sake.  I'll also sprinkle the apples across the entire surface of the batter so that every slice gets its share.  Just had the leftovers for breakfast after warming them in the microwave.  Delicious the second time around too!

'Cake' part was good, but apples could have used something other than just Cinnamon.  Seemed to taste bitter...not a hit.

Thank you for a super recipe.  I took the advice of a number of reviewers and used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugars but other than that followed exactly.  Very nice look to it...it smelled wonderful in the oven...and, the taste was five star.  Thanks again!

amazing, fast and easy recipe! reduced the sugar (3/4c) and added nutmeg and cloves. I also mixed the apples throughout the entire batter (as suggested by other reviews) and it was way BETTER than i expected. Easy ingredients I always have on hand and a great way to use up apples you have lying around. Yumm!

Quick and perfect for that "need a little something" urge.  I used half the sugar, and would go less than that even.  Added nutmeg to the apples and a teensy tiny bit of more butter.  I will do it again, and add the vanilla ice cream like another reviewer suggested.

This is so easy even I got it right first time around, it is a lovely light pudding delicious with Vanilla Ice Cream it reminded me very much of Eve's pudding think it might be much the same recipe.

I tried to double this recipe and i wouldn't suggest it!  too soggy in the middle.  I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar.  I used store bought apples to make it superfast. will try again.

My husband LOVED this, which threw me because I really didn't expect he would like it that much. I made it with applesauce instead of apples, since I was having my tonsils out.  I am sure it is probably even better with the actual apples in it though. And yes, the ice cream makes it that much better.

Made it 3 times already. Use a hand whisk to ensure mixture is smooth, but that's not super crucial. Definitely stir in apples with rest of mixture.

This recipe was quick and easy. I did and walnuts and raisins and a little allspice and nutmeg.
I did find it a bit to sweet for me next time I will use 1/2 cup of sugar rather than the 1 cup it calls for

Hey, just had the random urge to make some cobbler and this was the first entry to pop up! I read some reviews and decided to do half-brown-half-white grain sugar, add in vanilla, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar when I served (with homemade vanilla Blue Bell, obv). It's a simple enough recipe, slicing the apples is a little hard on the hands (I didn't use baking apples, I just used what was available) but you do what you gotta do. My initial impression was that the batter was a tad soupy, with clumps of sugar that you can't simply "combine"- I would advise y'all to use a hand mixer. My fork just didn't cut it. It was super sweet, but the apples mellowed it out with the perfect level of flavor, and I was VERY impressed. Props to Miss LAURIE NANNI

I did change the recipe to accommodate my ingredients available. I used a can of apple pie filling, so I didn't add much cinnamon and only 3/4 cup nut milk (almond). I replaced white sugar with brown sugar and cut it down as well. I added 1/2 cup of pecans and 1/2 c of raisins and no butter. I also gave it an extra 5 in the oven and stirred it all together... Quite yummy.... Probably would be great the original way, but we don't use white sugar and rarely brown even... but since I already had the can of fruit ( can't imagine how I even had that, as we do almost all our cooking by scratch) what the heck a little brown sugar was fine. My wife will be happy to have a yummy warm treat on a cold spring day.

Super easy and delicious. Made it once it was yummy. The second time i messed up and mixed the cinnamon with the batter instead of the apples and it was waaaaay. Thats what made it a 5. i  used white sugar.
PS I poured the apples all over the top instead of just the middle. That way they are in every bite

I used 1 Granny Smith and 1 apple crisp apple, extra cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I cooked the apples in the microwave for 5 minutes. I then added them to the batter so it would all be combined and baked as suggested on 375 for 30 mins. I made a Carmel sauce to go with it. The sauce made all the difference. So easy and would definitely make again.

Fantastic! I substituted brown sugar for all of the white sugar and added a cup of chopped pecans.  In addition, I stirred the whole thing together so the apples were distributed evenly.  It was wonderful.  Everyone loved it -- and my husband asked me to make it again next week when his family comes for Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe yesterday and my husband loved it. I made some modifications (I cut the quantity of sugar and butter and as we don't have a microwave I used a spoon of butter, in which I cooked the chopped apples with cinnamon and 1/4 tea spoon of cardamon. As recommended by some reviewers I added a mix of brown and white sugar, and added vanilla sugar for flavor to the the batter. I also mixed the apples with the batter and  and it turned great! I will definitely make it again. simple, fast and delicious!

I made this to take to a potluck dinner with friends. It was a big hit! The only things I did differently was sub half of the white sugar with brown, because I was running low on regular white sugar, and add a splash of vanilla to the batter. Oh, and I took a couple other reviewers' advice and spread the apples around, instead  of putting them all in the middle. I served with caramel sauce and cool whip. Everyone loved it! I will be making this again soon.

Tried this recipe yesterday and it is awesome. I actually accidentally forgot to warm the apples before incorporating them into the pudding. I used Granny Smith apples and just mixed them into the pudding and just added the cinnamon and mixed it in too. I added a little more cinnamon then the recipe called for but this turned out awesome. The apples were a little chewier than they probably should have been, but I actually think I would like it better that way. Awesome recipe though, my family loved it.

I prepared this to the letter and it came out perfect...put apples in the center and they spread out very well. I made dulce de leche for a topping and I actually used gluten free flour and butter spread because my wife has celiac and she loved it! Thanks will be making this again and again

I made this to take to New Year's Day dinner at the inlaws.  It was a HUGE hit.  There wasn't time to cut up apples, so I used 2 cans of apple pie filling.  I rinsed the apples to remove the gooey stuff and coarsely chopped them.  The pie filling already had some cinnamon, so I only used half of what the recipe called for.  I also baked it for 45 minutes.  It was a nice golden brown color and it had set nicely.

Loved this! Prep time was much longer than expected. Also, is difficult to add servings. Otherwise great!

Super easy and absolutely delicious!! I used three Fuji apples and added nutmeg to the apples and cinnamon before cooking in the microwave and a bit of vanilla to the batter mixture. Yummy!

Was quite pleased with this one.  Is more a coffee cake, but the family gobbled it down with not one complaint.  So is a keeper!!!

I made this yesterday and it tasted great. I made some of the changes suggested: used half brown and half white sugar, added 1 tsp of vanilla, mixing apples in with the batter so they would be distributed evenly. Instead of adding the cinnamon to the apples, I added the cinnamon and a little nutmeg to the batter. It gave it a great taste. We ate it with warm caramel ice cream  topping. I may try it with peaches next time. will definitely make it again.

This is an amazing desert! The top gets crunchy around the edges and absolute heaven to eat. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added about 1/2 tsp of cardamum and 1 tsp of vanilla. I too spread my apples around the pan.

This was good...but just.  Hubby used vanilla ice cream and I did whipped cream and that was yummy.  I think I will just stick to flaky, crusty pies and cobblers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I decided to try this recipe because I had a bunch of apples on the verge of going bad, but not enough ap flour to make a traditional pie crust.  I have to say it's very tasty, even when you forget to add the salt!  I also took the advice of previous reviewers and substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar, and I had to use half cake flour because I didn't have enough regular flour, but it came out great anyway.  Perfect alternative for those of us who like apple pie but don't like the tough crust that comes with it.

This is the best, even for someone like me who cannot bake!  It is quick and simple and can be whipped up in no time.  Especially good during the fall harvest.
