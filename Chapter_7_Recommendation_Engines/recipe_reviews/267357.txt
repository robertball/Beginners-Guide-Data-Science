I added Pesto to the mustard! And of course minced garlic!  My husband and I made a dinner out of this but it would be delish for a football snack and a crowd!

Wow!  Not sure what I was expecting but this exceeded my expectations!  The dijon mustard and the tomatoes go well together. Next time I might add a bit more cheese or maybe sprinkle some on after it has cooled, but this was fabulous!

Came out great!! I followed the recipe exactly (used Chef John's recommendation to sub in Italian seasoning if you don't have herbs de Provence).  I didn't measure the dijon, just eyeballed it and spread on. I went with a nice thin layer. It's a strong flavor so for me, a little went a long way. If I had used more it may have been overpowering.
Topped with fresh Jersey tomatoes from a local market, this was a great side. Would definitely make again.

(Don't hate on me for changing to my taste) but I did want a puff pastry pizza and Chef's recipe technique allowed me to do that. I baked it as directed but used the exquisite pizza sauce recipe from here and mozzarella. Needed to cut some of the second cooking time. Delicious!

No sorry to say this recipe did not work out for me and my family. Too much mustard taste.  Chef John usually has some pretty excellent recipes.

This tart tasted even better than I expected. I made the full recipe and 2 of us ate it all. I will be making this again in a few days.

This was absolutely delicious.  A friend gifted me tomatoes from his garden which made this extra special.  So pretty.

Wasn’t crazy about the flavors and I don’t keep fresh herbs around and hate to buy them for one recipe.

Excellent recipe. The blend of flavors was delicious. I highly recommend. Easy to put together. I didn’t even have very good tomatoes, but wanted to try anyway. Can’t wait to get some  homegrown tomato and make again.

Delish! Love Chef John. Only baked ours for 20 mins and we used Italian dressing seasoning instead of herbs de provence because we had none. Great flavor!

Unique and tasty.  Heavy on the mustard flavor, but I liked that it was France-inspired and different from the usual pizza flavors.

Lovely simple tart to make as main or snack. It’s so beautiful and delicious to eat. I sprinkle a little bit Parmesan. The only question is - it seems 20 minutes will be sufficient.. I am going to try 5 mins left.

Loved it! Made as described, but had only "Country" mustard. It wasn't still delicious!  I live in a Motorhome and parked in high altitude. Raised temp 10 degrees an drew cooked the full 30 minutes. Delicious!

I liked it, (and I'm not even a huge tomato fan)...but no one else in the family seemed to.  Used sweet orange cherry tomatoes from the garden and Country Dijon mustard.  Consensus from those that didn't like was that mustard was somewhat overpowering.  But I liked it.
