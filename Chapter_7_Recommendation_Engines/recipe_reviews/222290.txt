I used whole peeled canned tomatoes in place of the raw Roma.  And, for the onions, I stewed them in the juice separately until almost transparent, before adding in the sliced tomatoes.  This method cuts down time for me, and I enjoyed this treat.  This was a nice variation.  Thanks!

This one was hard for me to rate. I thought it was ok tasting, but I feel that it was too much work (peeling, seeding the tomatoes) for just an ok result, IMO.  I do think that I prefer Italian-style stewed tomatoes over these, but that's just a matter of opinion also. I've never made my own stewed tomatoes, so this was fun to try. Just to be clear, the flavors were ok, I just prefer the other version...Thanks for sharing. :)
