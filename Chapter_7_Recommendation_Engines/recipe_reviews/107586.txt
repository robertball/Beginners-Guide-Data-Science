I've made this a couple of times and have been very pleased!  I actually take T-bones, cut them up into bite size pieces and marinade those.  I double the recipe, using about half for the marinade and reserving the other half.  I then end up stirfrying the steak pieces and marinade with broccoli, carrots, onions, mushrooms, etc. and using the reserved marinade as more sauce for the stirfry.  Serve over white rice and it's a fabulous Asian meal!

Holy crow I marinated my flank steaks with this (without the ginger which I didn't have) and they were out of this world! Mmmm the meat just melted in our mouths and the marinade is savory sweet... oooh I can't wait to have this again! Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was fabulous.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to double or triple the recipe, cook the leftover marinade in the oven while the steak is on the grill, and serve the steak in the juice. Do that, and you've got restaurant quality flavor.

I loved this recipe, I was somewhat skeptical at first because of the different ingredients however I really loved it. It kept the steaks moist and it was enough to add flavor and yet not overpower it. I did make one small change, I doubled the amount because I got thicker steaks.

Easy to prepare and the meat was very tender.  I was a little skeptical about the pan frying cooking method, but was pleasantly surprised

Superbe recette! J'ai oublie de mettre le gingembre, mais c'etait tres bon! J'ai fait marine toute une soiree. Un peu sale donc moins de sauce soya. BBQ sera probablement encore plus delicieux que sur la poele.

My husband liked these and said the teriyaki flavour was good. Marinated for about 4 hours, and the steak was tender and flavourful. Thanks!

Great recipe - the teriyaki taste was very pronounced.  I thought it was a little on the sweet side so next time I will lessen the amount of sugar used.  Grilled perfectly, though, and looked incredibly appetizing!  Very pleased guests!!

Well, the family (18 y-0 & 7 y-0) gave the meat sauce 2 thumbs up!  No time to marinate. I felt complled and added a spoonful of pinapple juice and doubled the ingredients for rice sauce. Also used fresh thinly sliced onion and garlic. Cut meat into small pieces, as usual, bottom round steak is always chewy. Thanx for the YUM.

This was fantastic! I used all the ingredients, though I used much less honey only because mine was all solid. Plus, I had limited time, so I sliced a large steak into small pieces and just marinated for half an hour. My picky hubby loved it, so I'll definitely be making this again!

This was amazing. I made Korean cut ribs with this recipe, and it was my first time making ribs. I have no tasted something so amazing. My husband, who has had ribs countless times, says these were the best he'd ever tasted. Five stars!

Great, easy marinade. My steak was a bit thicker than the recipe calls for, so the marinade burnt in the pan, but the meat was still great.

Husband and son loved this. They are big steak lovers and teriyaki always goes over well. I did, however, prepare this on the grill which came out wonderfully. Will be making this again. There are lots of ingredients, but the prep is very easy.

Translation of Diane's review = Superb recipe! I forgot to put the ginger, but it was very good! I did marine a whole evening. A little dirty therefore less soy sauce. BBQ will probably be even more delicious than on the poele

I make this probably 1x per week. Since starting Keto, I have eliminated the Sugar and Honey from the recipe, which doesn't affect the flavour at all. Delicious!

I made this with 3/4" rib eyes. Actually, the rib eyes were 1 1/2" thick but I cut them in half since such thick steaks would not marinate as well. I followed the marinade recipe exactly except that I doubled the ingredients since I had four steaks. I allowed them to marinate for two hours in the refrigerator, turning them over about every half hour. I broiled them in the oven to a nice medium rare doneness. My wife and her adult daughter both raved about them. They were tender and flavorful. I will definitely make them again.

Used brown sugar instead of  white sugar.  Marinade was delicious and not overpowering with flank steak.

Very nice marinade recipe, used on Rib Eyes first round. This time marinaded pork cutlets for wonton street tacos. Let sit for 7 hours and grilled for some stand out finger food, thanks for the marinade idea!

I doubled the recipe for three NY steaks, and added some toasted sesame seeds.  I also added one half of a ripe papaya to help tenderize the meat.  I marinated for 2-1/2 hours, and while this was delicious, I would definitely make it earlier in the day to marinate longer, but this was a great recipe.

This was great!  Marinated for about 4 hours, triple he recipe for sirloin steaks and cooked in a cast iron pan.  Sugar and honey burnt, four-six min on each side.  Heavenly!!!!

I made the marinade,put the steaks in and let sit for about 4 hours, was so tender and good. I would put them on a grill next time tho, in a regular pan it just made a god awful sticky mess,even my girls 8 and 9 loved it!

Good enough as far as it goes, but as a meal this recipe would benefit from some tips on  what to serve on the side.

It was good because it had a good taste, it smelled good.  I took a long time to make it so I could play a long time, and we tried our best and it turned out well.  The taste is just right for little kids like me and my little sister Abbie, and also pretty good for grown ups.  We made this many times in our life and each time it turns out well.  All the time we get the right ingredients for it that is how it makes it great. thank you for designing teriyaki steak recipe.

Amazing! I used rice vinegar instead of white.  BBQ on mesquite charcoals, 1 inch thick rib eye steaks, 6 minutes on each side, medium rare. Delicious!

Absolutely amazing.  I've only made this recipe with steak once, which was delicious, but this has become my go-to Teriyaki sauce!  I use if far more often with chicken or just to kick up a vegetable stir-fry.  It is super easy to make a double or quadruple batch of the sauce and store it for later.  I haven't had any trouble storing it in the fridge or freezer for a couple weeks to a month.

Made this exactly as specified with the only exceptions being no worshtashire (was out) n I added tbsp seasame oil to marinade. Was so good!! I loved the caramelized sear the honey creates. I couldnt resist sprinkling finushed stesk with seasame seeds. Next time I will use a thicker steak and grill.

To those that can relate...the Houston's Hawaiian might come in with 3 stars...main difference is that this meat was marinated all of the way through without ever making 1 small prick in it.....I marinated for 4 days turning 3-4x daily...I also used Brown Sugar and Apple Cider Vinegar. Threw on the grill....Hubby can't wait to have it again!

I don't know why anyone would marinate a rib eye steak as they are deliciously fatty and flavorful...BUT...this marinade is fantastic! I use it on flank steak or other cheap, but tough, cuts. Try using mock tender steak: tastes like tenderloin. Much better than bottled teriyaki marinade.

This marinade was awesome! Definitely using this many times in the future! I let mine soak for four hours and cut steak into strips then sauteed in skillet and put over white rice. Would also be great with chicken.

Whenever I make this I make sure to marinate it for at least 48 hours. It makes the meat so tender to the point of almost falling apart. I'm a college student, so at school I don't have this luxury, but when I was home my mom asked me to make this recipe on at least 3 different occasions. I myself like to use more sugar and honey to bring out the sweetness, but overall this is an excellent recipe. So delicious.

Great. I didn't have ginger but it did not matter.  It was delicious just the same.  I also rendered the left over marinade and poured it over the steak. . . .Fabulous!  I will keep this recipe.

Yummy!  My daughter picked this for her birthday dinner and it turned out fabulous.  Even my picky eater, who also doesn't eat a lot of meat, at it up!  I love how easy it is.  Thanks!

Very good marinade. Followed the ingredients but decided to grill the steaks instead of cooking it in a pan. Theres no other way to cook steaks except a grill in my book! YUM!
