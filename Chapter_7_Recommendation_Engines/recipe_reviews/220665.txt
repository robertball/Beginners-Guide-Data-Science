I loved the list of ingredients but was not happy with the result. I used frozen mini phyllo pastry shells because I searched high and low for the frozen tart shells to no avail. I think ready made pie crust cut into small circles and placed in a mini muffin tin would work as well. The filling was bland. I think it needs more seasoning or some fresh garlic to liven it up.

I made my own Gluten-free tart shells. Used spinach and artichoke with the other ingredients. Amazing! They were a Mother's Day success!!!
