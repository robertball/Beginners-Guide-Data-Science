This was excellent! The recipe submitter noted that the eggplant was optional and I did leave it out because we do not like it. I made two small changes. Pea shoots were nowhere to be found in my area and a google search said to use fresh spinach cut into strips for a substitute. This is a salad so I didn't see the need to cut them into strips but left the leaves whole. My other change is that I had 4 lonely mushrooms that needed used so I sliced them up and threw them in the mix. They worked well but were not a necessity. The recipe did not specify which color of grapes to use. After reading the ingredients in the dressing I assumed red and that is what I bought. Hindsight she might have meant green. My dressing was bright purple. It was pretty but unusual looking for sure. Hey it worked though so I think it is safe to say use whichever color of grapes you want. This was really good and would be perfect for summertime. I plan to try this again here in a couple of months when I can hopefully find the pea shoots at Whole Foods. The only reason I am rating this a 4 instead of a 5 is because it is a little too heavy on the mint.  Other than that, this is prefect!
