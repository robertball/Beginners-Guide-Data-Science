I wanted to make oven baked BBQ chicken, and my husband hates store-bought BBQ sauce. I coated the chicken with this recipe, and he ate it up! It was good before I put in on the chicken, but seemed to taste even better once it was baked for an hour.

I thought this tasted too much like ketchup and not bbq sauce. I ended up adding liquid smoke, molasses, steak sauce, and whisky in order to save the batch. It wasn't too bad after that, but I definately won't use this reciepe  again.

Very easy recipe to prepare.  We used this over pulled pork tonight.  This recipe is on the tart side, not sweet at all since there is no brown sugar, honey or molasses in it.  We liked it and I will make this again.

I typed in quick and easy BBQ sauce to make pulled pork sandwiches with leftover pork loin.    I chose this recipe because my husband much prefers sour to sweet.  I added 1/4 cup vinegar and changed nothing else.  We couldn't wait to eat as the aroma while simmering was fabulous!  So easy and all ingredients on hand.  I will never buy store bought sauce again.  Thanks Grandpa Crotts!

Tried it and sed it as a base and added to it. Molasses, more worcestershire sauce and some brown sugar and some jameson whiskey- it doesn't have a full bodied flavor and could use some smoke flavor but once I doctored it up it was good.

This recipe was a bit too tart for me as it stands. I added about 5 tbsp. brown sugar and 2 tbsp. molasses. Wasn't bad with the additions.

My husband isn't a huge fan of bbq sauce, but was very impressed with this.  Worked perfect in our "chicken" (morningstar farms strips) bbq salad!

I was looking for a BBQ sauce recipe that was family friendly.  I find smokey sauces too spicy for kids and all I taste is the sauce when there is so much smoke flavor.  I also left out the hot sauce and this sauce was delicious.  I tried it on chicken and ribs and it was great on both.  It is inexpensive to make with ingredients most people have on hand.  Will use this recipe again and again.

I needed a quick and easy BBQ sauce and this one hit the spot. I adjusted my seasoning to taste, but all in all this was a hit!
