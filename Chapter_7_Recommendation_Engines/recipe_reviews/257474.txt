This is a fun way to make spaghetti. I bet kids would love to have little nests of their own. I used chicken hot italian sausage from Sprouts. Also I added hot pepper flakes, because we love spicy! I've never been disappointed with Barilla brand products!

Very easy to get together on a busy weeknight.  The individual portion size is a great idea and kids will love having their own dish.  I topped mine with some fresh basil.

For a dish with so few ingredients this was one of the best meals we’ve had in a long time. The directions called for baking the pasta nests in 4-5 ramekins but I opted to bake them in two mini cast iron skillets. Those two servings could have easily feed 4.  This dish was even better after it had sat at room temperature for a couple of hours. In the past, I’ve used a different pasta sauce but that’s going to change. Barilla past sauce has more of an Italian flavor without the tangy after taste. My only suggestion would be to boil the pasta first so that it’s ready once the Italian sausage is cooked and drained. My only change to the recipe was to cook the pasta longer, because we like ours a little past the al dente stage.

Great dish, easy, quick to make and the concept of an individual serving is really interesting. 
This is for sure going to be a quick escape for the those evening when I don't want to cook for too long but still want to enjoy a good meal.

Delicious! Love the individual serving idea. I used barilla tomato basil sauce.  Decided to toss spaghetti with a tad bit a butter and Parmesan before placing in ramekin. Husband finished every bite of his and practically licked the bowl.  Winner dinner here!

Very quick and easy! After assembling the first one the next 3 I decided to toss the spaghetti with some marinara first. We preferred the later better. The layer of mozzarella cheese was key and delicious! I even added a little parmigiana. Loved the presentation! Next time, I make these I'm going to use my own homemade marinara, although, I was surprised at how well the barrila jar pasta sauce tasted.

This recipe is so simple yet so good!  I added in some grated Parmesan Reggiano cheese to the pasta for an extra kick!  This is the perfect weeknight meal!

I made mini meatballs with sage flavored Jimmy Dean sausage to go in the spaghetti nests and added a dash of parmesan under the mozzarella. I used the Barilla Tomato Basil pasta sauce. These were so delicious and fun to make and serve!

This is a nice recipe and I love how easy it can be scaled down for fewer servings. I think it could be improved by tossing the noodles in a little bit of butter and divide the mozzarella and use some in the noodles (even ricotta cheese could work) to ensure the nest stays together if served outside the ramekin.

I added the cooked sausage to the sauce, mixing it all together. Once baked, I topped the 'nest' with fresh basil. Next time I will add onions and bell peppers to the sauce. Cute presentation!

These are so fun. Serving them in ramekins is clever. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used pepperjack type cheese. I used Barilla gluten free spaghetti. Serve extra sauce on the side for anyone who might want it, but as is, we liked it. Thank you for the recipe.

We enjoyed this easy to make recipe very much!  Not a lot of fuss and the individual servings are great.  I may toss the spaghetti in the sauce next time around then build it a called for.  I also like to reserve a little sausage and sprinkle on top near the end of the oven cooking time.  Thank you!

A tasty dish that my whole family ate. My 3 year old grandson asked for more spaghetti. I loved the mozzarella cheese on top of the dish. I felt it made the dish.  I did mix the sausage in the sauce for easy prep.  I also added some sauce to the bottom before adding the rest of the ingredients. I browned the top under the broiler to get those yummy brown spots.  I also bought 2 jars of sauce because my family loves extra sauce. My husband has a big appetite, so he ate two of these ramekins. I will use a larger individual casserole dish for him next time.   I want to try this recipe in a casserole dish because I am sure it would work well.

What's not to like?! This would make a great individual side dish for a dinner party or something, or even made as a bigger casserole for the whole family, which is how I would do it next time to save on clean up. All in all very good and easy! Thanks for sharing. :)

I cut this recipe in half to have 4 individual servings. I loved having an individual baked spaghetti all my own. I liked the sausage and the Barilla sauce. I discovered, though, that I needed more sauce since we aren't typical noodle lovers. I added more to the noodles because I had it left. So, no problem. It would have been an issue had I made the full recipe, but an easy solution would be to use fewer noodles in the individual dishes. I added Parmesan and extra mozzarella. This is an easy and forgiving recipe to adjust to your own family's preferences.
