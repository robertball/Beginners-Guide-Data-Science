Excellent as written, but OUTSTANDING with the following: add 1 Tbsp of lemon pepper and 2 Tbps of grated parmesan (total of 3 Tbps). I kept the heat at 500, but covered it (lightly, not wrapped around the pan) with tin foil for the last 3-5 minutes, as it was showing signs of blackening. We will keep this one!

This recipe is so good. My boyfriend loved it.  I made a few minor changes to make it a little spicier for him.  I omitted the paprika and used chili powder instead. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I also used italian flavored bread crumbs instead of the plain. I will definately be making this again, its so easy!

I love Taste of Home recipes, and I love when subscribers are also able to comment on recipes we try.  I can't believe how simple this recipe was to make.  The only thing I changed was switching from Perch to Grouper.  Definately a great recipe.  I served this with steamed squash, zucchini, and julienned carrots that had a drizzle of butter, and sauteed garlic.  What a fantastic recipe.  Hubby mentioned, that next time "Cook more" there wasn't enough!

I prepared this with no modifications on perch.  Ultrasimple and ultrafast to prepare.  It was quite good, but could have used a little more zing for my taste.  As others have noted, it did need to be baked slightly longer than the 10 minutes the recipe calls for to get more crispiness out of the baking process.  I will make this again and will also try it on other kinds of fish.  Thanks, Carol!

This was really good- better than expected.  I used a basa fillet, was going to use two, but I didn't realize that the butcher (fishmonger?) only gave me one!  I increased the parm by a little and decreased the paprika.  I had a little extra butter left over, which I drizzled over the fish and baked at 400 instead of 500 for about 20 minutes (or so).  Served with Garlic Parmesan Orzo.  Very yummy.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this fish, I always prefer a non-breaded fish but this is super good: the best breaded (non-fried) fish I've ever had actually. I think it's the butter on the pieces before breading, I loved that idea. I ended up just melting it in a loaf pan and then coating the fish that way. I made the topping exactly as specified and while I will sub dill for the basil and add cayenne pepper in the future that's just preference. All that paprika gives this great deep rust color to the breading, I don't think I'll play with that amount just for the look. Thanks very much for sharing, I have a breaded go-to fish recipe now :)

This was delicious! The fish was really light and delicate. The crust was tasty, but could have had a little more kick to it. Maybe next time I will add some kind of pepper or lemon to the crust. I also added a little more parmesan than called for in the recipe. I will make this again! Thanks!

This was great and so easy, made with ingredients I keep on hand. I added a few shakes of Mrs. Dash Spicy for some added flavor per the pervious reviewer and I think it needed it. I will make this again. Even my 3 year old liked it.

Good, easy recipe.  Try brushing the fillets with olive oil instead of butter.  If you do have leftovers, they taste excellent when the original fish was not brushed with butter.   Simple and delicious.

My husband and I both enjoyed this fish but my two boys (3 & 5) did not care for it. I added some South African Peri Peri rub to add some zing but other than that followed the recipe. Oh...we had to bake it longer and put the broiler on for a few minutes at the end.

We have a lot of frozen lake perch that my husband caught last summer and I'm always looking for different ways to fix it. I made some adjustments to this recipe to suit our tast and it was delicious. First of all, I used Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs. We like the flavor and crunchiness of the Panko crumbs better. To my Panko crumbs I added dried parsley flakes, lemon pepper seasoning and parmesan cheese. It was wonderful and I'll use this recipe again and maybe try some other ingredients also to the crumbs.

This recipe was really good. My family really liked it. I was kinda leary about the topping because it didn't look much like cheese when I first put it on the fish, but it turned out great, like the photos. I will make this again.

According to Fishing Works the ideal way to estimate the amount of cooking time for perch is the measure the thickest point. For each inch of thickness cook it for 12 minutes (2 in thick = 24 minutes, etc) at 450 degrees. Removes the guess work of getting the perfect amount of time

I would give this 10 stars if I could! This tasted fabulous! I used Ocean Perch because that is what I had.I dipped the fish in melted butter then I used 1 cup of bread crumbs and half a cup of parmesan cheese to roll the fish in. I sprinkled the fish with Lawry's garlic salt, paprika, and pepper. My fish wasn't very big so I baked them at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, bigger pieces I would bake for 20 minutes. The Lawry's garlic salt, pepper and paprika sprinkled on lightly, combined nicely together to give it a delicious garlicky taste. My husband is so picky that he's a pain, and he just adored it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Used the basic premise of this recipe, only I added some seasonings to the bread crumb/parm mixture (making it more of a cajun-y mix).  It was by far and away the best fish I have ever cooked (and really, it takes a lot for me to even eat fish...I am just trying to force myself to eat it as of late).  It was slightly better when served with a nice remoulade.  Thanks!

This was pretty decent as-is, but was a little bland for my tastes. With some adjustments and additions, it was a huge hit with my boyfriend and me. I doubled the Parmesan, used Italian seasoning instead of just basil, and added salt, Chesapeake Bay seasoning, lemon pepper, and a bit of chili powder for extra kick. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out soggy and did not have a good flavor. I do not know what I could have done wrong, as this is a simple dish, but we could not even eat it.

This is a good seasoning for fish, I'll continue to use it with other types in the future.  I substituted corn flake crumbs in place of bread crumbs out of personal preference.

I'm not a fan of fish but I thought this was delicious. I didn't use paprika because I didnt have any, but I did sprinkle some Tony Chachere's seasoning to give it a little kick. Will definetly make again.

Wonderful!! This will be my go to recipe for perch and walleye from now on. The breading was terrific. All 4 of my children ate this. I didn't have the lemon pepper so I substituted cajon seasoning and seasoning salt. Love this.

Really good! Tried this with perch from one of our local lakse :) Used Panko instead of bread crumbs, but added Italian bread crumbs (?1/4 cup) Doubled the panko & parm cheese. Added couple generous shakes of lemon pepper, dash of onion powder, dash of garlic salt. Also melted about 4 TB Butter and dredged all the fish into it to coat well prior to dredging through the crumb mixture. Had a little left over, so I tried Imitation Crab as well. That was Even BETTER Than the fish, but should have been baked a little less!! Baked at 450 for 10 min (filets were on the small side) Then turned up to 500 for 2 minutes to get them good and crispy. Didn't burn at all and were done perfectly! Next time I might add a little salt and sub the butter for something more healthy-otherwise LOVED IT! Will make this again!

This was an awful waste of freshly caught lake perch and Italian imported parmagiana.  Should have known something was wrong when the recipe completely lacked salt.  The bread crumb mixture, with its overabundance of paprika, resulted in the taste of an uncooked batter around these tasty morsels. 

Thankfully, we had cooked fish two ways, so half of the fish entree was edible.  The Baked Parmesan Perch became dog food, regrettably.

Excellent base recipe.  Here are my modifications to add that "kick" other reviewers were talking about- Louisiana style: I doubled the Parmesan, halved the paprika, omitted the basil, and added the following: ~1/8 t cayenne pepper, ~1/8 t Tony Chachere's, ~1/2 t lemon pepper.  Absolutely awesome.  I had left over breading so I threw it on some green beans halfway through sauteing them and they were awesome too- would undoubtedly be good on chicken, other veggies, potatoes, etc. as well.  Also the perch I had was from the frozen section and very thin and small (quite an upsetting surprise...), so I baked it for 8 minutes on 400 and it turned out great. The breading really saved it.

This is now my favorite baked fish recipe.  I think that this recipe is quick and easy. I love how the fish turns out slightly crispy. The next time I might try to spice it up by adding some hot pepper.

I used this recipe as a base for the ingrediants I had.  I substituted crushed wheat saltine crackers for the bread crumbs and a basic Italian seasoning for the basil. Wish I had the basil but the Italian worked great. I also added some onion and garlic powder. Tastes great. Also alterd the cook time and temp to 20min at 450 like some recomended. This turned out perfect. Cheers

Good, but it seems to be missing something, and I'm not sure what. We did add a pinch of garlic powder.

so delish! i used 3 tbsp of parmesan cheese and 1 tbsp of lemon pepper-the extra zing really did help! i also used panko breadcrumbs for an extra crunch. I paired the perch with herb roasted potatoes. yummo!

My family didn't like this one. Maybe it was the fish, but I also know it never got crispy (and I cooked it longer). Not our favorite, sorry.

As written, I'm not sure that this would be very good. There is way too much paprika, in my opinion. I doubled the amount of crumbs and cheese, used the same amount of basil, cut the paprika down to one tablespoon, and then added about 1/4 tsp of salt. It came out absolutely delicious this way, and my whole family (even those who don't care for fish!) loved it! My oven tends to overheat, and I was pretty scared to try baking something at 500 degrees, so I baked it at 400 for about 10 minutes, and then at 350 until it was done. The coating was pretty, crispy, and flavorful...just what I was looking for! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is the BEST fish recipe I have tried in a very long time...I used Tilapia.  My husband ate it right up and asked me to make it again soon. That's a bonus since he is not a big fish fan.

This recipe did not have enough bread crumbs compared to paprika. It was not crispy at all and my children wouldn't eat it. Fortunately, I had a sauce my husband and I ate with it to make it bearable.

This recipe was a hit with the family - all three kids & my husband liked it.  My husband was late from work and we wanted to eat his share before he got home!  My picky eater even asked for seconds!  I was looking for something new for Lent.  This recipe was so easy & healthy, I think we'll add it to our regular rotation!
I used a mild fish that was on sale and I added a little dash of garlic salt and omitted the paprika.  Otherwise, followed the recipe ingredients.  Baked in 425 degree oven for 20 minutes so that the fish finished at the same time as the pecan brown rice simmering on the stove.  No need for foil to prevent overburning.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe except for substituting panko bread crumbs instead of regular ones (since what I had in my pantry).  We didn't like it so much - the paprika was too dominant for our taste.

Excellent recipe...easy and tasty. We added touches of Old Bay, lemon pepper, and red pepper to spice it up a smidge, as others had suggested. The perch came out of the oven with a crispy crust, but tender inside. Good alternative to heavy breading and frying.

This is good, gives a crispy and mild fish that even the kids liked...although perhaps it is a little bland as written like other reviewers have suggested. Since my in-laws gave us 10lbs of perch (!) I've tried this recipe again a couple more times with modifications. I marinated the fillets for 30 minutes in an herb marinade I usually use for chicken (it's similar to an Italian dressing), that really helped give it zing. The next time, I marinated the fish but I was out of bread crumbs so I also used crushed corn flakes instead for the coating - yummy! This was definitely our favorite version. Thanks for sharing a versatile recipe!

This was very good! I used twice as much parm as bc's and doubled the quanity. I brushed it with a flavored olive oil first instead of butter. I have done both Tilapia and Whitefish and this has become my go to for fish in a hurry. I have also grilled them in a foil pan and will use a plank when the weather! Thanks!

I melted the butter in the microwave then dipped fillets in butter then in the bread crumb mixture.  There was some butter left over so I decided to pour some on the fish for extra flavor.  Baad idea.  It ruined the texture and made the fish mushy.  Don't put butter on the fish when baking.  The flavor was OK.

When swapping the paprika for ground red pepper, this was FANTASTIC. I used just enough for a little spice and even our finicky eaters ate it ALL and were fighting for the last piece. Highly recommend it!

I added a little lime juice to the butter and to the bread crumb mixture more parmesan, chili powder, garlic powder, and  dash of salt and pepper. The topping looked delicious when finished and tasted great but didn't impart much flavor to the fish and it tasted pretty bland.

I made this with some modification - I used 2 T. of Parmesan Cheese, 1 tsp. Lemon Pepper Seasoning, reduced the paprika to 1 tsp.  I forgot the basil.  I brushed the fish with butter but just sprinkled the topping on the fish.  I baked it from frozen because I was in a hurry and didn't have time to thaw so topping was not crunchy but it was tasty.  We liked it, my husband more than I.  Will probably make this again with thawed fish.

Very good.  I ran out of bread crumbs so added whole wheat cracker crumbs.  Line your pan with parchment paper to avoid greasy, fishy cleanup.  My 11-year old assembled this with ease.

My local supermarket doesnt sell tilipia anymore so I decided to try perch. To my surprise I liked Perch better taste alot like tilpia but doesnt get mushy. This is a good start to my perch eating adventures and since there are only 3 perch recipes Ill have to do recipes that call for tilpia but use perch. This was light and simple and will probally make again but doctor it up.

This made for some good, easy, fast perch.  I did cut back on the paprika, doubled the parmesan, and added 1t each of lemon pepper and Tastefully Simple's Garlic Dill seasoning.  Instead of dipping the fillets in the seasoning, I just covered the top of each after brushing on the melted butter.  The fish was juicy with plenty of flavor.

My husband loves perch. I think its too bland. I cooked this recipe because I wanted to find a way to make it that would satisfy him. It came out so well that I wanted to taste some, but he gave some to our son and there was nothing left. 

I did turn down the temperature a little, and I did not have the Parmesan so I did without it.

My family loved this recipe.  I used pollack fish and added a bit more seasoning to it than the recipe called for, but as a base recipe, this one is a keeper and I will follow it often!

This was okay.  I added crushed red pepper and white pepper for a little more spice. Like others suggested, I cooked it far longer than what the recipe called for.  I cooked for about 20 minutes and it had a nice crispy cruch on the bottom.  Next time, I will try flipping the fish half way through cook time to (hopefully) get more crunch to the crust.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I only gave it four stars because I took the advice of other reviewers and added a bunch of lemon pepper. Without this extra flavor, I think the fish wouldn't have been flavorful enough.

I used pollock, I used panko and it was a quick and tasty way to cook fish.  It didn't make the house smell fishy, which is nice.

I made this using tilapia filets and my wife loved it. I did add Kosher salt and black pepper to taste. She's never been a big fish eater, but she's asking me to cook fish at least once a week.

It was OK.  I expected more out of the spice mixture, but it fell a bit flat for me.  The fish was light and flaky, however.

It didn't turn out crispy I even cooked it for extra time to try to crisp the outside of the fish.  The flavor wsan't what we expected either.

I did not like this recipe. taste, which I think it was the basil. Those two things are a bad combination when mixed with a relatively strong tasting (to me) white fish like perch. I won't be making this again.

This was excellent with the lemon pepper added, but instead of the butter and to cut calories I used canola oil to brush on fillets and lowered oven temp to 450* for 15 minutes. Came out perfect and this was using fresh caught perch! Thanks for the recipe idea! Love it!

Mmmm...delicious. Can do this with a variety of fish. The ONLY changes I made were that I used fresh basil as I had a ton in my garden and I squeezed lemon juice over the fish. So good!

Good stuff.  We tried it with two small perch filets and two larger tilapia filets (just what we had lying around).  Wasn't great on the tilapia but I don't love tilapia to begin with.  Was EXCELLENT on the perch.  Will definitely make this again with perch.  THANKS!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I made it for my husband tonight and he loved it.  You can spice it up if you like.  I only had Tilapia as perch is not as readily available in OK and I added a little lime pepper but that was the only change.

This fish dish was delish! I changed it up some with Italian bread crumbs, fresh grated Romano cheese, onion flakes, a little parsley, crushed red pepper, and McCormick Roasted Garlic & Bell Pepper blend. I also put some minced garlic in the butter before coating the fish. My 6 year old boy and I loved it. We will definitely make this again!

Wonderful! I took the other suggestions and cooked the perch at 500 degrees for about 13-14 minutes. I also added an additional tablespoon of parmesan cheese as well as a tablespoon of chilli powder.

Although I love fish, I never would have thought that I'd like perch this much!  I think it might be the high temp for such a short time.  I used 1 tblsp. butter substitute plus the tblsp. butter.  I also changed up the breading (and made more than called for):  1/4 cup crumbs to 1/4 cup parmesan, and I used Hungarian paprika (1 tblsp) - hot!  I also added the lemon pepper (another tablespoon).  Other than the heat it wasn't that spicy, so next time I will probably back off the hot paprika and balance with some regular, and maybe add some garlic powder.  Overall it was definitely a "make again" recipe for fish and so quick and easy!

My son asked for seconds on the fish, so it was a winner for him.   I didn't use it as written, though. It was more the method than anything else.  I started with garlic herb crumbs, added paprika, smoked paprika, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, pepper, and salt. Forgot the cheese til after I had it all put together, and then I grabbed the wrong cheese! I had havarti in my hand, wondering why it was so soft and sticky. :p Anyway, I put the cheese on top of the crumbed fish, then more crumbs over that.  Baked at 500 in a dark nonstick pan for 20 mins  in the upper portion of the oven, along with a cookie sheet of roasted red potatoes in the lower part of the oven, and it was done nicely.  Anyway, the method was good. I liked all the extra herbs and spices, and it definitely came out crusty. I put too much salt in, but if I back off on it, I think this will be a go-to method for strong-flavored fish.

This was delicious!  It was quick, easy, and much healthier than frying.  I live in the South and frying is the traditional way.  I didn't have any basil but I added a small amount of onion and garlic powder with a dash of Old Bay seasoning.  YUM!

I have never made perch before, and I will never make it again. My family really didn't like it. I had to make a lot more breading for my pound of fish. The amount the recipe called for was not nearly enough. It is a typical breaded fish, we just did not like the taste of perch.

This was super easy and tasted great! I followed exactly and loved it. I used redfish and it cooked in exactly 10 minuites. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe!

Delicious!  I also cooked it a little bit longer, until the edges started to get dark, and added lemon pepper and oregano to the bread crumbs.  I served it with penne topped with sauteed red peppers, red onion, garlic, and asparagus and spinach in a butter/chardonnay sauce.  It was AMAZING!  My husband said perch is one of his new favorite fish!

It needed just a bit more baking to be all the way done. It also could have used a little more flavor. I don't care for fish, but so far this is the best of three recipes I've found. It didn't taste really fishy when it was done and it looked pretty good. My husband said he'd eat it again, but wouldn't go "slap-dog crazy" over it. Keep in mind, I'm not very good at cooking fish, so people who know what they're doing will probably get a much better result.

I used tilapia instead of perch.  This was super easy to make and really tasty.  I sprinkled a bit of white pepper on the fish before dipping it into butter.  I also used a tad more parmesian cheese.

I added 1 tbls mrs. dash lemon pepper, and added a tbls parmesan.  It was delicious, super easy and quick.  Maybe could have used a bit less paprika for my taste...

Very tasty & very easy to make! I didn't have paprika (I also find paprika to be bland tasting) so I used lemon pepper instead as suggested by another reviewer and it was yummy! Thanks!

This looked really good out of the oven and was easy to prepare. It wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. I followed the recipe and even used a seasoned breadcrumb, but it wasn't that flavorful. It definitely needed salt! I probably won't make it again...

This was overall a good and flavorful way to make baked fish. Usually you find baked fish to be lacking in taste when you don't use a ton of butter etc. Also works well with other fish like Flounder. Definitely use the lemon-pepper for extra flavor, or your favorite herbs...

My husband and I were looking for a new way to bake fish.  This recipe was wonderful except my young daughter did not seem to care for it. For a family with young children maybe not the best choice.  I used butter flavored cooking spray instead of the melted butter and added some salt to the seasoning mix.  Overall a great recipe.

I used tilapia and mixed Italian and panko bread crumbs. Took advice of others and added garlic powder, red pepper flakes and lemon pepper, and an extra tablespoon of parmesan. BUT it still wasn't crispy and it tasted bland. I will not be trying this again.

The cooking method for this recipe is good...I like that it is baked and not fried.  It cooked perfect at 500 for ten minutes.

I only gave three stars because it was bland.  I did not have lemon pepper seasoning as others suggested, so I will try that next time.  I thought the basil was overwhelming a little and didn't go well with the fish...I think I may have put too much, but I still don't like the spice combo.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  When the fish was done, it looked heavily spiced, but it tasted surprisingly bland.  Rather than being crisp after baking, it was crumbly.  Before eating the fish, I sprinkled some garlic powder on each piece simply to give the dish a bit more pizzaz.  Sorry.  This recipe was just not for me.  :(

FANTASTIC! So easy, my 9 year old made it! Served over an almond mushroom rice pilaf...and added minced jalopenos on top (without the seeds) and used EVOO instead of butter.

Flavor wasn't great even after adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Had to triple the breading and butter to coat 1lb of fillets.  Temperature and cooking time were perfect though.

The fish cooked beautifully but the flavour was lacking. The paprika overwhelmed the basil and parma, so it was very one-dimensional. I look forward to trying different flavour combos.

I just tried this recipe on my family tonight. It was a little too bland for our taste, but all in all a great substitute for actually frying the fish.
