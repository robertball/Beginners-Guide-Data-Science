I had an urge for a Tim Horton's Iced cappuccino one day and found this recipe. I think it's awsome, but a litte tip of variation for iced cap lovers: Instead of putting the coffee and milk mixture in a glass of ice, blend it in with the ice in a blender, if you have an ice breaker. The taste and texture are almost like the one at Tim Hortons. Try it, you'll get hooked and won't have to spend two dollars at Timmy's every morning.

I did a new variation of this recipe with great results: decaf coffee crystals, sugar substitute and fat free french vanilla dairy creamer--enjoy, I did.

This "cafe au lait" is simple, inexpensive and
quick to prepare. I liked it for those reasons.
If you happen to have (non-instant) expresso available this recipe will be as good as Starbucks, at a fraction of the price. Thanks for
your wonderful recipe Christy!

Even better with a little flavoring or flavored syrup. I up the coffee granules to a couple tablespoons because I like my coffee STRONG. UPDATED REVIEW: I now make this with Truvia sweetener or Starbucks sugar-free vanilla syrup and nonfat milk. One of the best ways I can get caffiene quick on busy mornings.

Delicious!  I'm not a very strong coffee drinker so after tasting I added a smidge of choc syrup and that did the trick.  I used one of my left over baby food jars for mixing the coffee mixture and that was the perfect size!  Thanks for the great recipe

***Add the milk before coffee. I was a barista and learned that coffee directly over ice causes bittering! Simple and easy!

I can just feel my wallet getting fatter!  This recipe is going to save me so much cash!  It's really, really good and even easier than driving through the drive-thru at Starbucks!!  I made it exactly as is except that I added 2 tbsp. of liquid Vanilla creamer!  Yummy!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

Very good and very refreshing - I don't drink hot coffee, but for some reason I love it cold.  This was great over crushed ice and topped drizzled with a bit of chocolate syrup.

As students studying into the wee hours of the night, this concoction takes us all of two minutes to make and saves us plenty of money, to boot.  We even have a system.  With 24 oz widemouth canning jars, we double the recipe (using four packets of Splenda), close lid, and shake.  Then we add skim milk up to the 16 oz line and ice, shaking once again.  I like to make it mocha with 1/2 tsp of cocoa powder, and have found that keeping the sugar in a jar as well is handy, because you can use the same lid for shaking.  Sorry about the long review!  We have obviously put too much thought into this for our own good!

As a single gal out in the world, this is a great (and cheap!) way to make a wonderful iced coffee.  I also tried it with some of the Folgers Cafe Latte instant coffee--great when you want a flavored iced coffee.

I just want to thank whoever created this recipe. When I was in Japan my host family always made me the best iced coffee from a Nescafe instant iced coffee mix. Unfortunately, that's not available here, but this recipe is just as good! It's especially great for the hot weather we've been having here in Connecticut recently.

I, too, used the Folgers cafe latte (mocha flavor)and added an oversized full scoop (comes with Folgers latte)of the mix to make this a bit stronger.  Not the same as Starbucks and others, but decent for a taste at home!

LOVE!!!!! I used to be a barista in a cafe that served Starbucks coffee, and I must say this on par with many of their iced beverages!!! For Frappucino addicts: I substituted the milk for evaporated milk, added an extra tsp of coffee, a shot of caramel, a shot of vanilla  and blend with ice to make the most delicious (and cost effective) caramel frappucino!!!! Adjust the amount of ice to your liking. I tend to make mine runnier b/c it blends better. For Mocha Frapps, substitute the caramel for a couple shots of chocolate syrup. I just used to cheapo off brand stuff and it worked marvelously!!

This recipe is fantastic! I wanted a cool pick me up on a hot afternoon, I was going to go the corner or my street to a very pricey coffee house to get an iced coffee....but then realized I can make it for pennies a glass at home.
I used a teaspoon of sugar with a teaspoon of hot chocolate powder. I suggest this if you  want it more like a mocha drink. This taste like a $6.00 coffee house drink....you have to try this recipe. I will be making it again.
Thanks!

Absolutely fantastic. I make it a little differently by adding about a teaspoon cocoa powder and 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract and blending the whole thing together. Yum!

This was great! I added a tiny bit more sugar because I like these drinks sweet. I added a couple squirts of dulce de leche syrup too, well, because I like things sweet :-) Thanks for sharing! I just saved $4 something instead of cruising to Starbucks.

A delicious coffee, and as a Type 2 diabetic, I changed the recipe a bit to suit my taste.  I used 2-1/2 tsp. of NESCAFE' DECAF  instant coffee, 1 packet of SACCHARIN SWEETENER (in place of  the granulated sugar), 3 TBSP. of warm water, plus I used 6-oz. (3/4 cup of 2%  milk), and I only added 2 ice cubes to my glass, so not to dilute the taste of the coffee.

Coffee is one of those things that varies drastically by the individual.  That said, you need to tailor this recipe to suit your tastes.  I like mine on the extra cream, extra-extra sugar side.  I didn't have a spare jar to shake with, so I heated a 1/4 C water in a measuring cup for 30s in the microwave, then stirred in the instant coffee (a little shy of 2 tsp because I found this a tad potent), 3/4 tsp stevia powder, and 1/4 tsp cocoa powder.  I poured it over ice in a glass and added the milk and a splash of heavy cream.  Excellent!  I made quite a few of these yesterday!

Not bad. I added some chocolate syrup to take away the initial "bite" of the coffee. Pretty good. Will probably be my new summer coffee drink!
Update: Add about 1/2 tsp to 1 tsp of vanilla. This is such a great base recipe...you can really add your favorite things and play around with it to suite your preference. Thanks for listing it!

We all loved this.  We added a bit more sugar and some vanilla syrup, which made it 1st class.  One word of caution to others - make sure the water is warm, NOT hot.  My water was too hot, and when I went to shake the container, the top exploded off and I had coffee all over my kitchen - and I mean ALL OVER.  My son looked at me and said "is there still enough to make the iced coffee?"  There was, and we really enjoy it.

Not being a real coffee drinker, I found this tasty and refreshing. I followed the advise of another reviewer and blended everything together. Since we're having a heat wave, I have been looking for cool and refreshing drinks. This is one recipe that I will go to.

I had to improvise, as I do not have a very well equipped kitchen. But overall, It was good and it's great for when you need an iced coffee fix but can't afford *designer* coffee!

Delicious! Finally an iced coffee recipe I can make easily from home. I always add a bit of flavoured creamer in addition to the milk. So yummy!

Perfect. I am 6 months pregnant, and have had a heck of a time drinking coffee... but iced coffee, specifically this recipe, gets me my coffee fix. I add vanilla syrup to it. Tastes like coffee shop quality! I'm one happy pregnant lady because of this! Thanks!

I guess this is okay in a pinch but it won't be a repeat for me.  I missed the fresh-brewed coffee taste of the "real thing."

You can make this a real diet friendly drink by using splenda, skim milk and about 1 cup of ice. Whip it in a blender and you have a smoothie.  I have a ice maker so my cubes/slices are small.

This is a very interesting iced coffee. It had a very strong coffee flavor so I added more milk and more sugar. Now it tastes very good! (not to mention how yummy it looks!!) I will defiantly have it again.

I'm a coffee snob and would NEVER use instant coffee, but this recipe had a lot of good reviews so I decided to try it.  So glad that I did!  It's better than than the iced coffee I get at starbucks!  I used splenda and a little bit of vanilla - just for my personal taste - SO GOOD!  Thanks!

Yummy! I emptied out a baby jar to shake 2 tsp Swiss White Chocolate (general foods international brand), 1 packet Splenda and 3 TBS of warm water. After I poured milk in my glass I added 1 TBS Sugar Free Caramel Coffee Syrup (Archer Farms brand from Target). Also, I used frozen coffee cubes so it's not watered down. No more spending $$ at Starbucks this summer!! Thanks for sharing!

this is a great, easy recipe. i love it in the summer! i use instant coffee for a hot cocoa recipe in the winter, and i often have lots of it in the cupboard. this is such a great use for it in the summer! i added some whipped cream to the top and some chocolate shavings. my coworkers were impressed to learn that it came from my kitchen, not a fancy coffee shop!

This is a really good and quick iced coffee, much cheaper than buying one. Some changes I will make later today when I have another one are: I will only use 1 Tsp.of coffee and half the sugar.  I found the coffee was too strong and I don't really care for things too sweet.  Sure will save about $3 - $4 per day.  Thanks for the recipe Christy.

I made this last night for my DH and I and we really enjoyed it.  I tripled the ingredients to make 2 servings, but instead of 3 tsp of sugar, I added 2 Tbsp. I also added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  The next time, I will try adding a bit of chocolate syrup to make an iced mocha!

This recipe was very good. Kind of bland but adding more instant coffee helps. You might want to double the recipe though. As posted it only makes about half a cup of iced coffee.

This is a very simple drink, but I appreciate the recipe because I struggle to get the ratios of milk, ice and water right. I also think shaking it up helped. 
I use Mt Hagen freeze dried coffee. I only needed 1 tsp of it and a scant 1/2 tsp of sugar.

My 13 year old loves iced capps, but with the instant coffee I had on hand, this was "too coffee-ish" for her.  We added chocolate syrup and followed the advice in another rating re: putting it in the blender. We'll save money and get to have them more often!  Thanks for the recipe.

I'll admit that I'm very spoiled with my normally organic, cold-press coffee (if you love iced coffee, look up 'cold press toddy' on amazon and buy one for yourself- they will change your life), but this was straight up nasty.  

Straight up nasty.

Made according to recipe except that I used soy milk and stevia (sweetener).  I thought it needed a little more flavor so I added about a TBSP of hazelnut liquid creamer which made it quite tasty.

This is VERY good and super easy!  I doubled up on the sugar.  Can take my hot coffee black but when it's iced for some reason I need some sweetness.  Perfect to give me a the little boost I needed this afternoon ;)

Very nice iced coffee. I add a bit less instant coffee and a bit more sugar (about 1.5 teaspoons of each) and that is exactly to my taste. Yum!

Very easy to make! My boyfriend thought the coffee flavor wasn't strong enough, while I thought it wasn't sweet enough. Clearly it's just a matter of taste. This recipe was a great starting point with very simple directions. I used 2 1/2 tsp. of sugar in mine with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. Yum!

Why pay 2.50 at mcdonalds for one medium iced coffee when you can buy some instant coffee grandules and a gallon of milk for a total of 6 dollars and make AT LEAST 16 of those iced coffees with them?? Especially when it only takes litterally 2 minutes to make??? This recipe is fabulous. Super easy to make and will save you a lot of money in the summer heat. Even faster than going in a drive through or line at Mcdonalds, Dunkin donuts or starbucks. I just microwave some water for 30 seconds, take a spoon and eyeball 3 tablespoons, add the coffee grandules (which can also be easily eyeballed after the first few times) and sugar to that mix, put this water coffee and sugar mixture into a cup full of ice and fill that cup with milk of your choice, , stir, add more sugar optionally to your taste, enjoy, soo simple and soo delicious and french vanilla coffee creamer would make it even better!, you can do many variations, adding a little caramel topping, adding a little cocoa powder or chocolate syrup, you name it! THANKS!!

This is ok. I made it the first time and decided it was the typ eof coffee I used. The next time I used a different brand and instead of the sugar and milk, I used sweetened condensed milk. I also a pinch of cardomom for a "Thai iced coffee" type of drink.  Just make sure you use a good brand of instant coffee.

I'm absolutely LOVING iced coffee this summer!  To make it even better, save your leftover coffee to make coffee ice cubes--this way your drink won't get watered down!

So addicting and delicious! My husband and I have been making this daily ever since I found this recipe and it has now replaced my normal cup of hot coffee. I really believe that the brand of coffee that you use really makes a huge difference in flavor. My personal favorite that I've been using is original Maxwell House instant coffee granules. It has a nice smooth nutty flavor to it, almost like caramel. The only thing that I change is the amount of sugar, a little more, a little less, depending on what I'm on the mood for that day. Give this a try, it really is good and easy plus it saves you money :)

I love quick easy recipes, especially ones that can satisfy a craving much cheaper! After making this recipe I now realize how much sugar the coffee shops, etc. put in their iced coffes.  I could actually taste the coffee in the one I made!  I used Juan Valdez instant coffee, as it was what I had on hand. I whipped the 1st 3 ingredients with my aerolatte (hand-held milk foamer), as I do not have empty jars lying around.  And, made in about a minute. Thank you for submitting! Added note: Tried making second time as other reviews said and added some chocolate syrup.  Added about 1 teaspoon. Was a great idea! Gave it a slightly sweet iced cafe mocha type taste. Although, I will more likely just drink it as is.
One week later: I BELIEVE I AM ADDICTED TO THIS DRINK NOW! I HAVEN'T MISSED ONE DAY SINCE THE FIRST DAY I STARTED DRINKING IT! I CAN EVEN MEASURE THE INGRIEDIENTS BY EYE NOW! It is like havening an unlimited supply of frappucinos in my cubard.

I saw this in the recently reviewed recipes and had to get up right then to make it.  It is wonderful and so easy...and will be so easy to make variations of it.***2 packets of Splenda work well instead of sugar.  Also, my taste preference is 3 tsp. instant coffee.

To me, this was bitter and not nearly sweet enough.  Doctored it up with more sugar and chocolate syrup which totally upped the calories.  Not worth the effort to me.

So ridiculously easy and tasty, I simply had to give it 5 stars.   I too used a small squirt of chocolate in coffee/water/sugar mixture before shaking, and poured over crushed ice.  Wonderful. Thank you so much for recipe.

This is absurdly easy- as in why the heck didn't I think of this before?- and it is great! Using decaf coffee crystals, a packet of Splenda & skim milk, this is a wonderfully tasty (and low-cal) way for me to get more calcium during pregnancy. I can't wait to get home to make it again!

This is a fantastic recipe I see myself using every morning!  It is just too hot for hot coffee, so this is the perfect way to get your caffeine fix.  Generally, I am not a fan of instant coffee, but it works for this recipe.  I used Splenda and skim milk, and it was still perfectly delicious.  I've also jazzed it up with french vanilla creamer and chocolate syrup.  Thanks for a great, quick, money-saving recipe!

This one gets 5 stars, I love this stuff, just as it's written! It is perfect for my Magic Bullet. Add the coffee, warm water and sugar to the magic bullet mug and swish around a bit to dissolve the sugar. Add the 3/4 cup milk. (I also add 2 ounces of vanilla creamer for the taste.) Fill the mug the rest of the way with ice. Twist onto the Magic Bullet base to grind it up (30-45 seconds), twist off and drink it right out of the mug. It's awesome! I had my MB for 2 years and used it once, I use it daily now! Thanks for the recipe.

This is an AWESOME recipe. This evening I had to have iced coffee and so I made this recipe. I made enough for 4 servings (to share it) and it is delicious. Instead of a shaker I used my trusty blender and added 12 ice cubes (one at a time) to the liquid so that it would be really cold. It was!I also added an extra teaspoon of instant coffee powder when it was all done being blended - just for added coffee zing.

It was so simple to make! A little strong for me to start, so I added a tsp more sugar. I made 2 'batches' & added flavoured coffee cream the 2nd time around. Was just like Tim Hortons' Iced coffee with a vanilla flavour shot!! Will definitely make again!!

Wow! This is a great Iced Coffee. I was hooked on Starbucks Iced Coffee, and had to quit drinking it do to allergy reactions. I'm not good at trying to make my own version, so when I tried this...WOW! It really is delicious. This is my new Iced Coffee drink. After drinking this a few times, I decided to add a little Nestle Chocolate Syrup (no HFCS). Yummy! Many thanks to Christy for this Easy Iced Coffee.

If you don't care for instant coffee, then don't make this.  I tried it, but it just reaffirmed that I don't like instant coffee, but that's not the fault of the recipe.  I may try this again just using a little bit of some strongly brewed coffee left over from breakfast because it certainly is easy.  A dollop of the canned whipped cream doesn't hurt either.

I like the idea of an iced coffee simplified by using instant coffee, but this recipe proves that there is no covering up the fake flavor of instant coffee! This is no match for the recipes I've tried with brewed coffee.

Love this!  I use 3 packets of splenda in place of the sugar.  I like my iced coffee sweet.  For flavored iced coffee I use 1 Splenda Flavors for Coffee (vanilla or mocha) and 2 regular splenda packets, so yummy.

I just made this, its perfect! Super easy. I thought i might have to add flavored creamer but it was great as is. I did use almond milk because thats what we have on hand and i used sugar substitute. I also used a full cup of the almond milk to make measuring easier. With the 100 degree weather today this really hit the spot.

Another idea is to brew a little extra coffee, flavor as you normally would, pour into a sealable container and refrigerate. When you want iced coffee, pour over a glass of ice and enjoy. Flavored creamers can be added for a change.

I was craving Wawa's Iced Coffee so I got online to see if there were any creative people out there who had tried to figure out the recipe yet.  I stumbled across this recipe and this recipe is not that sweet and does not really compare to Wawa so I started to play around with the ingredients and got it pretty darn close!!! Delicious! I substituted half the milk for half n' half and put 3 tsp of sugar instead of 1 tsp....you could even add more.  The trick is making sure you add the sugar to the warm water so that it disolves.  It so yummy this way I had to share!  Enjoy!

i made this using normal coffee and less sugar. it took like one shake to be foamy! i poured it over a glass of ice, added a splash of my favorite creamer, and finished off with milk. it was fantastic! i will definitely be making this again! thanks for the inspiring recipe!

I've been drinking these every morning for the past several months so figured it was time to review! These are delicious and leave iced coffees that you would buy anywhere else in the dust. Everyone I make these for loves them, and so much cheaper and better than stopping somewhere for a drink! I do add a splash of creamer on top, usually hazlenut or coconut creme, this is key for me...also use good instant coffee, I've tried many and taster's choice (red container) is what I've prefered above others. Enjoy!!!

Thank you  Christy!  So good...  I always have Vietnamese coffee over ice and stir, but with your recipie, I blended all together, and WOW!  I even went to the store after, to buy straws , so I could drink it like Timmy's :)    ...I can have this every single solitary day, whenever I want, as much as I want!   :) Those who want to tweak, great, just upping Christys' recipie, and we'll all have more kinds to try, based on this original.  Yes?  Yes!

I really enjoy making this. I'm on a very strict budget and this really hits the spot whenever I crave the high-end coffees I used to enjoy. I like to add a couple teaspoons of chocolate syrup. I can't wait to try this in the blender next time for a "frappuccino" type drink.

i used skim milk which I think was a bit thin.  If I use that again, i'd add a bit of cream or half and half.  I also want to try with a bit of vanilla flavouring next time but it was also pretty good as is.

Super fast and easy. Much better than McDonalds iced coffee. I used 2 packets of diet sugar because it dissolves faster and less calories.

I don't drink coffee but we made it with Pero (it's made from malted barley- you can find it by the tea and coffee and coffee substitutes at your local grocery store)- We added a couple of tablespoons of whipped cream and I thought it was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I've been drinking an iced coffee very similar to this for years. I make mine in a 32 oz. bottle and I dont use the warm water.   4 t instant coffee of your choice 4 packets of sweet and low 1/4 t vanilla flavoring Powdered creamer to taste/ I use 3 T 3 c water  3/4 c milk 2 T Beniful fiber ice cubes to fill the bottle.  Shake it until the powders dissolve. I love this drink and it lasts me all day, sometimes 2 if I keep it in the fridge. It would probably dissolve quicker if I used warm water but I am all for eliminating unneccessary steps.

This is very easy to do (great on a busy morning when you're trying to get out the door!) and there's no blender clean-up. This is a good-tasting cold coffee drink. I tried it in hopes that I could cut down on trips to cofeehouses. It is very good. I use Splenda instead of sugar. That's another great thing about this recipe - you can adjust it to your own tastes. You can use more coffee, a sugar substitute, etc. Thanks so much!!

really good. I used splenda and fat free milk. Next time I think i'll use a little less coffee, but all in all a great drink. Update. almost a year later i still make this ALOT. Especially as a treat for my bf.  I use 5 oz of milk and 1 oz of liquid creamer. Its fantastic, Whether you use regular, sugar free or fat free. I normally make it with French Vanilla or hazelnut. I've tried it with vanilla caramel which is stronger so use only 1/2 an ounce.

Easy recipe.  I prefer to add about 6 ice cubes (no warm water) and put everything in the blender for more of a Frap.  Both ways are delicious!

If you're expecting this to taste exactly like Starbucks or anything you buy at a coffee shop, you will probably be disappointed.  I'm sorry, but I just don't agree with most of the people saying it tastes just like the real thing.  HOWEVER, that being said, I think it's a *really* good starter recipe to tweak to your liking so I give it four stars.  Also, it's not like it has so many ingredients that you feel like you're wasting a lot of money if you decide you don't like it.  It's also extremely easy to make...so you should at least give it a try if you like coffee.  Also, when I get a "need" for coffee, I usually make this at home (with my tweaks) and this takes care of it so I must admit that it has saved me some money...and that's always a good thing.  =) =)

This stuff is the bomb!  I love ice coffee drinks, but you never know what is in them when you get them from stores.  This is coffee, sugar and milk.  I used nutra sweet and soy milk and a little shot of my vanilla coffee mate (for the vanilla flavor I love) and it worked great!  Thanks!

I liked this OK with coffee but I LOVE it with instant Caffe D'Vita Mocha Cappucucino. Just what I was looking for- too hot to drink brewed coffee right now. I doubled the recipe, poured over tall 16 oz glass of ice, added milk to top. fabulous! Thanks!

This was refreshing and so much cheaper than Starbucks. The coffee was JUST this side of being too strong, but it could have been because I used Splenda in place of the sugar and got a different amount of sweetness. Made with lite soymilk to cut down on the calories further, and it was a nice, fast drink.

This iced coffee was very good, but when I used hazelnut instant coffee, it was even better; however, when I added Frangelico, this  iced coffee was fantastic!

Fantastic! I have long been looking for a good iced coffee recipe. (Okay, so I'm a little picky) But, so excited I have finally found it!!! I did change the instant coffee to 1 1/2 tsp instant espresso and it tastes exactly like iced coffees I used to get at a local coffee bar. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!

It is Awesome!  It took 2 tries to get the recipe really tasty and low cal but this is what I did.  3tsp instant coffee, 3TBS warm water, 1 packet stevia, and 1/2tsp unsweetened cocoa powder in a 1 pt mason jar and shook.  Added 1 cup skim milk, splash vanilla, and splash coffee creamer (I had Girl Scout Cookie Thin Mint flavor), filled jar to top with ice, closed lid and shook again.  More delicious than the ID brand of mocha coffee at the store - and way lower in calories and cheaper. My new favorite drink!

Way better than store bought and you can use decaf, evap milk, many different substitutions. I found it needed double sugar, but I like my coffee sweet!

This a great, simple recipe.  I tend to use a bit more water and coffee than what the recipe calls for and put in a vanilla sugar syrup instead of granulated white sugar.  This is a wonderful base recipe to get yourself started on making iced coffee at home!

Tastes great, but I added 2 more tsp of sugar to satisfy my sweet tooth. I just stirred it instead of shaking. Will be making coffee this way every time.

this coffee was surprisingly yummy-I expected it to be gross but it was really good!  I added some coffee creamer and used coffee ice cubes instead of ordinary ones for a stronger taste

Wow!! Why waste money purchasing the iced coffee from the stores when this tastes better!!!  You can tweak the recipe to suite your taste- I added a little more sugar than it calls for. I used Folgers, classic roast, instant coffee.  I've got several people hooked on this recipe now!

I put everything (except I omitted the sugar all together) in my BlenderBottle, shook it a few times, took out the mixer ball, added ice and was good to go!  I used on of the Starbucks instant coffee packets instead of measuring out granules.  I think it worked perfectly, but I like really, really strong coffee.

Great recipe. Easy to adjust for personal preference. Make sure you use a "good" instant coffee or it will taste rubbish. I like about 3 tsp instant coffee, no sugar, 2% milk, plus a touch of flavored creamer. Great to calm that afternoon craving without busting out the coffee pot or going through a drive through.

This was amazing!! I prepared as is except I added about 2 tablespoons of caramel macchiato creamer. Voila! Super easy and quick version of a vanilla caramel iced latte from Starbucks.  Next time I'm going to add some whipped cream and a drizzle of caramel and chocolate syrup...:)

This is way better than I thought it would be for as simple as it is to make!  I needed a bit more sugar for my tastes, probably used about a Tablespoon.  I didn't measure the milk the second time, I just poured into my favorite drinking glass. : )
Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!!!!!!! I used low fat chocolate milk and it was wonderful. This is now my mid-afternoon drink for a sweet pick-me-up.

I am not the coffee drinker in my house, but my husband frequents the coffee stand almost daily.  This is the first time I have made anything even close to the drink that he usually orders.  He loved it.  Thank you!!!!

I crushed my ice, then blended with an immersion blender to froth and topped with whipped cream. I felt it needed a bit more sweet to it and more coffee flavor so maybe I used too much ice. Great recipe to start, I just need to play with the ice amount and flavoring. (Maybe chocolate/ caramel too??)

I loved this recipe!  I used vanilla flavored instant coffee & added a dash of vanilla extract to it.  I also along with the milk added a little bit of flavored creamer.  Very good!

This turned out great - I added skim milk and sugar free Torani Vanilla syrup (the kind you find at the coffee houses) - was a bit sweet after adding the syrup next time I wont add the first teaspoon of sugar- thanks for the recipe Christy!

I love this recipe. I did modify it by adding a packet of splenda instead of the sugar. Also, I made some up ahead of time so I can take it to work with me. I put 1/3 cup of powdered milk in my cup to go and when I am ready for the coffee drink I just pour some of the coffee mix in cup and add water and shake it up w/ice. Its wonderful

It's absolutely wonderful:) I have found that to keep from dirtying 2 containers, it is easier to just combine the coffee, sugar, and warm water in the glass that you plan to drink out of. You can swirl it around in the bottom and get the same effect since it isn't enough swirl over the sides, plus you don't lose any flavor on the other container. Enjoy:)

So easy!!!  I've been making a glass of this every morning since I found this recipe last week.  (I add a squirt of chocolate sauce in mine to make it mocha.)  Faster than brewing a pot of coffee and perfect for hot summer days.

My house is in love with this recipe. It's so easy and so simple to add my own variations. I added 2 tbsp of my favorite creamer for the flavor I wanted. I adjusted the ingredients to more or less so that I could make it as strong or as weak as everyone liked. Sure beats $2 at the convenience store. I have a feeling I will need to keep more ice in my freezer from now on!

Way easier than brewing coffee, cooling down, etc.  This is easy and delicious.  Skip the Coffee Shop and make this inexpensive version, you won't be disappointed.

VERY GOOD!!! But if you are going to put powder creamer be sure to put it in when the coffee is still warm or else it just clumps at the top. Other than that this is a great recipe!! :)

Yum! I used the bags that make one cup of coffee and instead of milk added Irish cream and a dash of Kahlua to it. Super yummy drink for a hot night.

I never knew how easy iced coffee was... I definitely never would have an iced coffee at McDonald's if I knew I could make my own. Super easy and delicious. You can add a lil Hershey's syrup if you want it sweeter.

I loved how this was so super simple! I don't drink regular coffee so I don't even own a coffee maker and it's such a hassle to dig out and dirty the blender for one drink. The only thing I did different was added chocolate syrup to the coffee mixture before pouring it into the glass. This is definitely my new favorite drink!! Thank you so much.

Don't drink coffee so rating this based on my husband & son's review :)  THey absolutely LOVE this recipe and says better than McDonald ice coffee. My 17 year old son always asked me to make for him so I just showed him how to make. Daily staple around here lately! Thank you for saving me so much $$ with this recipe!!

Since I discovered this recipe last July, I've made it many times -- and it's ALWAYS so good!  I often add chocolate syrup or other flavorings to change it.  I love being able to have this at home w/o getting dressed & driving a ways to get it; not to mention saving $3-4.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Awesome recipe! If you substitute chocolate milk for the regular milk, it turns this drink into a rich Mocha Iced Coffee. DELICIOUS!!!

Really good! For some reason it never occurred to me to look for a drink recipe on here - but I was jonesing an iced coffee and didn't feel like going to get one, so this was my first stop. I followed the recipe except that I added a tsp of unsweetened cocoa (for an iced mocha) and used skim milk. I'll never buy an iced coffee again. Thanks Christy!

What an easier way of making iced coffee! This is great because it dissolves the sugar unlike when you get it at coffee shops! (while also paying an arm and a leg.)  We do like ours a bit sweeter though, very easy to adjust to taste. Thanks for this recipe!

Awesome. I don't usually drink instant coffee but will start keeping it on hand just for this. The only change I would make is a personal preference...I like my iced coffee a little sweeter so maybe next time will add a little more sugar or some creamer. Thanks for the great recipe!

Thank you thank you THANK YOU!!! I've been wanting to try to make my own iced coffee for months now but never knew where to start. Your recipe gave me the measurements and confidence I needed! I used a packet of splenda instead of the sugar and added some french vanilla coffee mate. Yum!

Great, made my first one this morning, may end up tweaking by adding a little more sugar or some hazelnut flavoring...so easy though! McDonalds may suffer a bit since I won't be driving through every morning due to my iced coffee addiction now!

Easy and good tasting.  I added some Ovaltine to mine and it was even better!  It's so easy and saves you from having to drive somewhere to get your iced coffee.  Who knew instant coffee could taste so good.

This is such a simple and tasty recipe. You can make it so many different ways such as using decaf instant coffee, sweetener in place of sugar,add a tablespoon of chocolate syrup for iced mocha or whatever you'd like. I haven't tried adding caramel to it yet but I will. Great recipe!

Great, quick, simple.  I am lactose intolerant and can use my own lactose free milk and save so much $$ compared to getting a soymilk drink at Starbucks!!  A drizzle of chocolate milk syrup adds a nice flavor.

Love it!  I added 1/2 tsp. more sugar and 1/4 tsp. imitation vanilla.  This is much cheaper than the expensive drinks sold at fancy coffee stores and tastes just as good!  I will be using this recipe frequently if not daily.. thank you so much Christy.

This recipe is fantastic.  So fast, so easy, but most importantly, so delicious!  I used a little more sugar (I like my coffee sweet) and half fat free half and half and half milk.  So yummy!  It was frothy and creamy and so pretty in the glass, too.  I highly recommend this recipe!

OMG!! LOVE IT!!! I LOVE coffee, but can't drink it due to my religion. So to avoid the temptation I can now make this but with Postum instead of with coffee... just tried it, and it's perfect! Delicious taste... everything I loved about the iced lattes and coffees from Starbucks... my hubby is grateful as well... will save almost $4 a day now that I can make it at home! THANK YOU FOR SHARING!!!

This is a very good basic recipe.  I like mine a little sweeter so I added a little more sugar.  Or you could use Splenda to make it more calorie friendly.  But otherwise, it is very good.  And super easy!!  You could also add some flavored syrup.  And it's easy on the pocketbook.  Thanks Christy.

This tasted to me just like the iced coffee I get at McDonalds. I didn't have any instant coffee, so I brewed some strong coffee and poured about a fourth of a cup in a tall (about 16 oz) cup. I added a little less than a tablespoon of sugar,and 2 tablespoons of coffee mate vanilla caramel creamer and stirred until disolved. I then added milk, stirred and added a few ice cubes. My daughter had hers with whipped cream on top. I will probably drizzle caramel syrup on top of the whipped cream next time. Very, very good for a hot day.

Delicious, and great way to save money! For the instant coffee, I used instant espresso powder.  I like a stronger coffee taste. I also use flavored Coffeemate creamers to change it up a bit.

I put the coffe granuals and sugar in a cup, added hot water and waited till it disolved. Then i poued that into a blender, added about 6 ice cubes, some skim milk and about 1 tbsp. of flavored coffee creamer and blended it together - DELICIOUS and REFRESHING!!!

I usually use brewed coffee but I forgot to brew last night so I tried this instant coffee.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I like my iced coffee a little sweet so I added a little bit of hazelnut flavored creamer.  Delicious!

Really yummy with just a few personal adjustments. I found the original too bitter for my taste so i added one more tsp sugar and a splash of vanilla extract. I also put 3 ice cubes instead of water and 'ice crushed' it all in the blender. I think I just took a few bucks away from Mr. Horton

Just tried this today (after the Chancery's .99 special iced coffee last night). I used a packet of Splenda, and for chocolate flavor, added 1-2 tsp of Ovaltine powder! Great taste, and a little boost before my run tonight!

This is a really inexpensive and quick way to enjoy iced coffee!  In the past I have brewed coffee and had to wait until it chilled.  I didn't imagine instant coffee would work so well.  I added some caramel syrup!

Oh my gosh, even with all the phenomenal reviews I wasn't expecting a drink this good! Made as written, with the darkest "roast" instant coffee and Splenda, and it was like a very sweet latte. Next time for personal preference I will use about 1/2 the sugar. I can't wait to get some of those flavor syrups to customize this - thank you so much for sharing this awesome drink!

Oh My Goodness!  Even after reading all of the rave reviews, I still was not expecting this iced coffee to taste THIS good!  It is fantastic!  I made it for myself and my two teenage boys, and we all agreed that it is as good as Starbucks, if not better!  We added a couple tablespoons of vanilla creamer to give it just a bit more flavor and sweetness.  I know we will be making this yummy drink all summer long!

This is really very good! I like a more subtle coffee flavor, so I used less coffee granules than the recipe called for. I also added a packet of cocoa mix for a little chocolate zing. Instead of regular milk, I used vanilla flavored soymilk and a teaspoon of vanilla extract for another dimension of flavor. I won't have to go to Starbucks anymore for gourmet style coffee!

Very Good! I used splenda, makes it a nice low-cal treat.  Reminds me of Starbucks Doubleshots, (I added a little more coffee than called for), which you can't find anymore.

This was very good after I added 1 splenda packet to my glass...with just the little bit of sugar, it wasn't sweet enough.  I tripled the recipe and it looks like it is going to make 3 servings: I put 1/3 of the mixture into a small glass filled with ice and added 1/2 cup of milk plus 1 splenda packet.  Delicious.  It's going to make a nice drink to sit out on my balcony and enjoy!

I gave this recipe four stars because it was a super platform! I used reviewer dshea4's changes and then tweaked it some more on my own. I followed dshea4's but varied by using Swiss Mocha International Coffee from General Foods. I don't like it as a hot drink so this was perfect!! Then I used chocolate flavored powdered coffee creamer. Drizzled the top with whip cream - yum!!! It was *almost* as good as something at Starbucks. Even my husband, who poo poo's the idea of frozen cappuccinos or iced coffee drinks, LOVED it!!! Awesome!!

When I made it just now, I used to teaspoons of sugar (because I like sweet coffee) and I had to add a little extra water because my mix wasn't dissolving well. But once I got it done, I was so surprised. This is delicious! And I've had a lot of iced coffees from working at four different Tim Hortons over the course of nearly 5 years. This is honestly better than the last few iced coffees I've had from there.

This is pretty good! I needed a few pinches more of sugar for my preference, and I did leave out the ice. I’ll use ice if I ever get around to making coffee ice cubes:)

Was really good and easy! We used Nescafe classico coffee.  I mix up a bunch of this (without the milk) then store in a sealed jar in fridge for easy preparation in the morning.

Really good! Better than some coffee shops for sure. I used unsweetened almond milk, made a nice froth. Definitely making again with flavored syrup. I will be making myself this at work, there are no nearby good coffee shops, so happy to have found this recipe for that reason!

I added more milk (maybe 10 oz instead of 6 oz)  and a shot of Bailey's Irish Cream and it was great!

This recipe is definitely not one of the best. First of all, it has little flavor. I had to double the coffee and sugar amount to get it somewhat flavorful. The one thing I liked about it, was that it only took 5 minutes to make. All in all, I would not make this again.

This was delicious!! It definitely lived up to it's description. Totally going to do this again! However next time i will need to add hotter water as the coffee granules did not dissolve. But it did not stop it from being delicious.

I love this site but I never felt the need to make an account until I found THIS recipe. I seriously can't believe this worked so well. I've tried making ice coffee using many different methods. And while they were all real good, some better than others, this method was significantly faster and had a stronger flavor. Everything I've tried took waiting hours to even waiting overnight. This method took less than a few minutes.

I mostly eyeballed the actual recipe to suit my taste but I did use a cleaned peanut butter jar to shake it. I thought I'd make two batches but it turns out one jar was more than enough for me. 10/10, will make again.

I make ice cubes out of leftover coffee and use for iced coffee recipes.  The drink does not get watered down as the ice melts.
I added a couple of tablespoons of flavored creamer with the milk and ended up with a more silky creamy iced latte.

Very good and simple recipe. I made this a few times already, so I decided to blend some milk/almond milk, ice, and a couple of tablespoons of pure pumpkin then added the coffee mixture to it. Delicious. I'll definitely will be using this recipe over and over.

I loved the recipe as it really was quick an easy. I made it in my nutribullet, blended it all together (including ice). You might want to add a dollop of cream just to make it slightly sweeter.

I added a bit more sugar,and I used plain almond milk instead of the milk, but other than that, it was very good, and I'm not a cold coffee drinker. My husband like iced coffee, so I am interested to see what he thinks of it. Thanks for Sharing your recipe!

I have had this every day instead of the traditional drip coffee for months now. I love it. All I do is put 2 teaspoons of Nescafe, 2 teaspoons of sugar, and I turn on the tap to hot and just eye the water--it's probably like 1/4 of a cup, or less. Then fill the cup with ice and pour milk over it. Very basic but very good if you're a coffee fan!

I have made variations of this recipe for 40+ years. As a big coffee drinker, hot or cold I usually had coffee left in the pot. So I just pour this into ice trays & freeze. It won't dilute the coffee like regular ice. I usually add a splash of Half & Half if I have any. Much richer taste.

I used 3 tsp. of Nescafe instant coffee and 3 tsp. of xylitol for sweetener instead.  mixed it up with the warm water and poured over a tall glass of ice with milk.  It was delicious! Tasted almost like an iced caramel latte.  Two thumbs up!

I thought this recipe was good. The only reason that this isnt a 5 star rating is because its hard to get the sugar milk and coffee mixed up good enough. Not amazing but good

Did exactly as the recipe said - the turnout was extremely frothy and it was a bit difficult to mix the milk. My friend thought it tasted good but I ended up not finishing my glass. I would recommend adding more sugar, and make sure you don't pick just any instant coffee. Also, you might wanna relax on the shaking.

What a great tasty recipe. I am hooked on the Sheetz ice mocha but hate paying every morning and this is just as good! I did add tablespoon of sugar free chocolate. Also, I used 2 teaspoons of strong brewed coffee and it worked great!

I don't drink dairy milk so I substituted vanilla almond milk and added a squirt of coffee syrup. A quick way to have fast iced coffee at home and tastes pretty good.

This was delicious!  I changed the coffee to water ratio to make it stronger, omitted sugar, and topped it with whipped cream.  This is a great instant iced coffee recipe!  Thank you.

I think some of the bad reviews come from people who use bad instant coffee. I think Nescafe Tasters Choice - French Roast is the best instant coffee on earth....or at least that I've tried. I used 2 teaspoons of turbinado sugar but everything else was just as the recipe says. It's a great recipe!

this definitely was tasty. I used Starbucks Via instant vanilla coffee.  I doubled the coffee and sugar, used crushed ice, used about 9-10 oz milk and then added a tiny splash of caramel creamer I had. SO yummy.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I live in Texas, and in the summer the mornings are too hot to want coffee, so this is perfect!  I used flavored instant coffee, and substituted the sugar for instant creamer... it was a great modification!  I also tried soy milk, which was very tasty!

It tastes kind of weird at first, which is why you just add the stuff you like, such as sugar, or half and half. I added Splenda sweetener and a teeny bit of half and half and it made it DELICIOUS.

I made this, this morning.  This is so good. Thought I would try it because my son's girlfriend loves Iced Coffee.  I did put it all in a blender after I did the initial first step.  I also added 1 tsp. of real vanilla extract and a splash of half and half...just because I used skim milk.  Like I said....mmmmmm good.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I've made something similar to this before, but I think the shaking it until foamy is the real trick.  I used cold almond milk and it was very yummy!

This is DE-LISH!!!  It was ever-so-slightly not sweet enough for me so this is the ONLY change I made:  Instead of warming 3 Tbsp of water, I warmed 3 Tbsp of Carnation Fat-Free French Vanilla creamer.  I still topped off with milk.  MMM-MMM good!

Tried this (along with others on this site) and turned out great! All my family loves Iced Coffee. This is the easiest recipe of the ones I have done; lots of room to make unique. I have passed this (and others) to all my friends and family!

Don't have any jars around so I just put coffee/sugar/water in a cup and stirred vigorously, then added milk + ice. Didn't bother measuring just added to taste :) Very easy, thanks!

So simple but still yummy!  I have the worst sweet tooth so I added a tablespoon of condensed milk as well.  Next time I will add only 1.5 teaspoons of instant coffee & I think it will be perfect!

A delish treat on a nice summer's day!  I followed the advice of some reviewers and blended it with the ice and added a touch of vanilla creamer.  I did have to add a little more coffee/water, however, as the creamer diluted the coffee flavor a bit.  Next time I'll just add some creamer in place of some of the milk.  I think it would be equally as good over ice, as well.  EDIT:  A friend also said she makes this as it, but adds chocolate.  Mmmm.

That's awesome and so easy!!  I doubled the sugar because I like things a little sweeter.  I also added a little chocolate sauce!  I'll be making that more often!  I usually go to Tim Horton's for my Iced Cap but I can do this at home and save a bundle! Thank you!!!

This tastes amazing, I blended it with ice and chocolate syrup though as I like the texture of Tim Horton's Iced Capps and it wasn't sweet enough for me at first.  But overall a great idea/recipe!

This was ok. It was more of a flavored milk than an iced coffee. I guess I just like my coffee drinks fairly strong and sweet. But this is good for a cool milkshake tasting drink!

I liked this, and better than going to Starbucks, since I live in the country. I used French Vanilla coffee creamer, maybe 1/4 cup and a little more sugar. Very refreshing!!

Play around with it, you'll like it. I've used kahlua, coconut creamer, chocolate soy milk, etc to try different flavors. No more Starbucks for me.

I had a craving today for iced coffee but it's not in the budget today so I thought I'd try this recipe. It hit the spot perfectly. Only addition I made was to add one of my little french vanilla creamer cups I usually add to my regular coffee. I've been able to now duplicate my favorite hot & cold drinks I used to get at the expensive coffee houses....all from the comfort of home/office but without the daily expense.

Of all the recipes that I use from this site, this one HAS to be my favorite! I am addicted!! I make these *sugar-free by adding a packet of Truvia to the coffee granules. I also add just a small shot of vanilla or carmel coffee creamer along with the milk, to get the same exact flavor as McD's iced coffee drinks.

Very good, however I had to add extra flavoring to make it GOOD. I added a splash of chocolate mint  and that made it. I will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted really good. I like a little more flavor in my coffee and usually use creamer so instead I used 1/2 cup cold milk and 1/4 cup coffee creamer. Excellent recipe. This will definitely be a life saver consider my coffee pot just broke.

YUMMY!!! I have become a huge fan of "foo-foo" coffee drinks.  This is sooo good.  I increased the sugar just a little because I don't like such a strong coffee flavor.  PLUS...I add a pump or so of Starbucks Hazelnut Syrup...WOW!! So good!  That you so much for sharing!

I've been making this every morning this summer.  It's so good!  I sub Splenda for the sugar, and add a little fat-free vanilla creamer for some flavor.  Yum!!

Very easy, very good.  My wallet and my waistline(skim milk) say thanks.

Edit 10/31/09 to say:  I've made this every day since I found this recipe.  My friend suggested adding a few drops of coconut extract.  I also like to add cinnamon extract.  I premix 1 part hi-test coffee, 1 part de-caf, and 1 part sweetener in a large canister.  I have saved at least $50/month by making my own and countless calories by using skim milk.  This is a winner on every level.

not impressed. This coffee had too much of a bitter taste in my opinion. But, I like my coffee a bit on the sweet side. I think I will just stick to making lattees the old fashioned way.

I loved this recipe. So quick and easy to make. My husband thought it was better than the coffee shop varieties. I add  different flavored creams to change up the flavor from day to day. This a keeper.

Had to add a little extra milk and sugar (splenda, actually), but it was delicious. I think I just like my coffee weak :). Will be making this again for sure, can't wait to try all the variations, and am grateful for a new way to save money!

I am a coffee junkie and would NEVER dream of purchasing instant coffee. I saw this recipe on the Recipe of the Day, and remembered that I had instant espresso for baking and thought that I would give it a try. It will definitely make this one again. If you like a more full bodied coffee, as some reviewer suggested, go with the  instant espresso. I used Ferrera instant espresso, Splenda, and soy milk and this hit the spot. This is true money saver w/endless flavor possibilities! Thank you for the recipe it is yummy. Okay, I am hooked. Went and picked up some VIA packets (one could also get the Taster's Choice version) they measure out perfectly to this recipe. Added 2TBSP. of International Coffee "Vanilla Latte" flavor creamer and added soy milk to measure 6ozs. This was great!!!

Very excellent basic recipe. Iced Coffee is my vice this summer and now I don't have to spend a ton of money on it! I also added lots more sugar, honestly needs around 3 tbsp instead of 3 tsp but it's all in personal taste. I also added 3 individual packets of coffee mate coffee creamers to it then the rest of skim milk, I will not do that again. Instead I will try vanilla flavored coffee syrup. I did add chocolate, and it's great!!

This is an excellent fast recipe when cruched for time.  I tweaked it to be less calories- used Truvia sweetener and 8 oz. of 1% milk.  Then I was able to add the more decadent ingredient.... a touch of flavored creamer - creme brulee'.  Yummy. Maybe next time to make it more special...use a little whipped topping and a drizzle of chocalate syrup on top.   Decaf is a good idea too if you need to cut back on caffeine.  And just think of all the money you can save by not going by your favorite coffee shop every day.  Sooo simple !!!

Yummy! Just whipped up a decaf version of this for me and hubby. Double the recipe provided too much for both of us in big tall glasses so could really be for three, even four people. Did blend the ice and used one-quarter amount vanilla soymilk for a tad extra flavor. Would go all soy, add chocolate sauce or cocoa powder, maybe vanilla/almond essence shots or bit of alcohol to kick it up a bit :) Very easy, versatile and pretty too, tons of foam :) Thanks! NEW NOTE: Just made this for the second time. Y'all be careful what you use to mix up the warm water and coffee. Don't boil the water - the lid's exploded off of my shaking device twice now I guess because the water's too hot.

I would say it is okay.  It is definitely an easy way to make iced coffee, but I wouldn't say it was the best or as good as going to the coffee shop.  Next time I will try flavored coffee creamer.

Easy, but not all that tasty.  Will suffice if youre feeling lazy and you need a caffeine fix and its hot outside, but it doesnt come close to the real thing.

I found this to be WAYYYY too strong, even after I put it in a tall glass with tons of ice and milk AND adding a healthy portion of chocolate syrup (and whipped cream, of course).  I think I'll make it with one teaspoon - or even half of a teaspoon - next time. It is handy to have a quick iced coffee recipe that doesn't require a blender.  Thanks!

I'm not very picky when it comes to coffee, but this was terrible. If you don't like instant coffee, then you definitely won't like this drink. I tried the recipe as-written, and didn't like it, so I added a tablespoon of vanilla syrup--still wasn't very good.

This was a great drink and SO easy! I mixed the instant coffee, sugar (I like it sweeter, so I used extra) and the water in an empty water bottle. And I had some instant coffee single serve packets that were the perfect amount! Very foamy too, yum!

Overall this is a great base, but if you're looking for varying flavor...add a savory creamer with your favorite taste or even a teaspoon of hot cocoa mix.

There's no excuse to pay $$$ to buy iced cappuccino anymore! I use a simple one cup method where I place the coffee and sugar free coffee flavoring in the glass first and swirl around to dissolve and then add milk. No water or additional sugar is needed. A squirt of chocolate syrup can add a the right touch if you are looking for something more.

this was so easy to make!  The only thing I would change is use a little less instant coffee.  Otherwise- it is really good!!

This recipe satisfied my craving for caffeine and something cool. It was refreshing. The only thing that I didn't like was that there was a bit too much coffee in it. I would cut down on the instant coffee by about half a teaspoon.

Very good! For my own personal taste I added 3/4 teaspoon of cocoa powder and an extra teaspoon of sugar before shaking...tasted just like a frappuccino! I found it too bitter without the extra sugar, however that is just a matter of opinion. Definitely a keeper.

This is delicious.  It tastes as good as Starbucks iced coffee. My twelve year old daughter makes it for us on hot days. She says it's a great recipe and gives it 5 stars.

This is an easy recipe for sure; my son and husband liked it. I was not so keen, but then again I am not a fan of cold coffee. They gave it the rating. I did add more sugar as others suggested, and put it in the fridge to cool it down more.

i sprinkled some cinnamon ( about 1/8tsp) before adding the ice cubes, and stirred. adds a subtle cinnamony flavor, v. delicious.
