This is a truly lovely and different dish, that I will definitely make again. The rosewater, which I found in a middle eastern grocery store, was a little frightening at first, because it smelled like a bottle of perfume! However, when added to the dish, it became much more subtle and really made the dish special. The only thing  I did differently was to toast the almonds. Thanks!

Followed the recipe except for using some vegetable broth for part of the water and omitting the rose water, since I could not find it.  I wouldn't say that this is my favorite pilaf, but it does have good eye appeal, and is flavorful.  Next time, I think I will add some cardamon as suggested by the recipe writer, and rose water, if I ever can find it.

I thought this was really good. I served with the Persian beef kebabs and it was a perfect match.  I did add the cardamon.  Husband said it's a keeper and my picky 6 year old ate it up.

Good, except the rose water was overpowering. If I make it again, I will try with just a teaspoon.

Very flavorful. I added cinnamon and nutmeg per other suggestions. In place of rose water you can substitute vanilla extract. Im sure its not  as good  but great for a savory dish. Add more nuts for vegan entree

This was so good.  Different, impressive, beautiful .  I'd consider using golden raisins instead of chopping apricots.  Rose water was $4 at the Middle Eastern store.  It added a wonderful nuance but don't add more than recommended.  Wouldn't be as good without it and don't even try it if you don't have saffron.

I made this as directed and included cinnamon and cardamon.  It was lovely!  It's a very special delicious "gentle and romantic" dish with sophisticated presence  despite its subtle flavoring.  I kept imagining this being perfect for a summer evening al fresco meal perhaps paired with a light flaky fish dish.  It begs for strawberries and cream for dessert.

I followed the recipe except that I did toast the almonds. The dish was fantastic! The rose water adds a floral flavor that complements the saffron. Definitely will make again.
