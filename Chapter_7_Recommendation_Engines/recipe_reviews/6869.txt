These are amazing muffins.  I made them using half the oil & half applesauce. 
I tried all applesauce but they didn't cook right.  Half and half is perfect

These turned out perfectly for me.  I mixed all the wet ingredients first, and then folded in the dry ingredients, making sure not to mix too much.  The batter should be very very lumpy!!!  (I was tempted to mix more, but I didn't, so it turned out really well with a muffin rather than cake consistency.)

The flavor of these muffins was fabulous(!) but I believe you must be very, very careful not to mix and/or bake them too much--the texture on mine was very heavy and the bottoms almost rubbery.  I will make them again because of the flavor...but try to improve on the texture.  I gave this five stars because I don't think it's the recipe with the problem--it's me!

I love poppy seed muffins and this recipe was no exception. Thanks to the previous reviewers, I decreased sugar to about 1 3/4 cup. They were still VERY sweet; next time I'll cut it back to 1 1/2 cups. I was out of orange juice, and used apple juice instead and didn't notice a difference from usual. My kids LOVED these. For me, the batch yielded 24 'regular' sized muffins and they baked for 17 minutes a batch. Like others have said, the glaze truly is 'the icing on the cake.' The flavor is soooo good!

HINTS INCLUDED FOR POPPY SEEDS AND MUFFIN PAPERS.  This is the first muffin recipe that has EVER given me 'mounded', cute looking muffins!  Thank you, Liz R, for sharing!   The taste and texture are amazing.  This recipe is the most like Costco's muffins that I've found. 

I, too, did what another reviewer did.  Mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately, then folded the dry into the wet.  This made 24 of the medium sized muffins (aka 2" x 1 1/4").  I found no need for the glaze, though next time I will put more poppy seeds into the mix.

If you have trouble with those nasty store bought muffin papers that are so splayed out that they won't stay in the muffin tins, Reynolds has boxes of 500 (in several sizes) for around $4 at the store known by different names in different areas:  Cash and Carry, United Grocer's or Smart and Final.  Though not a retailer, if you spend cash you can generally purchase what you need there, no business license required.

Also, poppy seeds have enough oil that they go rancid quickly if on the store shelf or home shelf too long.  Do the 'sniff' test before baking with them.  They should smell earthy, but not 'icky'.  If there is a smell that is not good, it won't bake out but will make your food taste nasty.  Store fresh seeds in one zip freezer bag nested into a 2nd bag and freeze between uses.

I read these reviews carefully before I began and altered the recipe accordingly. They weren't too sweet or too oily. They turned out perfect! Here's what I did: I used 3 eggs, 1/8 C. Vegetable Oil, 1 C. Apple Sauce, 1 1/2 C. Milk, 1 1/2 Tsp. Vanilla Extract, 1 1/2 Tsp. Almond Extract, 1 1/2 C. White Sugar, 1 1/2 Tsp. Salt, 1 1/2 Tsp. Baking Powder, 1 1/2 Tbsp. Poppy Seeds, 3 C. All-Purpose Flour. I mixed the glaze and had it on the stove before I made the Muffins. I mixed together eggs, apple sauce, vegetable oil, milk, vanilla, and almond. In separate bowl, I mixed together sugar, salt, baking powder, poppy seeds, and flour. Fold wet ingredients into dry. Don't mix too much. Batter should be lumpy. Grease pan thoroughly (no paper). Fill almost full.

In a Regular Cupcake Pan: Bake at 350 F for 30-35 min. or until toothpick comes out clean. (Best indicator is when the tops finally look dry) - Makes 14-16

Remove muffins as soon as you can from pans while still warm/hot and dunk tops into glaze. Turn right side up and cool on a cookie rack.

These are oily, greasy, dense almond poppyseed cakes.  They do not resemble muffins at all.  There is way too much oil.  They were sunken in the middle instead of rounded out.  I make muffins every week and was looking forward to trying this recipe but I can say that I will never make these again.

I used egg substitute and the recipe still turned out fabulously.  I had to be careful not to cook them for too long, however.  Don't wait until they look golden brown or they will have a more dense and rubbery texture.

Delicious!  Very moist and a nice flavor.  It made lots of muffins.  I added some lemon extract and that added a lot of flavor.

The glaze is the key to this recipe.  If you make the muffin without the glaze, it's not particularly amazing.  I made them with the glaze for a brunch with friends and they were gone immediately.

I have been searching for a poppyseed muffin recipe since my favorite bakery closed!  I love them, and so does everyone else.  The recipe makes about 20 regular muffins and a small loaf!  They are better the second day, after the glaze soaks in, mmm.  Third day?  There wasn't a third day for these muffins!  The kids love to make homemade desserts-this recipe is on their list of favorites!

These are way too sweet, and I didn't even make the icing. I would prefer a muffin that actually browned on the top instead of this pale yellow color. Just really didn't like the taste of these. I will keep looking for a better recipe. If you are going to make these I recommend making them like regular muffins; combine the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients separately and then combine them while mixing for as short a time as possible. I don't like the way the instructions are written. Also definitely fill the muffin cups all the way up or else your muffins will be flat topped instead of domed.

Like someone else said, these are super heavy! And the flavor is not very good. The almond taste is overpowering. I was super disappointed with these!

These are wonderful muffins. I cooked the glaze first and got it cooling before I prepared and baked the muffins. The glaze thickens up as it cools, which helps it adhere to the muffins better. I didn't make any changes and I was very pleased with the results. Sure, they are a bit greasy right after taking them out of the oven, but after they have cooled, they aren't too oily at all. The only thing I would recommend is not using paper muffin liners. They tend to stick to the glaze. Just grease the muffin tins.

very good! I used 1/8 cup lemon juice and 1/8 cup orange juice for glaze to give it more of a tart taste, I also put lemon and organge zest in both batter and glaze.

Not sure what I really think of theses.... Part of the problem is that I over mixed (not sure HOW since I didn't mix very much what whatever) The other problem is that they just don't look done. Oh sure they have the right texture but the tops are SO not brown. If I let them stay in for longer they would have been dry. Did the toothpick test. OTHER problem is that they were greasy. Never had a problem with that before. I think it was probably the HUGE amount of oil in the recipe. Not trying this one again. Will try to make the glaze (hoping to give them color) but not using this again.

UPDATE: Against MY judgement I'm giving it an extra star. I liked the recipes from my three books but my boyfriend really prefers this one. He liked them BECAUSE they weren't brown. I still hate the greasiness so I'm going to try making him poppyseed cupcakes because they don't have a crust and are moist without being greasy :)

I love this recipe! I made them lemony--I doubled the recipe and added the rind of 2 lemons, and used lemon extract where it says to use almond. I also used fresh lemon juice instead of orange for the glze. These made great Welcome muffins for new neighbors!

These were delicious!! Texture was amazing! I used 1 and 1/2 cups sugar and they were still very sweet. But wonderful! I didn't make the glaze because I though they were sweet enough. I also topped them with sliced almonds which made them even better.

Oh these are VERY nice muffins and cake.  The recipe makes WAY more than it tells you it does, you can easily cut it in half.  However, I found that the muffins were done well before the tops were browned, so I took them out, disregarding the instructions to wait.  They were so fluffy and moist, but yes- they were done.  You do not have to wait for them to brown on top, just do a toothpick test.  They are on the sweet side, especially when they're fully cooled, but that's okay with me.  I didn't even bother with the glaze.  Maybe next time I'll use half the sugar and do the glaze.  As for mixing, I had no problems mixing it for quite some time.  Not a single one.  Of course I was mixing by hand, not with an electric beater, which I recommend.  That way you'll *want* to stop as soon as it's done.

This recipe was FAR to sweet. I did notice that other cooks said that they changed the sugar amount, but I wanted to make them as is to see what I thought. They formed a crystallized "crust" on the outside. They had good flavor, but I definitely want to play with the sugar to get a lesser amount.

These are wonderful muffins!  I did change the recipe though, just to use up what we had in the house, but I omitted the almonds and almond extract, and instead grated 4 very small apples into the batter.  The muffins were moist and tender, sweet and delicious!  I am really looking forward to making them again, the way the recipe reads!  Really good!

This recipe made 20 muffins, not 12.  I decreased the sugar & the oil based on other reviews. I also added 2 drops of yellow food coloring since others said the muffins were "pale". They looked great & tasted good. DEFINITELY use the paper liners for your muffin pan.  Otherwise they WILL stick, even if you grease it well.

These are really good. I could not quit eating them (until they were gone of course), neither could my husband.  :)

I love this recipe!  I added more poppy seeds- 3Tbsp. in all, and I subbed honey for the sugar which I always do.  I only used 1 3/4 Cups of honey per some reviewers suggestions.  This is a great recipe and my 12 year old son said they were better than the Beans and Brews poppy seed muffins we get down the street.

The glaze is absolutely fantastic! Love that it has almond extract. If I'm in a pinch, I will use the Krusteaz mix with this glaze.

I haven't tried this with the glaze yet because I didn't have orange juice.  The muffins alone are delicious.  I can't wait to try with the glaze.

My daughter has been begging for poppy seed muffins from the store - decided to try my own, assuming they would be a bit healthier.  I used  1 1/4 cup of sugar - still WAY too sweet.  Used half of the oil.  They still turned out heavy and pale - they didn't brown at all.

wow!! I just made these and they turned out wonderful and very tasty! The Glaze topped it all off!! I followed the directions exactly and it did not turn out oily or dense as some of the other reviewers stated. I did cut back on the surgar as  other reviewer suggested by a cup and it still came out sweet. Maybe next time Ill add only one cup of sugar instead since the glaze is already sweet. I will definitely make this again, thanks so much for sharing.

This was the first muffin recipe that attempted to prepare. I wanted a recipe that included poppy seeds in it. The main problem was when the muffins were finally baked through some still came out rubbery while others were normal. In addition, the recipe was a tad too sweet for my taste - I will omit the glaze next time around. Some of my co-workers loved them & others thought they were too sweet as well.

Absolutely delicious, this is definitely a keeper.  I make a lot of muffins and these did not disappoint.  I used butter instead of oil which might have made a difference, but I think they are probably just as good with oil.  If they don't turn out perfectly delicious for you, you are doing something wrong.

I made a HUGE batch of these muffins for an Easter breakfast at our church and everyone loved them.  I followed the advice of using half applesauce and half oil and the texture and flavor was still very good.  Mixing muffin batter is tricky...over-mixing is bad but I erred on the side of caution and left a few lumps which resulted in some of the muffins having pockets of flours baked right in.  Oh well...next time, I'll probably make a smaller batch.  The flavor is awesome and the glaze is delicious!  I might try lemon extract next time instead of almond.

This is a yummy recipe.  I've made it twice.  The first time, I followed the recipe to the letter.  The second time, I added an extra tsp of poppy seeds and used 2 tsp of lemon juice instead of almond extract.  I preferred the lemon version, but my wife preferred the almond version.  Again, both were great!

Definitely a keeper!

I made these the original way but substitued Lemon flavoring for the vanilla.  I didn't add the glaze as I thought they were a little on the sweet side. I'll cut down on the sugar next time I make them. They still did not have enough of a lemon flavor so will adjust that also.

This recipe is for the muffin part; I did not make the icing. These muffins are extremely tasty. They are not precisely muffins, more like small cakes. (There is a textural difference between muffins and cakes.) I used lemon extract and lemon juice to boost the lemony-ness since I didn't make the icing. When they came out of the oven, I rubbed the tops with a stick of butter and then before it dried, sprinkled with turbinado sugar. I don't know if that's how the bakeries get that sugar to stick or not, but it works for me (and who doesn't like a little butter on their muffins?) Halving this recipe made 17 regular-sized muffins and the topping I made used up 1 TB butter and 2 packets of Sugar in the Raw (in case anyone else is too lazy to make the glaze!) The only thing that disappointed me about this recipe was that the ones from the bakery are a deep roasted-turkey-skin shade of brown, inside and out, and I don't know how that's achieved -- these are pale whitish-gold. That's not a problem with the recipe, I just need to figure out how that color is achieved :) Thanks for sharing, these were delicious with a glass of milk and a mug of morning coffee!

These muffins are very sweet! I find them to be more like a cupcake than a muffin. I followed the recipe (without the glaze) exactly and they turned out fine. They do not rise very much and they do not brown. Like other reviewer, I used the toothpick test to tell when they were done. Next time I make them I will cut back on sugar and oil and see how they turn out.

These were very tasty, I agree that the glaze is what "makes" them.  On the down side - they are far too dense to be considered muffins and there is WAY too much sugar in them.  I'll keep looking for a muffin recipe, but these were by no means a disaster.

Very good recipe!  I toped mine with almonds like the ones in the picture and I thought is made them delicious and very appealing.  Also, used about 1/4 cup whole wheat in place of some white flour.  At least they are a little healthier ;)

These were quite good. Based on the other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1-1/4 cups - and they turned out slightly sweet as I like them. I also increased the poppy seeds to 2 t instead of 1-1/2 t. I did not do the glaze as I don't want these to be too sweet. They are yummy without it, tho.

The first time I baked these, I thought the amount of baking powder was insufficient (half of required) but made them as stated anyway.  As I thought, the muffins were too dense.  The second time around I increased to one tablespoon, decreased sugar to 2 cups and left out 1 tablespoon oil  (and increased almond extract to 1 T--I like a lot of almond flavor, but this may be too much for some).  The results with these changes were great; they were much lighter in texture. I also substituted 1 cup cake flour for 1 cup AP flour, or one could just use all pastry flour.

These hardly rose at all, owing, I suspect to the large amount of sugar in this recipe. I'm not sure I would even call these muffins....more like REALLY sweet cupcakes. I like sweet muffins, but even I could hardly eat these for breakfast. The almond flavor was good, but masked by too much sweet.

Would not recommend.  The muffins have poor texture.  To much sugar allows the muffin to stick to the pan.

These are very good, but too sweet.  I substituted applesauce instead of oil.

These were great.  They didn't raise up the way I expected but I think I should have adjusted them for high altitude. Thought about it but didn't do it. Next time I think I will use all almond extract and skip the vanilla as I love almond.  The kids gobbled these right down and the recipe makes a lot.

The muffins were great! I saw a comment that said that the vegetable oil was stuck in the middle of the muffin and I have a solution! Instead of using vegetable oil use melted butter it  doesn't get stuck in the middle and it makes the muffin itself less greasy. I didn't use the glaze since I don't eat muffins with glaze and it makes the muffin too sweet.

I just made these today and was hesitant about the amount of sugar and oil needed after putting it all in my mixing bowl... however, the muffins turned out pretty darn good. I mixed everything like it says and used my KitchenAid and let it mix while I put my fridge stuff away. I used my 3 Tbsp scoop, adding 2 scoops to each muffin tin and ended up with 30 full muffins and one 3/4 muffin. All of them puffed up beautifully and were toothpick ready after 18-20 minutes in my oven. They're not brown on top, but I think if I had waited for that they would have been better door stops... this way they're soft, moist, and yummy. Next time I think I will reduce the sugar and maybe try the oil/applesauce mix instead of just oil just because it makes me feel better LOL. I didn't do the glaze, I think they're great without it but I don't have a sweet tooth... Great recipe, going in my cookbook :)

These were just ok. Too much oil in my opinion, not a good fluffy cake or muffin. Dense and had an oily/eggy taste to it.

Changes: reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups; omitted glaze due to lack of time before bake sale. 
These are pretty good! I'm not an expert in poppy seed muffins but I liked these.  They look good too. Make sure you fill the muffin cups just short of full. The fuller they are, the rounder the muffins will be, and they don't overflow. As another reviewer mentioned, combine dry and wet ingredients separately, then just fold together, batter will be super lumpy but this is good.

I have made these twice, and both times, the flavor has been great! However, they do come out very dense and not at all fluffy and light like they should. That could be me doing something wrong, but as long as they taste good, I'm not too bothered. The only changes I've made have been to increase the almond flavoring in the batter (Though the particular one I'm using has a weaker flavor than others might), and to reduce the sugar and oil. They're still quite sweet with the reduced sugar, and if I added the full amount of oil, they would come out very greasy. I have not made the glaze included in this recipe, nor made it into a loaf, but as is, the muffins are pretty good. Maybe a few tweaks here and there would bring out the best in them, but they're still a go-to for when I'm craving poppy seed deliciousness.

Way too oily and sugary.  The outsides were crisp and super sticky to the sides of the muffin pan.  I tried them with paper liners as well and the paper just pulled half the muffin off with it.

So, so sweet. No need for a glaze at all. Texture it's spot on but I'd advise 2/3 of the sugar.

I tried this recipe after reading the reviews.  I loved the dense texture.  I increased the poppyseeds to 2 tbsp., lowered the sugar to 1 3/4 C., added zest of a lemon and it's juice. Left out the Almond extract to achieve a lemon poppyseed muffin.  Mixed the wet ingred. with the dry, stirring just until mixed.  Recipe yielded 20 muffins, and baked for prescribed time of 20 min.  I will bake these again but I will use canola vegetable oil in place of the olive oil, and I will spray my paper muffin cups with Pam, as they stuck to the paper. They still needed a stronger lemon flavor for me, as I do not wish the topping, so I will add lemon extract as well.  A nice recipe all in all.  Thank you Liz

Here are the things you must know to make these very good muffins:
1.  Do not underbake!  I used a convection oven, didn't reduce the temperature, and baked these for 25 minutes.  Baking for 20 minutes as specified resulted in half-baked muffins.

2.  Wait for the muffins to be just slightly warm before dipping in the room temperature glaze.  I found dipping to be superior to drizzling the glaze over the tops - the latter resulted in saturated, overly sweet muffins.

3.  Remember to take a picture of the four (I mean three) surviving muffins before snarfing them down!

4.  I think when making a new muffin recipe I will try making 5 (four at each corner and one in a middle-ish cup) rather than all twelve on the first run so if I need to adjust oven temperature or baking time I can figure that out before using the majority of the batter!

The muffin itself was greasy even with half applesauce and half oil. I tried to be gentle with the batter and leave some lumps but the bottoms of these muffins were still tough. I put the glaze on right out of the oven and the sugar was still gritty. I'll keep looking for my poppy seed muffin recipe this is not it!

I love, love, love this recipe! These are one of the most delicious muffins I've ever tasted. I've never made the glazing though, I think they are too good to add something more to them. And I recommend to use larger muffin forms instead of small ones.

Yum! I love the glaze. I have been wanting to make poppy seed muffins because I have a whole jar after making some Poppy Seed Chicken and needed to use them. I have never made homemade muffins and the first time I did BAM! Now I know these are really bad for me and I am not ashamed to hand out my very first batch to co-workers and friends because there is really nothing to improve on. The only thing I did different was sift the flour and then I added some poppy seeds onto the top of the glaze for decorations. Yum yum yum!

I used 2 tsp of vanilla and it turned out fantastic. I didn't have any paper liners so I just lined it with aerosol canola oil. The recipe is amazing and within one day my family ate the whole batch.

Fantastic recipe! Perfect flavor and texture! If you are using a normal muffin tin (not jumbo) there will be enough batter to make a dozen plus a loaf.  In lieu of the glaze,  I created a simple streusel topping with 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup sugar and  1/3 cup flour.  I placed half of it on the loaf with about 25 minutes left to cook - might add more poppy seeds to the batter next time.  The muffins don't need anything added, if you ask me.  The crust is perfect!

I agree with others in that this recipe didn't turn out for me. They were really greasy and flat and never quite cooked. I kept them in longer than it called for, but they were just flat and gooey. Very disappointed. However, I used the glaze on a different recipe and it was great!

I was looking for a simple recipie for lemon poppy seed muffins when I campe across this.  I switched out the almond extract for lemon extract and the orange juice for lemon juice and kept the rest as is.  They were amazing.  I'm sure the original recipie will be just as good so I'll have to try it as well.  I've made these with and without the topping and they're great either way

Awesome, yummy muffins and/or bread!  One of my favorite recipes.  Very moist and widely liked by everyone who tries them.  Great light flavor with almond, but it is not overpowering.  In my opinion the glaze is not necessary because it makes them way too sweet, but others may disagree.

This is the first recipe on this website that has dissapointed me.  I thought it was strange that this recipe suggests you mix the wet ingredients and then add the dry ingredients, since I always do it the opposite way.  Maybe they meant to mix the wet in one bowl and the dry in a second bowl and then mix the wet into the dry (which is the way I'd normally make muffins).  In any case I think the baking powder started to activate too soon because these muffins never really rised.  The batter also looked excessively wet and oily.  For my second batch I tried adding more flour and baking powder, but I think it was not salvageable.  I do like the addition of almond extract, so I may try the recipe again but I'd significantly decrease the vegetable oil and milk, and mix the ingredients the way I would normally do, not the way the recipe implies.

Easy, moist, delicious....thanks for sharing.  The glaze is awesome on them but they were just as good without it.  I ended up with 20 regular size muffins.

these muffins were a disaster - it might have been the high altitude. But, I still had to throw them all away!

I was able to make 12 large muffins and one loaf with the batter.  Reading the reviews, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups.  I also added 1 1/2 Tsp. of Butter flavouring (it goes awesome w/ the almond extract and poppy seeds)  I increased the poppy seeds to 1/4 C.  It's more like a cake/bread then a muffin.  THX.

My whole family loved these. Used muffin cups so they didn't stick. I just used a powdered sugar/orange juice glaze though- which tasted great. The muffins were dense and moist, just like made-from-scratch muffins are supposed to taste!

These are really good muffins.  I made some regular and some mini muffins.  We liked the mini muffins best; my kids gobbled them up in no time.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

These are terrific!  I made over 50 muffins for a church function and these were the first ones to go.  I made standard size muffins, and this recipe made almost 24.  I also used a shortcut for the glaze, I just mixed orange juice and powdered sugar.  I am sure the other glaze is much better, but I was in a rush and this glaze worked just fine and was quite good.

I gave four stars because of the ease of putting these together and baking them but I won't be making these muffins again.  I made them as is without the glaze and they were WAY too sweet.  They were also extremely sticky and never really turned golden brown.  This recipe would make a good poppy seed cake but it's just not right for morning muffins.  Like I said, 4 stars for ease.  Otherwise, I would only rate this a 3 in terms of taste.

These turned out cake-like. They were good, but next time I would add more poppy seeds and maybe try adding lemon extract?? The glaze was sticky, and nobody liked it. This recipe made 24 muffins! I didn't expect so many. I think I will try something different next time.

These turned out fabulous! Just the right texture, just what I expected, if not better!
I will however NOT use the orange sticky glaze again on them. IT was too sticky and stuck to the roof of my mouth. Great muffins though!

I agree with you: these are the best muffins I've ever made. My children love it and when I bake'em for the church, they are quickly over. Delicious the glaze, best the second day, but not always they last that long.

I will probably make this again, although I made a lot of changes mostly based on other reviews.  I used a 1/2 cup of applesauce to replace some of the oil and cut the sugar down to 1 3/4 cup.  I also cut down the milk and used 1/4 cup lemon juice to substitute.  Next time I would cut the almond extract down and maybe also the sugar to 1 1/2 cup.

One of my big questions about this recipe was the yield.  I used regular sized muffin tins and I got 28 muffins.    I baked them at 350 for 17 minutes and they were nicely done.  I don't have any complaints about flavor.  They were very tasty, but much too sweet.  I'm not sure the exact problem with this recipe, but there is definitely too much sugar.   Also, you'd better use liners.  I did not use them, sprayed pans well with cooking spray and they stuck like cement.  Another result of too much sugar, I think.    This might be a good recipe with the right tweaks if you know what to change.

Loved it! My 13 year old daughter made these and even though I'm sure she didn't follow all the directions (although I know she used all the ingredients), they turned out really good. Had to stop myself from eating them all!  Will definitely make them again.

Didn't make the glaze, but it doesn't need it. These aren't really muffins though - they definitely have more of the texture of a cake. They're perfectly serviceable and make WAY more than the recipe says, but they're not my favorite.

It was so yummy. I didn't make the glaze,  but I put  in nutmeg  and cinnamon and that worked pretty well. Also I used  chia seeds instead of  poppy seeds. Pretty simple and tasty.

I used the zest and juice of one lemon instead of the almond flavoring.  I also used 2 tablespoons of lemon juice rathe than orange juice in the glaze.

I used only 1/2 cup less sugar than it called for and only 1 teaspoon of almond extract. Muffins were very sweet and kind of rubbery- but the glaze was very good. I would not make these muffins again but I might make the glaze again for something else.

Good taste, very light and fluffy. I did make a few changes based on personal preferences. I changed the oil to 3/4 cup, the sugar to 1 3/4 cup, and 3 1/2 cup flour. I also added lemon zest and lemon juice to make the muffin moist without a strong lemon flavor. Very delicious after these few changes!

These are good, but after making them I realized that I’ve never had a poppy seed muffin that didn’t have lemon in them. Next time I will add lemon or find a different recipe, but these still turned out good.  I used a silicon basting brush to mop the glaze on them.

Came out really sticky. Loved the taste, but not worth the hassle of cupcake liners. Try greasing the pan or using something else to make sure the muffins don't stick.

Upon reading the initial recipe I was taken back by the amount of sugar, oil and eggs in this recipe.  I only used 1.5 c. sugar kept the oil and eggs.  Even mixing the batter is very eggy. I know muffins need to have lumpy batter, but this one took the cake,  the first 24 came out were chunks of flour and egg and the muffins are very dense,  not at all light and fluffy when you pull them apart. The rest of the 24 I made it mixed the  out of the batter for no lumps! They're baking a lot nicer than the first batch.  16 minutes at 350° out here in Texas.  They don't brown either,  toothpick in center,  clean,  they're still under baked pale,  but the bottoms are brown.  I may make a 2nd batch because these are a gift and the way these turned out,  I don't feel confident this is up to my standards when I bake for friends. The glaze is good, very sticky,  but good.  I'd use less sugar in that too. My teeth hurt.

Great customizable recipe.  I added way more poppyseeds and cut the sugar in half.  Would make more often but having a hard time getting FRESH poppyseeds at a reasonable cost.  Were dirt cheap when I was a kid, now you need to spend an arm and a leg.

Great taste, but texture needs improving. 

I made this as-is which was a mistake (I usually tweak the recipe according to other reviewers' suggestions or my own sense). While the batter smelled heavenly and the muffins tasted great, they were greasier than I like, had to cook a lot longer than other muffins I've made (18 mins at 375 is usually perfect in my oven; I baked at 350 as the recipe advised and had to cook them for 25 minutes so the insides weren't runny) and were still mushy inside but i had to take them out as the edges were getting crunchy and browned. 

The glaze was a bit too sweet for my liking despite reducing the sugar to half a cup. 

Recipe yielded 18 large muffins as written.

Wow! Delicious! Thanks to other reviewers, I followed recipe exactly but as others cautioned I did not thoroughly mix,  left it very lumpy as others recommended! Soo glad I did, they turned out beautifully! Raised with big domes, perfect amount of poppy seeds, they are so tasty!!!!! Just baked them in nonstick reg muffin dish, make sure to be generous with non stick spray and dont over bake!!! It only took mine about 14mins ish on 350.... highly recommend! New favorite!!!!

First of all these were delicious! 
The recipe claims this serves 12 with 557 calories per serving.  I was able to make 24 muffins with this reducing the calories in half if I followed the recipe.
I substituted 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda for the muffins reducing more calories per serving.  I did make the glaze with the orange juice.  For the glaze I used Splenda instead of sugar.  The glaze was not as thick as a result but it did give the muffin the flavor the recipe called for. 
I will definitely make these again; possibly using lemon in the glaze for a variation.

Very tasty, not too sweet but for us sweet enough that we didn't make the glaze.  Otherwise made them exactly  as recipe stated. Only thing I'll try next time is not to mix the batter too much, the muffins peaked a bit but they were still delicous. Also note the batter is very runny but seems to work, and its makes lots of muffins.  For us 24 regular size muffins plus extra batter.

I followed the recipe exactly for the muffins.  In the glaze I used lemon instead of orange and they are delicious!  Very moist, fluffy and the consistency firm not flaky.  I didn't think they were too sweet at all and I'm not big on sweet things.  I got 24 muffins out of this recipe.  I cooked all 24 in oven at the same time and I don't think my oven runs as hot as it says when heating, so I did have to add another 10 - 12 mins onto cooking time mentioned in recipe.

They turned out pretty good. My family loved them. I found them a bit sweet, and even though I subbed half the oil for applesauce, they tasted a little oily. But, like I said, everyone else loved them. I got 24 standard muffins and 24 mini muffins out of this recipe.

The recipe as published is obviously 1 1/2 times an original (2/3 of 1 1/8 cups, for example, is a much more typical 3/4 cup), and 2/3 of this batter is plenty for my purposes. I got out 2 bowls and measured wet ingredients into one, dry into the other, so I wouldn't miss anything, then used muffin mixing technique: stir JUST until you don't see white flour. I always use less almond extract than recipes call for--1/2 or less almond than vanilla--which makes a more balanced flavor. Also, if you want lemon in your poppyseed muffins--some people do--you'll need to add some in. For me, these are perfect without lemon.

I did what some of the reviews suggested. I mixed the dry ingredients separate and folded them into the wet ingredients. The batter was very very lumpy but it worked. I doubled the recipe and got 48 regular muffins and 24 mini muffins out of the double batch. (It was for a school project) I baked them for 18 minutes and it turned out wonderful. The glaze made the difference between a good muffin and an excellent muffin. I will definitely make these again.

Love this recipe - i always make 3 small loaves and I never have poppy seeds... But they turn out great every time. I am sure to do the 'muffin method' in mixing instead of following the instructions. I mix all the wet ingredients then the dry ingredients in different bowls and put them together at the very end.

Thank you for this recipe. I baked them for morning coffee time and ate two while they were still warm from the oven. I didn't change a single thing and I feel as though I have raised the bar for indulgence.

amazing and super moist! increased poppy seeds to 1/4 cup (4 TBSP), and decreased the butter in the glaze to 1 tsp.

Just finished baking these muffins.  They are so sweet they are disgusting.  I was hoping to take them to a baby shower but will now have to find another recipe.

these are excellent! my picky kids ate them all and fought over the last one! my husband loved them as well and he usually doesn't like poppy seed muffins. the glaze is great, and i definitely would be making these again and again.

i have made these many times and the loave with fresh lemon juice used in the glaze instead of orange is by far my favorite, though all versions are great!!

These were pretty darn tasty. I don't really think the topping really helped all that much. I agree with other  reviewers that the batter should be super lumpy when baked. it should look like you have marbles in there.

Very good. The recipe made more than my poor small muffin tin could keep up with so poured the rest of the batter into a bread pan to bake. The muffins were really good (family thinks so too!) My batter seemed pretty thin/runny so I added about another 1/2-1 C flour.

I wasn't that impressed. The inner consistency was a bit rubbery almost as if they hadn't baked quite right. I may have overmixed the batter, but I won't be using the batter recipe again.  On the other hand, the glaze is AMAZING! I'm sold.

The texture of these "muffins" was very strange.  My husband said that they were gritty, and I agree.  They were also very oily.  It just seemed like the ingredients didn't incorporate well together. They also turned out more like cupcakes than muffins. The ONLY reason I gave these 2 stars is that my husband said they had good flavor (but I used lemon extract instead of almond).

I made these muffins last night - but I scaled the recipe to 8 servings instead of 12.  I did cut back on the amount of sugar I used to about 1 1/3 cups.  This is the equivalent of 2 cups if you make for 12.

I didn't have any orange juice for the glaze so I used lemon juice and water because the lemon flavor was so strong - about 1 part lemon juice, 2 parts water - until it tasted right.

They turned out great!

These muffins are absolutely fabulous. They are basically poppy seed pound cake. You'll want to come back for more and more. My sister made these for her boyfriend and i luckily got to taste them. Right when i put them in my mouth i knew i would be making these all the time.

These were absolutely amazing!  I made sure not to mix them too much.  My only problem was that the recipe made way more than 12 regular muffins - I may have been able to make 18-24.  Great taste!

These are excellent. The recipe made more than a dozen muffins. I skipped the galze and sprinkled sliced almonds on top before baking. Me and my husband ate the first dozen before the second had finished baking. I wish I had tried these while I had company in town for the hoildays, thanks for the recipe!

glaze is delicious- try the muffins, cook them until not even brown on top and they will be just right.  I tried the loaves but it is hard to get them cooked all the way through and looking perfect.  Attempt only if you are a pro!

These were pretty good. I did not have almond extract so I doubled the vanilla...which I think would have made it better.  I also didn't feel like there were quite enough poppyseeds... I love them far too much for my own good.

These were good, although a bit salty.  I didn't make the glaze to go with them, which might have helped mask the saltiness.  I think next time I would definitely cut back on the amount of salt, but I will definitely try them again.

I made these for breakfast and they were great. I used 1 cup brown sugar along with the white. My daughter loved them as well.

The PERFECT poppyseed muffin recipe!  Exactly what I wanted.  I didn't put the glaze on top - they were delicious without it!  Perhaps I'll try next time.  Definitely sweet, but so good!  Everyone who tried the muffins raved about them.  Will certainly make again.  THanks for the recipe.
