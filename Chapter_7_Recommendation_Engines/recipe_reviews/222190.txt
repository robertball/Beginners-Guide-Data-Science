Quick and easy recipe to make, in addition it was fantastic. One thing I changed, because I could not locate chili paste at my grocery store, I used Siracha sauce and added in more horseradish shavings to kick up the hea. I highly recommend trying this recipe out, not only for Tuna, but for any other grilled fish.

When I read Chef John's introduction I knew this was the recipe for us. We too love to drown our sushi in copious amounts of wasabi in soy sauce. I used 1 tbsp of horseradish powder instead of fresh and Frank's Hot Sauce as I didn't have hot chile paste. It was awesome! Thanks Chef John for the simplest yet delicious recipe! It's my go to recipe for fresh tuna steaks.

When I make tuna steaks for dinner this is the recipe I always use. I don't change anything. Both my husband and picky eater son love this.

I thought this was great! I added a little extra horseradish root. It was super simple, which is always a plus. Since we have a freezer full of tuna, I enjoyed that this tasted different than so many other tuna recipes.

Excellent with the fresh horseradish. I found with a little more chile paste it brought a little more heat to the dish. Very easy to prepare.

I really enjoyed the flavors of the sauce (I put a little bit over my rice as well)!  I did sub prepared horseradish for the fresh (because that's what I had on hand).  Made for a nice "meatless Monday" meal.

This was awesome.Probably the best tuna recipe I’ve tried. Family raves about it. Local store didn’t have horseradish root so I bought a jar of ground horseradish at the deli. DEFINITELY recommend adding more horseradish after it’s prepared. Brings it to another level of awesome.

Easy, nutritious, and excellent flavor.  Made almost according to recipe.  Grocery store did not have horseradish root so had to use prepared horseradish and did not want to buy Sambal Chile Sauce for 1/2 teaspoon so used Sriracha Sauce.  Will make this again with fresh horseradish but will still use Sriracha Sauce.

Do again.  Served as a simple yet tasty meal with grilled asparagus and paired with an Alsatian Pinot Noir rosé.  Used jarred horseradish which I drained well.  You need to watch the timing on the tuna as it does tend to dry out.  Followed the timing instructions,  but you need to be mindful.

This is a very good marinade! I used four boneless chicken breasts from Costco (love those!) and doubled the recipe. I subbed in  Sriracha and used just a teaspoonful.  I marinated the chicken all day, boiled the leftover marinade and basted the chicken a few times in the last 15 minutes of cooking time.  Tasty!!

I didn't have all the stuff  but substituted with similar and it turned out Great.  I'm no cook either.  I didn't have a grill either.  I used one of those new microwave bowls that grills after 3 min. I gave them a half turn just  like he said. Oh.  I didn't have Tune either.  I used Salmon from the Dollar Tree, put it on day old rice and boy was that good.  I finished up the Stir Fry from a couple of days ago to with a little dried up garlic toast.  It was a feast.

This was good, but I think there are better tuna recipes on this site.  I didn't have any tomatoes which I think would have helped.  Husband liked it better than I.

My BF caught some tuna so I wanted to do something special with it and went straight to Chef  John.  I had everything on hand except the horseradish, so I substituted fresh ginger root.  It was fantastic and the tuna was to die for, a perfect way to make my friend's accomplishment the star of the show.

Not spicy at all and too much soy sauce flavor that masked the other flavors. Sounded like it will be better than it as.

I had to use wasabi in place of the horseradish and added 2 tablespoons.  OUTSTANDING !
