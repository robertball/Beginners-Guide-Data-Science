Thought it was a good idea at the time...the recipe was pretty bad, dry, not much taste.  No one in my family liked them.

These are not your typical muffin. Very dense. By themselves they don't taste very good. Really dry. However if you spread some Nutella on them? Yum. I baked them in paper cups which turned out to be a bad idea, the bottoms stuck to the paper. The sides of the muffin didn't though so we are just cutting off the bottoms.
