I made these this afternoon and they are DELICIOUS.  I did make a few changes, first I used egg whites to equal 1/2 cup egg substitute.  I also eliminated 1/4 cup of the sugar.  I added 1 tsp. espresso powder to deepen the chocolate flavor and baked the brownines in an 8x8 pan rather than a 13x9 pan.  The result was a thick, moist, cake like brownie that my family loved.

Great Low-fat brownie recipe. I used the splenda/sugar and a 8X8 pan, though i had to bake it longer than 22mins still turned out great!

These are really good brownies.  I used a whole egg instead of egg substitute but everything else was the same.  It was great.  I will definitely make these again!

I had a little sweetened condensed (soy) milk leftover & came across this recipe.  I  reduced the recipe to accommodate the milk, replaced the egg substitute with mashed bananas, and baked in my toaster oven.  It was delicious! I know I changed the recipe slightly, but don't think it was enough to alter it into a different recipe. I will be making this one again.

This is a great low fat brownie recipe. I too used  egg whites instead of egg substitute. The brownies are super moist, sweet, and chocolaty.

These taste excellent for a lower fat option! I didn't have any egg substitute, so I used 3 egg whites and a tsp or so of water to make a frothy mix.

I used a mashed banana in place of the egg substitute, added strong coffee, and decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I also used a smaller pan.  These brownies taste a lot better after they cool for a while.

A very good low-fat brownie. I sprinkled some mini chocolate chips on top after it had baked for 5 minutes.

These brownies were sooo good!  I used 3 egg whites in place of the egg substitute.  I added a dash of water to the egg whites and beat until frothy like it say to do with the egg substitute.  I baked it in a smaller pan (11X8) so adjusted the baking time accordingly.  I have already made 2 batches.  My boys love these brownies and are amazed they are low-fat.
