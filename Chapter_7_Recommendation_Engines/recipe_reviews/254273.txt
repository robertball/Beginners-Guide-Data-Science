Delicious. I made mine with white chocolate chips and added Heath Toffee bits to the mixture before dunking frozen ice cream in it. I took a quart of ice cream and put it in disposable cups, which I froze for hours, cut the cup away, inserted sticks, cut the ice cream into bars, then froze it again. I let the chocolate mixture cool for up to 30 min before coating the ice cream, so the heat wouldn't melt the ice cream, and the shell became solid within a minute, and it's thick enough when it's cool to where only one coating is needed. Freeze again after dipping. Soooo good!

These are great with coconut milk ice cream and dairy-free chocolate for a delicious gluten-free/dairy-free dessert.  No compromises.
