Pretty good.  I tried this recipe with fresh chopped mint bc I had to cut back my mint.  It's good, but it needs more mint in my opinion--I'd double the amount next time. Hubs also said he didn't really like the strawberries in it, so I'd leave those out next time.  I also think it needs a bit of vanilla to perk it up, but it's a great starting point, and a perfect amount for a KA mixer, so no need to cut it down.  Thanks for the recipe!
