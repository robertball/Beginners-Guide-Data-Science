Most of our home cooking is done by my better half but with 5 kids (one a newborn) I have been trying my hand. This was a fantastic and easy dinner for which I got showered with praise by the whole family!

I give it 5 stars because it is very good and very simple to make in a hurry. It's basically simple nachos but with the nachos being replaced by crescent dough. I recommend lining the baking dish with the dough allowing the excess to hang over the top edges. Also I recommend cooking the dough in the oven at least until mostly done while you cook the hamburger meat because for some reason(maybe the meat will not allow enough heat to build between it and the dough) the dough never cooked all the way for me. Even after reinserting the whole thing back into the oven for another 15 minutes. Also try topping with cheddar cheese, then lettuce, then chopped jalape√±os and picante or your favorite salsa. Very good, very easy, very quick, perfect for any day! Especially after a long day when you just want to put an end to it and relax a bit!

I make this same recipe but instead of crescents I cut biscuits into quarters and layer the bottem of the pan. And yes! you should bake them mostly done before adding the meat and other ingredients or the breading will not cook all the way. this is very simple to make and tastes delicious!

I made it it was awesome... My husband don't like vegies but I put the lettuce with tomato and onion on my own plate. My husband decided too add 3\4 cup red enchilada sauce to the hamburger meat it gave it a hole new flavor

Made as written and loved it. Cooked the crescent rolls a little before adding ingredients. My family loved it and my son who hates beans didn't even notice the retried beans. They kinda blended together with the meat.

I took it to a pitch in and it was a hit! Like the other reviewers, I baked the croissants in the pan before adding the other ingredients. I served with tomatoes, sour cream, and chips  on the side.

Very easy, quick, and tasty.  Instead of crescent rolls, I layered a couple of whole wheat tortillas, refried beans, meat mixture, salsa, and cheese.  After baking, I topped it with lettuce, sour cream, and black olives.

This is a family favorite! Since the first time I've made it per the original recipe, I have adapted it to a 13x9" pan and have fun mixing up the fillings. It is very versatile; just use your (Mexican ingredient) imagination and layer to your palate's content!

The crescent rolls did not cook completely even after several more minutes in the oven than suggested.
