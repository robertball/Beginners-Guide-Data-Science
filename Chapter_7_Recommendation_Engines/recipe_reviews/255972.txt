I liked it, but my kids didn't. I made homemade crust. I will make it again when my kids are older to see if they like it better.

My family loved this meal! I did make a few changes. I used turkey sausage instead of regular sausage and added turkey bacon. I also only used a cup of vegetables. I put aluminum foil around the edges for all except the last 10 mins and it came out perfect.
