Not good. We thought the addition of broth to fondue was a little strange, but the rest of it sounded good...... And the taste WAS pretty good, really. Unfortunately, there was so much liquid (between the broth, wine, and lemon juice) that the cheese (and I used both regular Swiss AND some Emmentaler to class it up) just formed one big lump in the liquid. I've made fondue before, and I understand that adding lemon juice can reduce clumpiness, but this wasn't just clumpiness. It was a lump of cheese in a pool. Taste-wise: 3 stars. Fondue-ability: 1 star. There are better recipes out there.

Did not have any white wine on hand so I used extra chicken broth instead. Also, I used chopped garlic and kept it in the cheese the whole time. Dee-lish!

If you are looking for an authentic swiss tasting fondue this one is great. We used half swiss and half gruyere cheese and it came out fantastic.

This turned out really good!! I ran into the clumping problem but when it was brought to a boil, and I just let it sit it, all just came together! Very yummy!

A big hit at last Thanksgiving! I use part-skim cheese so no one dies of a heart attack.

Made it exactly how it calls for and while the taste was excellent, I couldn't find the balance with my fondue pot, so it was either boiling and runny, or stringy and clumpy.

Followed the directions, but it turned out as cheese and broth not an even mixture.

The taste was great, but once we added the corn starch mix, it became one big clump of cheese.
