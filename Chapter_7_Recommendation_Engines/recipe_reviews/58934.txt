This recipe I have known, made and enjoyed for many years. If you mix about a half the amount of the ingredients listed and use smaller cans(soup cans), you can make this on a camp fire. A tin foil cover helps. Don't put the cans right on the coals. Hence Hobo bread!

I did this a little different... purely because i wanted something quick and easy... Did it with dark brown sugar (stil the full 400g) and just mixed it all together and bunged it on the oven... Tok about 45m... Not bad bread at all!

i was initially going to rate this a 3 but the days after i made it it tasted way better. Very quick and quite tasty. I might make again but it was nothing spectacular.

surprising I don't like raisins but this recipe is oh so good. I only used 1 cup of raisins and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. And made in regular bread pans.
