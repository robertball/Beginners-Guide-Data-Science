Easy and tasty, but I made it in the oven so it was probably not as good as it would have been on the grill!  Keep for summer time...

This was so delicious. I did not change a thing. I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about how flavorful the shrimp was. I wish I could give this recipe 6 stars

Tried the glaze on Mahi Mahi and baked it (poured 1/2 the glaze on top) - delicious... saved 1/2 the glaze, heated it until thick and bubbly, and poured over mahi when serving. This is a keeper for sure!

This was overall pretty good. And we will make it again, but I think that the the cornstarch didn't work. We could taste it a little and feel it. The flavor without the cornstarch was good though. Next time i will do this as a marinade, for about 30 minutes ahead of time. Minus the cornstarch.

I made these when it was too cold out to grill, so I put them in the broiler and they turned out just fine.  I also used white rum, because that was what I had on hand.  Very good-nice flavor.

This marinade was FANTASTIC! I left out the cornstarch, it didn't seem necessary. I also upped the amount of fresh ginger and cilantro to suit our tastes. The shrimp was so delicious that I made the marinade again for chicken just days later. It was equally delish!

Everyone like this!  I doubled the sauce and added garlic then saute'd in skillet, couldn't grill, as it was about 5 degrees outside. Enough sauce to serve over pasta.

I used all the juice from one large lime, left out the cornstarch, and added a crushed clove of garlic.  The marinade smelled so good and left a very nice flavor on the shrimp.

I don't really like seafood so I made this for my wife and she absolutely loved it!   The kids really liked the taste too.   I didn't change anything from the original, and with the way the family liked it, I don't think there is a need to.

Used over broiler 4 min each side, very impressed with the citrus flavor so quickly infused to the shrimp, I even dipped them back in the marinade before eating! Definitely will make again!

I broiled my recipe as it was not only cold outside but muddy around our grill. I also added pineapple chunks to the skewers & served with coconut rice.  Everyone loved it!  It will definitely be a boat recipe.

Great flavor!   Next time, I will use a little less honey and more lime and ginger.  It was just a little too sweet for me as written.  Oh, and as other reviewers, I also did not use all of the corn starch.  I will add more next time so the sauce thickens and sticks to the shrimp more but I will add a little at a time and test it as I go.
