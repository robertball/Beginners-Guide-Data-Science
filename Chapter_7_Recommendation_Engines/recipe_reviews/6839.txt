This is a great basic muffin recipe.  I have been using this same recipe for many, many years.  It is very adaptable - add fruit, nuts or diced cooked bacon.  Our favorite variation is Surprise Muffins.  Put 1 tablespoon of batter into muffin tin, top with 1 teaspoon of jelly (strawberry or plum) then add batter to fill muffin tin 2/3 full.  Bake as usual.  The "surprise" is the jelly center!  I love basic recipes that can be used again and again - and this is one of them!!

My son wanted a plain muffin so I tried these, I doubled the recipe and got 12 large muffins, I used melted butter for the oil, added a pinch of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla, I halved the sugar because I added a tsp of blueberry jam inside each muffin, very good, baked 20 mins at 350 in my oven.

This is the best recipe! I made this in my 
"Foods" class in high school (1996) and I have loved it ever since. As simple as the recipe is, I lost it and I haven't made it in  a couple years- but I'm so glad I found it again!  Thanks for posting the recipe!!  :)

I was looking for a basic muffin recipe and I found it!! The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly and they were good.  The second time, I wanted to play around with it so I added a little vanilla extract and some chocolate chips and they were delicious! A big hit :D Thank you

GREAT muffins!!  I only got 9 muffins from this recipe not 12, so next time, I might make a double batch.  I served these with the honey butter recipe also found on this site.  My husband had 3 of them with his dinner and my 5 year old ate 2 of them and was still asking for more! Thank you for this wonderful recipe, it will be a regular at my house!

My boys inhaled the whole batch of these muffins.  My only complaints are that they stuck to the muffin tins and that it feels like I'm feeding the kids cake!  If I could find a way to sneak in some nutritional value, they'd be perfect.

Simple and delicious!  Good by themselves, better with sauces, jellies, or gravies.   These work for both sweet and savory dishes!   They also baked up nicely with eggBeaters, Splenda, 1% lowfat milk and unsweetened applesauce substitutes for the full-fat ingredients.    A true winner!

Made these for Grandpa's birthday. Grandpa is our cat. Yes, you read that right...I made muffins for the cat's birthday. She didn't get any, but my husband was happy to celebrate for her. Unfortunately, these simple muffins were not that tasty...just ok. I probably won't try them again.

I rated these four stars because while they are very plain (with a hint of sweetness) they are actually a nice bread addition to a meal without stealing the limelight. We spread honey butter on ours and enjoyed them with dinner. For those wondering what they taste like...they taste very similar to corn bread, but less corny. But they are simply and yummy!

These are quite delicious, and so simple!  I made them on a rainy, chilly Saturday morning and my daughters devoured them.  I had just run out of milk, so I substituted buttermilk because I had some in the house from a recipe I had used earlier in the week.  My oven tends to run a little cool, so I baked them at 410 degrees for 25 minutes.  I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on them when they came out of the oven.  They were light and fluffy with a crisp crown. I can only imagine how delicious they will be with blueberries, cranberries, or chocolate chips.  There is no way to get a dozen muffins from this recipe, though.  It made six good-size ones.  Delicious!

I just pulled these out of the oven and could not help but try. If you like muffins...these are simple and simply amazing. I followed the recipe exactly.  It paired great with our spicy jambalaya!

This is a recipe I'll tape on the inside of one of our kitchen cabinet doors.  
We are short on some ingredients, but what I changed still worked great.  We're out of milk, so I used water instead.  No fresh fruit right now, so I put a jelly layer (blackberry jelly) in between two layers of batter.  I sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking at 350 for 25.  The batter came out to about 8 good size muffins, rather than 12.  Oh, and we're using coconut oil in place of vegetable oil and that worked out just fine.

These were really good. I used red Mill Gluten free all purpose flour, as we were trying out cooking gluten free. With the GF flour it tasted like whole grain. I loved how these were sweet but not too sweet, and totally adaptable. Delicious!

Very good, tried and true recipe that I use quite often! Not overly sweet at all and good basic recipe for additions. Sometimes I add 1/2 cup raspberry flavoured apple sauce instead of milk. Also have added choco chips, blueberries and crushed pineapple for different flavours. They are great with chili and corn chowder as well, with a little less sugar. Pretty much fool proof.

I didn't make muffins with the recipe, I just made bread.  The only thing wrong with it is it didn't get brown, but sure tasted good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Added a little vanilla but something was missing. I think they needed to be topped with a sprinkling of sugar just for some texture. I made the double batch and then split it (unevenly) because 3 of us wanted blueberry muffins and one wanted chocolate chip and that worked out well. Will definitely keep this as a basic muffin recipe to add whatever to. I also think the ones they sell in the supermarket are way sweeter than this recipe - these are perfect

I was about to submit this recipe.  I made this for the first time when I was in the 7th grade, Home Ec class. They even have the same name. I've made them for 40 years now.  They have always been a family favorite.

Wow!  These are great!  My kids ate them all up... and I even thought I had baked them just a tad too long.  They would be great at breakfast time, maybe even add some mini chocolate chips for a treat.  Thanks!  This recipe will get used a lot at our house!

I agree this is a great basic recipe!  I'm not very creative and tend to strictly follow recipes, but on my first time with this one, I added a tsp. of cinnamon, about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 tsp. almond extract. My husband loved them. They're just sweet enough and can handle the variations of your choice.  Next time, which will be soon, I will use a few more pecans and a full tsp. of vanilla rather than almond, along with the tsp. of cinnamon.  Yum!!

I’ve been making these for years! They are a favorite that we serve with dinner in place of corn bread or other bread options. They go great with pork dishes, chili, stew etc... But, I always add 2 eggs instead of one. Much better texture, not as dry. I also prefer a silver/aluminum muffin tin as the non stick are too dark and the bottoms always get too brown.

Easy tasty recipe . I added half cup cooked oatmeal for moistness.  I filled cups. Half full and added peach and strawberry jam to cup for 6 of each  kind. Covered with remaining batter. Baked as directed and when eaten had  preserves already in. Tasted amazing. Boyfriend said I had to try them again just to be sure not a fluke :)

I have been making these since trying them in Home Ec class back in the mid 70’s. I add 1 cup chopped apple to the recipe. These muffins aren’t around long!!!

These were so good! I put a little jelly in the middle of some, and it was delicious. The ones without jelly were a little dry, but over all, they were great!

I made these as written and thought they were pretty good. I don't consider these 'sweet' muffins or my sweetometer is off. These are a dense muffin one more like i'd serve with dinner not a sweet fluffy fruity muffin like I would enjoy with coffee for breakfast. Actually I think these taste and feel more like a biscuit than a muffin. I even cut mine in half and ate it with jam and coffee, now that was good! And is probably how I will eat the rest of these and/or try with fruit added next time. I will make them again for sure, but it's either a jam or fruit added muffin for me.

It was a huge hit at my office! I substituted milk for Silk Almond-Coconut blend and the sugar with a coconut palm sugar. i also added about 1 cup of blended (small bits) dark cherries and maybe 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips. They were awesome. I want to try with egg substitute and gluten free if possible because we have many allergies in my office. But I loved the recipe for it's small size. Will definitely make again!

These were ok. I added raspberry jam into the center of half and cinnamon chips in the other half and they were sill just ok. I didn't think they had much flavor. If I made them again I would definitely add vanilla or something to give them a boost of flavor which they desperately need.

These were awesome. Made for some great muffins. Trusting in the AR community, we made ours a 6x sized batch and did 3/4ish blueberry and the rest raspberry for our first time making these:) We weren't disappointed! Great the next day warmed up and with butter, oh my so good!

Made these as per the instructions with about 1C of frozen blueberries (tossed in a little flour).  In half, I also added a few chocolate chips.  The muffins came out bland and sort of dry/cakey.  These aren't the worst muffins I've ever made but definitely not the best.

They tasted plain, but good. When it said 2/3, my paper cups started to fall apart. I'd rather put half just like I did. I did 30 instead of a dozen, it came out to be 9. Make sure you count how much before putting.

GREAT RECIPE. such a easy muffin to make and you can add almost anything to it. I have done blackberry and banana so far. i cant wait to try choc chip and blueberry! 

TIP. just mix batter to incorporate ingredients. Over mixing will get you a bready heavy muffin more like a pound cake!. ALSO. mix baking powder with flour before mixing.

This is truly the easiest muffin recipe I have ever made and my husband says "Yummy". Thank You.

So easy! I didn't use oil, just melted some margarine and added some cinnamon.  It has to be doubled if you want them to last more than an evening!

I added a cup of fresh raspberries, some lemon extract and about another 1/8 cup of sugar. They were good but I think next time I'll add 1/4 sugar because with the fruit needed a bit more.

These are EXCELLENT and easy to make muffins.  I substituted 1/4 c of applesauce for the oil, and 1/2 c of soy milk for regular to cut down on the fat.  I also added about 1/2 c of frozen blueberries.  They were superb!  They didn't taste dry at all as some other reviews have stated.

Really simple, plain muffins!  They came out of my muffin pan perfectly and had a super moist inner and extra crunchy outer.  This recipe is perfect for adding any kind of fruit, nuts, or chocolate chips to.  I will definately be making it again!!  I made a few plain, and the rest added tiny apple chunks and sprinkled sugar on them.  They were great!

What I love about a great basic muffin recipe is that you can customize it to your needs.  I've made this one as written, which is very good.  I've also added cinnamon and vanilla, and replaced 1/2 the oil with applesauce to make a sweet muffin.   It's also incredibly fast and easy.

I almost didn't get a chance to taste these yummy muffins, I ran out of flour, and It was the only ingredient I was missing, so I went on down to my neighbor's house and borrowed some flour. (: Oh and I'm glad that I did! These muffins were so delicious, I added some blueberries and walnuts the second batch around. tastes great with anything, in my opinion.

These muffins taste good. They just didn't crown very well for me, probably because I substituted applesauce for the oil.  I added about 1/2 c. of fresh blueberries.  I will use this recipe again, and try other add-ins.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good these muffins turned out!  They are super easy to make and were almost (though not quite) bakery quality...I still thought they deserved a "5."  I added a large handful of mini chocolate chips and took another reviewer's recommendation of adding a tsp. of jam in the middle.  I only got eight good sized muffins instead of twelve.  But, they are good!!

I just made these and they are a wonderful basic muffin recipe. I didn't have any eggs so I used applesauce instead, and you wouldn't able to tell the difference. I made a double batch so I could make many varieties. I got 6 blueberry muffins, 6 cranberry walnut muffins with streusel, 5 jelly filled, and 16 mini chocolate chip muffins. All of them are very good. :)

This is a great basic muffin recipe you can use as a jumping off point: I stirred in some ground pecans for an absolutely wonderful, nutty breakfast muffin.  My dad absolutely loved them, and he can be a tad picky about sweet things.  This is definitely a good "master recipe" to keep in your file.

These turned out really well!  Almost like a biscuit more than a muffin!  And, they still tasted great the next day, just heat em' up!

These did rise to a perfect peak and they were good, but they were a little on the dry side.

This is a wonderful muffin recipe, just a bit too sweet for my husband and I, even though we love sweet.  I would cut down the sugar and definetly use this recipe again, the muffins looked perfect and the tops rose nicely.
