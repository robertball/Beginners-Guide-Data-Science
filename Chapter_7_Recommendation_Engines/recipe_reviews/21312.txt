I would definitely fight over the last piece of this cake!  The peanut butter frosting is out of this world; especially if you're a peanut butter freak like I am.  I baked it in a removable tube pan and I guess because of it, I needed to add about another 20 mins. baking time.  I also decreased the amount of confectioners sugar in the frosting from four cups to less than three. It was plenty sweet and absolutely fabulous!

nice cake- not just the regular boring chocolate cake here.
 I halved the recipie to make a smaller layered cake with the frosting in between layers.  but the frosting recipie did not turn out well for me at all.  it was not smooth at all, so i had to add a little more milk and some melted chocolate chips to make a usable consistency.
 other than that, it was a very nice little cake!

I just made this cake for a dinner party and it is delicious! The next time I make this cake, I will only make half of the frosting as this recipe makes a TON of frosting that is far to rich to use all of!

This cake is sooo delicious, however it does take some preperation time. Overall, it is chocolaty but not too rich, and the icing makes it an instant hit!

I made this cake for a friend, he loved it, along with all his employees.  Made a second one and took it to my office, I think it was love at first bite.  The only thing I had to do was add more milk to the frosting.  This one is definately a keeper.

The first time I made it the center fell and it was a thick, fudgy consistancy. (probably because it was taken out when the timer beeped and I was busy /w the baby)  I just made it again today and cooked it about 8 minutes longer than the cook time.  It didn't fall & was very moist.  It's a chewy chocolate cake /w a hint of cinnamon.  Not the classic fluffy chocolate cake.  I didn't do the icing this time since I used it in Death by Chocolate (i wouldn't recommend it for this because of the cinnamon) perhaps I'll give it another try someday.

My husband took this cake to work.  Everyone said it was delicious.  A lady was eating the crumbs out of the pan.  Several people asked for the recipe.

I made this cake for a potluck yesterday.  It was a hit, although I thought the frosting was a little too sweet.  My sister, who is a fudge-a-holic, loved it.  I guess it depends on your sweet-tooth.  :o)

I don't know what I did wrong, but this cake wasn't what I expected.  Didn't even look like the deep, rich chocolate cake in the pic.  Will not try again.

Delicious! Moist, Rich and absolutely delicious. My family is lactose intolerant so I substituted lactose free whole milk for the buttermilk- It was still DIVINE.  Will keep this recipe and make this one again.

The cake was delicious, but the icing did not spread well.  I made the recipe twice in case I made a mistake.  The icing s thick and did not spread out evenly.  It was yummy though.

Did not care for the texture of this cake, and the frosting was too thick and too sweet. Didn't like the peanut butter in it and I use unsweetened peanut butter.
I sort of like the cinnamon kick in the chocolate, so I might try that with my favorite chocolate cake recipe.

So rich.  Too rich. I had even cut back on confectioner sugar to 3 C. It tasted like GS Tagalong cookies....which is a good thing.....it is just too rich for my taste.

One word...AMAZING! This cake is to die for. I love the extra somethin the cinnamon adds to the cake. Hubby refuses to share with family because he loves it so much! Will definitely be making this again!
