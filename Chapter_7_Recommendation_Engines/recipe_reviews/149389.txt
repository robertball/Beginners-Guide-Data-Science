Very simple and good, but I had to play with it a bit to get the flavor I wanted....like others, I added some minced garlic but back on the honey and I added some red pepper flakes to give it a little pizzaz. But, overall it turned out to be a nice vinaigrette over mixed greens.

This is such a tasty dressing, and healthy, too!  I love that you can throw all the ingredients right into the food processor.  I've made this several times now, and I think I like it best when I add a clove or two of garlic.  The garlic flavor seems to get stronger the longer you store it though, so watch out for that.  Thanks for my new favorite salad dressing!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I cut the oil a bit to cut the fat.  I think its important to use a very good balsamic vinegar to really make this good.  Loved how the red pepper thickens the dressing.  Thanks so much for sharing this one!

YU-HUH-UH-MEEE!! Great balance of flavors and sweetness. I strained the dressing to get the last of the red bell pepper skin bits out but otherwise, followed the recipe. Would probably very tasty with roasted red peppers too. Thanks for the recipe - we will be enjoying again.

I love this easy dressing.  It is wonderful on tomatoes or greens alone.  I usually use more salt and pepper.  For a little change, sometimes I add a dash of Worcestershire or a clove of garlic.  It blends up zippy quick with my electric hand mixer.  I think next time I roast garlic, I will try it in this recipe.  I am on a sugar free diet, so I skip the honey completely or substitute a packet of stevia.

Update:  Can't find any good red bell peppers around here right now.  I tried it with roasted red peppers out of a jar, and it was still delicious.

This was just OK for me.  I expected more flavor.  I liked it better as a dip for my french bread than a salad dressing.

Really easy to make as everything is just tossed into a blender, and tastes great, refreshing! Also added a clove of garlic as others have suggested

This is some seriously tasty dressing! I was worried that this would be too sweet for my taste so I only added one tbsp of honey, I added 1 tbsp of lemon juice, 2 tsp of minced garlic and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. It does look a little strange, but tastes amazing, and it's soooo easy to make:)

I made this Vinaigrette last night - it was good as advertised. I might add some citrus juice next time to balance out the sweetness - lemon, lime or orange - any suggestions? Other than that, it was perfect. It'll be one my staple vinaigrettes.

This was a really delicious dressing on a salad of mixed greens and finely shredded veggies (carrots, kohlrabi, celery, red peppers and red onion).  I used Salt & Pepper flavored croutons, which balanced out the sweetness.  Everyone in my family loved it!

This was delicious.  Great on salad but also used it in a zip and steam bag with a chicken breast and it was absolutely yummy!

This was ok, but I didn't love it. The red bell pepper flavor was really strong.

It's good, healthy, quick. The flavor is good in a mixed salad but it's not strong enough to be a main feature.

I added garlic and 1 shallot before blending, but this could still use a little more flavor, maybe more balsamic or salt? Not bad though

I did use garlic as some people suggested and I used roasted red peppers instead of fresh. This will be my new go to dressing.

This was just a ho-hum recipe for us.  We like a lot of flavor in our dressings and this just didn't have it.  I won't be making it again.

My family liked this dressing but for me was not sweet enough may try again with less vinegar.Thanks
