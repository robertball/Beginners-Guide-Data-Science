This steak marinade was awesome- we used it instead of chicken in the Asian Chicken Salad (listed in salads).  We have it marinating again today- we'll probably eat it over and over until we can't bear to see it again!!

Wow!  We loved this dish.  I couldn't find rice wine so I omitted it.  I used 1/2 a Vidalla onion rather than red since it was what I had.  I couldn't find fresh lemon grass so used a jar of dried.  I also left out the garlic salt and added a clove of minced garlic.  

Nothing in the dish has an over powering flavor and we couldn't get enough of it at our house.  I was concerned about the 3 tablespoons of chile paste, but the dish had an undertone of spiciness, but wasn't hot at all.  In fact, I planned to give my 4 yo a hotdog, but she not only ate some but asked for seconds.

I was really hoping to like this recipe, but as it is, I thought it was just ok, and not worth the trouble of getting my charcoal grill going. The flavor was pretty good, but something in the seasonings was a little off--too much coriander? Too much sake? I'm not sure. I made this according to the recipe except for substituting shallots for onions and crushed garlic for garlic salt. Oh, well--I might try it again, only on the stove, and I might reduce the marinade for a glaze. However, for all of you out there who love this recipe but are having a hard time finding lemongrass--one trip to an Asian grocery store and one good growing season, and you can have a pot full of lemongrass--the stalks will grow roots if they're fresh enough and placed in water for a few weeks. Just keep your cats away from them--mine go nuts for lemongrass.

I made this for the first time for company.  We had several thai style dishes and this was the least favorite.  I thought it was fine, but no one else seemed to like it for some reason.  They thought the spices didn't taste right.  My husband said next time he would omit the rice wine and cut back on the soy sauce.

Wow!  The taste is absolutely phenomenal!   I served with an old fashioned texas spicy cream of carrot soup and a light salad, and it was a major hit!

I made a few changes by adding fresh garlic instead of garlic salt (soysauce is salty enough).This recipe was a HUGE hit for some realy foodies that I served it to.  I marinated Filet instead of Flank Steak to make the affair a little more upscale.  I served cold noodles with peanut sauce, green salad with a cilantro lime dressing, and meyer lemon roasted asparagus.  The meal was fantastic!

I have made this for a couple years now. It is outstanding and deserves more stars. I do not omit any ingredients, use McCormicks dried lemon grass and soak in warm water for 20-30 minutes before chopping, and do use fresh mint and basil. I marinate the meat 24-48 hours, bring up to room temparature before cooking and cook medium rare, let it rest a few minutes and slice very thin and serve with fried rice or a salad with some type of Asian dressing. It makes great left overs for steak salad or steak sandwhiches. I have made it for house geusts a few times and everyone raves about the taste and how tender the meat is.

This is pretty good.  I'm not crazy about the cooking method.  I just cooked it right on the grill.  I also used 2 cloves fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I do feel like it's missing fish sauce though and next time I make it I'll slip some in.  It did smell fabulous on the grill.  Reminded me of street vendors!

OK ....... a bunch of ingredients you seldom see together, but it seemed interesting. I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I grow my own lemongrass, basil, mint, and a bunch of other stuff so it wasn't difficult to prepare. The biggest issue I had was the lack of cooking detail. 20 minutes on medium-high (on my grill) got RARE. I then sliced it all and returned it to the grill grates to finish cooking for another 5 minutes. I may try the recipe again -- but just for the marinade / sauce. I'll stick to other proven flank recipes.

We made this in the slow cooker instead and it turned out amazing. Just dump all of the ingredients in the crock pot covering the flank steak with the marinade. Put on low 8 hours and you are done!

My mom is Japanese so I have almost exclusively prepare my steaks with soy sauce-based mariandes. I love the ingredients in this marinade so I expected a really delicious steak, but for a soy sauce-based mariande, it really wasn't that flavorful. Wasn't bad, but I won't make it again.

We were ready for a new way to prepare flank steak, and this one was loved by all!  Per other reviewers,  reduced coriander by half, and  chile paste by 2/3 (but that one's up to you!), and unintentionally marinated for 24 hours!  Delicious!  We grow our own lemon grass, and if you don't have it, try the local asian foods store.  You can sometimes find all of these ingredients in some larger groceries, including the cooking rice wine.

We all LOVED this. I didn't have lemon grass, so used lemon verbena instead and left out the mint, as I'm not a big fan of it, but it was still delicious and a nice change of pace. Thanks Karyn.

We loved this recipe, and I am sure it is so good as written, but since I didn't have all the ingredients I changed it a little bit. I used white wine instead of rice wine, canola oil instead of sesame oil, 1 tbs dried basil instead of fresh, 1 tbs dried mint instead of fresh, no lemon grass, 3 tbs of peanut butter instead of crushed peanuts, and 1 tbs of cilantro instead of coriander. Everything else I used the same as per the recipe. Make sure to marinate the steak overnight. Also, I put the steak on the grill and since I didn't want to discard the marinate, I boiled it and used it as a sauce for the steak...yummmo.

This is a great dish.  Followed the recipe but added 1 chicken breast and 1 Italian sausage so those in my family that don't really like seafood could still have it. Feedback was that it was spicy, and it was but for my sons and I that's perfect.

This took a little longer  to put together than some marinades, but I think the end result was worth it. My husband said the meat was very flavourful and tender. Marinated for about 10 hours. Thanks!

Good recipe.  I left out the rice wine for personal preference and I made a thai pesto with the remainder of the ingredients and rubbed it into the steak - I think it permeates the meat better.

I thought this marinade was not as smooth as I'd like...I think there were too many conflicting flavours for my liking...or I just don't know my thai herbs well enough...

Outstanding!!!  The aroma is wonderful.  I didn't have any coriander so I used a dash of red pepper flakes.  Grilled on the stove with a grill pan 6 minutes each side--perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious!!  The only thing I will do differently next time is go ahead and marinate overnight.  I marinated for about 8 hours and the flavor was good...but not quite as intense as I would have liked.  I subbed beer for the rice wine, and omitted the lemongrass & mint.

My family LOVED this recipe.  The only changes I made..  added fresh garlic as suggested by another review.  I didn't have fresh mint (and don't care for anyway) so, added cilantro instead.  Reallly YUM..  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent flavor!  I couldn't find lemongrass, I didn't have coriander and I only marinated it for four hours, but it was still great!  My husband loved it too.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

This marinade smelled absolutely amazing. The flavor of the meat was lacking after the steaming process. All kidding aside, I think a grilled version may be better.

It was so tasty. I marinated it for 2 days, grilled it and sliced it up for sliders at a big party.
