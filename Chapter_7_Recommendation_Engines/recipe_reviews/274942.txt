In general this is pretty much the tollhouse recipe plus orange. I did use regular shortening and gluten free all purpose flour.Due to the addition of orange juice, I needed to add more flour, I used an extra 3/4 cup. I also had to bake longer than 8-10 minutes, we baked our cookies for 13 minutes. When the cookies were done my family did like them.
