I was making two different bean recipes over Memorial weekend so I halved this one. I did cut back on the molasses as I did in the other one because we simply do not like are baked beans as sweet as most. The only fault I had in this recipe was that of my own. I bought a cheap generic bacon that ended up being mostly all fat. Although it added great flavor, the end result was white wobbly hunks of ugly nastiness so I strained it all out. Lesson learned. Out of the two recipes I made, we preferred this one. The one thing I did like better about the other one was the addition of a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.

I was  disappointed in this recipe because it does not taste like Old Fashioned baked beans. The picture shows white baked beans like my grandmother used to make, but with that much molasses they turned out to be the color of canned ones. And they tasted as such. Actually Bush's are probably better with no work involved.
