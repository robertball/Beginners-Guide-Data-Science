Added 3 cloves of garlic, sautéed half of an onion in olive oil, added a half teaspoon of herbs and served it over a bed of greens since I'm wheat/gluten and grain free right now.  Quick and easy!

i have a lot of picky eaters in my house and everyone loved this.  i also feed nine people so i tripled the recipe and there was none left.  i did use 1 jar of mild and 1 jar of medium picante sauce and then added some diced green chiles.

This was good! I did end up using 1 cup picante sauce and a can of diced tomatoes because it was a bit spicy for us. I also added a little cheese and half of an onion. I used elbow mac instead of egg noodles and just mixed it all together. Will make again.

I love this recipe. I was looking for a stroganoff recipe and saw this! I used chuck roast, mild salsa, green onions and canned mushrooms, all because that is what I had on hand. I added a little water because salsa was a little thick. This turned out great!

My family enjoyed this dish enough for me to make it again.  I omitted the mushrooms and subbed ground turkey for ground beef.  I also subbed salsa for the picante sauce since that's what I had on hand and topped the dish with shredded cheddar.  Not very stroganoff-y, but tasty nonetheless.

Delicious flavor combination with a great hint of spice! I loved this dish and I'm not a stroganoff fan.

I did what a few other suggest.  I sautéed some garlic and onions to add to the mix.  I also used a fresh salsa that I get from a Mexican grocery store.  It was a tasty dish.  Will make again.

This was good.  Didn't have mushrooms, but it didn't need it.  Use a good, flavorful salsa and you can't go wrong.

Awesome and so easy -- I ended up using leftover picante sauce from 2 24 oz. bottles, 4 oz. of greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, and ground turkey (seasoned with pepper and salt).  I definitely plan on keeping this basic recipe to use on noodles, tortillas, and perhaps some thick toast -- love the simplicity & versatility (and spice + creamy texture)!

This recipe was great! I made a huge batch for friends and they all loved it! I made my own salsa instead of using the picante but it was great either way!

Excellent! Super easy and delicious.
Use mild picante sauce for kids.
