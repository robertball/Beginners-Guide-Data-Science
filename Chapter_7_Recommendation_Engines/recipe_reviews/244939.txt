This is a great breakfast (with slight modifications)! First time I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted great but I thought maple syrup and cocoa were unnecessary if using sweetened chocolate milk. Now I also make it without vanilla extract, and cannot tell a difference. Adding just under 1 cup of milk makes it less soggy, which I prefer. So now my ideal recipe is just oats, chia seeds, unsweetened coconut shreds, and chocolate milk.
I pre-pack several snack zip locks of the dry ingredients, and take them with me on every vacation.

I made this with regular chocolate milk and didn't use cocoa powder but holy moly was it good! I added chopped frozen strawberries for extra fiber and flavor and was not disappointed. I'll be making it again this week!

I've used vanilla almond milk and whole milk instead, but everything else was the same. Even my picky kids love this breakfast! They like to warm it for a few seconds in the microwave. They need the extra calories in the AM and this does the trick and keeps them full! Thanks for sharing!

YUMMY! I really liked this. Who wouldn't like chocolate included in their breakfast? I did use vanilla soy milk and it was plenty chocolate enough. Also only had unsweetened coconut and it was plenty sweet. YUMMY!

Great overnight oats! I used regular unsweetened almond milk and added in some dark chocolate chips! It almost tastes like an Almond Joy candy bar (only way better for you!). Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe... I didn't have chocolate almond milk but it was plenty chocolate-y for me. I added Greek yogurt for extra protein and creaminess.

really yummy! I used plain, unsweetened coconut milk instead of the chocolate almond milk and I'm glad I did. It was plenty chocolatey w/o the chocolate almost milk

I took other reviewers' suggestions and used vanilla almond milk instead of the chocolate variety. The cocoa powder makes it plenty chocolatey! Delicious.I love overnight oats for breakfast.

I'm not a huge fan of cold oatmeal, but it does come in handy for a quick, hearty breakfast. So far I've only really liked a cold oatmeal that had peanut butter in it, but this is a close second. The chocolate and coconut is good, and it was very filling.
