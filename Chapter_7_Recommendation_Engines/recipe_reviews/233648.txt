The raspberry liqueur is subtle in both the dressing and the whipped topping.  I would think some raspberry extract would work well in this if you don't have the Chambord.  Didn't have any raspberries, so I substituted some green grapes, and I literally forgot the almonds (think they'd be a nice addition).  This was a great dessert on a smokin' hot  Florida day!  The summer fruits are starting to come in season, so bring on the fruit salads!!
