This was just wonderful!  We all loved it.  Here's an easy way to save time:  I made the marinade and cut up chicken for kabobs.  Then I mixed the two and froze it in a zip lock bag.  I took it out the day before and let it defrost in the fridge.  We grilled it and it was fabulous!

Fabulous marinade for chicken that definitely has an Oriental flair to it! However, I do think the proportions of soy sauce and veg. oil are a bit too much. I used 1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce and 2 Tbsp. of sesame oil. I also added a Tbsp. of rice wine vinegar. I pounded the chicken down thin and poked it with a fork. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for about 8 hours. It had a wonderful flavor and went great with a side of rice!

Excellent! I didn't have a full cup of soy sauce, so I used 1/2 c. soy and 1/2 cup teriaki. It was fantastic. A quick marinade with ingredients that are always on hand!

This was a nice quick and easy meal.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I thought the saltiness was overwelming from the soy sauce.  Next time I'll try the reduced sodium soy sauce.  Otherwise, great recipe and I'll probably make it again.

This is a wonderful marinade! I cut back a little on the oil and boiled the remaining marinade to make a sauce. I used the sauce over noodles with stirfried snow peas, garlic and red pepper. Would be a great marinade for veggies and pork. Delicious!

Came out salty due to I left it to marinate more than 24 hours. Came out flavorful, will probably cut the soy sauce in 1/2 next time or use a light soy sauce.

I couldn't believe how many times people complimented me on this recipe.  I did marinade it for 24 hrs in the refrigerator and I used coconut oil instead of vegitable oil.  Everyone loved it...even me and I'm pretty picky!

This is something very like another recipe I have and although this was good I do prefer it with 1 inch ginger and the juice of 1/2-1 lemon (dependant on your taste).  Although you are quite correct the sherry does add a further dimension to it.

We found this to be very boring.  Not enough seasonings to accent the soy/oil.

Pretty good, fast marinade!  To prevent so much waste, I used 1/2 cup soy sauce and about 1/4 cup olive oil.  I kept the other ingredients the same.

This is a great recipe, but I used only 2 T of oil instead of 1/2 cup to cut back on fat. I also added 1 T shredded gingerroot to give it some punch.

Superb! Thank You!  Gourmet asian styled. Grilled on my George Foreman Grill. Very Juicy and wonderfully flavored.  Grateful for your sharing of this recipe. I made it twice in one week. A great alternative to boring everyday chicken!! Will make very often. Need to find a good chinese noodle recipe now to go with it.  Fabulous!

Delicious! I wasn't able to grill on an outdoor grill so did it on the stovetop, but the flavors came out wonderfully. Definitely let it caramalize on both sides so you get the full effects.

Ok, first, this chicken was unbelievably moist, my husband accused me of under cooking it. I did not do any substitutions but I did add 2 Tbsp. of sherry instead of 1 Tbsp. And I used bone in breast chicken. (OOPs I guess thats a subtitution) I grilled the chicken on our gas grill served it with a big green delicious salad. As for the taste, I honestly found it a bit flavorless on the inside, the outside had a wee bit of asian taste. We ended up pouring BBQ sauce on it after we took it off the grill. If you like a light marinade taste then this is it for you. Thus if I could I would give it 5 stars for being so moist but 3 stars for taste. Maybe this is a good starter for more spices, I will try this again. Thanks

This made the moistest grilled chicken I have ever had.  The sauce can definitely be boiled and used as dip.

Chicken Marinade Haiku; "This was pretty good! I added ginger powder, for that 'Asian flair.'" I followed the recipe as written, only adding a 1/4 tsp. ginger powder, and broiling instead of grilling (ran out of gas in the grill - doh!) It was a tender, tasty chicken, but just shy of being as amazing as AR's "Pretty Chicken Marinade." Happy to try something new though!

This marinade is awesome!  I add ginger and scallions as well and the meat turns out amazing every time.  This is a party favorite.  Everyone always asks what I did to make the meat taste so good.  Also good for pork.  Try skewering the meat then bbq...very yummy!

This was an easy recipe and it tasted great!  I doubled the garlic and let the chicken marinate overnight.  As noted by others, I boiled the marinade and served it over rice.  Yum!

great recipe, very simple when you need a nice meal after work. I made it the day before but did cut the soy sauce in half. I also added a little smoke, sesame oil, mustard powder, and paprika which gave it that little something that was missing.

Out of this world flavor (the sherry made all the difference -- I'll look into using it in recipes more), the chicken turned out moist and succulent, and was so good...we were glad we made enough so we'd have leftovers the next day. This is so far my favorite recipe I've found on the site; it will definitely become part of our regular dinner rotation because it's so ridiculously easy.

Considering there is so much soy sauce in this marinade, it wasn't overly salty at all.  We both really enjoyed this marinade.  I let the chicken sit in it for 24 hours, then grilled it outside.  Perfection!

This is a great recipe that all my guests raved about.  Prep is very easy.
I did make the mistake of trying to marinade it for 24+ hours and although it was very tasty it absorbed a lot of the salt from the soya sauce. Either go with the recommended 4 hour marinading time or try sodium free soya.  All in all - this is now my favorite chicken recipe.

This is the first marinade I used on chicken breast that actually held a ton of flavor!! It's hard to find a marinade that really penetrates the breast. I loved it and so did my family!

This was an excellent recipe! I froze the chicken in the marinade then used it later on the grill..Although the chicken was discolored by the marinade, the taste was wonderful! Thanks! I'll keep this one around for a long time to come!

Very good.  My husband thought a little bit too saltly, so maybe cut back a little on the soy sauce.

Love this marinade!  I used it to marinate chicken for a grilled Oriental chicken salad.  The chicken was so moist and good that it almost didn't make it into the salad.  I'll be using this recipe often.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe. It was easy and tasted great. I did modify it a little. I used 1/4 cup of oill instead of 1/2 cup. I will use this recipe time and time again!

This is an excellent marinade. I was looking for a marinade to use on some thin-sliced chicken breast on BBQ-ed bamboo skewers as my kids (13 & 15) like to eat from that. It worked out very well, but it worked best on the thicker pieces, as the thin ones were too dry. Look forward to using regular thickness chicken breast as kabobs on a skewer with peppers and such. Will also try on skirt steak on a skewer.

Everyone just loved this recipe.  I did not have enough low salt soya so I had to use 1/2 cup soya then added 1/2 cup low salt teriyaki sauce.  I have found that there was lots of marinade to do double the meat as a result I was able to marinade 6 chicken legs and 2 breast halves.  LOL this is for 4 people.  Loved so much nothing was left over.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I marinated chicken thighs for several hours then threw them on the grill. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder instead. My husband said it was the best chicken he had ever had! Very good marinade!

Really enjoyed the simplicity of this marinade.  The sherry made it just slightly different.  I only had about an hour or so to marinade, and used thin sliced chicken breasts that we grilled.  Can't wait to try it again with thicker chicken breasts and longer marinating time.   Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent results.  I actually ended up spilling a bit of the marinade when putting the chicken but it ended up being fine.  I let mine sit for about 18 hours and they were great.  This is pretty much teriyaki but its  good.

Yes, yes - I made changes: first, I tripled the recipe using chicken quarters; I didn't have enough soy sauce to go around so I used about 1/4 cup LITE soy sauce and the rest teriyaki. My BF does not like sweet chicken, so I cut the brown sugar down to one Tbspn. It was really perfection on the barbecue. ~UPDATE~ Made it again for chicken cutlets - used my new instant marinator and grilled on my Foreman - perfection!

If I could do 4 1/2 I would!  I tweaked this some.  I used 3/4 cup of soy.  I added 1/2 a large jalepeno minced.  I didn't have sherry (which I would have used), but added red wine.  It was great!!!  Moist and delicious.  My h said he hit a couple of salty spots, but he loved it too.  AND most importantly, my girls loved it!! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe!!!  It tastes like it was prepared by a top restaurant.  For those who said it was too salty, I'm guessing they didn't use Kikkoman brand soy sauce.  If that's the case, try again using Kikkoman.  It's far superior and much, much less salty/tangy tasting.

Decided on this marinade because we had all the ingredients. Decreased the oil to 1/4 cup to decrease the calories/fat. Also added 1T grated ginger, 1t sirarcha  and 1T sesame oil to increase the Asian flavor. Everyone in my family loved it.

This is easy and delicious. Because of the soy sauce, I did not need to salt the chicken when it was time to eat.

Very salty.  I doubled the garlic and added 1/4 cup sherry for additional flavor, and even with those changes it's still lacking.  It grilled up wonderfully compared to a lot of marinades, but unfortunately I won't be making this one again.

Excellent marinade! I had to make a few adjustments to what I had in the house. I didn't have any sherry but used red wine vinegar instead. And I only had 1/2 cup of soy sauce so I added a 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce. I marinated the breasts while they were thawing for about 6 hours. It's a keeper!

Positively outstanding!--I pierce my chicken breasts thoroughly (I use a Jaccard for this.......saves time and helps to flatten the meat a bit, as well) and then seal in a Foodsaver marinading dish to speed-up the process so I only need to leave the chicken in the marinade for about two hours and then grill either outdoors or on a countertop grill in the kitchen--  The resulting chicken breasts are delicious on their own or cut into pieces and added to pasta or vegetable salads--This marinade has become an absolute staple in my kitchen--C

This was amazing!  I only marinated the chicken for 1 hour but it still was nice and juicy.  I added montreal chicken seasoning for extra flare and all my friends loved it.  Great sides are grilled veggies in garlic and olive oil (green pepper, red pepper, onion, new red potatoes) and macaroni and cheese (I mixed kraft and velveeta together, yum!).  I recommend par boiling the potatoes for 15 minutes and cooling for 15 min before putting them in the grill basket.  This ones a keeper, enjoy!

Have made this several times and always get compliments.  I use Kikkoman Less Sodium soy sauce, and add a "grind" of black pepper and a pinch of cayenne.  It isn't necessary to marinate the 4 hrs.
Great the next day!!!

I'm sorry to say that I was very disappointed in this recipe. It was way too salty, even though I used 3/4 cup soy sauce rather than 1 cup.  Other than that I kept all the other ingredients the same.

Simple marinade, but a great burst of flavor.  We BBQed the chicken breasts, then sliced them over salad greens.  Leftovers were good too.

We were looking for a new chicken marinade recipe.  This is now our go-to preference at least once a week.  About 12 minutes in an air fryer makes for perfect quick and easy teriyaki chicken meal.

Good and easy to make with ingredients that are staples at my house.  We did not have a grill, so we put it in the rotisserie.  I think I would probably prefer this on chicken with a skin, but as far as a marinade, it's great.  Will definitely make this marinade again.

Per someone’s suggestion, I substituted cognac for the sherry and used low sodium soy sauce. Also added half a tablespoon of Chinese 5 spices and a tablespoon of red miso paste. Turned out great.  My 7-year-old and 5-year-old and wife all tore it up!

Pretty good. Could use a little less soy sauce with the chicken. I like this better on salmon.

This chicken was perfect so tender you could cut with a fork. I half the recipe for 2 people added a little honey for part of the brown sugar cooked on grill 8 minutes each side.

Really good! Not overpowering but gives the chicken a great flavour. I can think of all kinds of different ways to utilize the marinade. It reminds me just a bit of the wings served at the Golden Wok near my home.

This is a great, family-friendly recipe.  I only had 1/2 cup of soy sauce left, so I used that with close to the full amount of oil.  The taste was fine this way (and I always use reduced-sodium soy sauce), but I noticed some people said they boiled the marinade for a sauce -- I tried to do this, but my oil ratio was too high to be successful.  I also only was able to marinate for 1-1/2 hours, but it was still flavorful enough (used thin-slice chicken breasts).  Next time I will probably use the stated amounts for soy sauce and oil, and try to marinate for longer.  I may also use olive oil next time.

This is a great recipe! Really easy to make. It is also easy to substitute and add ingredients.  I added chopped pecans the first time I made it. The second time I substituted half of a banana with chopped frozen pineapple and shredded coconut. I want to try mango the next time.

Good overall marinade, however it seems to basically be a Teriyaki Sauce/marinade.  I wouldn't change anything about this, if making Teriyaki Chicken.  Although not everyone enjoys the flavor of Sherry, I personally love it!  Thank you Margie12.

This was delicious! Chicken was very flavorful. I only made two chicken breasts so I halved the recipe. Only had a little under 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce so used all i had and added half a tablespoon extra wine (I used yellow tail shiraz). Delicious!

Great grilling marinade! I didn't have any cooking sherry, so I substituted a couple shots of good single-malt Scotch whisky. It was delicious. This is now my go-to recipe for grilled chicken.

I halved the soy sauce and veg oil like others suggested, plus I added an extra 1/2 T of sherry (I used cream sherry) and a 1/4 tsp of ground ginger. Marinated 10 hours before grilling. The color and smell were wonderful. The taste was okay but not very strong. I'd consider modifying it but would probably just go with a different recipe next time.

This marinade did the trick for a couple of chicken breasts used in the Cobb salad recipe.  A quick grill, then cubed for the salad, and it added a new dimension to an already good recipe.

Wonderful! My very picky 12yr old likes this. I don't like making changes and then rating recipes, but all I did was reduce the soy sauce and oil. You just can't go wrong with this.

This is an awesome marinade for chicken or steak the key is to marinade in the frig, the longer the better. I use 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup KC Masterpiece Honey Teriyaki Marinade and omitted the garlic cloves and the vegetable oil . I use this recipe at least once a week is is great.

Only ok.  I thought the soy sauce was a little overpowering.  Next time I will halve the soy sauce and add something else.

This was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly and marinated it for 4-5 hours; Put on a hot grill and cooked through. I served it wit a baked potato and fresh corn on the cob...and my husband raved. It is going on the regular/often dinner menu and I think I'll use this marinade for steaks too. I was afraid it might not go well with the potato and corn (might taste too Asian for those sides) but it tasted like good 'ol chicken hot off the grill...kind of mesquite, actually.

So good and easy...used several times.  Use about 1/2 oil and marinate for 6+ hours.   Cognac is nice too.

Great marinade and a great way to spice up just regular old chicken breasts!  I let the chicken marinate overnight, though, and it did come out a bit on the salty side.  So, if you're planning on letting your chicken soak overnight, I would suggest that you cut back a little on the soy sauce.

Okay, so I forgot to add the garlic to the marinade, lol.  I did put in some garlic powder last minute.  The marinade was absolutely delicious on some chicken thighs that I baked in the oven.

This recipe was so easy and very tasty.  I've made it a few times when I know it's going to be a long day and wont want to cook when I get home.  The chicken does take longer on the grill than the recipe says.

I'm not sure I enjoyed this one as much as another chicken marinade recipe I've found at allrecipes, but it is still excellent. As usual, we grilled it outdoors with grilled onions, green peppers, and asparagus, brushed with kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. The tang was palpable and very good, despite marinading time of only two hours.

I reduced the sauce and poured it over at the end.
Perfect with vegetables as a side.

ViellesVignes, Huh?

Ever pick up a bottle of French wine and wonder what varietal it is? This was the case for me when I picked a bottle of Schoffit, Chassselas, and Vieilles Vignes 2005.  This wine has aromas of ripe apple and pear, the palate is medium with a gentle finish. It paired ever so nicely with the BBQ chicken marinade. Because I added a dark chili powder to the recipe, I thought this wine would go perfectly (and it did!). On the side I served seasoned and broiled (makes um crunchy)red potatoes a skewer of sumptuous summer veggies.

I wasn't crazy about this marinade. It was a little harsh for my taste and I don't think I would ever be inspired to make it again. Not sure what would make it better. Perhaps diluting the soy sauce, or using a "lite/less sodium" version. Could have been a little sweeter as well.

It wasn't horrible, but not very good. My husband wanted to try it and thought it was OK, so 3 stars. I want something more than a soy sauce marinade, and this wasn't it.

Good grilled chicken.  I used 3/4 cup light soy sauce and added about 3 Tbsp of lemon juice and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Very tasty, although I think it would be more flavorful if marinated overnight.

I followed the recipe and marinated about 4 hours.  It produced an edible chicken, but a salty soy flavor.  The sherry did not impart flavor at all.  The recipe might improve with low sodium soy and an adjustment of soy to sherry ratio.

Pretty good! My DH liked it very much - I cut the chicken breasts into slivers, used dark and light soy sauce and added a dash of oyster sauce. I also used red cooking wine instead of sherry cuz I didn't have any sherry. I also pan fried it instead of grilling. DH loved it and requests for it frequently.

This marinade is alright.  Might be better if it marinated longer - only marinated it for about 8 hours.  Also, I didn't have fresh garlic so I used jar garlic.  Maybe that makes a difference.

I followed this recipe to the letter, but this marinade just didn't produce a flavor I enjoyed. My family ate it, but I don't think anyone was overly impressed. I wouldn't use this marinade again for my chicken. Just personal preference.

Chicken was juicy and delicious.  I let it marinade overnight and poked the chicken with a fork so the marinade really took hold.  Had it on Labor Day on the Grill with grilled asparagus, fried onion and potato dish as a side and it was a perfect combo of flavor.

This was good, it was just way too salty. Next time I'll follow another reviewer's advice and use reduced-sodium soy sauce.

We enjoyed the light flavor - as we marinated the chicken for under two hours.  The chicken was very moist after grilling and was a pleasant surprise.

Let marinate overnight, with made for really great flavour that went all the way through the chicken. Nice summer time recipe :)
