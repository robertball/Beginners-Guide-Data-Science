This is delicious thank you! I wasn't sure if I should be using plantains or regular bananas so I went with what I had....regular bananas. We like to grill/broil whatever veggies we have on hand and eat them over rice. Last night is was basmati rice. We put this sauce over it all and it was a huge hit. My 4-year old loved it as well. I sprinkled cayenne pepper over mine to add some heat. I loved the balance of tartness from the rice wine vinegar and sweetness from the bananas and honey too.

Excellent Sauce with Chicken I shredded the chicken and would have liked it better in chunks. Also added some sugar snap peas and served over rice. My 5 year old ate it but not the most willingly. My husband liked it over rice but I preferred mine solo and added some crushed red pepper to mine for some zing. Will make again.

The end product was delicious but the serving size was way off. There wasn't even quite enough to feed three of us. Also a whole bunch of it burned to the bottom of the skillet for some reason and refuses to come off no matter how long I soak it. That might be because my skillet is glass and doesn't distribute heat well.

This was actually very good! we tripled the recipe for 3 people and had leftover sauce. We also added some cayenne for kick and I'm glad we did because it was pretty sweet before. But the finished taste was great. We served with sauteed veggies (green beans yellow bell and eggplant) and a white fish steak. This was verrrry tasty.

Very good stuff! I used agave nectar instead of honey chives instead of shallots (what I had on hand) and added frozen green peas (for veggie power) and chopped cashews (for texture). I really didn't love it quite like 5 stars but since I made changes on the first try I can't down-rate a recipe that I didn't follow. I added it to Costco rotisserie chicken that I cut up and simmered together for 30 mins on low. Then laddled over basmati rice. In the future I will add add either red pepper or Jalepeno to give it some kick. The family enjoyed the dish very much.

Only missing a star because I believe the amounts of garlic and curry power are half what they should be PS use water instead of 'low sodium chicken broth' its better for you.
