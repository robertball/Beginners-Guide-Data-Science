Hi, I'm the original recipe submitter. I wanted to make some suggestions as far as cooking the potatoes. I see that someone had some undercooked ones. The 4 minute time I gave is figurative. It really depends on your microwave. Most newer models have a button to push for potatoes, which will cook them to sufficient doneness. If yours does not, it may take several minutes to cook the potatoes through. Just MAKE SURE you poke them full of holes (to avoid a MESSY microwave) and turn them after atleast 4 minutes, if your microwave does not have a turntable. Other than that, I'm glad you all enjoy the potatoes!

The method here is what's so GREAT! I had surgery on my hand, couldn't use a potatoe peeler, a knife or even the" boil and then skin" potatoe method. So, I just microwave, cut in half, scoop out and mash. Great method for any kind of mashed or slightly mashed potatoe recipe.Have even used it for Pot Salad, with different ingredients of course. Thanks.

4 minutes was not enough time and unfortunately the skins really don't crisp in the microwave but the filling can be placed in a casserole dish instead and it's delicious that way. we don't eat sour cream in our house so we substituted greek yogurt and left out the green onions and processed cheese. Mash it with a fork and throw it back in at the end for two minutes with some bacon bits and cheese on top. All in all, good recipe to fiddle with.

The flavor was okay, but the recipe was difficult overall.  I cooked the potatoes a full 10 minutes and still they were too hard.  There were parts of them still a bit raw and the mixture was not at all smooth.  It was full of bumps.  Next time I would just boil potatoes (just like making mashed) and add these ingredient to them.

Finally an easy way to do twice baked! Used a dab of yogurt since I was out of sour cream.

Not a bad standby recipe.  I prefere Ultimate Twice Baked Potatoes from this site, though.  I'll make again when in a pinch.

this turned out pretty good and easy too.  the potatoes I used were smaller so they turned out to be more of an appetizer.  Very tasty!

This was super easy to make and just as good as if it came from the oven. I sprinkled a little cheese in the empty potato skin, then added the mixture, for an added delight.
