I made this for a holiday party.  It was a big hit.  I made an ice ring before hand in my bundt pan, and added orange slices (cut really thin with peel on) and berries.  As the ring melted down, the oranges and berries added a wonderful touch to the punch.

This excellent recipe received rave notices from guests ranging from 26 years old to something over 60.  It's delicious and easy to make.  But be careful - it'll sneak up on you if you drink too much.

Absolutely fantastic!!  It goes down easy and packs a punch.  VERY popular at our Christmas Eve party.  Many people asked what was in the punch.  This is a keeper!!

Made for New Year's Day party. No rave reviews, but was enjoyed by some. Wish I'd added the pineapple juice suggested by someone else. Just didn't taste like a party punch to me.

Made this for the first time Christmas Eve and it was a big hit.  I was worried it would be too sweet with a whole cup of sugar and started with less, but after a taste test felt that it needed a whole cup.  We also liked the punchy taste non-pulp OJ & pineapple added (about 2 cups worth).  I only had cherry brandy on hand and it worked well.  I plan to make this again for New Years Eve!

Simple and delicious!  A BIG hit with the family.  I put pomegranate seeds in mine and used a large ice lantern mold to make smaller star shaped ice to float inside.  Beautiful

The original recipe was not sweet enough for "punch" in my opinion.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added pineapple juice.  I also added a bit more sugar and some orange juice, and added frozen pineapple juice "ice cubes" that I made in my muffin tins.  These additions resulted in a fruity, sweet holiday punch.  This is a very flavorful punch base with just the right amount of alcohol, though.

This one's a keeper.  I've made this punch for four years in a row, and I'm still getting requests for it.  My husband loves it, and normally he won't touch any drink that isn't either white wine or made with rum.  The only tweak I would recommend is if you use an ice ring or block, reduce the club soda by about a quarter to a half --otherwise the punch gets really watered down and tasteless.

I've made this punch three years now for my holiday party, and it always runs out before everything else. It's quite tasty, and open to lots of variations. You can add fruit if you like, to make it more like a sangria.   I will say that the reviewer who warned that it "sneaks up on you" is right. It tastes great and has little of the alcoholic bite you would expect, given the ingredients. So watch how much you have, or you'll be in for one rockin' hangover.

Very good punch. I did use a liter of lemon lime soda instead of club soda. Less potent but still tasty. Froze an ice block with sliced oranges and this was a perfect way to keep it cold and add some flair.

I used this punch recipe at my Christmas party last year and everyone loved it!  I omitted the sugar and used asti spumante for the sweetness instead.  I've already had several requests to serve it again at this years party!

I made this last night for a Christmas party and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it. It is very light and smooth tasting. I will definately make this again.
