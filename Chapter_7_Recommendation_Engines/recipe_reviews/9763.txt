LOVED these cookie Bars!  I did add 1 egg.  While I was mixing the sugar and butter it was just too thick and was not whipping up like I thought it should.  1 egg did the trick!  They came out PERFECT!  I also pressed them in a 10x13 glass baking dish since I did not have a jelly roll pan.

The first time I made these I added an egg and baking soda, but they still turned out dry and flavourless. Now I have PERFECTED this recipe. I added an egg, 1 tablespoon of milk, an extra bit of vanilla, and 1/4 cup of white sugar. Also, be SURE to sift the flour. I also used a mixture of peanut butter & chocolate chips for added flavour! The second time they turned out AMAZING!

SO quick to make, not many ingredients, and turned out the best bar cookie I've made.  I used a 13by9 by 2 glass pan, and cooked it at 325.  They come out soft, creamy, and chocolatey!  What more can you ask for!!

These were so good.I also added 2 eggs but on top of that I also added 3/4 teaspoon baking soda & powder. They were so easy to cute. Fast and easy to make you can make two batches out of one bag of chocolate chips. You have to try it

Delicious! I definitely plan to make these again. I used a glass 9x13 pan and baked at 325 degrees for a little longer than specified.

I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and added 2 eggs prior to adding the dry ingredients.  Also, since I do not have a 15x10 inch pan I used my 9x13 pyrex instead.  I increased the oven to 375 degrees and baked the mix for 27 minutes.  The cookies/bars are great.  I would suggest to all future persons trying this recipe to add the eggs, otherwise I don't see how their would be enough moisture in the mix.

I'm giving this four stars because I liked the fact that I was low on ingredients yet I was able to make these.  I had everything it called for.  It did however lack some flavor and were a little dry.  I added one egg as suggested by a user.  I used mini chocolate chips and those worked well in the bars.  It just needed something else.  My kids loved making them and were happy so that's what counts!!

I made them once for my class and they LOVED them. Then I made them for a cook out and they where gone in a flash. The only thing is that I would make a double batch because there is not much. ALL IN ALL THEY WHERE AMAZING!!!!!!

Before making this recipe, I read all of the reviews, which I'm glad I did!  I added 1 T milk, 1 egg, 3/4 tsp. baking soda, and a 1/4 c white sugar.  Instead of using chopped pecans, I used a combination of chocolate and peanut butter chips.  The bars came out great!  I would recommend lining your pan with aluminum foil.  I lifted the uncut bars out of the pan with the foil and then cut with a pizza cutter.

READ THIS ONE!! I followed the advice of a couple of other users and added two eggs to the dough.  When I tried these fresh from the oven, I was disappointed.  They lacked the Tollhouse taste I am so fond of.  HOWEVER!!!! Once they have had time to settle, they taste much better.  When I served them that evening, they were fab! My advice is to let them rest :-)

I made these last night, following the advice of one of the reviewers to add two eggs, 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, 3/4 tsp of baking soda and baking powder. Using that method, they came out light and fluffy, almost cake-like. They taste great!  Definitely sift the flour first! Instead of a jelly roll pan, I put the batter in a glass 13x9 pan and baked at 325' for 25 to 30 min.    A great recipe overall, and worth experimenting with for different flavors.

These are really easy and yummy!  i followed the recipe the way it is, save using a glass 9x13 pan and changing the temp to 325 degrees for just a bit longer.  No eggs means those with egg allergies can eat the dough! ;)  Very good, thank you for sharing!!!

I didn't like it, neither did my grandchildren.  Without any baking soda, they are extremely flat and doughy.  Just not to our taste.

Followed this recipe to the T.. (with the exception of taking the advice of a review and adding 1 egg) and they were not baked in 20mins...not even close. More like cake than cookie...

I have a very small oven so always looking for bar recipes, but this one was impossible to press into the pan. Full of holes where there should be dough.

I liked the original version of the recipe - the shortbread texture was tasty.  I decided to change it a bit the 2nd time around, and added 1 egg and 1.5 teaspoon vanilla and 1.5 teaspoon orange oil, and used milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet. It was a very good combination, and the texture was a little softer (no crumbling at all).   This is a versatile recipe - definitely worth trying and easily altered to one's taste.  Thanks!

Made a double batch to send to grandchildren at college.  I followed the recipe as given and they were delicious.  I think this recipe is underrated and deserves more stars.

I give this recipe 5 stars only because of what was added to it that made it turn out so well. Otherwise, I can't imagine how they would turn out.

I first viewed this recipe and wondered how it could possibly turn out with the lack of key ingredients. Just before I started to make it, I read the reviews, and am I sure glad I did! I combined suggestions from a few other great reviews and the bars came out wonderful! To the ingredients listed above, I added: another teaspoon of vanilla, 2 eggs, 3/4 tsp. baking soda, 3/4 tsp. baking powder, and 1/4-1/2 cup sugar. 

I made sure not to over bake. My husband took them to his work for "treat day" and they got rave reviews. I made them the next day for a trip north, and they were polished off in no time. :)

followed the recipe as written, but cooked them at 325 for 28 minutes instead of at 350. These are yummy yummy yummy, if you let them rest and cool on the rack before cutting into bars. They were gone the same night! added butterscotch and peanut butter chips with the chocolate and pecans! LOVE!!

great with some changes. add to recipe 1 extra t vanilla, 2 eggs, 1/2 t salt, 3/4 t each baking soda & baking powder, 1/4 c sugar (in addition to the 1 c brown sugar). Instead of 1 c choc chips, I used 1/2 c peanut butter chips and 1/2 c choc chips, baked in greased 9X13 325 20 minutes moist and good, try it!

I Loved the recipe, very simple. The cookies were a little thin and I burnt the bottom, but I am sure that was just my fault, because your cookies look delicious!

These are delicious!  I made them as directed except that I added a cup of peanut butter to the mix and I added a half teaspoon of butter flavoring in addition to the teaspoon of vanilla.  They tasted very good when they came out of the oven but fell all apart :( and I thought I was either going to have to throw them away or find some use for a whole pan of chocolate chip crumbles.  However, a few hours later, they had set up and were fabulous. :)  I find the taste a little reminiscent of magic cookie bars without the coconut.  They are very buttery and yummy.  I am making them again tonight! :)

Pretty darn good.  :)  I did add an egg did half butter and half butter flavor shortning,and omitted the nuts (allergy).  It is kinda like shortbread with chocolate.  I also used about 1.5 C . of mini chocolate chips, baked in a 9x13 for about 24 minutes at 350.  Will make again- very easy.

This was a decent recipe, but I had to add an egg and a pinch of baking soda.  They came out more cake-like, but I think that may have been me mixing it too much.

I was a little worried about not having an egg in the end I wasn't to fond of the recipe. I followed the recipe extactly except I used 1/2 cup splenda brown sugar instead of the cup of regular sugar. This one didn't have a very good after taste.

These seem a little greasy and a little low on flavor even with additions. The batter was really dry, so I did add an egg and a TBSP of milk as another suggested. I also added another teaspoon of vanilla. Not sure what else they need, something though. I baked in 11 X 13 pan for about 25 minutes at 350. Nice consistency- like a bar should be.

These were a hit. Eventhough I hate it when people change the recipes when reviewing them (then you're not reviewing the same recipe!) I did make a couple of changes.lol. I added an egg because it did look a little dry and crumbly, and I used half white half brown sugar. They came out moist with a great buttery taste.

It's my fault that this turned out hard as a rock. I used about 3/4 cups of butter melted.For the chocolate chips, instead I used about 6 hershey's kisses melted. i also used 1/2 tsp meringue. oh and I shaped them into cookies. I still don't know what I did wrong;)

I was very disappointed in baking this cookie because it was very dry and did not have enough flavor. My fiancee was eager to eat it and when he had one bite he lost his appetite.

these were ok.

as suggested, i added 1/4 cup peanut butter, about 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 egg to prevent dryness. There wasn't enough dough to fill the pan, so i transferred it to a 8x8 square pan. it took a little over 40 min. to bake!!

in attempts to add flavor, i dipped the tops in melted peanut butter chips and melted choco. chips. I would not eat them if i hadn't dipped them.

perhaps my adjustments changed the recipe's flavor, but i will not be making these again. They were pretty good though.
Thanks 
CHRISTCOOKS

I had planned to make this recipe and then got a little nervous when I read the reviews. But I had good results when I added one egg and 1/4 cup peanut butter. I then spread it in a 11 x 9 pan and baked at 325 for longer than the original. The bars are about 1 inch thick, and are moist and chewy--cookie-like--not sticky.

These worked out great for me!  I am making  cookies for my 3 little valentines, and decided to make these into heart shaped cut out cookies.  I absolutely loved the fact that there is no egg in these, as my #3 valentine is allergic, (I left out the pecans, as he is allergic to those as well) actually he is enjoying one as I type.  Thanks Gary, for sharing.  Happy Valentines Day ;)

This recipe IS quick and easy, but it tastes AWFUL!  The cookies were dry,even though I had cut the baking time to 18 minutes.  Perhaps the lack of eggs in the recipe had something to do with it.

Tasted alright but very dry. After mixing the ingredients I couldn't figure out why the batter was soooo dry! There aren't any eggs in this recipe! It tasted and had the consistency more like shortbread.

I added a little bit of milk instead of eggs because I did not have any eggs!  It turned out good, but was a little crumbly.  Could have been from the milk.  I'm not sure.  I also used a 9x13 as well like others said.

This is the best, easiest cookie recipe ever.  They taste like a chocolate chip shortbread cookie.  And because you make them as bars they are sooooo easy.  Don't overbake they are best just slightly browned.

There's nothing "wrong" with this recipe, but prepared as-is it's extremely dry and crumbly, more like shortbread. Which is fine, I like shortbread. But if you're looking for a chocolate chip cookie-like bar, this is not really the recipe for you.

These just didn't work. I added two eggs and baked these in a 13x9 pan at 375 degrees for 27 minutes like another reviewer suggested. They were very bland and I didn't care for the texture at all.

A lot of reviews for this recipe were saying that the bars were dry and crumbly, but It is like a shortbread bar.  I used chopped up milk chocolate, white chocolate and dark chocolate for a three-in-one chocolatey bar.  I also used two 5 by 6 1/2 pans and one of them were black.  The black one cooked faster than the silver one (18 min. instead of 20) but were just as good.  I will definitely be baking these again!

I hadn't read the comments before making these, but I did add an egg because I was just too nervous to do a cookie without one!  They maybe could use a little more sugar, but if you think of them as a cross between SHORTBREAD and chocolate chip cookies, then these are pretty decent.  While they were cooking they smelled like shortbread, and they do have more of that consistency.  So don't make these if you think you want real choc chip cookies.  However, they're very easy to make, so it's great for a quick treat.

I think this was a good recipe!  A little dry and a little too rich for me personally but I can promise you there were no complaints at my house and I would definitely use it again.  I actually think this would be delicious with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe was very good. My boyfriend doesn't like cake but likes cookies and this was the perfect alternative. Everyone at the party loved them, I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla.

These were AWEFUL!!! They turned out VERY dry, and tasteless. Maybe if I had added an egg to them they might have turned out better.

I don't think we'll try these again. They were kind of bland and 
the bottoms turned out greasy and the tops were rather dry.

I was snowed in one night and was excited to find this recipe as I was out of eggs but craving chocolate chip cookies. I tried it, no problem with dryness or consistency like other reviewers. They looked delicious going into the oven, but the finished product was not. They tasted terrible...way too sweet and not in a good way. It tasted just like eating a mouthful of brown sugar. Such a disappointment.

Pretty decent!  I didn't change the recipe at all but may next time.  They're not dry, but they did taste a little "floury".

I decided to take the advise of previous reviews and add 2 eggs.  I was unhappy with the results.  I expected it to have a cookie or a brownie consistancy but the 2 eggs made it taste like a chocolate chip cake!  If thats what you want then it taste fine but it just was not what I expected.

Excellent!  I did add one egg; 1 tsp baking soda; 1 tsp baking powder; and approx. 1/2 to 3/4 cup of quick oatmeal.  So easy to make and cooked very evenly.  I can't wait until my teenagers come home and try them!

I liked this bar. Of course, it was not as good as a regular chocolate chip cookie, but it had a nice shortbread quality that I enjoyed for a change, but would not want all the time. For the best shortbread taste you'd use all butter of course, but to save money I used half butter, half shortening and it still was nice and buttery. What I really appreciated about this recipe was the fact that it is egg-free, as my toddler son is allergic to egg. He enjoyed this recipe.

This is honestly the best bar cookie I've ever made!!  Followed the recipe exacxtly (with the addition of a little more salt) and they were wonderful!  They taste like a chocolate chip shortbread.  I did not fill the 15x10 completely...so may be keeping these a little thicker was the key.  They looked a little underdone when I pulled them out of the over...but let them sit there to cool and they set up perfectly!!  A new favorite!

I've tried many differant recipes for Choc Chips Cookie Bars, and so far these have been my favorite. (The only change I made in the recipe was using freshly ground wheat flour). Thank you for the great recipe!

I added 1 egg and 3/4 tsp. baking soda and 3/4 tsp. baking powder.  These additions make this perfect.  I cooked it in a 13 by 8 pan.  Everyone loved them.  You have to add the extra ingredients though.  It made them soft

I added an egg and some Silk Pumpkin Spice Soy Milk after the batter was basically completely dry.  They turned out pretty good!  Worked well as snacks on the run between classes and such (even though they aren't very healthy, hahaha).  I'll make them again; they're easy! ;)

I did not follow the recipe to the T, here is what I did. I added 2 1/2 tbls vanilla, 1/8 cup more brown sugar, and 1 cup raisins. I did not add the nuts. Baked it in a 8x11.5x2 in. glass pan. I baked them a little longer than suggested. Until the top was light brown. About 30 min. I sprayed pan with Pam and they came out moist. Husband and kids enjoyed it. This is great if you can't have eggs!

Easy to make, but quite tasteless.  I think that if the recipe needs to be "tweeked" so much to make it edible, than perhaps a 1 star rating is what it deserves.  I was mislead by the 3 star rating, for sure!

Mixture was dry and seemed to be missing something so I added 2 eggs. Used a smaller pan as well. Bars were OK.

My daughter made this for a foods class assignment and it wasn't very good.  Like the others have posted, it was bland and dry.  I kept having her double check the recipe as I felt it had to be missing an egg or something...Don't think we will be making it again.  I also agree the mixture was very thin in the pan...

After reading the reviews I decided to tweek the recipe a little. I added 1 egg, 2 tsps vanilla, 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup oats and omitted the nuts. Put it in a glass 12x9 pan and cooked it at 325 for 25 minutes.

Fast, easy, and yummy! This is, by far, the best chocolate chip bar cookie recipe I've found. It's not cake-like, more of a cookie. I might never make the drop cookies again! Thanks for sharing this one!

I found that these bars were just an easy way out of making your standard chocolate chip cookie. They were hard and baked unevenly. And I found that they did not have much flavor.

I did as other reviewers suggested. Oven at 375, used a 9"x13" pan, added 2 eggs to the butter mixture, 1 ts salt, 3/4 ts each of baking powder and baking soda to the flour and baked for 27 minutes. They were good and very easy.

Like others, I added an egg.  22 minutes cooking time. Edges were crisp but center soft.

Used a 10x17 jelly roll pan, but it was too big. Would use 9x13 glass pan for next batch.

I added two eggs and a 1/4 half and half to get the right consistency. Increased the baking time to 30 minutes.

I found this recipe because I was out of eggs and wanted choc. chip cookies.  I added white sugar to the mixture, well, because it seemed like I should.  So, these had the general choc. chip cookie taste, but it just didnt seem right.   Wont make again.

Followed the recipe exactly except only baked for 15 minutes.While not terribly dry, they tasted a bit like burnt butter.  Some people love that but I prefer a traditional cookie taste.  Also, very dense since there was no baking soda.

Love this recipe...so easy and tastes great. I also make it with white sugar instead of brown sugar for a shortbread type cookie bar... crunchy and sweet!  Batter will be crumbly and should be pressed into the pan. Be sure the butter is softened and creamed well with the sugar.

I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and added 2 eggs. I baked it in a 9x13 pan for about 28 min. However, they still were rather tasteless and dry. They had a nice chewy texture, so they might be tweekable, but as I made them, I wouldn't do it again.

I gave it a 4 only because I did not make the bars all the way according to the recipe. First I added an egg. I also did not use nuts. And I used white chocolate chips, chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips. They turned out very tasty!

If you like flavorless treats, this is the treat for you.  If I could give this recipe a grade it would be a big fat "F+" for FANTASTIC FAILURE. It was a waste of ingredients, time, effort, and money.

These were ok.  Based on other reviews, I added an egg and a tablespoon of milk.  As others have said, they have a shortbread taste/texture to them.  They are ok, but I prefer more of a cookie bar.

I will give it 3 stars because they are semi-good, but I wish I had read the previous reviews saying to add eggs for moisture. These were so dry. They were a little lacking in flavor, too, but I think that was mostly due to the dryness.

I did this exactly as written and it had no flavor.  I added an egg and extra van ext the second time and it still didnt have flavor. I used oil and a little bit of butter (ran out of butter trying to make this recipe!) and then it was so greasy the sheet of grease and chips flew off the pan into the trash when I took it out of the oven. There is just no substitute for the original Toll House cookies, made in a pan.

This recipe was okay. I liked the fact that it called for ingredients I always have on hand and it was fast and easy. However, the bars lacked flavor. My husband flat out said they were NOT good. They're not the best cookie bars I've ever made. I wouldn't recommend this recipe based on flavor, but they were fast and easy! Also, FYI, the recipe doesn't need the egg other reviewers added. The mixture is supposed to be crumbly-the butter adds fat and oil for moisture-so you can press it in the pan like the recipe says. These are bars, not cookies, so the mix doesn't need to be cookie dough consistency.

I made some changes and this recipe still didn't turn out so well.  I added extra vanilla, 2 eggs and a 1/4 cup of white sugar and it tasted more like chocolate chip shortbread.  I would decrease the amount of flour to 1.5 cups next time, add 2 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla and a little milk...but it might need more than that.

We were all jonesin' for something sweet here tonight, and to my dismay I was limited on flour, had NO baking soda OR white sugar.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Had a lil' less flour than this recipe called for (just over 1.5 cups).  Added two eggs, per suggestions.  Baked at 325...for an eternity!  (Close to 45 minutes) Oh, yeah:  I also used a full bag o' semi-sweet choco chips.  (Dropped some of 'em on the top before baking, for aesthetic).  Easy and killed that "sweetie beast." Thanks!

I put 2 eggs in it and they came out DELICIOUS!!!
everyone loved them.
my mom said that they were not too sweet like the normal tollhouse cookie bars are. 
i guess because there's only one kind of sugar. i don't know
they were excellent anyways!!! =]

I made the recipe as stated, but used a salt-free margarine. I wanted a cookie I could give my son who is allergic to dairy and eggs. The bars tasted good, but had a sort of grainy texture. I think that is part of the problem for other reviewers, too... I beat the dough for an extra few minutes to try to get it smoother. I think I may try using some honey in place of some of the brown sugar the next time I make these to add a little moisture to the dough so it holds together better. Also, I used a 13X9 glass pan and cooked them at 325F for 25 mins.

I searched all over for a toffee cookie bar recipe and was unsuccessful.  I found this one and like the others, the mix was too thick.  I added 2 eggs, about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts(or almonds) and a cup of chopped heath bar.  They were the talk of the office the next day at work!

This recipe would of been better if it was not so crumbly! When I was making this I put the chocolate chips and dough in a eletric mixer. I accidently left it in to long.(about 10 minutes) When I came bach the chocolate chips got crushed into the dough!! Making it chocolate dough. I added some more chocolate chips and the chocolate chip bars turned into double chocolate chip bars!! They tasted really good!! Try it!

This was a great simple and quick alternative to our usual chocolate chip cookies. We went to make our cookies and realized we didn't have eggs on hand, so went searching for egg-less cookie recipes and wound up here. Turned out to be a great recipe.

I followed the advice of others and added 2 eggs, 2tsp of vanilla, and 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I also omitted the nuts since I didn't have any. I used a 9x13 pan. They were dry and still bland.    I definitely will not make this again.

I have to admit, they were very dry.  I won't be making them again for a cookie treat or bar but crumbled up or under a scoop of ice cream, they're a quick ice cream topper!

This cooks well and tastes alright, but it's rather dry and crumbly.  The bar doesn't hold it's shape that well and would do better with more moist ingredients.

I made these cookies just as the recipies said- they turned out gooey, but MMMMmmm.............so delicious! Once they cooled, they were stilled gooey and scrumptious but not to messy to pick up. My sister also agreed they were wonderful!

These cookie bars are really easy to make, but as other reviewers have said they are very dry.  I added an egg and an extra tsp vanilla, but still dry.  And too nutty!  I would cut back the amount of pecans to at least 1/2 cup, maybe less.  Overall, an easy to make bar with few ingredients.  Good in a pinch if you have company coming over, but otherwise I probably won't make them again.

I liked the idea of chocolate chip bars, so I gave this recipe a try.  I was short on eggs anyway, so when I came across this recipe, I tried it using one egg like one of the reviewers had suggested.  Well, it looked like a chocolate chip bar, but it was just kind of bland.

JUST what I have been looking for!

I have a child who is allergic to egg and nuts. We have been looking all over for a *special* treet for her and this fits the bill. Imagine never eatting a choclate chip cookie...now she can. THANK YOU
We omitted the nuts and this is PERFECT! I bet this will be a staple for her now. I doubled the batch without any problems and they already half gone!

I love this recipe! Very quick,very easy and a lovely tasty result. 

I cooked mine in a 10x12 inch Swiss roll tin which is about 1/2 inch deep. The finished cookie has come out crisp on the outside and just a little soft in the centre. 

I cooked mine for a little longer than stated too,you really have to keep your eye on this to make sure you take it out at the right stage.

I picked this recipe b/c I wanted a quick cookie fix, and it was very easy to make with my toddler.  However, the texture was way too dry and crumbly.  I think the recipe needs an egg or maybe some oil or something.

This recipe was definitely easy but the consistency of the bars was weird.  They were very rich but my children did not like the consistency.  Would not make again.

Well, if you need a quick chocolate fix, I might recommend this recipe.  However, they didn't cook evenly and were very greasy.  The ones in the middle even more so. Tried cooking them an extra 10 minutes to see if they would dry out or firm up a little, but didn't.  The outer edges of the cookie were okay.

Instead of getting cookie-like BARS, I got a cookie-like CAKE! It tasted like a great cookie, but was ultimately a fatty cake.

Made these exactly how the recipe states. It reminded my family of a shortbread flavor, very rich in butter. Used mini chocolate chips so it felt like there were more there. Good for dessert with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made these for a senior center lunch.  However, I used coconut oil instead of butter, left out the nuts, and increased the quantity to 100!  Big hit.

I am so grateful for the reviews from all of you good people here! I added ¼ white sugar, 2 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp of salt, 3/4 tsp of baking powder, 3/4 tsp of baking sofa, 2 eggs and made sure to sift the flour... the result... a decadent, chewy, yummy chocolate chip cookie bar that I’m sure I will make again and again!

Not at all soft, and way too buttery. Next time I'll use a smaller pan like a 9x13. Maybe cut back on the butter.

Turned out well AFTER also adding one egg & 1/4 cup white sugar.  Turned out less dense.  Fluffier and better texture. May make again.

I made a few modifications based on reviews I read and previous cookie making.

1 tsp of baking powder and soda
1/2 of white and brown sugar, will try all brown sugar next time
2 eggs
always add cinnamon for extra flavor

pretty good, very fluffy, a little dry.

I made mine in a 9x13 glass pan at 350 for about 22 minutes

I added 2 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips.  It came out a little dry and not a great flavor.  Think I would do half white sugar and half the brown sugar next time and more vanilla.  Will try again

I wish I would have read the reviews first and seen that additional ingredients are needed before I wasted my time and baking ingredients. I couldn't even get them out of the pan in one piece, they crumbled and fell apart.

I made this recipe with only a few minor changes. I melted the butter since I didn't have time to soften it, I used dark cane sugar instead of brown sugar and I used a slightly smaller baking dish so that the bars would be a bit thicker. They are wonderful and so easy to make! They are quite good refrigerated. I had a craving for something like this and I am very glad I made them, couldn't be more satisfied.

This isn't even close to being right. Batter was way too dry and has a funny after taste. I would think it needs eggs. Don't bother with this one find a different recipe.

Needs an egg and only 15-17 minutes in the oven. My first batch was really crispy.

I looked at the reviews before I made it and based on what I saw I added a few things. 1 egg, 1 cup of sugar, 1 TBSP peanut butter and baking cocoa powder, & 1 tsp baking soda with a extra shot of vanilla. I also added a whipped peanut butter frosting after the cookiebar cooled. (1/2 cup of butter & peanut butter, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 cups powdered sugar, 2-3 tablespoons coconut/almond/cow milk [your preference, I used unsweetened coconut milk] combine the butters & vanilla. Add the sugar. Combine. Gradually Add milk. Combine. If too thick add more milk or if too thin add more sugar.) then to top it off I added caramel Sunday syrup drizzle. I'm in love.

This basic recipe is perfect for improvising. I've added blueberries on several occasions and it was delightful. Tonight I'm using blackberries. Next week I'll be using coconut flour and dark chocolate chocolate-chips. Easy to make and easy to clean up. and the cookie bars are heavenly!

Added an egg, had to bake for an extra 10mins to reach golden brown on top. Ended up with a texture similar to short bread. Not exactly what I was hoping for.

It was really crumbly when I stirred up the batter so I added some milk and brown sugar on top after putting it in the pan

I added one jumbo egg, one and a half teaspoons of baking soda, an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and an extra scant half cup of chocolate chips (I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet) while omitting the nuts. I baked for 23 minutes at 350 degrees in a greased 9x13 inch pan, and it came out perfect. The bars are rich (due to the butter) but still slightly fluffy (due to the baking soda). My kids loved these. We will be making this recipe again and again since it's so much simpler than placing cookies on a baking sheet!

These are addicting in their own way. I did add the egg as reviewers suggested. Yes, they were a bit crumbly and your first bite could be described as dry but they were definitely tasty!  Hard to stop at just one.  :-)

I basically had to change everything. Added an egg and some milk. Some extra vanilla. Still way too thick. Good luck smoothing it out into a 10 x 15. Had to use a 9 x 13 in order to actually make it touch all the sides of the pan. Go find a better one. This one is a bummer.

The way I made this recipe was PERFECT! I put the mix in a 9x13 pan, and reduced the temperature to 325 degrees and baked for 20 minutes. I also added 1 egg. They were gooey in the middle and I loved them! I also put extra chocolate chips and no nuts.

This turns out more like a cake then a cookie. I did add 2 eggs because the mix before the eggs was VERY dry. The eggs gave it the right consistency however the texture is more like a cake. Tasty but not at all what I expected.

This recipe is a little dry. I would suggest adding eggs to the mix. However, the recipe as is would make a good cookie crust for a pie.

I made these one night when I had unknowingly run out of eggs in the middle of the Tollhouse recipe. Great substitute recipe and quite a filling cookie!

When I made this recipe, I took some advice from other reviews. I added 1/4 cup of sugar, an egg, and some milk. Before adding the milk and egg, the batter was very dry and clumpy. I thought that the extra 1/4 cup of sugar would make the cookie bars sweeter. But i found that they still didn't taste sweet.

Was not at all impressed with this recipe. The finished product tasted like butter and sugar, with the sugar being caramelized.

I have used this recipe many times and love it due to the fact less ingrediants are used than what is required for regular chocolate chip cookie bars.  the only adjustment I made was to add more chocolate chips and omit pecans. (which is the way my kids like them).

I doubled the recipe, and added two eggs as a result. I should have sprayed the pan so they came out easier, BUT the recipe was easy and came out tasty and good...with a minor adjustment, these are good!

I gave a bar to my sister and my husband - both took a nibble, mumbled something about being full, and left the rest of their square on the table.  They were dry, floury, and tasteless.

Something didn't seem right about this recipe.  It wasn't really sweet and it wasn't really bar like.  After spreading out the mixture into the jelly roll pan it was the thinnest sheet and it was almost transparent.  I double checked the recipe amounts and made it twice and to no avail it was still super thin and not very tasty.
