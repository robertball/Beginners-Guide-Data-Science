This is good! I do feel like it was missing something, but not exactly sure what...This came together super quick. I sprinkled a little parsley on top for some extra color. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Too oniony for my tastebuds.  Next time, I will leave out the onion, maybe put in some garlic.  Also very wet.  The photo shows  a ball with a whiter cheese than cheddar, also.

This was very tasty and everyone liked it. I used red bell pepper instead of green added green onions. I also added a little garlic powder (because I like garlic). I divided the cheese into three balls, rolled them in shredded mozzarella cheese and used a small carrot for a nose and peppercorns for eyes, smile and buttons to make a snowman. It was a bit loose, but that could be because I used Neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese.

I make something very similar to this and have for years.  Instead of adding shredded cheddar to the cream cheese I use a tub of cheddar spread (like cracker barrel)  I roll in real bacon bits....it's a family favorite!!

I made this and added peppers red and yellow that i made. I added more cheddar to the mixture than the receipe stated, and left out the worc. sauce. it tasted great, either in ball or as a dip.
