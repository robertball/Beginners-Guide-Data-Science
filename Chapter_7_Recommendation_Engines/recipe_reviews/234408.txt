This was very good! It was a bit on the sweet side, but it went really well with our potato soup tonight. I did use the optional butter, and I suggest doing the same, as it gave the bread a nice, slightly salty flavor that we really enjoyed. Very simple...I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made a very similar version to this recipe. The only difference was more butter. I agree it was a little too sweet for me, but very good. I would cut the sugar in half and add a pinch of salt. You NEED TO SIFT THE FLOUR... and if you don't use self-rising flour, add 3 teaspoons of baking powder. You can pour the melted butter on top when you first put it in. I baked for exactly 60 minutes. :)

This is the easiest and tastiest bread I have ever made.  I used Pear Cider Beer from Woodchuck and it is really yummy.  The crust is like eating candy! Before baking I suggest you cover the pan while your oven is warming up.  It gives the bread a chance to rise a little and it comes out perfectly every time!

I can't figure out what I did wrong. I've made this before and it turned out perfect. This time it became a dense rock. I tried to make two loafs each with a different beer and I was very careful not to over mix. Each one turned out inedible. I'm sure it's not the recipe that was wrong. I just don't know what mistake I made.

Very yummy but just a little to sweet for my liking. I'll cut the sugar in half next time.

I made four loaves of this today and the recipe was a complete success!
I followed the recipe only changing the amount of sugar from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup. Also, I poured 3 Tbsp. melted butter over the unbaked loaf and baked at 350° F for 47 minutes. Absolutely perfect and my house smelled SO good!
For the remaining three loaves I followed the recipe reducing the sugar to 2 Tbsp, adding 2 Tbsp of Italian herbs seasoning (store brand) and just a pinch of salt.
I once again poured 3 Tbsp. melted butter over the unbaked loaf and set to bake at 350° F for 40 minutes. At this point I opened the oven to add 1/4 cup shredded mozzarella cheese to the top of the loaf, then returning to bake another 7 minutes until golden brown on top. 
This bread is just simply delicious any way that it is made.  I took two loaves to my sister's birthday party and the other two went to in-laws house. 
It was delicious with our supper!
I can't wait to make this again to go with chili when cooler weather arrives!  First chilly day we get, I'll be baking this bread!  Thank you, Cassie for sharing your recipe! 
Tammy ??

I make this bread for my bf all the time. He loves it (and me, when I make it for him! ;). He likes the loaf to be more dense, like a pound cake, so I substitute one cup of all-purpose organic unbleached flour for the self-rising flour. He has no idea this recipe only take me about 3 min. to prepare!

So easy and great for the nights that I didn't put together bread ahead of time and need something savory. Following other recommendations, I cut the sugar back just a bit, had to make self rising from another recipe from this site, and you have to use the butter. Tastes great!

Daughter had a "dinner and movie" night, and asked me to bring homemade rolls, which I did, along with this beer bread. Well, the rolls just sat there, good as they were, and this beer bread disappeared.  Everyone loved it.

I made this exactly like the recipe called using Regular Budweiser beer. I dont drink so I needed to only buy 1 can. I also made homemade beer cheese so the tall can of beer was perfect.
Any who, I made it for Super Bowl Sunday and everyone LOVED it. So easy to make. I have purchased Tastefully Simple Beer Bread a few times and can honestly say I will never again. So much cheaper doing it this way and tasted the exact same!

Loved this simple and delicious beer bread recipe. We made 4 loaves using different flavors of beers we had hanging out in the refrigerator (peanut butter beer, Shiners Holiday beer, Milwaukees Best Light, and a Corona).  Each loaf had their own unique flavor and color. We sliced them up and served with our Christmas dinner and it was a hit. We also made some smaller loaves and gave to our neighbors for Christmas. This recipe is a keeper for our family!

Good. Easy. Pleased my family of picky eaters. I was able to make this very quickly and it smelled great while it baked. Still crumbly and not sure if this had to do with the beer i used - Stella Artois. After reading other reviews, I'll experiment with other beers. Just not a 5-star rating cause the bread was solid and I wouldn't save any for the next day cause I didn't think it would heat well. But overall, still a great super easy and fast recipe.

Loved the TS beer bread, but hated the hassle of ordering and getting it in. This is a perfect replica! Yes, it is sweet, but so is the TS one. Not perfect for every meal, but a very good recipe. Highly recommend!

I have made this before but with a slightly different recipe which will help those who felt it was too sweet! Instead of 1/2 cup of sugar, use 3 tablespoons of sugar! It won’t be too sweet and comes out tasty!

Made exactly per the recipe, can't get any easier.  Awesome!!  Will try with some cheese next time.

No more $7 boxes from Tastefully Simple - adios.

I’m super happy with this recipe. I did not have self rising flour so made my own. It did rise beautifully and tastes amazing. I think I’ll bake it a little longer next time, with using a lighter color beer (Corona). Darker beer tends to bake a darker bread.

I decreased sugar by half and could have done less. My entire family loved it. Quick and easy. I served this bread tonight with chili. It is 8 degrees, very windy and snowing. The perfect meal. I used Zip Line Copper Alt. beer.

This is  far the easiest beer bread recipe!  I read everyone else's reviews before making.  I sifted the flour, only added 1/4 cup sugar & poured the 3Tbsp of melted butter on top before baking.  I also covered loaf pans before baking.  Smelled so good baking.  I made 2 loaves for work lunch paired with real butter & homemade chili!  Everyone loved it!  DEFINITELY  going in my Cookbook Bible!!

S.I.M.P.L.E.  You gotta love recipes like this!  I also added a little salt, cut the sugar in half and used baking powder with my all purpose flour.  Followed one reviewer's suggestion to let it sit for 5-10 min before baking.  Turned out great! Toasted it later and served with garlic salt in butter! Yum, yum!  Family loved it!

I've made this several times and we always enjoy it. It is quick to prepare and makes a close-grained loaf that slices easily. I've added cinnamon to make it a sweet breakfast bread or to use with peanut butter. I've halved the sugar and added various herbs for a great savory bread. I rarely buy self-rising flour, but the conversion of regular flour by adding baking powder and salt is easy and has never caused a problem.

We enjoyed this Easy Delishie Bread.
I have been making it almost every week end.
Will also be trying it using a light beer. Wondering if there are any suggestions for changes to the recipe  since the yeast content in the lighter beer is lower.
Anyone???

I had several people love this bread! I used brown sugar instead of white sugar a pinch of salt and I melted the butter and poured it on top of the batter before I started baking at all so I don't have to worry about it later.

This is a sweet bread-- just like Tastefully Simple's. I like to add pecans and dried cranberries to it. Don't skip the butter. So good!

Didn't like the beer smell or taste, but maybe I'll try it with yeast and water next time. It did look nice and was easy to make.

This stuff is amazing and so easy! To add a little more flavor you can easily put a few spoonfuls of whole wheat flour or any seasonings in the dough that you think will be tasty. Pretty quick and simple!

Yum! I love this beer bread! And I love even more that I don’t have to have a mix on hand every time I want to make it, not to mention how much cheaper this is to make!

The bread turned out very well.  I only used 3 tablespoons of sugar because that's what I remember from the recipe I use for the church St. Pat's dinner (which I lose year after year.)   I think 1/2 cup sugar would be too much.  You can't get any simpler than this recipe.

SO quick and easy you can make it on a week night when you are tired and still muster the energy for this quick and easy.  I have made it twice once with Bud light and once with a heavy brown beer.  The brown beer added a deeper dimension to the flavor.  Love it for a super quick and easy accompaniment to soup, chili etc.

love this recipe!  Used Crispin Pacific Pear cider, so it was a dessert bread.  Goes well with something savory...

Perfect every time! We make it sweet and savory. We’ve added cinnamon, or garlic. It’s a favorite at our house.

So darn good. It was seriously perfect. I'll use this recipe every time. I used a bottle of Miller lite and did go ahead and add the  1/2 cup of sugar (I didn't cut it like some others did) and did do the 3 Tbsp melted butter on the top while it baked. Baked it on 350 for 50 minutes. Perfection!!!! Thank you!!

Perfect! Tasted the dough before baking and worried it would be too sweet. After baking,  it truly was perfection. I did put the melted butter on before baking because I did that when making TS beer bread. Thank you for this recipe!

I used to buy the tastefully simple bread mix.  Once I found this recipe I started making my own.  My son now requests it every time I make chili.

This recipe is simple, easy and tastes delicious! I didn't use self-rising flour. Didn't have any at the time, so I used Dry Active Yeast and it worked great. That's the only thing I used differently in this recipe.
