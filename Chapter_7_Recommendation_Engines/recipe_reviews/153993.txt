This was delicious! I added some garlic,salt and pepper to the chicken. I used another small can of tomato sauce for more sauce for the pasta and added minced garlic,bay leaves salt and pepper to the sauce. I also used angel hair pasta instead. So good!!!!

This was a really easy recipe to make and it was pretty good. It is very quick to make so it is a good week night meal. I added some chopped onion and minced garlic also. Tasted pretty good the next day as leftovers also.

This was okay. It was basically a fancily named goulash. Which my husband loved since he loves goulash, but I'm not so much a fan of it. I added some spcies (garlic powder, etc.) for some flavor...otherwise it was pretty good. Not so sure I'll make it again though, I may just try to find a more flavorful one...

I made quite a few changes on this recipe, based on my family's likes: I used multi-grain pasta (very filling!); used chicken tenders and seasoned them with while cooking, then cut them into strips (which meant that it cooked longer then just a few minutes - and also it's easier to cut the chicken into strips when it's cooked); added strips of small red, yellow and orange peppers with the chicken in the last few minutes of cooking and made sure that they were cooked and soft; added about 3 tablespoons of minced garlic at the same time that the tomato sauce was being added; and seasoned the sauce mixture before simmering. My husband loved it so much at this point that I wasn't even able to add the cream - and it was absolutely yummy!!!!
