This turned out well--moist and tender. I added some chopped onion on the bottom of the slow cooker and sprinkled the roast all over with chili powder, cumin and garlic salt. I used medium salsa, but we still thought it needed some hot sauce when we ate it. I think the beer and salsa alone is just a bit too bland, but still good. I used a 4 pound pork loin roast but kept the rest of the ingredients the same.

This recipe was easy and I had all of the ingredients.  As mentioned the type of salsa used can alter the taste.  I made it in the oven but next time will use the crockpot.

This was an easy meal for the crock pot.  I used black beans because that's what I had but otherwise followed the original recipe.  Next time I'll add a spicier salsa and some chili powder and cumin.   I ate it in a taco shell - tasty!
