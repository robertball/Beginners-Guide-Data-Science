Excellent casserole! I had some left over tamales and came to AllRecipes to look for something to do with them. I had pork tamales and so used red sauce rather than green. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as posted. The combination of red sauce and sour cream made a great sauce.

Will definitely make again.

No substitutions and we loved it!  Next time I will use more tamales, they didnâ€™t cover the whole 9x13 pan.  Guess the tamales I bought were small.

This turned out really good after sitting in the refrigerator overnight. The liquid from the tomatoes made my cream sauce separate originally but it sorted itself out in the end. I used both chicken and pork tamales and they both worked good. Even though I originally had issues with the cream sauce, the taste is delicious and that is coming from someone who doesn't typically care for sour cream sauces. This is a great way to utilize leftover tamales.
