My mom used to make Tamale pie all the time when we were growing up.  I wanted to make some for my husband and couldn't get ahold of her recipe so I used this one.  It was very similar to hers.  I made a few changes.  I didn't use the cumin seed and added some garlic.  Also added a little tomato paste to thicken up the meat filling.  I had to place in a baking dish as my frying pan was not oven proof.  I didn't put the cheese in the bread topping, but put on the last five minutes of baking.  It was really good.

Tamale pie always disappoints me, but this was good. I spiced it up, used tomatoes/green chilies instead of regular & served with lots of salsa. Yummy.

This was yummy!  Easier than my other tamale pie recipie. I had to get out my skillet, which I never use. I only had one can of tomatoes so I added in an extra 2 tbsp water, for the missing juices, but it was a perfect amount of tomatoes. I will make this again.

This is going to be a new standard in my family!  We used 1% lean ground turkey, used cumin powder instead of seeds and added a can each of green chiles and black beans.  This dish is even tastier the 2nd day.  Next time I'll cook everything up to the cornbread layer and leave it in the fridge overnight - then add the cornbread layer and bake in order to maximize the flavors.  Adding a canned chipotle in adobo sauce would make it even more delicious.  I don't think it needs any salt except for the 1/4tsp in the cornbread layer.

This was pretty good.  I didn't use the corn because I forgot to buy it.  I also just poured it all into a casserole dish to bake.  Served with sour cream.  It did seem to be missing something, but I don't think it was the corn.  I'm thinking green chilis or something else might be very good in this.

This was just ok.  It lacked something that I just can't put my finger on...

I liked the flavor of this and it was quite easy to put together.  It turned out a bit too dry for my taste, but it wasn't bad.

This recipe has great potential.  First, it needs to cook about 10 or 15 minutes longer than stated.  Second it was a little bland, but that is easily fixed.  Next time (I will make this again), I will add either salsa or green chilies to the cornbread mix.  On the burger mixture, I doubled the spices and it still needed more. Next time I will substitute salsa for the tomatoes.  Also, as suggested by others, it needs salsa or enchilada sauce on the side when being served, we used homemade enchilada sauce and it was good.

This looked fast and easy and it was.  But the cornbread did not cook which made the whole casserole gritty.

I made this recipe last night for my husband and his cousins.  The meat mixture was really good, but the cornbread part was horrible.  I used white cornmeal instead of yellow and I had to transfer it to a casserole dish. I had to cook it for 30-35 minutes for the cornbread to set up, and even then it wasn't cooked all the way in the middle.  Everyone still said it tasted good, but no one went back for seconds.  I was really disappointed because my mom used to make this dish.  I won't try it again.

This recipe is pretty good, definitely quick and easy.  It was a little bland or my tastes so I will have to really spice it up next time.  I also found it too tomatoey so I might only use one can next time or use the tomatoes with chiles.  I would also drain at least one of the cans, I thought it was a little too runny.  It is so easy for a novice like me that it would be hard to not make it again.

This was very good. My first bite seemed a bit lacking, but as the sour cream and salsa mixed in with rest, it was delicious. I used ground turkey, which can be a little bland, so next time I might pump up the spices a bit more. I also forgot to add garlic, which is a must have for me, so that should help next time too. My skillet isn't oven proof, so I did use a casserole dish. I also used two eggs for the topping as I didn't want to take the time to separate it, and it tasted just fine. Next time I'll definitely double the recipe and put one in the freezer.

Having grown up with "real" mexican and New Mexican food, I am very skeptical of any recipe of this ilk that looks like it was developed at a test kitchen in Ohio (nothing against you buckeyes).  However, this recipe was plenty tastey, and was super fast to throw together.  I used my trusty wok in lieu of a frying pan, and even that didn't seem to anger the kitchen gods, because it came out just great.  Serve it up with your favorite red chili enchilada sauce to add a little authenticity.
