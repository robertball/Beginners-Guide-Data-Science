I make this same cake but I bake it in the oven for 45 to 50 minutes @ 350. It you are careful in pouring the butter over the cake mix, there is no dry area. I also add chopped pecans. You can also use apple filling and a yellow cake mix. You can also use no sugar filling and a sugar free cake mix for those people who can't consume sugar like myself and the taste is fantastic.

Made for Recipe Group. I was a little skeptical about this...cake in a slow cooker? I used a 21 oz can of pineapple, but only half of the juice from it. I microwaved the butter and then stirred the juice in. Layered the pineapple, cherry pie filling, sprinkled the cake mix over it, and poured the juice/butter on it. After about 2 hours there were a few spots still dry on the top so I stirred them gently, put the lid back and slapped my hands to keep from messing with it any further. I kept tapping the top to see if it was springy after the 3 hours, but this doesn't set like a regular cake. Finally turned it off, grabbed a big spoon and plated a portion. Hubby had two. Obviously it was pretty good! Very wet like I imagine one of those molten cakes to be. But yummy good! Really sweet from the juice poured over the cake mix. I did use my 7 qt crockpot and it turned out fine. A smaller crock would most likely result in a higher cake. Stored the leftovers in a flat tupperware container, used spatula to get out of the crock. Leftovers warmed in microwave were just as good. This would be a good potluck spoon cake. I probably would not make this for at home, 3 hours is just too long to wait for cake! Thanks for the recipe.

Some of the cake mix did not combine with the butter/juice mixture or cherries, so I stirred the entire contents of the slow cooker and ended up with a yummy, chocolatey-gooey dessert. It was even better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Although it tasted good, the consistency was sticky and the dessert wasn’t attractive, so I won't serve it to company without tweaking. Next time I'll try combining the cake mix with the butter/juice mixture before spreading over the cherries in the crock-pot.

I didn't have any problems with this recipe--I didn't stir the butter/juice into the cake mix but simply poured it over.  There were no unmixed portions.  The cake part was densely chocolate and brownie like in texture.  It was very good.  Very good.  I would make again.

This was an easy midweek dessert. The kids liked it but it is very sweet.  I mixed the butter/juice mixture with the cake batter before pouring over fruit.  Cake was moist not gooey like the other reviews.  Note:  Use a large crockpot because the cake will rise. Served with whipped cream.

The combination would have been good together, but this cake turned out nasty! I took it to a Sunday dinner and it was a flop! Maybe fix it a different way. Sorry :(

I love this cake, I mix the butter and pineapple juice with the cake mix ahead of time and layer it like the directions said left it for 3 hours and the house smells so good. And the cake even better then I thought please try it.

I made this and used the suggestion BusyCook made--I poked holes in the mix with a chop stick before pouring the butter mixture over it.  My husband took it to work to share with his work group.  It was a big hit, only one serving left--for me.  It was moist throughout, very rich and balanced by the addition of whipped cream.  Thank you for a great easy dessert recipe.

When I made this cake I  mixed the pineapple juice and butter mixture with the dry cake mix before placing it in the crock. It came out Fantastic. Adding is must though. Thanks for the great recipe.

I tried this out following recipe exactly. There were areas of the cake that was still dry powder. It was like eating the mix from the box. Maybe it is the difference of crock pots

So easy and very very yummy!  I wish it were just a tad bit more cake like, but I am not a good enough baker to know how to tweak it.  We will definitely make this again!

This was awesome. I made as written, checked on it occasionally, and gently stired the dry spots on top. It was awesome!

Hubby and kids really enjoyed this.  Easy to put together.  Hubby described it as a fudgy brownie more than cake.  Next time I make it I think I will poke little holes in the cake mix before I add the butter/juice mixture.  Mine was still a little powdery in the middle.  Once I combined it with other areas of the dessert no one noticed and they ate it up.

This is just a slow cooker version of a dump cake. For those that said some of the cake mix did not combine with the cake, there is an easy fix... place the cake mix in a large freezer bag and seal the top. use your hands to gently mash the cake mix and knead it to get out the lumps. I have even ran it through my ninja blender on low to make it lump free. Also I use more butter than the recipe calls for and make sure the entire cake is covered with pats of butter. Also make sure you use a good brand of pineapple like Dole, there is a difference when you use a good brand as opposed to a generic brand, believe me I've made them both ways. Also if you do not use a large enough can of pineapple it makes a difference too. It will never be like a regular cake no matter what you do to it short of making a regular cake as directed on the box. I think of it more of a cobbler consistency instead of a cake.  Just a tip but you can also use Pillsbury's sugar-free cake mix for a healthier alternative and it tastes amazing! Another tip is DO NOT use cake mixes that say they have pudding in them, I have never had one come out right with this type of cake mix as it make the mix too moist. Just a standard cake mix works best.

Made this for the recipe group.  I'm sorry for the low rating, but this did not turn out for me.  To be fair, I did use a sugar-free cake mix.  I tried to leave it alone for the entire time, but it still had dry spots after two hours.  I blended those into the partially cooked mix.  I tried it after three hours and didn't care for it.  It didn't taste like a cake.  It was more like partially cooked brownie mix.  The fruit is great together and I saved that.  I'm glad it worked out for others!

Sorry to say but for me this just came out as a gooey mess.  I had a few bites and my kids wouldn't eat it at all. Maybe I can try it a different way next time.

This desert was wonderful. It was more like a cherry brownie with pineapple . I used a 15 oz can of pineapple and I followed others advice and poked holes in the batter. It was even better the second day when I heated up the leftovers. Next time, I will completely stir the cake before serving. It was not pretty so be sure to add vanilla ice cream. (I also used devils food cake instead of plain chocolate cake)

Made this for Recipe Group.  Made as per instructions.  My only problem was there was a large clump of uncooked (dry) cake mix in the center.  I wasn't going to let this defeat me.  I mixed it up (only on the top) with the rest of the partially cooked cake and let go for another hour (4 hours total).  The ooey gooey deliciousness was worth the wait.

This was an okay dessert, but I think that I prefer my moms version to this one. (her version is in an 13X9 cake pain dump cherries and pineapple dump dry cake mix on top and then use one stick of butter thinly sliced covering the entire top. it bakes on 325 for 30-40min)

This is killer easy and really delish!   Especially wonderful with whipped cream and/or vanilla ice cream.  Just keep the four basic ingredients in your pantry and anytime you need a no-fuss dessert, you're in business!  Let it cook for you while you're busy pulling the rest of the dinner together and readying the house for company.  How wonderful!

So Easy and Sooooo Good.  Enjoyed this with Vanilla Ice Cream, made exactly like recipe said and had no problems.  This was a first for me making dessert in my slow cooker, but it won't be the last for me.....thanks for a nice recipe.

This was AWFUL!! There was no way of rescuing this.. it was simply a waste of cake mix and pie filling and pineapple. This didn't cook properly at all. It was more like chocolate soup. My husband loves chocolate (as do I) and it wasn't anywhere near edible. MAYBE if it was baked in the oven to begin with it MIGHT turn out somewhat edible but I did it in the slow cooker (following directions to a T) and when it didn't work I tried rescuing it by baking it in the oven. It was nothing but a waste of time.

So simple!  So yummy!  I didn't have cherry pie filling, so I used strawberry preserves.  I don't think I used enough of it, because I couldn't really taste it.  After about two hours, I stirred it to get the dry batter mixed in with the wet, and I also turned it up to high at that point.

I followed this recipe exactly. It turned out perfect, well almost perfect. The was one very small area of the dry mix. Next time I will either add more pineapple juice, and perhaps mix it a little. Our entire staff loved this. I think a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream would be heavenly with this. This recipe is effortless and mouthwatering! I plan to make again!

Yes, I tried this recipe and it was delicious.  We do not have Cherry Pie Filling in S Africa (as far as I know), so I bought canned cherries, had to drain and de-pip them, and remove the stems.  Then I thickened the juice by adding 1 Tablespoon of Maizena (cornstarch)+ 3 teaspoons sugar, and microwaved on high stirring every 10 seconds until thickened.  Added 125ml tub of Greek Yoghurt, mixed it into the cherry sauce.  Then I added the cherries to this mixture and spread it over the pineapple as in the recipe... it gave such a lovely flavour to the cake.  I had to let it cook for a further hour... so 4 hours cooking time in slow cooker for me.  Thank you for a super recipe.  I loved it.

Oh my excellent cake!! Growing up with my mother as a baker . I'm very picky when it comes to cake
I followed as others mixed the pineapple juice, butter and cake mix together added extra cherries. Next time I may add a little coconut flakes.. put my crock on low for 3 hours mine has a timer after the 3 it goes to warm automatically. Perfect!! I will definitely make again

First of all, I altered this recipe according to some reviews I had read.  Used a 1/4 c. butter rather than 1/2 c. and mixed pineapple juice and butter with the dry cake mix in separate bowl and then topped cherries with the moisened mix so as to avoid the potential for dry cake mix in the finished dessert.  Overall I would say it was a success and definitely something I would make again.  May tweak it more next time though to add more flavor. Nevertheless, I do recommend this recipe, especially topped with whipped cream or served with ice cream.

(Maybe I should put  as a new recipe, but I tweaked this a bit)
 Take super cold butter and mash it into the cake mix until it's chunked together like a crumble. Then put it on top of the fruit mixture and bake! Worked well with chocolate cake mix and cherry pie filling. Add chocolate chips when it's done baking.  soooo good!  Love dump cakes!

I made it as advertised. Unbelievably easy as attested to by the fact that I was able to concoct it and, along with my wife, eat it and enjoy it. My first ever dessert creation.

I eagerly waited the 3 hours and was satisfyingly amazed.  So easy, inexpensive, and absolutely yummy.  It gave me the idea to use other fruits and other cake mixes.

Not good. Consistency was weird like it didn’t set up right. Could’ve been because I added a couple Tablespoons of Kirsch, which Germans know is required to call it a Black Forest cake.

Flavor-wise, this was okay, however the overall texture was like raw brownie mix with cherries. Some parts of the chocolate cake cooked, some didn't. It was a mushy mess. If I was ever inclined to make this again, I would bake it in the oven.

I'm not sure if I messed up the recipe or it just needed to hot when eaten, but it was horrible. My 17 year old son, who is a garbage disposal, didn't even finish his serving of it.

I always make a recipe the way it is told the first time; so I did nothing different to the recipe.  I made it for my husband, daughter and three grandchildren.  My husband enjoyed it (it was chocolate after all!) but two of the three children tasted it and did not like it.  It does not look very nice and I found that there were dry patches which tasted salty.  Not enough actual cake in it and it was very gooey.  I will not make it again.

Well, my initial problem was that I dropped the can when draining the pineapple and had to scoop up juice and crushed pineapple! Then when I dropped it again into the butter!  From there on things improved, however, and we LOVED this! Yes, there were some dry spots but I just stirred it all together before dishing it out. Next time i'll try the suggestion of doing this part way through the baking. I used my smaller slow cooker - think it's 4 quarts. And i used a disposable liner, which sure made clean-up a breeze. Doesn't look particularly pretty but it tasted like a very fudgy brownie with cherries. Vanilla ice cream on it was perfect- and a very small serving was quite satisfying so i see this serving at least 8 quite easily. Thanks for a winner!!

Great recipe! I think you have to approach this cake with an open mind and a sense of humor. I have made it twice, made mistakes with quantities of ingredients both times, and it was fun and very tasty even when it turned out like pudding. Anything made in a slow cooker requires some sense of adventure for the cook (if you like precision, don't use a slow cooker)! My family loves this cake and I will make it again for sure. I am even planning to have my kids make it by themselves in a  Dutch oven next time we go camping. This is a keeper.

The ONLY change I made was that I mixed the cake mix with the pineapple juice and melted better before I added it to the slow cooker. I really feel you have to do that for this to come out good without any issues. It was YUMMY!!!

The cake mix did not blend or cook evenly.  If you are going to attempt this dish I would suggest mixing the cake mix with the butter and pineapple juice thoroughly before placing in the slow cooker.  It didn't work for me but after reading the reviews I seem to be in the minority sooooo... good luck and happy cooking!

Made this cake last week and just love it! Very easy to make. I also had some dry spots after 2 hours but left it alone and eventually it turned out just fine.
A day later we ate the left overs cold and we thought it tasted even beter that way.

Good easy dessert.  All the criticisms of a gooey mess likely reflect the great variability of Crockpot temperatures--mine is old and tired and it took High for four hours to not be a gooey mess.

I did not care for this recipe. No flavor - it didn't even have that much aroma as it cooked. There were bites of gritty cake mix, so it obviously didn't even completely cook in the allotted time. I followed the recipe exactly.

I bet if you bake it this cake would turn out great.. In the slow cooker mine didn't come out very well. I followed the recipe exactly but it was more like a bowl of goo than cake.. Maybe it would be good over ice cream?
