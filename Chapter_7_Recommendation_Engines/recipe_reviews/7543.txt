Moist and delicious! I used an additional 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil to cut back on calories, and the cake turned out excellent.  This one will be going into my permanent recipe file!

I was really disappointed in this cake.Although very easy to make it had absolutely no flavor.I felt it was a waste of good ingredients.
