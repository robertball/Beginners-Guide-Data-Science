this recipe works best when it is not egg roll wrappers that are used. Do it the old fashioned way, with spanish ingredients, like goya wrappers that come frozen and they will come out much better. seal the edges with a fork, .. it also tastes good with cheese tucked inside, or for vegetarians cheese, beans or broccoli..

A few people mentioned substituting the egg roll wrappers (and I agree after all this is a Puerto Rican dish) for Goya's "frozen wrap or yellow thing".  The formal name is an EMPANADA.  That's the name you should look for when shopping.  Goya Tampas para Empanadas are frozen turnover patties.   Put the mix in the middle, fold, and then take your fork and seal the edges with it leaving little fork imprints along the edges. Beef is very plain tasting, don't cheat yourself....season your meat liberally with garlic powder, sazon, seasoning salt, adobo and, if on hand, you can never go wrong w/ sofrito.  Be creative and add what you like because you really can't go wrong w/ this one....it's only beef in a patty.

These are a big hit at our house. I usually roll these up eggroll fashion as I had problems with the wrappers tearing at first. Also makes them easy for the kids to eat. In addition to draining the ground beef well, be sure to have the oil hot enough when you start frying or they will soak up too much.

[10/1/04] These are also really good using ground chicken instead of ground beef!

It was time cumsuming but they were GREAT!! But being PuertoRican myself almost every dish HAS TO HAVE SA-SON! I added just one package of Sa-son with the onions and bell pepper to lock in the flavor. After I drained the meat I added Basil, Garlic Poweder, and Chili Poweder to taste! It was WONDERFUL!! This one is a keeper!

Although this was very time consuming, my kids LOVED them!!  I made a bunch and froze them for quick snacks & meals on the go.  I also used some of the meat mixture tossed with noodles and sour cream the following night for dinner.  I will definitely be making these again.

This is a great starter recipe... But I personally made a few changes.. You definitely should use the frozen empanada dough discs. They are made for meat fillings and are awesome. You should use a packet of Sa-zon and I also added a little cumin.. I added some shredded cheese when i wrapped them and only put about half of the cilantro and it was plenty. (and i love cilantro) But overall they were great!

These turned out great!  I took some of the other reviewers' advice, and made a few adjustments.  I cut down quite a bit on the cilantro.  I added cumin, oregano, chilli powder, fresh basil and a splash of lime juice to the meat, once drained.  I also used the Goya frozen Empanada discs instead of egg roll wrappers.  Very time consuming, but well worth it.  Goes great with a side of yellow rice and friend plantains.  I will definitely be making these again.  5 stars.

This recipe, if followed exactly, has too strong of a cilantro taste. Over powering even.  So I altered the recipe slightly and only added 1/4 cup of cilantro and added 1/3 cup celery to it.  It turned out great then.

These were great. Tasted alot like the inside of empanadas which are my favorite. Everyone loved them. I had to cut the cilantro in half. That was just way to much cilantro. I love cilantro but come on. and make sure the onions are chopped finely otherwise the taste is way different. I made that mistake the 2nd time

Good filing . but take the time to make the dough and press yourself...  which really warrants making alot of them at one time. Freeze them and then you have an instant snack or dinner with a quick fry.

These are good but didn't suit my husband's taste (what he's used to as a child).  I also use the yellow discs instead and seal with fork and water.  There was too much tomato paste.  This is what I usally use instead,  1 1b ground meat, 1/2 diced onion, 1/2 diced green bell pepper, 3 crushed garlic cloves, 1/8 c. chopped cilantro, 1/8 c. sliced green olives, 1 tbs tomato paste, 1 pkg sazon, salt and pepper to taste.

This was a hit at our girls day cook out!!!  Everyone was so supicious about how they would taste so, I told my girlfriend if they didn't taste good I would tell everyone that she made them :)  But, once I started hearing the comments, I quickly said I made them..I added a little lite salt, pepper and sazon for taste.  They were so good, I had to ccut them in half because they were going so fast...

These were sooo good!!!! I made them last minute for my friend's surprise Bday party and they were a hit! I only did one thing different and that was to add a cup of the cilantro instead of the 1 1/2. I will definitely make this again!

I found that the egg roll wrappers were not too great for this recipe.  There was also an overpowering cilantro taste and the tomato paste should be mixed with a teaspoon of sugar for my palet.  A little Orégano brujo (oregano), less cilantro, a patti dough recipe and sugar would please my palet more.  I'd hate to rate this as we all have different tastes however Allrecipies is prompting to do so.  I'll rate it on the other ratings as I'd hate to bring your rate down just because I'm different.

This was a different way to use ground beef.  I liked the taste.  The egg roll wrappers were so big, they needed more meat to fill.  My picky husband liked this recipe.  Required a long time to make for the mediocre results.  I would use the meat portion in a plain corn taco shells.

I really loved these, my husband who is Puerto Rican liked them but, he thought they were too saucy & greasy.            That would be my fault be sure to drain beef REALLY well!              Overall they were delicious!

I changed up the recipe, based on other reviews. So with the changes I think it turned out better than the original recipe allows. I made homemade empanada dough instead of using egg roll wrappers. I also made homemade sofrito to add to it in place of the veggies. I thought the tomato sauce and ground made it seem a little like sloppy joes, but my husband loved them, so all is well since he's the reason I tried the recipe at all. I think in the future, I'd add some hot sauce and use a shredded beef or pork instead.

Good flavor but needs a little something...maybe a dipping sauce?  I used wonton wrappers which held together nicely. My kids (ages 10, 13 & 16) LOVED them so I will definitely make again.

This is a great simple Puertorican recipe.  I added two packs of Sazon for that authentic taste.  I omitted the bell pepper because my family doesn't like it.  I think next time I will add a can of sliced black olives and also use only 1/2 a bunch of cilantro.  I used the egg roll wrappers and wrapped them like egg rolls.  They only needed to be in the oil for about 5 seconds each.

These were delicious! I could not find the Goya discs, so I used egg roll skins. They worked well. I will definately make them again.

EXCELLENT!!!  I made a trial version of these for my sister-in-law's bachelorette party.  They are so good.  I made a few changes.  I used one bunch of cilantro, and added seasoning salt, peeper, garlis salt and cumin to taste.  I also took someone's suggestion about adding cheese.

One warning:  I didn't find it poosible to wrap 2 or 3 tablespoons of meat.  I was only able to get 1 1/2 tbsp.

Hopefully the ladies will love them like me and my wife did!

These were super. I used ground lean turkey instead of beef, no fat to drain and no greasy problems with the finished rolls. I added a can of drained black beans. I did use egg roll wrappers and made sure my oil temp was  at the 360 specified. Husband and son liked them. The recipe made too many for us so I'll use again for a small gathering with margaritas, beer, layered dip etc... for a football game this fall.

This recipie was great. I add some sazon and adobo to the meat and it was good. I didnt like the taste of the egg roll wrappers too much I may shop around for a different kind but the meat was so good. I live in california and its hard to find those goya disc another person was talking about.

We thought these were great and my husband especially loved them. My egg roll wrappers were too thin for me to wrap them in traingles so I had to improvise a bit. Next time, I will use the goya discs (which I also saw in the same freezer section) as others had suggested. I served these up with Mexican rice - excellent meal! Thanks!

My Dh is Peurto Rican and the recipe is very versatile, able to add to your taste, we are able to buy the Goya discs and added Sazon.  Tasty fried little treats :)  I only gave four stars for the fact that his recipe is slightly different and we prefer it.  But Mmmm, try it!

These were pretty tasty.  I put a packet of Sazon seasoning in as another reviewer suggested.  I also used wonton wrappers.  I couldn't find the Goya discs but next time I will go to a spanish market.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I had never "stuffed" anything before so I was a little inept at first but in no time I was flying!  LOL.  I had a little dish of water on my work surface and I would just dip my finger in and use that to seal the wontons.  Just don't worry about how they look, once fried they'll look great.  Warning though, they fry up fast! Don't walk off and leave them.  This makes a lot of filling.  I ended up using well less than half for just my husband and I.  I will freeze the rest or maybe use it for something else tomorrow.

This recipe was so great!  My Dh and son loved it so much. I did not think this was a time consuming recipe.  It was easy to make and my 3 year old even helped me stuff the egg rolls, he thought that was great. We served them with sour cream guacamole and some mexican rice and they were alomost all eaten up!Next time i will add a little more garlic!

My kids and husband would not touch this.  Its a lot of work and not worth it.  The flavor of the meat was ok but like i said a lot of work for something so casual. :(

These turned out very well.  All of my boys, 18 months, 3 years, and 5 years, tried them and loved them.  My neighbor smelled me cooking and stopped by to try what smelled so good!  They both loved them too.  We did not care for them as much plain, but dipped in sour cream and salsa, they were divine.  We don't fry often, but next time, we will surely do this again.  We used wonton squares instead of egg rolls.  We have fun filling the squares with different cheese and frying them also.  Those would compliment this recipe well.

Taking the suggestions of previous reviews, (Goya wrappers & less cilantro), I made a double batch and they were amazing! My addition to this recipe was to drizzle with Siracha sauce and prior to adding the tomato sauce, I processed the meat/garlic/onion/green pepper mixture through my cuisinart to make a finer texture for the filling.

We made this to try something different and it was a hit! Even my 2.5 year old said, “yummy mmhmmm” after her first bite and ended up finishing two of them. We used the egg roll wraps and loved it.

I took the advice of other reviews and used the Goya wrappers. I ran out of Goya wrappers and used egg roll wrappers for the rest or the mixture I had left. They were outstanding and I will be making them again!  I did like the ones with the Goya a little bit better than the egg rolls though, but still outstanding.

Great variation on Puerto Rican empanadas! Empanadas aren't made from egg roll wrappers, so the dough isn't really doughy like they would be if you used the goya empanada round dough. It's different but good =)

Though this recipe includes some of the ingrediants for Puerto Rican meat pies, it  starts to go off course pretty quickly.  If this was not supposed to end up like the "real deal" that is made in the islands and you just want something that is less involved to make with a suggeston of what the flavor is suppose to be, then this may be an o.k. option.  I have NEVER had meat pies using egg roll wrappers, though and it is not the standard.

Would like to have had a few more spices but overall really good.  We put yogurt on top of it and that was good but the best was when we mixed Duck Sauce and yogurt and poured it on top!

Very good but not very simple...I used empanada shells vs eggroll shells (using a fork to seal the edges), skipped the cilantro, added celery, Sazon and my own seasonings...will be making it again (says the husband)!

I am so excited to make these tonight but I was disappointed that I couldn't find the GOYA brand wraps in the freezer section so I did have to settle on the egg roll wrappers , but hopefully they still come out delicious !

These are great appetizers!  I have an aversion to cilantro and substituted spinach and WOW!  With guacamole and salsa they were the hit at a dinner party I went to, where everyone brought something.  Thanks!
