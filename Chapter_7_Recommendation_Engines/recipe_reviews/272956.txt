These cookies didn't work too well for me. There was too much honey in them, which really overpowered the other flavors. There's also no binding agent--such as flour, eggs, or even flax meal--in which to hold everything together. So the end result was more like a loose granola than a cookie. It took a lot of smashing the ingredients together to get them to hold shape. With all that being said, I think these cookies have potential. The chocolate/tahini/sunflower seed flavor is amazing, and if you tone down the honey a bit, it would shine through so much more! With a few tweaks, I think this could be a winner. As-is though? It just doesn't really work.
