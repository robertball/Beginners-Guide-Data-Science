Chicken was moist and falling off the bone. Felt it could use more flavor. All the flavor was in the skin of the chicken and not the meat.

Very delicious. I used boneless chicken thighs and I didn't have a bullion cube so I used chicken gravy. Next time I would use less gravy and more lemon and get it Crispier. But my picky 9yr old loved it!!!
