We only made one change. We used only half the sugar. We used regular granulated sugar 1/2 cup.
When our friend from Ukraine tried it, she said it was the best she ever had.
Sometimes people give compliments... but she did return for a second helping. :)

Thank you Tania, for posting this recipe! My grandmother made this years ago and I loved it:) I was reminded of it a few days ago and thought I would try to find a recipe when I came upon yours. The texture is exactly like I remembered although I used the almond extract. Not quite like Baba's but delicious nonetheless. I had to give some away to friends because I was eating it all;) Awesome!
