Whoa, these are delightful bitefuls!  I'm only knocking down a star for the instructions.  First, there is no indication of the size of the meatballs.  I made mine into ping-pong- ball size, and I got 27.  Second, maybe I need some help with my meatball technique, but they kind of sat down in the skillet, as if they wanted to be a patty.  Perhaps some kind of paleo-approved flour would help, or some time in the fridge to firm up.  Third, the olive oil was browning too fast, so I had to finish up in the oven, about 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I'm not sure how covering the skillet would have helped them  brown.  Anyway, these had a great flavor, prepared with the listed ingredients, and I would be happy to make again, but with some thought about the method.   Thanks for the idea!

I made it with ground turkey. Therefore had to put some eggs.  Kept all the ingredients as in the recipe. Really liked rosemary in it!  Added some garlic and lots of black pepper. I shaped it like cutlets and fried it. Mmmmmm..... Turned out great! Very juicy! Hubby is happy! Thanks for the recipe !

I think I would alter this next time, the rosemary and sage we a bit too much.  Italian seasoning may be the way to go. We dipped them in the paleo garlicky tzatziki dip. Combo was delicious.

It was delicious. I actually used ground turkey and therefore had to add an egg for extra binding. I subbed out rosemary and sage with oregano and thyme since I didnâ€™t have them. Very easy awesome recipe especially if you are on the Whole 30 diet.
