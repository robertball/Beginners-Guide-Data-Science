This smoothie sure isn't pleasant to the eye but it is yummy in the tummy! I used all spinach because I did not have kale and both my banana and blueberries were frozen. I like my smoothies on the sweet side and normally have to add a packet of Truvia. This one did not need it since it was sweet enough on its own. Delicious smoothie.
