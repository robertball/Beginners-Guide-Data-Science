This was one of the best & easiest orange cheesecakes that I've ever made ! Since I didn't have any vanilla wafers on hand, I just changed the crust to graham cracker crumbs, with great results.  The cranberry orange sauce has become an all-time favorite &" go-to" basic recipe to have on hand. YUMMY !!
