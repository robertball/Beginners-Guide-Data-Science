This recipe is delicious and makes a lot! I could have cut it in half for just the two of us, but I think it will be just as good as leftovers. I had to mix everything in my Dutch oven after cooking meat on onions in my largest skillet, as the skillet wasn’t big enough to hold all the ingredients. I went heavy on the curry and cayenne since we like spicy and a bit lighter on the cinnamon and cloves. It was wonderful! I’m enjoying trying new recipes to use the bottle of curry powder I bought. Thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

This was an excellent Indian dish and very authentic! My Indian friend told me it needs cilantro but otherwise it was perfection. I served this over a bed of rice.
