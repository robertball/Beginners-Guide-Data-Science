This was great - even if I just used the mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Don't make the same mistake I did, though, only brush the oil on the crust - I added the leftover on top later and it was too oily after baking. If you have leftover oil, just throw it out...

Fabulous!  This was just delicious.  My pantry isn't very fancy so I didn't use fontina/feta and roma tomatoes, I used cheddar/mozzarella/parmesan and reg big red tomatoes.  Turned out just like I hoped it would.  Reminds me of the Margherita pizza at Wolfgang Puck's. Used with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe from this site and made one huge yummy 16" instead of two.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Loved it! I marinated my tomatoes for at least an hour, wanted to make sure they had a great garlicky taste. Added pepper on top of them, too. Used Mozz, Italian five cheese blend, some grated parm and the feta. I think my oil blend had great flavor since I let is sit for a while, brushed in all over a bobali crust. Smelled great, tasted even better. This hands down will continue to be a pizza I make... Thanks for passing it along!!

I love this pizza! The first time I ever made it I followed the recipe exactly, now I tweak it to my liking & even make mini-ones. Generally I saute some garlic and  fresh spinach in olive oil then I brush that over my crust, add fresh basil (if I have it or dried if I don't), then I add the tomatoes (I have used cherry in a pinch), shredded chicken (if I am craving it), then sprinkle it with feta & mozzarella!! Sooooo good! Everyone loves it and it is really easy to prepare...

This pizza is delicious.  I've made it several times.  I don't use fontina cheese however.  I like to use store bought PESTO and olive oil as the base (very flavorful).  I also recommend trying jarred sundried tomatoes (in olive oil & spices) instead of roma.  And after baking for 10 minutes, I broil on high for a few minutes to make it bubbley.  Tastes like the expensive brick oven pizza place, but at home!

This was amazing!  We couldn't stop eating it!  
I added marinated cooked chicken and used a boboli pizza crust.  I also added a little zesty italian seasoning  and an extra tablespoon of garlic ( we love garlic) to the tomato mixture.
Cooked on a pizza stone with fresh mozerella...yummy!  We will eat this as often as my waistline will allow!

I thought this pizza was fantastic - about as close to a "perfect" pizza as you can get. (Definately the best I've ever made.) I used a Boboli crust, and regular salt instead of sea salt because I didn't have any on hand.  The cheese combination is absolutely delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe; I'm positive I'll make this one again.

Good, but not great. Between the salt in my crust, salt in the olive oil, and in all of the cheese's, it was a little overwhelming. Like all the cheese combos, but won't follow this recipe next time I want a margherita pizza.

Wonderful recipe!  I marinated the tomatoes for about an hour.  We didn't use fontina or feta - personal preference.  I like a straight forward pizza and wanted the tomato/basil to really come through and it did.  We used pizza dough for the first time vs. pre-made shells and we can't wait to try it again.

Yummy! This is so good. I use Boboli thin crust and added pepperoni to one pizza to please my family. I didn't want to spend the money on the different cheeses so I found a shredded mix of Italian cheeses at the store, then I did add the feta. This pizza is really good warmed up as a leftover also!!

This was soooo good! I followed the recipe exactly, well, mostly.  First change: I used my homemade whole wheat crust recipe instead of Boboli.  Second change: Cooked on the grill on foil pizza pans instead of in the oven.  Poked holes in one pan to see if it would crisp up better--really, not much difference.  Great crispy crust, but the top didn't brown.  The cheese was melted though, and that was good enough for us.  Third and final change: On one of the pizzas I added onions, mushrooms and zucchini that I sliced and nuked for a couple of minutes. Oh, another change: I left out the salt.  It was not necessary.  Thank you for the recipe!

If I could rate this a ten, I would. I am kicking myself that it has taken me six months after saving this recipe to actually try it. It is amazing. I make A LOT of homemade pizza and this takes the cake. I followed the recipe to a T.  Never again will I order this at my favorite restuarant, Kona, because this recipe is sooo much better!!! I cannot thank you enough. If you are like me, and make your own crusts, and do not prebake them, heat oven to 450 and bake for 15 minutes. Truly insane!!!

I freaking love this pizza!  I've made it many different times and many different ways depending on which ingredients I have on hand: dried basil if no fresh, skipping some of the other cheeses if I only have mozzarella, adding sliced jalapenos, etc.

My biggest tip for this is to put the tomatoes UNDER the cheese rather than on top; this way the cheese can get all golden brown and crispy rather than staying soggy under the tomatoes.  At the end of the cook time, I like to broil it for 2 minutes to really get the cheese bubbly :)

This was my first attempt at making pizza at home, and this recipe was just fabulous!  I had never used Fontina cheese before, and it was excellent.  This pizza was incredible, and I didn't change a thing.  Even my boyfriend, who is really picky about pizza, said this one is a keeper!

I didn't have feta or fontina (sadly! I LOVE fontina cheese!), but I did use fresh mozzarella.  At the last minute, I brushed a little prepared pesto on the crust before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  Nice, fresh-tasting pizza!

This was excellent!  I liked the combination of cheeses. Don't even think about not using the feta.  It doesn't melt & it adds great flavor.   Be careful not to use too much garlic in the marinade!!

Very, very good and easy! Marinating the tomatoes gives an extra depth of flavor, and the oil is really flavorful. Plus, such simple ingredients! I shredded my own cheeses and added provolone just becuase I had some on hand. Also, I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe from this site.

Wow. Delicious way of making a pizza margherita, even though I started with canned tomatoes and used cheddar instead of mozzarella! It was the best pizza the co-op had ever had, and I'm definitely making it again!

This is by far my new favorite pizza.  It is so fresh and simple, yet with lots of flavor.  Initially i thought that 4 tomatoes per pizza was too much, but you really need it because there is no sauce.  I used Jay sign pizza crust and this makes a great meal!

Amazing flavor, I had some really good tomatoes from the garden center so used regular instead of plum, and I piled them on top of all the cheeses. I loved the Feta cheese adding such a nice richness to the other cheese. I didn't have Fontana but it was wonderful with the three. I made my own pizza crust and baked it directly on the grill. Will do this one again and again.

Just fantastic!  Our family ritual for many years was to order pizza every Friday night so nobody had to cook at the end of the week.  Needless to say, we all got more than a little burned out on pizza.  Sooo, when I told hubs I was making pizza for dinner, he groaned.  But this is so good, even he liked it.  Didn't change a thing.  Excellant!!

Wow was this good!!  I am not a red-sauce person, so I love Margherita pizzas because they not only are incredibly fresh tasting, but they also don't have the red sauce.  The only things I changed were using homemade crust, fresh garlic (3 cloves, would do 2 next time) and I subbed fresh mozzarella slices for the shredded and shredded Italian for the Fontina.  And unfortunately I forgot this recipe was for TWO pizzas and I was only making one, so I had double the cheese on it, which was delicious, but not necessary.  Oops.  I also didn't pre-bake the crust, which was fine, but it does take longer to bake...I think it was 20-30 minutes.  SO good.  Definitely a recipe I'll be filing away.

Love this Pizza it is Sooo Good! I tweaked it a little. I used a package of pizza dough and added rosemary, garlic and sea salt to the dough. My family including my 2 year old who is so finicky these days loved it. Make two because one won't be enough.

Y U M. We did make a few changes - used pesto, not olive oil and didn't marinate the tomato. Added cracked pepper to the pesto, a little less basil since there was already basil in the pesto, heirloom tomato (I find roma's have very little flavor) and fresh mozz cheese, not shredded. The biggest change? We used naan for the crust and it was FABULOUS!!!!

This was excellent!! The recipe is perfect! I used tomato and basil flavored Feta cheese and it added just a tiny bit more flavor to this delicious pizza! I made garlic bread as a side to go with this pizza and before baking I dipped the bread in the leftover tomato marinate, the bread turned out fantastic! Definitely a meal I will continue to make, my whole family loved it!

oh my gosh! This is the best pizza I have ever eaten. I recently got back from Italy and this beats any pizza I ever ate while visiting. I marinade the tomatoes in the garlic/olive oil mixture for maybe a half an hour. I also place the tomatoes on first to act as the base since their is no sauce. Another thing I used instead of the pre baked pizza crust is I found a french loaf roll in the dough section of the grocery store (i think pilsbury makes them). Using the french loaf dough made the pizza crust crispy and flakey. Really a great recipe

More proof that simple is better! Even modified it was excellent. I didn't have fresh basil so sprinkled some dry on.  Didn't have Fontina or Feta either, and just used mozzarella, Parmesan and some Montery Jack. Topped with fresh spinach.  Super fresh tasting and very fragrant.  Tomatoes from the garden probably help, great recipe to use those extra tomatoes in the summer!  Don't be afraid to modify this one with what you have on hand.  Now I just need a great crispy crust recipe!

This pizza is the best homemade pizza ever!  I am not good about rating recipes but I had to with this one.  This is one the best recipes I have tried on this site.  It is fresh & light tasting despite the 4 cheeses.  This is one we will try over and over again!

This pizza made a delicious dinner! I made a few changes by using pesto for the sauce. Also added some balsamic vinegar which gave it a nice sweet kick. Shredded chicken made this a little more hearty. A super easy, super delicious dinner!

Followed the directions exactly (except for marinating the tomatoes a little longer than 15 minutes).  Absolutely delicious pizza, much better than most restaurants or takeout.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious!  Made exactly as stated. Expensive...unless you have most of the ingredients on hand.  Can't wait until summer to use fresh tomatoes and basil!  Baked for 12-13 minutes on a Boboli thin crust.  Next time when I slice the tomatoes I will drain them on a paper towel for 5 minutes before adding marinade.

UNBELIEVABLE! My husband and I think this could be the best pizza we've ever had. I made my own dough and skipped the fontina because we didn't have any (added extra mozzarella instead). Made one of the pizzas up the first night and saved the remaining ingredients for the next day. I was worried about leaving the tomatoes in the marinade, but they came out extra flavorful. I was also VERY generous coating the dough with the marinade the second time around and it came out delicious. Will definitely make again.

I couldn't get Fontina & Feta at the local store, so I just used Mozarella, Parmesan & Cheddar. Turned out fantastic. Used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe from allrecipes.com too. Great stuff. The 1st time I ever made pizza (from scratch too) & it was great! :-)

Just realized I forgot to rate this recipe! I used half the recipe for only one pizza and used 1 T. olive oil instead of 2 since the leftover gets thrown away! As many other reviewers, I didn't have any Fontina cheese but I did have the feta since we Love feta cheese. This pizza is perfect for summertime! Especially if you have a small garden that includes Roma tomatoes and fresh basil ;o) Also,  I added two handfuls of fresh, wilted spinach. Can't hurt to add a few more nutrients to this flavorful pizza!

Great recipe.  Followed recipe exactly and was yummy. Only change I would make next time...maybe put the fresh basil leaves under some of the cheese?  Mine got dark...still tasted good just wasn't as pretty as shown.

This pizza is simple and is excellent.  I added pepperoni to one of the pizzas and it was really good.

My husband and I both love this pizza. I've ever used fontina because I haven't had it when I've wanted to make this, but it's still fantastic. Defiitely marinate the tomatoes, it makes it so yummy.

SO GOOD!!! I had to change recipe (to save money). I used an 8oz package or 'Italian Shred' instead of just the mozz. I omitted the Fontina cheese. Used only about 5 Roma tomatoes and that was too many (had plenty left over). With the following changes it was amazing, so I am sure it would have been even better the right way!

Made with Boboli whole wheat crust, which left it a little cardboard-ish but otherwise great.

This pizza was one of the most delicious pizzas I have ever tasted, even better than any restaurant! It was so easy to make. I used fresh basil leaves and tomatoes from my garden, and it was to die for. As in other reviews, I only used enough of the oil to coat the crusts, and drained the excess oil from the tomatoes before putting them on the pizza. I made a slight change by using an italian cheese blend (8oz) as the base, then added tomatoes, then sprinkled with feta and parm. I plan on making this over and over again! Thank you!

I've made this twice in a little over a week, and loved it both times.  Once I used my own dough, and once a pre-made crust.  It was somewhat better with my own dough--no surprise there.  I didn't use fontina.  This is easy to make, and such a fresh, juicy, cheesy, delicious pizza!  I think it's going to become a staple in our house.

A knockout. I used all the cheeses and followed the recipe nearly exactly (added just a bit more fontina and mozzarella to my family's tastes) Delicious taste and the flavors mix very well.  The only complaint I have is that when using pre-made pizza crust it tends to stick to whatever surface you prepare it onto, especially after you brush the tomato marinade onto it.  I almost had a catastrophe when I tried to transfer it from the counter to the baking sheet!  Just keep that in mind and prep the pizza on a baking sheet/stone.

Oh so good!  I made this with Jay's signature pizza crust as well.  You have to use the four cheeses listed; fontina is a must!  The pizza was actually better as leftovers the next day.

Loved this!  Not quite my husbands thing, BUT, perfect for vegetable pizza lovers.  It was very easy to make and had a lot of flavor...next time will use my wheat crust...but otherwise NOTHING to change!

I absolutely loved this recipe and my kids did too. Following the advice of another review I used Jays signature pizza crust. I do recommend cooking the crust for five minutes before adding toppings and I also cooked my pizza a little longer, about 15 minutes instead of ten. My grocery store didn't have Fontina so I just substitued it. Can't wait to make this with fresh summer tomatoes! YUMMY!

I find Margherita pizzas to be kind of blah, but not this one!  It’s a perfect blend of flavors and the Feta cheese gives it an amazing flavor boost.

Fantastic recipe.  Used a make-your-own 99 cent crust that cooks at 475 degrees for 10 minutes.  Baked for 5 minutes before adding toppings.  Didn't have Fontina so used mixed Italian cheese plus the Parmesa and the feta - the feta is a must.  Cooked for 10 minutes more.  Think adding artichoke hearts would be good addition.

This was incredible. Used a Boboli crust and tomatoes from my garden. Also used a five-cheese blend that included mozarella and some other white cheeses (but not fontina and feta. This is a keeper!

Gee, thanks Smiley1081 for the history lesson.  This is a website to share recipes and ideas, not be critical of someone's naming of a recipe.  I thought this was very good and hopefully I won't get thrown in Italian jail for drinking something other than beer with it.

Good stuff! Everyone liked it! But I added more Feta cheese because I like that cheese most :) Thanks!

I made this with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site and it was excellent! I only made one crust - but used all the ingredients as the pizza crust from the recipe was really big. SO GOOD - I didn't change anything (besides crust). Would make again and again.

Fabulous recipe.  I've been making a standard margherita pizza for several years, but this definitely takes it up a notch.  The only change I made was to leave off the fontina, didn't have any, and increase the mozarella.  I used this with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.  I made two large pizzas for my family of 4 and we devoured both of them.  WHEN I make this again, I would use fresh mozarella because I think it has much better flavor.

I love feta cheese, but I wasn't sure how I'd like it on a pizza.  This recipe, however, was fabulous!  This pizza was far better than any takeout pizza I can get around here.  Even my son, who doesn't like feta cheese, thought this pizza rocked!  I used a Boboli crust (baked it at 450 degrees per the Boboli instructions) and skipped the fontina because I didn't have any, but it was still a delicious pizza.  I'll definitely try the fontina in the future to see if it makes this pizza even better.

This was a very good pizza.  I made the following changes.  I did not use fontina cheese, I could not find it otherwise I would have tried it.  I only put a very little bit of  Olive Oil and it still seemed too oily.  Overall the flavor was excellent, this will be made again!

This is GREAT!  I might try putting the fresh basil on in the last 5 minutes of cooking because it turns dark, but the taste is still there!  Such a great pizza!  I wouldn't change a thing in the ingredients.

Made this for the first time tonight.  Flavor I thought was great and prep was easy.  Would recommend however less tomatoes or picking smaller romas. Additionally, I think it is important to drain the tomatoes well as my crust seemed a bit on the soggy side.  Will make this again though!

This has always been my very favorite pizza and this recipe is GREAT!  I can get an upset stomach from too much garlic, so I substitute 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt for the 1/2 teaspoon sea salt and don't use the tablespoon of minced garlic - you still get plenty of flavor and no bad breath!  I also use reduced fat feta cheese and don't use the fontina cheese to save a few calories and it still turns out absolutely wonderful - just like I have had at restaurants!

I made this in a pinch for my husband and father-in-law. We all LOVED it. My husband was actually upset when I sent some leftovers to my mom. One thing I like to do with the second crust is to use the included sauce packet, then top with the cheeses; chop the tomato mixture and finely shred the basil. Then you have two slighty different and delicious pizzas. Definitely keeping this recipe on hand...

This was good, but a little bland.  It might be because I could not find Fontina cheese.  I thought it could have used a little more taste.  Husband liked it, though.

Really wonderful flavor on this pizza. Light and fresh tasting. I coated  sliced fresh mushrooms with the olive oil/garlic mix and then added them to the pizza too. This has a beautiful presentation.

I used this recipe as a simple base: I chopped Roma tomotoes and mixed with olive oil, salt, minced garlic, and pepper. Then chopped up one ball of fresh buffalo mozzarella per pizza crust (we used thin). Spread everything evenly over the crust and sprinkled with fresh basil leaves, then baked. SO GOOD!

Great recipe.  Didn't have fontina or feta, but it was great without it.  I let my tomatoes marinate for hours, and included a splash of black cherry balsamic vinegar.  I also added the minced garlic to the pizza after marinating - that seemed a bit overwhelming (still good though!)

Excellent! Crispy, garlicy and wonderful. Fontina cheese costs a lot and I left it off for that reason. Followed recipe otherwise and it was great and easy to do.

My family and I made this on whim this weekend and we were all very impressed with the result. It was delicious and so fresh! We used fresh cheeses and basil and the refridgerated pillsbury pizza dough. We didn't have any left overs! We will be making this again for sure.

Stick to the recipe! The Fontina cheese is expensive ($9.39 a lb.) in my neck of the woods but it's worth it and has a much different flavor and smoother texture than other cheeses.  This is infinitely better than those pizzas that start with some variation of jarred white sauce.

Starting to make my own pizzas lately. I used this recipe but altered it. I didn't have any fresh basil, or the fontina cheese or feta. I used a shredded pizza mix cheese. Marinated the tomatoes the same and Used a whole wheat pizza crust. I also added left over veg like olives and mushrooms. It came out great. I will say brushes the pizzas with the marinade makes it a bit oily. So I cut it back. Good pizza recipe will use again.

the garlicky tomatoes are really good. Nice to find a white pizza recipe that does not use ricotta as my husband does not like ricotta Made my own crust but I know not everyone will do that!The nice thing is that you can play with this a bit too. I didn't have any Feta cheese on hand/did have Cheddar so I just subsituted cheddar for the feta. My only other addition is to add a sprinkle of oregano on it. My family loves  oregano on their pizza.

Delicious! I used smoked fontina cheese slices and it gave the pizza a great flavor! Made for a party and got many complements. No need to add extra salt to tomato marinade. There is enough salt in pizza crust and cheese.

WOW!!  This was EXACTLY what I was looking for!  I was a little worried because I used veggie cheese (a mozzarella/parm blend) instead of the mozzarella and fontina called for.  And I used fat-free feta.  I was willing to trade off some flavor for less fat & calories--but I didn't have to--it was FANTASTIC!  Will make this again and again.  Made it with homemade whole wheat pizza crust recipe from allrecipes.com.  THANK YOU!!!

This is great.  I made it using 3 of the 4 cheeses as I didn't have any Fontina cheese.  I use fresh sliced tomatoes on pizza often, but I never thought to marinate them before. I used a mini-strainer to drain away the excess oil/tomato juice and used all the little bits of garlic.   The cheese combination is a nice blend, and it looks different than a mozzarella-only pizza. I'll be sure to try it with Fontina too in the future.

I made several changes to the recipe only because I didn't have all the ingredients, or access to them because I live overseas. I used plain salt, not sea salt, regular tomatoes, dried basil, and mozzarella, white cheddar and parmesan cheese. I loved the idea to marinate the tomatoes, I think that really helped the flavor! I probably actually marinated them for an hour. I followed the instructions pretty closely, using the mozzarella first, then the tomatoes, then cheddar, basil and parmesan on top. I forgot to pre-bake the pizza crust, so it got a little soggy in the middle but it was ok. Another review mentioned making sure the juice was all drained out of the tomato slices, which helped it not be too soggy. I'm sure the pizza would be absolutely delicious just as the recipe was written, I just couldn't get all those cheeses. The variation I made was wonderful and I will be making it again!

I LOOOVED this and would give it 5 stars, but my husband didn't like it much at all.  I used homemade dough, skipped the fontina because it was too expensive, and it was still wonderful.  I also used dried basil rather than fresh - again, because fresh was too expensive.  I don't feel like these minor changes hurt the recipe at all.  The tomato marinade brought out such a great flavor.  I'd make this again and again if I had someone to help me eat it!

Delicious recipe! We loved this recipe, it was simple, quick and easy. We plan to use this a lot in the future.    Important elements to have:  *Well marinated tomatoes *Fresh Basil *Variety of cheeses

Delicious! Be sure to not skimp on the tomatos as I did the first time. Overlap the tomatos a little, not spread out as in the picture. I will make this often.

DELICIOUS! I didn't have fontina so I replaced it with additional mozzarella. I used the Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough recipe from this site (prebake for 15 minutes before topping). We have never made a better pizza at home than this. For those who commented on a soggy pizza make sure your tomatoes are roma. They are more firm and "meaty" with less water. Also make sure you are brushing on the marinade and not pouring the whole thing on. You should have marinade left over.

This pizza is awesome! I have made it twice. Once with the fontina (which is a little spendy at my grocery store) and once with out it. Both times it was great! My husband is a meat and potato guy and he really likes it. For the crust, I used  the stuff that comes in those pop cans (where you find the biscuits and cinnamon rolls) it turns out really yummy!

My new favorite pizza!  I made a few adjustments based on what I already had in my cupboard.  I halved the recipe to feed 3 people.  I used a full 8 ounce package of a 6-cheese italian blend instead of the mozzarella and fontina cheeses.  I also used a heavy sprinkling of basil leaves from my spice rack rather than fresh basil leaves.  I had four roma tomatoes available but I sliced them thin so I couldn't even fit 3 on my pizza.  I am going to use the remaining sliced tomatoes that are already covered with garlic and oil to make bruschetta tonight (I will also use the leftover cheeses from the pizza). I followed someone else recommendation of broiling (only for about a minute and a half) after I baked for 10 minutes.  This made the pizza a little crispier than I prefer.  I think if my pizza crust was thicker, this would have worked better.  Still, it was delicious!!!!

This pizza is delicious!  I used a trader joe's pizza dough, cooked it for 15 minutes @ 400degrees.  Then I added the toppings as outlined in the recipe and baked for 15 minutes @ 450 degrees.  Because the cheese still had not yet browned, I put it under the broiler for about 10 minutes until it was a nice golden color and bubbly.  I will make this again for sure!  Thanks Michelle for the recipe.

Good, simple pizza. Me, I'm an avid pizza fan and would rather make my crust from scratch, such as using Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe, as part of the adventure. I also prefer not to add salt to this recipe as there's plenty already in the cheeses. I added a couple pinches of ground anise seed and coarse black pepper on top which worked excellent. I always have best results by using a pre-heated pizza stone with either pre-made or scratch crusts. Pre-bake fresh dough crust for a few minutes prior to topping and finishing in the oven.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  I cut the salt in half and did not spread the crust with the tomato marinade based on previous reviews.  Even though I shook the marinade off of the tomatoes before placing them on the pizza, they still made the crust soggy.  However, the overall taste of the pizza was very good.

Way too greasy and salty! I love grease and salt but this was overkill. If I ever make this again, I'll probably use less than 1/2 the recommended oil and no salt. What was weird was that the first slice right out of the oven was good but when I ate the 2nd slice it was logged with oil. Sorry, not for me.

Tried this recipe today...for my fussy toddler who does not eat vegetables...This pizza turned out to be so good..that he ate his entire share...I only had parmesan and mozzrella cheese, but it still turned out to be a big HIT. I also, tweaked this recipe for 4 servings, but the measurements were just perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Classic flavors that I love, but the addition of feta takes it to another level.  This is great summer pizza when you have lots of basil and fresh tomatoes. Thanks for sharing!

Did a homemade pizza crust using my bread machine then flattened out on a pizza pan. Baked for 10 minutes then added the toppings just as described and baked another 15 minutes. AMAZING! I have never written a review before, but I had to write one about this because I hate tomatoes and I loved it! My kids (who also hate tomatoes) gobbled it up. I didn't have the Fontina cheese. I also sauteed some mushrooms in olive oil and added them, which was delicious.

This was fantastic!  I cut the recipe in half, but forgot to halve the marinade for the tomatoes and I'm glad I did!  The tomatoes were incredibly good!  I think I could have used less tomatoes than what was called, as I had extras.  I would probably use 2-3 tomatoes for a half recipe next time.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Michelle!

I used spinach instead of basil leaves and left out the Fontina, added some pampered chef parmesan italian seasoning on a Boboli thin crust pizza dough.  Baked it on my Emile Henry pizza stone for 10 minutes, and this turned out amazing first try.  Thanks!

This is so good.  The marinated tomatoes with the garlic are wonderful.  I have made this many times since I first found it here and I do sometimes cheat with the cheeses.  We live in a small town and fontina is just not always available.  It is still  wonderful!

AMAZING! I made this for my boyfriend and he wouldn't stop raving about it. He said it was like "restaurant quality". It is SO EASY to make and there is so much flavor! I served mine with a homemade Greek salad (chunks of cucumber, tomato, and red onion) and a glass of pinot grigio! YUM!

Excellent recipe.  I added black pepper to the tomato marinade and let them marinade in the fridge for a couple hours.  I used home-made crust--prebake for a few minutes, brush with marinade, and then top with tomatoes.

YUMMM!!!! Incredibly tasty as is, but I also experimented a bit as I had a few other things in my fridge to get rid of. I sauted some leftover spinach in a little olive oil and added that to the pizza when I added the tomatoes. I also brushed pesto on half of the crust while sticking to the olive oil marinade on the other half. My husband liked the pesto half even better, but it depends how strong you want the taste! I didn't have fontina cheese, and it was still delicious. DEFINITELY a keeper!

Wonderful pizza!  We make this with a pre-made crust and do add a thin layer of marinara sauce first.  We generally add feta cheese that has been flavored with tomatoes and basil (pre-packaged that way) and it is great.  Occasionally, we will add sliced red onions.  You really can't go wrong with this recipe...and just customize when you want :o)

I did love this recipe - however - next time I would put a layer of EVOO down first - to give it more crispness ( I don't have a stone, etc).

Very good!  I liked the added semi-salty bite of the feta cheese.  This is a keeper! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Ok, I hate cooked tomatoes. I even toyed around with adding them after the pizza was out of the oven, but I stayed the course and followed the directions. If it weren't for a glut of fresh mozz, feta and tomatoes, I wouldn't have even tried it. I am so glad I did! Finger-lickin' nummy! As one reviewer noted, pre-made crusts are spendy, so we made our own. I am surprised any of the tomatoes made it to the pizza though. I marinated them while the dough rose which gave me ample time to pick at them (yum!)and I even saved the leftover oil to find some use for because it was soooooo yummy. The one fatal flaw was the sogginess. Someone suggested draining the tomatoes, but then you would be without marinade. Maybe next time I will add them at the end and see if that helps.

This was AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly but I used the Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this sight, but baked it for 5 minutes before topping. Also, with the crust, I made one big pizza instead of two. This was by far the best pizza I have ever tasted.

I made this recipe last night. It was excellent! My tomatoes marinated longer than the recipe recommended. Mine marinated 45 minutes. That was the only change I made.

This pizza was excellent.  I made my own crusts with "Jays Signature Pizza Crust" recipe.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  The cheeses, tomato, and basil were the perfect combination. The whole family loved it!

This turned out great! I only used mozzarella, feta, and Parmesan, because I didn't have fontina.  It was still really good.  I also found that I didn't need quite that many Roma tomatoes.  I used Jay's signature crust, but scaled it down to use rapid rise pizza crust yeast, and it made a very nice thinner crust.  I think the thinner crust makes the flavors pop more.

I used this recipe primarily for the garlic sauce recipe, but I also loosely followed the recipe for the pizza.  I only had five-cheese Italian blend cheese on hand and used that instead of the listed cheeses.  I would give this recipe 5 stars just based on the olive oil sauce alone.  It really makes a fantastic pizza.

Very good & fairly easy too...since I bought my pizza dough from Trader Joes--along with the fontina & mozzarella cheeses.  I marinated the tomatoes a few hours longer.  The first pizza was good, but, the second one I took the extra chopped garlic out of the marinate with a slotted spoon and sprinkled over top of pizza---thought the 2nd pizza was even yummier.  My pizza'a took about 18-20 min. to bake.

This was REALLY good.  I made it on Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site.  The Fontina cheese was a little hard to find, (I found it with the gourmet cheeses in a wedge, not grated) but the combination of four cheeses with the tomatoes and fresh basil was really good.  I will definitely make this one again.

delicious! The tomatoes well marinated were the key. I would use more fresh basil next time than what's called for. I also had some italian sausage left over from day before's breakfast so added slices of it to this recipe (it's a great base to build from if you prefer a pizza with toppings). Will definately make again.

This is very good and easy.  Recently added some jalapeno chicken sausage and it was good.  The only thing is the fresh tomatoes makes it watery so I use less tomatoes.  It is still delicious.  Thank you Michelle!

Yep, it's that good! I made as described except I bought fresh whole wheat dough at Whole Foods and baked it for 20 minutes before proceeding with this recipe.   I think it would be just fine without the fontina though... but don't skip out on the feta. YUM!   Thanks for an awesome pizza!

This was terrific!  I marinated the tomatoes in the garlic oil for a good half hour and used goat cheese instead of feta (I find feta salty and like it in tiny portions!) and this was fantastic!  I put the pizza on the oven rack and the crust got nice and crispy and the garlic flavor!  Molto Bene!!!

I love Margherita pizza so I was anxious to try this.  The marinated tomatoes were fabulous.  I had a few left, plus the marinade, which I used the next day mixed with broccoli...yummy!  I only used Mozzarella and shredded Parmesan (hence the 4 stars) but otherwise everything else was per your recipe.  The smartest thing I did before I made it was to buy a pizza stone.  What a difference that made in the crust!  It was the best pizza I've ever made.

Loved this recipe and it was very easy. Don't use to much of the tomato mix on the shells because it becomes overly wet.  Also needed a little spicing up so used a pinch of hot pepper flakes....family loved it

I skipped the fontina. Tried another recipe with fontina recently and we didn't care for it. But otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely and it was a big hit with my wife and daughter, and I thought it was pretty good, too.

This was the best tasting pizza I have ever had! Just amazing flavors! The only thing I did differently was use fresh olive oil and garlic to spread on the crust, for my left over olive oil (mixed with tomatoes) had juices from the tomatoes in it, making it runny.

Fantastic! My husband and I LOVE Margherita Pizza, we order it all the time. I v'e made it before, but with the olive oiled, roma tomatoes, it just has a better flavor. I didn't use 4 cheeses, but kept everything else the same. out of this world!

Delicious. I used fresh mozzarella cut in thin slices and extra garlic. I didn't have any fontina cheese but this was still really good without it.

Great recipe! Instead of using whole basil leaves, I added finely chopped up basil to the oil marinade which is used as the pizza's sauce. Then I added whole spinach leaves to the pizza. I used only shredded mozzarella and feta cheese. This tasted exactly like the pizza I got from a little place in San Diego, CA. =]

How simple and DELICIOUS this recipe is... I used only mozzarella, cause that's all I had, added a bunch more basil (personal preference) and it was absolutely A M A Z I N G.

All the excellent reviews made me want to try this recipe, and I am glad I did. It is an awesome pizza. I used home made pizza dough and omitted the fontina cheese (didn't have any). After assembling the pizza, I had some leftover tomato marinade, so drizzled it over the pizza which intensified the garlic flavour. Thanks for the recipe, Michelle.

This is amazing! I just used mozzarella, parmesan & feta cheese. The feta really adds great flavor. I had some leftover tomato/garlic marinade so I brushed the crust with it, that gave the crust a nice crunch. I also broiled it for a few seconds at the end. Best homemade pizza I have ever tried!

This pizza is awesome! I used a Boboli crust, and also I bought feta cheese that was already flavored with tomato & basil, for added flavor. The cheese combo was really good. I used regular salt (but just a little) instead of sea salt. This cooked up really nicely, but it was really oily. I had to sop up all the oil with paper towels. Next time I think I won't put the tomato marinade on the crust. The tomatos are oily enough, even after you squeeze the oil out. The flavor of the pizza was so good....definitely a keeper! My husband and I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow.

Oh my goodness.  This was great. My whole family enjoyed it very much.  I had some fresh basil but by the time I went to use it it was no good but dried basil worked in the pinch.  The only other thing I didn't have was the fontina so I added shredded romano and it was wonderful.  Oh yeah, I also added shredded chicken that I poached with garlic podwer, thyme, and rosemary.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Will def make again.

I have made this pizza several times now and it's always a hit.  As a variation, I put some chicken on it (I use frozen fajita chicken to keep it simple), and the hubby loves it.  The Fontina cheese is a bit pricey (although, my Walmart has started carrying it, so not so bad anymore) and I've been tempted to try other cheeses that other reviewers have mentioned.... but have been too afraid to mess with perfection!

The flavor was fantastic and it was nice and gooey and cheesy.  Just FYI- I froze the second pizza to make later, and it wound up being really watery when I baked it.  Perhaps if I had thawed it before baking?  At any rate, it still tasted good.

DELICIOUS! I made two, one exactly to the recipe specs minus feta (forgot to grab at the store) and a 2nd adding onions, green peppers and mushrooms. BOY OH BOY.....both pizzas were excellent! This recipe is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I reduced the servings to 4, but kept the olive oil & garlic at 8 servings to have enough liquid to coat the tomatoes.  We like basil, so I also kept the basil at the 8 serving level. Instead of  shredded Fontina cheese, I used slices of Provolone. The base was zesty Italian flatbread.

One of the best pizzas I've made! It's definitely restaurant quality. I had to go with dried basil, but it would be much better with fresh! I used TJoe's pizza dough and their four-cheese blend. It didn't have feta in it so I also added a little of that. I used regular tomatoes, 1 1/2 for a 12" pizza. The Roma would have held up much better. I did squeeze most of the marinade from the tomatoes which didn't help in keeping their shape. I also added most of the garlic pieces to the pizza which made it so delicious! Thanks - this is a definite keeper! UPDATE 2/9/18: Used the recommended Roma tomatoes, and they kept their shape much better than regular ones. I only used two Romas for a 12" pizza. I scaled the recipe down to 2 tblsp olive oil. That amount worked great - hardly any wasted oil.

DELICIOUS!!! I made it with Pillsbury pizza dough. I baked the dough first and then added the topping and cooked as instructed. It tasted even better when the crust gets really crispy. A new family favorite and a great appetizer.

I had a Culinary project and chose this because it sounded delicious, and my family loves pizzas! It turned out really good, though I do wish that the cheese melted a little bit better. The crust was crunchy, the tomatoes blended well in the pizza, and the cheeses blended together for a savory, awesome flavor. One tip I used was to brush the crust with oil, and let it sit for a minute. That really worked well, and gave the crust a nice flavor. A tip I would use is instead of slicing and placing the tomatoes on top, I diced them, and placed them on top, diced. Some of the tomatoes sank in the cheese, and the juices flowed out in the cheese, giving it a nice flavor, and it makes it easier to bite into the pizza, rather than huge tomato slices.

Made with frozen pizza dough, otherwise followed directions exactly.  Took 12-13 min to cook.  Used one clove of garlic, did not experience any raw garlic intensity.  Overall really excellent, would make again.

This was just awesome! I was a bit worried since my boyfriend and I have never had pizza without marinara, but this just changed our view on it completely! It had a perfect garlic flavor, and we and our roommates loved it. If you have a hard time locating Fontina cheese (we did as our grocery store didn't have it) try Muenster!

Delicious! Didn't use garlic. I ground an Italian Blend Seasoning plus  a few shakes of Oregano in to the olive oil and let that "stew" for a while before brushing on to the crust. I only made one pizza.

I just made this for our NYE dinner.  Wow!  I would give 5 stars; however it was various tips from other reviews that elevated the pizza to 5 stars. I hate to be " one of those reviewers" who change a recipe and comment on how great it is, but I must.  1) NEVER use pre-baked store bought crust...it ain't homemade pizza!  Like many others I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust...I pre-baked it for 10 minutes before adding toppings.  Best crust ever!  2) I used 8 Roma tomatoes from Costco.  After slicing I placed between paper towels to drain, then I marinated for 45 minutes.  3) while tomatoes marinated, I raised my top oven rack to top, fired up oven, put my stone in and heated the stone for 45 minutes.  Makes a better crust!  4) I strained the marinade and put the tomatoes in a bowl.  Made it easier to brush marinade on crust.  5) use all the tomatoes!!  I used Asiago (couldn't find fontina) and mozzarella on first, then tomatoes, basil, Parmesan and feta in that order.  6). I baked pizza at 400 for 15 minutes.  I let it rest on cutting board for 5 minutes before slicing.  Bottom line...my kids ate 5 slices each!  We cut small slices and they even ate tomatoes!  If you take the time to make your own crust, preheat stone, and marinate tomatoes longer, it is THE best pizza ever!!!

Just made this for dinner and it was excellent!  The combination of cheeses was perfect and I had just enough tomatoes for the 2 pizzas.  Prep time was about 20-30 mins, cook time 10 mins. We will definitely be making this again!

Super Easy and Super Tasty! I made this for my boyfriend and I but ended up sharing it with my roommates too. One of my roommates actually thought I picked it up from somewhere it was so good. 

Unfortunately when I was shopping for supplies the market I go to was out of fresh basil leaves, but dried basil worked just as well.

Also budget wise it was totally in the broke college student range... so I just ended up buying a pre-made crust. 

You might end up with a lot of extra cheese that you can sprinkle into other food. :)

Would make again. 5/5

Okay I did have to change this some because I didn't have fresh basil and I didn't want dried so instead of marinating the tomato in olive oil I used some pesto as my base. I then layered on sliced grape tomatoes, fresh mozzarella slices, the crumbled feta and shredded parmesan cheeses, didn't have any Fontina. One thing for sure was DRAIN most of the oil off the pesto if you use it. My pizza was sort of swimming in olive oil but other than that the taste was amazing. My older son would have like it even more with extra Feta, as he loves that cheese. My mom who is Mrs. "It's too spicy, I can't eat spicy!" said it was too bland. 'What'? And my younger son wouldn't touch either pesto or fresh tomatoes with a 10 foot pole anyway. Fortunately I had 3 crusts so they got their sausage and pepperoni pizzas too but I was looking for something besides the usual meat and tomato sauce taste. I would definitely make it again with the fresh basil and Fontina or with Basil pesto that's been drained of most of the oil. All in all an excellent recipe. Thanks Michelle.

this pizza is one of the best homemade pizzas ive ever experienced, we used all fresh ingredients from our garden, making the flavors pop! there was a strong taste of garlic and basil which blended beautifully. definitely a crowd pleaser, great for any party, the best hands down.

Wonderful recipe. I used freshly made XL crust which I baked 6 minutes first, and also used fresh mozzarella because that's what I had on hand, with Parmesan on top, no feta or fontina on hand so left that out. Our garden had several kinds of heirloom tomatoes so I sliced three different ones and alternated between red/striped/yellow tomatoes and it was beautiful. Since the tomatoes were really juicy the baking time was longer, about 20 minutes total, plus I increased the oven temp to 425 degrees. The end result was stunningly delicious. Also, don't discard the extra olive oil marinade! Use it to dress your side salad or avocado slices served with the pizza. Thanks for the recipe, we will be making this one again and again!

I loved this pizza!! I didn't have fontina cheese on hand but don't think I missed it at all. I added a little bit more garlic than called for and let it marinate with the tomatoes for 1/2 hour. I will definitely make it again.

Thought This Recipe Was Awesome!
I Think "I" Got A Little Heavy Handed With The Salt And Garlic.
But I Will Be Making This Again For Sure.
My First Home Made Pizza (Still A Learning Curve With The Dough, 
I Like Mine Thin). But I Am Very Happy With This Recipe.
Thank You From Florida!!

This pizza was awesome! I made it last night. I did change it, simply because I wanted it to taste more like the expensive fire oven pizza place we have near me, so instead of making this a 4 cheese pizza, I only used fresh mozzarella, not shredded. It was so good! I soaked the tomatoes for more than 15 minutes...it was closer to an hour. I was suprised at how flavorful and moist they were. Other than the cheese, I followed this recipe exactly. Thank you for this recipe!

Marinating the tomatoes with the garlic in olive oil was incredible...my 11yo commented how good it was this morning after we had this for dinner last night. A definite keeper! (even tho we used already-made pizza dough)

This turned out really good!.. I actually had a bunch of frozen naan bread my mom had given me and it was wonderful; only had 3 cheese blend (no feta) which was ok since the kids may have not liked it.  I sliced up some spinach on top along with basil, onion, red bellpepper and grape tomatoes.   Yummylicious!

This pizza was amazing, way better than any other pizza I've made. I'm also cooking for a very picky veggie eater. I served this pizza with Italian Sausage Soup and it was a delicious hit across the board. I didn't make any changes except that when I was choosing my cheeses I chose a Combination pizza cheeses that are by the specialty cheeses in a deli tub. There was even a King Soopers brand, delicious. I also used feta. Downside: Total meal cost $30.. those Biboli pre-made crusts are $5.50 each upping the price of this easy dinner.

I made this pizza last week. I did 1/2 the recipe since there were just 2 of us and it was the best pizza we have ever had!  I used Pillsbury thin pizza crust and cooked it for 8 minutes and then added the toppings.  Perfection!

Delicious! I will be making this again and again. Tried to stay as close to the original recipe as possible but didn't have any Fontina cheese or Roma tomatoes so I substituted vine ripe tomatoes (removed the center to avoid getting too soggy as one reviewer noted). Cooked till cheese started to brown. Seasoned with cracked pepper.

I didn't want to grate my own fontina, so I used a pre-grated blend of fontina and parmesan. Also, the person before me grabbed the last fresh basil so I used dried. The pizza came out great!

I made this tonight after my two sons requested this kind of pizza. I had never had this kind before. HOLY PEPPERONI! Do yourself a favor and make this! Followed this recipe to the T. Turned out so good they ate it standing at the island WITHOUT plates. If that’s not testimony of how good it is, I don’t know what is!

First time posting here.  Second time making this dish. First time used store bought crust, this time I made my own crust from another recipe on here.  For me, that made it 5 stars.  Simply delicious.

I didn’t have Fontina on hand so I used what I did have... blue cheese. Tasted fantastic just in case you were wondering. Also, I somehow forgot to prebake the crust so I let it bake for 20 minutes and it was perfect!

The feta adds such a nice saltiness that I love! It’s such a fantastic meatless pizza. My family says it could be served in any restaurant!

This is simply delicious. One of the best homemade margherita pizza we've ever made. Used Boboli thin crust, and one 8oz Italian blend shredded cheese(Fontina,mozzarella,parmesan,asiago) per pizza along with feta and. grated parmesan. Yummy!

The first pizza I made was very wet because I veered from the recipe. I used fresh sliced moz and didnt marinade tomatoes.
The second one I only changed the garlic to rough chopped and increased it and the basil for my family's tastes. It got voted in the rotation list for taste and it's EASY.
The 3rd one i made I added shredded Swiss Chard to the basil. Also, delish

I used cherry tomato halves from my garden, Fontina instead of Feta & a Boboli thin crust. This was excellent, but next time I will use only  1/8 cups of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of minced garlic & 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Otherwise, it is as good as any Margherita Pizza I've ever had. (I pretty much cut out real salt years ago, so it may be my own taste, but it just seemed far too salty & I  had to soak up lots of oil from the top after cooking, not to mention that it dripped off in the oven, so less oil)

Thank you for a wonderful recipe - I made this tonight and we just loved it!   My changes were minimal:  I didn't add salt to the olive oil and garlic, I used fresh whole wheat pizza dough, I didn't have any fontina cheese, and I used fresh, ripe tomatoes from my garden instead of roma.  I added the basil (also from my garden) to the pizza before baking as directed, but added a little extra fresh basil just before serving.  It really was delicious and not a morsel left - we will be making this again and again!

Amazingly delicious! I have also added small bites of chicken breast stir fried with italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Thank you so much for such a delicious pizza recipe. I use with Chef Rider's quick and easy pizza crust recipe posted on Allrecipes.

This  turned out great! The only thing is that I had a lot of leftover tomatoes about 4 and I only started with 7. Other than that I used a blend of cheeses and didn't use feta.

INCREDIBLE!!! I'm so glad that I found this recipe. I was looking for vegetarian meals and something different than what we always eat, when I came across this. I was hesitant, especially since I don't tend to like a lot of tomatoes. But this recipe is incredibly delicious. My boyfriend who loves meat even enjoyed this dish, along with my family. Definitely my new favorite food.

*I didn't use fontina though, because I couldn't find it at the store.

Making again the next day - so good!  We wanted a super thin crust so used thicker tortillas instead of pizza crust and threw on the grill over low heat for about 5 minutes.

The pizza itself was amazing! However next time I would use a homemade dough since the store bought pre-baked one down graded the whole thing.

This recipe is awesome - I've made it many times and it always gets rave reviews.  I try to marinate the tomatoes at least 30 minutes.   I've never used Fontina cheese (can't find it) and I've only used feta a few times.  I don't think it really adds anything.  I make individual pizzas using Stone Baked Naan breads from Costco. Yummy!

The tomato marinade made this recipe.  I didn't have fresh basil so I put dried basil in the marinade and used cherry tomatoes from my garden, cut in half.  I did marinate them for quite some time while waiting for guests to arrive.  Used Flat-out pizza bread for the crust but followed the recipe directions for assembling the pizza.  It was a great hit!  Will make again!  Thanks for the recipe.

By far one of the best pizzas I've had in a while. I used a pre-made thin crust and used cheddar cheese instead of fontina only due to what I had available at home. It also took almost no time to prepare. Highly recommend.

The only thing I omitted was the salt, it does NOT need it.  The cheeses have plenty.  I didn't precook the pizza crust, but it did need a few more minutes than usual because of the heavy cheese.  I used tomatoes from the garden and just put as many as I wanted.  I doubled the garlic because I love it.  I think this would be just as good without the feta, maybe because I'm not a huge fan of it.  Never used fontina cheese before...it's fun to try new things!

This was excellent! I didn't have feta this time but will the next time. I used reduced calorie mozzarella and my family still loved it!  Even my vegetable picky granddaughter liked it!

This is very tasty. My grocery store is not cool enough to have all these types of cheese but I bought a mixed bag that had most. My husband cant stop stealing the tomatoes out of the bowl when they are marinating.

Oh my goodness! I LOVED it! Followed the recipe with the exception of not having fontina cheese (used extra mozzarella instead), but I will try to get some for next time. Some people say they also left off the feta, but that was part of what made it amazing! Go for the fancy cheese, it's worth it!

This was decent, but I think a lot of it depends on the pizza crust you use and I wasn't really a fan of the one I got (Mama Mary's). I only made one pizza, but I used only 2 and 1/2 tomatoes instead of 4. I left out the salt and fontina and just sprinkled on some of the basil we keep in the spice rack. The feta didn't really melt much, I'm not sure if it was supposed to or not, but I was kind of disappointed by that aspect. Not sure if I will make it again or not.

Fun time with my wife drinking some wine and making this dinner.  Was as good as the restaurant versions. I expect the choice of pizza crust is important.  It's worked out. .. was thin and crispy.  And our selection of tomatoes was limited but it was still very tasty.

Very simple recipe with excellent results. I used a pre-made whole wheat pizza crust. I followed the directions but tweaked them just a pinch:I sauteed the garlic in olive oil over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes, then poured that over the roma tomatoes and I let them marinate for about 20-25 minutes. I used a mix of fontina cheese, italian blend shredded cheese, and parmesan cheese. I didn't use a pizza stone, I just put it right on the oven rack because we prefer a crispier crust. Do yourself a favor and make this tonight!

The pizza is delicious. Although 8 Roma tomatoes is way to much unless you like soggy pizza.We added some grilled chicken to one pizza and left the other as the recipe is written.

Absolutely delicious and restaurant-quality! Due to our budget, we only used mozzarella and freshly grated parmesan, but it was so good!Also used homemade crust (Jay's signature from this site, partially cooked first. Can't wait to make again and excited for tomorrow's leftovers!

The pre bought crust ruins this recipe as far as I'm concerned. I tried again 1 time with rhodes frozen bread dough and another with my home made recipe and everyone gobbled it up. I guess my friends and family like Chicago style thicker more tender crusts. Topping part of recipe was great. Thanks!

DELICIOUS! I had to use cheeses I had on hand. I have always liked red sauce on a pizza but the tomato slices worked beautifully and will make this again and again.  The cheeses I used were Mozzarella, Asiago, shredded, and grated Parmesan cheese.  For toppings, I added pepperoni slices, black olives and marinated artichoke hearts. The Asiago tended to clump up but the flavor was fabulous, so would use again.  I will use Fontina and Feta cheeses next time. Thanks, Michelle, for this wonderful pizza recipe!
I did add the marinated tomatoes to the crust first.  Put toppings next....

try in the oven. make as directed. try to marinate tomatoes longer. Try with grilled pizza dough on grill.
