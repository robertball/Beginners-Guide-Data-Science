I used a Magic Bullet and did batches of 1 cup each.  It took about a minute per batch and the consistency and taste is exactly that of store-bought confectioner's sugar.  Absolutely brilliant - will use every time from now on!  PS - Someone below asked why there is cornstarch in it.  It is because that is how confectioner's sugar is made and it will affect the outcome/consistency of your icing, etc. if you leave out the cornstarch.  It is a necessary ingredient.

Used 1 cup of white sugar & 2 Tbsp. Potato Starch in a coffee grinder & was done in less than 30 seconds. Have used it many times. I cant have corn so I use the potato starch, thats what powdered sugar was originally made with anyways. Turns out perfect every time, makes great icing.

Yes you can make your own powdered sugar! I find it's easier to do in smaller batches in a smaller cup. I'm not sure why there is cornstarch added to this, though, it's not necessary.

I ran out of powder sugar, so I thought this is a good time to try this out. Well I am 30 min into this and I am not even close. I don't know of I should give up or continue just to see what happens. My machine and the sugar are both hot so for now its just going to sit.

Use a blender in small batches and will have much better results than a food processor. Almost undistinguishable from storebought.

I used a food processor and followed the instructions exactly.. I processed each small batch for about 5 minutes. It was almost like powdered sugar, but not quite. Then I tried to use it in frosting and it resulted in gritty butter that I had to throw away. I'll be sticking to store bought.

This works perfectly.  Make in smaller batches unless you have a powerful, higher capacity blender.  (Vitamix dry container is amazing for this.) The cornstarch is an anti-caking addition.  Please don't leave it out.  It is necessary as most frosting recipes will need it.

This actually worked!  Thanks, it saved me when making some buttercream frosting.  I used potato starch for health issues.  I blended 1 cup sugar plus 2 Tbsp potato starch at a time.  Worked like a charm.  Thanks for sharing.

Can't  believe this is the trick to making powdered sugar.  I was "iffy" about adding cornstarch and to my surprise the stuff you purchase off the shelf has it too.  There was no difference between this and storebought.  I'm never buying powdered sugar again.  I used my coffee grinder to make this.

I made exactly as the recipe said for a cream cheese frosting and resulted perfect. I would recommend to grind it until completely powdered to avoid clutters.

I made this today because i was Out of powder sugar and was in the process of making frosting for my dads birthday cake. I didn't want to go out to the store to buy some so I decided to make half a batch. I used the ninja blender and put it in the highest setting for about 10 minutes, while the sugar did become finer, it did not turn into powder. I put it at the highest level again for another 10 minutes but it was still the same. Thinking it was fine enough I went ahead and prepared the frosting. That was a huge mistake, no matter how much I beat the frosting, it was just too gritty. My ninja blender is new and I have blended whole fruit so I'm not sure what the problem is, it just did not work for me.

I wouldn't say I'm going to stop buying powedered sugar by any means but this did work and saved my dessert when I realized I was out of the store bought version. I only needed a cup so I scaled back the recipe and wizzed it up in my mini chopper and it worked perfectly. Good to know I can do this should I run into the same problem again.

My go to recipe for powdered sugar! I don't use it much, so when I buy it it always expires before I use much at all! I prefer to make it to save $$.

I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 of cornstarch.
It came out well. Just needed a bit for another recipe. Quick and easy recipe 2 mins tops.
To blend I used my Oster blender  on the lowest settings.

My best advice is not to run out of confectioners sugar!   I wish I had read some of the reviews before trying this. I put the sugar and corn starch in my food processor for much more than the recommended 2 minutes and all I got was sugar dust flying all over the place. I took some off and put it in my nutri ninja and that helped a bit, but it still wasn't as fine as the store bought CS. I think that possibly making a smaller batch is advisable. I, for one, do not believe it is worth the effort. Cleanup was not fun. I'll be buying extra the next time I go shopping.

Just never came together. I used one cup of sugar in a Ninja food processor. I got puffs of powdered sugar after about 7 minutes, but nothing had changed by 10 minutes and my machine was getting warm. I ended up with superfine sugar, but still way too gritty for frosting. Bummer.

Great recipe, just be sure to do it in batches. I used my nutribullet and did 1/2 c sugar + 1 tbsp cornstarch at a time. It's not hard and great quality.

less than 5 minutes - divided in 3 batches - in the blender and we have powdered sugar for the jam cookies.
