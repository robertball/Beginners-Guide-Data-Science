I used "real" crumbled bacon which I highly recommend if your store carries it pre packaged, also added one bunch chopped green onions, and made the day before. Served with potato chips. I have never seen a dip inhaled like this. I really wished I had doubled the recipe. Will make every time from now on. Thanks for a keeper!

This is great, the bacon and cheese really add an extra depth to the ranch dip.  I did use real bacon rather than bacon bits, so I suspect that helped where some reviewers complained about there being too much.

I brought this dip for Thanksgiving at my sisters.  It was a huge hit!  Everyone loved it!  They scraped the bowl clean.  I didn't use the bacon bits, instead I fried 2 strips of bacon and crumbled it into the dip.  I will definitely make this dip again!  Thanks for sharing!  It is now a family favorite!  It was simple to make and delicious to eat.  Served it with carrots, celery, red bell peppers and potato chips.  Very yummy with the chips!

EXCELLENT! I made it for a cookout at our home and the family loved it. The only change I did was use a about 1/2 a can of the Bacon Bits. It was delicious! Great dip!

I made this for a party and I thought it was wonderful.  I served cheddar pretzels for dipping and it was a great combination.  I did cut back on the amount of bacon bits, as I thought the amount called for would be overpowering.  I halved it and thought the dip was great.  I'll make this again and again--it's so simple and easy.

This is a great tasting dip.  I am not a huge ranch fan, but it really is a good dip.  I made it for my son's 2nd birthday party this past weekend and I got several requests for the recipe.  I did lay off on the bacon a bit and only used about 1.5 ounces.  This is a keeper!

I really like this recipe.  It is quick and easy but looks like you put a ton of effort in.  I used real bacon and added some chopped green onion.  I reserved some of the cheese, bacon, and green onion to pile on the top for garnish and would recommend doing that as it made it look really nice, like a loaded baked potato.  I'll definitely be making this again for a quick and easy addition to any party.

I have made this several times for family and friends. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  I only used about 1/3-1/2 the bacon bits.  This is really great with just potato chips too!

Add some chives or chopped green onions, real crumbled bacon and a dash of paprika or cayenne on top. Men really love this at parties and taligates!

This is excellent.  Will definitely make again.  I served with baked potato wedges.  Used light sour cream, 2% sharp cheddar, and real bacon crumbled (four slices).  This recipe is a keeper!

This dip is so good and is always a hit at parties! The only thing I would say is that it's much too salty if you use the entire packet of ranch dressing mix. I prefer the taste when using 1/2 to 3/4 of the packet. I refrigerate mine overnight, which contributes to the saltier taste because the flavors have longer to meld. I suppose if you were to mix and serve right away you would need the entire packet.

Easy to make - however I used a bit less bacon bits and still thought it was overpowering.  Will make this again, but will use less bacon bits.

Make it with real bacon and Plain Greek Yogurt! You get all the flavor, some probiotics, and good protein (and it tastes rich and creamy)!

So few ingredients, yet so full of flavor. For appearances sake, save some shreds of cheese, a few bacon bits, and maybe some chopped green onion as a garnish for the dip. I prepared this for a family Christmas gathering and it was awesome.

Please note the reviewers who state that the 1 oz ranch is over powering b/c it is.  Next time I will only use 1/2 an once. I salvaged this by adding cream cheese, half n half (to thin) and 2 fresh jalapenos chopped.

I love this dip. I used the real bacon pieces and it was great. I did notice with the first batch that the whole bag of bacon was a bit much so I used 1/2 on the second batch. I mistakenly used the ranch dip mix on the first batch and it was more flavorful than when I used the salad dressing mix. Will continue to make this.

I'm a big fan of Ranch dressing on baked potatoes, so this dip sounded like a great recipe for a baked potato topping. I added a bit of onion powder to it. It's GREAT!!

Husband LOVED this dip.  Said it was the best dip ever!!! That's good coming from him.  I was concerned the kids would not like this so I always cut down the serving to try out a small amount.  I scaled the recipe to 6 servings.  Basically I had to add the dried ranch dressing mix a little at a time (to taste).  These FOUR ingredients really make a great tasting and quick dip!  I did use turkey bacon.  This will be a regular appetizer in the summer months.  I served with cut up vegetables and crackers.

Very good recipe!! I took it to a Texas Hold'em party and it was gone in 10 mins. The only changes I made was I used real crumpled bacon instead of bacon bits and I served with pretzels. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Caterer and this dip was the 2nd biggest hit of a 35 person cocktial party I catered! I used real bacon fried and crumbeled and a 24 OZ sour cream to cut down on the saltyness of the dip. Also added 3 stalks of green onions.  Beautiful hearty dip!

Easy and fantastic!  Made it only once so far; used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  Was a huge hit at the party.  For those complaining of a too-ranchy taste, the longer you let it sit in the fridge before serving, the more evenly the taste develops.

The telling part of this recipe is my guests couldn't tell what it was!  The ranch dressing overpowered all the other tastes and it was almost impossible to tell there was bacon in it.  The shredded cheese made for an unappetizing texture with no taste to be gained.  Conversely, my guests ate it and said it was good- they just thought it was ranch dip.

The only change I made was to use "real" bacon crumbles. It has a good flavor, but a little on the salty side. If I ever make this again, I will cut back on the amount of bacon.

Made this for my wedding and it was SOOOOO yummy!! Used homemade bacon bits.  Only had 2 small containers leftover (made a TON) and I polished those off all by myself in the 2 days after the wedding ;)

Very quick and easy!   Everyone loved this even my husband who doesn't like bacon.  I used real bacon bits and  I doubled this recipe for a cookout but found that I only need about 4 and 1/2 oz. of bacon bits instead of the 6 oz.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  We ate it with taco chips and pita chips and celery.  I am sure to ake this again and again.  Great for football parties!

I doubled this recipe, added sliced green onions, and took it to a birthday BBQ this last weekend. The kids (ages 2-13) wouldn't let go of the bowl for the adults....totally ruined their appetites for the rest of the lunch!  Great dip!

Made this dip for Father's Day and it was a hit!  I did not make any changes to the recipe because I wanted to rate the dip as written.  I did find it a little salty, but not overly powering.  I will make again and add maybe 3/4 pkg of the ranch dressing mix.

My family calls this "crack" dip because it is so addictive!!  I've made it several times and I never have any leftover!.  It's best if you make it the night before and let all the flavors meld together.  Definitely use the real bacon pieces!  It's great on crackers, corn chips...pretty much anything!!  Heck, I could even eat it by itself!!  It's that good!!!

Good stuff.  Honestly I've had better dips, but this was good as well.  I used some real bacon because the thought of fake little bacon bits just isn't appealing.  Use real bacon, even if it's in a jar.  I used low fat sour cream and fat free cheese and it was still good.  I preferred this with tortilla chips.  I had some celery on hand but didn't think it went together very well.  And it seems too chunky for potato chips, and bacon and cheese just seem better suited to tortilla chips.

What an super-duper AWESOME dip!!  This is one of those dips you'll want to make for watching a sporting event on TV with friends!  It makes a nice large portion for sharing, although it tastes SO good, I think I could practically eat it all myself.  Great with chips and corn chips (Scoops, especially).  Thanks for this one Dyanne!!  Oh, I almost forgot, I did back off on the bacon bits as my experience in using the canned ones is that they can overpower the recipe when you use the whole can.  I used approx. 4 T. of real bacon bits.

I used half a pkg of the dry ranch dressing and added the bacon bits until I thought it "looked" good. After letting it sit in the fridge for an hour or two, it was pretty good.  Next time, I may take others advice and use real crumbled bacon instead. Good on both butter crackers and chips. Plus, its VERY easy to make!

I thought this recipe was delicious, but not quite what I expected out of a five star recipe. It was a bit strong on the bacon (and I used less than half of what was suggested!) and a little bland. I added some hot sauce, and that helped. I served this at a get together of about 40 people and got a decidedly lukewarm reception. Good, but nothing special.

YUM! Made this for a Fourth of July BBQ / cookout and was very pleased with the results!!! I pretty much followed this to the letter with a few exceptions. Instead of using bacon bits, I fried up 4 pieces of bacon. I also used lite sour cream and added a couple sliced green onions (some to my dip and the rest as garnish). I prepped this the night prior to allow all of the yummy flavors to blend. To offset the not-so-good-for-you BBQ fare on the menu, I served this with a variety of fresh veggies - baby carrots, radish, cucumber, snap peas, grape tomatoes and orange bell pepper. I bet this would be great with chips tho.... All I can say is WOW! Thanks for sharing your simple, tasty recipe RONNAS. :-)

it was a bit too salty for me. If you are up for more time consuming....make the Ranch Dressing II from Dawnia on this site. It is THE best ranch dip. When I made the dressing recipe it is too thick for me and I thin it out with buttermilk to use as  dressing....but as written it is an awesome Ranch dip. Then just add the cheese and bacon from this recipe.....

Too much ranch...and I love ranch.  I think a partial package of dry ranch should be used.  Don't just dump the whole thing in.  Plus, as it sets, it gets stronger.

This dip is SO salty. We had it with pretzels and carrots and other cut-up veggies, and we just could not eat it. I had baked potatoes, and the dip was alright on them, but again the saltiness was just overwelming. Had to toss the rest out.

Everyone loved this dip!  We fried up some potato slices and dipped it in this.  I bet it would be great with a baked potato!

This dip is a huge hit everytime I make it.  I use pre-packaged crumbled bacon instead of bacon bits, I think it has a better texture that way.  Bacon bits tend to be too hard.

One word:  YUM!  This was an awesome dip, a little thick, but very tasty.  It has a cool mix of flavors and now I think I'm an idiot for never thinking of this myself!  :)

i was looking for something quick and easy, yet unique. This was perfect. I did half sour cream and half mayo tho because i don't love sour cream. Also, i split it in half nad warmed half in the oven so the cheese totally melted. The warm one was gone first!

I made this dip for my sons wedding reception. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used real bacon instead of the bacon bits. Everyone raved about this dip. My sister's said it was a "killer dip". My husband asked me to make some more for him.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  
Ps. I didn't dress up with the onions and crumbles as shown, just mixed all the ingredients and refrigerated for 2 days.

Just made this. It is very good but way too salty. Next time I would definitely use half the ranch mix. I used the Fiesta Ranch mix. I read on here to add 8 more ounces of sour cream if too salty for your taste. So off to the store I go!

This was really good even though I can't read recipe's correctly!! I had it in my mind it called for cream cheese. When I got to stirring it all together something didn't seem right so, I looked at the recipe again and realized my mistake. So, I just added the sour cream...was still delicious, though a bit stiff. I'll make this again, but correctly next time!

This recipe contains almost all of the ingredients I love to put on my baked potato or in potato skins.  The only thing I added were some spices.  Salt and pepper to taste and a dash of dried onions as I didn't have any chives either fresh or dried available.  Mixed it all up. Put a dash of cayenne pepper on top to give the dish some color when I served it.  My college age son ate most of it in one setting and didn't save much for my husband and I! Will be serving this at my next party.

i was not crazy about this dip nor was my husband or his brother who like anything! I followed the recpe with the bacon bits-but think real bacon would have made a big difference. I have made lots of other dips that were much better so probably would not make this again. It was ok served with chips or tostitos but couldn't imagine trying to eat veggies with it. A cucumber slice didn't taste good with it. Give me plain old ranch dip for veggies anyday.

Really good, a bit on the salty side, but probably because I used homemade ranch dressing mix and the salt had settled to the bottom of my mix... oops. :)

GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY!!!! This was the BEST ranch dip ever! I refer to it as the "pimped out" ranch dip. Instead of sour cream, though, I used fat free plain Greek yogurt. PHENOMINAL recipe!

Very quick and easy to put together. I used crumbled bacon isntead of the bacon bits. I think that a whole package of dried ranch dressing mix is powerful, so I only used 1/2 of it. Very good, thanks!

I made this for a party and it got rave reviews. I would suggest cutting the bacon in half though, as it was a bit salty (and I didn't even use the full 3 ounces). This is very good and I will definitely keep the recipe for future parties.

This was a great dip! I went by the recipe. It can be used as a dip or a spread. I sliced baguette bread in 1/2 inch slices, brushed each side with garlic flavored olive oil, and toasted the slices in a pan over medium heat. My guests use the dip (spread) on the slices and they went fast.

the taste of this is good... i used real bacon bits, only about half a package of ranch mix, added some dried parsley, chives, a little bit of garlic powder & some pepper. i noticed it was a little bit salty as others have mentioned, but i dont think it had anything to do with the dip... i used wavy lays for dippers and those are salty enough on their own! cheese crackers are really good dippers for this, as are veggies, and potatos.

This dip is certainly a delicious recipe. I used reduced fat sour cream, fat free ranch dressing, and reduced fat bacon bits and it still came out tasting great. I did half the amount of bacon that I used (to 1.5 ounces), since I thought it was getting to be a little much. Next time I will certainly be adding in some chopped green onions (scallions) to enhance the flavor even more.

Very good!  I did use the Fiesta Ranch and the large, 24 oz lite sour cream, and a 4.6 oz pkg of real bacon, and a little more cheese.  Great dip recipe!  Thank you!

This dip was very popular at the bonfire I took it to; made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  I thought it was really good, but next time I think I would prefer it if I cooked up some bacon instead of using the premade bacon bits.  The dip still tasted good, it is just a personal preference.

I have found a new favorite for gameday!! I love sports and this will be served for super bowl parties, march madness, baseball season. Plus, it's a quick recipe to make if I forget about an office party. Haven't met a single person who didn't like the recipe. Someone suggested adding sliced cherry tomatoes. I'll have to that.

I made this for the Super Bowl and it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe except the bacon.  I used 1 pk fresh bacon crumbles (located next to the regular bacon bits) that I believe was 4.3 oz.  I served it with carrot, celery, red bell pepper and Ruffles.

I think one packet of ranch is WAY too much!  I had to add a lot of extra sour cream.  Otherwise, it was good and so simple.

I was trying to think of a different way of doing potatoes for supper the other day and when I got this recipe by email I knew what to do. We used this on our baked potatoes and it was absolutely delicious. I don't like to rate recipes after I've changed them but the only thing I added was 3 chopped green onions. I'll try this out on quests the next time we have baked potatoes. Thanks

I served this delicious dip with an appetizer called Potato Poppers out of the Laurel's Kitchen cookbook.  I substituted the bacon bits with fake bacon bits and used only 1/4 of the can.   I'm going to experiment with making it a little thinner, so the delicate potato balls hold up better when dipped. In the meantime, I just need to butter them with this thick, rich and delicious dip.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe as written and did not love it. I'm sure with adequate changes, this could be better. However, honestly, there are better ranch dip recipes out there without me having to fuss with this one.

Use your own ranch dressing mix, I suggest using SD's dry ranch dressing mix. It's even better. I added just a little Frank's and a little pepper. This is good as a topping for baked potatoes and a great dip for jo-jo potatoes, too!

Wow, I had so many requests for this recipe after I made it for a holiday party.  I too used real bacon and crumbled it, finely shreadded cheddar cheese, 2 finely chopped scallons, and used the Ranch seasoning to taste so it wouldn't be too salty!  Everyone loved it!

Good, but SALTY.  I used the pre-cooked bacon and 3 oz of cream cheese (to help stabilize a bit if it sat out awhile), and I thought that would help, but whoa nelly, still salty.  I would make it again, but next time starting at half a packet of ranch mix and just adding until it tasted how I wanted.  Don't use the whole package at once!!

I made this recipe last night for a boxing party.  I walked out of the room for the fight, no longer then about 45 min.  When I came back in the dip was completely GONE.  I didn't even get any, besides when I tasted it after I made it.  No one really commented on it, but the bowl tells it own story.  I have always made ranch dip, but never again will I make it the same way.  
Thank you!!!

Good, easy dip. However, it definetly needs the bacon. I made a version of it without bacon and it was too mild. I used slightly less sour cream, and much more cheese in my version. I would have also added a bit m

This dip was really good, the only thing I added was some green onion per other reviews.  It tasted even better the next day, we ate it with normal potato chips and pretzel crisps.  I plan on making it and using it on baked potatoes in the future.

This dip was a favorite at my daughter's sleep over. I have made it a few times but the second time I added more bacon as I found everyone was looking for the bacon bits. Excellent with tostitos scoops or fritos.

I used the individual packet of buttermilk ranch. Not too salty and made hours ahead. Topped with green onions. Would make again. Served with potato chips. Big hit!

Real easy. I made my own Bacon Bits instead of getting the kind in the jar. I mixed in some bacon and cheese and then when it came time to serve, I put some extra bacon and cheese on top.

Made this for a cabin trip cookout, the only complaint I heard was there wasn't enough! I will double next time. I omitted the bacon this time around, next time I will offer crumbles for the top that folks can add as they wish so it wont get soggy. Thank you!

I was so excited to try this dip since it got such good reviews.  We did not like it.  I even added less ranch per other reviews and it was still overpowering.  And I LOVE ranch!  Tried it with chips and crackers and nothing seemed right.  Sorry for the low review, I really wanted to like this dip.

This dip was great! I used half the Ranch dressing mix and added more to taste, based on feedback from other reviews.  I also used half of a jar of real crumbled bacon.  My picky husband and my five year-old son loved it!

Great dip but wasn't sure if it was for crackers, chips, veggies?  May try making it with cream cheese or a mix of sour cream and cream cheese and make it more like a cracker spread.  I used real bacon I had left over from breakfast.  It tastes better the longer the flavors blend.  Will make again.

This is a great dip recipy  I used Hidden Valley   Spicey dry mix in the sour cream.  Also added chopped onion and real bacon bits.  When made the day before it had a nice kick.  Served with tostito scoops.  Would be good as a baked potato topping.

We enjoed this, but I did make some slight changes...I didn't have quite enough sour cream, so I also added in some mayo, which gave a nice richness and halved the ranch mix. Also I used some bacon that I had cooked and crumbled and had in the freezer and added in some green onions. This was tasty, and a nice change. I served this with crackers, but I think it would be good with a variety of dippers! I'd make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Was super simple to make and we loved it. Served it with toasted pita bread. I do agree strongly with others thoughts of either using the real bacon bits or use real bacon. Add a whole different taste and texture. Will be making again soon

Delicious...made for New Years Eve and everyone liked it...I used real bacon I cooked up, about four slices crumbled, minced some green onion also. Served with veggies, celery and grape tomatoes were the best dippers.

Super simple and so good! I made this a few months ago and am making again this weekend. I used "real bacon pieces" and it was still super yummy. It's a great "go to" recipe when you're making a couple of dishes because of it's simplicity and universal appeal. I don't care for celery but dipped in this stuff I could eat it all day long!!

This is an amazingly versatile recipe. I use fresh bacon and fat free cheddar and sour cream. I also make my own ranch dressing mix due to food allergies in the family. My whole family LOVES this dip!

We all loved this! I made this dip for Christmas Eve and will be making it again for New Year's Eve. I used "real" bacon bits and added a heaping tablespoon of horseradish. We dipped chips, nacho chips and warm garlic bread sticks and all were good! This is a keeper!

If you let the dip set, it will get quite salty. I wouldn't add the bacon or cheese again.

This was a great easy recipe!  I used regular bacon that I cooked in the micro and crumbled.  Took no time at all to put together, and I already had all the ingredients in my fridge/pantry!  Will serve it today for the football game!  Thanks for the recipe!

This dip was great!  I didn't use a whole 3 oz of bacon bits because it was already pretty thick and I didn't have anymore sour cream.  I guess I used about 1.5 oz.  It was great and everyone loved it!

Tasty! But as another reviewer suggested, I used the real bacon pieces in a bag, definately made the dip, can't imagine it with bacon bits...? One suggestion, as much as I LOVE bacon, the next time I will probably cut down on it a little bit, maybe to 3 oz instead of 4. EASY, EASY, EASY, and tasty! Definately will make again and again!

The concept for this recipe was good however the end result was just plain SALTY!! I used fat free sour cream and only 1/2 of the recommended 3oz jar of bacon bits. It was so salty we had to throw the whole thing out.  What a waste of ingredients.

made this dip for a work function and was asked to make it again.  I crumbled freshly cooked bacon in mine, and used bacon bits the second time, both were good but people could tell the difference.

this dip was to die for!  we ate it with potato chips at our job christmas party, and it tasted like loaded potato skins.  we used real bacon bits in it.  it was a tad bit salty, so if salt isn't your thing, cut back on the ranch seasoning.

Easy......tastes great........took it to the first football game and it was gone.  I have to make more for the Labor Day get togethers.  I did cut down on the randh seasoning, by half, because I'm not a huge ranch fan.

FABULOUS!!!
Everyone loved this dip and raved about it and asked for the recipe.
The only change I made was I used real bacon.  I fried it up then crumbled it in.
I served it with Regular Ruffles, and when those ran out I served Tostitos Scoops.  Both went well with the dip.
I HIGHLY recommend.

This was delicious!  I made it in the morning before I was supposed to take it to a get together that night.  I used half of the bacon bits that it called for and that was plenty.  It is a pretty salty dip but very good.

We loved this dip.  I made it for a gathering on Friday evening and served with beer bread and had leftovers on Saturday so we served with crackers - it was even better then.  I added 8 oz lite cream cheese and 2 sliced green onions.  Will make again for sure.  And I've already been asked for the recipe.

Can we say addicting?  This dip is so good, I made it to have out for an appitizer for Thanksgiving and well it didnt make it to Thanksgiving I ate it up before then. Tast the best when made a day or two before you need it but besure to put it in the back of the fridge so you are not tempted to grap at it all day like I did

This was fast to make and my co-workers seemed to enjoy it.  I think it could use a bit more flavor/spice - maybe some green onion?  Honestly I would make it again just because it is so easy!  Thanks so much!

Really good served with wheat crackers.  This is one of those dips where the flavor gets better the longer it sits in the refrigerator.
