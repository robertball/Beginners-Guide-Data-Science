Oh! I wanted to love this recipe- it sounded so good.  I didn't make any changes and the family, including me thought it was terrible.
It was a PB&J night.

This recipe is perfect!!! My dad was so pleased on father's day to have a burger that was more than just ordinary.  It was moist, full of flavor, and filling.  The recipe was also very affordable, and all of the ingredients were easy to find.  Instead of baking them in the oven like the recipe suggested, I grilled them.  My boyfriend is expecting me to make many more.

These were fantastic! It was such a change from the regular boring burger..It does have a meatloaf taste to it, so if you dont want that, dont eat this recipe! It has just the right amount of everything! I changed the swiss to provolone and oh man, was it good. I made it for my inlaws and they loved it! (And these are meat and potato people) Amazing, Yummy and oh man, Amazing!

Easy to make, bonus because we wanted burgers and are out of propane for the grill.  I took away the buns, of course they will burn, instead served w. mashed potatoes.  Thick patties, needed to bake longer in high altitude.  Also used worcestershire instead of vinegar.  My 9 year old added ketchup and mustard and said "mmm, tasty".  These were a hit!  Will use again :)

This recipe had mixed reviews at my house. I liked the recipe except for the fact the hamburger buns burned on the bottom. My husband agreed with the reviewer who said it was a Pbj night. He only liked the cheese and bacon topping.

Couple of things to add here about open-faced burgers of any kind:

* Broil them about 6" from the heat source, don't bake them. You want to cook the meat, not burn the buns. 

* The meat mixture on the half a bun should not be a full quarter/third pound like a traditional burger. One pound of meat should be split between four buns (eight total open-faced burgers). Serving size should be two open-faced burgers (both halves of one bun).

* Make sure the meat mixture covers the entire bun surface, even hang over it a bit. The meat mix will shrink as it cooks, which will lead to a browning of the bun that is then exposed. 

Happy cooking & eating!
