Wimped out on the red bell pepper because 3 bell pepper is overkill for the hubby so I used only 2 which were yellow and green. No clue where to get tiger prawn in my area so I just used large raw shrimp. This is good as written but  a couple of shakes of seafood seasoning such as Old Bay and you have great. I served this over leftover beans and yellow rice and it was  a big hit!

Forgot to cut back the tomato paste/water combo, so it was a little too much tomato.  My own error.  Otherwise very good!
