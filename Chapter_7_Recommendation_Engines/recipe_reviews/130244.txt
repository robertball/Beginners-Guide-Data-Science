The people at the party who like bland food liked these. We dipped them in onion blossom dip. Those who prefer more developed tastes had the bacon wrapped water chestnuts I baked besides these. Still, I have made them now several times because people like them a lot!

TIPS: 
1) Do not pre-bake the tots. All I did is wrap them with the bacon and put in the fridge. When I could stick a toothpick through them, I was did so.

2) Make sure to turn them over 1/2 way through cooking.

3) Make sure the bacon is wrapped all the way around the tot (not center cut bacon, unless you use the whole piece) or the tot may fall apart.

4) I do not add the cheese...seems too messy for me!

5) Experiment with different flavors of bacon - they are all fun!

6) I line the cookie sheet with aluminum foil.

7) I bake these at a higher temp (400 - 450, depending on how hot your oven gets) so the bacon crisps.

8) Make sure to leave adequate space when baking any bacon wrapped appetizer. If you put them too close together, they will steam, and the bacon will not get crispy!

Delicious! I made them a bit differently than the posted recipe. I didn't pre-cook the taters or bacon. I put the tater tots in the fridge for about 30 mins, just long enough so a toothpick would go through them. I then wrapped the tater tots in half-slices of bacon and secured them with wet toothpicks. I seasoned with lemon pepper and salt. I put them in the oven at 450 for 20 mins, flipping over 10 mins in. They're great dipped in maple syrup. I'll definitely make these again.

These were really good! A little involved to make, but good! BUT, don't leave them in near as long as it says. The cheese completely melted and burned away. You probably only need to leave them in for 15 - 20 minutes because the tater tots and bacon are already pre-cooked a bit. Leaving them in for 30 minutes was just way too long for the cheese!

This is an old one!  I used to make these back in the 80's and everyone loved them.  Very good with a spicy honey mustard sauce for dipping.

I am shocked that this recipe hasn't gotten better reviews.  I made these for a New Years Eve party, and every single person who had them, loved them!  And I continued to be asked to bring them to other parties, in which they gain even more fans.  Sure, they are a little messy to make... but who doesn't love bacon, tater tots, and american cheese?!?!  YUMMY!!!! If you find them too salty, then you may have to try a different bacon.  Line the pan with aluminum foil to aid in clean up.

Very tasty.  These were so good and they are easy to make but very time consuming.  I did not want my cheese to melt out so I did not wrap it with the bacon. When the wrapped tots were done cooking I laid the piece of cheese on top of each wrapped tot and put them back into the oven long enough to melt the cheese.

This is a delicious recipe.  I omit the cheese and wrap a 1/3 slice of uncooked bacon around a mostly thawed tot!  Comes out perfect.

A friend of our tries this recipe and I couldn't even make it thru 2 of them... so much salty flavor and bacon makes them a natural heart attack waiting to happen. Slightly lacked in flavor as well, perhaps a more flavorful cheese than american singles could help make this a 2-star snack.

Try this:  Omit the cheese, add pickled jalape√±o.  Bake in oven at 400 until bacon was crispy.  I put them on metal skewers (4 per skewer) so when they were done, I slid them onto the serving plate- simple. Yum! (If you have a rack, that's ideal so they don't sit in their own grease.)

Yum! This was an easy breakfast, to say the least. I followed other reviewers advice and used raw bacon and frozen hash browns instead of heating both up before wrapping. It took about 40 minutes to cook that way, with one flip to make sure the bacon was cooked all over. I also omitted the cheese in the baking process and put it on top. The taste was amazing! I didn't think it'd be spectacular for something so simple, but the bacon was juicy and crispy, the cheese was melted and creamy while the potatoes were soft and tender. It made for a great breakfast!

Pretty good.  I left the cheese out and just wrapped the tots with bacon.  Made for Halloween after trick or treating and called them Goblin Toes.  lol

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  I made this for the super bowl and they were easy to make. People want the recipe when I describe it to them, without even trying it.

You need to spray the baking sheet.  The cheese melted everywhere and the bacon was still under cooked.  They got ate anyhow!

These are great! I added jalapenos, left out the cheese and made Rotel cheese dip instead. I was able to bake them until the bacon was crispy and no issues with cheese running out on the pan.

I made these for an office party and they were a complete hit. I had pre-cooked them and then heated them up the toaster oven at work. They didn't last long.

Awesome once I made a few minor changes:

I wrapped the tater tot and a slice of pickled jalapeno in the bacon.....sealed with toothpick. I froze the ones (in a tupperware) that weren't going to be eaten immediately and then deep fried the ones for that day until the bacon was crunchy, placed on a papertowel lined plated to soak excess oil then sprinkled with grated cheese (I've used cheddar, pepper jack, swiss, mozzarella, fontina, gouda.....they're ALL good), then serve with different dipping sauces (red hot sauce, honey mustard sauce, bbq sauce, blue cheese, ranch, etc.)

my family loves these, the first time i ate them i didn't expect it to be such simple ingredients.  the flavors combine so perfectly.  
crowd pleaser! no matter how many I make there are never any leftover!
i do not precook anything, simply wrap half slice of bacon around and bake.

My cheese melted and burned away, as another reviewer mentioned, but the bacon-wrapped tater tot part was still pretty good. :) I made these with Ore Ida tater tots, the best kind ever! :)

These were okay, but not worth the trouble it took to make them. They were somewhat bland. If I did make them again, I would have to add some onion powder and garlic powder, or something to kick the flavor up a notch. I took them out of the oven after 20 minutes because the cheese was melting out and burning in the pan. Some of my tots fell apart. Also, it was a pain to pull out all the toothpicks before serving them to the kids.
