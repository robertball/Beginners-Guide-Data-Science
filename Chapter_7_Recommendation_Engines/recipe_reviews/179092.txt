This was rather soupy.  If I made it again, I would cut back on the broth and add a little brown sugar and some more of the spices.  It was kind of bland.

Flavor was okay, but it didn't turn out well.  The marshmallows disintigrated and the mixture was too thin.

Very simple and delicious.  Something that you can prepare, put in the casserole dish, and then heat up later.

this was a fantastic recipe although i did use fresh sweet potatoes which i cooked and mashed. had to make it for a potluck friendsgiving for more than eight people so i guessed about measurements but they turned out delicious.

Tasted great, but I think next time I will use a little less chicken broth so it is thicker.  :)
