This was delicious and super easy/fast.  I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but I doubled it.  I used a pound of Bob Evans italian sausage and a ring of Oscar Meyer selects italian herb "kielbasa style" sausage (I sliced it).  I only had one can of crushed tomatoes, and since I doubled the recipe, I added a few fresh sliced tomatoes.  I also threw in a little garlic, oregano, and basil.  Super GREAT meal, and I my men loved it!  Cheers to the recipe contributor!

Was super simple and delicious I added a couple different spices like pepper,garlic powder,and oregano leaves which made it great. I also let the cheese melt stirred it in and then put a little more on top to melt. Would definitely make this dish again.

pretty good and really quick to make. I left out the cheese and added some garlic powder for more flavor.
I used a no sodium vegetable broth instead of tomato juice bc my husband has really bad heartburn  and also regular rice. 
cooked the rice for 20 mins once I added it to the skillet.  
Followed the recipie, except I didn't use concentrated tomato  juice. 
I cut the sausages before I cooked them so they turned into balls instead of slices-added more weight to each bowl.

Good recipe. I added a tsp of italian seasoning and garlic powder after adding the juice. I cooked the rice 18 mins then added to the boiling mix and let simmer for 5 then stir add cheese and cover and let sit for another 5. Came out great. Adding this to my list of regulars.

I used chicken broth instead of concentrated tomato juice. I thought it was a good base recipe, but came out bland. It needs more spices in my opinion. I added 1/2 Tbs. Italian seasoning and it still needed something. Also, next time I would cook the sausage without slicing and remove it, serving the rice mixture as a side dish, with the sausages in one piece.

Very Yummy, however next time I think I may add noddles instead of rice and also add in some cottage or ricotta cheese to make it like a skillet lasagna.

I made this for my family tonight followed the recipe but added a 1lb of ground beef also and used fire roasted diced tomatoes and added yellow and red peppers. My family loved it. Will make this again. One thing I found faster I cut the Italian sausages first then cooked them.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made it exactly as it was written using low-sodium tomato juice and it was very easy and a great comfort dish.  I think it would be good to add more veggies in the mix next time, but otherwise, I'd leave it exactly as is!  Awesome.

Not a huge fan of tomatoes, glad I took a gamble. It was delicious, added some crushed red pepper for a little more heat. It was a great dinner on a cold evening. Will definitely make this again. ??

This is a really tasty and easy recipe, I did add chopped garlic, basil and oregano. I didn’t have vegetable juice so used beef broth.  I think next time I will use regular rice instead of quick rice and simmer it on low for a bit longer just to absorb some more of the liquid. This reheats really well and was just as tasty the second day.

Wow! SO DELICIOUS! I added more rice (regular) and vegetable juice so it took longer to cook. The flavor really surprises you! It's very tasty.

Made recipe as directed with two exceptions—when the onions and peppers were nearly done, I added two cloves of fresh minced garlic. Then I added a teaspoon of Italian Seasoning to the sauce before bringing to a simmer.

I substituted the sausage for chicken due to personal preference. I would use less onions and cheese. The cheese makes it difficult to scoop into a bowl. There seemed to be too many onions. Otherwise, it was pretty tasty.

The family loved this, called it a “keeper”. I used regular rice, cooked in vegetable broth before adding to the onion, garlic and sausage mixture, then added vegetable juice and dried oregano instead of tomato juice. I threw half a can of cannellini beans in, then after adding the cheese, I topped the dish with fresh spinach leaves and let sit until the cheese melted, then stirred the spinach and cheese into the dish.

This has become one of my favorite dishes to make for my family. I buy the ground sausage to make it quicker. As my husband avoids carbs during the week and I don’t care much for rice, I drain the tomatoes thoroughly and leave out the vegetable broth. I melt the cheese over the sausage and serve over garbanzo beans for my husband and elbow macaroni for me!!! Quick, easy, and delicious.

Fine as written but needed more spice. Added three cloves of garlic, basil and Italian seasoning. Made with small pasta the second time (cooked pasta al dente before adding to skillet and no addition of juice needed). Overall very good and definitely satisfying.

We loved this simple, fast recipe. I doubled the onion, added 3 minced garlic cloves, one whole minced jalapeño, and I added some Italian seasoning. We used par-boiled pasta instead in instead rice. Delicious.

Delicious! I didn't add the onions because my dad can't have them. I also didn't put cheese on it but I put a bowl of cheese on the table because my sister can't have diary. I also didn't use the instant rice I used a healthier rice. It took longer to cook but it was totally worth it! I noticed that only me and my sister (we are teens) were the only ones to put cheese on it. I served this recipe with a salad. VERY GOOD! I will definitely make this again! Everybody liked it!

This recipe is great! I have four stars because there's not enough seasoning. Like the other reviewers, I'd recommend adding garlic, Italian seasoning, and even a bay leaf. Made again but Spanish style with black beans and chorizo!

I followed this reciipe to a "tee" and it turned out great. didn't even add any spices although you probably could add some italian seasonings but to me it was delicious just the way it was prepared. thanks for the recipe.

My family and I loved it. No leftover for once all the kids ate more then one bowl. Quick and easy to make. And not very spendy.  Will be making it again for sure.

This was good. My family liked but did not love it. We'll have it again but next time I will add something to give it a lil more zip. Super easy though, gotta love that!

Had to make a few substitutions based on what was on hand, but still turned out tasty.  English bangers (sausage), medium and sharp cheddar instead of mozarella, and substituted the vegetable juice with chicken broth.  Also had to add some olive oil when sauteeing the veg because bangers don't leave much grease.  In the end, was a hit!

I changed a couple things. All wheat penne( no rice) , yellow bell pepper ( not green ).  Thankful that I had made soup a couple days ago and had some vegetable broth left. It was a very quick, filling, and very flavorful.

I forgot to buy rice, so I used the half box of macaroni that I had. I cooked the macaroni separately and added it right before the cheese. I also added some basil and let it sit for about 5 minutes or so to let the macaroni soak up some of the sauce.

This was delicious!  I had to use turkey Italian sausage because that's what I had at the time.  It was quick, easy, and my Dad and I loved it.
