OK, I hate beans, but was trying to introduce more of them into my diet.  I made this and doubled all the spices for fear of getting that beany taste I hate.  It was really good (though I will follow the recipe next time, as the spices were a bit overwhelming).  It was good hot (though it never became "bubbly" as the recipe suggests), but I think next time I might try it cold. It is a major accomplishment that I am going to try this recipe again, given that I don't like beans!!!

this one was a hit at my last BBQ, no one had any idea that it was a bean dip.

I also hate beans but I know they are very good for you, so I decided to make this recipe based on another bean-hating reviewer's positive comments. I was afraid of this turning out too "bean-y," so I used all the ingredients except only one can of the beans (a lower-sodium brand from Whole Foods). And I used fresh instead of dried rosemary. I put the mixture in a pie plate and then into the oven and crumbled two pieces of bacon on top. I baked it for 20 minutes (it didn't bubble) but it was great as a dip with whole wheat pita bread pieces. I would definitely make this for a party or even eat it for dinner again. Bean haters, give this a try!

You have to really like rosemary to love this spread.  I thought it was good but a little too rosemary-y.  Next time I will use half the rosemary and some other herb or spice, not sure what yet. Mine never did bubble either and got a little dry, could use some moisture or creaminess.  Maybe I'll try adding a little cream cheese next time.  Tasted good with Frank's Hot sauce.

I won't discourage anyone from making this, but considering I like all the ingredients and disliked the outcome, just try it as an experiment.  The rosemary really threw it off for some reason.

LOVED this, and it was a huge hit at a cocktail party I attended over the weekend.  I didn't bother baking it....just let it suffice as a spread, and it turned out great.  I also added a bit more rosemary to it.  Will definitely make it again!  I served it with a second dip (Braunschweiger party spread), and the combination complimented each other very nicely.

I did not care for this recipe at all! The rosemary was so overpowering, it really cleared my sinuses. I would never use this recipe again.

First I should note that I used pinto beans (substituted as the recipe suggested) as I couldn't find Great Northern beans at the supermarket.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I found the dip to smell too strongly of vinegar, and taste strongly of rosemary.  It was also dry and never became bubbly.  It wasn't inedible, it just wasn't really good, either.  I won't be making this recipe again.

This was fairly good.  I sprinkled some cheddar cheese in the middle of the bean mix before baking.  There was quite a bit left over, so I've been eating it as a pita sandwich.  I almost like it better that way!

Great recipe, but the rosemary was a little overpowering. I enjoyed it though, overall.

This dip was RIDICULOUSLY popular at a recent dinner party, and even the less adventurous eaters just devoured it. I found it didn't get bubbly as the recipe stated, but the cooking time still made it nice and toasty. I served with sliced pitas and it went FAST.
