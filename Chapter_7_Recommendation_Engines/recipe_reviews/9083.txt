Blanch the broccoli florets (drop them into boiling water for 1 minute, then drain or put into a salad spinner to dry) before adding the other ingredients and dressing.  100% improvement.

This salad was great with a few modifications.  First blanch the broccoli.  Second double the dressing and use real mayonnaise (it's only a couple of tablespoons for Pete's sake!) and Third ADD BACON.

I loved this!  Such wonderful flavor and can be made in a snap!  I always blanch broccoli, as I don't like that real raw flavor and it brings out the green.  I also added salt and pepper, had low fat mayo and full fat yogurt.  I only had a tangerine so used the juice from that and also a bit of the grated rind thrown in.  It really brought out a beautiful flavor and the color of bits of orange.  I didn't have sunflower seeds so threw in a few cashews for crunch.  The textures are also wonderful in this salad and so healthy.  Will definitely be a summer staple in my house.  It was nice to find one that didn't take bacon, as my husband doesn't eat pork.

Really a good salad!  And healthy too!  I added about 2 T. real bacon bits for flavor and blanched the broccoli about 2 minutes to bring out the bright color.  Didn't like it much when I first prepared it but after sitting overnight it's delicious!  The flavors have really blended.  I think it would be good with chopped walnuts instead of the sunflower seeds.  That would even make it healthier.  Will definitely make again!

Due to personal taste, I put halved grapes in instead of raisins and used a sauce from another recipe: 1/3C mayo, 1/4C yogurt, 3T sugar, 1T red wine vinegar, 1 fresh squeezed orange and fresh ground pepper, also no red onions, too stinky, either some finely chopped Vidalias if in season or white, or

This recipe is so delicious. I just about doubled the raisins and sunflower seeds and added an extra TB of OJ because I love the sweet flavor of brocolli salad dressing. I also added 1 TB of honey. Wow... will be making this again! Great recipe.

I would recommend blanching the broccoli or putting in a microwave for a couple minutes.  Low fat or fat free mayo, no bacon, afterall, low fat is the key :)  Add 'liquid Smoke' flavoring to give the dressing a bacony flavor....  also, dried cranberries can be substitued for the raisins.  A few cashews could be substituted for the sunflower seeds...adjust calorie count.

This is a great recipe to "lighten" up the usual broccoli salad.  It uses orange juice as the sweetener instead of sugar and uses plain yogurt and only 1 TB of fat-free mayonnaise.  It had great flavor, but I am used to a sweeter dressing.  The next time I make this I might add turkey bacon as I really missed the bacon flavor the "usual" recipes have.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks Christine for sharing your recipe.

Sadly found this to be bland.  Blanched the broccoli which I recommend.  The dressing was tasteless though.  The next morning I tried to give it flavor. 1st tried a taste with cayenne added - NO. Then tried adding curry powder - better.  I think I'll try adding curry powder (1 tbl) and a dash of cumin to the dressing next time.  Loved the red onion, raisen and seeds.

Very healthy.  I added a bit more miracle whip than 1 T. but not much.  You couldn't even tell you were eating a yogurt based salad.  Broccoli salad is one of my favorites - now I don't have to feel guilty about it!  Thanks!

This recipe gave me a great jump on creating a fanstastic and healthier version of broccoli salad. Being new to eating vegetarian, I was looking for a punch of flavour without the bacon (which yes, does make a delcious sald...) I made slightly more dressing as most reviewers mentioned, but I added honey dijon mustard to the dressing. It is absolutely amazing, and gives that extra flavour I would have missed!

Light and refreshing. Helps that I love broccoli... I fully support the blanching followed by salad spinning to remove the water - the sauce is already a bit runny with that OJ. I added salt and pepper and both my husband and I thought that was a sufficient enough addition to the recipe. No, it's not overly flavorful but just the right amount of tasty (this coming from a couple who likes their salt and spice). Served it with horseradish mashed potatoes and roasted pork. We'll definitely make this again!

Very tasty! Like others, I doubled the dressing but also added about 1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese.  The feta adds the perfect amount of flavor to this great salad.

Sorry, but I'll stick to my regular broccoli salad. It's has a better flavor for our tastes.
No need to blanch fresh broccoli. It's delicious raw.

This is a much healthier recipe than the "all mayo" version with bacon we usually eat.   I like my broccoli crisp so I didn't blanch like some people recommended; I even added some diced celery for more crunch.   I didn't have sunflower seeds so I used salted cashews; I also skipped the OJ since I didn't have that  but I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and pinch of sugar to the dressing which is similair to the version I usually make.

I'm used to making broccoli salad with bacon but I wanted to try something healthier. I used cranberries and pecans in mine. I also left out the OJ and used 2Tbsp of honey in the yogurt.

This was awesome. I used Chobani pineapple yogurt (regular yogurt with a little pineapple on the bottom) because that's what I had at the time. Plus I used dried cherries instead of raisins - but I've made it both ways and it's all good. I paired it with a grilled chicken flatbread sandwich. Delish!

I should have read more of the reviews--some suggested blanching the broccoli first.  I think that would have made a big improvement.  The flavor was pretty good but the broccoli was too crunchy.  May try again.

This is so much better than the broccoli salads heavy with mayo and bacon!  Exactly the same as Broccoli Salad 1 which is the most annoying thing about this website.  Regardless a tangy and refreshing salad.  I peeled an orange and squeezed a couple of segments for the juice, then cut up the rest for the salad, didn't add raisins.  I love the broccoli and orange combination.  Will be making this a lot, thank you for the great recipe.

The recipe itself is a good starting point but needs some creativity added to it. Doubled the amount of dressing and also the amount of raisins. Used jumbo sweet raisins, omitted the onions and added shredded carrots instead.

Easy and light summer side dish.  I took other reviewers suggestions and blanched the broccoli first - 1 min in boiling water then directly to ice water.  I will certainly make again.

My aunt made this once and it has fast become a traditional salad to accompany a BBQ.  Instead of orange juice and yoghurt, we made the dressing with mayonnaise and red wine vinegar. Quantities to your own taste!

I steamed the broccoli (slightly) as a few suggested....This was tasty and healthy.  I was hoping the dressing had a bit more zing; but I would definitely have it again.

We didn't care for this.  It was certainly edible, but I found it bland and the dressing too watery (maybe my yogurt was old??)  I blanched the broccoli as others suggested and made extra sauce, but all in all I just thought it lacked flavor.

I liked this healthier version of the traditional broccoli salad. 
I followed other reviewers suggestions: 
1. blanch the broccoli & spin out water
2. double or triple the dressing
3. I use equal amounts of yogurt & salad dressing
4. I add extra raisins & seeds

easy and fun for my 10 year old daughter to make. She felt like she prepared something to go with dinner. I really wanted to like this recipe, but the red onion was overpowering to say the least. I would use less than a quarter if I made this again and would add some other veggies too. Basically I would make a different salad (-_-)

We have a vinegar allergy in the family so tasty salads are always tough....used all yogurt/no mayo to avoid the vinegar and added some bacon in ('cause why not) and this was a huge hit! The splash of orange juice was a perfect touch.

I am not crazy about broccoli but the sauce has a great flavor and I did like the broccoli, however the recipe called for cooking the broccoli 1 or 2 minutes. At 1.5 minutes it was too long. My broccoli was too soft but it tasted good. I checked other broccoli salad recipes and they suggested it cook only 30 seconds. I will try that next time.

Easy ingredients, easy prep. I recommend this salad. I did, however, blanch the broccoli for a brighter color and less raw taste. Also great about this salad is that it's heart healthy- no sodium!

This recipe is well-intentioned, but the dressing is totally bland. It would do it good to add vinegar in to cut the blandness... Also I recommend cutting the broccoli up in more or less bite size florets, as well as like the others here mentioning (and which I did not do)..blanching the broccoli.

This was excellent. Only thing I changed was more dressing and I added a bit of season salt. Do not blanch the broccoli, just chop it up in small pieces.

Awful!!! I followed it exactly and it wasn't edible. I added red wine vinegar and a lot of garlic powder and it kind of cut through the plain yogurt taste. Definitely won't make again.

This recipe is just okay, in my opinion. It's probably a great go-to for potlucks/large groups. For my family's taste the dressing is a little bland. But not bad for a quick recipe to serve a group.

I enjoyed this very much but I did blanche the broccoli for 1 minute first, I also added a tsp of chopped garlic to give it a bit more zing. I never knew broccoli could taste so good!!!
