I thought this was excellent. All the other reviewers said that it could use a boost in flavor, so I looked through my kitchen and found some ingredients to spice it up. Prepared the cauliflower and couscous as directed. I sauted garlic, black pepper, and chicken in margarine for about 2-4 minutes. Then I chopped some green onions, and stirred this all together in an 8x8 pan. I added salt and more fresh ground black pepper before mixing in both mozzarella and cheddar. Probably about 2 cups?  It was excellent. I would have liked plain I am sure, but my bf is not a big couscous fan. Really great with leftovers, or as a side to a flavorful dish.

this was not bad, but i would say that i'll use it as a base in the future, using perhaps a mixture of veggies and maybe a few more spices.

This was pretty good. I used broccoli instead of cauliflower. I just cooked the couscous and broccoli together on the stovetop with a few cloves of garlic and salt and pepper, and then added the cheddar cheese.

Pretty bland, but great room for potential.  Probably would do a broccoli/cauliflower mix and throw in some other veggies too for a more flavorful/aesthetically pleasing dish.

I followed the recipe exactly (have made a similar recipe before) butthis was just so bland, even with adding extra pepper jack cheese.  Its a quick and easy side dish but needs something to kick it up quite a bit

This was a great recipe  I made this to go with a Steak Marsala that I made in my slow cooker. Instead of cauliflower  I used broccoli! Very good and could go with any steak or chicken dish.

We made this to go along with dinner tonight.  We didn't realize you had to cook the couscous first, so that created a big delay.  The dish turned out just okay.  The taste was boring and bland.  I would suggest adding some other spice to it.  I don't think I will make it again.

It wasn't bad, just a little bland.  My toddler loved it though.  Not sure what I could do to liven it up, but it has potential.

Made this for dinner today, and it is very good!!  Could have had a little more moisture to it.  Will add some chicken broth or something like that next time!

This was good, not great, but a good use of leftover couscous and I used some veggies left over from a weekend cook out.
I melted 2 Teas. of butter, blended in some salt & pepper, the nutmeg and some garlic powder, tossed the couscous/veggie mix with the butter mix to give the cheese something to stick to, then baked it 20 minutes at 365 degrees.
I'd make it again the way I did it, and will probably find something else to add to it. Thanks to the writer for the original; it was a great base to work from!

I gave this a rating of 2 stars because I did not like the way it tasted.  All I did was boil the cauliflower florets instead of using the microwave.  That is because I really don't care to use the microwave for cooking food.  This came out dried out at the temperature of 375 degrees F.  Maybe if the temperature was lower, and the dish was covered it might of came out better.
