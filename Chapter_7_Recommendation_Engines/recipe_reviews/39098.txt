I don't know if I did something wrong or if there was something wrong with my canned pumpkin but this was gross.  It was bitter and terrible.  I threw it away.

I am not sure what happened to the last reviewer's recipe, but I found this recipe to be wonderful!  My family does not care for crust very much, but we all love pumpkin pie.  We topped it with whipped cream, and even the kids loved it!

This was just ok - not great. I agree witht the reviewer who said it was too gelatinous. When I want a light pumpkin pie, I just make a regular pumpkin pie recipe without the crust (and sometimes I use artificial sweetner if I'm seriously dieting!) - I prefer that approach to this recipe.

I like the idea of a quick no-bake pumkin pie, but the consistency was too gelatine like. My kids didn't like it.

I thought this was fantastic!  Has the taste and texture of pumpkin pie.  I put it in ramekins and served with a bit of fat-free vanilla ice cream and it was a hit!

Imagine pumpkin jello. Looks nice but it had a bitter aftertaste. Could be the spices. I did not have "pumpkin pie spice" and used the standard spices listed on the Libby's can. The spices were a bit overpowering. Maybe some ice cream or whipped cream would help but I was trying to be good.
;)

I am giving this recipe four * because everybody else seem to love it.  I thought it was so-so and taste a little too much like to love it was custardy enough for me.

I recently have had to go gluten free & this pie saved Thanksgiving dessert for me. 1 out of my 3 kids said it was like pumpkin jello because there was no crust, but I think it is perfect!
  Thank you for sharing it with us!!

I have had a recipe like this before, everyone keeps saying it's all bad! But, really, that is how it is supposed to be, this recipe. The gelatin makes it jello like. It's great if your into gelatin things. You can taste the pumpkin in this!!

Okay. I prefer other recipes. I like baked pie better. Not baking it wasn't right. I wouldn't make it again.
