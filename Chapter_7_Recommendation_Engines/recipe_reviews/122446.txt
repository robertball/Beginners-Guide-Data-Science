My rating is based on making it in a bread machine.  It has a nice texture and is good for sandwiches and toasted; it's a little dry plain.  Very easy to cut.  I reduced the yeast to 3 tsp as I thought 2 pkgs of yeast (4.5 tsp) would be a little much for the machine and 3 tsp worked great.  Next time I think i'll up the amount of cornmeal as it isn't very "corny".  All in all a good loaf of bread.

Great recipe!  The family loved it!  I can't wait to try this recipe with some smoked cheddar and mexican spices baked in.  However, it's great as is and could be used for sandwiches and just about anything else.

Good taste, odd texture with the cornmeal.  Feels almost like sand in the bread.  Could be due to having problems with rising second time.  Loaves are rather heavy and dense.  Any ideas?

I had so much fun kneading this dough- it was so soft and pliant.  I started to knead after 2 cups of flour (with really sticky dough), and kneaded as I added in 1 and 1/4 cups more.  I left out the final 1/4 cup, as the dough was already smooth.  I rose it in a glass bowl, in a sinkfull of hot tap water. The bread is soft, with the crunch from the cornmeal making it even better!

It's OK.  Nothing special so to speak.  I think next time I'd add some real corn to it.  Felt more like cornbread than white bread.

After 40+ years of cooking, this was the absolute 1st loaf of yeast bread I ever attempted and it turned out GREAT. I mistakenly purchased RapidRise yeast (as opposed to Active) and had to make some minor adjustments to the initial steps so I don't know if the bread would have been even better if I had been able to follow the directions exactly. Except that I can't imagine how it could have been. Oh, yeah -- the recipe produced 2 loaves and the both of them together baked up wonderfully in my convection oven in 25 minutes.
