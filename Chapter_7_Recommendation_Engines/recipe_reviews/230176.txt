I used a variation of this rub (without soy sauce and using fresh herbs) as a quick marinade for some thick lamb sirloins. Quickly seared on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet, then finished in a 350 degree oven. So delicious! Thanks for the flavor boost with this rub recipe.

So easy and perfect for a cold winter night! Substituted worcestershire sauce for Soy sauce due to gluten problems, worked perfectly

Very good and very easy.  My family loved it.  Made it last week and I'm making it again today. I was looking for a recipe to cook lamb in the crock-pot as it is too hot to turn on the oven. They didn't peak my interest. I came across this recipe and thought it sounded good and it would work.  I used coconut aminos instead of soy sauce. Cooked it on high for 4 hours in the crock-pot.  It turned out more well done but it was moist and flavorful.  Used the leftovers to make a gyro like salad with butter lettuce, assorted cherry tomatoes, white onion, cucumber and my favorite homemade ranch dressing.  Will also use this wet rub to use with boneless leg of lamb on the grill.

I also used the coconut aminos, and I cooked it in a crock pot on low until the internal temp was 150 degrees. It was excellent. My very picky granddaughter actually ate two pieces!

Excellent recipe.  I tripled the quantities for a 5 pound boneless leg of lamb, and that was about right.  I cooked the lamb at 325* until it hit 133*, which took just over two hours.  It increased to 138* after 20 minutes of resting, and turned out a perfect medium rare throughout.  This will now be my go-to leg of lamb recipe.

This is the perfect marinade. Great on lamb. Also great on beef (especially prime rib roast)! Been making this recipe (from a 50 year old NY Times Cookbook) but recently lost the book. So glad to have found it here!

I followed the recipe to a t and couldn't be happier with the results. This is good enough to make lamb a regular in the general rotation.

Will definitely keep this one for one of those rare occasions when I have a leg of lamb.
I had a significantly bigger leg (bone in, a little over 4 lbs) and tried to scale everything up accordingly (with some cross referencing for cook time).
I don't think I would want to serve lamb on the rare side so I'd plan on move than the listed cook time even for the noted weight.
The herb crust was good but a little heavy on pepper for me so I think I'll bring that down just a bit and maybe add a little more on some of the other seasonings next time.

Rubbed this marinade on a rack of lamb. It was so good. I will be using this recipe from now on for herb crusted rack of lamb.
