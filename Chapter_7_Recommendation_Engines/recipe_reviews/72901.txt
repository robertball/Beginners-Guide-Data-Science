Quick and easy.  I'm a big fan of all-in-one meals, and this is a good one.
I thought it could use a little more pizazz, so next time I believe I'll jazz it up a bit with garlic and seasoned salt.  
However, even my finicky hubby liked it, so it will definitely be added to my dinner rotation.
***I tried this again for dinner over the weekend and used seasoned salt, garlic and Worchestershire sauce.  I also cooked it on the grill.  It was much better this time and was an easy cookout item.****

I loved this! I did follow the advice of others and added season salt and a little garlic. I also whisk up a packet of Lipton Beefy Onion Soup and pour it on top of the meat and veggies! I layer the potatoes, onions, and added carrots. Very easy to fix for a small group!

I would season the meat with Worchestershire and soy sauce, sprinkle it with season salt and maybe some garlic salt.  Makes it taste MUCH better.  Also could do it in the BBQ with ground beef instead for 15 mins on each side.

We really like this recipe. Used pork cubed steaks and lots of seasoning. came out delicious. I always make extras for hubbys lunch and he says it's even better next day. This works well on the grill or in the oven.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe has been handed down from my Nan's Nan to my Mom and I use it to make our meat pies. The secret is in the butter (meaning don't be stingy with it.) Thanks for another way to use this recipe

This little meal really was quite good. I made sure to use salt & pepper on my meat and poured some Worchestershire sauce on it too. The potatoes and onions were delicious.  I did have to cook it for an hour instead of 45 minutes because my vegetables weren't quite done yet. Still, good meal. Very filling.

A very fun idea but from reading the other reviews I concluded that it HAD to have more seasoning - I liberally sprinkled the meat with garlic powder and mesquite seasoning.  I spread butter on the steak as directed, but also put a few more dots on top of the onion/potato layer before folding up the packet. I thought it still could use more seasoning, so I ate it with BBQ sauce.  I would make this again for my own lunch, but not for company (unless it was part of a cook-out).

I sprinkle my cube steak with Adolph's meat tenderizer, so it's never tough!  In this recipe, I used a little butter instead of marg.  It's great, we have it once a week~:)

This was excellent.  My husband and I enjoyed it greatly.  Easy prep.  If you find that your potato's weren't cooked enough it may be because you aren't cutting them thin enough.  I stuck the recipe base but changed it up as well: I seasoned it (s&p) on both sides as well as rubbed the butter into the meat on both sides.  It's just my husband and I so I used 2 cube steaks, 1 large potato divided, 3/4 small onion divided, 1/2 of a red bell pepper divided, 1 clove of garlic per foil, salt & peppered it with a couple of dollops of butter for each foil 'packet'.  It cooked in the 45 minutes allotted I had no problems what-so-ever.  The pepper gave it a nice tingly finish (great for our cold weather) and the meat practically fell apart.  Def a keeper.

My daughter and I really liked this.  I did marinade my steak for a few hours before cooking and added a little of the marinade to the packet - over the potatoes. I also added a bit of minced garlic in there as well.  Since I had marinated the steak, I just put a little butter on top of the potatoes.  It was very tasty!  We will definately have this again!  Thanks!!

I put this together in the morning and popped the packets in the oven for dinner in the evening.  I used crazy salt instead of salt and pepper.  Like it says it is a very quick and easy all in one meal thanks for the recipe.

I added a few things, some orange pepper I had on hand, some garlic salt, extra butter on top of potatoes, small slices of zuccinni,  but basically left the recipe as is, and it was GREAT! Luckily we have 2 packets leftover----looking forward to them  tomorrow. And will definitely do cube steaks this way again and again. Many thanks.

I dislike cube steak, however this recipe made me think I could give it one more chance.  It did not disappoint.  I was pleasantly surprised and will most definitely be making it again.  I used the butter, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Added potatoes and carrots with the onions.  It does call for a punch of something, so next time I will use Lawrys salt and some worcestire sauce.

This was a nice recipe that makes a lot of sense. I added spices like other reviewers suggested. However, the meat was very tough. Next time I try, I'm going do everything the same except then put the foils in the slow cooker and see how that turns out.

This was good -- we had it for the first time tonight.  I sliced the potato a bit too thin though and it got a little mushy. Next time, I think I will alternate layers of potato and onion, and season the meat more.

Super easy to make and clean up is a breeze but it definetly needs a lot more seasoning.  I found even the potatoes just had no taste, will be a great dish if you season your meat and potatoes the way you like.

Thanks to the reviews, I kicked this up with some chipotle sauce(a little) on the meat prior to the margarine. Then I used some garlic herb seasoning, seasoned salt, and a red and black pepper blend. It came out great, and since it was so easy to make, I'll definately be doing this one again.

This recipe was just okay.  I thought it was quite bland and in need of more spices.  I added sliced carrots and seasoned everything with Lawry's seasoned salt in addition to the salt  pepper. 
On the flip side - it was super easy to make and hardly any clean-up since everything was in the packets.  It's a great idea for a meal, but it needs something...

made this as recipe called for but baked it slowly over hot coals in our firepit.  it was good with a smoky flavor and cooking it indirectly made it tasty and tender.

I did increase the seasonings as recommended in other reviews but it still fell a little short. Don't be afraid to liberally season. I also added some chopped baby carrots and baked for 1 hour at 350 degrees. Gave it a beef stew feel. Will make it again. It's a quick and easy dinner.

So good and so easy!  The only change I made was using butter and a spicy pepper mix instead of plain salt and pepper.

My take:  Seasoned one side of meat with chili powder, onion powder, and Montreal Steak.  Spread butter on the other side, topped with layers, sliced tomatoe, potatoes, onions, mushrooms, carrots, potatoes, bell peppers and sprinkled with garlic pepper. Wrapped in foil and grilled over charcoal. Tasty and tender enough to cut with a fork.

Excellent and easy to make.  I added a little diced red onion and shredded carrot as suggested by another reviewer for added color, texture and taste.  I also made a half recipe instead of an entire recipe.  I will be making it again, particularly while cucumbers are in season.

We always made these when we went camping. We would add carrots and some mozzarella cheese and season salt. Cooking them on the campfire made them taste awesome.

Needed longer cooking time for me. I used red potatoes and they took an hour and a half to get soft. The steak was also red with only 45 minutes. It needed more spices. My boys liked it when it was finally cooked and I will make it again with modifications.

This is a good basic recipe idea for a simple and quick meal. The cooking time was a little off, I had to cook mine for about an hour, but the cube steak came out tender and so did the vegetables. I followed other reviewers advice and added Worcestershire sauce, but it was still a little bland. Next time I think I will add some garlic and maybe some Mrs. Dash to give it more flavors. Bottom line, I will definitely make is again.

I tried this recipe with the cube steaks (as written) and it was OK.  I followed the advice to add more seasoning (seasoned salt, pepper, garlic, etc.) and that helped.  I made it last night again to use up some London Broil and it was excellent!  It took a bit longer to cook - 1 1/2 hours - but everyone liked it.  I think it's a good, basic go-to recipe that you can adapt to make a decent week night dinner.  The kids can even help to make the "packets"!

I found this tasty. I added worcestershire sauce and garlic powder. I think it still needed maybe some celery or bell pepper. Quick and easy! no clean up to speak of.

Good idea.  I had to dr it up a bit.  I browned the meat/potatoes & I added onions.  then baked it.  Sliced the potatoes long-ways & they ended up perfect!  Only suggestion my husband had was to let it have gravy -- so w/the left over 'juice' i had I used that to make him some gravy for his leftover lunch.

This a great, fast recipe. I prepared them in the morning,covered in foil, and refrigerated for the day. Threw in the oven that evening and had dinner within 1/2 hour. Kids and hubby loved it! We look forward to having it again.

I thought this recipe was a great starting base. I followed the advice of other reviews and seasoned meat with Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and Johnny's seasoning salt. Then I seasoned the potatoes and onions with Johnny's and pepper. The result was a flavorful meal that left my husband and his friend begging for more.

After reading reviews I decided to add some flavor to this.  I only cook for 2 so I cut the recipe in half, and on one cube steak added some A1 steak sauce, and put little cubes of butter instead of spreading, and then topped with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, then potatoe and onion.  I also added some whole gralic cloves to this.  With the second I added some specailty hot sauce my DF has and also the butter/salt/pepper/onion/potato/garlic.  Mine was good nothing out of this world, DF's was too spicy for him.  I didn't realize he wasn't eating that hot sauce because it was to hot for him so needless to say he didn't enjoy his meal.  I think when I make this again (yes I'll make it again) I'll use Franks hot sauce for DF, and cut out the butter as it was plenty juicy with the steak and hot sauce on them.  All in all the recipe is a good base, but I definetly would add some flavor to it.

Excellent!  After reading some of the reviews, I made a few minor changes.  I added chopped baby carrots, used McCormick’s Grill Seasoning for extra flavor and I raised the heat to 425.  Yum!  Going to add this to our favorites!  Plan on trying it with chicken next!

I thought this would be a good, easy, and flavorful meal with extra seasonings as suggested by other reviewers. I was wrong. After cooking for closer to an hour, the onions were still quite crispy (Which I liked) but the potatoes were nowhere near tender. And the meat was extremely tough, even though I beat it thin. I think this might be a much better cook-over-the-campfire recipe than one to cook in an oven.

I used dubed venison steaks. They turned out wonderful. I did a few things different. I used onion and garlic powder. I didn't have any onions. I also sprinkled the meat with soy sauce and worcestershire sauce. The meat and potatoes turned out very moist and tender. I will definitely use this recipe again.

We thought this recipe was great.  We used to call it Silver Turtles when we went camping, but we used hamburger patties.  This is much better, and a new way to cook cube steak.   I would definitely suggest adding salt and pepper and your favorite spices, especially to the meat.  Another way to "jazz it up," as another reviewer said, would be to add some other vegetables.  Carrots and bell peppers come to mind, one could even do squash and rutabagas.  The possibilities are endless.  Thanks for the idea, Katie Marie!
