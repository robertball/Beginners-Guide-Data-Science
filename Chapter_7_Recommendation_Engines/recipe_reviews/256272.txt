Delicious and easy. Only thing I would change next time is to use more stock in the crockpot and less water.. After this had cooked nearly the full time, almost all the liquid had been absorbed by the rice... instead of adding water, I added chicken stock.  I dont know that I would start out with more liquid in the crockpot as it  could be mine runs a little hot. Just be aware I needed to add liquid at the end to make is a little soup like

Super delicious.  The whole family loved it.  Be making it again and again. I added some onions and garlic, did some adjustments on the liquid amount and seasoning but that is it!

I read the reviews about blandness so I decided to add in from the start: I used 5cups of chicken broth and about 1.5 of water. There may â€˜have been some veggie broth mixed in. I only had chicken thighs so used about 3 (whatever was in the package I took out of the freezer last night); I added chopped onions, minced garlic, ginger, fish sauce. I also added the sesame oil before serving. I was skeptical but it turned out delicious. Even my husband who fancies himself an amateur food critic, loved it.

This came out like a paste. I thought it was bland, and the texture was entirely unappetizing.
