Not something i'll make all the time. Kinda blah compared to some of the stuff my boyfriend and I cook. I liked it, He didn't. Guess its all in your own personal taste

This recipe has great potential. Just dump the carrots and caraway and use a diced green or red pepper in their place. Top it with an egg and some salsa and you have a tasty dish.

Different, but not bad.  Ended up cooking longer to get carrots and all done.  We topped ours with a spoonful of sour cream for an extra touch.  Not a "wow" recipe, but a good recipe.

This was an awesome hash, but after making the sauce and tasting it, we decided not to add it. The only thing I added was a little ground pepper. Even my kids loved it.
