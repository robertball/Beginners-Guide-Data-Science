This recipe was very simple, and fantastic.  I threw in some peppers that I had BBQ'd the night before, and had some left over.  Great addition.

I tried this recipe 3x. Fresh ingredients all the way. For some reason. The balsamic vinagrette was nasty. I thought darn, bottle is bad even while in date. Went and exchanged it for another brand, same style of dressing. Same problem. I love love all the ingredients, but didn't like the balsamic vinaigrette with my fresh veggies. I really don't know what to say. Sorry. Maybe a different dressing or half of what is suggested in the recipe.

Next time use 1/2 of the balsamic vinegar.
