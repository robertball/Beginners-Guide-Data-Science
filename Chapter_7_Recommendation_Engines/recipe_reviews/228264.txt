I didn't use the orange jelly.  It was good w/o it.  I also doubled the cream cheese and sugar.  I had a little of the cream cheese dip left over, but it was good to use for the extra strawberries.  Everyone loved it.  I'm going to make it again next week!

Used the pre-made cookie dough from the local bakery on full cookie sheet.  Doubled the recipe worked great for that size.  Used mango, kiwi, grapes, blueberries, strawberries, plums, and nectarines.  After I spooned some fruit glaze over the top instead of the jelly.  Made the night before and it held up in the fridge okay  wouldn't make it any earlier though or it would get soggy.  Everyone loved it!

This was such a fun, tasty, and easy recipe. I halved the sugar and vanilla. I also substituted a ready made shortbread crust (I imagine a graham cracker crust would be good too). Next time I'm going to try whipping the cream cheese blend, to make it a bit lighter. I didn't do the marmalade topping. I imagine putting some sort of lemon drizzle on top next time.

All of the components work very well together!!  I didn't have fresh blueberries, but it was delicious.  I grated some orange zest over the top to add extra orange flavor and my kids went crazy.  Very good and easy--next time due to personal preference I'll use a homemade cookie dough.

I used a combo of 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup lower fat cream cheese instead of whipped cream... came out great!

I made this for a treat for a family party, and it got great reviews!        I changed just 2 things: First, I prefer homemade cookies, so I made my own, rather than using pre-made refrigerated dough in a tube.  It took the entire batch of sugar cookie dough to  cover my pizza pan, but turned out perfectly.  Then, I chose not to use the glaze on the fruit, as I didn't want to add the extra sweet.  It was a good choice - it tasted fine without it, and the fruit did not turn.  (It was about 6 hours from when I sliced it, to when we ate it.)  I will make this again!

Turned out great. Used strawberries, raspberries, and huckleberries. I didn't have any orange marmalade so I substituted huckleberry syrup for the drizzle. Delicious!!!

Grew up eating this and still love it!  I use orange, peach or apricot preserves for the marmalade too and they all work well.

My family and friends love this stuff! I used the ready made cookie dough. Instead of using the cream cheese I used heavy whipping cream and sugar. It was a hit!
