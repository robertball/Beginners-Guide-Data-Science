Being a 'traditionalist', no bread machine for me!  Used the exact recipe & ony subbed a good margarine.  Resulted in a perfect loaf, great for breakfast toast/grilled cheese with a very soft 'crumb'.

Excellent for French Toast! Probably good for sandwiches too, but we used the whole loaf for breakfast! My family will never accept French Toast made with store-bought bread again! For those who, like myself, don't have a bread machine this bread is really easy to make the "old fashioned" way. Just proof the yeast in the warm water and add the rest of the wet ingredients. Add most of the flour and kneed in the rest. Let it rise once, then shape it on a cookie sheet or put it in a loaf pan and let it rise again. Bake at 375 for about 30 min or until it's golden brown on top and sounds hollow when you knock on it.

This is delicious and adapts wonderfully to a "traditional" bake outside the bread machine - just let rise until doubled (ab. 1hr), knead, form into loaves in/on pan, rise until doubled again (30-45 min), and bake about 30 min. Delicious!

This made a beautiful loaf! I subbed the oil for real butter to make a richer bread, but kept everything else the same. Thanks for the post!

I made the recipe as written and my family loved it.  My husband told me it tasted like his mother's easter bread so I pulled out the recipe and made  a few substitutions.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, switched melted butter for the oil, and milk for the water, then added 1 cup of golden raisins when the machine tells you to add them.  I can't keep it in the house.

I used the 2 lb/medium crust setting and it worked out wonderfully. I had to add a little more flour (due to the humid summer environment here).

I used my Kitchen Aid to help me make this bread. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes, then added the melted butter (which I used instead of vegetable oil), the eggs and the dry ingredients. I did not use the full amount of salt, a half teaspoon was plenty. I only needed just a small amount of flour to get it to stop sticking to the bottom of the bowl when I kneaded it with the bread hook. I kneaded it with the bread hook for five minutes, then set the dough to rise in a greased and covered bowl on a warm heating pad for an hour. Once it doubled, I kneaded it into a loaf-shape, then plopped it into a greased loaf pan and set it to rise on the warm heating pad again. 350* for 30 minutes and it was perfect. I used it this morning for Pioneer Woman's french toast and it was perfect. Great bread recipe. I'll make this one again.

Loved it!  Stayed fresh longer than any other bread maker recipe I've tried.  This recipe doesn't have as many eggs as most egg bread recipes, and so the taste is slightly different, but it's still delicious.  This bread is wonderful toasted or as french toast.  For those of you with smaller bread makers, be careful as this recipe makes a big loaf.  My bread maker makes 2lb loaves, and this one was the biggest one I've ever made.

This recipe was great, we ran out of bread so I just decided to pop a loaf in the bread machine.  I too used real butter.  I love the taste & texture, was nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  Could've used more eggs, but it was great anyways!

This has to be the very best bread I have ever made. It is smooth and very toothsome. I did beat the eggs up into the water before putting into container, used 2# loaf and medium crust. Wonderful bread. I will make this again.

This was really good. I used Whole wheat pastry flour for 3/4 of the flour and used unbleached all purpose for the rest. Makes great sandwich bread.

Very good, but not at all "golden" in color.  Looked and tasted like regular white bread.

This is one of the most beautiful breads I've made in my bread maker.  Fortunately, my machine has a loaf shaped pan so I didn't have to do dough rise only and switch to loaf pans.  I used the 2lb. loaf setting, and it was perfect.   Gorgeous golden loaf, slices well, and tomorrow, we will have French toast with it for breakfast!  I have another loaf going right now!

This reminds me of a recipe for Sally Lunn Bread I found in an old cookbook. I used butter instead of oil. I also used this dough for Monkey Bread. It's a bit like brioche and makes great french toast, too.

This bread was fantastic!  It was easy to make and baked into a beautiful loaf with a great consistancy.  Everyone in my family raved about it and the kids requested that I use this bread for their school sandwiches the next day.  I whisked the eggs with the water for better blending.  FYI This makes a pretty large loaf of bread (it was touching the top of the machine door).  Usually I select bread (light) but with this size I needed to choose bread (medium) as I do not have a large loaf selection.  The extra baking was perfect.  I will definitely make this bread again!  Thx for the great bread machine recipe!

Yummy! This bread was dense, full of flavor, a lovely color, and great with strawberry freezer jam! (I made it with 3 T. honey instead of the sugar and replaced 1 1/2 cups of the flour with whole wheat)

I adjusted this to be a bit healthier. I used olive oil and 1/2 c. egg substitute. The taste is excellent, however, the next time I make it, I will have to scale it down a bit. I have a 1.5 to 2 lb. bread maker. When it was baking it rose so high, that it was baking against the window. Thank you for this great recipe.

More like a white bread. Not yellow in color like most egg breads and not as dense.  Nothing special.

I just bought a new breadmaker and by far this is one of my favorite recipes. It is great for sandwiches, french toast, and just eating plain. Simple to put together and turns out beautifully everytime!

Excellent bread. I don't have a bread machine so I use the "old-fashioned" method of proofing and mixing and kneading.  I read somewhere (probably here on AR) that enriched breads need a longer rise time. For the first rise it needed about 1 hr. 15 mins, and 45 mins for the second rise. I then baked it in an 8x4 loaf pan at 350 for 30 minutes. I've made this bread twice now, first time I used the oil, second time melted butter.  We like the butter loaf better. This will be my go-to white bread from now on.

We love this bread! Delicious on it's own, with butter, as a sandwich, for French toast... amazing French toast! Will be in the regular rotation of bread-making for when I need a tried-n-true recipe!

Beautiful bread, soft, moist and tasty. Easy to make by hand. Had instant dry yeast, so just mixed the yeast in with the dry ingredients, then add wet ingredients. Mix with wooden spoon and turn out on to a floured table, and knead. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the recipe does not state a loaf size. I set my machine for a 2 lb loaf, medium crust, but once it started to bake I realized that it's easily a 2.5 lb. The ratios are great though, lovely flavour and colour.

This makes amazing french toast. Grilled cheese sandwiches too.

Bakes beautifully on the 2lb medium crust setting

It was a little dry and flavorless but pretty good.  I didn't use a bread machine though so that might have had something to do with it.  Might be really good with herbs though.  Mine kind of had a Texas toast type of consistency.

Large, dense, eggy- delicious bread. Will make again for Easter. This would be excellent used to make bread pudding.
