This was amazing! I added a little crushed red pepper because the asian restaurant in town serves an almost identical salad amd we like the little bit of heat. I also left out the cucumbers because my husband can't eat them.

I made this and really enjoyed it. I had planned to make miso soup. I had the kelp but not the other necessary ingredients. I found this salad recipe that would use it and it turned out to be delicious.

Kombu did not soften enough but flavors were good.
