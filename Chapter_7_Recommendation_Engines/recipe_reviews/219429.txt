My Grammy made this every Thanksgiving that I can remember. Only thing she did different was to add a couple of eggs and canned mushrooms when mixing the stuffing, and, of course, she used sage. Thankfully she taught me how to make it before she passed away. This is a great stuffing recipe!!

As the submitter of this recipie I need to correct a misconception. This is not an oyster dressing (I did say oyster dressing in my text, but it really isn't). That's why I called it "NOT Ya Mama's Oyster Dressing". This is sooo good, try it as written, please. Thanks!

My mom used broth from the turkey and crumbled/cubed loaf bread rather than bread crumbs. Also use the liquid from the oysters! I never stuff the turkey with dressing, put apples, onions, etc. in the cavity.

No, but it is my Grandma's recipe, from New Orleans, LA.  Only she didn't add the cheese or the oregano.  And she added ground lean meat to strecth it.  We had a big family.  It is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was FANTASTIC!! The only change I made was to half the recipe because not many people in my family like oysters.  However, for those who do, this is the best I've had!

I just got done putting this all together. It has to sit in the fridge until tomorrow for Christmas dinner. I had to pre taste it to make sure it has the right amount of spices for flavor. I almost DON'T want to share with anyone else!!!!! I am INSTANTLY HOOKED AND IT HASN'T EVEN COOKED YET!!!! I will use this recipe from now on. I did do some of my own tweaking, simply because of habit, like adding very tiny chops of celery and a different Parmesan cheese blend because that was what I had available. Until someone else can come up with something better, WHICH I AM NOT SURE IS POSSIBLE, I am forever married to this recipe. Thank you for sharing it!!!!

This is a very good recipe as is. I did add some tony's and maybe a little too much cayenne pepper but it was great. I had it on crackers and loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving per the recipe and it was great. However, I made it again for Christmas with these modifications. First, I changed the breadcrumbs from store bought to fresh ones and reduced the amount. I used about 3/4 cup fresh for 20 ounces of oysters. I also added a cup of chopped celery. Instead of oregano, I used sage. Finally, with the celery, onion, and garlic, I sautéed two slices of bacon. Heavenly!

this dish came put amazing. I followed the recipe exactly to detail. I made a big pan for new years eve.  half the pan was left over, so the next day I added rice to the rest, stuffed and rolled the rest on cabbage leafs and baked for 1 hour.  the oyster stuffing cabbage rolls blew my wife's original cabbage rolls away.  will use this again.

If you like oysters, you'll love this.  I made it for both Thanksgiving and Christmas and it was a big hit.  Also so easy to make.

I have been trying to find something similar to my grandma's oyster dressing which she made with saltine crackers. I followed this recipe exactly and had high hopes but it turned out very mushy and swimming in butter. I for sure did not use too  much/too little of anything unless I shouldn't have used all of the oyster liquid? Not sure why mine turned out as it did and everyone else that has reviewed it said theirs was perfect. I will probably try again but cut the butter down and use less liquid and maybe less spices or plain breadcrumbs as the spice flavor was a little strong for me.

This has become my go-to recipe for Oyster Dressin every year.  It has never disappointed!  Everyone from our Maw-Maw, Grandparents down to the grandkids enjoys it. I do add a little extra Cayenne as we like it with a kick and I have added chopped celery (although not always) and its still one of those dishes that leaves no leftovers!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!
