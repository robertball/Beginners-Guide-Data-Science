I've been making these every Christmas for years and are my most requested cookie. They are awesome! Since they don't make Skor bits anymore, I buy regular Skor candy bars and crush them in a ziploc bag--you will need 7-8 candy bars for this(Rite-Aid pharmacy usually has them on sale for 4/$1.00 before the holidays).

I made a few alteration on this bar and it turned out fantastic!  First I doubled the crumb mixture.  I found I did not have eonough to coat the bottom of the 13 x 9 pan and have some for the topping.  Next, I used a whole bag of toffee chips.  I found heath chips at WalMart.  I covered the layer of milk with toffee chips.  I used slivered almonds in these bars to give it a "candy bar" apeal and taste.  On top of the whole thing I used 1/4 bag of chocolate toffee bits.  Man were they rich but melt in your mouth yummy.

I thought these were good although I had a hard time getting them out of the pan. You definately have to let them cool completely before taking them out of the pan. Very rich and chewy. Even though I thought these were tasty they remained untouched at my Christmas get together. No one was interested in them but me!

This is a really yummy easy recipe.  I do however think that the directions are written in a very confusing manner and you MUST read them a few times before making them.  The way it describes the layering can get weird if you dont pay attention.  My opinion anyway!  I only buy chocolate chips in 12 ounce bags so I used only that rather than 2 cups.  I omited the nuts and used a bag of crushed heath bar.  These were great bars, not overy sweet thanks to the bottom crust.  Make sure that you do not cook par cook the crust longer than the 15 minutes.  Cool COMPLETELY before cutting, therwise you will have a gooey mess with the warm condensed milk.

Meh.  Don't see what all the fuss is about.  They tasted like a bunch of ingredients thrown together and as a result there wasn't any "wow" or "pop" and they are very, very sweet.

I think these are ok. However, I went to my husbands corporate christmas party last night and everyone he introduced me to said, "ohhhhh! Youre the one who makes those "things" they are incredible!!" So, for having a stellar reputation before I even walk through the door this recipe gets 5 stars.

These were delicious and came out beautifully . I used almonds and would probably use pecans next time. These were pretty easy too. I lined my pan w/ foil and sprayed it w/ Pam for Baking and had no problems with sticking, they came out great. I would definitely make these again!

These are wonderful.  Very rich as others have noted.  Hubby and roomate LOVED them.  I think  next time I might put butterscotch or peanut butter chips on top for a variation. These are a keeper!

These are really good. I didn't read the directions properly, and sprinkled all of the toffee bits on prior to baking, but it still came out great. If you cut into 24 bars, they're a very generous size. You could definitely stretch this to more like 30-36 servings. I liked them best straight from the fridge, they were very chewy when cold.

I've made these several times and they never last long!! I always double the crumb mixture as I prefer more and add in peanut butter chips and then white chocolate chips for color.  They're very rich but ohhhh so tasty.  My husband always requests these as do all of my co-workers whenever we have a potluck!!! Yummy!!!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the directions exactly and they produced a delicious bar.  I cut them in small pieces because they are very rich.

These are delicious and very hard to stop eating.  My oven must bake a little hotter because they were done at 24 minutes.  My husband has always been a huge fan of 7 layer bars and says these are better.  I especially like the fact that no mixer is involved.

We all loved these cookie bars. Made them without the nuts, as we're not fans, but otherwise as directed. I printed this recipe many years ago, so the version I used was slightly different (says it was submitted by Hershey's Kitchens instead of Eagle Brand), but it's the same recipe. I wasn't able to find Skor baking bits, as my copy of the recipe calls for (do they make those anymore?), but I used a combination of Heath bits (with chocolate) and the almond brickle toffee chips and they turned out fine. Better the next day, after the flavors have had a chance to blend.

Wow these we're amazing!!! The only thing I did differently is I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate since my husband doesn't like chocolate chips. I also couldn't find toffee bits so I bought a few Heath bars and chopped them up real fine. Lastly, I used finely chopped peanuts for the nuts. They would be great served with vanilla icecream. I will definitely make these again!!!

These are absolutely fantastic and easy to make!  Hubby took a spoonful from the pan, right out of the oven and couldn't wait for them to cool.  So he spooned it into a bowl and ate it warm.  (Would like to experiment with making in individual serving dishes and serving warm with vanilla ice cream.)

OMG be warned, these are delicious! They didn't last long! My husband agreed that they needed more toffee- next time I will use more toffee and a little less chocolate chips.

I stumbled across this recipe on the back of the toffee chips bag years ago (it's no longer there).  The sweetened, condensed milk makes them moist and flavorful.  I have always modified the recipe by using milk chocolate chips and omitting the nuts.  The result is NOT your average cookie bar!!!

Wow! It really is that good. It's a little time consuming, but worth it. I add walnuts in so that it does remind me of a chocolate chip cookie. I also buy a bag of the heath bits in the baking section and use the entire bag. Turns out rich and delicious every time!

My 3 guys loved these bars. Not nut lovers in our baked good we didn't add them. Next time I'll eliminate the 1/4 toffee bits from the top at the end. They were crunchy and stuck in your teeth. I didn't like the soft texture of the bar with the tiny bit of crunchy top here and there it felt like something was on it that shouldn't be.

Excellent!  Even messed up the recipe, had to add the 1-1/2 cho chips and nuts after I put the crust in the pan without them, so i just sprinkled it on top, followed the recipe after that and they were devine!!! Also, I did not have the toffee pieces and I used pecans.  Thanks so much for sharing

These squares are outstanding! I made them exactly as described, other than using different brand name ingredients. They were a hit with family and friends.
