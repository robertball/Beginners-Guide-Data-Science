o.k. What was the vanilla for? Anyway I suggest mixing 1 Quart heavy whipping cream and 2/3 cup of granulated sugar. After mixing sugar and cream place it in a stand mixer and whip until peaks form.  I frosted an 8 inch cake with plenty left over so you will easily be able to frost a larger cake. Everyone loved it!

changes i made: 2T more sugar, less vanilla, one more T of piping gel. (sweetness, consistency/hold). it was amazing, the piping gel obviously makes no miracles, but it does its job. it sabilized my frosting enough so i could have it out of the fridge without worries, held very well. adding refrigeration helps it stay even more.
