This was simple and easy... but I would half the rice, double the veggies, and use a tad more liquid than the recipe said to use.  We're trying to lower our cholesterol, so the more veggies I can squeeze into our day the better.  It went great with the Thai Coconut Soup recipe from Allrecipes.  And I was excited to use bok choy for the first time in a recipe.  I didn't use the leafy part of it, don't know if you're supposed to or not.  Thanks for sharing!

This isn't bad, although I thought it could use a little more seasoning.  I didn't use chicken bullion, however, so perhaps that is the problem; I used 2 cans of chicken stock and it seemed to work well.  I did have some issues with my rice cooker; perhaps the amount is too much for it?  I had to keep unplugging and starting it on cook again.  It does make lots of rice for two people anyway, so I believe I'll halve it next time.  I agree with the other reviewer who suggests more liquid, less rice, and more veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!
