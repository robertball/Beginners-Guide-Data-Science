My 5-star review is for the ice cream only.

This ice cream recipe is from The Smitten Kitchen, which is adapted from Claudia Fleming’s  “The Last Course” cookbook.

I made the ice cream exactly as written. It is very rich and tangy, and the perfect sweetness.  It’s a keeper!

Made the cobbler and boy was it delish.  My only change was I omitted almond extract because I didn't have any.  
Will definitely put this recipe in my book.  
Thanks Smart Cookie.   You sure you can't share your Chocolate  chip recipe?
