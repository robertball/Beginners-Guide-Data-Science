You have to really like pickled green beans to enjoy this recipe!  I also grew up in Utah, and yes, this is a popular way to preserve the mother load of green beans most people grow in their gigantic gardens here.  I am not a huge fan of really spicy food, so I tweaked the amount of chile peppers.  I only used two that I divided between the 8 jars. It gave it a little zing, but it was not over powering. REMEMBER,  THIS IS FOR 8 PINT JARS! It isn't too salty if prepared correctly. Happy Canning! :)

The first time I tried dilly beans was over 10 years ago, and haven't had them since.  I made them this summer out of our garden fare and these are delicious!  On half the jars I left out the pepper and they are still delicious.  I also used about 1/2 the pickling spice and 1/2 the mustard seed, and the flavor was still great.  I might leave out all the pickling spice and put in all the mustard next time.  Great recipe!

These are wonderful! Been making them for years and the salt to water to vinegar ratio is spot on. Love the addition of pickling spice and mustard.  Try them in a bloody Mary or on your next relish tray.

Our family has always been given homemade dilly beans for Christmas. I wanted to make some and hoped that they would come out AT LEAST as good as the ones we are usually given. THESE WERE BETTER! I followed the recipe exactly, but threw in a tiny bit more garlic for our Italian tastes! I will be making these every year from now on! P.S. This was only my second time canning! Give 'em a try!

I grew up in Utah and Dilly beans were all the rage.  I must say it was never one of my favs.  I do like how this one has peppers.  I think the other person rating this did not see that this is a recipe for 8 jars, so one cup salt does not sound all that bad to me

Oh my gosh these are good! I completely forgot the mustard seed and can't wait to make them again and include it. I also doubled the amount of dried peppers because my husband and I both like spicy things.  What a great way to preserve summer's bounty of green beans! This was my first try at pickling beans and WOW! Loved it! Will make again!

This was only my second attempt at canning, but they came out great. They were pretty sour (made me pucker every time!), but my family loved them.

Three weeks ago I made my first batch of "Dilly Beans" and have been waiting anxiously for the day I could "pop" the seal.  The day has arrived and OMG they are delicious!   Another review stated that they ran out of brine and so did I...so just a FYI, I would probably make a double batch of the brine.

Other than the alum, this recipe is identical to the one I've been making for years.  People FIGHT to get to the jar.  I think they're delicious.  You can make them hotter by using a hotter pepper -- red chile peppers look pretty but they're rather mild for spiciness.  I use "Ho Chi Minh" peppers from the farmers market (dried) -- lemon yellow and slightly larger than a Serrano.  Plenty hot!  You could even go with a Habanero if you want them really HOT.  OH, and I prefer cider vinegar to white.

I use a mixture of water, salt and vinegar for the brine, then add garlic cloves, cayenne pepper and dill to the jars with the beans.  Love these!

Really tasty. I used fresh jalepeno from the garden instead of dried chilis, and skipped pickling spice and added coriander. It is REALLY salty, though. I cut the recipe in half to work with the amount of beans I had, and still really salty. Next time I'll cut the salt in half, but it's a great recipe.

Tried this recipe two weeks ago. Just opened the first jar . . . way too salty! Not much heat either. I have one jar I doubled the peppers & added a couple jalapeno slices to I'll try next week. But definitely cut this salt in half. they should be okay used in a Bloodymary, not bad flavor just salty & no heat.

Processing time is not long enough. I suggest to process at least 15 minutes. I recommend the Pickled Green Beans recipe.

I made a spicy variety of beans last year (not this recipe) and tried this one .. this year.  I find the pickling SPICE .. really stands out in this recipe ... which I followed exact.  wasn't enough HEAT or DILLY for our liking .. but did turn out fine and were quick and easy!

If you live above 1,000 ft., you must increase the boiling water time accordingly. Best source for good information about this is the Ball Blue Book guide to preserving.

Terrible recipe.  Wasted money, time & energy (48 jars worth) on this recipe, and the beans were inedible!  They were so salty that I even tried to rinse with cold water before eating and I still couldn't eat them.  I gave many jars away as gifts before I had a chance to taste the beans & I had ppl returning the jars of beans to me since they were so awful.

These were good, but a little too much mustard for my preference.  I brought them out for some friends to try.  They really liked them and disagreed with me about the mustard.  I think I will try them again next year but alter the recipe a bit.

These seemed like they would be very sour, but I just rinsed them in cool water before serving and they are great. Just like pickles!! I added lots of garlic, too.

There were a few problems I had with this recipe.  First, it was so briny that no one wanted to eat them, even when they were trying to be polite!  I know salt amounts can be adjusted but it is sad to find this out after canning 8 pints of them.  The other problem is the difficulty with getting the beans into the jar in a standing position.  You have to make every bean the exact same length or the jar gets jammed, nothing further will go in- even then, it is a feat of magic to make them fit.  What isn't evident is how much they will shrink during the processing.  I lost at least 1/3 the length of every bean, which made them appear to be floating in the brine as opposed to sitting tightly and looking attractive.  Add to that how they were uneven, it was extremely ugly for a gift.  My husband said it would have been manageable had all of these changes been made, but I just don't want to put so much work into something with unknown, possibly uneven results.

This was a great recipe.  I used it to make pickles as well.  The only thing I changed was to add hot peppers.  HOT is better.

We had been given a jar of dilly beans from someone that had thier own (differnt) recipe. We loved them so much we wanted to try and make our own and tried this recipe. We followed the recipe just how it said since it was our first time making it. Waited patiantly two weeks to see how they turned out... And they were WAY TO SALTY! plus, they were not spicy :( We know from the other ones we had been given that they dont have to be that salty for sure! Next time we will cut way back on the salt content. Also. After being disappointed about no spice we put some cayanne into the jar and left it over night. Now they are spicy, but still to salty. So the lesson here is add cayanne at canning time if you want them to be spicy and use less salt! I think we will be trying to get our friends recipe instead but if they wont give it up we will try again with those changes.

1st try at canning!  I thought it turned out pretty good.  I think they are a little salty and not quite spicy enough.  But pretty good for a first try anyway!
