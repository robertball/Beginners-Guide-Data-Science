This is one of our favourite recipes.  We have been making it for years.  I brown the shanks and then place in slow cooker.  I cook veg and sauce until boiling and then poured ontop of shanks.  I cook on low for 7 hours (or high for 4 hours.)  So tender! I then remove shanks and thicken sauce with a water/cornstarch mixture.  Yummy!!!!

This recipe is Lambtastic!  The first time I made it, used half the amount of lamb and I halved all the other ingredients.  It came out perfect.  The second time I made this recipe I followed it exactly.  I found that I ended up with way too much liquid.  So instead of reducing down all that liquid I made a delicious risotto out of the extra liquid.  It was easy.  I sauteed some garlic in a pan, added the risotto rice to the pan and then continued to add the liquid until the risotto was done.  I finished it off with some grated parm.  The liquid that remained in the lamb dish was then reduced down to the perfect amount.  I love this dish because I always have leftover red wine that I don't know what to do with.  This dish is perfect for using up all that red wine that I hate to throw away.

These are delicious. The only change I made was omitting the tomatoes. I wanted to intensify the "meaty" flavor, so I used a very rich beef stock along with the chicken stock. It worked. The sauce was almost like a demi glace.

May I just say that this recipe is truly outstanding. Lamb shanks aren't easy to get hold of in the UK but it's well worth the effort of trying to do so - not least because of this particular recipe. I have done it about five times so far for dinner parties - including once for a Masterclass chef who thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a very good cook but this works so well that people seem to think I CAN cook! I'm writing this review now because I have guests for dinner tonight and I'm doing it again. I can smell it cooking right now and I've just been thinking that I don't actually want to share the contents of the pot with anyone! I want to eat it all by myself because it is soooo good. Thank you to S. Hodge who gave us this recipe - it's much appreciated. People think I can cook because of it!

This is a classic dish for many reasons; simplicity, ease of preperation and excellent results that is sure to please.  A possible variation that I have found to be excellent is the addition of capers, olives and dried figs.  Essentially the same as this recipe with the addtion of apprxoimately 2 tbl spoons of capers, 2 cups of dried figs (halved), and a good handfull of black olives (15-20).  Intead of tomatoes (or in addition to), 1/4 cup tomatoe paste that you cook in a moderate pan until it changes to a deep burgondy red, then add the stock and bring to the boil, then add to the casarol dish with the lamb etc.

Chop the tomatoes before adding. A little tomato paste also gives it a richer flavor.  Make sure to cook down the liquid to a slightly thick consistancy. I tend to agree to serve it the next day if possible...the flavors meld in the sauce.  Reheat it covered in the oven. This is a keeper!!

Recipes such as this are the reason that I love allrecipes! This is a superb dish. The lamb is meltingly tender and flavorful and the sauce is veltety and lush. I seasoned the meat with seasoned salt, pepper and rosemary, and let it sit overnight. I also used about 1/2 of the wine called for but other than that I followed the recipe closely. Thank you for sharing this restaurant quality dish. We love it.

I LOVED this! I just got a new iron Dutch Oven and made Julia Child's Beef Burgandy....so next HAD to be Lamb! I had 2 nice Shanks plus 2 nice thick bone in shoulder steaks. I pretty much went by the recipe but used org beef broth only, fire roasted tomatoes, 2-3 Tbs tom paste, 3 c of Shiraz, LOTS of garlic, carrots, onions...and folded lots of fresh rosemary/thyme into a coffee filter package I made and tied...bouquet garni. I put it into (covered) a 400 oven lowered to 350 and left it about 3 hours. PERFECTION! And by doing it in the oven you get a beautiful reduction. Thick flavorful sauce ....delicious!!! No need to thicken..does it for you! I made small red potatoes steamed and tossed in lemon, butter, garlic and parsley to go with...YUMMMMY!!!! Thanks for an easy and foolproof recipe!

Just had these for dinner.  They were wonderful, quick and easy.  I do not use wine usually and had a bottle that someone gave me for Christmas.  It was great and all the alcohol is cooked out COMPLETELY!  Next time, I will just use two cans of chicken broth and beef broth instead of the wine.  I don't buy the stuff!
Thanks for a great dish!  Reminded me of all the home comfort food of my youth!

There's nothing terribly wrong with the recipe, but on the whole it was a little thin and boring.  I halved the lamb and kept the veggies the same, and it still didn't have enough substance.  For braised meats, I've never felt that side dishes should be a necessity, but they are in this cause since you have a lot of thin sauce and very few veggies--overall, I felt it should've been more stew-like.  My suggestions are to double the carrots, add a turnip or two, a rutabega, and two potatoes.  It'll be a much heartier dish.  I would also replace the chicken broth with beef only, doubling the amount and halving the wine (since the wine is just flavour, it is wasteful to use a whole bottle).  Another addition might be to add a dark beer (a porter, perhaps) instead of the wine.

Wonderful flavor.  I got so much sauce that I'm freezing the 1/2 recipe or so I had extra and plan on making more shanks or stew with boneless lamb.  I only had dried herbs, but they worked fine using 1:3 ratio of dried:fresh herbs.  Definitely a winner!

I have always made Lamb Shanks in a similar manner.  I make them both for special occasions and for everyday meals.  You just have to love browing then braising! Today we had them for Easter Dinner.  I make the following alterations. I use 2 cups of wine (usually Old Vine Red, sometimes spendier varieties, it depends on your own palate) and enough beef/chicken stock to cover the shanks.  My family loves the flavor the dish imparts on the carrots so I put in tons, enough for sides for everyone, sliced about 1/2 inch thick. Oh, I have in the past substituted tomato sauce, when out of chopped tomatoes, and besides the "chunk" factor, the flavor was still superb.  As others have stated, you really have to watch the garlic and onions when carmelizing, be patient, watch the heat, and do not burn them, even a little, it will matter in the end.  The sauce thickens up nicely after you remove the shanks if you turn up the temp and let it go, scraping the pan occasionally, this make take a while, I usually rice and whip my potatos while this bubbles away on the stove.  This takes time, but is absoltely a top notch meal, worth of any restaurant.  Nobody has ever had anything but compliments for this dish.  Have fun, make it your way.  That is what cooking is all about.    I have used both my La Crueset as well as my Lodge Dutch ovens and have found no difference, fyi.

This had wonderful deep flavors! While a little on the rich side,served with garlic mashed potatoes it was a terrific meal! The only change I made was I bundled together my rosemary and thyme instead of chopping. Thanks for a great recipe, I will make again and again.

This dish was fantastic and very easy to make.  I only wanted to cook 2 shanks so after reading others reviews regarding sauce too thin i reduced the amount of wine and the liquid of the broth.   I used 1/3 of a bottle of Isla Negra red wine, and i used a small 28g Knorr concentrated beefstock pot rather than the broth as i was cooking in a slowcooker so more moisture /liquid would be created I also used chopped rather than plum tomatoes.  I did not salt the lamb as i knew the stockpot would season the dish, i left out the carrots as i dont like carrots greatly and felt they would reduce the elegance of the overall dish, as lamb in England is expensive so this was a more special than everyday dish.  I browned the lamb then placed in the slowcooker, i then added all the ingredients to the pan brought to the boil then poured over the lamb.   I cooked them in the slow cooker for 5 and 1/2 hours stirring the sauce once.  Once ready the meat was dropping off the bone it was so tender and the sauce needed no additional work at all it had thickened perfectly,  we like a lot of sauce but i had enough for at least 4 servings but i would not have wanted to cook the meat in any less than i had.   These were the only alterations i made and i served the lamb with peeled garlic mashed potatoes with added creme fraiche and butter and fine green beans.  Would be great with leg of lamb

I reduced all the ingredients by half. Instead of cooking the dish on the stove I put it in a fairly shallow pot and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for two hours covered, followed by 30 minutes with the top off. Cooking it this way reduced the liquid enough so that it didn't have to be reduced further before serving. Much easier than cooking it on the stove where you have to watch it. anyway, Spectacular presentation, brown and gorgeous, served right out of the pot.

Absolutely amazing!! Such a nice simple recipe with wonderfully balanced flavors. I cut the recipe in half and used a can of diced tomatoes and added whole mushrooms. I browned the shanks in olive oil and then put those in my slow cooker and sauteed the onions, garlic and carrots in the lamb fat. Those went into the slow cooker as well and all the other ingredients followed. I also threw in a Tbsp of brown sugar to balance the acidity of the wine. I used a good dry cabernet sauvignon which was perfect. On the advice of another cook I let the shanks sit overnite in the fridge and reheated the next day. I was able to skim off some of the fat and reduced the sauce and thickened with cornstarch. Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. So wonderful..amazing comfort food! The meat just fell off the bone and had such a deep flavor from the wine and rosemary I cleaned my plate! This recipe is awesome because it's simple, easy and absolutely delicious!!! Toss it in the slow cooker on low and 7 hours later it's beautiful. The whole house smelled great too! Enjoy!!

I thought this was excellent, and a wonderful dinner to serve guests.  BTW, virtually all braising recipes like this one (or like Osso Buco for example) require that once the meat is done, the pot should be uncovered and left to cook until the sauce thickens and concentrates its flavor (this can take 30-45 minutes).  Having "too much liquid" as apparently more than a few cooks did, is not a fault of the recipe but is instead the natural and inevitable result of braising recipes.

Cooked as advised by another reviewer in the slow cooker. Browned it first then covered it with the broth and cooked it slow and low for about 7 hours. Meat literally fell off the bone. Great Easter main course!

I am an ardent lover of lamb and have just taken up cooking. I have never cooked lamb shanks before tonight and followed this recipe to the letter and the lamb turned out amazing! The meat just fell away from the bone and the flavors were in perfect balance.  I will definitely make this again!

This was an amazing meal. The sauce was as flavorul and rich as any I'd ever made before. The lamb shanks were fall-off-the-bone delicious and it was all so simple to make! I made minor adjustments. I ground red, green and black peppercorns with sea salt and rubbed it on the shanks before searing. Whatever was left over i tossed in the sauce for simmering. Great recipe!!

As I read the other reviews, I was certain that those who said they had too much sauce left over might have needed to cook the sauce down until it became a ragu of veggies.  In my mind's eye, I knew the final product I wanted and went for that. For my taste, the wine needs to cook down and mellow completely. In my opinion, if the sauce is watery and has a red wine color, it has not been reduced enough by simmering.  I made this recipe exactly as written.  Cooking time was 3.5 hours to get the stew-like consistency of the sauce and vegetables.  I used white rice as the accompaniment.  Excellent.

This recipe was extemely good.  I did make a couple of changes.  I only used half a bottle of wine.  I did it in my slowcooker and then drained the vegetables (my husband can't have seeds).  I then reduced the juices by half on high heat to make a demiglas.  Oh dear it was so good.  I wished tonight I wasn't on Weight Watchers because I really wanted more than one.  Saved the rest for more meals later.  Excellent

To thicken the sauce and add depth, I blended half of the vegetables and garlic, then added that mixture to the pot first. After the blended veggies browned up, I added the rest of the dices vegetables and followed the recipe as written. The sauce was velvety and bold in flavor. The next day, we shredded up the leftover lamb and make a ragout with the sauce over fettuccine. This will be made again many times in my house!  One more tip: top the lamb with a simple gremolatta (minced garlic, parsley, lemon zest) to amp up flavor and finish off the dish like a pro!

nice recipe..just thought that it was alot of wine..hate to use a $15 bottle of Merlot on three lamb shanks(which was 3 lbs actually).so I used probably 1 cup. turned out fine. a lot of 'gravy' left. I will take the advice of one other reviewer and freeze it for later use..such as a lamb stew.

wow - this was delicious!  first time making lamb shanks too.  i did not use beef broth, just chicken.  i also put in a very small can of V8.  i used almost a half bottle of Cotes  du Rhone wine.  (scaled down to 2)  this was a fast, easy and tasty rich dish.  served w/mashed potatoes.  if i ever happen to make shanks again, this would be the recipe!  thanks for the post S. Hodge!

YUM! I made this with organic beef broth, frozen (left-over) red wine I had in the freezer and skipped the chicken broth, thyme and  tomatoes and served the gravy over egg noodles with fresh steamed spinach but it was so delish I wish I had made mashed potatoes to sop up even more gravy. I think with good lamb shanks you can fool around with the ingredients quite a bit and it will still be delicious. Will be making again-- a great winter dish that warms the kitchen.

Absolutely delicious! I added a bit of fresh mint and butter (at the end) to the sauce. I am going to dream about this tonight! I loved the fact that this didn't taste like "lamb."

Gosh   what can I say  I am usually pretty picky so take these 5 stars to heart. I have never cooked lamb shanks before, I was too scared, these are  wonderfull!!!!  Very tender and flavorfull.  I followed the directions exact. The only change I made was to add a can of tomato paste to the sauce mix. Husband LOVED the meal. Said to make this a repeat for sure.  Also make sure to serve with mashed potatoes or rice or polenta for all the gravy. And when it says bring juices to a boil for 15 mnts. to reduce, that does mean a rolling boil.  8 or 9 on your stove, the gravy WILL reduce by half.

I have made this recipe four or five times in the last 6 months and it has become a family favorite.  We have used lamb shanks and this last time I used part of a lamb leg.  The shanks taste best.

So tasty. I'm just learning how to cook, and this was super easy! Although, I think I need to get myself a baster. No matter how many shanks you make, I'd recommend using all the broth. Maybe pour  1/4 cup of stock every so often. I didn't have a lid big enough for this pan, so maybe the moisture was escaping. Regardless, it turned out so delicious. Definitely worth the wait. Though, I wish I would have had more sauce. It absorbed everything like a sponge. Also, I'm not a huge fan of onions, but actually wish I would have added more because the caramelized flavor was to die for. NOM. I'll be recommending this to family and friends for sure :)

Simple, tasty recipe. There's a lot of liquid in this but you'll need it to cover the shanks. I did put in only a 2 and bit cups of wine and it turned out great. I didn't put in a few more carrots and garlic then asked for. Be sure to reduce the sauce at the end, it may take a bit with all the liquid but you'll know hen you're there when the pot thickens.

I loved this recipe!!  My husband reluctantly tried it and loved it, we had it for leftovers the next night as well.  I am not a rosemary fan, I know boo, but I replaced the rosemary and thyme with basil and fresh mint and it was to die for.  I will save this one in my recipe book.  5 stars!!!!

This was a great base recipe to start with.  I made a few changes, as we don't like rosemary and I reduced all ingredients by 1/2 (except garlic & carrots) as I only made 2 shanks (about 1-3/4 lbs.)  We also omited the chicken broth and only used beef broth and used a White Merlot.  I substituted an Italian Seasoning for the Rosemary and Thyme.  I thickened the sauce a bit with corn starch and served the sauce/gravy over mashed potatoes...YUM!!

These had a good flavor which was even better the next day. But the quantity of sauce was enormous, and I'd either halve the sauce or double the lamb. The carrots gave it a sweet, mellow flavor, but were ignored by all the men in our family.

Yummmmmmy!!! It is really delicious! Instead of using canned chicken and beef broth, I made my own and it turned out excellent. The mashed potato and peas are just perfect on the side. This is a truly magnificent recipe. Thanks!

EASY & EXCELLENT!
Even better if put in frig (covered) for two days and reheat before serving.  (Gives all the wonderful flavors time to get acquainted!)  I served it in warmed bowls with crusty foccacia to dip in the sauce. NO LEFTOVERS!

Great recipe. Cook it for a long time (longer than the recipe recommends, like maybe 3 hours, so the meat starts to fall off the bone.) I tripled the amount of rosemary!

Absolutely fantastic! I used a wonderful dry red wine called Chambourcin from the St. James winery in Missouri. I also used 2 14.5 oz cans of Muir Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes.  For the broths, I used 21 oz of Imagine No-Chicken broth (a vegetable broth), and a tablespoon of Penzeys chicken base and a tablespoon of Penzeys beef base. I followed the directions exactly, and it was done perfectly. Thanks so much for sharing. I thought the amount of liquid was just right, otherwise the shanks couldn't submerge, and there wouldn't be enough gravy for the potatoes!

They were simple to prepare and better than we get at our local restaurant, even with my modifications. I didn't have any broth, so I added more water, figuring that the lamb itself would flavor the braising liquid, which it did.  The smell of them cooking was incredible, they were unbelievably fork-tender and deliciously flavored.  A winner!

My family LOVED this.  The best part is that you can serve this whenever you have everything else done and it will still be hot.  The only thing I did differently was to take the lid off at 1.5 hours so the broth would boil down to more of a gravy.  Absolutely fantastic recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I had to substitute beer for the wine as I only had white wine in the house and didn't think it would suit lamb.  I cannot wait to try it again with the wine.  I also only used beef broth as I felt it would give a bit of extra body to the beer base versus using both chicken and beef. I can tell that the recipe as written will also be fabulous.  My husband who is fussing about his lamb loved this too.  I served with fresh baked rolls to sop up the extra liquid.

The taste was fine but I was expecting a bit more from a 3 hour recipe. Just wasn't worth the time in my opinion. The lamb just blended into the background with all the other flavors. If you love the taste of lamb, this recipe probably isn't for you.

MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE LAMB.  ONE DAY I FOUND LAMB SHANKS AT THE MARKET AND BROUGHT THEM HOME.  I STARTED LOOKING FOR RECEIPIES AND FOUND THIS ONE.  IT IS THE BEST!!!  WE LOVED IT AND TALKED ABOUT IT FOR DAYS.  THE SAUCE IS OUTSTANDING!! WONDERFUL FLAVORS.  I SERVED IT ALONG SIDE CHEESY POLENTA. THIS RECIPES ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES.  GUESS WHAT I AM MAKING FOR A FIRESIDE SATURDAY NITE DINNER?  YOU GUESSED IT!  ROSMARY BRAISED LAMB SHANKS.  JUST A NOTE:  MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE STEP TO REMOVE SHANKS FROM LIQUID AND REDUCE SAUCE.  IF I KNEW THE CREATOR OF THIS RECIPE I WOULD, "KISS THE COOK". I.J. SELL VALPARAISO, INDIANA

Made them this weekend (with polenta and roasted asparagus) - and WOW! they were AWESOME, and very easy to make...    Some additional tips:  #1)  Did steps 1 and 2 the day before and chilled overnight - made it very easy to skim off all the fat after it solidifies on top.    #2) Reducing an additional half bottle of wine down to a few tablespoons and adding to the sauce during the last 15 minutes of reducing made a HUGE difference - tip from my chef brother.  Will definitely be making this again next time company is over....

This was the best recipe I have tried in a long time. I wish I had a freezer full of lamb shanks so I can eat this every week! This is the first time I have ever been compelled to review an online recipe. Thanks to the person who posted it!

Great Sunday dinner! Made this for Easter & husband & I really enjoyed it. I halved the recipe & used half a bottle of merlot & a little more than half of each of the broths & still had plenty of sauce (boiled the heck out of it for about 30 min. at the end to reduce per suggestions). Also added a small package of sliced baby bella mushrooms in with the onions, etc. & they made the sauce even more delish. However the polenta I made was too rich for it. It's already a fairly rich dish so next time I'd opt for mashed potatoes or rice instead.

I cooked up this recipe this morning and into the slow cooker it went, I returned home to a mouth-watering aroma! As other reviewers have suggested, I browned the shanks, fried the veggies, added the liquids, let it come to a boil and piled it into my slow cooker. Although I halved the recipe as it is only my boyfriend and I and it was still perfect! The only problem is there is no canned broths (or stocks as we call it)available in Australia so I subsituted powdered stock mix and doubled the stock:water ratio to give it a bit more flavour. Also, I removed the lid for the last 45min so the sauce could thicken up a tad. A taste sensation!

Although I have cooked a lot of lamb, I had never tried lamb shanks before. This recipe was wonderful! The only changes I made was using diced tomatoes with garlic and herbs and didn't use as much wine as stated. There was plenty of broth and it was fantastic with the garlic mashed potatoes. I know I will serve this again. Thank you!

My boyfriend wanted lamb for easter and I had no clue as to how to make it.  Luckily I found this recipe and received rave reviews from him all evening.  I added fresh mushrooms to the recipe and I only used half the liquid that the recipe called for like other reviewers had suggested.  There was still way too much, but I added some cornstarch and it thickened nicely.  Next time, I will add even less liquid, but awesome awesome recipe!!!!

I used lamb ribs instead of lamb shanks and fresh tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes. I served it with roasted garlic mashed potatoes too, it was a really great combination. Thanks for such easy and nice recipe!

I actually used veal for this recipe, plus I used bottled herbs, not fresh and reduced the amount.  My husband thought it was fantastic, but I'm glad I added the small can of tomato paste as recommended in other reviews. It was definitely needed.

I was looking for a lamb recipe and came across yours.  It was absolutely delicious.  I did, however, cut back on some garlic and on some liquid.  I used 5 garlic cloves, 1 1/2 cups wine, 1/2 can of tomatoes and 1 can of beef broth.  
I followed the rest of the recipe as you suggested.  Thank you for a meal I will use over and over again.

THIS IS A FANTASTIC RECIPE.  WE LIKE THINGS A LITTLE SPICY SO INSTEAD OF SALT AND PEPPER I USED A GENEROUS AMOUNT OF "EMERIL'S ORIGINAL ESSENCE".  I ALSO USED A LITTLE MORE OLIVE OIL AND MORE ROSEMARY AND THYME.  THIS IS COMFORT FOOD AT ITS VERY BEST AND ONLY GETS BETTER THE NEXT DAY.  I SERVED IT WITH ROSEMARY MASHED POTATOES.  OUTSTANDING DISH.

Made these today.  I was actually sick, so I propped my laptop open and had my husband do it.  He followed the recipe exactly (halved, we did 3 shanks), and it was very good.  If I had made it, I would have added more rosemary and thyme, and more spices to the sauce.  Next time I will also add mushrooms.  The meat was 'fall off the bone" goodness!

Delicious! I made a smaller batch and substituted sun-dried tomatoes (rehydrated) and used more carrots. Served it with rosemary bread to sop up the juice. Skipped chicken broth and only used beef broth and red wine.

This recipe is by far the easiest and tastiest recipe I have even done.  The only problem is how expensive lamb shanks can be but I live in Los Angeles and everything in LA is expensive. 

I wouldn't change a single thing about this recipe because I can't imagine ever doing anything that may change the wonderful flavor. However, the only suggestion I would make is that whatever red wine you choose it is best to pick a wine that is usually recommended with lamb. Not any red will do! 

In these reviews no one ever talks about the side dishes that would compliment a dish. So my recommendation is that you feature the dish with Italian Peas (as featured in allrecipes.com) and plain basmati rice.  They are simple side dishes that compliment the flavors of the lamb.

This was off the charts delicious!!!!  The flavors were so wonderful and the meat fell right off the bone.  I served it with Israeli couscous to soak up all the yummy sauce.  Absolutely wonderful.  I can't wait to make this again.  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!  (oh, and my first time ever cooking lamb shanks...so glad I saw this recipe first!)

This was absolutely fantastic.  My brother-in-law, who normally does not show much emotion about cooking, absolutely loved this.  So easy to make and after all the initial prep work, you just sit back and relax while the dish simmers.  Extremely flavorful....can only imagine how much better it would be if I let it simmer longer than indicated.  Would also like to try it in the slow cooker.  As my husband said, this is a 5 star restaurant dish!!!!

Very nice recipe. Divided it all by 3 so it would serve 2 and it cooked up very nicely. It's always nice to put something on the stove and "forget" about it for a couple of hours! Easy prep also.

I made this for Easter dinner and it was delicious, but I adore lamb.  The American lamb skeptics were even impressed.  It takes a good half hour of reducing the sauce at medium temperature after the shanks are removed from the pot, but the reduction makes a wonderful sauce.  This is not difficult to make but the presentation is lovely.  I served with potatoes and "Onions baked with rosemary and cream" from this site. Highly recommended.

So, so delicious! I hadn't had lamb in a long time and was craving it and found this recipe. This is very easy to make and using fresh rosemary does make a difference. The sauce is quite savory and if you have too much leftover, just use it the next day as a bruschetta topping or in your pasta! So glad I made this dish...I'll definitely be making it again!

This is so rich and delicious! I served it over polenta and added some chopped greens (chard, kale and beet greens) to the liquid during the last 15 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely divine.  I didn't have any broth on hand, but beef/ chicken bouillon cubes worked totally fine.  Served the lamb shank over 'Cheesy Polenta' (but opted to use Parmesan cheese in place of cheddar), and then spooned the vegetables/ sauce over top.  One of those 'I can't wait for fall' meals that you will never grow tired of.

A very "ok" (read: standard) recipe. Very nice, flavorful, cheap recipe. 

Love slow cooking cheap cuts of meat... you can eat like a king, with minimal impact on your pocketbook. Saved money can be used for important things such as: large screen TVs and beer :)

There are a few key steps with this recipe.  You need to use canned condensed broth, and not add any water.  When you are simmering the shanks in the pot for 20 minutes at the end without the lid, it should be a good paced simmer(you are wanting to start reducing the sauce).  Depending on the size and depth of you pot you might need longer than 15 minutes to reduce the sauce after you remove the shanks.  It has to be a real full boil, and the sauce should reduce to almost half.  Hope this helps

This was fabulous!  I  have wanted to make braised lamb shank for years.  Finally decided to do it yesterday and used this recipe.  Probably one of the best meals I ever made.  Served over a portabello and shallot risotto. To die for

I took the meat off of the bone and served over mashed potatoes to make it easier to eat. Next time I will let the lamb sit over night with rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper. :) A lot of liquid left over, but needed to braise the lamb.

We loved it, great recipe for how little effort is required, you don`t need to supervise the simmering, just make sure the heat isn`t too high. Concerning people`s comments on the amount of liquid, you just have to boil the liquid at the end, and it will reduce, remember no cover at the end and boil on high. You can start off the recipe by reducing the amount of liquid, just make sure you have enough so the meat is submerged. If you are making for less people, then simmer in a smaller pot, and you won`t need as much liquid. I give 4 stars instead of 5 only because it isn`t the best lamb shanks I have had in my life but it is delicious, great served with polenta. will absolutely make again

This was delicious--the perfect comfort food.  I used 3 good sized shanks, about 1.4 lbs. each. Also added some chopped celery and put the pot in the oven for 2 hours at 325.  Afterwards, I discarded the vegetables, removed the shanks and reduced the sauce by about half on the stovetop for about 1 hour.  Served with a creamy baked orzo--sublime dish!

This was very good, but I only gave it four stars as the other reviewers are right, there's way too much sauce.  I cut back by 1/2 on the broth and wine, and used 8 large lamb shanks, and there was still too much.  I added mushrooms and lots more carrots to the sauce mix and simmered it on the stove top until it had reduced, and added a roux to thicken it.  I baked the lamb and sauce mix in a moderate oven for 4 hours, covered with foil, and the lamb was incredibly tender and delicious.  Served it with mashed potatoes.

This is a great way to prepare lamb shanks, the few things I have been doing a bit differently over the years is to use much less wine, and to chop the tinned tomatoes using their juice as well, I then finish mine off in the oven after a good braising, covered tighty for 2 hours, then about 20 minutes before serving I add a can of cannellini beans ie:(white kidney beans) and serve over a bed of pasta in large individual serving bowls. And it is always a winning dish!

Fabulous! I did not add the tomato paste as others has suggested but used beef stock only in place of the chicken stock and it was great! My partner said it was 'outstanding' and wants to have it regularly-  Its definetly going into the rotation!!

Hubby loved it, loved it, loved it!  Made it exactly as written.  It made enough sauce for double the amount of shanks (which I wish I'd made and frozen for future dinners).  Easy make-ahead recipe for company-quality or special occassion dinners.  A winner!

Made this dish for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. The only things I did differently was use 2 cans of beef broth and no chicken, added some tomato paste and made a bundle of fresh rosemary and thyme  instead of chopping it.  Will be making this again the next time I find a good deal on lambshanks. Delicious.

Best recipe I have found for this meat. One thing I do to thicken the sauce quicker is add corn starch to cold water and then add in the last stage to desired thickness.

I found lamb shanks on sale & having never made them before, I decided to look up a recipe & give it a try. This is soooo easy to make & quite impressive. I  doubled all the additional ingredients so that there was more gravy (I used 1 1/2 bottles of red wine instead of 2) I simmered the gravy for over an hour to get it to the right consistancy. Sometimes I serve it over polenta & sometimes I serve it over pasta. Wonderful company dish or half the recipe for just two people.

I made this recipe as written with two small exceptions, because It is hard to find lamb shanks in my area, I used butterfly leg of lamb cut into cubes.  I braised the meat in two batches. Also, I used the other ingredients as listed including the fresh rosemary.  Since I did not have fresh thyme on hand, I used dried.  The first time I made this, my husband raved about it so much that he decided to make it again for guests.  Our guests also enjoyed it. Before trying this recipe, we had never cooked lamb.  Thank you for a very nice and easy recipe.

I followed the directions without thickening the sauce for the last 20 minutes and it was delicious. I used Greek seasoning and 2 beef bouillon (1cup of water per cube,) instead of condensed chicken soup and it was delicious. I used half a bottle of Merlot, the sauce was flavorful and creamy.

I made lamb for the first time using this recipe. It smelt and tasted great. I had never eaten lamb before, so it was different. Not sure I like the texture of lamb, but this was defiantly a great way to make it.

Some gremolata would DO this dish. Capers, Lemon, Parsley. Reduce the sauce by 2/3rds, cook that wine first to find it's sweet flavour. No gray meat - make it caramel.

This is a wonderful recipe. I served it for Easter with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The gravy was delicious. We strained out the veggies, since all their flavor had been cooked out, it was no loss. I also used only about a cup of good wine and used more chicken stock to cover the last bit of shank. I will make this many more times.

I have never cooked Lamb before and this was about as good as anything I have made. The flavours were outstanding and everyone loved it. There is a lot time spent watching over it as it cooks but it is worth it.  When it came to the last step we were going to add a little flour and a couple gravy tricks to help thicken it up as it seemed it was taking forever to cook down but decided not to and followed the recipe. I am glad I just let it cook down, the sauce over the meat was amazing.  I did not have enough Shanks so I substituted some Lamb Chops.  Outstanding! The video was worth watching as well.

Super easy and flavorful. Like other reviewers, I halved the amount of lamb shanks. 1 per person was a bit much, and would be pricey. I added bay leaves, fresh parsley, and potatoes and served this over high quality egg noodles.

I decided to cook a surprise dinner for my mother-in-law's birthday. She had been craving the lamb shanks from Elephant Bar, so lamb shanks it would be!  Unless you want the bone whole for presentation, a tip when buying your meat is to ask the butcher to crack the bone.  That will add more flavor to your sauce.

This was my first experience cooking lamb, but the recipe was super easy!  You MUST be patient & let the sauce reduce...that is key.  If you need to speed it up you can turn up the fire, but you have watch carefully & stir to prevent burning.  You will see the difference as it thickens.  I suggest if not all, use more beef broth than chicken for a richer taste.  If you prefer a gravy, puree the reduction then strain it.  Best served with mashed potatoes & your choice of veggies.  I also suggest something lemony for dessert...I made a lemon-raspberry cheesecake.  My Husband & Ma-in-law loved it!

Seared lamb in frying pan and then transferred lamb, wine and stock to crockpot on high heat.  Boiled rest of ingredients in frying pan and then transferred to crockpot as well.  Subbed beef bouillon cubes for stock and did not add water since other reviewers mentioned there being a lot of sauce.  Added more carrots than called for, probably about 6 large ones (I used baby carrots as that's what I had)

My friends and I loved this recipe. The lamb came out very tender and the sauce went great over garlic mash potatoes. We paired it with parmesan and red pepper flake grilled green and yellow zucchini.

This was my first time having lamb shanks. I did not like the consistancy of the meat at all. I was not expecting it to be like chicken. but as for flavor it was very good. I loved the gravy it made! I ate the mashed potatoes and gravy, and my husband ate the lamb :)

Absolutely loved this recipe, I made 3 lamb shanks so I just cut recipe in half. It's a dish I always order when we are on a cruise. It was fun to make it at home and the meat fell off the bone, highly recommended

Definitely a keeper! My husband said "very delicious" and my 4 year old agreed! Amazing. First time my son ever said he liked a lamb dish. I cooked for 6.5 hours in slow cooker and used less red wine and more beef broth (but same amount of liquid in total).

OMG! Delicioso! This is an exquisite recipe. I am on a diet and have lost 20 pounds so far. In looking for tasty recipes with ingredients my doctor allows me to eat, I ran into this wonderful dish. I cooked it and shared it with my son and nephews and it was an instant hit! And these are kids who usually don't eat lamb. They sure were introduced to it in a winning way. They now love lamb. 
   I would have loved to thicken the juice a bit more, but didn't want to use any starches. Nevertheless, the young guys and I finish up the liquid as it were soup; it is that good.

This recipe turned out amazing. I made a few changes since I didn't have canned tomatoes on hand. I used 3 medium whole tomatoes and a can of campbells tomato soup. I also didn't have beef broth so doubled up on the chicken stock. I used Merlot as my red wine. Other than that I didn't change a thing. I really didn't want to wait the 2 hours of cooking (was so hungry!) but you really have to to get that flavour infused in. The husband devoured it! I served with rice. Will definitely make this again.

My husband really loved this and I really enjoyed making it but I was disappointed in it really... I felt like it wasted an expensive cut of meat... If I wanted pull apart meat I would use something cheap. Lamb Shanks/Chops should be red in my opinion. But the husband really liked it so it may have been me.

I'll have to taste the leftovers tomorrow but everyone seemed to like it. Even my sister, who doesn't eat lamb, really liked it. Served with Cheesy Polenta, Sugar Snap Peas, mashed potatoes, and my own creation of broccoli with lemon, pine nuts, and butter.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  I agree with another's comments about being patient and waiting for the sauce to reduce at the end.  It is worth the wait for it to boil down and thicken without adding any flour or cornstarch.  I will definitely be making this again!

I just used this recipe last week! I must say the lamb came out super delicious! It was my first time trying lamb and my husband's second time! I will admit that it is WAY too MUCH liquid in this recipe, but it does help to cover the meat in the pot. But afterwards I was like hey...what now with all this sauce? 

The lamb came out so tender (I used lamb chops instead of shanks). The lamb fell off the bone and the sauce itself complimented the delicate taste of the lamb very nicely. I reduced the amount of rosemary for it and added a few extra seasonings of my own. I dont like wine AT ALL, and even though I thought it over powered the sauce a bit, it still complimented those lamb pieces. 

All in all TRY THIS RECIPE! It really was delicious. I would use it at least one more time, but am curious as to what other scrumptous recipes I can find for lamb!

Wow.. This was so amazingly delicious. I was confused on whether to French trim the lamb shank but opted not to since it didn't specify and I'm sooo happy I did. The connective tissue really freaked me out but I kept it on and it practically had melted away by the end and I'm positive helped the meat not fall completely off the bone and disintegrate... That tender. I realized at the last second I didn't have garlic and it still turned out brilliant. I only had two shanks but doubled the amount I needed for 2.. My fiancé thought it was the best lamb ever. Thanks!:)

Truly delicious- wouldn't change a thing! Our favorite lamb recipe-especially done with Cape Breton lamb. Equally good in slow cooker or top of stove.

This is amazing!  I've never made lamb shanks before, but this came out perfect, nice and full-bodied.  My husband loved it too and was disappointed there wasn't more lamb.  I followed the recipe pretty close, other than halving it.

I have to say this recipe is AMAZING! I didn't have a lot of time to make my lamb, but they were perfect, just melted off the bone. I replaced the wine and the chicken stock with just the beef stock and it was great. I'm sure it will be even better with the wine - can't wait to try this again!

This was FANTASTIC!!! When you reduce the sauce properly it`s nice & thick. I followed the recipe as written. This is a keeper for my recipe box. Thanks for sharing.

We made this exactly as written and it turned out great!  This was both my husband and I first time trying out lamb shanks, and we both enjoyed it very much.

Delicious.  I only made 2 shanks and halved the sauce, but kept the original amount of veg and herbs.  While reducing the sauce at the end, I threw the shank back in to get warm as my oven was cooking some potatos at the same time and everything turned out very tasty.  By the way, I pureed the sauce a bit to encourage thickening.  Thanks for the recipe and helpful comments!!

This entree took 3 hours to make including prep.  It was the best I've ever had.  Reduced recipe to serve 2. Used entire cans of broth so it could be submerged.  Also added a couple leaves of fresh basil, used fresh peeled, med size tomatos extra rosemary and garlic powder. Simmered with 1/3 can of tomato paste and when reducing liquid at the end, added the rest of the paste.  This is so easy and delicious!

I can't believe this tasted so good!!  My husband said it's like something he would get from a restaurant.  I didn't have any red wine so I used white wine instead.  I would definitely make it again.  So easy too!

Great lamb shanks My first time cooking them and they turned out perfect! I used a jackson triggs merlot and they were purple but tasted wonderful! The juices make a great gravy I just mixed equal amounts of butter and flour then added a small amount of watkins beef gravy mix then added the pan juices from the lamb and it was a beautiful meal:)

Absolutely delicious!  The lamb was flavorful and falling off the bone, and my guests asked for the recipe.  I didn't have the "too much liquid" problem, either, except that my 5-qt Dutch oven was simply not big enough for all of the liquid plus the lamb shanks.  I only used about 2/3s to 3/4s of what was listed.  (My lamb shanks were on the large side.)  I just boiled it down for about 20 minutes and it made a yummy thick sauce -- very rich.  I used a zinfandel, and there was no overwhelming wine taste after the liquid was reduced.  Incredible!

I prefer canned diced tomatoes rather than whole tomatoes.  I also added capers and olives, as someone suggested.  I let it sit in the oven for an extra hour at 325.  The meat literally fell from the bone.  Use a slotted spoon to get all the meat, diced tomato, carrots, celery, olives, etc... and serve with mashed potatoes or risotto.  My guests were so impressed with this meal, everyone loved it. Don't worry about the extra sauce.  That's what the slotted spoon is for.

This was my first time cooking lamb and only my second time eating it. It was delicious. It was incredibly easy as well. I followed another reviewers advice about not being shy about turning the high heat up in the last 20 mins to reduce the sauce. Delicious. I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used some roasted garlic pasta sauce and it was great. Highly recommend it.

Great recipe! It was simple to make and my family loved it. I made a few small changes but basically kept the recipe the same.  I used crushed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes.  In addition I used about a cup and a half of cooking wine instead of a bottle of wine.  I will be making this again!

My hubby has been begging me for Lamb since before we were married (over 6 yrs now).  I have never cared for it.  This recipe was AWESOME!!  He practically licked his plate clean.  He did say that it no longer had the "gamey" taste of lamb (probably why I liked it!!), but he loved it just the same.  I did improvise with what I had on hand (veg. broth, diced can tomato). . but followed the recipe fairly to the letter . . the sauce thickened up just great and served as the perfect gravy for my smashed potatoes!!  THANK YOU!!!!

It's hard to find good lamb recipes and this one was easy to make.  It tasted good but wasn't quite the "wow" I was looking.  Could have been because they were out of lamb shanks and I had to get a different cut of lamb.  Still good though.

This turned out okay. I'd never made lamb before, and the other people at the table said that it was a good way to cook lamb, but I didnt think the flavor was spectacular. I ended up with a ton of somewhat watery sauce.

An excellent way to serve lamb - the recipe enhances, without overpowering, the meat's delicate flavor.  
I had plenty of leftover sauce, so I spooned it over creamy polenta with Parmesan cheese - superb!

I would give it 4 1/2 stars if that were an option.  Don't scrimp on the rosemary if you can help it.  Mushrooms are also a nice addition.

Wonderful, though the end product was more like a stew...the meat fell off of all the shanks. Not that there's anything wrong with that...

Incredible recipe.  My first time cooking lamb shanks and it was very straight-forward (almost fool-proof).  The lamb turned was tender and very flavourful.  My husband thought that it was better than our favourite restaurant.  Will definitely make again....

Truly awesome!  I would recommend making this when friends come over, because it fills the house with its delicious aroma, making everyone extra hungry!  I served with Polenta, and I had extra Polenta and sauce (no meat) because it was that good.  Even my 5 year old daughter liked it!

So tasty! Used dried Italian spice Mx because my rosemary was under a foot of snow. Also simmered for 2.5 hours instead of 2. Pulled the meat off the bone and added to the finished sauce. Delicious!

Add some celery along with the onions and carrots, .  Put all the veggies in a food processor first. (Before cooking)You may need to add a bit if olive oil. Make it into a "paste" like substance.
It thickens the liquid  and makes for a better presentation when serving.
Make sure to serve it with a nice bottle of wine. Pinot Noir is my choice with lamb.

I am in the process of making this. I purchased a pkg of 5 shanks from a wholesaler and they were huge! I have the second largest LeCruset oval Dutch oven and they barely fit. Two are peaking above the liquid line. Maybe ones purchased at a box grocery store are smaller IDK. So my point is you will need a really large pot.

I used about 2.5 lbs. of lamb shanks so I cut down on all of liquids.  For the tomatoes I used 1 14.5oz can of whole cherry tomatoes and they worked out great for texture and taste.  I served this dish over garlicked whipped potatoes. Delicious

We raise lamb, and shank is my favorite lamb dish.  I smoked the shanks for about 3 hours to give a little more depth of flavor.  Easy to make, will do again for sure.

My husband and his brother loved this recipe.  All they could do is talk about how delicious this was.  I followed the recipe except for 2 items I added celery and I just used beef broth instead of chicken chicken stock.  I will be making this again!

There's too much liquid in this recipe by half. In fact, if you add it all up it's just shy of 2 liters worth of liquid. There's no way to reduce that even in 2 hours. Otherwise good.

Made this for dinner last evening.  Followed the recipe but condensed the measurements for 3.  Big hit, hubby loved it.  He has always stated that he didn't enjoy lamb.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.

I gave this recipe a try and was not disappointed!  It was easy to put together and had great flavor.  I used a can of diced tomatoes because I did not have whole ones.  The shanks came out tender, flavorful, and fall-off-the-bone perfect!  My house smelled heavenly while they were cooking.

Great recipe!!!  The only changes I made were to use dried herbs instead of fresh and turkey bone broth instead of chicken broth, because that is what I had.  Hubby LOVED it, as did I.  We served it over Japanese rice, as that is his favorite starch.  Definitely worth doing again, in spite of the cost of lamb shanks.  Thank you for a stand-out, "rib-sticking" recipe!!!

Excellent recipe. Made this in a 5.2 qt dutch oven.  Didn't change a thing. Very powerful flavors, not for the lighthearted or finicky eater. Lamb shanks are gamier than other cuts of lamb.

I followed the directions exactly. It was such an awesome meal.  I made this for 6 people who were blown away. 

The sauce went really well with barley in which soaked up the sauce. 

Yes I would make this again, this is on our menu! I have a photo on my profile.

I did the shanks in the oven at 320 for 2 hours covered and 30 minutes with the cover off. I doubled the reduction time at a bit more than a simmer just to thicken it up a bit. It's a fantastic recipe. I've noticed a few other that thought it fell a bit flat which confuses me. I wonder if they under-seasoned and under-browned the shanks prior to the braise. I'd also wonder what wine they used. Be generous with the seasoning and the sear and use wine you'd happily drink.

We really loved this dish!  I'm glad my husband coaxed me into following the recipe as written.  I was worried that so much wine would make it cloyingly icky-rich, which happened once when I made coq au vin... But no!  The sauce is savory & just right.  Bonus...there's a lot of it, much more than we'll use with the shanks.  I plan to add it to an upcoming lamb stew, because YUM!

Delicious recipe! I followed other suggestions of only half a bottle of red wine, doubled carrots, added parsnips and potatoes. Flavorful and with plenty of sauce to mop up with crusty bread. Yum!

As written, this recipe is just ok. However, it  is a very flavorful if you reduce the sauce and add some tomato paste.  I added celery to the veg mixture too. After the initial 2 hours of cooking, I took the carrots out (as many as I could) along with the shanks. Keep them warm in a low temp oven. I reduced the sauce for about 20-30 mins. Add the lamb and the carrots back in and simmer so the meat absorbs the reduced sauce. Served over very thin pappardelle (Cipriani). Excellent with modifications!

My husband saw something about Lamb Shanks on TV and decided we should try them. We loved them!! The sauce is delicious and even if we don't make the full recipe with the Shanks, we still make the full recipe for the sauce because it's so good!! My husband made them twice and I'm cooking them myself for the first time!!

This was fabulous.   It was definitely a restaurant quality meal.  I prepped mid-afternoon and then let it simmer.  Guests arrived and all I had to do was reduce and make sides.   I served polenta & green beans.    I did add 1 small can of tomato paste to help thicken based on reviews of a lot of liquid.  Taking the time to reduce is important!

I made this for family dinner. I followed the recipe and served mashed potatoes and a salad. I used a Cabernet for the wine. Everyone loved it! There were no leftovers except some sauce which I am going to use as s base for a stew.

I made these and they were a knock out.  I prepared according to the recipe except at the very end, as suggested by another reviewer, I added a corn starch slurry to tighten up the gravy.  I served them with mashed potatoes but polenta would be good or egg noodles or rice.  I will do polenta next time.  Even my wife and older son who were a little off lamb raved about them.

Delicious just as is.  The only change we made was add a pinch of cayenne pepper.  We will definitely make this one again.  Not boring at all!

This was SO good! We felt like we had a gourmet meal at home.  All of the prep is done at the front end so while its braising you can get other things done.  I cut the ingredients back a bit b/c I only used 4 lamb shanks.  I followed as is except I used a little more garlic, added 1/2 can of tomato paste, and in addition to the herbs called for, put in two sprigs of thyme and pulled them out before reducing.  Because I use reduced sodium stock, I added a little salt and pepper  and then reduced at a full boil for just shy of 20 min.  The reduction was absolutely delicious! Thank you for a wonderful & elegant recipe!

This was fantastic. I had fewer shanks and tried to cut down the sauce but I had a lot left over. Froze the sauce but have no idea what I will do with it. After reading another critique I forgot to add that I did thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch as it was too watery.

Our new "go to" lamb recipe.  Followed recipe mostly.  After browning lamb and veggies, I marinated all for a day.  Substituted veggie stock for chicken.  Cooked it 2.5 hours at 350 the next day, then refrigerated another night.  Final day cooked another hour or so until all lamb fell off shanks.  Added a bit more red wine and seasonings to reduction sauce.   The planned overs barely made it to noon the next day!

Great dish. My family loves it. Not to difficult to make. Meat was literally falling off the bone.  Everything was bursting with flavor.  We put it over rice instead of potatoes.

Very good.  I used lamb chops.  Made this for some friends  the other night.  My wife hates lamb.  I just said i was making a "chop" dish.  Her and one of our friends didn't believe it was lamb.

Fabulous. I've made this dish so many times and never been disappointed. I usually reduce the amount of wine called for, and I like to use a good Zinfandel, but I've even used ale. I grind my salt, red pepper flakes, dried rosemary, and some dried oregano and add this to the onions and garlic when I sauté them. I use my own homemade bone broth (usually made from chicken and turkey) for both the chicken and beef broth. Then I add fresh bay leaf and thyme to the Dutch oven before I cover and braise in the oven. I never have to reduce the sauce if I use my Dutch oven and cook in the oven. Our favourite way to eat this is with a creamy garlic risotto but we also love it with mashed potatoes. It is our favourite fancy dish and what my husband always requests on his birthday or around Christmas.

Amazing. The only change I made was to purée the tomatos, as I don't like chunks of tomatos. My 10 year old daughter said it's the best recipe we've ever found!  Perfect!

As this was not my first time making lamb shanks, with this recipe I had to down size a bit as it was dinner for 2 (anniversary) dinner. I did use a Shiraz as I'm not fond of the tannin in most hearty reds I went a little sweeter. The herbs(thyme,rosemary and a basil leaf) the wine and the lamb... the best smell is swirling though my kitchen. I halved all the liquids with 2 large shanks.. can wait for the finish. Simple, quick and spot on blends... Thanks

I was amazed at how fall-off-the-bone and melt-in-your-mouth the braised lamb shanks were using this recipe!  It was the first time I had braised any meat and was apprehensive that the meat wouldn't be tender enough, but it turned out to be a huge success with all my family.  After cooking, I took all of the meat off the bone (actually all I did was lift the bones out of the pot because the meat had naturally fallen off during cooking!), shredded it and mixed it with tagliatelle, using the gravy as the pasta sauce. My 3 children (who are the most discerning diners!) finished all of it in one go and even asked for more!!

Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I halved everything since there are just two of us. Hubby really enjoyed this. I've only had lamb a few times and I'm still trying to figure out if I like it or not. That being said, I thought it was pretty ok. If I come across lamb shanks again I'll probably make this again since he enjoyed it so much.

Delicious. I just cut the recipe in half as I was just cooking for two, and it turned out wonderfully. My husband was weary about making lamb at home as he has only eaten it in restaurants but raved about it! Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my family for Sunday supper and it was amazing!  My husband was skeptical about the tomatoes but was blown away by the flavor.  The meat flaked off the bones and was very juicy and incredibly tasty.  I used a Cabernet Franc for the wine and I served over mashed potatoes.  I finished with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.  Total time was closer to 3 hours (30 mins chipping/browning, 2 hours simmering, 30 mins reducing the sauce).  Will definitely make this again and may try in the crock pot.

Love this - absolute staple. Would recommend adding more lamb, though - there is a lot of juice to go around.

Excellent recipe. Did cut up the tomatoes into quarters & rubbed lamb with rosemary, salt and pepper and let sit for a few hours before cooking. Great with a little crumbled feta on top, restaurant quality meal! Will definitely make again.

An excellent dish. I thank you so much! I modified the recipe a bit.

for three lamb shanks I used 1 can of Campbell's Beef broth 1 can of Campbell's chicken broth straight from the can do not and water. one can of chopped tomatoes and half a bottle of 2014 California Black forest Decadent Red Wine from Cupcake vineyards.

Cook in stove for 2 hours then remove the Lamb and throw in a bunch of sliced mushrooms and reduce the liquid until you have a quarter of the volume left. 

A beautiful rich decadent sauce for those who are on the fence about Lamb this a excellent recipe to start with!

Thank you for sharing the recipe

Made this recipe for the first time this weekend. Absolutely delicious!...loved the layers of flavor. I browned 8 medium shanks a few at a time for better browning. I transferred them to a crockpot. In the oil I sautéed onions & carrots then crushed (not minced or chopped) garlic. I did add approx 1-2tbsps of tomato paste (from the tube) and cooked until fragrant (2 mins?). I added a bottle of red Zinfandel and allowed it to reduce by at least 1/3-1/2 of the amount before adding chicken & beef stock & tomatoes along with fresh herbs and added 1tsp or so of celery salt. Seasoned to taste with additional S&P then poured over lamb shanks pushing them into the liquid (important for braising).  After 1.5 hrs on low I switched shanks around putting bottom ones on top -vice versa. Another 1.5-2hrs on low then removed shanks and liquid. Puréed liquid then returned all to crockpot- simmered a bit longer - but were great at this point. I served them over quick cooking polenta made with 1/2 fat free half& half and 1/2 chicken broth and asiago cheese, S&P and a side of green beans with almonds.
ABSOLUTELY WILL MAKE AGAIN & AGAIN!!! Gourmet flavor!
Additions- tomato paste, celery salt.   
Changes-crushed garlic cloves, reduced wine prior to adding stock & tomatoes/herbs- puréed sauce (taste like delicious tomato/veg soup), poured over shanks & simmered a bit longer      DELISH!!!

I halved the recipe because I only had three shanks.
Did exactly as the directions said and it was delicious. The meat fell off the bone and the sauce was flavorful and yummy.

Well I put all of these ingredients in the pot as directed.  I wasn't precise in my measurements  but  the smell in my house was delicious.  I only put half the wine in the pot and drank the other half.  It all goes to the same place, right!   I used an electric skillet set on 325 F and it took about two hours total.  I served it on mashed potatoes with fried asparagus.

I used dried herbs because it is what I had. I strained the gravy to remove any pieces & served over polenta. I am not a  lamb fan but this was good and my whole family enjoyed it too.

Delicious recipe.  the longer you simmer the meat the better, i did it for 3 hours instead of 2.  I cut this recipe in half and still have tons of liquid left over.

Great...No way to miss!...I put slivers a garlic in incisions in  the shanks. Used Lawrey's garlic salt and pepper, and 50/50 Red and white wine...depends on what U have!
The reduction took some time, but was worth it!

Brown the shanks &  place in slow cooker .Added 2 large Russet potatoes, peeled & cut into chunks also added additional carrots. Cook veg & sauce until boiling & pour on top of shanks. Cook on LOW @7 hours (or HIGH@4 hours.) Remove shanks & thicken sauce with a water/cornstarch mixture. Only use 1/2 bottle of red wine, OR you might try instead adding a dark beer.

I used white onion which I think may have made the sauce a little sweet, which made it taste off .  I cooked it for 7 hours on low in a crock pot and it tasted like pot roast to me. Meh....wouldn't cook it this way again.

This was my first time cooking lamb and it came out perfectly, fall off the bone tender! I don't cook often but this recipe was very easy to follow. My boyfriend actually said it tasted exactly the same as the braised lamb shanks at our favorite restaurant and couldn't stop raving about it. Thank you for this delicious recipe! A definite repeat for sure.

Excellent recipe! First time cooking lamb, and it was delicious. I followed other reviewer's tips and used roughly half the amount of wine (1/4 bottle for a half batch), and put everything into the oven after browning. 350° covered for 2 hours, then uncovered for 30 minutes resulted in perfect gravy consistency, without having to boil or reduce. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious. Made it for new year's day and it got rave reviews in my household. We may make this a yearly tradition, although I'm not sure I can wait that long to eat this again. It was that good.

This is seriously a solid recipe.I think the only thing is most people like thicker sauces, so listen to the reviews that mention reducing the sauce after taking the shanks out, and if you're not a fan of onion/tomato, you can halve it and it will still be amazing. 
The wine, use it all. Cook it at least for 2 hours like in the recipe. Or, use a slow cooker like one of the other reviewers (I am trying this next, literally just made it tonight and wow), and get it done. It is so good. 
I had my new neighbors over for dinner, I'm 29 years old but I'm new to the "Homeowner Neighbor Hosting" game. They couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was. It was so great and it looks fancy, and you feel fancy cooking it, and frankly it's delicious.

I recommend, again: 
halving the amount of tomatoes and chopping them, potentially halving the onion because it's hard on the stomach to have tons of onions for some people, and sprinkling some corn starch on the brothy sauce after taking the shanks out and then whisking/reducing it into delicious gravy to pour over the meat/ potential mashed potaters.

This recipe was delicious and I made it exactly as written.  I served it with mashed potatoes and everyone (kids included) gobbled it up!  I will be making it again this weekend.  This is a wonderful recipe to serve to guests as the flavours are so good - and its very easy to make.

I'm sure it's good, but Ill do it with just 1 glass of wine. Where I hail from there no wine worth ingesting, cooked or not, under $15.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  The meat fell off of the bone. I also made 1/2 the recipe and used dried thyme and rosemary, it was delicious.  I also used a nice red table wine. Very flavorful.

I was looking for a recipe to duplicate a dish at a local restaurant, Gustauv's.  This is it!  These are rich and delicious with just the right balance of acidity from the tomatoes and wine.  They are perfect for holidays and dinner parties because I put them in the pot and let them cook while I do other things.

Amazing!! Made it for Easter, it was a huge hit! Meat fell right off the bone. I braised the lamb the day before as suggested and just reheated in the oven the next day. Perfect.

I actually used lamb chops and they were ready in less than 1 hour. The sauce turned out to be a hit. I really loved the whole dish.

This was delicious.  It wasn't difficult, and I served it with baked garlic mashed potatoes.  A great way to make lamb shanks.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I used lamb shanks the first time and lamb shoulder steaks the next time. Both were equally tasty.  I also used a pressure cooker which shortened he cooking time by an hour and a half. My Italian hubby LOVES this recipe. Make sure you do the reduction at the end.  FANTASTICO!!

I am making this tonight for the second time.  The first time was for a dinner party. Everyone loved it!  One person told me that it was the best lamb shank she had ever eaten.  Tonight I have scaled the recipe down for just my husband and me and will serve it with garlic mashed potatoes.  I can hardly wait for dinner! (The only change I made was to use dried thyme since our little town does not sell fresh herbs at our one grocery store and I did not have any in my herb garden.)

This recipe is INSANE!! I too used the slow cooker. I did half the recipe - cooked on low for 8 hours. It was so fabulous I was dreaming about it all night. :) Definitely going in the dinner rotation. It's a good one for company, too - so easy but tastes so fancy!

Just made this tonight.  Absolutely divine!  Cut wine in half, left out chicken stock, and used only beef stock.  Didn't have tomatoes but used 3/4 can of tomato paste.  I did strain a lot of fat out of the gravy before serving, and added a bit of cornstarch/water mixture to thicken for mashed potatoes. It was rich, delicious, and restaurant quality!

First time I've made lamb shanks. This will be my new recipe to impress! Wonderful! I don't drink so I used half cooking wine and half cranberry-grape juice and it was AMAZING. It added a little bit of tart sweetness that really gave it depth. I also made roast garlic mashed red potatoes and baked beets with carmelized onions and feta. I'm feeling pretty darn proud of meself! Thanks for the recipe!

One word "AMAZING".  So easy i did the prep on the stove and then put in a crock pot overnight and slow cooked for 7 hrs the next day.  So easy.  Added a 1/2 can of tomatoe paste to thicken the sauce a bit otherwise straight off the recipe and again it was AMAZING.  I will fix again.  Served with garlic mashed potatoes YUM.

Two Thumbs up! I've added celery, bay leaf, cayenne for a little heat, thyme and parsley a teaspoon each... used butter to thicken the sauce towards the end...

Marvelous.  I never had the nerve to tackle shanks before.  I always just waited to eat them in Disney's Cinderella's castle.  It was easy to follow and it is even better than Disney's.  just call it pride in the accomplishment .  Thanks!

A keeper for sure. The only modification I made was swapping out the chicken for some duck stock I had on hand. A little duck makes everything taste better.

This is one of my favorite recipes - so easy and impressive when we have company!  When the shanks are ready, I take some of the liquid out and use it to cook israeli couscous.  To serve, I start with the bed of couscous, put a shank on top, then use a slotted spoon to put a spoonful of carrots/onions/tomatoes on top of each.   Amazing!

My lamb turned out to be a bit bitter on the outside. I think it's because I have burned the garlic ever so slightly. I have used a $10 Merlot, which could also be a contributing reason. However the inside meat was simply tender, juicy and flavorful, albeit a tad too gamy, which I love however. I deboned the shank and returned the bone to the pot for boiling down the gravy. I think if I strain the gravy a bit, it should taste less bitter.

This was the best lamb I ever had. You do come out with alot of extra sauce.  I used 3/4 bottle of wine instead of the whole thing.  I cooked it in the crock pot on high for 4 1/2 hrs. So delicious!

Cooked 7 shanks using this recipe, but found too much liquid, even after hours of cooking. Cut down on wine amount would improve problem. Flavor very strong but tasty.Not small kids tucker.

I made this dish last night and it was a hit! My husband loved it and said "it's a keeper"! Since we got together 3yrs. ago, I have been cooking him the best recipes I can find and this is one that I will try to cook for him often. I followed the recipe exactly and the trick here, like mentioned by others, is to boil the sauce on high for about 5-10 mins. It gives you a great sauce that you'll want to keep for dipping bread in it, it's that good.

This was absolutely amazing but I used a 3.5 lb leg of lamb and skimmed off as much fat as I could.  Braised the leg, then browned the veggies, and boiled the liquids (burgundy wine) before slow cooking it for 9 hours.  I baked cornbread and put a square on the bottom of a bowl and topped with the slow-cook mixture and topped with baby peas.  My boyfriend thought this was To.Die.For!!!  Thanks so much for such a wonderfully tasting meal.  Already a "keeper" recipe!

Very good.  I did, however, add 1 beef boulain cube at the end when I was reducing the sauce.  I wanted a deeper flavor.  There was a lot of liquid left-over and took about 45 minutes of boiling on high to get it down to the consistency I wanted.  Overall, a great recipe thanks!!

Pretty good, too much liquid left over though and next time I will not use the whole bottle of wine, in this case it was too much of a good thing and left my meat with a bit too much tang.

a hit all around. all the work goes in the prep time.  i made it with roasted garlic and parmesan mashed potates which helped soak up the delicious sauce.  i would have liked to have gotten the sauce thicker, but it was delicious nonetheless.  highly recc!

My boyfriend and I made this recipe for my family, who can be quite fussy, and they all loved it. We changed the broth for stock cubes. I don't know what "broth" means in the US, but in England it is a thick, lumpy soup and we didn't think that would compliment the shanks.

This was absolutely scrumptious.  Lamb shanks are my husband's favourite meal and he has been looking for a good recipe for ages.  We wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.  We served it with broccoli and baked potatoes and it was a big hit.

Great recipe. I used dried herbs instead of fresh (including a bay leaf) and also added some celery. After browning the lamb & vegetables I transferred it to the oven for 3 hours rather than cooking it on the stove top. The lamb was very tender and fell right off the bone.

Awesome!  I lo-o-ove lamb and this is a winner.  The only problem for me is that I have a real hard time finding lamb shanks.  But when I can find them, rest assured this will be the recipe I use.  Thank you so much!

I used beef shanks instead (couldn't find lamb shanks).  Added one can of tomato paste like other reviewers had suggested -- turned out a little too tomatoey for me.  Next time I'll just add 1/2 a can of tomato paste.  But overall a pretty good meal.  The meat was so tender, and it fell off the bone!  Thanks.

It was probably me, but I didn't find this recipe very appetizing.  It had a funny smell and took forever to cook.  I ended up giving it to my parents who absolutely loved it!  My husband and I, however, won't try this one again. Sorry.

I need quick meals and this is really great especially when you are entertaining guests.. you get all the preparation out of the way and then you can enjoy the company.

Definite family favourite.
