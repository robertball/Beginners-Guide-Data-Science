While I do not follow the Paleo diet, I have free range hens and thought why not? 1/4 cup of coconut mile ruined this for me. Sorry. It was edible but a couple of teaspoons of water or nothing at all would have been much better and even healthier. Again I am not on the Paleo bandwagon but the coconut milk didn't taste good in eggs at all.

Great recipe!  Made some changes by reducing one egg.  Instead of coconut milk, I used red wine.   Knee buckling good!
