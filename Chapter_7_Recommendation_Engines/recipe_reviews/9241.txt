My first goose was terrific!  Couldn't find currants, so dates were used. The stuffing is yummy, as was the gravy.  Very easy recipe and impressive on the table.  The goose took about an hour less time than expected.

Fantastic! This was only the second time I have made goose, and I was thrilled with the outcome! It was moist, and flavorfu1. I didn't choose to stuff the goose with the stuffing but stuffed the goose with apples instead (had a family member who couldn't have anything with gluten) I just baked the stuffing. It was all wonderful, goose, stuffing and gravy. I will make this again!

I've been cooking a goose at Christmas for years and this is an excellent recipe.  Be sure to only prick the skin, not the flesh of the goose.  I recommend stuffing the cavities with cut up apples and lemons or oranges and discarding the fruit when the goose is done - it absorbs some of the "off" flavors of the bird.  Cook the yummy current stuffing separately in a casserole dish. Before Christmas I save at least 2 empty jars with lids to collect all the fat that will come off the goose.

Great meal for special occasions.  I don't know what I did wrong though, but there was way too much stuffing.  It ended up being soggy and dry all at the same time.  The bird was excellent but I won't make the stuffing part again.
