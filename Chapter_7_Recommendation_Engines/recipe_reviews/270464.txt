I am allergic to cheese so used a cheese substitute and also have vegetarians in the house so used Morning Star Chorizo Crumbles. It was so delicious that  everyone wanted 2nds and 3rds and it is now a part of our rotation.

I thought it was great. Not a big hit with my husband, though. I think a lot depends on which sloppy joe mix you use. Next time, I'll try a different brand.

My fiance made this for us the other night and it was exactly the kind of soul food we needed for a quick meal after a long week.  This recipe is brilliant in its simplicity.  We will be making it again.  Thank you KelseyS!

The wife and I just loved this recipe.  It was zesty and had a much nicer flavor to it compared to an old standard that we had grown up with.  We look forward to sharing it with our college-aged sons who are looking for simple, make-at-home meals.

Turned out good. Fast and easy to make. Needs a little kick so I added hot sauce.
