I liked it, but I did change the recipe a bit based on someone else saying she was a little put off by the fennel seeds. I basically reduced the amount of fennel seeds to 1 teaspoon and increased the amount of saffron to 3 pinches. For the fish, I used wild caught sole. I also cooked the fish for a bit before taking it off the heat and covering it, and the fish still came out very flaky.
