Absolutely wonderful. Great flavor. Super Tender. I used Country Ribs instead of Baby Back, but still was great.

I used baby back ribs and cooked for about 7 hours in the slow cooker.  They were easy to make and I thought the sauce had a nice flavor.  I did have a lot of sauce left in the crock pot.  Next time I may stick them on the grill or in the oven on broil for a few minutes to bake the sauce.

I wish I would have read the reviews about the excessive salt before making this...  With modification (maybe 1/4 of recipe salt) this recipe can be worthy of 5 stars.  As it was, the salt gave me a headache after eating.   The baking method was easy.  I only pulled ribs out 2 times to brush on BBQ sauce--there was plenty to keep it moist.  I did this in 15 minute intervals at 350 convection bake.  I had 3 racks of ribs and they were moist and very tender.   I will definitely make again with the salt change -- the idea of grilling after the first 2 hours would be great.
