I very very rarely give 5 stars but this low fat delightful potato recipe is wonderful.  My husband had these in the oven when I came home from work and the light smell of curry made my mouth water.  Didn't change this recipe a bit and they were perfect.  Try this - you won't be sorry.

Very good, crispy with a subtle curry taste.  I served them along side Crispy Pork Cutlets and a green salad.  Perfect as written.

This is probably one of the best potatoes I have ever had! Yes, I am a huge curry fan and this nailed it. I used rather big potatoes and ended up eyeballing the ingredients to make them sufficient for the amount of wedges I have. That is perhaps why this recipe is great - use the seasonings according to your tastes and when it comes to curry powder, there is no such thing as too much for me and my husband. Thank you for such and enjoyable side dish. We rarely eat regular potatoes and this made it so much more satisfying!

Bake them until they are crisp, and add what you like for spiciness, and they are great!

The flavor of these was very good, and the spicing wasn't too hot where all family members couldn't eat them.  The only problem I had was the inability to get them truly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  I finally sprayed them with a large amount of cooking oil and then they crisped up.  I think putting more oil in the coating mix and then spraying them before (or during) baking would help resolve that issue.  All in all, a very good recipe!

Really delicious! Cooked about 50 minutes which is about usual for us with oven fries. The flavor was fabulous! Thank you for sharing this!

Delicious! Nice change to the regular fries. Halved the recipe, still delicious. Left in longer than 20 minutes. Very nice, easy recipe. Will definitely make it again.

I've made this a few times, each time adding a different spice. The original recipe is great, but I encourage everyone to experiment with their fave spices. Such an easy and quick recipe.

Left mine in for 50 minutes. They were tender, not burnt. I doubt 20 minutes would have been enough. 

This was definitely the "new" item I've been looking for. I used this recipe instead of making home fries/fried potatoes with steak and eggs. Much easier and no frying - though there is oil. Added something unique to an old favorite. 

The curry and potato mix is different, and delicious! I cut them into thicker medallions, leaving the skins on, making them fast to prepare. 

They were a bit salty for MY taste. I like lightly salted to no salted food. Salt + Parmesan cheese = way too salty. I will reduce the salt next time. 

They were not as crispy as I hoping for, so I will probably try crisping them at 450 for 15-20 minutes, then bring it back down to 400 and keep checking after 15 minutes of that.

I thought these were very good.  They did take a bit longer than 20 minutes.  Every time I checked them, I added 5 more minutes so they would get a bit crispier on the outside.  In the end, I think I doubled the time.  I followed the recipe exactly and will make these again.

THIS is how I'm going to roast potatoes from now on!! Super easy, super tasty, not greasy at all!! Wonderful blend of flavors-- I'm hooked!! I stuck to the recipe exactly, just nuked the potatoes a few minutes to cut roasting time and cut them in rounds rather than strips-- YUM!!

These were really delicious and easy, I am not a curry fan so instead I used ranch dressing mix with parmesan cheese and garlic poweder they turned out excellent and I got raves about them.
