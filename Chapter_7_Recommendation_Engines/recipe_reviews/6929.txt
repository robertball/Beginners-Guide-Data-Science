I made the challah without baking it in the flower pots.  My family did not like it as much as they have liked other challah recipes.

This did not turn out right. I did it exactly as I was supposed to...it just didn't work out.

Just buy a romertopf, they are made for this.  I suppose you COULD use a terra cotta flower pot, but why?

Still, good stuff.
