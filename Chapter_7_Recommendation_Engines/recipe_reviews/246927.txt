So I hit “done” too soon!  My biggest changes were to speed up the process to get under my 45 minute mark.  First - I pull the tofu out of the fridge, open and drain. I squeeze out the water real quick then wrap in a tea towel and really pat it down. Then turn it out into a large mixing bowl. Then - I mash it using a wire potato masher, just enough that it resembles cooked ground beef. Lastly I press my tea towel down on it, stir the tofu and do it again? And again and again. Whole process takes 5 minutes. Another speedy tip is to use dried herbs (a rounded 1/4 tsp a piece).  I then used my #50 portion scoop (1 1/2 Tbsp) to quickly make 30 meatballs (I rolled them in my palms before setting them on foil-lined baking tray). Lastly I saved time by zapping each meatball with canola oil cooking spray. My last comment was that since I used whole-wheat Panko, I added an extra egg. I have been trying to find a decent meat-free meatball recipe for years and this was finally it!  After I popped them in the oven for 25 minutes I made spaghetti, heated some sauce and steamed some broccoli. Dinner in 45 ;). Can’t wait to make meatball sandwiches with the leftovers

These are so tasty! Next time I make them, I'll do a double batch. I freeze them after baking, then just pull them out as I want them.

This is an awesome tofu recipe.  For those afraid of tofu, I recommend recipes where the tofu is mixed with flavorful ingredients.  I've tried cooking tofu sliced and diced.  I don't like it.  Tofu has no flavor and will take on the favor of the ingredients.  That's why this recipe is perfect for tofu.  The only thing I would do different, for me personally, is cut the red pepper flakes and hot sauce in half.  If you like spicy food, don't change a thing, you will love it as is.  I cooked mine and added tomato sauce before refrigerating.  This made them too mushy.  I would cook them as directed and use tomato sauce as a dip.

Worstershire Sauce contains anchovies. You might as well use beef and pork.
