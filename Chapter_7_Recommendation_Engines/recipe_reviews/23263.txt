Very yummy!  Tender, just-what-I-was-looking-for cookie.  You could probably use vanilla instead of almond flavoring, or half of each.  It does lend a definite almond flavor to the cookie!

GREAT tasting cookie; I didn't need to alter the recipe at all and it turned out wonderful.  I used these with regular vanilla frosting bought from the store and they turned out wonderful!  Will definitely make it again!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I found this recipe extremely difficult to work with.  The dough was like trying to roll out a stick of butter -- even though I refrigerated it for several hours.  I had to add tons of flour just to roll it, and then it didn't hold the cookie-cutter shapes well.  However, having said all of this, the finished product was pretty good.  Frosting/icing is a must because the cookie itself is bland.

THE best Christmas cookie ever! The almond extract gives it a perfect hint of flavor. It's wonderful. We'll be making these with our children every year for Christmas.
