I feel compelled to review this because it represents the beauty of allrecipes! I needed a cinnamon cookie recipe, found this one, read the rave reviews and gave it a shot. This is a very delicious cookie. I followed the instructions exactly (and I did also chill the dough as others did for at least 30 minutes) and they turned out perfectly. I used a tablespoon to measure out each cookie and the recipe made exactly one less of 4 dozen cookies! The cinnamon/sugar mixture was just right - not too cinnamon-y and enough to cover all the cookies. I see some have experienced dough too difficult to form into cookies - the key is to not have the butter TOO soft when mixing and definitely chilling before forming. The idea others have had to cut the cinnamon and instead add M&Ms is interesting. The difference is this butter cookie recipe has more brown sugar than white sugar which results in a more molasses-tasting cookie and I think chewier too, just FYI. Overall, I would highly recommend this! I'm not a huge fan of cinnamon and I love it.

Great recipe!  These cookies are fantastic.  I was looking for a recipe to make cookies like the Mrs. Fields' Sugar-Butter cookies with M&Ms in them.  I omitted the cinnamon from this recipe and left the rest as is...when the dough was mixed I folded in about a cup and  a half of M&Ms.  I chilled the dough in the fridge for 30 minutes then rolled it into balls...I wanted my cookies monster sized (for gifts) so this batch made about 18 monster sized cookies.  They turned out excellent!!  Crispy around the edge, soft and chewy in the middle, and with a great butter/brown sugar flavor.
One caution: don't overbake these!  They will be VERY soft in the center when you take them out of the oven, but don't be fooled!  If the edges are crispy and the cookies are a light golden brown color, then they are done....take them off the cookie sheet to cool and the centers will set up to be chewy and wonderful.  I am going to try making these again with the cinnamon because I think that would be delicious too!

This cookie was delicious. The first time I made these cookies, I didn't read the directions very carefully and added in the cinnamon sugar into the batter and had to make an extra amount of it. I thought they might turn out too cinnamonny, but they were perfect. These cookies were so soft and moist. I made a batch for my class at school and they were gone in an instant. Great recipe!

I tinkered with the recipe a llittle but the results sure panned out for it.  I wanted a cinnamon cookie with bold cinnamon flavor so I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter as well as a 10 oz. bag (1-2/3 cup) of cinnamon chips. I don't like flat cookies so I made sure to chill the dough well. Finally, I was  not comfortable baking these at such a low oven temperature so I baked them at the more conventional temperature of 375 degrees for 8-9 minutes.  They spread out to just the right thickness, neither too flat nor too thin.  What did surprise me is how petite they turned out to be, only about 2 inches around. They're buttery, cinnamon-y, soft, yet chewy.  Mom and Hubs were eating these before they even cooled and immediately proclaimed them a winner.

Absolutely fabulous! I follow the recipe exactly, except for the vanilla. I always add twice the amount of vanilla. So delicious! Over beating really does ruin this cookie so make sure so be careful when mixing! Over all, one of my favorites!

Wow.  I was wary with all the reports of flat cookies, but these turned out fluffy and rounded, much like muffin tops as described by a previous reviewer.  I did alter the recipe by using 2 cups whole wheat flour and the remaining balance using white flour.  Chilled the dough for an hour before easily forming them into perfect balls.  I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough.  Used a food processor to cream the sugar, and for the final addition of dry ingredients to wet, processed until just barely mixed.  Yummy, yummy.  Cake-like consistency with a crispy outside.  Cinnamon lovers rejoice.  Can't stop eating them.  HELP!  Evil recipe!

Best cinnamon cookies I have ever made!

My boyfriend was teasing me about the fact that my cookies didnt taste as good as store-bought kinds, they lacked that "je ne sais quoi" and never turned out crispy or chewy enough. Well this recipe showed him! 

The cookies turned out wonderfully crispy on the outside and moist + chewy on the inside, irresistable! I had to half the recipe the next time so we wouldnt eat too many of them!

The second time around I made a depression in the centre of the cookie after rolling in cinnamon mixture and put in a teaspoon of raspberry jam , delicious.

These cookies were fantastic. So moist and chewy...even after 2 days. I added raisins but other than that I didnt change a thing! Think I am going to make some tonight for my girlfriends!***made these cookies again for a second time. This time, i used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour, 1/4 t. of baking powder to make them rise more, added a few shakes of nutmeg to the dry mix before adding it to the wet ingredients, and baked them in a 375 degree oven for 11 minutes. I also added the raisins again. They came out even better the 2nd time!!!!

These cookies were unbelievably quick and easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except I used margarine instead of butter and they tasted great, but didn't spread as much as I wanted them too. I gave them 5 stars anyway though because my friends all loved them and they were so convenient. I will definitely be making these again, thanks!

These cookies are delicious! Similar to a snickerdoodle, but better being brown sugar is in the dough also, not just white sugar. I followed the recipe as written, but refrigerated the dough 30 minutes prior to rolling in balls. The dough is a bit sticky, do not add more flour just refrigerate it awhile. It's much easier to roll all the balls, then roll in the sugar cinnamon mixture, and set aside. I baked these for 18 minutes and they were perfectly crisp on the outside with a chewy, buttery center. I love cinnamon and cannot believe it took me this long to stumble across this recipe. I  also made little sandwiches by filling some with vanilla frosting, which is wonderful. They are super delicious as is though. I have to remember to add these to my "favorite" list of cookies for the holidays, they are fabulous! Thanks for sharing this easy, yet wonderful recipe :)

I'm quite sure I fallowed the recipe to a T. But they came out flat and greasy! Next time I would use more flour and chill the doug before baking. Maybe that would help? Had high hopes for these, turned out to be a bummer.

Delicious.  Soft and cinnamony- and not too sweet! The dough was pretty soft so a trick I used was to wet my hand when rolling- as my first batch baked I did put the dough in the freezer but still had to use water- it really helps to shape them! I love these and the best part is I had everything on hand- simple! ----Update: I always give my neighbor baking samples and he said these were the best by far and requested at least a dozen the next time I make them!

These cookies are delicious.  I followed the ingredients on the recipe exactly and they were perfect!  I use one of those little mini scoopers for perfect 1" round balls, so chilling the dough was not necessary at all.  Finally, I cooked them for 16 minutes, which was perfect.  Any longer and they would have been too hard instead of soft and chewy like I like them!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

you definitely have to chill these before you start to roll them in the cinnamon sugar. When i brought these to work for my co-workers nobody really wanted to try them. when i forced them to, they couldn't believe how incredibly soft they were and couldn't stop eating them. they taste exactly like the mall sugar cookies but better!

I made these cookies for Christmas, and everyone loved them! I made a double recipe and ended up with 6 dozen cookies for 9 people...ended up with less than a dozen left over, and they won't be around much longer. The dough was very sticky when I made it, but I chilled it overnight and it was a lot easier to work with. Also, it is very important to not over mix the dough so they don't come out too tough. If you do it right they are soft and a bit cake-like, but I love them that way. I'll definitely be making this recipe in the future.

I just baked these cookies and I must agree with previous reviewers you MUST follow this recipe to the T! They turned outreally well and I did find that chilling the dough in between batches made it a little easier to use. I made these cookie for christmas but also for my boyfriend who had some similar at his christmas party. He ate my whole first batch so needless to say they were a success!!! I will definitely make these in the future. Thanks to everyone's helpful hints! They are much appreciated for us amateur bakers

I was looking for an easy sugar cookie recipe that didn't involve chilling the dough -- my three-year old daughter need a distraction right NOW! I didn't have cinnamon for the topping, so we decided to use coloured sugar to roll the cookie balls in. I followed the recipe exactly (was worried my butter wasn't softened enough but it was perfect), just adding a 1/2 teaspoon more of vanilla. The cookies turned out perfectly, slightly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. A HUGE hit with my kids! I have saved this recipe to make over and over again.

Oh my goodness these are absolutely delicious. Crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Perfect flavor. The only thing I would change is to add more of the cinnamon-sugar mixture to the top of the cookies. But that's just me.... I love that taste. Great recipe!!

These cookies were absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe and they turned out sooooo good! I did chill the dough (put in freezer for about 15 min); I don't know how I would have rolled them into balls without chilling. Definitely going to make these ones again!!!

Fantastic. I should say that the dough sticked to my hand during rolling and instead of realxing the dough I addede 1/4 caup of flour more.
I baked it 20 minutes and don't forget that overbaking causes dryness.Very delicious and facile.

I am unfamiliar with Mrs. Fields' version of this cookie, so, cannot attest to the similarity.  Personally, I thought this recipe made a good snickerdoodle, and that the cookies were much better the second day after baking.  Due to the sticky consistency, the batter needed refrigerated prior to forming the dough into balls.  Also, I found the 18 minute cook time was far too long, as I prefer a chewier cookie; I decreased the time to approximately 15 minutes.

These are very addicting!! I recommend chilling the dough as it is too soft to form into balls right after mixing. I thought the recipe should have mentioned that. I just spooned them onto a cookie sheet and chilled the rest. My hubby said they were just "okay" but I loved them and otherwise would have given it 5 stars.

if i could give these cookies a ten star rating, i would! i've made this recipe at least ten times. My friends constantly request (more like begging actually) them. They are the perfect taste and consistency. i usually have to double the recipe because even though the yield amount says 18, i get about 30... and its NEVER ENOUGH!! i can bring a box of 50 cookies to school and in 15 minutes all i have left are crumbs. anyone looking for a good cookie recipe can look no further. i originally sought out the recipe for a good diddy rese substitute and boy did i find it! these cookies are amazing

This recipe needed at least 1/4 cup more flour, because my first pan came out incredibly thin and runny. But after I added more flour they came out really nicely. I also took another user's advice and didn't roll the entire cookie in the cinnamon sugar mixture, instead I dipped the top of the cookie in it. I will definitely make these again!

I asked local school kids what kind of fresh cookies they would buy after school and cinnamon sugar cookies was in the top three.  After reading the reviews I used the recipe ingredients as written, chilling the dough for @10 minutes in the freezer, then lightly spraying my hands with cooking spray to roll them out.  Also, I adjusted the temperature to 375 and baked for 12 minutes in a convection oven so they wouldn't flatten out too much. Well, I put 3 dozen cookies out at 3:00 pm and by 3:04 - nothing left!  Kids know what they like!!!!

This is such an awesome cookie! It is slightly crisp on the outside with a soft and cakey center. MMMM!! I added extra amounts of cinnamon to the batter to enhance the cinnamon flavor, and I substituted the vanilla extract for almond. These were so good!

I made these for a Christmas cookie swap and think they were the favorite!  I love butter cookies and cinnamon is a great holiday twist on them.  Here are some tips with my few tweaks:
1. I only baked for 15 minutes instead of 18-20.
2. Make sure to leave room between the cookies because they WILL spread and make one big cookie blob (which is still delicious, but not aesthetically pleasing).
3. The dough is very sticky!  Either put butter or shortening all over your hands, or refrigerate the dough for a little while to limit the stickiness.  If the dough is really runny, then flour must not have gotten mixed all the way through.

Enjoy!

I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out perfectly.  I ended up with 24 good sized cookies.  I rubbed a little coconut oil on my hands before rolling the dough into balls to keep the dough from sticking to my hands, worked great.  Very yummy cookies!!

Meant to mimic a MF cookie, well yeah, since it's copied from her cookbook! But anyway, I don't care where the recipe came from, it's fantastic!! For something different, I made these cookies with lemon extract IPO vanilla, and mixed the sugar with lemon zest and a bit of coriander. FABULOUS! You do need to chill the dough before rolling though, that's an important step left out of the instructions. The cooking time is spot on, follow it exact.

Very nice recipe!    Since the quantity of mixture was so great, I baked the cookies in many batches which allowed me to play around with them a bit. When making 1 inch balls of mixture to put on the baking tray, the cookies turned out quite crunchy. When I made larger balls and squished them a bit flat, the cookies were a lot softer and chewier which was preferable to me.    Also, as soon as I took them out of the oven, I sprinkled and pressed some more of the cinnamon and sugar mixture onto the top of the cookie to further enhance the taste and replicate the Mrs Field's cookies.    Overall a nice and versatile recipe!

Everyone loved these.  I made them exactly as written with the exception of using light brown sugar instead of dark brown, simply because I didn't have any.  They stayed soft inside with slightly crispy edges and a nice cinnamon/sugar flavor.

Tastes great coming out of the oven-but doesnt last very long. DO NOT SHIP THESE COOKIES! Great for home cookies.

I have a recipe very similar to this one that I like better. These are really good though. I raised the temp to 325 and used way more sugar & cinnamon mixture to roll them in, the amount called for was nowhere close to enough. I dipped these in a pumpkin cream cheese dip and it made them FABULOUS!!! :)

I made this recipe almost exactly. The only thing I left out was the vanilla simply because I didn't have any. I love these cookies and I will definitely make them again. I've never had the Mrs. Fields cookie but now I really want to see what one tastes better. Like I said before, I will definitely make these again!

Great recipe, and very flexible!  The cookies were soft the first day, but crisp the second.  I was able to roll them in cinnamon-sugar, sugar, or just leave them plain.  Just make sure to be careful about the bottoms - the cinnamon-sugar mixture can burn if you bake them too long.

These cookies turned out really good. For some reason, 2 1/2 cups of flour was not enough for my cookies. I ended up having to add about 1/2 cup more flour inorder for the dough not to be overly sticky. They baked wonderfully and came out quite flat but very soft (yum!). The flavor was not nearly as good as Mrs. Sigg's Snickerdoodles  ..... but they are still very good! :o)

These cookies are wonderful! They are soft and delicious! I followed the recipe as it was written, but I had to chill the dough a little before I could roll it into balls and coat with the cinnamon/sugar. Thanks!

these are very good cookies. i added 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon to the cookies and it turned out very tasty. they did harden up on me a bit though, but they are delicious right out of the oven. next time, i will cook it a few minutes less (maybe 18-19 minutes) at a lower temperature. yummy cookies

These are awesome! They taste best fresh from the oven while they're warm. I used a cookie cutter and cut the dough into star shapes and then dipped it in the cinnamon sugar mix.

Very tasty cookies, but the recipe is wayyy too much dough for just 18 cookies. :P Ended up filling up two cookie sheets with 20 cookies each, and had a little dough left over still! Be prepared if you're making the recipe to these measurements.

I DO recommend doing the 300-degree oven; temp your oven—mine runs too hot. I used these to make sandwich cookies and they were perfect for that. First batch I accidentally did 350 & they got too crispy. Dough balls weighing .7 oz each baked 18 minutes at 300, rotated the baking sheet midway through. Silicone mats topped with parchment (because my old sheet pans are too dark). Rested on the sheet pan maybe 5 minutes, then slid the entire parchment sheet of cookies onto a cooling rack. Yielded an excellent chewy texture. 
The filling was cream cheese, salted butter, dulce de leche, powdered sugar & fine kosher salt.

I only got to eat one :( because these were destined for my son's office potluck. But it was really good! Crispy, yet moist and chewy at the same time, and with a great cinnamon flavour. Here are the minor changes I made:
I did not use an electric mixer, but just beat the ingredients by hand. Because of that, my version wasn't particularly airy or fluffy, but I didn't mind. Also, I did not have dark brown sugar, so used golden brown sugar instead. 
Like some other reviewers, I raised the temp to 375, and found they were done in about 12 minutes. The spread out and were fairly flat, but that is how I wanted them. We'll definitely make these again--easy and delicious!

These were a hit! The change I make to EVERY cookie recipe may offend those who are purists, but, here goes... I melt my butter. ?? I microwave it for 40 seconds and then 20 seconds (so it  doesn't explode) I don’t cream anything with beaters. I have done cookies both ways and there is absolutely no difference in taste or appearance. It makes a huge difference in time and clean up however. Give it a shot with any cookie recipe. Aside from all that, these cookies were awesome!

Great cookies! I cut the sugar almost in half, didn't use white, only brown. I live in Switzerland and I almost always cut the amount of sugar when I find good recipes on this site. Nothing to do with a diet or health, it is just a taste issue, my family doesn't like when things are too sweet. Besides the sugar amount, I followed the recipe and the cookies are really great!

I was looking for a strong cinnamon flavour, so I added 1.5 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as rolling the cookies in cinnamon-sugar. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I chilled the dough for half an hour and baked the cookies at 190°C for 13 minutes. They came out beautifully, not at all greasy as some people have found. My family loved them, I'm definitely making these again!

Everytime I make it for a party it's always the 1st thing to go! This is my 1st review... I hardly ever leave... but it's sooooo good, I had to leave one.  I only bake it for 10 minutes to get  that googey chewy goodness like Mrs. Fields cookies. I make these in huge batches and freeze them to save for later. yummmmmmmy

the dough was too sticky, even after chilling for 30 minutes. I added about 1/4 cup of flour and then it was a decent consistency. However they were more of a cake texture than a cookie one. I could have messed up the recipe, but I believe I followed it exactly!

What an easy cookie! And just the right amount of sweet. I cut it in half easily but kept the original amount of vanilla and cinnamon/ sugar coating. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I made the recipe as written and they baked up nice and fluffy. I may not have mixed the batter well enough because a few oozed out some dough resulting in extra crispy parts around the edge. Those didn't look as pretty, but are my favorite because of the crunchy/chewy combination. 

I always make a full batch of cookies, but only bake one tray at a time. The rest get frozen on a cookie sheet until frozen, then tossed in a ziplock bag for a future quick treat! There was no difference in the cookies baked out of the fridge or freezer, so if you lack self control, give that a try :)

Followed the recipe exactly. Needed to refrigerate the dough for about 15 minutes before rolling it into the cinnamon sugar mixture, otherwise the dough is too wet. Cookies came out perfectly! Will use this recipe again!

Just tried it, made very little alterations except for adding ww flour combing the sugar and cinnamon to the batter and baking at 375. The batter alone came out very good. The cookies came out amazing. A lot of people added m&ms I just put in some chocolate chips. very good recipe will definitely go back to.

Like the previous poster I needed a cinnamon cookie recipe and read the rave reviews. No disappointment here, GREAT RECIPE! Followed the ingredients to the letter. Chilled my dough overnight. And added an extra step; while forming the balls I made a thumbprint and dropped a pinch of cinnamon sugar in, then I gently formed the ball. This created an extra ribbon of cinnamon through the cookie. The result was amazing! One batch was not enough!!!

I really enjoyed baking this cookie... Now I didn't have any brown sugar and I really didn't want to go to the store I also didn't have butter but I use shortening with 2 tablespoons of water which equals to one cup of butter... OMG the cookies came out so good very round and just perfect to me! I really enjoyed them! Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great recipe!!!  I've made it for years.  Funny enough, I went looking for a new recipe for cinnamon sugar cookies, and found this one ... then realized that the only difference between this and my recipe is that I use 1/2 tsp baking soda. If you haven't made them before, you MUST try!!!  Delish.

I made this recipe exactly as it's written, and these cookies are delicious!!  They are similar to gingerbread cookies almost.  When they came out of the oven I was able to use cookie cutters and cut them into different shapes before they cooled off.  I experimented with some of the leftover cookies a few days later, and spread some Nutella on the top of them.  Fabulous!!

A great recipe! After reading some of the other reviews, I halved the recipe and it made three dozen cookies.  Mine turned out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside,just perfect and delicious. Will definitely make these again.

Absolutely delicious!!  Followed the recipe exactly, but I did freeze the dough for about 45 minutes before baking.  I dont think I would have been able to roll them into balls had I not done that.  Baked them for 19 minutes and they came out perfectly round and not too chewy or crispy.  My family loved them- thank you for the recipe!

Very good, I just dropped the first batch, and refrigerated for the remainder. Will definitely make again. I made no changes to this recipe and won't, it's great just the way it is.

I'm not a fan of cinnamon or sugar cookies, but these turned out well. I made this recipe for a guy in my friend's unit, whose favorite cookie happens to be cinnamon sugar, and these were a hit! Apparently he ate the entire batch in one sitting every time I sent them along. I'd say that is a solid recommendation for this recipe.

OMG these are the most amazing cookies! 3rd time making them and everyone who has tried them has LOVED them. Today I decided to experiment with half the cookie dough and added chocolate chips (no cinnamon at all in this half). Absolutely delicious!

SO delicious!  I made them exactly as the recipe is written and baked them on parchment paper.  These were not crunchy like other cinnamon sugar or snickerdoodle cookies but soft in the middle. ::runs to make another batch::

SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! I actually liked them best without the cinnamon, but they were great both ways. The dough freezes really well too. I made a batch around Halloween and ended up with a ton of extra dough - Not a problem. I simply froze it and had pre-mixed cookie dough for Thanksgiving and Christmas. So much better than the tube-stuff!

I would have given these 3 stars because I didn't think there was anything special about them.  After my first batch, I added cardamom and ginger, and I liked them better.  The reason I'm boosting my review up a star is because of other people's opinions.  I brought them to a gathering, and people were eating them one after another, like they were potato chips.  So, even though they were just average to me, other people found them delicious.

I give it 5 stars for the cookie.  I give less stars to the directions because I have never used a mixer before for cookie dough, but it was a disaster.  It got totally stuck in the beaters.  Did not work at all.  I ended up mixing by hand as I usually do with cookies.  The dough tastes so good, I could have eaten all of it.  The cookies are really good too.  I baked mine at 300 for 18 minutes.  Mine were bigger than 1 inch cause we like bigger cookies.
Update- that was before I had stand mixer. Which works MUCH better than have mixer. Ha!

Really yummy recipe, however it reminded me EXACTLY of a snickerdoodle recipe I have and was just a bit disappointed simply because I was hoping to try something new.  I also tried peanut M&M's on a few of the cookies to change it up a little and the prior reviews said that it was a yummy touch.  Overall, a good recipe that I say is at least worth trying. :-)

Delish!! I made two batches over the weekend because they went so fast! I refrigerated the dough for 30 min. because I like my cookies fluffy and still soft in the middle. They turned out beautifully and have a light cinnamony flavor. Perfect with a cup of coffee!

Maybe I'm wrong to compare these to snickerdoodles, but they are not as good as snickerdoodles in my opinion.  I guess the flavors are similar, but I prefer the texture of snickerdoodles.  That said, this is a tasty cookie.

Very disappointing cookies. I followed the recipe exactly and we hardly taste the cinnamon. After all the rave reviews, I was expecting something super (especially as a cookie lover and a cinnamon lover) and this cookie did not live up to expectations. It tastes just like any plain cookie.

These cookies were so good and very buttery tasting.  I would suggest only using real butter with this recipe, as margarine doesn't really add any taste.  I usually don't like 'plain' cookies, but these are now one of my favorite cookies to make for the holidays.

Fabulous cookies! They taste like snicker doodles only better! I cooked them in my convection oven on 275 for 18 minutes and they turned out perfect! Chewy on the inside and crispy on the out side. I just made them two days ago and they are all gone. I may make more today!

We LOVED these.  They stayed very soft.  These are time consuming, but well worth it.  I didn't have to bake mine as long as the resipe states.  I cut off about 1-2 mins and left on the cookie sheet to continue baking.  These are a keeper!!!

I have never felt compelled to review a recipe on here I've used - till now. These cookies are AMAZING. I followed the directions perfectly and they turned out nothing short of perfect. I brought them to work and they've disappeared faster than anything I've ever baked!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly for the first batch and my only complaint was that they were a little crisp around the edges, so the next batch I only cooked for 16 minutes and they were perfect.  I was also a little reserved at rolling the cookie around in the sugary mixture, but it all sinks in while the cookies bake so there isn't really any sugar on the surface.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My family can't wait until I make these!  I have 3 boys ages 11, 15 & 32 (ok, maybe not a "boy" anymore technically, but when it comes to cookies...he's still got some little boy in him. lol). They start eating the cookies from the time I get the dough ready to bake, and then finish up with several cookies fresh out of the oven.  They say they can't make up their minds if the dough is best or the finished cookie is best!  And these are SO easy!  LOVE 'em!

I feel the need to rate these AWESOME COOKIES and let everyone know how great they are! I really wanted to try something new this year for the holidays so I made these cookies  These have turned out to be the best cookies I've made. I think I might have found a new family favorate! I can't wait to get back in the kitchen and make more. They are easy, simple and fun to make.

These were so good! I had to send them with my husband to his office so I wouldn't eat them all! The only problem I encountered was that my dough wasn't firm enough to form balls so I spooned the dough onto the cookie sheet and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture on top. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

These cookies turned out perfect!  My entire family loved them!  My daughter gave some to her friends at school and they said I must be a really good cook. (funny if you know me because I am no where close to that!)  Thanks for the awesome recipe.  Will make again!

I followed the recipe exactly. They were quite nice cookies, and would be good with a cup of tea. I'm not giving them 5 stars because they were just nice, not spectacularly delicious.  But I still will make them again. They were crisper than I hoped-- next time I might bake them a little less than 18 minutes.  Do note that although Allrecipes says the recipe makes 18 servings, one serving is 2 cookies, because it makes 3 dozen cookies (as indicated in small type by the photo.)   I had leftover cinnamon-sugar-- if you use 2 tbsp sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon (decrease it by 1/3) you will have enough.

This family of chocoholics LOVED these cookies and we didn't miss the chocolate at all!  The only thing I have to add is that I refrigerated the dough before making the balls, and then refrigerated the balls again in cookie sheet before putting them in the oven.  The result was delicious "muffin top" cookies.

This recipe is great.  The only change I made was adding 1/4teaspoon baking powder to the flour mixture.  I have already made it 3 times. Wonderful!!! Crisp on the outside soft on the inside!

I had high hopes for these, but mine came out flat and greasy.  This happened with my last butter cookie recipe.  The only thing I can think of is to chill the dough next time and the cookie sheets.  I did this with a plain butter cookie recipe some time ago, and these came out thick (and smaller in diameter), though more hard. But they reminded more of shortbread.  The dough for these cookies was very droopy when rolling them into balls.  They puffed in the oven, but then soon deflated.

These are really really good. I added some cinnamon to the batter. And put the dough into the freezer for a while and that made it easier to put into a ball. I also added sugar in the raw to the sugar/cinnamon mixture to roll in, and my cookies are glittering! I love the flavor, it's light and not too sweet. I think I may have baked them a minute or two too long though. I timed it at 11 minutes and then added minute by minute and just kept an eye on them. I think overall I baked them around 14 minutes. I don't usually bake, and to be quite honest baking kinda of scares me--I'm not a measuring type of girl--but I didn't mess these up! yay me!

The recipe was very easy and the cookies came out nicely.  Mine didn't take quite as long to bake up as the recipe calls for.  They are the best on the first day - crunchy on the outside, cakey on the inside - just like all the other reviews reported.

These cookies turned out pretty well. They were soft and flavorful. Some extra cinnamon should be added to the dough for extra flavor. Slightly reduce the amount of sugar in the recipe for a lighter taste (optional).

Just right. I did add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ginger, and  1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dry mix, and it gave it a nice kick of spice.

A-ma-zing. These cookies came out with the perfect consistency. I love cinnamon so I added a few dashes to the batter itself. The consistency - really - that was the grand slam for me. Even if I didn't want cinnamon cookies, these would probably make great sugar cookies.

These were such great cookies! A bit hard to form into balls, but I didn't refrigerate them. I would suggest making less of the cinnamon-sugar mixture, as there was plenty left over. Using the 18 cookie recipe, we ended up with one less than three dozen. I highly recommend these cookies!

These were really wonderful!  Equally as good rolled in cinnamon, as they are without the cinnamon, with added chocolate and Peanut butter chips instead

Tasty, but nothing exciting. They have a nice cinnamon sugar flavor but are very flat. I would probably make these again, but they wouldn't be my first choice.

I made these cookies and my family couldnt eat them fast enough. They are a new family tradition recipe. But the dough is kinda hard to make in a ball so Instead I used a cookie spoon and I added a teaspoon of baking power. They came out great!

I messed these cookies up so bad and they still came out delicious!!!!!! Instead of mixing the butter and sugar together until it was like the recipe said it should be I tried to make it fluffy then I added the dry ingredients then the eggs and vanilla. I omitted the cinnamon and added M&Ms as one person did. I baked half and the rest I left as cookie dough which I brought to my friends house and it didn't last 20 minutes!!! The cookies were also delicious! THANKS!

I loved this recipe!  I added cinnamon to the dough and while rolling them into balls I washed my hands every two cookies to keep my hands from sticking.  It made 19 large cookies after a large amount of snacking on the dough.

Cooooookaaay!!! =)  Yuuuuuumaaay!!!  Made half exactly according to the recipe and the other half w/ M&M's but w/o the cinnamon.  Both are *very* good.  Dough wasn't firm enough to roll in mixture, so I just sprinkled it heavily on top with a spoon.

I guess I'm the only one who didn't care for these cookies too much.  Taste was great but that was about it.  They are flat and I prefer puffier cookies.

So yummy. I let them cool on wax paper, that helped keep them moist. I will next time take them out of the oven just a minute or two sooner. I also had to let the dough chill in the fridge a little while in order to roll them into balls

this recipe came out great!  The cookies were soft and perfect, even better than snickerdoodles.
They were especially good warm, but were also wonderful and still soft the next day.

These cookies were just marvelous.  The only problem that I had was getting them into balls.  I ended up dropping them from a spoon into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and rolling them around to coat them.  No harm, no foul.  These will be entered into the cookie rotation at our house!

Awesome cookie! I added 1 Tsp. of cinnamon to the batter cause I like spice cookies. They smell wonderful while baking, and come out perfect.

I'll be making these this holiday season again for sure!

I was disappointed mine came out flat and not crisp on the outside like a cookie but if you ever watched that Seinfeld episode, it's like eating the top of the muffin.  Still delicious and everyone enjoyed it.

What a special find this recipe is! Light and crunchy on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside. Totally yummy! In fact, my family loves these so much, they've coined a new name for them - snufflepuffs! They're sure to be a family favorite.

This is an excellent cookie recipe, it's easy to follow and makes a delicious cookie. It really tastes like a Mrs. Fields cookie. It's wonderful!
