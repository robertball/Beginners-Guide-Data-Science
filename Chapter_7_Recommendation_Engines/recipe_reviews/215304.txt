While this recipe sounds delicious at face value, it turned out awful.  I made this, exactly as instructed, and in the end, the garlic and ginger turned very bitter, and soured the carrots.  If I had to redo this, I would suggest slow cooking the carrots in the orange just concentrate with the honey, but not adding anything else, including the soy, till the end.  Season to taste at the point of the carrots being cooked, but not before.  This is the first time I have criticized a recipe on this site, so please don't think I am being overly critical, and do indeed appreciate recipes from all here.  But this one, seriously needs adjustment.

Well I read the other reviews and I have to disagree. I added all the ingredients as directed, they only needed 3 hours in my crock pot though. I am a garlic lover so maybe that is why I loved this one. I will make again, very easy!

Okay, so I tried these.... cooked them with just the orange juice con. and honey for 5 hours on low then added the rest of the ingredients and cooked for 1 more hour. And my family really liked them! So thanks for the tips.

Idid not care for this recipe. I can suggest like the previous review that the carrots be cooked alone with the orange and honey for an hour, or so  ... NOT 8 hrs!! and then the other ingredients added at the end.

It's even better roasted @ 400. 
The carrots caramelize, You don't even need the honey.

We brought this as a side to a dinner party, and thankfully the hostess had other options. I would not try this again.
