I wanted SO badly to love this recipe, but it was just ok. The beet sauce was a gorgeous color, especially when compared to the bright green broccoli. It just was lacking flavor. I loved the idea of this, and we ate it all, but I won't make it again. It took a lot of time for an ok result. But health wise it's a sure winner. Its always fun trying new things, though!
