Only change I made was omitting the sriracha since I didn't have any.  I left 2 ribeyes in the marinade for a day and a half due to a change in dinner plans, and the long soak really infused the flavor in them.  Grilled them on our Texas smoker and served with sauteed onion/mushrooms and spinach salad.  No need for any steak sauce!  Hubby and I both ate those ribeyes up and wished we had two more, will be using this marinade again.

This was a nice marinade.  It hasn't become my go-to steak marinade (which earns 5 stars), but we liked it and I'd make it again if I couldn't make our go to (Northwest Steakhouse Steak Marinade from this site).  I marinated (in a glass baking dish in the frig) our Ney York Strips for close to 10 hours.  The only sub I made was Tobasco for Siracha as it's what we had on hand.  THANKS for the recipe!

It was good but half way thru the steak I started getting burned out on the power of the worchestsire sauce. if I make it again I will definitely go lighter on the Worcestershire sauce.

I marinated my  NY strip steaks using this recipe for 3 hours. My husband placed on the grill and these steaks were so tender and delicious!
