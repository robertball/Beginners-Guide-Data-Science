This was my first time making or eating a quince so I wasn't sure what to expect. I also didn't have some of these ingredients, so I used this recipe as a template.   Here's what I did: I cut and cored the quince as directed. Then I lined a 13x9 pan with foil and poured in just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan, splashed in some Gewurztraminer, sprinkled in some cinnamon and sugar, and placed the two halves of the quince face down and baked as directed. There wasn't any fluid left to pour over the quince.  It was super tasty -- a lot like a baked apple with a very unusual, delicious flavor. What I didn't realize at first but soon discovered was that the skin is completely edible.  I would definitely have this again!

I have never eaten quince - in fact, never saw one until last week at the grocery store.  Purchased one to try, and this simple recipe was my vehicle.  I made with sherry, not port.  Quince really do have a floral taste!  My husband turned the timer off a couple times, so I'm not sure whether the recipe or user error caused these to take longer than anticipated to bake.  My sauce was cooked off (but would have been delicious, when I tasted the caramelized residue).
