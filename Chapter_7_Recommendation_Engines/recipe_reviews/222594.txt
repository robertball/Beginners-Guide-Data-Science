Soooo good.  I used two parts ketchup to one part BBQ sauce and used Dijon mustard and added a sweet pepper.  My hungry teenage son applauds.  This is a definite keeper.

These made two very nice Sloppy Joe sandwiches. I made it exactly as written, except that I thought the range levels and cooking times were too much in my case. At medium-high heat, the ground beef and onion mixture started to burn, so I turned the heat down. And for the final simmering step, I thought the mixture was pretty thick to start with, so 30 minutes on low seemed unnecessary, but I did it anyway. I used two fairly large whole-wheat hamburger buns, and the amount of Sloppy Joe mixture seemed just right. There are a lot of variations on this recipe, but I did enjoy this one a lot, and it's worth making again.

We buy our ground beef in 1 1/2# pkgs, so tripled this recipe. Two sloppy joes would NOT have been enough to feed any normal family. It was very good. Served on bakery buns since we hate the prepacked buns you buy off of the shelf. Will make again.

We use ground turkey in a 20 oz package and double the other ingredients.  Also, we add garlic to the ground beef and onion while browning (because we love onion and garlic in EVERYTHING).  I hate the canned sloppy joes and the whole family loves these.  Bonus that they're easy to throw together.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fabulous.  Then, for fun, I added 3/4 tsp liquid smoke and it was even more amazing.  I'm not a fan of vinegar, but I added it anyway just because it was in the recipe, and the cook is right...don't be afraid of the vinegar.

This recipe, with the exchange of 2 parts ketchup and 1 part BBQ sauce, and adding sweet pepper works great for our family.  I make enough for 12 servings and we are lucky to have any left over!  Best recipe ever for Sloppy Joes like mama used to make. AllRecipes is the best site ever for easy to make recipes with ingredients you usually have around the kitchen. I also subscribe to the magazine.

Husband loved it, but it was too sweet as I prepared it. I do not recommend replacing some of the ketchup with chili sauce, as I did because I ran out of ketchup. It took the sweetness/tangy level too high. I also didn't have an actual onion so I tried to make up for it with minced onion and onion powder. Next time, I'll be sure to use a real onion and have enough ketchup, or possibly halve the ketchup with tomato sauce.

Thought I had Manwich sauce but I didn't so I quickly looked up a recipe and found this one.  It was awesome!!  Loved it.  Will make again.  Didn't have an onion so I skipped that but that's the only change I made.

I was just trying to figure out what to do with the 2lbs. of ground beef in the fridge, and I decided to look for a recipe on here. I quadrupled this recipe, as I have a family of 8, and this was very very tasty.  My kids also came back for 2nds. This is definitely a keeper in my book of recipes. In fact, this taste better than Manwich sloppy joe sauce.

This gets five stars, definitely. My husband was saying "mm....smells good" before he even got to the dining room, and then when he ate it, he asked where I'd gotten the sauce. He was impressed when I told him I made it myself. I made it to the letter of the directions, except I probably only had about 1/3# of ground beef to start. I filled our sandwiches quite fully, yet I still had enough beef mixture for another sandwich. If I'd put any more meat on our sandwiches, it would have turned into a really sloppy mess. I know the name of the dish is "sloppy" joes, but it would have been ridiculous.

This recipe tasted like cow  mixed with baby vomit sprinkled with foot mould from a middle aged man who still lives in his parents basement. I honestly would rather die than consume this disgusting piece of . I am absolutely disgraced that this horrific "meal" could even be conceived. I hope the person who made this has a great day... IN HELL!!

I browned the ground beef with the chopped onion. Ground beef was 97% lean, so I started putting in the ketchup (unsalted,no fructose), and rest of ingredients before beef was fully cooked; thus melding the flavor while beef still browning. Omitted the water; used low sodium soy sauce, since I had no Worcester sauce, omitted the salt, added a few drops of hot sauce, stirred over a med high heat for a few seconds, then covered over low heat. Served it in onion buns. Great taste and texture.

I added a bit of cubed ham, ½ cup red wine and omitted the yogurt. It was great and very easy. I also added the celery and carrots to the pot to sautés a bit before adding the lentils and liquids. The surprise was there was a bit of sweetness from the caramelization of the onions and carrots.

Delicious

Very good recipe I was impressed, although I did some slight changes because I do not like too sweet of sloppy joes.  Also notice the proportions given in their recipe is for only .5 Lb of ground beef.
First change was a 50/50 ratio of ketchup and plain tomato sauce, second was adding a pinch more of chili powder, black pepper, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce to make-up for the lack of ketchup. 
Another review stated not to be afraid of the vinegar it offsets the sweetness, very true!

I made this exactly per the recipe except I doubled all of the ingredients.  It was very good, but a bit too sweet.  In the future I will use half of the brown sugar and twice the vinegar.  My husband really liked it, but also thought it was too sweet.  The seasoning was perfect. (I also left out the salt because I have to be careful and didn’t miss it at all. I’m sure the ketchup has more than enough!)

Loved it! The whole household enjoyed it! I’m cooking it again tonight. Second time cooking this recipe and my mom’s boyfriend asked if I was making the same one, so they REALLY enjoy this recipe. :)  We did end up doubling the recipe both times, so there would be enough for everyone and so there would be enough for leftovers. We’re having tatter tots with it as well (as a side).

Whenever I try a new recipe, I follow it to the letter. In this case I did, against my  better judgment. If I had to do it over  again, I would have substituted a good BBQ sauce for the ketchup, added half a chopped green bell pepper, and eliminated the chili powder altogether. As it was, it was okay, but the chili powder kept nagging until I was glad to be done with the meal. Bleh.

This is, by far, the BEST sloppy joes recipe I have ever tried. I didn't happen to have any chili powder or onions (but I did have onion powder) and it still turned out really tasty. Even my son loved it and that really says something. This one is a keeper.

Very good! Will definitely make this again! I used apple cider vinegar and two cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, and I used chicken instead of beef. I added a chopped tomato with the liquid, and mashed the cooked meat with a potato masher to get it nice and tiny. Simmered all the juice into the meat. Yum yum!

I love it. I think it needs more sauce. I made it exactly as the recipe called for. It has a very good flavor. The brown sugar is just enough to give a kick and the onion are delicious with this recipe. I'll make again , but think I'll try to make it more saucy .

I am not a sloppy joe fan but I enjoyed this recipe because it is a little sweeter.  Only gave it a four star because the onion seemed a little too much and needed to add pepper.  Will mske again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added a little liquid smoke and hot mustard which went well with the brown sugar. Probably will add  some chili sauce next time. I think it needed a little extra sauce

Just exactly the recipe I was looking for.  This is a perfect swap for Manwich and so easy to make.  Followed directions except I doubled it and added some chopped green & red pepper to the mix.  I made this again using slow cooker, browned the meat and onions and put everything in the slow cooker on LOW for about 6 hours.  Perfection once again!

I substituted tomato sauce for the ketchup & water and cut the brown sugar in half as I prefer things less sweet.  Followed the rest of the recipe precisely.  Loved it!

Placed biscuits in Pam Sprayed muffin on after flattening them, brining them up on the sides.
Added prepared meat and topped with cheese.
Baked  in toaster oven for time suggested on the biscuits.

Yummy!

Made with turkey instead of beef. Didn't have garlic powder so skipped that. Otherwise made just as is but with one pound of meat instead of 1/2 (who has 1/2 pound of meat?). Was a little low on sauce so I added a few extra shakes of catsup. Thickened up fine and was tasty, so no need to double everything if using more meat unless you like things very saucy...

Got rave reviews and was great that I had everything I needed sitting around!

This recipe is amazing just as it is. So glad I found this recipe! I wanted sloppy joes without all the horrible stuff found in Manwich and other sloppy joe mixes. This is an excellent more healthy alternative.

I absolutely love this recipe, but I use soy sauce instead of the worcestershire sauce, and I didn't use the onion powder. I refuse to ever by manwich again! If you like cheese on your sloppy joes, I recommend using macaroni and cheese instead.

I loved this recipe. It tastes so much better the Manwich. I made this for 4 people. Instead of using the whole cup of ketchup I used 1/2 Ketchup and 1/2 Tomato soup. I also added 1/2 cup of diced stewed tomatoes. I also used Apple Cider Vinegar in place of the White Vinegar as it's healthier for you. Turned out DELICIOUS!! Recommend trying it this way too. I think next time I will try using 1/4 cup of ketchup and 3/4 cup Tomato soup just to test. But thank you for this recipe it was GREAT!

Very tasty, I like to add celery and green bell peppers plus replace the chili powder with a few pinches of cayenne. Sometimes I omit the vinegar or Worcester sauce because I don't have them on hand, still tastes great.

I have made this recipe a couple times for family, and they rave about it...nay, they request that I make this for all get-togethers!  I also add celery, half of the chili powder with spicy chili powder, and a little bit more ketchup than what it calls for.

This one is definitely in our go-to dinner rotation now! My husband and teenage son both adored it. Even I liked it, and I'm not a sloppy joe fan. 
I made minimal changes. We prefer ground turkey over beef so I used that, and instead of garlic powder I tossed in a spoonful of minced garlic. Very tasty, thanks for sharing this!

Will definitely make this again and I used the recipe as written, but increased to 6 servings and let Allrecipes site adjust the ingredient amounts for me so that I could feed a family of five.  May have had a touch over 1 1/2 lbs of meat.
