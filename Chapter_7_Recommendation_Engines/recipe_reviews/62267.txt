I've tried other marzipan recipes, but I like this one the best.  It was a big hit at our Nutcracker production this year.

I made this for my dad, who said it was some of the best marzipan he has ever had.

I was a bit nervous about how simple the recipe was, that it had to be missing something important, but it was really easy to make and got rave reviews from my family.

This was very good.  I thought it captured the almond flavor of the candy well.   One note - I found that if I waited a day or two to eat the candy, it had set up better and was tastier than when I first made it.

I love chocolate covered marzipan but its sooo expensive to buy in the stores, so I am so excited to find this recipe and that it turned out so well, and this recipe is far better than the marzipan I have purchased. I am also happy that it is eggless, since my kids love to eat it as well. The only thing I changed, is that I added a teaspoon of almond extract for some extra almond-ey flavor! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Fantastic! made it for a friend of mine and her husband and he really loves marzipan... and this was the first time I ever made it. I added a little bit of coco powder to the last step to give it more of a brown color. I made little roses out of it and decorated the top of the cake for it. the was a sour cream chocolate cake with raspberry filling... it was a great recipe he loved it!!

My mother spent a few years in Germany in her youth, apparently doing nothing but tasting delicious deserts. Anyways, she's a self-described "marzipan snob" and usually refuses to eat it. After some basic coercion and much begging on my part, she agreed to try it...and said it was the best marzipan she's ever had. I made this in order to sculpt little bananas to top some banana-filled chocolate cupcakes I made. I brought the leftovers to my boyfriends house, and his 10 year-old brother greatly enjoyed making figures out of it. It's a great activity for kids, if your kids like playdough and you're okay with cleaning up the inevitable mess. As one might expect, it's sort of a pain to work with (mine was really sticky and I didn't want to add too much sugar for fear of grainy candy) but the texture is perfect; not to dry as lots of marzipan usually is. The corn syrup really adds a lot. Overall, there's nothing I would change, and I'll definitely be making it again.

I will never buy premade marzipan again. This tastes so much better and you get so much more product.

I can't believe how easy this was.  I made marzipan pumpkins and apples to decorate a cake.  Everyone was so impressed and the marzipan was delicious!

Wonderful!  I just made it for cake decorations for a birthday cake for my Dad and it turned out beautifully. I molded small marzipan oranges and they look soo cute.  Plus, it tastes awesome.  I never like marzipan when I was a kid but this recipe is delicious.  I used a pastry blender to break up the almond paste and combine it with the sugar.

This is a messy, but easy marzipan recipe! I use it to cover cakes and to create marzipan flowers, and other fun stuff. People who love marzipan will really love this confection!

What a great recipe!  I substituted one cup of dark cocoa for one cup sugar and omitted the food coloring.  I also rolled these into little balls and decorated with a white chocolate chip.  So many rave reviews!

I make this every year for Christmas gift tins and at first it was received a bit warily since no one in my fiancee's family or my friends from school had ever heard of it, but now I get frequent requests for it as the holidays come up.  I use candy molds from Wilton's to shape mine instead of rolling it out, as it seems to make the perfect sized pieces for eating and they fit nicely in the mini-cupcake papers to go in the tins.  I just roll a ball in sugar and press it into the mold (I usually use a heart or flower shape) and they pop right back out.  If you don't roll them in sugar first they tend to stick a bit.

Perfect recipe. It was a big hit. I didn't color it. I just rolled it out and made star shapes with a cookie cutter.  Next time I plan to dip it in dark chocolate.

Thank you for this recipe.  It was easy, quick and very tasty.  Because I have arthritis in my hands, I used a food processor to mix it....super easy!  I will be making this again!!

As good as any marzipan I've bought. Very easy, yet super delicious. I rolled the marzipan to 1/4 - 1/2 inch thickness and cut out with the rim of a shot glass powdered in confectioners sugar (I couldn't find mini cookie cutters). They were a nice size and some of them I dipped in melted chocolate - superb!

Great recipe! I used to make this every year at Christmas and shape it into fruits. It's been a few years since I made it, so I had to find a new recipe for it. This one is perfect!  Love it!

This is a great recipe!!  I wanted to buy some chocolate covered marzipan for my Mom and Grandma for Christmas, but couldn't find it locally and tried this.  I cut out Christmas trees, covered them in dark chocolate then topped them with chopped hazelnuts.  They turned out wonderful!!!  My husband took some to school and had a foreign exchange student from Germany taste it, she said it tasted just like the ones back home! Great Recipe!

I would rate this 4 stars only because it was a little difficult and time consuming to make. I had to go to Whole Foods to find some ingredients.

This is the first time ever making marzipan & I have to say it was pretty easy!  Only downside is when coloring it with the food coloring my hands got quite colorful & I had to wash them between each color.  Was a lot of fun to make though!

This is the best marzipan candy recipe I've found.  I really like that it doesn't use egg whites.  It is delicious.  I won't be buying this candy at the store any more now that I can make it at home and it's much better than store bought.

Surprisingly simple to make. These turned out well, and seemed to keep fine even at room temp for a few days. They also froze well, so extras can easily be saved. Made these for my mom, who seemed to quite enjoy them.

We can't buy marzipan locally here, but I have been craving it for months, so I thought I would try this recipe. It was amazing! It has all of the delicate flavor that I love about the store-bought version, but for less than half the price. Delicious. I'm planning on making more so I can give it away for the holidays (yes, I'm a little behind, but once my friends taste this, i don't think they'll care).
