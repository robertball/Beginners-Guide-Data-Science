I made only half of the recipe and wound up with 3 servings. I used a whole egg, Silk Unsweetened Coconut Milk and Pyure Stevia. I mashed the bananas only because of personal preference. I don't think it tasted anything like an oatmeal cookie but it was very good.

Pudding is so quick and to make. I will definitely make it again. Next time will make sure I have whip cream on hand to top this yummy pudding.
