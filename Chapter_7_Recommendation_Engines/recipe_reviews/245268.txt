The flavors of this reminded me of a gyro. So many levels of flavor that we couldn't stop eating it! I will make this again and again. Also rather healthy! I made no changes and see no need to.

This was a great and easy Mediterranean Salad. I made it exactly as presented. I love finding ways to use quinoa since I find it quite bland otherwise. But I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed the shrimp marinated with these simple ingredients. I served the salad with roasted broccoli florets and a fresh french baquette and butter. My husband and I both loved it. Start to finish, including cooking the shrimp first because I used fresh frozen raw shrimp with tails on, and cutting up the broccoli for roasting in the oven, took 30 minutes. Hubby helped with the chopping so it saved time.
