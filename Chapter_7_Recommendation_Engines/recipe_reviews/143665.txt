The ice cream is quite good, but a little too heavy on the almond flavoring - it is VERY evident. Were I to make this again, I would reduce the almond extract by half or eliminate it altogether.  After all, this is called Vanilla Cherry Ice Cream, not Almond Cherry Ice Cream. I like my ice cream rich, so as I always do I used 2 c. heavy cream, 1 c. half and half, and added two eggs.  Beat the eggs for 1-2 minutes, gradually add the sugar, beat another minute to dissolve the sugar, then add cream, half and half and flavoring.  I used frozen Door County cherries, which I thawed, quartered, and added during the last few minutes of churning.  Rich, velvety smooth mouth feel and intensely cherry. Definitely worth a repeat, but definitely with reducing the amount of almond extract.

Cutting cherries in quarters would be my only suggestion for improving this recipe. If you just cut them in half, they are a little too large and like hard balls when frozen. They are much more manageable in quarters. Otherwise I really loved this recipe!

Very cool, creamy, and easy to make. I used half-and-half and heavy cream. I had 1 lbs of fresh bing sweet cherries, pitted, half of it rough chopped, the other, sliced in halves. After reading others review I omitted the almond extract. I used 1 vanilla bean, spilt lenghwise. TIP: Please use vanilla beans if you can! They make such a difference!  Once combined, I chilled everything before making the ice cream, about 4 hours or so. Took 30 minutes to make in the ice cream maker and it was so creamy, rich and smooth which is perfect on a hot day. I loved the frozen cherries I bit into. I am glad I left out the almond extract. This turned out fantastic. I just kept on eating and eating. I would definitely make this again, but without the almond extract and using real vanilla bean! UPDATE 08/12/11: Made this again but with 2 cups of Maraschino Cherries. I rough chopped some and halved the others.  So super delicious! Sweet, juicy and "candy" like cherries swirled in vanilla ice cream. My family ate this entire recipe up in one night! Going to make this again. *note-if you decide to try it this way, know that the red maraschino juice will turn the milk/cream mixture a pinkish red color. Also used, "Sweetened Whipped Cream," from this site, to top it off.

OMG! This is soooo good! I doubled the recipe and I used some pitted frozen cherries (quartered)from grandma's tree. I used half the cream and the other half was fat free half and half, and I used fat free milk because that is all I had and it is so amazing! Blew away the peach ice cream we had a couple weeks ago! Super easy too!

This was so good, I did cut the almond extrct in half. We didn't miss it. The only problem with this recipe is cutting and pitting fresh cherries. But oh so worth it.

This was my first attempt at making ice cream at home and it is excellent!  I cut the cherries smaller than the recipe called for and served each dish with several of the halved cherries on top.  Yummy!

Love this recipe.  My version is as follows:
Substitute half and half for the milk...
Use Maraschino cherries, quartered...
Add 1/2 cup toasted almonds...
Add 1/8 cup of Maraschino cherry juice...
Add vanilla beans from one vanilla bean...
Cut the almond extract in half.

I doubled the recipe except for the almond flavoring, I left at 1 tsp.  Reducing it was perfect, and get it a lovely taste!

The basic aspect of this recipe is great. It is straight up simple and quick and makes an ice cream that's not too rich and not too sweet. To my mind though, to make it truly "vanilla cherry", it needs only a tiny drop of almond extract, and the cherries should be added in near the end of processing. The almond essence essentially wiped out the vanilla, and my very ripe fresh cherries were a little too well blended in. It did have a great cherry-almond flavor, and I would make it again if I wanted a strictly cherry ice cream, but I'd also add in some chocolate chunks to give it some more interest and texture.

Great recipe!  I tried it with frozen cherries cut into quarters, but next time I'd use fresh cherries or maraschino cherries.  The frozen ones were a little too "frozen tasting".  I really liked the almond extract in this.  Gave the flavor a little more depth, but didn't overpower.  I also finely chopped a bar of milk chocolate, as well.  That added a nice dimension, and a little bit of sweet.  YUM!

Loved the taste, but the cherry pieces were too big.  I only halved the cherries, but next time, I will chop them more finely.

I loved the almond flavoring. This ice cream was very good...I only used 1 and 1/2 cups of cherries and thought even that was a little heavy handed when all was frozen up. I did add a 1/4 cup of tart cherry juice concentrate and 2 dark chocolate bars that I diced up. Yum! Will make again for sure!

Like many other members, I omitted the almond extract. I like a lot of flavor in my ice cream, so I pureed an additional cup of cherries and added that to the other ingredients. I also shaved a piece of semi-sweet bakers chocolate, and that was great. This is an awesome recipe I'll be using again!

I had high hopes for this recipe and it did not disappoint.  Only change was to reduce amount of almond extract to 1/4 tsp. For me, that was perfect.  It really works best to quarter the cherries and add them during the last few minutes so as not to have them all sink to the bottom. This is decadent and refreshing. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

So good.  To fit in my ice cream maker I had to halve the recipe.  I used 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half and half but still used 2 cups cherries, which I quartered.  Got rave reviews from family members!

Love the undertone of the almond, just make sure you are conservative with it as a little goes a long way. I scaled down the recipe because we don't like to eat a lot of this, it is nice for a different flavor once in a while. You could serve this with chocolate, whipped cream or crushed graham crackers too!

I am a picky ice cream maker and this recipe is very good recipe! The only change I made was instead of using fresh cherries, I used frozen sweet cherries, cut them into quarters and I also added mini chocolate chips!! I used 2 c. heavy cream and 1 c. whole milk along with the vanilla and almond extract. (remember my grandma using whole milk) Will make again!

This hasn't even finished freezing yet and I love it!  Super yummy- tasted it right out of the ice cream maker.  Doubled the recipe, cut the almond extract in half, used frozen pitted cherries from Costco - HEAVEN!

really good recipe... i have been making ice creams for a while and this is a great non-cook base to build other recipe ideas on. many other comments said too much almond extract, i left the almond alone and changed the sugar to just under 2/3. i waited until the last 5 minutes of freezing time to add the cherry pieces, which were finely chopped. i also added grated dark chocolate and slivers of almond nuts to make it a cherry almond ice cream... really big hit with my dinner party!!

Too easy!  I did reduce almond extract to 1/2 tsp which I think was the perfect amount.  It did taste a bit like flavored cool whip though.

Maraschino cherries are packed in a syrup with almond extract. Smell some bitter almond or almond extract. It smells like maraschinos. The recipe calls for fresh cherries, so adding almond extract would be correct. 1 teaspoon may be too much. Many recipes must be experimented with.

I'm a huge cherry vanilla fan.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just not a hit.  Almond was too strong, vanilla was not strong enough.  Maybe the milk and cream need a vanilla bean simmered with it and not just extract added? It also made this weird film-feeling inside my mouth.  The cherries had poor texture with big ice crystals.  Maybe maraschino cherries would do better?  We threw the rest away and won't be trying it again.

Mmm Mmm Mmm!  Thank you Shay for a recipe that uses fresh cherries!  Based on previous comments, I did cut the cherries in quarters and used just over half a teaspoon of almond extract.  My friends raved about this ice cream!  When I make this recipe again (and I WILL make it again), I'm going to cut back on the almond flavoring even more (maybe 1/4 tsp) and add an ounce or two of high quality dark chocolate - shaved.  It will taste a lot like Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia.  Yum!

I made this with skim milk and it was still fine.  I also used frozen cherries (I quartered them).  Can't wait to try it with peaches and nectarines.  So yummy... loved the almond in the background.

We had fresh picked Bing cherries and used them in this ice cream. It was so delicious. It was easy to substitute Splenda so even my diabetic mother-in-law could share with us.

I read the reviews, and did make a few adjustments.  We're not into overly sweet anything these days (3/4 cup of sugar sounded like a lot), and I really wanted to enjoy the pure creamy flavor of the decadent whipping cream (a treat for us), so I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup which worked perfectly (just a person taste preference).  I also cut the almond extract by half to 1/2 tsp, and that was more than enough to not dominate.  I wanted the tasty Rainier cherries to be the flavor star, not the almond extract.  That being said, this was the perfect dessert, with a great balance between vanilla and cherry, for a July 4th grilled steak dinner.

I am only new to making ice cream and I have had some epic fails with my experimentation (i.e too eggy, too icy, too hard to do). This is the best recipe base by far. It is quick and easy and I can just add whatever I want. I have reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup (especially when adding cherries in syrup or  a dessert sauce) and omitted the almond extract and it is still awesome. 1/2 cows milk and half almond milk was good too. I also agree to chop the cherries smaller if that is what you want to mix in.

I did like this recipe but I did have to modify it a bit. I cut back the sugar to half a cup and left out the almond extract (not something I keep stocked in my pantry). I also combined everything in the blender and mixed it that way so that there were small pieces of cherries and the sugar was more evenly mixed so it wouldn't be grainy. I just wish I would have had some chocolate chunks to add to this!

It was just what I was looking for! I've been looking for an easy recipe without eggs or condensed milk. I followed the recipe except I used jarred cherries instead (because cherries are not in season yet), and put some of the juices from the jar but it was good without that. I added melted chocolate to it while it mixed. 

It was so good and would of been great without my changes.

Very good and creamy.  My only changes were to use 2% milk and a 16oz. jar of maraschino cherries, drained and cut in half. In error, I used an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract instead of almond.  (I grabbed the wrong bottle) I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you FutureChefShay for sharing.

For people that enjoy good homemade ice cream, this recipe should be skipped.  Was skeptical going in due to the lack of ingredients/steps and it was for good reason.  If it's your first time making ice cream, maybe this is a good first step.

This ice cream is delicious.  I halved the almond extract as several reviewers recommended but I found that the taste was still a little too strong.  I cut the cherries in quarters but when freezing they all sunk to the bottom.  Next time I will cut them even smaller.

This was my favorite flavor of ice cream I've made so far! Everyone who tasted it loved it.  I wish there was a way to make it healthier and keep the great flavor.  I would also cut the cherries into smaller pieces and maybe use less.

This is one of the best ice creams I've ever tasted.  Super simple to make too.  I used fresh cherries and it was awesome.  I might cut back to a scant tablespoon of vanilla next time.  I'm going to try this recipe with other flavors next!!

LOVED IT!! I was having some guests coming over for dinner and wanted to whip up a dessert and found this. At first I wasn't so sure about making my own ice cream but then when I finally finished it, it was a great result. I would definitely   make this again if guests are coming over or just for my family. I would definitely keep some extra cherries and keep more than one or two of them on the top.

I love this ice cream! It was super easy except for the time and effort to pit and cut up the cherries!  I cut the cherries up finer than halves and only put 1/2 t. of the almond flavoring.  Perfect!!

The taste of this ice cream was delicious but it never got hard in my ice cream freezer. I have made other ice creams and they were like soft serve when finished but this ice cream was still liquid. I have it in the freezer and hope it sets up. . I followed the recipe except I used thawed frozen cherries and  1/2 tsp of almond extract. The flavor was exactly like a good cherry vanilla bought ice cream. My bowl was solidly frozen.

This recipe is delicious!!  It is super easy to make, and oh so good!  Instead of almond extract,  I used a table spoon of cherry flavoring.  I also used thawed dark cherries, and added them after chopping them in the food processor.

Very sweet.  Recommend cutting back on the sugar.

Good overall. It made a bit more than my ice cream maker could handle so it got a little messy. I chopped the cherries vs just halving them. At the end of the churning, I added sone chopped pieces of dark chocolate. Overall, pretty good. The consistency ended up a bit more like ice milk than ice cream, but I'm willing to give that to my ice cream maker being over filled.

Pretty good.  I made the recipe exactly and have to agree with others that there isn't much vanilla flavor in the final product; you taste cherry/almond.

Delicious and so simple! I used fresh Rainier and Bing cherries and followed the recipe exactly as written. The almond flavoring sets it apart from just plain vanilla ice cream. I like that there's no eggs and no cooking involved. Took me 10 min to put together. I'm making this for our 4th of July gathering.

Followed the directions to a t, except coarse sugar instead of granulated sugar. Pretty yummy, but some would find it overly sweet. Definitely would make this again, considering it was so easy. No eggs, so didn't have to cook the custard!

NOTE: This happened to make a tad bit too much for my ice cream maker. Maybe cut back on a tiny bit of sugar or cherries next time.

The ice cream turned out however tasted too much like whipped cream and not vanilla ice cream.
