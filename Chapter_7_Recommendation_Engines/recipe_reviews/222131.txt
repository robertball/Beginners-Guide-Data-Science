I had half a roasted chicken leftover so I approached this recipe a little differently.  I used 3 Tablespoons of grapeseed oil instead of the butter (a little healthier) and cooked the onion, diced carrots in the oil on medium low heat - I used 4 stalks of celery - add the celery to the onions and carrots and cooked for a couple of minutes.  Add the flour, salt and pepper - stir to form a roux and then added about a cup of chicken broth, stir until it started to thicken and then added just a splash or two of milk - cook until thickened (adjust thickness after the sauce has come to a boil)  I then stirred in the peas (I used more peas as I had a half a bag in the freezer) and the cubed, cooked chicken.  Stir to combine.  I want a thick mixture to fill the pie crust.  You can add any vegetables you have on hand.  If you have leftover cooked vegetables add them with the chicken.  I used a basic short crust pastry recipe.  The bottom crust will not be soggy if your chicken mixture is thick enough.  If you want to cut out a few more calories use just a top crust.

Easy to make, very very very good!!!! Even my picky husband liked it. I actually simplified it and used canned carrot and pea mix, eliminated the celery and used pre-cooked honey baked chicken. Will definitely make again.

My fiancee and I both really liked this chicken pot pie! We both agreed that there were too many pea's. Next time we will probably 1/2 pea's and 1/2 something else. I also couldn't find whole wheat pie crust anywhere so had to swap for the regular kind. Otherwise this recipe is really tasty and will be made again! Only wish I could of convinced my 3 year old to try it.

Great recipe, Even my very picky boys loved it, they both want the leftovers for lunch tomorrow :)
I didnt have celery so I left it out.  I also didnt have celery seed. I used 1/2 tsp celery salt instead of the celery seed and salt.

There really isn't much difference between this and the original, which I had been meaning to make. I normally use low fat or fat free milk anyway and the minimum amount of butter so that was in line with what's suggested here. However, it's much lower in fat and calories if you get rid of some of the pie crust. I had leftover chicken so boiled the veggies in the broth; reserved the broth; added 2T butter to the veggies, stirred in the flour, and then slowly incorporated the milk; returned the broth to the pot. When this thickened, I added the chicken and peas. I poured into two 4 x 7 baking dishes and used about 3/4 of a pie crust cut into rectangles to cover. (I saved the extra scraps for another use.) This was 4 hearty servings. By making those small changes, this calculated at about 416 calories and 17g fat at 4 servings or 208 cal and 8.5g fat for 8 (as written). Healthier is subjective, but I would prefer to have more substance and less wrapping for something like this.

I love this recipe, and its great for my son who has several food allergies. To simplify, I saute  2.5 -3 cups of veggies (carrots, onions, celery, peas) in 3 tbl butter. I saute 2 chicken breasts separately, and then add it to the veggies.  When the veggies are tender, it mix in the flour, spices, and finally the chicken broth. Instead of cows milk I add a dash of almond milk.  Cook on medium heat till thickens then pour into the pour into the pie crust and bake. Much easier

Big blizzard tonight so it's a perfect night for this recipe.  The very first time I've ever made one, especially made from scratch.   Didn't buy the crusts, also made them from scratch.
It was delicious and didn't need the heavy cream or potatoes in OTHER chicken pot pie recipes.  My husband of 47 years loved it.

This is a great recipe. It is better than the recipe I grew up on and brought forth true "comfort food" rewards.   I too added garlic, tarragon, basil and fresh parsley (which I rescued from the garden before frost and is living happily in a pot by the kitchen window). I felt it came together well and I like that I know all the ingredients.  Because I am single and did not want to have a soggy crust before I was able to eat it all, I made "J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits" from this site (wonderful) and put the mixture over them...wonderful. SO GOOD.

I've never attempted to make pot pie before but boy was this one worth it! It was much soupier than expected so I served in bowls but it was a HUGE hit. Only change I made was I didn't add the peas to the chicken right away, fearing they'd get mushy. I added them with about 3-5 mins before the chicken was thoroughly cooked. My husband's comment was "add this to your winter repeat file!"

I have tried and we have liked it.  I do use lower sodium products, skim milk etc. and the next time I do it I will only put on a top crust.  We are a retired couple and this makes two good meals for us.

Really Good! Hubby and kids devoured it. No left overs. Instead of the pie crust I used the reduced fat crescent roll dough. Just spread it over the top and cook, it was delish.

Loved It and so Yummy!  Especially wanted recipes without the additive laden ready-made soup!  This is pre-Cambell's just like Grandmother's Yummy Warm Feeling Chicken Pot Pie.  We used to beg for it!

This was great! It was a little under-seasoned; I think next time I'll add more salt and pepper, and maybe cauliflower (just because I like it so much). Super good and easy!

I will definitely make this again. My kids (2yrs and 5yrs) and I loved it. I used canola butter for less saturated fat, omitted the salt because I felt there was enough in the chicken broth. I will make this again and make some extra sauce, I agree with some others that it was a little dry.

We loved this. I used refrigerator pie crusts, not having the wheat.  I also added more seasonings.  The only complaint was that one pie leaves no leftovers!  It's that good!

I used more carrots as someone else suggested and added chopped garlic (3 cloves). Also I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder (that was the only salt I used). Then I put just enough water so that I didn't have to drain it. I felt like too much would have watered down the flavor. Finally, I read some of the other reviews and the celery seed really makes a difference for those of you that skipped on it :)

I did change things up a little bit. I pre-cooked my chicken in  the crockpot with a thin layer of chicken broth and then shredded it with a hand mixer while it was still warm. Then I added the cooked chicken to the recipe. 

I also forgot celery seed so didn’t put that in and it tasted fine without it.

This recipe is delicious, thank you so much for sharing!  Even my husband who said he wasn't into chicken pot pie LOVED this and had seconds.  Yesssss!  Leftovers are (were) great.  :-) The only thing I did differently based on input from others was cook the chicken mixture in chicken broth instead of water, and I added some poultry seasoning and about 2 teaspoons of the Chicken Better than Bouillon  to the sauce mixture.  Fabulous!  I will be making several to freeze, also.

Cooked chicken and veggies in broth, then drained broth off to use.  Subbed potatoes for peas.  Added about an extra 1/2 cup liquid.  Sauce was rather bland so I added extra pepper, Mrs. Dash, and Bavarian Inn Chicken Seasoning.  Also couldn't find whole wheat crust so just used standard.

Tasted fantastic with these changes!

Turned out great. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken and a bag of frozen peas and carrots.  I sautéd the onion and celery together.  Will definitely make it again.

I didn’t have the proper pan so I used my glass Pyrex dish and put the pie shell on the bottom. I only used one pie shell on the bottom to save on calories and carbs. I also only used one tbsp of butter. I also used rosemary instead of celery seed. Everything turned out delicious and I enjoyed it for leftovers days later.

I resisted the urge to make changes with one exception. Instead of cooking the chicken and vegetables in water which was then discarded, I cooked them in the broth then removed with a slotted spoon when done. I resisted the urge to leave out either the celery seed or the celery as I felt that both would be too much. I was right, at least for my taste. This was pretty good but I felt that it needed something more. I think that next time I'll add some garlic but leave out the celery seed.

I made it almost exactly as the recipe said except I didn’t have celery seed and I only used the top pastry - it came out great and everyone loved it.  I only have one thing I may do differently next time and that is to cook the chicken in the stock so no waste and use same for the sauce. I also only used half of the flour and it was thick enough for me.

Nice to see a homemade recipe that doesn't rely on high sodium creamed soups!   Great as written and seasoning is such a personal preference, but I added a little dried basil and some poultry seasoning.   Loses 1 star for using a bought crust,  only because we prefer homemade.  Used only a top crust to reduce fat which doesn't present as pretty but just as tasty!

I think the potato was too much.  I think it made very dense. I'm looking for a pie that has more of a gravy stew filling.

Great recipe! Made it exactly as listed, except I didn't use a wheat crust! Anybody that says it's bland must have missed an ingredient!

Our 3 and 5 year olds declared it delicious - so it has the all important kid seal of approval.  The only change I did was to make my own whole wheat pie crust.  We'll be making this again (and again and again).

This was great! I couldn't find a pie crust that had a top so I put the pastry top on it. Wasn't bad but I would try and make a crust top the next time. I also substituted the white flour for a wheat flower and added a little celery salt.. My son loved it. Lasted two days lol

This is amazing - subbed celery for corn and did a pulled rotisserie chicken. Best recipe I've found for pot pie!

This was really good!  I think next time I'll add potatoes instead of celery and onion though (personal preference).  It was very easy and a great way to use leftover rotisserie chicken.

Relatively easy to make and delicious!  I sub out the pie crust for crescent roll dough, which isn't as healthy, but way tastier.
