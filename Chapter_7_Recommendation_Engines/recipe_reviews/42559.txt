I was skeptial about cooking ribs in the slow cooker, but ribs were on sale and I thought I would give these a try since I already had all the other ingredients on hand.  I sure am glad I did!  My family LOVED them!  14 year old son gave them 2 thumbs up!  After reading the reviews I made a couple of minor changes to the recipe.  I reduced the amount of vinegar to only 1/2 a cup and added an extra clove of garlic (we love garlic in just about everything).  I browned the ribs and then dunked them in the sauce making asure they were well coated in the sauce before placing them in the slow cooker.  Then I poured the sauce over the top.  I cooked them on low all day, about 7 or 8 hours and then took them out, placed them on a broiler pan, slathered them with bottled barbeque sauce and baked them at 300 degrees for about 15 minutes while I got together the rest of the meal.  The sauce in the slow cooker was just to thin and runny so I added this last step to give them that restaurant sticky goodness.  The meat was tender and just fell off the bones!  YUM-YUM-YUM!!!  So easy and so delicious!  Definitely give these a try!

This was my first attempt at ribs and my husband and I loved them.   I doubled the recipe.  The meat was falling off of the bones after just 4 hours of cooking.  I am going to shred the leftover meat and make sandwiches for lunch tomorrow.

This is a great recipe for country style ribs also.  I took other readers suggestions and doubled the recipe, which was enough for a family of 4.  However, there were no left overs!  I have also tried different types of vinegar and foud that white wine vinegar works really well also.

I wasn't sure about cooking ribs in a slow cooker, but since I've never cooked ribs at all, I thought I would give it a shot. After reading all the reviews, I adjusted the sace a little bit by leaving the vinegar the same, but doubling all the other sauce ingredients and adding 3/4 cup packed brown sugar. Approximately 15 minutes before I was ready to serve the ribs, I put them and the sauce into the oven on 350 for 10 minutes then broiled them for 5 minutes. They were amazing!!! My husband immediately requested to make this a regular dish. We had some left over and it was even better when I used them in sandwiches for lunch the next day.

I made these yesterday in a Dutch Oven - don't have a crock pot. They were really tasty. Added a little liquid smoke to them. I would wish for a little thicker sauce, perhaps adding some cornstarch in the liquid ingredients might help, or cooking in an oven uncovered - or both. Perhaps someone else has an idea on how achieve a thicker sauce that clings to the meat. In any case, it's a good, easy recipe.

My whole family loved these.  I doubled the recipe and there still weren't many ribs left over.  I personally wasn't very impressed with them.  Before I started, I was expecting the sauce to be thicker.  Well, now I know.  They were good, just not what I was wanting from ribs.

Delicious! Only things I changed was adding a half an onion minced, and adding some cornstarch and water when the ribs were almost done to thicken as the sauce was really liquidy. will definitely make it again!!

Very tender and tastey ribs! Definately fell of the bone. I did reduce the vinegar, even less than other reviewers, to 1/4 cup. I thought that would help with the sauce being watery, plus we don't care for vinegary BBQ sauce, but it didn't matter. The sauce still turned out very watery. Good flavor though.

Excellent! I made these for New Years dinner and everyone raved at how tender and mosit the meat was I will always crock pot my ribs from this day forward.  I used country style browned them in the oven 15-20 mins, cooked them 5 hours in crock and then transfered them to the grill for carmelization (they were nearly too tender for the grill my husband complained).  I cooked so much everyone took some home

I used country style boneless ribs, which came out very tender.  But we did not care for the sauce.  Way too much vinegar IMO.  Next time I will stick with a traditional barbeque sauce.

I'm pretty new to cooking and was quite terrified of making spareribs but couldn't pass up the deal at the grocery store. These were incredibly easy and taste amazing. I didn't modify the recipe at all :-)

I followed this recipe to a T. I was skeptical using spareribs in the slow cooker - boney, greasy mess. So after they cooked I smothered in Bar-B-Que sauce from this site and put in a 350 degree oven for about 10 - 15 minutes and they were very good. Not restaurant quality but good - no leftovers. I will make again but use boneless country style ribs. Love the tang - Thanks

these were good ribs however the sauce was really runny.  I thickened it up with some cold water and cornstarch in a separate saucepan.

Made the sauce exactly the way it was written (don't you just hate reading reviews that add stuff?). I just used twice as many ribs because we're "piggy". I'm also lazy so I broiled the ribs for a few minutes instead of hauling out my skillet. That's why I like slow-cooker recipes too. Went off to the race track for the day and had a delicious meal when I got  home!

I made these ribs last night for my family & everyone loved them.  I used apple cider vinegar & reduce it to 1 cup as recommended.  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch, bushed it on the ribs & broiled x 10 minutes.  I will reduce cooking time as ribs completely fell apart.  We'll make these again.

I always read as many reviews as I can and it was helpful to know about the vinegar.  I used a half cup and the sauce was tangy enough.  Next time I may finish them off in the oven like another reviewer did.  I used country style ribs in the crockpot.

I followed the directions exactly except for adding regular mustard and some hot pepper flakes. The ribs came out tender and flavorful. This recipe is very easy and quick for a week night meal.

I was very disappointed.  Putting the ribs in the slow cooker and covering with bottled bbq sauce is way better...won't be using this recipe again.

I made this based on the high rating but didn't know most people rated it after DECREASING the amount of vinegar. I made the recipe as it is stated and almost all you can taste is the overwhelming flavor of vinegar. I never rate things this poorly, but this is practically ruining dinner. I've tried to remedy it with a bottle of prepared sauce, but it won't be able to remove the vinegar from the meat.

These came out great- my kids wanted them for dessert too!

I would definitely cut down on vinegar next time.  I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar and another clove of garlic.  And make sure to brown the ribs first!  AWESOME flavor!!!!

When I read the reviews I was happy to see how well everyone liked this but unfortunately I can't agree.  I am sorry.  While the pork was nice and tender, the family (hubby & 2 children) said it did not have much taste.

It is true:  these ribs are so tender they almost fall apart when you get them out of the crockpot!  They really are delicious but I just wish the sauce was thicker when finished, maybe adding some cornstarch at the end would help?

This was so easy and yes, the meat just fell off the bones.  I had no left overs and was asked when this dish will be served again.  A Big Hit! (I made 2.8 lbs, I had one serving, probably .8 lbs. and my friend ate the rest)

These were amazing!! They were falling-off-the-bone, no-leftovers delicious!  I did alter the recipe slightly, by using beef-ribs instead of pork, and guesstimating on the spice measurements instead of using measuring spoons, but they were still terrific. 

My only complaint is that I prefer sweet with just a little tangy, instead of tangy with just a little sweet, but I gave the recipe 5-stars anyway because they came out just the way the recipe said they would.  Next time, because of my own preferences, I'll probably use a little bit more sugar and little bit less vinegar.

All in all, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made these ribs exactly according to the recipe and both my husband and I were disapointed.  Too much vinegar for our taste, and that was the only flavor that came through on the final product.
Not a keeper for us.

These came out so tender and delish. There were no leftovers. It would make good meat for pulled pork sandwich. My family requests this by name.

Too much vinegar!  Made the recipe exactly as written, except I baked the ribs in 9x13 @ 375 degrees for about 1 hour before putting them in the croc pot.  Won't use the same recipe again.

Only use boneless county ribs! Otherwise you get little cartilage pieces in your ribs/sauce.

This recipe is good. I used 4 cloves of garlic and a little over 3 lbs. of country style pork ribs (trying to save money - way cheaper than spareribs). After about 4 and a half hours, the meat was falling off the bone. Very tender and tasty. Note that if you are looking for a thick sauce, you will not get it with this recipe. The juices at the bottom were watery. Overall very good and will make again.

Did the recipe exactly as written except I doubled everything but the ribs (did 3.4 lbs).  They were definitely tangy and I liked the flavor but he viniger was extreemly strong.  Next time I will scale back on the viniger.

My husband likes ribs.  I can take them or leave them.  I followed this recipe to the letter.  The meat was fall of the bone tender.  It was just too vinegary for our taste.  I will try it again with my own BBQ sauce recipe and see how it turns out.  It's well worth trying though.

Not too tasty for my liking.  I found that you could cut back on the vinigar by about a third.  Mabee I'm spoiled as I usually have ribs done in a smoker.

I doubled the amounts and used four pounds of ribs.  I also added about 1/2 of a coarsely chopped yellow onion to the sauce before adding the ribs.  They cooked nicely and were very tender, but still lacked a little something.  I put BBQ sauce (about half a bottle) in and cooked for another 30 minutes, and they were great.  Not too heavy on the sauce, but a little thicker than the juice they cooked in.  We'll do this again.

Not a keeper.  Wife said meat was like boiled in water.  Not tasty like normal baked ribs.  I think pork ribs and crock pot are not friends.

very good flavor.  The ribs seemed a little bit dry.  I put them under the broiler for a few minutes to brown them after removing from slow cooker.

This is good. I will probably use this recipe again when we have ribs. I put all the ingredients in a pasta pot on the stove and boiled on med. until done. Then I basted with BBQ sauce and broiled for 10 minutes. The ribs were also good cold the next day on a bun.

I guess this dish was alright.... the marinade didn't cover the ribs in the slow cooker and I was woried about that as I wasn't going to be home to turn them all day so I added a can of chopped tomato in peri peri sauce.... the final product was still a little boring, tasting mostly of vinegar so I took another reviewers suggestion and took the ribs out of the crock pot, lathered them in BBQ sauce and finished them off in the oven. They were pretty delicious after that.... but I didn't think they were that good without the BBQ sauce

Made with a pork loin instead of ribs (had it on hand & thought it might be good to try), & glad for it, it was soooo delicious!  I can hardly wait to make with ribs, the whole family ate it up!

I've never made ribs before, too scared to try.  I thought I would give these a try and I'm glad I did.  Excellent!  Everyone loved them.  I did back down on the vinegar and they came out very tasty and tender.

Absolutely delicious. My family loved this recipe- it is a good thing that I tripled it. I served it with sour cream mashed potatoes- the juice goes great with mashed potatoes! This is definitely a keeper!

We really didn't care for the tang of these ribs. I ended up dumping out all the juice and adding a bottle of BBQ sauce and let it sit in the crock pot for a little longer to soak in that flavor. Yeah, they turned out tender but most do in the crockpot for 5 hours...We won't use this recipe again, sorry.

Amazingly EASY, and OH SO TASTY. These ribs melt in your mouth. The flavor is perfect, the spices are not overpowering, and the compliments the cook receives are endless. A much requested recipie to be made over and over.

These were excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used country style pork ribs, cooked them for 6 hours and they fell off the bone.  Delish!  Thank you.

I doubled the recipe thinking we'd have leftovers, but between 3 of us we polished the ribs off.  I've tried making ribs before using the boil & bake or boil & bbq methods to get them more tender, but this recipe is far superior.  The meat just fell off the bones and the sauce was delicious.  I served the ribs with mashed potatoes and peas & carrots and the sauce went really well with the mashed potatoes too.  I will definitely be making this again.
