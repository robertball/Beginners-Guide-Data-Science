I can't remember a cake I've made that was such a hit!  Everyone asks for the recipe when I make it. No one can guess what's in it.  I wouldn't serve it to non-drinkers though. Be sure and cool the cake completely before frosting it.  One time I made this, I followed the instructions on the cake box (called for egg whites instead of whole eggs, and 2 Tbl. oil instead of 1/2 cup).  I wished I hadn't done that - the texture just wasn't right.  I have found that 1 cup of milk is better than 1 1/2 cup - otherwise, the frosting is a bit too runny.  Note that 1 1/2 cups pecans is a 6 oz. package. Thanks so much for the recipe!!

What a super cake! I used a butter pecan cake mix and substituted a cup of strong coffee for the coffe liquor (since the last cake I made that called for a cup of it tasted of nothing but booze) and the cake turned out great. The praline layer was positively delicious, and the frosting? Y-U-M! I got so many compliments on the frosting itself as well as the cake when I brought it into work. The whole thing was just rich and delicious and great.

This is a fabulous cake - outstanding!  Very impressive and gourmet tasting! I made it for a gathering, and everyone profusely praised it and wanted the recipe.  Absolutely the best, and easy too!  Not inexpensive, though, since Kahlua and 1 1/2 cups pecans aren't cheap, but I must say this cake is worth every penny!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!My only suggestion would be to downsize the Cool-Whip from 12 oz. to 8 oz. size.  There was so much frosting that I discarded some of it.  I also think by downsizing the Cool-Whip that the flavor of the vanilla pudding would show through a little more and enhance the frosting. I highly recommend this cake!

I've made this recipe 4 times now and everyone flips over it. One thing you may want to consider: rather than spreading the frosting on the cake I split it evenly with sewing thread forming a top and bottom layer and spread the frosting in between, pouring the pralines directly onto the cake (otherwise the pralines melt the frosting!). When I serve it I put a small dolop of frosting on the side as well. This makes a much cleaner presentation. Make this cake. You will not be disappointed!

This is WONDERFUL!!  I used caramel liquer instead of coffee.....awesome!  I used this for gift giving to our employees!  I just used two 8x8 cake pans & split the pecan mix and then the topping in half.  This worked out very well!  Thanks for helping my gift giving!!!

I made this for Bosses' Day and took it in. It was a huge hit by everyone who tasted it. Several people have already asked me for the recipe. I changed it a bit by using an 8 oz. container of Creamy Cool Whip and added a tablespoon or two of Kaluah to the icing which cut the sweetness a bit. It was perfect and I am now going to make it again for Thanksgiving for my family gathering. Whoever dreamed up this one gets a big A+ from me.

I made this cake with chocolate cake mix and Irish cream.  The cake was delicious. The pecan topping, however, tasted grainy.  I substituted 1 1/2 cups white sugar melted and caramelized, added the pecans and a pinch of baking soda, then poured the hot mixture over the cake.  The topping was to die for and so easy.  I used it to frost another cake (a friend used it on her carrot cake and got rave reviews).  Thanks for this recipe.

Yummm!!!  Even my non-cake-eating husband raved!  I used coffee instead of coffee liquor and real whipped cream instead of cool whip.  The frosting was out of this world...cleaned the bowl with a slice of bread...:-)

This was very good. I made it and we ate it the first time a day later. It tasted good but 2 days after I made it we all thought it was the best the 2nd day. I don't know if the flavors went through it better but much better the 2nd full day after I made this. I made a 2 layer cake.  I put part of the brown sugar mixture between the 2 layers.  I wish I would have put the whipped crem mixture also between the 2nd layer because it makes plenty even with cutting the whipped cream down to 8 oz. like many suggested. Will prob. make again. Very rich. I used a homemade Kahula and tasted great with that. Not to overpowering at all.

Soooo good.  Didn't add the liquor since some people at work don't like that flavor.  Delicious without it.  Next time I'll add it and see which way is better.

Oh my!  This was one of the best cakes I have ever had!  I used a cup of strong instant coffee instead of the liquer and used about 1/3 the amount of pecans (just because they are expensive) and an 8 oz container of cool whip instead of 12.  It turned out perfect!!  Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to indulge!

The praline topping and frosting were YUM, but the cake had a VERY strong Kahlua flavor, which isn't desirable to some guests.

This cake is a hit every time I make it.  The "cream" concoction makes the cake very moist and rich.  I sometimes substitute the cool whip with whipped cream and that works well too.

Very unique cake.  It is really rich, and like some of the others said, it's definitely a 'grown-up' cake.  I made it for a birthday, so to make it prettier I made two 8 x 8 cakes, put the pralines on top, then put icing in the middle and on the sides.  I also reserved some icing to use as a border, melted some butter and a square of bakers chocolate and added that to the reserved icing.  I put the border around the praline top, and at the bottom.  The whole thing was absolutely delicious, and it looked great that way, too.

Great Cake! If I could, I would give it 10 stars. Needed a quick dessert for a Red Hat Party, everyone loved it. Use 1 cup instant Espresso coffee and added 2 tsp. Brandy extract to cake. For topping, used Fat-free White Chocolate pudding instead of Vanilla pudding. I had many requests for recipe. Thank you for this recipe.

I made this cake for my church group, but I was disappointed.  I really expected something amazing and this just wasn't.  It was good, but not spectacular.  There was way too much praline topping and too much frosting which annoyed me because I hate wasting food!  I also was not that impressed with the frosting... not much flavor there.  I just expected to be really "wowed" with this recipe after reading the reviews... and it was just okay.

I took this to a mardi gras dinner - it was really the hit of the party!  You may want to try to use a deeper 13x9 pan, as the top layer/frosting makes the cake quite high.  Putting a lid on most rectangular cake savers will end up smashing down the frosting.  Won't look as nice, but will still taste fine.

The only part of this recipe I used was the cake itself.I think 1 cup of coffee liquor was way to much and it tasted strange and kind of nasty. But maybe if I had also used the toppings and frosting it wouldn't have been bad. I used my own frosting. It just tasted strange to me though. (My frosting was good, the cake's flavor was strange)

I had this in my recipe box for a long time and finally got around to making it for my book group.  My only regret is not making it sooner! It was absolutely delicious and people raved about it.  It is very rich, so small pieces are best for most people.  This is an easy and impressive special occasion dessert that I will definitely make again!

As others have stated, you'll get rave reviews and many requests for the recipe when you serve this.  
I actually preferred the leftovers on day 2.  It seemed like the flavors were more intense.  I'm also considering dribbling a little Kahlua on the cake before frosting the next time I make this.

As my kids say, "This is the bomb."  Fabulous cake.  Made as a sheeet cake and it was the favorite of all 15 cakes at the affair.  I used a butter cake flavored mix, and only had an 8 oz. container of cool whip.  Super recipe!

Very tasty cake. I too used the butter pecan cake mix & added a little bit of instant coffee to the batter. My only negative comment is that the frosting was not really thick/stiff enough to frost the entire cake but it worked well in between the layers. I ended up with extra pecan stuff and frosted the sides with it and the top with the frosting and piped plain whipped cream on it.

What's not to love about these ingredients? So I was totally shocked when I took the first bite of this cake, which I made for my husband's 35th birthday, and cringed all over. It is waaayyyy too sweet, something that hardly ever comes out of my mouth, and tastes very artificial and just not good at all. I followed the directions as stated, and don't even know what I could change to make this recipe work. Only reason for the 2 star rating instead of 1 star is because the praline topping part of it is usable maybe on some cinnamon rolls or something. Husband and children did not like it either. I felt bad for my husband as he was looking forward to trying this recipe as much as I was.  Ick.

Wonderful!  Thank you for sharing!  My ONLY suggestion is to make sure the cream cheese is well softened before mixing the icing.  I thought mine was softened enough, but my icing turned out a little lumpy, even after beating it for 5 mins+.  BUT, regardless, it was excellent!

This cake was indeed very easy to make.  I had no coffee liqueur so substituted brewed coffee and it seemed to work well.  The cake was for my office as I somehow became the  designated baker (after the last cake I brought in that I had made from a recipe through this web site).  It was a hit to say the least. This cake was enjoyed by those that usually never eat sweets and also by some other very talented bakers. This recipe is a keeper for sure!!

My husband and mother loved this cake, mom even asked for the recipe.  I thought it was just good.  I used Kahlua and as others mentioned, had way too much whipped topping even though only used 8 oz.  One strange thing is, my Mom is caffeine sensitive and the next day she said she barely slept a wink, had wondered if I somehow served her a drink with caffeine in it, that's when I realized the kahlua must have been the culprit!  She still took the recipe though, said she would serve it at a luncheon.

I expected to really like this, but somehow it didn't hit my head right.  It was the last thing to go off the dessert table at our neighborhood block party, and I noticed that a lot of people who took a piece didn't finish it.  Maybe my Kahlua wasn't any good.

Great cake--everyone loved it.  Using the 8 oz. cool whip is much better.  Still had  topping leftovers, but just freeze it!  Stores well and great to pull out for a spoonful on pumpkin or chocolate cream pie or even brownies--ummmmm.  The cake freezes well too.  The cake goes far as it is rich and you can use smaller portions.

What a keeper!  Have been asked several times for this recipe.  While there's certainly nothing wrong with the suggested topping, I can't wait to try a simple glaze and see what happens.

Thanks again!

I brought this to my sister's b-day party and EVERYONE loved it.  I only got a small piece!  The only change I'd make is to make less of the topping ... there was way too much, although we did use it up by putting extra dollops of topping on each piece :)  I've been requested to make it again.

This was delicious. I ran out of Kahlua so I substituted Creme de Cocoa and added instant coffee to it. Everyone asked for the recipe. You wouldn't know it was from a mix.

This was absolutely, hands down amazing.  There is no other way to put that.

The cake was delicious, the pralines were perfect and the frosting was spectacular.

I did have concerns at first about the frosting.  It didn't seem to thicken up correctly when I was beating it, but I went ahead and spread it on the cake, and stuck it back in the fridge overnight.  It really helped.  

I made totally as is, but one thing I will do next time is a layer cake, proabably round our square, with pralines topping on both, after it's chilled, spread a layer of the frosting on top of one of the cakes, and drop the other right on top.  Something I did do, that the folks who uploaded photos didn't, was to go ahead and frost over the praline layer.  It helped cut a little of the richness (pralines and cream!) and was a nice surprise for those who didn't know it was there.  I highly recommend going that rounte.  I've already had 3 people ask me to make this for birthdays or other events just after trying it this first time!

Very good recipe, esp for those who don't like chocolate, Kahlua is a bit overpowering though. Make sure you let the cream cheese come to room temp so the frosting will be smooth.

I had not made this cake in a long time but decided to make it again to take to my supper club. It never fails to get rave reviews. This time I made it with the liqueur rather than strong coffee as before. I also use a 9x13 pan as the recipe indicates. I'm taking copies of the recipe with me from now on because someone always asks for it.

Excellent!  Husband, sister-in-law, and I loved it.  It is rich, very filling, and yummy.  Sister-in-law suggests less kahlua, will try 3/4 cup next time. Maybe will try adding nutmeg. Overall, 5 star recipie

This recipe is delicious. The pralines got rock hard quicker than i thought, and for some reason my cake didn't hold up. Too many eggs? Next time, should I make the cake as directed by the white cake mix box instead? I don't know where I messed up there. But all in all, it was very tasty.

This cake is delicious! I made it last weekend for a friend and everyone raved about it! Like a previous reviewer, I used butterscotch liqueor instead of Kahlua and white butter cake mix instead of plain white. The taste is incredible! The icing?! To die for! I liked that I had extra to layer on top (and eat)! You can't go wrong with this one. Thanks Mike and all members who've given great reviews.

I have yet to find anyone who did not love this cake.  I have made it several times.  I have cut back the frosting recipe to 2/3 the original recipe and still have enough for a two layer cake.  I don't do the praline part, but I do put the chopped pecans on the top and sides of the frosted cake.  Adds a nice flavor and touch to the frosting !

I made this as a birthday cake. I thought it was a little sweet, but I was the only one - everyone else loved it. They finished the whole thing between 6 or 7 people!! I used some of the frosting mixed with cocoa as decoration. Worked great. Next time, I might even ice the whole thing with the cocoa flavoured stuff.

Incredibly rich cake without the extra fat and
calories of a cream cheese/pudding/whip topping!
I used homemade Kahlua that's been around for a
long time so don't know how it compares to store
bought but the flavor was definitely strong!  The praline topping is awesome, and a great, flavorful surprise under the frosting (which I made with only 8 oz. Cool Whip and still had way
too much)

I made these for a baby shower I was attending.  I'm chocolate fan myself, but I know not everyone shares my chocolate obsession.  Needless to say, everyone who tried these squares, was in love with them.  They are Fabulous!!  I also like the fact that they have a more grown up taste (its not just kids who like sweets).

The best cake ever!!!. Used a 10” springform  pan and 8 oz cool whip.  Released the cake from the springform when hot and made the praline topping and poured  on the hot cake around the sides too. Cooled,  refrigerated the cake and frosted the day I served with only 8 oz cool whip in the frosting and It worked out great baking a day ahead so only had to make frosting the day of the party.  Everyone had to tell me it was the best cake they ever ate.

2nd review 
This cake is my most requested recipe ever!  I make a ton of desserts and this is FANTASTIC!  No one can guess all the flavors and it is gone in no time because people come back for seconds.

This cake was delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe stated. The next time I make it, I’ll take a couple of the suggestions from other reviewers and just use 8 oz Cool Whip and cut down on the milk to make the frosting a bit more firm.

This was a wonderful recipe.  The only changes I made were to use a Duncan Heinz Butter Golden cake mix, and I used real whipped cream instead of Cool Whip.  (1 cup whipping cream, plus a little powdered sugar)  It was out of this world.  For those who have stated it was not for kids, all I can say is, "WRONG"  All of the alcohol bakes out, and all 9 of my grand kids who were at dinner that day, loved it.  As a matter of fact, one of them requested it for her special birthday dinner tomorrow.  This is keeper!

Awesome cake! I made two 9 inch layers and put pralines and frosting between. I also substituted coffee for the coffee liquor as others suggested. So good. My brother, who rarely eats sweets, had two pieces and wanted more, but it was GONE. I've already been asked to make or again.  :)

I used coffee instead.. and thought it needed a little more coffee flavoring.  And waay too much icing!  But a great cake!

This recipe was excellent, but I preferred some modifications. First of all, I don't think the second time around I would use the icing--the praline topping was enough and I found the icing to be a little salty (perhaps b/c of the cream cheese?)--not worth it. I made a regualar dream whip cake since I wasn't sure if my guests (in-laws) would like coffee flavored cake. The praline mixture was great, but a little to thick on my 9" round cake. Next time, I will just ice the whole cake with the pralines. Another reason for this is that the praline topping gets very hard when refrigerated, but the icing needs to be refrigerated because of the dairy products. Just my thoughts...still a great recipe.
