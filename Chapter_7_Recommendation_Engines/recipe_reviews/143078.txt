For such an easy recipe, this was delicious! I doubled the amount of cheese and added a handful of peas, as cookinme suggested. I truly enjoyed it, as did my 57 year old kid.
Thanks, NormaJean! :)

This is great quick lunch.  I made it today for my boys and they loved it.  Made it with whole wheat pasta.  Might even add some fresh peas next time....a definite kid-pleaser!  Thanks Norma~Jean....I am sure I will be making this again.

Wow "Sinsgirl", your pic is so pretty that I'm almost sorry I didn't use that type of pasta. I made this with orzo pasta, used the "healthy" C of M soup and added my usual garlic and onion powders. Served this as a side, but I could see chicken added in to make a complete meal. Hubs and kids loved it! Thanks NormaJean!

I didn't like this. It was very bland. I added more cheese but that made it too rich with the soup. My husband didn't like it either. Sorry.

I've been looking for dishes that are easy to make and reheat well to take to work for lunch.  I'm sick of fast food and sandwiches. I did add extra liquid since pasta absorbs liquid and I didn't want it dry when reheated, I also added a handful of frozen peas and carrots to add more veggies to my diet.  After taste testing it I was hard pressed not to eat it after it was cooked.  This heated up well in the microwave for lunch.  Yummy!  Thanks for the post.

I made this for a quick lunch before work, and it was quite tasty. I didn't measure the milk and cheese though, being in a hurry I just eyeballed it, but it was fine. Next time I think I'll add a bit more cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

I added some garlic powder, and a little salt and pepper because my cream of chicken was low sodium.  Loved it, Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy, definitely kid friendly. This doubles as a bit of a macaroni and cheese, just with bowties. I doubled the amount of cream and chicken soup that it called for, and it still turned out okay. Slightly bland though, so try grating some really sharp cheese over the top, and spice up with salt and pepper.

My whole family LOVED this!  We made some changes, based on what we had on hand and tripled the recipe for our family of 6.  We used 1 can cream of mushroom soup and 2 of cream of chicken since that's what we had on hand, and added a bit of water in addition to the milk.  Also added some grilled chicken, substituted linguine for the farfalle, and added significantly more cheese (probably 2 cups, melted into the sauce.)  Next time I will add fresh broccoli!  My picky kids devoured it.  Will definitely make again.

Super simple and quick meal! I use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. It makes it creamier and tastes better (to us!)

I did as others suggested and used more liquid, I actually added half and half I also used some diced left over cut up pork, diced garlic peas and carrots.  I'm still looking for healthier foods here but at least they like this for lunch though its not a gourmet meal I would hope that no one on this food forum would think any recipe would be with canned soup.  And they do like it better than TV dinners ick those are awful.  This makes a nice lunch for them, thank you.

My boys ate this so I gave it 5 stars.  The flavor was a bit too bland for me (but I like spicy food and this is geared toward kids).

Tasted like a meal that came out of a microwaved TV dinner. Would absolutely not make again and do not recommend it.

This is so easy, quick and easy to customize! I did make a few additions, peas, parsley, extra cheese, and since I used all 12 oz pasta, I used 2 cans of soup and 1/2 cup of milk. My fussy boys loved it. I think I will add chicken to it next time. Thanks for recipe!

Can't get much easier. I made this to go with cheddarwurst and broccoli for dinner.  The kids loved it. I thought it needed a little spicing up so I may add a some seaoning next time. Great recipe for a busy night!

This recipe is a great start. Like other reviewers I felt it needed a little help. I cooked chicken in better than chicken bouillon (1tsp), garlic, and evoo. Diced chicken.
 To the sauce I added 1 can diced tomatoes, (1tsp) better than chicken bouillon, large can (family size) cream of chicken soup, 1 c milk. 4 leaves fresh basil, sprig fresh thyme, and a little bit of fresh Rosemary. Simmered 5 min. Added 1c parmesan cheese, 1 c cheddar. Then blended sauce in blender (to hide tomatoes and herbs from picky kidos) ;) returned to pan added pasta (16 oz) and chicken. Viola they loved it! Adults add hot sauce yummo!!

I realized while making this recipe that I had no cream of chicken soup, so I just used cream of mushroom.  It was really good!  Went over well with my 14 year old and with my 15 month old both.  Thanks for the quick and easy lunch recipe.  Update:  I just made this as written (with the cream of chicken soup) and my family didn't like it (like another reviewer mentioned, tasted like a TV dinner).  I will stick to making it with mushroom soup.

This is a great base/starter recipe that you can customize to you, or your picky eater's taste. We added broccoli and red pepper with garlic powder and salt and pepper, oh and a little parm at the end. Thanks for a quick and easy start to my supper.

I tried this in my adult day care for lunch for them and they all loved it, and trust me some of these people are fussy on what they eat..
I didn't add the cream soup because of the msg in it, I just added a wee bit of rice milk..I made it a second time and added some garlic and onion powder and a touch of pepper, turned out quite good, didn't lose too much of the original recipe..

I hate to rain on the parade, but our family did not like this. I threw it together on a busy night, because I had all the ingredients- but it just tasted like cream of chicken soup...pretty bland, and my kids said it tasted like tuna noodle casserole (and they hate tuna...). I won't be making this again :\

Easy recipe. I used tri-colored rotini pasta, added some smoked sausage and mozzarella cheese. Tasted great and the good thing about it, it was all in one pot! Thanks for the recipe.

We called this Shark bait pasta (like in Finding Nemo) and it was a huge hit!!! I doubled the recipe and added some pepper/garlic powder/salt. The kids loved it for dinner and each had 3 helpings for lunch the next day!

This pasta was pretty good, although I didn't get as much sauce as I was hoping for. I would suggest adding more milk and less noodles.

Very quick and easy! I added chicken, broccoli and mushrooms to the original recipe to make it more of an "adult"  pasta. The whole family loved it.

This is my ABSOLUTE "go to recipe" for when I need a delicious and QUICK dinner to serve my family! I DOUBLE THE SAUCE RECIPE.

Wonderful! I added some thawed peas and carrots and MY SON DEVOURED IT!!!! So did the Husband. WIN!

Tried it a simpler way by only adding 2 tbsp of chicken & poultry rub (bought at Sam's Club ). EVEN MORE DELICIOUS! 

I have yet to find a way to tweak this recipe in a way that it DOESN'T come out delicious and family friendly.
