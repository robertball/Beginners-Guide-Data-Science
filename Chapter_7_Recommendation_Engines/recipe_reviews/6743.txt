Very good recipe!  I used all milk, no water.  Delicious!  I made a second batch with all soy milk and it was equally as good.  Same recipe found on the  Fleischmann's Yeast packets.  I cut the flour to 4 cups for a batter - not a dough.  This resulted in a more traditional "holey" crumb.

These loaves really are "just like English muffins."  In my opinion, toasting definitely is required, the same as you would with regular English muffins.  The flavor is enhanced by light toasting.

i had no cormeal on hand so i greased and floured the pans, bread didn't stick, but the cormeal adds to the overall texture.  i also used my electric stand mixer with the dough hook and over handled the dough a bit to much, thus not getting the great little nooks and crannies that make it so good.  this reciped is a good recipe, i just goofed it by getting in a hurry.

For you bread machine lovers, I halved the recipe, put the ingredients in my bread maker according to the direction, (liquid first, then flour, etc., with yeast last), turned the bread maker on "dough" setting and let it mix for 10 minutes.  Took the dough out, put it in a bread pan, let it rise, then popped it in the oven.  Turned out great and with a lot less work mixing the ingredients together.

I love english muffin toasting bread.  As a previous review mentioned, it can get pretty expensive.  You definitely need to toast it to get the full flavor.  I've made this many times.  Make sure that it is more of a batter and not a dough.  My only complaint is that it always collapsed.  instead of the usual bread shape, it ended looking like a brick.  other than that.  It tastes great.

Outstanding recipe. I found adding an extra 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tbls of sugar boosted the flavor immensely. I agree that decreasing the flour to make the dough more batter like allows those lovely bubbles to develop. Love this bread.

I don't know if I messed up this recipe or not, but it seemed awfully doughy.  Probably won't make it again.

I've been making this recipe for over 20 years.  I got it from Bon Appetit Breads cookbook.  It was meant for baking in a microwave oven.  I've always used a conventional oven.  I've replaced one or 2 of the cups of flour with whole wheat...works great and adds a little more flavor.  Try it!  My family is crazy for this bread with or without the ww flour.  You can also use some barley flour for more flavor.

Cut this in half, using 2 cups of flour, 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of water and the whole tablespoon of sugar.  Used half whole grain flour and whole wheat pastry flour with great success.  Made in my round coffee can shaped bread pan.  The outside was deliciously crusty.  Used half the loaf for french toast, which was yummy.  Thanks for sharing!  Update: this time made with buttermilk, omitting the salt, and half
 whole wheat/half unbleached white four.  Even better and better texture too!

This was very yummy. For those complaining it was tasteless, you need to remember it's english muffin bread...it has very little flavor when untoasted and without butter or jam. You have to get it hot and toasted to be good!

Very easy and tastey - the bread was a bit too dense, and didn't get as holey as I was hoping.

Even though I made this with 2 cups of whole wheat flour, I think these loaves should have risen higher and have more of that open crumb that English muffins are supposed to have. Still, they tasted good.

I've made this recipe a dozen or more
times and think it's the "cat's meow"!
I've taken it to work and it is always
gobbled up. Have never had so many
compliments about such a great recipe!
It even makes a great sandwich if you
toast it.  Try making toasted cheese with it - Yummy!

Tastes great!  I made this on a VERY hot day- it rose in no time.  Even to the point of overflowing one of my bread pans.  I used a generous measure on the yeast, and no more than 5 cups of flour.  The dough was very wet and sticky, but the end result was a loaf full of "nooks and crannys".  Delicious toasted with butter!

This was delicious! I made 1/2 recipe or (1 loaf) to try it out. I ended up letting it rise for 1 full hour instead of 45 minutes, because it didn't seem to be rising quickly. The bread was quick to make, had a dense but soft interior and a nice crunch from the cornmeal. The bread does harden up a bit after it cools, but I will probably just toast it or microwave a piece. Thank you submitter.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I took the advice of someone who said make it more battery than doughy, and used 5 c. flour.  It wasn't too crispy this way.  Then tried 5.5 c. flour and it was doughy.  However, the liquid *may* have been too cool so I might try that level of flour again.  From reading other reviews, I think 6 c. must be too much.  Either way, I still liked it.  I've made English muffins and I think they're still better than the bread, but it was still very good. I did several things with it, toasted and not.  Even with spam.  Egg & cheese sounded good (since I like that on English muffins), but never tried it.  But mostly I just used butter.  I would ask one favor: PLEASE list the ingredients in order of use.  This makes me crazy.

This is great. Not as nook and crannyey as regualr english muffins but the taste is spot on. Nice and quick but the stirring gives you a workout. Rose nicely and tastes amazing with some apple butter. Even my husband likes it and he is not a huge fan of english muffins.

Made several times. Only problem ever was when my yeast wasn't strong. Yeast doesn't necessarily last as long as the date on the package would indicate. And there are, in your kitchen, things that will kill yeast -- like the merest trace of any sort of sanitizer product. It's always a good practice to start yeast with a bit of warm liquid -- 110 to 120 degrees is ideal. Or just remember "bottle temp", like a few drops on your wrist from a baby bottle. Most bread recipes start the yeast. This recipe can be done that way, too,

Very good.  We tried it first with Eggs Benedict and really liked the bread.  Now we use this same recipe (cut in half but with 3 1/2 tsp of yeast) for bread bowls & pepperoni bread.

It was ok, but I had a couple of problems with it.  I added the active dry yeast to the flour, as stated in the recipe & it didn't soften or dissolve, so that the resulting bread tastes somewhat yeasty and didn't rise very well.  Maybe instant yeast is in order. Also, 6 cups of flour was WAY too much.  After 5c, I had a sticky dough, not a stiff batter.  I ended up adding the extra cup, and kneaded in about 1/2 of it.  The resulting bread, while tasting good, was not at all like an English Muffin.  If I try it again, I'll definitely stop after 4 cups of flour and see if the results are closer to the real thing.

I use 3 cups of white whole wheat flour and 3 cups of bread flour. I get a little fiber into my family without them even guessing! I make this nearly weekly. Great recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I live where I cannot get English without going to a special store and paying an arm and a leg for 4 muffins.  This loaf recipe is perfect.  I spent way less to make this recipe than it would cost me for just the 4 muffins.  The only thing I did differently was to dust the top with cornmeal too!

Very easy, simple ingredients. I used whole wheat flour and it came out perfect.

My husband and I have been trying to keep our foods simple, i.e. no artificial ingredients and preservatives. As we both love to bake from scratch and also LOVE English muffins (all natural and organic are very expensive!) we have been baking this bread and our children and grandchildren love it. The simplicity of this recipe (no kneading, yes!) is the answer to our quest. Experimenting with raisins, cranberries and cinnamon is next. Will keep you posted. Lady G

I made it with my new Kitchenaid stand mixer.  It was easy and good the next day toasted.  I stored it in the refrigerator after it cooled, wrapped in tinfoil.  Certainly, I would prefer to make my own bread than purchase it.  It is way more economical.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  I don't understand why there was one rise with regular yeast.  I might as well have used the quick rise yeast.  I'd try it with half whole wheat flour to see the results and two rises as long as I have time and update.

Mmm! At first I thought, "What? No kneading, no waiting for the yeast to bubble, no bread flour?" like other bread recipes. But this came out just right. Soooo much better than store-bought English muffins, which are---compared to making this easy and delicious recipe---$$$. Will make again and again! (Take that, Thomas'!!) :)

Love this!  As others suggested I used 1 C WW flour and about 3 C unbleached white flour plus 1/2 t extra salt.   I also added the yeast to the warm milk (all milk, 1 1/2 C) instead of putting the yeast in with the flour.  No major changes, just a matter of personal preference .  Simply delicious, and so much less expensive and tastier than English Muffin Bread at the grocery or bakery....Thanks for sharing.

I have been making this bread for over 20 years! I first got the recipe from a friend. I have taken it to school potlucks and give it for gifts at Christmas with a jar of homemade jam. People always love this bread...it is the best. The cornmeal gives it a nice crunch and it works even better for toast. 
As soon as I take it out of the oven I drizzle butter over the top. The only problem with the bread is that it disappears quickly! :)

I only used 4 1/4 cups flour. I think I may have let this rise a little too much as there was a large air bubble under the top crust; however, the rest of the loaf had nice air bubbles in it. The flavor is excellent! Toasted is best!

this was a total failure! i followed the recipe to a T, and it didn't come out like it was supposed to at ALL. i'm still not sure what i did wrong. maybe there was something wrong with my yeast? i'm glad that i only made one loaf, so i didn't waste a lot of ingredients. i def won't be making this again and will be deleting it from my recipe box. i think this is the first time i made something on allrecipes that completely bombed.

I decided to follow one of the reviews.
I used milk for the liquid and reduced flour to 1 cup of wheat flour and 3 cups of white flour. Toasted and ate with honey butter. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great! I mixed it completely by hand and did not use the full amount of flour. The finished product had a light texture and all the nooks and crannies of store bought English muffins.

Tastes like English muffins except not as dry. The review by TMO suggested making it more like batter then complained about dropping in the middle. Batter sinks and dough rises; make dough and it will rise in the middle. DANIELLE BEATTY said it was too doughy. I had to bake mine a few extra minutes as mine was still  doughy in the middle at the end of 25 minutes. I will make again!

I was very pleased with how this turned out. I wanted to make eggs benedict for breakfast the next morning and found this recipe late last night. I did not have any regular milk on hand so used 1 cup of milk from powdered and 1 cup of buttermilk. Made 2 good sized loaves. Very easy to mix together. My husband was really impressed with the eggs benedict this morning, I had some left over hollendase sauce and just added a little cream to it to thin and diced up some left over ham, toasted the bread and poached eggs and we had an excellent meal!  When slicing the bread, I found it easier to slice if I turned it upside down.

Linda, thank you so much for sharing this recipe! This bread is absolutely wonderful. I am finishing my first piece right now, fresh from the oven and buttered, and it is so unbelievably good! It really does taste like english muffins, and it was super easy to make, even though this was my first time making bread! Thanks again for the great recipe.

Great and easy recipe. Like the others, I made the dough a little "wet." I do that with a lot of doughs. It makes for a lighter bread in my opinion. I followed the recipe to the letter otherwise.

WOW!  I love English muffins, but $4/sleeve is getting too expensive.  I used the recipe exactly and followed the directions for mixing using the bread maker (thanks JJ).  At 7 minutes on the dough cycle the batter was ready to be transferred to the baking pan.  The rise time (45 min) is spot on.  I reduced the oven temp to 375 and bake time to 20 minutes because I have a temperamental convection oven...  I cheated and cut into the loaf before it was fully cooled - it is wonderful!  I can hardly wait until it's ready to toast...

Just made it today.. WOW! absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe but also took advice from the others who made this.. I decreased the flour to 5 cups.. instead of water.. 2 /12 cups of milk... instead of 1/4 tsp of baking soda.. I did a 1/2 tsp... and I added 2 tbsp of melted butter to the milk.... I got a perfect English muffin consistency.. with all the nook and crannies.. I loved the fact no kneading involved... baked it at 400 for exactly 25 minutes.... definitely making this again!!!

I halved the recipe for one loaf., using 2.5 cups of flour.
I used 2 cups of unbleached organic all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup of organic whole wheat flour. This amount gave me the "nooks and crannies".  I also used 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of sugar. This bread toasted beautifully.  Simple and delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

I love this recipe. I always add a drizzle of evoo to all my breads when mixing. I think it makes them fluffier. And I sprayed a bit of butter on the top to add a bit of crust to make it more slice-able.

Really didn't rise, and is very dense. Used only 4 1/2 cups flour, and it was very much like a bread dough. No bubbly holes, disappointed.

halved to make 1 loaf. used a little over 2 1/2 cups flour.  made better than average toast. then, and epiphany.  FORK SPLIT ENGLISH MUFFINS.  cut with a fork! tastes just like an English muffin. also, all bread is done if temp is 190° I would take this out right before golden brown. it is way, way better toasted. and my crust started to burn in the toaster.  nest time I am putting 1/2 cup sourdough starter.

Wow!!! This turned out amazing! I took the advice of another reviewer and 1/2’d the recipe and used my bread machine to make the dough. I used the entire dough setting 1 1/2 hr time and it still turned out delicious! This one definitely is a favorite!

I used to make this a million years ago and somehow had lost the recipe.  Still excellent and husband is really grateful.  Thank you for sharing.

I did what some other reviewers did and cut back on the flour by 1 C and added a touch more sugar and salt.  Delicious, even at high altitude!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe. Actually this is my second time to make it. I like to slice a piece off just after it comes out of the oven and spread some butter atop of it and enjoy. My family loves this recipe.

This on'es a keeper.  Very much like english muffins you buy in the store, only better.  I only incorporated 5 cups of flour and the batter was perfect.  This will definitely be made often in my house.  Thanks for the great recipe.
