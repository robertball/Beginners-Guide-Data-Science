I make a very similar recipe to this but I add cream cheese to this mixture which gives it a creamy texture.  To me, without the cream cheese the stuffing is too dry.

I've made these for years but I thought I'd try something different.  The onions, garlic and bread crumbs intrigued me as an alternative to what I usually do.  I thought cooking the sausage ahead of time and then adding  bread crumbs would make these dry so I took a pass on cooking the sausage in advance.  In spite of that they  still turned out dry.

A few things I did differently. 1). I used 1/2 pound of bacon cut very small than fried in cast iron skillet. Remove the bacon but not the fat. 2). Cook the sausage in the same pan and remove. 3). Cook the onions until translucent then add the garlic and cook until aroma is released. Make sure you scrap the bits from the pan. 

4). Return meat and season with basil, oregano, crushed red pepper, salt, and pepper. 5). Mix in bread crumbs, cheese, etc. 6)   Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil in the bottom of each cal then brush the exterior with same oil. 7). Fill caps then brush tops with oil. 8). Add remaining cheese to the top of the caps and bake. 9). For a slightly crunchy texture broil them for 2 minuets at the end.

Great recipe, using a food processor on sausage/ onion mixture  for easier stuffing works great.  I also used 1/2 cup mozzarella instead of parmesan, just added parmesan on top with drizzled butter. And used mild sausage and dried parsley, they were a big hit.

I substituted the parmesan cheese with mozzarella which made the stuffing really creamy.

I made these for a Thanksgiving appetizer and an 80th birthday party and now I was asked for the recipe for a wedding.  My only suggestion is to choose mushrooms small enough to be one or two bites because anything larger gets messy when eating them.

These were amazing and highly addictive. I made these for a party were some attending (including me) have various levels of lactose intolerance. This recipe had the least and most easily substitutable dairy ingredients. I doubled the recipe and used one pound hot and one pound sweet Italian sausage and subbed half the parm (we can have this in moderation) for some lactose free yogurt cheese (from Trader Joe's similar in flavor and texture to jack cheese). My only other change was to use dried parsley instead of fresh, because that is what I had.

These were pretty good with a few minor changes.  I omitted onion, added extra tsp crushed garlic and added 8 oz shredded mozzarella cheese (4oz mixed in stuffing mix and sprinkled remaining on top).  I also used sage sausage instead of hot sausage and a little olive oil to stuffing mixture because it seemed way too dry without.

It's important to add the stems of the mushroom and the mushroom bits (from hollowing the mushrooms out).  Very finely chop these into small bits and add in. This keeps mushroom stuffing from drying out because mushrooms have a lot of moisture. I have never precooked the mixture.  I have frozen these after being baked(cool completely before freezing) and at a later time microwaved after being thawed. They were excellent. Made these for years.

I decided to add this to my Christmas dinner because my husband loves mushrooms. I was surprised that it was a favorite to all! The stuffed mushrooms were delicious and so easy to make that I know I'll be regularly adding these to my menu.

As pointed out in several of the comments posted for this recipe, it has a propensity to dry out.
I decided to stage the sausage mixture per the recipe and add 6oz of feta and finely chopped Kalamata olives and the mushroom stems. They turned out moist but not soggy, and browned on the top. Perfect !

I used Bev's bites sausage meatballs (Cavicchi's Meats) a local meat store here in Nova Scotia!   I just had to mash them up while they cooked.  Used regular bread crumbs and added a little Italian spices.  Added a couple spoonfuls of whipped cream cheese to help it stick together.. I also just used kraft Parmesan cheese as it was what I had on hand.  
These were so good, even my pickiest eater liked them.  Good to eat cold the next day too.

A little too much sausage... usually we make no sausage and that is bland - this is just too mucn.  We need to find one with just a bit of sausage. BUT we are going to use the leftover stuffing in our scrambled eggs tomorrow!

Quick ad easy! I used dried parsley because that all I had on quick notice. I added some hot pepper flakes, which add a hint of heat, and some extra garlic (soooo good!). I also transferred the meat/onion/parsley/garlic mixture to a bowl after cooking & draining it, and hand mixing I. The bread crumbs and cheese. This helped me judge how moist the mixture was. 

They turned out perfect!!' And not dry at all! Next time I think I might try it with Mozzarella like others have suggested. That sound like a tasty twist

I doubled this batch and did a 50/50 mix f regular and hot Italian sausage.  I changed the cheese to an Asiago/Parmesan mix which worked well.  This appetizer was a huge hit at the party I brought it to.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

SO yummy!!!!  I made a few changes, I nixed the parsley and added a few handfuls of baby spinach instead and drizzled a little bit of balsamic vinegar right before topping the caps with remaining cheese for the last minute of cooking.  I can't wait to make these again!  Thinking of trying out a few different sausages for the filling next time, maybe a smoked turkey version
