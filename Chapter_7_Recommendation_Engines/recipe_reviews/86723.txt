Maybe on a cheaper cut of meat this would be helpful, but I have found summarily now that I prefer my good, tender, flavorful cuts with a much lighter, less overpowering marinade.  Thanks though! Oh, and I only marinaded for a bit over 2 hrs.  WAAAAAAY to much for a ribeye!  I feel like I ruined a really expensive cut of meat.

This is my recipe and believe me it is good. I forgot to put that you need to use a low-sodium soy sauce because otherwise it will be too salty. Also try a teriyaki sauce which I have also used. Either way they come out great and moist.

Way too much soy sauce for our taste.

Used regular sodium soy sauce and added black pepper. Marinated for six hours in the refrigerator. My steaks were very thick and big (from Sam's Club) so I would only marinate that long with regular soy sauce if you have the big steaks, anything smaller might make the meat salty. Also, I didn't measure the soy sauce and just eyeballed what I thought was an appropriate amount.

This did nothing for us.  I halved the recipe for a 10oz strip steak, marinating for 24 hours.

I have used a variation of this recipe for years, but I use only half a cup of soy sauce and half a cup of water. It cuts the strong salty taste of the soy sauce and lets the garlic flavor come through better. I also add freshly ground pepper to taste. Yummy! :)

Very easy, and it is good for tenderizing I cut the recipe in half and definitely use low sodium soy sauce. I added in some Montreal Steak Seasoning and a little olive oil.  I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it go for a couple of hours. I brought the steaks to room temp before grilling and overall, pretty good.

This is a good recipe, but it can be overpowering if you marinade too long or full strength.  You can add water.  I put olive oil and white vinegar in.  Good stuff!

These steaks turn out great and very tender. My husband is VERY picky about his steaks and can't stand fat on his meat at all, yet with these, he cleared every bit of steak from his plate and wanted more! (A huge feat!)  Personally I found them a touch salty from the soy sauce but I'm weird that way anyway and there's always A-1, lol! Thank you for this recipe!

I used the low sodium soy. I followed this recipe to a T and I only had one steak!  Best steak I every ate!  I love a fatty steak, I trim nothing.  I ate it all.

Thanks Marikabar for the tip on low sodium soy.  I made this recipe for Sunday Dinner and it was a real success!  The steaks were tender, juicy, and flavorfull. I'll never just grill my steaks again.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  I dont think it needs to marinate more than one hour though it probably will make it too salty.  One hour was perfect for my family.  Thanks for sharing

I've been using this recipe for years,but instead of soy sauce I use
Dale's Steak Sauce which is a seasoned soy sauce.One bit of advise to the use of soy sauce or even Dale's for that matter is you have to cut the sauce with water to about 60% soy, 40% water,otherwise it's too salty. Also I'll dribble on some Dale's sause just before I remove the steak from the grill.Enjoy.

Very good!  We only left the meat in the marinade for about 35 minutes because I was hungry!  I'm not a huge meat eater, but I polished off this rib-eye with no trouble.  My fiance loved the steaks too.  His only complaint was that I finished mine.  He's used to me not liking steak, so he usually gets at least 1/2 of it.

Tried this one today for 15. Adjusted the ingredients with the new amount. Used about a teaspoon and another half teaspoon instead of the cloves which is equivalent to 1/15 of cloves. Turned out perfect. 7 min on each side and cooked it on a griddle on the ribbed side. Had nice steak lines that way. Enjoyed by all!

Was very good look forward to letting steaks marinade for longer than 1 hr concerned overnight might make the meat to salty.

I put a few tablespoons lite soy sauce over my ribe yes for about 30 min. before grilling. That was plenty and it was good. I did not have garlic so sprinkled a little garlic powder over them.  It was good.

We've enjoyed using low-sodium soy sauce with a hint of garlic as a marinade for years.  We often skip the garlic and just use the low-sodium soy sauce for a marinade.
