Baking a cake at a ridiculously low temperature (traditionally it's 350 degrees), then putting a hot cake right out of the oven into the freezer?  What? I was tempted to simply bake this in the traditional manner, 350 degrees until done, then let cool on a wire rack. But I noticed the submitter's review, and she was so adamant about the unconventional baking temperature and cooling method that I thought to be fair to her I'd give it a try (especially since it was the rare occasion where I had enough room in the freezer for it). Well let me tell you, I don't know if the cake would have turned out any differently had I baked it in the traditional manner, but this was one, outstanding banana cake! To tell you the truth, I was surprised. It is not uncommon for these types of cakes to be dry or not to be baked through. But this one has a soft outer crust, not overly browned, and a moist, tender interior.  It was fun to give this unusual set of directions a try and I'm glad I did. Other than make a half recipe in an 8x8" pan and adjusting the baking time accordingly, I followed the directions exactly and was not disappointed.  Now that I've had the first piece I can't wait to share it! The added perk was that because the cake is cooled in the freezer, you can bake and serve this in no time! The frosting is a tried and true cream cheese frosting, and topped with a sprinkle of finely chopped nuts, this was just a simply delicious and beautiful cake.

This is my recipe, the temperature is not a mistake in the directions. It is to bake at a slow rate to keep the cake moist. This recipe has been made by tons of friends of mine over and over, not one of them has had a problem with the directions, temperature, or the ingredients.   Check your oven temperature with a thermometer, also use the correct size pan. It all makes a difference!!!  Pyrex pans are freezer to oven...their claim to fame when first on the market...that dates me, I guess.

To anyone reading this, do not hesitate to make this cake.  I think the cooking temperature and placing it in the freezer after baking is what makes this cake outstanding.  I myself made a couple of changes. 1.) I did not have buttermilk, so I used regular milk and added 1.5 tablespoons of vinegar to make it comparable to buttermilk. 2.) I had 4 large bananas so I used all of them, (I did not use lemon juice) 3) I used 2 cups of white sugar and 1/4c of brown sugar 4) I used about another additional tablespoon of vanilla. 5) I had to bake it a LOT, LOT longer than the recipe calls for. Every oven is different, so just keep checking it and don't rush it. 6. I only used 2 cups of conf. sugar in the icing.  Just add the sugar by the cup and check taste after every one and stop adding it when the flavor is the way you like it.
It is worth the extra time.  I know I could have won a cake cook-off with this one.

This is my first banana cake and I followed the recipe exactly.  Boy am I glad I did!  This is so moist and delicious!!!!  I topped it with 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts which is the only thing I would add.  I was a bit skeptical about cooking a cake at 275 and then putting it in the freezer.  I never heard of such a thing.  Please follow the directions, you'll be glad you did. For me it took 1 hour and 10 minutes until the toothpick came out clean.  Maybe that's where people are having trouble - taking the cake out of the oven before it's done and then putting it in the freezer.  I made the icing while the cake was cooling in the freezer. I topped it with the icing and nuts and then stuck it in the refrigerator to have after dinner. I will definitely make this again!

A WOW!!! cake - brilliantly easy and simply scrumptious! At this time of posting, it is hardpressed to keep the remaining half for dear hubby when he gets home later, lol; the children - who vehemently declared not liking banana cake, groaned and moaned their pleasure and this will now be THE banana cake recipe with us. The changes after reading all the reviews (thank you to all) are: decreased the sugar to 1 cup using (packed) brown sugar, increased bananas to 1 3/4 cups, used self-raising flour with 1 teaspoon baking powder, omitted the salt, doubled the vanilla and baked it for 40 minutes at 325 degrees. Tried freezing but 10 minutes only just to cool it down quick smart; the cake is moist even without freezing it for the stated time ... I have the proof ;) so to 'speak', lol. And I sprinkled a bit of chocolate rice on one side, left the middle plain and chopped pecans on the last 'division' ... and served the cake with  homemade caramel sauce. With the decreased amount of sugar, this is just right. We loved the plain or with pecans, but not chocolate rice, maybe either some cocoa powder or melted chocolate would be better. Kept the cream cheese frosting for my carrot cake. Thanks to both Cindy and her friend who shared the recipe with us here. Good one.

I always make a recipe the first time without any changes. This was "country good", however this is more like a light banana bread in texture than that of cake, REAL HEAVY. By the second day we scraped the frosting off and just ate the cake. As with all cakes I bake 300 degrees seems to make a more tender cake. This batter goes from jiggly center to done quickly and may need more oven time than the recipe called for.

I have made this recipe many times and it is wonderful.  Frost with a homemade caramel frosting and it is out of this world.
Frosting:
1/3 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
Combine butter, milk and brown sugar.  Cook over medium heat for a few minutes after mixture begins to boil.  Beat in powdered sugar and vanilla.  Pour over cake.

I didn't think that a better recipe existed besides my grandmother's, but boy was I wrong!  This banana cake was unbelievable.  I took it to a family dinner and got rave reviews.  Was told that this is the best banana cake ever had by one guest and my grandfather said he would even eat it without the icing!  I followed the recipe pretty closely although I did take other's advice and bake for about 45 minutes on 325.  Threw it straight in the freezer for 45 minutes afterwards.  Delicious icing- even my husband, a serious icing critic, loved this!  Plenty of icing left that I put in the freezer for maybe cinnamon rolls one morning.  Excellent dessert Cindy and thank you for sharing this with us all!

I think the baking temp should be 375 instead of 275 as listed here.  After 1 hour at 275 it was not even close to being done.

I took a detour and baked this in cupcakes instead of a 9x13 pan. I filled 30 cupcakes and baked at 300 degrees for 35 minutes. I stuck these in a freezer for 30 minutes. I made the cream cheese frosting, spread it on the cupcakes, and topped it all with a sprinkle of chopped walnuts. The results were thirty beautiful and delicious cupcakes! All of the cupcakes formed an even round top with a nice light color, not dark brown. This is a truly moist, banana-y cupcake! The texture of the cake is light, tender and very tasty. The frosting is creamy and not overly sweet. It is the perfect amount of frosting to cover this cake. From the beginning to the end I had no problems. And thou I baked this in cupcake form I still used a lower temperature baking method. I can't wait to show these off tonight!!

This is very flavorful, not too light and not too dense. Perfect sweetness. I really appreciate recipes that call for a measured amount of mashed bananas rather than leaving me to guess what  "medium banana" means. I have a double oven so, just for fun, I baked half of the cake as directed and half at 350 degrees and let cool on the counter. There were 6 people testing and we found no discernible difference between the two at all.  No need to clean out your freezer to make this. Either way- it's delicious.

The cake is just OK. The cooking time was 30 plus minutes off. The cake was too sweet, heavy,and not quite what I expect out of a cake. I like trying new recipes, so I am glad I tried it, but it is the end of the road for this one. I will find another recipe to use up bananas in the future.

This cake is excellent! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it took a lot longer than 1 hour to bake - but maybe it's because of my oven. As far as final taste and texture it is definitely a 5 star recipe! Anyway it was moist and very light. I am not sure why some reviewers are comparing it to banana bread and saying it was heavy. I have made this 2X and both times it came out very light! I added an little extra banana and I mixed it with a stand up mixer - fabulous! We didn't even have time to frost it - it was gone within minutes of coming out of the freezer!

Had a few bananas left over that had ripened; so I decided to bake a banana cake.  Unfortunately, I didn't have a recipe for it.  So I went to the web/search engine and found this site.  I wanted the easiest and quickest recipe and found this one.  And I must say that this is the best, moist, and tastiest banana cake recipe I've ever tasted! 
 
I was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to wait for the butter to soften, so I used three quarter cup of 'Crisco Butter Flavored Vegetable Shortening' with 6 tsp. water (which also help eliminate the need to put the cake in the freezer to stay moist).

I used this recipe to make banana cupcakes using paper muffin cups and a (1 dozen count) muffin pan - let bake in oven for 30 to 33 minutes.  

Thanks Cindy Carnes for such a delicious banana cake recipe!

This is my second review of this recipe.  Yummmm!  This time I made cupcakes.  They were delicious.  I halved the recipe and it made 16 regular muffin tin size cup cakes.  You need to fill the wrapper almost to the top because they don't rise as much as regular cake and they are hard to frost if they don't rise above the lip of the wrapper.  cook time was 35 minutes and I put in freezer for 20 minutes (that was perfect). I could frost immediately afterwards.  1/2 the frosting recipe was exactly enough to frost all the cupcakes.  Last tip- I did not have buttermilk this time so I had to substitute - the ratio is 1 tablespoon of lemon juice (or vinegar- but I used the lemon juice) to 1 cup of milk and let it sit for 6 minutes.  The flavor was just as good as with the buttermilk and the cakes were still as moist.  One last thing, this cake is much prettier as cupcakes. Even kids just gobble this cake up.

Moist and tender!  The KEY is in the creaming of the butter and sugar.  I used a stand mixer and creamed for  4-5 minutes.  If using a hand mixer, you just need to mix longer.  The butter/sugar mixture should be very light yellow and airy/fluffy.  If you do this, your cake WILL NOT be dense.  This cake base (minus banana/lemons) can be used for other types of cakes:  blueberry, rasberry...etc.  It is the TECHNIQUE that creates the cake-like, as opposed to break-like, product.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 1/3 cups since my bananas were almost brown.  Baked at 275 for one hour and it was truly DIVINE!!

The temperature listed (275 degrees) would be correct for a convection oven. Convection ovens are 25 degrees hotter than a regular oven. So set the temperature to 300 degrees if you do not have a convection oven!

Also, A simple solution to the cake being too heavy: Use cake flour instead of AP flour. That's all you need to do to this recipe.

This cake was delicious!  I didn't have ingredients on hand to make the frosting - and the cake tastes fine without the frosting.  Also, instead of using buttermilk I used non-fat milk, and the cake came out great, very moist and has a lighter texture than banana bread, heavier texture than cake.  Great cake!

Absolutely fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect even the icing was delicious!  Just a note - 3 medium size bananas came out to 1 1/2 cups.  I did not have buttermilk on hand so I made my own with lemon juice and milk.  There definately is such a taste difference between boxed cake and from scratch cake.  I will definately make this cake again when I need to impress!

WOW!!! Made this cake today for a large family dinner. There were many desserts to choose from, but this one was by far the most popular. I subbed 1/2 brown sugar, for extra flavor. Baked it by the recipe temp and directions, except used 3 9 inch pans and divided batter equally. Had to bake for 35 minutes, and placed immediately in the freezer for 30 minutes.   I used fresh vanilla bean in both the cake and frosting. Also, embellished the frosting by using browned butter and 1/2 oz. of good bourbon. This was an exceptional cake. Super moist and light in texture, for banana cake. I will definitely make this cake again!

This cake is deeelicious!!  Definitely a keeper.  I do think there is something 
wrong with the temp.  After 1 hour at 275 it was still uncooked. I turned the oven
up to 300 & cooked another 20 mins or so.  Next time I think I'll try 325 and
watch closely. I skipped the freezer and can't believe that would make it any more
moist or delicious!!
The frosting is yummy, but, I didn't use it all on the cake. I have
enough left for a light frosting on another cake. Cindy, thanks for sharing your
great recipe!!..

Well, we didn't have freezer space, but we did have space on the deck and this is winter in Minnesota.  Lovely cake - followed the directions as written - thank you Cindy Carnes. You gave us a five star recipe !

This cake ROCKS!! I just made this cake over the weekend and it was gone in less than 2 days. The directions are obviously a little different than traditional cakes, but follow them right and you will be pleased! It will so moist & delicious. I was a little skeptical about the low temp. because I've never baked any cakes lower than 350 degrees. The icing is heaven! Everything aboout this cake is perfect. In fact, my boys want me to make this on their next birthday and every holiday there is. Also, if you don't have any buttermilk, you could use 1 cup regular milk & 1 tbsp. lemon juice or white vinegar. Mix & let it sit at room temp. for 5 mins. I never buy buttermilk because I hardly use it for anything. But, you use as much of the buttermilk substitute as much as you can with this recipe. I learned this trick from a cooking channel.

Incredibly good cake! I made this last night with the following change: My kids like chocolate cake so I added 1/4 cup cocoa powder to the flour mix and 2 Tablespoons cocoa powder to the frosting. YUM! Kids loved it! I didn't tell them it had banana in it even though you can still taste it and even though it IS chocolate cake I feel semi-better letting them eat it since they don't care for fruit. I also am keeping this stored covered in the pan in the fridge. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had been looking for a banana cake recipe that appealed to me.  I found it!!  I made it my own by substituting cake flour for the all-purpose (3 cups minus 6 TBS).  The cake was sooo tender and not to mention moist.  Also, instead of the cream cheese frosting I made a chocolate fudge frosting topped with toasted chopped pecans.  Incredible!!!!

This is so far one of the best cakes I have made and the low tempenture has a reason I found out. If you notice when this cake is done there is no hump in the middle this is because a lower temps a cake cooks more evenly. Most bakery chiefs suggest you lower temp 25 degrees or use a special wrap around your pan to allow cake to cook evenly (this will effect the cook time). Also One suggested change use Cake flour when making cakes and ensure you sift the ingredients. Sifting effects the consistancy of the cake I found out. So much information on cooking I have learned since joining allrecipes and hope to learn much more. Once again great recipe highly recommended.

My wife baked this yesterday.  She added 20 minutes to the baking time but followed everything to the letter.  It is amazing cake and we can't wait to share it with friends.  Moist but not heavy (rose beautifully).

Amazing cake. The cake was perfect.. It was very moist, not too heavy (contrary to what some reviewers said) and the banana taste was perfect, mild and not too overpowerring. The only changes I made were to substitute 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup water for the buttermilk and cool the cake naturally (was worried about the 'fridge, so didn't put the cake in the freezer). Very happy with the result and got a lot of compliments...

I am a professional baker and I baked the cakes at 335 until they sprung up in the center when tested (was making several sizes and forgot to write down the times they took). I do not place them in the freezer when they are done and they are still moist and delicious. I did ONCE bake it at the lower temp and placed the cake in the freezer and there is no difference in the moisture or flavor...

I made this cake today and WOW. I forgot to do the whipping of the butter separate, and I halved the recipe. Other then that, I followed the recipe exactly. Turned out perfect. Moist, excellent flavor, and the light cream cheese flavor was fantastic. I accidentally added about a tablespoon too much butter to the frosting, but it was great. Rave reviews from son and husband. Rejoyce to the submitter and creator of the recipe. A definite keeper. Thank you for sharing this.
***update: just out of curiosity I made the recipe again and baked at a higher temp. BIG mistake. Recipe is perfect as is. Bake at suggested time and temp. Comes out a light color and is moist and fluffy. If you don't follow the steps as directed for mixing ingredients together your cake will be more dense like a banana bread; speaking from experience.

excellent recipe made with the following changes: baked @ 350 for 35 min. - no freezer. Also used soy butter and soy milk with lemon juice in place of butter and buttermilk. Topped with my own recipe for icing(dairy free).  This has been the best recipe for banana cake so far and I have made dozens...soooo moist and flavorful!!!

Very delicious cake. And I definitely thought this was like cake. A number of reviewers have written "it tastes like banana bread" which, of course it will, it's essentially the same ingredients. But the texture is cake, lighter and less dense than banana bread. Very sweet, but good. I was too cowardly to bake it at 275F, I didn't want a failure on my hands, so I cooked it at 325 after a first fearful 15 minutes at 275. And I had no desire to melt everything else in my freezer by putting a hot cake into it, so I just let the cake cool on the counter and it is moist even so. I haven't yet decided if I'll frost it or not.
EDIT- After a day, the texture changes, becomes much more dense.

I was SKEPTICAL.  A banana cake is a banana cake right?  WRONG.  This cake was a huge hit! I ran right out and bought more bananas hoping they would ripen a.s.a.p. My husband was mad cause my kids only saved him a tiny little piece. High Altitude tip.... This cake will sink if you don't decrease the fat by 2 T., decrease the baking powder by 1/4 tsp., and increase the flour by about 1/4 cup.

My buttermilk turned, so I used regular milk.  It came out sweet, moist, and very light.  The only other difference was that I cooked it at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. Next time, I'll try it with buttermilk.  The frosting was a bit on the sweet side.  Too much sugar, more cream cheese.  I made only half the recipe because it was too much.  I might omit the frosting though.  The cake is just as good without it.  Thanks for sharing.

There is no way this only takes one hour to bake at 275 degrees.  I am currently making it.  More like 2 hours.  Hope it tastes good.

I laughed when I read the review from MizzKat because she said EXACTLY what I going to say! I cook and bake a lot and I can't figure out what the big deal is with this cake either.  It was good.  That's it, good. Nothing I would run out and scream from the rooftops that you need to try this cake! I wouldn't even bother making it again.  I wanted to use up some bananas I had and since this recipe had so many 5 star ratings, I thought I would try it.  Just like MizzKat, for the amount of work, I would want something incredible.  This was not.  Next time I have bananas to use up, I'll go back to my delicious, easy recipe for banana nut bread.  Again, just like Mizzkat, I was thinking exactly the same thing.

It's pretty good...but I didn't think it was amazing.
I thought this was a banana flavored cake, but no, it’s actually more like banana bread baked in a cake pan. Expecting a real cake from this recipe, I made this for my son’s third birthday. We did a Curious George theme and my son loves banana’s so I figured this would be perfect. It was too dense and rich for an occasion like this. With the cake being super rich and the frosting being super rich it was just a bit too much. I think if I were to make this for a birthday type occasion again, I would make just a simple sugar frosting rather than the rich cream cheese frosting. Also, as many others have mentioned, the cooking time is off in the directions. I had to bake it for about 20 minutes longer than asked for. Overall, I think this is just a so-so cake. In my opinion, it’s nothing extraordinary.

Do not hesitate to make this cake!!! I made the banana cake for the first time for a memorial and it was seriously gone in 15 minutes! No one would stop raving about how moist and sweet it was. One woman said it was the best cake she ever had, and I would have to agree! Everyone will think you spent hours in the kitchen.. yet it was easy even for a beginner. I did have to cook it a little longer too... just check it real well with a toothpick every 10-15 min or so and it will turn out just fine. And remember: the freezer step is the secret so please don't skip it!!

Very good, similar to a banana bread, it has a fairly heavy texture.  I wanted this cake to work for my son's first birthday and so tried two nine inch round pans despite warnings in prior reviews.  The batter did overflow a bit during baking, and I had to work a bit to get the cakes to release from the pans, but otherwise the round pans worked fine.  Regarding the temperature, I was stumped as to whether I should go with 275 or 375.  I finally went with 275 but had to cook the cakes for an extra 40 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes total!).  Next time I will definitely try a bit higher temp (too long to mess with a cake and then have to do the freezer thing...it doesn't seem like it's worth all the extra trouble in my opinion).  Next time I will probably go 325 and skip the freezer.

I made it just as indicated, did not vary from the instructions one iota.  This is a major challenge for me...usually I'm like, the recipe calls for a 9 x 13, but I think it would be better in a bundt pan!  Why aren't there chocolate chips in this recipe?  I'm gonna add them.  But no...The instructions were so specific, I thought, best to just do what the lady says.  I even did the freezer thing.  Well, can I tell you, this was divine.  The cake itself was lovely and moist, as promised.  And the cream cheese icing (which normally I really don't love) was soooo yummy.)  It had a lot of steps, but was still fairly simple to make and well worth the effort.  This will be my go to banana cake from now on.  Oh...I did toast some walnuts and toss them on top of the cake when finished.  Really, really good.  Dh also gave two enthusiastic thumbs up!

Excellent Banana Cake!  My husband & I both loved it.  I baked it at 375 (not 275) and it turned out fine.  Also, could probably use 1/2 batch of frosting next time.

I made this cake for the first time today. I didn't know what to expect with the unusual baking directions, but I followed the recipe exactly. The baking time in my oven was exactly one hour as stated, toothpick came out clean and then exactly 45 minutes in freezer. I also removed it from the pan with no problem after removing it from the freezer. 
This is amazing cake! It is moist, flavorful, and has a wonderful texture and crumb. There are no spices in this cake like banana bread, it has a nice buttery banana flavor, clean and natural! I made the frosting but didn't frost the entire cake as some in the household don't like frosting. I love this cake just as much without frosting, just a slight dusting of confectioners sugar for appearance is all you need. Excellent Cake!

After having read other reviews, I made a few changes, had the changes been part of the original recipe, this would have easily been a 5 star recipe.  I added 4 tbsps of cornflour/starch to give it a lighter cake like texture and added 2 tsp of vanilla paste for an extra hint of flavour.  For the buttermilk, I used evaoprated milk with 3 tsp of lemon juice(stirred) to make it an equivilent version of milk, making the cake more moist, being able then to eliminate the freezing bit after baking.  Overall, a truely amazing cake! Will make again!

another trick for a moist cake is to wrap it in foil as soon as it comes out of the oven. The next day you have a very moist cake or loaf with no hard edges.

OMG - this is SO good.  DO following the submitters advice and put this directly from oven to freezer.  I could tell when I was mixing this up that it was going to a nice, moist cake.  I actually made 12 cupcakes (baked for about 35 minutes at 275) and (1) 8" round, 3" deep cake that can be cut in half to make a double layer cake.  That one took a bit longer to bake - probably more like 1 hour and half.  I just kept checking it to make sure the center was done (toothpick check).  My daughter and I each ate 2 of the muffins already!  I did not make the frosting.  I instead made a chocolate buttercream frosting.  I love banana cake with a chocolate frosting - but I'm sure the cream cheese frosting would be good too.  Might try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe!  Will upload a picture soon!

I like the final product.  I tested a lot of recipes and this was definitely the best texture.  But I DON'T like the way this recipe is written out.  That lost a star.  1st, quantities don't need to be repeated in the instructions unless they are different than what's in the ingredient list.  I kept second guessing whether I was doing it right or missing something.  Second, it doesn't state whether the cake gets turned out of the pan before or after it goes in the freezer.  To me, that's a pretty important instruction, especially when I'm making this for someone else and I'm under a deadline and don't want to screw it up.  I won't be using the frosting.  I think that could be removed from the recipe or more obviously separated from the actual cake recipe.

I was looking for a 'cakey' banana cake recipe and several of the reviews posted that it was more of a banana bread with frosting, so I just beat it few minutes longer in my kitchenaid mixer and it was so whipped up with air, it came out light and fluffy, perfect!  It had the perfect cake texture and tasted lovely.  THanks for sharing.

Well Cindy Carnes has done it again, submitted another great recipe.  I followed it to the letter and it turned out wonderful.  Everyone at church loved it.  I didn't have any cream cheese but I did have a little bit of vanilla icing and a little dab of chocolate icing in the fridge so I put the vanilla on first then drizzled on the chocolate.  Cindy keep those great recipes coming!!!

This is the best out of all the Banana cake recipes. Except it may be best to reconsider placing the cake "directly into freezer for 45 minutes" I like moist too but not Wet! Also remember to use the recommended 9x13 inch pan. I tryed using a round 9 inch...it didn't work out.

EDIT: I posted my review about 5 years ago.  It is still the best and only banana cake recipe I use.  I do find it usually takes 85 minutes in my oven (perhaps my temp is a bit off) and I always a few shakes of cinnamin to the batter.  I have one in the oven right now... so delicious!
Original review:
I've made this recipe a couple times now - in both cupcake and cake form - and everyone loves it every time!  It's definitely the best banana cake recipe I've ever made or eaten and will be using only this one from now on.

I'm not sure I can add much to the rave reviews on here, but I had to say this is one of the best cakes I have ever made! I've made it dozens of times now & every time someone new tries it, they want the recipe. I tried the cream cheese frosting & it was good, but personally, I prefer buttercream, so that's what I use on top. It helps that it's easy to make, as well. Not only is it my "go to" banana cake, it's usually the cake I make whenever I need something extra good! I bake it as directed (although I have found that baking it at 350 works well, too). Also, I think the freezer part is essential to making it so moist. It truly is scrumptious... thanks Cindy for sharing it with us!

WOW! I just made this recipe yesterday - today IT'S ALL GONE!
I read the other user reviews for tips and decided to cut back on the sugar - a wise decision! I only used 1/2 of the recommended amount and even less for the brown sugar. I also remembered to add Vanilla and I used regular Milk instead of Buttermilk. This recipe is to die for! The Chocolate Chips are a must also!!!
I'm not so keen on Walnuts nor is my family so needless to say they were omitted from the recipe - all in all, a superb recipe that's definately worth a try. I'll never use another Banana Cake Recipe again!

Someone said they used self rising flour and it was NOT to be used etc.. I used self rising flour and omitted the soda and salt and it came out lovely. Also I used more bananas than called for. 2 and 1/4 cups. Everything else I followed to a T basically and the only thing I can say that went 'wrong' was, I had enough batter for a 9X13 pan and 24 cupcakes! How on earth do you fit all the batter in 1 pan and it not rise out all over the bottom of the oven? The batter came to the tip top of my 9X13 pan. It came out moist, airy and delicious. I really think it is important to beat the sugar/butter mixture til it is really light, airy and fluffy. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I would have given 5 stars but I like to leave room for change :) Nothing is perfect! lol

This was a very moist cake, but it was very dense. It was much like a banana bread with frosting. I think it could use some pecans or something. I did put mine in the freezer, but I don't know that it made too much of a difference. I cooked it on 285 for an hour and 20 minutes and it was done. My mom-in-law who loves banana nut bread seemed to love it.

This was really good although it was heavy and I guess I didnt expect that.  It was much more like a bread then a cake.  It took me over 3 hours to bake it although I was using an airbake pan, not sure if that is what made it longer.  it was very moist though and my guests thought it was really good too.

A very good banana cake.  As others have shared...it is a heavier type of cake - but very moist.  I did put it in the freezer for 20 minutes and I'm not sure that was what made it moist?  I cut the sugar to 1-3/4 and it was still sweet!  Frosting is good (just like carrot cake frosting) but next time I will only make half of the recipe - a thin covering of frosting is plenty!  Banana lover's will love this!

this recipe is the best. the only thing  it does need to be cooked longer as stated. 1hour and twenty minutes exactly. adding cinnamon would be a good idea as stated but i forgot. cut the icing back its way too much. other wise its the best banana bread i have ever eaten and i have been cooking  for about fourty years

Couldn't resist giving another rave review. My daughter (14) loves to make this cake. She doesn't change a thing, (except to cook it longer). She's making one right now for our New Years Dinner.
Yummy!!

Great recipe! The cake turned out very soft and moist. Maybe I'll do it again with chopped walnuts mixed in next time. The frosting is too sweet though. 3 cups of confectioners sugar is way too much! I had to adjust with adding more cream cheese. After adjusting, it tasted perfect. Very easy recipe as well.

This is an excellent recipe.  One of the best cakes I have ever made!  It took a lot longer to bake the cake and the given temperature though; I had to add about 20 minutes before the middle baked through.

I'm really disappointed with this recipe. After reading all the reviews I thought I'd be "wowing". The cake turned out good. Moist, good texture etc. - I just don't like the taste. I've had much better. Sorry!

OUTSTANDING Banana Cake!  So moist and full of flavor!  I made the cake just like the recipe except used a half cup less sugar.  For the frosting I used half the amounts of butter & cream cheese and added a tiny bit of milk.  EVERYONE that tasted this cake loved it! OH, and I didn't put it in the freezer and it was still VERY moist!  Thanks Cindy, for a great banana cake...definately a keeper!

The cake was too dry for my liking. The bottom was too "heavy" and tough to chew. It also didn't rise as much as I would like. I made it twice thinking I didn't follow the recipe properly. But both times were equally disappointing.

Such a controversial cake if you read a few of these reviews.   How some people could label this cake as "okay" I have NO idea because this is probably one of the top three cakes (including professionally made ones) that I have EVER had in my entire life. This cake was a DREAM. The frosting, the texture, everything was amazing! Follow the directions exactly, shove it into the freezer right after baking, I realize it sounds weird but you will not regret it, it really does make the cake moist (I used a metal pan).

The one thing I would recommend if you do not have a convectional oven is to cook this at 300°for an hour instead of 275° (the cooking temp was one of the controversies surrounding this recipe). I live in an apartment and have a fairly average/cheap oven and it turned out just fine doing that.  

Thank you to whomever initially posted this recipe! What a cake! I'm also wondering if you an use this same recipe, but use other fruit as the bananas were the last ingredient to add (strawberries maybe?). At any rate rate, I officially dub this cake OM-NOM-NOM!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some bananas at the restaurant where I have worked as a baker since 1989. I saw the number of glowing reviews here and decided to give this cake a try. I adjusted the servings x4 to yield 72 servings. That is the ONLY change I made to the recipe. It made a full sheet pan PLUS one 9x13 pan. That's okay because I'll use the sheet pan for Sunday dessert, and all the waitstaff had a chance to critique the new recipe from the 9x13.

We tried a bit of the "sample" cake with cream cheese frosting, some with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkle of chopped walnuts and some simply dusted with confectioner's sugar.

Hands down, they preferred the dusting of confectioner's sugar. I agree with another reviewer who said, "save the cream cheese frosting for your carrot cake." This cake needs no further enhancements--it's that good!

The basic batter is amazing. Having said that, I can't wait to tamper with it. I'm going to try substituting chopped maraschino cherries and their juice for the bananas. I haven't had a good maraschino cherry cake in a long time, and I think the buttermilk and low cooking temp will keep this recipe moist even if you change the main flavor. Chocolate cake? Why not! The possibilities seem endless with this cake. LOVE IT!

After my aunt made this recipe for a family gathering I just had to have it. This is one of the best banana cakes I have ever made. It turns out perfect every time. Whenever I bring a dessert anywhere this is the one that is requested. The only thing I change is 2 teaspoons of vanilla in the frosting other than that, perfect recipe.

Moist is an understatement.  The wettest, soggiest cake I ever made.  After almost 2 hours in the oven, the last 30 minutes at 300 degrees, it was nicely brown, pulled away from the sides of the pan and toothpick tested clean.  But the bottom of the cake hopelessly mushy.  I got the idea of slicing it thin and baking the slices, like biscotti.  It worked, the slices got crispy and brown.  They were good, but I would never do this cake again.

Very disappointing. Like other reviewers, I had to bake it way longer than the stated time. The toothpick finally came out clean after about 20 extra minutes so I took it out and put it straight into the freezer. Well, I guess it wasn't quite done, because when I got it from the freezer, the middle had sunk and when we ate it, there were gooey spots. Way too much work making this cake when I have a banana cake recipe that comes out moist without all the babysitting! Won't be using this one again.

Very moist and delicious! I used extra bananas just because I had a lot of overripe ones (used about 4 total). I baked at 325 degrees for roughly 60-70 minutes. It was late at night and I didn't feel like baking at a lower temp for even longer, then waiting while it sat in the freezer. So I skipped the freezer step and this cake still turned out very moist and yummy. And of course it's dense because it's a cake made from scratch. I wouldn't say it's banana bread-like, but it's surely not like a boxed cake in texture. I think it's excellent and will definitely make again! Thanks for recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Rave reviews from the party I took it to last night.Super disappointed I didn't have any leftovers, now I have to make another one! Had a little trouble with the edges browning and the middle not being totally done, but the brown edges were still moist and the middle gooeyness was hidden by the frosting so it was all good.

The cake was very moist.  I put the pyrex pan in the freezer directly from the oven and had no problems.  The frosting was the best I ever had.

At our neighborhood block party/picnic last week, my husband fell head over heels in love with a banana cake that someone brought. After reading several different recipes, I was convinced that this one would be most similar to the one that he fell in love with. SURE ENOUGH this cake is outstanding, and my husband is thrilled. Even my teenage daughter, who claims to hate bananas, LOVES this cake and deemed it to be one of the best she's ever had.  My advise: DO NOT CHANGE THE BAKING TEMP AND FREEZER part of the directions. I believe that is a big part of what makes this cake so moist and delicious.

This cake is DELISH! Like other reviewers, my experience was that after baking for one hour, it wasn't anywhere near done. In fact, I baked it for 20 more minutes, but by then I was pressed for time with company due to arrive. I upped the temp to 350, and ten minutes later, it was finally done. It went from Not Yet to Done like *that.* I always add some vinegar to regular milk instead of making a special purchase of buttermilk. This cake has GREAT flavor and was a winner at our dinner party!

I accidently left the baking soda out and had to stir it in right before I put it in the oven. I thought I ruined the cake! The cake still turned out great and I got many requests for the recipe. Love it!

VERY good, not too banana bready at all!  I just wanted an 8x8 so cut the recipe in 1/3 & used 2 over-ripe bananas.  Some people noted it being dense so I added a bit of baking powder to make it a bit lighter.  Added a dash of cinnamon to the frosting & cut sugar a tad.  YUM!!!!  Perfect frosting:cake ratio.  Even though I made a smaller cake it still wasn't fully baked after an hour... turned heat up to 300 for 12 more mins & then into freezer... PERFECT!

If I could give this 10 stars I would!  I have never had this moist of a cake before!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except for the sugar in the cake.  I added 2 cups of fine white sugar and 1/8 cup of brown sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the frosting.  I ended up baking my cake an extra 20 minutes for a toal of 80 minutes at 275.  I immediately put the hot cake into the freezer and left it there for approximately 1 hour.  When I took it out, I frosted it it and my son and I sampled it.  WOW!  We both couldn't get enough!  Thank you for a fool-proof, EASY & tasty recipe!!!

I'd give this recipe 15 stars if I could! I put the cake right into the freezer, it makes it so moist and good! I don't do anything fancy when mixing it up. I pretty much just toss it all into a bowl and mix! I love the frosting, yeah, it's sweet, yeah, it's not healthy, but I'm having CAKE here, not an apple! Have a little fun.   The time and the temperature are right on if your oven is taking longer, check with a thermometer. Turns out mine (oven) was broken!

I am currently enjoying one of the best banana cakes I've ever encountered. This recipe makes a lot of cake that is tender, moist and a flavor explosion in your mouth. I had my doubts when I opened the oven after 1 hour and the cake was nowhere near done. I know my oven is about 10 degrees short of normal which probably accounted for the cake not being done. Considering that, I let it bake for another 40 minutes. Took it out of the oven and immediately put it in the freezer for 45 minutes, took it out and frosted it with cream cheese frosting. The cake is not too sweet which allows for the rich frosting. It is truly delicious and I have tossed all my banana cake recipes except for this one. This recipe works!

A-MA-ZING. My husband ate this until his stomach hurt. I had one piece and had to stop! Changed it a little bit - added 1 tsp cinnamon, added one more banana, changed the sugar to 1c white granulated and 1c light brown. I did wrap it up and put it in the freezer for 30 min., and because I had it in two 9" round 1 1/2" thick pans, it only took about 45 min. to cook all the way through. So good, but the frosting's a little runny. Might use a different cream cheese frosting recipe next time, something thicker, or might just chill the frosting, too. THANK YOU for posting such a great recipe! Definitely a new favorite.

Very dense, has a "fancy" taste to it.  If you like banana cake, this is the recipe for you!  I have now made this cake several times and have found the following tips helpful:  add about 1/8 to 1/4 cup more flour to make the cake less dense (more like cake than banana bread); make sure your bananas are not overripe (bananas just starting to get brown spots are perfect); and if you do not have buttermilk on hand and decide to "make your own," mix 1 Tbsp vinegar (rather than additional lemon juice) with whole milk (have tried skim and it didn't work quite the same, though still okay).  Very moist and delicious cake!

Very good cake,my family of four says it is  dense and moist like a carrot cake.I used unsalted butter and the cake came out perfectly I did not put it in the freezer to cool my convection oven kept it very moist. The batter in my opinion would bake better in larger round cake pans as the pan called for is really not appropriate for that amount of batter it will fit but to bake properly it really does need more room. I cooked mine in a convection oven at the called for temp mine took 1 hour and 10 minutes. the Frosting was very good I froze the cake after it was frosted and both the cake and frosting freeze well and defrost very well.I plan to experment using larger round pans with a higher cooking temp next time. This recipe is 5 stars all the way:>

What a great recipe! SInce I didn't have any room in my freezer I skipped that step but it still came out moist and light. I split the batter into two disposable foil pans since it seemed like a lot of batter. I think that helped it to become very fluffy. I frosted one and sprinkled the other with powdered sugar. I agree with other reviewers that it does take more than an hour to finish baking. It's more like 1hr and 20 minutes. Next time I think I'll add an extra banana to the batter and maybe try some different frostings. This recipe is another keeper. Thanks for sharing!

My husband hates spice cake, but loves banana bread, so I tried this recipe and he LOVED it.  I can't understand why some people said that this cake was too dense--I thought it was perfect.  Remember that fat and sugar give cakes their light texture.  If you cut back on one, the cake will be more dense.  Also, as cake mixes advise, beat the batter for 2 minutes or so to incorporate air--that makes it lighter too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this cake twice and both times it was moist, dense (like banana bread) and turned out perfectly.Beware: the cake by itself is very sweet! I found two of my guests scraping off the frosting, and my husband complained it was too sweet for him. On the same note - I had another guest eating all the extra frosting with a spoon! (the frosting is divine...)Next time I make it, I will subract about 1/2 cup of sugar from the cake portion of the recipe to compensate. (2 1/8ths cups of sugar is outrageous for a cake recipe)

This is a wonderful recipe!  I have made it three times since I copied it a month ago!  I personally think it's great with a caramel frosting (brown sugar melted in butter, with a little bit of milk, boiled for one minute, then powdered sugar added when that's cooled, and guess where this frosting recipe is found?  You got it! On this site!)

  My kids love this one, if they get any with me around!  (gave half of it away as a gift to a good friend, she loved it too!)

I LOVE this banana cake and my husband begs me to make it! I took this to my daughter's school and they asked for the recipe. I always use milk with lemon juice to make my own buttermilk (substitutions in the back of Betty Crocker Cookbook) because I don't keep buttermilk on hand. This a such a moist and delicious cake, the bananas are not overpowering, and I like that. Thank you, Cindy, for sharing a "winner" with us!

this is the best ever! extremely moist, the cake lasted about 20 minutes- it was wiped it out by the entire family. we used 1/2 the amount of sugar the recipe called for and it was still nicely sweet. try adding walnuts or chocolate chips. forget the diet on this one, it's worth it!

This cake has a great taste.  Very similar to banana bread and similar to previous reviews, this cake also is heavy in texture.  If you're looking for a light fluffly cake this isn't the cake for you.  I wasn't quite sure as to what to expect but was very impressed with the TASTE. My only disclaimer would be the oven temperature.  I periodically would check up on the cake and with 20 min remaining, I noticed that the entire cake was still liquid.  So I nucked the oven up to 350 for the remaining time plus addt'l 5 minutes.  275 for 1hr IS A NO GO!!!! Frosting was good, but there was way too much of it!!!  So the frosting recipe can definitely be halved.  Other than that it's a great recipe overall.

This cake was delicious, although slighly on the sweet/dense side.  I had to bake for an extra 1/2 hour before the toothpick came out clean.  Great tho, thanks!

Great recipe.  Great frosting.  It tastes a lot like the Entenmanns Banana Cake -- only better!  It took longer than an hour to bake though, more like an hour and 15 minutes.

So so good!
I work in assisted living and made this cake for the elders in my cottage. Only changes I made were that I made chocolate frosting instead and we didn't have any buttermilk. I improvised by using half & half. Turned out absolutely superb. They ate the entire cake in one day! I got one tiny little piece that was left over. MMMMM!!!!

This cake is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly.  It was SO moist and delicious, full of banana flavor.  I did have to bake it longer than stated (37 minutes longer) but that wasn't an issue.  I worried that the outside edges of the cake might get overly done baking so long (1 hr 37 minutes) but it was perfect.  I did frost with a different icing, caramel on banana cake is traditional in our family, but it would be wonderful with cream cheese frosting too.  It's just a personal preference.  Bake this cake, you won't be disapointed!  We've even had this for breakfast...it's fruit, right?  Thank you for sharing the recipe, I will use this one over and over again to use up those "over-ripe" bananas!

I cook and bake many recipes from this website, most are very good but not very often do I take the time to review.  However, this cake is amazing!  The baking temp threw me off a little as well - but I followed it to a "T" even placing in the freezer after.  The only thing I did different was to add caramel, both to the top of the cake before frosting and also a drizzling on top of the frosting for color.  Easily one of the best cakes I have ever made.  Will definitely buy banana's just so they can go bad!  Also - did not have buttermilk so just used the old lemon juice in regular milk trick.   Thanks Cindy!!

I made this banana cake. It's very good, not as dense as banana bread. Followed the recipe, I did cut the recipe in half, it still made a large one layer 9 inch cake pan size. I cooked it as stated at 275.  Cooking time for me was 1 hour and 15 minutes.I put in freezer in the pan for 1 hour. I did not make the iceing since I had some buttercream iceing I needed to use up. It is sweet but hey it's cake. The banana flavor was very mild, If I make it again I would add more banana's to increase the flavor. I do wish the directions would have been more clear as to if you take out of pan before freezer or not.  After freezeing there is no way to remove cake from pan. Gave it 4 stars only because there was not much banana flavor, and it take a long time to make. Not sure if it's worth this much time for a cake unless you just love banana cake.

Moist is an understatement.  I bake a lot and followed this recipe exactly.  It takes about 30 minuets longer to bake than it says.  The cake is dense with mushy spots and too sweet.  Like undercooked banana bread.  I was very disappointed.  My family liked it - Won't make this again.  I have a really good Banana Bread recipe.  ;(

Well, I can't say that I got to taste it since the entire cake was eaten at church and none made it home.  Judging by what my friends told me, it's fantastic and I have requests for the recipe.  Patience, grasshopper, patience.  This WILL work.  Yes, preheat the oven to 275 degrees.  Trust me, IT WORKS!  You may have to bake longer than  hour.  In my oven, a total of 1 hour and 25 minutes.  Start checking with a toothpick at the hour mark, if you need more time, check in 5-10 minute increments.  It looks like the cake will never cook but then voila, it's done.  I don't know if anyone else did it, but I beat the frosting on high speed for a few extra minutes to make it extra fluffy.  Plus, since I don;t like my sweets too sweet, I cut back on the sugar in the cake by 1/4 cup and in the frosting by 1/2 cup.

I edited this recipe to 12 servings and made it in a 9x9" pan.  After baking it for 1 hr. 10 min. in a 275 convection oven, it was done to perfection. I immediately put it outside on the deck (30 degrees out there) so I didn't have to warm up the freezer. I love this cake recipe! It was moist, but not heavy.  I added toasted walnuts to the batter and also sprinkled some on top of the frosting.  I ended up with too much frosting, but I can always make another cake.

This banana cake is outstanding.  Followed recipe exactly as written.  The cake was very moist and quite filling.  Recipe says "serves 18," but I would double the servings to 36 servings, if being served as dessert after a meal...it is that filling!

I loved this cake!  My roommate loved the cake itself, but she thought the frosting was too sweet.  I love sweets, so it came out perfect.  The cake was very moist.  It took about 40 minutes longer to cook than the time suggested, so just check it regularly and take it out when you think it's ready.  I think I'll add walnuts in the cake next time.

I made this recipe this evening after our bananas went straight from green to brown.  I followed the recipe exactly as written (including pan size).  This is hands down the best banana ANYTHING I have had.  The cake is light (for banana; still heavier than a chocolate cake but much lighter than banana bread)and moist.  The cake is not overly sweet, which makes the sweeter frosting a perfect compliment.  I had no problems with the timing, the cake was uniformly baked in 1 hour and 10 minutes.  I used a glass 9x13 Pyrex dish, which is easy to move from oven to freezer.  I have no idea if it would have turned out as well baked at a different temp or sans the freezer step, but it was so delicious, I have no desire to tempt fate and bake it any other way!  Thanks so much for an amazing recipe!!!

I tried the recipe without making any changes.  It did take about 1.5 hours at 275 degrees.  Great banana cake - family devoured it. The good thing about Wisconsin is your whole backyard can become a freezer so finding room will never be a problem in the winter months.  I freeze surplus bananas in the freezer.  Simply thaw and unpeel when you need them. The skins turn dark brown but don't worry...they'll be fine to use in any baked goods.

I made only half a recipe, which made 20  cupcakes. I baked at 350 degrees. I was looking for a banana cake recipe that's light and has a cake-like texture. (Most recipes I've tried are dense and taste more like banana bread.) This recipe is exactly what I was looking for. Great recipe!

This was unbelievable! I didn't change a thing other than maybe added a little more banana than called for.  I usually take part of whatever I've baked over to my in-laws for them to eat.  Since taking some of this banana cake over there he always comments on how wonderfull "that banana cake" was.  I know he is hoping I will make more soon!  (I'm making one for him now!)  

Best banana cake ever.  Great frosting too!!!

Amazing recipe. Everyone who has tried it, has loved it. It is extremely moist and the cream cheese frosting is delicious.  

I made a couple adjustments though. I put 3 whole bananas in the batter instead if 1-1/2 cups. Also I cooked the cake for 80 minutes, because the cake was not set after 60 minutes.

This cake was wonderful!  It was moist; it was flavorful; it was easy to make.  The directions were right on with the temperature at 275 and then putting right in the freezer.  I will make this again and again.  Everyone loved it!

This is good, no doubt, but very, very sweet. Personally I think it would have been fine without all the frosting, it's sweet enough as is. I also didn't do the freezer method and it came out perfectly moist. There are a few glitches in this recipe tho, one being the cook time/temp. I had to cook mine for 1 hr 30 mins. Secondly, the amount of sugar? I left out the extra 1/8 cup because to me, it isn't necessary. As I said earlier, it's a very sweet cake. Thirdly, could use more banana. I wasn't tasting a whole lot of banana flavoring and the frosting is too much, totally overpowers the cake. That being said, it was good but I think next time I make it I will omit the frosting and cook it at a higher temp for less time. Tastes just like banana bread!

If I could give more stars, I would.

Oft times I will make adjustments to some recipes I see on here, but I thought I would try this EXACTLY as the submitter said.  I am glad I did!  I did have to bake a little longer than an hour, but that may have something to do with my oven.

All I can say is, "WOW!"  This cake is the BEST banana cake I have ever had, hands down!  I am a chocoholic and this cake is so good, I don't miss not having any chocolate!  I prefer this cake over the chocolate ones I make.  Now THAT is saying something!!

I have made this SEVERAL times so far, and I still follow the recipe exactly as written.  Every place I take this, I get an outpouring of people raving about this cake.  For fun, this last time, I sprinkled some walnuts on top of half of the cake because my husband LOVES walnuts and it just enhanced the flavor even more.

I simply cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I am glad I followed the recipe exactly because I feel it needs no alterations.

I also love how I can use up all the frozen bananas I have floating around in my freezer.  I usually plop an overly ripe banana in the freezer for future banana breads.  Now they are all ear marked for this cake.

Try this recipe and you will not regret it!

This cake is FOOL-PROOF! LOL and delicious. I made it as directed which gave me about half a sheet. I shared it with my family as well as with some of my church members who called it "divine". I'm not sure if it's the buttermilk but it is VERY hard to overcook this cake. It come out perfectly every time. I added banana cream instant pudding (dry powder) to up the flavor and it was wonder. The cake it light and tender and not overly sweet - a great compliment to the cream cheese frosting. I dropped some slices to my brother and his family - he's not big on sweets but he called me hollerin about how awesome it was. I've already transformed the basic recipe into a carrot cake - YUMMY! I'll keep playing with flavors because the texture is first class! Melt in your mouth perfection. Thanks Cindy!

This cake was amazing! I was also skeptical about the temperature, but i'm glad I tried this cake. It was super moist, and it had a great texture. I only had to bake it for about 35 minutes and it was done. I did halve the recipe though. I would definitely make this again. Thanks!

Simply delicious cake!  My only changes were to cut in half and bake in an 8x8 pan, make my own buttermilk with milk & vinegar, use egg whites only, substitute about half the sugar with splenda, and I used 2 full bananas.  The frosting recipe provides a THICK layer of frosting if you use it all!

I followed the recipe exactly but made approximately 80 mini cupcakes.  I baked at 275 for 30 minutes and cooled in the freezer for around 10 minutes.  There was quite a bit of frosting left over when all was said and done.  I added a bit of chopped pecan to top it off.  They were very moist and had excellent texture.  Next time I will add more banana and/or extract, and less sugar.

Very good cake, its certainly moist! My cake had to spend 1,5 hours in the oven, but I kept it at original temperature. I would recommend to add an extra banana or two to enhance the flavor - I had 5 medium sized bananas in, and we still wished the banana flavor was stronger. Cream on top is amazing, get ready to invite many friends over for this one :)

This is the BEST banana cake ever!  Followed the recipe to a "T" with the exeption that I put it in an Angel Food Cake Pan to cook (as I prefer this type of cake to square flat cakes)and let it cook til' the toothpick came out clean which took 1 1/2 hours vs the hour.  OMG - my tonge almost slapped my brain out!  YUM, YUM, YUM

This cake is delicious! I followed the directions exactly except I skipped the freezer part. I didn't feel like it was safe to raise the temp. of the freezer by putting the hot cake in there.  Even with skipping this step, the cake is wonderfully moist. It had a good banana flavor and would be fine without icing but of course, the icing only makes it better! I highly recommend this recipe! Some people stated that it was dense like banana bread. I did not find that to be the case.

This cake is amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. I did have to bake it longer though. I used a glass pyrex pan which I think extends the baking time. Mine was not done in an hour. I checked it every 10 minutes after the inital hour. Total baking time for me was 90 min. Everyone loved this delicious cake!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It's basically banana bread with frosting on it.  I like banana bread and I like frosting, so it's not bad.  It got better with age.... more moist (I kept it in the fridge).  If I were serving for company I would make it 1-3 days ahead of time.

Awesome banana cake!  Except for using half white sugar and half brown sugar, I followed the directions exactly -- including the unusual baking/freezing method.  My cake turned out light, super moist, and very flavorful.  Not at all like banana bread, except in flavor.  This was definitely a "cake."  Only used 2 cups of powdered sugar in the icing...that is plenty for the perfect amount of sweetness.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I hate butter cream or normal frostings so I found a recipe online somewhere that was 1 cup of milk mixed with (any flavor) 1 instant pudding pack, and a tub of cool whip.  The consistency is the same as frosting but not super sweet. I used a banana cream pudding flavor and sliced the cake sideways and put frosting in middle with more on the top of the cake. Absolutely delicious! Thanks.

Great cake and AMAZING frosting!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the lemon juice (I didn't have), and I only used 3 cups of sugar in the frosting.  It did take 80 minutes to cook, but I put it in the freezer when done, just like the instructions said, and it came out nice and moist.  This is more dense than a normal cake (but not as dense as banana bread).  The frosting is what makes it though - GREAT cream cheese frosting!  Hubby took this to work and people were raving about it.  A winner for sure!

DELISH. Used a little less than 2 cups of sugar, and I think it would still be great with even less sugar.

Great recipe, very moist and flufy eating HOT outta oven :) I cut down the butter to 1/2 cup, sugar to 1 1/2 cup brown, and increased banana to 1 3/4 cup. Didn't add in any lemon juice. The cake' sweetness and texture was right on! Didn't even bother with the topping. Only one minor thing, the baking soda was a bit overwhelming, will try cutting down to 1 tsp next time. **The flour and baking soda must be mixed well, even the smallest lump will remain in the final cake :( ** Baked it at 140C for 1.5hours (at 1 hour it was still runny in the middle).
Edit: After cooling it (just left it outside for 5 hours, it's winter) it became really dense and not crumbly at all :( Very Bread-like. Will try some other recipes.

Wonderfully moist, flavorful banana cake!  I made only the cake portion of this recipe for my son's birthday with banana-coconut-walnut frosting between the layers and regular buttercream to decorate.   SO good.  I did make a few small changes, using only about 1 cup of brown sugar instead of so much white sugar, substituting plain yogurt for the buttermilk, and increasing the cooking temp. to 325 for 40 minutes to avoid freezing afterward (no room in my freezer for two hot pans).  I will probably try the lower temperature cooking at some point, but this was plenty moist and very sweet, even to those with a serious sweet tooth, with the reduced brown sugar.  Easy to make, and would definitely recommend to anyone, especially with the banana-nut frosting.

7/18/11-  I've made this at least three times in the past month now, and just used the frosting recipe listed with it, but added some mashed banana to it.  Delicious!

I'd give this one a 6 if I could.  Perfection.  I followed the instructions to the letter (but just made a half recipe so I used an 8 x 8 pan) except I didn't have any lemons on hand so I used 2 tsp. key lime juice from a bottle instead.  If there was a difference I couldn't taste it since there was no lime flavour at all.  I also added vinegar to milk in place of the buttermilk.  Thanks so much for this recipe - it's absolutely delicious.

WOW! Awesome recipe and thanks for sharing! I made the cake exactly how the directions said to and I can say it's the best banana cake I've ever had! I made one alteration; instead of regular sugar I used 1 cup of Splenda half and half to cut out some of the calories...still turned out wonderful! :)

yum!  the only change i made was that i added a tsp of cinnamon to the batter before baking and topped the icing with chopped pecans before serving.  if you don't have buttermilk on hand you can put 6 tsp of vinegar or lemon juice in the milk to thicken it like buttermilk - it works perfectly.

I believed the 275 would work, but it just doesn't for me. That turns into a gooey mess for me. I don't know why. I gave it 75 minutes at 300 and stuck it in the freezer for the recommended time and it is great. The second time I also cut the sugar in half. I mean over 2 cups is just ridiculous. I like things sweet, but that's a little much. ***Note: it will help immensly to use very ripe mushy bananas. Otherwise you'll wind up with chunks of bananas that will come across as a little sour next to the rest of the sweet cake. This is like a fabulous light banana bread with frosting, thanks for sharing!

I was intrigued by this recipe and had to try it.  I followed the recipe exactly so I could give an accurate assessment.  This recipe takes much longer than 60 minutes to bake this cake at 275º, closer to two hours.  Then you need to freeze it for 45 minutes.  But if you have plenty of time on your hands, it does make a very moist flavorful banana cake.  I think the frosting overpowers the cake, so I would prepare half the amount.

Very good dish. I used chocolate chips in mine as one reviewer suggested and it turned out great! Just baked it hours ago and it's almost half gone!

I am an expert baker and when I first read this recipe, I thought the temperature of 275 degrees must be a typo, but I converted the celcius temperature to confirm.  This cake takes some time, but it is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  Tender,  moist, and loved by everyone.  It did take a lot longer to bake to a clean toothpick ( 1 hour 25 minutes), so use the toothpick test over the bake time listed for the recipe.  This is the only Banana Cake I will ever make again.  Unbelievable!

I still have this baking in my oven. The cooking time or temp is WAY off! I cooked this as stated 275 for 60 min, still runny in the middle, cooked for 10 more minutes, runny in the middle, upped the temp to 325 for 10 more minutes, still runny in the middle. I will try another 10 minutes. What the hell is going on how could this recipe be right. I hope it works out I am making it for a church picnic in a few hours.

I just had a piece of this lucious cake. I added walnuts to the cake then sprinkled some on top of the icing. The cake could not be any better. I will make it many, many times.

This cake is fantastic!  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and I had to bake it for an hour and a half at 275, but it came out moist and delicious.  Even my husband who doesn't usually like banana cake thought it was good.

This is the most amazing cake I have ever baked! It is very easy and incredibly moist! I use it as a base for all kinds of cake.....just replace the bananas with pumpkin for a pumpkin spice cake or with 3/4 cup of cocoa for an incredibly moist chocolate cake! I know the recipe calls for a 9x13 pan, but I baked mine in a bunt pan. However it had to cook for 2 hours on the low heat!

This recipe is great.  Extremely moist flavorful cake.  I love it and it doesn't even have the frosting on yet!  I did have to increase the baking time by 30 min.  The only change I made was to use a gluten free flour.  Will definitely make again.

I was tempted to bake in the conventional way (350 degrees for about 30 minutes) but in the end, the curiosity about the low temp and freezer cooling got the better of me. I'm glad it did. This is spectacularly moist and delicious. The only changes I made was to halve the recipe and bake it in a 9" square pan for an hour, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and subbed Splenda for 2/3 of the sugar. Phenomenal!!! Because it's baked at such a low temperature, the top doesn't get brown like other banana cakes, so frosting adds a lot for eye appeal. Also used Splenda in the cream cheese frosting (I'm diabetic.) I've never had such a super moist banana cake, and I've made some incredibly moist banana cakes before. With the Splenda, it doesn't cause my blood sugar to spike, a huge bonus because even we diabetics crave a baked goodie now and then.

Very delicious!  I made a half-recipe, and it fit well into a 10x7 pyrex pan.  I threw in some chocolate chips I had. I followed the baking directions, and it was so soft and moist!  I didn't put it in the freezer though, since I was worried about putting a hot glass pan direct in the freezer.  I will make this again!

I was looking for a way to use up some over ripe bananas and came across this recipe.  I sorted reviews by most helpful and came across the comments by the recipe submitter and so glad that I did because I thought the oven temp (275) was an error.  I went ahead and baked it at the low temp and put straight in the freezer (on top of some foil) and WOW, the result was really great.  Only change for me was to use cake flour and I ended up with more batter than would fit in a 13 x 9 so I used a slightly larger pan.  I topped with a chocolate glaze and finely chopped walnuts.  Amazing light texture and just melt in your mouth good.  Makes a very large cake so would be good for a group.

This is my first banana cake attempt, and let me just say I think it's a runaway success! I needed something relatively simple and delicious for my daughter's youth group at church tonight. I whipped this up, put a little batter in a baby bundt (so I could sample it before sharing), and the rest in a 13x9. An hour later: Light, fluffy, moist, subtly banana-y cake. Beautiful!

So here's what I used that may have affected the end result - self-rising flour, jumbo eggs, 1 c. white sugar/1 c. brown, reconstituted powdered buttermilk using warm water, and I skipped the lemon juice. Oh, and I added about 1/2 t. (plus a few shakes) apple pie spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice). Finally, I compromised about the temp/baking time: I baked it for an hour at 300... just right.

I haven't frosted it yet, but plan to. I enjoyed the baby bundt without frosting... but I'm a sucker for cream cheese frosting, so off I go.


EDIT: Well, per other reviewers (and since we often feel frosting is overdone), I halved the frosting recipe. I used 1.5 c. powdered sugar, 1/4 c. butter, 4 oz. cream cheese, and I can't remember if I used 1/2 or 1 t. vanilla. Either way, it was the perfect amount to thinly spread on the cake. I sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on the whole cake when done and chopped pecans on only half. My daughter told me everyone loved it - most of the kids wanted seconds.

Thanks for another winning recipe!

I liked the cake.  It is a heavy cake, but not as heavy as bread.  I used 2 cups banana - it has to be ripe or over-ripe banana to achieve the flavor. Doubled the vanilla I baked it at 275 for 1-1/2 hours.  I skipped the part about putting it in the freezer (not necessary!)  We used 1/2 recipe for the frosting and topped with pecans that were caramelized in butter and brown sugar and a little cinnamon.  Be careful with this one - a moment on the lip, a lifetime on the hip.  It is a special occasion cake.

Thank you Cindy! This is such a delicious cake. Friends at work think I am a sensational baker now. I followed the recipe exactly, although the freezer bit seemed rather strange to me. I simply folded a towel and set my hot cake pan on it, in the freezer. I did have to bake for 15-20 minutes longer than the instructions. The frosting did make a lot and I just lightly frosted mine and then sprinkled with chopped walnuts. I froze the rest of the frosting to use another time. Yum! One more note, in my All Recipes cookbook, they do have your banana cake recipe and they baked it at 350 for an hour and 5 minutes without the freezing and I've tried it that way also and it is still excellent, with half the work. I have also cut the frosting right in half for a 13x9 cake and it was just enough.

Wonderful!  Baked at 275, and it took 1 hour and 20 minutes.  I also used the Cream Chees Frosting II recipe, and it was fabulous.  The cake was gone in minutes, and everyone loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

I was looking for a dessert other than brownies to feed 3 picky adult men. I chose this recipe because of the glowing reviews and boy were they right! All 3 men LOVED this cake and    begged to take home the leftovers. It is moist yet fluffy with wonderful mouth feel.  Don't change a thing in the recipe! I will make this again! Maybe tomorrow...

This recipe is truly wonderful!!  I made a few changes on my own though :)  That is the fun in baking!  I added a box of banana cream pudding to the batter and also put the frosing on the side incase anyone wanted it which they did!! No left overs after this one!  My husband took it to work to share with his office staff and they all loved it.  The frosting came out really fluffy in my KA mixer. I also flipped the cake out on to a cutting board and cooled it in the freezer so my frozen food would stay freezer safe.  Have fun and enjoy this one is truly a keeper!!

Used 1% milk instead of buttermilk.  Very good cake, will make it again.  Took at least 1 hour plus twenty mins.  Didn't put cake in freezer after cooking, had no room.  I love cream cheese frosting and this frosting was good.  It was almost 1/2" thick on the cake, almost too much but actually can never be too much frosting!!!  YUMMY, Keeper, 
Thanks, Michele, cambridge Ontario

This recipe is perfect exactly as it is!  150% yes, a million times over!  Do plan on a longer bake time (+ 30 minutes), but it is worth it since the cake gets cooked all the way through without browning on the edges and top.

This cake was moist and delicious.I baked it in a disposible foil pan these pans cool of rather quickly and don't create a problem when placing in the freezer directly from the oven.Daughters, cousin and mother love this cake.

It is a very good cake, but because the consistency is so much like banana bread, I'd rather have the bread because it has less fat and calories.

THis is a great go-to recipe. EVERYONE loves it. You can frost it with caramel icing, peanut butter frosting, or add chocolate chips. Makes great cupcakes too.

I love this cake.  I am a chocolate lover so I didn't think I would like this, but it is one of my favorites.

I made this with my 3 year old for Father's Day for my husband.  It was very easy and it turned out wonderful.  It was moist and yummy!  I followed the directions exactly except I added some cocoa powder to the frosting.  Yum!  I will make it again!

I made this cake for my mom's birthday and she said it was exactly like the one she used to have as a kid.  I baked it at 325 for 42 minutes and it was perfect.  Very moist!

This cake was awesome!!!!!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  I had so much batter it filled a 7x11 pan and an 8x8 as well.  I had enough frosting for both cakes.  I added chocolate chips, and it took 1 hour 10 minutes at the specified temp.  This cake was so good I told my husband we had to give it away because I couldn't be trusted with it in the house. It was so moist and flavorful.  I gave some to my parents, grandparents and landlord and it was a hit. I'll make this again and again.

This cake turned out great but... I had to bake it for two, repeat 2 hours... I bake all the time and my oven is only three years old so I think my temp is good. I have never baked a cake on such a low temp before. I thought the temperature setting was a typo error at first but the majority of reviewers seemed to have no problem with the baking time. I live in texas so maybe the submitter and other reviewers live in Alex Baldwania where temperatures are just a little hotter.

My family loved the results but I'm disappointed.  The centre sunk and was gooey.  The outer ring was just fine.   What did I do wrong?  And what is "all purpose" flour (I'm an Aussie male amateur cook)?  I only know plain & self-raising flour.

Uh, Oh, I am in trouble here, this is to die for! I have a few things I would like to say, if you change a recipe around, and then rate it, you are rating YOUR recipe, not this one.......which is why I do not give recipes out to people that 'play' with recipes. I hate when I am begged for a recipe, then when I see the person again, they just hate that recipe, because they did this and  that and that to it, and mine tasted so much better, well, DUH! Cindy thank that woman with the 12 kids for us, will you?

Very moist and good.  Frosting was a little sweet for me so will use less or omit next time.  May also add some cinnamon to batter next time.  Will definitely make again!

I really liked this cake, but only after it set in the refrigerator overnight, my family agrees.  This is more like a banana bread with icing because it is very dense.  Also, I had to bake it for 1 hour and 30 minutes to get it close to being done in the center.  I was looking for something a little lighter as far as the cake part, but feel this is an excellent banana bread recipe even without the icing.

This is an excellent recipe.  It's so moist and delicious!  I made a couple of minor changes in the frosting - used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar and added 1/2 tsp of banana extract.  Also, I made 3 smaller cakes -- one for a friend who just lost his wife, another for our daughter to take to work, and one to keep here for the family. I baked at 325 for about 30 mins.  Everyone loved it.

OMG!!  I took a HUGE chance and made this recipe for the very first time so that I may give the mini loaves to friends and family for Christmas!
I could've scored this recipe 10 stars had they offered!  It was a huge hit with everyone and my husband ate the entire large loaf.  I doubled the recipe and I had no problems.  One thing I did differently was to add another package of cream cheese and lessen the powdered sugar by 1 cup.  It was perfect!  Great job!-Elvia

My husband is the King of banana cakes because it is his favorit. We are married 23years so I have made a lot of cakes. Well this is the BEST cake you will ever make. It is very moist and light. My family just loves it and so does anyone that tastes it. I made it just like the receipe did not change a thing. The frosting is great to. I take my cake out of the pan and frost the whole cake. Thank you Cindy for this great cake.

After reading the reviews about the baking temp., I wasn't sure which way to go. I decided to bake as originally stated. I had to leave it in the oven maybe 5 minutes longer than specified, but it turned out GREAT! I didn't put it in the freezer tho and I still thought it was very moist. The frosting was really good, but I thought it was too much. Next time I will maybe make half. Otherwise, this is a very unusual and delicious cake.

This cake was really good. My husband thought it was great, but he thinks all baked goods are great. I used two cups of bananas because that was how many I had, but you have to bake it about 10-15 minutes longer when doing this. I did not put it in the freezer, because my freezer isn't big enough, but it was very moist anyway. I also put pecans in the icing. EXCELLENT!!!

Oh my Lordy it was so good. Moist and delicious.  I used 6 very ripe bananas. Didn't have butter milk so I used 1/2 plain yogurt mixed in with 1 cup whole milk the rest of the recipe I followed exactly as written and I used bundt pan so it took longer to bake.

This was a good cake.  You do need to freeze it immediately to keep the moisture in the cake.  I made into cupcakes, which were really nice. I didn't use this frosting recipe.

This cake is amazing! My family was skeptical at first but after tasting it they went back for more and more! I used milk and 1.5 TBSP of vinegar instead of the buttermilk. I did cut down to about 2  1/2 cups of sugar in the icing and it tasted just right. I am going to try this recipe with a different fruit and hopefully it will be just as moist and delicious! Awesome recipe!!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was a perfect texture and moisture. It was delicious.  It's the best banana cake I've ever made! The freezing aftetwards was a great idea. It still came out warm 45 minutes later, and was ready to serve. Three days in, and its still moist and light.

This cake is Excellent EXACTLY as directed!!!  I have made it multiple times and everyone is wowed by it EVERY time!  I like walnuts, so I do like to stir a cup of walnuts into the cake batter...and I sprinkle walnuts on top of the icing.  This is a great recipe for using those ripe bananas you through in the freezer!

So easy and yummy! I have made this on numerous occasions, and all are grateful for a different banana dessert rather than bread! I'm gonna keep making it forever!

There are two types of recipes in my house, those I would serve to guests and my comfort food; for my family and I...this, well this can be both...I even made it with coconut oil in place of butter, sans icing for our lactose free friend, and still delish!

You've GOT to make this cake!! I made it exactly as written except I didn't have buttermilk so I used the milk/lemon juice trick. I took it to work to celebrate the January birthdays and it was a hit! It loved by everyone. One of my co-workers was so grateful that I made it - said that it reminded her of her mom's! It was the first time that I made it and I will definitely make it again!

This cake was awsome. Was first time i did not "tweak" a recipe according to reviews.  I did put walnuts in 1/2 of the batter to please everyone. What is is great is that the center gets done without the sides getting dry and the whole thing is amazingly moist.

Delicious cake. Had to cook for more than an hour. Increased temp to 300 after about 75 min and then baked another 20 min or so. Followed other suggestions and did half cup white sugar and half brown sugar. Halfed the icing and it was perfect. Also added chopped pecans on top. Amazing cake that I will make again for surem

The search for the perfect banana  cake has ended.  Period.  I have made no less than 6 different recipes in search of the perfect combination of texture, bite, crumb and flavor.  This is it.  Admittedly a little  on the  dense side, but I don't want a spongy,  airy,  sissy banana cake.   And while cream cheese frosting is perfectly fine, you are missing out if you don't  try it at least once  with a creamy, whipped milk chocolate frosting.   (fYI When i plan ahead and have buttermilk in the house, i use it.  But occasionally, the urge overtakes me,and i don't have buttermilk handy...  and i just add lemon juice to milk and let it sit for a few minutes.  Works just fine, without a significant discernible difference.

This banana cake is amazing!  I had bananas I had to use and with the simple ingredients, I had everything in the house to make this cake.  I made 1/2 the recipe (using the change serving setting to change it from 18 to 9),so instead of 9 x 13, I made an 8 x 8 cake instead. Aside from cutting all the ingredients in 1/2, I did not make any changes to the recipe itself. My family absolutely loved it and the kids could participate in making it.  This is definitely my new "go to" cake! I have to say this is my favorite cake!

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  Let's just say I didn't have any of it left 2 days later.  The second time I made it was for an office party.  I decided that I didn't just want a banana cake but a banana strawberry cake.  So I halved my dry batter and added strawberry gelatin (dry mix) to one half.  I also halved my wet batter and mixed the plain dry batter with 3/4 cup of buttermilk together, later stirring in 1 cup of banana puree mixed with 1 tsp of lemon juice.  I took the remaining half of my strawberry gelatin dry batter and also mixed it separately with the remaining half of the wet batter and another 3/4 cup of buttermilk.  I stirred in 1 cup of strawberry puree afterwards.  I layered the strawberry batter over the banana batter and took a butter knife and swirled the two together.  I kept the cooking time the same and put it directly in the freezer once baked.  I also used a different frosting:   Heat at medium heat 5 tbsp of flour and 1 cup of milk in a small saucepan, stirring frequently until the sauce is very thick.  Remove from heat and let cool completely (this is very important, it cannot be warm at all before adding in the vanilla extract).  Add in one tsp. of vanilla extract to the flour/milk mixture.  In a separate bowl, mix 1 cup of butter (soften) with 1 cup of granulated sugar (do not use powdered sugar).  Mix in the cooled flour/milk mixture until peaks form.

This recipe is wonderful! I have made it into cupcakes a couple times. I made some adjustments as I live in Colorado at 7200 ft. So if you live at high elevation here is my adjustment: Butter: 1/2 Cup + 2 TBSPN, Sugar: 2 Cups, Flour: 3 1/2 Cups, Baking Soda: 1 tsp, and all other ingredients remain the same. Be careful to only fill muffin cups no more than 3/4 full or they will overflow as high elevation tends to make baked goods rise more than usual.

I love bananas! Always looking for recipes to use them with. I followed the directions as written, included all the ingredients. No tweaking at all. The cake turned out super moist, a little dense and not too sweet. So yummy! I also used the butter cream frosting recipe to top it off. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but still yum. So I frosted the cake with a thin layer and sprinkled walnuts on top. Will definitely make again!

Very heavy. More like banana bread than cake. I used the recipe Real Strawberry Frosting instead of the one that came with this one. Really adds an interesting flavor. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/real-strawberry-frosting/detail.aspx

This was fabulous! A local cake maker once told me that her secret to her moist cakes was that she put them directly into the freezer from the oven so I was not afraid to try this recipe. It did not disappoint! The cake itself was a little more dense than say a plain white cake, but it wasn't as heavy as banana bread either. I had a few minor substitutions: A little brown sugar for the white, had to make my own buttermilk since I didn't have any and I doubled the frosting recipe. I made a layer cake out of this (a BIG layer cake) and that is the only reason I doubled the frosting. I did have some left over but one recipe would not have been enough. One should be perfect for a 9x13 though. Baking time was about an hour and 10 minutes for two 9" rounds. When the layer cake was all assembled, I toasted some chopped walnuts and pressed them onto the sides of the cake. It was pretty and delicious!

I made this with 1/2 cup of honey to replace the sugar, and half whole oats/ half flour. I also used whole milk instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any. I followed the baking directions exactly and stuck it right in the freezer. It is SO moist and delicious!

FANTASTIC Cake! I loved how moist and dense it was. I followed the directions to the T (along with the freezer directions) and it went perfectly. Will definitely be making this again. I did however, reduce the powdered sugar in the icing to 1 1/4 cupsugar. I did as one reader suggested and tasted as I went. 3 1/2 cups would have been FAR too much. It was wonderful and I will DEFINITELY be making it again....and again. Thanks for sharing! :)

This recipe for banana cake is to die for! The banana flavor is mild, the cake isn't too sweet and it is extremely moist. My husband, who does not like bananas, LOVED this cake. The only tweak I made was with the frosting. I did not use the full 3.5 cups of powdered sugar. Instead, I started with 2 and kept adding sugar and tasting until I got it to taste just right for me. I ended up only using 2.5 cups of sugar. I cannot wait to make this cake again!

Wow!  As other reviewers said, I was a little worried about the instructions (low oven temp, freezer), but figured I'd try it.  I also wondered if it would taste much like banana bread (as the batter did), but I was pleasantly surprised how rich and decadent this is!  I don't even think it needs an icing, it's perfect without it!

I followed this recipe exactly.  Let me just say that had I frozen this cake immediately after baking at 275 for one hour, I would indeed have one moist cake because the cake wasn't even close to being cooked.  A good half of the cake was still very jiggly after an hour.  I turned the heat up to 350 and baked for another 30 minutes. It was then cooked enough.
One thing I learned though is that bananas that have gone completely black and soft, and rather ugly looking inside, are okay for cooking, that they are at their sweetest then.  So, no more wasted bananas for me.  However, it's unlikely I'll make this cake again.  Perhaps it might have cooked in the time specified if I'd halved the recipe as another reviewer did who had no problem, or maybe used a bigger pan than 9x13.  There was a lot of cake batter, so it's worth another try on that basis.

Out of this world delicious!!  There is a reason this cake still has a 5-star rating with over 900+ reviews, it is GREAT.  I was looking for a way to use up some buttermilk and came across this recipe.  This cake is so moist and the banana flavor just pops in this cake.  The frosting is your basic cream cheese frosting, but it is the actual cake that makes this recipe.  Thanks Cindy Carnes for sharing your recipe.  I just noticed that you have more "Published Recipes" than anyone else I've come across on this site.  I look forward to trying some of your other recipes.

This was the first cake I have EVER made from scratch-so I followed the instructions to a tee (and used a large KitchenAid mixer too) including baking on the lower-than-usual tempurature and the freezer cool down.  My kids and father in law LOVED it!!!  It was so moist, the frosting was delicious and the perfect balance to the cake.  I was concerned that it would taste too much like banana bread instead of a cake-it did not!!!  I can't compare the ease of baking to others, but I can say that for a novice like myslelf, this was a "peice of cake" to throw together!

Best Banana Cake ever ... only change I made was cooking time - at 275 I baked for 1hr. 40 mins.  Right from oven to freezer for 45 minutes. It was perfect, super moist and will definitely bake again.

Soooo good! I made it as stated, but I did have to cook it at 275' for 1 hour and 15 minutes--and I cut the sugar back to 2 cups. I immediately stuck it in the freezer for exactly 45 minutes and it was excellent. Best Banana Cake ever. I used to love the Banana Cake sold at Beaverton Bakery in Beaverton, Oregon, and this is just as good--if not better. It's very moist and flavorful. I used a different frosting recipe; I used the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site and my husband loved it. He said the frosting made it even better. I usually make banana bread with left-over yucky bananas--never again. I will make this from now on. Trust me--this is the Banana Cake recipe to use--and follow the unorthodox baking instructions exactly. You wont be disappointed. Yummy!!!

10 stars plus!!!!  This was the best, most moist banana cake EVER!  The only changes I made were that I used 2 cups of sugar (I may use 1.5 next time) and I used 2 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting.  To die for!  It took about 1 hr 40 min total...my new favorite banana cake!!  Thanks so much, Cindy :-)

This is an EXCELLENT cake!  Very moist and flavorful.  Putting a cake directly from oven to freezer is very odd, but let me tell you it makes it the moistest cake I've had.  We like to use a jelly-roll style pan to make a thinner cake but the 13x9 pan is great too.  I use my mom's buttercream recipe on the cake and it is outstanding.  Don't be afraid to make this cake -- I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!

Can I please give this one 10 stars?  OMG, this is now my FAVORITE cake EVER!!!  DH asked me to next time put chocolate chips in it.  I told him, no way!  I add chocolate to a lot of things for him, but I'm not messing with this recipe (and I'm not really a chocolate lover...shocking, I know!).  I love this just the way it is and this is MY cake!!!  hehe  I'll make him something else chocolate. :)

This cake is amazing! However, I did not have cream cheese on hand, so I decided to make chocolate frosting (Rich Chocolate Frosting on this site scaled down to 8 servings). It was absolutely delicious and is now one of my very favorite cakes. Chocolate and banana - what's not to like?

Not as dense or banana intense as banana bread, but it tastes good enough.  Next time I'm going to figure out how to amp up the banana flavor.

This cake was so good and so moist!  I made it as a three (9-inch) layer cake and baked the cakes for about 35 minutes at 325 degrees.  I didn't do the freezer thing, but I don't think it matters because it is so moist!  I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe, which makes a little more in order to frost all the layers.  My husband and kids can't get enough!  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious and super moist.  Made as directed, including the low temp and freezer steps.  Only change was to use milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk.

I'm not quite sure how it tastes yet, but be careful to use enough batter that fills half the pan. I dumped all of the batter into my 9x13 inch pan and while it was baking, it ended up spilling over. Grr.

After seeing all the reviews, had to make and chime in. I made the recipe with no changes, so it's fair.  
It's moist, easy to make, and tasty.  BUT I think that it's a little on the heavy side, like a bread.  The frosting was good, the cream cheese taste was a bit strong for the banana cake, so I added in more powdered sugar to the remainder of the frosting.  As far as the cake, i'd probably keep the recipe, but still am searching for one that is a bit less dense. I didn't think it was too sweet as some had mentioned. I'm not sure if sticking it in the freezer does anything for the cake if you are going to eat it within a couple of days or that day anyways. All it does is bring your freezer temp down and defrosts some items.  It didn't cool the entire cake either.  I did have to bake mine for 1 hour and 25 minutes at 275 degrees.  I don't live in high altitude, and I do have an oven thermometer.

Gave this 4 stars as I would not make as written.  I think the cooking temp is wrong.  I baked 350F for 45 minutes. I did not put it in the freezer. Came out perfectly.  I also substituted fat free sour cream for the buttermilk.  Great with cream cheese frosting.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. It was simply DIVINE! I made this in two 9-inch round cake pans and made a layer cake. We had plenty of frosting for the cake. It disappeared in just two days. We are already planning on making another one in a few days... one piece for my daughter and myself and the rest to share.

Simply Delicious! I was able to follow the baking instructions to the letter and it came out perfect. We ate half of the cake (no frosting needed), the other half I crumbled, combined with peanut butter frosting (recipe on this site) and made cake balls - Yum!

I started making this Banana Cake at 8pm. Cooked it for about 1hr and 10mins. because the middle part was still not done. Once i took out of the oven went straight to the freezer for 45mins. and i started making the frosting 20mins.before i took out of the freezer. It is now 11:30pm and I'm having a little piece of cake. Over all rating, its not too bad but I wouldn't say its the best cake ever but i will most likely make it again. The real critics here are my kids and husband, so I'll have to see tomorrow what they say if it's a keeper or not. Honestly, maybe i should have waited till tomorrow to make this not really sure if it was worth staying up this late for this cake but maybe I'll have a much better opinion tomorrow when i have it again for snack with a glass of milk.

It is very moist and I liked it a lot. I cut the sugar to 1 3/4 c in the cake and 1 1/2 c in the frosting. I'm glad I did. I think it would have been to sweet for me. I wish I had added cinnamon and some other spices and crushed walnuts/pecans to batter. Next time.

I thought this tasted good. I liked that the icing tasted more of cream cheese than sugar. It gave it a good balance as the cake was quite sweet. I was really surprised by the reviews that said it tasted like banana bread. Mine did not look or taste at all like banana bread. It was very moist. I am guessing they were comparing it to boxed cake mix, which is very spongy. I cut the recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8 square pan and got 9 pieces of cake. Even though, I also cut the icing amount in half I still used less than half of it. After icing the cake squares, I also topped them with chopped walnuts like the main photo.

Have a question on this one. Have you made it with two 9 inch round for a two layer cake? And do you garnish with anything else besides walnuts? My dads favorite and want to make it for his bday. Any suggestions would help! Thanks!

I have made this cake several different times with my nephews.  They and everyone else really like it!  It adds a fun component when we whisk it from the oven to the freezer!  The only thing I do differently is add a little more vanilla to the batter and frosting.  Lovely cake!

Best banana cake ever.  It took 20 minutes longer in my oven, but you just keep checking it til it's done, no problem.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I think we'll add some chopped walnuts.

This cake is wonderful.  I did have to bake it for 1-1/2 hours but I put it in the freezer when it was done like the recipe stated.  It was a big hit at dinner last night.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Cooking this for an hour??  Really??  Mine took 1 hr and almost 40 minutes to cook.  The icing???  WAAAYYY too much!!  I used (on a sheet pan) 1/4th of the icing.  I don't know WHO or WHAT would put that much frosting on a cake!!  That being said, yes it tasted good, like a very very moist banana nut bread without the nuts.  It was NOT something that I would have to tell everyone about.
I guess NOW that I know it is going to take an hour and a half to cook, then whip in the freezer for 45 minutes and make half of the icing, I am up in the air for making this again.  I mean was it really worth the trouble?

I'm not a huge banana cake fan, but OH--EM--Gee! This cake was awesome. The flavor really came through, and the cake was moist and light and delicious. I only used the cake recipe, which I paired with a peanut butter frosting from this site and they were a great combination.

Any cake with 831 reviews (mostly raves), desrves a try. What an awesome recipe. I used half the sugar, and it was perfect. I did bake it at 275 for an hour, then directly into the freezer. Can't wait for more ripe bananas. Thanks Cindy!

If you are looking for a banana cake recipe, look no further, you've found it!!  This recipe is the best banana cake ever, extremely moist.  I did have to bake it about 1 1/2 hrs, but it was worth it.  This cake is sooo heavy and moist, it is awesome!!

Super good, followed the recipe exactly and it is great.  Now I'm tempted to put all my cakes in the freezer for 45 minutes.  I cooked it for an hour exactly, tested it a few time before taking it out and the hour was perfect.  My oven thermometer read about 340.  I would take this to family dinner.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Yum! This is a great cake! Made this into a 3 layer cake, it is a bit delicate and I had to make and extra 1/2 batch of icing to cover the cake, it is so worth it! Topped the cake with crushed walnuts and have gotten rave reviews! The banana flavor is just right, almost like a light banana nut bread.

This a good cake but I made some adjustments.  Sorry for the 3*.  I cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and the sweetness was just perfect.  It would have been too sweet if I followed the recipe.  Next time I'll add more flour to it coz its kinna still wet in the middle after a long time in the oven.  And i did not do the frosting.  It was good by itself.

Love this recipe! Such a heavy moist cake. (I found that I had to bake it longer than the hour- but maybe that's just my oven and using an air bake pan)  I also made only a 1/2 batch of the frosting and found that to be plenty. I kept the cake in the fridge and served cold. Today, I will be serving it with cool whip instead of the cream cheese frosting.

Made this for a birthday cake for my mom.  Everyone loved it.  VERY moist.  I disagree with other reviewers and think it did have a banana flavor.  It was not too sweet but I made changes.  

Changes I made:
In place of the sugar.   I used 1 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of honey.

I added a half teaspoon of baking powder to help it be less dense (as that was a complaint from some reviewers).  

I used 4 bananas which equaled a little less than 2 cups.

Otherwise I followed the directions.  I did bake it for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  It did go in the freezer directly for about two hours (forgot it was in there).  I used the entire frosting amount.  Given I added less sugar I felt it would need it.  The frosting was perfect.

my cake did NOT fall in the center but it was DONE (toothpick was clean in center).

Oh I also did not use the mixer for the flour addition but folded the batter with a spatula so it would not turn out rubbery.  The cake was very moist, and I did NOT think it tasted like banana bread.  My husband actually said he wished our banana bread tasted more like this cake.

3 stars because the cake part tasted good, but the frosting was way too rich tasting for me and I will probably not make it again because of that. The frosting tasted like I was eating just sweetened butter...just too weird

Followed recipe exactly and cake was very good.  I did have to remove from the oven after about 40 minutes because it would have burned if I had left it in for the full hour!  Family and friends loved it...will make again!  Thanks, Cindy!

This was a good cake.  The only thing I did differently was add only 1 1/2 cup of sugar (could not add 2 1/8 cups - would have been to sweet).  I put a peanut butter frosting on but next time will use a white frosting - may put a little banana extract in it.

I was looking for a banana cake recipe for my daughters first birthday smash cake. (She loves banana) I can't believe I successfully made this cake! So moist and flavorful! I also used this recipe to make my sister's birthday cake on the same day using a giant cupcake pan made by Wilton. I honestly didn't think it would turn out with the low cooking temp combined with the very deep pan I was using but I was wrong. I did raise the temp to 300 degrees and ended up cooking the cake for 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect! I can't wait to see my daughter eat her cake and give my sister her giant cupcake that is both beautiful and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was unbelievably moist and delicious. Very easy to make. I used lemon juice in milk as a substitute for the buttermilk. Used a canned frosting because I was in a hurry. Cooled the cake in the refrigerator because my freezer was too full to fit. Will definitely be making this again soon.

Tastes fantastic! I did round cake pans instead of the 9x13 and doubled the frosting recipe. I also cooked it at about 300 for an hour and had no room in the freezer so I let it sit out to cool. But it was still moist and delicious! Amazing recipe!

This recipe was just okay in my opinion. The cake was quite dense in texture. I did however add walnuts to it, but I don't think that would have changed the density of it. It had more of a banana bread texture, than a cakeish texture.

Fantastic! I will make this over and over! I used 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar in the batter and reduced the powdered sugar in the frosting to two cups. Good without being overly sweet!

Very good moist denser type cake that is rich in banana flavor. Different and better than banana bread somehow. Bananas are sweet enough so I cut back 1/8 c. of sugar in the batter. For me the frosting was very sweet. Next time I will use a cream cheese frosting that uses more butter and a lot less sugar as the cake is sweet enough to better balance the taste. My cake also needed almost an additional 1/2 hour 
baking time. I sprinkled chopped toasted pecans after frosting all over the top. Delicious and very good cake.

I was skepital about this cake because of the temperature setting. This cake is FABULOUS!!!!! Yes you really do cook it at 275 degrees for 1 hour, then put in freezer for 45 minutes. My family loved it so much that I thought I would try it with another fruit instead of bananas. I made it with strawberries this time and it is really the most wonderful cake. Thank-You so much Cindy Carnes for sharing your recipe.

I've been baking for 20+ years and have made & tasted many banana cakes.  This cake is the *best* banana cake ever.  It has graced the birthday table for two family birthdays since discovering it a couple months ago.  Everyone that has tasted it also feels it is the best ever.  The recipe stands perfectly as is with no adjustment.

I accidentally added two cups of buttermilk, I put in another half cup of sugar to make up for it. Turned out great and I'll probably make it the same way again.

I made this cake for Father's Day and everyone loved it! It came out super moist with just the right amount of banana flavor. The only things I did differently were substituting light sour cream for buttermilk (didn't have any on hand) and cutting the powdered sugar down to 2 cups for the frosting. I will definitely make this cake again, but only occasionally, as it is a bit on the fattening side. Great recipe though!

I made this as a full sheet cake and it was amazing. I also added cocoa powder to a second one to make a Chocolate Banana Cake, that was amazing too. Totally different than banana bread, so moist and tender I will be making this again.

This is awesome. Followed recipe except that I added 5 mashed bananas - about 2 cups. Baked for about 1 hour and 5 minutes. I am at high altitude and didn't make any modifications and the cake came out perfect!!!  Frosted with fluffy peanut butter frosting and it was to die for!!!

This is a Family's FAVORITE! I fix it for Easter every year. Very, Very moist cake.
I do not use the Frosting that is here. I use Banana Butter Icing and that one work so much better, I think. Try it you will see.

This cake was awesome! Very moist and easy to make. I used 3 9" round pans. It was for  my daughter's birthday. She wanted a strawberry banana cake. I made this cake and put double strawberry ice cream between the layers, frosted it, then froze it. Held up wonderfully! Everyone loved it! It was so good, I had several bananas to use up, so I made a couple more cakes to keep in the freezer for when un-expected company comes! Freezes very well and stays super moist. Thanks!

This banana cake turned out nice, I like how fluffy it was.......but even though my cake baked for more than the time stated, it was still raw in the middle (for one of my layers).  I'm not sure if this is becase the banana gathered in the middle or what, but it wasn't very nice.  I'm also not too sure if putting these in the freezer right after baking did much, but they were very moist.  I will probably try this recipe again as a cupcake & see how that turns out, because the texture and flavor was nice besides that 1 hiccup.

This cake turned out phenomenal!! So moist and the banana flavor really came through. The only thing I did differently is I used less powdered sugar for the frosting. I ended up using about 2 cups because I like it a little less sweet. However the frosting came out SO light and creamy that it is now my go-to cream cheese frosting recipe! Next time I make it though I might bake it in a larger pan to make the cake thinner so it is easier to have out at a potluck. I might even try to make it into banana cupcakes!!

Very good!  It took much longer than one hour to bake.  Next time I would try baking at 350 to see if it actually makes a difference.

I would give this cake a 10 star review if I could. It was tasty, moist and like a cake not banana bread which was just what I was looking for. Excellent with the frosting and without. Kids, hubby loved it and I baked an extra to bring to a friend. I did end up baking it for about an extra half hour. Otherwise, my rating is based solely on the exact recipe.

Impressed with the cooking method....Didnt change a thing and mine rose beautifully and distributed heat perfectly but felt the frosting made up for the cake. I love a cake that's tasteful itself and not depend on a frosting so much. With that being said, I didn't taste too much of bananas as well; just subtle. I would say this was more like a pound cake/bread mix.

Outstanding! This has become the asked for dessert at holiday family gatherings. My sister first made this and the rest of the family now has the recipe. Make it just as written. Do not skip the freezer. It is moist and delicious!

I didn't have lemon juice so I used vinegar.  I also added a little bit of coffee to the bananas and reduced the sugar.

This cake was indeed acceptional!  It is really moist and has a great mouth feel.  Great for brunches (it's more of a muffin-y texture than a fluffy cake), desserts or coffee.
SECOND TIME COMMENT: I made this again and again, it's such a great cake.  This time I did not put it in the freezer and it really does change the texture of the cake.  The flavor is still wonderful, but it is a little drier and denser rather than moist and soft.  I added some banana cream pie I recipe's vanilla pudding/custard with some cut bananas in the middle layer and then put cream cheese frosting on top.  I think it would have also been good with some good whipped cream frosting.  there's a frosting recipe that has cream cheese and whipped cream.  That would have been good, too.

Other than using splenda for the sugar, I made this as written.  Strange directions (low temp/putting it in the freezer?!) but it worked!  Very good taste.  Mine made a 9x13 cake plus a small 7-inch round cake.  Thanks for sharing.

OMGosh this cake is YUMMY!!!  Strange directions but it works. And it makes a lot -- filled a 9x13 pan as well as a 6" pan. Very worth it!  Thanks for sharing.

I did substitute half the sugar with Splenda.  I followed the rest of the directions as instructed.  This was an outstanding cake.  I can't believe how moist, soft and tasty this was.  I made a 9x13 pan, but froze half of it.  After three weeks, I defrosted it under a cake cover, and it tastes as good as the first half did.  A keeper!

When I was a child my mom allowed us to choose our dinner and cake flavor for our birthday dinner.  I always chose banana cake with caramel icing for my cake.  When I tried this recipe I fell head over heals in love, love, love!  I have made this several times; both in bundt cake form and 9x13.  When I made it as a bundt cake I drizzled a caramel icing over the cake and also had it plain.  The cake is so delicious and moist that it easily stands alone without icing.  But with the cream cheese icing this cake is over the top delicious!  I recently discovered Saco Powdered Buttermilk and now I always keep it in the pantry.  I've made my own buttermilk with vinegar, etc. but this is much easier and I think it tastes better too.  I almost never buy buttermilk so keeping it in the powdered form insures I always have some on hand.  I just bought a bunch of blueberries and I plan to try to make a blueberry cake with this recipe.  I'll substitute the bananas for blueberries and a little nutmeg, and perhaps a bit more sugar since blueberries don't tend to be as naturally sweet as bananas.  This will be my go-to banana cake recipe forever!

I have used this website for years and read the reviews constantly before I cook something but have never left a review before! Well I had to because this cake was excellent! Made it for my daughters Birthday last night! It is unlike any cake I have had before- very dense but incredibly moist!!  My husband is very strict about eating sweets and rarely does but after I cut into it he even had a slice and said it was the best cake ever! I used two 9 inch cake pans and still had to cook it for 1 hr 20 min! I put banana cream pudding and fresh sliced bananas as a filling in between the layers as well!

This was the first time making this recipe and it was delicious and perfect. I did add 1-1 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour mixture and sprinkled chopped glazed walnuts over the cream cheese frosting. I took it to work and it was gone within hours. My husband who doesnt like banana bread said it smelt delicious and looked great, so I will have to make one for him soon.

This is not Banana Cake, it is banana bread. I would have to rate it comparing to other banana bread recipes and this just doesn't cut it! I made exactly as written, low temp..freezer, etc. It was mosist but bland. The banana crumb muffins on this site are FAR Better. I really agree with some of the other posters. I felt it is a really bland banana bread with frosting. Sorry but I will not make again....

This cake was so moist and delicious.  I was afraid to put it directly into the freezer for fear of cracking my glass dish.  Instead I allowed it to cool and then placed it into the freezer.  It still came out quite well.  Received many postitive comments

I have been on a quest to find the banana cake that is close to the Sara Lee cakes we used to get when I was a child. Having tried several of the recipes here, this is the closest I have found so far!  I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I added one teaspoon of baking powder in addition to the baking soda already listed in the ingredients. This was more like a cake rather than a lightened banana bread.   I agree with the others that said the frosting was sweet. I think I would try the whipped banana frosting recipe next time.   Thumbs up!

This delectable banana cake is a Definite keeper!!  My family’s not “big” on banana-anything & there were some complaining groans when they learned what I was mixing up but I figured I’d give it a shot, since I was in the mood for something light & sort-of sweet &….I don’t know, different, I guess!!  Found this, read the outstanding reviews & got right to work!   Of course, the first thing I did is cut back on the sugar & fat…just a bit tho.  I only used 1 stick of butter [1/2 cup] along with 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce & 1/4 cup ground flax-seed.  For the sugar, I substituted 1 cup firmly packed light brown sugar, as one reviewer suggested which, along with 4 bananas, the applesauce & double the vanilla, made the cake plenty sweet enough.  I don’t normally frost my cakes but since the sugar was cut down so much, I decided to give the icing a try & found it to be lovely & lightly sweet – although I did halve the recipe & had more than sufficient frosting.  Baking at 275° was a new scenario – the cake needed to bake a little while longer…more like 1:25.  The freezer trick was an interesting step as well that seemed to seal in the moistness without leaving the cake heavy at all.  To finish off after frosting, I dressed the cake up with a topping of crushed walnuts & mini-chocolate chips.   It looked beautiful, tasted divine & just over two hours after being cut, is now very nearly Gone!!!  My crew is won over - Way more than 5 stars, Cindy!  Thank you!!

Fabulous cake!  Just made it for the family and my picky husband even loved it...just the right amount of cream cheese frosting to cake...the crazy technique of putting it in the freezer right from the oven actually works!  Super moist and dense cake.  LOVED IT!  Only added cinnamon to the recipe for a bit more flavor.

I will be using this recipe from now on. I like it because it is tender and moist, with no dried-out corners or bottom. I did not use the freezer step, and it still tasted excellent. Like so many others, I found the baking time needed to be tweaked. I baked it at 275 for one hour, then at 300 for 15 more minutes. It turned out perfect. Next time I will cut the frosting recipe in half, and add some cream or milk to make it spread farther. The frosting is delish, but the amount overwhelms the cake.

This is truly the ultimate banana cake. I had to bake this an extra half hour extra because I was using a glass 9x13 dish.  ALso, ran out of buttermilk, so I substitute milk and lemon mixture instead -- worked out fine.  The frosting is just right.  Followed the recipe to the "T" and it turn out marvelous! Holds up well.

This is the first banana cake recipe I ever tried and I don't think I need to look for any other. It is sooo good! I made one for my sister in law for her birthday and my whole family loves it!  Remember to use the right size of pan! I use pyrex 9x13" and it turned out fantastic. About the baking time, I baked the cake about 1 hour and 20 mins. You should check your cake after 1 hour in the oven as different oven might have different result.  I only make half portion of the frosting and reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cup.  Also, I added in chopped walnut after I mixed in the mashed banana.  Very very good cake and easy to make!  LOVE IT!!!

OMG...this is the best.  My family loves this recipe....I thought it wierd to put in the freezer but whatever that does sure makes it a wonderful cake.  I do add about 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter just to give it that special touch but I would not stray from the original recipe.  This has come out perfect every time.  Those who think this is too banana tasting, my only comment is why are you making a banana cake?

This cake was excellent! My husband said it was the best cake I've ever made (and I've made a lot). I must say that I was skeptical about the baking temp and the time in the freezer, but tried it anyway. It was perfect and very moist, even the next day! I made 2 9-in rounds and made a 2 layer cake. The cake was so moist that the bottom layer had trouble supporting the top layer. I gave it some time in the fridge (about an hour) and it was ok. The frosting was very good, but a bit too soft. I added more powdered sugar, but it was still soft and wanted to slide off the sides of the cake. Next time I'll add more sugar to get a stiffer consistency. Definitely a wonderful cake!

Wow! This was a pain in the patootie to make, but well worth it! It is delish. Took way longer to cook than 1 hour. More like an hour & a half. It is very moist & delicious.

The flavor and moistness of this cake were fabulous, but I did have a couple issues. I followed the directions exactly, but after 45 minutes, the cake was not done. I let it bake for another 15 minutes, until it passed the toothpick test and put it in the freezer as directed. But after only a few minutes, the cake sank in the middle. I had a lot of bananas, so I tried it again with two round pans and I had the same result. It still tasted great, though. I served it with coconut cream icing instead of the cream cheese. The combination was heavenly.

I doubled the recipe to make a sheet cake and left out the nuts, I also didn't put it in the freezer.
This was fantastic!
A nice change from banana bread and fed a large group, very easy to make, the icing was a nice touch as well.
Does need longer to bake, 75 to 90 minutes.
I have started making this in a jelly roll pan, I use 4 bananas and it usually bakes 45 to 60 minutes, frost with Rick's Special Buttercream, always a big hit!
Everyone loves this recipe as muffins, I bake at 425 for 5 minutes, then 350 for 18 minutes, scaled to 12 servings, makes 12 large muffins, I used white whole wheat flour, halved the butter and sugar #10aday March challenge Allrecipes Allstars Canada

The cake was GREAT although I made little changes. (1) I didn’t have buttermilk, so I used milk instead. (2) I had ¼ cup butter, so I added ½ cup vegetable oil. (3) I added more than 1 ½ cup of mashed bananas, I just wanted to get rid of the plenty ripe bananas I had. (4) I baked the cake for 1hr 5mins it took long time to be ready. My mum LOVED it!!!

I really was disappointed in this recipe. I love banana cake so i was really excited and it turned out to be really heavy and dense. I followed the recipe exactly and I added some fresh banana to the top of the cake and some walnuts and still found it disappointing. 
I must say though that the frosting is delicious and that I will be using it for some other cakes that I make. 
If you like your banana cakes to be light and fluffy, do not use this recipe!

I gave this cake away so I didn't get to taste it - But I am giving it a 5 based on its wonderful smell and perfect appearance!  Can't wait to make one for my own family so we can taste it too!
It took about 15 mins longer to cook than stated

Followed directions, except used half frozen banana/ripened banana. This cake was supposed to go to my daughter's teacher as an end of school present but the cake felt really sticky and wet the next day. I wrapped it up in cling film and placed in the fridge and after one day it was INCREDIBLE. So delicious. This cake has to be put in the fridge for 24 hours before eating so that the moistness isn't leeched out through the heat of the day.

Good recipe! As with all recipes with buttermilk, I substituted vinegar mixed with milk and I added a box of banana pudding mix as another reviewer suggested. I didnt take as long as what it should have to bake and I didnt put it in the freezer at all. Turned out very moist and flavorful!

This is sooo yummy! I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar and half of that was brown sugar. I used skim milk with a little lemon juice in it for the buttermilk and only half of the frosting recipe. Baked for 65 min at 300 degrees. Skipped the freezer trick. You can chill the frosted cake and then cut and wrap in foil to freeze individual servings. Great for lunch boxes! If you've ever had Sara Lee's Frozen Frosted Banana Cake, this tastes just like it.

My family loved this cake.  It vanished in time.  Cooked at 290 degrees for nearly 90 minutes and it turned out perfectly.  
I'm making this one for the second time this week.

This is a great recipe. I did follow some recommendation like halving the sugar and adding in some chocolate chips. However, I dont know where I did wrong, but the texture of my icing was slightly lumpy. It tasted really good though.

Well - I liked this cake!   My husband ate one piece and claimed to like it but hasn't touched it since.  None of my three children liked it.  It tastes exactly like banana bread with cream cheese on it. I probably wouldn't make it again simply because it took a lot of effort and not enough people in this house liked it.  :)

Delicious! Made it exactly like the recipe says and it turned out AMAZING! It is very moist and the combination of the cake and homemade cream cheese frosting is to die for! I did have to bake it for 1 hour 15 minutes at 275 instead of 1 hour like other reviewers or else the middle would be uncooked. Otherwise, a very easy, delectable recipe great for parties or just for a snack!

This cake is awesome!  It's the best after it is cold.  My dad is a great cook and is kind of snobby about what he does and doesn't like.  We were so surprised when he asked for this recipe, because he usually thinks that his recipes are the best.

absolutely lovely, moist and very good banana flavour.  I used a bit of brown sugar instead of all white but forgot to leave butter out overnight so was creaming for ages (hint* leave the butter out)  I popped it in the microwave on very low setting for 1min and it was fine after that(another hint).  I wanted a layer cake so put it into two pans and it was fine, I also had a little extra so made a few cupcakes.  I topped it with a caramel frosting recipe I found on this site and I was sooooooo happy I did and so is my family .  Thanks for sharing.

This cake is absolutely awesome!!! I've made this three times now. It's so quick and easy to make, you can't go wrong! I hadn't baked in years when I decided to try this recipe...if I could get it right the first time, anyone can. I agree the freezer step is the most important...the cake is so moist...taking it to work again tomorrow!

The taste was good but it didn't taste too strong of banana. It took a long time for this to bake.  Longer than an hour.  And the pan almost overflowed.  Instead of the frosting on this recipe I mixed together a can of vanilla icing with a block of cream cheese.  It was good overall but it didn't blow me away.

This is a family favorite!  I cook it at 350 to save time and skip the freezer step (I can't imagine that putting hot cake into a freezer is good for the freezer & energy cost involved).  Sometimes I put it outside in winter, but I don't notice any difference.  I sometimes add chopped walnuts to cake and frosting.

My 5 year old and I made this cake this weekend and it turned out awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I put it into two loaf pans instead of a 9 x 13 (didn't have one).  We also added in about 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips.  I think I had to put the cakes in longer than the stated time - probably by another 20 minutes.  I guess it all depends on the oven.  The cakes turned out high and moist the first day and is still excellent today.  I followed the reviews for the recipe and only made 1/2 of the icing  - VERY GOOD and quite a lot of icing for both loafs.  We will definately be making this banana cake again!

Delicious, moist cake as promised.  I reluctantly agree however that the frosting was a little bit too sweet.  I may use a different cream cheese frosting recipe next time.  The cake recipe however, is a keeper.

This cake *eventually* came out delicious.  I nearly knocked it down a star because it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake, but the taste is just delicious.  I love icing, but this cake doesn't need any.  If I were to use any, I'd use a cream cheese icing put on thinly.

This is very good, and easy to make.  I did the freezer thing, which was a first for any cake.  I think the amount of frosting was too much, next time I would reduce that by a third.  Thanks.

Very good!  We actually liked it better without the icing, though.  It's a little too sweet for us!

What a recipe!!!  Even my son who said he doesn't like bananas loved the cake.  It is so moist and I can only attribute that to the 45 minutes in the freezer.  Delicious frosting also.  Will definitely make this cake again!!

I made this cake for Christmas Eve.  It was the best banana cake I have ever made! I did cut back on the powdered sugar for the frosting, and there wasn't a morsel left to be found!  Thanks for sharing this great receipe.

As mentioned in previous reviews, the cake takes a little longer to bake than the recipe indicates.  As far as the recipe itself is concerned, I wouldn't change one thing!  Excellent cake - this recipe will find a permanent home in my recipe file!

Yes, it's true.  This cake is good.  It's sweeter than banana bread and it's very moist.  I used the caramel frosting someone recommended (the kind you have to cook-- I also had to triple the batch) and it made the cake superb.

Tried this recipe for the first time and it was excellent.  I enjoyed the subtle banana flavor.  Because I had no buttermilk, I substituted plain yogurt and it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for a great recipe!

In the land of way too many bananas...well, make this cake!  The only problem is you have to wait a bit longer than normal while it sits in the freezer - but it's worth the wait.  I did _not_ make the icing - just used a store-bought chocolate one which was fine.  The cake even keeps pretty well, though at a certain point it gets hard (crunchy/chewy).

This is THE BEST!  I made this for my step-mother's 77th birthday...she said it reminded her of the cakes her mother used to make for her birthdays when she was a child.  This is the second year that I've made it for her...and I've shared the recipe with many who love this cake as much as my step-mother does.  AWESOME!!

This was a nice banana cake, the best one I have tried from this site so far. I used two large bananas and that was plenty. Not quite as light a cake as I am looking for so only 4 stars.

Truly outstanding!  Very moist and flavorful.  As many stated though, the cooking time and temperature is off.  I baked it at 325 for about an hour and ten minutes.  I would recommend adjusting the time and temperature.  Also, I did make the frosting per the recipe knowing it would make extra (and it did), but I plan on using leftover frosting to spread on graham crackers for the kids.  Excellent recipe Cindy!!

This cakes gets better every day it sits in the fridge! I used a whipped cream/cream cheese frosting instead (from this site, submitted by Tom Parker)because I knew it would be a dense cake and that a fluffier frosting would make it less heavy overall. I was afraid the cake would be a lot like banana bread, but other than a banana flavor, there was no comparison! Great way to use overripe bananas. I used 6 of them. Thanks Cindy!!

this cake has wonderful flavor.  Halved frosting like previous reviewers suggested and my hubby usually doesn't care for it.  First night, it rec'd 3 stars; after sitting overnight in the frig to chill really well...it rec'd 5+ stars and hubby said it would be even better with more of that scrumptious frosting....go figure!   He took 2 large pieces to work today for coffee bread.   Ours rose to 3" high!  Try this, you won't be sorry.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wonderful recipe. As a very typical young bachelor who rarely cooks, I was shocked when people came back for seconds and thirds of this cake. Didn't adjust the recipe at all, and it came out perfect.

Cake is delicious but I changed the icing to my own personal favorite.  Mine is still a cream cheese icing but a lighter icing.  This cake is so moist and good it could just have a dusting of powder sugar on top.  It did take about an hour and a half to cook.  Came out good and I will be making it again

If I could give this cake 20 stars I would. My daughter asked for a banana cake for her 6th Birthday and I found this one and read all the reviews. It was amazing! I followed the instructions just as listed except using all purpose Gluten Free flour instead. It had to bake a little longer. It was such a hit and I’m sure I’ll be making this cake more often.

Fantastic cake! I also thought the temp and then throwing it directly in the freezer was weird but it worked and it’s delicious!!! Great recipe! Instead of a 9x13 I used 8 inch square pans and stacked them. Yum!!

Made this as a layer cake. It was moist and fluffy and delicious! Next time I will do 3 layers instead of 2 and use 1 1/2. to 2 times the frosting.  A hint for making anything banana (cake, bread, etc.): use very ripe - nearly black- bananas to get the most flavor

Delicious and nearly perfect... my only small dislike was that it tasted really sweet to me. I think the sugar can be reduced, perhaps up to a half a cup less (depending on your taste). Also, I added spices and roasted walnuts to make it a traditional Banana Spice Cake: 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon cloves, and 1/2 tsp ginger. 1 c. sprinkled walnuts on top of the icing. 
The cooking time was just about right, though my cake needed an additional 5 minutes. The cake came out delicious and moist and I will definitely make it again!

Temperature and time are obviously way off.

This is a decent recipe *except* the cooking instructions.  Author stubbornly stands by them even with the chorus of corrections here.

Fact is, a 9x13 cake of this thickness will not be anywhere close to done when cooking at 275F for 1 hour.  I recommend reading a pro cake making book (Cake Bible, for example).  A calibrated oven near sea level altitude yields an internal temperature of around 150F after an hour at this temperature.  Internal temperature of a cake should be closer to 200F range.  I'd start with 1:30 cook time if you insist and cooking at this low temperature.

I'm not big on super sweet desserts so the frosting was too much for me. I've served this without any frosting with only rave reviews, so frosting really isn't necessary unless you're looking for store-bought super sweetness!   :-)

This was such a yummy cake. I had to portion out some pieces to stash in the freezer for later, otherwise I would have eaten all this cake right away. 

My notes / modifications:  I did have to leave this one in the oven a bit longer than an hour. In fact, after an hour, I turned off the heat and let the cake bake until it seemed to pull away from the edges (about 24 more minutes). Then it went in the freezer. 

When it was time for frosting, I opted for 1/2 cup more butter in the frosting, along with chai spices (ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, coriander). So good!

This was, by far, the best banana cake I've ever had or made! I was skeptical of the unusual baking method, but as the other reviews stated, it worked. Be patient. I've been baking for longer than I care to admit and have never made a cake this moist. I did make the following adjustments: 4 large bananas - no lemon juice - 2 cups white sugar &  1/4 cup brown - extra tablespoon of vanilla - had to bake 30 min longer. I also made a banana cream cheese frosting & topped with pecan pieces. AMAZING!! I'll definitely make again, especially if I need to bring something to a party. A perfect cake to impress.

Wow! This cake is amazing! This is the best banana cake I've ever eaten. The cake is extremely moist and rather dense in texture. The banana flavor really comes through nicely. The cream cheese icing complements the banana flavor nicely. I followed the directions exactly, other than adding slightly more mashed banana than called for. I had a bit extra and didn't want to waste it. I baked it in a pyrex pan, which usually cuts  down slightly on baking time, as the glass pan gets so hot. However, my cake still took about 1 1/2 hours to be done at the 275 degree temperature called for. I put it directly into the freezer for 45 minutes, as stated in the recipe and it was still slightly warm when I frosted it. No biggie, but next time if I want to frost it right away I will leave it in the freezer for a little longer.  A totally scrumptious cake! My whole family loved it! A keeper!

OH my goodness! What a WONDERFUL cake! It took mine MUCH longer to be done in the middle though. At least 25 minutes, maybe 30, I can't remember. But the cake (9x13) was so moist that it came out of the pan with not a crumb out of place. I didn't have buttermilk but shook up buttermilk powder with 1&1/2 c skim milk and it seemed to do the trick. Also I did not use the cream cheese frosting but a traditional butter cream frosting (1/2 c butter, 2 c icing sugar, vanilla, milk to make it the consistency you want and beat until smooth). We served it with butter pecan ice cream. Oh my! Oh my!

This is a great banana cake. Moist banana-ey perfection, but it is quite heavy (for those of you who prefer lighter cakes - this will not be the "one" for you). I am impatient and can't wait 2-hours for a cake to bake (which is how long it would take at 275), so I bake at 325 (still a low temp) and it is done after about an hour (check at 1-hour and then keep checking at 10-min increments until a toothpick comes out clean). When the cake comes out I let it sit for 15-min before transferring it to a non-metal container and THEN I put it in my deep freeze for 45-minutes. After the 45-min I put it into the fridge until I'm ready to serve it. Recipe ingredients are perfect as is, but you can also increase mashed bananas to 2-cups without a problem, and/or decrease the sugar to 2-cups, I also omit the salt as I use salted butter. I prefer to use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site for the frosting (instead of the one included with this recipe) as it's not as sugary-sweet.

Great recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing, I double the batch, as there is only two of us at home, bake in 5 small 8x8 tinfoil pans and freeze them with or without icing for a quick dessert when company shows up or to take when visiting friends. This cake freezes great! My go to recipe to always have dessert in the freezer.

So  moist! Usually after I eat one or two slices of banana cake I'm done.  But this cake makes you want to have more!  My family loves it as well.  I just used 2 cups of sugar and no icing.

I have baked this banana cake many times.  I have made it just as the recipe reads and it is delicious. Since we have high cholesterol and diabetes in the family, I have also made it with 1 1/2 c sugar and 5 egg whites instead of the 3 whole eggs and 2 1/8 c sugar, it is just as tasty. I never have frosted this cake.  As long as you do not over mix the flour into the wet ingredients you will get a perfectly moist, light cake.

Just made this recipe AGAIN for a family reunion!  Only 4 pieces left for us to take home to enjoy.  It remains one of our favorites. I think the low temperature and the 45 minutes in the freezer are the key to its success and great ratings!

I was reluctant to make this cake because I didn't have room in my freezer. I decided to go for it and put it in the fridge after the oven instead. This cake couldn't be more moist (for the record, I HATE that word). Either the fridge does the same for the cake as the freezer does, or either doesn't do anything. I made it as a layered cake with 2 round pans. The icing was enough to fill inbetween the cakes and ice the entire outside. I'm thinking of altering this sometime and adding in crushed pineapple with the banana and adding coconut to the icing....voila..piña colada cake:)

I made this as a three layer cake in 3 round pans. Baked for only 40 minutes instead. Turned out great!

April 28, 2015 

Thank You, Cindy. Thank your friend for me. I tried many recipes for Banana Cake and this has been the best. I set my oven to 300 degrees even though you stated 275 since my oven runs cold. Baked my cake 1Hr 25Mins. I was afraid the glass pan would crack. So I waited 20 Mins before I put the cake into the freezer. The cake was very moist and delicious! Simply the best!!! Taffy

I left out the lemon juice and used store bought cream cheese frosting. Holy cow! Best. Cake. Everrrr.  Followed everything else to a T. Yes I am pretty sure it's the best cake I've ever made. Not that I am the Cake Queen or anything,  but I've made my fair share in nearly fifty years on the planet. Bf can't keep his hands off it.  Don't know how anyone is ending up with something that resembles Banana Bread? Looks and tastes nothing like it. This little lovely is so lite and fluffy and CAKE like, there is no chance of mistaking it for banana bread which is dark and heavy and dense.  I did have to bake it for about 15 extra minutes. So worth every minute!!! Yummmm 
Oh and I used four medium ripe bananas. Thanks for sharing!!

Loved this cake!  I had three over ripened bananas to use up and this was the perfect recipe for them.  Such simple ingredients!  I did bake my cake an extra 15 min.  The center was still mushy at just an hour.  Also, I just couldn't bring myself to put that hot cake in my freezer with all my frozen stuff.  But after it cooled off I kept it in the fridge.  I love cold cake!  I frosted it with pre-made cream cheese frosting because I guess I got lazy!  The family loved it, so that makes it a keeper in my book :)

I loved this recipe.  It turns out super moist.  The kids liked it better without the frosting...easier for me.  One less thing to whip up.  I have made this 3 times now and every time it turns our AMAZING

YUM!!!!!!!! It did take about 10 min more in my electric oven, but it turned out great. I used a loaf pan and a 9" square pan instead of 9x13. I had one at home for the family (it's almost all gone and was eaten hot). The other was taken to work following the directions through to the freezer. The cakes were moist, light goodness. It was well worth the wait!

This really truly is an excellent Banana Cake.  I doubled the recipe and baked it for my daughters 14th Birthday.  I think there were 28 people and I had nothing but raved reviews.  The only thing that is a concern for me is that I recently completed a food safe course where we were instructed to NEVER put anything hot into the freezer as it lowers the temperature of the entire freezer, resulting in improper cooling of the freezer contents.  We learned that 30 percent of Foodborne illness outbreaks are due to improper cooling.
My only suggestion then would be to place the cake in a cooler (or even a sink filled with bagged ice or ice packs covered with a towel so nothing leaks into the cake.  I would then be able to give this recipe 100 percent just like it deserves!

Very good! I followed the recipe (low heat and freezer time) and the cake is very moist with a terrific banana flavor. I halved the recipe to make an 8 x 8 cake and used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Stevia. I will make this again

I tried this recipe twice and it was delicious both times. The cooking time took 90 minutes, not 60. About three weeks after the second time I made it, our freezer was leaking water. I discovered a sheet of ice under the freezer trays and I believe this occurred because of the cake going immediately from oven to freezer. I was able to resolve the problem by carefully removing the ice but will not make this cake the same way again.

This was an epic failure.  After one hour at 275 degrees, this cake was RAW (like in jiggly) in the middle.  I had to give it another 15 minutes at 350 in order to get it to firm up.  The extra cooking time dried it out. I also tried 45 minutes in the freezer.  My end result? dense, somewhat chewy cake. I will admit the flavor was good, though

I followed the recipe exactly, including baking at 275 degrees. The middle of the cake was still runny after one hour, so I ended up leaving it in for a total of almost two hours. The banana flavor was very good. The cake is a little dense, but did not taste like banana bread to me. I used a 9X13 pan as prescribed, which caused the cake to be quite thick (about 2.75 inches tall). I used a metal Circulon cake pan and wonder how the composition of the pan (such as metal versus Pyrex) affects the cook time and final product. Most reviewers have not commented on this detail. My husband, who is not a big fan of bananas but loves sugar and sweets, liked the cake but would have preferred a shorter, sweeter cake with more icing (I only used 1/2 of the icing that this recipe made). I would definitely make this again. Next time I will probably make cupcakes.

This tasted like a great banana bread minus any nuts. It was really good and we used our own cream cheese frosting recipe to pair with this. We followed the recipe, however, we used 9 x 9 pie pans and made a double cake. We had it on 275 as suggested and cooked for 30mins extra due to it still being raw. We then popped them in the freezer! It is really soft and moist. Thank you for the recipe!!

One of the best cakes I have ever eaten and my family agreed.  We are a family that loves deserts and this was loved by all.  I was short on time so I increased the temp to 325 and baked about 40 min, the cake was so  moist I can't imagine it being any better!  The icing was delicious and made the exact amount to frost the cake.  I had 3 large bananas, don't know if that is more or less than 1.5 cups but it was perfect.  Can't wait to make this cake over the holidays for my son who loves anything banana. I can't imagine anybody not loving this cake.  There were several comments about this being more like banana bread, keep in mind it would be impossible to make a light airy cake using fresh bananas.

This was surprising good and easy. Only substitution was used Stevia instead of sugar due to dietary restrictions. Wouldn't fit in the freezer, so skipped that step. Still turned out very moist. I think the left-overs (if there are any!) need to be refrigerated due to the cream cheese icing. Of course added chopped walnuts to the top which compliments the cake/icing.

I have been making banana cake for 50 years. Last Sunday was my son's birthday and since banana is his favourite I decided to try a different recipe. AMAZING ! We were 5 adults and 4 kids - leftovers? - you must be kidding! Any Changes ? Yes : I was short of time and instead of 275 I put the oven at 300 .I am glad I did because it took an hour and 20 minutes instead of an hour for the toothpick to come clean.
Would I try it again ? YES! YES ! YES!

My daughter and I made this cake exactly as written and it was phenomenal!!!  Worth 5 stars because the directions were clear and the cake turned out as expected.  The only thing I might change next time is decrease the sugar a bit in the frosting.  Or maybe not - it was SO GOOD!!!

I made this recipe twice in the last month (and making it again right now) and everyone raves about it! I made it exactly as instructed and it comes out moist and delicious. I made a banana foster rum sauce to pour over the top when serving and it's just amazing. This is the recipe everyone asks for now!

UPDATE: I have made this several times. I swear I've never changed a thing, but the last few times it didn't turn out as the light fluffy cake texture, but as a denser banana bread texture.  Still delicious, but not the miraculously scrumptious cake it was those first couple times.  If you try this, just know that it can be incredible!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have to say wow! fixed exactly per zany directions.  I had to try the strange baking/freezing method and I learned why this is called banana cake and not bread; it is sooo moist and fluffy it sticks to the knife and is tricky to serve without falling apart.  This will be excellent served post meal with coffee.  I mashed the bananas until I had the 1 1/2 cups and it has the most wonderful banana flavor without any soggy spots. It needed to bake an extra 15 minutes in my notoriously slow oven to pass the toothpick test.  I made the frosting with only 3C of powdered sugar because that's all I had. it turned very light and creamy, but it tasted so sweet I served it separate, but the flavor blended so well with the cake it was perfect and everyone loved it.  I am blessed with some finnicky eaters without a single sweet tooth among them, but everyone RAVED about this!  Cindy thank you so much for sharing this excellent recipe with unique cooking method, it's definitely a keeper!

I thought this cakes was amazing!  For the caked I used 9X9 round pans as I wanted a dessert that could be presented on a pedestal cake platter. I baked as directed in the low temp oven and placed in freezer directly after baking. I didn't want a cream chesse frosting so I mad a Bavarian Creme frosting to place between the layers and on the top of the cake. Absolutely delicious and my husband has requested that I please make it again soon.

If I could rate this higher I would.  I've made this many times and seriously you won't find a better banana cake recipe than this one.  I use my own frosting recipe so I'm just rating the cake itself.    I've tossed all my other banana cake recipes.

absolutely fabulous!! made these into CUPCAKES for my husband's 40th birthday party (frosted with cream cheese icing from here), sprinkled with sparkling sugar crystals and they looked and tasted absolutely AMAZING!!! everyone wanted the recipe.
i baked for 30 minutes (same temp), then directly into freezer (i kept frozen until i was ready to frost the day of the party).  i've made this recipe as a cake many times, but now it will be my go-to for cupcakes.  truthfully, they don't even need frosting!

I made this cake yesterday...wow really moist and delicious! I followed the recipe. My only change was that I did not put this in the freezer as recommended. I baked it @ *325 for 55 min. Wonderful flavor, and super moist. I will be making this again for sure.Thank you for sharing this banana cake recipe. Kat

I have never loved a cake so much to actually take time to review it. Bless you Cindy Carnes. Not only is this cake amazing, it puts all banana bread recipes to shame too. The only teeny change made, after giving it a little taste test, was adding just a splash more vanilla into the frosting. Other than that I followed each and every instruction right down to the letter. My cooking time at 275 was an hour 20 min. I even pinned this!!!

Amazing!! Super easy to make. I followed the cook time and the cooling in the freezer and it came out very light and moist. I am not sure if this makes the difference but I am interested in trying this method with other cakes and see the outcome. It is an great recipe. If you use the 9X13 pan, it was exactly an hour cook time for me. The only changes I made are I put in a 1.5 cups of sugar instead of the 2 1/8. I try to cut out a lot of sugar in most baked recipes for my taste and it still tasted sweet. Thanks for posting. It is delicious.

I made this cake without any changes.  I put it into two 8X8 pans.  One went in the freezer and one on the counter.  Both were incredible!  This cake is delicious.  And the frosting is yummy and perfect for it, however, the cake is so good plain, I didn't use the frosting after I made it. It just didn't need it.

Delicious! The only modification I made was to slightly reduce sugar to 2 cups. Mine needed a bit more time in oven, about an hour I think until the toothpick test showed it done. I removed from oven straight to freezer as instructed. The cake turned out super moist, often when a cake is moist, it has an underdone texture, but not here, just moist and delicious! I did not frost, as we don't like overly sweet things. I felt it didn't need frosting anyway. I opted to store in fridge because of its moistness, and honesty, I like it chilled even better! Thank you for this recipe submitter Cindy!

Very moist banana cake! I used two bananas. I left it in the oven for about an hour and ten minutes. I covered it with foil and put it in the freezer for 45 minutes.  There were definitely parts of the cake that were still warm after the 45 minutes, but I really wanted to go to bed so I threw it in the fridge for the rest of the night and it turned out great. 

I did not get a chance to make frosting for this cake but it was really great without the frosting too.

This cake is all it's cracked up to be. I followed the cake recipe with just a few adjustments: (1) for half of the flour, I substituted whole wheat flour; (2) for half of the sugar, I substituted brown sugar; (3) I used white vinegar mixed with milk instead of buttermilk (1 1/2 T vinegar, plus milk to equal 1 1/2 cups, then let sit for 10 minutes); and (4) I added 1 tsp orange zest. Following the baking instructions, it took 75 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean. The freezer thing felt weird, but I did it, and I wouldn't do it any other way in the future. The cake was so moist and delicious! There is no doubt in my mind that I will make this again. My husband and I both loved it!

Since I was only doing a 13x9 cake, I halved the frosting recipe, and that was just the right amount. I'd only do the full frosting amount if I were doing a layer cake.

This is the best cake ever!  Don't change one thing when making it and it will come out perfect.  With my oven, I have to cook longer--make sure your toothpick is clean!  Finally, a cake that my daughter enjoys and asks me to bake for her.

When I have ripe bananas that I want to use instead of tossing out, I usually make a banana bread. I never think about a cake. Came across this recipe today while looking for something to do with the bananas.
Seemed easy and I happened to have cream cheese for the frosting.
I followed the cake recipe exactly..something I seldom do which causes my family to roll their eyes. Actually, it is funny when you see great reviews..and then the writer mentions all the things they changed and substituted. Nevertheless, family will be surprised that I did not change a thing.  As for the frosting, I halved the recipe, as per suggestions from other reviewers.  It was plenty.  Cake is moist but not heavy. It's just sweet enough to be a cake rather than a bread. Delicious! Just enough frosting for extra richness. (Bet it would be good with chocolate chips or blueberries.) This recipe is a keeper, just as is.

tastes like banana bread, almost better eating it with butter.  took much longer than an hour to cook in my oven, almost 2 hours.   not bad at all, but also not fantastic.

I just finished making this cake for the second time in less than a week.  It is FABULOUS!!  I did not have buttermilk either time, but subbed in 1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar then filled with milk up to the 1 1/2 cups and let thicken for 5 minutes.  The first time I underbaked it, even at an hour and 15 minutes, as evidenced by the fact that a rectangle in the middle collapsed in the freezer, but NOBODY complained. This time, I baked it for an hour and a half and it came out perfectly!!  Since I did not take the cake out of the pan (will be serving it straight from the pan), I had a little over a cup of leftover frosting, but I am sure I can find a use for it!  THANKS for a MARVELOUS recipe!!  No other banana cake recipes for THIS girl.

This cake is a show-stopper. My family loves it. I agree with all of the other posters that the cooking time and temp and the freezer bit --crazy as it all seems-- is entirely accurate and is the secret to the cake's rich flavor and moistness. I like to substitute whole wheat flour for half of the flour. I also use four bananas. Whatever you do, DON'T forget the lemon juice. I did this the third time I made it and the cake came out flat as a pancake. I thought it was there to keep the bananas from browning (duh!). Also, I use the cream cheese frosting plus a caramel drizzle in a zig-zag pattern over the iced cake. I use this recipe with only half to three-quarters of the powdered sugar. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/caramel-frosting-i/detail.aspx

husband gave it  a 9 out of 10.  He said very rich and he can only eat small portions at a time.  I might use a different frosting the next time to tone down the richness.  Like use a recipe that calls for 3 oz of cream cheese versus the 8 oz

I remember banana cakes being popular when I was a kid and haven't had one in AGES.  Was looking for something to do with browning bananas other than banana bread and this came up.  What GREAT memories it brought back!  This cake was wonderfully moist, not too sweet, and the frosting was the perfect match to the cake.  Would not change a thing.

By the way, this cake freezes BEAUTIFULLY.  If you have leftover bananas that will be tossed soon, make up this cake, and when it is cool, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and freeze.  Frost it when thawed  (or even almost thawed - cold cake will preserve the cream cheese frosting a bit).  I made the cake in a 10" round pan, and froze the round cake.  When I had last minute guests coming, I pulled it out, let it on a footed cake plate and frosted it with the icing in the recipe.  It looked lovely, and the flavor was rich without being over-the-top, and everyone loved it.

I made this cake for my husband's office and it got rave reviews! Follow the directions as crazy as they may seem. Also, the icing makes a lot but don't hesitate to put it all on. It's such a nice balance with the cake. I sprinkled the top with walnuts. It was awesome.

I made this recipe for the first time last night, and I have never had more ooooohs and aahhhhs over a cake before.  The unusual baking method was worth every minute---I had to cook it an extra twenty minutes in my Miele oven.  I bravely put the hot cake into the freezer nestled on a tray and padded with a folded dish towel underneath, and I closed the door and hoped for the best.  Forty-five minutes later, I took the cake out, and it was perfect and my other frozen goods had remained frozen since I cleared an area around the cake.  I followed the directions for the frosting, but I cut down on the amount of confectioner's sugar so it would have a very creamy consistency.  When I served it to our guests, I put a bowl of finely chopped pecans on the table for anyone who wanted to add a crunch to the topping.  I ended up giving extra pieces to my guests to take home, and I know this will be one of those cakes that I take to parties or give to friends who are home bound.

I thought the recipe itself was good but the baking was a little off. I used 1 baking pan instead of two and the batter was dripping off the pan and into the oven. I had to adjust the temperature to 325 so it would bake faster because it wasn't done in an hour. I'll might make it again but I would definately use two baking pans instead of 1.

I used this recipe to make my daughter's wedding cake. The cake baked perfectly at the 275 degree temp. I used an oven thermometer to make sure the temp. was accurate. It didn't have an overly browned bottom as some banana cake recipes that I've tried. It was nice and level on top, without a dome. I believe the 275 degree baking temp. was the key to my success. I extended the baking time by about 15-20 minutes. I doubled the recipe and got two 9" layers, two 6" layers and one 10" layer. I cooled the layers in the pans for ten minutes then dumped them out of the pans and put them in the freezer according to the directions. This has to be the best banana cake we have ever tasted. Very moist.Everyone loved it. I will definitely be making this again.

OMG!!Ok, seriously, I took this cake into work today and to say EVERYONE loved it is an understatement!! I am at work now just getting back from lunch but had to take a minute to write this. I was not liked very much because my co-workers [and I] are always diet-conscious but, oh well!! I'm going to the gym today! I will throw my other banana cake recipe in the trash and print muultiple copies of this one for safe keeping!! First, the batter itself is addicting! You may think that 3 cups flour is alot but it is not. This is a dense cake and it should be. I followed the directions exactly using a glass baking dish because it is what I have in that size, except for round/square Wilton pans, and I wanted to see how the glass baked. Because of the glass, it took 1 hr, 44 mins. to cook, which was ok. I covered it with plastic wrap asap and put the whole thing in the freezer until the next morning--made the frosting [but added a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice to spike the flavor of the cream cheese icing]!! OMG!! I will make this for any event that I can but WILL NOT make it just to have around. This is sinful!!You have GOT to try this! But be warned!!!  PERFECTION!!

This was exactly what I was looking for. It taste similar to banana bread but it's cake! And a moist cake at that. I just took some advice from one of the other reviewers, when making breads the mixing is usually a minimum so I mixed this recipe very well at every step because I wanted to make sure I had a fluffy cake texture. I made three 8" round cakes (ate one plain and frosted the other two ;p )and that took about 50 minutes. I used a Bavarian flavored whipped cream as my frosting and it was delicious. I am definitely keeping this recipe. Thanks Cindy!

This is an amazing recipe. The cake turned out moist, with a great texture and very tasty. I modified it so that it was non-dairy by substituting vanilla soy milk mixed with 4 tsp of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk (I used vanilla soy milk because I happened to have it already open in the fridge). I didn't measure out the 1 1/2 cups of bananas, but instead used 2 medium sized over ripe ones which was the motivation for me looking for and making this cake. Finally, I only used 1 1/4 cups of sugar because 2 1/8 seemed way to sweet for me. I didn't bother with the frosting. In all other respects I followed the recipe faithfully and it turned out perfect even at the low temperature it specified. It was well worth the effort (not that you need much to make this).

It was just great. I did minor modifications following advices in other reviews: 1/2 cup less sugar for the cake mix, since I thought the frosting would be already too sweet. It ended up to be true: the cake was just a little sweet, but it balanced great with the frosting. I also added chopped, lightly toasted nuts on top of the frosting, and it just tasted amazing. I'll take it to the office to share it there, if I leave it at home it won't last long - and I live alone!

This is my husband's favorite cake! Follow the baking directions exactly. You won't regret it. I have been known to throw in extra banana just to use what I have. I can't comment on the frosting because I usually top it with a Nutella buttercream. The cake is extremely moist so sometimes I eat it without any frosting :)

I'm giving this cake 5 stars b/c everyone loved the end result.  However, since there are so many great reviews, I know that the incidents leading up to the finished cake were my fault.  I recently moved & have limited cookware.  I had a glass 9x13 dish that I baked this cake in, and I didn't take into account that it might take longer to cook.  So, after an hour I removed the cake, did the toothpick test (it was clean) and put directly in the freezer.  After 45 mins, I removed the cake and the middle was sunk in b/c it wasn't done after all.  After a couple of times trying to rebake it, I removed the outer edges (that were done) and cut them into squares and placed in a glass bowl, smothered w/a layer of frosting and repeated until I reached the top.  My parents and family said it was amazing & they loved it.  My mom requested this cake for her b-day.  With that said, I will make this again for my mom, I won't use glass & hopefully the result will be better.  If not, I will do the layering again, lol.  The cake did have a wonderful flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my first banana cake and I followed the recipe exactly. Boy am I glad I did! This is so moist and I also added 1 can of royal anne cherries chopped fine, also added very fine chopped almonds on top of icing. Also made a bunt cake and cooked 1/2 hour longer as it was a very thick cake. This is the best cake Ihave ever eaten. Family went nuts over it.

I loved this recipe. I was worried about the low temp and straight to the freezer as we'll, but I followed the recipe to the dot and very happy. I had to leave it in the oven an extra 40mins but that is probably just my oven. I substituted the nuts on top with Shaved chocolate. Very impressed and will make this again. Thanks for sharing :)

I made this for Thanksgiving. Followed the recipe without making any changes at all. It made 3 8 inch layers. It was out of this world! Made it a 2nd time for a work Christmas party and again it was off the chain. I had to bake it in advance and let it freeze in the pans and then took them out and wrapped them tight with plastic wrap and kept the layers frozen until I was ready to ice them. Perfect cake!

This was fantastic!!!  It really was very moist!  I usually try to get rid of leftovers when we have cake, 'cause I have no willpower - but my husband forbid it!  The only changes I made was to use cake flour (1 c + 2T for every cup of all purpose) and change the 2 1/8 c white sugar to 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. Also per one review, I baked it on 300 since I do not have a convection oven and it came out perfect in one hour.  Very, very good!!  I made 1 and a half recipes and made 2 9" round layers with the cream cheese frosting in between (none on top or sides).  This made two tall layers - perfect!

Seriously...r u kidding me?? I've never had such a deliciously moist banana cake in my life! Everyone in my family is an ardent chocoholic, not to mention the kids, who eat no dessert except those that are brown and taste like chocolate. But for this cake,there was a huge ruckus about who got to eat more and who got less after it was gone, which was soon after it was made by the way. I recommend anyone who stumbles upon this recipe to give it a try. I halved the recipe but added a whole cup of mashed bananas, although I baked it at 375 degrees coz 275 was doing nothing to it, every oven is different I guess. Do keep it in the freezer right away, it made all the difference, was excellent even without the frosting. It was heaven on Earth....I can die already!

Well mine became soggy :( even though i followed the instructions to a t. Perhaps the guideline temperature indeed relates to a convection oven. Ended up baking over 2 hours, and the result was pretty soggy although the cake was ready. The frosting is too sweet, wish I'd used more cream cheese and less sugar. Glad others are seeing a better result!

I absolutely love, love, love this cake.  I didn't expect it to turn out right because, to begin with, I did not have buttermilk.  I had to make my own using whole milk and fresh lemon juice.  Also, I thought baking this at 275 would take forever but that was not an issue either. It did take longer than the one hour, stated in the recipe (mine took an additional 15 mins and it all depends on your oven's heat).  If the ingredient's measurements are followed to a T, this recipe is foolproof!!!  Finally, taking the cake out of the oven and placing it directly into the freezer must have worked because the cake was very soft and moist as predicted in the instructions.  I wonder if the oven-freezer method works for all cakes.  Nonetheless, my family thoroughly enjoyed this cake.

Excellent recipe! I halved it and used an 8x8 pan and baked for only 40min (my oven runs hot). This is by far the tastiest way I've used slightly overripe bananas!

I almost always adjust recipes per the reviews, but I followed these instructions to the letter. And I'm glad I did because Oh. My. GOD this is good. It took 75 minutes in the oven, but that may be because I used more bananas (two countertop overripe plus four overripe ones from the freezer). And my husband gave me the weirdest look when I stuck the pan in the chest freezer. Totally worth it! Moist to the point of gooeyness. It probably will stay moist for several days ... if it lasts that long.

Absolutely Amazing!!!  This cake is flavorful and moist.  Honestly, I wouldn't change a thing.  I will definitely be making this again.  Overall bake time for me was one hour and fifteen minutes, and then it went straight to the freezer for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect.

well, this smells really good, followed the recipe completely, but used some extra bananas, and used half cup less sugar, and since i dint have buttermilk, used half cup of yogurt mixed with i cup of water. lovely.

I SO love this recipe!  I followed a few recommendations from reviews: used half the sugar in the cake, added an extra medium banana, creamed the sugar and butter for five minutes in my stand mixer, sifted the dry ingredients, baked for one hour at 300, and only used one cup of confectioner's sugar in the frosting.  It.  Was.  Amazing.  Thanks so very much for this absolute keeper!

Better than banana bread! I had to bake 15 additional minutes, and the only change I made was I used only a little over 2 cups of confectioners sugar because I like to taste the cream cheese tang and not gaggy sweet icing.  Highly recommend this, you won't be disappointed!

I followed the recipe to the letter and it delivered one of the best cakes I've ever made. It did need 25 minutes additional in the oven, but that wasn't a huge deal to me. Very simple to make and absolutely delicious, even for someone like me that wouldn't typically eat a banana cake. I don't see where you can go wrong if you stick to the ingredients. My husband took it to work and it was devoured before lunch. I've already been asked to make another one. Thanks for sharing, Cindy!!!

Loved it!! Hubby wanted to eat half of it. Modifications: Used Splenda instead of sugar, and vanilla honey Greek yogurt (and a half cup of skim milk) instead of buttermilk. Topped with fresh berries instead of frosting.

Very yummy.  A bit on the sweet side so it you tend to like things a little less sweet cut down on the sugar.  However, my family loved it!

This cake turns out moist and so delicious.  Everyone I served it to raved about it.  It was awesome the day it was made and 2 days later was still great and moist.  I didn't have time to do the freezer trick as I wanted to get to bed so I baked it at 300degrees for just over an hour, then inverted it and let it cool overnight on the counter.  It was still perfect.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except had to use lemon juice in skim milk b/c I didn't have buttermilk, and I used whole wheat flour b/c that's all I had.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

I loved this recipe, it is so full of flavor. I did put toasted walnuts in the batter, because my family likes the walnuts and the bananas together, but it could taste good without it. I did not do the frosting for it, and I can say, this morning cake was wonderful. Looking to do it again.

Excellent!  Super moist and light!  I made it exactly as written except I had to make my own buttermilk (milk & lemon juice) and added chopped walnuts on top.  My baking time turned out to be about 10 minutes longer before toothpick came out clean.

Tried this the day I baked it and was not crazy about it at all. However, i tried some the next day and it was everything everyone said it was. Super moist,and delicious. I guess I just needed t wait a little longer t let that banana flavor fuse in there. Everyone loved it, and will be on my favorite recipes list!

terrific.  I baked this and the Extreme Chocolate Cake by RACH56.  I assembled them both into a layer cake, with the cream cheese icing between the 4 layers, and the chocolate icing on the outside.  

Soooo good

I too made my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar and made them into cupcakes.They baked for just over an hour(rotating the trays from top to bottom rack) and came out super moist.I made a caramel buttercream frosting to create a banana's foster-ish taste and they could have won cupcake wars hands down.I have 6 friends willing to pay for a dozen of these!!

Outstanding!!!! I have a tendency to overbake sometimes.  This cake came out sooooo moist.  I used it for my last cake decorating class and it was a hit. The best banana cake I have ever had.  I thought the freezer thing was a little weird, but this made the cake super moist.  Definitely a keeper!!! Thank You.

This was by far the best banana cake recipe I have ever had.  275 deg. was definitely the correct temp.  I wonder if putting any cake in the freezer for 45 minutes would make them all so nice and moist?  I'm gonna try it. - Kate

Fantastic...nice moist texture, just right Banana flavour. Like many other cooks here, I was hesitant at first reading the unusual baking and cooling instructions. I'm glad I took the chance & made the recipe.... Like others I had to add about 15-20 min to the cooking time. (and I had just had my oven temp checked for accuracy about a week ago, so I know my oven temp is correct) But thanks to Allrecipes I had reviews to read prior to baking the cake, so I expected I'd have to adjust the time. The Cream Cheese Frosting is to die-for too...
This will be the only Banana Cake recipe in my arsenal of recipes from this day forward...Thx Cindy Carnes & Allrecipes.....

A very moist, dense cake that yields delicious results.  The cooking method is odd, but it works! The first time, I made it in the 9x13 pan and used only half of the recipe for the frosting. The second time I made a layer cake using 3 - 9" pans and baked for 50 minutes, then frosted with the full recipe amount. I had to rush it to a get together. Yums by all!

Fabulous cake!  Took longer than one hour, about 1hr 20min at 275.  Not sure if I filled the pan too high, but it overflowed.  Didn't matter though, I just put a cookie sheet underneath and kept going.  So glad I didn't stop, the results were delicious if not pretty!  Would have given 5 stars if not for the extra time required.  Yum.

I made this (following the recipe exactly) for a banquet and everyone loved it.  I was skeptical- even after reading the many 5 star reviews- but decided to give it a go because I like trying unconventional methods.  Best. Banana. Cake. Ever!  Well balanced flavor and super moist.  I did have to bake it just a little longer than the recipe called for but that could be an oven thing, not a recipe thing. The standard cream cheese frosting is a good compliment to the cake, but makes way too much for my taste.  A little goes a long way and I think if I had used all the frosting it would have overwhelmed the cake.  Do not hesitate to try this; you will not regret it!

Found this recipe this morning, I made it this morning, as I had all the ingredients at home.  Had 'naners' that needed to be used.
I must say I followed the instructions, recipe as listed.  I DID put it in the freezer for 45 minutes then put the 'frosting' on.  It is awesome...makes a beautiful big 9 x 13 cake.  Try it, you'll love it. too, I'm sure.  So moist and good!!!

I just got done frosting this cake and had to take a bite because it smelled so good! It is amazing! I made it exactly as the recipe stated, adding about 10 minutes to the bake time. Turned out wonderful. Now I have to go find people to give it to so I dont eat it all!

I must say that this is definately a keeper, It was very, very moist. I followed the recipe to the tee and it was perfect.The only thing I would do differently is I would line my baking tin with waxed paper this would help in releasing it due to it being so moist....Great recipe!

I just finished making this and...YUMMMM!!! I followed most of the directions only changed a few things. I used 1/2 cup of melted butter and 1/2 cup of oil to cream with the sugar and only used 2 cups of sugar. Also made my own buttermilk with vinegar and milk. This cake has rave reviews from my husband and I as well as our neighbor whose house I baked it at (our oven isn't working right now). Super moist, the freezing sounded weird to me but the end result is DELICIOUS so dont question it, just do lol. The Baking time was longer than an hour but after reading the other reviews I expected that so I didn't time it just check it every so often and busied myself with other things. Will Make again with walnuts and chocolate chips!!! :) Thanks for sharing!

I love the flavour and texture of this banana cake, its very moist and you can taste the banana in it.  Mine took about 1 hour and 10 minutes to bake.  Next time I might reduce the sugar, there was so much it didn't cream with the butter properly and I don't think it needs it.  I don't know if I'll put it in the freezer again, I think I might try it the normal way just to see how it goes.  The only problem I had with it was the condensation in the freezer dripped back down onto the top of the cake and made it a little mushy in places (next time I'll cover it with paper towels).  Also the bottom was very soggy from all the steam from the cake so next time I might remove it from the tin before I put it in the freezer.  Definitely a great banana cake, even for people like me who aren't fond of banana cakes.

Increased the oven temp to 300 and used 9 inch round pans but otherwise followed the recipe. Great cake! Everyone loved it. I'm thinking of making it 3 layers next time with walnuts and white chocolate frosting.

This was a very easy recipe and it was delicious. There were so many people that did not cook the cake at the specified temp. I decided to follow the recipe using the low temp.and had no trouble. It only took five min. longer than the time given. I had no weird outcome with sticking it in the freezer either. Just a moist cake. I made one error and that was using 3/4 stick of butter instead of the 3/4 cup (stick and a half) oops! Still turned out delicious and moist. I used all the icing to ice the cake. A good southern banana cake needs a good pile of the sweet stuff on top. I don't get where some say it is too sweet. It is definitely not an overly sweet cake.

I opted not to do the freezer step - I figured that putting a hot cake into the freezer would mean the freezer would have to work harder to get back to temperature and therefore waste electricity.  I'm sure doing this gets a moist cake, but not doing it also gets a moist and delicious cake and worthy of 5 stars.  I'll be making this again very soon!

Awesome, everyone loves this; I make it quite often.  I use 1 1/2 cup milk mixed with 1 tbsp plus 1 1/2 tsp white vinegar in place of the buttermilk (I never have buttermilk on hand and you just have to let this mixture sit for about 5 minutes and you're ready to go!).  I also cut the frosting recipe in half, a whole batch just seems like too much frosting for us.  We also love to dust the top with cinnamon just before eating, YUM!

This cake is moist and wonderful! Instead of baking for a long time and then freezing, we baked it according to how we would normally bake a cake and it still turned out great. We left off the freezing part as putting a hot pan in your freezer could cause problems for your freezer.

This is possibly one of my most favorite recipes from this site, and I bake a lot! This is the moistest cake I have ever made. I added some extra bananas (you can never have too many) and used less sugar to balance it out and I made sure to use super-ripe bananas (at the point of almost rotting) which adds to the moistness and sweetness of the cake. I skipped the frosting as it was sweet enough and tasted amazing on its own. I cannot stress how delicious this banana cake is!

My sisters and I were looking for a recipe similar to one my mom used to make when we were kids. We decided to try this one, and we are so glad we did! It is amazing! It's so moist and delicious and the banana flavor is perfect. We also mashed one banana into the frosting, and it was fantastic! Definitely recommend this recipe! And don't be skeptical of the cooking method, it yielded the best texture I have ever gotten from a cake--moist, fluffy, and perfectly cooked through! Followed the recipe to a tee, and perfect results! This one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing Cindy!

I use this recipe and call them muffins, and people love them. Banana muffins are usually dry and not too flavourful. This "muffin" recipe really impresses. I even do the icing, and call them cream cheese banana muffins. Ha!

This is an amazing cake.  I absolutely love it.  I have made it several times and you really have to follow the directions, I know as a cake baker you want to make the cake and bake it at a higher temp (I was very skeptical) but if you do not follow these directions it will not be what it should.  It is absolutely marvelous.

WOW! this is the BEST banana cake EVER!! I tried to lighten it up a bit. I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup butter for the batter. For the frosting I used 5 tbsp butter. Also used reduced fat cream cheese, otherwise followed the recipe as written. It is super moist MMM MMM MMM! I keep in the fridge beings it has cream cheese frosting and I think it tastes even better cold! Thanks so much for this delicious recipe :)

Great cake! I was leery of baking the cake on 275 and then placing it in the freezer .... but the submitter and the reviewers were adamant about it so I thought I would try it at least once. Wow! It worked really well. Although, I admit I had to bake the cake an additional 20 mins as the 60 just wasn't enough. I also found that that 1/2 tsp just isn't enough. The next time I make it, I will up the salt to 3/4 tsp and see how that works.

I had passed over this recipe a few times, worrying about the temperature with my altitude. I decided a rating of 5 with over a thousand ratings, HAS to say something! lol....I made the cake exactly as written (except for altitude adjustments on ingredients), including temperature and freezer time... I did need to bake it for about 90 minutes, instead of the 60 minutes as written. I used my own peanut butter fudge frosting. A house full of company and I watched people get their third pieces lol. All I can say is WOW!! Thank you for posting it.

A wonderful cake made exactly as the recipe calls for; took it to a potluck and it was the talk of the group.  I found that it needed 80-90 minutes in the oven at 275 degrees. Could Cindy's time refer to a convection oven?

No doubt about it, this cake was very good (4 stars very good and not 5 stars great!) It's a very dense cake and really could have used smidge more banana flavor. I used very ripe bananas, too. I attempted to follow the baking directions, but after 40 minutes the cake was still almost all batter. I increased the temp to 325 without taking it out and it was done 20 minutes later. I did the freezer thing and then frosted it. I thought the amount of frosting was perfect.

I've been making this cake for many years now and it has become a leading family favorite. In the past I have put it in an ice bath or in the freezer, and I have skipped that step entirely and I've been pleased with all of the results. Here are the changes I've made for our tastes: I use 1/2 c salted butter, scant 2c sugar (often closer to 1-3/4 c), 2-1/2c unbleached flour & 1/2c whole wheat flour, 2/3c low fat vanilla Greek yogurt, and 2 eggs + 1 egg white. I bake at 250 degrees convection for 1 hour (give or take 15 minutes). Then, I frost with homemade cream cheese frosting. We love it!

This is a fabulous cake! I ignored the baking directions, baked at 350 and it was wonderful. Made again and replaced half the butter with applesauce (put in with the banana) and it was just as good. Makes 24 cupcakes and a 9x9 pan. I changed the servings to 12 and got 12 cupcakes and a 9x9 pan.

Sad enough, it didnt work out for me. i followed everything exactly how the recipe said. But the batter was still in the liquid state after an hour. I had to give it 1 hour more on 190 C to get it cooked. The top surface burnt but inside it cooked. The cake was very moist without freezing.

Ooops!  I didn't realize my sister was logged in so I reviewed this recipe under her account below.  Here's my review:  I didn't have buttermilk, so I added 1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar to 2% milk to sour it. I also used 4 med/large bananas. I baked it in two 9-inch springforms at 300F for 1 hour and 10 minutes. I did freeze the cakes immediately after I removed them from the oven for 30 minutes. I then removed them from the pans and wrapped them in plastic wrap and froze them to use a week later. The cake was very moist and flavorful. Will make again!

I made this a second time and the only change I made was I used soymilk instead of 2%.  It took about 1 hour and 45 minutes and rose a lot higher than the previous cakes I made using this recipe.  I don't know why but it did.  Next time I think I'll add a little more salt to add a little richness to the sweet flavor.

This cake is the bomb. It is ridiculously tasty and moist. I cooked it according to the recipe, except I placed it into the fridge instead of the freezer. I don't know if my oven temperature is off, but 1 hour was not long enough  -- the cake fell in the middle. So next time I'd do it at 300 degrees or else keep it in longer. And there will be a next time.

This cake is fantastic!!  I followed the directions exactly and I couldn't believe how high it was.  I sprinkled chocolate chips on top--next time, I'll probably go for chopped pecans in addition to the chocolate chips.  Here's my question:  Can you do the popping it right from the oven into the freezer thing with other cake recipes?

My husband requests a banana cake for his birthday every year, and I'd never found one that we really liked...until now!!!  This cake was so moist and delicious, it will now be a favorite at our house.  I didn't use the frosting recipe because we like chocolate (the one on the Hershey's cocoa container), but I will try it next time!

The cake was very good.  I halved the recipe and it was very good.  I did have to add an extra 10 minutes of baking time.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the frosting is just the basic cream cheese frosting.

I can only give this a 3 stars out of 5 for a few reasons.
1) way too much sugar. I used less than half the amount (just one cup), and it was still plenty sweet. I can't imagine how sweet it would have been w/ 2 1/8 cup.
2) the baking instructions are more complicated than they need to be. I baked mine at 350, in a jelly roll sheet (a cookie sheet w/ sides), for 30 minutes and it was perfect. No freezer needed. Totally moist. I know my way around the kitchen, and but I've seen the freezer step before in recipes I've tried. I just don't understand the reasoning behind it.  If anything, it could cause your cake to fall. I even ran the idea by my mom, who is a baker w/ 50+ years experience in the kitchen, she hadn't heard of it either. I'm glad that plenty of you found success w/ that step included, but I don't think it's necessary to have a moist cake. 

Other than that, the cake was fine. Good banana flavor, good texture, good taste.  I'll make it again, but without the freezer step, and I'd use half the sugar, again.

This was fabulous.  It is going into my special cookbook which contains only the recipes my family went ga-ga over.  I didn't have a nine by thirteen so used an eight by ten.  Just had to cook the cake maybe....mmmmm fifteen our twenty minutes longer.  Straight into the freezer and it still came out crazy moist.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this cake with a nutella cream cheese frosting and it is delicious! I followed the directions with one exception, I didn't have buttermilk or milk so I made "buttermilk" using 1 1\2 c. of Almond milk and 1 1\2 tbsp of lemon juice and it came out great!

Unbelievably good!!! I even froze this cake for a week before serving and eating to save time before a party.  The banana flavor is perfect and the cake is so moist.  The cream cheese frosting is the perfect compliment. Even my banana flavor haters loved this! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great tasting banana cake.  It was a big hit, one friend saying it was the best cake she had had in a long time.  I followed the recipe exactly except after one hour the cake was far from being done so I turned up the heat to 350 and baked it another 15 minutes.  I did put it in the freezer but I'm not sure that made much difference.  It was very moist.  I plan on trying to make cupcakes next time.

Tried this recipe today and it was great! Super moist and delish! Never thought of a banana cake being all that good, but it really was! I think I will be making this more often than banana bread. :)

I followed the instructions and the cake was barely set after an hour. I bumped the temp up to 300 degrees and baked it for about 30 more minutes, checking it every few minutes after about 15 or so. We put it in the freezer immediately and was able to frost it as soon as we took it out. The cake didn't last the day. Best banana cake I've ever made!

Wonderful cake!!!!  Very moist and a lot of banana flavor.  It's a mix between a cake and banana bread consistency and the buttermilk really enhances the flavor.  I love that you use a low temp and put it directly in the freezer after, creates a very very moist cake!  I did have to cook it for about 1/2 hour longer than directions though before the toothpick came out clean but all ovens vary.  I'm going to make it again and decorate it for my daughter's 1st birthday!

followed the recipe exactly.  I think there was too much confection sugar.  We really liked it though.  Oh- after an hour the cake was still way under done so we raised the temp to 300 for 15 minutes because I didn't have time to wait at 275!

Tried this today. Baked at 135 Celsius for 1 Hour.
Only alteration (as suggested by previous reviewers) was to the sugar: 1 and 1/8 C instead of 2 1/2 C. Absolutely lovely! Enjoy! :)

Wow.  The worst think I ever did was make this cake. Now my friends and family constantly ask for it. They were so annoying about it, I finally posted it on my Facebook page for them to make themselves.  I did give you full credit although I wish this was my recipe. :)

It is off the charts delish. Thank you for sharing.  I did run out of vanilla and used cinnamon but was still great during one of my batches.  I am going to add bacon to it and do Banana-Bacon cupcakes.  Hubby is a Bacon freak. I will repost with those results.  Otherwise, no improvement is ever needed.

Thanks again for sharing!

In May of 2011 my daughter entered a baking contest at school.  She insisted on a banana cake, so I researched online and found this one had the best reviews.  Well all I have to say about this recipe is that she won first place in her first baking contest!
I've made it many times since then and now she wants it for her birthday.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Absolutely delish!!!!! I followed the recipe except I used vanilla soy milk instead of buttermilk and omitted the vanilla from the cake. Also I only kept the cake in the freezer for about 20 mins (I was afraid I would forget it in there :-S). I followed suggested temperature and the cake finished in an hour. I guess it just varies oven to oven. The cake was absolutely delicious and so moist (but not wet at all). 

I agree with one reviewer that you should add the sugar for the icing a cup at a time and taste it as you go bc I only needed 1 1/2 cups sugar in mine. 

My husband couldn't get enough of it and his whole family loves it too! This is definitely my new banana cake recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe to the letter, and the cake turned out AMAZING!  I was a bit suspect about taking a hot-from-the-oven pan and putting it straight into the freezer, but the good ol' pyrex baking dish really delivered.  I often struggle with baking issues because I live at high altitude (over 5000 feet) but this turned out perfect without any alterations or amendments.  We usually use our "old bananas" for banana bread, but I think this cake will become part of our regular rotation!

When I read the reviews, I thought "Really?  Could it really be THAT good?"  Well, the answer is an emphatic "YES!"  I made this cake for my family and they said it was the best cake they'd ever had. I followed the recipe exactly (except I started cooking at 375 for about 20 minutes and then turned it down to 275 until it was ready.)Thanks!

When I was little, my twin sister and I would always have a banana cake for our birthday from a local bakery that has now gone out of business. Our 40th Bday is coming up in April, and I wanted to find a recipe that would help me re-create that cake we loved as kids. I am so thrilled to have found this recipe! I haven't ever made a cake from scratch before. But, I certainly will make this one again for our Bday in April. Now, I've got to get the frosting figured out. For this cake, I whipped some cream, added a bit of vanilla, and folded in some banana pudding. I knew this wouldn't be exactly what I was looking for, it is too wet to "frost" the cake or even as a filling...However, the taste was spot on and perfect with this moist, fluffy cake.

WOW!!!! This is the best banana cake I have ever made!! Followed the directions to the T. I did have to bake my cake about 2 hours though. But it was well worth it! Very moist and "fancy" tasting. Was a denser texture, which I like. I don't like to feel like I'm eating "air" when I have a piece of cake. This is my banana cake recipe from now on!! Thanks Cindy :-)

HOLY MOLY MOIST!  I made mine as directed, except I had to bake mine for an additional 45 mins (total 1 hr 45 min), put it straight to freezer and then the frosting, kids ate it up and asked for more.

This was a delicious cake.  Next time I will not put frosting on it.  I think some powdered sugar on top would be fine or serve it with whipped topping.

I got great feedback on this recipe.  After reading lots of reviews I reduced the white sugar by 1 cup to 1 1/8 and reduced the confectioners sugar by 1 cup to 2 1/2.  5 1/2+1/8 Cups of sugar in one 9X13 inch pyrex is just too much for me and my group.  Oh, and I used 4 big bananas.  Everything else I did the same,  Yummy!!

I have done this cake for my 10 year old daughter who does not eat bananas and she thought it was fantastic.  It is only after she had eaten it that i told her what the main ingredients were and she could not believe how it tasted.  Now i make it for her all the time, it is the only way i can get here to eat bananas.  Thanks a mil.

Was skeptical at first, but the other reviews calmed my fears.  Every single person who ate this at our party asked for the recipe. It took 1 hr 20 min in my oven on convection bake till the toothpick came out clean, no biggie, totally worth it.

I have made this cake at least 6 times now and it gets rave reviews.  I recently made it for a work potluck and once again it was given a huge thumbs up. My Bunco mates always say it is the Bomb.  For those who think putting the cake into the freezer is odd, it might comfort them to know that putting cake into the freezer is a long established tip of decorative cake bakers.  Frozen cakes are easier to frost, but also, as we see here, give the cake a more moist texture.  A product I have used in making this cake is King Arthur Flour's Banana Oil from their vanilla and flavorings selections.  It adds to the flavor subtly.  I use a teaspoon in addition to the vanilla in both the cake itself and the frosting. For braver souls still, you might also add their fiori di sicilia flavoring, but go sparingly here (no more than a 1/4 teaspoon)as this flavoring is very strong.

This cake was made for me as a birthday cake. I loved it. The cake  wasn't overly sweet. The frosting was creamy and smooth. It was perfect.

The cake itself was perfect!  I was skeptical about the freezer part but it was genius!  One thing I would change would be to lessen the amount of confectioners' sugar for the frosting.  a bit too sweet for me.  

Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice. But I forgot to bake at low temp and freeze. I bake all my cakes at 175 C so baked this one the same as well. It took me 35 min. I cooled at room temp. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar for the cake. And I used only 2 cups icing sugar for the frosting - Thank God !! Because it was sweet enough !! Everyone loved it and I think this is how I'll make it next time as well.

I loved this cake. I took it to work and got many compliments on it. I didn't add the icing to it but I thought it was good on its own. I added a bit of cinnamon/nutmeg and some nuts.  I baked it just like the recipe said and it was moist and delicious. It did take longer than the recipe said (about 20-30 minutes) but I was expecting this from reading other reviews and wasn't in a rush.

This cake was very very good.  I made them into cupcakes and it took about 30-35 minutes to cook at the 275 degrees.  I put them immediately in the fridge (no room in freezer) and they were incredibly moist.  

I only put in 1 cup of sugar and they were plenty sweet.  I also added 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed.  To about half I added 1/2 cup of nesquik.  I put half chocolate and regular in each cupcake.  

I only added about 2 cups of powdered sugar to the cream cheese frosting.  I also had a lot of left over frosting.

Acceptable cake. Sept.15 2011: read the reviews and made the following changes; 13/4 cups sugar half brown half white, 4 mashed bananas,  3/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup butter and a pinch of cinnamon. Next time will do 3.5 bananas and 3/4 -1 tsp of cinnamon cuz u cant taste it at all. Unfortuantly not picture perfect and more like expired yellow meatloaf. Tastes okay and friends liked it. Will not make again or try as muffin instead. Very moist and should eat within 3-5 days. Very bananaey.:)

This is a great recipe.  So good, in fact, that friends believe it is the best they've ever tasted (and they've tasted a lot of cake!).  I too was skeptical about the bake time, but one hour was almost too long.  As others noted, very adaptable also.  I did not have buttermilk, so subbed 6 oz plain Greek yogurt for half the milk and still fantastic.

This cake was the hit of our party!  We had so many compliments.  Like others have mentioned, the temperature is not a typo - you cook it at 275 degrees.  We followed the recipe exactly.  It took 1 hour and 10 minutes for our cake to cook.  Also, instead of putting it in the freezer after it was done cooking, we put it directly into the fridge and left it there overnight.  It was very moist.  Everyone was raving about it!

Very good. I accidentally put in 2t baking soda, but it turned out fine. I made it in two 8" layers (probably would have worked better in two 9" ones) and frosted with peanut butter frosting from this site. The lightness of the cake was perfect with the rich frosting.

Very tasty! I put it in the freezer immediately from the oven, and I even left it there overnight and it stayed very moist.

Great recipe!  I substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar, otherwise I followed the instructions exactly. I did have to give it a little more time in the oven but it was very moist and a big hit! I will be making this again!

I made this cake for a birthday party. Everyone raved that it was the best banana cake they'd ever had. I've had several requests for the recipe! The cake was very moist and flavorful. I did have to turn the temp up on the oven just a bit to bake it in time, but other than that, it was very easy to bake (I'm NOT a talented cook or baker), so I appreciated that.

I am not someone who typically likes sweets. I especially don't like frosting. I always scrape frosting off cakes and cupcakes. This cake AND the frosting were amazing! I might add more banana flavor to the cake next time, perhaps some almond just to try it. But the recipe is fantastic just as is. My new favorite dessert.

WOW is all I can say. I made this cake for friends and family staying true to the original recipe and it knocked everyones socks off. This was sooo moist and full of flavor. This is what a made from scratch cake should taste like. I promise you will go back for seconds.

Baked and froze as directed, took a bit longer in the oven but the outcome was absolutely scrumptious!  Even my husband, who does not like banana things, ate a piece.  I'll definitely make this one again!  
PS.  I find that I always have extra frosting so I halved the recipe and still had plenty.

This cake is fabulous!!!  It took some time (as this was my very first "from scratch" cake), but well worth it! 

I made it for my son's first birthday (2 layers with a peanut butter filling) and it was a huge hit!  Super moist, yet a little denser than your standard box cake (which was exactly what I was looking for since I needed it to support a second ball-shaped tier). 

My brother-in-law, whose nickname is "Cake," was even impressed!!  Definitely keeping this in the recipe box!

I baked this cake yesterday and it did take 90 minutes in my oven.   It was wonderful and I put it directly in freezer as instructed.    Fantastic!  So much faster to ice and be ready to take somewhere.   Makes me wonder how other cakes would do popped in freezer also.  Took it to my parents for them to try; boyfriend, parents and I all loved it.  It made a huge cake and rose clear to the top of my 9x13 pan which most cakes do not do.  Once iced, hard to cover because of how high it rose.  Definitely a keeper and all ingredients were on hand except cream cheese.

This cake is delicious...great texture, too.  I baked mine for 1 1/2 hrs, checking with toothpicks.  It is a bit gummy in the middle of the cake so I will bake it longer next time.  I didn't ice it, altho I am sure it would be even more delicious with it....It takes a bit of time to make this but it's well worth it. [can't figure out the freezer thing, tho...why it makes is more moist since banana cake usually is moist anyway]

This cake was great. Very moist. I did not have buttermilk and discovered was also out of milk. I ended up substituting sour cream in place of buttermilk. This turned out fabulous. Made it in the evening and by the next morning only one small piece remained. Also did not frost. Frosting is not needed as this can stand alone.

Just added a little nutmeg and chocolate chips and this was an amazingly moist cake!!! Have made other banana cakes with pastry flour and this was lighter than those.  Very good! This one is my new favourite recipe!!

Delicious! All my friends ask for this recipe whenever I make it. Some have even paid me to make it for them! The recipe makes a bit much for a 9x13 pan. If you halve the recipe it will make a nice 'bar'. Also I don't care for cream cheese frosting on it. Beat half a stick of butter with powder sugar, an egg and vanilla. Yummy!

The temp and freezer method works great so if you are skeptical give it a try. Mine took about 15-20 mins longer to bake. This also happened to be the day I was running out of everything. I was about 1/2 cup shy of white sugar so I substituted in some brown sugar. I only had about a cup of bananas so I used one of those little cups of applesauce as well. For extra flavor I added about 1/2 tsp of freshly ground nutmeg. I also used the Burnt Butter Frosting on this website instead of the cream cheese frosting. Oh and I didn't have buttermilk so I did the lemon juice/milk combo and I wanted to save my butter for the frosting so I used marg in the cake. The taste is still great.

I made this recipe for my mother for her birthday and everyone just raved about it.  I made it exactly as it says and it was perfect.  I had no room in freezer so I just put it outside (winter time), the only thing i changed was the amount of confectioners sugar i put in it as I thought it would be too sweet for the icing.  I put in 2 cups and it was just right.

This is my go-to banana cake, but I split the batter between two 13x9 Pyrex dishes.  I like a denser, not as fluffy cake so splitting it makes it just right. Then i can have one in the freezer for when i need it (i mean, want it.) I have a browned butter icing that is so yummy with the cake that when we eat the cake straight fro the fridge, it reminds me of that Sara Lee Banana Cake I had as a kid. My 4 year old asked for this cake for his birthday!  If you love banana, you will love it!

I had to bake mine an extra 20 minutes.  Finished product was fabulous.  We ate ours without frosting.

This recipe did not work well for me. I followed to the letter. After baking in the oven I inserted a toothpick and it came out clean. I stuck it right in the freezer. When I went to frost the cake it was sunken in the center making me think it did not cook all the way through. And I was right. Places in the cake where banana mush and dough together. I will not make this again.

This is a great recipe! I have made it many times.  I cook for a hunting  ranch and quite often have over ripe bananas. This is one of my most used recipes.  Even people who say they don't like banana cake, love this one.  The 1st time I made this it took a lot longer to bake, now I fill my cake pan a shy of half full and put the rest in a bread pan to make a loaf of bread too, I add walnuts in this portion.  It freezes very well too.  HINT: for the frosting, add about a teaspoon of lemon juice, I think cream cheese frosting can overpower the cake, but the lemon juice seems to allow the wonderful flavor of the cake to blend so well, my guests agree!

This cake is delicious! The unconventional instructions do indeed produce a nice, moist cake. I would note that in my oven it took 1.5 hours to bake, however. Next time, I think I will add a little more banana to the cake and a little less vanilla to the frosting. But overall, a wonderful recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I substituted 8 ounces of plain yogurt and 4 ounces of soy milk for the buttermilk. I skipped the lemon juice and increased the baking soda to 2 teaspoons and the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I cooked this at 350 F  for about 30 - 35 minutes. I served this to people who don't normally eat dessert and they pretty much ate the entire cake at one sitting.

I made this for my family and friends, because I don't like Banana. So my ratings are based om others comments. Everyone really enjoyed this. I didn"t bring home any leftovers. Didn't change the recipe at all.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It has the taste of banana bread, with the texture of a moist cake.  So good.  I made it exactly as written, except added 1 extra tbsp vanilla because I love that.  I also added chopped walnuts on the top of the frosting.  It took 1 1/2 hours to bake.  We somehow waited until the next day to eat the cake and it couldn't have been any better!

This cake was perfect. I made it exactly according to instructions, everything from the oven temperature to the time in the freezer. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I topped it with the Fluffy Peanut Butter frosting recipe from this website. Took it to work with me and there was NONE left by the end of the day.

Amazing cake. Love, love, love it. I followed the recipe exactly, but it took about 1hr, 20 min to bake. I also reduced the powdered sugar in the frosting to 2.5 cups. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe!

What a wonderful cake! Very light and moist - this is my husbands new favorite cake! The only thing is that it did take a little longer (I have 2 oven thermometers in mine, so I know it was 200), I bumped up to 220 at 1 hour into baking and it took another 50 minutes.   Next time I will try this without frosting, because it is a wonderful cake by itself! Thanks for the recipe!  If anyone has made this in cupcake form, I'd love to know what you ended up with for timing and temp!

Wonderful recipe!  I did follow your recipe just like you said, freezer and all.  I did have to bake it 15 more minutes to get it done in the middle.  It turned out great and was a big hit.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe!  Made this for a cookout, my family loved it!  will definately make this again!  Cooking time is longer then suggested by the original recipe.  Also the brown sugar i think adds alot to the recipe.  Thanks again for the recipe!

OMG!  This is the best banana ever.  I made this for a Nascar Race party and everybody loved it.  Don't change a thing, heavenly the way it is.  A nice heavy/dense cake. Great Cream cheese frosting too.  Love, love, love it.  Thanks for the submission.

My girlfriend has requested this cake for her birthday for the last couple of years.  I found the recipe on here and haven't had to look for another since as it's turned out so well.  I usually make cupcakes instead and it makes a ton of them.  Delicious cake though. Moist and flavorful.

I opted to make cupcakes out of this recipe.  I did not change a thing regarding the instructions.  I will advise only to fill the cupcake tins 3/4 of the way or they will overflow (which means you have to eat them yourself ;)) I toped the cupcakes with the cream cheese icing and dusted them with cinnamon sugar.   They made about 24 cupcakes.  They were a big hit and I was even asked to make 100 for an upcoming party!

I have made this cake over and over, it has become a favorite in the family.  It has NEVER failed! Everytime a new eater comes on board , they want the recipe. I have my own idea of how this cake first got made...I think the new mother accidently had the oven set at 275..then put the cake in the freezer to cool it down quick so she could put the frosting on.  Whatever happened, it is wonderful!

This was really great....very moist, and full of banana flavor. I'm always looking for a good recipe to use my extra bananas (I always end up with brown ones, and just toss them in the freezer for later use:). I did end up putting the cake in the freezer, and it was really good. Nice too, because I was in a bit of a hurry, so the freezer sped up the cooling process. I almost never mess with homemade icings, but it tasted great with packaged cream cheese icing. I'll make this again for sure.

I have made this recipe exactly following the recipes coupleof times before and had very good results. Today though I made without planning so had to do few substitutions which might sound little way too off, but end result was still really yummy. It was my son's 9th birthday and he loved this cake.  So my substitutions. Butter  - with same amount of E V Olive oil Butter milk - with a mixture of milk and yogurt AllPurpose flour - 1/2 flour and 1/2 wheat flour white sugar - sugar in the raw Vanilla extract - Orange juice It was my son's birthday and he loved this cake.

This banana cake is wonderful!!My recommendations are:  Don't be alarmed.... it will take more then an hour. DO cook it at 275. DO put it in the freezer. It's  sooo worth it. Enjoy!

FANTASTIC!!!!!  Made a couple minor changes based on recommendations from other bakers: used 2 c white sugar + 1/4 c brown sugar, and did not have buttermilk so used same amount of regular milk + 1.5 T of vinegar.  Baked cake at said temp, but required an extra 20 minutes of baking time until it was done.  This was a super-moist and delicious cake that I served for my husband's birthday.  Everyone LOVED it & I will definitely make it again!

Fantastic! My wife iseven on a ZERO-dairy diet so I had to substitute soy milk (with a little vinegar) and margarine for the butter and buttermilk and it was STILL amazing! It definitely took a LOT longer to cook than the directions indicate (mine took over 2 hours) but still comes out moist and delicious. This one is added to the recipe book and will be brought out regularly!

Wonderful Cake!  The frosting is a bit too sweet for me using the recipe as written.  I use 2 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar instead of the 3 1/2 cups and it is PERFECT!

This is very dense.  It is a banana bread recipe made to look like a cake.  I prefer my banana cake to be light and moist.  It tasted fine, but was like eating banana bread with icing.

This banana cake was AWESOME.  I used bananas that were over ripe that I had stored in the freezer.  (They are so much easier to mash and more flavorful this way.)  I thought the baking temp. was low but made the recipe as written.  I checked the cake after 1 hour and the middle was still liquidy.  I ended up baking it for 1 hour and 20 minutes and popped it in the freezer as directed.  The cake was moist but I don't think it would have been any different had baked it at a higher temp. and skipped the freezer step.  This recipe made ALOT of frosting.  The overall result was EXCELLENT.  Make this recipe!  SO GOOD.

This was an easy, great cake.  I made it exactly as it said.  I had to cook it for 80 minutes.  I think the next time I will just serve it plain or maybe with a bit of whip cream.  The frosting was a bit too sweet.  Overall, this is a great recipe and will definitely stay in my recipe box!

Update:  I made a mistake when I baked this cake and gave it to the Marines here.  They loved it so much that I have now made three this week alone!  Easy and so good!

I love this dense banana cake. I think all banana cakes should taste like this. I did not change anything in the recipe but I did not use the icing (too sweet for me)I used the whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this website. Very good.  I will definately use this cake again and again. I followed the directions to a 'T' I had to cook mine for 90min at 275. I would not change a thing.   Thank You

Excellent banana cake. I had to bake it for 85 minutes. You only need 1/2 of the frosting, the whole recipe would be too much. I would love to make this often but after looking at the 632 calories, 27.7g fat and 103g carbs per serving I will only make this for special occasions. UPDATE, I gave most of this to family members, most agreed the frosting was too sweet so would probably omit it if I make this again.

Made half a recipe in an 8x8 Pyrex pan but had to bake it well over an hour before it was done.  Heavy, but good banana flavor.  Used a plain buttercream frosting recipe instead of cream-cheese.

I have never made a more moist or delicious homemade cake then this! The flavor and the texture is heavenly! I did freeze the cake as indicated in the recipe. I am thinking that the reason for that is too help keep more moisture in the cake that otherwise would be lost using a slower cooling process. I also made a small cake using a mini loaf pan that I did not cool in the freezer, and it was still very moist. You will still have a very moist cake if you decide to skip the freezing process. I frosted my cake with a caramel frosting recipe from this site, Caramel Frosting V, wonderful combination of flavors!

This cake is very good my only complaints are that at the low oven temp it took 2 hours to bake! The frosting recipe makes so much it overwhelms the cake. Next time i will just make half the frosting or try it without.

It is very wise to keep an oven thermometer in your oven at all times. Most ovens need their thermostat adjusted.  My hubby does something behind the oven temp. knob, a screw or something....and has adjusted my temp. that way.  The cake is awesome!!

A strange recipe (bake at low temp and freeze? but the submitter insisted, so I did) but very good! My four stars may have to do with the fact that I didn't measure the bananas, I could have had more than cup and a half, so my cake turned out a little more dense, but still very moist. I made almond buttercream frosting to top it and that was yummy!

Really yummy and yes the cooking directions are correct.  If you don't have room  in  your freeze get a cooler and put frozen stuff in temporarily to  make room. It does  make a difference and I do believe many cake recipes  can be  made with this technique. I used VERY  ripe bananas  - almost  to the point  of  over ripe. I do   that with regular banana bread and I find it makes much better, sweeter more flavorful bread or in this case cake.

I made this for a birthday party and it was a hit!  I added a bag of mini sem-sweet choc chips to the batter and the same choc chips around the outside edges after frosting it. I have a drawer freezer and had a hard time finding space to move this guy into out of the oven- so will plan ahead for that next time.

Delicious!!  This recipe scales easily to four servings (for a small cake) and is a great way to use that last banana on the counter that's too ripe to eat.  Highly recommend using CAKE FLOUR -- it makes an amazing difference in taste and texture for most cakes.  The banana flavor here is very subtle, which we liked.  (People who think they do not like banana cake are likely to enjoy this one!)  The texture is fluffy and moist -- not heavy and wet, as are some banana cakes.  Don't skip the lemon juice, as it keeps the color of the finished cake a light, appetizing color.  I baked at 325 degrees F.  I also added broken walnuts to the cake for some texture, and lemon zest to the frosting.  Loved this -- will definitely make it again!!

Fantastic! Baked it at 325 degrees for a little under an hour (to the point where a toothpick started coming out clean) and popped it in the freezer. I did take other reviewers' recommendations and cut back on sugar a bit (I used about 2/3 cup, half white and half brown). Excellent cake!

I just finished baking this cake and it is really way to sweet for me.  I thought 2 1/8 cups of sugar seemed like alot I think I would cut the sugar in 1/2 in both the cake and frosting.  I use splenda for baking don't know if that made a difference. It did come out beautiful though.  Must view pictures.

This recipe offers a nice alternative to traditional banana bread.  Of course it is pretty similar, and a little less healthy, but if you make a lot of banana bread I'd recommend you throw this one in there every now and again.  It's lighter in texture than bread, and has a good flavor.  I'm sure it would be great with frosting, but it's not necessary and the extra calories certainly are nice to leave off.

I made two of these last weekend, one for a birthday and one for work.  Everyone went NUTS over this cake! I did use skim milk instead of buttermilk,since that is what I had on hand.  Also, I live in Denver, so perhaps due to the altitude, it took one hour and 15 minutes to bake at 275.  Just fantastic!

Thankyou for submitting this recipe!  It came out so moist and delicious.  I followed your baking instructions and I did have to allow extra time until mine was ready but this was no problem for me. I checked it every 10 minutes after the one hour time.  The only thing I changed is the frosting.  Just because I wanted to make something different.  I decreased the powdered sugar to only about 1 cup and added maybe 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips melted with the butter in the microwave.  I then topped with sprinkled walnuts.  The only problem is that I can't stop eating the cake.  I mean I have been picking at this cake all day!  Gosh it's really good!!!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time to the letter and it was just bland.  A good cake, good consistancy, moist, etc.  but nothing special at all.    The second time I added a bit of cinnamon and spice and it was better, but still bland.  My friends and I all agree, good recipe... but nothing special.  It's, as everyone said, "missing something".

This is my absolute favorite cake and my favorite use for overripe bananas. I simply put them into a zip lock and toss them into the freezer until I have enough for this cake. BTW, my only adjustment to the recipe is to add an extra large banana and increase the baking time by about 30 minutes. This cake disappears fast and always gets crazy RAVE reviews! I live in Spain and we do not get Buttermilk so the first thing I do is to add 1 TBS of lemon juice per one cup of whole milk and let sit for at least 10 minutes or while I proceed with the recipe. Thanks CC for a dynamite recipe!

5 stars for the cake; 4 stars for the icing.  The cake is excellent!  I'm convinced that something magical happens in the freezer because this cake was very moist!  Baking at 275*, my cook time was about 1 hr., 20 min.  The frosting was super easy to make and had very good flavor but it was really too sweet for our taste.  I actually think the cake could stand on its own without the icing.

Oh...my...goodness!!! This is an incredible recipe, and I am now a very popular person at my husband's office!  Super moist, very tasty, and easy to make.  Definitely worth the extra cooking time and freezing time.  I did make a few modifications based on some of the tips from the other readers.  Used regular milk and added 1.25 tsp vinegar in lieu of buttermilk, an extra teaspoon of vanilla, used 4 bananas, and baked it in a bundt pan AND a loaf pan. Cooking time took about 1hr 20 min, even though I did raise the temp to 300 degrees F after 55 minutes at 285 F (since I had 2 pans in the oven). Froze 45 minutes as directed.  A fabulous recipe that will definitely be part of my baking repertoire.  Thank you!!!

This was a huge hit!  I put caramel icing on it and fabulous!  I cooked at the temp. the recipe called for but didn't put in freezer because it was so moist didn't need it.  It cooked perfectly and came out of pans perfect with no mess up.  I cooked in three layers and it was very pretty and held together, even though it was wonderfully moist. I think because it cooks at lower temp. it doesn't rise in middle as fast and makes it easier to layer the cake and keeps it from drying out maybe?  I may try to cook at this temp. for other cakes in future and see if it works the same.  Love it, thanks for the recipe!

This cake is AMAZING.  I used *really* ripe bananas.  I made these alterations: Bake at 325 for 1 hr 10 min, use 3 1/4 c flour, cut sugar to 3/4 c of brown, 3/4 c of white, 4 tsp vanilla, add 2 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp cinnamon, cut the lemon juice, add a handful of shredded coconut.  I didn't put it in the freezer and it came out MOIST and tasty.  Not bread-like at all!

One must be patient when baking this cake, since it does take much longer than 1 hr to cook.  Just check with the ole toothpick every so often.  Mine baked for approximately 1 1/2 hrs.  I made it exactly as written, with the addition of 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. The frosting was too much so I froze half for another use.  The cake is moist & the frosting delicious.  If using a glass pan,  place the pan on a metal rack in the freezer to keep dish from breaking.  Will make again.

There is a similar recipe I use also, depends on what I have on hand.  I make this one if I have buttermilk and if I have sour cream I make the Frosted Banana Bars posted on this site.  Either can be make into bars or cake.

SO SO YUMMY!!!!  After making this the first time, I determined the cake would taste a lot better with the addition of another 1/2- 1 cup of bananas.  This helped make the cake more moist and flavorful the second time I made it.  I baked mine in 3- 9" round pans and baked at 300 degrees.  They came out perfectly!!  The frosting is super yummy also.  This is one of my favorite cake recipes!

After making this last night, I definitely prefer this recipe to any other banana bread or cake. I didn't read the correct oven temp, so I ended up baking at 350 degrees in two 9-inch pans for 45 minutes, and it came out perfectly moist, even without freezing. I didn't use the icing, I felt the cake was enough by itself. I also cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup and no one could taste the difference. I will be using this recipe as an alternative for those who dislike pies at Thanksgiving. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!  Everyone at my father-in-law's birthday party loved this cake.  My cake didn't turn out overly dense as others have mentioned in the reviews.  I followed the recipe as shown, except I did cut the sugar to 2 cups.  Just remember to cream the butter and sugar really well (light & fluffy) and don't skimp on the overall mixing time.  It seems like the more air introduced into the batter, the better the results.  I did have to bake the cake about 1 hour and 30 minutes at 275 to get the toothpick to come out clean as others have mentioned. I put it in the freezer as directed--a very unusual method, but it seems to work well.  Thanks for this great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe!!!  I would give it like 10 stars but I'm limited to 5.  I did not have 'buttermilk' so used half milk and half sourcream.  I baked it exactly as is but knocked off a few minutes since my pan is dark coated.  The freezer technique is new but perfect!  Cake was moist and very good. This is a keeper for me, now I just need to buy cream cheese to make the frosting :)  Thank you for this recipe Cindy!

The bana cake is superb! I planned to walk to a pastry shop, but I don't have to anymore. This is so sweet! 

Following the recipe was so easy. I was surprised that I had to place the hot banana cake immediately in the freezer. I never had to do this before, and the author of this recipe did explain the reason for it. I am, however, a learning cook/baker.

About creaming the cream cheese, and the oil together--I also added vanilla extract together with these two ingredients--I used a spoon and it turned out fine. There is specific "equipment" for creaming, isn't there? Would that be a spatula? I'm not sure, but I think it's great that I can use what I have and, I think it's also about, apply baking/cooking methods with my hands.

I have a hand mixer and I found that the batch sticks to it too much--even on low setting, so I mixed with a wooden spoon. It didn't hurt, but I would have liked to save some time.

Otherwise, I am keeping this recipe in a plastic sheet cover and in a binder where all the other foods/treats I have been successful in making and also think are very delicious.

To the author, thanks for the recipe. It's one I'm definitely going to use when I plan a party in my home.

I just finished baking this cake. I've never had a banana cake before and I didn't know what to expect. It was delicious. I will have to fight off cravings for this cake. I've already forwarded the recipe to friends and family. We had some friends over and they took the extra pieces of cake with them when they left. I give this cake 6 STARS!!!

Loved this cake!  I didn't change a thing.  I cut the icing recipe in half.  I had the feeling the cake wouldn't need a thick layer of frosting.  I made it while my Mom was visiting and she was intrigued with placing the entire hot cake in the freezer.  It will give her something to tell her friends I'm sure.

I have been making banana cake for a long time, but this recipe was much better than mine. It definitely takes longer than 1 hour to bake, about 20 minutes more. I skipped putting it in the freezer since I used a glass pan and I was afraid it would break. My kids don't like cream cheese frosting so I used a plain buttercream. I think the longer baking time at the low temperature keeps this cake really moist. It was really delicious.

I did not make this recipe as stated.  I have a toddler that is allergic to dairy, so I modify the recipes to be safe for him to eat.  This one works great with substitutions!  I subbed 1 1/2 c. unsweetened soymilk + 1 1/2 Tbs. lemon juice for the buttermilk, 1/2 c. Earth Balance 'margarine' + 1/4 c. Smart Balance shortening for the butter, I omitted the lemon juice with the bananas, and used 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar instead of the 2+ cups of white sugar.  I also did not use the frosting recipe.  The cake is very moist and good without any frosting, but it would be delicious with a dairy-free vanilla or cinnamon frosting.  The rich banana flavor and moist cake texture of this dessert made it a big hit with the whole family!

I was looking for a recipe to use up a bunch of bananas.  This looked good so I started making it. Halfway through I realized I didn"t have any buttermilk so I substituted milk with 2 tlbs of lemon juice added.  I also added a pureed banana to the frosting.  THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE OUT THERE!

Excellent cake -- puts boxed mixes to shame.  Moist, a little dense, and rose to the top of my pan.  I substitued smart balance for the butter in both the frosting and cake, and used nuechatel cream cheese to reduce the fat.  The recipe turned out great with the substitutions.  Got lots of compliments, and requests for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe! Only changed the buttermilk to 1% milk. Smells great while baking. My family couldn't wait for it to cool entirely before we iced it. It was sooo good I carried some to a friend, my sister and my mom. It was entirely gone in less than an hour. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this cake SO many times for many different people. Everyone always raves about it. It's my boyfriend's new favorite kind of cake. He always requests it for holidays and his birthday! I highly recommend this cake--it's extremely moist and flavorful and surely to be a crowd pleaser!

I've made this cake now at least 8 times and it never seems to last!  Everyone always enjoys it and goes for seconds and thirds.  I don't change a thing as the recipe is excellent as is.  One thing I do for the buttermilk is use whole buttermilk (like a bavarian style) instead of low fat buttermilk.  This is just my preference, and what I buy when at the supermarket (plus whole buttermilk is excellent for biscuits).  
Thanks for the great cake recipe - I will continue to make this for a long time!

mmm...good! the only thing i did different is I let the cake cool off for 2 hours (I was afraid to spoil the meats in the freezer by immediately putting it in) and then I put the cake in the freezer for 20 min. Then I put the icing on it. I didn't like the icing at first because I thought it was too "cheesy", but definetly tasted better the second day. I put saran wrap over the left overs and put it in the fridge. It was good to the last bite.

What a delicious cake! This cake pleased all the taste buds in our house. I followed the recipe to a "T" with two exceptions. I added chocolate chips because my kids love them and I also used chocolate frosting. It took about 30 minutes longer to bake than stated. It was moist and very good! Thank you for this recipe. The kids are already asking me when I can make it again.

This is pretty tasty! I followed the directions exactly for the cake, but didn't use the recommended frosting. Instead, I made my own "Nutella" frosting since I think banana and Nutella is a perfect combination. It tastes great, but I think the frosting takes away from the cake. It's so good, it can hold its own without frosting.

Made this recipe for a baby shower (the theme was monkeys - so "banana" cake was fitting!)  Everyone was talking about how delicious it was and I had requests for the recipe.  Super moist and delicious.  Will definately make this again!

This cake is delicious! I made it for a friend's baby shower. I used Banana Butter Icing(from this site) as filling and a simple cream cheese icing on the cake. Since then I've had people beg me to make it for their shower, a birthday, and even a wedding!

Very moist and full of banana flavor.  I made this cake for a get together and my guests loved it!  They are already asking me to make it again.  The frosting was great but the next time I make it I am going to use chocolate frosting.

I take one star away because the texture is not like a cake but more like a bread. I'll take another star away for banana flavor because there is not alot of flavor and I used very ripe bananas. That leaves it at 3 stars. I won't make this again, there is better ones out there.

Yep, I agree - this recipe is outstanding!  My husband, who hates banana cake/bread, loves it and asks me to bake it often.  I took one reviewers suggestion and added mashed banana to the cream cheese frosting.  It was sensational!

Oh my gosh, this was so good. The only adjustment was adding walnuts on top. My father-in law who usually only has coffee for breakfast ate two pieces the next morning. Definitely will be making again!

Thank you for sharing. Excellent
























 




Excellent cake! I made it for my son's birthday. I used butter frosting since I'm not a fan of cream cheese frosting.Everyone really liked it. Thank you!

This is a delicious cake, but I wonder if 275F is the right temperature, it took much longer to bake and I used the right size pan. This is the best banana cake I ever ate, I added chocolate chips.

This is such a foolproof and versatile recipe! Firstly, I used Australian cup and teaspoon measures (which are slightly more generous). Secondly, I used a round cake tin that was probably way too small. Thirdly, for lack of space I was unable to freeze or refrigerate the cake to cool so I cooled it covered tightly with a piece of foil.  The cake took over 2 hours to cook and rose to the brim of the tin, which scared me a little. However, the slow cooking meant that the cake didn't burn-- not even at the sides or bottom! And it was so SO moist. The slow cooling with the foil also meant that the moisture was sealed in and the cake almost steamed in its own heat. On cooling the cake also shrunk slightly but looked beautiful still. I didn't ice the cake and I think it's great just as it is. YUM.

This recipe was excellent.  I made some minor changes as others suggested.  I cut the sugar in the cake to 1 3/4 cups, added 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and also added some mini chocolate chips to the batter.  An easy suggestion for putting the cake from oven directly to freezer is to use a throw away aluminum pan.  I also cut the powder sugar in the frosting as a number of people suggested to 2 cups.  Next time, I may add a little banana flavoring to the batter.

Fantastic cake! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but had no buttermilk, so I soured some milk with lemon juice, then ommitted the lemon juice in the recipe. Same result. I think the freezer time really does make it moister. My husband said it was better than his grandmother's, which is certainly high praise!

This was great. I modified it a bit however.  Substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, added a nice caramelized flavor.  Doubled the vanilla.  Also substituted cake flour for the A.P. with no issues, and used dried (reconstituted) buttermilk instead of fresh.  Baked nicely in two 9" rounds in just under an hour.  Super moist, very flavorful, and a new family favorite! Topped with Cream Cheese Buttercream.  Super!

Make that 10 stars!  This is my all-time favorite made-from-scratch cake recipe and I have tried many over the years.  I get many compliments every time I make it and I've made it five or six times over the last year.  The freezing apparently makes the cake moist but I also like the fact that it keeps its height.  I have made it in round cake pans and the cake ends up quite high.  It looks nice when it's done and frosted.  I'd like to find another cake recipe that I like as well as this one.  I've made it twice this weekend, one for a grad party (not a crumb left) and then again for a family birthday the next day.  I'd like to try the freezing trick with some other recipes and see what happens.  Freezing also allows the first frosting (crumb layer) to take place sooner as it's cool in 45 minutes.  Great recipe!

Great recipe. A couple hints for a perfect cake: definitely use just 1-3/4 cups of sugar for the batter; use only 2 cups of confetioners sugar for the icing (and you'll still have leftovers!). And DEFINITELY put a whole bunch of choped walnuts on the top. Mine baked to perfect at 275 for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I was Nervous at first, especially after reading all the conflicting reviews. And to top it off, I've never made cake from scratch before. But this turned out Perfect! Moist! Delicious! The cake is a little heavy, but it doesn't matter. And make sure you serve it a room temperture. It taste much more delicious that way!!
So here's my advice... DO NOT follow the directions in the cookbook!!! The one on the website is perfect. Although I did cook it at about 290 and it was done in about 40-45 minutes, so keep an eye on it. Plus, the icing is was too much! You only need to make half of it. At the Very Maximum a third of what it calls for. And I topped it off with roasted chopped walnuts, Perfect! I will Definatly Make Again and Again!!!

What a disappointment! I was expecting a banana cake, but what I got was a dense banana bread. I followed directions in Allrecipes cookbook which said to bake at 350, which sounded more reasonable than 275. It said to bake for 1 hour and 5 min, I checked in 40 minutes and it was already done and burned around the edges. There is just too much of a discrepancy with this recipe posted and the book version. Did they even test this? Anyway, this recipe is fine if you are looking for a banana bread recipe, but it is nothing like a banana cake and I think that is why a lot of reviewers liked it without the icing.

Be sure and serve this cake at room temperature.  I very nearly gave this recipe a bad review because right out of the refrigerator the texture was rubbery but at room temperature it was moist and delicious.  I frosted the cake with chocolate cream cheese frosting (also from this site) for a change and it was very good.

This was a great recipe!  It really didnt need any changes, however, I did make two changes.  First, I added a very small amount of cinnamon...just a couple of dashes into the flour.  Second, for the frosting, I halved the vanilla, and added some banana extract.  Wow!!!

My husband wanted banana cake with chocolate frosting for his b-day last week, and this recipe was perfect!  I only changed a couple of things to accomodate his request.  I subtracted 1/2 cup of sugar from the cake batter and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I might add the sugar back next time just to see the difference, but it was really good.  And for the frosting, I melted 1 1/4 cups of milk chocolate chips, used 1 cup of the confectioners sugar with the c. cheese and butter and no vanilla.  Wow!  REALLY good.  The rest of the instructions (time, temp.) went perfectly!  It was a hit, thanks!

This is the most delicious banana cake.  It is very moist and tastes especially good (but not overly sweet) if made with extrememly ripe bananas that are mashed really well. You can use less ripe bananas to decrease the sweetness if desired.

I have made this recipe repeatedly and neither my guests nor I have ever been disappointed!

This was a very tasty banana cake.  I love the denseness and the banana flavor.  For the icing I cut the sugar down to 3 cups based on the reviews and it was the perfect sweetness.  I am not a big icing fan, but I loved this cream cheese icing.  I added walnuts.

Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (I couldn't taste it, so next time I will add 1 to 1 1/2 t) and 1 cup walnuts to the cake batter.  I would probably raise the temperature to 300 or 325, as at 275 it took almost one and a half hours to bake.  The cake sunk in the middle after cooling.  I don't know why it did that.  I agree with there being a lot of frosting.  I added nuts to the frosting as well.  The cake was enjoyed by all.

This was my first cake from total scratch...  WORD OF CAUTION:  Be sure you definitely use all-purpose flour, not self-rising!  I thought flour was flour and didn't check what I had.  My cake was foaming, but quite good.  I'm giving it five stars because it was still tasty even after my screw up!

I have made this cake several times.  The temperature should be 375 and not 275 as listed.  The key is to place it in the freezer after its done baking.  Every person who has tried it loves it and asks for the recipe.  It is by far the best banana cake recipe I have tried.  The icing recipe makes more than you need so I usually cut it by one quarter.  This is our new standard birthday cake and my kids prefer it over all other types of cake.  You have to try it.

a super yummy cake!!!! easy to make- although for me the baking time took longer than suggested.  i was searching for a banana bread recipe, but was pleasantly surprised when it came out tasting more like a....cake (as the title suggests).  would certainly make this again and again.

This is a great recipe.  I used a round tin, which was a bit of a mistake.  Next time I will use a rectangular tin, which is not so deep, because this took a long time to cook. After an hour I took it out and it was not 100% cooked yet, but I was in rush, so took it out anyway.  I altered the icing, reduced the icing sugar by about a cup.  The end result was fantastic, was a really yummy cake, which tasted great (maybe even better) the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe Cindy! Will definately use again!

This recipe is fantastic.  I didn't have any creme cheese, so I made the powdered sugar icing, and drizzled it on top and it was wonderful.  I could not have expected it to turn out any better than it did.  Very easy and rewarding recipe.

Excellent cake. After reading the reviews I decided to use one and three fourths cups of sugar. That seemed to make a nice cake that wasn't too sweet. I baked the cake at 325 degrees for about 50 minutes. Just make sure your toothpick test comes out clean. For those who feel the cake is more like bread, I have one thing to say: If you want a light banana cake, buy a boxed mix. Homemade banana cakes, made with real bananas, will be not be light and fluffy.

I am not an experienced baker, so was a little skeptical if I had done it right.  This cake was incredible.  And if I can make it taste good, you know if has most to do with the recipe.  I think the key point was the part about putting it in the freezer after the oven.  The cake was so moist and delicious eveyone loved it.  This is a keeper.

My cake took longer to bake as center was still not baked. Didn't place cake in freezer but cake still was moist. I made my own cream cheese frosting as the one listed seemed too rich for my taste.

I LOVE this recipe  everyone begs me to make it; they even bring me in black bananas! I tried to make it in 3 layered cake pans and it was too much batter. I make the frosting without the extra stick of butter so it is stiffer. I often use only 1 cup of buttermilk because the cake is very moist. THANKS FOR SHARING! I LOVE IT!

We are chocolate cake lovers.  HOWEVER, this cake is now one of our favorites.  We LOVE it.  I put it in a 12x17 pan.  Worked perfect.  Also added 1 tsp. banana flavoring.  Even YUMMIER!  The frosting was "the icing on the cake"!!!!!!  This cake is addictive-----BEWARE!!

Stays moist for a long time. And the lemon juice adds an extra twist to the old 
banana cake recipe. Yum. I made it with the Cajun Cake coconut-nut topping...

I have been looking for the perfect banana cake recipe and I have found it. The freezer makes the difference.

Frosting could be cut in half, but I freeze leftover for cupcakes anyhow!

I chose this recipe because it was different, putting it in the freezer.  It was a great choice.  One of the best cakes I have ever made.  My girlfriend loves me even more when I make this for her.

This cake was fantastic.  I made a double batch and baked it in 2 jelly roll pans and brought it to a dinner at church.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  And living where it's cold, I didn't have to use my freezer...I just put them outside. I also added some walnuts on one of them.  YUMMY!

I don't know if the "putting it in the freezer trick" made the difference but the cake was very moist.  It had a pound cake consistency.

This was a DELICIOUS cake!  The best part was that it stayed so moist, even several days later.  I enjoy a slice with a cup of coffee in the mornings.

This is one of the very best cakes I have ever made.  (And I have made a lot)!  I took this to work and it dissapeared.  Everyone loved it.  It is moist, and has a great fresh banana flavor.  It would be good with, or without, the cream cheese frosting.  The frosting is so delicious!  I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for.

This cake is scrumptious!  I made it because it ranked number one on this website, and I was not disappointed!  Heavenly!  I added a little extra vanilla than the reciped called for.  Because it's only me and my boyfriend living together, I saved us some pieces and brought the rest of the cake in to work to share with my co-workers.  The attacked the pan like a bunch of vultures and all wanted the recipe.  A good cake for a crowd!!

I haven’t reviewed a recipe in years but I had to review this one! It’s perfect as written. I didn’t have any buttermilk so I substituted with whole milk and lemon juice. It made the moistest cake I’ve ever had in my life. The frosting was perfect too!

I love this recipe! I don’t usually have the time to bake at 275 then put it in the freezer so I use frozen ripe bananas. I freeze all my ripe bananas for extra moisture.

This is a great recipe! I made it for my coworkers and had a lot of people come back for seconds and thirds. The changes I made were reducing the sugar in the cake by about 1/4 cup and in the frosting by 1/2 cup. I also didn’t bother with freezing the cake, I just let it cool on the counter and it still was super moist.

I’m baffled as to the number of glowing reviews.  The cook time was grossly underestimated and even after cooking part of the batter in muffin tins for over an hour, the tops were still gooey!  The cake is extremely dense and I didn’t care for the flavor of the icing either.  Won’t be making again.

I received rave reviews on this cake. The only change I made was it needed to cook for 1 hr. and 20 min. I would leave the butter out of the frosting next time, I will definitely make this again.

I am a prizewinning baker, living on a rural property just outside Austin.  I bake all the time and I've made countless banana recipes - breads, cakes, Foster....  I was surprised at the weight and texture of this cake, and in a good way.  It was moist and heavy, but still more cake than bread, which is precisely what I wanted. I tried the recipe because I didn't have time to search for my mother's and needed a cake in a hurry.  It's delicious.  In fact, my husband and his hunting buds all asked me to make THIS their banana cake.  Done!  I am making a second one today and am baking it in two layers.  If it turns out as well as I anticipate, I'll post a photo.

This is amazing! I don’t think my husband will ever want me to bake banana bread again! I think it is perfect just the way it is, but cream cheese frosting is so easy to make that I will try it that way too!

This was a great recipe but my cake didn’t cook up in the center very well. Left it in the 275* oven for 70 mins and the sides were ready but the center wasn’t.  Had no room in freezer so I left it in frig longer. All in all the cooked part of the cake was moist and tasty!  Next time I will try to cook at 350* to insure the cake is fully cooked evenly.

It was truly moist and delicious! I also added fresh blueberries as a topping, and the acidity of the blueberries balanced the sweetness of the buttercream perfectly!

And it keeps very well in the chiller too! And tastes best, served chilled!

This afternoon, I will be experimenting with incorporating fresh blueberry coulis into the vanilla buttercream, and subsequently topping the entire cake with fresh blueberries, just to see if the cake could be improved even further !

Double the bananas and increase the temp to 300.  SUPER DELICIOUS and very moist. Substituted half and half combined with 1 tbsp lemon juice for the buttermilk. I only used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar in the cream cheese frosting.

this is my first try baking banana cake and i was not wrong in choosing this recipe. ive made it for my mother's 79th birthday today....whoala everyone loves this version!
ive added ground cinnamon sprinkled in the topping.
just one comment that we find it too sweet so i guess it just needs to reduced the sugar. also, the taste of cream cheese is not noticeable.
will definitely make this again and again in the future with a little modification.
thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is the best cake i have ever made.!  The only change is I added 1 Tablespoon of Crystallized Ginger, which I chopped into small pieces.  I found this recipe because I felt guilty about throwing away a bunch of bananas that had gone uneaten.  When I peeled them, they were perfect so I  came across this recipe and the rest is history!

This cake is so good.   I think I am going to try this trick with a chocolate cake.
Thank you for the recipe.  I was a wee bit sceptical at first but it really works.

This recipe is all over the place. The low temperature of 275 made this cake take over an hour and a half to bake. That is fifty percent longer than what the recipe calls for.  This recipes needs revamped.

Oh my goodness, So Tasty! I made this today for my hubby’s birthday. I made as directed with 2 exceptions. I tend to whip the ingredients when it says “mix well”, “light and fluffy” etc. The other is that it took an extra 15-20 minutes in my older electric oven. I highly recommend this recipe.

Oh my this is so good! I followed the directions exactly except 1/2 the recipe for a 8x8.  Baked at 275 for 50 minutes and bumped the oven to 300 for 10 minutes. Not done so I bumped to 325 for another 10 and it was good. (Might need to check my oven Temp.)  Very rich, moist cake.  Great way to use over ripe bananas!

I really wanted to trust the poster when they said time and temp is correct but I should have trusted my instincts. 1hr at 275 left me with a raw middle. I trusted the process and put it in freezer thinking that carryover cooking and cooling would take care of the rest. But, it did not. Definitely half batter/half cake in the middle and I should have trusted my instincts. My oven is a new double oven, my thermometer inside reading properly and one hour just isn’t enough. The part that is cooked is wonderfully moist and tasty. The only part I changed was using milk+lemon juice to sub buttermilk, which I did not have on hand.

I have made this cake four times. It is superior in flavor and texture! The freezer instructions are unusual but the results are very very moist. It didn’t need the frosting in my opinion.

It was alright not enough banana flavor in my opinion. The icing is yummy but I used about 1 cup less icing sugar.  If I make it again Im going to try doubling the bananas to 3cups (about 6)

This cake is the best!  I just made it for the second time.  The only thing I did different was I made sour milk instead of using buttermilk.  I also added dulce de leche to the cream cheese frosting.  We love this cake.

Without a doubt, the best banana cake ever! I did use 2 c bananas (I had so many in the freezer) because I really love the banana flavor.  I absolutely believe that the part about putting it in the freezer is really part of the moistness. I may never make plain banana bread again!

I made this recipe as written except I added more bananas (they were ripe & I needed to use them up).  I used a 9x13 glass pan, the cake was still quite jiggly after 1 hour @ 275 degrees so I baked it an additional 20 minutes. I left the cake in the freezer for 1 hour to compensate for the additional baking time.  The cake was very moist and a very pretty golden brown on top. I was (happily) surprised how fast the cake went from very jiggly to being done so check it often. It was delicious and I will make again. I threw half the frosting away as we like a very thin amount of frosting so I will only make half of the frosting recipe in the future. This is the first cake that I have ever baked @ 275 degrees or ever put in the freezer straight from the oven using a wooden cutting board under the pan to shield already frozen food in the freezer. I am so glad that I did since the end result was very good.

This cake is very good and the frosting is delicious with a few tweaks. 1st things first I have an electric regular stove not convection. Making thecake following directions does not work with this type of stove. I baked at the recommended temp for an hour and it was jiggly and loose. I upped the temp to 350 for 25 minutes and it baked. My freezer was full so I just let it rest out. I found it very tasty but a bit too sweet. I would omit 1/4 cup sugar next time. Also with the frosting I used 3 cups of confectioners sugar and it was yummy. I would have given it 5 stars but if it wasn't for other reviews I wouldn't have been able to cook this properly.

This recipe was so so YUMMY!! This is definitely going to be added to my favorite recipes. The flavor was spot on not to sweet but sweet enough to keep you going back bite after bite, the texture was spot on, and the frosting oh my!!  My only concern with this cake is that I don’t have any discipline with this BANANA CAKE

This recipe did not disappoint!  It is moist and dense the way you would expect a banana cake recipe to be.  Do not let the low baking temperature scare you away.  Just be sure to know you may have to adjust the baking time for your oven.  Key is to freeze or refrigerate (which is what I did because I did not have freezer space) right away and I left it in overnight before adding the  frosting.   Delicious!

Amazing! Everyone loves it, did need to bake longer than an hour, 1 1/2 hr at 275.  Made a caramel frosting from this site as I added too much butter to the frosting in this recipe.

This recipe makes a unique, very dense and moist cake, with a thick and creamy cream cheese and butter frosting. I follow it exactly as described here, using the usual vinegar and milk (1tbs vinegar to 1c milk) buttermilk substitute.  I have made it several times and It’s always a crowd pleaser.

I am 70 years old and have tasted hundreds of cakes over the years I think this cake would be in my top 10. It’s nice to know I didn’t have to go to a fancy bakery to get such a moist and delicious cake! Don’t hesitate to make and follow all the directions. Don’t forget to put it in the freezer when it comes out of the oven. I believe that, and cooking it at the reduced heat is what makes it so moist.

I always have bananas left over and always making mini banana breads but this time I wanted something a bit different, and I found it..  I followed this recipe to the T, except I have my own cream cheese icing I used. As stated its moist and delicious, as recipe states all ovens are different therefore, baking times could vary, recipe states bake for an hour, mine took 1 hour 20 minutes, and I still wasn't sure that it was done, but it was,  and cool in freezer for 45 well that too took longer about 2x longer, no big deal, took it out iced her up and added some chopped pecans on top of icing.. WOW omg its so good.. I will do this again.  Tired of banana bread and banana crumb cakes, this one is another 5 star recipe.. tx for sharing.

I made exactly as per the recipe and it is far and away the best banana cake I've ever had.  It is so moist and delicious, in my opinion, it doesn't even need the frosting.  I will use this recipe in the future for banana bread and banana cake.

I made this cake for my son’s 2nd birthday and we let him dig in! I omitted the lemon juice and added 3/4 cup chocolate morsels; otherwise baked as in the recipe. For the frosting, I made it in the food processor with one package of cream cheese, half cup of whipping cream and some regular sugar to taste. Such a delicious and moist cake! Very banana-y taste.

Delicious, and a hit with my family! I only gave it 4 stars because I had to bake it for 25 more minutes. After an hour, the middle was raw. I was short 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, but the frosting was delicious, regardless!

Everyone loves this cake! I make it in a jelly roll/half sheet pan and serve it like bars.  No forks needed!  I've also replaced the bananas with pumpkin puree and added spices and it makes wonderful pumpkin bars.

Just finished a piece of this cake - made it tonight for the first time. DELICIOUS. Moist, as promised! Perfect banana flavor, not too sweet. I followed the directions exactly, but had to add 17 extra minutes (6/6/5) to the baking time - my oven temp must be off. BF and I loved the cake, will definitely be making this again. This will be my go-to recipe for the next time I have bananas turning brown. (I used four frozen, brown bananas and one fresh banana since the four didn't quite make a cup and a half.)

This cake turned out perfectly!! It was so moist with just the right amount of sweetness & banana flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes to be totally done. I’ll be making this one again!!!

Okay, so where do I begin?  I cannot properly describe the decadence of this cake while keeping it "G" rated.  I will try: moist, sumptuous, mouth-watering, flavorful.  Need I continue?  

I use all organic ingredients, which greatly enhances the flavor,.  It is definitely more expensive, but the flavor is deeper and, in my opinion, worth it.  

Full disclosure: I filled the layers with home-make pastry cream and iced it with brown-sugar buttercream, topped with a little dark chocolate ganache.  THE best cake ever, according to all who partook!

After reading all the reviews, I made this following the original directions, TWICE! Except for adding 10-15 extra minutes of baking, the directions are spot on and this is our new favorite cake. Mike husband has declared it his new birthday cake request.

There really was no need to put this in the freezer it was moist regardless.  I’ve tried many banana cake recipes and I have to admit it’s a little too sweet and heavy for my liking.

This is hands down one of the best cakes ever!  After making it multiple times, I've found I can put it in the fridge instead of the freezer to cool, then let it finish cooling on a rack.  My only change in the recipe is the frosting.  Make it as directed but eliminate the cream cheese.  Then fold in a pint (or less if desired) of very stiffly whipped unsweetened whipping cream.  This cuts the sweetness of the dessert and makes a nice balance between cake and frosting.  Keep the cake refrigerated until gone, which never takes long at my house.

I've been making this recipe for a very long time. It is the very best...tastes just like the banana cakes of our youth.  Dense, moist and lots of flavor.  (One reviewer said it was more like banana bread.  This is not a light cake.  My guess is that review had never had banana cake before). This cake is such a hit with my family that  it's our traditional birthday cake in our house.  I have one sitting in my freezer right now waiting to be frosted for tonight's birthday party.  My friends beg me to bring this cake to gatherings.  It's known as "Pat's Banana Cake" but I know I've only borrowed it from Cindy who originally posted it here.  :)  I couldn't help but read through some of the reviews and I thought I'd add my two cents for those who have not made this cake before.  First, follow the recipe for the cake EXACTLY.  Yes, the oven temp is 275.  Trust me on that.  And, yes, do put in the freezer!  Wow, what a difference that makes.  I've bought cake pans with lids.  I first put in freezer without the lid and then, after it's cooled, I add the lid and keep in the freezer.  This cake lasts a good six months in a deep freeze.  It can even be frozen after it's frosted and it's incredible!  Seriously....this is a no fail cake! More on ingredients... be sure that your bananas are over ripe (turning black).  In fact, I find that bananas that have been frozen and then thawed make the best cake!  It's best with real buttermilk, too. I use only 3 cups of powdered sugar for the fros

I should have known better. I think it’s a typo that you bake the cake at 275.  After an hour in the oven, I  Just cranked it to 375 .  We will see how it turns out.

Absolutely awesome cake! I highly recommend it. I  cooked at 250 degrees on convection because recipe called for 275 degrees.  It took 1.5 hours to cook.  I recommend cooking at 275 degrees convection when done  put cake directly in freezer.  Cake is very moist.

I was skeptical about the outcome of this recipe but did go ahead and make it exactly as stated. It was not done in the center after one hour. Now I am trying to finish baking it so it is edible. BIG flop. This is the 1st recipe on All Recipes that did not turn out.

I saw how popular this was and thought I’d give it a try. I had twice as much banana as was called for, so I decided to make a double batch. For it, I used my 18” x 12” x 2” aluminum cake pan. I realized, after it was in the oven, that I didn’t have enough room in my freezer to place it, so I cooled it on the counter. Due to its size, it also took an extra 45 minutes to bake thoroughly, but even so, this cake was amazingly moist and so flavorful. I’m so happy I gave it a try. I’ll definitely be baking this again.

I made this over the weekend and I have none left. I had to use applesauce in place of the eggs since my daughter is highly allergic to eggs. I did have to increase the baking time by 20 minutes. I followed it exactly as written and my husband said it’s now his favorite cake ever! He hates cake so this is high praise. I also had a few other friends over and they all said this cake was hands down the best cake they have ever had and would take it over and kind of banana bread any day. Thanks for one fantastic recipe!!!!!!!

I followed this recipe as written and it is phenomenal.  I am not a big cake fan but I would make this again and again.  I plan on experimenting with different types of fruit next time.  The frosting may become my "go to" for anything needing frosting in the future.  It is that good!

This turned out pretty good but wasn't as moist as expected.  The frosting is WAY too sweet, so if I'd make it again, I would reduce the sugar by half.  Other than that it wasn't bad.

Loved this cake! I made the recipe as listed and it came out delicious and moist. I did have to cook it for about 10 minutes longer, the toothpick came out wet the first time. I only let it sit in the freezer for about 20 minutes (being impatient to taste) and it turned out fine. I can see how it may be too sweet for some but the sugar can be adjusted as desired. I will absolutely be making this again!

This banana cake is super soft and delicious. I added 2 tablespoon of sour cream. Added a total of 2c of bananas. Did not put it in the freezer. And I used whole milk instead of buttermilk.  And it took about 1hr and 45 mins to bake.

Tasted great, but overall the cake is very dense (especially when chilled in refrigerator). 3-cups of all-purpose flour is a lot.

I had some bananas I needed to use up so thought I’d give this recipe a try.  I started reading reviews and thought eh’ 5 stars 2k + made it...I’m makin’ this recipe as is.  I’m not a big baker but after I made this cake you would think I was a renowned pastry/baker - whatever!!!!  Follow it to a tee and you’ll have a crowd pleaser!!!!   Even peeps who weren’t huge into banana anything enjoyed a slice! 

Thanks for sharing!!!

Initially, I was concerned over the low baking temperature and time. I found I need to add over 20 minutes extra in my oven.  

I omitted "freezer" step for fear of damaging my freezer. The resulting moisture content of this cake is very moist and he buttercream-cream cheese frosting nicely compliments the cake.   

I am rating this "4 out of 5 stars" rating due to its instructional inaccuracies. The result was very delicious and well received by all so I will be making this again.

Followed the recipe but had to do some slight changes due to wheat allergy - 
(1) Used Pamela's Artisan Gluten-Free Flour Blend  (expensive but worth it!) 2c
(2) 1c almond flour 
(3) cut the sugar down to 2c
(4) had to do the milk & vinegar thing - no buttermilk.
(5) lined with parchment (can't waste expensive flour)
(6) did 30m @ 325 convection and turned it 
 and 25m @ 300 convection. I didn't place it in the freezer but when it got cooler, it went in the fridge for several hours.
Smells great  -  We'll see how it turns out. This could get 5 stars in the end. :)
***Update***  Definitely 5 stars!  UNBELEIVEABLE! My family polished this off in within 2 days.  We topped it off with s bit of chocolate drizzle - it was heaven!

1st time I made a 1/2 sheet pan, the second time I made cup cakes it makes 36 regular cupcakes I baked them for about 30 minutes at 275.  I did not put them in the freezer because I didn't have the room but they are still so moist and delicious!

I've had this cake in the oven on 275 as directed for an hour and 15 minutes and it's no where near being done or even set. In  addition, it overflowed all down the sides of the 9x13 cake pan and all over the bottom of my oven. I may never know how it tastes because there may not be anything left to eat. If I try it again, I will use a larger, deeper cake pan and maybe bump the temperature to 325.

this was not only the best banana cake I've ever had this is the best cake I've ever had! Make sure you follow the directions and it will come out wonderful.  Be sure to set your butter out to let it get soft so that it is easier to cream with the sugar. Make sure your bananas are ripe with spots! The buttermilk, eggs and butter should all be set out and at room temperature before use.

It’s delicious. I followed the recipe as stated. I was glad that comments confirmed the temperature and putting it in the freezer. The only thing I changed was to add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to the icing and sprinkle 2/3 cup of chopped toasted pecans on top. Yummm!

This cake is just wonderful!!!  I've made it so many times.  I do add some banana flavoring to the batter and a little to the frosting just to amp it up a bit.  But even without it,  this cake is just so good!!

This is the BEST banana cake I've ever made, and I've made a few!  Moist, flavorful, fabulous!!   I did use a caramel icing instead of the cream cheese suggested, but that was only because caramel icing is my daughter's favorite and this was made for her baby shower.  It was definitely a crowd pleaser!

It is everything wonderful I read in the reviews. I do find that often recipes are too heavy with the sugar. It hides the keynotes you are expecting, in this case, bananas. I reduced the sugar to 1 -1/2 cups of sugar. I used 3 medium size bananas ranging from practically all brown to some spots.  The sweetness of the bananas provides suffice sweetness and the role of the frosting is allowed to also shine.
I did stick to the 275 temp, but the time did extend an additional 20 minutes.

I wanted two pans of banana nut cake.  Everything was doubled EXCEPT the white sugar and the powder sugar I kept as the recipe called.  I don't like super sweet deserts.  I added three cups of chopped walnuts.  This was AMAZING!  Just right sweetness!  Will make it again and again!!

We love this cake! Is super delish and easy to make. I would skip the aluminum foil tho. The first time I made it I used aluminum foil and after storing the cake had an unpleasant after taste. The second time around we skipped that, and we ate EVERY SINGLE CRUMB! Getting ready to make another this weekend for Mother’s Day !

This was very good, but like others the time in the oven was much longer for me.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing!  I will definitely make it again!

Delicious cake! I was introduced to this cake because my daughter had sent a picture to me of her failed attempt at making this cake for her husbands birthday, ( she’s not a cook). I went through the recipe with her and she was sure she had done it correctly. So the next day I made it. I took some video to share with my daughter about what it should look like as it gets mixed. My cake did take nearly 2 hours to completely bake. Then I popped it into the freezer, frosted it and pulled out a slice for my husband and I to share. PERFECT! So moist and full of banana flavor. I will make this one again for sure. (We did figure out that what my daughter thought was the flour was actually the sugar, oops)

This cake disappeared immediately! It was moist and delicious. The only thing I added was a packet of banana pudding. Amazing recipe and I will definitely be making again.

Yum!  I made the recipe exactly as written. This cake is very light and moist.  It's a snap to make.  I only found it needed 5 minutes extra bake time.  I thought it would need more as it jiggled at the 60 minute mark, but  it firmed up quickly.  If you like bananas, do yourself a favor and make this cake, it is really good.

Amazing sooo delicious but I often must keep it in the oven longer as the center is usually still a bit swampy at the 1 hr mark. So scrumptious u don’t even understand how much everyone in my family loves this cake! Thank you so much for sharing!!!!!

Excellent! Found the time off though and question the temp at 275. I made a peanut butter icing that was not too sweet and was the perfect combo.

Hands down the best banana cake ever!  Don't be afraid do exactly as the directions state and you will love it.  I did switch mine up the second time I made it in a cake sheet pan so it was a little thinner and I shaved off about 15 mins from the hour cook time turned out great either way.

I love this recipe, my family loves this recipe!! The only thing I did differently was the buttermilk, I didn’t have any so I made some using coconut milk & vinegar, I also used 1/2 cup of Willies Coffee Liqueur (it’s from Montana & blows Bailey’s away), so I used 1/2 C of Willies & and 1C coconut milk & 2 tsp vinegar. I also put a little strong coffee & some Willies Coffee liqueur in the frosting. I grated some Espresso Biscuit & Ganache Kit Kat on top. Sometimes when making this cake I add walnuts, depending on who I am baking it for, same goes for sprinkling chopped nuts on top of frosting

I followed the recipe with the following modifications.
I used self rising flour, 
 omitted the baking powder  and lemon juice.  

At 275 degrees, my oven took 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake. 

i placed it in freezer and made the icing.  it's delicious.  A definite crowd pleaser.

Made no changes to the recipe.   The texture and flavor of this cake was perfection.  Succulent is the best term to use in describing this cake.  I followed directions to a T.  My husband is not a huge banana flavor fan and he ate half the cake by himself.  His favorite has always been Texas Sheet Cake and he said he thinks this cake won him over as the best.  My new favorite cake to make.

The recipe was the best I have ever made from scratch. I wanted to do something else than make banana bread with my ripe bananas! If you find that the cake is still jiggly after an hour - don't fret - I did - but it just needs more time!

I made this cake EXACTLY as written and INSTRUCTED and it is SO DELICIOUS!!!  After seeing how it is baked and frozen I just had to try this. And I’m so glad I did. It is so moist and flavorful. I recommend using very ripe bananas as it really adds to the flavor of this cake. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE for any banana lover. Thank you so much for the recipe. It’s a keeper in my household.

Delicious! It came out light and moist. I used a little less sugar and substituted almond milk for the buttermilk. I sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top after frosting it. I will definitely  makes this again and again.

The cake is delicious.  I beat the batter on medium high for a couple of mins as I think this makes a lighter cake. I also added walnuts in my batter.  I had the batter in the pan and just put it in the oven and was looking over the recipe one last time when I realized I didn’t put the milk in (I use milk with vinegar) so huried up and scraped out of the pan and stirred in the milk.  Back in the oven on 275 but it took an hour and a half to bake.  I did set it out in the freezing weather here in PA as I saw someone else mention that when they too had no room in the freezer and it worked great.  My neighbor gave this 5 stars and so did my family.  I used cream cheese icing but sprinkled nuts on top.  I did take a picture but haven’t figured out how to post it with my review.

The cake is dense like banana bread , but so very moist and flavorful  it can be served as a dessert or breakfast  sweet bread. My husband eats it with his morning coffee .

Excellent!  Only changes were I baked it in a bundt pan, used only half the frosting and sprinkled with chopped walnuts.

Great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except added walnuts to the batter.  It did need to cook a little longer.  Worth the wait!  Thanks for sharing.

Not sure recipe directions are correct. I do a lot of baking and this did not bake properly even at  a bit over an hour was still a mess in the middle. Took a very long time to make for it to end up in the trash.

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made. I made one change that put it over the top. I added freeze dried bananas that I turned to powder and added it to the frosting. Holy moly, the frosting made the cake. I bought a bag of freeze dried bananas from Trader Joe’s, put them in a blender and turned them to powder, then added the powder until I liked the taste, nearly half the bag. Wow, I highly recommend doing this.

if you are looking for a great and easy recipe to use those bananas that are too soft for normal consumption, try this recipe.  DO NOT forget the icing - in fact toss the cake and eat the bowl of icing yourself.  
PS: try the freezer trick.  It works but the cake will not be ready for dessert unless you plan ahead (I didn't).

It was delicious and moist but it was more like banana bread and less like cake. I did make the following changes: substituted AP flour with cake flour baked in two 9” square pans. I made sure to use room temperature butter and beat it with the sugar within an inch of its life. Great banana bread. If you know what I could have done differently please let me know!

Made it 3 times exactly like the directions. I have made Banana cakes before, but until I saw this one. I take this one to work for all the employees. They rave about it. Follow these directions and the cake will be the winner

Followed recipe verbatim. Moist, light, flavorful cake. Yielded 12 muffins and a medium bundt. 4 medium bananas needed for 1 1/2 cups mashed. Easily could add chopped nuts, flaked coconut, cinnamon, mini chips...ooohhh there’s a thought. Caramel bits. Thanks for recipe.

Delicious cake! Great banana flavor and easy to make. Mine did come out a little dense but next time I will cream the eggs and butter longer. In my oven it took just over an hour at 275. I suggest keeping an oven thermometer on hand not just for this recipe but for all recipes. Temp really does make a difference and can easily be off without one knowing.

My MO is to dig through all the reviews here for any alterations people are trying. However, for this cake I made no real changes. (I did add some espresso powder, some almond paste, and did add one more banana than called for). Sheet cakes are not my favorite presentation; I wanted to use a bunt pan. I also wanted to drizzle Dulce De Leche all over it before putting the cream cheese frosting on. All that to say, I used the correct pan & followed along. It baked up beautifully at the low temperature, so fluffy! And I was happy to stick it in the freezer so I could leave on time. It was still warm after 45 minutes. But I painted on some simple sugar soak, tossed on my favorite sour cream/cream cheese frosting, and flew out the door. Everyone had a 2nd slice and loved it.

I read a bunch of the reviews first to verify the oven temp and timing. But this cake is outstanding!  I didn't make the frosting - It's tasty as-is or warmed with butter or plain cream cheese. 
A few changes I did make: I added about an extra 1/2 cup of bananas because I needed to use them up, so I used 1/4 cup less milk. My husband can't do diary, so I used almond milk instead of buttermilk and shortening instead of real butter. I also added a teaspoon of baking powder. I did it by accident, but it worked out. 
I used a convection oven, which normally speeds up the cooking time, but I still had to bake at 275 for about 1 hour 20 minutes before the middle cooked completely. 
I beat the "butter" and sugar REALLY REALLY well to start. I have noticed how much that helps in all recipes that call to cream them together. 
I added each egg separately and really let it mix in between. Some reviews said this was a dense/thick/heavy cake, but I did not find that . It turned out very light and fluffy for me.

Followed the directions exactly and the cake turned out perfect. Moist and flavorful. However, I found the icing to be way too sweet.  Really overwhelms the flavor of the cake. Next time I will use less powdered sugar in the icing.

This cake was so moist and delicious!  I didn’t taste it until the day after I made it and it was so good.  Although the directions seem strange, they really work to make an unforgettable cake. I used the Cool Whip frosting  (Cool Whip, vanilla pudding, and vanilla) instead of the cream cheese frosting .

I can not rate this as high as it should be rated. Probably the best banana cake i have ever had. People told me it could “win a prize”.  I made it exactly as written.    Next time i might try a cream cheese icing recipe i have for banana cupcakes that is Cream cheese cinnamon and honey. Its not from this site, but can be googled.

This cake was amazing! I followed the recipe exactly except it needed more cooking time, after 1 hour at 275 it was still soupy, so I turned the temp to 325 for an additional 15 plus minutes until the internal temp was just under 210. I will definitely make this again!

Really nice.  Light, subtle, sweet which makes the banana come through. And  who doesn't like a cream cheese frosting??

Also, I had to put mine in refrigerator; it really makes it moist. 

Next time.....cupcakes instead of 9x13!

Oh my goodness!  This cake is so delicious!  I did not change the cake even though the directions were unusual, and it was perfect. I decided to make a caramel icing instead of the cream cheese and it was fantastic. Make this cake today!

Followed the recipe to a "T," but cut it in half and used an 8 X 8 -pan. Omitted the frosting - it is great. Very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again.

I  did change recipe, I used white and brown sugar but no vanilla as the price has gone up. I added chopped pecans also. No lemon juice also. Cake is in the freezer at the moment so we will see how it taste when I take it out.

The cake tastes great, but I followed the recipe and had to add 15 minutes more. Then I had to kick the temperature up to 450 to finish it.

This cake is amazing! Followed the directions as written. It has great flavor and is so moist. My family devoured it! The only difference I had was the baking time. It took 1 hour and 25 minutes. Just make sure to watch and check for doneness with a toothpick. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! I would have used more cream cheese and less powdered sugar for the frosting, because it was a little too sweet for my preference. The cake itself was VERY moist and delicious!!!

This is an excellent cake as is. Moist. Perfect crumb texture.
However I do not understand the baking temp, and the cooling in the freezer. As the chef at a personal care home, I have made this cake multiple times for my residents here at work. I triple the recipe, exactly as written. But I bake it as a sheet cake, at 350 degrees for approximately 45 minutes. Then cool in the pan, and ice with the cream cheese frosting as directed. No cooling in the freezer. Comes out perfect every time. So as I said.... a wonderful recipe. I just don't agree with the baking and cooling instructions.

Mine was a disaster. I followed all the directions and measured carefully, but for some reason while the cake was baking, it rose up over the side and ran over, burning onto the electric element and bottom of the oven. After it trashed the oven, I transferred it to the freezer, so I could clean it, too (only crumbs there).

WOW!!! this is a fantastic cake.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out fantastic...tender, moist and absolutely delicious.  I've never baked a cake using the slow oven-freezer technique, but it sure makes a huge difference.  If you haven't tried this yet, don't delay.  It's the best banana cake I've ever had.  And, for all those who had problems,  FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!  I hate it when people don't follow the original recipe or make substitutions and then blame it on the recipe when it doesn't turn out.  If you make this cake as written, it will be the best you've ever made.  thanks Cindy for a memorable recipe

I followed the directions exactly as stated. I am not much of a cook, but this cake was perfect.  I did add one mashed banana to the icing which was delicious.  Also, it had to bake 14 extra minutes.

This cake is divine.   The cooking time is way, way off.  I made as directed and cooked 1 1/2 hours at 275 and it was still not done.  added 10 more min and bumped temp up to 325.  Perfect.  Put in freezer for 30 min.  So moist.  Since we do not like super sweet frosting I simply started with 1 cup sugar and gradual added to taste.  Will definitely be making this again.

Followed the recipe exactly as is. I cooked dinner for four and had no comments about the meal. But, after desert everyone wanted to know where that cake came from. They couldn't stop raving about it and couldn't believe that I made it, (a guy)! 
Both cake and frosting recipes are absolute winners/keepers.

This cake was sooo delicious.   Very moist and not too sweet.  My family loved it.  Instead of  nuts on top I drizzled chocolate.  The kind that hardens.  So each bite had a bit of chocolate in it. My husband was mad when I snatched the last piece! Lol. Hey, I made it, I get the last piece!

I followed the recipe except that I don't like really sweet frosting, so I used a cup less confectioner's sugar.  I had to bake the cake for 1 1/2 hours, then put it in the freezer as directed.  It's a very light cake, not heavy as others indicated.  I did whip the butter and sugar for a while, and beat the mixture quite a lot as I was adding the buttermilk and flour.  Then I gently folded in the bananas.  Maybe all that whipping is necessary to make a light cake. The cake is delicious, but even with less sugar in the frosting, the frosted cake is very sweet.  I can understand why many people eat it without frosting.  I will definitely make it again, but to decorate it I'll dust with powdered sugar or drizzle with a glaze.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years but am only now reviewing it. It is sooooo good! The only thing that I do differently is that I use a cake sheet instead of 9x13 because I love cream cheese icing, and I love the icing/cake ratio that it gives. This way, I can take it to functions and get more mileage out of it, too. Everyone who has ever tried it seems to love it. My family will devour it, so I generally only make it to take somewhere that we can share it. I make the cake exactly; the only thing I change is that I like my icing more cream cheesy and less sweet, so I don't add as much sugar to it.
The low baking temp and longer time make it super moist. (I think the "most helpful critical review" must have not done it quite right, tbh. )

I made this cake for a group of my friends and they loved it. I used some organic bananas that I had in the freezer (thawed them at room temperature) I would make it again without changing one thing. I was a little skeptical about taking it  out of the oven and placing it directly in the freezer, but the cake was extremely moist.

This is the most amazing cake! Made exactly as the recipe was written other than didn't have room in the freezer so put in refrigerator. Moist and amazing flavor. Chocolate cake has always been my favorite but not any longer. I am not much of a sweets person but I have to admit I did eat half of this cake!

If you like Banana Bread you'll love this! I made this as directed but added walnut pieces on top. The icing was the best to me but my husband loved the whole thing.

If you cut the recipe in half (change to 9 servings), it will perfectly make 12 cupcakes.  I used cake flour (minus 1 tbsp) 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 egg (2 bananas is the right amount needed). For the frosting I used 3/4 cup powdered sugar.  Bake at 275 convection bake for 50 minutes then freezer for 20 minutes and it’s light and fluffy every time (make sure to beat the butter sugar mixture until it is fluffy).

I made this cake exactly as specified.  It is superb.  I cringed at the butter, but, hey, it's a cake.  If you make it, don't substitute or you will be disappointed.  Your family or guests will love it!

I made this and found it has way too much sugar in it. I cut  the sugar in half, did not put it in the freezer at all after baking nor did I do anything with it except overnight on counter on a rack . Over all, the cake was fabulous and I will make it again. So moist and it won't take long before it's gone. I took half the batter and baked it for one hour in two 8x8 pans. Perfect!

I’ve made this multiple times for us it is so thick and moist.  You must put it immediately in the freezer as the recipe states for extra moistness, it is worth it.  The cream cheese frosting is perfect as well!

very delish, loved the frosting, the cake was messy to bake and I questioned the low Temp. it took 20 min. longer. i also remade it the next day to cupcakes, that was a mistake as they all spilled over, and very hard to peel the papers off

This was a fluffy and tasty cake. It was quite sweet though. Next time I may reduce the sugar for myself. Icing was tasty. I made as is except that I 1/2 recipe and made 12 regular and 12 mini muffins. Cooked for 25-35/40 mins. I also used kefir instead of buttermilk as that is all I had on hand.
A friend said that it didn't even need the icing.

If you are skeptical about this cake, don’t be!  It is downright AMAZING! It is perfect and moist! The low temperature makes it perfect! Make sure to not skip the 45 minute freezer step! It makes it 10 times better!

The cake is light  and absolutely delicious.
I made the following changes:
1.5 T lemon juice, added to 2% milk instead of using buttermilk, Lily White soft flour (like cake flour)
used 1C light brown sugar and 1 1/8C white sugar
Recipe made 2 8" round layers plus 9 cupcakes (filled very full, as suggested)
Cupcakes baked in 45 minutes, cake layers in 1 hour (convection).  Light and delicious.  Doesn't need frosting (couldn't resist eating an un-iced cupcake), but did ice the remaining.  Added 1 T lemon juice to icing recipe.

Co-workers loved this. Very moist. I did not bother with lemon juice on bananas. Just tossed bananas in with wet ingredients before dry ingredients and buttermilk step. I also did not have room in freezer so I put it in fridge overnight.  Did not do this frosting as I had leftover cream cheese frosting from another cake. Will definitely make again. Maybe I’ll add chocolate chips next time.

I made it according to the recipe. When baking time was up, I tested with toothpick, it was clean so I assumed it was done. Set it aside to cool & when I went to frost it later it had fallen in the middle. The middle was still raw despite the clean toothpick test. I had to scoop the middle out & put in another pan to bake some more. Would never make this cake again. Taste is good, but could not even frost it due to the scrambled mess it made. Not sure how so many get a 5 star result, but I won't make it again, that's for sure.

This cake is amazing. Very soft and moist. I made exactly as the recipe stated. My only issue was the baking time.  I did the low heat but it took 1hour and 50 min. To bake through. Not a problem but I’m glad I didn’t have to go anywhere and well worth the longer bake time as it was delicious.

This is the 4th time I've made this cake. The family loves it and having it as dessert is becoming a holiday tradition.
My only hint is to buy 5 ripe bananas a few days in advance, peel and freeze them in a ziplock bag. The day before you are planning on making the cake remove the bag from the freezer and thaw in the refrigerator. The bananas thaw into a thick liquid mush which mixes easily into the batter.

I made it exactly as stated and it was perfect.  I didn't change a thing.  There is nothing wrong with these instructions if you use the right pan, carefully measure your ingredients and make sure your oven is actually the right temperature.  Been making this for years and it's perfect every time.

Incredible!!!! I made this for my dad's birthday last year and I still can't stop thinking about it. It's my favorite cake I've ever made!!! I had to cool it in the freezer wayyyy longer than The instructions said to before I put the frosting on, but it's a perfect trick to keep the cake moist.

As it was the first time trying this recipe, I followed the directions rather carefully.  I was prepared to bake it longer, given the many comments to that effect.  I had to bake it 1 hour and 22 minutes at 275° F to reach correct degree of doneness.  I suspect the originator of this recipe is using a larger pan than the 9x13 pyrex I used, both because of the longer baking time and because the batter very generously filled the pan--almost overfilled it.  Speaking of generous, the amount of frosting was too much by about half again.  I had leftovers even after spreading a generous layer on the cake.  If I made it again, I would cut the frosting to a 2/3 recipe of what's listed here.  The cake was deliciously moist as advertised, but a little bit bland in flavor and sweeter than I like it.  I missed the walnut flavor that most banana cakes entail.

OMG....this is the best banana cake recipe I have ever made.   I added a cup of chopped nuts and didn't have buttermilk, so added 1 1/2 tablespoons to milk.  Baked at 325 for 1 hr, then into freezer for 45 minutes.  Used my cream cheese frosting recipe.  My husband didn't want me to share with others as it was so good.   I did share with a few and they want me to make it for them. Will definitely make it to my favorites list.

Made it almost exactly,  traded some of the white sugar for brown.  Finished it today and it was as moist as it was 4 days ago.  This is a winner.

Made this several times. I did cut the sugar back to 1 3/4 C. as the bananas add a lot of sweetness. Also added blueberries on top.

I made this cake because I had some very ripe bananas on hand and oh boy am I glad I did!  My whole family loved it!  The only thing was that it took longer than an hour.  Next time I will check it after about an hour and 45 minutes.  Other than that it was absolutely perfect!

This cake is so good!  I did have to keep it in the oven for another hour.  My youngest daughter hates cream cheese frosting, but she loved this recipe.  My middle daughter wants me to make it again for her birthday.  My husband raved too!  This will definitely be in my repertoire from now on!!!

I was worried about the temperature also but I did cook at 275 but after an hour it was still liquid in the middle. I turned it up to 300 and at 90 minuets it was finally done. No room in freezer but it is so moist and dense. I put crushed Nillas on the top.

Great cake! I am not a baker and thought this was a little beyond me as I had to make the buttermilk and my butter didn’t get creamy when trying to mix it in with the sugar, but I added the eggs and it seems to work out good. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it is the best banana cake and icing I’ve ever had!! It’s just took a lot longer to mix and complete from beginning to end, which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Plan to spend a good part of the afternoon making it is all, but if you have the time, it’s totally worth it!

Followed recipe exactly, including the pan size, though I was in doubt. Whole thing overflowed in my oven and at 2 hours was still wet in the center. I actually can and do bake; this was a nightmare.  Tastes good if you persevere through the mess.

The best banana cake! Since I’m not a sweet tooth, when the banana is really sweet, I reduce the sugar on the batter and the frosting. Nothing else I would change, this is just perfect!

(2010) A keeper! This produced a very moist and tender cake! I made a dozen cupcakes + three 6” rounds (cupcakes: 30 min. 6" round: 55 min). I left it in freezer much longer than 45 min (actually, left it in for days).  The cupcakes, after thawing in microwave, were very good.  The flavor is not very banana-y (even though I used very ripe bananas), but I actually prefer that.  Even though I reduced sugar to 2 cups, it  was still a tad too sweet -- so next time, I'll reduce the sugar further to 1½  - 1¾ cups. I love the texture, and would like to try experimenting with swapping the banana with different flavors like applesauce, pumpkin, extracts, etc.  I want to try making a white / yellow cake (without banana) using this method.

NOTE 1: This is also known as “Freezer Trick Banana Cake with Cream Cheese Icing” (in the Cooking Light forums), and "Best Ever Banana Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting" (in Recipezaar.com / Food.com / GeniusKitchen.com)

NOTE 2:  After a couple of weeks in freezer, I finally took out one of the 6” rounds & let it thaw on counter.  It was very soft & very moist – almost too moist that it’s a bit gummy.  When I cut a slice, it compresses and doesn’t spring back.  I don’t know if it’s due to being in freezer too long, or if I under-baked it initially (when I pulled it out of oven, I did worry if they were under-baked).

NOTE 3: some reviewers complained of frosting being too sweet. I suggest either decreasing the sugar –OR- use “Whipped Cream Cream Chees

It's okay.  I listened to the recipe and beat/mixed things for a greater period of time than I typically would. Still, it wasn't anything greater to me than banana bread. And in fact, it is pretty light and fluffy for the top 3/4. The bottom 1/4 was pretty dense. Most of the banana sunk to the bottom. So it's okay. Nothing special.

This is the most highly requested recipe I make. It's fantastic. You can't mess it up. Even when you half-heartedly throw all the ingredients together and skip the freezer step. It will still knock their socks off.

I work in an assisted living center and we were looking for new dessert recipes. I made this cake for the residents. They absolutely love this cake. I was given so many complaints from them how moist and delicious it was. I have to of course double it but it still turns out perfect. I was confused myself on the freezer part but it is definitely a moist cake after it comes out of the freezer.  I recommend anyone who wants a great banana cake this is the recipe to use. Don't question the temperature and the freezer, just do it and you won't be disappointed.

Haven't even tried it yet... But I can tell you the batter tasted amazing. I did add (eyeball) milk into the icing to make a little more easy to spread on. Didn't put in freezer but it cooled off nice. Next time I would bake in two 9" round pans for a layered cake.

I did not make any changes. It took a little over an hour in the oven (1:10).  My it for my daughter’s birthday, she requested a banana cake. I searched on Allrecipes & found this ... It turned out excellent!  In fact I made it twice, once for the family on her BD & once for her friends for her BD a week later.  For icing she requested a brown butter & second one made a butter cream, both were tasty.

This has become a favourite cake in our house, tried it once to use up some bananas.  Have been making it ever since.  Interesting though, how it says 30 min Prep time, Cook 1 hour - but it's ready in 2 hr 30 min?  Where does the other 1 hour come in?  I think the baking time listed as the 1 hour is way off.

This was the first Banana cake I've made and it was delicious! I did it exactly as written. Moist and light with an excellent flavour. I halved the recipe and that was good, otherwise I would have eaten even more of it!! My company loved it.

Great recipe, I have just reduced sugar to 1 and 3/4 cups and added banana slices before pouring the mixture and on top. Thumps up!

Absolutely love this cake! Our new favorite, it is moist, not to sweet, nice subtle banana flavor. I cooked it exactly how the recipe says, my oven temperature must be a little off because it took a little longer to get a clean toothpick, and put it straight into the freezer. I saved this recipe over a year ago and wish I made it sooner

I made this for A Christmas dessert and this is by far the best banana cake i have ever made.... i cup bake on the 10x sugar by a cup because I didn't want it too sweet.... I'm about to make it again this time going to your Jamaican banana rum instead of most of the milk in the cake and in the frosting.....

This is one of my absolute favorite cake recipes, which I make at least twice a year. I make some minor adjustments sometimes, such as using milk (or almond milk) + lemon juice (or sour cream) in place of  buttermilk. Instead of vanilla extract, I sometimes use almond extract. Chopped nuts can be added as a topping too.

This is fantastic!  I don’t really like cake. It’s usually ok, but mostly bland and mainly a delivery mechanism for the icing. Not this cake. It’s so moist and tastes incredible. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Go make it. You’ll love it!

I cut back on the sugar in the cake and frosting.  This was excellent and I will defiantly make again when I have Over ripe bananas.  I did put this in the refridgerator instead of the freezer as I did not have room in freezer.

I made this cake twice in one week and both cakes were gone quickly.  The only change I made was that I did not have any lemons.  So I  just mashed the bananas right before adding them to the batter.  This is a definite yes to make again.

Absolutely the best banana cake I have ever made! Only change was I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to 1  1/2 white cups sugar and to the 1 tsp vanilla I added 2 tsp of banana extract. I waited till everything was mixed before I smashed my 4 bananas so I didn't put any lemon on them. I made for a party and everyone raved about it! Thanks

As a child, I loved this store-bought dessert called a banana boat- a taco shaped cake filled with banana flavored cream. Searching for something to simulate this, I came across this recipe. It's not the same(better because it's all natural, with no preservatives), but it satisfies my banana craving. I like to bake this in two 9 inch round pans because it seems to rise higher and be fluffier inside. It's delicious plain or with the given frosting. I've also made it into a banana pudding cake by layering it with pudding, bananas and crumbled Nilla Wafers with whipped cream frosting (YUM!!!). Great recipe, definitely give it a try. One more thing, it did take about thirty additional minutes to bake to doneness.

Very delicious cake.   Never heard of putting cake in the freezer but it works.  I did add finely chopped walnuts into the cake and dusted the icing with walnuts.  I have made this cake 3 times in the last month.  My friends and family love it.

The whole family /friends absolutely love this.... so moist!                      
I've made this cake many times and it's definitely a favourite by all!  
I  changed the cake into a 9' round cake
(2) - 9" round pans - keep the oven temp. the same as directed--
Bake for 1hour and 15 -25 mins . after 1 hr 15 min, check for doneness, ovens may vary in accuracy in temperatures. 

I've made it GF by using a gluten free flour blend for my daughter  but I have to say it was a tad drier (which can be said with most recipes when using  GF  flour blends)then the regular flour but the flavour was just as good! 
GF flour bake for about an hour/ check for more time

--Frosting - for (2)  -  9" round cake pans - make 1 batch &  1/2 frosting recipe

This was an excellent recipe! I topped the finish product with Nilla wafers and sliced bananas. My coworkers and I LOVED it. It was incredibly moist and it was all gone within an hour of serving it. I'm going to try it with strawberries instead of bananas for a birthday cake for a friend. :)

Followed directions with cooking time and temp. Probably had to add another 20-30 mins to cook time. Stuck in freezer after and now my son and I are eating a delicious piece of golden banana cake. I didn't have cream cheese so decided not to make a frosting. Could add nuts and/or chocolate chips. Ps- putting cake in the freezer cools it quicker to eat :)

This recipe turned out delicious! I made this recipe at the last minute.  I didn't have enough regular milk (which I added the white vinegar to make the buttermilk substitute)  and used real coffee cream with some water added to make up the remaining.  Other than that I was able to follow the recipe exactly.  Baked in the 13x9" PYREX dish as recommended.  As other people noted it did take almost 1hour and 30mins to bake.  After the first hour I checked it every 10 mins.  Everyone in the family loved this cake! It's a winner.  Thank you for sharing it!

Followed the recipe as given.  Preheated and set oven temperature to 275.  Cooked for 1 hour, on center rack. Cake was no where near done when stuck in center.  Up temperature to 325 cooked and watched and additional 15 minutes or so and stuck again at which time got a clean stick. Placed in freezer as per recipe (which is new to me). Prepared 1/2 of icing recipe. Icing a very satisfyingly moist bananas cake.  Thumbs up for my first bananas cake. Thanks for sharing.

Very moist, very delicious cake!  Do as directed...you  won't be disappointed. I'm gluten free, so I used King Arthur gluten free flour...oh my!!! Delicious!  Made them into cupcakes as another reviewer suggested, & baked 300 degrees for 35 minutes. Then put into the freezer immediately for 30 minutes. Used half amount  of frosting, that was plenty. Guests loved.  Definite keeper.

Delicious cake!  Followed the recipe exactly, but had to bake it for an hour and a half.  Added black walnuts to top of icing which enhanced the flavors.  This makes a big cake so the 2nd time we made it, divided into two smaller square glass pans and froze one.  A KEEPER!

This cake is absolutely delicious. I used three whole banana's which came to about 2 cups, 1 1/2cups of half and half mixed with 1 tbs of lemon juice because i did not have buttermilk on hand, added mini chocolate chips and I baked in two 9inch rounds because my freezer is tiny. Husband loved it!!!l

This is legitimately the most moist cake I've ever made. I had to cook it for about 10-15 mins more because the center was not quite cooked through, and I also added an extra mashed banana because I really wanted the flavor. But the freezer trick is totally weird, but TOTALLY worth it!

This is delicious! Like others, I was skeptical of the baking temp and transfer to freezer but the cake does stay really moist and so I have continued to follow the directions exactly. We ate this up and made it again two days later. So good!

Wonderful cake!  Fantastic flavor and texture. The only tweak I made was adding nuts to the cake and frosting. I did follow directions on baking temperature and had to add an additional 20 minutes. I think next time I'll either bake at 325* or try 300* convection temp (that's the lowest my convection oven will go).   My husband polished this cake  off in record time - even eating it for breakfast. This one is a keeper. (I'm thinking about trying it with blueberries instead sometime, too!)

This was a good banana bread (I like it more than the top rated banana bread recipe here) but as a cake it was nothing spectacular. Very heavy. I was 1/4 short on bananas so I had to sub some applesauce, and I baked on 300 instead of 275, as one reviewer mentioned that non-convection ovens need increased temps. Other than those (I think small) alterations, I followed the recipe.               The frosting is on point though. I'll use that one again.

This cake is fantastic. It's so light and fluffy. The only thing I did differently, was add 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the batter and 1/2 tsp. to the icing in addition to what the recipe called for.
SUGGESTION: Use ripe bananas. It's going to take about 5 to get to 1 1/2 cups.
Next time I'm going to substitute Splenda and see how it comes out.
I think I'm going to have a piece for breakfast tomorrow. YUM!!!

I followed the baking directions (except that I divided it into 3 -8" cake pans) and it came out great!  It's just the 2 of us so we would never be able to eat that much cake.  I left 2 of the cakes in the freezer for a later time.  This is so good, it is now at the top of my baking list.

I made this cake today for a barbecue and everyone was raving about how good it was all night .  I also got requests to make it again, I definitely will!
I followed the directions exactly, the only change was that I had to bake it for about 20 minutes longer than specified (1 hour per recipe). 
I dont often make cakes from scratch but this was a fun and easy recipe to do with my 4 year old.

Aside for not actually measuring how much banana I used (I just mashed the 3 remaining bananas I had on hand), I followed this recipe exactly.  There is something magical about the ingredients and the cooking and cooling methods that make this cake so delicious!  My banana-in-desserts despising husband thought it was fabulous and my daughter devoured it.  My advice: try this recipe and don't change a thing!

Fantastic banana cake. Super fluffy with ease. 
I am so impressed!!!
For serving of 12, I reduced the sugar (I used brown sugar)by 25g, next time I'll reduce it by 50g, considering the fact that I used overripe bananas. I added 2 teaspoons of browning as well for coloring. Had to wait an extra 30min for it to get done. I think it had to do with the height of the loaf foil pan used, because the mini leftover sample got done in 1hr.
Slides down the throat with great ease too. Yum!

Using SINGA's recommendation, I baked cake two ways one following recipe and second time around,left out bananas,lemon juice, crime cheese and baking soda. In the second cake used baking powder and cardamom and it was amazing.This cake once cooled disappears in minutes.

Followed the instructions to a tee. Cooked it in two round stones, though, so I knew I needed to add a little extra cooking time. Cooked it for 70min. It seemed done... toothpick cake out clean. Then I put it in the freezer as instructed, and when I pulled it out, it had flattened in the middle. And it won't release from the pan. It's gooey and appears it's not done after all. Really bummed, as this was meant to be my son's 5th birthday cake tomorrow. Now I have to start over and I don't have enough ingredients. Off to the store I go. Very sad this didn't pan out. And frustrated. What did I do wrong? ;(

Such a delicious cake! I'm so glad I chose this as the first cake I've baked from scratch. Using the recipe results in an amazing, tasty, moist, sweet cake that I was proud to serve to others. Will bake again.

This cake is amazing; it rose like crazy and stayed moist even uncovered for 2 days (that was all it took for 3 of us to finish eating it!).  I did make a few adjustments.  Instead of all the sugar, I used 1/2 c dark brown sugar and 1/2 cup Truvia, and 4 bananas.  Also grated in some fresh nutmeg; used closer to a tablespoon each of baking soda (explains the mega rise?) & vanilla.  Just wondering if this baking technique works on other cakes too.

Yummy cake and worth the effort.  I used the glass Pyrex pan like in the video and follow all directions exactly.  I did increase the bake time by 25 minutes.  Remember to check with a toothpick at one hour bake time as all ovens bake differently.

I was looking for a banana cake recipe and chose this one because the directions were just so weird, I was curious to see how it would turn out. I followed the recipe exactly, although at 275 degrees (whyyyyyy?) It took 2 1/2 hours for my cake to bake .  After 45 minutes in the freezer (whyyyyyyy?) and frosted, I must say this cake is ridiculously good. The taste, texture, density were all A+. If anything, I would say this cake doesn't even need the frosting. Thanks for sharing this weird, awesome recipe.

I have to say this is the best banana cake I have ever tried. It is thick and moist and has a wonderful banana flavor. I used 4 very ripe bananas and this measured a little more than the 1-1/2 cups that the recipe called for. "Fanatastic" is the best word to describe this cake. I will definitely make this again...and again! It's sure to be one of my family's favorite recipes.

Best ever Banana Cake.  It speaks for itself.  This cake raised up to the top of the 9x13 pan.  My husband was in heaven and after I tried it, I was in heaven also.  This is the best of the best.

This cake is really moist and delicious. I followed the recipe as written but for some reason it reeeeally didn't cook through for me after one hour. I probably baked it for an extra 30 minutes in small increments and ended up raising the temperature to 300 F until it wasn't gooey in the centre.

One of the best cakes I have tasted.  Made the recipe just as directed and baked it at 275 for 1 hour.  Put in freezer, then frosted.  Perfect.  For those that had issues with the temperature and/or baking time, I suggest getting a oven thermometer. I had no issues with time or temp.

I love this cake.  The only problem I found with it is:  the first time I made it, it seemed to take longer than instructed to bake because the center was slightly raw; the second time I made it I left it longer but the outside seemed too over done and the flavor was not as good as the first time.  So, the third time, I split the batter into two square 8 X 8 pans and I think that's the trick.  The 13" pan is two big.  It is delicious; highly recommend it.

I absolutely loved this cake!! I read a few reviews that condemned the cooking time and temp. I will add that I was concerned, but I will also add that it says to, "Bake for 1 hour, OR UNTIL TOOTHPICK INSERTED COMES OUT CLEAN." I typed in all caps to emphasize that means you might have to cook it longer. 

Best banana cake I've ever eaten!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe :)

My cake didn't seem to rise as much as I expected, but it could be because I made a half recipe and baked it in a 9x9 pan, so perhaps the batter was just more spread out. Other than that this cake has great flavour (though I cut back on the sugar a bit) and was super moist! Will make again :)

This is so good. I have made it at least twenty times over the last few years. Everyone loves it.  We usually eat it without the frosting, but that's just my family's preference. Sometimes I top it with whipped cream. Truth is I don't like making frosting :)  I do really love this recipe.

Delicious! I followed this recipe almost exactly. Only changes I made was I used 2 bananas, 2 eggs, 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I did not make in 9x13 instead i used two loaf pans.  1 froze 1 loaf and it was crunchy on outside and tender on the inside. Icing adds a nice smooth texture but is NOT necessary. The cake tastes fine all by itself. Definitely worth making when you have old bananas around.  Thanks for sharing.

I have now made this recipe multiple times and my family LOVES it! I do follow the directions in regard to the ingredients and temperature however I have consistently found that it takes 1.5 hour to cook. I have a gas oven so this may impact on the cooking time.

This cake came out superbly, even though-my mistake-I accidentally added the sugar to the flour mixture instead of creaming it with the butter. Otherwise, I made the cake exactly per the recipe, including the freezer part. The frosting is light and delicious. I used all of the frosting on the cake, which produced a good 1-inch luscious layer on top of a super moist cake.

This cake was delicious! It did take 2hrs to cook, not 1hr, and I didn't put it immediately into the freezer because I was worried about my glass pan cracking or the pan melting other items in my freezer. So I waited probably 15-20mins before putting it in the freezer. I added Walnuts on top of the frosting and used regular 2% milk instead of buttermilk. Everyone loved this cake. Would definitely make it again. Yum.

A very moist, tasty cake! I really wanted to do the whole low temperature thing, but right when I was about to put the cake in the oven got a phone call that had to be somewhere in less than an hour and a half. I bumped the temperature to 350 degrees and baked in a 12 cup bundt pan for 35 minutes , then put it in the freezer for another 30 mins, took it out an covered in plastic wrap before leaving the house. 

When we returned we found a very tasty, super moist banana bundt cake that's to die for!

To be fair with the original poster I will try the low temp part when I have the time, but they way I did it worked out wonderfully.

Can't comment on the frosting because I didn't make it, but will probably throw flour covered nuts in the future, and trust, there will be many future occasions to eat this gem!

Absolutely amazing cake!! I loved it!! Oven time for my oven was about 1 hour and 20 minutes.. I just kept checking it every 5 minutes after the hour had passed... truly something that came out of a high end bakery!! Definitely a lot of work but really worth it!! This makes a lot of frosting I only used about 3/4 of it and it was really spread on thick.. three the rest of the frosting out although I supposed I could've kept it for something else.. next time will decrease amounts for frosting though. Can't wait till hubby comes home from work to try it! I had my piece with a yummy latte!! Ummmm perfection!

First time baking anything, I miss one egg only used 2.  But it still came out perfectly.  However the cook time was 1 hour 45 mins at 275.  I did the freezer thing too and after a LONG 40 ish minutes in the freezer it came out perfectly warm.  I sued the store bought cake cream cheese instead of making it.  It was melt in your mouth perfect, not too sweet at all.   My wife was in shock and told me I can be a stay at home hubby now.   :)   I love this country...

This cake is so moist, I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups for the cake, other than the sugar I followed the recipe as it was written,  with the frosting  it was plenty sweet and so delicious.  I used homemade cream cheese for the frosting, so good.  This recipe goes into my" favorite, go to recipe" file.

This was a great cake. Really moist !! Don't make this unless you have a  bunch of people to eat it because you'll end up eating it all  yourself! I've mad this a few times and I needed adjust the cooking time to bake a while longer but it was definitely  worth the wait :-)

Did not make frosing-just a banana bread. Added cinnamon, nutmeg and walnuts. Had 4 big bananas - used them all. Followed temperature instructions - low temps & freezer. I baked it in bundt cake form and it took about 1,5 hour. Result-just outstanding!!!! Soft, moist and sweet, but not too sweet... And it was my first banana bread. Thanks for sharing  this  recipe.

This cake is delicious!  It did take longer than 1 hour to bake. It took about 1.5 hours for the cake to set up in the middle.  I didn't measure my bananas. I just used the 3 overripe ones that I had so that could be why.  I also used about 1/2 t. banana flavoring in the cake batter and the icing. My family loved this cake!

One of the *best* cakes I have ever eaten! I followed the recipe exactly as written. The only change was I had to bake my cake quite a bit longer than the recipe called for; however, given that ovens are different, it was no big deal. My family absolutely loved it & devoured it, begging for more! I will *definitely* make this one again!!

This is the most amazing banana cake i have ever had.  I messed up the icing because i made homemade powder sugar because i had none,  so the icing was a little gritty, but WOW.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  It is definately a keeper ?.  Highly recommend to everyone.

This was DELICIOUS!! Followed the instructions exactly and it turned out moist & melt in your mouth good. I made it for my sons birthday (he is obsessed with Minions) and people were scraping the cake stand to get every crumb. Seriously.

Excellent, moist, filling banana cake! I used a 9 by 13 baking stoneware in a convection oven,  and it took 1 hour 25 min.  that would be the only thing not exact to the recipe.  I will say though I put it straight in the freezer after and this cake was incredibly moist!

Followed the recipe to the letter,  but did add walnuts, and it was absolutely wonderful.  Moist and tasty.  The next  time I'll add some banana extract just to give a little boost to the banana taste.

I followed the recommended cooking temp and times and put right in the freezer and it came out perfect. Super moist. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it. I definitely had icing left over, but better than not enough.

Great recipe! I used heavy cream in place of buttermilk (it's all I had in the house) and I made 24 cupcakes rather than a cake. So flavorful and moist! Yum

The recipe was great but it definitely was NOT done in the time listed in the recipe. Like other reviews it should have been baked at 375° instead of 275° for  1 hr.

I have made this cake twice and it gets many compliments. My husband has a lactose allergy so I made butter milk from lactose free milk and lemon juice and I use veggie cream cheese to make the frosting otherwise I followed directions exactly and it is a wonderful cake!

I made this cake last night. It was delicious. I didn't have buttermilk so I added  two tsp of lemon juice.  I used one cup of cake flour and two cups of all purpose flour. I baked my cake for one hour on 300 (instead of the 270) and I didn't put it in the freezer. It still came out moist and was delicious.

The cake itself was ok but the frosting turned out incredibly sweet so that I had to take it off completely even though I put twice as less confectioners sugar as in the recipe.

This was excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1% milk with 1 T lemon juice and 1/2 T vinegar and let it sit for 10 minutes).  I made cupcakes because it is much easier to freeze them rather than be tempted to eat the whole cake.  I cooked them at 275 degrees for 40 minutes and put them outside, in freezing temperatures, for 20 minutes.  I chose not to put icing to save additional calories.   I am sure that would have been good or the homemade caramel frosting that another reviewer suggested.  One thing I would add, next time, would be chopped walnuts.  Excellent recipe!!!

By far, the best cake I have ever  baked. One change I do for all my cream cheese icings; only 1 cup of powdered sugar. I also added semi crushed walnuts on top. The unconventional low temperature added 20 minutes to the suggested baking time. I'm also glad I had room in my freezer.

Made this 2x. Once as directed, once using 3 round cake pans and reducing the bake time. Like others  commented, the recipe as written requires far more bake time than an hour. The time I made it with 3 round cake pans I increased the temp by 25 degrees and baked for about 50 minutes. Made a standard cream cheese frosting both times. Turned out super fantastic both times. So moist and light. Going to try the "slow, low bake, freezer" method with other cakes and see if it works!

Awesome Banana Cake recipe. It took longer than one hour to cook but the cake was very moist. I shared with my coworkers and plan to bake another cake for my mother.

Yummy banana cake!  Just a couple of changes, First, I used 1/2 cup of butter for the batter and 1/4 cup of coconut oil.  This adds to the moisture and gives the cake a nice rich flavor.  Second, I turned the heat of the oven up to 350 deg.  I started off at 275 deg thinking, hmm... that's unusual, I wonder if it really will be just one hour... well, after an hour and 15 minutes, my cake was still batter.  So, no, it didn't work.  I turned it up to 350 deg and it finished baking in about 40 minutes.  Other than those changes, the flavor was really yummy and the cake is moist!  (oh, and I did not put this in the freezer after I took it out of the oven because I don't have room but didn't have to with the addition of coconut oil).

I have made several banana cakes over the years and this was the best one ever. I changed 2 things, added a little banana extract to mix and a banana to the cream cheese frosting with more powdered sugar to compensate. I always wrap and freeze my cakes straight from oven and I'm happy to see such great results with this one. This first recipe where it's been an instruction and itI've been given orders at work to bake one a week by someone who doesn't like cake so I know this was awesome.

Perfect as written. Did not change a thing. It took a little longer to bake in my oven, about an hour and 20 minutes. It turned out great - very moist and delicious. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Raised temp to 350° after an hour and then turned down again, fell in the middle, but it was moist and delicious. I did not put it in the freezer.

This cake is moist and delicious and the frosting complements it perfectly. My picky toddles LOVES it! I did cut the sugar roughly in half and felt that it was plenty sweet. In fact, the crazy amount of sugar is the only reason this recipe didn't get 5 stars from me. I will definitely make this cake often.

I don't even like banana cake. Or rather, I didn't. Until I tried this one. It's sweet, moist and absolutely delicious! For dietary reasons, I needed them dairy-free so I used oil instead of butter and almond milk instead of buttermilk. They still came out amazing!
Makes about 30 cupcakes.

This recipe is a bomb. It was so good and soft and moist and I could go on and on.....? I suggest people to try this. I used curd mixed with little milk instead of the buttermilk. This recipe was a total hit.

I made it just as listed. Had to leave in a lot longer than an hour. It did resemble banana bread, although a lot lighter. Would make again. Fantastic.

Great recipe! I cut down sugar to 2 cups since the bananas were very sweet but yeah you could use 2 n 1/8 cup sugar and it would taste perfect! I also added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder to get a nice brown color.  Perfect recipe!!

The banana cake part was delicious and very moist.  That part is five stars.  But THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN THE ICING IS INSANE.  3 1/2 !  I followed the recipe exactly and me and my mom both felt like puking afterwards.  Way too much sugar in the icing.  I would make again but with less sugar or with no icing at all.

Heavenly.  Tasted just like my Great Grandmothers!  Huge hit at family function!  PS the temperature thing though didn't work out as written.  This cake took forever to cook and I ended up bumping it up to 350 after 30 minutes.

Awesome cake! My cake came out super fluffy I ended up cooking it a little bit longer. After reading some of the reviews I was concerned about putting hot dishes in my freezer so I put it outside since I live in Alaska & the temp is now dropping under freezing (still not as cold as a domestic freezer). I had it outside for ~40minutes it was still pretty warm when I brought it inside but delicious  and moist nevertheless! That icing was the cherry on top! Thanks for this recipe!

I ended up baking it for 1 hour and 35 minutes before the toothpick came out clean.  I should have baked it longer though because the bottom 1/4" of the whole cake was gummy and not cooked.  Had to cut off that portion of the cake when serving.
Flavors were good, cream cheese icing was good (although I did add some sour cream to it to cut down on the sweetness).. 

Don't know if I would make it again.

I made this banana cake for 100 people at my Elks Lodge. I 1 1/2 the recipe 3x  and baked in three large pans. I was a little leary about the oven temp so I went with 300 degrees. Put the cakes in the freezer as per recipe, also a little leary here... but I must say this cake was delicious and moist. Got loads of compliments and will use this recipe again and again.

Oh my goodness. This is so good. I made it for a small family meal. Every one of them loved it. My grandchildren, ages 5, 4 and 1 couldn't eat it fast enough. 
I recommend you follow the directions exactly and written. It is a dense moist cake and tastes even better the following day.

Awesome!!!  Best banana cake I've ever made. Delicious and moist even without the frosting!  I followed the recipe, and had so much batter that it overflowed my 9X13 pan while baking, just a little bit.  It looked like a lot of batter before I put it into the pan, so next time I'll trust my instincts. It took 1 hour and 20 minutes before a toothpick came out clean, but I was patient.

This is excellent. 

I did use cake flour, and added a bit more vanilla than called for.  It took about 15 minutes more in the oven (in my metal air bake pan) than it called for. Watch it closely at the end, it can go from gooey to done very quickly.

I added more vanilla and some coconut rum to the frosting, and sprinkled some crushed walnuts on it. 

This makes a lot of cake. I will probably have to freeze this in individual pieces so that we can have it when we like.

This is a great alterative to Banana Bread but I must caution you if you make this to rethink the 2 cups of SUGAR especially if your using over ripe Bananas which already have a high sugar content,  that along with the Icing which has 3.5 cups of Powered Sugar and this will be way way to sweet.

I was intrigued by this recipe and it's unusual method so I gave it a go, and I made a caramel frosting to go with it. I make banana bread often (I have for years upon years) and this was a nice alternative. I think I would serve this as a coffee cake instead of an actual dessert with frosting. I gave this three stars because while I had a piece and thought it was good, no one else around here touched it.

Loved the cake.  I'm glad a read other reviews because I also found that it took much longer to bake in my oven.  It took approximately an hour and 25 minutes.

So many people are saying the cooking time is sufficient, unfortunately, I'm cooking it right now and it's been an hour and 15 minutes and the centre is still almost liquid. 

This makes sense to me, but I really wanted to believe the OP. Ah well, onward and upward.

So delicious.  My daughter asked for banana cake for her 5th bday so I made this for her.  Was the first scratch cake I've ever made and it turned out great.  Followed recipe and directions to a tee except needed to cook 15 mins longer - at one hour it was still battery but that 15 mins made it perfect.  Did the freezer part.  Made the frosting (was so sweet it hurt my teeth so added a tidge of lemon juice to cut the sweetness).  Unfortunately I'm doing Weight Watchers so this isn't exactly ideal - for anyone else on WW who wants to know the Smartpoints, it is 12/serving if you have 30 servings (which is totally doable and normal size pieces).

Since I did not have any buttermilk on hand I added 1-1/2 tbsp of vinegar to regular milk.  I increased the temperature to 300 degrees after it baked one hour and baked it an additional 15-20 minutes doing the toothpick test every 5-10 minutes.
No need to change anything else.  I did not frost as my husband thought it tasted great without.  It is a very sweet cake so I felt frosting might make it overwhelming.

I've made this cake a few times now.  Serves a large group, keeps very well and is so flavourful. What I really like is that it is moist and heavy, like the white cakes my mom made.

My husband declared this the best banana cake ever. Made the cake without any changes to recipe. On the frosting I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar and sifted it to remove lumps. Delicious cake!

Great recipe, didn't have buttermilk in the house so used part half and half and part milk with some lemon juice. Excellent flavor and very moist, great recipe will definitely make again. Otherwise only change was added chopped walnuts because we love walnuts with banana.

Excellent cake! I made this for a birthday party on Sunday and it is requested again for the next party next weekend. I used plain milk with lemon juice for a mock buttermilk and it was just fine. My husband said this was the best cake he had ever eaten...it's that good!

Turned out amazing! I had never had a banana cake before, this is now a family (lol and coworker) favorite! The first time I made it I didn't have and confectioners sugar, so I used another new-to-me recipe--brown sugar cream cheese frosting. I added a sploosh of uncalled for caramel extract to the frosting, sooooo good!

This is by far the best banana cake I have ever made. Everyone loved it! I forgot to buy buttermilk so I made my own: 1 1/2 C skim milk with 1 T + 2 t lemon juice, let it set 10 minutes to curdle. Simply delicious!

Banana cake couldn't be much better than this. i enjoyed the cooling method in the freezer as it makes it easy to frost and have ready in a short length of time. However, it took almost 90 minutes to cook and the recommended pan overflowed in the oven. I suggest being sure that your pan has at least three inch sides or put some of the batter in a cupcake pan to prevent a mess in the oven.
The only change I made was to add one Tsp. ground cinnamon to the icing which gives a special flavour to the usuual cream cheese icing.

Had to add 25 minutes more to cooking time.  Actually liked the sweetness of this cake.  Added walnuts on top of frosted cake because my daughter doesn't care for nuts in her cake.  You could add them to the batter.  Great recipe.

This is wonderful.  I did raise the oven temp to 300 and it still took an hour and a half to get done. I will try it again and do the 'normal' 350 degrees and see what happens. I put it in the freezer like it says. Not sure if that has an effect or not but thought I should try to stick somewhat close to the recipe.

I have made this cake 3 times now.  First time did it pretty much by instructions.  2nd time baked it at 350 degrees and did NOT put in freezer. I did have to turn it down for the last 1/2 hour but it did take an hour to bake.  Couldn't see that  the freezer part had much to do with the final outcome.   This time I am baking at 325 to see what happens.    It was/is a very very good cake but leave it in the oven until the center is set.

This is winner, I made it twice already and people are actually willing to pay me to make this cake. I followed the recipe I just added walnuts to the batter, came out tasting just as great.  Mind you I never made a cake before besides box so I am very pleased with the results.

I joined Allrecipes.com just to post a review of this recipe/cake - it's absolutely delicious. A very moist cake with tons of flavor. I followed the recipe almost exact, the baking temp @ 275 seems low but trust me...do it! The freezer part, I have no idea what it does either, but do it! I used a little less powdered sugar, about 2.5 cups for my icing, and I didn't have buttermilk so I used skim milk + 1.5 tbsp of white vinegar...you'd never know it. Turned out to be one of the best cakes I've made yet. Took it to work and everyone raved about it.... I'll be making this often!

The cake needed to bake longer than 1 hour.  Baked the cake an additional 20 minutes and the center sank.

I made this exactly as written and it was excellent!  Sprinkling chopped walnuts on top of the frosting really makes it special.  The cake's texture is just perfect!  Make this one, you won't regret it!

The ratings for this cake are definitely worth it! I made it and it took alot of success even though i was a bit worried of the combination of buttermilk & banana and the low oven temperature. The cake actually took me 2 hours to get baked rather than one, but in the end, it was better than expected. The only changed in this recipe is i changed the frosting. I did a bitterly chocolate once just to balance the sweetness of the cake and topped it with chopped walnuts. For the frosting, i added half the amount of sugar listed in this recipe, quarter spoon of coffee, and a combination of melted dark chocolate and cocoa powder.

I made this cake recently for my family and everyone LOVED it! It was by far, the best banana cake I have ever made. I am making it again tonight for another dinner and then baking it for a retirement party next week for a co-worker. I want to share this delicious cake with as many people I can. Trust me when I say, it will make you look like a champion baker.

So good! Moist cake with great cream cheese frosting. Tried with a chocolate cream cheese frosting and was not a fan. Might try adding chocolate chips next time.

Thought the freezing after baking was weird, but I did it. At 275, it wasn't nearly done in 1 hour. The recipe is very similar to my banana bread, so I bumped up the temp to 300 and baked another 25 minutes...almost too long. The cake is very moist (from freezing apparently) and dense. I added mini chocolate chips also. Everyone really liked it. I would most likely make it again.

I followed this recipe exactly (with the exception of the baking pan) and absolutely loved it! Made this for my mom's birthday and she is obsessed. Made sure to use really ripe bananas (plenty of brown spots on the peel). I was able to divide the batter into three 9-inch rounds, and there was just a little extra left over. Ended up keeping them in the oven for about 1 hr 15 mins. Made a 3-layer round cake with frosting between each layer. Super moist and banana-y cake! Only critique is that the frosting was a little bit too sweet for my taste (I could distinctly taste the confectioner's sugar, which was a bit overpowering), so I would consider using more cream cheese and less sugar the next time around. I prefer denser cream cheese frostings. All around amazing cake!! Will definitely make again.

Super moist, excellent cake. I made half the recipe in a 7x11 pirex. Baked at 280 for 50min and placed it in the freezer for 30min as recipe says. For half recipe I used 2 mashed bananas and 1 egg. It is very moist, sweet and great banana flavor. I didn't make the frosting but I'm sure it will be delicious with cream cheese frosting.

well.... I must say this is the first time ever I made a banana cake. wow. I was surprised with the results. the technique of putting the hot cake right in to the freezer to get moist in the cake actually worked. I could not believe it. the cake was lovely, super moist and tasty. my family loved it. but it took 1 hour and 20 mints for the cake to get baked. thank you so much for the recipe.

I made a couple of changes, only because my friend wanted a sour cream chocolate/coffee frosting (her birthday cake) & I thought espresso would be better than lemon for it, so subbed espresso for the lemon juice.  I also used part spelt flour to make it a little healthier (you could not taste that it was spelt).  I also added walnuts to the batter.  It did take about 90 minutes to bake in my oven (I used a 9" spring form pan, which would take longer than the other options anyway).  Got rave reviews & my friend said it was even better than the one her Grandmother used to make her & her husband said it was the best  cake ever!  It really was so moist & had excellent flavor! Highly recommend!

I have made this cake twice in the past week for work. I have had so many compliments, but the best are from the men that say it's the best banana cake they ever had. The cake is very moist, and the icing is not to sweet.  This will always be my go to banana cake.

This was delicious.  I bought it into work and it was gone.  I made it exactly to the recipe, but it took a lot longer to cook than an hour.  I had to bake it for 2 hours before the the center was done ( I used a 9x13 pan, as directed).  After the time in the freezer, I frosted it and put it in the fridge till the next day.  It was super moist.  I like cream cheese frosting, but would like to try some of the suggestions others made here, just to see how it tastes.

Made this as a 3 layer cake with a cream cheese buttercream frosting. I cut the sweet of the frosting by adding in flour... and I used maple extract instead of vanilla in the frosting as well. Make sure you do the oven to freezer as it says, the result is a super moist cake!

I hate to be one of those people who say they didn't make it as instructed. BUT, I didn't make it as instructed.  I live in Haiti, and there is no way to freeze a hot cake in my teeny tiny freezer. So, I went for it and mixed up the cake, and baked it at a higher temp and added an extra banana. And it was delicious.  I have done this more than once and it always turns out great. AND the university students who come to my house almost daily are delighted when I have it. One student just told me "I LOVE this."  So, I thought I should finally come and give praise where praise is due.  A great cake, as I made it.  :)  And thank you for sharing it with us.

Made 2 cakes to test the theory of putting a cake directly in the freezer as directed. Turns out, (I was right!) the cake which was put in the freezer fell immediately, ruining the shape entirely for presentation. Other than that crazy direction that didn't work at all, the cake itself was very pleasant. The frosting was very good as well however I added about half cup of plain yogurt to the mix which toned down the extreme sweetness.

I loved this cake. It is truly a five star recipe and I don't often find that that is the case. I didn't put it in the freezer when it came out of the oven as suggested, but I don't see how it could have been any better if I had! I cooked it 15 minutes longer than suggested, but otherwise followed the instructions exactly.

I had to try this recipe because the low temperature, and the freezing is so unconventional.
It was good, but quite a heavy cake .
I don't think i'll make it again.

I made this cake with chocolate chips and baked at 350 until done. Then I poked holes with a wooden spoon and added caramelized sweet condensed milk. So rich, so moist and it got rave reviews.

This was a good cake recipe, although I had to increase the cooking time to 2 hours for the cake tester to come out clean. I also reduced the sugar in the frosting by about a cup and it was still plenty sweet. Although we enjoyed this cake, I don't think I would make it again based on the long cooking time.

Everything it's billed to be -- moist and delicious.  The cake comes together very quickly and is an easy cake to make.  I wanted to make something with my overripe bananas that wasn't banana bread or banana pudding.  This was perfect.  It took quite a bit more than one hour to bake (about 1 hour and 20 minutes).  Otherwise, was perfect.  As another reviewer warned -- it goes from wet and jiggly in the center to done very quickly, so keep an eye on it!

This cake has a delicate banana flavor and tastes like a sweet banana bread. It was good however I felt that it was a bit too sweet and the butter flavor is very forward. The frosting also has very delicate flavor but is much more butter flavor than cream cheese flavor.

I made this cake about a year ago.  It was my first banana cake.  I have been hooked on it since.  It is the best I've ever had.  I am making one right now as I write this.  The only addition thing that I add is chopped walnuts in the mixture and not on the icing.  It should be called "Heavenly Banana Cake".  I have to add a little extra cooking time.  For all those people that  thought their cake was too sweet, they must have used unsalted butter.  I did on one of the cake's that I made and the frosting was too sweet.  The next cake I used salted butter, boy it was perfect.

this is such a delicious cake. Only one thing I would recommend. You should try putting a teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg in the cream cheese frosting. It tastes great.

The temperature is correct! It baked for 70 minutes total and then into the freezer. Outside of making my own buttermilk and the little extra time baking, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out perfectly and was a hit for a family get together! Would be great as a layer cake too! Will absolutely be making again!

I followed this recipe ALMOST exactly.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I made sour milk out of milk and vinegar.  Also, I had a tablespoon or two of leftover mashed bananas after measuring out my mashed up bananas so I threw that in as well.

Absolutely excellent cake!  Tastes even better the next day.  It's just my hubby and I so I gave half to my neighbors and they just asked for more, lol!

If I was going to do anything to change it (and it's wonderful as is) I would add some spices to it such as cinnamon, cloves, etc.  But it wouldn't taste like a 'banana' cake then either.

Hands down the best cake ever! I do have to bake it 15 minutes longer then the recipe calls for or else it's still raw in the middle. I've made this cake 4 times and every crumb gets eaten. Tastes even better the next day!

Followed the directions exactly and cake was completely raw in the middle.  Should have baked it for another 20 minutes or more.  And my stove works perfectly.  Was able to salvage the perimeter of the cake.  Frosty was too sweet.  Cake was tasty  and will probably make again with alterations I mentioned.

I will definitely be making this again, it's going in my recipe book. I only made half the frosting (as is my preference) and I followed other reviewers and baked this at 325 for 45 minutes. It was very strange for me to put a hot cake straight into the freezer but it turned out fantastic. Super moist and flavorful. I baked it in two 9" round pans and stacked it. If I make it again I think I will follow the recipe exactly and bake at a lower temp.

This is the best banana cake in the world.  I gave it a 5 star rating.  the only thing I did different is I had to bake this for 1hr and 15 minutes at 275.   I put it in the freezer for an hour took it out frosted it.  No more banana bread for me .  This cake spoiled me, can"t wait for the family to try this

I made  a double batch (which just about did my mixer in--it was full to the top and heavy) so that I could make cupcakes and a cake. The cupcakes didn't last long enough to frost, and I put the cake, still in a spring-form pan, in the freezer, where it stayed, only wrapped in a towel, for months. I just pulled it out and it is super moist and delicious, even without the frosting.
  If I did it again I'd only do single batches, but still the best banana cake ever!

CAKE::  delicious and moist. 
FROSTING:  I didn't measure the butter because I only had blue bonnet spread and so I put a big spoonful in and had to add extra powdered sugar to get the right consistency, but the frosting was delicious, too.

Great directions too.

I've made this cake twice, both times for company.  It was delicious!  I was a little unsure of baking it at 275*, but it baked perfectly. I cooled it in the freezer, and that is one of the keys to making it so moist. I added pecans to the first one, and chocolate chips to the second one, and both were great additions. Also, I substituted fat free vanilla yogurt to the cake instead of the buttermilk and it baked up fine. (I'd never use up the leftover buttermilk, so just opted to make the switch to yogurt instead.)

Made this cake exactly as written with the exception of adding some chopped pecans on the top after frosting.  It is DELICIOUS!  I also found, like many other reviewers that one hour of cooking time is nowhere near long enough.  I baked mine at 275 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes until the toothpick came out clean.  Will be a regular in my rotation!

I have 8 children  and everyone loved it. I was a little skeptical but only bcecause we cook gluten free due to celiac disease and its pretty much convert to gluten free at your own risk with everything. This turned out soo yummy even with gluten free flour. Ive been cooking gf for years now and can adjust pretty much anything but didnt have to at all with this recipe except for cooking time. It took about 20 min longer than stated , other that it was great. Also made these into a quick breakfast muffin by upping oven temp to 325 and lessening cooking time. We also added choc chips so no frosting is needed.

Making it right now! I know this is going to be delicious. BUT I am already running behind on schedule, it's Easter Sunday and I wanted a fresh cake for Mom's house after visiting the in laws, church etc. The cake has been in the oven for an hour at 275 and it's still runny. I am not a happy camper right now. There's no way an hour is long enough.

Update 2017. So I made it again this year and indeed, it took 1.5 hrs. In the oven. Luckily I made it yesterday.

Delicious.  I made it according to the recipe.  I have to admit I was skeptical of the cooking temperature and duration but after reading the other comments I decided to do the same.  I actually had to cook mine about 15 minutes longer but I think that's because my oven is old!  The cake was nicely moist and thoroughly enjoyed by all.  This one goes in my favorites list.

This recipe is amazing! I have made this cake many times now and it is always a huge hit! It tends to overflow a little in a 9x13 pan so I usually make a three layer round cake and there is still enough icing to cover the cake and spread some between the layers.

Added 1 tsp banana flavoring to frosting which was too thick but delicious!  Added a little water for spreading ease.  Cake was very moist but coarse.  More like bread but good.

I always cut this recipe in half as I always make it in a 13x9x2 and it makes just the perfect amount otherwise you end up with a huge piece of cake about 4inches high so for me the cake to frosting ratio isn't well proportioned  ... I like this recipe and make some adjustments but is still good as written.

I use a peanut butter frosting in the middle, and a chocolate ganache on top. We call it the Elvis cake!

I couldn't bring myself to trust the cooking instructions (low heat/freezer) until the third time I made this. It's totally worth it! You get a much moister cake if you follow the recipe as it was intended.

Too heavy and too sweet. I baked the cake at 275 degrees and after 1 hour and 20 minutes I changed the temperature to 350 degrees. It took another 30 minutes and the cake was finally done. The frosting was good but way to sweet. Definitely not a keeper, there are better cake recipes.

All of my family members told me to put this in the "make-again" folder! We all loved it! The only difference that I did was to bake it for 75 minutes instead of 60. At 60 minutes the cake was still wet/raw in the center. At 75 it was perfect. Absolutely the best, moistest cake! Love it!

Nothing to rave about my personal opinion and rating. . Was pretty decent. Family quite enjoyed it. Was moist and they say surprisingly light for a banana cake. And with the topping of their choice combined with the cake they all said was nice and not overly sweet at all nor dry. Things I changed: 5 small green/yellow bananas instead of 3 medium ripe bananas, extra 20 mins in oven, left to stand as freezer was full, regular full cream milk instead of buttermilk, no cream cheese so my family decided up and tried it with icecream, custard and some orley whip.

Delicious and a total crowd pleaser! I made a few alterations based on other reviews. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I baked it at 325 degrees for about 45 minutes and put it right into the freezer for a couple hours. I used store-bought whipped cream cheese icing (due to lack of time) and sprinkled chopped pecans on top. It was even better day 2 after baking!

Amazingly moist! And very delicious! Only that mine came out a little pale with 1 hour of cooktime; I would have preferred a little more golden. But other than that, this is a perfect recipe!

Everything about it was excellent except my own inexperience.  No room in the freezer so it sat on a snowbank instead which worked just fine.

Wowsa!  After reading reviews, I decided to make cupcakes. I bake them on 300 degrees and baked them for 32 minutes. Which I did put in the freezer as directions said. The batter made 24 cupcakes and I was able to make a 8 inch round cake too(which I didn't put in the freezer) .I am not so sure the freezer part really made a big difference though. As far as the frosting I cut the sugar down to about 2 1/2 cups and added a tad more vanilla. On the cake I actually put some frosting on while still warm and omg was that delish!

This banana cake is really good.  I mean REALLY GOOD.  After a couple of failed banana recipes from this website I was really nervous to try another one, but I new there was a good one out there.  I am so glad that I tried this!  WOW WOW WOW!  My husband was licking the icing off of the whisk and giggling.  I'm totally not kidding.  Everyone loved this, even my oldest son who doesn't normally like cake asked for another slice.  The only thing I did differently was add an additional 12 minutes to the cooking time, but our oven may cook a little differently.  I also did not put the cake into the freezer as I had baked it in a glass Pyrex and worried it would shatter at the sudden temperature change.  The cake was still super moist and delicious.  My husband was raving about it and told me to throw away every other banana recipe.  I am definitely making this for the next family gathering.  They will worship the ground I walk on.

This recipe is incredible! As an armature baker, I was hesitant to attempt this recipe. I am a terrible cook! If I do cook or bake something and it turns out okay, it is a huge triumph for me. This recipe sounded a bit difficult but I wanted to do it for my father-in-law's birthday and it turned out amazing! 

I did change a few things though... My oven is electric and therefor inconsistent with temperature. I preheated it to 275  and baked it for an hour. I found that it was still jiggly in the middle. Baked it for 5 miniutes more and did a toothpick check... Did this a few more times  in increments of 5 minutes. So, all together my bake time was an hour and 20 minutes. 

Popped the cake right into the freezer for 45 minutes as the recipe stated. The cake sunk a bit but not too much. 

I made the frosting while the cake was in the freezer but after looking at the reviews of this recipe, I only put 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar rather than 3 1/2 cups as the recipe calls for. 

The cake is dense and moist while the frosting brings a sweet and creamy element to the palate. Super happy that I chose to taste test my frosting while making it. Also happy that I chose to follow a recipe with weird bake times.

This cake is the first cake that I've made from scratch and as an armature, it's the best! If I can do it, you can do it!!!!

"It's like really, really, really good!" Quote from a happy eater. This stuff is amazing. Everyone loves it. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the pan and cooking part. I cooked it in two nine inch round metal cake pans, and made a two layer cake out of it. After checking the cake after one hour it wasn't done. I cranked the oven up to 325 after one hour and cooked it for another 15 minutes. It was done after that. I then let it cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, and then on racks for another 30 minutes. After that I frosted it with cream cheese frosting, and put it in the fridge for a few hours. We enjoyed it as dessert after dinner! Yay!

I have made this cake several times, and always get compliments on the moist, dense,  delicate texture of the finished product. My only complaint about the recipe is that the baking time is WAY off.  At least 45 minutes off.  When I made the cake today, I even temperature tested my oven to make sure it wasn't running cold and elongating the baking time...it was 2 degrees hot.  IF the original submitter would correct the baking time to 1 1/2-2 hours, this recipe would be marvelous. That said, the finished product is worth monkeying around to achieve!

This cake is fantastic! It was pretty easy to make, I tried follow the instructions as written...I did make a mistake and only added 2 cups of sugar, which was fine the bananas I used were supper ripe and had lots of sweetness. I also cut the sugar in the frosting since we don't use a lot of sugar. I did have to add about 20 minutes of baking time since mine was not fully after 60 minutes. After I finished the cake I cut a piece for my husband, he loved it and he's not a cake person. BTW I used about 5 frozen medium bananas.

This is an awesomely moist cake! I was reluctant about the low temp but after an hour I saw it jiggling a little in the middle so I cooked it for 5 more minutes and checked with toothpick...I ended up cooking it an additional 15 minutes (checking every 5 minutes) but it turned out awesome! I think if I had baked it at a higher temp it would have ended up more brown on top - which I don't like! I didn't want to put my hot pan directly in the freezer so I let it sit for 5 minutes for putting in the freezer. 

As for the icing...it wasn't the best tasting and it was super sweet! It tasted more like powdered sugar than cream cheese frosting so I added a little milk to thin it out and it tasted better (and was more like whipped frosting than thick hard-to-spread frosting!) 

Next time (there will be a next time) I will add the powdered sugar a little at a time until it is the consistency I want so it isn't so sweet (with 1-2 T of milk ). I also sprinkled with some crushed pecan pieces I had left over from my holiday baking - yum!

Excellent flavor. Really good. Baking time was off. Had to turn oven up and bake for another 20 min. I made the icing but too sweet so I didn't use it and frankly this cake doesn't need it. Super moist. Huge hit with friends and family. I'd make this again!

Sugar amount  can be adjusted a little less to suit your taste buds..thank you so much for sharing this. At last i have found the perfect banana cake recipe.

I made it with out any changes to the recipe. I did have to bake it   approximately 4-5 minutes longer  than written in recipe. The cake is very delicious and was an instant hit with friends and family.  My cake lasted 4  days  and never got dried out and kept its flavor. I just  used aluminum foil to cover the cake loosely, so it wasn't touching the frosting. I actually have made it  twice now, and will again soon I am sure.

Super sweet, but super good!  Followed all steps including freezing it.  It was enough batter for two 8x8 pans.  the frosting is very rich so I spread it thinly among the two cake pans.  It holds well, but should be refrigerated.  Some of my family said it  was too sweet alone and very rich with the frosting, so to each their own.  To me it was perfect together but a strong cup of coffee works just great with it for those that  think it's too sweet.

Delicious! Moist, light texture! From past experience, freezing a cake- any cake by wrapping in plastic wrap immediately after baking will increase its moisture content. Allowing a cake to cool to room temperature, uncovered, the cake will lose moisture as it evaporates into the air......so the freezing works. With this cake, I didn't have time to freeze, so I covered, allowing condensation to form on the lid, then lifted the lid, allowing the moisture to go back into the cake. Works! 
I didn't have cream cheese, so opted for the caramel frosting from another reader, and it was great on this cake. I added a handful of chopped walnuts before spreading, then dusted the top lightly with kosher salt. YUMMY! Topped with caramel icing.

Made this in an unfamiliar oven so don't know if the reading was accurate, but had to turn up the oven to 300 degrees and cook another 20 min.  Froze as recipes says and the cake came out great.

This is most likely the best banana cake I've ever had in my life, and I think I know food...and cake.  It's the bomb.  Just follow the directions and you won't go wrong.  In my opinion, making it a double-layer cake is better.  That's what I did, and I topped it off with slivered almonds.  I've made this cake twice, and I'm getting ready to make a third one this evening.

Yum yum yum! My husband loves banana bread and I was looking to make something a little different so I chose this recipe based on reviews. I found the low temp and freezer method odd but wow! It made a difference. As for the recipe, it needed some adjusting... I only used 1 1/3c sugar as the bananas also add sweetness. Made buttermilk from 2% milk and lemon juice. Baked in a prepared (cooking spray n floured) bunt pan for 1 he 20 mins. Put the cake outside for 30 minutes (15*F). Frosted per recipe. Frosting was only okay. Needed to add milk to make it smooth and it never really had the flavor I was hoping for. Regardless, covered frosting with walnuts and served. All together the flavors worked well. Hope to use this recipe again for other bday cakes!

I made this cake exactly the way the recipe says and it turned out delicious! The frosting went great with the cake but if you don't have much of a sweet tooth like my mom you can always leave it off, she loved it without the frosting. Me on the other hand I loved everything about this recipe I have made it three times and can't wait to bake another one for my family again. ~Jessica

Amazing. Frosting isn't necessary, very sweet on itself and I found the top naturally got a sticky sweet layer. The only problem was that this gave me at least 30 big slices, it was way too much for me and my husband to finish, but very delicious, When putting the stuff in your baking tin, make sure it is not so liquid, but more like the consistency in the video. Add flour if it's too liquid, otherwise you will get problems cooking it.

This banana bread/cake recipe is the best I have tried! The icing really helps make everything taste so good. I drizzled melted chocolate chips over the top and refrigerated the cake. My family loves the banana bread at Bob Evans and this tastes similar only more like a desert!

I have tried so many different recipes for banana bread, and this is simply the best one even though I had to reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/3 cup and skip the frosting so it wouldn't be too sweet, (especially when you're going for something more healthy). Sometimes I add chopped nuts to it, sometimes I replace 1 cup of flour with 1 cup of almond meal, all taste good! I'm baking it right now with 3/4 cup of cocoa powder in replacement of a 3/4 cup flour to make a chocolate banana bread. We'll see how it turns out.

Wowza! This cake was a hit all around the table (4 to 88 years old)! I wanted to try the original version with 45 minutes in the freezer, but I mis-timed the evening. So we went with one reviewer's suggestion (325 degrees, 55 min). When the cake came out of the oven, I capped it tightly with foil, and let it rest 15 minutes (far from enough time to cool, I know). This is a trick I use for cooling quick breads, as it makes them really moist (though I generally cool them an hour+). We didn't frost/ice the cake. Yum!

I reduced the time to 40 minutes for cupcakes. They came out ok. The flavor is Good but they didn't rise up at all and the flat tops are not as soft as I'd like. Plus, I'd skip the freezer thing. They're really tender as it is and an icy cold cupcake is a little unfriendly.

This recipe is just like the one my Nanny made when i was young. The buttermilk definitely makes a difference. I like to  bake it in a bread pan and add roasted pecans.

Great recipe! I baked it at 300 degrees after reading a few of the other reviews here; I probably could have just stuck with the 275 the recipe called for. The cake finished baking in around 50 minutes at 300 degrees. Nonetheless it came out great.

I was able to pour the mix into two 9" round pans so I made one with frosting and one without. Tastes great either way although the frosting was definitely on the sweet side. Will be making again.

I love this cake.  I am not a big fan of bananas, but this cake is delicious and worth the effort.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added walnuts to the batter and walnuts on top of the icing.  This cake has become my "secret weapon" when I need to ask my husband a big favor.

Everyone loves this cake when I make it and have made it numerous times. People ask me to make it for them all the time. Here is a question, could I substitute pumpkin for the banana to reflect this time of year? Would I need to change any of the other ingredients or amounts if using pumpkin instead of banana?

I always had problems in baking cakes, sometimes the base is too brown or sometimes it's not moist. But after trying your matter my cake came out prefect. The only change I did was placing some chocolates on the top before baking.

Made this following the recipe with no changes.  It was okay, but not extraordinary.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the cake is on the heavy side and somewhat like banana bread (although more involved to prepare).  The bake time took considerably longer than indicated, but ovens do vary.  I probably will not make this recipe again, but the cake will certainly not go to waste.

I gotta say I was skeptical... but oh my!!! The only change I made (upon reading some of the reviews) were 1C White Sugar AND 1C Brown Sugar, I also added 4TB of Corn Starch to the flour! My bananas were from my freezer so I had to strain the juice off but this recipe was deemed THEE BEST banana cake they have ever had!! Oh, I also baked my cake at 300 and then off to the freezer!

No frosting needed although it is great too!  This is a VERY moist cake with fantastic flavor!  I have successfully made this recipe twice and will continue to make it when my bananas don't look so good.  I had a very difficult food critic in the house on my initial bake and she was pleasantly pleased and took some home with her!  It's pretty quick and easy and the taste was moister than expected.  You can add an extra banana and less sugar (for health reasons only) if you want.

My first time, I made this cake exactly according to the recipe.  It turned out perfect and super moist.  My second time, due to a lack of space in my freezer, I followed one of previous reviewers methods.  This was to bake at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  The result this time was a tasty cake, but not very moist.  In the future, I will bake it as instructed by the original recipe.

Moist cake, I only put one and a half cups of sugar in it, next time I will only put one. With the sweetness of the bananas, its too sweet at the recipe instruction. Best cake I have made. Cooked at 135 degrees celcius for 1 1/2 hours perfectly!!! The only downside was how sweet it was..personal preference...

Very moist!!! I would say this is the best banana bread I have ever had! Not really a cake, but very good! I skipped the icing and instead just dusted the top with icing sugar. I also skipped the freezer part (because I had a glass dish and didn't want to chance it breaking) and still came out very moist! Everyone loved it!

YUMMY!! Followed the recipe pretty closely. I did add a pinch of cinnamon to the flour mixture. I have made it both with the original cream cheese frosting and also  made a chocolate cream cheese frosting....both are very good, but the chocolate one was a bit more popular......our guests LOVED it!!! Definitely a keeper!!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was wonderful! Only 4 stars because of baking time. It seemed strange to bake a cake at 275 for an hour but I was willing to try. It actually took over an hour and a half.  By the time it was baked it was past my bedtime, so I stuck it in the freezer for the night and hoped for the best.  Turned out great! Delicious, great texture. Not as sweet as most cake, but the delicious frosting complimented it perfectly.

This was an awesome cake.  I ended up changing the temperature of the oven after an hour at 275 to 325 for 15 minutes to cook it fully.  But it was still moist and delicious.

We had 5 bananas on their way to the garbage so I decided to try and find a way to use them.  So glad I did!  Great recipe, followed it exactly except I used only 2 cups of icing sugar in the cream cheese icing which made it more creamy, less sweet.  This will definitely become a family favorite :)

This is a great recipe but I would advise to use much less sugar for the icing, 1 cup should suffice.

I didn't make any changes to this cake and I must say it was terrible!  It was moist and it tasted like banana, but it was very dense and almost too moist...brick like!  It was hard to get out of the pan after it was was greased and floured!  I've made many cakes over the years, but this was disappointing!

Rave reviews from all who tried this scrumptious cake!  The only change I made was with the icing.  I did a whipped cream cheese version instead.

I agree with family of five in that this recipe made the cake WAAAAY too sweet and dense, and that's not just coming from me but also my family members.
The second time around, I made a few changes to the recipe to see if that would help. The first change was using self-raising flour (same amount) and adding 1 tsp of baking powder instead. I thought this just made it a lot fluffier. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1 + 1/4 cup and scrapped the frosting altogether, using walnuts instead. It is 100 times better this time.

Delightful! Thanks!
Made 2 9" rounds and baked them for 65 minutes at 275 degrees, and I did freeze them. Came out beautifully.

This was great!  My family really enjoyed it and it makes plenty to share.  I think you could vary the icing, but it sure is good just the way the recipe indicates.  I had to add about 20 minutes to the cooking time, but following the recipe instructions worked very well.   I'd write my family's comments, but I can't understand them right now because they're talking with their mouths full of this delicious cake!

One word.  AWESOME.  First time making it I followed directions exactly, just less sugar.  Tonight I made it for the second time, but halved the recipe and sub'd a little of the AP flour for WW flour and also used half the amt of called-for sugar.  Also kept same amt of bananas (3 med sized), so almost like a double dose of banana flavor.  Wonderfully moist, soft, great aroma and flavor.  My kids gobbled up two servings each.  No frosting made, or needed.  One of these days I'll try a chocolate frosting, for guests maybe.

This recipe sounded so delicious that I tried it when it was my turn to bring a treat to work for 18 coworkers!  I made it exactly as instructed.  It smelled wonderful... but it weighed a ton!  I got nervous, but it was all for nothing.  Everyone LOVED this heavy, rich banana cake with cream cheese frosting.  Other's have described it as almost like banana bread and I agree.  One of my coworkers was from Louisiana and she said "You really put your foot in it!"  I've made it dozens of times since then and it is always a crowd pleaser.  (Tip 1:  I have not always had room in my freezer to put the hot cake right in there, so I've learned that you can't make this cake taste anything but heavenly - even if you cool it on the cooling rack.  Tip 2:  I haven't always had the buttermilk and I used that trick of putting lemon juice in the regular milk to make a substitute.  This cake is hard to screw up!)

I had to knock this down to 4  stars since the recipe cook time is off.  After one hour, this was no where near down.  I bumped it up to 350 degrees F for 20 minutes after the hour to get it baked.  But, this cake tastes amazing.  Just fixed the bake time and you're good to go.  Also, I skipped the freezer and it was still moist  and YUM!  Made the icing to my taste with less sugar.

So the first time I made it I was super worried it would spill over.  It did not, but it was close!!   Second time making it, it spilled over a lot...making a mess of the oven and pan!  It takes at least 30 plus more minutes to bake.

Don't change a thing!! This is by far the BEST banana cake/bread I've ever made! The instructions might seem odd, but it works. Another bonus, it makes a lot. My 13x9 glass pan was full to the top. My family was fighting for the last piece-I won! I topped mine with a banana extract flavored cream cheese frosting, but whipped cream or even plain would be great. This is now my favorite dessert!

This is a very moist cake. I didn't have a 9x13 pan so I divided the recipe into an 8"inch round and loaf pan and adjusted the cooking times accordingly. I placed the 8 inch in the freezer post baking but left the banana loaf out on the rack to cool. Can't say whether that made a significant difference. The banana loaf is deliciously moist. My only change next time will be to use LESS sugar. It was way too sweet for my taste and I'm a mega sweet tooth.

oh, wow. so delicious.
Mine was a bit different.
no lemon, so I used lime juice. Had five really ripe bananas, I used them all.
I don't drink regular milk, so I added 1.5 tbsp white vinegar to almond milk. 
used whole wheat flour. no vanilla so didn't have that for cake or frosting.
took 1 hour 15 mins to cook fully at 275. left in the fridge for 60 mins for ease of frosting.
this is delicious, moist. maybe a little less sugar for next time, but will make again.

This is the best banana cake I have ever made. I used whole wheat flour instead and followed the rest of the recipes, still came out moist and delicious. This is surely a keeper!!!

The cake tastes Ok. But... It's that one hour bake time. It's just not right. I know my oven is calibrated and my cake baked for much much longer. I tested the middle after 1 hour. It was dripping wet AND it sank in the middle and never did rise back. Finally after an additional 25 minutes  I pulled the dented cake out of the oven. Since the timing was off and I had to leave the house it was only in the freezer for about 15 min.  It is moist I'm undecided if I'll try again.

We loved this cake. I ran short on the milk so i added 3/4 c of whipping cream. I had to increase the temp on the oven at the end because i panicked. Delish and moist.

I made this cake and frosting following the ingredients, measurements, and directions exactly.  My oven is calibrated, so the temperature is accurate.  However, I had to bake this for 1 hour 30 minutes.  We tried a piece right after icing... could not figure out why I didn't care for it, so I though I should let it rest overnight in the refrigerator.  We then tried another piece, and I took a few bits of frosting and cake separately.

Cake specifics:  It is moist, quite heavy, somewhat floury in flavor, tastes to me like not-quite-baked batter... all of these make it fairly unappealing to me.

Frosting specifics:  It is rich, tastes too much like butter, and feels quite greasy in my mouth.

I think this recipe is a good start, but definitely needs adjustments.  If I try this recipe again, the following is what I will do... The cake should have unsalted butter used.  It should be baked at a more typical cake temperature (350 degrees F) in order that the ingredients can rise appropriately, bake completely and perhaps become more cake-like.  I'm not sure what the bake time will be with the higher temp, but I would likely check it at 30 minutes and then every ten minutes after that.  The frosting fat/sugar ratio needs to be more balanced by adding at least one more cup of powdered sugar.  Also, salted butter should be used, to help complement the sweetness of the frosting.

This recipe has way *way* too much sugar in it! I know it's a dessert, but honestly, this is over the top. The amount of sugar in the frosting is way too much also.

This cake is beyond words.  So. Good.  I add a cup of pecans or walnuts before baking.  It takes about an hour and a half or slightly more to bake completely.  It is a heavy, moist cake, and I get asked for the recipe every time I take it someplace.

Had to cook 30 mins extra. The cake was really moist and the frosting was super sweet.  My sweet tooth kidlet liked it so I'll go with her opinion.

This cake was awesome!! I followed the recipe as listed. I did let the eggs and butter get room temperature before using and baked  the cake with 2 cups of water in a separate bowl on the bottom rack to help keep the cake moist. It worked and all was good.

This recipe was awesome even though I only had one big banana!!!! This cake is nice & rich just like we like em. 
I made mini loafs & put half in the freezer out of the oven and honestly, I couldn't tell the difference between them. I did however freeze whole loaves for a couple of months & they were just as good as the first day. This is a keeper.

Love it and will re-make it over and over again!
This is the third time I've made this cake. The first two times I did not do the whole freezer thing and baked on 350 degrees. Needless to say, it fell, although it was still quite tasty. Today, I followed the directions to the letter (had to let it bake for one hour thirty minutes) and this cake has turned out beautifully and is just like it's author described it, moist and delicious. If you're looking for a great Banana Cake, this is it!! Thanks Cindy!

The best banana cake ever!  I read all the reviews and noticed that some said it was important to use the low temperature and to freeze the cake.  They were correct.  It was so amazing.  Everyone loved it.

Great banana flavor. It was a little too moist for me. Came out of pan ok but a lot of cake left in bottom despite greasing and flouring. I substituted powdered buttermilk to save a trip to the store.  I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer than what recipe called for.  Look forward to trying recipe again but baking more traditional way (350)  and skipping freezer.

This recipe was recommended to me... And for a good reason! It is amazing!! The only thing I changed was leaving out the 1/8 C sugar in the 2 & 1/8 C measurement... I would maybe cut a bit of icing sugar from the icing recipe, but it truly is amazing as is. I did follow the low temp/freezer method... It baked quite a bit longer than recommended (1 hr 20 min maybe?)... But turned out delicious! One thing I would change is: the ingredients don't go in the order in which they are used-a huge pet peeve of mine. Enjoy!

Probably the best banana cake I have ever EVER tasted or made.  The recipe is perfect - came out moist, delicious and flavorful.  I added blueberries and made them into small muffins instead of cake and I didn't have to add any frosting - they came out so perfect I think I ate ten in one sitting.  Since I made them into cupcakes, I only had to bake them for about 35 minutes at the lower temperature but that's the only change I made - really, really delicious!

I just baked this cake for the first time so I didn't alter it. It's moist, rich and easy. I'll keep this one.

This cake is simply amazing and not hard to make. So if you are thinking about making this cake PLEASE DO! :) I made this cake as our dessert one day and my family just loved it. It was even mother n law approved.  I must confess I didn't make any changes but I did substitute ingredients (organic/all natural)that we choose to eat and still a big hit at the dinner table. I decided that I would surprise my grandpa with this cake since he loves bananas. Thank you so much Cindy for  sharing.

I was not overly impressed with this cake. It was good enough but nothing special. I was excited to try the unique baking and freezing method, but did not find it to turn out a cake any moister than other methods. It took an extra half hour in the oven to test just-done. The frosting, as written would be too sweet for me and would have covered up the tang that I love so much in cream cheese frostings. I added two cups of powdered sugar and found it plenty sweet. Don't think I will make this recipe again, though it is definitely tasty enough to finish.

Best banana cake.  Every guest of mine rated 10 out of 10.  I cut the confectioners' sugar to 2 cups and it's sweet enough.

I have literally gained a fanclub due to this cake. I cannot recommend it enough, honestly.  The unconventional cooking method (lower temperature for a longer period of time) and then IMMEDIATELY freezing it locks in the moisture and makes the cake the absolute perfect consistency.  It's almost dense-like, but in the best way possible. Will forever be my husbands birthday cake year after year. :)

This is the best banana cake I ever had, simply because of the texture, moisture, and density. Make sure to follow the temperature and cooling directions.

made this cake exactly like it said and it was absolutely fantastic. The cake is light and so moist. I have never heard of baking a cake at 275 degrees, but it was a great tip to keep this cake so moist. My family loved it. Also, the icing is delicious. Will definitely be making this again

I'm not sure what I'm missing here. I made this exactly as the directions indicated and threw away almost the entire cake. This "cake" tastes like moist banana bread with cream cheese icing on top. To me, those two things do not go together.

I have actually never had banana cake before but my boyfriend requested one for his son's graduation and I found this one. I followed the recipe exactly but had to bake mine for 20 additional minutes. It was WONDERFUL!!! Everyone thought that it was the best they've ever had! Thanks! I'll be making many more of them for sure ;0)

I love this recipe, but I have no idea how I missed the lower baking temp. The only excuse I can think is after mixing, I probably stopped reading and baked as usual. This is the first time baking as directed. I think it will be OK, but it is also the first time I've used powdered buttermilk. It doesn't look the same. Hope it tastes as good.

This is one of the most amazing cakes I have made! It is super moist, light and fluffy! I followed the cake recipe with no changes. However, I did omit the cream cheese frosting; found the cake to be sweet enough without it. I did dust the top of the cake with confectioners' sugar, more for presentation. This is a recipe I will make for many years to come!

I was concerned about compromising the food in my freezer by sticking something so hot inside, but since I have a small empty freezer in garage, I did follow this step.
Only change was evaporated milk with 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice instead of buttermilk (may be why dense, but I like cake that way.)
Received many compliments

This is simply the best banana cake and frosting recipe I have ever made! I follow the recipe exactly (using real butter and real vanilla) and my only addition is one and quarter cups of chopped walnuts. I start checking the cake at 55 min and every 5 minutes until it is done (for my oven that is about 1 hour and 10 min). I have made it for holidays and birthdays and everyone who has tried it has raved about it. Thank you to Cindy, this recipe is a keeper to be shared and passed down.

This was a wonderful, moist cake! I followed the directions exactly for the cake (except adding vinegar to skim milk to make buttermilk, since I did not have any on-hand), and it took me 1 hour and 35 minutes to bake. My kids don't like cream cheese frosting, so I used the recipe for caramel frosting found in the reviews. I personally loved it, but the caramel frosting together with the cake was much too sweet for the rest of my family. Looking at the amt of confectioner's sugar called for in the cream cheese frosting, I would imagine we would have the same issue. I will make this again, but try to get back on the sweetness somehow. Also - using margarine vs. real butter did not impact this recipe at all.

This is definitely going to be my standard banana cake recipe. The cake came out perfectly moist and delicious. 
I sprinkled about 1/2 cup mixture of brown sugar, cinnamon, cocoa powder between two layers of cake batter. Next time i will add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 cup nuts too to this middle layer.

This was a really good cake.  I made it exactly as written.  It took my oven about one hour and 15 minutes to cook thoroughly.  It is definitely a banana cake; slightly denser than your standard box cake, but that is typically the case with cakes from scratch. My entire family loved it.  It reminded one of a banana bread, and another said it reminded her of banana pudding.  All in all, it was just plain good.

This is by far the best cake I've ever had, followed to a T! Perfection, did question the cooking time but my oven sometimes doesn't cook right so mine actually took a little over 3 hrs to cook but came out moist and delicious, this is a keeper and my entire families favorite cake!

I didn't have time to bake it for an hour, then freeze for 45 minutes so I just baked it at 350 for 35 minutes and we ate it warm out of the oven.It was excellent.  I'll try it following the recipe next time but this recipe is great either way.

I tried this recipe and did find that it was unusual to be baking it at such a low temperature.  I did that but had to add on an extra 45 minutes because it just wouldn't get done.  I was too scared to put it in the freezer because I thought my dish may shatter ( I have Pyrex too), so I let it cool a bit and sliced a piece to see how it came out.  It was very good and surprisingly moist. I put it in the refrigerator and the next day, it still was very good and moist.  My true test is my son; if he likes it then I know I did it right.  He liked it and said it was not dry.  Kudos Cindy for an excellent recipe!  I did one thing different; I added a bit of nutmeg and ground cloves (1/2 tsp each)which spiced it up nicely.

This cake is wonderful, very yummy, moist, and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to cook it for about 20 more minutes for it to be cooked thoroughly.  I will definitely make this one again!

Delicious cake!  Doesn't dry out in the pan.  Putting it in the freezer seemed very weird but I did it anyways and it made a very moist cake.  Banana cakes are sometimes heavy.  This was not.

I made exactly according to recipe.  The middle of the cake turned out excellent, but the edges crisped up the outer edges of the cake are more banana bread texture than cake. I did bake at 275 for 1 hour, and froze for 45 minutes. I was a little disappointed the people with edge pieces didn't really get "cake".  I did not use this frosting, I topped with peanut butter frosting.

This recipe was fantastic! The cake turned out lusciously moist and was nice and fluffy. Great flavor too.   I'm not sure why some have given bad reviews. I didn't find my cake to be too dense or bread-like as some have commented. I even made mine at high altitude with no alterations to the recipe. Two thumbs up from me!

Easy to make, fun delicious. It did take a bit longer. An hour and 45 minutes at 275 but it's all moist, and it had to be about an hour and 20 in the freezer. I added lemon extract and I used four packets of cream cheese so I could make a filling in the middle after I cut it. And I added chopped walnuts. The edges are a bit crunchy but good and it's really good. I probably would've added more banana for my preference otherwise I'm very happy.

Almost 2 and a half hours of baking in the oven and its still in there, not quite ready in the middle, but golden everywhere else! Wish I'd read the reviews first so that I could have cooked at higher temperature. Could it be because I'm using gas rather than electic... Nevertheless, looking forward to tasting the finished product. It's 11pm now but I can't give up because I promised the kids they would have it when they wake for breakfast...

I baked this banana cake and I must say, it is the most delicious banana cake I ever had! The cake is SO moist. I first baked the cake, for my husband. I told him, if he thinks it is tasty, then I will bake a banana cake for my coworkers, at work. My husband told me the cake, "was the best he ever had". I used the same recipe, for the cake that I brought to work. My coworkers liked the cake too! I plan to bake this cake more often.

This recipe makes the most delicious, moist, and addicting banana cake. Holy cow! I have to restrain myself from eating too much at once. You could also make them into muffins. The ONLY thing I did differently was that I replaced half of the buttermilk with regular milk and a little vinegar since I didn't have the full 1 1/2 cups pure buttermilk on hand.  Mine only took 5 min. longer to cook than it states. This is a GREAT recipe!

I love banana's and what a more better way to make it more interesting. This is the first time I'm making a banana cake and it turned out awesome!! But like a few others I had to bake the cake much longer than instructed. Don't be worried if the cake is still moist (close to being unbaked) at the bottom, it is just that it's 'intensely' moist because of the banana's. I also but down on the sugar in the icing to just 1 cup (it turned out good) since the cake was sweet enough by itself. Another way to make this cake even more delicious, top it off with vanilla Ice cream and you will have people praising you for a wonderful finger licking good cake.

Wow! This is an awesome way to use up those over ripe bananas. I didn't have space in my freezer, so I baked it at 350 for 40 min. It was moist and delicious! I will make again even if it means buying extra bananas and letting them ripen.

Turns out wonderful every time! I don't love banana desserts and they are never my go-to, but this is surprisingly good. I always decrease the sugar to about 1 1/2 c and its plenty sweet especially with the icing.

Love love love this recipe. I've made it twice. The first time exactly as suggested, but yesterday I made it again a bit tweaked. I didn't have quite enough bananas and I ran out of buttermilk. I ended up using heavy cream instead, then added an extra 1/4 cup cream. It was amazing the first time, and a solid good the second. I say, stick to the recipe but either way it's delicious!

This cake is delicious and super moist. Next time I will start with 2.5 cups of sugar for the icing and taste. The icing was a little too sweet for us and I will only put a thin layer of icing on the cake. This cake is so good, that it doesn't need a lot.  4 medium bananas equaled 1.5 cups for me.  I cooked it for 80 minutes in a metal pan. Will definitely make again.

My family loves this cake.  I've made it a handful of times following the recipe exactly.  I do find it needs approximately 20 minutes more cooking time in my oven.  I frost it with Allrecipes - Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting and it is divine.

AMAZING! The only thing I changed the second time was that I put less frosting because the cake itself is so unbelievably good.  This is our favorite cake, and my husband bakes amazing cakes.  Thank you so much for sharing Cindy!

Follow the directions verbatim, you'll be glad you did.  This cake is so moist and fluffy. I choose not to put frosting on top since I find this cake sweet enough and I prefer a strong banana flavor. It was a hit with my family and coworkers. Thanks for a great new banana recipe.

This was absolutely delicious! The cake was so moist--nothing like a banana bread, as some users have commented. I didn't actually do the frosting, but I added a whole vanilla bean and that kicked it up a notch. Will definitely do this again!

I just made this recipe tonight and followed it exactly except sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top as suggested by other reviewers.  It was delicious! It took 1 hour 25 minutes in my (non-convection) oven. Question for Cindy - do you use unsalted butter or salted? I used unsalted butter and wondered if I should add more salt to accommodate. It was really tasty using just 1/4 tsp salt and unsalted butter but I was just curious. This is definitely a keeper!

I added a little cinnamon to the frosting. In my oven I had to cook it more like an hour and twenty minutes. I also ran out of bananas so I finished the 1.5 cups with about a quarter cup of applesauce. The cake was delicious and very moist.

I have made this several times, and it always comes out great.  I do not put the cake in the freezer after baking, because I am afraid of damaging other items stored in there.  If it is cold outside, I put the cake in my porch for a while.  Despite not following that step, this cake is always moist and delicious.  It is a denser cake, due to the bananas--they are a heavy ingredient--but definitely a cake, not a banana bread in a cake pan.  I also sometimes have to bake the cake a little longer than directed; just watch your cake.

When trying this recipe I discovered that I didn't have buttermilk. Substituted equal parts of Greek yogurt and applesauce to make the 1 1/2 cup measurement. Also added cinnamon to the batter. It turned out delicious and everyone loved it.

I don't usually rate recipes if there are already plenty of reviews, but this banana cake screams for just one more! Simply put, the best banana cake I've ever tasted! I creamed the butter & sugar for 5 minutes...it's important to get the best texture, in my humble opinion. I used a jelly roll pan and cooked it just a bit over an hour--it was perfect! I can't add a photo because we're eating too fast!

Made these for a sport breakfast at my daughter's school and overheard one girl saying they were the best muffins she had ever eaten.
These muffins have made me a legend, and I make sure to never tell anyone how easy they really are.

This cake is definitely a keeper! I didn't have buttermilk in the house, so I substituted what I had in the fridge, fat free sour cream. The cake turned out great anyway; it was moist, light and extremely flavorful. The delicious frosting created a perfect balance. Thanks, Ms. Carnes, for a wonderful  recipe!

Good but pretty heavy. Very moist though.  I added chocolate chips. I think mini chocolate chips would have worked better with the texture,  or maybe no chips (first time I have ever said that about banana cake). I made 2 cakes with this - one 8 inch and one 6x8 inch. I had to bake it much longer - 1 hr 20 min,  and I thought with2 smaller cakes it should have taken less time.

I followed the recipe even though it seemed odd,  I did have to cook it about 20 minutes longer but it was amazing. Nice and chewy but I didn't find it heavy at all like other reviewers had said. This will definitely be my go to banana cake recipe. Instead of the cream cheese frosting I made a peanut butter frosting,  awesome combination.

This is absolutely the best cake ever. I have made it twice with great results both times.  The time spent in the freezer is well spent.  I wonder whether this method could be adapted to another cake recipe such as a chocolate cake to make it equally moist

I made this cake today and took it to a birthday party. It was a huge hit! Some of the men actually went back for seconds! I followed the recipe except I might have added more bananas so that could account for the baking time of at least an hour and a half. I will be making this again for sure!

Wow, dense and delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 7x11 glass dish.  I did have to bake it about 10 extra minutes.  Who'd of thunk about putting a hot cake in the freezer?  It's a keeper.

Fantastic cake! Made this last night for a get together and it was a hit! I wasn't too sure that it was completely baked in the center, and had to bake it much longer than the 1hr bake time. I kept on checking it until toothpick came out clean and put it directly in freezer as instructed. Halved the icing and it was moist, and delicious.  Next time I'll use the convection bake feature on my oven and reduce the sugar a bit. I will definitely be making this again!

Followed the recipe exactly but found the center undercooked.  Having said that, the edges were certainly a hit!  Will definitely try again with a little longer bake time.

Thank you Cindy! This is a great cake! I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fantastic! My husband declared it was one of the best things I had ever made.  Another reviewer called this "country good" and I couldn't agree more. It reminds me of one of grandma's old recipes passed down for generations. After frosting the cake,  I did garnish with toasted walnuts which gave it an extra kick in my opinion.

Phenomenal. I mean, really amazing. I used a little over two cups of banana (four HUGE bananas) and it still came out perfect. This recipe is a keeper. 

The only thing I wouldn't do is the icing recipe. That is just way too sweet for my taste. I use one package of cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, one teaspoon of vanilla, and one cup of confectioners sugar. Just my taste. There's nothing wrong with this icing recipe if you like very sweet icing. 3 1/2 cups of sugar is insane to me for one cake's worth of icing.

I have made this twice. It is the best cake I have ever eaten. Absolutely amazing!  The only thing I have to do that is different is bake about 1 - 1/2 hours (appx) instead of only 1 hour. I also do not use so much powdered sugar in the icing.  I go by consistency, but 2 1/2 cups are plenty.   I have one in the oven now. Can't want until it is finished!

Incredible. Followed metric measurements, cooked it according to all instructions...it took about 10-15 mins longer than was stated but then my oven not overly accurate. Will be making only this banana cake recipe forever more! Sooo light and fluffy, didn't ice as kids prefer it that way. Thanks for an amazing recipe that exceeded expectation :)

This is crazy delicious!!! Made 2 on the first try so I could take one to work. Needless to say, the second cake never made it anywhere. We didn't even want to frost it we ate it so fast!

OMG, this was amazing! One of the best cakes I've ever made! My husband and son loved it! I will definitely make this again. I didn't have the buttermilk so I used the substitution of 1 1/2 Cups Milk and 1 1/2 tsp vinegar. I also had to bake the cake for 1 1/2 hrs.

Made this once but not again. Turned out dry and bland.  The frosting mixture was way too much frosting, I would recommend half the mixture is ample. Disappointed.

Yummy! Made exactly as directed. Used only half the frosting and only 1c. of confectioner's sugar in the icing (it was sweet enough).

The cake was good. But the icing was too sweet even after halving the sugar. Otherwise I recommend trying this .

WOW, this was fantastic! It was deliciously moist and flavorful. And it doesn't even need any frosting. We actually ate almost half of it before I even got a chance to make the frosting. Speaking of the frosting, I used only 2 cups of powdered sugar and it turned out plenty sweet. Also, the cake was in the oven for 1 hour + 40 minutes before it was done. Worth the wait! I won't be using any other banana cake recipe for as long as I live! Thanks for sharing it!

This cake turned out to be heavenly delicious. The only thing I would change would be the amount of icing called for, which was way too much. I would probably cut the amount right in half. Other than that it's a 5 out of 5. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Loved it ! I'm a novice baker and wouldn't know the difference with these baking instructions as opposed to all these others who seemed to be completely taken aback :).....followed it exactly (my oven required an extra 15 mins of baking time) and it turned out amazing. The whole family absolutely loved it. This is a keeper for my recipe box and will be perfect for large gatherings...because it is a dense cake, you don't need to serve a large helping so a 9x13 pan will go very far.
Thank you Cindy!

My new favorite! I was skeptical about the low temperature and going straight into the freezer. I decided to follow the recipe to see if it would indeed come out like others claim. Let me just say, the answer is YES! It is a fabulous cake. The only change I made was in the frosting. I reduced the powdered sugar, as the cake is sweet. When I did that the cake was a perfect balance of banana's, cream cheese, sugar and butter. You can taste all of the flavors in this cake.  I shared the cake with 10 ladies from church and they were awe struck at how well the flavors came together in such a moist cake. They were also surprised at the technique.  Needless to say, this is our families new favorite cake and the only recipe I am using for banana cake!

As usual, I read several reviews before I make a recipe--to see if I need to make any modifications. I did not change a single thing, and the cake came out perfectly! I didn't need any additional baking time, either.

Was a very moist but still flavourful cake, used really ripe bananas, should have reduced the sugar because the more ripe the banana the sweeter it is. Otherwise, delicious!

I work at an Assisted Living as the Food Service Director.  I tried this recipe today for the first time.  I made no changes but tripled the recipe to make enough for 80 pieces. It was a big hit. It was moist and just a beautiful cake.  I will absolutely be making this cake again....-Jo Ann Burk

The taste is amazing ... it is very, very moist.  I put in 3 medium bananas and that was too much, so the middle didn't set properly.  But that is on me (I never get out cups to measure bananas and just use what is on hand) and not on the recipe.  Huge hit at work -- recipe was requested.

Made as written, loved it.  Baked in a convection oven at 275°  in one hour.  The  recipe for the frosting can be cut in half as it makes a  large amount.  Will make again.

Followed the recipe to the T, except added 1cup of blueberries. FANTASTIC! Have already made it 2x in 2days. Highly recommend! (used a toaster over too, as I don't have an oven) :)

This was the best cake and I will make again. I did not put a hot cake from the oven into my freezer I thought it was a joke to damage my refrigerator. Someone (Janna Rod) made a comment its just like banana bread heavy, nowhere near if you follow the cook temp 275. I was reluctant but ended up letting it stay in until the top looked done (10to15 extra minutes). it didn't turn out heavy it wasn't too sweet. Best ever didn't have that intense banana taste. Moist!

Would love to understand the chemistry of low cooking temp and placing the cake in the freezer but it works! Fabulous cake-moist and tasty. Put a little cinnamon into the frosting. Unlike any other banana cake I have ever tasted. This recipe is a keeper!

Amazing! This cake is delicious and moist. I wondered how much it was going to rise without baking powder but it rose quite high and fluffy. The frosting was fabulous too, and I'm not a fan of cream cheese frosting. I found I had to bake it an extra 37 minutes though. I will definitely make this again in the future.

The cooking time in this recipe is not correct! I followed the recipe as it says, and baked the cake for an hour at 275 degrees, and it wasn't even close to done. Still liquid in the middle. I upped the oven's temperature to 350 degrees and baked it for another 20 minutes, and the cake came out moist and delicious. I would still recommend the recipe, but not the baking time.

OMG!  The best banana cake ever!  read all the reviews and didn't change a thing except I baked in two 9in rounds, so I had 1 cakes to take to girls night, and 1 to keep at home :)  Agree with other reviewer that placing in freezer right out of oven is necessary for this  cake to come out soooo moist.  Do not agree with the reviewer that said it tastes like banana bread.  It is a definite cake!

I love all types of cake but I just couldn't eat this. I followed the instructions to the letter and the result was a heavy stodgy brick of cake. I also have a sweet tooth but this is ridiculously sweeet. It contains far too much sugar

I had to alter this recipe because I didn't have some of the ingredients that the recipe called for and my family loves it!! I am a very very beginner baker so I had to search online for replacements for some of the ingredients. Instead of using all-purpose flour, I used WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, 3/4 cup to every 1 cup of ALL PURPOSE FLOUR. Then, I had to make the buttermilk, 1.5 cups of WHOLE MILK + 1.5 tablespoons of WHITE VINEGAR.  Last but not least, I used lime juice instead of lemon juice. I baked it for 75 minutes and put it in the freezer right after for 50 minutes. Took it out, put the cream cheese frosting and it is delicious! Very nice and moist! next time I make it, I might just leave it in the oven for a little while longer. I don't know! I never had cake this moist before

This has become one of my most beloved recipes. It is a dependable recipe, everyone loves it, and the frosting is to die for. Just love it. I am curious though if anyone out there has tried to make this in loaf pans rather than a 9x13, you know, almost like a banana bread? I have yet to find a banana bread recipe I love and was considering trying this in loaf pans but am not an adept enough baker to know how to modify the ingredient amounts or baking times.

This recipe is a real treasure.. I followed every single step and it turns out so soft and edible right out of the freezer. Too bad I didn't get to put the frosting on the cake since everybody said, "No need! It's already best as it is".

This cake is perfection! You don't HAVE to change a single thing and you will get one of the most delicious, moist, decadent cakes you ever put in your mouth! But I do change a few things now and then and it is always a huge hit at my house! Make as is the first time and feel free to tweak after that, IF you think you must. :-)

It is just a fluffier banana bread.  Would have liked a whipped cream based frosting instead of cream cheese too.

I wish I could give 10 stars! This is the most delicious, moist banana cake I have ever had! I used 2 cups sugar instead of 2 1/8. You couldn't tell the difference. It's simply out of this world!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  It has replaced my carrot cake as my family's favorite cake.  My only mistake was that I hadn't used an oven thermometer to check the oven temperature so needed to cook it an additional 15 minutes.  I was concerned it would be dry but it was perfect.  Every single person who has tried this cake has asked for the recipe.

Other reviewers were correct regarding the cooking time in the recipe. I even dare say that the oven temperature is probably the issue. However, after a lengthy cooking time I adjusted the temperature up to 325 degrees.  Cake was moist and flavorful.  I added a cup of chopped pecans and coconut to the frosting.

Baked the cake just like recipe called for, and it was deeelicious!! Like some other reviews mentioned, I had to keep mine in the oven for about 1hr 10mins before it was set in the middle. I also added pecan pieces to the frosting which topped it off! The frosting does make ALOT more than the cake needs, so you can use the leftover for cinnamon/sweet rolls which would be yummy too! My husband liked the cake (and went for seconds) and he doesn't even like bananas! Highly recommend this recipe!!! Thanks for sharing.

This cake was easy to make and I made it once by hand mixing only and once with a mixer.  I think I like the texture of cake by hand mixing!  Also, made it with rice flour!  Gluten free!

I used 2c. white sugar and it was plenty sweet. Tasted even better the next day after storing in the fridge, it was still moist too. Delicious!

I've been looking for a banana cake recipe for 35 years that would match my mothers that was lost. I finally found it!! This is the best banana cake I have ever tasted (sorry mom).  Recipe makes enough for a 9x13 cake and bread loaf pan. So moist and delicious. Even two of my 5 children who don't  care much for bananas love it! Make it 5-6 times a year. Thanks so much for sharing!

WOW!  I had never even considered making a banana cake, but this recipe intrigued me.  The reviews seemed too good to be true.  This cake is fluffy and moist.  I made this exact recipe (with the exception of making my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar) I used Gluten Free flour mix (Domata living flour) and it was delicious.  Thank you for Cindy Carnes!  It is really good.

Yayyy!!! This method of freezing definitely works! And here I explain why it's only 4 stars: 1. The baking time is not right. I baked my cake in a 9" pan for 1 hour and 30 min, though with higher heat (150 C) and also I baked around 10 muffins for 40 min.  2. The icing is devilishly sweet!!! It' s the right way to a dentist. Besides, it's quite runny and doesn't hold shape. Need to try some other frosting.
After all it's a very tasty, fragrant and moist cake. Not as moist as cakes made with oil but nevertheless! I added fresh cranberries right on the top. They slightly diluted this oversweet frosting.

This was very good, but very sweet - especially if you're bananas are very ripe. I will cut the sugar next time.

This cake is amazing! I followed the directions exactly with no changes. It was perfect. My only suggestion is that I think it would tastes incredible with chocolate cream cheese frosting. Thank you so much, Cindy! I've been searching for a good banana cake recipe for years.

This recipe lives up to its 5 start rating and yes--whatever that putting it in the freezer thing does, I'm sure it serves a purpose.  It was so moist and the frosting was oh so delicious!  Just as a side comment, I never rate anything and so for me to do so means this recipe is credible.

I made this cake EXACTLY as described. It was FABULOUS!! Even my husband, who doesn't like bananas, was impressed. (He liked the frosting the best;)) It was gone in 3 days. Thank you for giving me something other than banana bread to make with my aging bananas! I'm sure I will be making again...

I don't  like bananas, so I'm taking the word of everyone around me. They say it is soo good! Someone gave me a lot of bananas, so the only thing I knew to do was bake something. I followed the recipe to the letter. I took off one star  because this took 2 hours to bake! Other than that, It's a homerun.

Great and unusual way of baking.  Turns out perfect for me everytime.  Depending on the ovens I've used I do occasionally have to increase baking times.  Instructions might sound totally strange but if you just bake until the middle doesn't jiggle and there is just a slight golden brown ring at the edge on on the bubbles on top.  Take out and immedately freeze.  You can also freeze it completely it makes icing it a breeze then let it thaw after icing.  Tastes better cold in my opinion.

I prepared this cake for a company pitch in. I thought as others, a temperature of 275 degrees for a cake...This was the biggest hit of the entire pitch-in, and numerous people said it was the best cake they have ever eaten. I had to send them all the recipe, and they are still raving on the cake a week later. I can't express how wonderful this cake is, delicious! It did concern me putting the cake in the freezer, since I had baked it in a glass 13x9 dish. I wrapped the hot glass pan, in a light towel, since I was afraid it would break the dish, and explode.

I found the original version of this recipe printed on a package of bananas 25 years ago in Canada. It was my favourite banana bread recipe but I lost it when I moved decades ago. I am very glad to have found it here. However, the ingredients proportion in the original version may be a slightly different (I think) and DEFINITELY does not call for baking at such a low temperature or putting it in the freezer. I call this an "Idiot's proof Banana Cake/Bread" recipe because no matter what you do with this recipe, nothing can go wrong with it. I have tried reducing the sugar, adding more bananas, adding more lemon, adding more vanilla, adding bit more butter at various times and it ALWAYS turns out pefectly moist. I was late for my appointment yesterday so I baked it at 150 degrees celcius for it to cook a bit faster WITHOUT freezing and it turned out perfectly moist. Seriously, there is NO need to bake it at such a low temperature or freeze it to achieve the perfect taste and moisture. Try it and you will see! By the way, does anyone have the original recipe or know where I can find the original recipe? I would love to have it back! Thanks!

This was sooooo good.  I made it yesterday and my husband can't stop eating it!  LOL  He even asked when I was going to make it again.  I did make one change: I used 1 cup of packed light brown sugar in place of the 2 1/8 cups white sugar.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  This is truly a winner and will definitely be made again!

The cake is FABULOUS, but for me, the icing overpowers the flavor of the cake.  Next time I will just dabble cool whip on top.  Great recipe!

I am famous in my neighborhood for this cake. People ask me to bake it for their birthdays and I try to do it whenever I can. Use caramel frosting IV and you'll have people not exactly begging you for the recipe but asking you to make it again. And again.

This was really good... I might be making this instead of banana bread from now on!!
Definitely follow the recipe. It is so very moist. I didn't have the cream cheese to I used canned frosting but next time I will make it ALL from scratch.

I just made this cake and it came out perfectly! The adjustments I made were that I reduced the sugar by about half a cup (the sweetness in the overripe bananas that I had made up for the reduced sugar)  and I baked it in the oven at 350F for about 45 mins and placed it in the freezer for 30 mins. Absolutely delicious!

Had my oven set to 275 and after an hour, it was STILL needing more time... had to keep it in another half hour. Cake turned out hard on the edges, very sweet. Probably would be better to bake in muffin tins instead of a big cake. And at a higher temperature, with less sugar.

This was the most amazing banana cake I've ever made, and ate! It's perfect! Very moist and delicious. I definitely think the baking method makes all the difference. Not only did I love it, my family did also. It didn't even last a day!

Excellent banana cake, five stars for sure! Did not make the frosting, as I did not want to add more calories as I made the cake for my husband and myself. Did not put the cake in the freezer either. Moist as can be, give you more stars if I could. Thank you Cindy will pass this recipe to others.

This cake is delicious!  I followed the ingredients exactly but cooked it @ 325 because I didn't have a lot of time. It was awesome.  I think the freezer step could be skipped because I don't know how it could have been more moist.  Will definitely make again.

I just made this recipe today, followed the recipe exactly except for baking at 300 degrees for one hour.  It was cooked perfectly when I took it out.  Followed the directions and put in the freezer for 45 minutes.  The only other change I made was using less sugar in the frosting, I ended up with about 2 1/4 cups and it is super sweet still.  This cake is delicious, I will definitely be adding it to my recipe book.

This is one of the tastiest and easiest cakes I have ever made! It has a perfect moist texture and everyone I've served it to has loved it, even those that expressed skepticism about a cake based on bananas. I sometimes add some chocolate chips to the frosting because I love the texture and the added flavor.

This recipe is by far the best, moist cake I've made in awhile. I was leery about putting it in the freezer but my oh my.  Definitely worth making this again!  I don't plan on sharing this with friends anytime soon.   I'll be keeping this one to myself for awhile.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and it was a HUGE hit, everyone loved it and it was eaten in a matter of minutes! I didn't have the opportunity to stick it in the freezer only because there was no space for it. I did however wrap it in the foil and it was still so moist and delicious! I've already received a request for another one! AWESOME AWESOME recipe!

I just made this cake, it is delicious! My whole family loved it. I made it just as written except I didn't have buttermilk so I used one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice with milk to sub. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I made this for Father's Day and it was a HUGE HIT (which is rare for me). I followed the recipe exactly (freezer and all) and it was fantastic. I will use less frosting next time though, everyone seemed to be scrapping off a little of it.... it's uber rich frosting. A+ Recipe!

Turned out a perfect large rectangular sheet style cake for me, browned lightly in 9x13x2 glass pyrex).I'd describe a lighter texture that almost crumbles in your hand as you eat it...yet stays intact.It's like the exact cake alternate for banana bread. Full of sugar! Nice treat. I served half and froze half, for what we need.

This cake was sensational.  Easy, too, but make it the day before or morning of.  One hour was not long enough for it to be done, but I wasn't paying attention and took it out and to the freezer before testing it.  The center sunk in and I was afraid that I'd have to throw away the middle.  But the kids woofed it anyway.  Next time, I'll test it and leave it in longer. Mmmmm.

This came out exactly the texture I had hoped (and as another reviewer stated), like a light banana bread... but much more tender crumb as one would expect from a cake.  I halved the recipe and did it in a 6" x 10" cake pan (an 8" x 8" would have worked).  The only "goof" I made was that I had buttermilk in the fridge and I thought it was OK but it was NOT, so I substituted a 6 ounce container of vanilla yogurt.  I hate to deviate from the recipe when making it for the first time, but it was either improvise or serve Chips Ahoy for dessert.  Otherwise, I made it exactly as stated.  Although the baking time for me was about 90 minutes, it was nowhere near done at 60.  So definitely do use the toothpick method to check.  I think the flavor improved the next day, so the next time I'll make this a day ahead which is actually a bonus... one less thing to do on the day of having company over.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I followed exact baking instructions...275 for 1 hour, then freeze.  I did have to bake about 10 minutes longer.  I omitted the lemon juice.  The cake turned out amazing. I have made several banana cakes before, but this one is the best I have made.  I cannot imagine a better banana cake. Our personal preference is to serve with a big dollop of whipped cream instead of the frosting.

Just made the cake.  Didn't put in the lemon juice. Actually I forgot until I had the cake in the pan.  But other than that  I followed the recipe to the T.  It is fabulous.  Baked perfect at 275.  We are at altitude 3700.  But still didn't make any changes.  Will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and did bake it at 275.  I had to add an additional 30 minutes however, until the center was cooked.  My family really enjoyed this and I will keep this in my recipe box.

(Update: 9-3-2017 I have now made this cake several times over the past few years. It is my "go to"cake for any bake sale, funeral dinner, or potluck. Everyone loves it! Do not hesitate on the cooking temperature, It works.  However it does take about 1 hr, 20 minutes at 275.) **I made this cake for Easter this morning. It is the best tasting cake! I followed the recipe for the cake exactly. I ended up having to bake it 1 hour and 25 minutes, after the first hour I tested it every 10 minutes with a toothpick. I baked it in glass pyrex and went right from the oven into the freezer. I also had to make a carrot cake so I didnt want to use the cream cheese frosting on both cakes. So on the banana cake I made a glaze instead. The glaze is a 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, 3 cups confectioners sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Heat the  1/2 cup butter and milk in a saucepan over medium heat until combined, about 5 minutes, stirring the whole time. Stir in the confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract until smooth. Pour the warm frosting over the cake. It will set in about 10 minutes. I also sprinkled some walnuts on the top. Seriously one of the best cakes ever. Got rave reviews! I am sure it would have been just as good with the cream cheese frosting but I wanted the 2 cakes to be different. PS..SAMS carrot cake is to die for too!!!

The cake, when cooked and cooled as written, was moist and delicious.  I used mostly frozen over-ripe bananas, which added to the intensity of the banana flavor.  I did add 1/2 cups less sugar and mixed white and brown sugar; I could have even lessened it a bit more.  I followed the recipe other than that.  A very tasty crowd pleaser.

The cake is fabulous - I followed the recipe exactly, but I do have to agree with the others about the baking time (sorry, Cindy!) At one hour, it was still pretty much goop! I then added 20 minutes, checked with the toothpick, still not done; I added another 10 minutes; then another 10 - so my total baking time at 275 degrees was 1 hour, 40 minutes. I'm not complaining, though - just stating! If you choose as I did to bake it Cindy's way, it might take this long. Just keep checking. I did then remove it directly to the freezer. I used the Buttercream Icing recipe from this site - using all butter, no shortening - and the result is ... let's just say I have to keep myself from taking "just a forkful" every time I walk past!

The recipe worked for me although total bake time was an hour and a half. Good taste not as light as I was looking for and not a strong enough banana flavor. I followed recipe exactly fyi.

I followed the recipe directions exactly and would not change a thing. I did have to bake the cake about 10 minutes longer. The cake tasted absolutely wonderful! There are only 2 of us in the house, so I took a large portion of the cake to work. (other wise I would have eaten the whole darn thing) It was a SUPER hit at work, nothing but praise from everyone who tried it!

I can understand why some people might not like this cake; it's not a traditional banana cake.  It's very dense, almost more like a bread pudding than a cake.   At my house, however, this cake is well-loved.  My husband is a banana cake aficionado.  His opinion on every banana cake is based on the moistness factor, and no other cake can compete on that point.  I think it's the first recipe I've tried that calls for ripe, rather than overripe, bananas.  I like that; it does away with that overbearing banana-flavor thing that can happen at times.  I have it in the oven right now; it's the first time I've tried adding chocolate chips to the batter. If you're kind of a sugar-wimp, use a different frosting or leave the frosting off altogether.  But if you can hold your own at the dessert table, go for it!

I too had to turn the oven up to 300 for the last 15 minutes, but cake turned out delicious. I used 2% milk instead of butter milk and orange juice instead of lemon.  I did put into the freezer, but my husband whined so much about "it smells so good, I can't wait for 45 minutes" that I took it out after 10, poured sour cream icing over it (I didn't have cream cheese, and this is more of a glaze).  It was awesome and banana foster like in it's warm state.  I am sure it will be just as delicious cold.  Thanks Cindy

I have tried many Banana cake recipes and this one is by far the best.  I didn't have buttermmilk so I made the mock milk/lemon mixture and it was just perfect and less fattening.  I also used cool whip instead of the frosting. My family loved it.  The frezer idea threw me off but I did it and just as promised it made it very moist.

This recipe is good but it had a bit too much sugar for me. It was VERY sweet without the frosting. The baking time is WAY off. I baked it for 1hr & 10 minutes still SOUP so I raised the temp to 300 & cooked another 30 minutes before it was done. It is very dense which is what I loved about it & what I wanted in a banana cake. It is VERY moist & a winner ill make again with a few tweaks of the recipe. Next time ill cook at 300 and use half cup less sugar.

This cake did take about 1 1/2 hours at 275 and I put it outside on my back porch for a bit after instead of the freezer...but it was AMAZING. Everyone I shared it with raved about it being the best banana cake they'd ever had. The icing was a bit sweet for my taste, but no one else seemed to think so.

Made this according to the recipe except I had no buttermilk and substituted with milk and a tablespoon of vinegar.  The buttermilk must be a key ingredient because it turned out heavy and not nearly as moist as I was expecting.  I will try it again with the buttermilk because others have had such great reviews.

Everyone loves this cake, the last time I took this cake to  a gathering I felt so guilty that no one touched the other's cakes at all. haha  They'd better step up their dessert recipes for next time because I'll be making this banana cake again and again! The only thing that I do differently is use milk and lemon juice as my buttermilk as I seem to never have buttermilk on hand when making this cake. It never disappoints but be sure to honor the odd baking instructions. Enjoy!

I have made this cake about 8 times and it always turns out great.  The cream cheese frosting really complements the cake.  I will make this cake many more times!

I had to leave it in the oven a little longer, maybe about 15-20 minutes, but this is the most delicious and moist banana cake I've ever made/tried!  I followed everything else to a T and even put it in the freezer hot out of the oven.  This is definitely the only banana cake I will make from now on.  I had it with strawberry sauce, my kids had it with cream cheese icing.  Thank you!

Great Birthday cake.  Like most, I was weary to place a hot cake in the freezer but I did it & it was very moist.  Will make again.

Somehow I overlooked that this recipe called for buttermilk. I had already begun mixing the ingredients so I decided to improvise and used 3/4 cup of 1% milk instead. It did not seem to impact the consistency or flavor. I made cupcakes instead of cake. I also decided to skip the freezer step and just cook at 375 for about 15 minutes. The cupcakes were perfect.

Cindy, thank you so very much for sharing such a delicious recipe.  I followed your instructions exactly, and my family raved about the cake.  It was so moist and the topping was perfectly ravishing!  An excellent cake to bake for festive occasions as well as to delight immediate family!  The banana flavour, the moistness, the generous size of the cake, the cream cheese icing on top-- WOW!!!  Thank you, Cindy!

The timing was a little off for me.. Took about an hour and a half, as opposed to a hour; however, it was well worth the wait! So delicious! I actually didn't have butter milk, so in place I mixed 1 1/2 cups of milk with 1 tbsp of fresh squeezed lemon.. Tasted great!

Following the recipe as written I found the cake was way too sweet both cake & frosting maybe because I used very ripe bananas, it was lacking that true banana flavor i'm looking for. The cake was also very dense in texture. My second try in baking this was way better to my preference. Using 3 med very over-ripe bananas I reduced the sugar to a little less than 1 3/4 cup. I also used salted butter for the batter because I only had enough unsalted butter for the frosting. I cut the salt to 1/8 kosher, I also added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon to batter. Added a little less of a 1 tsp baking powder keeping in mind that original cake was dense. Poured in 2 9" round cake (bottom lined w/parchament paper & sprayed w/pam) I had to put them on a scale so I could even out batter by weight. The extra batter I put it into 1 mini loaf pan sprayed w/pam. Baked 45-50 min. Loaf was done less than that. USE THE TOOTHPICK TEST to check if cake was done. Left in pan to cool. My toddler & I loved the warm mini loaf out of the pan no frosting as is very delicious, moist & that banana flavor I was looking for. Next time I'll make mini loaf cakes. As for the frosting really the cake didn't really need it. It was great alone. But I did frost one of the cake. I decreased the powdered sugar about 1 cup & added 1/2 cup each time after I mixed well & did a taste test it, you can add sugar a little at a time its about your taste preference on sweetness, remember you can add but can't take away.

Just made this recipe today and it turned out awesome. I added a cup of chocolate chips, just because I'm a chocoholic. Since I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, I substituted it with 1 1/2tsp lime juice and you couldn't even tell. I will be adding this one to my recipe box of favourites.

This cake turned out delicious, but I had a bit of trouble with it! Other reviewers have said the recipe creates a lot of batter...boy they weren't kidding! I couldn't find my 9x13 so I put it in my 8x11 and it overflowed! I had it in the oven at 275 like the recipe said; after an hour and twenty I gave up and put it up to 350. Naturally because of the overflow, the cake collapsed. I didn't put it in the freezer either (at this point I figured it was a writeoff). It actually still turned out really moist. Plus I covered it with a healthy serving of cream cheese icing! In all, it didn't look fantastic but boy was it delicious. This may actually replace carrot cake as my new go-to cake!

This is definately a family fav! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly (with the exeption that I had a pan slightly larger than the required 9x13" pan) and it turned out wonderful!  Since then, I've made it numerous times and each time both family and friends gobble it up :) This is a keeper for sure!!

This cake was so good!  I used less sugar in both the cake & the icing because it just seemed like too much.  I did not place it in the freezer to cool because my freezer is packed full.  I found that it took longer than an hour to bake at 275 degrees, which made the edges a little too brown.  I may try it at a slightly higher temperature next time.  That said, everyone I have shared it with has loved it!  It is moist & flavorful.

As a rule I don't like bananas but I try to set a good example for my grandkids so I force myself to eat them, I had about 4 left over last week and they were getting very ripe so I began looking for a recipe to use them up, (I don't like banana bread)so my search began and I found this one. All I can say is WOW I shared the finished product with several people and everyone wanted the recipe. This is the best cake ever, as a matter fact I am baking another this week to share with the teachers at my grandkids school. LOVE LOVE this cake.

This cake was very moist & yummy, but I need to find a different icing for it.  I made the cream cheese frosting, but it was way too sweet for this cake.  What I really wanted was a nice creamy refrigerated icing, but I couldn't settle on a recipe.  I ended up making my standard buttercream recipe but it was too sweet also.  We ended up scraping off most of the icing and eating it plain.  I do think it would be awesome with a nice creamy not overly sweet icing.

What a great cake! I did not have any buttermilk on hand, so I substituted plain Greek yogurt in a 1:1 ratio as a healthier alternative. It worked perfectly! The cake was light and sweet but not overpowering, and was a big hit with everyone who tried it. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an excellent cake!  However, after the hour at 275F it was still jiggly in the middle, so I raised it to 325 for about 15 minutes and then it was done. I wasn't going to put it in the freezer, but after 10 minutes on the counter I decided to try it, so did the 45 min in the freezer.  I also did half whole wheat flour and no lemon juice because we have a citrus allergy in my family.  Don't know if all that made any difference, but it is DELICIOUS!!  It is light and fluffy and rose all the way to the top of the pan!  I think it would be great with nuts, but then my kids would never eat it and I'd be stuck with all 60,000 calories!  The frosting is very thick, so you could make less if you want it less decadent. But my family loves it!

This is actually REALLY GOOD! I did bake it at 275, which sounded wierd, but it was awesome! I did bake it in a jelly roll pan (to cut down on bake time, and for a greater frosting ratio) Two days later, still great and moist! The frosting is the exact recipe I use for my cinnamon rolls! Love this!

My mom asked me to make a cake for her to take to work today.  I already had all the ingredients for this cake so I decided to give it a try.  It had such great reviews from the staff that I made a second one today.  Followed the directions to the "T" and was absolutely fabulous, so moist!!!

Really delicious! I'm not sure what's going on with people's ovens; I used a bundt and baked for 1hr15min and it was just perfect, maybe perfectly undercooked. Freezer for almost an hour and then frosted. I also forgot the buttermilk and had to use milk/vinegar with no issue. So easy my 3 year old helped me :) Thanks for a great recipe, my hubby isn't big on sweets but loved this for his bday!

Very moist. Great tasting! Took a lot longer to cook than just 1 hour. Worth the wait.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.  SOOOOO good, moist, delicious.  I didn't have the ingredients for the frosting so served without and everyone raved.  I used a 10x15 pan as this was for a pot luck, and it took about 1hr and 15 minutes at 275.  this is going in my recipe box and I am sharing with my friends.  

Was wondering if anyone has tried it with applesauce in place of the butter.  Did it turn out OK.

UPDATE:  I now replace at least half of the butter with applesauce and have decreased my sugar to about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 Cups.  Still tastes fantastic and healthier.  Have yet to ever make the frosting, we just devour this cake and everyone who tries it loves it.

Made this for my husbands b-day. It was good but I didn't feel that it was light the way others had said. It was more like a heavy banana bread with icing. Was looking forward to a light banana cake.

Great cake!  I used sugar substitute and sugar divided equally.  My husband declared this the best cake I've made!  My daughter loved this too!  I used 3 & 1/4 cups confectioners sugar for the frosting.  I did the freezer thing and the cake was terrific.  I am not willing to not do it since it was fantastic this way.  I did not measure the bananas or mash them.  When bananas are overripe at my house, I throw them in the freezer to bake with.  Just thaw on a plate at room temp for 20 minutes or so.  The banana just basically pours out and looks mashed/pureed already!  So easy! I used 3 bananas.  I figured one banana is equal to about 1/2 cup.

This was an exceptional banana cake.  The only change I made to the recipe was not using lemon juice because I didn't have any on-hand.  I ended up cooking the batter in 2 8x11 pans, and had plenty of batter to make a double layer cake.  They ended up cooking about 1hr 10 mins instead of the 1hr from the recipe probably because it was thicker.  Overall, a really easy recipe to follow and turned out fantastic!

Probably the best cake I have ever made! My husband and kids devoured this! I am so tired of people giving items reviews when they do not even follow the recipe. Please refrain from a critique unless you have followed your directions. My husband took what was left to the hospital and all of a sudden people were offering me money to bake another for them. FOLLOW THE RECIPE! ITS EXCELLENT!

We love this cake!  I gave my daughter half of the cake to take to work, to keep me from eating too much of it.  Everyone raved about it and practically begged her to bring more. So she did.  
The best thing about this cake is that it got better each day.   I will make this cake again and again.

OMG!  This cake is the most fabulous  cake ever!  I am a newbie baker and I followed the recipe exactly and it delivered.  My family raved, oohed, aahed and were completely impressed.  Don't tinker with this one, it is perfect "as is."  Also, don't skip the whole freezer time, it will blow you away by how moist it makes the cake.  My husband( the ultimate picky cake eater) devoured this one piece at a time and since it is made in a 13x9 Pyrex, there is plenty to share, but only if you want to >;)

I didn't have buttermilk, so I added 1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar to 2% milk to sour it.  I also used 4 med/large bananas.  I baked it in two 9-inch springforms at 300F for 1 hour and 10 minutes.  I did freeze the cakes immediately after I removed them from the oven for 30 minutes.  I then removed them from the pans and wrapped them in plastic wrap and froze them to use a week later.  The cake was very moist and flavorful.  Will make again!

I used twice as much banana and could only freeze for 30 minutes because guests were ready. The cake was still warm in the center. Super moist banana bread like cake. Next time I will add walnuts to cake mix but it isn't necessary I just think it will be extra yummy. Everyone loved it!

This cake tastes so good, I'm fighting myself constantly not to go and eat some more! There's only my mother and I in the house and that's probably why it's still here. I followed the recipe exactly as written and was not let down at all. The icing seemed a bit out of place, but I have a feeling that I messed it up, (I thought I lost count while adding the sugar). Either way, it still came out nicely. Anytime I have extra bananas, this is the recipe I'm going for!

Just made your declicious cake and took it into the office.  It is a big hit!!!!  Everyone loves it and it reminds me of a cross between banana nut bread and carrot cake, maybe it is the cream cheese frosting.  
Your directions were excellent.  I added some chopped walnuts and had to add a little time to cooking, but it turned our wonderful, and moist.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! Followed the reviews that said to change the sugar to 1 cup brown sugar, use self-rising flour instead of all-purpose, double the vanilla, and cut the salt. Also cooked it for 40 minutes at 345 or so, and turned out great!

I am giving this 4 stars because the batter was so good but baking by the directions didn't go so well.  I checked it with the tooth pick and it came out clean...I don't know what happened.  Parts of the cake still didn't set well.  I will try this again because I will triumph!  The icing was soooo good too!

I've made this cake four times.  It ALWAYS gets high praises.  In our oven it takes 80 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean.  It also took almost an hour in the freezer to completely cool.  The unconventional baking method works- I don't understand it, but it bakes up beautifully.  We top ours with Nutella frosting instead of the recipe's frosting- we love the flavor combination of Nutella with banana.

This is a great banana cake recipe!! I thought it would turn out as banana bread but boy was I wrong!! I did substitute the buttermilk for coconut milk and it was just as moist and delicious! My family loved it so much, it didn't last the day.  For the frosting I used whipped cream, cream cheese and powdered sugar topped with some slice strawberries.  I will make this again and again!

Myself and my family LOVED this cake, JUST finished a piece. It is dense but very moist and flavorful. I made a double layer square and it turned out wonderfully. The ONLY change I made was substituting the buttermilk for sour cream. I will try it eventually with the buttermilk just to see. I frosted it with a traditional home made buttercream. Sprinkled it with pulverized walnuts. DEFINITELY A KEEPER!

Definitely moist and tastes very good!  Followed the recipe exactly as written.  With the frosting (the best I've had to date, and not too sweet) it can pass as wedding cake quality, if not better!  I sliced mine into 48 squares and topped each piece with a candy pearl for a simple but elegant look.  Look forward to testing the recipe with a different fruit, and trying an eggless version.

OMG! Can you say great Banana flavor and very moist.  Do not adjust the temperature and Do put it in the freezer.  I usually use the Wilton bake even strips, but I didn't on this cake because of the already low cooking temp.  I made this cake for Father's Day and It was LOVED!  My Father-in-Law is very picky, and he even complimented the cake (actually said I had outdone myself). WOW thank you for the great recipe.

This cake was easy and moist, the icing was very good. The cakes flavor was unusual(banana) and it seemed to lack flavor ie. not much ooh,aah factor. The icing helped that. When I have ripe bananas I may make it again. Good "change"recipe.

this was my first attempt at banana cake...and realizing that i didnt have enough cream cheese for the frosting hasnt kept it from being eaten without any frosting at all...i didnt have any buttermilk so i did vinegar with milk and 1c white sugar with 1/2c brown sugar...definitely a rival to my mother in laws banana cake!

This cake is incredibly YUMMY!  Very moist.  It makes a lot of cake and so I cut into individual pieces and froze.  Just letting it thaw for a little bit doesn't take anything away from the flavor.  This is definitely a keeper.

Picky husband loved it!! With my old oven I decided to just bake it pretty much like a regular cake and it came out fantastic and very moist! This makes a lot of cake as I got a large bundt cake and 6 muffins out of it. I baked it in a bundt pan for 45 min at 325 (old oven)... after that I let it sit on a rack for about 10 min, turned the cake onto a baking sheet and then returned it to the oven for another 15 min or so as the bottom of the cake was not completely done. I didn't frost it and it didn't need it. This cake tasted delicious and stayed moist until the last crumb! Will make again for sure!

I make this all the time. My entire family, inlaws and all ask for it for every birthday. It is kind of a pain, mostly because it takes forever to bake, but the low temp really does make a difference. I've made it with walnuts and pecans also, anything works great with it.

I made this for the first time and it came out very moist. It took about 15 minutes longer to cook than the given time, but that just might be my oven. So make sure to check it every so often afterwards if it hasn't baked in an hour. I didn't have butter milk so I did the milk and vinegar trick.... and I just used 2 cups of white sugar. When I made the frosting I didn't use all that sugar! You wouldn't have been able to taste the cream cheese! So I used a little less than 2-1/2 cups.... There was a lot of it too >_

i've never reviewed a recipe before - that's how good this one is! i didn't change a blessed thing from the original.

i'm about to make my second cake in three days - i took some of the first recipe to some friends. then my family tasted it and they were mad i shared! they insisted i make another one - and made me vow to never share again! :D

I just made this cake and it was awesome.  It is very moist and has the perfect texture of a fluffy cake.  Yum! I halved the recipe to try it out and I did add some cinnamon and allspice which helped bring out the banana flavor.  Baked at 300 degrees for 50 mins, then popped it in the freezer for 30 mins and there is almost none left, great recipe!

I made a half of the recipe three times. The first time I used: 3 Tbp butter and 3 Tbp coconut oil, 1/2 brown sugar, 1 egg, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1-1/2 C flour, 3/4 tsp baking soda, 1/8 tsp salt, 3/4 C milk plus 2 Tbp white vinegar, 2 mashed ripe bananas. Baked at 325 F for 45 min. It was a moist cake. The second time I reduced oil and added 3 ripe bananas and dear hubby enthusiastically liquified the bananas, the wet baked cake later had to be sliced and baked into crispy and gooey cookies;) but still tasty. The third time, I used 1/4 C and 1/8 C sunflower seed oil and added 3/4 tsp baking pwd in addition to baking soda. The turnout was more like a bread. Overall, good banana flavor.

This is the first time I ever made a banana cake.  This was great.   I did have to bake it longer than an hour to get the middle done - it may be my oven.  I can't wait to see how this stacks up to my sister's mother-in-law's banana cake. Everyone says hers is the best.  They'll have to wait for the next time I make it though, because with 4 boys and my husband (me too), this one didn't make it out of the house. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Good cake. Longer baking & freezer trick really worked. Thanks for that! Cake was moist, but missing something. Maybe nuts or chips next time. Will make again for sure.

This is awesome!!  Followed directions exactly other than subbing milk/lemon juice for the buttermilk, because I didn't have any.  My family thought it was just wonderful - even without the frosting!  Do try this, you'll be very pleased.

I would have rated higher, it was really good, but it was more of a bread density than a cake.  the frosting made it "cakey" and delicious.  I will probably make it again, but I might light my banana bread just as well.

These were fantastic!!   I used 2 Cups of bananas added mini chocolate chips at the end and made cupcakes ( 35 :-) They cooked for 35 min and I put them in the freezer for 30 min -- they were awesome and very moist. I had read before about the freezer trick to create a moist cake. Oh, I also added crushed Pecans to the fosting.

So good! The only change I made to the recipe was to add about 3/4 c. extra of bananas and a bit of cinnamon! I also made them as cupcakes to shorten the baking time.. about 35 minutes. Made about 28 cupcakes! My husband loved them... will make again soon! :)

Absolutely delicious!! One of the best cakes I have ever eaten. I added chocolate chips (just because I like chocolate and bananas), but they all sunk to the bottom and ended up forming almost a base. It was still really really good if anyone was thinking about adding chocolate chips.

I made this cake for my hubby's 40th b-day and he said it was the best cake he'd ever had! One change I made was to the frosting: I thought it was a little 'flat' tasting, so I added a bit of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and about 1/8 tsp of coffee extract. It may sound like a strange combo, but trust me, it's AMAZING! I also found that the cake was better the next day, especially since I frost my cakes while they are still a bit warm and this makes the frosting melt into the cake a little bit. I did this cake in a bundt pan and it turned out great.

OMG.....this cake is amazing!! It is super moist. I used a Bundt cake pan and had leftover batter...used the leftover batter for jumbo cupcakes. It's perfect without the icing.Baked at 275 for an hour and turned the oven up to 300 for 15 minutes....came out perfectly!  Will definitely make it again!

I tried this today, was very good. I was skeptical about the temp but followed directions, changing only the butter to apple sauce.   Think would half the icing next time as recipe makes alot.

Great, delicious cake but every time I make it, it falls. I think it might be because I can never get the baking time right and I have to open the oven several times. 1 hour at 275 degrees is not even close to being done. Any suggestions?

A nice change to the regular chocolate cake. Not too sweet. Very delicious. My brothers polished this cake off between the two of them in less than a week.

Wow! This cake is AMAZING!!! It melts in your mouth! I did follow the oven to freezer instructions and am thinking I should start always doing this with cakes. Took about 1 1/2 hours or so to cook completely.  I did not frost and it's still so good. Used 4 medium bananas, and substituted sour cream for the buttermilk, as it was all I had. Also added some flax seeds. Yum!

It's all that!  I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe, but I'm sure this one is great too.  I made two 8" rounds and layered them for a birthday cake.  Delicious!

This cake was great.  Followed the recipe but the low temperature and the time didn't work so I had to turn it up to 300 and and bake it for 20 more minutes.  It still turned out moist as the previous raters had said.  I think it would be just fine cooking higher for less time.

Just made this cake (doubled the recipe for a huge birthday cake) and it was PERFECTLY wonderful.  Made just as the recipe directed, lengthened the baking time and cooling time in freezer for the double sheet pan.  It was just fabulous. My new go-to recipe for banana cake.

WOW!  This recipe is a keeper.  I had to bake it in a slightly larger than 9x13 pan, (it's probably a 10x14 glass dish), because there is so much batter, but it cooked up so nicely!  I added 2 tsp of Cinnamon because I love it in banana bread, and it gave the cake a great deeper flavor than it would have had otherwise.  I made one other slight change, and baked it for one hour at 300*, which made it come out perfect!  I will definitely be making this recipe again and again.  My search for the perfect banana cake recipe is over.  My neighbors, who often get to enjoy my baking escapades agree that this recipe is divine.  Thanks CCsick, for the great recipe!

Very, very good.  Not brown at all b/c of the cooking directions; moist.  I slightly over-baked and next time will watch more carefully so that it's totally moist.  I put browned-buttercream frosting on it when still warm...yum!!

I've made this cake a few times, one of which was for my daughter's first birthday, and each time it's a hit. It's super moist, and super delicious. The cream cheese icing suits it perfectly. If you eat it just out of the refrigerator...it's pure heaven.

Delicious.  I was not able to try it because I'd given up sweets for Lent, but other people (who have told me before when something was not up to par) described it as "perfect" and "the best thing you've baked."  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't mash the bananas with lemon juice - I just mashed them when need in order to avoid browning.  I dyed the frosting yellow for a more banana related appearance.

My kids loved this cake!!  It was very moist and delicious.   The only thing different that I did was to add a banana to the icing and increased the amount of powdered sugar until it was icing consistency.

I followed the directions exactly and the cake turned out moist and tasty!  This recipe is definately a keeper!  I did have to bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes though, at the temperature suggested.  The icing made a lot extra, so will freeze remaining for future use.  I will make again!

The BEST BEST BEST banana cake and I can't stress it enough!!!  I get nothing but complements every time I make it.  It is so moist and the cream cheese icing is the perfect addition.  I know the baking and cooling techniques are very unconventional but they work exceptionally well.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I made this exactly as directed.  This was very heavy/dense as stated.  I would use less banana next time. I prefer a lighter more cake-like texture. My co-workers agreed, this was like banana bread not cake. The taste was excellent. I'm not convinced the freezer step was necessary.

I didn't make this myself, but I just ate a piece that my co-worker made and it's fantastic!!!  we were both curious about the low baking temp and freezing method.....as unorthodoxed as it seems, it works!!  I can't wait to make this myself so my hubby can have a piece.

I have made this cake numerous times and every time it comes out perfect.  I make my own buttermilk by pouring three tablespoons lemon juice into a two cup measuring cup and add milk to make 1 1/2 cups buttermilk. I always flavor either buttercream icing or cream cheese icing by adding a small amount of mashed bananas. I put all my cakes directly into the freezer from the oven. It cuts down on crumbs when icing and cakes are much more moist!

I give this 3 stars because it was good but a bit too dense for my liking, I would have liked a bit lighter of a cake.   Also I baked for 20 minutes longer than recipe said and I still think it was undercooked.     The frosting alone however gets 5 stars, it was delicious!

After reading reviews, I changed only the amount of sugar.  3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar.  It was fantastic!!  The less sugar in the cake makes the cream cheese frosting really, really good and not overly sweet.

I have made this cake several times and it never lasts long in my house. My son even requested it for his birthday! The only change I made was to frost it a basic powered suger glaze instead of a heavy cream cheese frosting. So super ammazing!

Yum! This is THE BEST banana cake recipe. It's super easy, and the frosting is perfect. There's just one tiny change that you need to make: DO NOT bake the cake in a 9x13 inch pan. Instead, bake it in a jelly roll pan. The cake is way too thick when baked in a 9x13 inch, and the cake to frosting ratio is better in a jelly roll pan.

This cake came out really great!  Of course, added my own touch.  1/2 the flour was whole wheat, 1/2 the sugar was splenda and I used 3 cups of bananas.  I also didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 1 1/2 cups of regular milk with 1T of white vinegar added to sour it.  That is an old trick my grandma taught me.  I only used 1/2 of the butter called for in the frosting and 1/3 of the sugar was splenda again.  I know it would have been perfect without the changes, but they made it perfect for me:-)  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this cake and was in a hurry so baked it at the traditional temp of 350 for 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly - very moist, great cake.  I also added cocoa (approx. 2 tbl) to the icing for a chocolate cream cheese icing - yummy!  This will become a favorite recipe!

I made this for my Mom's birthday and she absolutely loved it! I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled it to make a layer cake and I topped it with chopped walnuts. It was beautiful and delicious. 60 mins at 275 in my oven was perfect. Thanks for this recipe!

This was awesome!  Followed the directions exactly and put it in the freezer after baking.  My husband thought I was nuts.  It was very moist and wonderful. Only change was I made half the amount frosting and it was plenty. This is a keeper.  Thanks

Yummy!  Had to cook for 40 minutes longer than the recipe states.  Wasn't able to put in the freezer but didn't seem to matter.  Still very good.  Frosting was very good but made quite a thick layer.  Next time will probably halve the frosting.  Thanks for the recipe ccsick.

I was hesitant about trying this recipe, baking at such a low temp and then putting in the freezer, but I am SO glad I did. I didn't alter the recipe at all and it turned out perfect. I took it to a dinner party and "warned" everyone that it was my first time making it, but everyone loved it. I'll definitely make this again!

I am so glad that I tried this cake, as the tip about putting the cake in the freezer after baking is genius.  This makes an incredibly moist cake, but make sure you use over-ripe bananas for the best results.  I've also started using low fat (and even ultra-low fat) cream cheese in the icing to reduce the total fat content a little, and it tastes exactly the same!  I may experiment with some chocolate chips in the future, but this cake is near perfect the way it is.  Oh, and I bake this in a ceramic cake pan, like the kind you'd make lasagna in, and it comes out beautifully.

This cake is so good, I read ingredients and mixed it up like any other cake, I didn't read  the rest of the directions. I baked it in 350 degree oven, frosted it when it was cool and then refrigerated it overnite, sooo good!  I put walnuts on top of the batter and pushed them down with a spoon,    It wasn't until the next day that I noticed I baked and cooled it wrong, next time I will follow ccsick's directions.   Very tasty! Love this cake and frosting!

delicious decadent banana cake... cooked at low temp (took 90 minutes)  put directly in freezer... I cut the frosting recipe in half which is healthier but having a thicker creamy cheese and butter recipe is awesome...Very dense/heavy cake....all in family declared this is a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for my fiance for his birthday and he loved it! Also, I added crushed walnuts on top. It takes a little bit of work, but it is very easy and worth every minute!

Since this is more aptly called banana bread with frosting in my book, I am rating this against other banana breads, not cakes.  Although this really is delicious, I would not make it again exactly the same.  I believe it may be the greasiest banana bread I've ever had.  I suspect the excess grease helps it seem extra moist, in addition to the lower temperature cooking. This recipe has plenty of naughty ingredients, but somehow they aren't showcased quite as well as in a more conventional cake.  Perhaps the excess oil makes the sugar and banana flavor less powerful.  If I make this bread again, will probably just cut the grease way down, then it will be fantastic bread!  If this were simply titled 'Banana Bread VI', I'd give it 4 stars.

This cake was WONDERFUL!  I followed the cooking temp as directed - had to bake about 10 mins longer but afterwards put the hot cake directly in the freezer - it turned out beautiflly!  Thanks so much for sharing!

My family loved this cake!!  I followed the recipe to a T, but used a different recipe for the frosring due to not having cream cheese on hand.  I used the banana butter icing.  Took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook.  Totally worth the wait!!  I will make this cake over and over again!!

Excellent, moist and delicious.  At first my husband said he didn't want a piece.  Then he tasted a piece of mine and he had to have his own gigantic piece.  I did not change anything.  It took exactly an hour to bake.  Thanks for the recipe!

If there were 10 stars, I still would have rated this an 11! Could be one of the best cakes I have ever had. Still insanely moist after 4 days! Company raved - thank you for the awesome recipe.

Really good and really moist. I didnt have buttermilk so I made my own (milk and vinegar), I also used 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar and used 2 rounds rather than the big sheet pan. It was SO tasty. I used the cream cheese frosting and will absolutely make this one again. YUM

This was absolutely awesome.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used plain lowfat yogurt and it came out great.  I did have to bake it about 15 min longer than called for.  I used a Dream Whip frosting as I didn't have any cream cheese...yum.  I was looking for a banana cake for my son's first birthday and this is IT!

This is a delicious, but very heavy/dense cake; very moist (almost gooey, I swear- it was cooked all the way!). Rave reviews all around the office (I made it for a birthday into a layer cake drizzled with caramel). I had to extend the frosting a bit and I put sliced bananas in between the layers.

This cake is fantastic! The unusual cooking method made those little rebellious hairs on the back of my neck stand up, but I decided to yield and give it a go! WOW! Am I glad I did. I made this for my daughters birthday cake and there was nothing left! The only thing I did different was to bake it in 2 9" rounds. I wanted a 'pretty' cake on a pedestal for her. Because of this I had to adjust the cooking time. Also if you do it this way, put a cookie sheet under your pans as it will spill over a bit. I think next time I will use 3 pans and make it really "pretty" :) I am going to make it for Sunday brunch we are having this weekend.

I LOVE this cake! I have been making banana cake for many years and I have a recipe that is very similar to this one. Cooking it at a low temp and putting it in the freezers..makes it turn out WONDERFUL..How well does this process work on other types of cakes??

OMG! This has in fact been the best cake I have ever eaten! I think it's because we use buttermilk in this recipe & also baking it at a very low temp; it tastes better the next day. I happened to use plantains instead of bananas as I didn't have it with me the first time & also I didn't care to go for the frosting instead dropped a handful of walnuts into the cake mixture before placing the pan into the oven. It tasted simply awesome. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

My husband really liked this recipe even though he doesn't like bananas too much. Added 1/2 cup less sugar because bananas are sweet already and still tasted great. Very moist and creamy.

ok..i followed the recipe exactly..i just added 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg..made a huge difference in the taste..the only thing is that i didn't have room in my freezer..so i put it in the fridge instead..turned out very moist..and delicious..one thing though..i would advise that you make HALF of the cream cheese frosting..as it is too much..i only could use half of it..and had to put the other half in fridge..next time i wont frost the cake..it's just too sweet..but thank you for this lovely recipe..Rana

This cake was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it.  I made several changes: I used 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting; it was plenty sweet.I baked the cake for 5 more minutes than called for because my toothpick test was a tad runny; an additional 5 minutes was perfect at that point.  Finally, I did not freeze it; I felt it was an unnecessary step, and my cake was very moist without it.  Definitely a keeper, thanks so much for sharing!!

Wow! This is a moist, fantastic cake recipe. I am in my kitchen alot baking, always looking for a new, good recipe. This one hits the mark. I live above Denver in the mountains, so it can be tricky for me to bake. I did use a 300 oven and the cake was done perfectly just under one hour. I will take this to work and they will gobble it up! Thanks...

I made this cake for Easter and had some problems with it...took much longer to bake and it over-flowed in my oven.  However, it was a hit!  My family and husband loved it.  My husband states it is his new favorite cake.  The frosting was easy and tasty.  I will bake this again and hopefully not have it overflow while baking. :)

I heated the oven to 350 F and made this into cupcakes! They turned out beautifully! I filled the muffin cups 3/4 of the way to the top and only had one that spilled over. Tastes delicious too, very moist.

This was very good and very moist, I have made other babana cakes and this has to be the best, it's so fluffy not like ordinary banana cakes the feel heavy and think.  Will be baking this again.

This was a great cake!  I was worried because it weighed about 500 lbs but it didn't taste heavy.  Just delicious if you like banana.  I omitted the lemon juice and it didn't seem to matter.  I also sifted the flour before measuring.

Very good banana cake. I made it for a family birthday and there wasn't a single slice left over. I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe instead of this one, and it was fantastic.

I made this cake for a "Game Night" with some neighbors....most men just eat whatever you put in front of them without a comment, but the oooh's, aaaah's and mmmm's were much louder for this cake than the game they were watching.  The next day the wives of these fellas (3) all called for the recipe!!!  It is so moist, not too sweet, and just soooo good.  I followed the recipe exactly, no problem....kinda weird to put in freezer, but did and boy were we all happy.  I've made it several times since!

Okay, what is the big deal with this cake I ask of you?! For the amount of work involved with this cake, I would expect it to be spectacular but it was not. My cake was nowhere done after a hour so I turned DOWN the heat to 250 for another 15 minutes. So it basically tasted like banana bread with unimpressive cream cheese frosting on top. The next time you've got ripe bananas around skip this recipe, and make the Banana Sour Cream Bread recipe instead.

This cake is moist, delicious and one that will stay in my recipe box.  It took me 1 1/2 hours of cooking time, but my bananas were extra ripe (ok, they were totally black).  Awesome cake!

I just made this recipe for a church pot luck, and if you stick exactly to the recipe it is FANTASTIC!  I always like to make recipes I try out according to the directions because I feel you don't belong reviewing it if you are not making it according to the listed instructions/ingrediants.  I have to admit, I was a little uneasy about the baking directions, but soooo glad I followed them.  I got so many people raving about this cake yesterday!  I will continue to make this whenever my freezer gets to full of banana's.  It is very rich so it goes GREAT with a big mug of coffee, good for a ladies Bible study treat:)  Enjoy...and don't change a thing!  Thanks for the exceptional recipe that I will continue to make time and time again.

I wanted to say that I have been using this banana cake recipe since I discovered it about 3 or 4 years ago on allrecipes.I have never changed nor have I ever altered this recipe not even with changing the oven temperature and yes I even take it out of the oven when finished and put it in my freezer lol.My friends and family absolutely rave about this cake, it really is the best banana cake recipe ever.  Thank you Cindy :).

Followed cake recipe exactly. Next time I will cut the sugar a little bit. I didn't use all the sugar in the icing either -- it would've ended up way too sweet with it. I did add a little bit of cinnamon into the icing and it was even more delicious. I wasn't impressed with the cake the first day. It didn't seem to have a good banana flavor (and I used really ripe bananas). It tasted much better (and like bananas) the next day!

Followed the recipe as written and the cake turned out wonderfully moist and flavorful! Just trust the info contained in the recipe and it will turn out fine.  Occasionally I make chocolate frosting for it, and also peanut butter.  Both are equally fantastic.  Thank you ccsick!

I have to say that the baking time on this cake is off.  I put it in the oven at 250 over 2 hours ago, and it still isn't done.  I took it out after one hour, and it wasn't close to being done.  I have put it in now at 350 and while the top is getting too done, the inside is still raw.  I can't even say how it tastes because it isn't done yet.  I am not sure it will ever be eaten if the top burns and the inside is raw.  The frosting turned out very well, though, and it tastes wonderful.

My family really enjoyed this cake but didn't like the icing, it was too sweet for our taste. For the cake I only added 2 cups of sugar, milk instead of buttermilk and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the batter. I cooked it at 350F for 45 minutes and then chilled it in the freezer. It made a very large cake and was very good. The only thing I would  change is to double the amount of bananas. 

Tip: for a tastier recipe use overripe bananas.

This cake is fantastic. I use the basic recipe over and over, but alter the flavors. I made this for my husband's birthday, adding coconut, walnuts, and chocolate chunks. I used chocolate frosting and he nearly at the whole thing himself. I also made a chocolate version for my mother-in-laws birthday, and am making the original version for my son today. With my over, I have to raise the temp to 290 and bake for 1 hour, 30 minutes. I also have a problem getting the cake out of the pan without it breaking. The first time the break was easy to cover up, but last time it broke in half horizontally. Today I used a round cake pan and hope that this helps. Also, don't put it in the freezer before you take it out of the pan. You'll never get it out. Over all, exceptional flavor, moisture, and texture. This is definitely the cake to make!

This cake was amazing! I followed it exactly except for one thing. My buttermilk had gone bad so I used half & half. Don't know what the difference would have been, but it tasted delicious regardless. Some cake consumer comments I had at the dinner table- "This is the best cake I have ever had." "This cake could make money." "I feel like I need a cigarette after eating that." Soooo yeah...It was good. We are even cutting out a holiday dessert or two and making this cake instead for Christmas dinner. YUMMY!

This cake is out of this world! The cake is very moist and delicious, but it caved in the middle after placing it directly in the freezer. Fortunately, I was able to push down on the sides to somewhat even it up. A toothpick in the middle came out clean, but maybe it needed a few more minutes in the oven to really set the middle? The icing was a little too cream cheese flavored for my taste. Next time I will cut back on the cream cheese and butter (the same amount for both) and then add the original amount of confectioner's sugar. It also makes A LOT of icing. I think the flavor of the cake is so wonderful that you can easily only use half of the icing. I will definately make this again!

This recipe was awesome! I think in the future I would use less sugar in the frosting, just because it was kind of sweet for my taste. Other than that, it was perfect! The cake nearly crumbled because it was so soft. Loved it!

Excellent.  This cake was so moist.  I made it a week ahead and left it in the freezer.  I defrosted it the night before by letting it sit on the counter over night.  Fantastic flavor but the best part was how moist it was.  The only change I made was to use Keifir instead of buttermilk (it was all I had onhand).

This is a great cake.  I don't change a thing except leave the nuts off the top of one end for my hubby who does not like nuts in his desserts. Very ripe bananas provide the best flavor. I do refigerate to store because of the cream cheese icing. Best to eat at room temperature. I also like many other reviewers bake this cake @ 350 degrees for approx 1hr 15 -20 minutes or until a tooothpick inserted comes out clean.

This really is the best banana cake that I have ever made -- or ever had!  It was super moist and yet not heavy.  I kept it refrigerated.  My family agreed that it was even better on the second day.  It did take 1 hour and 20 minutes to bake.  Also, I cut the icing directions in half (added a little bit extra cream cheese) and had plenty of icing.  

I see think this will be one of those recipes that gets past down through the family -- it is that good!

Have no fear of the cake melting other things in the freezer..ever since I found this recipe, I put all my cakes directly into my upright freezer when it comes out of the oven.  I put pot holders on the shelf to be sure it doesn't burn them.

Cake is out of this world delicious.

ENJOY!!

I am not exaggerating when I say this is hands-down the best banana cake I have ever had. My husband and I made it for his mom's birthday, and it got rave reviews. The icing was to die for, and the cake was light, fluffy and banana-y, but not bread like at all. It was just incredible, so two thumbs up for this one! I'd make it again in a second!

I have made this cake again and again and it comes out perfect everytime! If I make it as a 2-layer cake, I just bake it for a shorter amount of time. Thanks for this family favorite! **Update - I made this cake for a Dessert War benefitting Big Brothers and Sisters and won! There were over 30 desserts and this fantastic cake took first place. LOVE this cake!

Loved this cake.  The only thing I did different was I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter.  It is yummy.

I made this for the first time today; followed the directions/ingredients exactly and it came out perfectly!  One of the best cakes I've ever had!  I cut the frosting recipe in 1/2 which was more than enough for the top of the cake.  I will make this  recipe every time I have over-ripe bananas!

Thanks for the recipe!  My family & I liked the banana cake.  I followed the recipe, except for the frosting.  I didn't have any cram cheese, so I ended up using an almond white chocolate one instead.  It would have been better with a cream cheese frosting; or perhaps none. I baked it at 275 for 1 1/2 hrs, then turned it up to 300 for 30 min. to brown it and get it done.

Perfect the way it is written! I've made this cake twice now (and will make another one on Sunday). Due to being pressed for time yesterday, I skipped putting the cake into the freezer and left it on my counter to cool while I went off to work for the day and it was still a pretty darned moist cake.  Took the cake to work today and got lots of compliments.  Frosting is delish and not too sweet...I could eat it by the spoonful!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

The cooking time is WAY off.  I may try this again either using multiple smaller pans or a larger shallow pan because this took a whole lot longer than I expected, over 1.5 hours.  Okay flavor, but this needs some adjustments as well..

The cake was kinda chewy and not really moist and soft like I would like.  I might try using more ripe bananas next time because I can't really taste the banana flavor in this one.

I made only one change in this recipe - I used half brown sugar & half granulated sugar.  I always like banana BREAD recipes with brown sugar added so I used that as a standard.  This cake recipe is very fluffy, light - good texture.  It's very sweet with the cream cheese frosting added.  I have a tremendous sweet tooth and can eat spoonfuls of frosting but I even thought that it might be a bit too sweet with the cream cheese frosting on it. (didn't stop me from eating it though!).  It's a tasty cake recipe and it's easy to make.  Oh, I guess I did make one more change - I set the oven at 325 degrees instead of 275.  I've never baked a cake at 275 but that's not to say it wouldn't work - I just felt more comfortable with the 325 setting. One thing about this recipe - it does not rise much at all.  I made cupcakes with it and a sheet pan with it and my cupcakes came just to the top of the paper and I had filled them 2/3 full. It does not dome at all.  It's not the most perfect banana cake recipe but it's certainly tasty.

I made this cake for my son's birthday and we LOVED IT!  Guests asked for the recipe.  Instead of the frosting directed, I used whipped cream and a layer of banana slices between the two  9" round layers.  Fantastic!

This was OK. Like others I thought it tasted like banana bread with frosting. My boyfriend and I agreed it didn't have much flavor - even as banana bread.

Awesome recipe. I am always asked for the recipe when I make this. I think the slow cooking temp (myself I cook at 325) and the freezer contribute to the moist cake.I also often substitute some of the white sugar for brown. The icing recipe is great you could half and still have enough. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for my son's birthday. It was very good and moist. I wasn't sure about putting it straight in the freezer from the oven but did it anyway. This recipe is a keeper!! The only change I made was I only added 2 cups of sugar instead of the 2 1/8 cups that it called for. The next time I make this I will cut the frosting recipe in half as I threw more than half of it away. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!! It's wonderful!

I thought the cake was only pretty good but everyone else loved it and said it was the best. I thought it was a little bland (even after adding extra vanilla and cinnamon) and kind of dry. I think that putting it in the freezer may have actually dried it out rather than keeping it moist. The icing was a big hit, too. I think I'll keep experimenting with it, though, and try to amp up the flavors.

A really nice Banana Cake, taste like banana bread but does well as a cake. If anyone has the problem I did where they fill there 9x13 pan and it seems a bit try to do 2 8x8's if possible. I put all of it in a 9x13 and the cake batter started coming out the side of the pan. The frosting is sooooo easy and wonderful, will definetely use for my other cakes as well. I added chopped pecans on the cake and it tasted really good! I didnt put the cake in the freezer either and it was still very moist.

This was a nice cake in terms of flavor, but texture was a little different than I had expected. It was very dense, and the cooking time was much longer than one hour at 275. Guests enjoyed it, and I would probably make it again.

I make sweets for our management "clique" at work and I'm always probing them for new ideas/combinations/suggestions. Part of the reason I made this was b/c someone wanted me to come up with a banana cake with peanut butter frosting. I wasn't really impressed with the flavor of this cake but it didn't last an hour around my coworker's who thought it was awesome. I did top it with the fluffy peanut butter frosting from this site. I have to say, it was very different! Honestly, I've never had banana cake or the combination of banana/peanut butter so the only thing I have to compare it to is my banana bread. Just wasn't as good. 4 stars since everyone else liked it though!

OKay, the taste is great and the frosting is superb! I'm not sure if there was a personal error on my part but it was VERY dense and took more like 2 hours to cook all the way through. I am kind of a freak when it comes to things like this so I will be making again and again until I perfect it! I might try putting it in a bar pan instead of the 9x13 to try to even out the baking process. Maybe it will give it a little more of a cake texture too. I followed the recipe as is and didn't make any changes (I think..lol).

This cake is awesome.  The best banana cake I've ever had.  I topped it with Cool Whip to make it easier.

I don't know how anyone could say this cake was flavorless or had a banana bread consistancy.  It was the MOISTEST, softest, yummiest banana cake I've honestly ever had.  I, too, had to cook it for an additional 10 min. as it was still jiggly in the middle.  I only had canned milk, but will make the effort to get the buttermilk next time as I think it would be better.  I also did not have the lemon juice and just added the bananas to the sugar/butter/egg mixture since they were the almost black bananas and were really soft.  Regardless, this cake will be on my list to make often.  It was a hit!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome recipe (with a few tweaks)!  Used 3 medium blackened, overipe bananas that would have been thrown away otherwise.  After reading the reviews, I decreased sugar to 1.5 cups, used self-rising flour, added a handful of chopped walnuts, and cooked in a bundt pan (to avoid an undercooked middle).  Baked for 1.5 hours.  Did not put in freezer since our freezer was full and the cake was still very moist.   Cake does have a slight banana bread consistency but is more cakelike than other recipes I've tried.  Did not make frosting and the kids still loved it. Definitely is replacing my former fav banana cake recipe!

Cake was good, but it was more like a banana bread than a cake. It also didn't have much flavor to it. I would have rated it 3 stars, but the frosting boosted the flavor of the dish.

This cake was very good, but I think I want something with a little spice to it - like a Banana Spice Cake. The frosting was so yummy and the cake was very moist.

This cake was absolutely wonderful and I followed the recipe to the letter.  The only thing I did different was to bake it an additional 20 minutes as did many other people.  I have never put a cake directly in the freezer, but did that, and it was wonderful too!  I will definitely make this cake again.  This would be great to take to a Potluck!

I thought this recipe was quite good, but not great.  I think it tastes like banana bread (though with a more cake like texture) with cream cheese frosting.  If that combination sounds like a good one to you, then give it a try.  I had to cook the cake at least 1 1/2 hours and was concerned it would be dry around the edges but after the trip to the freezer it was still very moist.

This is delicious.  Very tasty, very moist.  I added 1 cup chopped walnuts to the batter and sprinkled more over the icing.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  Oh, it did take longer than 1 hr. to bake -- maybe an additional 20 mins.

This cake was excellent. Very moist, which was important to me. I used the milk/lemon juice substitue for buttermilk and cooked in a 9x13 glass pan at 325 for 45 minutes. I did not do the freezing step (I don't think it was necessary). I used a topping my mom used to make: Melted butter with brown sugar, chopped nuts and coconut. Yum!

Similar to banana bread but more moist and dense. Very very nice flavor and the icing is great with it. As some of the other reviewers said, 1 hour is not long enough. 1 hour and 20 min is perfect. I followed everything else to a tee except I didn't have buttermilk and did the milk/lemon juice thing. I will make this again! Thank u for the recipe...

Used less sugar than the recipe called for (half a cup each white and brown, and cut it down to taste in icing) but this cake was heavenly. Lasted for days in the fridge and was a wonderful, mild dessert!

I 'tweeked' this a bit.  Used 2 c. sugar, and 1 1/2 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder.  Only used 1 cup buttermilk, omitted lemon juice.  
Baked in a Bundt Pan for about an hour.  Instead of freezing cake as suggested I left the cake on a cooling rack and left the pan on top overnight (this is the way I do all of my cakes and it does keep them moist) I added a dash of salt to the frosting and it was perfect amount for the bundt cake.  This freezes well and travels well also.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans.  Our family really does enjoy this whether you call it "cake or bread" really doesn't matter.  It is moist and very tasty.

The cake was as awesome as people said it was. 
   I didn't have a 9x13 pan available, so I made it in three 8 inch round cake pans. Fabulous.  The freezer thing really worked. 
  By the way, mine came out fine after just one hour in the oven at 275. Maybe because it was separated into three pans?  Anyway, definitely this is a keeper!

This was the best banana cake ever...I ate way too much!  I did use quarter of the frosting though and it was plenty.  It doesn't have a ton of banana flavor so maybe nextime I will add a little banana flavoring.  I followed the directions and baked for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  Perfect!

I made this cake yesterday- I didnt have any buttermilk, but used regular milk with a bit of lemon juice.  This is a really great cake, that actually tastes like bananas instead of the boxed mixes.  Very moist and yummy!

This cake is so moist and delicious.  I did not alter the recipe at all nor the baking instructions and it was perfect.  My co-workers all wanted the recipe.

I used slightly more banana in this than stated (not to be transgressive or anything, I just don't have metric bananas), a little less sugar and some spices.  The recipe was nice--moist, not too heavy, and well-flavoured--but not stunningly fantastic.

This is a huge hit with my family! I really love the moistness of this cake and the cream cheese icing is too die for! A great way to use up the overripe bananas. I do find that I have to bake it a little longer than directed.

This cake is great!  I save all my over ripe bananas in the freezer and when its time to make this cake, I'm all set. I make it and cut it up and freeze it in individual servings.  When my sweet tooth kicks in, I'm all set! A family favorite.

This cake is fantastic. Does not need any icing at all. A tad sweet, but that is different for everyone. I made 1 1/3 servings, so I baked mine in 1 9" x 13" pan and 1 8" square pan. The one in the square pan baked up fluffier and more cake like. Thank you so much for sharing this one. Loved it.

This is the best banana cake I've ever had, easily.  I also added some chopped walnuts.  We keep it in the frig and only take it out right before we eat it.  Delicious!

This was an awesome banana cake!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe (except bake it about 30 minutes longer) and yes, 275 degrees is correct. Just keep checking it after an hour with a toothpick.  It came out perfect, very delicious and a huge hit with my husband, my best friend and her 5 kids.  Thanks for the recipe Cindy.

This was an awesome cake. After reading all the reviews I followed Cindy's recipe and the cake was done right on time. My grandchildren helped and we could hardly wait to take our first bite. I did use a glass dish to bake the cake, maybe that helped bake it bake in the 60 minutes. Thanks for a great cake!!

AMAZING CAKE I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!! Very time consuming but SOOOO worth it. I only used 1 1/2C of confect. sugar in frosting. 3 was too sweet. The frosting brings all the flavors of the cake together.

This did NOT work for me, the problem is maybe that I made some substitutions. I used whole wheat flour instead of white, Splenda instead of sugar, and I had to use a different pan because I didn't have the propper sized one. Well, the cake turned out quite awful. It was dense as a brick, not light and fluffy at all. The flavour was good but it tasted underbaked, even though I extended the time. I think I was looking for a different consistency, I wanted a banana sponge cake type of cake. The only redeeming factor was the most excellent icing, which I will use again. The banana cake I will NOT make again.

I am just in the process of making this cake.  How the heck is anyone supposed to put a 9 x 13 pan in a freezer?  First of all, those of us with side by side fridges would be hard pressed. Secondly, a 275 degree cake and dish, right into a freezer?    I took the cake out of the dish, wrapped it in foil, and stuck it in the freezer.  That in itself was an undertaking, getting it out of the pan.  This cake better be fabulous!

If I could give this cake more stars, then I would. It is absolutely wonderful! The frosting alone is enough for 5 stars. I could eat this cake every day. I think that the chopped walnuts on top add so much to this recipe- and I usually shy away from adding nuts to my baked goods. You will love this cake!!

I have a small restaurant (seats 48). I make 2 of these a week and I still can't keep enough on hand. Absolutely the best. I make a butter cream frosting and add banana flaoving to it and then drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the frosting for a beautiful presentation.

EXCELLENT!  Thanks for posting where I could find it again, Cindy!  I made this cake for my daughters birthday one year and it was a HUGE hit!  I used sour cream in place of the buttermilk.  This cake is very moist with a wonderful banana flavor!  Best of all, I always have the ingredients on hand!

WATCH THE OVEN TEMP!!!!

I have made this recipe before and is was fabulous, however I printed up the recipe today and baked it as directed and it was still raw batter inside! I wondered about the 275 degree temp stated in the recipe and bumped it up to 290 just incase. I baked it as directed for an hour, I just checked it and found it doughy and increased the temp to 375 hopefully in another 30 minutes it will be done. As I stated I have tried this same recipe before and loved it, I just don't remember the temp being so low.

Very moist cake.  I found the cream cheese icing way too sweet so I added half of the sugar.  Even that was a touch too sweet.  Next time I'll double the cream cheese and half the sugar.  You can never have to much cream cheese icing.  The cake itself was fabulous.

High reviews when I brought this to a church function.  And this was after I forgot that it was in the oven and it baked for 15 minutes longer than stated.  It still turned out very good.

Absolutely delicious and very moist.  I made it for dessert when I had my in-laws over for dinner.  They all wanted the recipe.  As one baker suggested, you can cut the icing recipe in half.  There is plenty to ice a 9x13 cake.  Also, I chopped up walnuts and sprinkled them on top of the iced cake.

This recipe was SO-SO for me. 3.5 stars! I've made it twice now and both times I'm just not that excited about it, which is disappointing because I love banana stuff! Sorry! Must just be my taste buds! It is a very moist, although dense cake. Frosting is nice.

This cake was excellent. I followed the website directions exactly and it turned out great, besides falling a bit. I live at high altitude and maybe I should have turned the oven up just a bit. My husband loved it, as well as everyone at a party I took it to. I will definitely be making it again.

This cake is absolutely sinful (check the ingredients!), but everyone who ever had a piece really loved it.  For all the good comments (and my own appreciation), this is definately a keeper.

This cake was delicious! It turned out wonderfully. I made it the night before before we ate it, and I kept it in the refrigerator during the night. It was so moist and tasty the next day! I frosted the cake the night before and everything turned out perfect!

Excellent flavor.  Especially liked the cream cheese frosting.  Will use this frosting for other recipes.  I baked at 350 degrees for about an hour and did not put in the freezer.  It was very moist and got many compliments.  I sprinkled chopped walnuts over the frosting.

Can't I give this 6 stars?  Please?  WOW!  This is THE BEST cake I've ever made and served.  Everyone raved, and there's nothing left!  Geez, I've never been so happy that, in my house, the bananas don't get eaten.  C'mon over-ripe bananas!  Excellent.  I did add 2 tsp. of cinnamon to the batter, but otherwise kept to the recipe as stated.  I sprinkled mini-chocolate chips on top of the frosting.

Very, very tasty.  A heavier cake than you would think - the batter was pretty runny.  I used 4 small very ripe bananas, added 2 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon & approximately a half cup of chopped nuts before baking.  I found the baking time to be right.  I will make this many times.

This is a wonderful recipe. The cake if made correctly as stated in the recipe on the website and not the cookbook is so moist and wonderful. I received the Top Rated All Recipes cookbook and was delighted to see that this recipe was in the book. I made the recipe as per the cookbook and it was dry and not as good. So, follow these instructions and it will be a wonderful, moist, crowd pleasing cake.

This is a very delicious banana cake. I didn't use the frosting, however, but used Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. I was stressed out with the long baking time, the cake fell in the middle. If I make again I will change the temperature and time. I did put it in the freezer afterwards. I upped the bananas to 1 3/4 cup, it tasted great. I will make again. Thanks for sharing.

All I can say is WOW.  The comments regarding baking temp. may have something to do with elevation.  I'm at 3500 ft. and the 275 oF worked great for 1 hr. 15 min.  Half the icing recipie was perfect.  This will become a family favorite and I would like to try it for muffins.

Yum!  I baked it at 275 and it did indeed take longer to bake maybe next time I'll bake it at 375, I just hope it turns out the same!  I stuck it in the freezer after baking.  My guests just loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe by far is the absolute BEST banana cake you can ever have/make.  It's so simple to make, people will think you're the best cook ever!  I found that it made a lot of frosting, I only put a thin layer on the cake and left the rest on the side for people to add as they like, it's very very moist, DELICIOUS, I've made it about 4 or 5 times now and everyone keeps asking for it.

"This is great!"  That is what EVERYBODY said about this cake.  I though is was good and simple.  I did not measure the mashed bananas, I eyeballed it and think I put in a little too much.  I did however measure everything else.  Each piece of cake weighed about 5lbs - but every person who ate it loved it!

I made this for a dessert to take to Thanksgiving Dinner.  Was worried at first as everybody mostly went for the Pumpkin Pie, the Pumpkin muffins and Pumpkin rolls, but was later delightfully surprised as everyone started talking about it.  I kept cake refrigerated, and served as a cold dessert.  Was rich, and the texture was smooth.  In my opinion, I thought the banana taste was very slight, but others thought it was just right.  I will definitely make again, and again...

This was wonderful. I made it first for my husband's office potluck, then again for teenage daughters bake sale. I have had so many requests for the recipe, I can't keep up. This was moist and flavorful. I confess that I didn't take the time to put it in the freezer either, and frankly it didn't stay around long enough to season in the friq either. Will make this again many times. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box.

This was the best banana cake recipe I've ever tried.  I first made it for Thanksgiving 2001 and it's been one of my favorites since.  I get so many compliments on this cake and lots of people ask me for the recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing about the frosting... It seems to work well for me!  So yummy!

Really delicious and easy recipe!  Makes a lot of frosting, though;  you could probably halve the recipe for the frosting and still have plenty of it.

I made this for both of my daughters' bdays this year.  It was loved by everyone.  It came out very moist and full of flavor.  Cream cheese frosting was a big hit also and easy to work with.

This has to be the absolutely best banana cake recipe I have ever used!
It is delicious even without the frosting! I am getting requests for it all the time now!

This is the first time I ever made a cake from scratch.  Usually it's just a box recipe.  My sister said it was better than my uncle's banana cake (and he's a baker).  My husband is eating a piece right now and says "it's delicious."  Thanks for the recipe.

My co-workers are scarfing down the last of it as I type this review. I cut the amount of confectioner's sugar in the frosting - I'm not crazy about very sweet frostings. Great recipe!

Wonderful Recipe! 
Try adding a few chopped walnuts or pecans for a wonderful additional texture

This cake was UNBELIEVABLE!!  I made it for dessert on Christmas Day and there was not one crumb left!  I love anything banana, and I especially loved this cake because it didn't have nuts:)  I know I will be asked to make this cake again and again.
