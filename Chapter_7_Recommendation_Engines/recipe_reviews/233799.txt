Let me begin by saying that I am not a big fan of slow cooker ribs, but I gave this a try. Even though I didn't absolutely love it, I liked the taste and the ease of this recipe. I could only find Chipolte Chili Powder and not Chipolte Seasoning, which I am sure has more to it than just Chipolte peppers. I made the sauce using one teaspoon of the chipolte chili powder and tasted it before adding the regular chili powder. I felt the there was enough heat and smokiness from the chipolte, that I did not add the additional chili powder. If you like more kick in your sauce add the regular chili powder. I used St. Louis style ribs and cooked for 8 hours (my pot runs hot). Good summertime recipe that doesn't heat up the house. I would make again because of the simplicity of this recipe.

I made it in the slow cooker, however not having all of the called for sauce ingredients I improvised by adding 1/2 bottle of Sweet Baby Rays Honey Bar-B-Que sauce mixed with 2 cups of water. Coated the ribs well and cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours. Removed from the sauce and placed on a tin foil lined baking sheet pan and into a 375 degree oven, after mopping with remaining 1/2 bottle of Bar-B-Que sauce, for aprox., 30 minutes.  Came out tasting wonderful, flavorful and tender. Sure beats firing up the grill!

The ribs were fall off the bone tender but the sauce was too bland.
We dipped it in Sweet Baby Ray's. I will try a different BBQ recipe from this site. Will not make this again.

The best crock pot ribs I have ever made!  The entire family loved it and we could not stop eating them.  They were perfect for  an all day college football Saturday.  Thanks for sharing.

Didn't care for the cottail sauce on it...they were tender but I would have thought the fat would be gone and after 8 hours, it wasn't...put Sweet Baby Ray's on it and much better.

This is a super easy recipe and is so delicious!  I may try smoking the ribs for an hour before placing them in the slow cooker.

This was SO delicious and the ribs were tender and fell off the bone! Such an easy way to get supper going while we were out by the pool! I used green onions since I didnâ€™t have any yellow onion and used red wine vinegar...but otherwise followed the recipe. Very much recommend this recipe!

Pretty darn good. I followed the recipe as written. I used hot honey as that is what I had on hand. I think the hot honey gave it an extra kick which worked well. Plenty of sauce but I may have had a little less than three racks of ribs. I cooked them for 4 hrs on high and the meat was fall off the bone and quite tasty. Will definitely make again. Have plenty of leftovers for pork sliders tomorrow.
