This recipe, and I made exactly as stated, needs some work.  What I ended up with was the puckering taste of lime to end all limes (granted, I juiced those limes well, as I used to work in a southwest Mexican/Mediterranian restaurant as a prepcook).  It's a good start, just needs some tweaking.  I would at least double or triple the amount of ginger and garlic called for.  It had 0 heat even with four jalapeno bodies (maybe he meant to use ceranos but, it's not stated), so add the seeds too. I noticed when I was making this that there is no salt or pepper and thought that was a little odd.  Add a couple tsp of salt at least and maybe a few cracks of pepper.  It's a good base, but really with the zest of four limes AND all their juice, they overpowered the amount of the rest of ingredients included in the recipe and all I got was a bitter lime taste.  Also, could try adding some sugar as well.  Help cut the extreme bitterness of the lime.   That's my 2c anyway.  Thanks for the recipe.  (btw, i tried to remedy by sprinkling salt, cracked pepper, and cumin over skewers the second day, it helped).

I tried this recipe for a birthday party in March, and it was a huge hit.  The only change I made was to add about 2 oz of rum in order to thin out the marinade a bit.  I only had time to marinate the prawns for 2 hours, but they were great, and I've served them twice since.

We really enjoyed this. The lime and spice level were just right (I left the seeds in half of the jalapenos). I learned somewhere along the way that a citrus marinade essentially cooks seafood if left too long (and 4 hours would be considered too long), so I marinated the shrimp for about a half hour, and it absorbed the flavor perfectly without sacrificing texture. I sliced some extra onion and grilled it with the shrimp in a grill pan until it was nice and caramelized--yum! This was easy to prepare and went very well with Sweet and Sassy Vanilla Slaw, also from this site.

I rarely eat fish and I passed on this but my partner loved it.  I made it exactly as directed.  I also made him Citrus Swordfish With Citrus Salsa (on this site) the other night.  He said it was a real treat to have the fish and said both were of restaurant quality.

My shrimp must have been in the marinade for too long, they were tough.  I really was not pleased with this recipe at all.

Made this for the 4th of July -- just as written.  It turned out wonderful and was gone before everything else.  Contrary to what some have said it's the perfect amount of spice (not too much and not too little), I would only cut out some of the chile peppers if you are sensitive to spicy foods.  I will probably make it everytime I grill.

Followed this to the T aside from I had no more green chillies so had to use 1 green and 1 red as a substitute.  On the whole was disappointed with a high star recipe.  It was too sour and the the prawns turned out a poor texture, even though I marinaded it for 2.5 hrs only.  Th eonly pro was that the marinade did surprisingly impart alot of flavour abeit sour.  Would not try this again.

Very good! I didn't process the marinate. I put everything into a large plastic bag and let sit for 2-3 hours.

These were a huge hit at our last cookout - and I'm about to cook them again.  Great flavor with the heat from the chiles and the sweet heat of the ginger.  Excellent!

I was concerned about marinating with the lime juice, and I was right.  It partially cooked the shrimp (ceviche), and the texture was "lacking" after they were grilled.  We used 1 pound of shrimp (not sure how much 48 prawns weigh), and used one lime.

This is a party pleaser. You have to play with the recipe a bit to get it right. the calculator on this site doesn't really work if you put in a large number. You'll end up buying way too many limes. Over all everyone like them at my party.

Fantastic recipe!  Flavours melded beautifully, marinade became a coating that stuck to the prawns when grilled.  Delicious!

My kids found it a little spicey.  I recommend toning it down on the peppers-maybe finding a really mild pepper.  They also wanted a dipping sauce so I melted some butter for them.

Liked it but the pepper gave it a weird taste. I used a Serrano. The lime did not bother me at all. I am going to try it without the pepper and try either curry or honey next time.

We really like limes and shrimp but the whole family really hated the taste of these shrimp.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used only 3 limes.  Still the bitter lime taste overpowered everything.  I couldn't tell that there was any ginger, garlic, onions, or peppers in it. The recipe sounded so good but tasted so bad.

I am giving this 3 stars because the recipe overall lacked something.  Also, I marinated this for only 3 hrs and the prawns were totally tough.  With tweaking (suggestions in other reviews sounded good to me) this recipe could be good but as it is...it only gets 3 stars from me.  Sorry.

I used chili powder instead of fresh chile peppers because that's all I had. It was probably less spicy that way but we really enjoyed this way to marinade shrimps. I wouldn't let them sit more than 3 hours, though: the lime taste could be a bit too strong.

I served this at a tailgating party last weekend.  I used a mild red pepper instead of green, the shrimp cooked up a very pretty color.  Everyone raved about these, they were snatched up before I could even get them to the plate!

This was fabulous.  I don't even like really spicy food, and i thought it wasn't too spicy, just spicy enough.  

I made a few changes, I used one large jalepeno pepper- I was scaling the recipe down- 1/2 onion, 3 small limes(juice and zest).  I also added a little honey to the mixture to sweeten it up. 

My husband raved!

This was amazing.  I ended up dumping the marinade and the shrimp into a saute pan and cooking them on the stove instead of on the grill.  My son was not happy I only made a half pound of shrimp and wants it again soon.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is tasty and works well even without four hours of marinating.  I added a lot more chillis and it was accordingly hot!

This was a big hit to my mom, who adores spicy food. I just want to say, those who are into spicy, these are very hot! I added some crushed red pepper flakes to the blender along with the chile peppers. The recipie called for 2, and I only used 1, and it still was hot. I made this along with Thai noodles with chicken, also found on this sight, and it made an excellent side dish.

I didn't seed the jalapenos because it's spicier that way.  Be sure to brush more marinade on as the shrimp are cooking to keep them succulent.  Great flavor especially when you have your own limes from your own tree!

This one's a winner!  I added 1 teaspoon of tabasco sauce to the recipe and my whole family loved it!  I served it on a bed of roasted garlic couscous.  Next day, the leftover shrimp were coarsely chopped as a topping on a green salad at lunch.

Loved this-the longer it is marinated, the better the taste.

Wow were these good!  I served it with a side of Hollandaise Sauce, and it went perfectly with the spiciness of the shrimp.

My 10 year old son loved these.  He must have eaten about 30 of them on his own.  They were spicy but that didn't stop him from eating more and more.  I did add a little oil to the blender to get the sauce to mix easily.  I only had about 3 hours to chill before cooking but they still came out great.  A nice change of pace for the family. I served with white rice and salad.

i agree that it needed a pinch of salt, and instead of regular ginger I used chunks of candied ginger so as to cut the tartness of the limes with a little sweetness, but those are just matters of taste.

It sounded really good in theory but I was disappointed in the results. Too tough and not very spicy. I may try it again using some of the suggestions made by other reviewers!
