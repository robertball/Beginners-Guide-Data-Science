Yum!!!  I did what the recipe said to do - I hate it when people rate a recipe after doing "what they want to it first".  Those negative reviews need to be cancelled.  I want featured recipes that are easy and tasty.  I have just recently found the multiple uses for italian dressing and that made this recipe great!!!  The combination here was excellent.... I made sure not to use anything higher than 92% lean though for my burger tends to fall to pieces!!!  Thanks for the submission and I hope others give this recipe a try just like it is!!!  Then rate it!

While the burgers with topping are good, they have been on this website since 2003 according to the reviews.  Please tempt us with something really "new and improved".

This was super yummy!!!  The only thing I did differently was to use a separate pan for the veggies and realized too late that doing it in the same pan would've given them a bit more flavour.  What would make this a five star recipe for me would be to have a nice gravy type sauce to top the veggies with and also, make sure you season the hamburgers otherwise they're a little bland.  I used a little onion and garlic powder but it could've used more for my tatse.  Still a great dish and will be making again for sure.

This is a wonderful hamburger recipe...our family could eat burgers every night! I use only Laura's ground round which also cuts down on the fat. Will make these often.  Thanks.

When I saw 'make thin patties' I thought great - a good stuffed burger recipe. Wrong! I must agree with the review of 'chef d'.
However, if the recipe advised:- saute the onion etc., place a tblspn. of these ingredients on a thin pattie, add a slice of cheese, place 2nd. pattie on top & seal, then put in bun - that would be different, (I think).

This is a good flavor combination. It hardly needs the dressing with all the flavors from the veggies and cheese.  I put the cheese on the burgers and put a lid over them for a minute to melt the cheese, then topped with the veggies. This did remind me of a Philly Cheese Steak.

These were good but I did make a few changes.  I made 4 patties instead of 8.  I also used ranch dressing instead of Italian.

I made these last night and they were great.  We are huge burger fans but get sick of our regular onion/garlic burgers.  Anyway, thanks for the recipe!

Simply delicious, a good way to get more veggies into everyone also.  I had no italian dressing and used Paul Newman Olive Oil/Vinegar instead.  Worked out great til I get to the store!  Try it on good pumpernicle bread.

UMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! I seasoned the burgers with garlic and Lawry's salt and made into patties. Then followed the recipe exactly except I added some BBQ sauce to the bun and skipped the Italian dressing. I loved it!!

Trying to lose a few pounds before the holidays hit, I made these for supper last night and left out the buns.  Was not disappointed.  I find them very good.  Thanks.

Know what?  I thought these were okay, tried beacase they were the recipe of day... and, I followed just as the recipe stated.  Was hoping for more, I guess, they sounded so good.  I am so sorry, just thought they were "okay". Thanks for the recipe anyway! I have to say it was different.  Would love to tweek it a bit!

We did it all on the grill, even the veggies in a cast iron pan. A great tasting burger.

Oh! these were so good! We love it. I had to make a big change as I am vegetarian.......I used used 'Nutrela' from Indian store for soy granules. Used them with one boiled potato and some corn starch and salt & pepper. Made the patties with those. Turned out super. Loved it thanks so much for a great recipe.

These were great. My family doesn't care for mushrooms so we didn't use those but it was still a delicious twist on a burger. Also I seasoned my hamburger patties with seasoning salt and fresh ground black pepper. And I put salt and pepper on the green peppers and onions while cooking them.

Great burgers!  I always season the burgers with some salt and pepper and whatever other seasonings I feel like throwing in that particular night and they always turn out awesome!  Sometimes, I also season or put a little Italian dressing in with the veggies.  Thanks for sharing!

These turned out good. My fiance made them and he couldn't get them thin enough. We used Muenster cheese and didn't use any italian dressing. The mushrooms and onions were perfect. Just like a regular hamburger; very good!
