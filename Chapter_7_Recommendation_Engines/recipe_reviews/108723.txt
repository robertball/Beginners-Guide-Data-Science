I used canned chicken breast and shred it apart because I was too lazy to grill.  I substituted avocado because I didn't have any jicama and I also added chopped red onion.  I just poured all the dressing over it and mixed it together.  This is absolutely delicious and makes a great light and refreshing dinner on a warm day.  I'll be eating this all summer!

I decided to be one of the first to try this recipe out. I made a few changes though. I did not have jicama, so I used an avocado chopped up. I also added a tomato, some chopped red onion, and about 1/2 cup chopped cilantro. The salad part was very good, but the chicken was only ok. I put it all on rice for dinner, and used it in a wrap the next day. I will deffinately make this again maybe using a different recipe for the chicken. The salad is amazing though and my 7 year old ate it two days in a row cleaning her plate. Very good!

This is an excellent salad.  The grilled chicken was so good.  I marinated it overnight because I really wanted it to have a good flavor. The first time I made it I bought jicama and was very disappointed with it.  I left it out the second time.  I added red onion and used a variety of peppers to help with cost.  I made this for a baby shower for 40 women.  I would suggest using half the beans and either use more mango or add pineapple. I even had a little marinade left over for another time.

We loved it! I added a bunch of cilantro, half a cucumber sliced in thin, long strips and (for my husband and I) one whole jalapeno, seeds and all, also sliced in long, thin strips. I really loved the addition of a little heat! I would add thinly sliced red onion if the jalapeno sounds to spicy for you. I served it in onion pita bread and even my son, who never eats salads, loved it!

YUM! This is so good. I fixed it per the recipe, and it is delicious. Next time I make it, and there will be a next time, I think I will marinate the chicken overnight. I will also make more of the marinade/dressing because I thought the lettuce could use a little dressing (but that's just personal taste). I might also marinate the black beans in some of the dressing to give them more of the yummy taste. Thanks for sharing - very good salad recipe!

I thought this was way to sweet. I would've liked to eat the mango by itself.

This recipe was really good, but I have to agree with another reviewer. It definitely could use some cilantro, and I added in an extra splash of lime. Avocado would add a nice touch, also. With these additions, it has just the right flavor, texture, and lightness. Delicious!

This was absolutely delicious!  I did have to make a few changes, left out the black beans because I was out, omitted garlic (due to a guest allergy) and added a dash of dry mustard to the dressing.  I used leftover roasted chicken, marinated in the dressing for a couple of hours in the refrigerator before adding fruit.  Also added diced papaya and mandarin oranges.  Would also be great with either almonds or chopped cashews.  Served with sourdough Wasa bread.  A huge hit!  Will definitely serve again!!!  I also think the dressing would be amazing on a fruit salad.

I loved this...but felt it needed one more little thing...some thinly sliced purple onion. It added a nice color and great flavor. This one is a keeper.

This was amazing. Very fresh and beautiful.  I doubled the dressing and added chopped cilantro. My husband and son wouldn't try it - too colorful and healthy looking for their picky tastes... So I ended up eating it 3 days straight.  The first and second days were equally wonderful, but by the third day things got a little mushy and watery.

I don't normally love salads, especially for dinner, but this was soooo good! I loved every bite. I didn't make any changes - I just left out the jicama. I will definitely be making this again. It's tasty, healthy, and easy to make. What more could you ask for?

I tried and enjoyed this salad and I plan to serve the salad to dinner guests. I will substitute raspberry vinegar and add one more mango because the mango I used was small. The recipe is a nice blend of flavors. I used half the salt.

What a great salad!  I doubled the dressing and forgot the garlic, but I really don't think it needed it.  I probably won't add it next time.  I marinated the chicken for 1 hour, as directed, and I thought it was very flavorful.  I imagine going a little longer would make it even better.  This is very easy to put together but tastes impressive!  Great for company!

This was amazing. I loved how fresh and crunchy it was not to mention satisfying. Instead of chicken I cooked some pork tenderloin on the weber with jerk seasoning. My entire family loved it.

Quite the salad here.  Very bright flavors and the dressing made one heck of a marinade.  My store didn't have jicama, but I used a cucumber because it made sense to me.

I made some changes with this one. As I'm too lazy to clean the complex grill and I don't own one I broiled the chicken breast. I put it in a baking dish and let it broil with the marinade. It came out very well, not dry like I was expecting. This made me quite enjoy my chicken breast so I will definitely be making it again.
