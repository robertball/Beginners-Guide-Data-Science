This dish was very good!  I had most of the ingredients in my pantry and fridge so I searched this recipe using the ingredient search tool.  I'm trying to cook healthy without going too overboard so that my husband doesn't turn his snoot up.  This was very tasty.

Made this for tonight's supper and it was great!  I needed a recipe that would use up the fresh basil, tomatoes, peppers that were bordering on not being usable and this was the ticket!  I used fresh chicken breast, cubed, and cooked in the garlic and basil.  I would suggest if using chicken breast to set it aside after cooking and add it back in and the end of the cooking otherwise it can  get a bit tough.  I probably added a 1/3 more basil and a few more cloves of garlic.  I didn't use canned tomatoes and also added in a half can of leftover tomato soup from the fridge.  Added about double the amount of parmesan cheese too! (yes, got a little carried away).  As to 'refrigerating leftovers'..... there were none :)

I actually found it a bit bland.  I used real tomatoes rather than canned and didn't have the Uncle Ben's rice so used Quinoa.  Maybe the rice would have made a difference but I tend not to buy "prepared" foods.  I was able to rescue it though by adding some salt, pepper, chilies, and cumin.  And a little more cheese never hurt anyone!  I gave it four stars because it is a good starting point and was pretty easy.

We loved it!  I put a little basil in about half way thru cooking, then added the rest at the end as the directions state.  My grocery didn't have the Uncle Ben's rice, so I substituted Knorr's chicken and broccoli rice and it worked fine.  I think I'll try boneless chicken thighs next time.

I did change it because I used what I had on hand. I used Goya yellow rice and broccoli. I accidentally opened a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. This made the "will make again" list. Great for hectic week nights. It was quick, easy and delicious!

I think this is my first time rating, but I thought it was so sad that such an easy and delicious recipe didn't  yet have any reviews.

It was very tasty, quick and easy, and a good way to use left-over chicken.

The changes I made were:
- used left-over chicken
- used 2 tablespoons dried basic
