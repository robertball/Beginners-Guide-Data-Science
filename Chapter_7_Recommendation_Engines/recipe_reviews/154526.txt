I'm Russian myself and we've been making this salad as long as I can remember! Never used prunes though, just boiled beets, walnuts, garlic and mayo. Make sure you chop walnuts coarsely for the best taste! And one more thing : I think you don't need extra salt with all this mayo in the salad.

If you love beets you'll love this little salad.  I made it the first time just to get rid of some fresh beets that I had and didn't want to lose.  Now I buy beets just to make this salad.

Made this yesterday. Wonderful. Authentic Russian salad does not use prunes so omitted them. However, try adding pomegrante seeds to salad. Superb!!!

DELICIOUS. I included some sliced Vidalia onion, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. DEFINITELY in my luncheon rotation; I'll be making this regularly.

Seemed like kind of a strange recipe, but it turned out great! Very easy to make too. Only thing was the garlic seemed a little much--will cut back on the garlic next time.

Truly Wonderful!  Even though I over-processed it in the food processor, it was tasty and crunchy and garlicky and everything that was quoted about it!  I used almonds instead of walnuts because they're better for you, and I would use either plain yogurt or light mayo to help alleviate the "fatty" texture.  REALLY GOOD!  You'll enjoy it!

Not bad.  I omitted the prunes because other reviewers said that was the more authentic route.  It tasted like...beets.  Nice combination, and quite easy.  It was my first time using beets, & peeling & grating them was very easy. This is a vibrantly colored dish, which could be very suitable for entertainment purposes.  My mom liked it; Dad didn't.  I used 3 beets, 2 garlice cloves, and 1/3 cup of the walnuts and 1/3 cup mayonnaise.  Nice mixture.

People who like beets will like this recipe.  I brought it to a Russian pot luck dinner and some people asked for the recipe and said it was great.  I liked it myself!  Colorful and healthy.

I'm an American living in Russia, and folks serve this to me often (without the prunes). However, I had to use another clove of garlic to match the taste of the salad that I often eat in Russian homes. Russians seem to like intense flavors of the food itself (rather than spices) so I'm not surprised they like it more garlicky than Americans may prefer.

Just a note about authenticity. I've been making this salad for years, ever since a Russian friend in Moscow sent it to me, courtesy of his grandparents.  Their recipe (and they're village people) INCLUDES prunes.  I remember this vividly because their recipe was sent in Russian, and directed me to "soak the prunes"--and the root for "to soak" and "to torture" seemed very similar :) to me.  

Anyway, please don't assume the prunes are not authentic.  I imagine some families use them and some don't. But both versions are genuine.  And I love the prune one! :)

This is a very simple recipe (especially if you already have some cooked beets) for which the prunes are a tasty addition. My wife and I liked it a lot.

I had roasted some golden beets and was looking for something different from the usual beet recipe. I thought that combining garlic with beets would be bizarre, but it was delicious! I skipped the prunes (husband not a fan), and used toasted black walnuts. Adding this to the beet repertoire!

I made it according to the recipe : with  prunes,-  just as it  is  traditionally  made in Ukraine.  By skipping the prunes you do miss the smoky - sweet  flavor  they  introduce, which makes this salad so well rounded  and more versatile . Wonder, why it is represented as "authentic Russian," since , according to the Russian reviewers themselves, they don't use prunes in russia. Considering the discrepancy,  the phrase  "authentically Russian" hardly  fits the description.

This is a very nice dish, different but really quite nice.  I have made it twice . Note:  don't over due it with the prunes as they will make it kind of sticky and thick .  I will certainly make it again

Love this. Made exactly as written...well I did use a can of sliced beets (no vinegar). It was just what we were looking for. Great summer salad. Can't wait to put it on my Thanksgiving Menu.

Followed the recipe, and I love it!  I'd much prefer this salad with prunes, authentic or not.  Prunes and garlic are unusual combination but it works surprisingly well.  I usually buy this salad at Brighton Beach, NYC, the mecca of Russian food.  Now I can make it anytime anywhere I want!  Thanks, Irene.

Followed the recipe minus the prunes. I also added the pomegranate which was a great addition to the flavor-fresh and juicy tartness.

I used low cal mayo; Not bad, but I am not sure about mixing prunes(because of their sweetness) and raw garlic. Next time will try with garlic or prunes only..
