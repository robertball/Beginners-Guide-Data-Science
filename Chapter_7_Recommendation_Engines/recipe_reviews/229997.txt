Recipe turned out great. The tangy, citrus sauce really balanced out the dark chocolate. I made this for work group and they enjoyed it!

This turned out great, I did not add the melted chocolate to the top and it was certainly sweet enough without it.  First time ever using phyllo dough or making Baklava.

I would definitely make this again
The orange juice brings a freshness to it and makes it perfect for spring
I did not add the chocolate drizzle and I used pecans and pistasios

I have two major issues with the recipe.  I checked it after 30 minutes and it was almost done, then forgot to recheck. left for 5o, and it was burned.  The  bake time is completely off.

Also, the recipe tells you to put the leftover nuts and chocolate mixture on the top, which makes it look completely different from your picture, and also makes it more difficult to know when it is finished.

it took me a lot longer to make but I am attributing it to that I don't have a  lot of experience working with the phyllo dough.  will try again.
