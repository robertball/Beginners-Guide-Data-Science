This was delicious. For those not familiar with bulgur, it's very similar to rice and can be cooked in the same way. Like rice, you'll want to simmer the bulgur until all the water has evaporated and you're left with a sort of "al dente" texture to the bulgur. Let it sit for a few minutes to cool then stir or "fluff" it up before mixing with the beef/vegetable mixture. I used 2 cups water, 2 beef boullion cubes, 1 onion bullion cube and 1 cup bulgur and it turned out perfectly, not mushy or soupy. The recipe called for 1 cup chopped fresh tomato (bulgur is mostly used for tabouli, a salad which uses fresh finely chopped veggies). I, however, used a well drained can of diced tomato/green chile since this was a ground beef recipe and I didn't happen to have a tomato anyway. I also drained the pan of beef/veggies and let it sit for a few minutes before mixing it with the bulgur. I didn't overcook the diced celery and left it a bit fresh/crispy, omitted the green onion and while it was cooking I seasoned the ground beef with garlic salt, celery salt, Adobo, cayenne pepper, black pepper and a splash of worcestershire. I also sprinkled some cayenne on my finished Kasha for color and kick. One last tip and trust me on this: Let the finished Kasha sit for 10 minutes before eating; it will sort of set up and taste better. Enjoy and try some tabouli next; it's also delicious!

Very filling!  A bit bland... I didn't have beef broth or tomato, so added a can of diced tomatoes, water, and a beef bullion cube.  The broth would have made it tastier.

This is definitely a different taste than I am accustomed to, but it was wonderful.  It's a really welcome change from our normal routine.  I also added some paprika to give it some more kick.  I actually attempted this recipe with my mother-in-law.... and if she gives it the green light... it must be good!!  Thanks.  In the recipe box it goes!!

This dish doesn't have eye appeal and it doesn't have any real seasonings added, but don't let that fool you.  It really has quite a bit of flavor.

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's really good!  Easy to make, too, because I used green onions and celery that I had previously chopped and dehydrated. The only change was that I used chipotle pepper because it's the only hot pepper I had.  I made it a second time, using some leftover cooked rice 1 beef bouillon cube and the small amount of liquid I had drained from the diced tomatoes.  (I didn't add the 2 cups beef broth because the rice was already cooked) Still really good.  This recipe is not only delicious, but versatile!

Oh MY GOODNESS! What a pleasant surprise of tremendous flavor!  My hubby and I are always looking for a new healthy dish and we both loved it.  I did not have any bulger cracked wheat on hand, but I did have some whole wheat in our food storage.  I took one cup of whole wheat, and 2 C water and just blended it in the blender for 2-3 min and it made the perfect cracked wheat texture.  Just pour from blender to stovetop, add some beef bullion and it is enough water to cook the wheat perfectly.  The other adjustment I made was to use 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies (Drain well) instead of fresh.  Delightful!

This was great!  And easy enough for a college kid to make... a nice change from ramen noodles haha.  I used this recipe for a group meeting night and it went over really well, i added a little more pepper b/c im a big fan of spicy foods, and it didnt overpower the overall outcome.

very easy to make, and a nice change to the regular rice or pasta routine. For the broth, I used the broth cube, disolved into 2 cups of boiling water. Tastes delicious. My husband and kids loved it. I would suggest however, to add some tomato paste to enrich it a little bit. And next time, I also will probably fry the meat in either some butter or olive oil, for added flavor and moistness.

While this had the right ingredients, it lacked the spices and the bulgur was still in quite a bit of liquid (which I tried to drain) and the meat mixture had too much liquid from the liquid that comes with the dice tomatoes (which the recipe didn't say to pour off).  I tried fixing the taste later with some black pepper and more cayenne pepper and that helped a little but still only improved this to a three star recipe.

I really liked this recipe, but made a coupple of changes. I added some lemon juice to the meat(I used ground lamb), as well as some dried mint flakes, pine nuts, and kibbeh seasoning. By the way I never cook my burghul, I let it soak for about 30 min., drain it through a fine sieve, then press it to extract all the moisture.

Delicious flavor.  I used 1 T. Jamacian Jerk powder and BBQ flavored salt  while it was all cooking.  I doubled the recipe so I would have it all week for lunches.

This recipe has become part of our regular rotation for ground beef.  Of course, it's impossible for me to make anything exactly as posted, so my changes are as follows.  I use Kashi brand pilaf, which I make with 2 cups beef broth, fry out the ground beef with onions, celery, and green pepper (not too much), add a drained can of Ro-Tel tomatoes with chilies and a teaspoon of cumin and salt, and combine the Kashi and the ground beef mixture and simmer for 5-10 minutes together. True, its appearance is nothing to write home about, but it does taste good, and it's super easy to make.

I probably won't make this again. My husband said it was ok, my daughter wouldn't eat it and I thought it was dry and bland.

Turned out quite nice, I used a beef bouillon cube, added some shredded carrot.  Liked the texture, good flavour.  I think next time I might try using hot Italian sausage instead of ground beef.

Fiance loved it! But I found it slightly bland and the texture a bit boring. Next time I will add garlic  and peppers and also reduce the ratio of bulgur to the other ingredients.

Fast, easy and healthy dinner option.
I love the easy base and the options different veggies and spices add.
Quite good as is too!

We loved it! I used a can of Red Gold basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes (14.5 oz) in place of the diced tomatoes and used a touch of chili powder in place of the cayenne pepper. It was easy to make, simple and DELISH! I think this would go great with sliced chicken breast too! It was great in its own, but I wasn't sure what to make with it....we ended up having sautéed broccoli and Chinese cabbage in butter. Mmmmmmmm!

Liked this very much, but made a few changes which I think made it tastier. I doubled the recipe and added 3 sliced carrots. I used my homemade tomato sauce (frozen) as tomatoes are not good at this time of year. Added some chopped green peppers along with tomato sauce. Seasoned with a little Worcestershire sauce and a little cumin. Very good - family enjoyed.

This is incredibly easy and quick, especially since we keep frozen ground beef on hand most of the time. I used some of my home canned diced tomatoes and green chilies, making sure to drain it.  It had just the right amount of heat.  I'd also like to try substituting quinoa for the bulgur, just for a different twist.  I'm definitely adding this to the regular recipe rotation.

I love this recipe.  Healthy and tasty.  I use Quinoa instead of Bulgar.  You have to cook it a bit longer but I like it much better!  Kids love it too.

This is delicious. I used buckwheat groats instead of cracked wheat and added a little Worcestershire sauce. We all thought it tasted like a healthy meatloaf. Will make again.

Despite the unappealing appearance, this is really good. Add diced tomatoes and chilies instead of fresh tomatoes for a little more zip. Wonderful, easy, and economical comfort food.

Love the veggies in the kasha!  I've typically had kasha with sauteed onions only, but I love the texture of the celery, onions and tomatoes cooked with the kasha.  I served the kasha with baked tilapia and it was a quick and healthy meal!
