I like to make this with halved string cheese sticks (one half inside each crescent "moon") instead of shredded cheese. I usually double the recipe and serve it with homemade pizza sauce to dip. The husband and kids LOVE this dish. I serve this with a huge veggie platter with homemade light ranch dressing for a quick "dipper" supper.

I have made a similar recipe "Pizza Pinwheels" from Pilsbury website.  That recipe adds another ingredient, pizza sauce to use as a dipping sauce.  My 4 year old likes helping out with making these. A quick and easy appetizer.

You had great timing!! I had the dough in the fridge from being on sale last week and a small troop of men coming over after a hockey game, lol. Big hit, very simple, straight forward and tasty shortcut for a fun snack. I think kids would enjoy making these with an adult, which is a great way to sneak in family time too. I served with some garlic mayo and pizza sauce for dipping. Thanks again!

Great snack. I did add pizza sauce that I made with tomato sauce and some seasoning. It was a lil difficult to keep the ingredients inside while rolling them up and after it baked I thought it needed more of the taste inside. Maybe I will follow the directions and not put the sauce inside just use it for dipping. I also cut the pepperoni up to make it easier to put them inside. I topped them with some cheese half way thru the baking process. Thank you!

These were great! I made them last night, simple, and delicious. I just wish there was a sauce to go along with it. I found one, however, called Easy Pizza Sauce III. It's great to go with these delicious Pizza Moons!

These were tasty. I added a few onion and green peppers in with the pepperoni. My toddler enjoyed them immensely.

I make these for parties.  If I'm making it more casual I'll cut the finished ones in half and have toothpicks and sauce to dip.  This also helps people tell if they're getting a pepperoni or cheese one.  Delicious!

I use sauce for dipping.  I use mozzarella sticks and tear them up too.  I like the seamless crescent rolls and cut them into squares.

I was looking for a quick appetizer for the kids and husband, since I knew they were not going to like the dinner I was preparing.  This turned out to be perfect thing.  I loved my dinner and the kids\husband were happy to just eat appetizers.

What a great recipe - thanks! I just made this dish for our  church social this afternoon! One extra thing I did - by accident - was to roll the croissants onto the excess shredded cheese so that the cheese bakes on the exterior. Delicious! Next time, when I have time, planning to use oregano from my garden. Here's how they turned out..

I've made these before and they're a big hit, but bear in mind one package of crescent rolls doesn't go very far, they are small-ish and I needed two cans of crescents and two cookie sheets to make enough for 4 teenagers, husband, and myself. I also spread spaghetti sauce on them before sprinkling the cheese (sorry, pizza sauce purists!)It is easier, but more expensive, to use halved string cheese sticks rather than shredded cheese.

These were alright, but either I did something wrong, or there was WAY too much cheese for the amount of crescent roll! Still good, but a little too cheesy for me.

These are a great quick kid friendly meal.  I had a tube of crescent rolls that I needed to hurry to use before it expired and decided to make these.  I think there must be a typo in the measurements.  There was no way I could have fit 4 cups of cheese in these.  I could only fit about 1 cup but no biggie.  I served these with spaghetti sauce for dipping.  kids loved them!

I like the concept of the recipe but not sure about the execution.  4 cups of cheese = 1/2 cup per triangle. Did the author of recipe use the large croissant rolls? I lightly applied tomato sauce to triangle before topping and I used a scant 1/8th cup of cheese on each one, I cut pepperoni slices into small pieces before placing on rolls and I added a few pieces of frozen and then defrosted mixed colour peppers. Baked as suggested and then warmed some pizza sauce to serve alongside.

Easy to make and really tasty. We used string cheese instead of shredded cheese which was less messy. Next time I think we will add more pepperoni as well.

These were delicious and simple, although (judging by the photos) mine certainly didn't turn out as beautiful or as "moon-like" as others'! I must note that I am not at all picky when it comes to eating leftovers. I will happily microwave and eat leftovers any day, but these pizza moons do NOT make for good leftovers. If reheated, they will be doughy and mushy. Trust me, they are best eaten immediately after baking!

I had the grands and thought this would be a fun lunch. Kids loved making them but they just didn't bake right- I do have a convection oven so there should have been no problem. I took them out after the correct time and they were golden brown on the outside but the onside dough was gooey.

I thought the crescent rolls were a little sweet tasting, but otherwise good. I used mozzarella string cheese instead of shredded. I also served with a garlic Parmesan pizza sauce for dipping.
