I omitted the chicken because I made this to go with pork chops. To fill in the missing meat, I added in another chopped red pepper and some sliced baby bella mushrooms. I like a lot of garlic, I used more than two cloves. I think it was more like six. I tasted it before I served it--it needed a little somethin'-somethin'. I threw in a good amount of homemade italian seasoning and a little crushed red pepper flake plus a little organic chicken broth because it needed a little liquid to help thin out the cream cheese and make more of a sauce. That made it so much better. This was a nice skillet meal that was easily adapted to what I had on hand. It just needs a little oomph.

Nice and creamy, quick and easy to make. I like my pasta a bit more saucy so I added about 3/4 cup of milk and some provolone cheese.

Made a few adjustments, Grilled chicken tenders marinated in Italian dressing and used roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts. I added all and then the used the garlic cooking creme and bowtie pasta! Felt like I was at a fancy resturant. Easy recipe to add your own spin!

Great simple recipe!  I added more garlic, garlic salt, pepper and Emeril's original essence (to my liking) for more flavor.  Without it, I think it would've been bland.  I cut the broccoli and red peppers into little pieces to "disguise" it from my 3 & 4 year old and used whole wheat rotini, and they ate it up without a single complaint.  I will definetly make this recipe again!

Good recipe but agree with others that it was a bit dry - would add a touch of milk next time.  Also used chopped rotisserie chicken which added nice flavor and made cooking time quicker

Was tasty super easy/fast to make, impressed a picky boyfriend. I exchanged rotini for farfalle, cooked the peppers/broccoli down some before adding the chicken, and added: Tony Cachare's seasoning, basil, small amount of chili powder, and a tiny bit of parsley- but next time will omit one garlic clove. It will come out somewhat looking as pictured, but with more sauce.

This dish was fantastic!  The only "spice" I had to add was salt and pepper, and I usually spice the heck out of everything.  Even my husband, who HATES broccoli, loved this dish!  He said it was probably one of the best things I've ever cooked and practically begged to make it again.
