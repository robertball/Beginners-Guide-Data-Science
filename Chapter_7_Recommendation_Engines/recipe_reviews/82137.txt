I wanted to re-review this terrific recipe and add that I keep oatmeal that I grind up into flour that I use in this recipe with great success.  The cookies are very tender and soft rather than crunchy. Instead of the whole 2 cups, I add 1 3/4.  I have also successfully used craisins when I found out I was out of raisins and it was still very, very good. Still an awesome, 5 star recipe. Grandma definately knows best-and this recipe publisher gets my whole family's thanks for sharing it.  My daughters and I baked these after reading Molly, the American Girl who's father was in WW11, and she had to ration sugar.  Even if your not crazy about molasses-you will find these the very best cookie recipe any grandma or mom could pass down.  It's a hands down winner with all 9 members of my family.

These are SOOOO good!!! They're so soft and....fluffy! I replaced my shortening with butter and added 1/2t each of cloves and cinnamon, but kept everything else the same. This is going to replace my current oatmeal cookie recipe. Thanks so much!!

In my quest to try to eliminate white sugar, these really got my interest! In addition to the molasses called for, I used only half the sugar and substituted half a cup of high quality 100% maple syrup instead. I also used half whole wheat flour instead of all white, plus I threw in a 1/4 cup of flax seeds. I also chopped up dark chocolate and added it because...I felt like it!! These are excellent tasting cookies!!

I recently bought steel cut oatmeal, only to find out that I don't like it.  So I found this recipe and figured I could use the oatmeal up this way.  I wasn't sure if it would work for oatmeal cookies because it isn't instant oatmeal, but given this is a WWII recipe, I'm guessing they didn't have instant oatmeal back then either.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The steel cut oatmeal lent itself to a cookie with a bit more crunch, yet still being chewy.

These cookies were wonderfully soft and tasty!  I only used walnuts and I put in a little more then the recipe called for.  I like my cookies really soft, so I took them out right at 10mins and they were great.

Great cookies!  I've made these several times now without butter or shortening substituting applesauce instead and they come out as a great tasting healthy treat before my runs.

Did not like this recipe at all....they have all the ingredients for a good cookie, but they are too dry...maybe instead of dropping by teaspoon using a tablespoon would have produced a bigger cookie and therefor more moist...:(

These are delicious. I added about a teaspoon of ground cloves, pecans instead of walnuts, and I soaked the raisins before adding them. I didn't have light molasses so I used 3 tablespoons of regular. I also used butter instead of shortening, and baked them for 9 1/2 minutes. They were crisp on the edges and chewy in the center. Perfect.

This is a simple cookie, but delicious. 
My Grandma made cookies very similar to this when I was growing up and she'd tell me stories about her childhood. I make them now to be closer to her and to pass down the same memories to my children. These will be dear to me for that reason.

YUM!      I added 2 tsp of cinnamon to this recipe, used 3 T of dark molasses and 2 T of light corn syrup, did not add walnuts or raisins.  Ended up flattening the cookies a bit half way through baking the first batch.  They turned out very well!  Will definitely be making these again.

This recipe is perfect just the way it is!  A lot of people "tweaked" it, but in all honesty I tried it just the way it is written and nothing needs to be added, deleted or changed in any way = thanks@@!!!!!

I say YUMMMMY!!  I have never made homemade cookies before.  They were easy to make.  I followed another review on using butter instead of shortening, and added about 1/2 tsp of cloves, and cinnamon.  My husband dosen't like oatmeal rasin cookies, but he tried them because I made them, and he said they tasted like a store bought cookie.  I was so proud of myself for making them so good.  Thanks for the recipes I enjoy!!

these cookies are definitely addictive. almost dangerous - but don't let that stop you from making them! i did make a few alterations: i added 1/2 tsp of both cinnamon and ginger, only used one tsp of vanilla, used butter (smart balance) instead of shortening, and used about 2.5 tbsp regular molasses. they turned out excellent. thank you dls58.

Excellent! Nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I used full molasses because I didn't have light, so turned down the temp 25 degrees and cooked about 11 minutes (to avoid overbrowning). Definitely a keeper!

I love these cookies. I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon of ground clove and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. I substituted Smart Balance Original Blend for the shortening with great results and a healthier cookie. If you use Smart Blend don't use the "lite" version, you can't bake with it, but I have had great results with the original blend in many of my baked goods. I also added walnuts and dried currents. The cookies are chewy and moist. It occurred to me that maybe cooks in the forties and during wartime didn't have access to alot of spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.

These are a very "oaty" oatmeal cookie. They could easily be made into what I call "hippy cookies" if you use some wheat flour, flax seeds, dried fruits, twigs, bark, etc. I added chocolate chips to mine. :) Don't get me wrong -- I love me a good hippy cookie as much as the next Alica Silverstone but I'm just sayin'... I also used butter in place of the shortening. I used regular molasses -- all 5 tablespoons worth and it was not in any way overpowering or really even noticeable with the chocolate chips to hide it. I assume if you add spices instead, it would also drown out the molasses (if that's even an issue for you). I baked mine at 325 in a new, higher-end convection oven and watched them closely. I pulled them out before they were 100% done and let them sit about one minute before transferring to the cooling rack carefully. They stay soft this way. It's a nice recipe but for my money, I think Oatmeal Chip Cookies from this site is the best oatmeal cookie recipe if you're looking for a crowd pleasing hit. These are a nice healthier twist.

I agree w/ some other reviewers that these are like "muffinettes" since they are raised more like muffins than cookies.  They only add-in I used was a walnut half pushed into the bottom of each cookie.  I also added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the dry ingredients for a very lightly spiced taste.  The simple muffin-y part had a lovely, retro, homey taste and texture, and they are very quick and easy to make.  I ate way too many of them while they were warm.

I will give this 5 stars I did some changes for health reasons. 1. 1/2 c. splenda & 1/2 c. brown sugar(sugar)  2. 3/4 c. unsweetened apple sauce(shortening) 3. 1/2 c. egg beaters  Also I added 1 c. shredded carrots and 1/2 c. pineapple tiblets and more cinnamon(because we like it) The cookies were great almost like a mini muffin.

the best ever oatmeal cookies! the molasses taste is not overwhelming, it just gives it a little something...and they came out puffy and soft, each and every one of them! only things i tweaked was no walnuts (my son does not like them in cookies) and doubled the raisins since we all love them...

These were very tasty!  I didn't know what kind of "oatmeal" to use, so I used old fashioned oats, since it's what I had in my cupboard.  I also couldn't find light molasses, but used mild tasting molasses.  The result was wonderful!

Great recipe w/lots of flexibility! In the interest of making this a bit more healthy, I did the following:
1) Whole wheat flour instead of white,
2) Replaced white sugar with 1/2 parts Stevia & brown sugar,
3) Added extra vanilla (recommended by others),
4) Replaced shortening with 1/2 parts olive oil & applesauce,
5) Replaced raisins with dark choc chips,
6) Added 1/2 tbsp cinnamon
VERY YUMMY!!!

These are wonderful.  Soft and chewy.  Attempting to use what was on hand and avoid a trip to the store made the following changes: butter instead of shortening,  1 cup brown sugar instead of molasses, dried cranberries instead of raisins, chopped pecans, and followed the advice to add cinnamon and cloves.

I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and used butter instead of shortening, used 3 T regular molasses, added 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, left out the nuts and doubled the raisins.  These turned out very good, my husband likes them, and I will make these again. I was looking for an oatmeal raisin recipe to make for a friend and am glad I found this recipe. My yield was over 6 dozen cookies.

These were really yummy! I left out the walnuts and raisins and instead I used mini chocolate easter eggs to make bird's nests. I would make these again!

Awesome cookie! I was looking for something between a ginger snap and oatmeal raisin & it definitely fit the bill. I added some cloves, ginger and cinnamon to spice it up, as well as replaced the shortening fully with applesauce and it was great. Chewy and yummy! Thanks!

This is my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe.  Oatmeal cookies just don't taste right without molasses, IMHO.  
I made the following minor changes:
1) I used 1/4 cup of regular, full-flavor molasses.   2) If you miss the flavor of brown sugar, substitute brown for white.  It rounds out the molasses flavor, too.                                                                      3) As some other readers did, I substituted butter for shortening.                                                      4) I added a scant teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of cloves.
5) Finally, I substituted one cup of ground oatmeal for a cup of the flour (I like oatmeal!) and dried blueberries for the raisins (don't like raisins).
Great recipe--thank you very much!

Very good recipe! However, I made some changes per reviews! I used 3 T. molasses and 2 T. light corn syrup. (The wife is not to crazy about molasses but loved these after this change)! Also, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, then added 1/2 cup of maple syrup, added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ground cloves, cut vanilla down to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp almond extract, used butter instead of shortening, and used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup wheat flour. These changes made this a Awesome recipe! Thanks Diana for sharing!

Excellent- I halved the recipe, added 1 tsp allspice and used butterflavored shortening. On a few I made them into oatmeal cookie sandwiches with a thin layer of vanilla frosting. 

SECOND TIME- so I made the cookies exactly to the recipe without the raisins. Immediately my husband noticed a difference. I had forgotten that I had added allspice the first time around.DO NOT SKIP THE ALLSPICE- it makes a huge difference.

My cookies weren't as puffy as other featured photos but still very good. I overcooked my first batch and then got the hang of it. For me, they were perfect after 10 minutes! I like a soft textured cookie. I didn't have raisins so I used craisins which I plumped in hot water for about 15 minutes.

VERY GOOD!   I was looking for an oatmeal cookie that didn't use butter because I didn't want to run to the store.  This recipe was perfect.  I was surprised how nice they held their shape and were so tasty.  Thank you Diana S. for sharing such a VERY GOOD recipe.

Tasty, quick cookie.  I subbed applesauce for 1/2 c. of the shortening, and just used 1/4 c. regular shortening.  I also used half whole wheat and half white flour and cut the sugar to 3/4 c. and it was plenty sweet for us!  My one year old couldn't stuff his face fast enough!

These turned out amazing, I accidentally added the sugar to the rest of the dry ingredients but it turned out just fine. I baked part of the batter and froze the rest for later since its just my husband and myself. They were fluffy, soft and just tasted amazing!

Cookie was really moist and flavourful, especially if you like molasses cookies.  I didn't bother to sift the dry ingredients and instead just dumped all but the oats into the wet ingredients.  Stirring the oats in at the end worked out perfectly.

This recipe is incredibly good. I only changed a couple things out of strictly personal preference and because of items I had on hand. I used butter instead of shortening, cranberries instead of raisins and I added a half tsp of all spice and a half tsp of cinnamon. The cookies came out so moist and flavorful. I just noticed that another reviewer used applesauce instead of butter...will definitely try that next! Thank you for a great recipe!

These turned out wonderful even with the few tweaks I had to make, since I discovered I no FLOUR once I had already started to make these! I used Bisquick in place of flour, didn't need the baking powder, baking soda or salt since the Bisquick already has it! Used a little less sugar too. Also I used half butter flavored shortening and half coconut oil. These came out so delicious and tender.

I liked 'em, but they were kinda bland.  I used 1/4c butter, 1/4c margarine & 1/4c shortening, reduced salt to 1/2t, added 1/2t cinnamon & 1t vanilla (Love my vanilla!).  Used 1/4c molasses.  Really made to use up my molasses, which it did; & I may make them again - depending on how they are once they cool.  Good, but not great.  Made 4 1/2 dozen.

No fail recipe. I was tired and didn't mix the ingrediants in the order they should go (which I usually am sure to do) and they still came out great! I even halved the sugar and substituted maple syrup and dark corn syrup for the molasas; still ended up sweet, maybe due to the raisins (used golden and regular). The only problem I have is that I can taste the baking soda (this is the reason for the 4 stars, would otherwise give it a 6!). I may cut it down or out next time and see what happens. But as the recipe stands it is so fluffy, even at the teaspoon size. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg. Will keep making. Thanks for the great cookies.

As written, I have to give this 4 stars (actually 4 and 1/2) because I found the cookies a bit too salty, but otherwise perfect.  I also added about 1 teaspoon of Pampered CHef's cinnamon plus (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice).  I used butter flavored Crisco and chopped walnuts (no raisins).  My daughter helped chop the walnuts and ended up pulverizing half of them, so I actually had something more like walnut flour. I cooked the first batch for 12 minutes and the following batches for 10 minutes (since they went onto a hot stone they required less baking time).  The cookies are pleasantly crisp on the outside and amazingly soft and chewy on the inside. Next time, I am going to try to reduce the salt to 3/4 teaspoon and see if that helps.

This is the third or fourth time I made these cookies. I modified a little. I used regular molasses instead of light molasses. I didn't have a half cup of raisins. I used up what I had sitting around. I used mixed nuts. Planter's snacking mixed nuts. I chopped up a half cup. I used steel cut oats and my colon is much happier with the fiber content.  All other ingredients stayed the same. These oatmeal cookies were delicious as usual. They won't last too long in this household.

Makes fabulous cookies. It is a great recipe as is and a great base for adding in different ingredients like pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice or craisens, pecans, and white chocolate. Never fails no matter how I make them.

Great recipe! I tried making it healthier and substituted about 1/2 the shortening for one mashed avocado (or half a large avocado) then filled the remaining 3/4 cup with shortening. Also I didn't have molasses so I used 3 Tb honey and 2 Tb agave (I said I was sort of trying to make it healthy didn't I? lol) and they turned out great!  Nice and soft. I'd advise mashing them down a little bit so the inside cooks better.  If you want a crunchier outside drop by teaspoon (the uneven edges cook faster and get crunchy leaving the inside nice and soft).  If you want the cookies very soft roll in ball form first.  Hope this helps!

I chose this recipe for the oatmeal and the molasses.  Oatmeal, a healthy ingredient.  Molasses, a flavor we don't find every day.  Nuts and raisins added a lot, too.  The cookies are great!
   
I appreciate the cook that shares.  Thank you, Diana.

very yummy! My son doesn't want the raisins added next time, and my husband said it needed butterscotch chips. I cannot please everyone, but I will make it again. Next time I'm going to add dehydrated apples.

I don't like raisins so I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead.  I also added 1/2t of cloves and 1/2t of cinnamon (I could have added more because I can barely taste these spices).  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  These are light and fluffy.  The cookies don't spread on the cookie sheet so you can fit a lot on one sheet.  This recipe made 52 cookies for me.

These are yummy (maybe not mind blowing where I want to call a friend to tell her about them) but definitely a nice twist on just regular oatmeal cookies. I will make these again.

Made this yesterday.  Used butter instead of shortening and had great results.  One mistake - I substituted choc chips for the raisins and the taste combination doesn't work out.  I'm still giving this recipe 5 stars as with raisins the flavors would be perfect!

I have made these cookies several times...with the addition of chocolate and/or butterscotch chips too.  EVERYONE loves these cookies, and claim they are best oatmeal cookies ever!  Instead of shortening I used butter....and also added some cinnamon.  They are soft and chewy and ever sooooooo good!!

These were a huge hit.  I used dark molasses in an equal amount.  (I don't like molasses as a condiment, but it really makes these cookies!)  I added cinnamon, eased back on the sugar about 1/8 cup and used apple sauce for half of the shortening (butter for the other half).  I spooned by the tablespoon and baked for 10 minutes.  It made about 3 dozen plus a couple.  They were soft and chewy, but not dense.  Might do chocolate chips next time for the kids, but so delicious with raisins!  Thank you!

This is my go-to recipe for oatmeal cookies.  I'm so glad I don't need to wade through dozens of oatmeal cookie recipies any more.  They do well if you add 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips. I use sorghum instead of molasses and add some cinnamon.

I love these cookies! I used 1/4 less sugar and dark brown molasses, because that's what I had on hand. Dark walnuts added to the yummy "earthy" taste.

I just made such a perfect oatmeal cookie after semi-following this recipe. However, I didn't use any molasses as I didn't have any on hand. I happend to find the recipe because It didn't require any butter, as I only had a 1/4 cup on hand. I only made a half batch...so my changes refer to a half batch in terms of measurements!!!! Okay, instead of using 2.5 tablespoons of molasses, I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I added 1/4 cup of butter because that is all I had and added lots of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to taste....probably a couple teaspoons of both. These cookies are terrific. They hold together well, are soft, and came out the perfect thickness....almost like what you would buy professionally made. I also rolled mine into small 1inch balls before I baked them....Superb!

I didn't have any butter in the house so I tried this intriguing recipe.  My family, including extended family, conclude that these are the BEST oatmeal cookies they have ever had!  & my husband who usually picks out raisins, ate the raisins & all!  I made them exactly as written.  PERFECT!  Thank you for the recipe Diana S!

I've made several Oatmeal and several molasses cookies but this cookie just didn't turn out well. The cookie needed less molasses, more sugar and more oats I think. I'll keep looking for another recipe.

This is the third time that I've used this recipe and I love these cookies! They are so versatile and tasty no matter what I do to them.  I always used all whole wheat flour, and once I used apple sauce for half of the fat. I've done them with or without nuts, but never with the raisins. No matter how I make them, they are so good and don't last long with my 3 kids.

Pretty good and super easy. I made a few adjustments... I cut the white flour in half and added 1 C whole wheat flour Added one additional cup of oatmeal I made half the batch with chocolate chips, the other half with raisins and chocolate chips I used regular unsulphered molasses, no light molasses in the pantry I only gave it four stars because the flavor is pretty plain. I'm going to play with this one some more, maybe cinnamon and butter instead of shortening.

I don't know, these were ok. chewy and soft, but not very oatmeal-y, and kind of bland I thought. I used butter instead of shortening and I added raisins and walnuts and chocolate chips, eh.

I took these cookies to a church social...they were a hit (didn't have any to take home - darn!). The only changes I made was a few suggestions from others: I used 3 TBSP dark molasses (since that was all I had) and added 1/2 tsp. cloves. The cookies were much more tangy and interesting than regular oatmeal cookies.

My boyfriend's fav cookies are Oatmeal and Molasses.  I made this for his birthday and he's been requesting them since he finished them... the next day!

Nice and chewey.  I doubled the amount of raisins, for personal preference.

They might look hard, but they're surprisingly fluffy. I added raisins only and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup because I was afraid they might turn out too sweet, but this way they were fine.

I have been making these cookies for a couple years now.  We love them!  They seem to hit the spot during the autumn especially.  We make them every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  We don't add the raisins and nuts because of personal preference.  We do, however, add chocolate chips sometimes!  Yum!

These cookies are so tasty!  The flavor of the molasses is there but not overpowering and the chewy texture of the oatmeal is just right.  Next time I will make with raisins!

These cookies were almost bland even after I added some butterscotch chips to dough and rolled tablespoon sized balls into sugar before baking.

These cookies have a nice taste. The family enjoyed them. I not going to judge the presentation because, I am not sure if they were suppose to appear flatter. My turned out exactly how I spooned them on and didn't flatten out even the slightest.

I made this recipe as written, except that I didn't have any nuts or raisins on hand.  They were delicious, but I can imagine they would have been even more delicious with the nuts and raisins.

The molasses provides a unique taste that compels you to keep eating more cookies! Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly. I was sceptical about using shortening but butter would change the flavor. These are very nice cookies! I am making them for the second time and not changing a thing! I like knowing the history of the recipe as well

GLUTEN FREE OPTION: I used Bob's All Purpose GF Baking Flour (Red label--not the 1 to 1) plus 2 t. xanthan gum. Really good.  I used butter in place of shortening and added cinnamon, cloves, and ginger, as recommended. I also made them a second time and used 1/2 brown sugar, added the raisins and walnuts. Liked them even better.

I made it but in an altered state because I had some leftover steel cut oats that I had cooked overnight in a crock pot. Used this recipe and added an extra cup of flour as I had seen in another recipe. Also added 1-1/2 ripe banana when blending the shortening and sugar and 2/3 cup chocolate chips and a small amount of chopped pecans. It makes a more of a cake type cookie and required an extra four minutes of baking, but the results were well worth it. Definitely liked the molasses blended with these other flavors.

Cut recipe in half. Used brown sugar. Used dark molasses. Used butter. Wish it had more oats and less flour. Didn't taste like an oatmeal cookie for that reason, not what I expected.

Family favorite! Unfortunately my pantry doesn't have any molasses. Instead, I used Aunt Jemima Butter Rich Syrup. The flavor was a perfect blend. Not too sweet , but just right!

Loved these cookies.  I probably would never have put oatmeal and molasses together but now that I have, I will definitely be making these again.  Already thought of several different add-ins I want to try.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed this to the tee. I’m telling you- it needs no revisions. I will say I have a habit of making cookies too big so mine did need to cook for three minutes longer but I closely monitor my cookies especially when baking a recipe I’ve never made. They turned out just fine. I want to keep this recipe forever. It’s one of my new favorites. I think they taste so good I’ve wondered if I ought to make cream filling and use them for homemade oatmeal pies! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

Wonderful flavor! I substituted butter for some of the shortening (for more flavor) so the cookies spread a teensy bit more: 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.  YUMMMMMMM

i don't usually keep normal oatmeal on hand, just quick cook steel cut oatmeal.  a few peoples reviews said that they had used them with success so i decided to give this recipe a try.  as a few other reviewers, i had no light molasses so i used 3T dark instead and 2T water (to help soften the steel cut oats).  i omitted the raisins and nuts.  i tried the batter, i wanted to eat the whole bowl it was so yummy.  i made them walnut sized balls of dough and cooked for exactly 10 min, then let them cool on the tray.  a small amount of the flavor cooked out but definitely worth making again.

i liked it - very comforting cookie - but fam did not.  they wanted a more gooey molasses cookie - this was def more on firm side.

i used 5T regular, dark molasses, not quite the full cup of sugar & did flatten out before baking.

This is the absolute best oatmeal molasses cookie ever.  My advice; make as directed, don't add to or take away from as this is delicious as written.  This is definitely on the top of my oatmeal cookie recipes.

Delicious! I used butter instead of shortening and craisins instead of raisins and they're soft, chewy, and not too sweet. I'm never a fan of oatmeal but these are great.

These had a very nice consistency, soft and chewy. However, the molasses was very strong. If I made these again, I would definitely consider adding some cinnamon, maybe halve the molasses.

They were very dry, and I'm guessing it's because I had no shortening and substituted butter.

I think this is a very nice, simple recipie. The cookies came out quite soft. I thought the dough was a little dry so I splashed some Orange Juice in and solved that problem. I also didnt use a full 
 sugar.  I used sliced Almonds and Cherry flavored Craisins. I'd say this one's a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 3 tbsp of regular molasses instead of using the light molasses since I didn't have any on hand. Oh!  And I did use butter instead of shortening.  They turned out perfect!  These are very soft and have a wonderful flavor. I threw in half a bag of chocolate chips too. Yum!  I will definitely make these again!

I replaced the flour with gluten free Cup 4 Cup Multipurpose Flour.  OMG!  If I didn't have the pack of flour sitting on the counter I'd never know they were gluten free!  I also added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup...just enough sweetness.

I am so glad I found this recipe. I tried it today and was a success with the family.  Cookies were soft and chewy but had the right crunch.  I ground the walnuts instead of using large pieces.  We're keeping this recipe as our favorite.

Would definitely make them again.  I did use margarine instead of shortening.   I added 1 tsp or so of cinnamon. And used 5 Tbsp of grandmas molasses and no light. I also added some dark chocolate chunks. Would've added walnuts but husband is allergic.  I have a gas oven which heats hotter so I put the temp at 325° and baked for 8-9 min.

yummy and moist. I dropped by the Tablespoon and still only cooked for ten minutes. I did find them super sweet, I cut the sugar in half but added the raisins suggested and it was still really sweet, I will cut the sugar even more (probaby only put 1/4 of the recommended) and add the raisins as suggested, they add a lot of sweetness. I also did brown sugar instead of white.

Amazing!!! Thank you for sharing your family recipe.

My mom's oatmeal raisin cookies are very cake-like and dry. I have searched for years for a moist & chewy oatmeal cookie. Plus I love molasses. So this is a perfect recipe. I've even written it down so I can make them when the internet is out. Due credit noted of course.

I do cover my raisins in hot water while I put the rest of the recipe together. It plumps them back up and keeps them moist after baking.
(quick tip if you're out of shortening 2 parts butter to 1 part veg oil is a good alternative)

I already had a great oatmeal cookie recipe (after trying many) but wanted to try this molasses one.  Oh. My.  Goodness!! So incredibly good.  I took the advice of a reviewer and substituted some of the flour (half) for oat flour and almond meal.  It made the dough very very stiff. I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup turbinado sugar and only 3 T molasses since I only had dark blackstrap and I know that flavor can overwhelm.  Still very sweet to me. But Next time I may do 4 or 5 tablespoons molasses because the molasses flavor was not quite there yet with the 3. I smashed half the cookies and left half in mounds.  I preferred them flattened ones (maybe because of the flour change). Thank you and your grandmother!!!

I have made these many times and always enjoy them immensely. I add both walnuts and Craisins and just a bit more vanilla than prescribed and undercook slightly because I enjoy a moister cookie. A blast from the past and highly recommended!

So good!  Substituted coconut oil for the shortening, only had blackstrap molasses so used 2T that and 2T corn syrup, and added some cinnamon.  My 13 yr old daughter commented on how good they were.  Soft and chewy even the next day.

This was a great oatmeal cookie recipe. Oatmeal raisin cookies are my favorite so I added a cup of golden raisins. I've made a LOT of oatmeal cookies over the years and this was in the top 5. I'd definitely make it again.
My sister thought it was a bit sweet but I thought it was perfect. So you may need to adjust the amount of sugar depending on how sweet you like the cookie.

If you like molasses cookies and oatmeal raisin cookies these are a great combo. Love love. My mom who was a child during WWII was wondering why they were called that. She remembers Molasses being on rations ...

This is soo good that I've made it three times in the past two weeks. It has more oatmeal than most other recipes, so we lie to ourselves and say it's good for you! :>) I use a heaping tablespoon full when dropping on the cookie sheet and bake for 16 minutes @ 350.

I made this recipe with a few changes to up the iron content for my son who has low iron. I used twice the raisins and soaked them in a little water for about 20 minutes. I used brown sugar in place of the white and added half a cup crushed sunflower seeds. I also crushed up about 1 cup Total cereal and added that to the dough. I added an extra egg. Also, I used half butter and half oil. They turned out awesome.

These are really good! I've made them twice in the last month. My little girl loves them. I only baked for 8 min.

I was a bit disappointed with these at first, they taste a bit too much like they're good for you.  But they really grew on me, and I've been enjoying them all week.  I substituted half a cup of mini chocolate chips into them, and left out the nuts and raisins.

I made these as directed. I found the molasses to be very over powering for my taste. They were great texture and super moist but I couldn't get past the molasses :(

Made these today and they are really good. Used regular dark molasses due to that was all I had, and did add 1tsp of pumpkin spice. Because of using the dark molasses it was suggested in other posts to bake at 325 for 11 min. This worked great cookies slightly crunchy on the edges, but very moist in the center.  I have been a true failure with molasses cookies in the past.  I have finally found one that I can make for my husband that isn't a hockey puck!

I ran out of molasses and used 2 tbspKaro syrup instead, half cup brown sugar and half cup white sugar,  half teaspoon ground cloves.  I added butter extract, made one batch with just raisins, another with raisins and walnuts and final with raisins chocolate chips and pecans.  Next time I'll use even less sugar because I think I can get away with it
 You can do a lot with this amazing recipe and it's all delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I made these for game night (omitted the walnuts and raisins) and everyone loved them! Even one of our members who says he doesn't really like oatmeal kept reaching for another cookie. Definitely will make again (:

Very good. If you like molasses, of course. If you don't, then this recipe is not for you as the strong molasses flavor comes through. I made these as bars for time saving which was good. I also did an experiment: I added coconut, sunflower seeds, and walnuts to 1/2 the recipe. I really liked the version with the additions.

Great recipe. But, I don't seem to ever be able to leave something alone. I put in about a half cup of Heath chips and 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. I upped the raisins to a cup also. I used Pam butter-flavored spray on cookie sheet and cooked at 375 degrees, not 350 for 10 1/2 minutes. I made dough balls maybe equal to 1 1/2 tbsp so they look a little smaller than a golf ball (though I don't golf so what do I know right?). Anyway, with the mods, I have gotten rave reviews from all of my test dummies. Yum!

These cookies were great.  Growing up I wasn't much for molasses, but as an adult I thought I might give these a try and now I have to say molasses is yummy.  The oatmeal adds a nice texture.  I cooked them for 9 minutes in a convection oven and immediately removed them from the baking sheet after.  I am so happy I did that because they turned out softer and chewier.  Also I used egg beaters instead of whole eggs, that cut back the calories even more, and it didn't compromise the taste.  My family thought they were buttery and delicious.  Thanks for posting!

Tasted really bad. Dough tasted really good, but when I cooked them they tasted as if there was to much baking soda in them (and I made sure I put the right amount in).

No need to buy brown sugar...make it any shade of brown you want by adding molasses to white sugar as you need it.  I like the idea of oatmeal "flour" to make these cookies.  VG

I was pleased to see this recipe as I wanted to make some molasses cookies.... I use rye flour rather than wheat which works well here.... I used chopped candied pinnaple instead of sugar & dark molasses which I had on hand.... result was a very rich "grown up" cookie.

I made two batches of these this week, the first sticking closely to the recipe. It was good, and I loved the chewy texture of the cookies. The only issue I had was that the shortening tasted kind of strong, especially right after they were baked. Maybe my shortening was funky, but I'll try it with fresher stuff next time. The second batch I made with Earth Balance butter substitute and used half white/half turbinado sugar. These were fluffier cookies, more like the ones in the picture. The turbinado gave a really nice crunch, and the butter sub made these a bit crisper. Either way, it's a very good recipe and the cookies got raves all around.

I used 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar.  I couldn't see these with all white.  These cookies were okay. I found them a bit dry, nothing special.  I may try them again with just the white sugar.

Very tasty! We did do some modification since we were looking for a way to boost our twins iron intake- it greatly increases the molasses taste, so be careful if you aren't used to molasses!  Modifications: Swapped quick oats for Old Fashioned long cook. Swapped Light Molasses for Unsulphered Black Strap Molasses. (says on label, signifigant source of Iron, Calcium and Potassium) Left out the Walnuts Added 1/3 cup of sugar (only because I forgot and put the sugar in with the dry ingredients and not with the wet- but in retrospect, I'd add it again.) In the future, I'd dust these all over with powdered sugar. These are a great favorite and will be made again!

They're okay, but I found the molasses flavor to be too strong.  Replacing 1/2 c of the shortening with applesauce and just using 1/4 c of shortening works well if you want to make it a bit more healthy.

My husband and I both loved these cookies. I have made them several times now, and they turned out great each time. Thanks so much for posting the recipe!

I made these a few days ago and we like them. My neighbour loved them and wants the recipe. I froze half and will be giving them to my kids as school snacks.

Different but good! I took others' suggestions, 2.5-3T of dark molasses, 1.5-2T Lt Corn syrup, 1t each of Cinnamon & Grnd Cloves. I also added 1c chopped Walnuts and only 1/2c sugar. It wasn't very sweet but just right for those like my hubby who don't like things sweet.  This can be a good yet bad thing, we ate more of them in one sitting than most cookies we eat :)

Really great, soft cookies. I added cinnamon and cloves. Replaced the shortening with butter (simply because I did not have shortening). Turned out wonderful. I intend to make these often and for many years to come.

I subbed butter for shortening and brown sugar for white. They stayed nice and fluffy. Great cookies and easy.

Very yummy!  I made a couple changes: I had blackstrap molasses (dark) so I used 3 tbs. of it and increased the sugar by a 1/2 cup.  I also added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger) and a little less than 1 tsp of nutmeg.  In addition, I added 1 tsp of almond extract and just 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 2.  The cookies came out very flavorful, moist, and dark because of the molasses.  I couldn't go by color to figure out when these where done, but by flatness.  I took them out after they had puffed out a little, before they flattened out, because the directions said to let them cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes and I figured they'd cook a little more.  So I took them out at 9 minutes.  I didn't get a flat, thin cookie like I do with the Quaker recipe!  I think people who like a mild cookie would not like the way I made them and should stick closer to the recipe, but if you like flavor and spice, you should like my alterations.  Only reason I didn't add that 5th star is that I think they're a tad too oily.  I used butter instead of shortening for health reasons, but I think a 1/2 cup would have more than done the trick rather than 1/3 cup that the recipe calls for.

I took the advice of others and used butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 tsp of cin., and a 1/2 tsp of cloves. We used raisins and white choc chips in addition. Yummy tasting and a delightful smell while baking with the added spices!

These were good.  This is the first time I have made oatmeal cookies and they turned out well.  I used less sugar since the molasses has sugar in it.  I will make this again but put white chocolate chips in them.

First time I've ever had to throw cookies away.  EVER.  The only changes I made were using 3T of DARK molasses and omitting the nuts.  Like nakita said, these have all the right stuff for a good cookie, but for me and the group, these just didn't do it.

These where great. I only had dark Molasses so I used a 50/50 mix of Golden Syrup and Molasses. I did make them bigger than was suggested, but only because I didn't read that bit until after we had cooked them. I rolled them into walnut sized balls and they worked out fine.
These will be made again in this house :)
Thank you

These were really missing something, maybe I should have measured the molasses better but they weren't sweet enough and they have to have raisins or nuts. These were ok with brown sugar on top but otherwise I was embarrassed when I had to serve them on short notice. I might try these again but truth be told I'll probably just look for another recipe.

The cookies were great.  I used 1/3 each of molasses, honey and agave. they were hard the next day however. I still enjoyed them. There's something about them that is just addictive. Sure to make them again but with a few more nuts.

Good cookie and easy to make.  Next time I would add cinnamon for more flavor!
