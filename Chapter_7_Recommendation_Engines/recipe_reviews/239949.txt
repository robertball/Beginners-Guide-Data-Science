Too much cinnamon, too much cinnamon and sugar blend. Not enough apples. Too sweet.

Being that I'm not a baker I thought what the heck when I saw this one. I decided that if The Biker Baker can make it, this old man can too. This is a stand alone good recipe, no ice cream necessary unless of course you want some.

I added about 1/2 cup more oatmeal, but otherwise the recipe is great!

Based on the reviews I reduced the cinnamon to 3 teaspoons. I used 5 tart granny smiths and squeezed the juice of one lemon over them. It was really good warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The next day, cold, it was even better because the crust and crumbled topping got crisp .

Yes, please correct the error on the cinnamon. I used 1 teaspoon and it was just right. 

My family really liked it, and it is a good alternative to making crust!

Very good recipe for apple crisp, everyone loved it, however I cut back the cinnamon to 1 tablespoon even when I doubled the recipe.

I cut the cinnamon down to 3 tsp and it was more than enough. I found this recipe to be too moist and not crispy enough.

This recipe sounds good but lacks flavor. I think that next time I will add salt and lemon to give it some depth.

I will make this again but I will cut down on the cinnamon.  I normally add more than called in most recipes but 3T was too much.  I reduced the sugar and butter just to cut calories and it seemed to work out just fine.
