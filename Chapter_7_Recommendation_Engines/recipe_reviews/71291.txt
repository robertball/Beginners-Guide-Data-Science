Was so easy to make and was absolutely delicious! My husband and I love mushrooms and this truly satisfied. I also added some parmesan cheese and had to add the broth earlier to whisk in the flour. Will make this again!!

So many good ingredients...Such a waste! Neither my husband or I liked this one.  Maybe it was just us.  I felt that the dish needed something.

Because the recipe just stated mushrooms I used Portabello and the taste was amazing.  My only problem with this is that the sauce was too thin.  Next time I might try more flour.

Made this and my Husband and I thought it was good.  I had added dijon mustard after the flour and chicken broth had thicken to add a little more flavor.  I will definitely make it again but not too often as it is a rich dish.

Only so-so.  The sauce tasted mostly of sour cream.  I think that if I had added parmesan cheese, like the other reviewers did, it would have been a lot tastier.

I thought this ok, but my husband must have loved it b/c the next week he asked for me to make it again. It's an easy enough recipe, especially if you have left over chicken.

VERY good!  Not hard to make either.  I halved everything except the mushrooms, we really like them.  I added some fresh lime juice to the sauce at the end.  I thought it sounded good for some reason, and it went well.  We will have this again, my toddler son loved it!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with fresh cheese ravioli instead of linguine and it dissapeared fast.  Didn't have enough pan drippings so I combined the broth with the flour and brought to a boil.  delicious!

This is a winner!!! I made this for a romantic evening with my boyfriend. I did add a little variation to it with fresh spinach & parmesan cheese. Also, instead of using flour I substituted with corn starch because I've found it doesn't clump & thickens better.

I made this with light sour cream, angel hair pasta and 2tsp minced garlic from a jar - did the rest of the recipe as written. I thought the flavor was very nice and it was great warm comfort food for winter. My picky sons age 5 and 3 liked it as well.

My lunch for next week. I kicked up the flavor a bit with some red-pepper flakes, using white pepper instead of black, and using three times the called-for garlic. Used farfalle (bow-ties), instead of linguine, for easier eating at my desk. I found the directions in how to incorporate the flour and broth a little unclear, as posted.  What I did was sprinkle the flour over the sauteed chicken chunks, stir in to make sure everything was nicely/lightly coated, and add the broth. Worked. Oh ... and I simmered the sauce with the chicken (before adding the mushroom/onion mix and the sour cream)for at least fifteen minutes, to ensure a creamy texture. Would probably be even better with some frozen peas added at the last minute. Tasty.


UPDATE: I made this dish second time, again as my lunch for the week at work. I again used farfalle (bowties), again for the same reason. This time, however, I used maitake  ("hen of the woods") mushrooms, from the "mushroom stand" at the farmers market. Good choice.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish.  It needed a bit more salt.  I did not add the salt called for and  I used homemade chicken stock and  eliminated the sour cream.   My sauce was nice and brown as I browned the mushrooms, onions and chicken in light butter.  I will have it again and may even try it with beef.  I used Wondra to thicken the sauce.

Needs a little bit more umph to it.  Added some green peppers to it.  Served with a side of Broccoli.  Next time I think I may put the broccoli in the dish.  It was a little light on the spices but an over all good dish.  Both my Husband and I liked it

It was alright. Everything but the chicken tasted fantastic. It's like it needs to marinate in something before just being thrown in with everything else. Didn't really pick up the flavor of the sauce. The rest of the dish tasted great!

A very tasty pasta.  I used orzo and ended up with a dish that was risotto-like.     To boost the flavor of the pasta a bit I cooked it just al dente and then simmered to finish cooking with the chicken/mushrooms/onion/broth mixture.  Also added some lemon pepper seasoning.

This recipe was definitely quick & fairly easy.  It's a recipe that calls for ingredients that most people have on hand. I agreed with other reviewers about the lack of flavor.  It needs more spices. Maybe just more salt & pepper?  It's kind of blah.  Topping it with parmesan when serving helps but it still needs something else.  We also tossed some steamed brocohlli (sp?) with it and that added some crunch & nutrition but it was still lacking.  The sour cream added a certain nice tang that whipping cream doesn't.  This could be a good dish if it's played around with a bit.

This wasn't bad, though I thought the flavor of the mushrooms was a little overwhelming--it was all I could taste.  May try it again without the mushrooms.

I changed it up a little bit and added cream of mushroom soup instead of chicken broth. I actually didn't expect it to be all that good, the way i threw it together. My 18 mo old son gobbled it up. The gf liked it. I thought it was DELICIOUS!

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was sooo good!! This will become one of our pasta rotations as the whole family loved it, including my 2 yr old, the sauce seemed thin at the end, so I added the pasta to the sauce pan at the end to mix together on the stove, and it absorbed it perfectly, ended up not being too thin, glad I didn't add more flour. Was even great left over.

Yes, will defininately make this again!  Very easy and huge YUM factor.  Thus far I have stayed fairly true to the recipe as posted but this is an easily adaptable and substitution friendly  dish.  I did add some fresh parmesan which is always a plus!

It went great! Relatively easy to make. Tastes GREAT!!! Only thing was that I used Knor powder for the chicken broth, which is salted... So the pasta was a little salty, which my wife LOVED. I want to try it with less sour cream next time... Maybe a little less butter.

I feel like the sour cream was overpowering and canceled out the flavors of the other ingredients like the mushrooms.

I thought it tasted way too much like sour cream. If I was going to make it again, I would cut the amount of sour cream in half and find a way to bring out more of the mushroom flavor. I was surprised at the good reviews for this dish. I didn't like it at all.

I really liked this. The consistency of the sauce was perfect for us although I did add a bit of Parmesan cheese per other reviewers suggestions. If you like stroganoff then you will love this dish. It is very similar in taste.

This was really good. It's perfectly rich on its own, no need for cheese.

This dish was very easy to make. I made it for the first time for my boyfriend and he rarely comments on the dishes I make, he loved this one. Actually asked me to make it again. We LOVE garlic so we added more along with more mushrooms.

This was a delicious, easy recipe.  I am glad that I read review which suggested adding fresh parmesan.  It topped it off nicely.  I also added extra mushrooms, extra fresh garlic, and I wish that I had added more.  I did not want too much chicken, so I only added a little over one pound.  Instead of chicken breast, I used thighs because my husband loves dark meat.  I am glad I did not add 2 pounds of chicken because about 1 and a quarter was perfect.  Next time I think I will add less sour cream.  It adds so much fat, and I tasted the sauce prior to adding the cream, and it was already delicious.  This was very simple and I was able to manage it all within 30 minutes.  Very good and EASY.

Added peas and used cornstarch in place of the flour.  OK, but probably won't make again; maybe I did something wrong, but this just doesn't have a lot of flavor.

Very good and simple pasta with shrooms recipe.  I added more mushrooms because I love the flavor.  I also used a 1/2c wine, some dried celery flakes (I didn't have fresh celery on hand) and a handful of parmesan cheese.  I think next time I might saute a 1/4c chopped sweet red bell pepper in it to give it just a bit more depth.  My husband liked this a lot and my 1 year old daughter did as well.  My 4 year old son liked..except for the mushrooms, but he's not a big mushroom eater.  He did like the flavor of the sauce though.  I think the basic sauce would go well with chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp as well.  We'll definitely rotate this recipe in every few weeks.

If you've ever had beef stroganoff this tastes very similar, just with chicken.  My boyfriend and I both loved it and I cooked recipes as stated.

Loved it, but I did add some Cavendar's Greek seasoing and switched out the butter to low-fat butter and sour cream to low fat sour cream to drop the fat content some more.

I am a beginner and I can't believe it came out so delicious. I put more garlic then what it says in the recipe. My fiance loved it.
