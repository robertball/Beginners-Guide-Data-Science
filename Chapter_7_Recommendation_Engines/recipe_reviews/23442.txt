I have made this cake more times than I can count, and I'm always asked for the recipe. If made properly, this cake will be moist, but it is important that the batter is beat for the full 4 minutes that the recipe calls for in order to activate the pudding in the cake mix. Since there are no liquids added to the cake mix other than the oil, the batter will be thick. I bake my cake for the full 75 minutes at 325 as directed on the recipe and it comes out just right every time, but not all ovens are the same. The only thing I have changed on this recipe is to toast the almonds. If you like coconut this is an exceptionally good and easy recipe. Thanks Jennifer for a great recipe!

I made this yesterday.  My husband really does not care for coconut.  He loved it.  He said this was totally DELICIOUS.  I agree.  I do catering and I will put this in my inventory of easy to do recipes. I made it in a tube pan and increased the cooking time to 80 minutes. This was so simple and the result was amazing. I will make this one over and over again. Great recipe.

I was disappointed with this.  I was thinking it was going to be moister.  It just tasted like a yellow cake with coconut in it.  It certainly wasn't bad.  Just wasn't what I expected.

mmm very tasty and moist. I did however change the recipe a bit. I used 1 teaspoon of coconut extract, low fat sour cream, and used a whipped cream frosting and browned some coconut flakes to put on top. I also cut the sugar down a bit and made them into 24 muffins. Everybody loved it! Very moist! This went perfect for my Hawaiian themed birthday party.

Well I left the coconut out because I am the only one that likes it and the cakes was still really good but it only took half the time to bake. I am not sure if it was because I left the coconut out or if the time on the recipe is wrong. Be careful and watch the cake when you are baking it. I will probably try it next time with the coconut.

This cake was very simple to make and tasted great. I baked it about 60 minutes. It was still too long. It was just a little too golden brown.  Still very tasty.

This is so easy and very rich. My daughter, 7 made this for Father's Day. Huge hit! The sour cream gives it a great texture.

Definately a keeper!  My husband LOVED it.  We're generally chocolate people, but this cake was so moist it didn't need frosting - it was excellent either way.  Thank you for this recipe!
