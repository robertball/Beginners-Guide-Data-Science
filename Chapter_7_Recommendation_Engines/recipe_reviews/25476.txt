This is easily a 5 recipe, for ease and flavor and LOW CARBS (0.8)! My BBQ was stolen, so I cooked the spareribs in the oven instead. 4 pounds of them at 350 for 1 hour. Should've taken them out after 40, as they were pretty dry. MY fault though. The flavor was great and it was oh, so, so easy. Thank you, Mr. Green!

This is an excellent rub.  I actually used it on pork chops with nothing else.  The chops came out with a great flavor that my husband and I both liked.  I have some left and will use it on other meats to see how they come out.

This was really yummy and super easy.  I used country style ribs instead of spare ribs, which cut the cook time down signifigantly.  I let the meat sit for about a 1/2 hour after spreading the rub mix on.  I turned the grill on LOW and basted with sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce when there were about 10 minutes left to cook, my boyfriend likes spicy so I used some Famous Daves Devils Spit on his as well.  The total cook time was about a 1/2 hour.

I used fresh sage from our garden, finely minced; freshly ground tellicherry pepper; 4 cloves of garden garlic pulverized in a small processor; fresh garden rosemary & thyme very finely minced; 2 tbs. fresh lemon juice; 2 tbs virgin olive oil.  Slow cooked the ribs on gas grill with a smokebox full of alder chips - 6 hours @ 225 degrees, indirect heat.  Used country-style ribs...what a great recipe! What a great dinner! Yummy! Five+ stars! Thanks for posting this!

After having enjoyed numerous recipes from this site I am sorry to say this is the worst one I have ever attempted to follow. What is meant by turning up the heat on the barbecue yet one is to cook the ribs slowly? They were mostly charcoal after just 1 hour. The only tasty part about the result was the barbecue sauce.

I was looking for a sage rub for chicken when I ran across this one and decided to give it a try....it was PERFECT. Just enough spice to enhance the flavor of the chicken but not over-powering. I'm having some friends over for ribs tomorrow and will try it again. Stay tuned!!

I used this on 12 boneless pork chops that I grilled on my grill pan.  Sooooo good!  I did spritz them with olive oil before rubbing in the mixture.  After grilling, I let them rest  to redistribute the juices and then lightly sprinkled with Lawry's seasoned salt.  Perfect and juicy! This a a keeper!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was great for spareribs!  For the last 30 minutes I used the Delicious Barbeque Sauce by blond on these website, and my ribs were awesome!  I marinated the ribs overnight and cooked them in the oven for 1 and 1/2 hours on 350 degrees

Tried this first on chicken like another reviewer..ho-hum. Second time, I made put it on pork ribs that I put in the crockpot. My family really liked it, both with and without additional BBQ sauce.

Very good! I didn't have enough sage so I added about a teaspoon more lemon pepper and it still came out really yummy. I didn't grill it, I baked the ribs at 350 for an hour. Will try again with bbq sauce. :)

This rub was absolutely perfect as is. My family does not like our ribs to taste sweet, nor full of soupy sauces. This was a perfect blend of savory spices - exactly the way we like it. Can't wait to try it on other meats. Great recipe, thank you!

I used this recipe as a base and added other ingredients to it.  I ground the rosemary and thyme in a coffee grinder to make it a powder for better coating.  I also added salt, pepper, onion powder, honey powder, and brown sugar. I liked the sweet and savory combination that the honey powder and brown sugar added.  I think a little more salt and it would have been better.  Overall not bad though.  I smoked the ribs using the 3-2-1 method.  I had to buy baby backs because the store was out of spare ribs.  That's Memorial Day weekend for you!  I used a mix of cherry and apple wood.  I attached a picture of them at the 3 hour mark.  The rack on the bottom is using this rub.  The rack on the top is using my traditional rub recipe.

We tried this recipe and it had great flavor. We are going to try the rub on chicken next. One change that we made was we arranged the grill for indirect heat for 2 hours and for the last half hour direct heat.
