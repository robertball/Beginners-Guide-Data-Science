I will not bake this cookies again.After adding the flour to the butter unless you used your hands to mix the dough the batter would not come together. The cookies bake dry and are not sweet enough. Definitely will not try it again.

This was a great recipe.  I make spritz cookies every year, but i always like to try different recipes.  The negative comments almost stopped me from using this one, but i am soooo glad i used it anyway, otherwise i would have missed a wonderful recipe. It worked perfectly in my trusty pampered chef cookie press and made the process much easier than usual.  And I am all about ease! Thanks, Carol!

Fantastic! This was only the second time I've ever made spritz cookies and it worked so much better than the recipe that came with my cookie press. I did add a smidge more sugar and I also used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and half all-purpose flour. Worked great and plan to make it my regular holiday recipe from now on!

My mom made these almost every Christmas.  Always with the tree press and green food coloring (like the photo).  I love them!

These were not to my liking; dough was too tough for a spritz cookie and they tasted like flour.

Very easy to do with my pampered chef cookie press!  I added a little extra sugar and put red cinnamon candies on top of a Christmas tree shaped cookie.  Very pretty!

These were not to my liking. No taste and hard to mix. My kids were very disappointed and I would not serve these.

This recipe turned out wonderful. I would definitely do it again. I added green food coloring and sprinkled with red sugar before baking. I used parchment paper to save on the sugar sticking to pans.
