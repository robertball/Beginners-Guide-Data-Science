I make it using Italian sausage, half mild, half spicy, heavy cream and chicken bouillon, (5 added to 10 cups of water).   No cheese needed.  Mine is a favorite with my family.

GREAT recipe!  Used recipe pretty much as it's listed.  Only change I made was I used hot sausage and I used more kale than what it called for.  Will definitely be making this one again and won't change a thing.

Fantastic! I used spinach instead of kale b/c the family prefers it and cubed my potatoes instead of slicing them. Great flavor, and if you cook off the sausage mixture and bacon a head of time, this is a snap to put together. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used 4 (cut up) slices bacon, 1/2 lb. hot sausage, 1/2 lb. mild sausage, whole onion, sauteed them up in dutch oven then added 4 cloves chopped (fresh!) garlic and 1 tsp. crushed red pepper, cooked a few minutes more. Poured in 3 cartons chicken broth, added two large sweet potatoes (thin-sliced) and four medium red potatoes (don't peel them).  Once potatoes are cooked, add large bunch kale, 2 cups whole milk, large dollop light sour cream and 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese.  Once cheese is melted, it's done and AMAZING! (added my changes so I won't forget what I did!)

OMG even my four year old ate this and asked for more! We wanted ours a bit thicker (just preference) so I cut the water to four cups and actually added one can of cream of mushroom soup.  I did not have any sausage so we used chicken...I understand what the other reviewers said about flavor- ours was really good but I will go with sausage next time for that extra kick.  This is definitely going in the rotation :)

Great recipe! Simple and delicious!
Recommend using spicy Italian sausage to add a little more flavor.

Very good version of this recipe.  We had not tried it with the sour cream instead of heavy cream.....and the sour cream worked nicely.  I think you could also make it with plain yogurt and get the same wonderful results.  I had a lot of baked potatoes in the fridge, so I used those rather than raw potatoes and subbed spinach for the kale, because I had it on hand.  This soup was so good and filling on a very cold, snowy, and blowing Indiana winter night.  We enjoyed 'Pickle-Juice Bread-Machine Bread' from AR with this soup.

This recipe is amazing!  The only thing I changed was thr quantity, which I reduced by half.  I will not make that mistake again as the leftovers were even better the next day!  I took leftovers for lunch the next day and was followed by my coworkers.   They all wanted to know what smelled so wonderful and have requested the recipe.

I may try a spicy sausage blend for the next batch, but that is more of a personal preference.  The recipie is perfect as written.

  I loved the heartly and slightly bitter bite of the kale, but that might not be for everyone.  Tip:
If you are afraid of the kale, use either baby kale or a kale and spinach blend.  Most grocery stores carry prewashed blends which would be wonderful.

The first time I make a recipe I always follow it exactly.  I figure that way I can give it an honest rating.  In this instance I see no reason to ever alter the recipe.  We love it just as it is!  Creamy, rich, filling and with just a touch of pepper.
This is excellent!  It will become one of the soups we rotate during the Fall and Winter here on the Central Oregon Coast.  My husband said he’s glad i gave it a try.

A delicious and hearty soup. Perfect for a fall meal. Hubby gave it a 9/10. I enjoyed it and didn’t even notice that it’s healthier because it tastes so good!

Didn’t have bacon so left it out.  No sour cream so I used Greek yogurt in its place.  Used extra Parmesan cheese. It was delish and will make again.  My picky hubby loved it also!

I love this kind of soup. Like any other recipe, I use it as a guide, not  gospel. I used cream instead of sour cream, added corn starch to make it thicker and omitted the kale because kale is just gross ;)

Good recipe. I used a bit more kale and bacon. Then I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream. It seemed to make it better. Oh also I used hot sausage - by accident. Intended to grab Italian but grabbed hot. So I used it. It was still amazing.

I absolutely loved this, as did my husband. I would have given it 5 stars, but after reading reviews, I used hot Italian sausage to spice it up, and it was perfect. I also used a kale/chard combination because that's what I found in my grocery store. Definitely use low sodium broth. I will definitely make this again!

This is my original version of this soup.  When I submitted it the amount of bacon was raised, I usually use about  2 slices.  Just enough for flavor.  Subbing bullion for broth, cubing rather than slicing... these aren't really substitutions since they are equivalent ingredients.   I love the little kick from the crushed red pepper.  If you substitute Italian sausage, you can leave out the red pepper flakes.

Pretty good. I will use a bit spicier sausage next time. (Was plain ground pork I seasoned.) I also used spinach as I didn't have kale and I used more than called for in the recipe. Cubed taters (personal preference.) And used milk rather than heavy cream and Greek yogurt rather than sour cream. Last minute I decided to dice up a tomato; it was a nice, fresh addition.

Delicious soup!! I didn't have sour cream or parm; so I left it out. Used chicken broth and added mushrooms and carrots because I had all of that. I'm sorry, but I often take a little artistic license when cooking. It in no way is a reflection on the original recipe, but it was fantastic. Rave reviews from hubby -- who's on his second bowl. Thank you so much for this recipe. It is definitely a keeper.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! It tasted just like the famous soup. I did use heavy cream instead of sour cream, I used hot sausage, added a lot more kale and used baking potatoes since that's what I had. I had used a different recipe last time with mild sausage and it didn't give it the kick it needed to be equivalent to the famous soup.

There isn't much more to say than thank you! This really is better than restaurant soup. I can't get enough of this. I use green onion instead and more kale, but boy oh boy is this always amazing. This is in heavy rotation at my house. Thanks again!

Loved putting in sour cream instead of cream. Will make again with varied sausages.

Giving this 4 stars only because i felt it was missing just a little something, but I couldn't put my finger on it. After reading other reviews, I think I'll try this again with spicy italian sausage, and maybe add a bit of butter and some extra kale.  This was pretty good, so i'm looking forward to trying again with just a few tweaks to fit our taste.

I used turkey kielbasa instead of Italian sausage. Might will try it next time minus the bacon.

I had to change a ton of things to keep this heart-healthy, and it was still very yummy. Thanks!

I really liked this. I had to add 2 more cups of water in addition to the 6 cups of chicken stock. I also used russet potatoes (sliced) instead of red because that it what I had. I also substituted half-n-half in place of sour cream (again because it was what I had). The red pepper flakes gave it quite a kick (I might have put a little too much but I was worried since several other review called it bland).

This soup was awesome. I made a few additions.  I added swiss chard and red bell pepper I had on hand and a 12oz can of evaporated milk instead of sour cream.  It tasted just like Olive Garden.  My boyfriend who hates kale loved the soup. He also said it needed more spice (he gave it a 4) but I am a spice wuss so I thought it was great. Will make it again for sure.

This soup is hearty and full of flavor. I didn't change anything. Second day was just as tasty! Served it with a basic green salad.

The soup wasn't bad, but I found it to be pretty bland. Next time I will use Italian sausage, and/or add some Italian seasoning (I just used plain pork sausage this time). I also think next time I will use heavy cream instead of sour cream. Overall,though, a good basic recipe.

This turned out great! I had spinach on hand but still turned out great! Next time I will be sure to grab some kale. We have plans for making it again next week. Great recipe thanks for sharing!

This was a great soup.  Made it as written.  A couple of the other recipes for zuppa toscana called for using a dutch oven, which I don't have.  This recipe was easy and both the husband and I loved it.  Will make it again.  Might try fresh spinach instead of kale, but the kale texture went well with the soup.
