I made this but used almost double the brown sugar.  I also cooked in a 9x13 pan for more like 30 min then cut into bars while warm and boy is this good!  Especially if you like brown sugar! It ends up nice and chewy.

I tried this recipe again and made a few changes.  I added 1/2 tsp. of maple extract to the maple syrup to add taste.  Then, when the cookies were almost cooled, I glazed them with a mixture of sifted icing sugar, milk and maple extract.  Use the back of a spoon to spread over cookie, then let set.  These turned out wonderful!  I cut them in the shape of maple leaves.

I make these quite often (they retain shapes nicly).  They're also handy (sturdy) when you have to send goodies in the mail.  Great flavor and nice texture (I tend to underbake these slightly).

Nice hint of maple flavour.  Just watch that you don't bake too long - they get rather hard!

Very delicious!  I liked the hint of maple (I added a little extra syrup) and the crispy texture.  Enjoyed by everyone who tried them.

These were delicious.  I cut them out with a maple leaf cookie cutter and colored the dough with orange, gold and burgundy food colors to look like fall leaves. Thanks for a great recipe.

Will not make again.  The cookies weren't very flavorful and were too crisp for my taste.  I much prefer traditional shortbread.

I ended up cutting the recipe in half with the exception of the brown sugar and the maple syrup i added about a 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1 cup of brown sugar. I also rolled it out to a half inch on a cookie sheet and cut it into bars which turned out nice and chewy

This recipe is very easy to make with children and they enjoy using cookie cutters to cut out various Christmas shapes, however, the baked cookies are very greasy tasting and crisper than regular shortbread.  I would not make them again.

Reading the other reviews, I must have made this wrong. My cookies spread like crazy, which is a shame since we were trying to make decorated sugar cookies. I did double the recipe; perhaps this one's not good for that. They are delicious, however, so I give them a 5 for taste but a 2 otherwise.

Sorry, not often I write negative reviews but these are definitely not shortbreads.   Perhaps they should be called maple cookies.

This was my first attempt at making shortbread and I don't think I will use this recipe again. Mine look beautiful, but they mostly just taste like flour. I think 4 1/2 cups of flour is far too much and 1 1/2 is not enough sugar. Also, 1/2 inch thick at 20 minutes doesn't cook all the way through. I think this recipe needs some tweaking.

I just finished making these about 20 minutes ago - they turned out really great! I did mess with the recipe a bit, though - I was going to try to make them a bit lighter, like my mom's whipped shortbread, then put it through the cookie press. I thought I'd do that by creaming the butter, sugar, and syrup together, and then sifting in the flour a little at a time, and then whipping the dough. 
I didn't end up using the cookie press - the first two sheets got rolled into balls, then flattened. They turned out well, but then my mom suggested I add jam. I rolled the dough into balls, made and indent with my finger, then added jam into the indent, turning them into a type of thumb-print cookie. They turned out really well! Strawberry jam goes really well with the maple shortbread dough.

I made this recipe for the residents of the nursing home where I work as a treat to go along with a travel video about Canada.  This was one of the easiest and tastiest cookies I have ever made.  I had little maple leaf cookie cutters and made some in the small size, then switched to a round cutter and just made a maple left impression on the top of each cookiel.  They came out so cute.  The trick is to take the cookies out of the oven at exactly 20 minutes.  Otherwise they will get too crispy when they cool.  The residents loved them.

Just cooked a batch of these cookies for a Canadian event.  I rolled them 1/4 inch thick and they turned out lovely.  Some I did roll a bit thinner and they turned out crispier.  I did add 1/2 cup of real maple syrup (to make sure the flavour came through) and the taste was perfect.

These taste pretty good, but not at all like maple. Also, they are not suitable for cut-out cookies. I cut mine into stars and they exploded. I could not put them on my gift trays because they were so ugly. Also, too crumbly to cook them in a pan then cut into squares. Just avoid this one.

I cut them into little maple leaf shapes, and was going to take a picture, but then my family ate them all up before I could.  They didn't even last three days in the house!!

There is no way this is the correct proportions for this recipe.  If you make as is, you will end up with a powdery mess of unincorporated flour and no way to form a dough.

Loved these cookies. I cut the recipe in half except for the maple syrup, I left that at 1/4 cup. Rolled the dough to 1/2" and made round cookies, approximately 1 1/2 in diameter and got 33 cookies. I did not cook them any longer than the 20 mins.

Great recipe.  Just the right amount of maple flavor.
I made them with a Maple leaf cookie cutter.  Looked great!
I am going to make them for my son's wedding in Muskoka next summer, to put in little gift bags in the guests rooms

Excellent cookies!! I made these for a friend who is a shortbread fanatic and I also made traditional Scottish shortbread. These were gone long before the traditional ones!
