Just made this for my husband's brew party. Turned out really well. Everybody loved it. It was very moist and tender. I didn't use the roasting bag but did it in a Nesco roaster. Delicious. Will definately make this again!

Just tried this and the family gave it rave reviews (even my husband who hates turkey complimented it 4 times). I didn't' have a cinnamon stick so I left it out. Delicious moist no one thing over powers and the color was picture perfect! Please note that using the cooking bag does decrease the cooking time considerably for your turkey (I did a 14 pound bird un-stuffed in 2.5 hours).
