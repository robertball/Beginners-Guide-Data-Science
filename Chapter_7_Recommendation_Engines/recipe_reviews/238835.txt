This is an easy, family favorite.  Don't let it fool you... the rich, cream cheese layer blends well with the pudding layer creating a fabulous party for your taste buds!  Directions say to layer cool whip on top of cream cheese but its really cool whip on top of the pudding.
Not a fan of chocolate:  same recipe with your favorite flavor pudding - lemon?  top w/nuts, shaved chocolate, toasted coconut.   Get creative!

This recipe is great - it reminds me of my childhood!  Always a staple dessert at family gatherings.  My grandma usually sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the 4th layer.  Thank you for posting this.
