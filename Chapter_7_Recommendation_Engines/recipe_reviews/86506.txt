This was pretty good, alot of flavor and very quick to make. I marinated the steaks for 30 minutes and they tasted very nice, I just used a gallon plastic bag and put in 2 steaks and got both steaks flat. About halfway through marinating them I just flipped the bag over to help the process. Next time I will marinade longer for more flavor and maybe add some hotter spices to liven it up some more. Very good though!

Not something unforgetable but this was a really good marinade that I will make again.  I cubed a beef filet, and make kabobs out of it.

I ended up marinating this overnight because we were invited out with friends-its was waaaaaay to salty. I think its worth another shot though- next time I'll marinate for the recommended time.

Absolutely love this recipe, the only thing I do differently is marinate for 6-8 hours and I also add about 1/2 tablespoon (or a bit more) of crushed red pepper flakes to add a bit of a kick.  Then I thinly slice it and serve on toasted crusty rolls.

I followed the advice of another review and added a little more seasoning just before putting on the grill and it worked nicley.

Soaked for 6 hours and it came out great.  I am not one who throws 5 stars out very often.  This one is 5 stars.

Marinated overnight. Was decent, good, but nothing special. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the citrus, he usually just does montreal steak seasoning, but I liked it. The leftovers were good two days later!
