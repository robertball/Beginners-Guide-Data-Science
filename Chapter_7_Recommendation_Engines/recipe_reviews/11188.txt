I have used egg paint several times for all kinds of occassions.  I just love it, and it's fun for kids to do to.  It's a lot less messy than sprinkles (and cheaper, too!), but if you really want the sugar add some plain sugar to the paint, or sprikle some on after you paint. This is great for a group to do too.  All you need is some of those cheap little water color brushes for kids from the dollar store.  Eggs paints let you be creative, and even if you your not an artists the cookis look so pretty anyway!  Try this if you haven't already ;O).

This paint does not expand (even if your cookie does) as it bakes.  Does make beautiful jewel tone colors, though.

Real easy and works very well!  I divided the egg and put it in separate bowls and made each one a different color - the kids had a great time!

I used this to paint fall colors on sugar cookies that were in the shapes of leaves.  I used Wilton icing colors (which is super concentrated food coloring).  I'd say I used a hearty glob on a toothpick for each color (how's that for exact measurements).  The colors were vibrant and shiny.  Will definitely make again!!

Wonderful!  I copied the fall leaves and they turned out beautifully.  I also added 2 or 3 drops of Maple Extract to flavor the wash slightly.

This was so easy and my cookies came out looking great. I actually just used half a yolk and some food coloring (2 egg yolks to make 4 colors) and painted designs on egg shaped sugar cookies. The colors were bright and it couldn't have been easier. I will remember this when Christmas rolls around!

I just tried this on sugar cookies with my kids.  They had so much fun.  They didn't even want to use the sprinkles (which are messier and more expensive).  The cookies turned out beautiful.  This will definitely become a new tradition for our family!

Used this recipe with the best rolled sugar cookie recipe from this site.  This was a blast!  I will be using this recipe every time we decorate sugar cookies.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I LOVE IT!!! I used some almond flavoring with it and it was GREAT.  I used red food coloring and added red sugar sprinkles, froze them for about 15 mins and baked.  They look professional! I will always do this with my sugar cookies!

I added a little water (maybe 1/2 tsp) to my yolk. I only needed a tiny bit of "paint", so I divided it and colored it pink, teal, and purple. I used this to paint Easter egg shapes cut out of pie crust. The colors deepened as the shapes baked and the results were very pretty. I used these to top a pumpkin pie. This is a great method for adding color without adding sugar.

This recipe is so simple, yet great. My grandsons had the best time painting sugar cookies and they turned out so pretty. Thanks for this tip. We love it!

Fun to use!  I liked the look and color. I added a bit of sugar to sweeten it since I usually use frosting/icing on sugar cookies.  It didn't stretch as far as I wanted though...I went through a lot of eggs,

I found this very easy - the only thing, one egg yolk does not go so far, especially when dividing and making different colors. To get a little more mileage out of the one egg yolk â€“ I used a little crystal sugar to add to the mix and  stayed with colors that would work well with yellow as a base.
