Delicious! I would suggest drying the potatoes before putting them into the hot oil or it will cause the oil to violently splatter and can cause injury or a fire. Other than that, these were very easy to make and very, VERY addicting. The whole family LOVED these...a keeper for sure~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Even for a starter like me, this recipe was easy. The only problem was the time for the potatoes to be immersed in water (with salt solution) was not mentioned. I soaked it for more than 10mins and the potatoes turned out really salty even without the remaining salt being sprinkled on top. I guess soaking it  for 5-10 minutes would be enough.

It was very good, but it took forever to fry, and the consistency isn't very "Potato chipy". I used a mandolin to cut up my potatoes and they kept sticking to the bottom of the pan. It was also a little out of my salt range. But despite all of that is was good.I 'll probably make it again (because I have a bunch of potatoes to use up).
