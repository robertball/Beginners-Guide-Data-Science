Pretty darn tasty.  I think next time I'll add a can of corn and some cream of mushroom soup instead of the tomato sauce.  I loved the green beans in this and the cheese & egg mixture on the crescent rolls.  I used 2% cheese so the texture was a bit off but all in all, pretty good.  Oh, and like another reviewer, I put some fried onions on top before baking.  Made for a little bit of good crunch.

This was great!  My husband and I loved it, although I have to say I changed a couple things since I didn't have everything on hand.  I left the egg out, I used the italian cut green beans (they were frozen and so was my bell pepper mix so I cooked those first and added them to the beef mix later), I used a can of tomato soup instead of sauce 'cause that's what I had, and I put some french fried onions on the bottom and top of the pie.  It was excellent and will be in the menu rotation at our house now.  Thanks for a fun new recipe for ground beef, and I will forever use crescent rolls as the "pie crust" for all meat pies.  It's SO much better!

Wonderful, easy and delish!  The only differences I made was 1) I used 1 TB minced garlic instead of garlic salt. 2.) I used an 8x8 glass dish and put 4 triangles on the bottom and then topped it with the remaining 4 triangles. 3.) I ommited the green pepper as 1 of our kids has an aversion to them.  Other than that, I followed exactly.  The entire family loved this! Thanks for sharing:)

Awesome! I was crazy about this! My husband and son really liked it too, but I'd have this every other day!! lol - I followed the recipe exact and put another package of crescent rolls on as a crust on top too. It filled the pan quite full so I put another pan beneath it and that was helpful because it did bubble over a little. I wouldn't change a thing, it was just so delicious!!

My husband raved about this simple to make dinner. I used ground turkey to make a low fat version, otherwise I stuck to the recipe. I think next time I'll season it with a bit of ground black pepper.

I have been making this recipe for a few years and it always goes over really well.  Even picky eaters will love it and it's great for busy families.  It's super fast and easy and really satisfies big appetites.  My husband loves the cresent roll crust so much that he likes for me to put it over the top as well.  I have to watch it and sometimes cover with foil if it gets too brown.

My husband loved this!! He made sure that the leftovers were gone in a timely fashion. I thought it needed a little something more and i'm going to omit the egg next time. But overall, a really good and quick meal.

This was very good!! We really enjoyed this meal. I used turkey instead of beef and added some parmesan cheese to the meat. Other than that small change, I folled the directions and it turned out great! Will be making again :)

I made this last night and thought it was pretty good!  My husband said it was a solid 2-3, and I thought it was a 4, so I averaged.  My 13 month old daughter liked it, too!  I had a little difficulty getting the crescent roll triangles to fit in the pie plate, but it did work.  Also, I didn't have garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and it tasted great.  It was pretty easy to make and I'll probably make it again.  I took it out of the oven after about 18 minutes b/c it was nice and brown (even the cheese on top) and I was afraid it would burn if I left it in longer.  I think next time, after about 18 minutes, I'll use foil to cover the crust edge and cook a little longer as the bottom could have been cooked a little more.  It's very cheesy, so if you like cheese, this is a good one!

This was excellent.....Except I added frozen corn to the meat mixture, used the ranch dressing instead of egg wash as others suggested and lastly I used up some filo dough instead of croissant dough. Butter up the filo dough between layers, but oh so good. Definitely on the must makeagain list!

My family and I thought this was a very good meal, and easy enough for me to make. They all said this one is a keeper. I did make a couple of adjustments to meet my family's likes, one was substituting celery for the green pepper and adding a can of mushrooms. I also did not add the garlic salt and instead bought tomato sauce with basil, garlic and oregano already added, other than those changes I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for a great easy recipe.

This was really good. Everyone enjoyed it and didn't have any leftovers! I used a TB of garlic instead of the garlic salt. The only other thing I did different was to add some french fried onions to the top of the pie in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great success !  Even my picky 4 year old liked it.  I did have to change a few things:  I used pizza sauce with a touch of BBQ sauce for added flavor.  As another reviewer suggested, I put french onions on top generously to form a crust-like top.  After cooking for 20 min. I covered the top with foil to prevent burning and cooked for 10ish min more, which allowed the bottom fully cook

I tried this out of desperation.  I had a bunch of tomatoes and green beans and I didn't want another salad.  I gutted and cooked several tomatoes down into a paste and precooked my green beans in the microwave.  I cooked some bacon until it was crispy and browned the onions and green pepper in a bit of the leftover grease.  I only had a handful of grated mozzarella so it lacked in cheesiness.  It turned out my green beans were stringy and awful so I had to pick them out of the finished product, but it was still very tasty.  I will try it again with better beans and cheddar cheese.  I'm keeping the bacon, though.

This recipe is easy and yummy I used what I had in the house, red pepper instead of green pepper, Italian green beans, substituted with vegetarian ground beef and skipped the egg I also put a crescent top on about 12 min before it was done. I will be making this again thank you!
