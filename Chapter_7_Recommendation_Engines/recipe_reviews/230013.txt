Delicious! I added a teaspoon of chipotle for flavor. Very light! Then garnished with Sour Cream :)

Whole family loved this meal.  I squeezed 1/2 lime into the chili.  Thank you for this recipe, it will become a regular Winter meal.  FYI - AS written, with no optional ingredients a 1 1/2 cup serving = 5 points with WW points plus.

Been making this for years.  Excellent.  Only 2 changes I make is I use ground chicken instead of turkey and substitute cannellini beans for the kidney beans - personal preference.  I always double it and freeze some.

We added a clove of garlic, a chopped bell pepper, a chopped jalepeno pepper, the juice of half a (large, juicy) lime, and used tomatos with chili peppers.  Good stuff; could have used a little more chili powder for more flavor, but good and quick.  Topped with sour cream and cornbread good on the side.

Didn't have ant tomato sauce so I used picante sauce. Worked out well and froze the extra as there were only two of us.

Great starter recipe but we needed more spice.  Tripled the chilli powder and added a jalape√±o pepper as well as a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce.
