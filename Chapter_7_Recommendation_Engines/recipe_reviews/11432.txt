These are delicious, chewy cookies. The almonds are a nice touch. The liquor smells strong in the dough, but is not really evident in the finished cookies. I did cut the chocolate chips back to 2 cups. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've been looking around for a good basic cookie recipe, and found it here. I omitted the alcohols and added cinnamon, nutmeg and a pinch of mixed spice to make cinnamon cookies, and they were divine - crisp on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside. The only problem is that they're highly addictive -  they're all gone after baking 16 last night! I'm keeping this recipe for future use.

I cut the chocolate chips to 2 cups, and even then it seemed like a lot of chips. Although the cookies tasted fine and were generally liked by others, I have to say that they were not particularly impressive. They weren't different or interesting. They just tasted like slightly too sweet chocolate chip cookies. If you're looking for a twist on chocolate chip, this isn't it. Also, the recipe says 30 cookies, but I made chips ahoy size cookies and it came out to about 70.
