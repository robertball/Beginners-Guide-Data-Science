Terry's right, you won't believe how good this is! Obviously, you have to be a grapefruit lover to enjoy this, and that I am! I used the sectioned mixed grapefruit that was recommended and it took less than 5 minutes to put this together. If you do the math, 3 oz. gin per 8 serving dishes comes out to a generous 2 tsp., not one. You could get away with buying one mini-bottle of gin for this recipe or add the extra to each salad, that's what I did and it wasn't strong at all. Luckily for me, I'm the only one in the house who appreciates grapefruit so this salad was all mine!
