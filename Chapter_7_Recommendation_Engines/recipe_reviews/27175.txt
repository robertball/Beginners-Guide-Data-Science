I have this recipe "almost" but I add a couple of sliced carrots celery fresh garlic fresh jalapeno and a can of Rotel undrained. I also use 2 or 3 cans of broth. In other words it is a really good base soup and you can add whatever your family enjoys to it.

Great soup! I think next time I'll add more chicken broth so it's a little more "soupy"! Thanks Sarah!

The soup was okay. Not exactly what I'd call a fiesta. Adding lime juice directly to the soup helped. Also real garlic instead of powder is best. It was quick to make I'll give it that much. I dunno it needs something else.

A nice place to start. For the most part I started out following the directions. I did replace the bell pepper with diced canned chilies as I didn t have a pepper on hand and thought the mild chilies were in keeping with the Fiesta theme. I also used hominy in place of the corn just personal preference. When the soup was done I did a taste test and although good it simply didn t shout FIESTA I personally prefer a more spicy and robust flavor. I proceeded to add cumin oregano fresh minced garlic original Rotel tomatoes and a wedge of jalapeno pepper. I removed the jalapeno and discarded after the soup had simmered a bit. I also increased the amount of broth. I made my own chicken stock and added the rice directly to the pot. I had made lobster stew for my husband and made this soup for myself as he doesn t care for hominy. For lunch we were having leftovers hubby took a taste of this soup and fell in love with it had to heat him a bowl! Said he liked the hominy in this dish! What a shock! Give the hominy a whirl its bland flavor compliments the spicy flavors and the chewy texture makes for a nice comfort food. A definite keeper with the changes.

So easy to make and tasty - I didn't alter the spices at all. I doubled the recipe for an event at my daughter's school and I used one red and one green pepper for added color.

Very tasty and easy to make recipie. I substitute pasta (angel hair or thinner) for the rice and sometimes just use 1/4 to 1/2 a cup broth to season the veggies and pasta. This makes it a great pasta dish when you're not in the mood for soup.

it made me kinda upset that it wasn't more of a soupy like soup. It tastes great but I would add more chicken broth for next time!

Add one can of rotel (undrained) to make it spicier and soupier. I also sauted celery in with my onions and used real garlic. I threw in some diced fresh mushrooms as well. It tasted really good and the rotel really gave it some kick.

I had to double the amount of chicken broth in order to make it "soup " which in turn made it bland tasting.

This soup was great after I added some things to it. I increased the amount of the rice and water and then added jalapeno peppers to it. It helped spicy up the dish.

My family and I thought it was great. Next round I think we'll add little bit of more to it.
