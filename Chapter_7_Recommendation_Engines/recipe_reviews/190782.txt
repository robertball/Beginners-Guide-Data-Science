I have been making it this way for 49 years.  I usually add an extra egg and 1 to 1-1/2 lbs extra lean ground beef.  I also put a layer of catsup on the top before cooking.  The tomato soup makes a great tasting sauce.  I still have my old Campbell Soup cookbook that I received as a shower gift almost 50 years ago.

My husband LOVES meatloaf but complains that I put too much onion in it. The onion soup mix eliminated that problem! Delicious! We put ketchup on top instead of the tomato soup.

I made this as written except that I mixed all of the tomato soup in with the meatloaf.  The recipe lives up to its name.

This meatloaf was pretty good.  I mostly followed the recipe.  I only had 1.5 lbs of ground beef and I added a one chopped up bell pepper.  Also, I didn't use the other half of the soup for the topping because I used ketchup instead.

Love this meatloaf and so does my 7 year old picky eater!  Only change I make is in the sauce.  I use the remaining condensed soup but mix with ketchup and honey and drizzle over the meatloaf when there's about 20 minutes remaining of cook time.

This was incredible!  It was the first time I ever made meatloaf and it was surprisingly simple.  It came out extremely moist and my husband and son completely inhaled it!  Definitely recommend!

Everyone loved this meatloaf.  It was a little salty for me though. But, it was still really good.  It had good flavor. I will make this again.

This was awesome!!  made it as written, but, instead bred crumbs I used crushed seasoned croutons left over from a Thangsgiving stuffing mix. I also used 2/3 of the soup in the mix, and laid 1 full strip of apple smoked bacon, along w/remaining 3rd of the soup across the top before baking. Moist and delicious! I served it w/oven mac and cheese and steamed veggies. It created a perfect, hearty Wisconsin winter plate!

Wonderful and simple.  I realized I didn't add the water - but didn't need it.  I just put the rest of the tomato soup on top of the meatloaf in the last 10 minutes.  Soo good!  Husband at 3 pieces and said - this is going to make the best sandwiches!  I will make again for sure!

I added a few spices to the meat loaf (italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, worchestershire sauce, red pepper flake) and because I'm out of croutons, I used equal amounts Texas Toast croutons that I ran through the food processor. When I made the gravy, I sauteed some chopped onion and fresh garlic in a little butter until browned, then added the water, tomato soup and some dried basil and dried oregano. This was good, I think if I hadn't added spices, it would have been very bland. That said, this was a very moist meat loaf.

I got a Campbell's cookbook when I got my own apt over 20 years ago, and this is one of my favorite recipes! Great with either tomato or mushroom soup. Can't go wrong, and it's very easy!

This was a good meatloaf recipe - I liked this better with the dried onion soup mix better than recipes with fresh onions...I added about 1/4 cup brown sugar to the sauce and would have preferred it thicker...That is my only improvement needed!

I made this with "Meatloaf Mix" (a blend of meat - pork, veal, beef,...) from our local grocery store and it was a hit!  My kids LOVED it! :)

This was awesome, and I mistakenly used regular tomato soup instead of low sodium.  I wish I had used 2 eggs as another person suggested because it did need a little more 'binding' material.  I omitted the water, and just used the entire can of soup, then spread ketchup on the top after baking.  This was so easy & fast compared to my standard one in which I have to cut and saute' onions and bell pepper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Sometimes I use corn flakes instead of bread crumbs and it gives it a different but very good taste.

Super easy and yummy.  Even the picky boyfriend liked it. I didn't care for the tomato soup sauce that it's served with though. Next time will experiment with just adding the rest of the soup to the loaf.

The best meatloaf I ever tasted. The only change I made was that I used a whole can of tomato soup instead of half a can.

This is good, but not enough eggs.  I usually use 10-12 eggs.  Really brings out the meatness.  It was Nunpunch's suggestion.

I made this for the first time tonight, and I was wary at first because my husband has been really picky lately and we were having company.  I served it with Au Gratin potatoes and mixed vegetables, and brownies for desert.  It was a huge success!  My husband had two helpings and requested that I save the leftovers for his lunch tomorrow!  The only things I did different were to add some ketchup to the mix, and use ketchup as a glaze rather than the tomato soup and water combination.  I didn't use the onion soup because neither of us like onions, and the meatloaf still had plenty of flavor!  I will definitely be making this dish again!

My new go-to meatloaf recipe!  Love it.  As other comments mentioned, you can do this recipe with only 1 to 1 1/2 pounds of beef.

This was ok. It had a very strong onion soup mix flavor that my boyfriend and I weren't a big fan of. I also prefer oatmeal to breadcrumbs in meatloaf as it makes the texture much lighter and fluffier. Will not be making this again.

Simple is the best!!! I hate ketchup so I was happy to find this recipe. I used french onion soup mix, msg and preservative free. Extra lean organic ground beef and two eggs. Also I used my home made low carb bread that I toasted and turned into breadcrumbs. It was very delicious served with fresh garden salad and homemade dressing.

Will not be making this one again.  I made it as written and was very disappointed considering all the rave reviews.  I found the flavor - or lack thereof - really bland.  Not a big fan of the "solid" texture either.

Love this recipe. I substitute 1/4 cup of ketchup for the tomato soup. You can also divide it into patties and cook for around a half hour for delicious meatloaf burgers.

We absolutely love this recipe. Me and the men in my household. My sons 9 & 3, and my husband thinks it is the best meatloaf ever. The only thing I did differently is use ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I also used fresh ground turkey instead of beef. The onion mix made this scrumptious! Quick, easy, and delicious! Who would have ever thought a hunk of meat can taste so good!

This is one of the few meals that my guy begs for.  I substitute Ground Turkey for the Ground Beef - and no one notices.  I always find difficulty keeping turkey moist, but the tomato soup takes care of that.

I really like this recipe, my husband loves meatloaf and I find it just okay, I made this at a family dinner and my parents really loved it too.  Of all the meatloafs I have made I definitely like this one the best, I am pretty genrous with the tomato soup and normally put in more then the recipe calls for as I hate dry meatloaf

This is, aptly named, the best ever meatloaf.  My family loves this recipe because it's juicy and perfectly seasoned.  Also, the tomato gravy is great!  I grew up on meatloaf and ketchup and always thought it was 'almost' right.  I had no idea that tomato soup was the answer!  This is also SO EASY.   My only substitution is oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs, because I always have oatmeal on hand.  Love this recipe.

I LOVE this meatloaf. My only complaint is that there isn't more sauce, but I don't know how I'd make more without opening another can of soup! It's also good with a little bit of worcestershire sauce, or Italian instead of plain bread crumbs.

My six year old rated this 10 stars and said it was "pretty good!" That's enough for me to make it again. Mu husband got bad heartburn, though, from the tomato soup.

Delicious!!! My toddler rarely eats meat of any kind no matter how I prepare it. I made this for dinner last night with a side of steamed veggies and he cleared his plate! I did add cubes of cheese to the meat mixture because my family loves cheese in meatloaf. I also tried a sauce based on another review. I mixed the leftover tomato soup with a few tablespoons of honey and some ketchup then poured it over the top with about twenty minutes left. It tasted fantastic. Nice and moist and full of flavor. I will definitely make this again.

The flavor of this meatloaf was OUTSTANDING!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the meatloaf didn't retain it's form very well and fell apart easily.  I followed the recipe to the letter so I am not sure why this happened.  But definitely a keeper!

This was amazing. I didn't have tomato soup so I used my leftover tomato sauce, and put in a little more than was stated.  It came out delicious! The family loved it, and it was even better the next day.

I made this with a pack of taco seasoning because I was out of onion soup mix.  It tasted a bit like something from taco bell but my husband and daughter loved it.  I wouldn't make it for myself but if you have picky kids and you know they already eat tacos it might be worth a try.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe but unfortunately I found it a bit boring. I added a chopped onion and some spice to give it a kick. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. But I'm beginning to think that I'm just not a meatloaf person. For the leftovers we mixed with some simple gravy and mashed potatoes which I enjoyed it more that way.

I made this without the water and used 3/4 of the can of soup. I also added a few dried spices and some brown sugar to the mixture. When the meatloaf was done, I mixed the remaining soup with some more brown sugar and a pinch of dried mustard and brushed in on top of the meatloaf. Not only was it delicious, but has the added bonus of being quick and easy. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Excellent recipe.  I enhanced using 1 envelope onion/mushroom soup mix, regular tomato soup, and added chopped onions, garlic powder and a dash of worcestershire.  It was very tasty!  Gobbled up the leftovers too!

Made a few adjustments to the recipe; I did add a little garlic and some bell pepper to the mixture.. The tomato soup was really good in this recipe and I did only used about half of the onion soup mix because it can be very salty but I will be making this again.

I thought it was very good. My husband loved it! I used all of the soup and put ketchup on the top.

This was a very easy to make meatloaf.   I made just a couple of change: I didn't make the sauce, I just mixed the rest of the soup with the water and poured it on top of the loaf and baked it.  I added salt, pepper, garlic salt and minced garlic.  So yummy.  I made it bigger and just added some ketchup and extra breadcrumbs.  My family loved it and my daughter's friends too.  I will make this again.

How could something this simple be so good? I was suspicious. I made the recipe as written, and the only thing I will change next time is to use a second can of tomato soup, because hubby likes more sauce.
I made the meatloaf early in the afternoon and let the flavors from the onion soup bloom in the meat mixture.
