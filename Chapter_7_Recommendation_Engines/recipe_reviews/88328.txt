I added a a few cloves of fresh minced garlic, half teaspoon of ground cumin and a good amount fresh ground pepper. Because I like my salsa a little "wetter", I threw half of the diced tomatoes in the blender with half of the onion, one of the diced red peppers, half of the cilantro and the garlic. I pulsed it until it was the consistancy I was looking for, then folded the contents of the blender into the remaining salsa ingredients. Very tasty--one of the better homemade salsa's I've made! UPDATED REVIEW: I've made this twice now and I just can't get enough of it. I used some of this today in both a chicken and rice recipe AND a black bean/corn "salad" and it was fantastic!

This recipe was easy to make.  It didn't have a lot of ingredients or require cooking.  I used a food processor to dice so it was a snap!  The flavors are tasty and it's neither too spicy or bland.  :)  Try it!

This is basically our "everyday" salsa, though I add jalepeno and cumin to mine. We eat it on everything from breakfast eggs to baked potatoes and it is especially yummy on burgers and chicken fresh off the grill. For a change of flavor try grilling the ingrediants over charcoal, then throwing everything in the food processor.

This dish will not stay around long, the whole is ususally gone by the 1st hour.  I add in a couple serano peppers for added spice, and to give it a tropical twist, try adding in some pineapple.

AWESOME!!!! I have NEVER made salsa before, until now.  I like to snack while I work and this will be a healthy recipe to keep made up.

This was very good.  I only used 1/2 bunch cilantro, red onion instead of sweet, and added 2 jalepenos and 2 cloves of garlic.  It was delicious the next day!!!  I prefer it as a topping on tacos, fajitas, etc. but it is good for dipping tortilla chips too.

Fresh, Fresh, Fresh!  An AWESOME recipe to use up those tomatoes from the garden that seem to come all at once- 
only 1 suggestion: Add 1 teaspoon of fresh minced garlic-YUM! & the whole lime is not too much.
I recently made a double batch and served as an appetizer paired with tortilla chips for a dinner party- My guests were demanding to know what "brand" of salsa this was!!! I referred them all to this recipe.   :-)

This was a super good recipe.  I don't know how much a "bunch" is in this recipe, but I only needed a couple of pinches of cilantro... a bunch would be out of control.  Also I didn't use as much lime juice as it said and I'd like to look for the estimated amount of the juice of "one lime."

I make fresh salsa similar to this except I add jalapeno peppers for spice. To save time, I put the ingredients into a food processor and pulse until it is to the desired consistency for my family.   Sometimes our ingredients will vary based on what is in the garden.  Not uncommon to find cucmbers in our salsa at the peak of season.

Very good, very fresh-tasting.   We used half an onion (a large one) and a green pepper, for lack of a red and yellow one.  We used Aneheim peppers, which added just a light touch of heat.  Good as-is, but with potential for many different tastes from this point.

This is a bit time consuming but the end result is well worth it. We absolutely love this recipe and eat almost all of it at one time. Lovely in the  summer.

We like a spicy salsa, so I added 3 serrano peppers.  This is undoubtedly the best salsa I've ever made or eaten.

This was much more a pico de gallo than what I'd consider a salsa. Good none the less, very 'fresh'. Next time I'll add some fresh garlic.

Yummy!  We only used green peppers and I added corn to give it a little sweet, but fantastic.

Really fresh and yummy!  I like mine a little saltier, so I also added 1 tsp of garlic salt.

Very quick to make. Great flavours. I added jalapeno, for some spice, and green peppers to add a little more colour. Perfect for summer.

I even added a jalepeno (seeded) and thought it was still missing something.  So did my husband and 4 guests...  Threw out 99% of it.

Gave this recipe 4 instead of 5 stars because it really does need the garlic that others mentioned.

We had a bunch of garden tomatoes, and a bunch of unused cilantro from another recipe, so we searched for a salsa recipe that would use what we had. We did make a couple changes right off the bat - used green pepper instead of yellow, and we added a seeded jalepeno for some heat. We chopped everything in a food processor to make it a little "wetter". It was good the first night, but the flavors seemed to be missing a little something. You get a strong sweet taste at first, followed by the cilantro, and then the heat/acid. What was missing was garlic (as others have said). We added garlic and a little more salt before going to bed, and it is ALOT better today. Partly because of the time for the flavors to meld, and partly because this recipe really does need garlic. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the only salsa recipe I use...the only change is I don't use bell pepper, I use jalapeno. This is the best, most fresh tasting salsa you will ever be able to make at home! The closest thing I've found to our local mexican restaurant!

The original recipe is a pico de gallo.. but I used my food processor and pulsed til it was more salsa like.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, some medium green chilies, a tad bit of lemon juice and less cilantro.  Made a nice big batch for last us a few days!  Very good salsa!

We absolutely loved this recipe.  It was time consuming due to chopping all the veggies.  I will probably start chopping the night before or purchase a food processor.  This was so good and very easy.  I will make this again and again.

This recipe is so simple and delicious!  The only modification I made, was I left out the red bell pepper and chopped up a few hot peppers I had grown in my garden, just to give a little heat.  But I did everything else exactly the same.  It was delicious, and my husband can't get enough of it.

This rates 4 stars simply because it doesn't call for jalapenos. I've made this recipe for years, but always add the hot peppers. Utilize your food processor on this and prep will be a snap.

Wonderful fresh salsa, much like pico de gallo.  I did mince half a large jalapeno in as well, also added some minced garlic.  Topped our layered dip with this.

Good basic fresh salsa recipe.  We like a little kick to our salsa; so we made a few additions.  Added diced jalapenos (with and without seeds) and 1 tsp of minced garlic.  Consider your desired level of spice when adding the jalapenos.. I added 4 diced peppers and that was perfect for us.  Salsa is so flexible.. don't be afraid to experiment with your desired tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make mine similar to this one yet I don’t add bell peppers at all.  I use 8-10 Roma tomatoes along with 2-3 minced cloves of garlic, diced green chilies, one jalapeño, one bunch of cilantro, juice of one lemon and one lime, teaspoon of cumin, salt and 4-5 dashes of Tobasco sauce.

Served it at a cookout and it was delicious. I did add a little cumin, minced garlic, and a pinch of cayenne powder. I will reduce the amounts when making it just for me and my wife. Goes very well with scooper chips. Will make again.

This is a GREAT base recipe... not even so much of a "base", as it is pretty darn good as is. I just made some slight modifications per our personal taste. 

We halved the recipe, and it was STILL a LOT of salsa! But added in some diced tomatillo, a chopped avocado, half of a pablano pepper & a small jalapeño. Adding in a bit of salt, pepper, cumin & a clove or two of minced garlic really brought out the flavor! I diced everything and then refrigerated for a few hours befor stirring & serving- fantastic! 

I also use essential oils and did one drop each of lime & citrus. One drop goes a LONG way, in comparison to juicing the actual fruit. That is also a personal preference, but it turned out SO good! Will definitely have leftovers, and I prefer this to store-bought salsa any day!

Deliciously fresh tasting and delightful! I did make a few minor changes:
(1) added a large chopped "eating tomato" to make it a little "wetter" 
(2) used a purple onion - the added color made the presentation amazing
(3) added two finely chopped jalapeno peppers for a little bit of heat. 
My friends and husband are still talking about it a month after I made it!

Very simple and very good. I made it with some home-grown tomatillos, and this was the first time I had tasted this crop. The salsa was surprisingly sweet, when compared to bottled Herdez salsa verde. The jalapeños and onions were also home-grown. I seeded the peppers. Next time, I think I'll leave a few seeds and ribs in, as I would like the salsa just a little 'hotter'. But I'm from Texas; your mileage may vary.

Fabulous, especially when made with 'maters from the garden!  I followed recipe exactly, except added some leftover corn-on-the-cob, a chopped jalapeño, and about 1/4 t. of cumin.
