Yummy recipe :] I used yellow potatoes, and I added onion to my stew for extra flavor. It turned out very well. My boyfriend liked it so much he had two bowls for dinner, and one the next day for breakfast!

It tasted very bland. I think it needs tomato sauce or ketchup to liven the dish up. And, there was way too much potatoes. Didn't like it at all!

Absolutely delicious. I added cilantro to mine and took the potato peel completely off.
