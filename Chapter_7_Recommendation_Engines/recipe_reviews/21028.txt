This is exceptional and easy to prepare. I modified it slightly in two ways: 1) added 1 tsp salt to temper the sweetness and make it more a true chutney and 2)pureed 3/4 of the mixture to make it more suitable for spreading on crusty bread or crackers with herbed brie. It was a hit with my holiday guests and made an excellent gift for the neighbors.

LOVE THIS! Only change I made (we all make changes even though we love a recipe!)...I use orange juice instead of water to boil cranberries and dried apricots.  Just adds 1 more layer to the flavor! I've also used dates instead of raisins.

Pretty good, the spicy flavor makes it different.

My family loves this recipe. I don't like raisins, so I use dried cherries. It's great.

Combined this with another chutney recipe I have. I didn't use an apple and I put in chili covered dried mango in place of the apricots. I also added some cider vinegar and chopped jalapenos.
