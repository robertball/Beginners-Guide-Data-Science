Too much sour cream!  We tasted the vegetable mixture prior to adding the sour cream, and the taste was incredible.  After adding only one cup of sour cream, the sauce was already too thick.  I would say half a cup of sour cream, at most, is needed.  Also, if you prefer a spicier dip, you might want to use more than the two jalapenos listed.  Our sauce was really quite mild.

To ensure it to be spicy, I included the jalapeno seeds.  I did not have three avocados, but it still worked out well.  I also added some diced avocado after blending to give it some texture.

This was fantastic! Just like the dip from the Mexican restaurant, only better!  I didn't have green tomatoes, and the red ones worked fine.  I did add some Chipotle Tabasco for some extra kick, along with some garlic salt.  Even my husband, who doesn't like guacamole, loved this dip. I am so excited that I found this recipe!  Thank you for sharing it with us!!

This was good but I think it lacked in flavor just a bit.  I only used about 1/2 cup sour cream.  Maybe adding some lime next time might help with the lack of flavor..

I am not from TX, so I'm not sure what restaurant this refers to and don't have a point of comparison.  I had some green tomatoes to use up so I figured I would give this a try (we like tex mex).  I followed the recipe closely except left the seeds in the peppers as other reviewers suggested.  This was pretty good, but not lifechanging or a standout.  My family prefers guacamole and also roasted tomatillo green salsa, so I'll make those next time instead of using those ingredients to make this, it is not bad, but it's not as good as either of those either.  It was fun to try something new though.

This was wonderful!  I made it for a mexican fiesta that we had here.  Several of our guests proclaimed that it was better than than served at our favorite mexican restaurant here - wonderful compliment.  I could not find green tomatoes so I just used all tomatillos.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing.

This was GREAT! The only issue we had with it was that it was too "pureed", so I would probably make it less soupy and maybe add another avocado in before serving that is just slightly mashed, to give it some kind of chunky texture. Other than that, WONDERFUL!

Very yummy!  I used a bit more cilantro and garlic.  I used "light" sour cream and only 1/2 cup per the other reviews.  I have had this dip at the popular Texas restuarant chain and it's almost identical in flavor and texture.

I have been looking for a recipe like this - it's JUST like at the mexican restaurants here Texas! I've been trying to duplicate this for a while - perfect!!  I would suggest adding 3/4c. sour cream instead of 1 1/2. I also added an extra jalepeno and threw in two small diced avocados at the end (they don't serve it like this at the restaurant, but my family thinks it adds a nice chunky texture).    When adding the salt (I used garlic salt and sea salt) at the end...keep adding until it suits the flavor.  The salt really brings out all of the veggies flavors!!  Be prepared for a LOT of dip...but it will be eaten for sure! I'm going to try freezing a small amount of it and see how it does - so I'll be back to let yall know!! :)

After making this 100x (I submitted this recipe years ago), I've realized that I prefer the sauce with a LOT more cilantro.  These days, I usually add 3/4 of the bunch, tasting as I add to get the right flavor.  Also, it's some times hard to find green tomatoes and so I've substituted regular tomatoes without affecting the taste.  To keep the sauce 'green' for much longer than typical, sprinkle a generous amount of 'Fruit Fresh' into the sauce.  (Fruit Fresh also works great for guacamole.)  Salt is a must in this recipe to bring out the avocado flavor, and it also pairs well with saltier tortialla chips.

It was good.  I couldn't find green tomatoes, so I had to use red ones.  I just put a few shakes of salt in, not sure how much.  It needs something, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Maybe just more salt?  Maybe more cilantro.  I only used one jalenpeno pepper, next time, I will use two.   Also, I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers, and used only 1/2 cup sour cream.  There will be a next time, it is a good sauce.

Instead of boiling the vegetables, you can roast them in a 400 degree oven for 12 to 15 minutes, then put them food processor.

I love this recipe!  I made a few changes however.  Instead of Jalapenos I used 3 serrano chiles as my family loves it spicy!  I also did not use any green tomatoes just the tomatillos that the recipe called for.  Perfect sauce.  Thank you!

This is one of my family's favorite dips! My husband requests this frequently and I always take it (along with my homemade salsa) to parties.

Only things I do different are that I use already chopped store bought garlic and eliminate the cilantro since my husband doesn't like cilantro. Also, I have started leaving the seeds in the jalapeno to add some extra spice and kick. Great recipe!

This Green Sauce is fantastic!!!  I read the reviews and decided to make it exactly as the recipes says just to test it for myself.  I love creamy dips so I added the full 1 1/2 cups sour cream and thought it was perfect!  Thanks for this recipe, my friends and family all really like it and a few have even asked for the recipe. :)

This was so-so when we made it as directed.   We decided to add juice and zest of one lime and some salt to half the recipe when we found that it was not as great as we expected.  The salt and the lime really made this exceptional! It ended up being a hit on shredded beef tacos.

Since I don't live in Texas, I am sure I have never tried the green sauce about which many have commented.  Instead, this sauce reminded me of an avocado salsa that was offered at a chain Mexican restaurant that is no longer in our area-- much to our extreme sadness.  Either way, it is delicious.  I will make this often.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  It makes us miss our former fast food Mexican place a little less...

This recipe almost gets 5 stars, but as is was way too bland. I added a ton more cilantro (I'm not sure exactly how much, I just kept adding till it tasted the way I liked it) and one more tomatillo. Once I did that it was awesome.

waaaaay to weird and creamy.  I think this might be because I was looking for a more authentic salsa verde con aguacate recipe.  Even so I could never eat this.   What a waste of three avocados.

Wonderful!  I couldn't find green tomatoes in my grocery store, so I just used regular.  In addition, I used light sour cream.  The amount of salt I used was 1/2 tsp. (perfect!).  This sauce was great served with tortilla chips!  Thanks for the recipe!

This had great flavor but I thought it had too much sour cream. I thought it would be like a salsa it was more like a dip.  Next time I will use only 1/2 cup of cream and add more if needed.

Scaled down this recipe to 4servings. Couldn't find a green tomato, so used red. Also, added alot more cilantro, salt, and Fruit Fresh to keep it green. Amazing sauce! Excellent on sandwiches, eggrolls, chicken, u name it, this is the best Avocado cream sauce I've had! Just like Chili's!

Thank you for sharing this recipe, it came out pretty good, not quite restaurant perfect but very good for me at home! I did add more things, cilantro, chilli powder, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper to the tomatillos while cooking. As a Texas girl, I added a generous teaspoon of sugar. I also added cream cheese (we like it creamy, and I added too much water when cooking the tomatillos.) Overall it was good, I am just not sure what it's missing though!

I was making this with the kids in mind as my salsa verde is just to spicy for them - I roasted the tomatoes instead of boiling and used everything else fresh - I only used one jalapeno but left the seeds in, used 1 cup sour cream and added an extra avacado, upped the cilantro to 1/2 cup and it turned out to be something like if guacamole had a baby with salsa verde - super tasty and lots of flavor without too much heat - I think I ate as much of it as the kids!

Too little tomatillos and too much sour cream. Only 8 oz max should be used for sour cream also only 3 sprigs of cilantro needed. Your proportions are off a bit.

More jalps with seeds for spice and no sour cream :) avocados make it creamy and sour cream just makes it more bland. Good stuff! Makes a lot!

This recipe was kind of bland as written, but it turned into a real treat with the addition of extra cilantro, a couple of tablespoons of fresh jalapeño pepper and a splash of lime juice.  I was concerned that the lime juice might make the sauce curdle, so I tried adding it to just a few tablespoons of the sauce.  No problems here, so I added it to the whole batch and it brightened the flavor beautifully!  We served this on top of bowls of turkey chili, which was also big on flavor, but the punched up version we made would also be great with tortilla chips as a dip.

This is a very good recipe for a green salsa.  The primary criticisms I have read regarded texture where the critics said they solved the problem by adding more avocado. In all fairness to the recipe, this is a salsa and not a guacamole recipe.

This was pretty yummy! This is closest thing I have found to what they serve along with the red salsa here in Houston. I used 2 giant jalapenos (didn't remove all of the seeds, just most) and it made for a very spicy after taste and kind of overpowered the rest of the ingredients. I think I'll use 1 giant one or two smaller ones next time and it'll be much better. It's not quite as good as my favorite mexican places' green sauce, but close!! I also added some lime juice.
