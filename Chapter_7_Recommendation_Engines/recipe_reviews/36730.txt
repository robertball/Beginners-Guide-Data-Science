We really like this recipe.  I was not sure how the olives and chickpeas were going to taste, but it was wonderful.  I used dry bread crumbs and had to use dried parsley.  The red salmon makes a big difference, so don't substitute the pink salmon.  There is not a lot of liquid, aside from the 2 egg whites, so the patties are a little dry when you pat them out....but this works out very well when they are cooked.  I really recommend you try this one.

Loved this recipe & will definately make again. Instead of cucumber sauce, I mixed together 1/2 c. sour cream, 1/2 c. mayo, 1 t. MSG, 1 t. seasoning salt, 1 t. parsley, & 1-1/4 t. dill. Tasted good w/ the salmon.

Excellent!  Will definitely make again.  I had to add one more whole egg to make them stick.  Be careful not to add too much garlic to the cucumber sauce - the yogurt really brings out the flavor.

These are wonderful.  I added in 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese b/c we can't make anything in our family w/o cheese.  This recipe is pretty forgiving-I've used white and wheat, messed stuff around and it turns out good everytime.  The original is perfect w/o any fiddling though!

This was great-especially for anyone following Weight Watchers.  I served it with couscous.

I forgot to add cumin but it still came out great. It's great the next day for lunch as well.

I really enjoyed this.  Had most of the ingredients on hand; had to pop to the store for a cuke.  Will definitely make this again.  I ate it with a simple veggie and leafy green salad.

I didn't care for this dish. The flavors just did not blend well at all.

Maybe I did it all wrong , my boyfreind liked them but I thought they lacked flavor. I wouldn't make them again for myself , but I would suggest more seasoning and mashing the chickpeas completely, I didn't find it enjoyable to bite into.  Like I said maybe I did it wrong.  I would make it again only request, under extreme pressure

I will keep this around and try to tweak it. Thankfully I tasted the mixture before forming patties...they needed much more flavour. But once I tweaked it to my liking, the flavour was very good.  They were, however, very dry in the end and could not be eaten without sauce.  Changes:
1) Used 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs with no problems.
2) Used 2 full eggs instead of just whites as per other suggestions.
3) Bland!  Had to add more salt & cumin, garlic & onion powders, paprika and taco seasoning.

Hmmm...but good otherwise.

This was really good, but I had the hardest time making them stick. Next time I will use whole eggs to hold the cakes together. I didn't drain the can of salmon and the cakes were nice and moist.

I really enjoyed this recipe - although I really made it my own!  I used leftover blackened salmon as the base, and made my own bread crumbs by microwaving a piece of bread with butter, garlic salt, and bruschetta for 1 minute. (Careful not to burn; i did that too!  :0)  I then mixed the salmon, parsley, egg, and bread crumbs along with some spinach.  I made the sauce with sour cream cause i didn't have yogurt, and ate the cakes with the sauce and fresh cucumbers and tomatoes with salt and pepper.  It was excellent and would go great in a pita!  Mmmm...

These make a great, healthy meal!  Although I liked the yogurt sauce, I prefer to eat these with a corn salsa.  Either way, they're tasty and delicious!

We enjoyed the texture and the flavor.  Cucumber sauce was a little bland but could be altered with hot sauce and a little salt.

I've made this twice for guests and it was awesome! Everyone loved it, even the kids. Followed the recipe exactly. Used Kalamata olives which added an excellent flavor. Perfect for a with a cucumber salad and some couscous and time of the year.

Where's the salmon?  There's no salmon flavor in this!   I think it was the chickpeas that totally ruined the salmon.

These salmon cakes were very tasty! I love the idea of the garbanzo beans- for extra protein and nutrients.  I served these with a greek tomato feta rice pilaf- for a satasfying meal!

This was delicious and very beautiful when served. I did add an extra egg as others suggested to help keep things together.

My whole family loves this recipe, although, we don't like the chickpeas, so I don't add them and I add extra olives, they stay moist and stick together better.
