My family and I love this, infact we just finished eating it. People have to understand, you need to season that chicken as you are browning it. We use garlic powder, seasoning salt and some black pepper, on the chicken. Make sure to stir all that good browned flavor stuck to the bottom of your pot in when you and the soups and liquid . Yes I said pot, I find that cooking in a pot allows the liquid to cover up that rice better and allow for a better absorption of all that liquid goodness. Just seems like preparing this recipe in a skillet only drys out the liquid faster and the rice tends to be on the less cooked side. We exchange chicken broth instead of water. Lastly, on top of all the ingredients listed in the recipe, I use a cup of Half & Half. It makes it extra creamy, and you will be fighting the rest of the family for seconds...

I made this for dinner tonight. I am giving it 4 stars because I made some changes. Even though tonight was the first time I made this, I wanted to add a little flavor to it since others said it was lacking. First thing, I cut up the chicken. I am currently pregnant and whole chicken breast seem to be too dry for me to eat. Secondly, I used chicken broth instead of water. I just added the broth, cream of chicken, broccoli and rice to the chicken after browning it. I let it simmer for about 7 minutes or so. My husband really liked it! His only complaint was the broccoli was not cooked to his standards (he likes it pretty squishy). We will definitely be making this again! I may try it with some squash or a different vegetable next time! =)

The way I add more flavor to mine is to substitute a can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken with Herbs soup instead of the regular cream of chicken soup. Also, you can sub milk for the water or use chicken broth. I also generously sprinkle the chicken breasts with pepper, paprika, and pepper before browning. Mine never comes out bland- try it!

I agree, this is easy to make, but hardly any flavor.  My husband and I ended up putting shredded cheese on top of it to give it a little bit of flavor.

Love this recipe.  I had it a long time ago in a recipe booklet from Campbells, but I lost it in a move.    The only thing I find is that it takes more than 15 minutes to fix this.  I like to cook most meats on med-low, so that takes a bit longer.  Robin

This recipe could be saved with a few changes which would depend on personal preference... it was very bland and the rice simply wouldn't cook through because there wasn't enough water. Husband didn't like it very much and I won't make this again.

Quick and easy but does seem to be lacking a little something and that's why I rated it 3 stars.  I spiced up my chicken while cooking it with salt/pepper/garlic powder/cayenne pepper and with that would give it another half star.  Very filling though!

I made this quick and easy recipe and my husband and children loved it but I used brown rice instead. When I looked at the recipe, it did not say to spice up the chicken but I did it anyway and it turned out great. In fact, I will be making this recipe again tonight but with pork chops. It is one of the recipes that will become a regular on my menu. Thanks.
