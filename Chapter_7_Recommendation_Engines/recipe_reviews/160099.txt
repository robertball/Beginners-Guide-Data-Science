This was very easy and tasty, however the entire house filled with smoke and I literally had to open all the windows and have my husband take our baby outside. Now I'm no cook, but I thought this was odd because I followed the directions exactly as they were written. Next time I will cook at a lower heat and forget about trying to pop the peppercorns, because this was when the oil began to burn and fill the house with smoke (and they never popped anyway).

Absolutely wonderful!  And my husband raved about it as well.  I did have to cook the peppercorns a bit longer as mentioned in another review, but it was worth it.  I'll make it again for company.

Nice simple recipe for a good piece of tuna. A few things though, first off I would advise to heat the skillet with oil and butter BEFORE seasoning the fish. If you put the salt on too early it will dry the fish out by drawing out the moisture. Second, I used only a pinch of salt on each side so maybe even a little less than what this calls for but its all about personal taste. Lastly I added a few splashes of white wine when I put the steaks in the pan. It not only adds a nice flavor to the fish but if you then take out the fish and add a little more wine while the pan is really hot it will deglaze your pan and leave you with a really nice white wine and peppercorn reduction (or pan gravy however you wanna call it) for your fish.

This is very good but there is too much salt in the recipe. I made this for 4 and the recipe called for 2 tsp kosher salt. I only used 1 tsp and it was still salty. But other than that, everyone loved it. Will definitely make again. Just with less salt. I also used yellow tail tuna steaks.

This recipe was great! I didnt cook my Ahi nearly as long though. Typically seared means just that, if your pan is hot enough it should be just a quick cook on high heat to seal in the juices. I think I cooked it a total of 20-30 SECONDS per side. The out side had a wonderful crust and the inside was raw. (Make sure you use Sushi Grade fish) It was UH-MAY-ZING! I used my cast iron pan on med/high-high heat. It tasted just like seared Ahi that I have had in fancy restaurants. Definitely a keeper!

I am intimidated to make any kind of fish that isn't pre-prepared/marinated to pop into the oven, grill etc. Love eating it at restaurants...THIS was by far SO easy and incredibly delicious. I did follow others & cut back salt to 3/4 tsp. I added dried dill to the salt cayenne mixture b/c I love it w/ fish. I also added minced garlic to oil and peppercorn. After cooking I deglazed iron skillet as suggested by another w/ squeeze of lime a bit of balsamic and white wine and put a spoonful over each serving. BIG thumbs up by ENTIRE fam of which the kids are not big fish eaters. THANKS for the recipe!!!

YUM! Agree REDUCE THE SALT, You can always add more if you want. I didn't have any cayenne so I used a little chili powder and it was delish!

Excellent!! Can't screw this one up. I'm a total beginner and this was my first time handling tuna steak. My BF and I absolutely loved it. Followed directions exactly except I just sprinkled a little bit less salt on them. Paired this with spinach steamed with minced garlic and I thought they went well together.

Very easy and tasty on a bed of lettuce. I used a Teriyake marinade. Go very easy on additional salt as the marinade is plenty salty.

This was delicious.  My husband loved it!!! We had it just Monday and we are having company tomorrow and he has requested we have it again.  The only changes I made is I used just regular pepper and sprinkled it on the fish and omitted the butter and just used the olive oil.  Great meal and very, very easy.

Made this last night and was leary of popping peppers but I watched them thru a glass lidded frying pan.  Pretty neat.  I think that the older the pepper, the less likely it is to pop as about half of mine popped.  We like our tuna well done so I did it 3 minutes per side on med-high.  A lovely dish that DH says is a keeper and to make again, anytime.  I think I'll wait until it warms up here a bit though since my vent is frozen over and it's too cold to open the windows (-40 C/F) to get the smoke out!  I would think that this would be good done in a cast iron fry pan directly on the BBQ coals, too.

Very good and I'm not a seared tuna fan - had to 'overcook' mine by most people's standard but my husband's was med. rare and he loved it.  Will reduce the cayene next time though.  Didn't seem too salty to us, but we used Kosher salt vs. plain sea salt and that does make a difference.  Only 1 peppercorn popped, but they were still good.

I would make this again. Who knew I would be able to bite into a peppercorn and it would be so mild and crispy. I don't even care for black pepper much but like the peppercorns this way. I cooked my tuna steak on med high for 60 seconds per side. That was good enough for me, we like it pretty rare. However, I wish the outside would have been even crispier than it was.  I should have done it on high heat instead.  Overall, very good. We ate it with a dip made of wasabi paste, yogurt, dried mustard, dill and soy sauce. Salad on the side with a simple dressing on crushed garlic, lime juice, salt and olive oil. Great healthy meal.

This was great but I adapted it.  Rubbed the fish with salt & cayenne both sides (much less than recipe states).  Used the peppercorns etc as a sauce, prepped in separate pan over moderate heat.  No smoking issues. Seared the ahi as I always do: preheat iron pan on high heat for 5 min, then wipe pan carefully with small amt peanut oil; keeping fire high, do 60 seconds for each side of the fish.  This method sears tuna, leaving it rare inside (for a piece of 1" thickness).

Excellent! Only add the amount of salt you are comfortable with or what you think would taste good. I actually had about half salt, half cayenne, and I don't think I used the entire quantity of salt called for.
As for cooking, I used cracked peppercorns, and I sauteed them in the butter and oil on medium heat so the butter did not burn. Once that was done after a minute or so, I cranked the heat up to high and put in the tuna. I cut my tuna filet (originally a 1 lb filet) into 2 pieces so it made 2 rectangular fillets similar to what is in the photo. I seared the top and bottom of each filet for 20 seconds and the left and right sides of each for 10 seconds leaving a beautiful cold red center and about 2 millimeters of seared meat on the edges. The end result was awesome. I sliced the fillets just like the photo and served over a bed of salad greens. I had nothing but compliments.
Also, I bought my filet at Costco. No issues whatsoever.

This is simply wonderful.  The tuna melts in your mouth if cooked as directed.  The pepercorns add just the right amouth of heat.  I did not use salt, we substituted with Trader Joe's 21 salute which is a non-salt product. Served over a bed of lettuce.

Have made this five times now and we love it. I consider it a company level recipe. Only a few peppercorns pop, but they soften in the oil and have such a mild delicious flavor that I double the amount. The cayenne is too much for me so I sprinkle it generously on my husband's and just a tad on mine, and I skip the salt when cooking and lightly salt when serving. As we're not raw fish eaters I sear it but then cook it completely through and we find it just right for us, plenty moist having been cooked in the oil and butter. (This also allows me to use Trader Joe's frozen ahi steaks, 3/4" thick, which cost half or less.) After having leftovers one time which I made into a tuna salad, yummy with the pepper and cayenne flavors, I now always cook a double recipe and we have salad the next night.

Amazing. I've tried Tuna Steaks a couple of times and each time something was just off. My husband's face grimaced slightly when I mentioned what was for dinner but by the end of it he had changed his tune. Great recipe

Until trying this recipe, we had always grilled tuna on the BBQ.  We have now used this recipe twice and much prefer it.  There is less guesswork and the results are great.   I used Creole seasoning rather than cayenne.  As an accompaniment, I made an aioli sauce with mayo, yogurt, fresh garlic and a pinch of the Creole seasoning.  Fabulous!

I will be making this often ! My husband and 10 year old gobbled it up while I was finishing the rice. It was absolutely delicious! I only had peppercorns in a sealed grinder so I ground them .Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is now my go-to recipe for guests.

Fantastic! After spending an outrageous $28.00 on 2 pieces of Ahi I wanted a recipe that would do it justice. This was absolutely amazing! Restaurant quality or better, and this was my first time cooking tuna steaks at home. A keeper for sure! Thank you!

I bought my tuna at Costco and it was big enough for two meals for the two of us.  I used the same recipe for both meals and absolutely loved it.  I cut back on the salt and just sprinkled Kosher salt lightly on both sides of the fish.  I did a light covering with the cayenne as well.  The first time I heated up the oil and butter and then added the peppercorns.  I did not get any popping and the peppercorns were probably a bit or more on the burnt side.  It still was delicious.  The tuna had a nice crust on both sides and I cooked it for 1.5 minutes per side.  We do like our ahi tuna rare.

the second time I added the peppercorns to the pan before I heated up th butte and olive oil.  There was a lot of popping going on as the oil heated.  It didn't take long at all.  Again I seared for 1.5 minutes and it was perfectly crusted and delicious.  I served it with steamed spinach, a baked potato and tossed salad.  I used the Good Seasons salad mix but subsitituted balsamic vinegar for the vinegar and EVOO for the oil.  It is our favorite salad dressing;

Excellent!  Other than cutting the salt (a sprinkle per steak is plenty), the recipe is perfect as written, including the cooking time. 90 sec per side in med-high heat is plenty - just let it rest a couple of minutes before serving.  It'll keep cooking on the inside.

this was only OK.  Granted I did overcook the tuna (whish was my fault) but I felt it lacked flavor, with the exception og when you ate a peppercorn.  I agree that the texture of the peppercorns were great and tastey but other then that I desired more of a punch of flavor.

I have made this several times and we love it! Others are right in that reducing the salt may be good idea (and this is coming from a saltaholic) Also, its so important NOT to overcook these. For a nice rare don't cook longer than specified.

Simplistic wonderful recipe!  Great flavor.  I did let the peppercorns soften at a very low temp for 10 minutes before turning up to med-high and waiting for the pop of the peppercorns before putting on the Ahi.

This is a reliable recipe for seared ahi.  I don't use the whole peppercorns, but I do  use coarse-ground black pepper and add white pepper.  This seems intimidating but be sure to use fresh tuna and it will come out excellent!

So easy and perfectly seasoned. The peppercorns were delicious. I didn't cook it with butter: just added a little more oil. I also kept the cayenne down to a pinch on each side. My husband was so impressed (and it was the first time I cooked fish!!). Yay me.

Delicious!  I made this into a salad using 3 recipes from this site.  I made the Oven-Roasted Vegetables, the Asian Ginger Dressing and the Seared Ahi Tuna Steaks and put all the above on Romaine Lettuce for an amazing salad.  will definately make all 3 again!

This is very good.  But try it with grapeseed oil instead of olive oil. Then you can sear it at high heat without smoking.  Add the butter when done searing for flavor. I didnt add any salt and it still tasted great.

I never review recipes on this site (I know, that's terrible, I do so rely on the reviews that are written), but this, I just pulled the tuna out of the pan and tasted a piece.  For as simple as this recipe is, I've never tasted a piece of tuna this good.  My kitchen did fill up with smoke a little because of the oil getting hot, but it is worth it!  Now I have to keep myself from eating it before everyone else is ready for dinner!

Was delicious! I made a couple changes. I waited until the peppercorns popped before adding butter (didnt want a smokey kitchen), and added lemon juice to the steaks when I salted. Also, I seasoned to my taste with the salt and pepper. I will totally make this again! Thank you

Yummy!  This was my first time making ahi tuna steaks, and I was a bit nervous, but this recipe made it easy to turn out restaurant quality steaks.  I cooked them 3 minutes on medium high (6) each side to medium well.   I also skipped the popping the pepper step.  Instead I just threw some regular old ground pepper onto the steaks before cooking.  I didn't have kosher salt, so I used regular table salt, too.  I didn't measure the amount of salt, but just shook enough on the steaks that it looked like a normal amount.  I would have preferred to serve this with brown rice, but my boyfriend hates rice so I made mac & cheese instead.  It was fine together, but I still think brown rice would have been a better choice!

I made this dinner tonight for my boyfriend and he loved it. This was the first time I ever cooked tuna and the recipe was so helpful. I didn't have cayenne or peppercorns, so I had to use chili powder and black crushed pepper. Next time I make it I want to get the peppercorn and cayenne.

I am not a tuna steak fan but they were given to me so I cooked them. I grilled them on a George Forman after marinating in Teriyaki sauce for 5 minutes. They were a little dry so maybe 4 minutes next time.

This was super simple and tasty.  I used less salt than the recipe called for, and more peppercorns.  I probably overcooked the steaks, and they were still fantastic.  I will definitely cook these again.

Perfect, the only change I made which kept down the smoke was to only use olive oil.  I cooked this in a cast iron pan which is great for maintaining heat and getting super hot.

I know that ahi tuna is delicious and have had it made for me before, however, this was my first time making it on my own! So of course, it turned out good but it wasn't ideal. I had no chipotle pepper so I used a little cayenne pepper mix. Halved the salt but found myself wishing I had used a teensy bit more! My peppercorns for the most part weren't popping or softening much even after 5min. Must have been older stuff. My oil started smoking and my apartment had to be aired out halfway through the process. I turned the heat down from Med/Hi to Medium just because I didn't want excessive smoke! When I popped my tuna on, I watched the clock (and this was on Medium heat as well) and flipped it after just under 2 minutes. Ended up crispy on the outside and rare in the middle, but it still tasted wonderful for a first time tuna experience so I'm not really going to complain!

Disappointingly plain, too salty and spicy.

The taste was explicit. Very easy to make. I would maybe spice it up a touch with a little more cayenne pepper. The cook time was perfect for rare which is how I like it. Cook the peppercorns for at least 10 minutes before adding the tuna.

Laziness prevents marinading which brings me to this recipe.  Was glad that this got so many favorable reviews which prompted me to try it. Luved that there were so few ingredients(and I had them on hand), but still was a delight with soy sauce and wasabi.  So quick and easy.  Followed the recipe except used soy oil not olive.  Will make again.

I had the same issue with the smokey oil, but turned down the heat before it got too bad. I also think it's important to note that the time for rare will vary dramatically depending on how cold your tuna is, or if it was previous frozen or not. We only did 2 minutes per side, and it was cooked all the way through. It was still delicious, but next time i'll probably only do 1 minute or less per side.

We really liked it, but the peppercorns can be hazardous when they pop! They were shooting out of the pan all over the stove. Other than that it was really good. A bit spicy and plenty flavorful. With a side of brown rice and asparagus one tuna steak was enough for the two of us.

This recipe was wonderful. I thought the pepper corns were going to be too hot, but the cooking does mellow them out nicely. I didn't find it too salty, I just put a sprinkle on each side. This recipe is keeper for sure.

Easy, and tastier than I've had in a restaurant!  
If your oil smokes, then you might have the heat a little too high, or you might have used extra virgin olive oil (which has a low smoke point) instead of regular olive oil.

Great recipe, both the cayenne and the lemon pepper work great. Definitely stick to the suggested amount of tuna though; we used bigger yellowfin steaks and the spices weren't exactly right. Other than that, excellent recipe.

What a fantastic, easy dish!  Like others, I didn't use the full amount of salt.  Since I didn't have any cayenne pepper on hand, I used lemon pepper instead.  Can't wait to try it with the cayenne next time.

This was awesome. We left the cayenne pepper off the piece for our children. OUr picky eaters ate this up! Husband orders this type of fish out to dinner al the time and was shocked how easy it was to make at home.  Not all the pepecorns poped but it was cool watching those that did.

Excellent.  I did like the ingredient amounts and flavor.  Next time I will make sure to sear the outside for a nicer appearance and added flavor.  Great served with fresh lemon wedges!

Very good. I used a little more pepper and cooked it about 3 min each side for med rare. I has some left over so I had it the next dya over salad and I think the flavor actually got better. The only thing that I didn't understand was the pepper corns; mine didn't pop??

Could only find yellow fin tuna at the time.  Seasoning was excellent.  Also coated in sesame seeds.  Two minutes per side gave us about a medium doneness. Tasty.

Very good, but a bit salty.  Next time I will reduce the salt slightly and add a teeny bit more cayenne.

It came out great! I had some problems getting the peppercorns to "pop", but everyone seemed to like it, even the fish haters! I will try marinating it in teriyaki sauce next time!

I made this for myself on my birthday one year, but I changed it up a bit by using unsalted butter and only ground pepper. It was amazing and I love it!

Having little experience cooking fish, I tend to be afraid of it. This is easy and absolutely delightful! I did heat up the peppercorns with the oil and butter but the smoke detector still had a fit! I made a lemon/caper/dill sauce (my safety net when eating fish) but didn’t want to spoil the taste of the ahi! Highly recommend this recipe.

Made this tonight... delicious... I did some substitutes though.

I added olive oil, butter, and peppercorns all at the same time bringing to a hot sizzle... reduced to simmer for about 5 minutes. 

Instead of cayenne and kosher salt, I used Tony's Creole seasoning. Covering both sides and allowing to come to temp out of the fridge. 

Pan seared 1.5 minutes each side and seared the edges. Removed from heat and let rest 5 minutes before serving.

Loved the recipe even though I failed peppercorn popping??. I tried soaking them in the oil before but didn't make a difference. I did get some smoking as the oil/butter heated up. After the steaks were done I added a bit of wine to the pan as one reviewer recommended. It was then my peppercorns went crazy popping oil all over the place. Next time I'll have my splatter shield at the ready. Love the cayenne rub!  Great flavour profile

Recipe turned out fantastic!! One the things to remember, let the fish warm up a little. A little cooler then room temperature. That way it's not seared on the outside and cold on the inside.

This was a really easy recipe to follow. I used a cast iron pan and you have to watch closely to make sure the pan is heating equally otherwise the steaks can cook at a different rate. I turn the handle of the pan 90 degrees at 45 seconds to ensure they cook at the same rate. Also, I used pink and white peppercorns and crushed them with a mortar and pestle first because when I tried it with the whole peppercorns they would pop and fly out of the pan which is kinda fun but not when they hit you in the face or roll under the fridge....I served it over coconut rice with cilantro, green onions, and a spicy remoulade!

This recipe really elevates and highlights the fish, but there are some flaws as written.  I planned on making it to spec but revised as I went because I could see problems arising.
*Use light olive oil, not EVOO, it has a higher smoke point.  I didn't have light, so I used walnut oil... worked great, no smoke!
*I used a little over 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and that was more than plenty.
*1 1/2 minutes per side in a medium-high pan was too much.   My tuna came out medium-well.

Yummy! I have made this recipe many, many times and have to say it is a family favorite. My favorite add in is sesame seeds with the pepper corns in the hot frying pan. This add in gives the tuna a wonderful toasted taste. I will also say if you are sensitive to salt add the salt to the tuna after it's cooked. Ahi is a very healthy and simple meal.  A must try!

Outstanding. I added chile powder and used extra cayenne. I served it over a bed of greens tossed in fresh lime juice and olive oil. Drizzled a tiny bit of honey over the whole thing for balance. Lordy, yes!!!!

Delicious. Second time making it, I upped the cayenne a bit, used coarsely ground pepper in the butter instead of corns (I used corns last time and cooking them for 5 minutes made the butter burn and whole place fill with smoke). Only heated butter and pepper for a minute or so, and cooked for about a 45sec - 1min on each side to stay raw in the middle.  Flavour was even better this time with more cayenne and ground pepper instead of corns. Far beat the tuna for which I paid $30 in a restaurant the night before.

Turned out great thanks to Bethany Joyful and other reviewers--used many of their suggestions. Sprinkle of Cajun spice instead of salt & cayenne. No smoking issues perhaps because I used Safflower oil infused with olive oil instead of strictly olive oil. Safflower oil can be used at very high temperatures. Instead of butter used Ghee (clarified butter). Iron skillet (wow, peppercorns popped so I had to use splatter guard). I remembered that fish continues to cook after removal from heat, so cooked it rarer than I'd prefer & let it sit a minute. I also deglazed the pan with wine & balsamic vinegar and offered it on the side.

Simple and yummy! I followed another review...I added white wine while searing the fish. Once the Ahi is removed from the pan, I added more white wine to create a reduction sauce. I drizzled this over the seared ahi slices with the cooked peppercorns ontop if a green salad, and WOW! I believe adding the white wine added more character to the fish. I will definitely make this again!!!

I changed this up a bit. My taste buds were not satisfied with the seasonings in the recipe. I added oregano, dill, garlic, and thyme.  I put it on top of white rice with veggies then mixed the seasonings in some extra olive oil and drizzled it over the finished product. I didn't slice it I left it as a full steak.

I also cooked the peppercorns a bit longer and my kitchen also filled with some smoke. I just finished eating my tuna and it was delicious. I ignored the amounts of salt and Cheyenne pepper in the recipe and I covered both sides of my steak with copious sea salt and Cheyenne pepper!  Woowee! that was some delicious steak.

This was just kind of eh. I wanted to try an alternative to the Blackened Tuna Steaks with Mango Salsa because I just keep making and making that one and figure it's good to switch it up... but now I see why I stuck with the other! This was SPICY. But beyond that there's was much flavor. No depth of flavor, no various flavors happening at once, just a lot of spice.

I loved that this recipe was simple, yet tasty. I almost added garlic and I'm glad I didn't, because it wasn't necessary! I used extra virgin olive oil, which was a mistake (and admittedly not exactly what the recipe calls for; I presume the recipe's author meant light olive oil). Next time I will omit the butter and use an oil with a higher smoke point to prevent smoke in the house and potentially dangerous chemicals in my food.

This was nothing special. I had the same issue a lot of others had in that the peppercorns wouldn't pop- they just burnt. I had to open all of my windows and doors. Funny thing is, when I tossed them into the sink they landed in a bowl of cold water and then popped...

I made a couple of dipping sauces for this tuna that really saved it. A hollandaise sauce and a soy sauce/brown sugar mixture. Both got rave reviews. While I'll be making this recipe again, I definitely wont be using peppercorns and I'll always make sure to have a sauce.

Delicious!!  Easy and amazing!   I omitted the cayenne pepper due to serving it to kids.   I tipped the pan so most of the peppercorns were on one side.  I made the "grown up" pieces in the heavy pepper side and made the kids pieces light on pepper side and it was amazing for the whole family.  I seared each piece 2 min on each side due to having really thick pieces.  Enjoy!!

Super yummy! I did not measure salt or cayenne, but just sprinkled it on each side. I also coated each side in sesame seeds before searing and used homemade dill butter instead of regular butter. I had a 1 inch think steak and cooked it two minutes each side. Definitely would make this again!

Very simple and delicious! For those worried about the amount of salt, you have to remember the recipe calls for kosher salt. A teaspoon of kosher salt is much different than a teaspoon of table salt. Toss that nasty table salt away! You will taste the difference when you start using good salt. That said, if your tuna steak is thin, you should definitely use less.

Just loved this. Absolutely appreciate the recommendations to reduce the salt. I just used a light sprinkle. Cooked it 2 minutes per side as I wanted it more medium rare and it was perfect for our tastes. Also, served it with my own dipping sauce creation.  I am adding the recipe for you to try if you like, named Ahi Tuna Dipping Sauce. Enjoy!  We did and plan to serve to guests in the future.

I had the heat up too high I think, and I had a thick ahi steak and it came out white and overdone.  I did exactly 90 sec per side and used all olive oil and no butter.  I am a "newer cook" so any tips are greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

This was great from a preparation and cooking method standpoint. I've had awesome ahi tuna steaks at restaurants, and this was pretty good. It's best served rare, as this method will produce. I've also had it cooked beyond rare, and it is just not as good...it dries out easily. I did grind my kosher salt with a mortar and pestle so there were not big chunks. Some have complained about the salt...I thought it was fine. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because from a "final product" perspective, I'd like some sort of sauce to go with it.

This is one of my favorite recipes!!!   My husband and I seldom eat tuna out, as it is to often overcooked.  We love having sushi out, but is a wonderful at-home alternative.
We've eaten as is with potatoes on the side, on salads, or (more recently) in home-made wraps.   Perfection!

This is a great recipe because it combines Flavor with ease of preparation. I modified it as follows. Heat the butter and olive oil until it just starts to smoke and adjust the heat so it stays that way. I used a course ground pepper instead of the pepper corns. I pressed a course salt and red pepper flakes (the kind you put on pizza) into the tuna on both sides using my thumbs. Cook 3/4 inch steaks 1 minute and 1" steaks 1.5 minutes.

Add Wasabi Sauce on the side as a dip, I prefer Silver Springs.

Delicious and easy to make recipe! The flavor really gets infused into the tuna steak.  Be careful because the butter and oil may smoke a bit - I may half the amount of olive oil needed, since I use a small pan.

Excellent!  Used swordfish.  Skipped the cayenne since we are spicy sissies.  Other than that we followed the directions to the tee.  1.5 minutes on each side makes for a fully cooked fish instead of rare but it was super moist and perfect for us.

Perfect! I am not much of a seafood type person however my boyfriend is and several months ago I made this for dinner for him and it was a hit! Very easy recipe to prepare, I use fresh wild caught tuna  and it turns out exactly the same every time and better then restaurant quality. Great recipe for those with little seafood cooking experience

This was fantastic.  Already cooked it for my husband and sister who both loved it.  My husband never liked Ahi Tuna!  He does now.  The only problem was the peppercorns never popped.  Instead the butter/oil blackened first.  So I just used regular ground pepper and it was great.  Clarified (Ghee) butter works the best with the Olive Oil and pepper.

This was not good.  The seasoning did nothing to compliment the tuna.  Tuna isn't cheap and I feel like I wasted it on this recipe.  I am honestly shocked that so many people seemed to enjoy this.

Wow, this was the first time I have ever made Ahi Tuna, it is soo good! I didn't end up using the peppercorns because i have one of those McCormick grinders that doesn't open. I would have bought them at the store when I was there if i knew this ahead of time. None the less, this tasted amazing! I cooked mine probably a little too long, about 2 min. per side, but the center was still a little pink. I will be making this over and over again!

This recipe was okay. It would make the recipe again, just change it by adding more flavor than just the cayenne and salt. I also had to cook mine a bit longer.

Wow!  This was the first time I made Ahi Tuna Steaks and I am so happy to have tried this recipe for my first attempt. I thought, how in the world can it be as good as reviewers claimed with only peppercorns and a little seasoning!? Now I see how. The peppercorns realease an unbelieveable flavor as they open up. Don't be worried about the pan smoking...it ensures the pan is hot enough to properly sear the tuna. I cooked it about 3 mins each side as I am not a fan of anything rare. This tuna does not need any sauce...just top it with the peppercorns from the pan. You will not be disappointed in this recipe!! Thank you Bethany!

I finally learned how to cook Tuna! Delicious.  We will definately do that again with a few course corrections on my part.  I really loved using my new cast iron skillet for the medallions sized portions. I used a sea salt grinder and lightly ground the salt on (good on that).  I sprinkeled the cayan a little to heavy, but that could be counterbalanced with a refreshing sauce or relish. I used a tomato/caper relish as a topper.  The medallions made a great appetizers.  I will definately repeat again while using the outside grill burner, because searing, in general, gets a bit smokey.  Thanks for sharing!

This was exceptionally nice! My 8-year old son smelled it in the pan and was ready for a taste as soon as it was done, and he's usually very apprehensive about new foods. I even got an unsolicited "Thank you, Mom! Dinner was delicious!" after the meal.  For those who complained about it being too salty, I can only imagine it's from the site's automated serving adjuster. So my advice is not to change the amount of the seasonings, even if you use more meat. I'm not even sure I used the full amount listed because I simply eye-balled it and stopped when it looked like it had enough.  Anyway, definitely a keeper! I'll be making this again (or face the wrath of an upset boy!).

This recipe is definitely simple, subtle and delicious.  However, I would say it is fairly too simple.  It was a good test against some Ahi Tuna steaks we purchased from our local Sam's Club not too long ago.  I added slightly more pepper as well as Onion powder and a touch of garlic.

easy and tasty. i was a little worried about how long to cook the peppercorns but they "popped" exactly as indicated in the recipe so i knew! be careful to not overcook the tuna as it can become tough pretty quickly. we had a few pieces in different sizes so it was hard to know how long and the smaller pieces came out a bit overdone. but otherwise really easy and delicious. i will make this again!

This was very good and very healthy. I seared mine in a cast iron skillet for just a few on each side as we like our Ahi very rare.   I served this with asparagus and cilantro lime coconut rice and fresh avacado.  I had no leftovers.. the family loved it.

This was my first time making tuna steaks and the result was delicious!  I added cracked peppercorns to the tuna exterior as suggested by previous posters, which simplified preparation.  We'll definitely be making this again!

Delicious! Great, EASY recipe. I used fake butter and added minced garlic to the peppercorn mixture and then minimal minced onion on the fish. So good. The boyfriend looooved it.

This was so easy and tasty! I took my time heating the peppercorns (over med-med low heat) and didn't have any smoking issues as some of the other reviewers. My husband called it gourmet and I just smiled because he didn't know how easy it was. Definitely try this one out!

We loved this tuna. I had two frozen, individually wrapped ahi tuna steaks that I defrosted in the fridge overnight (what I'm trying to say is that the quality of my ahi tuna was not the best). Regardless, the flavor was amazing. I did not expect these results with such few and basic ingredients. I cooked my filets through because of the quality but I was still very happy with them. I used coarse ground black peppercorns instead of whole and it was great! Will definitely make again and serve to company.

I decreased the cooking time for the fish slightly. Otherwise it was good. The roasted peppercorns really add to the overall dish.

Easy AND really quick. Perfect fast meal when I don't feel like making a big deal out of dinner, like after the gym. I DID reduce the salt by about 1/2 just to be safe. I figured I could salt it at the table if it needed (but it didn't).

This recipe is simple and delicious. It's the perfect way to prepare sashimi grade Ahi. My family said it was as good as anything they have had in a restaurant. I served it with wasabi/soy, Thai red chili paste, wild rice, and a great Asian cucumber/avocado relish. Outstanding!

Fantastic!  I am going to put the butter in after the peppercorns start popping next time, to cut down on the burned butter flavor.  And I took the advice of another user to not put nearly as much salt.  I also agree with the post that you just need to sear it, because we like our ahi rare.  But this was amazing, and I will definitely make it again.

Thanks to previous comments I was prepared when cooking the peppercorns.I did reduce the kosher salt to 1/2 tsp. We like our tuna more medium well,so left them in the pan a little longer(3 mins each side). Great recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!  I cooked the peppercorns outside on the burner on the grill. It was a bit smokey like the other reviewers said. There is nothing we would change.  This is a must try.  We will never make ahi any other way!

Totally love this recipe. I added a couple of dashes of dill, and will definately use less salt than the recipe calls for next time. Fair warning: go ahead and crack a window cause it gets smokey quick while waiting for the peppercorns to pop. This was the first time my boyfriend had Ahi and he really enoyed it; he (and I) especially like the crust that formed. Next time I'll also probably try it with a hollandaise sauce and some fresh asparagus.

This was delicious.  I used sesame oil instead of olive oil, because I wanted more of an Asian-food taste.  Very quick and easy to do, and the whole family liked it (even my little brother said I should make it again!).

Really great and simple.  Wasn't too spicy for my 2, 4 and 8 years olds to enjoy too.  Thanks!

This was outstanding and quick, which is always a plus in my book.  I used frozen filets and it still was amazing.  Will use this recipe often.

Great recipe. Season tuna after butter/oil is heating in pan. Only need to sear tuna about 30 seconds per side. Delicious.

Very Good!  Followed the advice of other reviewers and did not salt the tuna and only seared for 20-30 seconds. They were done they way my husband & I  like them  - Rare.  Additionally, I would not sear the peppercorns unless you have a fantastic exhaust fan, as another reviewer stated the house became filled with smoke which could be very dangerous for anyone with asthma or respiratory issues. Next time I will eliminate that step &  coat the outside to the tuna with course pepper instead.to get a blacked crust.

This was awesome. We like really rare tuna so I got really high-quality steaks and cooked 90 seconds per side. Perfect!!! The sauce is probably the best thing I ever tasted. Takes a while but worth it - I love it so much, I would drink it. So glad we have extra to serve with beef tenderloin later this week. 

I served this with cauliflower mash and Chinese green beans.

As written, I gave this a 3 star rating. Like others, the butter and olive oil mixed smoked the place up with the peppercorns. I wouldn’t put the fish in it. Tossed the whole mess and started over, leaving out the peppercorns and instead just putting freshly ground pepper on the tuna. As modified this way, it was a 5 star rating.

Used sushi grade tuna, per fisherman, caught “hours ago”,  Instead of just cayenne I used a seasoning mix of paprika, garlic, pepper, onion, cayenne, thyme. Perfect!!

We made this the other night and it was delicious. The tuna steaks turned out perfectly (we heated the cast iron pan on the BBQ so we didn't have smoke in the house). 
I served the tuna with the mango salsa recipe from this site and some Thai lime (heat in the bag) rice.
Wonderful meal that could have been from any high-end restaurant. We will definitely be making this again.

This is a terrific receipt.    For someone who never pan fried peppercorns in butter and good olive oil,   it was a revelation.    One variation which works for us is to sear a shorter time and then put into a low temp oven--250 degrees--until internal temp gets to perhaps 110.    For those who like pure sushi,   this may be a step down, but others may find attractive.   The absolute key is to get good, fresh tuna.

SO tasty! I used a salted herb mix and pepper, since I don't like cayenne.  It doesn't need much for a good tuna to be flavorful.

Fantastic, delicious, quick and easy! It's a touch salty, though, so I might decrease the salt a hair next time. I went light on the cayenne, too, and will definitely increase that to what the recipe calls for next time.

This recipe nailed it. I had some fresh yellowfin steaks given to me that i didn’t know how to prepare. I left them on a little longer to get them to medium and my son DEVOURED the steak. My son is picky so this was a huge win. For my own steak, I used a mix of tomato sauce, Rotem tomato and chile, and peas for a nice sauce.

The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. Unfortunately, my peppercorns didn't pop and get soft. So, I made it again but crushed the peppercorns in a mortar with a pestle. It came out amazing !!! The tuna steaks were perfectly coated with the peppercorns and crusted beautifully.

Delicious. True a bit smokey with the peppercorns but worth it. Served on a bed of arugula with quinoa and a homemade dressing.  Yum!

Wonderful!  Very Tasty.  Very easy to over cook.  Every time I do it I cut back a few seconds from the recommended 1.5/min per side.  I'm under a minute per side and it seems to still overcook from a picture perfect sashimi ahi.

Last night was the first time I cooked Tuna steaks. I added dill to the steaks and garlic to the sauce when heating up the peppers but it all turned out perfect. My husband is a really good cook and he was just loving it. Cooking time was spot on. Can't wait to make for my son next time he's here for a dinner. Thanks again John!!

We really like this recipe!  It was our first time making tuna steaks at home, and we slightly overcooked it on our first try, but we're still practicing.  However, it was still very tasteful!  We added extra peppercorn because we like that; otherwise we followed the recipe to the T (our side was szechuan green beans).

Wife loved it. Didn't have pepper corns so I added some white pepper to the pan before adding the tuna, worked fine for adding flavor. Really glad I installed a vented range hood, it would have tripped my fire alarms!

Very simple to make.   The flavor is wonderful. My husband said this is a restaurant quality recipe.  It does smoke quite a bit so be prepared to use your exhaust fan or open a window.  I used fresh cracked pepper instead of whole peppercorns. I served it over a bed of romaine lettuce with grape tomatoes with quinoa as a side. I will definitely make this again.

This was simple and delicious with just the right amount of flavor; i hate when all i can taste is the seasoning of a dish.  I am sensitive to salt so i did cut back to 1/2 teaspoon but otherwise, I followed this recipe as is. I will definitely make again.

I love this easy recipe. The only thing I do differently is to splash a little red wine vinegar on to brighten just before they leave the pan to serve.

I agree with the other reviewers -- skip the peppercorns.  I included them and didn't feel they added much, plus they're a pain to cook long enough.  I used the mangoes from another recipe on this site (1 tsp butter, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 cup diced mangoes, cooked for 5 minutes).  The ahi was DELICIOUS topped with these cooked mangoes and bits of green onion.

Loved this- but I did do a few changes. 1)  I used a pepper mix and seasoned with that and sea salt- so I did not have to try and pop perppercorns! 2) I bought steaks that had sesame seeds already on them, so that is what I cooked. 3) I added about 1/2 cup white wine at end of cooking and brought to a quick boil after I took steaks out and reduced to a sauce.  Absolutly great.  Might add some wasabi or mustard when I try again.

This was great!  I lightly dusted the tuna with salt and cayenne, as other reviewers said there was too much salt.  I also used multi-colored peppercorns.  I didn't wait for them to open, I just got them nice and hot before adding the tuna.  I deglazed the pan with white wine and cooked it down for a nice sauce and topped the steak with a cabbage slaw.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making this again. The peppercorns were just soft enough for a really nice texture and taste.

I followed the instructions, I couldn’t get the peppercorns to pop so I crush some pepper for each side. Other than that it’s delicious served it with an Asian chop salad bag. Yummy and fast.

Delicious!  I used ground pepper instead of whole peppercorns.  Next time I would use less salt (perhaps just quickly grind across the top of the tuna pieces).  I cook the pieces 3 minutes on each side.  I think it would also be good with cumin, curry or wasabi paste too.

Loved that this recipe is simple and easy although like another reviewer indicated, the high heat produced a lot of smoke in the house.  Also, the peppercorns took quite a bit longer to burst.   I used less salt than the recipe suggested as well.

Instead of attempting to pop the peppercorns, I ground pepper into the pan. I used ground pepper, Himalayan Sea Salt and cayenne pepper to season the Ahi. I also used some white wine to deglaze the pan and make a reduction like another commenter recommended. It came out fantastic. I only gave it thirty seconds on each side and just rolled the edges in the pan for color. I will definitely make this again, but may cut back on the cayenne.

I made last night.  It was good but next time I will tone down the salt a little bit.  Goes great with some roasted veggies.  Not a difficult dish either and pretty quick.  Just make sure you time it right with any sides.  Best served hot, so have it done last

I made it and it was delicious. I had some trouble getting the peppercorns to pop but they were a few years old. I even soaked them in oil a few minutes beforehand.  I was surprised that they  had such a mild flavor and were great on the tuna. I will try again with fresh peppercorns. I was glad I had the lid on when a few popped because they splatted oil like popcorn would. I didn't put the butter in the hot oil because I thought it would burn but I did put it on the tuna right at the end and it gave good flavor. I wish I'd taken the tuna out a little before I did as it was almost done a bit too much. Next time I will crank up the heat more and cook it faster. Overall though it was an amazing dinner and I will absolutely do it again. Thanks for the great and EASY recipe!! I was so pleased I even remembered to take some pics.

I improvised because I had sea salt instead of kosher salt (I should have used less dincesea salt is very salty).  I purchased a black pepper grinder thinking I could open it and have access to whole peppercorns (not so).  The fish came out really salty due to my substitute.  I would like to redeem myself and try the dish again soon, using the suggested ingredients. I served it with steamed asparagus.

I cut the salt to 3/4 of a teaspoon and the cayenne pepper to 1/8 because I am always scared of too much seasoning or heat. It was delicious and the cooking time perfect.

Not bad. I used avocado oil instead of olive oil, higher smoke point, a bit much on the salt so if I do this again I'll cut it in half. So far best way I've cooked Ahi is marinating with low sodium soy garlic and avo oil.

Quick, easy and delicious.
Used a couple tbsp's homemade chili powder (from the 5 Ingredient Chili recipe) instead of just cayenne pepper and salted from the shaker. No whole peppercorns either so shook ground pepper in the hot pan just before adding the tuna..... smelled and tasted great.
Served the tuna steaks on a bed of homemade mango, cucumber salsa with a side of grilled sweet corn. The sweetness from the corn combined with the citrus from the salsa enhanced and balanced the flavors from the tuna and chili powder.

My ONLY issue was the skillet temp. Med-high even with butter to keep it from burning still causes it to smoke which adds a burnt flavor to it.. When this happen I scraped the oil and restarted at medium maybe a pinch under.(however not all stove tops are built the same) 

Flavor was a pinch on the heated side. Came out delicious

Really quite good, coming from someone who really isn't much of a seafood lover. I advice anyone to take it easy putting the cayenne pepper on. I like spice but it can be a little overpowering.

This was delicious! Everyone liked it, even my picky eaters. I used homemade ghee in place if the butter. I don’t have whole peppercorns, just a sealed grinder, so I ground pepper on the largest setting into the cast iron skillet and let it heat with the butter & oil mixture. I was very happy with how the ground black pepper seasoned the steaks. Next time I will cooking each side for 1 min 15 seconds; in my pan, 1 min 30 seconds was a little too long for a nice raw middle.

Love a simple tuna steak. However, the side I cooked for 1:30 was a little over seared. I recommend searing for only 1min/side. The peppercorn was a nice touches, used rainbow pepper instead of black pepper.

I followed the directions exactly . I went to a Sushi Counter at HEB and bought a tub of wasabi  and  Kikkoman's  Soy sauce . I served just like you  would serve sushi ...It was delicious. The peppercorns added just the right amount of aroma and taste. I will make all of my tuna steaks this way from now on.!!! J.Meyer SugarLand Tx

This is a amazing - I followed the directions exactly and it was perfectly seared and the cayenne pepper and peppercorns added a wonderful zing!  I paired it with a wonderful lemon aioli and asparagus and it was fine dining indeed!  We will make this again and again!  Thanks so much for sharing!

A whole teaspoon of salt was a lot for my two little tuna steaks, and 90 seconds per side was too long. Perhaps I misread it, but as thick as they were, they were a little overcooked.

A nice low sodium soy citrus sauce (Just add some lime or orange juice to soy sauce). To tone down the sodium a few drops water in the dipping sauce.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written and it turned out great!   We usually grill tuna steaks, but it is easy to overcook them on a grill.  I felt I could control how rare the steaks  were done by searing  them in the pan.  Be sure to have the pan hot before adding the steaks.  Quick and easy...I'll use this method again and again!

Oh my god!  I made an account just to review this recipe.  It's so simple, but so good!  I will say I substituted chipotle powder in for cayenne.  It has a nice, sorta smokey flavor.  Soooo good!

Easy and excellent recipe!!! The five minutes suggestion for the peppercorns was a little too long. That’s what caused most of the smoke that filled my kitchen too. I suggest having the tuna steaks all seasoned and ready to go before preparing the peppercorns which will help reduce the amount of smoke from heating butter and oil together. I’m definitely make by this more often.

Used fresh ground pepper instead of the peppercorns; cooked the ahi a little longer because we don't like rare fish; and I deglazed the pan with some fresh lemon juice. This was delicious! My husband, who is not a big fish eater, thought I was kidding when I said it was ahi. I will be making this again and again.

I love tuna and I love peppercorn,  but this recipe ruined my tuna steaks. Hated this recipe to no end. Don't try it unless you want to throw away tuna steaks or want to go out for dinner because everybody hated it.

Peppercorns did not pop and started out in cold oil....but they got soft. (Maybe old?) but enjoyed this recipe. Thank you for posting. Will make again.

I like this recipe, but what I do is I marinade my tuna steaks in a jerk marinade, it adds a little bit of an exotic taste to it.

Turned out great. Substituted crushed red pepper flakes and used Emeril’s Essence for the cayenne and salt. Paired with my signature garlic dirty mashed potatoes, a garden salad and a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and my beautiful bride make this meal unforgettable.

I use frozen tuna from HEB and didn’t expect it to be so good.   This recipe seems too easy  to produce such great results.  Hubby likes his as raw looking as the photos so I take his out of the pan using the timing stated in this recipe.  I like mine cooked just a bit more so mine stays in the pan longer.   Very tasty and juicy.

This is hands down an instant remake in my house. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I used some of the recommendations and tweeked it slightly. Added a little garlic powder to the spices and added a little white wine to the pan for the sauce. Super easy and extremely satisfying.

This is an incredibly easy way to prepare fresh Ahi and the result is both delectable and insanely easy!  I prepared it tonight for my husband and myself, and used the recipe as-written.  The peppercorns didn't soften a great deal, but they did add a nice crunch and great flavour to the finished dish.  It plated very elegantly and the timing was perfect to achieve a fish that was seared, yet still quite rare in the centre.  We both enjoyed it very much and I am likely to make it again the next time we come across some fresh Ahi.

I agree that it was so smoky I seriously thought my alarm was going to go off with just butter and oil in the pan. I even tested the alarm afterward because it really probably should have (turns out this will be the one time I’m happy the battery was dead)! I turned the heat down to control the smoke, but then the peppercorns wouldn’t “pop”. I opted for crushing them with the spatula after about 10 minutes, instead of having firefighters show up at my apartment  for a false alarm...again, and having all my neighbors come check out my smoky apartment (long story). I didn’t season the tuna until all of that was done (great advice), and I did use the amount of salt called for, and didn’t think it was too salty. I did muse unsalted butter though, so maybe if you use salted butter and the 1tsp of salt on top of that, it becomes too much?My steaks were still a little frozen in the middle when I started, which helped keep that raw center I love. I cooked it on the lower heat for about a minute each side, and then flipped it over a couple of times after about 20 seconds a side. It was simple and really tasty, and just ask my roommate, I never cook, and I’m terrified to cook fish. If I can do it, you can too!

Excellent! I need to know when turn it however, went maybe 3 minutes on a side and center was warm, pink, but not red. We didn't have any whole peppercorns so we used fresh ground garlic/pepper blend. Will try it again with whole ones. Very quick and easy to make!

I don't care for fresh tuna, but my hubby does, so I prepared this for him. He absolutely devoured it. I did not add the butter until the peppercorns started popping open and i was ready to pop the tuna into the pan, as I suspect cooking butter over med- high heat for at least 5 min was to blame for the smoking mentioned in a few previous reviews. I used a salt grinder and salted to taste, no measuring. Lovely crust and color, and my husband said the flavor was amazing with no changes or additions needed.

This was great!  It was so simple I thought it wouldn’t really work or be good.  Was I wrong!!  The family loved it and it was relatively fast.  I did use a carbon steel pan - black steel - which may have helped make it so good but I’ll definitely make it again!

The soy sauce mixture was also a must for me because it added a lot of juiciness and flavor. I modified it a bit with adding a bit of olive oil - I used organic tamarind and diced green onions... absolutely delicious

My tuna steaks were very thick (like 4”) so i halved them lengthwise. I did the cooking in my cast iron skillet which I highly recommend. The only thing I changed was just increasing some of the ingredients. Used a little more butter, oil and spices. It turned out FABULOUS! As good as any restaurant!  For a sauce i mixed together some wasabi, horseradish, soy sauce and ginger sauce. We all ravaged it.

Amazingly fast and healthy meal. I followed instructions here to the letter and was very pleasantly surprised at how it turned out! I like my fish barely cooked /seared but if you like it more well done just add a minute or 2 to total cook time. I also splashed a bit of Balsamic on them in the pan once I flipped over for the last 1.5 mins and it made a nice sauce that I could use to drizzle over the green beans I served with it.  Even without this addition a fantastic and fast dish (10 mins total prep and cook time!) .

This was incredible! I used previously frozen Ahi tuna streaks (individually sealed in a large bag). Each steak was between five and six ounces, so they were perfect for this recipe. The peppercorns did smoke a bit, and everyone was sneezing, but that didn't last long and everyone loved the silky, melt-in-your-mouth result. I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to prepare it over medium-rare, and even that's overdoing it a bit as Ahi should be rare.  Served with teriyaki noodles and soy sauce (though entirely unnecessary) and wouldn't change a thing! Well worth a few sneezes!

Ok.....WE LOVE AHI!!!  This recipe might be our new favorite!   As advised (per another review), I soaked the peppercorns in EVOO.  I put a shallot and garlic in with the olive oil and peppercorns as I seared the ahi. Deglazed pan with white wine, squeeze of lemon and balsamic glaze. Served with black rice and salad with wasabi dressing. And, of course, finished the open bottle of white wine with this fabulous meal!!!!  Thank you  so much for sharing this top notch recipe!!!!

Excellent 
Followed suggestion to add garlic powder, less salt,  and high heat with cracked peppers. It did get smoky.

Great recipe! I have to confess that I’m salt-averse due to hypertension and other conditions, so I didn’t bother with measuring; I simply applied a small amount of very finely ground sea salt and cayenne. Only a few of the peppercorns popped, but the softening was wonderful, making them very easy to chew. I’m certain that I’ll be making this again!

This one's definitely a keeper!  Based on other reviews, I cut back the salt to a couple of short grinds on either side of the tuna,  and doubled the ground cayenne, which I rubbed into the tuna.  To avoid smoking, sauteed the peppercorns on the low side of medium and smashed them with the back of a spatula once they softened.  Seared tuna for 30 seconds per side for rare.  Served with wasabi sauce on the side.  Yummy, and a big hit with my guests.

I've made Ahi steak recipes, this is not only the easiest, but the best!   I was skeptical about all the 5-star reviews at first, but no more.  This is a recipe I'll definitely make again.

I made no changes and it was just delicious. When you have a really good piece of fish, simple is better. I did add a splash of lemon after it was done and I cooked mine a couple of minutes on each side.

I did not use peppercorns. I simply seasoned the thawed steaks with salt pepper and red pepper. Heated the skillet with oil and butter and cooked aprox. 1 min and half each side. I then sliced the steaks and drizzled them with lemon juice and put wasabi on each piece we ate. It was a total hit!!!! delicious.

Made precisely as written! Huge hit! Only recommendation is to just use regular pepper instead of peppercorns next time.  Took no time to make.

The only thing I did differently than the directions was not measure. I just eyeballed everything. I did season the tuna while the peppercorns were in the oil and butter already. I did see someone else who mentioned that. I just sprinkled what I thought would be the right amount of salt and red pepper for my family. Try to remember that most fish is quite bland but picks up seasoning easily.  My 13 year old, sushi/sashimi loving son, was thrilled with this dinner. Will make it again.

I thought it was terrific and simple.  For me it is a sure 5 star rating.  I did one modification, I added some green peppercorns to the normal peppercorns because I felt they might add some dimension to the pepper flavor.  

I am curious if the folks who thought was too salty used Kosher salt.  Kosher salt is different than other salts.  

Cheers, and thanks for simple and awesome!

Great recipe for a first timer. However, I did some things differently. I used less salt. I used pink peppercorns. I only cooked 30 seconds on each side. I also find guests to be happy to have soy sauce as an optional condiment for the Ahi. Will definitely cook again.

We loved it.  I had 3 nice size tuna steaks and used the ingredients pretty liberally. 1 1/2 mins on each side was perfect timing to just sear them. Yummy. Thank you!

Delicious! This recipe is a keeper. Tuna iI usually make is  too dry, as I tend to overlook in broiler. Searing in the pan turned out with just enough pink inside. The ingredients were flavorful, easy, and I would not change a thing.

I feel like the cook times are too long. A minute each side would have been better for me. Mine did not come out very pink at all. It was however very tasty, I added a blend of seasonings to mine. The blend included; cayenne pepper, garlic & onion powder, black pepper, salt, oregano and basil. I also drizzled a bit of oyster sauce over top after they were plated :)

I made a salad with cut up cucumber, red onion, and jalapenos splashed with white vinegar to accompany the tuna steak. Was awesome! I did added more cayenne pepper. I also had to cook the pepper corns longer than it suggested and they never cracked.

I added pepper and chili powder, which upped the taste, but the peppercorns themselves did little to add to the taste. It may also just be my love of sushi and raw fish, but 1 to 1.5 minutes seems too long for searing ahi tuna

I burned the peppercorns, and I forgot to season the tuna until after I'd flipped it... but it was still delicious! I used ground, dried chipotle instead of cayenne (I like the smoky note). I used half as much kosher salt as the recipe called for, and will use even less salt next time.

Made as instructed. The peppercorns were not popping, so I scooped them out and added some ground pepper to the tuna steak. Seared for about 1 min each side. This turned out great. Served with soy sauce and wasabi.

Super easy to make, and quite deelish.  Don't be afraid to add the red pepper, as it seems to absorb it without leaving it very hot.

So simple and easy! I'll probably use half the salt next time - too salty. My cast iron skillet worked great. I overcooked it by leaving it in the pan while waiting for another dish before serving. Next time I'll remove it right away so it doesn't continue cooking.

This is my first time cooking tuna steaks and I was really nervous.  The dish was perfect, I did add just a dash of lemon for me.....I'm still teaching myself to like fish. I love that this recipe was simple and easy to folllow. I did use a cast iron skillet as well which (I think) made it even better.

Loved this! The tuna tasted delicious and it is so quick and simple to make. I just waited for the first few peppercorns to pop to avoid the smokey kitchen. Definitely will be making again!

I might crunch a few of the peppercorns to give more of a crust on top

I doubled the amount of peppercorns, halfed the salt and added a tablespoon of sugar to the fish seasoning.
For a rare tuna anywhere between 10 to 30 seconds a side is enough, anymore and the fish overcooks.
For a sauce I used soy sauce, lime juice, sesame oil, ginger, and Mandarin orange peel. 
I'm allergic to fish, but I made this for my girlfriend's birthday and she absolutely loved it.

I made this last night and it was EASY and tasted DELISH!!  Prepared according to the recipe with the exception of using an 1/8th tsp. of salt instead of 1/4 tsp.  My husband said make sure you make note to make this again real soon.....  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and delicious and wicked flavorful! I found this to be right on the edge of too spicy without crossing that line. This is a bang-bang meal and a great one at that. Be prepared to cook and then serve quickly. Good choice if you are looking to leave the impression that you have extraordinary cooking skills. Worth investing in a cast iron skillet. Not a meal that would make my regular rotation but only because I want it to be special.

This was a very easy and good tuna recipe.   I took the suggestions of a couple of the reviewers on the peppercorns - first I soaked them in the oil, and secondly I cooked them, covered (I used a splatter screen), and they popped well.  I don't think the age of the peppercorn stops the popping  -possibly this method helps overcome the “old age” :)  as I have had mine for quite some time!  I did not use butter, but used avocado oil for the searing, again using the splatter screen; thus I had no smoking problem. I used seafood seasoning in lieu of cayenne. Be sure to try eating the peppercorns as the cooking softens and gives them a very mild flavor.  Thank you, Bethany Joyful, for the recipe as you set me on the path to cook our tuna to our individual taste.

I did like the recipe, but the first time I made it the fish was well done. The second time, I reduced cooking time to 45 seconds per side and it was much better.

Super yummy. Definitely let the pepper corns soak, and create the white wine reduction at the end. I also used red pepper infused olive oil. I lightly brushed the tuna with a mixture of soy sauce, cayenne, & lemon pepper. Omit the salt.

Excellent recipe. I had whole pepper corns in a grinder that I couldn't open. I just put it on largest grind and ground them into the butter/oil. Worked fine. Might use a little more cayenne next time since I winged it with a light sprinkling. I served it with chopped cucumber and green onion salad with Italian dressing on it. Was a lovely, easy meal.

I made this exactly as written and it was way better then I thought it would be.  We will make it again!   My presentation was lacking and I will fix that, but the flavor was great!   Make the pan hot, sear it quickly on both sides, let it rest on a separate plate, (for a few minutes), slice and serve!

I tried several times to make a nice seared tuna because my husband and I like it so much. It never turned out quite right UNTIL I found THIS recipe. Perfect every time! I only use half the amount of salt & cayenne  (and we like spicy!). This time around I crushed the peppercorns a bit & added sesame seeds just before I added the tuna.

Oh man, I wish I had read the reviews before making this.  I followed the recipe and the amount of salt on the fish made it inedible.

Made it tonight. Super easy and the combination of the butter and olive oil made the taste just perfect. Hubby said it was a grand slam. The cayenne pepper did not make it too spicy. I think I might bump it up a little more since I like spicy.

Took the advice of others & decreased the salt by half knowing that olive oil smokes @ high heat  I cooked right on Med  heat, turned out perfectly! Will definately do again !

I followed  a few of your advises and used black pepper (no peppercorn in the house), switched out the olive oil with flavorless coconut cooking oil, (no smoking up this house), then added a little bit of white wine at the end (Boone's Farm Strawberry Hill Flavored Citrus white wine,  is all I had). Everything else was the same. I poured the wine "sauce" over the steaks at the end. Everyone LOVED it! My husband said it tasted just like steak.  Who would have guessed something this easy to make could taste this amazing?

First time I tried making Ahi Tuna at home and it was a hit!  This is a very easy recipe with no exotic flavors.  The peppercorns added a mild "smokiness" as best as I could tell.  I served on a bed of spring lettuces with lemon quarters.  I also added white wine to the pan after removing the tuna steaks and served the reduction.  We all liked the tuna better without the reduction although 1 person used her lemon.  (Doubled recipe and made 4 servings.)

Such an easy and delicious meal!  I cooked the peppercorns for about 10 minutes in a covered cast iron skillet. My husband doesn't eat anything rare, so I cooked them for 2 minutes on both sides for medium.  Served the ahi Tuna Steaks with quinoa and broccoli for an excellent meal in 20 minutes!

All I can say is HOLY COW.  Amazingly wonderful recipe.  Good tuna has always intimidated me, but no longer.  I have impressed my boyfriend and several friends when I made this for them.

TIP:  If you have not sliced tuna before I would highly recommend finding a YouTube video to walk you through the process.  Otherwise, a perfect, expensive piece of tuna, will be a tangled mess.

I tried this tonight because my husband is a truck driver and I wanted to practice so I could surprise him when he comes home next week.  I have made Salmon, Talapia, etc...But never attempted seared Tuna.  I left out the cayenne (not that into spicy seafood) other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was AWESOME!  Next time I will only cook MAX 1 minute per side.  It was a little well done for me at 1.5 minutes per side.  Even the peppercorn softened and popped for me and added a wonderful flavor.  I can't wait to say "surprise! We're having seared Ahi Tuna tonight"

LOVED this recipe. Tuna is my favorite fish, but I had never made it myself before last night! I had two tuna steaks from Fresh Market in the freezer and decided to try this. I did everything except use cayenne and kosher salt. I couldn't find my cayenne, so I used Cajun seasoning and I used my garlic sea salt instead of kosher. I love my tuna rare, so that's where I messed up. I think I did 3 minutes on each side and that was way too long. The pan will be VERY hot, so if you want it rare, you have to move quickly. They were still delicious, but way more cooked than I like. I'm going to go to FM and get more! Thanks for sharing!

I looooooved this recipe. I have never eaten a tuna steak before and now I think I am in love. I don't know if it was the tuna from Trader Joe's or the recipe itself, but this was fantastically delicious. I made it almost exactly as instructed except I didn't have peppercorns or butter, so I swapped them for ground pepper and coconut oil, respectively. I also think I would have liked my steaks slightly more rare, so I will be searing for 1 min on each side next time.

This was so amazingly easy and tasted wonderful. Definitely turn on the hood fan as there is some smoke while heating the peppercorns (as others encountered). I also cooked it less than the 1 1/2 minutes on each side to keep it fairly raw. This is one that will be printed and kept in the recipe book.

Do not use olive oil for high heat. It smokes too much. Canopy or vegetable is better for fish at high heat.

With such a beautiful protein I was looking for simple, but flavorful. I didn't want anything that would overpower the flavor of the tuna. This recipe fits the bill! Just fancy enough with the pepper technique to impress my family...with little effort!

First, butter on medium high with the peppercorns burned in 5 min.  I pitched that and started again on medium & it took a while for the peppercorns to soften.  I think I would have preferred crushed pepper as it did not coat the steaks the way I hoped.  I cooked the first side for 2 min but I should have left off the lid bc they cooked (Steamed?) too quickly. The other side I kept to 1 1/2 min.  I think the fish was a bit dry and (still slightly pink but) over cooked.  The taste was good but I would liked to have a more even coat of peppercorns. I also found it difficult to slice into neat strips. I think the recipe is OK/good but my execution wasn't great so I hope my notes help someone.

Bland recipe, just some heat from the cayenne pepper and pepper corns. 1.5 minutes per side on medium high is nearly well done.  Tolerable at best.

Great recipe. Super easy. The only change I made was to use less salt. I sprinkled coarsely ground sea salt on the filets but only used about 1/4 tsp in total. I couldn't get the peppercorns to pop, either, as some other reviewers mentioned, so I ended up crushing them with the flat side of a meat pounder while still in the skillet, before putting in the ahi tuna filets. It worked perfectly, coating the tuna in crushed peppercorns as it seared. I did cut back slightly on the time. I cooked it for only 60 seconds on each side and it was perfectly done. 90 seconds, as the recipe specifies, would have resulted in overcooked tuna. Next time I'm going to pre-crush the peppercorns.

Phenomenal. Only change is to reduce the salt a bit. I had a very smoky house afterwards but it was so worth it.

Excellent! Simple, tasty.  I couldn't get the peppercorns to pop before the oil/butter started smoking, but it didn't affect the recipe.  I've now included this in my recipe box.

I agree about the salt. Maybe decrease by half. Also, I would reduce the cooking time by just a little for rare. Other than that, outstanding! I prefer it cold.

Simple, quick, and spectacular. My wife doesn't like the kick of cayenne, but a pinch of chipotle was a great, milder alternative.

It requires just a few very common ingredients, and was very simple to prepare. 

The only recommendation I would make, would be to not heat up the oil/pepper too long before searing the fish because its easy to burn when it's by itself int he pan.

For a bonus, I poured the extra juice/oil/pepper left in the pan into a pot of boiling water and asparagus for an easy clean up and a delicious and healthy side-dish!

Excellent!!!! My husband and I LOVED this! A little over cooked for my liking (I like ahi pretty rare) so next time I will probably cook for about 45 seconds to a minute on each side, but otherwise very, very delicious. We didnt use as much salt and also used wasabi/soy sauce for dipping but it really didnt need it at all.  My house also got pretty smokey but it was a nice night to open the windows and door anyway. We cant wait to cook this when we have company!

I used the calculator to determine the amounts for 3 servings. My steaks were 3/4" thick. I used 1/3 the recommended salt amount and cooked them for 1 minute on each side for rare. They came out perfect!

I made this for my family last night and it was a huge hit! I followed the directions exactly with one small exception ( I sprinkled a little of cajun's choice blackened seasoning on top of the tuna steak before searing it) I loved watching the peppercorns pop! It was fun, easy, and absolutely delicious!! I will make this my permanent seared ahi steak recipe for sure!

Cooks perfectly. I added some dried seaweed and some other seasonings, and served atop a bed of soba noodles. Yum.

Made this for the first time tonight. Hubby loved it! Turned the heat down to medium, and skipped the cayenne pepper, as I didn't have any, and I also cooked it three minutes per side as someone suggested for less rare. Came out great, still pink in the center, but nice crust and flavor.

Very tasty, qucik and easy...my three favorite things in a recipe.  This is the second time I've made this recipe.  The first time, I didn't have any smoke...this time I had to cover my smoke alarm with a dish towel!!  (Not sure what happened there)  Nonetheless, both times resulted in a very tasty dish.

YUM!   Loved the peppery flavor.  I didn't have Ahi steaks, at least they weren't marked that, so I cooked 3 min on a side in a cast iron skillet.  Will definately do this again!

This recipe has way too much salt that it overpowers the tuna.  It is a good base to tweek and create future recipes--the peppercorn, butter, olive oil, and timing is spot on. Otherwise, this dish is basically taking a bite out of the ocean with a hint of heat.

Delicious! It was really easy to make and even better to eat! The only problem was that I actually couldn't cook the peppercorns that long! They started popping out of the pan! So that's when I just put the fish in. But it was still really yummy. I'll definitely make it again!

Loved the recipe, but used Celtic sea salt instead, finely ground in a mortar.  I too, will lower the heat on the burner, even if the peppers don't "pop".  This was delicious.  My Japanese husband would like wasabi on the side!

I went ahead and followed other reviewers advice and toned down the salt to just a pinch per steak. I also coated the steaks with white and black sesame seed mixed with the cayenne and course black pepper. Once the white sesame seeds turned golden, my ahi was done. I served with a side of soy sauce and a lemon wedge. It was divine!

I'm a beginner so this was exactly what i was looking for ... easy with ingredients already on hand.  Instead of popping the peppercorns, i ground pepper onto the steaks and instead of kosher salt, I used beer salt (lemon-lime salt).  Turned out fantastic!  Love the little heat from the cayenne and twang from the lemon salt.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the easy to follow recipe!

Quick and easy.  I tried popping the peppercorns in the oil/butter, but they didn't oblige, so I just patted on coarse ground pepper.  Delicious.

Excellent....first time cooking tuna and this was stunningly easy and good. Mine was triangular in shape so cut 2"x2" +/- covered with oil, SnP and cayene...my hubby thought to peppery but I loved it. It is what gives you the crust. 45 seconds/side. Nice crust and raw but warm centre!!! Yummy!!!

Made this Friday night for my boyfriend. Wonderful!!!! I didn't do the peppercorn thing. I just pressed the salt and peppers into both sides of the fish and cooked for 2 and 1/2 minutes on each side over medium heat.  The tuna came out medium rare, which is what I wanted.  Very very flavorful.  I'm making it  again tonight, and it's just Monday.

Amazing! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and sprinkled pepper on the ahi tuna, rather than popping the peppercorns. I seared each side for 2 minutes and only the very center of the fish was slightly raw--which I was okay with.

Just had this for dinner and it was delicious and loved the whole pappercorns with the tuna on completion.  I cooked two tuna steaks and sprinkled both sides with cayenne and kosher salt and even more pepper.  Next time I would use a little more cayenne for the heat.  Very good tho.

I am a novice cook who is very intimidated by cooking fish.  I am constantly trying different recipes for tuna steaks and this is the first one that I actually liked.  I eyeballed how much olive oil and butter I used, but I probably used 2 tbl spoons of butter.  After the pan heated up, I added the peppercorns (again eyeballed), and waited until they popped before I added the tuna steak.  Also, I coated my steaks in a prepackaged salmon seasoning.  My boyfriend doesn't like his Tuna as rare as I do, so I let it cook for 3 mins on each side.  There was a beautiful dark crunchy coating on the outside.  This recipe is soooo good!

This was great! I actually just ground the fresh pepper into the skillet instead of trying to pop the peppercorns.  Hubby loved it.

Recipe was great and easy! Skipped cracking the peppercorns, and simply put black cracked pepper right on steaks before searing, it was delicious! Follow timing guidelines for steaks, overcooks very quickly. Also, we put a lid on the pan when searing, and it cooked a bit too quick. Nonetheless, will make it again for sure!

Terrific! Based on reviews of smoking peppercorns, I skipped that step and just sprinkled salt, pepper, and cayenne on each side of the tuna steaks and then cooked them in the melted butter and oil mixture. Very easy, good flavor. I eyeballed the salt and 1 tsp of course kosher salt is about right. I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have peppercorns so I left that out.  I had to cook longer than recipe called for - maybe 4 minutes per side?  I don't remember.

Very nice, need to cook pepercorns longer, and cover for tenderness.  Clearly a recipe for company.

My fiance and I made this dish for Valentine's day.  We felt that the peppercorn "cracking" step was unnecessary and filled the whole house with smoke (as other reviewers mentioned).  With the other peppers that are in the dish, it's spicy enough and the peppercorn doesn't add much.  I would just do the other spices and skip that step entirely.  Otherwise it was good and very easy!!!

This recipe was good. I like to add a citrus cutney- a fab place here in Sonoma, the Eldorado Kitchen, uses a Blood Orange one. I'm gonna try that next time.

This was delicious - reduced the salt a little as others noted, but otherwise didn't change anything. Wasn't sure if it was OK to eat the peppercorns :) but tried them and they're VERY tasty.

Great easy recipe.  I used red pepper instead of cayenne and it still came out great.
