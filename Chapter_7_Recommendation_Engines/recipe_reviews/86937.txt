I enjoyed this, but would suggest using chicken or steak rather than tuna. I  might try using other vegetables rather than peas for a change of flavor. It was a bit dry for our taste. I suggest using some chicken, beef or vegetable broth to the mixture.

This was really good. I thought it was a bit salty but my family loved it and my DH (a very picky eater) loved it. I think next time I'm going to try fresh tun instead of  canned, I think it might make the flavor more savory rather than salty.

I actually enjoyed this though I was getting a bit frustrated trying to get enough flavor into it. Added fresh basil, fresh parsley and thyme and a considerable amount of parmesan with an addition of "pasta" water from the multigrain penne. Next time I will also put in some capers or kalamata olives.

Healthy and tasty!  I used turkey bacon, sweet white wine, and portobello mushrooms.  Don't skimp on the salt.

This was good, and a hit with my husband! I added more crushed red pepper, about a cup of wine, went more generous on the olive oil, substituted 2 chopped tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes, canned peas for the frozen peas, 8 oz frozen broccoli for the spinach, and regular bacon for the pancetta. It was surprisingly tasty! Will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but it was kind of dry. I left the mushrooms out and used turkey bacon and whole grain penne to make it healthier.

This is a great way to do something different with canned tuna!  It's quick and easy to prepare, a very "pretty" dish to present.  My boys and I like it alot.

The recipe is quick and easy to make but rather bland.  I like the veggies and it's healthy but needs something more.

This was OK. The pancetta is pretty expensive, it caught me off guard, because this was the first time ever buying it. A little too much lemon and salt.  Liked that it had lots of different veggies though. Don't think I would make again. Sort of boring. Needs more sauce.

This was good... but it's missing something.  It's really light and I did not find it to be salty at all.  If anything, it needed more seasoning.

This was absolutely delicious!!! The whole family loved it. The saltiness of the pancetta was fabulous with the wine and lemon flavors. Such a great mixture of the peas, mushrooms, tomatoes and spinach!

If you use the mushrooms this sauce is not dry. They let off a lot of liquid as they cooked. I had to sub lime for lemon and bacon for the Pancetta. I cooked the bacon in a little cayenne and brown sugar to add more flavor. I was unsure about the lime substitute but it worked very well. Try adding the citrus zest if you are worried about it being bland. I garnished with crumbled feta. That also added more flavor. Fresh basil or parsley would brighten this dish up also. My sauce was rather thin so I added some reserved cooking water from the pasta. A nice combination of simple ingredients that results in a fairly elegant dish.

I did not put the pancetta in because I used smoked canned tuna. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. This recipe went together quicker than I thought it would! It was easy! I'd make it again.

Made this with fresh shrimp instead of tuna. Family loves this pasta. It tastes refreshing and the vegetables make it light and colorful.

Delicious and very flavorful.  I was looking for a recipe to use up pancetta.  I omitted mushrooms and parmesan, halved the amount of pasta (I used angel hair).  Joke on me, I forgot to add the fried pancetta back in to the dish, and didn't miss it.  I agree with anther reviewer -- it's a little salty.
