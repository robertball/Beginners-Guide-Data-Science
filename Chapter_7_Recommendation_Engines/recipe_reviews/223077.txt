This wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be.  Really RICH!!! but so worth the time.
everything turned out except the custard.  I never made it before and I think I was suppose to continuously stir but I was  sidetracked and by the time I got back to the stove it was thick..I did strain it but it had a weird consistency..used it anyway..still tasted ok, next time I will not leave my custard alone for a second lol   Thanks for the recipe

I loved the ease, haven't tasted it, wish there was reviews because the final layer came out like water, so sad.  I put it in the mixer and had fluffy frosting.  Anyone try this, who is good at making ganache?  Somebody help me
