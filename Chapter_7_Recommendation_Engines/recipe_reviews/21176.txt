This recipe is delicious. To reply to TMCLARTY, who said, "I thought the taste of this was rather odd... it tasted way too tangy/mustardy. I didn't have any honey, so I used honey dijon mustard... but I probably wouldn't make it again. Sorry."
All I can say is, please do NOT review recipes if you do not follow the recipe. This isn't fair. If you didn't use any honey and substituted more mustard in place of it, of course it tasted odd and way too mustardy. You didn't follow the recipe. Shame on you for leaving a bad review when you didn't use the correct ingredients called for in the recipe! Please, from now on, don't leave a review unless you followed the recipe.

After reading all the rave reviews on this dish I decided to make it for my husband's birthday. Even though it looked amazing this is possibly the WORST recipe I have ever used for salmon. Don't bother wasting your ingredients. It is bland bland bland. I used an expensive salmon fillet which was more or less wasted and great pecans that could have been put to better use. Next time I will stick to my tried and tested recipe: a 1/4 cup white wine, some freshly squeezed lemon juice, salmon steaks or fillets, 1 tsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried oregano and freshly minced garlic, salt & pepper to taste. Cover and poach it for about 15 minutes top with a splash of extra virgin olive oil and it's the tastiest salmon you'll ever eat.

Both my husband and myself absolutely love this recipe.  We have found that it works best if you skin the salmon and then coat all sides of it, it augments the flavor all around.  Also, the honey-mustard-butter coating makes A LOT.  You can generally halve it without too much trouble.

PLEASE ignore the review below that called this the "worst" recipe. It isn't the least bit bland, but if you like more spice you can easily add a bit of cayenne or red pepper to taste. My family and I have been enjoying this recipe for years. I do use cornbread crumbs instead of breadcrumbs when I have them on hand -- just freeze a piece of cornbread if you have any left over, or use those new cornbread crackers I've seen in the grocery store. Serve with a sweet corn and black bean salad, fresh buttered green beans and chocolate pudding cake with vanilla ice cream and you have a stellar meal.

Wow, this is a heck of way to serve salmon. I made this this evening and it came out great. I didn't "brush each salmon fillet lightly" though. Instead I spread the honey butter dijon sauce on rather thickly by letting the butter sauce start to harden up a bit before brushing it on. For the bread crumb topping, I put the pecans in a zip lock baggy and pounded them with a rolling pin until they were sort of the consistency of rough ground coffee and I chopped the parsley pretty fine too. Then I used the topping generously but not excessively. Very flavorful. Very easy to make. A definite keeper.

Two thumbs up! This is, hands-down, one of the best recipes I've got from this site. I can't believe that other reviewers aren't drooling over it as much as we are! I've cooked a lot of salmon and this is one great recipe. It was absolutely delicious and very simple to make. Instead of breadcrumbs I used crushed bruschetta, although any sort of crackers would work quite nicely. I used a 1/2 cup of butter since I love saucey sauces. I skipped the nuts since I didn't have any on hand - tastes just fine without them. Instead of fresh parsley I used 1 teaspoon dried. I loved having extra sauce and I served it at the table so people could help themselves. Yum!!!!

I just wanted to comment on some of the negative reviews for this recipe... I have been making a variation of this recipe for years (just the honey & dijon by itself with a little salt & pepper baked - a little healthier without the crumbs and nuts for those watching carbs) and it the compliment of the honey/dijon with the salmon is outstanding!  That said, I think the people that didn't like this recipe are looking for more of a salmon-y taste.  This recipe balances out the extreme fishiness of salmon (a turn-off for many people, myself included) and, while extremely delicious for those of use that appreciate it, it can definitely be a disappointment if you are looking for a real salmon-y flavor.  If that is what you are interested in, stick with the normal white wine & lemon recipe.  If you love milder fish and dislike the real fishy taste of salmon, this is DEFINITELY the recipe for you!

It was great... the first time I made this I didn't have peacans so I used Almonds and that was very good, but I figured the second time I'd follow the directions completely so I made it with the Peacans and it was outstanding.  I would say that this recipe is for people who like nuts and nice crunchyness to complement otherwise a delicate meal.  This recipe also allows for room to play with the amount of spicyness by using more, less, or different strengths/types of mustard.  I'm giving it an A.

This was EXCELLENT!!!!!!  I usually grill my salmon - year round (Firecracker Salmon - my fav), but was running short on time this eve.  I didnt have any pecans, so I elimated them.  I used Progresso Italian Bread Crumbs which I added some melted butter to, to make a nice crumbly mixture, as well as additional parsley.  When it was done, I squeezed fresh lemon juice over the top.  EVERYONE HERE LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!  Served it w/ a salad and some roasted baby carrots and it was GREAT!  Will make this again!!!!!!!!

I don't like salmon.  Luis loved this recipe.  I am looking forward to making it for him again.  He liked it so much that he started eating it before his lunch time.  He had to restrain himself from eating it all.  

2/11/2011
I made this for Luis again.  Central Market had Yukon 
Keta salmon for $8.49/lb which was a sale price.  (8) fillets cost $22.92.  I laid out all the ingredients and measuring cups to make sure that we had everything.  I had Organic Dijon mustard and chopped pecans left over from the last time i made this.  I follow the advice of others and only used (1) Tbsp of honey each time.  I used Italian seasoned Progresso bread crumbs.  I had to buy fresh Italian flat leaf parsley and salmon from Central Market.  I spread the thick honey mustard sauce on w/ a spatula onto each fillet, then used tongs to take it out of this goo, then laid it into a 4 Qt Oxo bowl of the bread crumb mixture and spooned and patted the crumbs over the fillets, then used the tongs to put each fillet into (2) different cast iron skillets that had been oiled.  I cooked the fillets approx (12) minutes b/c our gas oven runs hot and does not have temperature control.  Since the cast iron skillets hold the heat and the food continues to cook this was enuf time.  I woke Luis up to eat the salmon and he really enjoyed it.  I wish I liked salmon, but I love fixing it for Luis:) This is a good lunch dish for Luis.  He never brings it back home, unlike the Tuna casserole dish.

The best advice I can give you is TASTE the honey mustard mixture before you spread it on your fish, if you don't like it there, you won't like it on the fish so adjust it accordingly, add cracked black pepper, more honey, try whole grain mustard, adjust it until it appeals to you, then you know you will enjoy it on the fish.  I know the recipe says lightly but I smeared it on a little heavier.      I also opted or more pecans than breadcrumbs, I don't like "fillers" when I can avoid them.  Don't go out and buy breadcrumbs, if you have a food processor on your counter, use it! Grab a chunk of that baguette in your fridge and pulse it to crumbs, I used half a buttermilk biscuit left over for lunch and then chopped pecans, pulsed it in the processor to a coarse meal.        You can also substitute walnuts for this as well and it would be good.      For using frozen salmon filets instead of fresh, thaw your filets in cold water until pliable, dry them off with a paper towel and continue on with the recipe normally.     I also suggest making a little extra of the dijon honey spread, even after smearing it on liberally, the flavor really didn't come out in the fish, a drizzle over the top of the finished filet or a little puddle next to it is a good addition.   If you have extra beyond that, if you cut it with a bit of cider vinegar turning it to a dressing its a nice accompaniment tossed with a little fresh baby spinach.

I didn't have pecans or parsley, so I just salt&peppered some bread crumbs and sprinkled them over the top.  We really enjoyed it!  We've done the white wine poach thing to death and were happy to have the change to something different.
Someone in these reviews talked about how some people don't follow the recipe, substitute ingredients, and then give the recipe a bad review....I can't stand it when people do that!  Give the recipe a fair try at least, and have the brains to realize that it might not be to your taste and that it probably isn't a bad recipe at all....especially when you see that lots of other people like it.

My first 5* rating!  What a fantastic tasting salmon!  Probably great with chicken too!  Suggestions: 1.  Mix the sauce in the baking dish rather than only brushing it on. 2.  Cook any veggies like broccoli or carrots in the same baking dish with the same sauce.  Yummy!

This was WONDERFUL! I Love salmon, butusually eat it grilled cause I hate the fishiness of baked fish. This recipie changed my view on baking fish, it was so tender and delicious I could have eaten 5 more pounds of it. I didnt use pecans because I hate nuts, so i added 2 cloves of garlic instead. I also used a mix of dijon and horseradish dijon, it gave it a nice flavor. I will be making this dish again I can promise you that!!!:::ON A SIDE NOTE::: I Eat this dish alot. 90% of my salmon i make this way, but the more I eat it the more i realize that 1 1/2 Tablespoons of honey is TOO much, i suggest about 1 or LESS. My; and im sure your guests would agree that less sweet is better but still 5 stars!

Fantastic!  Thanks, Arnie!  I took the advice of other reviewers and made these modifications, and it came out perfect:  season the filets with salt & pepper prior to adding the mustard/honey mixture, painted the sauce on thickly by allowing it to firm a bit first, marinated it in the brushed-on sauce for 2 hours, & added a little olive oil to the breadcrumb mixture to get it brown and crispy.  Served it with rice that had a vegetable soup mix cooked in with it.  My family loved it!

I am a salmon lover, and this is probably the best salmon I've ever had...definitely the best that I've ever made at home.  Because of warnings about an overwhelming mustard taste, I was careful to follow the directions of using just a light coating of sauce on the filets...then I served some of the extra sauce on the side for dipping.  It was wonderful, the pecans added a great sweet crunch, and my guests loved it.  Will make this again and again.

This is a wonderful recipe! A co-worker gave this recipe a few years ago and told me to double the topping ingredients.  I serve it over a bed of steamed spinach - my family requests it often. Anyone that thinks this reciped bland, should just increase the topping!

I followed the recipe exactly as posted and I found the dijon crust to be very bland. Fortunately I had enough of the honey dijon dressing left over to use as a sauce on the side which somewhat saved it. pretty disappointed overall. it's unlikely i'll be using this recipe again.

This is a quick, easy and very tasty way to prepare salmon.  If you like to taste your salmon and not have it overpowered by a sauce or marinade, try this one.  Shame, shame to reviewers that changed the ingredients and then trashed this recipe.  You should always try a recipe as written and then adjust it to your personal taste.  For those of us in a cold climate, this is a great way to enjoy salmon when the BBQ is put away for the winter.  No need to change anything in this recipe.  Very nice Arnie, thanks.

Wow- this is the best salmon recipe I have found. I made this for my husband and then I made it 2 more times within the next month for guests. It was a huge hit and everyone was wondering what was in it. I used ground pecans and it seemed to mix better with the bread crumbs. A keeper!

Have been making this recipe for almost 10 years and it is still my "go to" recipe for company and have always had rave reviews...even by people who don't particularly like salmon. Try different mustards and honeys for a change....add orange instead of lemon, or use marmalade instead of honey.

1Use a good salmon such as Alaskan or Coho. 2) To insure not to much mustard flavor, add the mustard (to taste) to the honey and then add it to the butter. 3) To control the consistency of the coating, stir the bread into the butter - mustard - honey mixture. Then add the parsley and nuts. 4) If you are baking a thicker fillet of salmon, you can insure a more even baking by first sauting the salmon for a minute or two in a skilet. (Hopefuly the skin will stick to the skillet and can be discarded.) Put the salmon in the baking pan, add the topping and put the salmon in the oven to finish. 5)I prefer to skin the salmon. If your salmon is frozen, you can lift one corner of the skin from the salmon filet and pull and the skin will easily be removed with no waste.

I don't care for salmon at all, but my husband loves it, so I find myself cooking it alot and looking for a way to cook it that I can stand it. This was just the recipe, this was so good, now even I can't wait to have salmon again, I've made this twice now, the second time I just olive oil, dijon,garlic, and lemon juice.Then topped with crumbs it turned out good also.
Thanks so much for sharing

Very good dish - I didn't have dijon mustard so I had to substitue honey mustard.  I also did not have pecans but the dish was still great!  I love the sauce and was very liberal in adding it - forget the 'brush lightly' and slather it on!!!

Yuck! One of the worst recipes I've tried from this website. If you like Mayo then I suppose the topping will appeal to you. Definitely not what I was hoping for with all the wonderful reviews.

This really is very good and very versatile.  I am not one to give 5 stars unless a recipe is extremely versatile, and has *unusually* excellent results.  Have used cornbread crumbs, walnuts, brown sugar, maple syrup etc. as subs with great success.  I really dislike salmon and still enjoyed this dish and hubby with thrilled - he likes salmon but hates nuts.  Really very good recipe!

This was a suprise, I liked it better than I thought I would. The honey-mustard mix went very well with the salmon and I used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. I'll make this again.

Ahh, now this is my kind of recipe.  It is soo easy to make and the taste is quite divine.  One thing I have done to make it even easier is make a big batch of the dry ingredients.  I suppose you could do the same for the honey, mustard, and butter but I have no idea how long it will keep for.  About the peacans.  I tried pecans the first time I made this.  The second time I used walnuts.  I seem to like the walnuts better.  Because I like the honey-mustard-butter thing I make extra and drizzle it over the the finished recipe.  This is one of my all time favorite recipes.

I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but this was out of this world!  I served it at a dinner party and it was a huge hit, one guest who does not like salmon was blown away and took home my copy of this recipe. I did use dried parsley because we had no fresh, but I don't think it changed the flavor. This is amazing!

I would give it 10 stars if I could.  My boyfriend doesn't like salmon, so I needed something really special.  This was wonderful.  We both loved it.  It was possibly the best salmon I've ever had.  I made it ahead and froze it, then just warmed it up.  It froze beautifully, and came out crispy and sweet.  I can't wait to have it again.  Very easy to make too.

I am not a fish person, until now.  My husband likes the occasional fish, but does not care for baked fish... that is until he ate this dish and I would have to agree.  I didn't have dijon mustard so I used yellow mustard and honey.  I've made this recipe twice, once with salmon and once with cod.  We didn't care for the salmon, but the cod was a BIG hit... even for my 2 year old son.

This is a very good recipe.  I like to use Ken's Honey Dijon Salad dressing as I don't keep Dijon mustard in my fridge.  I added fresh squeezed lemons when done cooking and make with a white rice.  Quick and easy.  I make this often.

This was delicious! I generally don't care for salmon but my husband really likes it so I have been managing to choke it down once or twice per week for a while now. Dreading tonight's meal, I searched at the last minute for something different from the typical lemon dill (yuck), maple (ick), or white wine-y (bleh) types of prep we're used to and found this recipe. I followed it pretty much as written - except used slivered almonds for pecans - but did take one reviewer's advice and let the honey/mustard mixture cool before slathering it on all sides of the fillet (I removed the skin first as also suggested)rather than just brushing it lightly on top. I also toasted panko crumbs and almonds in a skillet with a few drops of olive oil before adding the parsley and sprinkling them liberally on the fillets to make them super-crunchy. I actually enjoyed my salmon dinner tonight for the very first time! My husband loved it and said he wouldn't mind if I make it this way from now on, yay! The flavor is delicate, but really, really good! I had some mustard mix left over so I tossed my steamed green beans with it, which was also super delicious. Five stars!

My salmon took a little longer to cook than I expected since I had a 1.3. lb fillet. I tried to broil it, which made the topping nice and crunchy (and cooked the fish through) but it parts of the topping got a little burnt. I also only had walnuts & sunflower seeds- I'm sure pecans would be awesome. Overall though, really tasty. (Our side dish might have upstaged the fish.)

No complaint here. It's one of our favorite salmon recipes. I used panko instead of regular bread crumbs.

I followed the directions exactly. The butter/mustard/honey sauce was okay. However the pecan/breadcrumb topping was crispy on top and soggy underneath. It was like eating bready mush. Not a palate-pleaser.

I recommend one of the many other simple recipes that highlight salmon's delicate taste. This suffocated it.

This recipe wasn't my favorite. It tasted good. I used panko bread crumbs rather than regular because I love the crunch it gives as a crust. It was a little sweet for my taste as I like things a little more savory.

Simply delicious and by far my favorite thing to make! I tuaght this recipe to my older sister and mother and they think I'm a master chef (probably helps that they don't cook much! ha!). It's great because I can have this on the table in 20 minutes if I need to. Great to serve as a dinner party with rice and a veggie (I usually do carrots).

This recipe was quick, easy, and wonderful to present on your table! There was a bit too much honey for my taste, but that is because we love mustard in my house and just prefer that. I will use less honey next time, because I WILL be making this again. Thanks! (By the way, I dipped my filets in lots of the sauce, and coated them on all sides with bread crumbs)

I don't eat fish but like to make it for my wife. I wanted something other than a grill recipe and boy did this go over big.  Great taste and easy to make.

My family loved this recipe. My father said he liked it because it made the salmon flavorfull and not too "fishy".

Great recipe! I was going to cut out the pecans, but I'm so glad I didn't - the pecans will make or break this recipe. I also substituted bread crumbs with panko for a lighter taste.

I have made this recipe several times and it always comes out great. I omit the pecans and mix the bread crumbs with the butter instead. Today I had NONE of the ingredients instead I compromised and used spicy brown mustard, maple syrup, olive oil and ritz crackers. AWESOME. My teenage kids kept saying "This salmon is the bomb".  :)

I prepared this in a foil pan and cooked it on the grill. Just fabulous. The Dijon sauce was fantastic.
I will make this again anytime I have salmon.
It was so easy...and tasty. Absolutely five stars!

I made this for my girlfriend on mother's day and it came out delicious. It was probably the tastiest salmon I've cooked which isn't saying much considering I'm a beginning cook. She told me she could eat it every day of the week. We followed the recipe exactly as I like to do because I'm not much of an expert with tastes and spices. I served it with some rice pilaf and saute'd asparagus. Very good!

This was very easy and very good.  Next time I would leave out the honey ......I wasn't crazy about the sweet taste with the fish.  And, I would maybe spray some olive oil on top since mine did not get crispy on top.  But -- I will definitely make this again!!!

This is a favorite for my family, a permanent favorite. We’ve done it in oven or sometimes on cedar planks on grill. I use panko instead of regular bread crumbs, adds a nice crunch. This is delicious and easy, great for weeknight or company. Thanks so much for this recipe!

My husband complained when I told him that I was cooking salmon for dinner (his least favorite meal).  However, after tasting this recipe, he devoured his plate and begged me to let him eat part of mine!  DELICIOUS!

It wasn't our favorite. Maybe too sweet. The breading was great. Maybe less sauce would work for us.

We made this for part of our 7 Fishes Feast on Christmas Eve because the reviews looked promising. Followed the recipe exactly and.... Salmon is my favorite fish, and this recipe quite simply ruined the wonderful flavor of salmon. It was such a waste  (it was a lot!) Didn't seem like much of our family enjoyed it. It was a very odd flavor on fish. Perhaps it'd be better on chicken? My biggest disappointment from this website. Will never make again.

I am a salmon lover plus I lile to cook it for my family because of its health benefits BUT I did not know that this recipe was going to be the BEST salmon recipe I have tried thus far (& I've cooked quite a few!). I used sliced almonds instead of pecans as that's what I had on hand. Even my son who's a cod lover had only a good review.

I love this recipe.  It is really easy, very elegant and everyone that I have ever served this to just raves.  I have to say that my first attempt with salmon was with this dish and it is truly an awesome staple in our house that I serve time and time again.  The flavors are wonderful - this won't disappoint!  A tip: At Costco they sell frozen salmon fillets that are the PERFECT size for this recipe.  Look for them in the freezer section.  Yes, you get a lot of them but once you try this you will use them!)

I absolutely loved this salmon!  I am not a big fish eater, but add some flavor to it like this recipe does, and I will definately be eating more fish!!!  I cut the butter down to 2   Tablespoons and used Panko instead of plain bread crumbs (because it's what I had on hand).  It was moist, not soggy as others complained about.  The panko also added a nice crunch to the topping.  I WILL be making this one more often.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The salmon itself was a nice texture, but the top was just really soggy.  I followed the recipe exactly--may try to make again but will have to change things around or figure out what i did wrong.  Thanks anyway!

To make it more low-carb, omit the breadcrumbs and just use pecans, parsley, and dill.

Why is this a Hall of Fame Recipe?  I found this bland--it tasted like salmon with bread crumbs on it.  I have so many better salmon recipes so I think I will stick with my other dishes.

Simply delicious! I can only concur with the literally hundreds of reviewers before me. Tasty, simple, and very easy--a really fabulous way to cook a restaurant quality meal at home. Like a previous reviewer I substituted almond slivers, but next time I will try pistachios. There's no way you can lose with this recipe!

What a wonderfully easy and tasty recipe for salmon.  We loved the sweetness of the pecans in the bread crumbs.  Really added something to the dish.  This is a keeper!

This recipe is by far my boyfriend's favorite fish recipe, and we've tried many (trying to eat healthier).  Just be careful of how much you pack on on top of the fish, seems to slow cooking down a bit.  Otherwise, it's fantastic.  Especially with rice.

I've made this twice now.  The 2nd time I made more than the receipe calls for because it was so good.  Use fresh Salmon NOT frozen, and good mustard.  Second time I added a little more honey than what the receipe called for.  This is great receipe that I will be using frequently.

I usually cook for two people, my wife and me. So first thing is to reduce the recipe. I buy about 2/3 pound King or Coho. Stay away from the farmed Atlantic Frankenfish, if you don't use good fish, no recipe will fix it. I use 1 tbl each butter, honey and dijon mustard. IMO, parsley is pretty much a tasteless garnish. I substituted about 1/2 tsp dried dill which is super with fish and salmon in particular. Also added a generous amount of fresh ground pepper. I had no pecans (I'm sure dilish) so I used slivered almonds, a bit more crisp than pecans, but also very tasty. I used garlic herbed bread crumbs. Finally, I baked for about 18 minutes at 400 degrees. Still moist and firm but just beginning to flake. I've made this 3 times now and I'll make it again. Tastes great and easy to make.

This recipe was SO good that I printed out a copy and framed it to hang on my wall next to pictures of my children. Then I printed ANOTHER copy of this recipe and bought a wallet so that I could carry it around to show everyone I meet that I have a new best friend and when they wouldn't listen to me I shoved the recipe in their face and screamed "LOOK AT IT! IT'S BEAUTIFUL!! LOOOOK AT IT!!" Seriously though, I have made recipes from this site for a few years and I never felt compelled to write a review until now. Besides omitting the pecans ( I didn't have any) I followed the recipe to the T. It was by far the best salmon I have ever tasted and my family loved it too. For those that didn't like it and felt the need to give a bad review... I have some advice: Have someone who knows how to cook make it for you!

We absolutely loved it! My fiancé said it was the best salmon he'd ever had, and went back for seconds. He ate so much salmon that he didn't have room for ice cream, which is a first! 

This will become a staple in our house, since it was not only delicious but was so easy to prepare.  I actually added salt & pepper to the bread crumb mixture, which worked well. 

The honey mustard sauce has a nice tang (I only spread a thin layer on the top so it wasn't overpowering), and the bread crumbs gave the fish a good crunch. The pecans were an interesting addition (and one I never would have thought of; might also try with almonds or macadamia nuts sometime), and the fresh parsley was great (although in a pinch, dried parsley would probably work too).

I served it with wild rice and oven-roasted asparagus, and voilá - a gourmet meal on a Tuesday night!

This recipe is really good.  I didn't have parsley and I left out the pecans because one of my kids doesn't like nuts.  In place of the parsley I used oregano, basil and minced garlic, and I used Pancetta bread crumbs.  Very tasty.  This will be one of my go to recipes for Baked Salmon.

This recipe was something you would find at a fine restaurant from a gourmet chef. I've become so sick to death of lemon salmon, that I wanted to try something new, and am SO glad I did. This is a completely unique flavor, so if your just looking for a "different" lemon salmon recipe, this is NOT for you. Sweet, tangy, crunchy, and delicious. The first bite caught me off guard, but after a few more, I couldn't get enough. If you are wanting more bang with the spices, add some cayenne, but I honestly thought the flavors were amazing without it.

This was delicious! It was the perfect combinations of salty and sweet and flakey and crunchy. I left out the nuts and used Italian-flavored bread crumbs. Even my picky toddler and husband who won't eat something unless it's drowned in Sriracha ate it all as prepared. Will definitely make again!

Company fare! This wonderful recipe is perfect. I did not have pecans so I substituted chopped pistachios. The topping was crunchy and very tasty. It is now in my company folder as it is a recipe that I would be proud to serve to my guests.I am looking forward to trying with the pecans.
Thank you for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe as written.  The dijon taste overwhelmed the salmon, and the topping was really mushy.  I tried broiling it, and nothing helped.  I ended up scraping the topping off after a few bites.

My family loved this recipe.  I did alter it a bit.  Instead of the butter, I used virgin coconut oil.  I also crushed leftover Olive Garden croutons instead of breadcrumbs.  I toasted the pecans, and it was delicious and healthier.

This was really good!  I didn't have pecans on hand so I substituted slivered almonds - just measured out a 1/4 cup - and tossed them with Panko breadcrumbs.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

The best fish I've ever eaten or prepared... absolutely delicious!  Turned out perfectly and tasted so good.  I used panko crumbs and had leftover finely ground pecans in the freezer from Christmas baking and I lightly breaded the whole piece of fish and it just melts in your mouth.  From now on I won't prepare salmon any other way and in fact, I'm going to try this on other types of fish and maybe chicken, too.  Thank you for a superb recipe!

I wanted to cook something really nice for my boyfriend, and we hadn't had salmon in a while. Usually my own concoctions with the fish are mediocre -- but he was completely WOW'd by this recipe!! I made sure the Dijon mustard I used was really coarse, which I think added quite a bit more to the flavor. I also used Panko instead of the traditional bread crumbs. I will be making this again! It's so easy, and it tastes so good!

This recipe was OKAY... it was lacking in flavor, and took away from the salmon. Maybe if it was on a white fish and had some onion, garlic, and baked with a lemon wedge on it- then it might be a winner. Otherwise, it wasn't a favorite in our family.

This was a good recipe.  I needed to increase the cook time slightly.  Also, I left out the nuts, used dry parsley (rather than fresh), and added some red pepper flakes.  I would make this again.

Great flavors.  My only problem with this recipe is that the salmon came out a bit soggy.  I will experiment with this more (maybe cut the filets into portions and then bake so more sides are exposed and the sauce doesn't pool in the middle).  Other than that this is a very easy and delicious recipe.  I had leftover butter/breadcrumb mixture that I used for a chicken breast the next night--worked well for chicken too!

We loved this recipe! The only substitution that I made was to use gluten free bread crumbs and I seasoned the bread crumbs a little bit as gluten free breading typically is very bland. Thanks for sharing!

I seasoned the actual salmon with salt and pepper before giving it a dip in the yummy dijon sauce - this went down really well with my entire family

I think this was pretty good, but I used a white fish (Tilapia) instead of salmon.  Maybe that's why I didn't think it was bland like some of the others.

This was great and I don't really like salmon so I'm always trying to find a recipe I like. Keeping this one! However, next time I will stick it under the broiler to get the crust extra crunchy and maybe try it with pistachios. Mmmm

This was Fantastic and super easy!!! I made this last night and converted my Boyfriend to being a Salmon Lover with it! I used one very large filet with the skin still on instead of the smaller filets (allow extra cooking time for a large filet) and it served 3 people with plenty of leftovers. The Honey Dijon sauce adds a nice sweetness and the Breadcrumb Pecan mixture adds a wonderful, nutty crunch!! Simply Divine! You can also play around and amp up the spice level to suit your taste with some pepper or a spicier mustard. I will most definitely be making this again!!!!

This is absolutely the best salmon dish I have ever eatten and this is coming from someone who does not like seafood.  All the flavors went so well together from the subtle tang of the mustard to the pecans.  The fish comes out perfect, I cannot wait to have this dish again!

Very good and, maybe more importantly, very easy. I used half the butter and used slivered almonds instead of pecans because it's what I had on hand. Did everything else according to the recipe.

OMG!! I love Salmon and I usually grill it.  This was moist and the best Salmon I have ever fixed and it was done in the oven.  I did make a few changes.  I used Panco Japanese Bread Crumbs.  Makes for a crunchy crust and can be found in most supermarkets.  I had  macadamia nuts already chopped so added pecans to make the amount called for.  Absolutely delicious!! Can't wait to make this again! Thank you for the recipe!

It was really good! I do recommend you eat it right out of the oven. I let it sit for a while during the prep of some sides for christmas and the bread crumbs weren't as crispy. =) great recipe. Also, I could of done without the butter and just rubbed it with a bit of EVOO. =)

I gave this 5 stars because it is then only salmon recipe I've ever made that turned out delicious!I had to substitute some things cuz I didn't have the listed ingred on hand: agave nectar (honey), crushed stuffing mix (bread crumbs) and dry parsley (fresh). I did add crushed garlic to the sauce just cuz I like it.

I've been using this recipe for years.  It was the first recipe I saved on All Recipes.  I use it so often, especially for company, that it became a joke with my friends and family!  Everyone I've fed this recipe too has absolutely loved it.  No changes.  No substitutions.  This recipe is perfectly balanced and delicious.  My only tip is to not overcook the salmon.  I prefer my salmon medium rare, and having the inside only barely cooked makes the dish even more divine.  Thanks, Esmee!  Your recipe has made me a star!

I have made salmon many times and used many different recipes.  This by far has been my favorite.  I used Panko instead of dry bread crumbs as others suggested.  It was nice and crunchy.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans since that's all I had.  It Was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!

Made this for Valentine's Day (Meant to review it sooner! lol) It had a very good flavor. The dijon was slightly over-powering, but that can be adjusted to our personal tastes. It wasn't so over-powering that we didn't finish it!

I used salmon trout instead of salmon. It's cheaper. I used honey dijon, but also used honey. And as suggested by some reviewers, i poured all the sauce on the fish and them sprinkled the bread crumbs on top to absorb it. I thought it gave the fish more flavor rather than just brushing it on. The pecans were awesome. My only complaint is that the crust started burning a bit, i'd suggest placing a foil on top of the fish, so that it cooks, but not burn. You can remove the foil near the end so the crust can turn golden brown. I loved this recipe!

EXCELLENT! *Honey dijon salad dressing* also works well with this recipe as I discovered when I realized I didn't have any dijon mustard (I used private selection brand from safeway). I also used almonds in place of pecans. Wish I had pecans-I love them, but almonds worked really well too. loved the crunchiness of the breading. I plan on preparing my salmon this way every time. So flavorful!

This was AMAZING!!! My boyfriend and I loved it! I am not a very big mustard eater but this was so good. I used a large 1lb salmon filet and did not cut it up when cooking. Without any dijon on hand I used 2 tbsp whole grain mustard from central market and 1 tbsp honey mustard. Everything else I kept the same. I spread this on thick then sprinkled the bread crumbs over the salmon leaving out the nuts. Baked for 10 mins then broiled for additional 3 mins to get the crust crispy. Excellent! Served with long grain wild rice.

This recipe was OK I guess.  We're big salmon eaters, and honestly the fish is better without the topping.  Sounded good, but the taste was just blah.

I also have no idea why people said this recipe was bland... they must not have followed the directions.  I soaked my salmon in the sauce (made extra) and also generously covered with pecans.  My hubby loved it!  Defintely a new favorite!!!

Good, simple recipe to prepare quickly. I didn't have to buy any special ingredients, which I liked. Had everything on hand (sub'd walnuts instead of pecans, and panko instead of regular bread crumbs) The dijon wasn't overpowering, and when combined with the honey, you get a very nice flavor. I've also omitted the bread crumbs altogether before and served the salmon on ciabatta bread as a delicious sandwich, or on top of a salad. Great any way you have it.

5+ on this one.  What a pretty presentation!  The timing & the temp are perfect.  I substituted Panko, the Japanese bread crumb, for regular bread crumbs and it was superb!  Thanks for a new way to do Salmon.

We love salmon and this was different, but we liked it. No pecans, but had sesame seeds and used them instead, were good. Mine took a bit longer to cook, but had big fillets.
Update 9-2011, This first review was done in 2007 and we've made this way too many times to count since. I do now keep a bag of pecans in my freezer just for this recipe. The pecans really do give this a great flavor. I still follow the recipe exactly as written, but do pour the marinade completely over the fish and let is sit for about thirty minutes before cooking. I try to always use fresh parsley and Italian bread crumbs. I do always line my pan with foil for easy clean up. I can't believe after all these years of making this dish, I've never taken a photo of it. So I did this time and will add it later. Thank you Esmee for a really tasty dish that we've enjoyed for years now.

Excellent!  i made this for a party of 20 and it was wonderful.  i used crushed pistachios instead of pecans, and slathered on the sauce and let it rest for about an hour, then topped and baked.  it was a huge hit.  the big filets took much longer to cook but were v flaky and flavorful.

I've been using this recipe for the last few years; it's definitely a family favorite, and great on a variety of occasions. Best of all, I can make it using a total of 2 bowls and one baking dish. Easy clean up!!!!! Out of all the salmon recipes I've tried, I like this one the best because the salmon can really shine through all the other ingredients, rather than be masked by them. The breadcrumbs and pecans give it a very nice texture as well (I've also used walnuts and pistachios and they taste great too!). I sometimes like to add balsamic vinegar to the mix to give it a little extra kick, but most of the time it is great on its own. A squeeze of lemon right when it comes out of the oven can be the perfect touch. I like to make a rice pilaf or wild rice with lemon and asparagus on the side--my favorite accompaniments for this type of dish.

WOW! What else can I say?  This was over the top... very yummy, and such a delicate flavour! The dijon was not overpowering, like I had feared it would be.  I am not a salmon-lover, normally, but decided to try it to add variety to our diet.  This was definitely a good way to go!  The only change I would make would be to halve the sauce ingredients... we had way too much, but used up all the crumbs.  I also added sea salt to the crumb mixture as opposed to seasoning afterwards.  Thanks so much for a terrific recipe, Arnie!

This is our favorite recipe for salmon.  Even the kids love it.  I usually use less butter because the sauce spreads on too thin if I use the full amount.

Very nice salmon recipe that would be good for an everyday or company meal. A good change from a fish that can get dull quickly. Very easy to make. The sauce is more than needed, you'll have leftovers. No salt and pepper needed if you use seasoned breadcrumbs. Taking the feedback from others, I went light on the breadcrumbs, heavy on the pecans, and topped the fish only for the last 6 minutes. Worked out perfectly.

I really liked this recipe and will definately try again.  I love salmon and I am always looking a new and different ways to cook.  The only thing I did find was salmon was slightly dry.  Next time I might try to cover with foil for the first 10 minutes and then baste in some of the juices.

This recipe has potential, but I was dissapointed with how it turned out.  The top turned out soggy and yet dry at the same time, but the overall flavor was good.  I think some of the butter in the sauce should be reserved and drizzled on top of the salmon before baking to crunch it up, which is what I'll try next time.  If that doesn't fix the problem then I won't be making this again.  UPDATE: I tried drizzling the melted butter on top and it still didn't fix it.  Too bad, since the flavors are good, but I can't get past the texture.  Goodbye Baked Dijon Salmon.

Delicious!  We ended up having to cook it far longer than the recommended 12-15 min though.  More like 35 min.  I think this recipe would work great with chicken breasts too.

This was okay.  Not bad, not great and I followed the recipe exactly.  I felt like dipping a chicken tender in the sauce, not salmon.  Didn't taste badly, it just wasn't the right fit for me.

i have made this several times and it is wonderful. my husband & son went lake fishing last summer and caught 80 lbs. of salmon.  my sister-in-law suggested i try this recipe so i did.  i didn't change a thing.  it's just like eating a special dinner at a very expensive restaurant.  the blend of tastes is excellent.

One of the best recipes I have ever gotten off this website.  It is easy and delicious!  I use whatever nuts I happen to have on hand, not always pecans.  I really like it with almonds especially. (Although I wouldn't suggest using peanuts ever).

This is a great recipe!!!!!  This is my first time cooking and eating fresh salmon and I can't believe how well this turned out.  I read the reviews and was a bit worried that I had chosen the wrong recipe to serve to my mum and brother, but it was a huge success.  Even my brother liked it and he won't eat anything that looks funny.  There is nothing you could do to make this better.  I didn't find the breadcrumbs became soggy and the dijon mustard (I used a brand that we have here in Australia, Keen's) was just great.  My parents are usually of the opinion that seafood of any kind is too expensive unless it's Christmas lunch, certainly too expensive for normal dinner with the family, but my mum said that this recipe made the cost of the salmon well worth it.  Also very filling.  Everyone who likes fish should try it.

I have made this twice now...the first time I follow the recipe as is and it was good...but I wanted it more spicy.  So, the next time, I added some red crushed pepper to the honey/mustard mixture and sprinkled some on top of the salmon before baking. My husband and I really liked it.

Absolutely delicious!  After the first time, I now omit the butter and make sure that the pecans are under the bread crumbs so that they don't burn.  My entire family loves this and we eat it at least 2-3 times/month.  Well, my 12 year old son doesn't LOVE it but at least he'll eat fish this way!
Thanks for a delicious way to prepare healthy salmon.

My husband adores salmon.  We have it quite frequently and always look for new recipes.  This was abosolutely scrumptious prepared exactly as written.  Although there are just the 2 of us, I prepared it for 4.  The following day, after work, I just gently reheated on low in the microwave and it was great and even more tasty.  We had it last Sunday and will be having it again today.  This recipe is a definite keeper!

This is definitely my new favorite salmon recipe. I am not a big fan of dijon mustard so I was a little worried that the mustard flavor would be overpowering but it is not. The honey and pecans complemented the richness of the salmon superbly. I will definitely be making this one again!!

This was very f-a-s-t and easy.  All the ingredients made for a tasty meal.  I served this with rice pilaf, greek salad, and a loaf of bread.  The more bread crumb mixture you spread on top, the longer it will take to cook (max 22 minutes).

I do think this was good, although next time I 
make it I'll add a little more honey and a little
less dijon. Also, the topping would have been 
even more tasty if I had sauteed the bread crumbs
and pecans in some melted butter first, creating a
"wet sand" texture before sprinkling it atop the
salmon.

We try to eat alot of salmon for the nutritional value but we're not real crazy about the strong "fishy" taste so I'm always on the lookout for a recipe that softens it some.  This one is great and I will be preparing it often. The pecans add great taste and texture. Such an easy recipe and all the ingredients are right at hand.  It's a keeper!

Fabulous! We live in the Pacific Northwest so we eat A LOT of salmon, consequently my family doesn't get too excited when they learn I have a filet thawing. I have tried many recipes and this one is by far the new front runner.  It was easy, delicious,moist and the breadcrumb mixture was a great topping. I did have to bake it a bit longer as this was half of an eighteen pound fish we caught last summer. Highly recommend!  Enjoy.

This recipes was absolutely excellent. I like fish and normally I think salmon is just okay. But the ingredients in this recipes really made all the right flavors pop out. I much enjoyed the honey/Dijon mixture. The fish was cooked just right. DELICIOUS! I would definitely make this again. Thanks Arnie.

I didn't really like this, the mustard was too strong or something.  Although it did taste better the next day, I probably won't make again.

To give you an idea of how good it turned out, after I made it on a Thursday, ond of my friends (who happens to be Peruvian) who I cooked for "borrowed" the recipe and made it for a party of 15.  The party-goers were talking for days about this delicious "Peruvian" salmon dish that they had tried!!  Funny stuff!  

In any case, incredible flavor and was easy if you have the right ingredients.  I added a bit of dill to the mixture... turned out fantastic!  Not spicy, and definitely a friendly flavor for those who are iffy about fishy.  I would recommend you eat this dish at least once a month!

Great on fresh salmon but oustanding on Alaskan halibut.  Makes enough sauce for at least another meal.  Butter, honey, mustard mixture freezes well

Moist and flavorful.  Great for company, they'll think you spent hours

I did not read the reviews before trying this.  I didn't have fresh parsley and only used three salmon steaks.  I poured and brushed the butter mixture over the salmon and then added the bread crumb mixture.  I made these steaks for lunches over the next few weeks.  When I ate it at lunch the next day, I am glad I didn't try them the night before or I would have eaten all three.  I will make this over and over again, thank you.

I have made this recipe twice already. It is definitely a keeper. If people find this too bland, just season it with Salt/Pepper or whatever season you want, before and after you dip in the dijon marinate.

I absolutely agree with MIZFROG. This is a delicious recipe and you 'must' use the honey with the mustard.  To make a post when you don't follow the directions is unfair.  The honey + mustard is what makes the recipe so delicious. I have made this recipe many times and had people taste it who don't really care too much for fish and Loved it.  When you follow the directions, you can not lose with this 'too easy to make' recipe.

My family loves this.  The only thing I do differently is something I learned from a chef.  Don't preheat the oven.  Put the salmon in a cold oven, turn it on to 400 and cook 25 minutes.  Perfect every time.

We followed the recipe as instructed.  The baking time is perfect and we all even like the topping on the fish.  The issue was with the honey mustard mixture.  It would be great for other meats, but it overwhelms the salmon flavor with sweetness, & makes for an odd combination.  If you eat salmon regularly, you know that salmon is a hard flavor to cover up.

Absolutely delicious, even with all the substitutions I made. Didn't have Dijon mustard, used Spicy Brown instead. Didn't have pecans, so I left them out. Didn't have fresh parsley, used dried instead. The sweet, tangy bread topping compliments a rich, buttery fish very nicely. I served with lemon basmati rice (recipe also found on this site), and steamed broccoli in salted butter. We'll definitely be making this again.

I love salmon, but I knew it would take some coaxing to get my girlfriend to eat fish. She loved it and is now more willing to try seafood. Double win. I like to turn up the heat on the broiler for a few minutes at the end to get a slightly crunchier topping.

Salmon came out great, lots of flavor from the honey dijon, but not overpowering. I put on just a little too much breadcrumbs but that did not take away from this delicious recipe.

Made this tonight and was really impressed!   Followed the recipe exactly and  could not have been more satisfied.  My son orders salmon every time he goes to a restaurant and he  rated this dish a 10/10,!  So very easy to put together and it made a beautiful presentation.

Pretty tasty and relatively easy to make.  We used Panko breadcrumbs for a nice crunch. I would be curious to try this again with spicy brown mustard instead of the dijon.
Update! Just made this with the spicy brown mustard and it was amazing! I will be doing this in the future!

This recipe was delicious and it makes for a beautiful presentation on the plate too!  I did make two minor change to the recipe by replacing the honey with pure maple syrup since I realized when I went to make it that I was out of the honey and I used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain.  I love the sweet taste with just a touch of tang from the mustard.  The crunch of the pecan topping just completes this dish perfectly.  I cannot believe one person said it was bland.  It was anything but bland.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is very delicious just as it is written. If you don't have pecans, we have used walnuts and hazelnuts and they are delicious as well. We use sockeye salmon and it is beautiful. Nice for company.

Pretty good recipe. Wanted to try something different for a couple salmon fillets we had other than my normal light seasonings and searing. Was a nice change of pace. I substituted cashews for the pecans because I had those. I added a touch more honey and also used about a teaspoon of fresh chopped dill instead of parsley along with a pinch of dried herbs de provence with a couple squeezes of fresh lemon to the honey/mustard/butter mixture and it turned out quite nice.

Fantastic! My non-foodie boyfriend rarely gets excited over any dish. And he just ate a whole pound raving all the while! He says this tastes like it's from our favourite, very expensive seafood restaurant.

I followed your instructions and Oh My lord.  Love it.  I never used to cook and I'm 43.  I been getting recipes off of this site for about 2 months now and my 12 year old daughter doesn't want my wife to cook anymore.  I'm the hero now thanks.

I have made this recipe several times, and no matter what kind of tweaking I do, it's still fabulous. I have 4 kids -- a 7-yr-old boy and 16-yr-old triplets (a boy and 2 girls). All but my 16 yr old son have declared themselves salmon haters. (But we live outside of New Orleans, so of course they all like crawfish!) Anyway, this recipe toned their pipes down. I bought a 1.7 lb salmon fillet at Fresh Market, and I had to fight to keep a couple of scraps for my husband. I didn't have pecans -- though I have used them with this recipe in the past and they're great -- and I used plain panko instead of the breadcrumbs. I added a touch of soy sauce and a bit of brown sugar, put the broiler on for the last 2-3 minutes and the salmon caramelized beautifully. I served with rice and a store-bought Asian salad. Fantastic, easy meal. Thank you, Esmee!

A really nice change from my usual teriyaki glaze.  Followed directions exactly except used panko bread crumbs for a little crunchier topping. Excellent flavor!

Would make this again for sure! It had a really nice little crunch to it. I followed the recipe except that I didn't have fresh parsley so I just used more dried parsley. It was really tasty.

Yum, yum! This was one of the best salmon recipes I've tried. Hubby liked it enough to ask what the marinade was. It was soft and moist. Just scrumptious.Goes on my regular rotation.

This was really good.  Whoever said it wasn't spicy and was bland, I have to disagree.  I think this would convert anyone who doesn't like salmon.  However, you need to watch what you serve with it.  the flavor was more subtle after I started eating my salad with italian dressing.  I think a nice basmati rice with simple seasoning would be nice with this and maybe a green veggie lightly seasoned, like broccoli.

The only sub I made was to use Panko and I highly recommend that

this recipe is a keeper! similar to another i have tried, but i liked how this one added bread crumbs to top the fliets. the pecans were also a nice touch! i had to add a tad bit more honey to my mixture because the mustard was really overpoweing it. but overall, this was pretty quick, simple and very delicious.

Outstanding recipe! Used this with Tilapia instead of Salmon and it was wonderful. Got rave reviews from two very discerning fish eaters. Cooked for 13 minutes. Perfectly done and flaky. 

CHANGES: Substituted olive oil for butter; used 1 tsbp of dried parsley as I didn't have fresh.

Thank you!

Loved this recipe!  Easy to make and it is a quick recipe!  I will make this again and again.  If you don't have fresh parsley, dried worked just fine.  I'd only do 2 tsp. if it's dried vs. 4.

Excellent recipe!  I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only changes being that I used some panco bread crumbs along with regular breadcrumbs and I didn't have fresh parsley so I used parsley flakes.  The 2nd time, I only used 2 tablespoons Dijon and my husband ranked this as one of the best things I've ever made!  I reduced the mustard to 2 tablespoons (as a personal preference as mustard has never been a favorite of mine).  Quick, easy, delicious and healthy -- all of the things I look for in a weekday meal!  Don't shy away from this one!

This is very good. I used an extra tbsp of honey and panko bread crumbs. I used cracked black pepper and sea salt, which definitely makes a difference.

BEST baked salmon I've ever tasted.  I'm not usually much of a fan of baked salmon, but wind up having it once a month or so and dreading the leftovers.  Not with this recipe!  It took away the super "fishy" taste and replaced it with wonderful flavor.  I did make a few changes - mostly because I didn't have any honey or pecans.  I simply left the pecans out and don't think I will use them next time, either; they just don't appeal to me in a salmon recipe.  For the honey, I substituted honey dijon mustard and a spoonful of brown sugar.  It worked very well.  I also only cooked two large portions of fish, but kept the sauce amount constant, except that I actually used even more butter than the full recipe calls for.  Instead of just slathering it on right before cooking, I let my salmon sit in the sauce about half an hour - I don't know that it really made any difference, but it also didn't hurt.  And, as mentioned above, I used more the twice what was called for.  I also breaded both sides of my salmon (skin removed) quite heavily.  It was delicious!!!

Wow, this was awesome! I agree with other reviewers, if you don't use all the ingredients, don't rate the recipe and give it 4 stars cuz you didn't have it all. Not fair. I added a bit of fried onions and some grated parmesan...Yum!

This recipe is amazing! It took me a total of 20 minutes from fridge to table, and my husband and I couldn't be more impressed with the taste! Rather than lightly brushing the salmon, I brushed both sides and then poured the remaining sauce into the bottom of the baking pan. The result was awesome - tender, flaky salmon that still tasted like salmon with a little ooomph added! I didn't think the sauce was overpowering at all, and was happy to find a recipe that was different than the plain ole' boring salmon I've grown used to.

I made this exactly as written and I must say, it is soooooo good!  I also made the Pecan Rice and Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce from this site to go with the salmon.  A dinner that was much better than many I've had at some of the finest restaurants...at a fraction of the cost!  Thank you Esmee!

I have to agree with the person who said this is the worst way I have every prepared salmon. I followed the recipe exactly. Bland. I also ruined my salmot fillets and wasted my other ingredients. Yuck.

My husband and I made this for our Superbowl Sunday family dinner and it was great.  Even our four year old and eight year old loved it.  We served it with rice and salad.  We omitted the pecans because of our sons allergies but it was still delicious.

It was good... It definitely has the potential to be very, very excellent. However, I found it was a little too bland and the fish/salmon taste overpowered the dijon. I added a little pepper to the sauce, and used dried parsley, half bread crumbs half crumbled Breton crackers, and a little garlic powder in the crumbs, so maybe I messed it up! I also omitted the pecans so that might be the issue. I think next time I will try marinating the fish with the sauce in the refrigerator for 10 minutes on each side. On the other hand, my boyfriend really enjoyed it as is but he is a bigger salmon lover than me. =)

Num!!!  This is so quick and easy!  I was home alone, so I did less butter but kept the mustard and honey the same for a nice thick sauce.  I dunked the salmon in and then thought, what the heck and just poured the entire mixture into a baking dish.  I then sprinkled on the breadcrumb mixture (which I added some salt and pepper to) and tossed in some asparagus right in with it all.  Baked for 15 minutes and wa-la!  A quick and easy meal for a single gal at home!  So tasty!  I'll cannot wait to impress some guests with this meal!

This recipe was a huge success! I served the delicious moist salmon with haricot vert and rice. It looked and tasted like it was plated in a restaurant. Excellent. I did not use the pecans because there were none on hand but that would be nice to try next time. We have a tough crowd here and all agreed on the 5 stars.

This is so delicious, even my 3-year-old asks for a second helping. I made it with gluten-free rice bread crumbs and dairy/soy free margarine to comply with family allergy requirements.

this is fantastic.  I substituted pine nuts once  and walnuts another time and it was fab.  I also use frozen parsley that comes chopped in the freezer case and also garlic that comes this way as shortcuts and it mixes with the break crumbs well and tastes great.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. This was absolutely amazing, and I am not usually a huge fan of salmon. I didn't use the butter but I added a little bit of olive oil after the mustard/honey mix and sprayed the top of the crumbs with a little olive oil spray. It was absolutely delicious!!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because my picky husband groaned when he saw I made salmon - but then went on to say it was the best salmon he's ever had and asked if we had more!  I enjoyed it very much as well and very easy to make!

From someone who isn't the biggest fan of salmon, this recipe has me sold!  I've also used Honey Dijon mustard as well, adds a little bit more sweetness.  Also I use fresh bread crumbs since they are so easy to make -- YUM!

A nice change for salmon.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  Thought I had pecans but didn't, so used walnuts instead and it still came out delicious.  I had to bake longer, more like 20 minutes.  I really enjoyed this.

This was just okay.  I love Salmon and had some nice Wild Sockeye Salmon.  This dish though was a little bland to me.  I think it would better with lemon and garlic in with the mustard mixture.  I might try again with these changes.

Wow! So easy and so tasty! I am in China at the moment, where it is tough to get some ingredients, so substituted pounded multi-grain Cheerios (!) for breadcrumbs, omitted the pecans and baked one fillet in the toaster oven. Coarse-grain Dijon. Amazing and easy! I guess anisette had a bad day 'cuz this was full of flavour!

I had tried salmon before and didn't quite like it. I decided to try this recipe. It was my first time working with salmon and I have to say WOW it was unbelievably good!! I loved it. I followed the instructions just as they are with just one adjustment. I put the salt and pepper before putting the mustard mix. Also I baked each fillet in its own foil pocket. It was amazing! I'm definitely making this again!!! Its a must try recipe for everyone even if you haven't tried salmon before or if you've had a bad experience. It will amaze you.

This was soooo good and very easy.  I'm not a big fan of salmon, but I love this recipe.  I followed the recipe with these exceptions out of necessity:  used honey money dressing instead of combining honey and mustard, my bread crumbs were panko so they were very crispy, and my fresh parsley was dehydrated Italian parsley.  Very good recipe.  I would proudly serve this to guests.

Amazing meal, made it for my family and they loved it, and even asked me to make it for the next big family get-together. Note, this recipe makes a lot more of the dry mix than is needed, so that can be scaled back by almost half the amount.

I would definitely make this again, only cut down on the sweetness a bit. So much honey is good when using some extra zesty mustard, otherwise to my taste the sweetness was a little too overwhelming, mb because of the ingredients I used. The crust was delicious.

This was awesome! I didn't have any pecans but I didn't really notice! I think I will try with panko bread crumbs next time to make a crunchier topping! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is good...sweet but good! I actually used this for chicken and it worked well! I baked the chicken at 350 for about 30 minutes.

I made it, the family raved, no leftovers! It was a little sweet for MY taste, next time a bit less honey and a bit more Dijon. Easy and fast! Served it with bean and corn salad and polenta, great meal!

This is a DELICIOUS recipe!  The pecans are a hit on the salmon, and the yummy honey-mustard flavor is awesome.  My husband thinks it's good, but I think it's spectacular! :)  My only change is to turn and coat the salmon in the honey mustard mix, then dip and coat it in the bread mixture.  It's a little messy, but this will ensure a good flavoring of the salmon instead of just sprinkling crumbs on top and it either be too dry or plain.  I would also recommend NOT using thick salmon steaks ... you can taste the flavors blending better with a thinner fish.  Thanks!

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but for me it just didn't work out. Fish was dry and flavor wasn't spectacular. Maybe it's just the cooking time/temperature didn't work with my pieces of salmon. Husband liked it!

Great Recipe! Added brocolli, asparagus, and sauteed onions to the baking pan to make it a full meal (poured cup of white wine, little olive oil and extra dijon mustard to pan to make sauce to cook the veggies in).  Easy, delicious one pan meal!

The only change I made was to use dried Italian seasoning instead of fresh parsley to make prep quicker. I like many of these ingredients, and was surprised that the dish didn't please my palate. The topping didn't get crispy (maybe need to broil?) and I found the butter/honey/Dijon mixture seemed to overpower the salmon. My BF liked it alot, so I'm giving it a 4 (it's a 3 for me though). Served this with "Mock Risotto" and "Sauteed Fiddleheads".

i have a picky eater in the home(aged 3 at the time) and he likes honey mustard dipping sauce and SOMETIMES he'll eat fish.  I found this recipe and thought we could combine them and see if he likes it; he did and I love it! Sounded a little weird to me, but I tasted it and it was delicious.  I think this is the only way I'll make salmon anymore!

Good recipe, very helpful. I didn't make it exactly the same, I omitted the breadcrumbs and pecans.   I based what I did off several recipes from this site, and this one is the closest to what I did.   I made foil packets for the salmon... for the marinade I used a little white wine, freshly squeezed lemon juice, honey dijon mustard, honey sauce from KFC (lol, it's all I had!) and fresh ground mccormick lemon pepper seasoning. I added a slice of lemon on top and baked the foil packets. It came out very moist, flakey, and flavorful. It didn't taste fishy or "mustardy" at all, I don't like the fishy taste and this was good.

Awesome! I love fish so I'm pretty sure any recipe would have tasted good to me.  I made it as written except that I didn't have fresh spices so I used dried, and I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts.  I think it turned out great, and it really didn't take long to prepare at all!  The only thing was that I kind of felt I could taste all the ingredients individually instead of sauces and topping - maybe I needed to mix things together a bit better.  Still, delicious!

So easy to make and it tastes great!  I just buy frozen salmon fillets and add the ingredients onto them frozen.  I then follow the baking time on the salmon fillet wrappers.  They turn out perfect every time!

We loved this recipe!  My husband doesn't care for salmon, so he'll only eat it if the "fishiness" is covered up.  He really enjoyed this one!   We're living in France, so I couldn't find bread crumbs.  I substituted cracker crumbs instead.  Also, I had no pecans and substituted pistachios.

I thought this was pretty good-the honey-mustard sauce was nice and moist and the bread crumbs added their own flavor. I used regular mustard because I didn't have Dijon, and I left out the pecans because I didn't have any-I'm sure they would have added to the flavor, but it was good without. The only weird thing was that instead of cooking through in 20 or so minutes, the fish was still kind of mushy and the bread crumbs on top weren't crispy. But it could be my oven :P

Update: 2nd attempt was better (I think)-I used Dijon mustard and my husband found an old bag of pecans and I think they really added to the flavor. This time we cooked for 12 minutes and the salmon was almost overdone :P And there were still extra crumbs on top. Tasty, though!

If you are a salmon "purist" you won't care for this recipe. It's "sweetened salmon". Even in 100+ degrees outside, I should have just grilled my expensive salmon. I will look more carefully at the ingredients next time. The breading didn't great crispy as I thought it would, either.

This recipe is fantastic!  We use it when we have dinner guests.  It always turns out perfect and gets rave reviews from everyone!  To others: don't change a thing in the recipe and try marinating the salmon for a few hours in the honey dijon mixture.  Yum!  BTW: The same recipe (but for 6 fillets) is on this site as "Alaska Salmon Bake with Pecan Crunch Coating" but we find both recipes turn out just as good with Atlantic salmon, which we prefer.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever made. My in-laws absolutely loved it.I might have added more of the sauce while cooking. This was the first time I have ever cooked salmon and it was a complete success! I could go on and on and my mouth is watering right now

After all the rave reviews I made this Salmon dish tonight and it was a good enough hit.  I just wish it had a bit more tang.  Next time, I'm adding Mayo to the mustard/ honey and butter mixture.

I made this last week for my boyfriend, and he said it was the best thing I've ever cooked!  We easily finished off 1.5 pounds of salmon fillets!  I made this exactly like the recipe says, only my fillets were pretty thick so I had to cook it longer.  Served it with rice pilaf and green beans.  This will be in my regular rotation of recipes now.  Delicious!!!

I absolutely love this recipe. I doubled both the Dijon mustard and the honey and it turned out even better.

I agree with many other reviewers that this is a lovely way to serve salmon and almost failproof if the recipe is followed as written.   Have been making this for many years with never a complaint from family or guests.  Highly recommended.

I am amazed that this simple recipe made the most delicious salmon I have ever had. It tasted better than some restaurant salmon I've sampled. I followed the recipe to the letter except I had no pecans and no parsley. I also used panko. My fillets were very thick so I had to cook for a little longer..about 18-20 minutes total. The Dijon sauce was so good I felt like I could just drink it. It gave the fish this delicate sweetish,tangy-ish flavour but did not overpower that great salmon taste. Definitely my go-to fish recipe from now on.

I thought there was nothing new that could be done to salmon that I hadn't eaten, but this was truly scrumptious!    The salmon came out perfectly cooked, not cloyingly sweet like honey-mustard things tend to and not overly mustardy, either. Perfect balance of flavors!  I made this yesterday for family visiting from out of town as an impromptu lunch during Passover.  Obviously, I made at least one substitution - I traded out the bread crumbs for matzoh that I processed along with the pecans.  I did toast the pecans a little bit, also.  The other oh-so-slight modification I made was to add about a tablespoon of chopped garlic to the matzoh/pecan/parsley mix.   I got raves from my guests who were oh-so-impressed with my extraordinary cooking abilities! lol Of course, I told them that it wasn't that I'm a good cook, it's that I found an awesome recipe!

This recipe is amazing. I almost didn't make it after reading a bad review, but I am so glad I did. I never review these things but I had to put in my advice to just try this. It is so good! I used crushed walnuts instead of pecans as I only had those on hand and it was great.

Loved this recipe!  A nice change of pace from marinated salmon.  I did reduce the Dijon based on other reviews, but otherwise made as written. A definite keeper. Thank you Esmee for the delicious recipe.

This was really good, but I did doctor the recipe for more flavor, as it sounded a bit bland.  I added pepper, garlic powder and Herbes de Provence to the bread crumb mixture.  My husband adored it, and went back for large seconds.  This is a keeper.

I skipped the bread crumbs and just used ground pecans for the crumb mixture like others have suggested. I also didn't have any dijon mustard so I used coarse ground mustard instead.  This was exceptionally good! It was loved by my husband and my 3 children aged 11,5, and 2. AND I do not care for much seafood and I loved it too!  This is an awesome way to get fish into our diet. FYI - I have fixed this several times and always have to cook it longer than recommended.

This was a quick and yummy way to do salmon. My husband really loved it and even my 16 month old son ate it up. Some people said it lacked in taste but I thought it was fine. You don't want the ingredients to over power the fish, just enhance the flavour. I do suggest to broil the fish the last 5 minutes if you want the topping sightly crispy.

The bread crumbs didn't mix very well with the pecans and parsley but once sprinkled on the fish, the topping was very tasty.

This recipe wasn't bad. My hubby wouldn't even try it. My daughter didn't eat any either. I was the only one to eat the fish. I thought it was better than recipes that call for the fish to be baked with lemon juice.  If I made it again, I'd try marinating it in the honey mixture. The pecans were a nice addition. I didn't notice the taste of the parsley. I didn't think salt and pepper were necessary, so I didn't use either one. I would attempt this recipe again.

This was tasty and incredibly easy to prepare!  I only had sliced almonds so I used that instead of pecans and it was still good.  I also only had dried parsley and that seemed fine.  If you use aluminum foil to bake, it's an even easier cleanup!

My family is not big on fish, but I'm trying to go healthy and serve more.  This dish was a good start.  It was not "fishy" tasting at all, and it was very tender.  I accidentally used honey mustard instead of dijon mustard, so it was pretty sweet, but I think the kids liked that about it.  I would make this recipe again.

This is really great. I followed the recipe exactly. The only suggestion I would make is to marinate the salmon in the dijon mixture for a couple of hours prior to baking. The soak up way more of the flavor this way.

YUM! As I am sitting here savoring this delicious dish, I thought I ought to review it. The honey mustard sauce is fantastic with the salmon, especially with the nutty topping. I didn't have any pecans, so I substituted walnuts. Also I didn't brush the fillets with the sauce, I just poured it all into the baking dish with the salmon, then sprinkled the nut mixture on top. MMMMMmmmmmm, it's sooo good!

My brother made this for me at Christmas and it was the best fish I'd ever had....but when I made it there wasn't the same exploding flavour and the topping wasn't as moist and the crumbliness made me want to scrape it off. Next time I might actually mix the topping with the sauce. Lemon brought out taste in my version, but wasn't necessary with my brother's. 

As another reviewer said, there's loads of sauce which burnt in the bottom of my pan when I dumped it on. I used some extra on rice and it was great.

I'd make this again, but my review for my version is 3 stars and 5 for my brother's, so a 4 all around.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It is quite rich which I had anticipated so only served one side dish of rice cooked in Knorr Vegetable soup.  Used one cup of rice, two cups of water and 1 package Knorr (dry) Vegetable soup mix.

To be a keeper in my house a recipe has to be able to deal with substitutions.  Even with crushed rice krispies instead of bread crumbs, walnuts instead of pecans, and spicy brown instead of dijon this recipe was good.  The extra sauce worked on green beans but my husband preferred pouring more on the fish for added flavor.

I have made this over and over and always, always a winner. Important to try and get salmon with the skin already removed.
I have shared this recipe with others and it's a hit.

So good. Do not be afraid to hit those salmon lovingly with the honey dijon sauce, and don't be afraid to leave those pecans a bit chunky -- the texture works great.

I don't often give recipes 5 stars, but this one deserves it. It is so quick and easy to prepare and absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to omit the butter from the honey mustard mixture because I'm watching my saturated fat intake. The good news is you save a lot of fat that way and it is still awesome! I will definitely add this to my recipe collection.

I loved this and so did my boyfriend. I used fried onions (the kind you buy in a can) instead of pecans and it still turned out great. Very tasty.

This recipe is horrible.  I followed step by step instructions and it's a waste of my salmon! It tasted so mustardy. When I made the sauce to taste, it was perfectly tasty.  It almost tasted like honey mustard. Which I love honey mustard.  My boyfriend and family thought it was good.  But I felt they were just being nice. Otherwise, don't waste your salmon to this recipe.  I'm never making this one again...

Outstanding, I kind of cheated a little, as I did not use Salmon, but instead used wild caught Pacific Red Snapper. Then I marinated the fish in Kikoman's Honey Mustard marinade for two hours. From then on the basic recipe was followed. Coupled with Asparagus spears ( here I cheated even more as I used canned, and heated in the microwave), and as suggested, a glass of GOOD Chardoney. Definately a keeper and goes on the "A" list

I really liked this recipe and my mother-in-law thought it was delicious.  My husband thought it was just okay, but he is not into sweet things or salmon.  Very easy and would make again.

This recipe is to die for!  The top is crispy while the fish is moist.  The end product looks like something that would be served in a fine restaurant.  If you enjoy salmon, strongly recommend you try this recipe!

This came out far too mustardy. It might be better with a little more honey and a little less mustard.

This was absolutely delicious. Balance the sweetness of the salmon with something less seasoned. New potatoes, broccoli would be good with this. I had some leftover spinach in phyllo that I served along side, and it balanced nicely. I'm going to try this recipe on the grill next. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, truly delicious.

This recipe made a lovely dish for my parents' 25th anniversary.  I didn't use pecans because most of my family does not like nuts, but other than that no changes.  The salmon was very moist and everyone raved about it.

This was pretty good.  The topping did not overpower the fish.  I used Japanese Panko instead of bread crumbs and it worked fine.  Served with steamed asparagus and a blend of wild rice and brown rice.  It was a super dinner, and healthy as well.

this recipe name should be changed to 1000 people's favorite dijon salmon!!  
i made it last night for a date and it went amazing.  i used panko bread crumbs and even added a little cayenne pepper to the dijon mix as we like things spicy.  after the 13 min baking i put the salmon under the broiler for a little less than a minute to brown the topping.  i'll definitely be making this recipe again!!

This was very good, but the flavor didn't quite blend with the salmon.  Next time I might use snapper or mahi, even chicken.  Overall a good recipe though.

Incredible! I made it for one of my best friends along with the 'Asparagus Parmesean' recipe and salad. She said it was the best meal she's tasted in a year! My boyfriend ate the leftovers the next day, and was amazed by the taste (even though it had sat in the fridge all night.) I will definately be making this dish again, as well as passing it onto my friends and family!

Finally something me and my husband can both agree on! I like unique, he digs bland and boring. This recipe had just the right amount of flavor to please us both. After reading the reviews about the fish being a bit soggy I decided to add the breadcrumbs the last 5-10 min. of cooking and it turned out great! I highly recommend this recipe.

Tastes fantastic.  Very easy and quick to make.  I left out the bread crumbs (didn't have any and no time to make them).  Using just pecans with parsley was still wonderful.  I'll make this for guests next time.

Great recipe.  Next time I will use less or no bread crumbs, and just use the pecans.  The bread crumbs seemed to make it a little soggy and messed with the honey dijon flavor.

My family loves this salmon dinner.  I made it for my extended family for mother's day last year, and it was requested for Christmas Eve dinner, too.  So flavorful, and easy to make.  Make the coating ahead of time, and the honey mixture, too, and prep time before baking will be a breeze.  Even my sister in law, who dislikes fish, loved the salmon!  Great combined with the garlic red potoatoes found on this site.

This recipe is just what I was looking for.  It is delicious.  I did change it a little just because I didn't have the exact ingredients.  I used 1 1/2 TBLS dijon mustard, 2 TBLS mesquite smoked BBQ sauce, 1 tsp. brown sugar and a TBSP melted margarine.  I marinated my salmon filets in this mixture for about 2 hours.  I mixed fine plain bread crumbs with pecan meal (pecans ground to a very fine consistency), salt and pepper and dredged the non-skin side of the filet in the crumb mixture and baked uncovered at 400 for about 15 minutes.  My filets were thin.  The topping is crunchy and so tasty.  The salmon is still really moist inside, but not mushy.  I will definitely make this again and try it with the honey, when I have some in the pantry. I'll be sharing this recipe with others.  Some have mentioned that it was very fishy, but if your salmon is fresh, it's not fishy tasting or fishy smelling.

This is an easy and flavorful recipe. I found no need for the butter (salmon is moist and oily enough as it is), and I simply used a very good brand of honey-dijon mustard (instead of mixing the two). It's great!

My family doesn't like fish as a rule, but they're a healthy protein source so I'm trying to find fish recipes that we enjoy.

This was a complete success!  My husband said to put this on the "keeper" list and my daughter thoroughly enjoyed it, too.

I was worried that the fish wouldn't be done, or that it would be too dry, or that the pan would get all "soupy"... it was so simple, and came out perfectly.

It's almost embarrassing that such an elegant dish is so easy to put together.

My husband says "four star resaurant!" It's great. Next time, will take suggestion to de-glaze pan with white wine for more sauce, it looked like it would've been great but I had no wine on hand (a mortal sin in some kitchens, I know...)

I first tried this recipe over two years ago... I loved it then and still do!  My husband and I always make salmon this way.  Even my picky teenage brother likes it!  We make it on the grill on a piece of foil for easy cleanup (and no stinky house).  It's delicious!

This was the best fish I've ever had. My kids loved it! Even my very picky 11 year old. My husband took some to work the next day & he said it tasted great again. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I did marinate it for 3 hours. Yum!!

I was looking for cooking time and temps for salmon and found this perfect for what I was after. Great basic recipe that can be altered with any sauce. I used El Torito Cilantro dressing in place of mustard as my family does not like it. A lot of possiblities. thanks!

Absolutely awesome! Super quick and easy--tastes fabulous!! I left out the parsley-didn't have any (not sure what it does to taste anyways...). This is a keeper--sweet potato and veggies are good sides. Nummy!!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!  I'm not a fish lover, but I saw this recipe and decided to make it for my family and they loved it to.  Besides being very easy to make, it was very tasty and pretty much melted in your mouth.  I did not add the pecans as I don't really like them.  I also lined the baking pan with butter to create a gravy for the salmon.  When it was finished baking, I took the drippings and added another half a lemon to it to give it a tangy taste and it turned out great as well!  I loved this recipe, I would definitely make it again.

I used this on some frozen salmon filets. It was great. I think this recipe works well on fish that is not fresh or is not too good to begin with, because the coating has a lot of flavors of it's own to mask any less than perfect cut of fish. Another tip: the dijon I used already had sugar in it so it came out too sweet. Next time I will add less honey or use a different mustard.

This is the best fish recipe ever! We've been eating fish more at my house but salmon has been my least favorite so I've been trying to find more good recipes - but made this way, this is one of the best dishes I've ever had.

This is a great baked salmon recipe.  It turns out great as long as I use good wild salmon.  I doubled the sauce and let in marinate in the fridge for a few hours.  It has a lot more flavor that way.

this recipe was fantastic - very tasty.  i took the advice of some of the other members and put foil in the baking pan, added a bit more honey to the marinade, marinated the salmon for about 30 minutes beforehand, and made some extra marinade which i heated up as a sauce. i didn't have parsely or pecans so i just used breadcrumbs and parmesan - the parmesan gave it a nice taste.

This is a great recipe.  Fast, and good enough to serve to any company!!   I used homemade frozen bread crumbs and they turned out very crunchy and yummy on top of the salmon.  I also omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy in my family and we didn't miss them at all.  I will share this with all my friends!

Absolutely excellent.  My husband requests this recipe for salmon often, and although we eliminate the nuts and the bread crumbs if we don't have them - it is still wonderful!  We also use the dressing for chicken breasts.

I enjoyed this but found the sweetness overpowering. Next time, I will cut the butter and honey and go heavier on the mustard. I also found it necessary to add 4 minutes to the cooktime for some thicker fillets. Served it with steamed white rice and roasted broccoli. Very nice, flavorful dinner.

One of the best salmon recipes!!! I already tried several variations. First, I substituted butter with olive oil. Then, I substituted pecans with grated Parmesan cheese. Finally, we combined regular Dijon and honey with honey Dijon mustard... Turns out great every time!
I also tried sprinkling the fish (before covering it up with the oil/mustard mixture and bread crumbs) with the mix of 2 parts lemon juice and 1 part tequila.

My family loves this recipe. I modified the recipe a bit and used maple syrup instead of honey. I also put on a lot more of the marinade then the recipe calls for. We loved the taste of  savory/sweet combo of the mustard and honey(syrup)I servrd it to company and they thought it was great. We just used frozen fillets and it worked out well. Aquick meal to prepare.

A great alternative to marinating and grilling salmon, as I usually do. My family much preferred this "less fishy taste". Instead of just topping with the butter/honey mustard mixture, I instead covered/dunked the entire fillet with it (as you'd do with an egg batter) and breaded the whole thing before baking. I ommitted the pecans, because I didn't have any onhand, but I bet that would make it even better. Thanks!

I give this a 3-star, sorry.  It's good- don't get me wrong- but not great in my house.  Son and husband love salmon and thought this was good but not the best.  I personally would do it with less topping and be sure to be very generous with glaze.  I did follow the recipe to a tee, too, which is unusual for me!  Don't be afraid to give it a try, as you may love it, but I'm not going to make it again.  Good luck!

3.5*  My husband liked the honey mustard (to make this healthier, I did not include the butter), which was what he tasted the most.  All I tasted was fish and the breadcrumbs.  Our salmon HAD been previously frozen... perhaps this would taste better if we had fresh fillets (not able to get them here, though).  I'll keep looking for the 'best' salmon recipe.

This turned out good BUT, my salmon had a "fishy" taste.  I marinated mine all day in a citrus marinade hoping to eliminate that problem and proceeded as directed.  I like the honey mustard mixture and added some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs.  I did use frozen fillets rather than fresh so that maybe where the problem lies.  I'm passing this recipe on to my mother who enjoys salmon too.  Thanks for sharing.

I am a fresh-out-of-college girl with little cooking experience.  This worked for me and was fabulous.  I got a little overzealous with the pecans/breadcrumbs...next time I will let the honey mustard shine through a bit more.  Thank you, thank you for this recipe!

I made this a couple nights ago.  It turned out really well.  It tasted like restaurant food.  I think I'm going to try it on another type of fish too.

Fantastic recipe for salmon. Quick, easy and delicious.  Had company over for dinner and they all raved about it. Second time I made it, I didn't have any honey so I substituted brown sugar and it still tasted great.

We love BBQing salmon filets in their skin after marinating in BC salmon marinade (may only be available in Canada).  This recipe is definately a close second and is a nice change for us.

Wow!  My boyfriend really disliked salmon until I made this dish.  Thanks so much.  I now have an easy but delicious dish to make us during the busy work week.  I buy a bunch of frozen salmon at Sam's Club and I can eat this often.  Thanks again.

I am a very untalented man in the kitchen, however, this was so easy to make and extremely hard to foul up.  My entire family loves it & it has now become a regular at our dinner table.  Five stars for flavor & five plus for ease.

Absolutely superb, my husband is a big salmon fan and I am always on the lookout for new salmon recipes - he loved this! I used blanched almonds instead of pecans (all I had on hand) and I would next time slather on the honey-mustard mixture instead of brushing it lightly.

Amazing recipe. 

I've made it twice and the second time I put the glaze on a bit thicker and I didn't crush the pecans so much.

Absolutely fabulous!!  Salmon is one dish I order OFTEN when we eat out, and am delighted to finally find a recipe that resembles the salmon served in the finest restuarants...not like the poach in wine/broiled with lemon and butter varieties that are done ad nauseum.  Like another reviewer, I allowed the butter mix to cool and coagulate so that I could sop it alllll on.  I only deviated from the recipe with cook time.  Although I don't like overcooked salmon, I don't quite trust undercooked salmon, so I baked it for more like 20 min.  The sauce and breading would have been enough for an extra serving, by the way.  I won't be ordering salmon so often anymore.  Why should I?  This recipe tops them!  Many thanks, Arnie, for sharing this great recipe. In my top 10 for certain.

This is so delicious and AMAZINGLY simple.  I couldn't find any bread crumbs so I crushed up some cereal (that doesn't have sugar)and sprinkled it on top.  I loved it and my family raved about it!!!! Now I know why this recipe got so many good reviews--thanks for sharing Arnie!

If you like somewhat "sweet" salmon, then this is a good recipe.  I, however, would prefer a more savory salmon dish. Not very flavorful.

This is an excellent recipe.  I make it all the time, however I leave the butter out now--it doesn't add any more flavor, and who needs the fat???
 Sometimes I like to sub regular mustard for dijon, crackers for the breadcrumbs and honey roasted cashews for the pecans.  Yummy!!!

This was very good and tender, but the flavor isn't as intense as I expected.  Don't get me wrong, it is delicious, but it's flavors are very gentle.  I would reccomend adding the salt and pepper to either the crumb mixture or the honey mustard mixture rather than seasoning it afterwards.  An excellent way to prepare salmon.

Excellent!  The combination of honey/Dijon with the nuts and bread crumbs was delicious.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and it was still good.  I ended up with leftover sauce and breadcrumb mixture.

I am always looking for good salmon recipes... and I thought this one was great. It was a little sweet for my tastes, so I think I might cut down on the honey a little bit. Other than that, I thought this was great.

This was super easy to make!! I don't cook fish- just because i dont know how!!! This was a great dish that was easy, and YUMMY! I couldnt believe it the taste. I served w/fresh lemons on the side- and did skip the pecan's.  Thanks for posting this recipe!! Now, im on the hunt for other fish recipes. Thanks again!

i'm very impressed. ez, fast and very tasty.  i was a bit leary about the dijon and honey and then the nuts! but it's superb!  my 2 yr old ate half of my salmon and he rarely eats fish!  i didnt even salt/pepper (forgot) the fish and it came out great!  i'm the kind of gal who ususally just broils salmon in butter.  not anymore!  p.s. you can do this in your toaster-oven!  i will try this recipe w/chicken too.

I thought this salmon was great. Everyone I made it for loved it!  I used a little less mustard than called for and added some salt to the pecan mixture to give it a little more flavor. I also coated both sides of the salmon with the honey mixture and then the pecan mixture.  Excellent!

My family really loved this recipe. We have had it twice this month alone. Even my 6 year old ate it and she can be picky. Thanks for the great addition to my favorite recipes.

This is a wonderful change from the usual lemon salmon.  It is simple to prepare, but tastes like it took a while.  I don't usually use all of the topping, though.  Delicious!

This recipe is the best - No more expensive bottled seafood marinades for our salmon!  I used cashews because I didn't have pecans on hand.  I can't wait to serve it to guests!

I thought the taste of this was rather odd.  My husband hated it, and my father-in-law loved it.  I think I may have brushed on too much of the mustard mixture, because it tasted way too tangy/mustardy.  I didn't have any honey, so I used honey dijon mustard; and almonds instead of pecans.  It was a very pretty recipe on the plate, but I probably wouldn't make it again.  Sorry.

This was just okay. For some reason, we couldn't really taste the dijon very much, and it seemed kind of bland. Not terrible, but for the calories (one quarter cup of butter) I expected it to have a little more zing.

This was very quick and easy, but good! We omitted the pecans due to a nut allergy, but it was still delicious.

This is the best salmon recipe that I have ever tried. It was fast and easy and the entire family loved it. I would probably cut back on the butter next time just to cut the fat. UPDATE 2006: I first rated this in 2002 and I thought I should update my review. I always cook my salmon this way. The only thing that I have changed is that I leave off the pecans and butter. I mix equal parts of the mustard and honey and spread it on the fish. My 8yr.old loves it so much that he will take the leftovers to school and eat them cold! Thanks again for this great recipie.

Exceptionally good! Did not have honey and pecans in my pantry, so I ended up using white sugar and walnuts (respectively, using the same measurements). Can't wait to make it again.

I think this was the best salmon I ever had.  My family loved it.  For anyone who is worried about it tasting like mustard -- it doesn't. My mother doesn't like mustard and she didn't know it was there!

Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe! I'm typically not a huge fan of Salmon and I've never cared for Dijon mustard but in this case I truly can't get over this fabulous combination. My family finished every single bite! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written but the only parsley that I had on hand was from my spice cabinet. Still it suited the dish very well. I will definitely be making this 5 star recipe again and again. Thank you!!

Had neither pecans nor parsley and instead added these as per suggestion :
In Breadcrumb mix: 2tsp garlic powder, 1tsp paprika, 1 or 2 tsp each of dried oregano and basil.

Butter mix: did Not have enough dijon so added whole grain mustard. Appeared a bit too much for our 2 piece but we like extra sauce but this one just hardens due to the crumbs.

Husband likes it and thinks its special. Photo shown I served with rice and dollop a bit of the sauce on top of it. No lemon either so put lime instead. Would make again

Delicious!  Made it as per the recipe except, since I didn't have any plain pecans, I used praline pecans.   I salted & peppered the salmon prior to adding the toppings.  The only thing I might try next time is to make a paste out of the wet and dry ingredients instead of applying them separately in order to completely moisten the bread crumbs.  I also do not understand the negative reviews.  Maybe poor quality salmon?

This was pretty good , but the toppings can be reduced by at least half-- and the butter should be reduced even more so that the honey and mustard flavors are predominant. Next time I may reduce the ratio of breadcrumbs to pecans also. Otherwise it was a quick and yummy main dish worth serving to company. 
Note: Tried this a second time with changes noted above; I also let the butter-mustard-honey mixture cool a bit so that it thickened, before brushing it on the fish. It stayed on better and held the nut topping better. Upgrading to five stars with these changes. Delicious!

We love this sauce!  We did not find the mustard to be overpowering. I've made this recipe 2 times. The first time I removed the skin so the sauce was all over the fish. The second time I was in a hurry & didn't.  We prefer it with the skin removed so that we have more of the sauce flavor.  The only thing I did differently was use 6 oz fillets instead of 4 oz. ones. There is plenty of sauce for the bigger fillets.  Since there are two of us, we get 2 meals from this recipe.

This was really delicious!  The only change I made was to use a mixture of crushed Rice Kripies and ground almonds for my topping as there is a pecan allergy in our family.   A little dash of cayenne in the crumb topping have it just the right a,out of kick.  This one's a keeper!!

We loved it, and will make it again. I did add some smoky paprika / pepper flake spice to the butter/mustard mix and it was wonderful! As another review mentioned I used Progresso's Italian bread crumbs with addtl dried parsley because that's all I had, but so great! I also added some maple agave since I didn't have honey. That added a great touch, I really loved it, thanks!

I can only give this an OK and have to agree with some other lower ratings here - don't understand all the rave. It is very bland, nothing refreshing to it. It definitely needs some work. I gave it a 3 star rating though, because I liked the crustiness.  It's not worth doing again.

I made this dish for the first time last night, and it turned out wonderful. My husband (the BBQ King) had planned on barbecuing the 2 pound salmon fillet we had in the fridge, but instead I cut it in half and used this recipe - only making minor adjustments... He took one bite and said every time we have salmon it needs to be made like this! I used 1/2 cup butter and closer to 3 tbsp honey when making the sauce. I had also bought the cheapest Dijon mustard I could find. I let the butter sauce thicken slightly before heavily slathering both sides of the fish (my filet had no skin) and I let it marinade in the fridge for about an hour and a half. When it was time to get the oven ready I took it out of the fridge and moved both pieces of the salmon fillet from the square pan I had it in to marinade, to a roasting pan covered in foil... At the same time putting the butter sauce in the microwave for 30 seconds. Once it was melted I slathered both sides of the fish one more time before adding the bread topping (I used Panko breading and added 1/4 cup parmesan cheese). I put it in the oven for 20 minutes, then put it in the broiler on medium heat for two minutes. I did not add any salt, pepper, lemon, or anything else suggested and it came out perfectly! I have never had fish cooked so wonderfully, and there was absolutely nothing soggy about the coating. The broiler added the perfect touch to the crispiness in the breading. I will definitely be making this again!

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I scaled it to two nice-sized servings, for my husband and me. He doesn't like pecans, so I , like other reviewers, also subbed almonds. I added the salt and pepper to the bread crumb/almond mixture and used some dried parsley,  instead, then mixed it with 1 tbl. extra melted butter. It was so good I forgot the lemon entirely, and didn't miss it. I cooked it in my toaster oven on the convection setting at 375° for 15 minutes, and it was perfectly cooked.  Laid it over a bed of  lightly herbed and sautéed  roasted spaghetti squash with wilted baby spinach and baby kale: beautiful AND tasty!

This is an exceptionally good recipe.   Great taste, easy and quick to make...

 Salmon is one of our favorite meals. I made this recipe for the first time... As I always do when making a recipe for the first time ...I follow the recipe as closely as possible... I used panko  for my bread crumbs, and maille  dijon mustard.

When I make this recipe again, I will go with a thicker coating of the mustard honey sauce on the Salmon and increase the pecan content...  I might add a little salt before serving

I served the Salmon with rice  and asparagus with hollandaise sauce.  I used fresh sockeye filets.

Writing this review makes me want to make this gem of a recipe soon.

This is amazing, probably one of the best salmon recipes I've ever done. I  think I could left the salmon with the honey mixture for a little while before baking and it would be even better.

Both my husband and I loved this dish, we loved the dijon mustard glaze.  It's a definite repeat at our house.  It's good baked and grilled.  Also freezes and reheats well.

I found it to be rather bland. If it hadn't been for the sprinkle of lemon it would really have been blah.  I  know there are many types of salmon and maybe mine is a rather tasteless variety.  I did skin it before doing anything with it and left it in the butter/mustard stuff for a couple of hours before putting in the oven.  It wasn't BAD but I had higher hopes for it. sorry but probably won't make again.

This recipe is fantastic! I used wild caught Sockeye Salmon with skin on. Seasoned with salt and pepper and basted my filets with the butter, Dijon, and honey mixture then left them sit in the fridge for a few hours. I basted a little more than lightly. When I was ready to bake I topped with the remaining ingredients. Loved it! Delicious and easy and will absolutely be making these again. Thanks Esmee for sharing your recipe.

I am not a salmon lover, but my husband is. This recipe was AMAZING!! I loved it and so did my husband. I had seen a review on being bland and so untrue. I had put a little kosher salt and ground pepper on the salmon before putting the butter, honey and mustard mixture on and there was no need for extra seasoning at the end. Had panko instead of regular bread crumbs and turned out very moist!!

This is excellent!  Very tasty and NOT bland at all!
This has been frequently requested by my family to make.
It is one of our favorites.

Delicious!  This is definitely a make again.  Served the salmon with creamy polenta and sautéed yellow squash and zucchini.  The beer in the pic is a Belgian witbier from a local Chicago brewery called Ten Ninety.

Delicious!  I doubled the amount of pecans and breadcrumbs for a 1.5 lb filet.  Everything else I kept the same and there was plenty of mustard mixture to cover.  Salmon isn't my family's favorite, but they all loved this and even went back for seconds!!

Delicious. Had a nice side of wild salmon, baked it skin-side-down with about 1/2 the toppings. The honey-mustard complemented the salmon really well; loved the crunch of the topping, and it was perfect at 15 minutes baking time.

I have made this several times, most recently for a large family Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it - and thought it was the best salmon they ever had.  I like to make extra sauce and drizzle a bit over the salmon just before serving.

This recipe is one of the best ways to change up salmon.  My kids love it.  It is incredibly easy to make and is always a hit!  I have made it several times, following the recipe instructions exactly.  I have also made it with agave nectar instead of honey and it was still delicious.  I prefer using panko-style bread crumbs for this recipe.

This recipe was so quick and simple to make; very little kitchen clean-up required.  My wife, not a lover of fish, said 'it was not fishy at all".  The salmon paired well with the nutty Dijon flavors.  A light dish when eating healthy.  I served it with garlic sautéed asparagus which complimented it quite well.

I normally don't like fish, but this was excellent! I followed the recipe except that I did what others said and cut down on the balsamic vinegar (1/4 cup), and I did not have any parsley but it still turned out great.  My kids loved it and said they'd love me to make it again.  So, seeing as I'd like to add fish to our diet, this will definitely be part of our rotation.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a delicious recipe that is fast and easy to make! Instead of dijon mustard, I substitute stone ground mustard for a stronger, spicier flavor. I also exclude the bread crumbs and just use extra pecans. The best!

My boyfriend and I both loved this recipe. I made it with fresh Sockeye Salmon with the skins on. I didn't have pecans so I used almonds that I had on hand. I had errands to run so I prepared these ahead of time and let them marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours before actually baking them.  Fish is one of those foods I have to make myself eat because I'm just not a big fish person BUT this was really delicious!!! My boyfriend even said, "Dinner was exceptional!"

This was a delicious and impressive dish to serve. I made my own breadcrumbs since I do not use them often enough to buy a canister, and that added freshness. I found that the recipe made far more sauce and breadcrumb topping than was needed for 4 four ounce fillets so I might reduce the amount next time by one third or one half. Overall, yum!

I never found a recipe that I liked for salmon, until this one! This is absolutely delicious, and has been a huge hit at every holiday I've made it for (which has now been several)! Although it's great the way the recipe states, over time I've made a few small changes. I first salt and pepper the filet itself, and sprinkle some lemon juice over it. I also don't use the pecans, and instead use panko breadcrumbs in place of regular. I add lemon juice and fresh garlic to the mustard and honey mixture, along with the fresh parsley. SO good!!!

This recipe was delicious!  I added slightly more honey (suggest doing a taste test to get the dijon to honey ratio to your liking). Extra sauce was drizzled over the top of the salmon filets. Quick, easy, and tasty!  Will be making this regularly!

Dijon and salmon didn't sound like a good combination to me, but it actually works!  Good flavor - the dijon is not overwhelming.  I would brush each salmon filet generously and cut the sauce in half (you'll just throw the excess away anyhow).  Leave the pecans a bit chunky for texture.  I was worried it would be too dry with no marinade in the pan, but it was perfect.

This is a great recipe which has a regular rotation in our home. I substituted organic maple syrup for the honey and omitted the breadcrumbs as for health reasons we don't do gluten anymore (and didn't want to mess with gluten-free crumbs.)  I will admit to laziness this round and mixed everything together, wet and dry, and slathered it on top of the salmon -which ended up working out just fine. I served it with roasted garlic zucchini spears and a simple lemony arugula salad.

A favorite for my family. Even my 8 year old gobbles it up. Super yummy and easy. Just pre-season the salmon to your taste before applying the mustard/ honey/ butter mixture.

Yummy yummy!!! Sweet and tangy.  I always cook salmon in the broiler because I prefer the juiciness that comes from it, so I did that with this recipe.  Needs about 12 minutes in the broiler if you have thick fillets, 8-10 for thinner/smaller ones.  The pecans are a really wonderful addition!

My friend made this for my husband and I.  It was grilled on a wood pellet grill.  Oh my!  It was fabulous!  I don't understand how this could have gotten any bad reviews at all.  It has been 3 weeks since we had it and my husband has been talking about it almost every day and he doesn't usually like salmon at all.  I am surprising him tonight.  We are buying a wood pellet grill this spring!

I followed the recipe exactly, and for being a college student who doesn't cook "real" meals much, this was a great dish. No overpowering taste anywhere, but just all went well together. I just added green beans as a side and enjoyed.

I think the basic recipe would be great, but I had to change ingredients according to what I had on hand. It turned out amazingly good!
 
I placed two hefty Salmon Steaks (1.72 lbs. total) on a cookie sheet lined with non-stick aluminum foil sprayed with Wegmans 100% Extra Virgin Olive Oil Spray.

I added about 3/4 Tbsp. of Horseradish Mustard to the Dijon Mustard (last of the jar) and used Ian's All Natural Whole Wheat Panko Bread Crumbs & 1 Tbsp. dried parsley. Due to dairy sensitivity, I replaced the butter with *Earth Balance Soy Free Natural Buttery Spread (Butter would be to die for!), and used Wegmans Organic Wildflower Honey.

I slathered the Mustard/*Butter/Honey mixture on the salmon. Coated them heavily with the Panko/Pecan/Parsley mixture. Flipped the fish over and repeated on the other side. I also took a toothpick and secured the thinner "tails" of each fish together to prevent them from over-cooking.

Baked the fish, turning halfway through cooking, until done. (145 degrees internal temperature.) They were perfectly done.

Served with two side dishes:
 
1. Jasmin Rice & Baby Bella Mushrooms. Rice cooked in water seasoned with Organic Better than Bouillon Chicken Base (about a rounded Tbsp). Mushrooms sauteed in small amount of Pure Sesame Oil and Asian Stir-fry oil.

2. Steamed fresh Asparagus.

My adult son, with a fine pallet, said this must be made again.

Yummy!  I have usually made salmon with just dijon and honey, but the butter sauce and crunchy topping were delicious.  I substituted 1 tsp. dried parsley as another reviewer suggested because that's all I had on hand.  Also used walnuts in place of pecans because that's what I had.  I think it will be even better with pecans. Served with couscous and corn-on-the-cob.  Super fast and yummy!

After getting a ton of salmon fillets on sale at my local grocer I had to start hunting for more recipes than the average kinds. I was afraid of this dish at first for fear it might be to sweet/tangy but man I was wrong. Even my toddler loved it (with some of the toppings taken off as to not be to strong for his little taste buds). 

The only things I did a wee bit different was used only 3/4 of the Dijon and put the pecans through an electric chopper to make them crumb size. And I didn't brush lightly with the sauce. I put a good amount on. 

Everyone's tastes are different so take the negative comments with a grain of salt. If you like a nice sweet touch to your fish (think maple salmon) this recipe will do. If your into just the regular herbed/wine fish then this might be to much on the taste level for you.

Very good!  I didn't have any Dijon mustard, so I substituted about a teaspoon of honey mustard.  My husband liked it and suggested I try using cod or halibut with it next time.

I only used this recipe as a starting point.  I used the Dijon, honey and pecans (completely skipped the bread crumbs, butter and parsley).  It was absolutely delicious! I'm sure it is even better as directed, but I was trying to save on calories and carbs.

Very delicious! I added a bit more honey as I love it sweet. I used regular mustard and the combination of the tartness and sweetness of the honey is great! This is an easy recipe and will make this again.

this is FAB and super easy to make!
I only had pinioli (pine) nuts no walnuts, I didn't use butter or salt (trying to be a little healthier).
And it still GREAT. Its fantastic, I am eating it right now and couldn't wait to right the review:)

Great recipe.... A definite favorite! I pretty much follow the exact directions without modifications. We enjoy salmon on the grill, but the honey/Dijon/butter adds a nice depth of flavor. I do prefer panko bread crumbs  for the topping. 5 stars,

We thought this came out great!  Much better than the Maple one that has tons of ratings.  My only caveat would be that if you have fresh thick salmon steaks, count on much longer cooking time.   And by fresh, I mean, caught by my husband.  The thickness was around 1 inch in the middle and at minimum took 25 minutes.  So pay close attention to the "until flakes easily with fork" rather than the time of 12-15 minutes.

I loved this recipe: anyone who calls is bland/tasteless is either used to overseasoned or overspiced food. This had a nice tang with a fair amount of sweet (I did not use salt or pepper).

The only issue with this recipe is, when used with 4 (4 ounce) fillets, the sauce and crumbs are way too much. I would cut the mustard mix down by about 1/4 and the breadcrumb mix down by 1/2 (keep the proportions the same, the volume just needs to drop).

Other than that, this dish was awesome and easy to make. Everyone loved it. (Served with steamed broccoli and sugar snap peas.)

I love salmon! I love it as sushi. I love it spiced and baked. I love it in so many ways and now I love it with this great recipe Honey mustard! Such an unexpected and great new taste to add to my pallet. Thank you.

My husband and I loved it. We used almonds instead of pecans because we didn't have any. Very enjoyable recipe and we wilk surely make it again.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought it was too mustard-y.  The second time I switched the measurements for mustard and honey, then I loved it.  I've made it several times since, with 3 T honey and 1.5 T mustard.  I do not add salt and pepper and lemon.

this was amazing only thing i would change is to add MORE dijon and less honey if you want it to have a more tangy flavor and for it to be less sweet.

Very good! But I would strongly recommend that you use fresh fish, not frozen. I've tried it twice, once with fresh salmon and once with frozen, and the freshness was the difference between delicious and disappointing.

This was the best dinner I've ever made. I hadn't cooked salmon before, it turned out very well (I cooked the salmon wrapped in al foil ).  Thank you for posting a recipe that is not only excellent, but simple and (depending ob liberal one is with the buter!) healthy.

This was really good. I made it exactly the way the recipe stated. However, after trying the "Spicy Salmon with Carmelized Onions" recipe on this site, this recipe didn't impress me like that one does. I'll make it again, but if anoyone is looking for another great recipe, try that one for sure...especially if you like spicy stuff!!

I've made this a few times now- minus the nuts but I think they would be a delicious addition. I'll add a few spices to the breadcrumbs- paprika or red pepper flakes. Thanks for sharing, Esmee!

Tried this recipe and the Baked Salmon Dijon with just Dijon and breadcrumbs and preferred the less sweet no pecan recipe, but this is very good and some people who like a little sweet with their salmon would really like this I am sure. It is easy, good and fancy looking.

This salmon was absolutely delicious! I made it for dinner today, just finished eating so I came back on here to rave about it! After reading several of the reviews, I decided to keep the recipe almost exactly the same. The only tiny change I made was to use panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs because I wanted more crunch. But that's it! I used whole grain dijon mustard and the frozen salmon fillets that you can buy in a vacuum packed package (I left them in the fridge overnight to defrost, per the package instructions). The fillets fit perfectly into my 9x13 glass baking dish and they were cooked perfectly after 15 minutes. I served the salmon with basmati rice (boiled with a chicken bouillon cube) and marinated spinach with chickpeas and onions. The entire meal was to die for and I couldn't believe how good it tasted! I will definitely be using this recipe again for salmon.. it was so easy and tasty! Check out the photo I posted as well :)

Divine! Hands down the best salmon recipe I have ever used, and I make salmon 2-3 times per week. I made a few modifications, but not because I wanted to tinker with the recipe; I read the recipe wrongly (thought it was equal parts honey to dijon mustard), was low on butter, and ran out of honey! 
What I did:
I used 1 T butter, 1 T honey, 2-3 T dijon mustard, 1 T lite maple syrup. I used cornbread crumbs instead of breadcrumbs because it was what I had on hand. I applied the mustard mix liberally to both sides, sprinkled both sides with the cornbread topping, and reserved the rest of the mustard mix, adding about 1 t. white vinegar per the advice of other reviewers and then used the remainder as a dipping sauce. OUTSTANDING! 

My fillets were around 5-7 oz. I baked at 400 for 13 minutes and they were a bit overdone for my taste. Next time I will reduce baking time by a couple minutes. The finished product was still superb and we gobbled it up, but I like my salmon a little less done. 

I never, ever review recipes, but this is truly a phenomenal one and warrants a review. I cannot praise it enough! My husband and I both talked about it all evening. I am already looking forward to making it again. Delicious, easy, fast, and versatile. The best salmon recipe bar none!

My husband and I are seafood lovers with Salmon being on the menu once/week.  We are always looking for new and inventive ways to eat salmon so I tried this recipe and its great!!  Definitely will be adding this to the regular roster.  I have had honey mustard salmon many times before and this ranks up there with the best of them.  It is a little sweeter than usual but simply add a little more mustard next time.

This was very good and nice and easy to make.  I stop short of 5 stars because it just needs something, I just can't figure out what.  I loved the texture of the bread crumbs and pecans.  I followed the recipe almost exactly- I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dry.  I would definitely make this again, maybe play with some more spices.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was fabulous, as is.  Did a side dish of baked red potatoes, a perfect, easy meal.  Totally agree with the comment that you should not provide negative reviews when you don't follow the recipe.  My favorite dish is salmon, and this was a wonderful variation.   I increased all the ingredients proportionality to serve 4, and my family loved it!

I love dijon and I love salmon. This recipe just brings my two loves together. It was really delicious and I added a bit extra dijon on because it needed it. I also sprinkled some Cayenne pepper on top of the breadcrumbs - delish. I'm sure you could add your own seasoning to the breadcrumbs if you like it saltier, spicier, etc. But otherwise the dijon did it for me.

Love this recipe.  I usually skip bread crumbs and just use pecans. My kids do not like fish, they love this, and can't wait till I make it again. We made garlic red potatoes and roasted vegetables with it.

This is awesome!  I made it today and served it on a bed of lettuce with raspberry vinegrette dressing.   I split the recipe in half and still had extra of both the liquid and dry ingredients mixes so I think I will probably cut back a little on all the ingredients next time.   I really enjoyed it.  Thanks for the recipe!

One of the ten best things I've eaten. Absolutely the perfect balance of flavors, and the crunch of the pecans and crumbs (I used panko--I have a thing for panko)was just delicious.  Thanks for a great and very easy, quick recipe. I even scaled it to one serving (just me,thanks--Mr. Moosetrax was working) and it was outstanding.

Good; our family just didn't care for the flavor so well.  We like just about everything too.  All three of us did not finish our salmon.  I can see the flavor working well for some though, as it tasted good on it's own.  Our family may just not care for salmon as much.

My husband and I tried this tonight. I followed the recipe exactly except that we cut it in half and had only two portions. I did think it was slightly dry and may have been done after 10-11 minutes. I will check it sooner next time.

Delicious - my two guys and I loved it.  I ran into a problem, though - one that a newbie makes LOL I didn't have any pecans and didn't want to run to the store.  Luckily, I had a bag of walnuts in the freezer and so I used them.  The fish turned out perfect!

I am a creature of habit and make the same things all the time.  However, for some reason, this reciped inspired me, and I'm not even a big fan of salmon.  I prepared this last night for my husband, who loves salmon, my parents, both of whom are incredible chefs, my grandmother and my uncle.  All of them were impressed and sincerely loved it.  I even loved it.  I am already looking forward to making it again and impressing my friends. I still can't believe how easy it was to prepare.  I followed the instructions pretty closely.  As recommened by another reviewer, I recommend tasting the honey mustard before putting on the salmon.  I think the key is that they honey cuts the strong mustard taste.  Also, I definitely recommend serving with a lemon wedge.  The fresh lemon juice added some extra magic to it all.

Excellent! Salmon is not my favorite fish but I really like it made this way.  I've made this twice with a few little changes. I don't use butter since salmon is a moist fish. Instead of honey I use agave. Also no pecans ( which I'm sure are great) because my son cannot have tree nuts.

I make this gluten free and lower carb by simply deleting the bread crumbs, adding a few more nuts and replacing the honey with splenda or some other lower carb sweetener. Even those who are not diabetic or on a gluten free diet enjoy it. I salt and pepper, top with mustard mixture, then nuts and either cilantro or parsley.....always a hit. I've done this with both fresh and frozen salmon. Of course fresh is best but frozen is handy. Just pop the frozen salmon out of the freezer and proceed as above, bake a little longer.

Second time I'm making this. As mentioned below, honey mustard DOESN'T cut it. Gotta use both honey and dijon. I used bold'n'spicy dijon, and adored it. Also made with walnuts, also very good. Sauce is so good, you can use it on your side-dish!

My lower rating could be due to my error. I had a lot more marinade than I think was necessary and put it all on my fish fillets thinking more is better. It wasn't. It was too much sweet and I think caused the fish to be soggy. I couldn't get a crust on it. If I make again I will definitely only lightly brush the marinade on. And I will use less honey if any, due to the sweetness.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! I did use seasoned bread crumbs for breading and given my love of dill, I used dill instead of parsley. Also I didn't use pecans, as I did not have any. This recipe is a definite keeper, full of flavor. Fantastic :)

Ate this Sunday night.  Cooked it on the grill, though, on one of those holey grill-trays lined with parchment.  This would have made a big mess otherwise!  Used the same amount of ingredients for 3 6 ounce salmon fillets, so was able to slather the honey mustard and cover with the bread mixture pretty thoroughly.  Had to substitute dried parsley for the fresh, but it still tasted lovely.

Delicious! I misread amount of mustard and honey and used 4 tablespoons of each instead of the stated, but turned out fabulous. Also didn't melt butter, just softened it and mixed together. Used Panko bread crumbs instead of plain ones. Had some fresh chives in garden, so added some with the parsley. Served with steamed asparagus, drizzled with the honey and mustard sauce (had extra since I used more honey and mustard). Husband loved it! Will make again.

The sauce for this recipe is very good, however, when it says "Brush lightly" make sure you don't brush TOO lightly. I made that mistake and there wasn't much flavor on the fish. But definitely will make it again!

I wish there were more stars...a friend of ours gave us some wild salmon which neither of us is fond of.   I did a search for recipes and came upon this...now we can't wait to have it again!The only thing I did was cut down on the honey a little...it's amazing how the melted butter just brought everything together for the sauce.  I served the extra sauce on the side.  Loved it...

I read a few reviews that said this dish was bland but since it was highly rated, I still decided to do it. Truthfully, I should have listened to the few. The dish was bland and the next time I try it again, I will add more honey and Dijon mustard and pour the sauce on the salmon with less bread crumbs and sans pecans. My advice is for you to do the same. I ended up just squeezing lemon on top.

This recipe for salmon was very good. I'm not a huge fan of salmon however it was tasty and very flavorful. The only change I made was to substitute panko for the breadcrumbs for more crunch.

This fish is adorable tasting! Even my kids that hate seafood loved this one! They said it looked like a shark before I baked it, lol. (*Skin side*) It was very juicy with outstanding flavor. We ate it with a side of Mexican rice!!

Delicious! I followed this recipe almost exactly except I forgot the pecans and I salted and peppered the fish before brushing the wonderful sauce and then lightly spreading the bread crumbs. It will be wonderful to try this next time with the chopped pecans too. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks so much for sharing!

I really liked this salmon recipe. I used Smart Balance instead of butter (healthier), and I used walnuts instead of pecans because I only had walnuts on hand. I let the sauce sink into the salmon a bit before adding the walnut topping. The end result was a subtly sweet and tangy salmon dish with a delightful crunch. I served this with honey roasted potatoes and lemon squash, and it was a great, relatively quick dinner.

Just OK.  Smelled wonderful while cooking & looked pretty, but the flavor is just ok, pretty bland.

I gave it a second try, doubled up on the mustard & smeared the sauce on thick on plain chicken breasts.  My family liked this combo a lot better.  I also mixed in a dollop of the sauce with some frozen peas before I cooked them.  They were gobbled up right quick!

I was looking for another way to bake salmon besides the traditional lemon, salt, and pepper. I came across his recipe and had to try it. It was a absolute success and enjoyed every bite. I had made it for my Grandma and she was raving about how delicious it was. Its now become a part of my recipe book.

Lovely! 

Unfortunately I realized a bit late I didn't have any honey so I upped the Dijon mustard so the spread with (1.5 tsp of) margerine would cover the fillet. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I didn't try it with all the ingredients - the concept is excellent however, and I'll try it with the honey next time. 

Soooo good!

I crave this recipe when I crave salmon! I use extra sauce because that's how I like it. I also use walnuts instead of pecans. 
This recipe is very simple & very quick. I have heard people say how salmon is hard to make, and all I can think of is how easy it is, especially this recipe!
Only drawback is that my kids dont like salmon, so I don't make often unless they are at their dads.

This is an amazing recipe!  Even the kids who do not like mustard of any sort had seconds or thirds.  I love the fact that it really doesn't take anytime to make :)
Will most definitely make again.

This is one of those dishes where I'm shocked that anyone wouldn't give it 5 stars. But then again, you can't please everyone. I follow it to a tee and everyone loves it. In my estimation there are people who love salmon and don't want anything to overpower the flavor and those who tolerate salmon and couldn't care less either way. I suppose the former may not like this recipe because the mustard can add a lot of flavor (we use german mustard). We eat salmon at least twice a month and this a delicious and simple way to change things up. Hooray for another excellent addition to Lenten Friday dinners!!

Made the recipe as written, we did not care for the breading so much. I think this recipe would be so much better over chicken breast, just my opinion! Thanks for sharing.

I enjoyed this dish. I made one small change to this recipe. I used almond flour instead of bread crumbs. The result was mighty good. The honey mustard dressing gave this dish a real sparkle. I saved this recipe in my box for future use.

WAY too much Dijon, and the bread crumbs and pecans were not needed at all.  I too, bought a very thick expensive piece of salmon, and this recipe didn't fit the fish.

this recipe turned out absolutely delicious.  I didnt make any changes ingredients wise, but i did pour the remaining sauce around the fillets and let that bake in an aroma. It makes the kitchen smell wonderful. This was our valentine's day meal last year and usually my girlfriend hates the taste of fish but loved this enough to ask for me to make it a week later. I will be making it again this year for valentine's day.

I didnt have course dijon as some suggested so i used regular dijon and it was good. next time i may leave out the nuts and the panko only because the bread crumbs didn't crisp like i thought  it should and the nut my hubby didnt care for it. but all in all this turned out very good

This was good but could use some improvements. I didn't use butter, instead i covered the fish in olive oil and mixed the mustard and honey together. The taste was way too strong. Next time I will either increase the honey or use the butter. Also, the dread crumbs came out a little mushy. This could do well with a qucik pop under the broiler.

Looking for a new way to do salmon, tired of the maple, lemon, or cedar plank.  It was good, not fantastic. Just a different flavor than what we were used to, think it was the mustard/salmon blend on our palate.  May make again to give it another try.

This is a good recipe, however I don't think I'd recommend it for a really good cut of wild salmon as it's flavor masks the salmon flavor somewhat.  Also, the butter mix makes more than you need if you are indeed just brushing it lightly on, you could safely halve it.

Wow! This was amazing. The Honey Dijon and the pecans just went so well together. I had to bake mine a little longer since I had a smaller baking dish, the salmon was packed in pretty tight. I didn't have a lemon garnish, not sure I would want to. 

I will defiantly make this again, a lot.

Delicious and easy. We made it even easier - just 2 ingredients - chopped onion mixed w/grey poupon - baked then broiled.

Way too overpowering with the dijon mustard.  I followed the directions to a tee and that's all you could taste.  Salmon is very expensive so this receipe was a huge disappointement!

Excellent!  I followed the ingredients but did not use the pecans.  I used panko bread crumbs to cover the fish rather than plain bread crumbs.  The recipe did not say if the mustard was whole grain or not.  I found a a cabernet roasted garlic mustard by Vineyard Pantry at the supermarket to add to the flavor.  I also used local honey fresh from the farm stand!

Kept the salmon moist and delicious! I crumbled Townhouse Crackers on top instead of bread crumbs. Probably added more calories, but YUM!

My husband is not a big fan of salmon and said this was the best salmon he has ever had.  As our teenage kids came home, he hit them up and said, "hey, try the salmon.  It's really good."  I didn't have pecans or fresh parsley on hand so I skipped the pecans but substituted dried parsley for fresh.  I like salmon much more than my husband and kids, so if I can please us all, this recipe is a success.

First off, I am not a fish lover.  I make salmon once in a while and that is it.  With that being said, this is one of the best salmon recipes I've ever made!  I used a lot of the sauce & was very generous when I brushed the salmon with it.  It turned out great!  I also didn't have pecans - used crushed sunflower seeds instead which were great too.  One extra thing I did was to place a little slice of butter on top of the crumb mixture before baking and I thought it turned out great that way - I seasoned the salmon w/salt and pepper before brushing the sauce on.  Squeezed lemon over the top before serving is a nice little addtion.  I served white rice & grilled summer squash sprinkled w/garlic salt - delicious!  It was a great meal.  I will definitely make this one again.  So glad I tried it!  I will be making salmon more often now! :)

Wonderful flavor, excellent texture.  I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley and walnut instead of pecan because those were what I had available.  I used strong German mustard instead of Dijon, for a stronger mustard flavor.  I will probably use even more mustard next time I make it.
10 minutes per inch is perfect! 
This was quick, easy, and delicious.  Family are still talking about it, 2 weeks after I made it!

flavorful and so easy, this was a hit. I didn't have dijon mustard so I used 1tbs. Peppadew mustard sauce ( it has a kick) and 2 tbs regular yellow mustard. I made three large pieces and had plenty topping left over. I'll cut down to half the measurements next time.

I love this recipe!  I have made it for myself as well as for guests and everyone just loves it!  The only things that I do a little differently are that I use dill instead of parsley and I do my own breadcrumbs so they are a bit coarser than the ones that you buy in the store.  Personally, I think that salmon demands dill, they go so well together.  I will be making this recipe again and again.

Very good.  Kids all rated it 5 stars; I might have given it 4.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  My only issue is that I had more than double what I needed of the honey mustard sauce, so next time I will double the recipe and keep that part the same.  The pecans were delicious.

This was a nice alternative to my usual methods of preparing salmon. The only changes I made were to use Italian -style bread crumbs (eliminating the need for parsley) and to halve everything for two servings. I found that my filets took a bit longer to cook, more like 20 minutes. After tasting the honey-mustard sauce prior to cooking, I actually expected to enjoy this more, but it seemed like the flavor mellowed while baking. The topping was quite tasty, though, and my husband seemed to really like the dish. He said this was his second favorite salmon recipe, behind the maple salmon from this site. All in all, I will make this again, but I may increase the amount of sauce next time.

Ok, so I did change it a tad, but still, this was very very good.  And maybe I was just extra hungry, but I have tried alot of fish recipes and was just never quite happy.  This one just hit the spot.  I did use tilapia in an effort to shop thriftier, and I also only had almonds on hand.  I used a lite margarine instead of butter.  There was an abundance of crumb mixture so I put it in the freezer to save for another day.  I used Italian crumbs so I didnt add any other spices, not even S&P.  I did hit it with the broiler just to brown it up a bit.  Served with a salad w/lite dressing and lite cottage cheese, and I didnt feel like I was deprived of anything.  Will make this again for sure.  Thank you for sharing
----- just to update, I made it w/Salmon and pecans, exactly as written and it is delish!

Thought this was really good. Had to sub walnuts for pecans since that's what I had on hand, and I halved the recipe, but it sure was tasty! The marinade makes a really good salad dressing, too!

This was out of this world delish!  One of the best Salmon dishes I've made - full of flavor.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried but it still was awesome. I also used italian breadcrumbs, not sure if it made any difference.  Pecans are not neccesary but make it even tastier.  Try this or you are MISSING OUT!!

Great great great - I had never baked salmon before and it came out awesome.  I followed exactly as listed however on two of the pieces I drizzled the left over honey mustard glaze back and forth across the top of the bread crumbs....those were the two best pieces!!

This is our favourite salmon recipe. I can prepare it earlier in the day and refrigerate it until baking so it works well for company. I made it without the pecans (allergies in the family) and used Panko crumbs instead of the breadcrumbs. The salmon was moist and very flavorful. The topping was generous for 2 16oz fillets.

OH my gosh!!! this was heavenly.  I change a few things...  replace parsley with fresh basil because I didn't have the fresh parsley (and I wanted to use fresh).  I also didn't have bread crumbs so I used smashed up multigrain melba toast (worked like a charm).... as well, like another reviewer, I also coated the whole fish with the sauce and the breading.  My husband is not a fan of the salmon taste (he just likes to catch it) and he thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.... which is great since I have a freezer full of salmon!

I used italian seasoned panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs (what I had available).  Broiled it for a couple of minutes at the end.  Turned out crispy and delicious.

I used larger pieces of salmon and doubled the recipe ingredients! Turned out great! Butter sauce was left over, so less could be used. After brushing on the salmon, I poured on a bit more. Cooking time was about 30 min. Family loved it! I will definitely used this again and again!! Italian bread crumbs gave it a bit more flavor.

Actually, I might give 4.5 stars...we enjoyed this one quite a bit. At first I questioned the honey, but the slightly sweet tang was nice, and we're big mustard fans, so that was a no-brainer. I would have to say that the lemon makes it.  Oh, and I substituted panko. Other than that, made it "as written." Served with garlic green beans and a spinach salad. I'll definitely make it again -- thanks for the tasty recipe!!

I made this and thought it was delicious. I used equal parts of mustard and honey though because I wanted it equally sweet and tangy. I also did not use the pecans because I am allergic to nuts.

This was very good!!  I've been making salmon the same way for a few years now but after seeing this recipe I thought I'd try something new.  Glad I did!  Now I have two great ways of preparing salmon.  Love to have options!  I will definitely make this again and I wouldn't change a thing.

One of the best tasting, easiest recipes! Loved it so much on the salmon, decided to try it on chicken. It was delicious. Only thing I did extra was tenderize chicken and make extra sauce to dip in! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was incredible. The salmon was baked to perfect tenderness and the flavor was awesome. My super picky sister even loved it. I would suggest making extra pecan/bread crumb mixture though. I was little tough to make it go around for all fillets. I even had it the next day cold and it was just as tasty!

This is an excellent way to prepare salmon if you want to avoid having that fishy smell in your house. I prepared the dish just as directed except my fillets were about 1inch thick so they took 17 minutes in the oven.

Thought this salmon was wonderful!!  I am not a huge fan of mustard so I applied it sparingly and it was great!!!  Next time I think I will try putting a little more on.  I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown the topping and it turned out perfet!!

I thought this recipe was very, very good. We dont like Dijon mustard so I substitued regular yellow mustard and added a touch more honey. I think the only thing different I would do is to marinated the salmon before hand to give it a little more flavor. Overall, my kids had second helpings (and they are not fans of fish) and hubby gave it two thumbs up. Thank for this wonderful recipe!

Everyone in my family loved this recipe, even my 10 year old that doesn't like fish.  When I make this again, I'll only make 1/2 of the butter/mustard mixture as I threw away at least half of it.  I will make the original amount of the pecan/bread crumb/parsley part, as I used it all and like a lot of crunchy topping.

This was a huuuuge hit! Except i changed it up a little. Instead of using plain pecans i bought the pecan pie glazed pecans, and i put them in the food processor then mixed them with the bread crumbs. I also added a little bit of balsamic glaze to the honey dijon sauce. It was phenominal. Definately will be making this more often. It was really easy too. Kinda expensive, but well worth it.

This was a change from the dill sauce I've always used.. It was delicious, salmon was flaky and moist.  BUT I prefer a dill sauce and I prepared a Spring Salad also.

I don't really know why this recipe received the ratings it did either. The first time i made this i found it to be a bit bland but thought maybe i did something wrong. Tonight, i tried it again and followed all the directions exactly and it still tastes the same, very bland. I really wanted to like this recipe but it does nothing for me. Maybe if you marinate the salmon in the butter/honey mustard sauce instead of just brushing it on it might give it more flavor. Either way, i wont be making this again.

These went over very well in my house.  My picky 3 year old took a few bites, and my husband gobbled it all up and had seconds.  I've made this twice now.  It's very quick to whip up and unlike many baked salmon recipes, it's very moist.  Delicious and will make again.

This was fantastic.  I had a lucky mistake:  After melting the butter, I got sidetracked and let it sit 20 minutes to cool.  I then mixed the mustard and honey, and it made a paste, which was so easy to spread on the salmon and it kept things neat.

This is one of the best salmon recipes I've had.  I do wish I made extra sauce.  It was definitely enough to coat for cooking, but some extra on the side would have been yummy.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent! I didn't change a thing except I used panko bread crumbs and I coated the fillets all around with the wet and dry ingredients. I also ground the pecans for a couple of seconds in the blender for finer crumbs but the flavor still came through. It would make quite an impressive dish for guests. I served it with baked potatoes, green salad and French bread.

This is awesome!  I used panko bread crumbs because I like the light texture they add.  Also I used unsalted butter.  Perfect.  Thank you for sharing.  This is my new go to recipe for salmon, especially if I am going to have guests over.

This was really good! I liked that it was very quick and easy to make...only bad thing was I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand. This would've been even better with some lemon squeezed on top. I was surprised that even my picky husband enjoyed it. Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was really good. I used salmon filets without any skin so I completely coated the filets with the dijon mix and crumb topping. I actually didn't have enough crumb topping to cover all the filets completely, so I will double the crumb topping next time. I used crushed garlic croutons instead of bread crumbs since that's all I had, but it turned out great nevertheless.

This was not very good at all. Nobody in my house would eat this, not even my 1.5 year old, and he is NOT s picky eater. Have to really love dijon to like this. It was all you could taste.

I only made a few modifications to this recipe. To ensure optimum flavour, I used salted butter and panko breadcrumbs. I usually serve this over a bed of salad containing mixed greens, avocado, pumpkin seeds, cherry tomatoes, feta with a mild dressing like poppy seed or even just olive oil mixed with a bit of lemon juice and some fresh cracked black pepper. It's quite delicious. Thank you for the recipe!

By far one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had or cooked!  Wonderful texture and taste.  The thicker the salmon fillet, the less honey dijon flavor.  Next time I will definitely use thinner, smaller fillets.  Thanks for posting!

This was great! My husband loved it! The first time I made it had great honey flavor with nice crust on top. Subsequent times the salmon came out a bit dry. Still have to work that out, but overall an excellent, easy, fast recipe.

Thanks, Esmee, for the wonderful recipe. It's a delicious dish and my hubby loved it! I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and halved the mustard, honey and butter, but I still found it a little too oily. The next time I use this recipe, I'll use less butter.

Very easy recipe, most ingredients already in your pantry.  I didn't have parsley or nuts, so I just used more breadcrumbs (some of which were panko breadcrumbs so it would stay crunchy) and some lemon/herb seasoning mixed into the breadcrumbs.  I added 2 tsp of lemon juice into the butter mixture.  I coated both sides of the fish (after de-skinning), and put down parchment paper on the pan so the bottom wouldn't stick or burn.  This was AWESOME and CHEAP, and my husband ate 2 pieces (and he usually hates fish).  It was so good I am serving it at the next dinner party! Literally no cleanup due to the parchment paper, and no fishy smell in the kitchen.

A nice way to switch it up over my usual grilled salmon.  I used one large filet rather than individual portion and it worked out fine - just increase the baking time.

This was very easy to make.  I didn't use the pecans because my son is allergic.  I also did tilapia using the same ingredients and they were both very good.  I think next time I'll try cutting the butter in half to save calories but very tasty!

I don't eat salmon, but made this for the family.  They liked it and asked me to keep the recipe, but want me to keep looking for more salmon recipes.

This is one of my favorite ways to have salmon!  I don't add the butter, it works just as well without it. I also used Panko break crumbs, it added a great texture.

Wow, did I get excellent reviews when I made this one!  I will possibly switch from grilling to baking altogether now!  It was so delectable and tender, and the glaze tamed the strong flavor of the salmon.  When I ate it, I was thinking it needed more of a sweetness to it, so the next night, for different people, I made it with double the honey!   So good!   This still gets a five, though, because I could imagine serving this many times to come!  Here are my tips:   Tip #1:  Double the honey. Tip #2:  Don't brush the fillets.  Put the glaze in a shallow bowl and dip each fillet in it quickly before placing it on your cooking pan. Tip #3:  Use a Silpat (a silicone pad that is made for cooking pans so bottoms of foods don't get overcooked or burnt onto your nice cookware)--the clean up is so much easier. Tip #4:  If you don't have a food processor, the crust might be frustrating to create.

This was a salmon even my daughter could love. Not too sweet, not overly savory.  I didn't have plain bread crumbs so I used the seasoned ones. It was good that way too.  I still added the parsley even though they were preseasoned and it didn't over power any flavors.  I'm keeping this recipe.

I don't know why I haven't reviewed this recipe yet, I've been making it for years and we love it!  I usually try to prepare salmon at least once a week since it is so nutritious.  Out of all my salmon recipes, this is my husband's favorite.  I usually only use 2 Tbsp. butter to make it a little healthier.  I also like to salt and pepper the salmon before pouring on the sauce.  My favorite parts are the honey and pecans.  Great, easy recipe!

Fabulously delicious! This recipe is so gourmet and so easy. Even my kids loved it. To cut fat I used 1 T. olive oil instead of 1/4 c. butter. I found it needed a bit more baking time. Thanks for an incredible dish.

I have made this for several different events and for dinner at home. It is delicious and always well-recieved. I roll it in the mustard mixture and then roll it in the bread crumb mixture rather than sprinkling it on top.

This is literally my favorite way to eat salmon. We've been making this recipe for a couple of years and it's the tastiest fish recipe you'll find.  My husband makes this and doesn't change the recipe at all (which is amazing for us!).  Love it - thanks for a great recipe.

This was tasty. I sprinkled the pecan mixture over the salmon while it was one the baking sheet right before I put it in the oven. I WON'T do this next time, as the pecan mixture that had fallen to the side became burned and it set off my smoke detectors. :( I will make it again though.

This was wonderful, beautiful, and easy. I had a large fillet of fresh caught Salmon, so I put the mustard and seasonings on the entire thing. I baked it for about 30 minutes. I will save this recipe for the rest of the Salmon that is in the freezer!

To the people saying ignore the bad ratings: I listened to you and tried this recipe.  I'm sorry but it's really bland. Salmon, to me, is a really good fish that should be prepared in a really tasty manor.  This was more like a breaded fish.  I would use this recipe for trout, but not salmon. To anyone considering this recipe: It's okay if you're a chicken nugget and macaroni and cheese kind of person. If you have spent a lot of money on your fish, I would find a better recipe.

As always, choosing fresh, wild (NOT farmed) salmon is crucial to a good outcome. I tend to be a salmon purist and I like to keep flavorings light and simple so as not to take away from the salmon flavor (usually I grill on an alder plank). However, my grill is broken and I decided to try something different with a coho salmon that I had just caught. I was pleasantly surprised that the dijon flavor and nuts compimented the salmon so well. If I make it again I will use 1/2 the called-for dijon and try using a little rosemary and spread the sauce just a little thinner (it is still easy to drown out the delicate salmon flavor). My kids loved it.

I subbed a trans-fat-free margarine for the butter and I subbed Grapenuts Cereal for the breadcrumbs.  It was still out of this world good!!

Fantastic! I'm not even a big mustard fan, but found this great! I did't have pecans so I used macadamia nuts and I think they gave it incredible flavor! For another great fish dish try the broiled parmesan tilapia on this site - it's my favorite!

A friend of mine passed this recipe to me because she loved it and I have to say it is a fantastic way to cook Salmon. I have made yesterday and today and it comes out perfect and I don't even like mustard! Delicious! I have to agree with the other reviewer on the Parmesan Tilapia from this website, I have been making that for over a year and it is simply delicious. I use Nayonaise instead of mayonnaise, (made from Soybeans, A LOT healthier!) and it comes out incredible.

I had to substitute salmon steaks for the fillets which required about 25-20 minutes at 400 degrees, but they came out GREAT!  My fiance loved it and said it was better than anything at Red Lobster!  I took another user's advice and put the honey mustard glaze and crumb mixture on both sides, then added black and crushed red pepper on top since we like a little spice.  Definitely will make this again.

I really enjoyed this recipe for salmon. I am lucky because I get to go down the road and catch salmon and bring it home and clean it and cook it up. I live in Alaska. I am constantly looking for more recipes for salmon. I may add some mayo to this recipe when used in the future. I too used italian breadcrumbs instead of regular.

I used a combo of whole dijon and creamy dijon. The texture was so much better.

Ok so I didn't have salmon. I used Tilapia instead but it still tasted wonderful. Also, I used 1 Tblsp of honey and Honey Dijon Mustard. ***UPDATE*** I finally made this again with salmon and it was delicious. Tilapia 4 stars. Salmon 5 stars.

I'd give it a 4, my husband gives it a 3.  It's pretty good, but we prefer the more traditional recipes for salmon.

This was very easy to prepare and the sauce had a good flavor, however it tended crumble off the fish as I tried to eat it.  Also, the salmon didn't really absorb the flavor.  I will make this again, only next time I will marinate the salmon in the mixture without the breadcrumbs for several hours before cooking, and then I will brush the breadcrumbs on last, right before I pop it in the oven.  I think it will absorb more flavor that way.

My husband and I try to eat salmon every week, so I like to try different recipes. I followed the recipe except for adding 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder. We thought it was amazing. I have printed the recipe to add to my file, as I will be making it again.

This recipe was very good! The fish was moist and flavorful. The only change I made to the recipe is that I totally smoothered the chicken with the dijon mixture and added a little garlic-pepper seasoning. Great recipe and I will definitly use this again!

I really like this recipe, its my favorite way of preparing salmon! Not just because its so simple and quick, but that the taste of honey and mustard on salmon is great.. and baking salmon is healthier than pan-frying! All in all, great recipe!

This was good.  I really liked the honey mustard - it turned out great! Very nice flavor that I did not find bland.  I like that you don't need to marinate it either.  Great recipe!

i think this recipe basically depends on your personal taste buds. the first time i made it i followed the recipe exactly and wasnt too impressed but my wife and daughter loved it. so i made it again but this time after i spread the honey/mustard mixture on the salmon i made a little extra honey/mustard with alot of honey and used it as a sauce that i drizzled over the salmon. my wife and daughter loved it even more and it got two thumbs up from me. the leftovers even passed the test the next day with my Marine buddies at work. Great recipe with the extra sauce.

This is a great way to prepare salmon that can be done without having to make a marinade earlier in the day. Great for a last minute meal.  I doubled the honey, we like sweet salmon.  It turned out wonderfully!

AMAZING!  The salmon was moist and delicious and was complimented nicely by this flavorful dijon mixture.  I didn't add the melted butter (to cut out calories) and it was still superb.  My fiance loved it as well!

This was a wonderful recipe.  I thought the different flavors went well together.  It wasn't too much mustard and the nuts gave it a nice crust.  We served it with wild rice and Lemon-thyme green beans.

The best thing about this recipe is that it is so easy to double or triple if you are feedinf salmon to a crowd.  I fed 13, using 5 lb salmon, and it was awesome!  I think next time I will try fresh bread crumbs rather than the kind in the box, and crank maybe broil it a minute to get them crunchy.  Love this marinade!!!!

I made this dish for a dinner party and it turned out wonderfully.  Some of my guests wasn't so big on salmon so I decided to try it on chicken as well.  The flavor was amazing on the chicken.  I received many compliments with on this dish.

This is a recipe that is versatile enough to have on a week night after work or for company. It is one of the first recipes I made from allrecipes.com and I continue to return to it time and again. I generally use salmon steaks and make fresh bread crumbs (any extra I keep on hand in the freezer). Sometimes I use the parsley, but just as often I don't. In 2001, I was a celebrity cook at a local restaurant, and this is the recipe I made - it was a hit with the customers, and I had a blast making it. Thanks Arnie for your recipe - it's  such a family favourite  that when my son comes home for a visit, more often than not this is one recipe he asks for.

Very easy, quick and got rave reviews from everyone.  I would agree w/ one reviewer that it could benefit from adding basil, oregano and garlic.  Also it stuck like crazy to the pan so make sure to spray the pan w/ cooking spray prior to baking.

Im sorry to spoil all the reviews, but I did not care for this rec. It wasnt what I expected. Mustard-honey glaze wasnt tasted at all and I felt like there was too much of pecan-crumb topping. I would recommend to let salmon marinate in mustard-honey glaze before baking. However probably will not use this rec again.

My new favorite salmon recipe! Thanks so much!! The only modification I made was that I made extra sauce to heat up and pour on top of the fish before serving.  My husband asked if I would make this regularly - wow!

This dish came out delicious.  I made this for a dinner party, and I usually don't cook (being a bachelor), but it was simple to make.     However, I left out the pecans.  The Dijon mustard and bread crumbs give a great tangy and almost smoked taste.   Also, I know the recipe only states, "lemon, for garnish," but if you place a very thin lemon slice on each filet, they look almost professional/catered.  I even had a guest ask me where I bought the salmon dish from.

This is an outstanding dish that is simple to make and almost impossible to mess up.  Also, once you've purchased the ingredients for the first batch, you'll be mostly set to make much more while only needing to pick up more salmon.  I'd highly recommend making this with the cashew asparagus that you can find using the 'related dish' search feature.

The recipe was so simple to make as well as quick to bake. 
I made the dish for my friends and they all asked for the recipe afterwards.
I will definitely make it again, possibly for my whole family this time.

Made it 2 nights ago and family loved it.  Left out the pecans, just a preference but wish I would have put a thicker layer of breadcrumb mixture on top.  Will defintely make it again.

This is good for the work week-fast and tasty. You can leave out the ritzier bits-the nuts and the parsley-and still have a darn good piece of fish.

Great recipe! I made this evening and it came out great. I use honey mustard instead of dijon mustard. And I used only 1 tbsp. of honey instead of 
1 1/2 tbsp. And for the bread crumb topping, I use pine nuts instead of pecans. Awesome flavor and so easy to make. Yummy!

This was delicious and so quick and easy to make.  I didnt have breadcrumbs so I used crushed Ritz crackers instead. I omitted the pecans because of a food allergy. My husband, 3 year old and I all loved this. If you dont like honey mustard type of things, this is not for you!

I thought this salmon dish was very yummy. The flavor and texture was a perfect blend.   I like things a bit spicy so I used spicy dijon mustard instead.  Either way delicious!!!!

I was a little scared to try this one because I hate mustard, but I had to find something else to do with my salmon!  Well, I was very glad I did.  I tend to like slightly sweet sauces on my salmon and the honey added just the right sweetness.  And the mustard didn't bother me at all!  Oh and the topping turned out nice and crusty.

Made this for dinner last night....outstanding.  Slightly sweet because of the hiney, yet tangy from the dijon.  Excellent change of pace from the grilled salmon I normally make.  The only changes I made were to season the filets with salt & pepper prior to adding the mustard/honey mixture, & I added a little olive oil to the breadcrumb mixture because I wanted it to get brown and crispy. Thanks for the great recipe.

A simple way to prepare salmon. I left out the pecans the second time I made this dish. I also serve the leftover honey-mustard sauce (warmed) with the salmon.

Guests commented on how healthy this dish felt. The salmon turned out nice and moist, although I wished it was more flavorful. I would make this again, although maybe would thicken the crust or marinate the salmon.

I got rave reviews from my family on this recipe. I used Grey Poupon Dijon mustard and the flavor was complementary with the salmon without overpowering it. The crust that goes with this recipe is also outstanding. Definitely a recipe I'm keeping.

Most of the flavors were not strong enough. The only flavor that stood out was the honey. Personally I do not like sweet salmon. Would probably be better with a stronger ingredient to pair with the honey than the dijon mustard.

I love this recipe!  I have made it many, many times.  I always cut it in 1/2 since it is just my husband and I.  I use fat-free butter, dried parsley and don't include the pecans.

AMAZING!  Unbelievably delicious!  I got such rave reviews on this, that I felt like a gourmet chef!  I made it with orginal grey poupon, and served it with steamed broccoli and cous cous! I, too, used the panko bread crumbs for a little extra crunch. Big, huge, hit!  I wish there were leftovers to eat today. *sigh*

OMG!!!  This is the world's BEST Salmon recipe.  It is VERY easy to make and I felt like a gourmet chef serving it.  My only change was to use panko breadcrumbs and add a squeeze of lime before baking.  Yummy!!

I really enjoyed this!  I wasn't sure I would, because I've tried another dijon salmon from this site and didn't like it very much.  This one is very, very good though.  I love the honey and pecans.  At first it almost seemed too sweet but mellowed out as I ate.  I cut down on the butter by one TBS. but then added a splash of olive oil because I feared the mustard would be too strong.  I also used fresh basil instead of parsley.  This was done very fast!  Was done under 15 minutes in the oven.  Served with steamed broccoli and a whole-wheat baguette.

This was the best salmon we have ever had. No leftovers between the 3 of us and it has already been requested for dinner next week

I guess I don't know why I am adding to over 700 reviews, but I had to.  This is THE best oven recipe for salmon I've ever eaten.  BUT, in June, get the Copper River Salmon.  Buy a bunch, shrink wrap it and enjoy it for the year. Hey, don't miss the darkened sauce that runs off the salmon. Those "darkened bits" are superb! This and the Fire Cracker Salmon for the grill on this site are out of this world. I surely thank "real cooks" (I read, therefore I can cook) for recipes that make me look good. You are the best!

I thought this was too sweet, and I guess in my mind, "sweet" and "fish" are 2 flavors that don't mesh well. I was really unimpressed. Yes, it's an easy recipe to make, but the outcome is a bit dodgy.  At least I didn't waste a lot of time working on this because my boyfriend and I couldn't really eat it.

Tastiest salmon ever. I didn't change a thing. I want to try this with other fish, too.  Maybe grouper.   Thanks for a really delicious recipe.

I don't like mustard or pecans, but this recipe is soooo good.  And people who do like those 2 ingredients usually say it's one of the best meals they've ever had.  Strongly recommended.

Really enjoyed the chopped pecans (I used a little over 1/2 cup and just a little bit of breadcrumbs), made for a nice, nutty complement to the salmon. I guess I was hoping for more of the honey-dijon sauce flavor to come through -- it was very faint, and I slathered it on pretty well. Maybe next time I'll leave the sauce on longer or use a sesame-miso sauce instead. Decent, not amazing.

Great new way to make salmon.  However, I could hardly taste the dijon/honey mixture.  Next time I will put it on heavier even though the recipe says to brush it on lightly.  For my kids, I drizzled honey on the finished salmon on their plate to sweeten it up and they loved it.

I didn't like this at all!  Like a lot of other reviewers I too am wondering how this got such a high rating.  I guess it's just personal taste.  I usually like my salmon with a maple glaze or BBQ'd with some lemon but I thought I'd try to mix it up a bit and try something new.  We ended up scraping all the topping off and adding a toasted sesame dressing to save it.  I will not be making again.

So good! I didn't garnish either, like another reviewer, and it was still amazing, even the next day. I only had dried parsley, which worked fine. I had salmon steaks instead of filets, so I only ended up using about three quarters of the sauce and topping, but it was great as a thick layer on top. I crushed the pecans with a rolling pin. Don't omit these, if possible - they give it such a nice texture!

I will have to say this recipe deserved a triple WOW!!!  My niece, who doesn't like ANYTHING actually liked this dish.  My daughter and I truly enjoyed this recipe and I can guarantee that we will be making it again.  I did substitute the dijon mustard for honey dijon.  Also, I did not put a lot of bread crumbs on the salmon.  Just a few crumbles on each piece.  With the extra honey sauce I poured that back over the area where the bread crumbs were sprinkled.  My daughter and I were both leery on what this would taste like because neither one of us are mustard fans.  But this meal was AWESOME and something she and I will both consider a family favorite!

My husband, who really dislikes fish, told me to add this to my permanent recipe file.  I wrapped it in foil, topped it with coconut/pecans/panko crumbs for the last 10 minutes,heated the remaining marinade to use as a sauce, and it was delicious!

This was delicious! 

I halved everything as it was only for my husband and myself and it worked perfectly (reduced servings); I couldn't find pecans, so used walnuts instead; followed the suggestions of others and baked it covered for 7 minutes, before putting the breadcrumbs on top and baking uncovered for the remaining time. Only thing was that it was a little sweet for us (although that's just a personal preference) and would cut down the honey next time.

This was good, although I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I skipped the bread crumbs and pecans and just topped the salmon with the dijon mixture and baked it (putting bread crumbs on salmon sounded sort of weird to me). The dijon mixture alone was great. I had some leftover and it even made a good salad dressing. I'd definitely make this again and might try it with the bread crumbs and pecans on chicken.

This is a very simple yet flavorful recipe.  I went a little light on the sauce because someone in their review said they overdid it and it ruined it for them.  But, I think I should have just lathered it on because the sauce was good.  This is a recipe that will impress guests too!

This recipe has potential. I was looking for stronger flavor. Next time I will use more mustard mixture. Recipe states put on salmon lightly, needs more mustard flavor.  Definately salt and pepper before putting on pecan/bread crumb mixture.  Pecan/Bread crumb mixture not soggy at all.  Bake covered for 1/2 cooking time, then uncover to get pecan mixture crunchy.  Will try again with some adjustments.

Very yummy! Though i did change it a bit. I thought the recipe called for alittle too much oil. I cut it down just a bit so the sauce wasn't as runny. It was a little on the sweet side, so i would suggest using less honey.

AMAZING! I followed some of the advice on here and I didn't use the parsley or the bread crumbs.  All i did was rinse the salmon then put it on the baking sheet.  i spread the mustard mix on both sides and sprinkled the top with pecans and baked for about 20 mins.  
EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!!

What a great dish!  I live in AK so I'm always looking for easy and tasty salmon dishes.  Salt and peppered the filets, put a thick layer of the sauce on the top and bottom and put on extra pecan topping (omitted the breadcrumbs like some suggested) and it turned out great! The topping was crunchy and the salmon was moist...baking fish in silicone bakeware, if you haven't tried it, also keeps you from "drying" out your fish dishes.

Wow! I absolutely love this recipe. I have never been a big fan of salmon, but since finding this recipe I have been eating it regularly.
However, I did replace the butter with about a tablespoon of olive oil, and it still tasted great.
I've also used the same recipe with cod, but replaced the parsley with a bit of dill. It was fantastic!

My family really liked this recipe.  I am rating this by their attitude as I am not a fish eater.  I did however, love how easy this recipe was.  I definitely will be making this recipe again and again!

I prepared this recipe as directed, using some excellent Alaskan Copper River Red Salmon, with fairly lackluster results.  The dijon sauce didn't have quite enough zing for my taste and the crunchy topping fell flat -- it turned out kind of mushy and bland overall.  I don't think I'll make this dish again.

This was AWESOME!  I improvised a little since I didn't have the breadcrumb mixture ingredients.  I used brown sugar, butter, dijon mustard, and a little Worchestire sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  I am giving it to my coworker right now!  Thanks Arnie.

Easy and delicious way to bake salmon. I used "Hot and Sweet" mustard (from Trader Joe's) and omitted the bread crumbs as I'm trying to stay away from white flour. The chopped pecans and fresh parsley added a nice crunch to the salmon...my husband was impressed and said it looked like a "gourmet" meal.

The honey made this too sweet for our tastes. The breadcrumb/ pecan was a nice touch, but the honey was too much.

Excellent and easy to make! I didn't use pecans and it was still great. In the future I would use a little less bread crumbs to make it more of a crust on top. Will definitely make again!

What can I say, wow YUMMAY.  We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with wild sockeye salmon which was very thick so cooked it about 15 mins in a convection oven at 400 degrees. Served it with some angel hair pasta with olive oil and parmesan cheese. Will definitely make again.

This dish is very easy and quick to prepare and cook.  The crumb topping added a crunchy, nutty flavor.  I used the leftover dijon sauce as a dipping sauce for the cooked salmon.  I can't wait to try this recipe on chicken!

This was so delicious!  We used a whole piece of salmon instead of fillets, but other than that we followed the recipe.  We didn't lightly coat the salmon with the mustard sauce, we laid it on thick and it was SO GOOD!  I have never really liked fish, but am pregnant and needed to get some salmon into my diet, and this was the perfect dish.  I can't say enough about it -- so good.

Nope...not for me, way to fishy. I prefer my salmon marinated to reduce the fishy taste. The only reason I gave it three stars is my husband liked it. My kids ate cereal instead.

This was really good! I didn't have dry bread crumbs on hand, so I chopped a slice of whole wheat bread in my mini Cuisinart instead. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used 1 tsp dried parsley. I think it would have been better had I been able to follow the recipe exactly, but this is definitely a winner! I will serve it many times again.

This recipe was way good! I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I used walnuts. I could definitely make this once a week. Very worthy of a fine restaurant. Man that was good!!! I think I'll have seconds.

This was the first time I ever cooked a real meal for friends and it was a success! At first I was worried because I had never cooked fish before, but this recipe is so easy and foolproof. I followed the recipe exactly and the salmon turned out wonderfully. It certainly impressed all my friends!

An excellent variation on baked salad.  I loved the combination flavors, and it was so easy!  I will definitely make this again.

This is really wonderful!!  I butterflied the salmon and marinated during the day with just honey & mustard.  When it was time to cook I made a new batch of just honey & mustard to recoat.  I did melt a little butter to drizzle on top when it was ready to be baked.  YUM

One of the best salmon dinners we've ever had. Fabulous. My husband loved it, my kids loved it, I loved it. Wouldn't change a thing.

It was a big hit and easy to make, especially for someone who lacks any kind of kitchen sense (me).  Based on some of the suggestions: 1)I did not use the pecans, 2)I marinated the salmon in the sauce for 20 mins, 3) and I didn't add the bread crumb until the last 5 minutes before it was done baking.  I will definitely be making this again!

I was really disappointed in this recipe. I would prefer my regular grilled salmon over this baked one any day. Since the salmon wasn't marinated, it had a bit of a fishy taste and the crumb mixture got a bit soggy tasting. It was ok but I don't think I'll make it this way again

I cannot stand fish of any kind, but my new husband needs it in his diet.  I tried this because of all the great ratings - they were all correct!  It's REALLY good!  Now if only I could find other fish recipes this fantastic, I might eat seafood more often!  (It does make a LOT of marinade, but that's okay.)

Very good! Our filets were about 2 inches thick in parts, so the suggested cooking times were not quite sufficient. The insides were a little undercooked. I suggest perhaps 15-18 minutes if you have a thicker cut. Excellent flavor though -- I will definitely make this again soon.

This was ok, but probably won't make again.  However, I had substituted talapia for salmon (because we don't eat salmon).  We just didn't rave about it enough in this house.  But, it was VERY easy to make!  So, I think it's worth a shot for anyone!

Made this for Company. Only change was I added two thin slices of lemon on each filet.
Followed cooking instructions to the second. Great taste no after fish taste. Enjoy.

We enjoyed this salmon recipe.  I love the taste of salmon so next time I'll only coat the salmon lightly with the mustard.  It was a little overpowering - but still good!

Incredible!  My father (a big salmon fan) said that this was the best salmon he'd ever eaten, and decided to call it "Pretty Salmon" because it comes out looking _gorgeous_.  I subsituted chopped hazelnuts for the pecans.

This Salmon Recipe is the best way I've found to prepare Salmon. I purchased one big salmon fillet and baked it all at once so I ended up baking it for about 45 min but it is wonderful. My girlfriend and I love it and everyone I make it for absolutely love it...even the ones that don't like fish

This was really good. I ate the whole fillet and I don't even like fish. I would have given it 5 stars except that there wasn't enough sauce. Next time I will double it.

I like to let the salmon marinate in the dijon butter sauce for 15-30 minutes.  I put the pecans in the food processor to make it the same size as the bread crumbs.  It's such an easy recipe and always taste fantastic.  I serve it with a mushroom risotto.  Yum.

This recipe is exceedingly easy to prepare.  It is delicious, full of character.
It is a nice way to deviate from the norm without stressing your budget or your evening.
It is also a relaitvely attractive dish, and so would be good for entertaining.

Delicious!  I served to guests and they were very impressed.  I would put plenty of the honey mustard sauce on for the best flavor.  I also used some of this same topping on chicken and it worked great as well!

This was awesome- and I'm not even a salmon lover!  I used the freshest Chinook salmon (we live in Seattle)and it didn't taste fishy at all. I left out the pecans because I didn't have them and it was still great.

This recipe rocked!  I usually don't try new recipes for guests, but I tried this for our friends and it came out great.  Then I tried it out on my mom and my grandma.  Grandma kept saying "Where did she learn how to cook" for days.

Good topping but didn't like the rest-maybe it was us.  We are not big fish eaters.

Very easy and tasty.  The recipe produced a lot of the sauce and coating, so instead of drizzled and sprinkled, it was drenched and coated.  That was OK since it tasted great.

wonderful recipe, the only one I use. I dip the salmon filets in the honey mustard instead of lightly coating and serve them with lemon wedges this recipe is very good the salmon stays moist and it is a beautiful dish to serve to guest.

Skip the butter next time - don't know if it's necessary. This was really delicious. I was a bit worried about pairing salmon with mustard, but it was really delicious. I really enjoyed the pecan and breadcrumb topping with the salmon. I'll make this many many times in the future.

i used to order salmon in the restaraunts when my husband and i would enjoy fine dining, but i have to say, since i have started preparing this at home...i sware i am disappointed in the restaraunts.  It is WONDERFUL, one of david's favorites, however i do only use 1 tablespoon of butter and i actually use smart balance to avoid the hydrogenated oils and in all honesty, its better with less butter.

I thought this recipe was just "okay".  My husband loved it though.  He thought it was a keeper.  Next time he makes it he said he'd go a bit lighter on the mustard.

I was going to prepare this a few weeks ago for a dinner party. After reading a few negative reviews I was afraid to test it on company. Last night I made it for my family. I made 2 changes. I seasoned the filets with Old Bay seasoning and I eliminated the nuts. We loved it. Simple, and tasty. The honey and mustard were not overpowering as I expected.
Next dinner party I will debut this one.

I search in for new ways to prepare foods other than the norm. I have made this dish at least a dozen times. I just had to write a review. This salmon recipe is great. My daughter had me fix it two nights in row and each time I was asked is there an more of the honey mustard base. So I give each person a small side dish for dipping. It an elegant dish. It's perfect for inviting guest over and so easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It is a keeper!!!

YUMMY!!  The pecans are fabulous with salmon.  The dijon flavour is mild enough that it doesn't over-power the salmon.  Loved it!

Excellent weeknight recipe that can double for a wonderful dish for guests as well.  I omitted the nuts and used grainy dijon mustard.  I was also very generous with the honey and mustard.  Can be done to taste. Absolutely a keeper.

Great recipe, but can get a bit mushy in the oven during the baking.  I used less butter the next time I made it, and that was helpful.  Be sure to use a spicy mustard mix - one time I accidentally used a dijon (Grey Poupon, if you please!) and it was too mayonaise-y for my taste

It was ok.  I'm not sure salmon and mustard go well together.  Or salmon and pecans, for that matter.  To each his own.  :)

Quick to assemble and cook, simple preparation with off the shelf ingrediants.  My family hates fish and particularly Salmon but this was a hit.  It looked atractive - good enough for company- and everyone enjoyed it.  Thank you for the recipe.  THIS IS a KEEPER.

This was our first time trying salmon & this recipe was very very good. I would probably decrease the mustard next time (personal preference) and cut the whole thing in half since there was way more "sauce" then was needed for brushing 1lb of fish. Would definately make it again!

How can something this simple be so delicious?  When my extremely picky 11 year old raved about this salmon recipe to her Godmother, I knew it was something special!  I may never make salmon another way.

This was really easy to make!  I used honey dijon mustard and less than half the recommended amt of honey and it still came out great!  We used the left over honey mustard as sauce over the salmon and it was delicious!

Nothing special. Bread crumbs weren't a good idea, and I'd rather save pecans for something really good. But it's hard to spoil a salmon anyway.

This was great! I used a large "slab" of salmon from Costco so the cooking time had to be extended but it was awesome when it was finally done!

This is one of the best salmon recipes I have come across, the coating of honey mustard sauce then the topping was a prefect compliment to the salmon.  My oldest who doesn't even like salmon said it was pretty good.  My middle child loved it but still took of the topping.  My friend even came over during dinner and asked if he could have a bite and loved it,  he is not a big salmon lover either. I will make this more often. no question.

Fish normally scares me off,  but this was a really great dish! I added more of everything (so I couldn't taste the fish!) ;) Also,  it took a little longer to cook.  The first time I made it was a little underdone,  but now I think I have it! I will definitely be making this again.

Salmon came out soooo tender and juicy!  Flaked right off of the skin.  The dijon flavor was light and mildly sweet- an excellent complement to the salmon.  I skipped out on the pecans and made my own breadcrumbs seasoned with thyme, basil, and oregano.  Topped with a sprinkle of salt and pepper and garnished with fresh cilantro and lemon...a masterpiece!  Try drizzling a little of the extra dijon sauce on the plate for added effect.  5 stars!!!

This was very tasty and quick to prepare.  I substituted perch and it turned out fine.  My husband doesn't normally like white fish and he ate the perch.  Next time we have salmon, I will prepare it this way.  Yummy.

Thanks for the Great Recipe

As good as or better than any salmon I've had in a restaurant, and certainly the best recipe I've ever made. Great blend of flavors. I was a little dubious about the honey, but it's wonderful. The pecans are the perfect touch to make it extra special. Even my husband, not a big fish lover, loved this. A good recipe to serve guests.

Very simple, quick and easy. Not too much seasoning is added to the salmon so that the true taste of the fish stands out. A wonderful recipie, will make over and over again.

This is a real family pleaser!  I substituted sesame seeds for the chopped pecans and it really added a new twist to the flavor. Try it with Mediteranean Curry Cous-Cous.

I personally loved this recipe. I had two servings. My husband and son did not like it as much as I did, but I think it is because I used Grey Poupon mustard (which I recommend). Next time I will use plain old yellow mustard to please them. I put a bit of chopped garlic in the sauce. I also had to forgo the pecans, as my son couldn't find them when I sent him to the store. It was still delicious and fancy enough to impress company.

It was OK, the flavors didn’t really ring through for me.  But it was fine.  Everybody ate it, we were full.  I paired it with Asiago mashed potatoes and sesame sautéed green beans, which gave a little help to the plate.

It tasted very smooth that I couldn't taste an excess of the salmon (which I liked). I would use less of the honey/dijon/butter mixture though because it was too much on the salmon or spread it on 5 pieces of 4 oz fillets. maybe even mix the two mixtures together and spread them at the same time so it becomes more of a crust.
Way to think outside the box for this inventive recipe!

I am not a salmon lover at all but this is the best salmon recipe I've ever tasted!  Made the recipe exactly as written and I loved every bite. We had it with Asparagus and  hollandaise sauce so I tried the sauce on some of the salmon and it was even more delicious!  Yay salmon!

Really nice change from my usual dill & butter.  Didn't have the nuts on hand, but did the rest of the recipe as listed.  Husband & kid loved it too. Kept the salmon moist.

It was quite easy to make and I had all the ingredients on hand. I was hoping the pecan and bread crumbs would get a little  crunchier, so I would maybe broil a minute at the end, but it had great flavor.

Great flavor! I would make it again. Only 4 starts because the flavor didn't come through enough on the thicker parts and the sides were dry. Maybe marinate in the honey mustard?

It was my night to cook and being a beekeeper I always look for recipes with honey. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out amazing. The salmon took much longer than 12-15 to bake (almost 30 minutes )Will definitely make this again    Served with asparagus.

I don’t like nuts in my food so I omitted this ingredient. I also didn’t have regular Dijon mustard so I used the course Dijon mustard. The steps were easy to follow and simple to cook but it tasted AMAZING! I would absolutely make this again.

It turned out great.!!! Since my girlfriend doesn’t like the “fishy” taste of salmon I used Dijon honey mustard && added about a 1/4 more agave(instead of honey) && she loved it. She liked that the sweetness masked the “fishy” taste && we both liked the pecans on top. I will definitely make this again.!!!!!

Boyfriend said that it was the "best salmon he's ever had"! Loved it, I'll just make sure to mix the bread crumbs and parsley and nuts better next time. I also used walnuts instead of pecans and it still turned out good!

Awesome recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly (which I usually don't) and it came out perfectly.  Definitely high-end restaurant-worthy and there is no need to alter it.  Use good raw honey and not the modified corn syrup found on the bottom shelf of grocery stores.

Made this and followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using the lemon at the end. I don't feel it needed it anyway. It was a very tasty way to prepare salmon and tastes like something you would get at a restaurant. I recommend using parchment paper under it to bake otherwise your pan will be a mess. I used frozen fillets and just baked it longer, still turned out great and moist. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious.  Next time I’ll try a little less bread crumbs. Topping is a little dry.

I added some garlic powder and onion powder.  Took 45 min for prep and cook along with regular rice.  About 10 min to devour.

This is one of our go to salmon recipes. It is so easy, and so flavorful. Edit it to your liking, or if making a smaller portions, the recipe is easy to adjust! The butter keeps the salmon so moist.

This recipe is perfect! Easy and delicious. It made way more than I needed and I had 8 fillets. But we liked the taste and didnt mind the extra topping.

Very good on fresh caught Alaskan salmon! I did not think I needed the remainder Dijon mixture due to coating the fish heavily but a drizzle over top would’ve set this dish! Fabulously easy to mix up for a simple fish dinner.

Except for the fact that I took one reviewer's advice and added some cayenne pepper to the topping, I made this dish exactly as described. And it was absolutely excellent! A couple of people in our dinner party professed that they didn't care for salmon -- but they cared a lot for this! One of them said that it was the kind of dish you'd pay very good money for in a restaurant, and it's true. But the ingredients only tasted expensive! This is a real keeper.

Yes ! This was my first time making this recipe and MY FAMILY LOVED IT !!!!! I'm a pecan fanatic BUT I was skeptical about  adding it to the salmon crust ….. turns out it was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I had to cook more for the picky eater son and his loud friends. Of course I was happy to see them eat  something other than hot dogs. I served the salmon with oven baked French fries BUT I definitely need some suggestions on what side dishes would match with an awarded winning salmon recipe. Great recipe that needs no modifications.

Scrumptious and so easy!!! I doubled the salmon so doubled the garnish - was a bit too much - 1 1/2 times the garnish was enough.

Truly enjoy this dish. I didn't have any Dijon mustard used spicy deli mustard with white wine and horseradish Olive oil instead of  butter, included the honey.  Also seasoned my fish with a seafood seasoning. Its good to improvise. Recipes are guidelines, I always add my twist.

So good! I ended up skinning the fish and coating the whole thing in panko bread crumbs. Put it in the oven for 20 min at 400 and then put it on the skillet to crisp up the breading! My husband and I didn't talk during dinner because we were scarfing the food!

Copied recipe exactly this 1st time.  Although we liked the overall results, I think it needed a little more "punch" of flavor for our liking.  After reading some of the reviews I think I will add a dash of cayenne next time...but there with definitely be a NEXT TIME!

Definitely a people-pleaser!  My modifications were: I used walnuts instead of pecans, I also substituted panko breadcrumbs for the regular variety, and I cooked this on the grill on top of a sheet of foil.  It comes right off leaving the skin behind.

I guess you need an acquired taste for this. The nut mixture was a nice addition but I didn't care for the mustard sauce. I wouldn't make  this way again.

I just made this and it turned out wonderfully good. I will definitely be making this again, but instead of lightly spreading the mixtures I’m going to add a little more. I also did it with Panco since I forgot to get the breadcrumbs lol! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I didn't have pecans so I toasted some walnuts and used those instead. I forgot to use breadcrumbs but it didn't seem to suffer. The taste was nice and different. But as other people have said, the topping overpowers the fish. Perhaps a fine layer of the topping mixture for more of a balance of flavors.  We like the taste of salmon, but I decided to make this anyway for a change and I'm glad I did.

I made this about 5 times now. I left off the bread crumbs and I liked it much better.  I also used Paul Neuman's honey mustard salad dressing one time with a side of yoghurt and honey mustard salad dressing sauce (1/2 & 1/2).  I also used Honey cup mustard with orange blossom honey and a clove of crushed garlic.  For the most part, I did not use the topping mixture after the first time.  Baked until al dente'.

I've eaten a lot of salmon in my life, my friends. A LOT. Prepared many different ways. This is, hands down, the best salmon I have EVER eaten and I refuse to prepare salmon any other way ever since I discovered this amazing recipe. It is SO GOOD. 

I don't lightly brush the mustard/honey/butter, though, I smear the whole bowl on the salmon and cover it in breadcrumbs and pecans when I have them. 

With or without pecans, it's still incredible. I'm using this recipe for the fifth time tonight and I can't wait. Yum yum!!

I loved this recipe!! Let’s just say so did my boyfriend and brother because they both had 2 pieces each! We can eat salmon every week. It’s very tasty with a lot of flavor. I would definitely recommend to taste the honey Dijon mixture before putting it on the salmon. I had to add a little bit more honey. Also I broiled the salmon for 7 minutes on the bottom rack. It just melts in your mouth!

I felt that the filets were a little too small.  Next time I will be getting twice as much salmon, and making 6 filets out of the 2lbs.  I also didn't "lightly brush" the salmon with the topping, I thoroughly coated it.  I think this helped with the flavors to pop through quite a bit more (for those of you complaining that it was bland).  Other than that, it was delicious.  My kids loved it too!

I rated this a 5 even though I made a few changes.  I didn't use bread crumbs (gave bread up for lent), Didn't have pecans I used about 1 tsp . of Italian seasoning on a 1 lb.  fillet. placed skin side down. Then I drizzled Honey and Dejon mustard over top  (It also ran little bit down sides).  Put it on low broil for 10 min. Removed from oven,turned fillet over, removed skin,  and drizzled more honey and mustard on, then back under low broiler for 7 min.  This was the best salmon I ever had.   I will make this again and again. After lent I will use bread crumbs and pecans.

Whole family loved it.  Had to cook a little longer since I had thick fillets, but was careful not to overcook.  It turned out super moist and melt-in-your-mouth good, and the mustard gives it a wonderful 'tang.'

I made this exactly as written for a dinner party and everyone loved it! Even those who said they didn’t like salmon! The topping does make a generous amount and is very rich. Next time I would broil the top to get it a little brown and crispy. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out well. The crumb topping was a bit dry. I think a little less would have worked better. Otherwise very good.

Great simple recipe! 

I replaced the breadcrumbs with panko. It gives the salmon a slightly crispier touch. 

The mustard mixture nets more than you need, so you can use it as a sauce to add on later.

Super easy and my husband loved it!  I used Olive Garden croutons instead of bread crumbs and it was absolutely fantastic and best part it was quick!  Served it over baked Cajun asparagus and the seasoning melded perfectly!  Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was delicious and so easy! The only change I made was using 2 T of butter instead of 4. Very moist cooking at the higher temperature for a shorter length of time.

Well. Saw another review and thought the exact same thing. Bland which surprised me. I love salmon and have made a lot of other recipes but this was a huge disappointment. I wouldn’t make it again. Wanted to like it but really didn’t.

Recipe is well written and turn out great if you simply follow the recommendations.   I like to substitute whole grain mustard for some of the Dijon, it adds additional texture and flavor that we prefer.

I made this for a group of 6. I know the recipe says makes 4 but by adding just 1 tablespoon more of Dijon and a 2 full teaspoons of honesty instead of 1 and 1/2, and I had requests for more!! Amazing taste, a definite make again!

My family loved this dish! The only change I made was substituting cashews for the pecans because that is what I had on hand.  I was a little concerned because some reviews said it was "bland"  but it was far from bland! Thank you for the great recipe!

I did not have any pecans so I used crushed almond instead and it was delicious!  My husband absolutely loved it!  This will be a staple around out house now! I followed  the rest of the recipe as it was except the nuts.

I made this tonight. It was very good. There are a few negative reviews but notice how they skipped or substituted something. Make it right and it’s really good.

I don't eat fish, so this rating is really my husband's.  I did cook it though, something I don't often prepare, so I thought I'd share a few thoughts.  The only thing I did differently was the size of the salmon fillet.  I purchased  a half-pound (8oz) filet, which was a good portion size for one serving.  If I'd cut it in half (2  servings) the cooking time given would probably have been perfect.  I cooked it 12 minutes and it was cooked on the ends but not the thicker middle.  I put it back in for an additional 4 minutes and it was perfect.
For the sauce - I cut all measurements in half which game me more than enough for the fillet.  For myself, a person with a strong aversion to cooking fish, this was actually a pleasure to prepare.  Simple, no heavy fish smell, and my husband loved it.  So a heartfelt  "Thank you" to Esmee.  I will be making this again and again!

I loved it!!! I did not have any Dijon mustard so I used regular mustard. I did double the sauce so I could cook my vegetables with the salmon. All I had was Brussel sprouts so I gave it a try. To my surprise they were the best Brussel sprouts I have ever had. Here is a tip: Try the sauce before putting it on the salmon!!! Adjust to your taste.

This was the best salmon I have ever tasted! The sauce was DELICIOUS. I didn't have pecans, so I just used some bread crumbs, but it was still fantastic. The bread crumbs were still a little soggy at the end of 12 minutes, so I cooked on the top rack for 2-3 minutes, and it was perfect! Will make again!

I made a couple of changes onlybut otherwise stuck to the original recipe. Changes were: after rinsing and patting dry my salmon, I very lightly brushed with oil and seasoned with garlic salt. I didn’t make any changes to the honey and Dijon mixture but I didn’t have any bread crumbs so I chopped up pretzels and used that instead. I also didn’t have any fresh herbs on hand so I just used dried. Turned out great!!

This was so tasty!  I had 1 lb of salmon and thought that both the mustard mixture and the bread crumb mixture made too much for a pound of salmon.  Next time I will halve both mixtures.  Will definitely make this again.

Our favorite salmon recipe !  Loved, loved it.  We did use a spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon so it had a nice bite.   I wish we’d had just a smidge more sauce for the rice, but it was plenty without being greedy.

Absolutely delicious and simple recipe! I can't imagine anyone  giving this a low rating other than they had some bad fish...or a bit too much wine before! I did not have much pecans, so I did a mix of walnuts, almonds and pecans. I'll be trying this again next week with pecans only. I am very glad I tried this recipe.

The recipe is another good way to cook salmon but I will do some tweaking the next time to add a kick or some predominant flavor. It definitely was not objectionable, just a bit in the bland side for our taste buds.

Nice flavors. The salmon skin stuck to the bottom of the baking pan. Maybe put some parchment paper down or grease the pan a bit more.

This recipe had a decent flavor, but it overpowered the salmon quite a bit. I thought it was overly-tangy. It might be good for a kid who doesn’t want to eat fish.  Kinda defeats the point of buying a nice fresh fillet, though.

I only really tasted a tiny bit of the fish to make sure that it was done and I really enjoyed it from what I can tell. I meal prepped it for the week and I can't wait to eat it for lunch this week.

Made this to the letter and while the salmon was perfectly cooked and really moist, we felt there wasn’t much flavor. This was surprising as I thought the combo of mustard, honey and butter would add a lot of flavor, but it was lacking. On the upside my 2 year old son enjoyed it!

Loved the enhanced flavors; while allowing the richness of the salmon to shine. I kept the recipe true (always do first time) and found no need to change it!

My wife and I loved this recipe. We recommend not using too thick a salmon fillet, or it'll take a lot longer than the recipe says. Our fillets were three or four inches thick and took about 25 minutes, maybe a little longer.

Ok, so ladies don't tar and feather me for this, but I made this in a rush one morning before my morning coffee. Never make anything before your coffee.  I put everything in a bowl and mixed it up except for the salmon.  When I realized what I did it was too late.  I just put a little bit of the now spread down on the glass pie plate I was going to cook them in.  I then set the salmon on top of it, and added the rest around the salmon like a salmon coffin patting it down on the top and sides.   I covered it with plastic to cook later and refrigerated.  My husband said it was the best salmon I had prepared to date.  Next time I will try to get it right, but prepared the way I did it by accident it was amazing!

I made the recipe precisely as written. It was wonderful! Needed to cook a little longer though. I also slathered the entire filet instead of just the top with the mixture. I made it for a ladies dinner party and it got rave reviews!

This is a wonderful recipe. I halved the honey dijon mixture, as one reviewer suggested. I coated it pretty thick and still had some left, and I used Panko breadcrumbs. Yummy Yummy!!This will now be a regular at our house.

I have made this too many times to count and we love it!  Tonight I did not have plain Dijon mustard, only had honey Dijon.  I remembered the review that said it was to mustardy.  My thought was - well just cut back on the honey and use a little more mustard mix.  I must say it worked out fine!  Not saying I’ll do it again but if I have too I will.  When you don’t have what you need, it’s not the recipes fault it yours!

So good!!

Made a few changes :
-I don't like pecans, so I left those out
-I used 1.25 teaspoons of dried parsley instead of fresh
-I squeezed fresh lemon juice onto the fish before serving
-Another change I would make it broil the fish for a few minutes before serving so that the breadcrumbs crisp up.

Delicious and flavorful! Also quick and easy, which is always a plus. I substituted pecans for walnuts and still tasted awesome. Definitely would make again!

Another Great recipe for Salmon from AR!  This recipe compliments the fish greatly, I did use Parmesan Herb Panko as opposed to bread crumbs.Revised: Used Mesquite Honey for the wet wrap and this version used Italian Seasoned Panko Bread Crumbs ........ Dang this was good, and that wasnt just my opinion .... and that's a good thing!

This recipe is incredible. I followed it exactly and will be making it again. The four of us agreed that it was delicious and so easy to prepare. Crunchy, sweet, salty  with a smooth creamy salmon  layer.

Wow!  This was stellar!  I really would recommend this one.  I do not like the nuts for the recipe, so I did not use them.  Other than that the recipe was made as directed.  Make it!  You won't be disappointed.

I adjusted the recipe for 2 servings. It was very good. My salmon was barely an inch thick, and at 400 degrees It took about 20 minutes. Tasted great! I think will use a little butter in the bread crumbs because they were a little dry and didn't brown much.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I used crushed walnuts for the topping - and I did have honey so that was a help.  My husband raved about it - and my teen kids, too. Salmon is a rare treat at our house due to the cost, so I was relieved that this recipe made it even better. Highly recommend it.

This was so easy and so delicious. My whole family, including my kids 6 and 11, loved it. I did follow one person's recommendation and use only 1 tablespoon of honey.  I also opted not to use nuts, which it didn't seem to need in the end.  Definitely a nice and tasty change from the olive oil/salt and pepper/parsley recipe we usually use!

I found this recipe today for my wild salmon fillet and it was absolutely scrumptious!  The dijon with honey & butter was wonderful to keep the salmon from drying out while it baked and I used panko bread crumbs, chopped pecans and tarragon, fine sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  It is the best recipe to keep the salmon moist and it was so tender!  My hubby loved it!  I served it with baked zucchini fries (with panko, parmesan, salt and pepper and olive oil and served all with jasmine rice.  Awesome salmon dinner!!!

This was delicious. The only alteration to the original recipe was that in place of plain bread crumbs, I used a mixture of   panko bread crumbs with a bit of grated parmesan cheese and McCormick Perfect Pinch seasoning that I had leftover  from a previous recipe. Family members who usually don't like Salmon actually liked it and ate every last bite. Will make this again.

I really liked this recipe and made it without changes to the ingredients.  I did, however, season the salmon prior to applying the sauce.  I agree with many of the other reviews that you needn't be too stingy with the sauce!  Loved the pecans with the breadcrumbs.

A little too sweet for us.  We really like salmon, so probably will just go back to our regular recipe that highlights the flavor of the salmon.

I love the recipe. It enabled me to be able to eat, and enjoy, salmon. First time in over a decade since I last ate cooked salmon. I can eat sushi without any issue because it lacks the strong flavor. I am glad I tried the recipe.

My dinner party was a great success in large part because of this recipe. The prep is fast. One guest doesn’t eat fish, so I did a boneless, skinless chicken breast for her. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was to use dehydrated parsley, as I had that on hand. I will be making this again many times. Thanks!

This recipe is great! I can see how some might think it's bland but then you need to make it for your taste. I didn't measure anything, I just eyeballed it. I put fresh lemon juice in the wet mixture and olive oil instead of butter. The lemon gave it a nice kick. I didn't have parsley so I omitted that. All in all it was the best salmon recipe I've made!

I had rockfish, so used combo Mayo, honey and Dijon along with tarragon and topped with pecans and pinko crumbs.  I put tbsp olive oil on pan laid fish in and slathered mixture on.  I had to pour off watery liquid and put back in Toaster oven on lowest rack, and put the broiler on for few minutes to crisp up. My hubby LOVED it

I prepare this recipe without the wine, and marine for 15 minutes with the sauce half of the recipe and the other half I prepare it as the recipe said. the portion that I marine came out more aromatic and better taste.We also ate it the next day, I just added more cream, I recommend this recipe for the flavor and its presentation

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the T. and found the different flavors went very well together. This last time I made it I made a few slight changes to mellow the sweet of the honey out just a touch. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic to the mustard mixture and crumbled a toasted hamburger bun by hand rather than use traditional white or wheat bread crumbs. The slight flavor changes turned out better than expected.

The original recipe is excellent all on its own and well worth 5 stars.

I excluded pecans and substituted crushed graham crackers, because I didn’t have bread crumbs.  This turned out awesome!

Really a very good and easy recipe - the first thing I made for my 2018 meal prep resolution. I found that this recipe made a little bit extra topping, but that was fine. Served with baked yam and roasted broccoli and this was a great re-heated lunch all week!

Delicious. I'd like to try it with some Raye's Dundicott Hott mustard instead of the Dijon, but I've run out. Excellent recipe, thanks!

I can't imagine people not liking this recipe or saying it is bland.  IT IS DELICIOUS!  I did add some chopped fresh garlic but not necessary.  I also doubled the sauce to have some for dipping as another reviewer suggested.  I did run out of dijon doing that and used some Inglehoffer stone ground mustard and that worked great.  My husband is NOT a fan of salmon but I am trying to get him to eat it for health benefits and he said it is for sure a keeper.  My 16 year-old who normally is just okay with any kind of fish devoured it and loved the sauce.  Thank you for an excellent recipe.  For sure going in the "rotation!"

This is my go to  salmon recipe. I've made it several times and it always comes out great. I glaze the salmon with the honey/ Dijon mixture and then mix what is left over with the breadcrumbs and pecans to moisten the breadcrumbs and and it comes out delicious.

I made it exactly as the recipe for a Christmas party and was very disappointed. I used a large 2 pound fillet and it looked very nice . The topping was delicious but the taste didn’t extend to the fish . The fish was bland as if  I had put a plain salmon in the oven . Maybe if you use small fillets and put the honey mustard on both sides it would be better but I don’t think I will make it again .

This was absolutely delicious! I decided to make this because I have a pecan tree in my yard and thought I should put the free pecans to good use. This recipe was easy. I paired it with sides of rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. Thanks for submitting this recipe!

Excellent. Easy to make and very tasty. I had reservations about the combination of mustard, pecans and parsley, but it really compliments the subtle taste of the salmon.  Another new favourite in our home.

It's definitely easy to make. My wife loved it, me not so much. I didn't think it had that much flavor, but I used dried parsley as I didn't have fresh available. It was moist and will likely make it again when the day isn't conducive to grilling. My wife suggested it was a bit too sweet so I would cut back on the honey next time.

This is absolutely delicious!  It is definitely at the top of my list of recipes I have taken from the site.  We usually have it at least once a week.  It is so flavorful and moist.  The only changes I make are to use gluten free panko crumbs since my children both have celiac disease and I skip the pecans for ease but I'm sure they are wonderful on it!  Thank you Esmee.

Fabulous in every way! I used ritz crackers for bread crumbs and mustard powder because I had no dijon handy. Wrapping in foil made this melt in the mouth yum!

Great flavor and texture!  I add 2 finely minced garlic cloves to the honey mustard mixture.  I also added 2 teaspoons of garlic grapeseed oil to the bread crumb mixture so that it would hold and brown better...olive oil would be fine as well.  Served it over a kale-spinach mixture and used the drippings to wilt the greens.  Squeeze the lemons over it as a finishing taste. Delicious!

I made some minor changes. I didn't have dijon mustard but I had balsamic mustard and that was delicious. I used Kirkland's frozen fillets (Costco) which are 7 oz each so I followed the directions exactly for the two of us, using two fillets. I didn't have fresh parsley but Penzey's dried parsley is excellent. And I used panko bread crumbs, giving the coating a nice crunch. Hubby practically licked his plate. I served with plain green beans and plain red potato, avoiding my usual inclination to add stuff to the side dishes, since I realized there would be so much flavor in the fish. Good move! This will become a staple for us and for guests!

I have now made this several times, following the recipe exactly and making subtle changes. For my husband's diet, I deleted the honey and the butter and used less crumbs. Still absolutely delicious. Every time I've made this, it has been delicious. In short, it's the recipe that keeps on working. I wish I could give it ten stars! ETA: I highly recommend, on all recipes, using a probe to make sure the food is done the way you like it. Stick it in the piece you are most likely to eat, and no one will notice the hole it makes, and you are guaranteed to have it done perfectly every time!

This is delicious! I always swap out butter for oil for diet reasons so I bet its even better as is. I love anything simple and this nails it. Boyfriend doesn't even like fish but leaves nothing on his plate when I make this ;)

Made it exactly as written (which is rare) and the salmon came out moist and flavorful!  Not too sweet and a really nice change from the ginger/teriyaki marinade we often use.  This gets 5 starts also for easy of preparation and having all the ingredients on hand!

This is a great easy recipe and doesn't require a grill.  The only change I made was to add a bit of horseradish to the liquid mixture.  It is a keeper and my husband had thirds!

I also brushed the filets quite generously with the butter mixture. I lightly pressed down on the crumb topping and it really held in place. A definite addition to my recipe box.

This might be my favorite dish dish I've ever had. I didn't have time to go out and get the pecans so I made it without and it was just as great! I accidentally added an extra tablespoon of honey but I'm actually glad I did. I really enjoyed the sweet and tangy flavor combination.

I'm from Maryland where everything is better with Old Bay seasoning!  I gave the salmon a light sprinkling before glazing with the honey mustard. It gave the dish a great salty-sweet flavor.

It was eatable but I'm not sure I'll be making it again. I'm not really a salmon fan but I'm still hopeful to find a good recipe for it. The only change I made was no parsley. I do plan on trying this same technique with chicken to see if it was just the meat choice for me.

I love making this dish. I pull out this recipe when I'm trying to impress my company. It's very easy to put together and the taste is fantastic. Honey Mustard are one of my favourite combinations and pecans make it crunchy so it checks a lot of boxes for me. I've even made it with Spicy Dijon as well and its even better.

Really nice and easy recipe! Thank you for sharing. Based on available ingredients (too lazy for a store run :-)) made the following substitutes: honey~agave, bread crumbs~pretzel crumbs, Dijon~Gulden's mustard. Paired the salmon with grilled garlic asparagus and rice.

Had planned to grill out salmon but thunderstorm nixed that.   In a panic to find a simple recipe that I could fix in time for expected company, I tried this recipe.  Everyone loved it!  One guest said it was the best salmon he had ever eaten and two days later had his wife call me for the recipe.   My husband, who will eat salmon but is not crazy about it, said that he would love for me to fix it again soon.   I didn't have any parsley in the house, so had to omit it, but the dish was still delicious.  I had to use lightly salted cashews because I didn't have any pecans, and they gave it a delicious crunch.   I fixed it again the following week with the parsley and pecans and it was even better.  Definitely a keeper!

I used a dijon mustard with horseradish in it and local honey on a nice fresh piece of sockeye salmon. It was the best salmon I have ever made. Very tasty and very easy to make.

Delicious and i can't wait to make and enjoy this again. I didn't have dijon mustard but strangely had honey mustard so i just used 4 T of it. I didn't have pecans so i used almonds.

This turned out great and even my teenage girls liked it.  We all agreed that next time we would like a bit less honey (less sweet) but the texture was great with the nuts and we will definitely put it in our rotation once in a while as a nice change.

I did not enjoy this at all.  These flavors simply do not mix well with savory salmon in my opinion.

This is everybody's favourite salmon recipe. Sometimes I'll add cilantro and cayenne in there if you feel like adding a bit more flavor, but anyway you make it, this recipe is simply amazing.

It's really tasty! My boyfriend is not a big friend of salmon but he enjoyed this one very much. I took another reviewer's suggestion to remove the skin and dip all sides with bread crumbs. The pecans with bread crumbs,  and dijon mustard, butter with honey go so well together! Excellent recipe!

I followed the recipe closely except that I substituted pistachios for pecans since I had some in pantry. My husband really loved this recipe. The only things I would do differently are 1) omit the butter since salmon is already a fatty fish and doesn't need it 2) reduce the amount of honey since it was a bit too sweet for me.

Wow!  This was the best ever!  I doubled the recipe and used it to top four salmon filets and also three mahi mahi filets (to make sure we had enough for our guests).  It came out looking good, and even the kids said that it tasted good.  As a note, I used finely crushed Ritz crackers for the breadcrumbs (just what was available) which worked well.  We had this with the Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce, which bakes at the same temperature, just a few minutes less.  It's an excellent pairing, and makes the flow of dinner really easy.

Had to cook about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but it was well worth the wait.  Great taste, combined it with Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce and you have a killer meal.

I am amazed how certain people can call this recipe the "worst." Somebody needs to go back to charm school for putting that remark there! This IS a definite keeper! My kind of recipe with only a few ingredients that you probably have on hand. Didn't have the pecans, but will try with them next time. Thanks for the delicious salmon recipe!

Excellent. Follow this recipe as written and you will end up with a DELICIOUS salmon fillet (or perhaps cut back on the butter a tad - your arteries will thank you later). If you don't have fresh parsley on hand, dried works quite well, too. I'm definitely going to be making this again and again.

This was so good my two year gobbled it up and he hadn't eaten any fish since watching Dory and my wife told me how happy she was that I have now learned to make fish.  Thank you!!

I was skeptical, but it came out surprisingly well! It's a challenge getting the hubby to eat salmon since it's not his favorite, but he liked it! I made it exactly as the recipe stated. This one is a keeper.

Love this recipe!  My husbands favorite meal. I have made this many times and is very easy and quick to make. Always make with U.S.A. Wild caught Alaskan salmon and sautéed brussel sprouts-yum!  Pairs nicely with a glass of white Albariño wine or an IPA beer ??

This a great recipe. So so easy and perfect every time.
I so agree that it is not fair to downgrade a recipe when you changed it. 
But I really enjoy reading how others have changed ingredients depending on what they have in their cupboard.
Cooking wouldn't be fun if we only followed.

Lacking Dujon Mustard I used honey mustard instead. Forgot the lemon, but really, the dish did not need lemon. And we did not have parsley when I made this dish, I will be sure to add next time, but it may not need it to complete.

Loved this recipe!! Will be using for Christmas Eve Dinner!!

We made this for the first time with some skepticism, however it was FANTASTIC!!! So we made it again for my parents and served it with garlic parmesean asparagus, and rice/orzo pilaf.  My mother being a red seal chef thought it was Fabulous and took this easy recipie home.  The only adjustments that we made were that we left the lemon out and covered the salmon filllets entirely with the glaze.  Thank you for sharing

Delicious!!  I did not make any changes to the recipe but I used frozen salmon fillets so I was a little concerned that the topping would be soggy.  But I put them under the broiler for just a minute at the end and it worked just fine.   Everyone loved it and I will definitely make it again!

Loved it!  As another suggested, I didn't have pecans so used almonds instead with a few walnuts.  It was delicious!  Can't wait to try it with pecans.  My husband prefers a drier fish, so cooked longer than suggested.

It came out really good, I had too much sauce for the amount of fish I had so was a little soggy in spots but that can be easily corrected for next time. And there will be a next time! Excellent recipe.

I've made this countless times. Incredibly easy for a quick dinner and a "fancy" crowd pleaser. I cut back slightly on the butter and typically use 6oz. Salmon filets. This is a must try!

I made this recipe as written; no changes or modifications made. It was delicious. I did extend the baking time because my fillets were  thicker than usual. I would recommend this dish and also add that it would be suitable for company. It lends itself to advance preparation of the fish and topping with a quick assembly after guests arrive. Oh, and before I forget...my non-fish-loving husband liked this dish so I will be making it again!

I really liked it.  I don't like salmon and my husband loves it, so I am always looking for recipes to make salmon bearable to me.  I really liked the crust (didn't have nuts, used panko bread crumbs).  I put the crust thick on 2 sides for me, thinner and top only for husband and son.  I thought the flavor complemented the salmon flavor well.

I really enjoyed making this dish. I didn't have lemon so I garnished with bell peppers. I also substituted the pecans with cashews, as I don't like pecans. I will make again.Stacy

This salmon had a very interesting flavor.  I followed the recipe except for cutting back on the quantity of the sauce part to about half, something others recommended.  There was still plenty for a nice coating.  I may go a little stronger on the mustard next time (I used Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard).  I served this with a Long Grain and Wild Rice  mix, baked winter squash & a Reisling wine that had just a bit of sweetness.

This was very nice! I didn't have any walnuts, but the rest of the ingredients were a go! I made this for my southern Mexican family - who typically does NOT appreciate main dishes that are sweet - and it was a success! Just a hint of honey, and not overwhelmingly syrupy like I thought it might be. We'll be making this again!

I made this dish for a party of 15 and it was delicious but I sub and added a few ingredients to it along with all the other ingredients. Instead of using bread crumbs, I used matzo meal with teaspoon of smoke paprika and a teaspoon fresh mince oregano with the parleys. I also added fresh mince garlic into the spread and that really brings out the flavors. I did marinade my salmon with light sea salt first then prepared the salmon ahead of time about 5 hours in advanced. That marinade stage made a big difference in flavor and moisture. Every one raves about how moist the salmon and toasted crunch of the salmon. Delicious and yes will make it again.

Lets just say I'm in love with this recipe....understatement. I usually steam my salmon in a foil packet but this time I decided to put it straight into the oven with this dijon sauce and bread crumb topping...it took this salmon to the next level!! It definitely balances out the fishy taste of salmon. Came out super moist and flavorful! If you're a fan of spicy I would say throw some cayenne pepper in the honey dijon mixture, but it is just as good on its own. Will be using this recipe from now on!

This was SO delicious and even better left over the next day for lunch!!!  A wonderful balance of flavors, slightly subtle, and unique.  We paired it with an unoaked chardonnay, and had roasted asparagus on the side.  Loved the crunch of the pecans and the fresh parsley and lemon.  A sprinkling of salt brought out all the flavors.   We will be making this again and again!!!!

This is pretty tasty. Adjust the cooking time to suit your preference. I've made this a couple of times now, and the second time I did a sesame seed and Panko mix instead of pecans and breadcrumbs - I prefer the sesame version. Also, I had plenty of toppings to easily cover 5 plus fillets of salmon. Will make again.

Excellent flavor.  I will add a little more salt next time, but overall we enjoyed it.  Baking times need to be adjusted for thicker pieces of salmon.

This recipe is delicious!  We are fish lovers and I love trying new recipes.  I may just have to make this a few more times before I look for a new one for salmon.   I didn't even have to turn my oven on, as I made it in my toaster oven.

I made this for supper tonight and my son (who isn't a big fish fan) and I both loved it.  I've added it to his cookbook for when he goes to college next year.  My husband doesn't like fish and this didn't change his mind.  I will definitely make it again, though.

My family loves this dish.  It’s a lot of prep so I used a shortcut to cut down the time.  Instead of making the honey mustard , I used Marie’s honey mustard dressing.  The kids use it as extra sauce as well.  Just a suggestion for a mom on the go!

I made this a few times with wild sockeye salmon and it is great as written.  I mixed the mustard and honey with softened butter.   The mixture will cover at least 16 oz. of salmon.

Yummy.  This was an interesting way to prepare baked salmon and it was good!  I know some may say it was bland BUT, luckily,  I seasoned my bread crumbs with garlic powder, black pepper & Season All seasoning so it can bake  'in' the salmon, which was flavorful!   

I didn't use pecans (I dont like pecans) or any nuts. I used dried parsley instead of fresh parsley.  Lastly,  I added cayenne pepper on top of the breadcrumbs before entering the oven. It was yummy!

 Next time, I may try it with the skin off the bottom for lil more flavor. ...

My husband and I enjoyed it. I used some substitutions like Panko instead of the breadcrumbs and nuts because of my nut allergy. Still came out crunchy and delicious. I will make it again. Baking them in foil packets makes serving them, cleanup, and storage a breeze. Great salmon dish really. Definitely season to your taste. Mine ended up with a bit of minced garlic in the sauce for richness.

Great recipe! The fact that Dijon mustard is used for the honey mustard sauce makes this a perfect choice! I didn't have any pecans, and used dried parsley instead of fresh, but it still tasted great. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

We have a lake house and have made it four times this summer for different guests. I buy a large salmon and double or triple the recipe. It is so delicious and a real proud pleaser.  Love this recipe!!!!

My husband and I both love fish, but the dressing was bland and the breadcrumbs made it too dry. We did eat it, but have had much better luck with other recipes on this site. Overall not impressed.

I've made this so many times with and without the pecans (some of my friends don't eat pecans). This is so delicious. I've had rave reviews from so many friends and my boyfriend requests this all the time. Always a go-to for salmon.

WOW! Amazing recipe! We let it bake in the oven at 400F for 30 minutes and the salmon was falling apart when you got into it. It was so good. We're totally gonna make this again!

We make this all the time. It our favorite go to recipe for salmon. My preschooler and teen love this dish. 5 stars as written. 4 stars when made without lemon. We occasionally ad capers sparsely to the top.

This recipe is amazing. Have made it several times and am surprised it had a few such negative reviews.  My son in law enjoys salmon and when I made it for him, he asked me to give the recipe to his wife. Definitely a keeper in our house!

I tried this dish using panko instead of breadcrumbs and it came out to be delicious. You can make a healthy and delicious meal on a busy day as it is very easy to make.

I have been making this recipe for years now, and absolutely love it! It has always been highly praised by family and friends,  and is my "go to" recipe for first time guests, when fresh salmon is in season etc.  Delicious and easy, nice presentation too.
I am so surprised to see any negative reviews? I don't just brush the top of the salmon however, I dunk it into the honey dijon mustard mix and generously coat it with the sauce and panko crumb mixture, also add additional minced garlic.

Absolutely delicious salmon recipe. I followed some suggestions in the reviews to wait until the butter has set in the honey mustard mixture, then put a thick layer on the salmon. I also added salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to the nut and breadcrumb mix.

Always come out awesome and my kids love it. I don't have much time to prep and cook during the week so this a great go to recipe for me, quick prep, put it in the oven while i clean up and set the table. I usually roast my veggies at the same time in the oven w it and just pull them all out at the same time. Thanx for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe. It ended up having 3/4 honey Dijon mustard butter mixture left. The salmon tasted a little bland for me. I do like the surface of the salmon since I like the pecans and Dijon mustard. I'm thinking using this recipe to make salmon patty.

My husband and I both LOVE this recipe. So flavourful and easy to make. I didn't have any pecans on hand so I used crushed walnuts and dried parsley instead of fresh. It is now in our regular meal rotation!

The Dijon and honey were way too overpowering in this dish.  It was very sweet for my taste and the flavor didn't mesh well  with the salmon.  If I make this again I will leave out the honey and maybe just use a very light coating of sauce on the salmon.

I used coconut oil instead of butter. I also used less bread crumbs, as I was looking for a healthy light recipe. It turned out great and was delish. I also used honey Dijon mustard. I will definitely be making this again. It might replace my go-to salmon recipe too

I love this recipe and often use it on chicken as well. I followed the direcitons exactly and it was a hit! Idid subsitute panko for the bread crumbs which gave it more of a crust.

Without pecans - used maple syrup vs honey.
Mixed Mayo with honey mustard and maple syrup to coat.
Beautiful flavor.

This is a wonderful way to prepare salmon, the sauce gives it a little tang then you get the great crunch from the topping.  I've made it with and without the nuts and it's wonderful both ways.

Really enjoyed this (with some substitutions as I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand). I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used chipotle mustard. I tasted the sauce while mixing, and it was a little sweet with the substitution, so I added some lemon juice and dry white wine to taste. I used dried paresley instead of fresh. I also omitted the pecans as I'm not a big fan of nuts.

The one change I made was with the bread crumbs.  I ran a fresh slice of bread in a food processor till fine then spread the crumbs on a baking sheet and browned them under broiler. 
This is a great dish and will make it several times over!!

I took the advice of another reviewer put butter, mustard honey sauce in pan coated both sided of salmon and added some sliced carrots & pea pods.  I sprinkled the pecan mixture over everything.  I only took 15 min.  Yum!

I used Pandora instead of bread crumbs and maple syrup instead of honey as that is what I had on hand.  Also added a tablespoon of homemade mayonaise to the sauce. 
This is one of the tastiest salmon recipes I've made. Thank you.

This was so easy and very good flavor so. It's nice to find a recipe for fish besides the usual "put it on the grill" and it feels like a meal. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was delicious.  It was easy to prepare and in very little time, the salmon was ready to eat.  My partner said that it was like eating at a five star restaurant.  I will definitely prepare this again.  I accompanied it with buttered rice and mixed vegetables - excellent!  I definitely will make this dish again.

This was so good! I didn't have an parsley so I just omitted it. I also took the advice of another reviewer and crushed the pecans with a rolling pin in a ziplock bag and just dusted the tops of the salmon with that instead of using bread crumbs. It came out delicious!

Have made this dozens of times and it is one of the best recipes for salmon.  Sometimes I make it with just honey-Dijon mustard and sometimes honey and Dijon.  I use frozen fillets.  The sauce is very good and if you like to have some for the side, double it.

Delicious! Didn't have any butter and pecans so I substituted the butter with olive oil and omitted the pecans but it was still amazing! Heated up the remaining sauce and drizzled all over the salmon.

I felt there was more sauce than needed for 4-4 oz  salmon filets.  The mustard overpowered as a result.  The rest though was excellent!

I just made this for lunch and it was AMAZING!! I love spice so I did add some red pepper flakes and a little soy sauce to the mixture. I also drizzled some on top of the bread crumb mixture before I baked it. I out it over some garlic parmesan angel hair and it was delicious!

This would have been better had I not overcooked the salmon....that aside, the flavors and crunch contrast from the breading was very good.  I'd make it again but pay closer attention when baking so I don't overcook it again:)

First off, my family is not a huge fan of fish, even salmon. I bought some beautiful filets because the price was right & wanted to mix it up. Then I remembered I'd actually have to eat it. Ew! I found this recipe & made it but without pecans & with dried parsley. My entire family LOVED it!! My children raved the entire meal, my husband kept saying delicious & told me to save the recipe. Everyone ate every single bite! Thank you! I will definitely make it again.

I used this to cook myself some Salmon and the family some chicken breast.   It was a huge success, and my usually picky children ALL asked for a second helping.    Quick, easy, and flavorful!  The only thing that I omitted was the pecan, as I had none at the time.

I've made this quite a few times, it's a go to recipe for company. As good as any salmon you would get dining out. Only thing I change is pecans for walnuts, my friend is allergic to pecans. Sometimes I add a little white wine to the bottom of the pan. I have peach honey that I like in this recipe.

This baked salmon is delicious.  I had almonds on hand and they paired well with the fish.  I did not have quite enough honey, so I added a little maple syrup.  I think this sauce  and topping would be delicious on any fish.

Delicious! Followed the recipe just as written and both hubby and I thought it was a fabulous dinner. Served with rice and buttered green beans. Yum!
cook to 145.
May 2017: update: Used more pecans than bread crumbs. Baked at 400 for 10 minutes and last 1 1/2 minutes put the fish under a high broil to toast the crust. Had the fish REAL close to the broiler fire.

This is a phenomenal salmon recipe!  My husband and I both love this.  I've made it a few times already, using 1 pound of salmon.  The only change I make is substituting dried parsley (1 tsp) for fresh.  This is one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon.

most delicious salmon recipe that I have ever tried! My salmon filet was skin on and I think I will get it skinned next time.
I also didn't have pecans, so I used sliced almond and I crushed some cashews. It was yummy! I will definitely make this again!

I hated salmon.  But I knew it was good for me.  So I bought some, and made this recipe.   Everyone LOVED it.  Even my daughter, who also hated salmon.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I did remove the skin as another reviewer suggested, and it was flavorful and not at all fishy.  We will be eating more salmon now that I found this recipe.

Crowd pleaser!! did it for 10 - 12 people. By mistake I bought Cilantro instead of parsley,  but I took the risk and it was delicious. I also replaced the bread crumbs for oatmeal (blended). Great recipe! Loved it! Thank you!

I used Dijon mustard with horseradish in it and didn't use pecans (nut allergy in our house). The entire family (ages 9-46, 5 of us) loved it.

Loved the crunchy texture with the flakey salmon! I ran out of dijon mustard so I was a little short on mustard for the recipe but it still tasted like a little too much.  I used walnuts just because it was what I had on hand and that was delicious.  Next time I think I will add less mustard, more honey, and more nuts.

Yum! I made this recipe exactly as written (and doubled it) and it was delicious! If you're worried about calories, you might be able to cut the topping in half or 2/3 and still have a flavorful dish!

It was good but too sweet. I didn't have pecans so I used almond meal, and I forgot the lemon.  The honey might not have been too sweet had I squeezed lemon on it. If I make it again, I would add the lemon or else leave off the honey and add some garlic.

My husband and I are not big seafood fans. But his cousin brought us some from Alaska. My husbands first words were...what's on this? I told him wondering if he liked, or didn't like. He LIKED!! And so did I! We will have this again. The only thing I changed, was I subbed almond meal for the pecans, because I didn't have pecans. Yum!

I used Panko instead of breadcrumbs and walnuts instead of pecans bc I didn't have those ingredients.  It was soooo delicious.  I used the Dijon sauce on both sides of the salmon.

We have 50 lbs of salmon in the freezer so have it quite often.  I was looking for something besides the herb & lemon or soy sauce marinade.  This was great.  I was a little afraid of the mustard but it was very light and the honey just made it slightly sweet.  Already saved to have again.

This was a great recipe! I added the salt & pepper to the bread crumbs beforehand and put an extra 1/2 tablespoon of honey to the mustard. The flavors were perfect... My "hamburger -loving" teenager even loved it.

This was a very interesting recipe. I  expected it to have more of a sweetness to it because of the honey. The flavor was good, but after I drizzled a little more honey on top of the fish after cooking it, it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be making my salmon this way again in the future (with the extra honey).

This dish was delicious.  I cut the recipe in half for two, substituted Grey Poupon coarse ground because I didn't have Dijon.  It was so good!

The recipe was good, my husband and I made it just as described. The honey-mustard sauce tasted delicious. However, the next time I would try toasting the pecan nuts a little bit, before putting them on top of the salmon, for a little extra crunchiness.

This is delicious! I did not have the Italian season bread crumbs..I used panko crumbs and it was awesome! Definitely adding this one to my list.

We raved and loved it.
Instead of bread crumbs I used stuffing mix that I keep in the fridge for such items.  Added some dill and red pepper to the stuffing.  I didn't have the required nuts but again diced up the walnut I also keep handy. 
We are having it again tonight!!

I thought this was really good.  My husband was a little more critical.  He said that the flavor is good, but because it's so much flavor and topping, it seems a shame to pair it with salmon and basically cover all of the good flavor in the salmon.   We're thinking we'll try this again, but on Tilapia which needs more of a boost.

I've made this recipe several times, and it's phenomenal every time!  I'm gluten and dairy intolerant so I use Earth Balance butter substitute instead of butter, and substitute in gluten free panko for the breadcrumbs.  I also don't care for almonds, so I omit those, but it is wonderful.  Many of my friends that NEVER eat salmon or fish ask me to make it all the time.  Great recipe!!

I used a 2 pound whole salmon filet so we each could have the portion we prefer, and maybe have some left over. Doubled the sauce ingredients. Also used chopped pecans and panko that I had on hand.  Big mistake was making this with the 2 pound filet.  It was so good, the two of us just kept eating (over eating!) and very little was left over! For the 2 pounds I should have made only a half more of the sauce, but that's ok. Now I have some left to use on pouched eggs and smoked salmon.  Can't wait to make it again, but this time will have to use portion control. ??

Definitely company worthy!! I used panko crumbs. Also found out that the crumbs need to go last. I was in a hurry and mixed all the topping ingredients together. I thought the crumbs were 'soggy', but my husband couldn't tell the difference

Delicious, and EASY to make! Great dinner with items I always have in my kitchen already! A repeat dinner for me!

May have even reviewed this before.. I have to look it up from time to time to remember correct proportions.  A great go-to meal when I have company for dinner. Goes great with sautéed veggies and couscous.. which luckily all have quick cooking times. :)

Despite the overall rave reviews I almost didn't try this recipe due to reading some of the less than stellar reviews given. My husband was the one who convinced me stating "some people are always not going to like something's". So I went ahead and gave it a try, and I'm sure glad I did. This tasted great! And it passed the husband test, as he throughly enjoyed it too. I followed the recipe exactly except I replaced finely chopped pecans with finely chopped walnuts (that's all I had in the pantry). I used the extra honey Dijon mixture as a dip for the salmon and my sweet potatoes. Overall, great dish. I'm not sure why there are even bad reviews for this recipe to begin with!

Thanks for recipe Esmee but this was not that good to me. I liked all the ingredients and so ate it. Generally I like to save sweetness for dessert. My family all grew up to like the simple taste for meats and vegies with just herbs and butter and a little salt. If prepared well, salmon has a delicious flavor that's unique.

Outstanding!!! My husband and guests couldn't stop raving about it! Was looking for something different to do with salmon, I know the recipe sounded good but didn't see that kind of response happening.  I followed the recipe without changes but I was very generous with the sauce on the salmon.    I really can't wait to make it again!!!! Thank you for this.  Just a note my husband actually wanted to make sure I saved this recipe:)

My husband and I liked this okay, but our kids all hated it.  They usually like honey mustard, but something about the mustard and the salmon flavors didn't mesh well for us.  I made it exactly as specified.  Just not our cup of tea.

I LOVED this recipe and so did my family!  I changed the amount of butter to just one tablespoon and I used a tiny bit less mustard and added just a touch of mayo.  I used panko bread crumbs too which made it extra crunchy!  Will definitely be making this again.  Maybe I'll try it on baked chicken too.

I made this last night and was very pleasantly surprised by the buttery, moist and almost melt-in-your-mouth texture! The only additional thing I did once I removed from oven, was to cover casserole dish with its top to make sure moisture was held in (I'm always afraid my salmon will dry out).  This is definitely on my "keep it" list! Thanks for a great recipe!

I used panko vs. bread crumbs for a lighter coating. Instead of baking it in the oven, we grilled it on cedar plank.  It was awesome and we'll definitely make it again.

This was very simple to make. The result is a super moist and very tasty salmon! We loved this and will definitely make it again. I didn't have the parsley so I put in a sprinkle of dried Italian seasoning. I used Italian bread crumbs because that's all I ever buy and I added in a sprinkle of garlic and wine seasoning. I'm not sure about the lady who said it was bland because this had such a wonderful flavor. With the mixture that you brush on the salmon, I'm not sure how it could come out bland at all. Very much worth trying this recipe out!

I went wrong with the mustard:  it is important to be very frugal with the application.

I just made, and ate, this dish. It was really lovely, I will definitely be making it again. My husband agreed with me, such a tasty topping and the mustard was a tangy taste. I smothered the top of the salmon with the dressing and then coated the top with the dry ingredients - nice and thick. It turned out nice and crunchy - the salmon was lovely and moist too - it didn't dry out, which can happen with some recipes for salmon.

Yes, I have made this twice now . I  really loved the change from my usual favorite way. I used old fashion whole grain mustard, and tarragon in place of the parsley, and made a tarragon compound  butter to drizzle over when serving . Other than that I baked it as per instruction.  I Loved crispy panko crust.(No Pecans  tho!) Thanks for this variation in preparing my weekly salmon craving!  =)

We loved it!!! I substituted panko for the bread crumbs (it crusted nicely)and used candied pecans and dried dill instead of parsley.  Baked for about 20 minutes....it was the moistest salmon I ever had!!!

SO DELICIOUS....decided to use crushed up whole wheat crackers instead of bread crumbs for maybe a healthier version? I don't know, but it was amazing! Served with green beans and brown rice.

I don't know how this could ever be rated the worst because ever time I make it...everyone LOVES it. I always make extra so my boyfriend can take it to work the next day and he never gets a bite because all his co-workers take it. 
I always add more pecans because you can never have too many pecans! The crunch and the honey and Dijon mustard. Use fresh salmon!

I have been using this exact recipe for a number of years. It is my go-to recipe for guests and raves always follow. The only change I make is to use Panko bread crumbs for the extra crunch. A little tip: triple or quadruple the recipe for each of the two components and keep them in the fridge for that quick dinner after coming home. They will keep nicely for at least a week.

I've made this dish a few times. Make sure the ice is off of the fish so that the glaze sticks to it. Some people don't like as sweet of a meal, so put less honey. I used spicy mustard and it worked great.

Absolutely DELICIOUS.  This recipe is a keeper and was so easy to follow and quick to make.  I had everything ready a couple of hours prior, so when my company arrived, all I had to do was pop the pan into the oven and in 15 minutes it was done.

I agree with those who wrote that it needs to bake longer. At 15 minutes, the salmon was not nearly done. I baked it for 25 minutes and it was fine. I love the recipe.

In a word ... Yummy!!!! This was the easiest salmon recipe I have ever made.  My husband does not eat fish of any kind but I love it.  Even with scaling down the ingredients to feed me it was the most delicious recipe I have ever tasted.  I am going to share it with my boss and his wife because they are always looking for new and tasty recipes.
I am so glad I found this!!!!!!

Really enjoyed this recipe, made it as reads (minus parsley as I didn't have any), and it came out well. Next time I'll probably add a little salt, and may play with some other ingredients just to see what I can come up with. 
Overall a very solid recipe!!

I made this EXACTLY as written and my family really enjoyed this dish. I do want to note that I did not use all of the Dijon/butter/honey mixture since that part of the instruction wasn't  clear to me. I only put a light layer of it on both sides.

I have just recently started cooking.  I was surprised at how easy it was to make this dish.  My husband loved it!  I didn't have honey the second time I made it so I substituted 100% maple syrup and it still tasted awesome.

Way too much dijon mustard - totally overpowered the salmon. The breadcrumbs and pecans seemed so appealing but in the end added nothing to the overall flavor.

I added garlic powder and a bit of cayenne.  my salmon was one big piece - 1 1/2 lb.  needed to cook it about 15 min longer, but plenty of sauce and topping for the whole piece.

I elected to skip nuts. Also added white wine and minced garlic to the Dijon mix as well as minced garlic and simmered that down to a lesser volume then used it as a marinade for the Sockeye. Couple hours later I added my seasoned breadcrumb to the fillet that had been removed from the marinade and baked it. Very nice taste though a bit salty. Might use less Dijon if I cook it again.

I made this meal for meal prep and it was awesome even days later! Just a few small changes I made, I used a honey-flavored Dijon mustard and cut back a little on the honey. I then coated both sides of the salmon sprinkling salt and pepper on both sides before adding the bread crumb mixture, this way I know it is well seasoned instead of just tasting salty on top. I unfortunately had to cook it on 425 since I had other things in the oven but it still came out perfect despite forgetting about it for a minute or two.  But it was VERY tasty! I made an Asparagus-Bacon dish as the side and it was quite popular in the teacher's lounge the next day! :)

Delicious! I threw all the ingredients in one bowl. I think it's easier to spread on top of the fillets.

Made the low carb version- almond flour vs. bread crumbs and also used walnuts vs. pecans because they were on hand.. Also drizzled extra melted butter on top because butter makes everything better. Beautiful dish and yummy.

I thought it was a unique and flavourful  recipe. I love Dijon so I was excited to try the flavor with salmon. Unfortunately I found it a bit too buttery for my taste, and i thought the butter overpowered the other flavors. I'd probably half the butter next time, or even try olive oil instead as a healthier alternative. I also added some freshly minced garlic to the butter, mustard, honey mix.

This recipe came out great. I replaced the pecans for walnuts because its what I had on hand, and reduced the butter by HALF. Seriously, there was a lot of sauce left over, even after halving the butter. The consistency of the sauce was still good without it. Overall, we enjoyed this dish a lot, the salmon was very moist and flavorful and the topping had a bit of crunch.

I substituted cashews for the pecans and dill for the parsley because that is what I had on hand. It turned out lovely—moist, tender and flavorfull.

The BEST salmon I have ever made. Let me repeat: the BEST salmon I have ever made, quote, unquote from my husband. I had to make a slight variation in that I used my homemade lemon zest breadcrumbs that I keep in the freezer, but that was it. I also like fish cooked longer than most, but it didn't affect it adversely at all. Absolutely delish. This goes on the regular roster. 

I made too much of the butter/Dijon/honey mixture, so I tossed that with my steamed broccoli. It wasn't even overkill of flavor, it is that good.

This is one of my go-to salmon recipes; it is extremely easy to make (I put the topping in m food processor, and viola, it's done).  The butter, honey and breadcrumbs combine to make this luscious crust that is sweet and savory--perfect for salmon!

I changed the amount of honey and mustard a bit to adjust it to my taste (less sweet by lowering the amount of honey) and it really tasted great. Wished I used better salmon, because this one was too watery.

I've made this several times but don't use the pecans and instead of brushing the sauce on i actually lay the fish skin up in it and then into the bread crumbs it coats it way better and you get more of the sauce actually on the fish. Its definitely a winner in my household

Yeah, it's OK, but it's a lot more complicated than it has to be, and it would have tasted better without the honey and pecans.

Make this.  Eat it.  Repeat.  So freakin' good.  so good.  so easy.  I didn't plan this ahead, I came home with salmon and then was looking for something to do with it.  The pecans I had were left over from a desert I had made, so they were candied pecans. Also, I had cilantro in my fridge, not parsley.  BFD.  It will probably be better as written.  I am going to make this again tomorrow.

Loved, loved this recipe! My husband said that this was restaraunt quality. Flavors were wonderful. I loved the dijon mustard taste. It is so sweet and flavorful. I didn't have honey, so I used maple syrup. The maple didn't seem to interfere with the other flavors.  For the bread crumbs I used Panko. I will definitely make this again.

We found it bland and mushy and sadly disappointing.

I have made this several times. Follow the recipe except I add a little bit of balsamic vinegar to cut the sweetness. While the Dijon - honey mixture really doesn't taste that great, when cooked with the salmon, makes the fish incredibly moist. The pecans are great-- don't skimp.

This is one of the simplest salmon recipes ever....and delicious! My hubby is not a fan of salmon but he really loved it. I switched a couple of ingredients to use what I had on hand: panko was used for regular dry bread crumbs and pepitas instead of pecans. Both worked perfectly and I will probably always use the panko. I love the extra crunch it gives.  Thanks so much for sharing what I'm sure is going to be a regular go to recipe anytime salmon is on sale!

Great! My girlfriend loved it. I am not a mustard fan, however, I put maybe too much for my taste. If you do not like mustard I would recommend just putting a little mustard into your own bowl mixed with the rest. Overall great dish

This is the best salmon I have ever eaten and my family eats lots of fish. I cooked it 15 minutes and it was moist and flaky. The only change I made was substituting Panko for the breadcrumbs, simply because I had it on hand. I am sure the breadcrumbs are just as tasty. No more grilled salmon for us- we will stick to this recipe.

Made this recipe just as it is listed.  For those saying it is bland, perhaps you didn't use the right Dijon mustard.  We found it to be very tasteful, with just the right amount of Twang.  I liked the pecans added too.  Very hearty to just serve with a salad and be very filling.  Love it!

We loved this. Didn't have any pecans so didn't use them, but we did have
chipolte breadcrumbs so subbed them instead of plain. Excellent tasting and very easy to make.

Have made this salmon recipe twice. First time I used the pecans, second time I left them out. Really did not notice much difference. I used Panko instead of plain breadcrumbs for extra crunch. Will be making frequently.

Strange combination of flavors. I followed the recipe precisely and, although the fish looked terrific, the flavors did not come together at all. You taste the subtle salmon and then get blasts of honey-mustard, which is very overpowering. My whole family agreed that the flavors just don't go well together. The breadcrumb-nut topping adds some great texture, but we'll try it with a different sauce next time.

I will definetely make this again.  I think it is just a tad better if you skin salmon first and then coat all sides with the dijon mixture.  I finished it off with a few minutes under the broiler.  Absolutely delicious and great flavor

Really good! We usually grill our salmon, but since it is -3 outside, my husband didn't want to grill. (Imagine that.) This was quick, easy, and we both really liked it. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe was excellent.  My first time baking salmon for my boyfriend and he raved that it tasted like restaurant quality.  Followed the recipe exactly but slathered the sauce on after letting it sit for a bit.  I also peeled off the skin and put sauce on both sides as well as crumb/pecan mixture.  Served with wild rice and asparagus.  Will definitely make again!!

This was unbelievably delicious.  I was looking for something that would be fast and tasty.  It took no time to pull the ingredients together.  I made this for two pieces of salmon.  I did not reduce the ingredient amount.  It was slathered in the honey / Dijon mustard sauce and the bread crumb mixture.  It was so good, we wanted more immediately

I thought this had good flavor, and the salmon came out really moist (I slathered on the sauce.) I wasn't blown away, but I will make it again. I didn't have pecans, so I left them out which was my mistake because the mixture was kind of mushy. Tasted good, but the texture was kind of gross. I won't skip them next time.

This was fantastic - and so easy! I would add a little less breadcrumbs next time (perhaps just 2-3T) and just 2T of butter. Set aside half of the liquid to use as a sauce when the fish is done. A little drizzle over the top would have added just enough moisture to the cooked fish for a special touch.

GREAT, GREAT,GREAT!  I am always looking for new recipes and you won't find a better one than this. I made it using crushed roasted almonds only because I had no pecans. My family loved it. I will make it again using pecans next time.

I made this recipe last year at Thanksgiving and again this year at Thanksgiving.  I'm not sure why I don't make it more because it's one that I get nothing but compliments on.  I follow the steps exactly as stated.  Everyone loves it! I always use Panko bread crumbs and add a little Paprika to the bread crumb mix along with some dried basil for a little different flavor.  It's definitely a keeper.

I have made this 3 times in the last week for several different people. It is loved by all, even non salmon eaters. I roll the whole piece of fish in the breading for an even coating prior to baking. Thanks for the great recipe!

I guess we were expecting this dish to be more flavorful than it turned out...we didn't change anything, yet it was rather bland. Perhaps it has to do with the brand and/or flavor of Dijon mustard? We used plain Dijon mustard...maybe Maille's Old Style Whole Grain Dijon would be spicer? 
I'd like to try a spicier mustard next time, with less butter, and use it on chicken.

delicious. Came out absolutely perfect, followed the recipe except for the fresh parsley, i had to substitute with dry parsley because that's all i had on hand. Fresh parsely will make this even better next time.

It's pretty hard to screw up salmon, espcially sockeye. My family wasnt a big fans of the breading on top, but still tasted good non the less. next time I would add 1/4 of the required toppings. Thank you allrecipes you always have new ideas to try

This was great, did not have Dijon so used stone ground mustard instead, came out just as well. Easy to make and my wife loved this. Of course a key is to get the best possible salmon you can find.

I read the reviews and only made half of the sauce, which looked about right, since the recipe called for only enough to brush it on.  I think next time I will use more mustard though, b/c I liked the flavor.  The nuts and bread crumb definitely were important.  It was very simple and I would make again.

I have made this several times and it is now a family favorite. Last night I realized we did not have Dijon mustard so I substituted Ken's Steak House Honey Mustard dipping sauce/salad dressing. Didn't add any honey but still used the butter. Tasted great and it was even easier!

We always thought that we weren't keen on Salmon but this recipe is really tasty and very easy to prepare. Looking forward to making it again, soon! I didn't have pecans as they are difficult to get here in Portugal, used walnuts and it was truly delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy! My 7 and 4 year old kids love it! The first time I made it, I misread the ingredient for pecans and used pine nuts instead. It turned out marvelous! Pine nuts are slightly sweet and oh man did it work well with the dish. To this day I have not tried the pecans but always use pine nuts.

One of the best salmon recipes ever.  I used 1 tsp. dried parsley for the fresh and made the rest of the recipe as written.  Brushed mustard sauce on both sides and topped with the crumb/pecan mixture.  Baked for 15 minutes.  Absolutely incredible.

I liked the recipe.  Made it according to the directions.  I seasoned the salmon with salt and pepper first, then added a thick layer of the butter sauce followed by the breadcrumb mixture.  The topping, while tasty, was pretty dry.  It was tasty enough to try again, but next time I will probably try mixing the breadcrumb mixture with the honey-mustard-butter mix and then spread it on top.  My salmon was about 1 1/2 inches thick at it's thickest.  I used a convection oven for 15 minutes on 400 and it came out perfectly cooked.

This was very tasty and a memorable dish! I added a little chopped garlic and a sprinkle of Penzey's powdered lemon peel to the melted butter. I used my food processor to finely chop the pecans, and used a 50/50 mixture of Italian seasoned bread crumbs & Panko for crunch. I baked the salmon for 18 minutes, and it turned out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very tasty!! My kids loved it...especially the mustard sauce! Made no changes. Very easy to put together. Will make again! Made again tonight for the 10th, 15th, whatever time and realized I had no pecans. I substituted sliced almonds and it was amazing as always! Just made this for Easter '19 and used a 2.5 lb slab of salmon and 2 1/2 x the recipe and used the sliced almonds again. Great presentation and the salmon came out amazing as usual!

Sooo good! This is a quick and simple recipe that doesn't require any "special" ingredients. All stuff most people already have on hand, which is nice! Very flavorful and moist. It's a keeper :)

I think this is a wonderful recipe for salmon. Thank you. The only alteration I made was to reduce the mustard to two tablespoons. It's our personal preference since we find the Dijon mustard quite powerful. I served it on a bed of arugula. After reading other reviews who said this was bland, I think it might have something to do with how fresh your salmon is. It was not at all bland. We loved it and it's a keeper!

So easy to make and really gives the fish a lot of flavor! Don't make it for people who don't like mustard, though.

Amazing! Perfect blend of sweet and savory! I followed the recipe to a "T" as I had all ingredients and it was superb! I actually griiled it in a tin foil packet on the BBQ and it came out perfectly. Cooking times may vary depending on how well done or slightly undercooked you prefer your salmon.

Excellent! My fiance is a huge salmon fan and he loved it. I just used chopped pecans instead of finely chopped and we both loved the flavor and texture the chunks of pecan added. I will be making this again!

Really very surprised there are any bad reviews, however everyone has different taste. This recipe was a perfect fit for my small family and as suggested in the description making a fair amount was a good idea. My extremely picky son adored this meal and actually are seconds. This is a favorite and will definitely keep this a usual meal on the menu! Thanks!!

I slather the honey dijon on thick, then pat the crumb mixture into it. Super easy if you use a food processor or blender for the nuts and parsley.

Tasted great! I'm not that great of a cook and it turned out yummy! newb tip: I suck at "finely chopping" anything with a knife. This probably would have been terrible If I didn't have my Bullet up in the cupboard.

This recipe was awesome! My fiancé and I both loved it!  I used vegan butter and Italian bread crumbs, so I didn't need to use any other parsley. I also left out the pecans because it didn't have any, but it sounds like it'd be good with the pecans. Overall, this was definitely a hit and I'll be making it again!

I made this recipe today and I was very pleased with it. A lot of ppl said this recipe was bland so I added a few more condiments like adobo and paprika to the bread crumbs(which were Italian) and also Parmesan cheese. I didn't use pecans because I didn't have any but I added some pressed garlic as another reviewer suggested. I also only used 1tbs of honey because I didn't want it to be to sweet. I had enough sauce to generously coat the fish but not have left overs. After it was cooked I squeezed a lemon over it. I paired the fish with a seasoned baked yam and creme of spinach. The mixture of flavors was amazing! Don't over do the mustard as the taste is very rich.

The "sauce" was delicious but will use it for pork. It was a bit too sweet for our taste in salmon dishes.

It was okay. I really liked the honey mustard sauce, and the pecans individually, but seemed too much for the salmon. I would try it again with just the sauce.

This sauce is really good.  I only had cashews so I chopped them up really well.  Next time I won't bother with the bread crumbs.  Yummy!

My husband said this was the best salmon recipe he has ever had!  Super easy and delicious.  Would also be great for entertaining since you can prep everything ahead of time.

This recipe is very tasty. You have the flaky, slightly-sweet, light mustard flavored salmon and then a nice crunchy topping. It really works well together. My family ate every last bite. As a former Alaska commercial salmon fisher-woman, I have had many salmon recipes and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Made this for dinner this evening with a pound of skin on salmon.  Since I didn't have any dijon mustard, I used half of a white wine mustard and half whole grain garlic mustard.  Used Panko breadcrumbs (the best crispiness!)  This was absolutely delicious!  The pecans make this dish - they add such a wonderful sweetness and nuttiness when toasted with the breadcrumbs.  Thank you for the wonderful dinner!

This was such a simple great tasting recipe!! I used panko crumbs instead of bread and it was very light with just a bit of crunch. Wonderful!

It all depends on how spicy a mustard you use. We used a very spicy dijon and it came out great! Also used panko breadcrumbs. I think the lemon adds quite a bit too.

I made this for my husband last night and he loved it!  I took the advice of one of the reviews that said she waited until the butter firmed up a little bit.  I also didn't have honey on hand so I used dijon mustard that had honey in it.  Thanks so much for sharing this, my hubby wants me to make it again next week!  Something tells me this will be a regular menu item at our house...and this recipe is super easy!!

Very good - topping was delicious, and so was the mustard sauce.  Only used 2 Tbsps mustard, but everything else the same.  The salmon was moist and tasty.

Fantastic! When the weather gets cold, I don't like going outside to grill, and I was looking for a different way to prepare salmon. This recipe was not only easy to make, but very tasty. I added just a touch more Dijon mustard because I like Dijon mustard, otherwise, I followed the recipe directions to the letter, except instead of brushing each salmon filet "lightly", I brushed each filet "generously".  I served the salmon with a mixed green salad and it was a hit. My wife loved it. I don't understand people who "hate" this recipe, they must be difficult to please. Perhaps they can hire a personal chef to make their salmon to please their palate. Sheesh.

Just served this for a dinner party tonight. I followed it to a t.  It is incredible!  I will serve it many, many more times to come.  My partner said, it melted like butter in his mouth.  He can't wait to have it again either.

I did not care for this at all. My hubs thought this was "OK," but didn't like the pecans at all. I agree and think it was the pecans that turned me off most (they are totally out of place IMHO). The glaze is also a tad too mustard-y for my liking. I pretty much followed Esmee's directions to the letter but had to improvise because I misread part of them. I forgot to add my melted butter to my honey mustard mixture, so I added it to my breadcrumb / pecan mixture instead. I think this really helped the topping crisp up nicely (the highlight of this meal). All in all, I'm glad to have given this a try, but this is just not for me (sorry!). Thanks anyways, Esmee.

PERSONALLY HAVE NOT MADE THIS BUT I HAVE HAD THIS VERY SIMILAR AND IN A RESTARAUNT OF ALL PLACES AND IT WAS REALLY EXCELENT. THE ONLY THING MISSING THERE WERE THE PECANS. i HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS A WAITRESS IN THAT RESTARAUNT WHO GOT ME TO TRY IT AND IT WAS GOOD. I AM A FISH LOVER AND CAN HARDLY WAIT TO MAKE THIS. LOST THE RECIPE THE COOK GAVE ME FOR THIS. SO GLAD I FOUND IT.

I used this recipe to make a 12 oz filet, and it turned out wonderfully! I was getting bored of the lemon and pepper salmon, so I decided to try this one out. I'm definitely not sure why the poor reviews. There was enough sauce left over and it thickened while the salmon was cooking so I drizzled over the final product. So good I ate it before I remembered to take a picture to share. Couldn't recommend this recipe more! Served with wild rice and some sauteed veggies. Do try it out!

Very flavourful. Some in my family love it, while others think it's "okay". The pecans are a really nice touch. I have also made this recipe with less carbs by substituting the bread crumbs for unsweetened coconut powder. Also i have tried roasted almond slices when i didn't have pecans. Overall this is good.

My husband and I didn't care for this recipe.  There was little flavor other than the mustard.  I used a whole grain dijon.  Maybe I need to use a creamer chablis version?  Also, there was too much topping and it didn't get toasty.

Unfortunately didn't have pecans to cook with and cheated with ground up Italian croutons, but it was still very good.  We'll definitely be making it again, and I can't wait to try it with the pecans.

This was very easy and delicious!  I served it with a  rice salad.  My husband and children loved this recipe.  They said it tasted as if it were from a restaurant.  I followed the directions exactly, except that I made my own bread crumbs and cut the butter in half.  The next day, my husband kept raving on and on about it, and told me  I was such a great cook!

No flavor.  No one in my family likes salmon, but we can usually try some.  This we really didn't like.

This is absolutely amazing!  There are many different flavors here, and together they are delicious!  I would add I can't imagine how this dish could be described as bland- to my husband and I it was extremely flavorful!  I printed multiple salmon dishes to try, and I decided to start with this one.  I will also finish this one, this will be the way I make salmon from now on!

Recipe is wonderful! It reminds me of this place we used to eat that served pecan crusted grouper. The taste is really close but still very very good. 4 thumbs up in this house.

I made this and did the following substitutions: I halved the sauce and breading because I only used 3 filets. It was still plenty. I also added a pinch of garlic powder, Italian Seasoning and Red Pepper flakes to the breading mixture because it seemed a little to boring to start off with.  I omitted salt. It was delicious.  I would have given it 5 stars if there was more seasoning in the breading mixture.

Easy, delicious & quick recipe that the hubby & kids liked a lot. Subbed 2 tsp dried parsley for 4 tsp fresh parsley. Used on 1.5 # salmon, as there was a lot of sauce & we need more than a pound for dinner. Even using extra salmon, I still had a little sauce left after coating the fillets with bread crumb/pecan mixture...drizzled this over the top of the fillets & cooked 15 minutes. Very tasty & no leftovers, so I consider this a success!  Thanks for the great recipe Esmee!

Made this for dinner tonight. I easily pared it down for just 1 serving. My daughter doesn't do ANY kind of fish, and my son was at work. I think next time I will use less butter as it made a lot of sauce, but I still want the tanginess of the mustard and the sweetness of the honey to come out. Also I crushed a couple of almonds since I didn't have pecans. Using the Panko breadcrumbs gave it a nice crunch finish. I will definitely make this again. I like the suggestions of adding some cayenne pepper too, so I may try that next time as well.

Very tasty. Nice balance of ingredients.   I could have cut the servings in half because it made a lot. I seasoned with salt and pepper first not last step. It's an easy recipe and watching the video helped.  Great dish for company!

This was ok.  I was really excited to make it, thinking that it would definitely be a keeper.  But, I will not be making it again.   It really has no depth of flavor.  I even added a few pinches of cayenne pepper, but that did not help.  I can't believe that so many people rated this so highly...it really is average.   (And yes, I followed this recipe exactly).

Great Recipe.  We love salmon.  This is simple and tastes brilliant.  When out of Dijon I used a Sweet & Spicy mustard.  This was terrific.  To speed things up I don't bother to mix the dry ingredients, I just sprinkle directly from their containers.  Also, sliced almonds works really well in place of the pecans.

This was wonderful.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made some minor changes.  I had no honey so I used maple syrup.  A great substitution!  I later made it with honey and would stick with the maple syrup.  I also had no pecans so I went with almonds.  Yummy!

I was disappointed by this recipe. I followed the instructions and the flavor of the salmon was not good. I think honey/Dijon flavor is better suited with chicken.

I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could.  It was different and very tasty.  Very nice change of pace from the normal soy sauce themed recipes.  I used light butter (about 3 tablespoons since I had 2 pieces of salmon), the full amount of mustard and honey and used 3 tablespoons each of pecans and Panko crumbs. Since I used soft light butter, I just mixed the mustard and honey into the butter (without melting).  This made for a thicker paste that was easy to spread on top of the fish.  I had a bit of the topping mix left over, so I"ll cut that down to a 2 serving size when we have it again.

Truly delicious! And so simple. I didn't add nuts or parsley to the breadcrumbs -- just plain 4C. Everything else I did exactly the same. There are plenty of fish marinades in the sea, but this is one of the best.

This is divine! I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was so tasty and easy. I made the coating and sauce earlier in the day and once I was ready to bake it it was so quick to assemble and toss in oven.  I servedit with coucous and green beans. Perfect meal!

I have never cooked salmon before. My husband likes it, and always orders it when we go out, so I figured I'd try it. I probably cooked it wrong, but it was mushy. I didn't like it at all, and my husband didn't love it. Next time I think I'll try a cook top recipe, vs an oven recipe.

The recipe is not one of my favorites.  I do not know whose idea it was to use nuts on salmon but it does not add any additional flavor.  I did find the dijon butter/ honey mix along with the bread crumbs and parsley outstanding and will only use that part of the recipe with a drizzle of the dijon mixture warm on top of the breadcrumbs when I am ready to serve.

This recipe is wonderful. I had a really hard time getting my husband to eat Salmon. Because we eat fish twice a week I needed a good receipe for Salmon. My husband is a diabetic. I substituted the honey and mustard with Smart Balance Mayo and Smart balance butter. He just loved it and now he asks for it at least once a week....

If you are looking to impress, this is the right recipe!  I make all SORTS of salmon dishes with salmon that we always have on hand in the freezer and this one is always my personal favorite.  It is beautiful too!  I save a little bit of the dijon mixture for plating.

My mainstay salmon recipe is a honey-soy-ginger marinade for grilling, but this was very good and popular with the entire family. I will add this to the recipe file to make again.

This was excellent!  Very easy, only thing I left out were the nuts (because I don't like nuts). The fillets came out tender and had a great taste.  Highly recommend!  This recipe is now on my favorites list for salmon.

This was great,  not to overpowering but so tasty,  still had the nice salmon flavour but the seasoning was perfect.  I think it is important to use a good substantial piece of salmon though,  smaller portions may not be as evenly matched.

I make this about once a week, this is one of our favorite dishes!  As some others have noted the butter-mustard-honey mixture is a LOT of sauce, I recommend dividing it before putting half on the raw fish and reserving the other half as a dipping sauce for the table.  It's best written, but if I'm feeling lazy I won't make the breadcrumbs mixture and just sprinkle some on directly from the can.  The sauce adds enough flavor for it to still be excellent, but add the parsley and nuts if you have them.

I saw this post up on allrecipes.com on Sunday morning and coincidentally I had already taken some salmon out of the freezer to thaw for dinner. I'm glad I found this recipe because I needed something creative to do with my salmon. I didn't use all of the ingredients, I only used mustard, honey, butter, parsley, and bread crumbs. I seasoned my salmon with red pepper. It turned out pretty good.

Loved this! I even prepared it for someone who doesn't like fish and they gobbled it up. The Dijon tastes wonderful with the honey and nuts which add in some sweetness. I'll definitely add this to my quick and healthy recipe short list.

Had high hopes for this one due to the reviews.  It was good and I will add it to our Salmon rotation for variety.  It is worth making and has a good flavor, however, I wasn't wowed like others.  I would suggest making more of the bread crumb coating.  I only had 2 filets and used all of it.  Would have been disapointed in the lack of coating if I had to spread it over 4 filets.

We loved it. I used brown rice bread crumbs and ghee for a gluten and lactose free version. I did reduce honey to 1Tbsp and it was plenty sweet. With this coating and sauce salmon doesn't have as prominent flavor. But my son who dislikes salmon still didn't like it.

Wow! Just enjoyed this delicious recipe. My husband kept bragging about it. I served with caramalized onions and steamed spinach. So thrilled to have a healthy and delicious meal! Didn't have pecans so crushed up some slivered almonds. Worked just fine.

This is an amazing recipe- the flavors are delicious with the salmon. If you are health conscious you can omit the butter and add 2 TBSP of olive oil instead. I also did not use breadcrumbs as I did not have any on hand and I found the pecans gave it enough flavor and texture that I will not be using breadcrumbs at all on this dish in the future. Thanks for the dish Esmee

This was amazing. I highly recommend that you save the Dijon-honey mixture to dip your salmon in. I made it with Sweet Potatoes. Amazing.

Totally forgot the dijon mustard, but used regular mustard and it turned out great. I love the crisp the pecans added to it. Very yummy!

Unbelievable taste and so easy! Served to guests and we all loved it. Easy to posh up with side dishes for a dinner party or make it a casual week night meal. I used Agave instead of honey as a personal preference. Leftover piece was delicious cold, broken up and tossed in a salad! Thank you for sharing!!

Not bad, however, it's too buttery and fatty for my taste. Because salmon is a naturally fatty fish, I think it tastes overly fatty if you add butter. In my opinion, salmon tastes better with a a lighter sauce - for instance, olive oil + soy sauce + lemon.

Excellent! So much flavour!  I didn't have enough dijon so I added some plain mustard.  I also didn't have any pecans.  However, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing.  Next time I think I might double the sauce because is tasted awesome over rice.

This recipe was wonderful, first time I ever cooked fish. The fish took 15- 20 in my oven and even though the recipe doesn't say it, always skin the fish before baking unless otherwise instructed. Or you can also put down aluminum foil and the skin will stick to it. The recipe is great as is but I was cooking for gluten, red meat, and lactose intolerant guests, so I substituted olive oil and nixed the bread crumbs, still great.

Update: It doesn't even need the bread crumbs, I don't even use them anymore.

This was really good! Especially considering the minimal prep time. Loved the different textures. I used stone ground mustard instead of dijon and it still came out great.

Very easy and tasty dish. I used spicy brown mustard and olive oil spread as substitutes. I also used Planko and breaded both sides of the salmon. Very good and quick dish. I also boiled the leftover sauce and mixed frozen green beans with it and served on the side. DELICIOUS!

I doubled this recipe for my family and there was very little left. I followed the recipe, except used dry parsley instead of fresh. My husband, 8, 6 and 4 year olds raved. Served it with rice pilaf and edamame.

I can't believe how easy this recipe was to make. The salmon was so moist and flavorful. Although I know some of you said not to stray from the original ingredients, I didn't have the time to buy pecans and wanted to use the honey mustard I have at home instead. Since the mustard I used already has honey, I just left out the extra honey the recipe calls for. It came out just fine! Thanks!

Easy, flavorful and different than most typical salmon recipes.  Next time I plan to use Panko instead of regular breadcrumbs and maybe a little more honey to counter the bite of the dijon.

YUM! Didn't want to fork out the money for pecans (single eater here) so went without but didn't hurt this recipe at all. Delicious. Makes the fish so flavourful without taking away the taste of the salmon completely. Easy and fast. Served with rice and veggies.

My new favorite way of cooking salmon! I first seasoned the salmon fillets with a touch of lemon & pepper. I used 1 Tbsp of honey instead of 1 1/2 and did not use the pecans. Everything else I did like the recipe said. It was delicious! Even my kid ate it all! I'm saving this one. Thank you, Esmee.

This is my absolute favorite salmon dish from this website!  It was amazing and gave the salmon such great flavor. We could not get enough.  I have tried a lot of salmon recipes and this takes the cake for sure. We are thinking of trying it again soon with panko bread crumbs...yum.

I substituted pecans for almonds, parsley for cilantro, bread crumbs for garlic herb crumbs, and only used 1 tablespoon of butter. Turned out yummy :)

WOW! This was amazing!! The only changes I made were adding about a teaspoon of garlic to the honey mustard mix as well as adding some salt and pepper. I took the advice of another reviewer and tasted the mixture before putting it on the salmon. Great tip!
Definitely will be making again. Thanks Esmee!

I made this for my parents last night. I crossed my fingers and held my breath until they tried it because they don't like "sweet'n sour" food. They both loved it. The flavors worked well together; neither overpowered the other. I did make a few changes though. I used maple syrup in place of the honey, panko bread crumbs, and no parsley. I left it in the oven about 5 more minutes to get a toastier crust.

This was amazing, and i don't normally like salmon.  I omitted the pecans because I didn't have them - they weren't missed at all.  Then I didn't read the directions and ended up dipping the salmon in the mustard mixture and then completely breading it in the breadcrumbs & fresh parsley.  The result was a very moist and flavorful piece of fish.  This recipe is a keeper ... Will make it again.

Normally I don't like sweet food, especially on fish. However, this recipe  was perfect for salmon. I used Targets salmon (defrosted), Morehouse Classic Dijon mustard, Target brand honey, and unsalted butter.  In addition, I used Panko bread crubs seasoned with crushed pecans, creole seasoning and dried parsley flake.  Other than that I followed the insturctions.  My husband also liked that there was no fishy salmon taste.  Enjoy with Quinoa and veggies!

My dad loves salmon but my mom cant even stand the smell. I cooked this for my dad one day and my mom couldn't even tell I was cooking fish, she loved the smell so much she tried it and liked it. I never had the stomach for fish either but I loved it cooked this way. and my dad said he has never had better and begs for it now!!!

Loved it. Made a couple changes after the first time--used 1 tsp worth of fresh tarragon mixed into the mustard sauce instead of parsley because I love a dijon/tarragon combo & not a big fan of parsley. Smothered the salmon in the sauce rather than lightly brushing it, and used panko bread crumbs.

I thought this was delicious!  I have never breaded salmon before and I really enjoyed the texture.  I reduced the butter by half just to make it healthier and it was still good.  I also followed the other reviews and basted/breaded both sides of the de-scaled fish!  Will definitely make again!

This is one of the best recipes I've tried in a long time.  I served it with the Pecan Rice recipe from allrecipes.com and wilted spinach.  Even though I goofed and added twice as much pecans (got the two recipes temporarily mixed up), my husband was tempted to go back for thirds.  I will definitely be making this again.

This was great!  My fiance and I both loved it.  Our wedding caterer made us a sample of salmon with wasabi aioli which was the best piece of salmon we've ever had, and this recipe was nearly as tasty.  I substituted dried parsley and used panko crumbs.

It is so nice to find a recipe that calls for things you typically have on hand, and when combined, make a delicious meal. Although I did not have pecans on hand, I substituted with chopped walnuts. I can't wait to try it with pecans next time!

I made this again tonight and upped my rating to 4 stars.  I think this is really good and simple.  I didn't melt the butter, just blended it with the mustard and honey.  I would serve this to anyone who came to my home.

This was really good-and a hit with my 6 year old picky eater too. (And easy enough that she made this part of supper with just a little guidance.) We used a heavy hand with the honey mustard and added a dash of lemon juice to the mustard mix and thought it turned out perfectly.

The top part of the salmon fillet tasted good, but the rest of the fillet was very bland. I think the crust didn't taste too bad either, but I had to add some mustard aside and dipped the fillet into it as I ate so as not to have a bland piece of salmon. I honestly wouldn't try this recipe again. My husband rated it as a 2/5, but I think I liked it a tad better than he did, so gave it a 3.

I thought that this was easy and wonderful.  As a native North-westerner I must have had salmon every way possible!  Why complicate things when it is such a good fish to start with.  This recipe hit the spot and I bet it would be a hit with the pickier eaters.

I couldn't believe how easy and delicious this was!! I substituted finely chopped walnuts for the pecans and panko bread crumbs for extra crunch. Loved the balance of sweet and tangy. My husband thought it was good enough for company. Thanks for sharing an excellent recipe!

This was absolutely outstanding. If you gave this dish any less than a 5 you definitely did not follow the receipe. My son and I enjoyed it, even my 10 month old loved bits and pieces of the fish. All smiles here.

Ihad to make two changes to this recipe: First, we have nut allergies in our home so the nuts were not used. Second, we just added about a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash Garlic and herb to the bread crumbs instead of the herbs listed. This turned out wonderfully for our family and will definitely be added to our roatation.

My family rated this at an average of 4.5, I bumped that up to a 5 because this is very easy to prepare and can be done in a short amount of time. I will make again although I may season it a little differently using the herbs that my family prefers. Thank you for a fine dish.

I left out the nuts as I can't eat any nuts. Bread it on both sides, then in oven. Came out perfect with nice n pink inside & not to done. Nice & moist. Those of you that live near a Whole Foods, they have great wild Salmon.

This was great! I added a little extra butter to both the wet and dry mixture based on other reviews and it was great. I did add a 1/4tsp of cayenne, probably could have used more since I could not taste it. I also used dried parsley cuz it's all I had. For the nuts I had a package of pecan/peanuts and it tasted great! I also did not go light on any of the ingredients. I smothered the fish in the wet and dry and my husband LOVED it...and he is not a big fan of salmon. I will make again but next time want to add fresh lemon. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is GREAT!!! I made this tonight for my family and they loved it! The only thing I did different was coated the whole salmon with honey mustard mixture and the bread crumb mixture. So the salmon was covered with both mixtures. I will be making this again very soon.

Made this with Sockeye Salmon and served with Chardonnay, this dish is amazing!!  Favorite salmon preparation.  I only needed half the butter/mustard/honey mixture and reducing the amount also saves on calories.

yummy. i worry that the hard crunch of the pecan doesn't pair well with the lite and flaky salmon. However, the flavor from the pecan is wonderful with the honey dijon mixture.

Didn't have fresh parsley or pecans, so I just used a generic Italian seasoning blend. Still an incredibly simple (my 1st time cooking salmon) and delicious recipe..flavor stays good even when reheated

sooooo delicious and so quick and easy with minimal ingredients.   I use Cinnamon Spiced Pecans...it adds a little something special. And, we have fresh green beans and couscous as our sides. Might I suggest Liberty School Syrah, to wash it all down? :)   Bon Appetit!

This was very bland.  I couldn't taste any of the honey/mustard.  Next time I would probably put more honey and not coat "lightly" but maybe pour the rest of the marinade over the salmon.

I made this meal last night for dinner and it was great.  My husband couldn't get enough and the idea of placing the sauce on the salmon after it's cooked was a great one.  I added flavored rice and broccoli, the meal was quick and very good. I will definitely bake this again and I am not a lover of salmon but this recipe will make me eat it more often!

This was awesome; definitely a recipe I will use again.  Good enough for company, too. I did find there to be a little too much sauce for 4 filets so I would either cut the sauce ingredients in half or cook twice as much salmon!

I tried this recipe for the first time last night.  It was fantasstic!  The only complaint that I receved was that I didn't make enough for seconds.  I used walnuts because I didn't have pecans on hand.  It was still great.  I can't wait to make it agian!

Wonderful! I used Jack Daniels mustard/honey dijon. I made way too much of the breading but I also didn't measure. Paired with sauteed broccoli and onions and cous cous...wonderful!

This is a great, easy way to prepare salmon. I didn't have bread crumbs or pecans on hand so I topped it with wheat germ and parsley. I will try it with wheat germ and pecans next time.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I had only a few filets, but basically I took all the ingredients and eyeballed it. I used more honey than mustard after reading others' comments as I don't like things TOO mustardy and the sweet sounded goo with the fish. I sprayed the pyrex dish with cooking spray, set the fish down, put the mixture on first then sprinkled a generous about of crumbs and parsley on top and added the pecans and an extra drizzle of honey. I coated the top with more cooking spray because I find this helps everything stay moist.  I found it to be a really nice change from my normal sage or basil salmon.

The dijon and the honey are a great combination.We are not big salmon lovers so I used Tilapia instead and it was super. Next time for our own personal preference I will up the dijon and lessen the butter. Thank You for Sharing

I really liked my salmon baked like this and I'm not a real big fish fan.  I just had to add a little garlic to the mix and I let the salmon marinate in the sauce for a while.  The salmon came out moist and very flavorful without overpowering the natural taste of the fish.  I loved the hint of sweetness with the zest of the mustard.  Next time I will use my homemade mustard with horseradish!

I made this for dinner guests on short notice, and everyone liked it. I left out the parsley (didn't have it) and the pecans (allergies). Would definitely make again - though I'd half the recipe (have lots left over) and would probably leave out the bread crumbs, just for my own personal taste.

I didn't follow this exactly, but it still turned out great. Instead of breadcrumbs and pecan, I put almonds, cashews, parsley, cilantro and dill in a food processor. I also finished off with a bit of lemon juice after the salmon was done baking. I ran out of dijon, so I used a bit of regular mustard with (food processed) peprocinis. It was delicious.

Was very good!  I used panko instead of bread crumbs for extra crunch.  Next time I will make extra sauce for dipping.

I was really worried to try this since I'm not a mustard fan and that one top bad review, but it came out great!  I didn't change a thing and we enjoyed it.  Will be making this more often for sure!

I know a lot of people rated this highly, but I thought that it was only average at best. Not terrible, but I won't make it again.

This was pretty tasty.  I didnt have dijon so I used hot sweet mustard.  I also halved the sauce and it was plenty.

This was delicious and I will definitely make this again and again. I didn't have any pecans on hand, so I omitted those and I also used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, but I followed all other directions to the T and loved the end result!!!

an easy and fast recipe, thus the three stars.  But for this family it seems to be  a dish for those who don't care for the taste of salmon -- something I should have realized when I saw the ingredients.

This may be my favorite salmon recipe ever. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I may do different next time is brush a little more of the honey/dijon/butter mixture on the salmon because I think I went too lightly on it. But, this recipe will definitely go in my permanent file.

My boyfriend loove the texture of the pecans mixed with the bread.  And the sweet taste made by adding the honey made this dish amazing! I will for sure make it again thank you! :)

delicious recipe for salmon. i'm knocking off one start because the salmon came out a little dry and the taste was pretty strong and overwhelming. next time, i'll put less of the glaze and i'll pull back on the parsly a bit.

Good recipe and easy to make.  Didn't give a full five stars because I was measuring it up to my favorite salmon recipes one that I usually grill and the other has leeks.  I followed this recipe exactly but felt like it needed something.  I guess I was expecting "something" more with the pecans and dijon but was a bit disappointed.  The next time I think I'll spread the dijon mix all over the fish and  I should have had a squeeze of lemon on the side, that may have made a difference.  Thank you for the recipe though.  My dad had 2 helpings and everyone else really enjoyed it.

I have made this recipe several times, it is now my favorite way to prepare salmon. If you don't have pecans on hand it is still very delicious. And last time I was out of breadcrumbs so substituted crackermeal - yum, yum!! My husband really liked it too. Thanks!

Yum!  I've made this three times now, and this is one of the fam's favorites!  Quick to prep, even for a newbie cook like me, and it comes out great without any tweaks.  I double the topping bc everyone loves it.

I think this recipe is wonderful!  My entire family loved it.  The only thing I changed was the amount of topping...this recipe makes way too much.  I cut it in half and the salmon was perfect!  I don't know how anyone could say this recipe is bland.

I tried this recipe based on my aunt's recommendation (who is an excellent cook).  I really love this dish.  All the flavors compliment eachother really well.  The second time I made it I left out the pecans and I actually liked it a little better.  Definitely squeeze some lemon on the fish when you serve it!

Best salmon I have ever eaten. I left the pecans kind of bigger, and really slathered on the honey dijon mixture. I let it sit for awhile and when I made it the filets were buttery, creamy, and delicious. I'm not a fan of parsley but I used it anyway, it was alright but I feel as if I would omit it in the future.

This was great. I made a few tweaks: I used boneless, SKINLESS salmon (from Sam's club - note: none of the "high-end" gorcery stores e.g. Whole Foods sell affordable skinless salmon). This wiped out the "yucky fish" faction of my family who all loved the final result. I also chopped two tablespoons of fresh tarragon from my garden and mixed it with the Dijon before spreading on the fish (this put it over the top). I also added a little garlic powder and fresh ground pepper to the bread crumbs to give them a little zip.

This was certainly delicious, but as a recipe, I have to knock it a little bit. It's a bit bland. If you take a nice fresh salmon fillet and top it with bread crumbs, parsley, dijon, and plenty of butter, then it darn well better taste good! How could it not? I guess I'd have appreciated something with either a bit more flavor or a bit less fat. Still, though, if you want a very solid and guaranteed-to-please, traditional recipe, this will do the trick.

This was soooo yummmy!  The only thing I'd do different next time would be to put a little less of the sauce on the fish - we used less fish than the recipie called for so we spread the sauce on pretty thick, it's really flavorful so I don't really think it needed so much on it.

This really is wonderful.  I used Dijonnaise for a little added moisture, panko bread crumbs, and finely chopped pecans.  Next time I may try crushed Ritz crackers and finely chopped almonds.  A keeper!  Thanks!

Our favorite salmon recipe ever. I used regular old French's mustard and roasted almonds, and it was totally phenomenal. Great with roasted potatoes and French green beans. Not fishy at all! Delicious.

We dont like pecans and I forgot to get a lemon at the store. But even without those items, this recipe had us drooling. I used a creamy dijon style mustard. Wonderful recipe for fresh caught Alaskan Red salmon. Thanks from Alaska!

Perfect taste.  It was also a hit when I brought it to a pot-luck event.  I used olive oil instead of butter to be healthier, added chopped walnuts to keep it moist, and I seasoned the breadcrumbs to my liking. Yummy.

I made this with salmon and catfish. They were both delish.  I added cayenne to the sauce before brushing over the fish for an extra kick. I think I might try this on shrimp and scallops, too.  Thanks for the fantastic recipe.

i have now made this a few times and am upgrading to 5 stars. every time i make this, the table is quiet except for mmmm noises. i have never had anyone say they didnt like it, most people rave about how amazing it is. the honey mustard is the best ive ever tasted, and ill use it in other recipes from now on. i make double the sauce and save half for dipping. i leave out the nuts. otherwise, recipe is the exact same and it is perfect. thanks!

Delicious! I used panko instead of breadcrumbs, but I'm sure with breadcrumbs it's just as good. Also used some lemon juice before coating w/panko.

Even though I am not a fish eater, this was the best tasting fish recipe! Every single time I make this, everybody in my family is drooling for more! Make sure you use country Dijon mustard only. If you use any other type, the recipe will come out tasting weird. I also take the skin off the fish so it won't be a hassle to take off later. Definitely a keeper!

I've been making this for about 5 years now, and we never tire of it. It's our favorite way to cook salmon. I follow the recipe as written except I use a whole fillet instead of individual 4 oz pieces. Last night I tried it substituting boneless, skinless chicken breasts for the salmon. It was very good, but we all agreed that we prefer the salmon. (I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/3 in. and cooked them at 350 for 40 mins.)

I thought this was very good, but not EXCELLENT.  I used panko bread crumbs- may have been better with some kind of flavored bread crumbs.  I omitted the pecans as hubby doesn't like nuts.  Very quick and easy.  Would make this again,especially when it isn't grilling weather.

This was really good. I'm not the biggest fan of salmon, but I really enjoyed this. I didn't have any parsley, but I did use Italian bread crumbs. Just the right amount of sweetness and, with fresh lemon squeezed on after it's cooked, it is a wonderful mixture of sweet and tang! As another reviewer said, it does take away some of the fishiness of salmon, which is okay in my books!

This is an easy, yummy way to make salmon.  I followed the instructions completely except I left off the nuts, and I don't think it took away from the taste at all by doing so.  Glad I read a couple of ratings because I would've been tempted to use a honey mustard rather than honey AND mustard.  Sweet and tangy and light.  Aces!

Great recipe!  Omitted parsley,pecans (didn't have any on hand) and salt.  Used margarine and italian breadcrumbs.  Layered the sauce and breadcrumbs twice then baked for 17 minutes. Came out vey moist and tasty!  This is my third time trying this recipe and each time I try something a little different, but it's always good!

I did thoroughly enjoy this salmon recipe, however the only problem I had is that it needed a lot more of the Dijon sauce! I'm just beginning to cook and this was simple, straightforward, and came out looking great! If you like the fishy taste of Salmon then follow the directions to a T. If not, then adding a few extra coats of the dressing will make all the difference in the world and will make a nice, but not overwhelming, compliment to the dish. Very, very nice.

This was mediocre.  I had high hopes, but the honey flavor came through stronger than I would have liked.  Ended up tasting more like honey mustard than anything else.  Wasn't terrible, but for the price, I'd prepare salmon differently next time.

Pretty good! I also added some mustard powder to the dry mix to add a little more mustardy kick. I really like how this doesn't overpower the salmon. If it was any stronger, it would be too overpowering. Nice, simple recipe!

My boyfriends mother makes a similar dish with the bread crumbs, and I really like it. But I wanted to try something different and saw this recipe. OMG, this is my new favorite salmon dish. I followed the recipe but I used dried parsley and instead of plain dijon mustard I used a habanero dijon because my boyfriend LOVES everything spicy! So good. Thanks for sharing it.

I LOVELOVELOVE salmon and wanted something quick for dinner, so I tried this recipe. DEE-LICIOUS!!! I didn't have dijon mustard, so I used sweet vidalia onion mustard, and it was excellent. The only thing is, next time I make it, I might half the amount of butter; I don't think it needed quite so much. And cut back just a tad on the bread crumbs. I baked it a little longer than 15 minutes because of the thickness of the fillet. I ate it with some fresh steamed asparagus, and it was YUMMY! Even my cat wanted some! Thanks!

I was disappointed and found that this recipe really didn't add much flavor at all - it was just smeared over the fish but it was still just fish.

Amazing.  I had wanted to make the macademia encrusted salmon (also excellent and on this site), but my fiance couldn't find the right nuts.  This was the back-up and even better than the other recipe.

This was very good and easy! My husband and son (who is only 2 years old) really enjoyed this. I had a 1-inch piece of salmon, so the cooking time was a bit longer. This recipe is a keeper!

Mustard often over powers the flavor of Salmon but in this case it was perfect. We had no dijon so I used horseradish mustard....i bet the dijon tastes a little better. I have kids who don't eat pecans yet so I cooked them in the skillet with a bit of sugar and water and put them on the side. I cooked a half of salmon, using the serving of 4 suggested on the main page. I upped the bread by a bit, but it wasn't necessary. Thank you for the recipe!

Yummo! This recipe has over a thousand reviews and hold 4 and a half stars...ignore any bad reviews. this recipe is well worth trying. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using fresh parsley, I only had dried. And since my salmon was already skinned I coated the entire piece rather then just as a topping. Don't be afraid of the few bad review they probably did something wrong cause this truly is a great recipe. I will most certainly make it again!

This was a little too overpowering for the Salmon. I made it exactly as written, sans pecans.  I did half of my salmon I had with this recipe and the other half I used a lemon/dill marinade from A-1, which we all felt was a better compliment for the fish. I will not be making this recipe again.

This was actually the first time I had ever had Salmon.  I did not have any Pecans on hand so I used crushed almonds.  This was delicious.  My husband also loved it.  I do not think I would order Salmon at a resturant, but I will make this again at home.

Great starter recipe but definitely needs some tweaking to make the taste pop.  I would definitely up the dijon to 5 tablespoons and use this honey mustard sauce to marinate the salmon for at least 30 min to an hour.  Instead of dry bread crumbs, try using shake and bake flavors.  I like the cajun mix but use whatever suits your tastebuds.  I would definitely use more parsley and finely diced.  Pecans are terrific and you should not skip out on it since it adds a great nutty flavor.  Make these changes and you'll definitely increase the flavor.

My husband and I thought this recipe is fantastic!  For those who thought that there wasn't enough flavor, there are "bold and spicy" or other varieties of dijon mustard that might oomph it up.  I'm not a huge fan of mustard, so I used equal amounts of dijon mustard and honey, and it was perfect for me.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I was a little skeptical to make this b/c of some of the reviews. I also was concerned to flavors would overpower the salmon-I usually just mainade it. However! I thought this was so very good! I followed recipe exactly-except didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried-and it was wonderful! I cannot wait to make this dish again!!!! Watch out, you may get addicted to this one!

I followed this recipe exactly. My husband loved it. My kids & I did not. My son & I came to the conclusion, there was to much ingredents on top, which hid the taste of the salmon. We especially did not like the honey (too sweet tasting for fish) and the pecans were way "to much". Although my husband liked it. I don't think I will make it again.

I make this often, just as written. The flavors blend beautifully with so few ingredients and it cooks up fast. Dried parsely works fine if you don't have fresh.

I made this for lunch today with one big filet and hubby and I both loved it. It was very easy! I used panko crumbs, so it came out quite crispy, which we liked.  The flavor was milder than I expected, especially since I did not "brush lightly" with the sauce as directed, but it was still delicious!  We enjoyed it with some steamed broccoli and brown rice.  I will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe.  My husband doesn't like Salmon so I actually put half of the mixture over a chicken breast and cooked it the same way and it turned out great.  He even tasted my fish and thought it was pretty good for Salmon.  Maybe next time I will do all fish.

I was out of bread crumbs and had to substitute cashews for the pecans, and it still turned out great!  Received plenty of compliments and requests to make it again.  I was really looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch the next day, but there weren't any!

This was really, really tasty.  I did cook a little longer but I was using 6 pieces of fish.  I also pulled the skin off first (are you supposed to?  Eww...) Very elegant tasting and even the non-fish lovers in my house enjoyed it.  Thanks for a nice, healthy alternative (without using the butter, of course)!

very yummy!!  I substituted white sugar for honey.  Usually, when doing this you substitue 2:1, so I doubled the volume to get the same amount of sweetness.  However, I found that a tad too sweet, next time I will substitute the same volume of sugar as the honey is called for. Still Wonderful!!

This is to die for. It's an excellent dish for entertaining. Very quick and easy but it looks very elegant and the taste is amazing. I made this for a dinner party and everyone told me afterward that I needed to open my own catering business. Try it! You'll love it!

Good, but too rich!  I didn't use the pecans (didn't have any), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I'd go with less butter...or maybe just a basting with olive oil instead.  It take the healthy out of eating fish, and my husband liked the flavor it imparted BUT scraped all the dijon glaze off the top.

Wow!  This was better than some restaurant salmon I've had.  I only had spicy brown mustard and dried parsley.  I used two tablespoons of the mustard instead of the called for three and a heaping teaspoon of the dried parsley.  My husband, someone who usually doesn't like honey-mustard flavored things, LOVED this recipe.  This will be my new standby for salmon!

Got a nice fresh Coho Salmon steak and decided to use this recipe. Followed it to a T and were very pleased with the outcome. We also used this on Tillapia fillets and our kids really eat them up. Even our picky eater ate the whole fillet. I like my fish very rare, my wife like it medium so we found that the cooking directions were perfect for rare fish. If you like it more done you may have to cook it longer. You may also want to try broiling it.

I look forward to having this again!

I loved this my family however still prefers salmon drowned in butter- yuck. I thought the flavors were fantastic! I used honey mustard as well honey so it might be on the sweeter side.

I've been making this recipe for years.  I haven't made it in a while and my husband asked for it.  I normally just use Italian bread crumbs and leave out the pecans (normally we don't have them).  I also pour the extra honey dijon on top before baking.

Used crushed Ritz - no nuts.  Maybe cut back on butter next time - not sure it needs that much.  Very tastey - my husband loved it.

Excellent, sweet flavor!  I used Italian bread crumbs and dried parsley flakes, as that is what I had on hand; scaled back on the butter, and added some lemon juice to the mustard mixture.

really good, EASY way to prepare salmon.  we used a little extra honey as my boyfriend brought spicy mustard instead of dijon and I wanted the extra sweetness to compensate (since I don't particularly enjoy a strong mustard flavor).  we'll definitely make this again.  thanks for sharing!

A very simple, easy to make weeknight family meal.  A nice winter salmon recipe when I can't use the grill (which is my preferred method for preparing salmon).  This one is a good staple recipe.

The butter, honey, mustard mixture is delicious and the nuts give the topping a nice crunch. I am not really a salmon fan, but after eating this I will definitely make again.

Very easy to make, even for an amateur like myself. Used multigrain crumbs that added to the nutty texture of the coating. My wife thought it was too nutty but I liked it. Have also used macadamia nuts instead of pecans, but that seems to take a little longer to cook.

I've made this several times and it's delicious. All I had were almonds instead of pecans so I crushed them up and they worked really well.  I found it comes out best if you spread the sauce generously over the fish before you bake it. You may want to double the amount of sauce if you want extra for side dishes such as rice and veggies.

This was pretty good!  It was a little "mustardy" in some parts, but the fish came out perfectly (though I cooked it slightly longer than indicated).

This recipe was very, very good. I used a good dijon mustard and raw honey, and pasted it on rather thickly instead of just brushing it on. I also used crushed almonds instead of pecans since I didn't have any, which turned out fine. The end result was flavorful and tasty, and blended well with the oiliness of the salmon. Even my picky husband who doesn't like strong fish liked this dish. I'll be making it again!

We normally always marinade our salmon in a home made teriyaki sauce, but were looking for a change.  We were not disappointed!  This was very good and a nice change!

I absolutely adored this recipe, and so did everyone else.  The bread crumbs were a really nice touch, and a new experience for my salmon cooking.  Like most, I was shy with the Dijon Honey mixture, and will add more next time, but that isn't the recipes fault, it's mine.  It was amazing, still.  I used oranges as garnish, due to lack of lemons, and it was just as gorgeous, not to mention tasty.  Excellent recipe!

This was easy and very tasty.  I probably went a little heavy on the honey, so next time, I will try harder to get the 2 to 1 ratio of mustard to honey.  I also spread on the mixture, then poured on the crumb/pecans.  I finished it under the broiler, but did not keep an eye on it, so I scraped off a thin layer of the crumbs that were a bit dark (black)and it was still delicious.  I used italian breadcrumbs, cause I didn't have plain and left out the parsley.  Will definitely make again.

When you get compliments on a recipe without asking that says alot! Everyone really liked the flavor of this. And the crunch from the pecans yum. The salmon was so tender. My only suggestion would be that you don't need all the honey/mustard butter that the recipe calls for. So just cut back some. And the cooking time was perfect. Sooo good.

I have made this twice now and it is really a simple recipe with excellent results. You  can add ingredients, substitute, etc. but if you just follow the recipe exactly as described you will be well rewarded.

This was good, but I think it would be better over a different kind of fish.  Trout maybe?

so so easy!  It had such a great flavor too.  I think next time I will put more of the dijon sauce on it.  I was scared to put too much on it, but ended up that I wanted more of that taste when we were eating it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is absolutely fantastic way to prepare salmon!  I've made it several time, both for my family and guests, and it is a HUGE HIT! It is so delicious, and looks like something you'd get in a very fine restaurant!  I highly recommend this!

This recipe was okay.. I have been searching for new salmon recipes and this one had good reviews so I thought I would try it. Also my husband doesn't like sweet, but he says his favorite salmon recipe is still Grilled Salmon I. I made this recipe exactly as it states but my husband and I didn't love it. It was ok.

This recipe has changed my mind on salmon.  I would usually make salmon for my husband and another fish for myself.  I am now able to enjoy eating salmon again.  The sauce is also good on other fish.  Also, a really simple and quick way to make a nice dinner.

We really really liked this recipe.  We left out the honey as we don't like sweet stuff, but it was delicious. The fish was very moist and tender, and it was very easy to prepare. This is a real keeper.

Everyone loved this! No wonder the reviews are so good, this is easy and tasty. Our honey had crystalized in the jar, and was very thick (we shouldn't have bought such a large bottle of it). I used it anyway (and found out online that it's OK to use). The thick honey actually helped, made the sauce thicker and it stuck well to the fish. Instead of brushing the sauce on, I used a spatula to spread it on like a paste - worked great.

This was really quick and easy to make. I modified the recipe based on my own preferences (lite soy sauce instead of butter) and what I had at home (regular mustard; sugared almonds instead of pecans; italian seasoned breadcrumbs) and it still came out great.
We eat a ton of seafood at my house and are always looking for a different preparation that doesn't take a lot of time. This will definitely be put in the regular rotation.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! Preparation time is really short and it looks and tastes great! Definitely makes a difference to have the actual Dijon mustard and honey not just some honey-mustard. My husband loved it too!

Already started making the recipe when I realized I was out of Dijon mustard - so used yellow mustard instead. And only had Italian seasoned bread crumbs on hand. But it was very tasty and I can't wait to make it again!

YUM!!!  That pretty much sums up this one!  Hubby and I both loved this recipe...the pecans mixed with the breadcrumbs made an ncredible 'crust'.  The only change I made was to scale down the recipe as I was only cooking 3 small salmon filets, cut all ingredients in half and there was plenty for each piece!  Great recipe!

This was my first allrecipes recipe.  I was trying to get my husband to eat the salmon that had been in the freezer for months....HE LOVED IT!  Even my two and four year old boys will eat it.  I make it exactly how the recipe reads and it turns out great.  If you want to impress ANYONE make this dish.

For those with a sweet tooth I pour a little honey and lemon over the finished dish.  AWSOME!!!

This was very yummy! Im traditionally just lemon juice on my fish kind of gal but this was great! The pecans were a nice touch. My husband doesn't like nuts in his food at all and he even liked it!! He was surprised as well!! Thank you!

My kids ate a little bit if this.  Which is good considering they are picky eaters.  I loved the flavors of the honey, mustard, and lemon.

Fantastic.  My husband was recently diagnosed with high cholesterol, so I've been searching for tasty fish recipes.  Used Becel instead of butter.  Didn't have plain dijon, so I used honey dijon mustard instead.  Didn't have any pecans, so just made the recipe without.  Was so delicious.  Next time, will add the pecans to make it even better.

Really tasty!  I used a dollop of honey dijon instead of honey and mustard, and I used dry parsley.  The topping was a bit crunchy, and the fish was very moist.  It was super-easy to prepare, and we liked it a lot.  I will make this again!

I made this recipe by the book but I didn't really like it even though my bf loved it.. so I decided to change a few things after getting some ideas from the reviews here. I didn't use any breadcrumbs and changed the pecans to walnuts(so 1/2 cup walnuts) and I also used 1/2 dijon mustard and 1/2 horseradish mustard. After changing those things, it turned out perfect and was divine! And the good thing is my bf still loves it! I eat this with steamed buttered-asparagus.. Yum!

This recipe was the bomb! I love honey mustard sauces but this one beats them all. I had forgoten to defrost my salmon before baking it so it took almost 45 minutes to bake. 
   Next time I make this I will try letting it marinade for a couple of hours, as other reviewers suggested. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe was good, especially if you enjoy the honey-dijon flavor.  Caution: I used Grey-Poupon and it seemed to have a lot of salt in it, so it was not necessary to add salt the pecan/bread crusting.

This was very tasty!!! I did a couple things diff...With the honey mustard I added some lemon juice and dill and marinated it for 3 hours or so. Than I used almonds instead of pecans. You can really use any nut. The only thing I would of done differenly is cook for like 13 mins instead of 15. This a def a keeper!!

If your salmon is a bit thick, add an extra 10 minutes of cooking time. Otherwise, the recipe worked out perfectly! The next time, I'll use ground pecans instead of chopped.

Outstanding!  I marinated the salmon in the butter, honey and mustard for aprox 30 minutes.  Then I breaded the salmon and baked for 20 minutes.  My kids even loved this salmon!

Delicioso!  This is now one of my favorite salmon recipes.  I set aside honey mustard before brushing on salmon for salad to accompany salmon.  Can't wait to make this for guests.

This is a GREAT way to prepare fish for people who "don't like fish".  My two boys (ages 2 & 4) could not get enough of this.  They begged for seconds!

It is wonderful especially atop some greens for a nice light meal.  A definite keeper.

I prepared the recipe "as is" and it came out wonderfully.  The boyfriend loved the meal (although he'll almost eat any kind of fish made any kind of way!).  I didn't rave about it as much as I thought it could use a pinch more flavoring.  Next time around, I'll try some of the previous suggestions to spice up the recipe and see what happens next, but I'll definitely use it again!  Very simple and easy to make, it takes some of the mystery out of making fish.  Thank you so much for the base!

Honestly, this was the best salmon recipe I have ever made!!! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! I ate it sooo slow just so I could enjoy every bite. It was incredibly easy to make and it only took a few minutes to bake. I'm a poor college student and this recipe was so affordable and easy!!!! I recommend it!!!

This recipe was alright. Maybe it was the salmon maybe its me but this didn't come out as well as I'd hoped. Plus my kitchen smelled of fish for DAYS. But like I said, maybe it was a bad fillet.

I usually don't like salmon, but I love this recipe. As suggested by others, I drizzled the leftover sauce over the topping just before baking.

Very Tasty and easy! We did cut down on the honey as we love mustard, but it was quick to make.

This really tasted good. At first I wasnt sure after reading the reviews but its very tasty. I added a few of my own spices to the salmon (salt, pepper) but other than that I made it to the recipe..I would advise to cut down on the bread crumbs. You dont need that much..

Yum.. This was an excellent recipe. I made this dish for a dinner party and it was the hit of the party. I marinated the dish with the sauce over night (I melted the butter and mixed in the mustard and honey) It was fantastic. I will being making this again.

I've been trying to find a good fish recipe and this definitely fit the bill.  Very good flavor.  The only modification I made was to eliminate the chopped fresh parsley because I forgot to buy it.

THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC.  I'VE TRIED IT OUT ON MY CHILDREN AND FRIENDS AND THEY ALL LOVED IT!!  I MADE A FEW SUBSTITUTIONS AS I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BREAD CRUMBS.  I USED RITZ CRACKERS INSTEAD AND WALNUTS INSTEAD OF THE PECANS.  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!

I've made a lot of salmon recipes, but this one has taken the top spot on my list.  Truly delicious.  I'd like to try substituting the 1/4 cup of butter with Olive oil, or some other heart healthy oil.

Really great flavor combo.  Don't leave out the pecans b/c that and the honey mustard mix so well together.  Also,spray the baking dish with pam to avoid sticking.

Wow, this was by far one of the best reviewed dinners I have ever made! I doubled the dijon and honey and used garlic & herb bread crumbs; instead of "lightly brushing" the fillets in the mustard mix I used my hands to thoroughly coat them in the honey  mustard and then the bread crumbs/parsley (left out the nuts.) The result was a nicely breaded salmon fillet that was crunchy on the outside and moist and delicious on the outside. I served it with some rice and the broccoli w/garlic sauce that's on this site. My family loved it - will definitely make again and again (and again!)

DELICIOUS!  I made this last night for a relative that was coming to dinner and she was very impressed.  She even called me this morning to compliment me again on last nights dinner.  Next time though, I'll try it with Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain.

My husband & I weren't all that impressed with this dish. Maybe because the salmon had skin on it. It seems the skin gives it a very "fishy" taste. I will give this recipe another shot, but next time I will get salmon without the skin. Hopefully it will be better

This dish was easy to make and it looked pretty, but it tasted just okay. The pieces of fish that I used were quite thick, so that may be why it wasn't as good as others have said.  There was one piece that was much thinner than the others and it was also the tastiest. I probably won't make this again but am glad I tried it.  The next night I made some alfredo sauce from this site and tossed it with noodles and the leftover salmon and that was really good! The pecans added a really nice touch with the pasta.

I made this with grainy country style dijon and it came out great.  Be sure to watch the cooking time based on the size of your fillets as mine took a little under 15 mins to cook.  This was so quick and so easy and the best part is that there is no clean up!

This was very good.  We are trying to eat more fish, and I can say I will make this again.  The only thing I will do differently is to cut the honey/dijon/butter mixture ingredients in half, and I think there will be plenty to spread a thin layer over the fillets.  (I ended up throwing away some of it.)  Thanks for sharing.

Nice and easy. I didn't have any pecans so I made it without. Used a bit of mayo instad of the butter and added some fresh dill.

Good recipe Arnie, BUT where is the direction on what to bake it on??  Of course I knew, but for those out there who don't...it could be messy.  Any hoo, I softened the butter and mixed the bread crumbs right into that mixture for easier brushing.  The pecans are a must...if baked right, they will "pop" in your mouth and compliment the salmon.  Thanks!!

This recipe is wonderful. I've made it many times. My husband (who before this recipe never even liked salmon) requests it often. I've made it for company too, with rave reviews. Everything in this recipe combines perfectly. Every bite just seems to melt in your mouth, but yet there is that slightly sweet crunch of the pecan topping. One thing I add is some fresh lemon juice drizzled generously right over the top of the fish just before serving. It brings out the flavors even more.

I thought this was kind of a weird flavor combination...the salmon with honey mustard.  Also, the nut mixture turned out a little soggy instead of crisping up. But my husband liked it! I'll probably just stick with my usual salmon method: salt and pepper and a drizzle of olive oil.

This was okay.  My boyfriend liked it but I didn't finish mine.  I thought the mustard flavor would be stronger but it was very faint.  I'll try making it again and add more seasoning and maybe buy fresher fish.

these were pretty good. i thought that perhaps it had a bit too much of a mustard flavor. i ended up baking them in foil for about 7 mins covered, then uncovered them and added the topping. i also broiled them for a minute to help crisp up the topping.

I've been looking for a good salmon recipe and finally found it. I didn't have parsley so I used Italian bread crumbs and almonds instead of pecans. I put a lot of honey mustard and bread crumbs on the salmon since I had a lot leftover. The blending of the honey, mustard and butter was very tasty--not sweet at all. It is so good, I will try this on chicken and pork chops.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was such a tasty salmon recipe.  I used some beautiful Sockeye salmon and it turned out so good.  My boyfriend raved about it to his family and now they are begging me to make it for them.  This is a keeper.

This recipe leaves something to be desired. I found it to be just ok..nothing special. It did turn out very moist..the only thing the recipe has going for it. I didn't think the dijon did any favors for this recipe. The breading gets very soggy, and it needs a serious flavor kick in the gills. If I was to make this again, and I might...I would use honey mustard and give it some garlic powder and onion powder and a kick of  "Essence". It needs to be kicked up a notch or two.

I used just over a pound of Alaskan salmon and it seemed that I had too much sauce as well as bread crumb mixture with the given amounts from the recipe.  I kept putting it on and ended up throwing out a little of both.  I was affraid it would over power the salmon flavor but it was very good.  Many recipes mask the flavor of the meat but this one complimented it well.  Who would have thought of putting chopped pecans on salmon?  We'll be making this one again.

make sure you don't add too much dijon because it can really overpower the fish.

This was pretty tasty for baked salmon.  I usually make mine on the grill so this was a nice alternative.  I didn't have any pecans so I used pistachios instead and generously brushed on the mustard mixture on the salmon then added the crumb/nut mixture and then poured the rest of the mustard over that.  I needed to bake for more like 20 minutes since I had a thicker cut.  Next time I just might cut down on the honey a tad bit or just buy the honey dijon mustard that is already mixed in a jar.  Was just a hint too sweet and that overpowered the mustard taste I love with my salmon.

My kids and I love fish, my husband is not a fan.  So for him to enjoy this, is high praise indeed.  I'm not sure why some have had problems with it being soggy.  We found it to be moist and flaky.  Also, the nuts add just a hint of flavor, and are really good (and I am not usually a nut fan).  This is my favorite way to cook salmon now, and my husband says it's the first recipe that doesn't 'taste' fishy to him!

My entire family LOVED this recipe.  The family includes a very picky 6 year old!  For us, this was the perfect blend of flavors!  I served it with the Roast Vegetables from All Recipes...again, for us, a perfect blend of flavors.  I used the finely chopped Pecans called "cookie chopped"...they were about the same size as bread crumbs. Both of the recipes (salmon and vegetables)were so easy...easily done when you get home from work! Definitely will make this again!!

Very good, nuts set the salmon off well and the dijon gives it a surprisingly subtle but powerful boost which the honey mellows

Delicious! This recipe gives the salmon a fantastic flavor and doesn't overwhelm and take away from the flavor of the fish.  
Will definitely make again. 
THANKS!!

It goes into my recipe box. Can't wait to try it with other things, maybe chicken?

If you really like salmon this is an awesome recipe, me and my family loved this.  I made it with rice pilaf and sauted yellow and green squash and onions.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  I didn't make a LOT of fish (wished I did), so I had a lot of mustard sauce leftover.  I am planning to use it on chicken, with the breadcrumbs, the same way!  Salmon is my absolute favorite, and I was a bit worried that the mustard might be too much for it.  I made sure it was only a thin layer, and it turned out PERFECT to both my husband's and my tastes!  Thanks for the recipe!

With so many great reviews, how could it not be good.  But....  it was just mediocre.  Love mustard, love honey, love basically every ingredient in the recipe, but the flavors just didn't blend well.  I probably wont make again, but if I did, I would use less dijon and more pecans.  Dijon was overpowering and couldn't even taste the pecans.  Thanks for the recipe though

I'm not a big mustard fan, but this was delicious! So good in fact, I dug right into it without garnishing with salt,pepper, and lemon as suggested. Definitely will make again. Yum!

You can't go wrong, its a very simple recipe, but delicious.  I didn't use the pecans, b/c i'm not a big fan.  I served this on top of mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Loved this recipe!!! Didn't have pecans, so I used ground almonds. I cooked my salmon at 400F instead. I also marinated the salmon for three hours before I put on the crumb mixture. The end result terrific. I will use this one again!!!

i'm not a big fan of salmon (BF is though), but i found this to be a good recipe.  easy preparation and tasty end result.  i followed suggestions of covering with foil for 2/3 the baking time and then uncovering to allow to crisp.  will fine tune the mustard/honey mix a bit more for a bit more of a bite.

I baked them with all the sauce till half cooked, then I took half out, covered with breadcrumbs and baked them again. My kids said the ones without the breadcrumbs tasted better.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Next time I will add more of the honey mustard coating to the salmon.  I also increased the baking time for an additional 10 minutes, although I had thick salmon steaks.

I'm sorry to say this, but I'm really not sharing the love here.  I thought the mustard taste came on just a bit too strong, and it's bitterness overpowered the other flavors.  I like the basic idea of this dish, but I might fool around with the topping and come up with something my family will enjoy.  Thanks!

Made this for company and they couldn't get enough!  I also used some fresh shrimp, which turned out great as well.  Found it extremely easy to prepare.  Wish I had made more-there wasn't any left overs!  The fish was very moist and tender, but it did take a little longer to cook than the recipe stated.  Thanks for this one, it's a new favorite of ours!

Very good recipe. We thought flavours (honey and mustard) could have been stronger, though. I'll try with a flavoured mustard next time.

This was a great recipe! Although I have to admit I cheated and bought stuffed salmon at the grocery store seafood counter and then followed the recipe instructions for the coating. Turned out excellent! Served with fresh steamed broccoli and couscous. Will definitely make this one again!

I did not like this at all.  I think it was the sweetness of the honey that I found unappetizing though my husband loved it.  My daughter ate it after scrapping off the topping and adding enough lemon juice for an entire salmon.  So I rate it down the middle.

Perfect. The flavors were delicious and were subtle enough as to not overpower the taste of the salmon. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was amazing.  I loved the flavor of the pecans with the dijon.  This will become a regular dish at or house.  I also want to try it with chicken (not sure how it will taste but I liked it that much).

This is a great recipe.  I modified it by skipping the bread crumbs and using chopped hazelnuts instead of chopped pecans.

I would have given this 4 stars had i put a thin layer of sauce and coating on my fish, but i made a double batch due to the fact I had a almost 3lb salmon fillet.  We're not real big salmon eaters and I thought all these flavors would be good which they were just too much.  I put all the sauce/crumbs on and should have done less.  it was good, and two of my kids who normally don't eat salmon actually liked it quit a bit after scraping off most of the topping.  I seasoned the fish with lemon pepper and dill and tarragon first.

I am a salmon lover but I thought this recipe was just okay.  I may have put too much of the dijon mixture on the fish and it may have over-powered the taste.  I may try this one more time with less sauce.

YUMMY and EASY!  I grill or sautee salmon steaks often.  This week it just seemed like so much work (especially keeping my toddler out of the way and busy while frying).  I hopped on to allrecipes and discovered this wonderful recipe.  I had everything I needed on hand! (I used tarragon mustardand I had one whole salmon fillet).  I had to double the baking time because of the size of my fish.
Popping this in the oven and being able to enterain my toddler in the kitchen without worrying about fat splatters opened up a whole new world of salmon-steak-cooking for me.  I loved it, DH loved it, and, most importantly, 2-yr-old DS loved it.  Thank you for making a tasty recipe that is easy!

I made this dish for my boyfriend, omg, was he ever amazed. The salmon looked gorgeous. It looked so professional. Might I add, very tasty. The honey/mustard mixture gave the salmon that kick. It melt in our mouth, making us drool all over our plates. Best recipe EVER!!! Thank you for this creation. 
I also added Garlic Mashed Potatoes and butter broccoll to top it off.

Incredible. Very easy to prepare. I didn't measure exactly, just eyeballed the amounts, and I left out the breadcrumbs as several others had said it made the salmon soggy. It turned out perfectly. I think this topping would go well with chicken too.

Thought this was fabulous, restaurant-quality (and I live in Napa Valley).  My husband is not fond of salmon, so I made his portion with cod -- he loved it, but believe me, the salmon was much, much better.

I must admit..I was very skeptical of this recipe before I tried it.  I was pretty impressed! The baking really mellow'd out the flavor of the sauce.  I was afraid it was going to be too mustardy/mayonaisey, but it was actually nice and light when it came out of the oven.

My substitutions:
No pecans, thought I had walnuts, but had to settle for peeled and sliver'd almonds, which i chopped on my cutting board

Used Brummel and Brown instead of butter

Used parsely flakes instead of the fresh kind.  I think next time i'm going to use about 5 or 6 t of flakes.

Used creamy grey pupon dijon instead of the standard kind.

This is my new favorite salmon dish.  Although I modified it b/c I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. (brown sugar for honey, Ritz crackers for bread crumbs, sunflower seeds for pecans, and a dash of cooking rice wine).  I loved it!!

Fantastic. Made it with fresh salmon caught that day out of Lake Michigan. Used lots of salt and pepper and poured the remaining sauce over the filets before serving. Gave recipe to friends and they loved it too.

My husband exclaimed "Delicious!" My daughter and I both thought it was very good (though I still prefer hollandaise sauce on my salmon to this sauce). My son, however, did not care for it much and thought the sauce was too sweet and overpowered the flavor of the salmon. In his words, "salmon should taste like salmon".  The effect of the sauce can be controlled by the amount you brush on.  Next time I will try a lighter coating of the sauce.  It is a very easy and quick recipe to prepare.  I left out the bread crumbs since I didn't have any.  The pecans were a very nice touch.  I served it with a mushroom & herb couscous to which I added lemon juice and sauteed green onions & garlic.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you Arnie!

I was disappointed with this recipe. I expected a wonderful foolproof meal - and things didn't go so well. It took twice as long to cook and the Salmon seemed a little too sweet and not firm enough. The family didn't like it much.

GOURMET!  This is definately something to serve if you want to impress.  And so EASY (I love that).  There was so much sauce left over after brushing the salmon, so I decided to pour the rest over the fish; the man and the youngin' LOVED it.  The kids even asked to eat the leftovers the next day (that NEVER happens with fish)!

Even coating with salt & pepper prior to coating with the honey mustard mix, it wasn't nearly salty enough for our taste, and I'll have to add a bit more next time. That being said, this is my absolute favorite salmon recipe of all time (no substitions!), and I am a true salmon fan. Husband didn't seem crazy about it, so I can't stick it in the weekly rotation, but this is the first time I've found a fish recipe actually good enough to serve guests. MANY thanks for a great dish!

This recipe was not as good as I thought it would be. I did use frozen salmon, which may have affected the taste. I think it would have been better without the crumbs. Next time I will double the honey mustard and try w/o the crumbs. Good but will tinker with it.

Very good.  It tastes very similar to a dish served in one of my favorite bistro-style restaurants. The slightly sweet, buttery, lemon flavor compliments the salmon quite well.

Very tasty although I found the honey mustard flavour a bit too strong.  Didn't use pecans (nut allergy) but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Very quick and easy to make with ingredients already on hand.  Thanks Arnie

Omigod, what can I say?!  This was AMAZING!  I made this last night for the family and my sister, who hates fish, ate it in a flash!  I did have to make the following changes, however, but it was still heavenly!...
1) no pecans, so I made do without them.
2) no parsley either, so I used basil to give it that extra twang.
Highly recommended! YUUUUM!

Absolutely fantastic! I use a whole side of a fish, which can double the cooking time depending on the size. My hubby doesn't like sweet stuff on meats so I omitted the honey, and added a 1/4 cup of diced onion sprinkled over the top. This recipe earned me my first cooking "Wow, this is amazing!". Even my two year old likes it.

This was o.k. not as good as all the reviews sounded.Very quick and easy, would have been even quicker to use a bottled honey mustard sauce, this sauce didn't taste any different than the bottled kind.

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I think it's difficult to rate because its outcome is so variable depending on the quality of the fish and the strength of the mustard you use. For example, as I live in France and dijon mustard here is much stronger than it is in the US, i had to use more honey than recommended. Those of you who felt it was too fishy or that the sauce was too strong should really give it a second chance- you've just got to tweek the recipe according to the products you have available....

Outstanding!  And very easy to make.  I used the packaged salmon fillets that we keep in the freezer making this a good last-minute "throw together" dinner that looks like it took a lot of time to prepare.

Ya...okay.  It is nice enough.  If you put too much of the sauce on top, your salmon will seem a little soggy.

The dijon mixture tasted okay, but I didn't like the overall taste and consistency.  The dijon just didn't seem to go well with the salmon.
Also, the mixture never sticks to the salmon...a lot of it ran down.  I thought the nuts would keep it all together, but it didn't really work.
I won't make this ever again.

I followed the recipe exactly and was really disappointed considering all of the great reviews. It was just ok, neither me nor my husband finished our filets. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the honey dijon mix. I will not make this again.

Great recipe!  Very quick and easy- a big hit with my husband and my 2 and 4 year olds.  I marinated the salmon in the honey mustard mixture for about 12 hour and I did need to increase my cooking time- maybe my fillets were on the thick side.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  I'd definitely serve this to company.  My husband said it was a restaurant quality dish.

I liked this recipe to the point that it mademe search more.  I found that I ddi not like the idea of adding all that butter to the dijon-honey sauce coating.  I tried this recipe again with some dijon mixed with a few dashes of pinot grigio wine and used that as the coating followed byb a light coating of seaseoned breadcrumbs and then drizzled lightly with some olive oil.  Also, I baked the filet at 400 degrees F for 10 minutes to be able to still have a juicy, tender filet.  I also omitted the pecans the second time.

This recipe was just awesome! My family just loved it, it was so easy to prepare.  I didn’t have any pecans on hand so I used cashews. Because I’m on a low carb diet, I used low carb breadcrumbs. I will definitely make this recipe agai. also I decided not to use the avacado or sour cream, the extra Calories I don't need.

This was the first time I'd ever cooked salmon and it was easy and turned out well. I should note that the recipe made a lot of the mustard/honey/butter sauce and I had a lot left over even after liberally brushing the fillets.
I'll be making this recipe again for The Woman I Love.

Definitely a keeper!  You can throw some asparagus tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper on the pan with the salmon and it is the perfect cooking time.

I also substisuted walnuts for the cashews, and increased the amount of sauce and breadcrumb mixture by about 50%.  I dredged the salmon in the sauce and covered both sides with the breadcrumb mixture, letting it marinate in the fridge for 4 hours.  It was probably the best salmon I've ever had in my entire life!  A must try for everyone.  Very simple to make as well.

Oh my gosh... this is really great and even my kids liked it!  We marinated the salmon for 30 minutes as suggested in the ratings and didn't use any nuts (per the kids request) and it was still great and would be festive enough for a fancy dinner with friends!

Hello from Canada,
I wanted to take the opportunity to rave about this recipe, it was amazing, I also marinated the salmon for about 20 minute and really cover my salmon with the dried bread crumbs the italian style one, and I added some fresh garlic and put more mustard to create an amazing meal for two, I place the salmon over rice and finish with sparagus and some of the sauce that I cook over the stove.
My partner could not stop commenting about it and we had a great meal,
thanks Arnie and All recipe staff, great site!

Fantastic!  This was our first salmon recipe and it was a smash hit!  So easy and so good!  Someone said it's bland??!!  NO WAY!  We used Kirkland Salmon from Costco and followed the directions exactly...was excellent.  My wife actually only ate half her serving so that she could save some for tomorrow's lunch.  I guess next time we will make a lot more.

I wanted to prepare salmon differently, so I tried this recipe.  It was a huge success.  My husband said that this was the best salmon he ever ate!  I followed the recipe expect for the mustard:  I only had spicy brown on hand.  I also added fresh garlic, pepper, and some more herbs.  Thank you, Arnie, for a terrific recipe!!

This turned out wonderful!  Used a lot of the dijon sauce on the fish, but still had a lot left to throw.  Next time I might reserve some prior to using on the fish to serve along side the salmon.  Will make again.  Yummy.

Needs more flavor.  I suggest doubling the portion of honey.

Salmon didn't really absorb the honey/dijon taste very well, and turned out dry (my fault, overcooked). Recipe was just ok, but the amount called for could cover nearly twice the amount of salmon.

Delicious!  Enjoyed trying this one with one of my husbands fresh caught kings. (We live in Alaska, are you jealous!)  I used it on a filet instead of steaks which made the baking time longer. (I covered it at the end to quicken the cooking time.  Probably better to do and the beginning and take off near the end.)  I only had pralined pecans on hand which added an extra sweetness we really liked.  The whole family thought it was great!  I will definitely use this one next time we have company!

We've made this several times -- love it!  The only change I make is to replace the breadcrumbs with toasted multigrain bread, cut into small cubes.  (And I usually don't have lemon on hand so I leave that out.)

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!  I ended up with a lot of the breadcrumb mixture left, so next time I will probably half it.  Other than that, this is perfect!

I'm don't normally like fish but my wife wanted a salmon recipe so we gave this a try.  It was fantastic, we'll definatly do it again.  Followed the recipe as written except that I dredged the honey-mustard coated salmon in the dry mix rather than sprinkling it on top.

This is one of the easiest, best salmon recipes I've ever made. I suggest using Dry Italian Bread Crumbs, which are finer. This will give the salmon a little more of a crust. It also absorbs the honey/mustard mixture better. You can also use Honey Mustard instead of Dijon, and it still turns out excellent.

Good stuff!!  My whole family loved this salmon.  My only gripe is that I never think that 4oz. is enough for one person.  Next time I may increase by 1 1/2 or 2.  This was soooooo easy and I recommend it for beginning chefs or anyone who wants to try new ways to cook salmon!

Love this recipe!!  I fixed this knowing my husband would be suspicious, not a great fish eater.  He gave me that look when I served him, but then cleaned his plate and said he couldn't believe how great it was!  We will be having this again!

This was a good recipe. My husband liked it more than I did. Was definetly a nice change from the normal salmon. Will make again. Maybe I will try marinating the salmon in the mix.

This recipe is amazing!!  I do not like fish but my husband does, so I have been searching for a recipe that would make it palatable for me.  I really liked it!  I prepared the sauce ahead and then put it in the fridge. When it came time to cook it, the sauce was thick, so I just slatehered it all on.  It was incredible!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!

The type of bread crumbs used can really enhance or detract from this recipe.  I prefer homemade bread crumbs to the store-bought.  This allows for more variety and play with the taste.  I made extra dijon sauce to pour lightly over the salmon before serving.  Nice recipe!

This was a wonderful dish, certainly good enough to make for company.  I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great.  The honey-mustard mixture went on a little thin as I brushed it on, so I would recommend putting it on pretty thick (wouldn't want to miss out on this yummy coating!).  Will definitely make again!

I give this recipe a 5 star. Not because I enjoy Salmon, I do not; however, my husband really liked the recipe and so did my 15.5 month old son who seemed to never get enough.  Not to mention, it did not recquire too much chewing on my son's part either!!  ;)

Outstanding! We loved it! The only thing I did different was to double the sauce and use the other half (heated on the stovetop) to pour over the salmon after baking & before serving. This really gave it a glamourous presentation! I will make this over and over again! I did substitute toasted rice bread crumbs (cuz I have a wheat allergy) for the regular bread crumbs and no one could tell! Thank you for the post! Fabulous fish dish!!

Even though we didn't have any pecans, we just used bread crumbs. IT WAS WONDERFUL! We also put the mustard and honey mixture all over and breaded the entire filet.

My husband and I think this recipe is the best one we've tried for salmon. I had a 3lb filet that I baked in the oven for 30 minutes. We have a lot of salmon in the freezer that my husband has caught so I have tried it many different ways.

My husband who never ate salmon before said one day that maybe if I marinated or coated it with something he would try it.  I found this recipe the next morning and it has become one of our favorite meals.  I have even served it at a few dinner parties with RAVE REVIEWS.

I have always stayed away from salmon until now!!!!   I never liked the smell of it or the taste but that was with canned salmon.  I had never had fresh fillets before.  These were to die for!!!  Melted in our mouth.  dijon/honey sauce  made a little too much considering it says to only "lightly brush each fillet".  Had almost half of it left.  I heated up the leftover and had it on the table for dipping but no one needed it.  Next time I think I will only make 1/2 of the sauce.  Update:  always half the sauce now, plenty!! Will be making this forever.
  Thanks Arnie!!!

With all of the rave reviews, my expectations must have been pretty high for this.  We followed the recipe exactly, but we thought it was good, but not outstandingly great.  The sauce was good and I would brush it on more heavily than the recipe said.  I liked the taste of the pecans and wonder if skipping the bread crumbs and doubling the pecans would be good.  I may make it again, but I think I prefer the taste of lemon with my salmon.  The reviewer who recommended a lemon juice/white wine sauce sounded more like what my tastebuds would prefer.

Very good recipe and easy.  I gave the pecans a quick grind in the blender. I save the extra mixed with the bread crumbs and parsley in the fridge for the next time I make this dish.

Great recipe! Incredible restaurant style quality.  The only thing I leave out is the pecans.  I've never tried it with them b/c we don't care for nuts.  This has become a permanent and regular part our menu planning!

After reading some reviews, decreased the amount of dijon.  The salmon was nice and tender inside, but the topping was too dry for my taste.

I liked this, but it was really rich. I wonder how it would be with half olive oil, half butter? I left out the nuts because I didn't feel like chopping them, and I'm glad I did because that would have made it even richer.

Delicious taste! Did omit pecans (didnt have any) and used a 1/2 and 1/2 combo of crushed corn flakes and crushed saltines (guess I need to grocery shop), but salmon was good, just a little sweet and great salmon flavor. Thanks Arnie

This was very easy to make and tasted delicious.  You can't really go wrong with this one, just don't over cook.  Stick with the suggested time.  Had lots of left over 'butter' spread, so I froze it for next time.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was fabulous.  This is a very simple recipe, but there is a lot of depth to the various flavors and the topping was the perfect complement for the salmon fillets.  I will be keeping this one.  We served it with wild rice pilaf and steamed asparagus.

I read many of the other reviews and made the following adjustments and found the salmon perfect:  3/4 cup butter, about 5 tablespoons of honey dijon mustard, 1/2 cup bread crumbs, and no pecans.  Marinate the salmon for at least 30 minutes.  Took about 22 minutes.  Great!

I made half this recipe for dinner one night & it was great. When my husband asked what was for dinner and I said "baked dijon salmon" he said "are you joking?". It really wasn't too complicated for a weeknight meal. I liked the crunch of the pecans in the topping. I didn't have fresh parsley or lemon wedges, which definitely would've put this over the top. Easy and tasty!

I'm not sure if it was because my pieces of salmon were a little thick, but it did take longer to bake than the time listed in the directions.  I also found that the sauce and breadcrumbs mixture will cover much more than 4 4oz pieces.  Overall though this was a VERY tasty dinner and very easy to make!

This was terrific. I didn't have any salmon, so I used Tilapia. I also used Brummel and Brown spread instead of butter. Next time I make this, I am going to use less butter(didn't need it all) and more dijon mustard. This was so yummy. I can't wait to try it on salmon. Thanks.

We don't even really like salmon and we loved this.  I think you could cut the butter in half and it would still taste delicious.  It will become a routine dinner in our house.  Thanks Arnie!

The only reason that this gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because my husband and daughter didn't like it.  I thought it was quite good.  If you like salmon, then you will like this recipe.

I hate to sound disappointed, but I certainly was with this dish.  It's possible I did something wrong, although I was very careful to follow the recipe to a T.  The salmon was moist, but the flavors didn't seem to go together.  I think it was the pecan and dijon flavors that clashed.  My kids wouldn't even eat it after the first bite.  Oh well, just an expensive mistake.

Wonderful flavor and couldn't be any easier.  My
husband, who isn't usually too enthusiastic about
any fresh fish, loved this.

I'm a salmon snob -- always looking for new ways to fix and this one is just excellent!   I had no pecans, so used a combo of cashews and peanuts.  The honey mustard butter sauce was wonderful.  This was just too easy to taste so good!!  Also had fresh salmon tonight, so that might have made it even better?

"A home run," my husband said. I don't like salmon -- at all -- and I even like this. I made the dish with fresh-caught salom too, which always makes a big difference. We'll use this recipe again -- and not just on fish. I think chicken and pork will be great with a few tweaks.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because I didn't follow the recipe in full.  I used the mixture of dijon mustard, butter and a pinch of brown sugar.  I also used seasoned breadcrumbs with parsley.  The salmon came out perfect.  I can't wait to try it again!!

Easy and tasty!  Not quite 5 stars.  But because it is so simple, I would definitely make this again.  It is just as good without the butter.  In fact, the last few times I've made it all I've used is honey dijon sauce and chopped pecans, omitting everything else.  I like it better that way, actually.  I use this recipe at least once a week (usually more).  It is simple enough to do when I'm cooking for just for me!!!

This was probably the best salmon dish that I have eaten or even made.  The tastes are an excellent combination and was very easy to make.  I tried using pistachio's instead and it was wonderful.  Will enjoy again!!  Thanks for this amazing recipe.

Excellent - the recipe calls for the salmon to be brushed with the honey, mstard, and butter - I used quite a bit to coat the salmon.  It was excellent.

I have made this a dozen times & it comes out great every time!  Even my 19 year old daughter was able to prepare it wonderfully.  A MUST for everyone that loves salmon.  Very classy. I've eaten this at weddings & other affairs. So glad I can make it at home!

Made this for Terry & Chelsea 4/03. Terry loved it! Chelsea doesn't like salmon too much. Had to cook it longer than 15 min! Flavor was great. Make sure to grind the pecans really fine.

Not a favorite, but then maybe it is because we are from Texas and it wasn't fried chicken.  Anyway, it just didn't have a lot of flavor.

This was a nice change to salmon, but it was a little bland for me.  I suppose I'm just more of a lemon and herb kinda gal.  My husband liked it, and I'm sure we'll make it again.  Thanks.

This really is very delicous.  My husband and four year old daughter loved it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Saving a little extra of the sauce for dipping is a good idea.  Excellent recipe for fish, thank you!

We give this 3.5 stars.  It was very good.  The only thing I did was cut back on the butter.
Very nice flavor.  A nice change from my usual sesame marinade.

My husband is not a big fish lover but he loved the salmon with this honey-mustard combination.  I altered the recipe a little but and added some White Riesling wine with a splash of dill weed.  Was very tasty.

This was very good.  My husband and I both liked it but my son scrapped off the topping before he would eat it.  I was looking for a different way to prepare salmon and this was perfect.  I squeezed lemon over the top before baking and it really added a nice touch.

This was very easy to make and tasted okay.  Not as flavorful as I had imagined.  I might make again and use regular mustard instead of dijon - or more honey.

very very nice presentation, not a whole lot of flavor, i'm thinking it should have marinated more in the honey mustard sauce, i'll try that next time. Very pretty though if serving for a get-together.

YUMMMM-EE!  Very fast, very easy and very tasty!  I had the man at the fish counter slice the skin off of the fillet for me and cut it in to servings so even more time was saved and time is not something I can afford to waste!

I tripled this recipe (for 12 servings) and served it last night at an adult potluck and it was the hit of the evening!  Quick and easy prep and baking time and it was wonderful.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs and was a little shy with the honey.  Used Grey Poupon since that's what I had.  Everyone wants the recipe - including some that didn't get to taste but heard how good it was from others!

I have cooked salmon many ways, but this was the best way yet.  The crust on top gave the salmon such a wonderful flavor.  Salmon is not my husband's favorite fish, however, he really liked this recipe.  I also plan to try it on halibut, which is his favorite.

Easy and delicious.  Served with rice pilaf and steamed asparagus.  I don't work with fish often (enough) and I was delighted when the skin stayed in the pan when I removed them to the plates!  Definitely can cut the butter/honey/mustard recipe in half for a pound of filets.  Excellent!

This recipe has ruined restaurant salmon for me.  Since I've been making this, I don't like anyone else's salmon!  Even my picky kids love this!  Thank you for giving my family a new appreciation for salmon with this EASY, TASTY dish!

Awesome!!  I had to try this after reading all of the reviews and totally agree.  My husband loves to fish so we are always having fish.  This was something different than the usual bar-b-qued fish and we are so glad we tried it.  It was the best way we have ever cooked fish yet, and we cook it a lot!

Great recipe - after making the butter mixture I put it in the refrigerator and then pat it on the salmon when it has solidified a little - then you can press the bread crumb mixture into it.

Brilliant! I couldn't believe all the raving about this simple recipe, so I had to try it for myself - it really is fantastic. Definitely the best and least stressful way I've ever cooked salmon.

The Baked Dijon Salmon recipe is a real keeper for me and my husband.  I was leary about the pecans, but he didn't even know they were there until I told him.  We both loved it and I will make it often.   Joyce Thomas

I've made this dish 3 times already and it is very tasty.  It is so easy to make and yet looks and tastes like a restaurant dish.  Even my one year old likes it although we have to clear the pecans off her portion.  This recipe will definately be a keeper in our household!

I absolutely loved the marvelous mixture that goes on the fish.  I am not a huge salmon lover, however, and the sauce did not cover the fishy taste enough for me.  I will definately use this exact same recipe on a different type of fish.  Bravo!

My non salmon loving husband went back for seconds. That says it all!!! Definately will have again, really delicious and ever so easy to make.
Did cut back a bit on the butter though and used seasoned bread crumbs.

Perfect!  I usually don't eat salmon becasue it's a little too "fishy" but this was great.  Extremely fast and easy as well.  I also broiled the filet for about 2 minutes at the end of cooking time which gave it a nice browning.

Really liked it. Very simple and dynamic, everyone that tried it really liked it, especially the pecan topping. Had one friend say he woke up thinking about it and that he must have been dreaming about it all night.... hmmm... maybe I should reconsider my friends. ;)

We are salmon lovers and this was fabulous!  Very easy, extremely quick, and wonderful to savor.  My husband said that if he paid $100 for this dinner at a restaurant it would be worth it!  A truely great salmon recipe.

Loved it.  I also added dill and cracked pepper to the dry mix.  And next time will either half or leave out the butter.  Was very good.

De-Lish!!! My boyfriend was not looking forward to a salmon dinner, but I tried this recipe and we both loved it - he said it was the best fish he'd ever eaten!  I used the coarse ground dijon mustard and squeezed lemon over the salmon before dressing it up and baking...Fabulous and simple!

I made this with my cousin with a sidedish in about 20 minutes!  It was yummy (if you like mustard) and pretty easy.  Recipe makes enough of the sauce so that you can save some extra for dipping when you eat it.  Put lemon on top when you bake it...that adds good flavor.  All in all, a good recipe.

An all time favorite, this is so quick and easy, but delectable.  I serve it over mixed greens drizzled with a little balsamic vinegar and olive oil.  It's like something you'd get at a nice restaurant.  Served it to guests who absolutely raved over it!  (Little did they know how incredibly simple it was--the hostess's best kept secret!)

One of the best salmon recipes that I have used and the EASIEST!!  I really did like the crunchiness that the bread crumbs gave.  And the Dijon and the honey blended together perfectly.

This is a very impressive recipe. It presents beautifully on the plate and the flavors mingle well together. My husband was more than pleased. It even works if you don't have the pecans on hand. The slight crunchiness of the breading is great with the tenderness of the salmon. Give this one a try.

I was vetoed on the Almonds, but just wanted to say that the sauce was great!  It was fun to make.  I got some flash-frozen salmon from Trader Joes and didn't want to ruin it.  I didn't!  Next time I'll try to remove all the bones from the salmon first or maybe buy some filets.

I thought this recipe was fantastic.  My kids did not like the honey mustard coating as much as i thought they would.  I did not use the breadcrumbs and next time i will try it that way.  The dish, in my opinion was really tasty.

Ohhh, the topping is definitely the best part.  Slightly sweet, tangy, crunchy; very good.  Carries the salmon right along.

Wonderful!  I was fortunate enough to have fresh caught salmon, brought back from Alaska last week, from my in-laws.  I wanted it to be special, and hoped not to ruin it!  Not to worry with this recipe, it was delicious!  Even my 10 year old son liked it!  We'll definitely be making this again, and passing the recipe on to other salmon lovers.  Thanks for sharing it!

All I can say is WOW!  
The Pecans give it a nice crunch as the Honey and Mustard throw you into a sweet and spicy sensation.   The salmon becomes less fishy due to the saturation of the ingredients on top.  

VERY Recommended!!!

I planned to serve this at a dinner party for 10, but I learned that the guest of honor doesn't like salmon.  So, I substituted Chilean sea bass.  It was a hit!!!  Absolutely delicious.  That same guest of honor doesn't like mustard either, but she had no idea that there was mustard in the recipe.  She has raved about it to others and she wants the recipe.  Really superb . . . I wish I had leftovers. I can't wait to make it again.

Wow!  This one had my friends rubbing their tummies and telling what an incredible cook they never realized I am!  I couldn't take all the credit though. The magic is int he recipe.  I also glazed some extra firm tofu for a vegetarian friend and cooked it with the salmon - it turned out great too!

Salmon turned out very moist and the honey-mustard topping really complemented the fish -- not sure what the bread crumb mixture added though.

Always turns out very moist and delicious. I vary it by cutting out the butter, honey and pecans, but using different types of onions (shallots, red and scallions). Try it also with some of the grainy mustards.

I am new to this whole cooking thing and this recipe has made me a superstar in my 
family's eyes.  It was quick and tasty and even the non-salmon lovers enjoyed it.  This will 
be a family favorite of ours for years to come.  Thank you for sharing it!!

Oh my gosh!!!  This salmon was so incredibly good!  I made it for a brunch that I had.  I had it scaled to make for 15 people and then changed the individual salmon fillets to one large 3 pound salmon fillet.  I cooked the salmon about 4 times longer than it said in the recipe for that reason.  The salmon was perfectly excellent!  Everyone loved it--- and said that I was the best cook!  I will make this again for a dinner party!

I have many variations for preparing salmon, almost all of them very good to excellent. 
This receipe is definitely one of the best and is my first choice for serving guests. 
The Dijon-honey coating is very subtle and the pecan crust is delicious!

I liked this recipe although found it necessary to modify it after making it the first time.  The amount of butter used needs to be cut in half if you want the coating to stick to the fish. Depending on the thickness of the salmon it could go thirty to fourty-five minutes. Anna H.

I have an excellent salmon recipe that I always make for my wife because
she loves it, but one time I surprised her by preparing this salmon recipe and
she went crazy over the flavour of it.  This was very shocking to me because she
detests Dijon mustard.

This was a pretty good recipe, and probably would have been better if I liked salmon that well. I used regular mustard because we are not dijon-lovers. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who liked salmon.

Arnie was right! My husband and I live in the Northwest, and we also fish alot, so salmon is abundant and we've tried preparing it in many different ways. We both prefer it cooked on the BBQ, but this preparation is excellent in the oven! I tried it out for the first time with visiting relatives, and it was a hit!

This is a wonderful and easy way to bake salmon.  I just use honey mustard instead of making it with dijon and honey.

Delicious salmon recipe.  The recipe calls for a light brushing of the butter, honey, mustard mix; but i would give it a bit more if you want to be able to taste it in the final result.

My husband was beginning to feel like a guinea pig with all the new recipes that I've tried lately.  He usually just eats and says nothing, but after a couple bites of baked dijon salmon, he said,"you can make this again!"  Great way to cook salmon. Easy enough for every day, elegant enough for company.

Really easy to prepare.  The pecans give the salmon a different flavor.  We'll definitely be
making this recipe more often as a change of pace for salmon.

This recipe was suprisingly easy to "whip" together and it tastes like you ordered it in a restaurant. The combination of the honey, dijon mustard and pecans give the salmon a wonderful flavor. Thank you, Arnie, for submitting this recipe! My whole family loves it..I've even passed it on to my in-laws, who thought it tasted "heavenly"!

Anytime you take nuts and use as a crusty topping, you have a splendid meal.  I like the sweetness of the topping with the salmon.  My 13 month old enjoyed this as well!  If processing the nuts yourself, it takes some extra time.  Otherwise, simple to put together.  I bet this topping would be great with chicken.

This was a great dish. The dijon mustard was a bit overpowering. If you like dijon go  for it! Next time I will either use yellow mustard or cut the amount of dijon in half.

My husband couldn't stop say "WOW".  This is a great recipe.  If you want to cut down on the fat, eliminate the butter and just use store bought Honey Dijon Mustard.  Spread directly on the salmon then top with bread crumb mixture.

It was a very easy recipe.  I think I would have liked it better if the breadcrumb topping was browned.  I don't think I'll make it again.
