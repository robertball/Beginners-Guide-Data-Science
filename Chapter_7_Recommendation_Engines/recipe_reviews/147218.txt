GENIUS!!! Absolutely the scummiest Cinnamon Rolls!!! Followed the recipe to the letter and they turned out light & fluffy as promised. The WHOLE family (3yrs - 30yrs) loved them and as they have no butter I enjoyed an extra one :) So glad I made a double batch!!! Swapped Raisins for Choc Chips in half batch, the result was absolutely wicked!!! Teya in Aus

These are very light and fluffy when you eat them! I followed the recipe except I didnt add raisins. They are scrumptious! I added a powdered sugar glaze once they cooled down a bit.

These look and smell great and I love how low in fat they are! The texture is wonderfully soft as well. However, they need to be a bit sweeter. I will definitely make them again with some more sugar and maybe some cinnamon in the dough.

I tried this recipe and they turned out okay.  They're definitely not cinnamon buns though; without the butter and sugar, they are really yeast rolls with raisins. Very light, not very sweet.  Good with butter.

Sorry, these were a no go for me.  I wouldn't rate it so low if it hadn't taken over 2 hours to make (probably a 3 if it had taken less than an hour).  I followed the recipe and they were so bland, the dough was gross and we had to add butter and lots more sugar and cinnamon mixture just to eat them.  I do lots of healthy baking and converting recipes into healthier versions of themselves but a no to these.

These were great.  I made them for the first time this weekend. I added some variations to this recipe.   I added apple cinnamon cider mix, about a table spoon to the batter and omitted the raisins.  I was having issues with my oven so I had to refrigerate overnight, and they were huge in the morning.  Tip: if you let them rise longer then instructed keep them spaced out, some were 4-5 inches across.   AWESOME!!! A new favorite!

They were not my favorite cinnamon roll. I found this recipe last night and made them. They were a little bland on taste, and the bread from them would be good in something else. It didn't realy work for cinnamon rolls.

This definitely tasted like a healthier cinnamon bun; it doesn't leave you feeling guilty (or sugar overdosed) after you eat it!  I did use an icing sugar glaze on top of the buns.  Otherwise the buns would have tasted like cinnamon bread rolls, which was fine too when they were fresh out of the oven.  If you want the satisfying taste of a cinnamon bun, it's probably best to stick to a recipe that adds some fat.  This recipe is nearly fat free with the exception of the eggs.

I totally disagree with most people here.  I thought these were neither sweet or cinnamon-y enough.  Next time I'd double sugar, honey & cinnamon I think. I ended  up frosting them with cream cheese frosting, which helped.  I hope it's my taste that  is goofy  here, cause I made them to sell at a bake sale.

I've made these three times and have received nothing but rave reviews. I added extra honey, cinnamon and sugar inside, then after they rise and just before I put them in the oven, I sprinkle with more of the cinn/sugar mixture and drizzle with butter for a prize worthy treat!!

very bland, and I even added a stick of butter. It came out more like a bread, then a cinnamon roll.

Do NOT cook these at 375. They will burn in less than 10 minutes. Try cooking them at 300 for 20 minutes.

I followed the directions and they came out hard. My family wouldn't eat them and the one that I tried was bland. Very disappointed, especially for the amount of time that it took to make these.

AMAZING! Created an allrecipes account just so I could rave about these rolls and thank the person who posted the recipe. I added chopped pecans to the filling (1/4 cup) and frosted them with Donna Hay's cream cheese frosting - sensational! I love cinnamon scrolls and these are the best I've ever tried. And easy to make: Even a beginner like me nailed it! Thanks heaps for the recipe. :)

These are amazing! I'm really impressed with how they aren't too sweet (and I did frost mine), they're so fabulously fluffy, and how low in fat they are! And, they're not hard to make!

Very easy, I substituted the raisins with pecans.  Delicious and very light and fluffy.  Will keep this recipe close.
