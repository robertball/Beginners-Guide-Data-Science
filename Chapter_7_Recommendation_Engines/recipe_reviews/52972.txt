Where I live the easiest type of smoked fish to find is smoked salmon (smoked so it is flaky, not like lox) so I used that in my kedgeree. It turned out very delicious and didn't require the precooking step that smoked haddock would. I think two cups of uncooked rice is way too much though. I only used two cups of cooked rice. After everything was warmed through I stirred in about a half cup of warmed heavy cream to bind it all together.

I was forced to eat kedgeree as a kid, and I absolutely hated it. Oddly, I crave it every now and again. If you can't get smoked haddock, kedgeree isn't worth making imo. Personally, I make it with half and half (stir it into the egg/rice/fish mixture). I also add a little fresh parsley. Finally, two cups of rice for two servings is way excessive - one cup is more than ample.

This is a quite definitive recipe, although the rice quantity is a bit excessive for the Western palate, and the peas are a rather odd addition. The yogurt is a lovely sharp change from the standard heavy cream.

If using a rice cooker, there's no need to cook the haddock: just steam it on top of the cooked rice on the Warm cycle, then flake it with chopsticks right where it lies.

I cook the rice in fish or chicken stock for added flavour, and always make enough for leftovers: kedgeree is the BEST omelette filling imaginable.

Delish! I did as others suggested and used half the rice (brown basmati). I couldn't find fresh smoked haddock, so I used canned smoked herring, and it worked out well. Then I added the bay leaf to the rice while it was cooking and added a touch of coconut milk (my standard sub for cream/milk) to the rice after it was cooked. I seasoned it with quite a bit of salt, but it was really the yogurt (I used Greek) that brought out the flavors. Easy and delicious--a definite keeper!

This was a pleasant suprise.  I loved the great mix of flavors of the smoke and the curry.   The only thing I've ever done with smoked haddock before was Finnan Haddie (a creamy, buttery dish). My quandry was that I'm trying to take off a few pounds and can't afford a white sauce....and here my mom gave me this smoked haddock.  I used brown basmati rice (Trader Joe's) and scaled the rice down to just two cups cooked rice.  Used olive oil instead of butter...just because.  I'll make this one, again.

Good recipe. Easy to make. I would double the curry to get a bit more flavour.

It was awesome! The curry added a great deal of flavor. I see others were talking about how bland it was, but I didn't find that.  High in protein, I see why it was a breakfast meal. I will definatley have again.

I also made this quite recently and I have to agree with sarahv ~ it was very time consuming for an extremely dry and very bland dish.

I have never attempted Kedgeree before and really looked forward to it. Unfortunately it was really disappointing. I thought it was loads of effort for a bland dish.

I made this last week and it turned out great! I used perch as that was what I had in the freezer (added smoked paprika when cooking the fish in the milk). I added 3 T. curry powder, 1 t. cumin & 1 t. smoked paprika to boost the flavor. Substituted corn for peas as others suggested and used 4 eggs instead of 2 (I love eggs). I also added about a 1/2 c. water after the onions had browned a little, to combat the dryness. Tasted delicious and the leftovers were even better.

I make this regularly, and your recipe is a good edition. For convenience I use 3.8 vacuum tins (like sardine tins) of smoked trout or salmon that keep easily in my pantry. And I like my kedgeree buttery ++.  It also reheats well.

Nice blend of flavors.  I made it exactly per the recipe.  Even the kid liked it, which surprised me.  Easily adapted if you like it spicier.  No leftovers.  Next time I'll at least double it.

This was a really good recipe, unfortunately I'm always trying to copy my Grandmas recipe so it didn't bring back the memories it should have done :O( However with enough Salt and Pepper and a touch of spice I definitely enjoyed it!

We really liked this. I used a brown basmati rice and went with 2c COOKED instead of 2c UNCOOKED, and I think that was just about right - any more rice would have been way too much.

What I make, thanks to this recipe, is a quick Trader Joe's based version: one packet of precooked brown rice, frozen peas, green onions, three eggs (precooked), and a can of TJ kipper filets. I did get haddock from a British store once, but haven't bothered since. Super quick and easy, and makes a nice dinner for two.

I'm about to try it -- it sounds wonderful. What I want to know is is it necessary to cook smoked fish? All the kedgeree recipes call for cooking it, but we eat smoked salmon as is on crackers.

My son says "Yum!!!" But I did change it a little!!
He doesn't like peas, so I used sweetcorn, I only used 1 cup of Rice and double the quantity of smoked haddock and 5 teaspoons of curry powder!! Definitely morish!!!! Mmmmmmmm!!!
