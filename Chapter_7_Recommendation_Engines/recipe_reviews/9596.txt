I didn't have the correct pan for these but a 12 muffin tin worked great. I just rolled the dough into 12 equal balls and pressed them into the bottom and then spread the filling over the top. I've made these once with pecans and once with walnuts. After the two times baking this I've come to the realization that the crust is bland. But the filling is so good you can't tell. Next time I try this I'll use store bought pie crust. I think it's easier and will probably taste alot better. That being said they were great! With pecans it really tastes like pecan pie and you really can't tell the difference between the walnuts and pecans.

This is the second year that I've made this delicious recipe for Christmas as a treat for my Mom.  They bake up beautifully and pop right out of the pan.  Although, the recipe needs adjusted to either double the dough or half the filling.  Thanks!

A tasty treat. I used a pastry tube to add a swirl of peanut butter to each one- it was soooo good!

So good. I let mine set for a few hours in the freezer and substituted pecans for the walnuts. I also added a little nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, and vanilla to the crust. I think it might also be good with some little pieces of apple.
