Hmm, they get 5 stars for taste, and it's a simple recipe to make with children (I gather you could melt the chocolate and butter in the microwave to make it even quicker) but ... 

It's very messy, it melts on your fingers, I was thinking "what a great birthday party treat!" but nope. 
Not great for a lunchbox snack either, for the same melting reason. 
Perhaps making them in patty pans, instead of as a slab would make them a bit easier to eat without getting dirty. 
But no doubt, Rice Krispies (or Rice Bubbles in Australia) and chocolate are a tasty combination!!

They are absolutely yumtious!  A snap to make. Easiest way is dropping them by tablespoonfuls onto greased waxed paper.
I shall experiment the next time with peanut butter chocolate chips, and/or milk chocolate chips.

These are much better if you use milk chocolate chip instead of semi sweet..

So far this is our Best Chocolate recipe. The Taster's have held every other recipe up to this one, and none of them have matched it. It is Super!!
