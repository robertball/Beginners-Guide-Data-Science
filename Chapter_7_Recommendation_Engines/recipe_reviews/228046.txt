Glad my Doctor insisted on more fish in the diet! This was fast, fresh and so very good. Thanks for the recipe Chef John!

I made this exactly as written, except: I used a chopped, fresh (locally grown) tomato instead of  cherry tomatoes, and I only had one lime. Anyhow, it turned out great -- really delicious and just what I was looking for. I often order fish Veracruz at restaurants, but had never tried it at home. I served it with rice and an avacado salad. I will make this again for sure -- hubby loved it too. Thanks Chef John!

Delicious!  This was a big hit with everyone, and Weight Watchers friendly.  Do take the effort to find the Castelvetrano olives; very flavorful.  I was able to track them down at Whole Foods.

This dish looks and tastes complicated but goes together very quickly and easily.  I was impressed Chef John!  Served with Spicy Green Beans, Mexican Rice II and Tomato, Avocado and Corn Salad as a starter all from AR.  Thank you Chef John!!!

I had to use a large regular tomato instead of the cherry tomatoes, and red onion instead of white. Very easy preparation and the flavor is outstanding.

I sautéed the snapper in a separate pan (sprinkled with cayenne, olive oil and some lime juice), then plated it and spooned the sauce on top. I don't like the sauce tasting so much like the fish.

Alterations:  used Tilapia, no-salt-added canned tomatoes, added green & red bell peppers.  Layered a bit of sauce on the bottom, added sauteed yellow squash & zucchini & a bit more sauce, then fish & the rest of the sauce.  It was FANTASTIC - my daughter immediately asked me when I would be making it again!

My son thought this was the best fish ever! Great bold flavors. Followed exactly using fresh mangrove snapper except I used large martini olives instead of fancier ones and we all loved it. Chef John does it again, and we thank you!

Tasy and low-cal!.. I made this tonight after first seeing the video on U-Tube... I didn't realize it was for only 2 servings which explains why my sauce wasn't quite enough but the flavors made up for that!  The addition I made from another recipe was to pre-sliced then boil  a couple red potatoes in salted water then layer them on top of the fish before putting the top layer of sauce.   Other changes I made were leaving the fish whole, using dried oregano and red onion because of what I had.  My three guys all liked it and the pickiest never said anything about the onions.   I didn't have capers but I'll be sure to have them next time.  I used some of the olive brine as a substitute.  The snapper's flavor wasn't great on it's own; I would want to try it with other white-fish, maybe cod... Thank you!

This was excellent! It was hard to find the recommended olives and then I happened to be in Bed, Bath and Beyond and there was an entire end aisle display in the BB&B gourmet foods section. Exceptionally weird and later delicious

Made this last night.  It was da bomb!  HOWEVER, I only used 1/4 of a habanero pepper and it was too hot for me.  I should have gone with my instincts and not used any at all.  Thank god I didn't add the cayenne pepper.  Nonetheless, I am not a "hot/spicy" person.  Next time I'll add a pinch of hot sauce once it's on my plate.  Nevertheless, it was very flavorfull, except I couldn't deal with the habanero.  I paired it with some boiled Yucca/Casave, steamed snow peas and had sime Italian Prosecco to chug it down.  Can't wait to make it again with some yellow rice on the side.  Thank you Chef John!

I cooked this recipe tonight.  Wow, this dish is DELICIOUS! The flavorful mixture of spices, vegetables and fish gave great depth to the taste, which agreed with my palate. I followed the recipe to the letter except I used my  new-found favorite white fish, Swai.  Instead of using two baking dishes, I used one.  When I cook the recipe for my "can't eat hot food" friends, I'll use two baking dishes and withhold the jalapeño and cayenne pepper in one.

I love this recipe!  I only made a few changes.  Used haddock and Roma tomatoes because that is what I had.  I put about 2 tablespoons of lime juice onto the fish directly along with the salt, pepper and cayenne but did not top the mixture with the lime. I did use the Castelvetrano olives and so glad I did, they are awesome!  Will definitely make again.

Excellent dinner tonight using this recipe baked in single serving au gratin dishes along with the blue tortilla chips as per Chef John's video.  The only thing I didn't care for was the olives and that's because I used the wrong ones. They were way too strong so I'll change that up the next time but this is definitely going in our regular Friday fish night rotation.  Hubby LOVED it!

Excellent. Loved this. I thought I had bought red snapper but when I pulled the fish out of the refrig I realized I had bought catfish. Since I had already prepared the tomatoes and capers mixture I couldn't change recipes so I used the catfish. It was great. I will definitely make this again and I will buy red snapper next time. Five stars.

Sooo good! I used red onion and yellow cherry tomatoes and kalamata olives. Nice color! Also only had pickled jalapeños but I thought it was delish. Used 2 slices diced fine, prepped a fish for kids, then added 3 more slices for us.  With cayenne, it was perfect heat.

Awesome!  I am on a low sodium diet so i made without olives. I thought there was a step missing so i just mixed lime juice, cayenne and basil and put that in first so fish was nearly submersed.

This is a very good rendition of a classic.  I made a few changes:  like another reviewer, I added sliced blanched potatoes on top of the fish before baking.  As the tomato sauce cooked, I added a few pinches of cinnamon, 1/3 cup of raisins and used ground chipotle pepper instead of cayenne.

This is another great dish from chef John. I did change it a little. I used tilapia,no jalapeno and sicilian olive instead of what the recipe called for. Would I make it again? YES ;)

Just put the last bite of this amazing fish dish in my mouth!  Husband and I were grateful to use a different fish other than tilapia or salmon, although we love those too, but they are always the fall-backs.  I had to go to a specialty fish & poultry store to find the red snapper 15 minutes away but it was worth it!  Fresh, upscale flavors and restaurant quality!  Certainly some prep work involved but baking was quick.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks Chef John!

My family loved this recipe!  Since we aren’t hot spicy lovers, I omitted the peppers.  Be sure to salt and pepper the snapper!!

This is the best fish recipe I have ever tasted.  The capers are the perfect complement to the snapper.  It is a Sunday staple in our home.  Douglas Craig

This was fabulous. Brought American red snapper home from vacation, and made this quick and easy, delicious dish.  It is excellent. I made the whole thing in my cast iron skillet.  Excellent!

Fresh and delicious with just the right amount of heat. Fish is enhanced, not smothered by sauce. This is a five star dish that is so very easy to make!

This turned out amazing and is perfect for a pescatarian diet! Plus, no dairy in this recipe. I did add some roasted bell peppers I had in a jar that I needed to use up. We eat a lot of fish and this was a great new recipe to change up the usual lemon pepper type recipes.

Not bad!  Made with tilapia and used regular olives instead of Castelvetrano because that's what I had.  Also used less lime (~3/4 of one).  Made 1 baking dish without jalapenos and cayenne for the kids; grown-ups got full strength.  Hubby suggested less cayenne and more jalapeno next time.  Nice complexity of flavors; served with yellow rice and roasted Brussels sprouts.

Easy to make and very delicious! I had all ingredients but used lemons instead of limes. It was still good and had a nice kick from the cayenne pepper. Finished cooking in 15 min, the family was pleased and looked pretty.

Definitely will be repeated.  I drizzled some enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan and over the top--not a lot--just a drizzle and it added a little more zip and kept it from being too dry.

Delicious.  This was the first time I ever made red snapper, and it came out perfect.  Didn't have the individual bakeware so used one casserole dish for 2 snappers.  The skin was left on, which probably helped transfer it from the casserole to the dinner plates.  Had with yellow and blue corn chips.  Will definitely make again!  As always, thank you Chef John :-)

I forgot the cayenne, but will put it in next time. I also only added 1 lime because I added a few extra tomatoes. I used 1/2tbs caper juice & 1/2 tbs green olive juice. Fabulous!

Great! I probably added 1.5x-2x the amount of lime juice the recipe called for, and it was delicious! I also used serrano peppers instead of jalapeños and was a bit more liberal with the olives and capers.  I'll try adding chipotle peppers next time.

Delicious.  We made one dish with orange roughy and one with red snapper and added add a little more garlic and capers.  My family loved this. There were no left overs.

We loved the combination of flavors. I used jarred jalapeno slices instead of a whole pepper because that's all I had but otherwise followed the recipe. One of the best fish dishes I've made.

This was Seriously Awesome!!!  Delicious, colorful, and the perfect way to prepare the fresh red snapper I bought from a fishing boat.  I followed the recipe, except I used assorted chopped tomatoes from my garden, and some gourmet green olives stuffed with lemon peel.  Hubby and I both loved it.  Better than restaurant quality!

Love this recipe.   However, when I know I’m going to be pressed for time I make the salsa ahead of time.  I think it tastes better after the flavors have a chance to marinate together.

Yes, used fresh cherry tomatoes from our garden.

Made this last night using leftover fish from Galveston.  Used roasted hatch peppers instead of jalapenos.  It was awesome!!  Not a speck was left.  Absolutely, will make again when my brother-in-law catches more fish!

This was a great recipe. I also substituted vine ripened fresh tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes since it is summer. I held back from adding the entire jalapeño for fear that it might be too spicy, but I could’ve added the whole thing without it being any problem at all. I added this to my favorites.

We got some fresh gulf red snapper from the truck that came into town from Alabama yesterday and I was able to make my first real fish dish in the time as described and it was awesome. We have a strong distaste for olives and artichoke hearts were a delicious addition to the concoction.

We loved this recipe!!! I used black olives because I had them and left out the capers because I didn't have them.  Next time I will be more prepared. It's worth preparing again!

Really good! Only change I made is I add the tomatoes a few minutes after adding the jalapenos and olives. They cook at different rates and the tomatoes get over cooked if added together. 
Exceptional recipe.

This is an easy recipe that can be changed up if one wishes. I made it like it was written the first time, the second time I used smoked cod and then added some clams and cilantro at the end. You can use this as a base for so many fish recipes. The olives, capers and jalapeno  really give it its flavor. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely superb.! I modified Chef John’s recipe by adding canned tomatoes, sliced green bell peppers and a dash of ground cumin. I served it over a bed of  Spanish rice.

Absolutely delicious! I changed the recipe a slight bit by using plum tomatoes & jarred jalapeños and served on top of angel hair pasta with shaved Parmesan.  I’ll definitely try the cherry tomatoes next time.  I even doubled the recipe & there are NO leftovers!

I’m very pleased how this turned out! Minor substitutions of dried oregano and black olives (on hand) and I added a few of the  jalapeño seeds. I also sautéd spinach in the saucepan after putting in oven which nicely flavored it. I would definitely make again with any white flaky fish.

Very good.  Made a few changes, different fish, used caper berries instead of capers.  The reminder of the recipe was unchanged. 
The dish was light, zesty and very moist and flavorful.

I put ground ginger all over the fish first.  Then placed the red snapper on a bed of sliced green onions, limes, and finely diced tomatoes. Followed the recipe and finished by topping it with sliced limes covering it with aluminum foul and baking it. It came out great!

Really liked it. Recipe was straightforward. The jalapeño and limes added a nice flavour. No fishy taste. Preparation took longer than indicated and should be done in advance.

DH said best Pescado Veracruz he’s had (and it’s one of his favorite dishes)! I cheated some using a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of cherry. I also cooked the fish in the skillet with the tomato mixture instead of baking. Covered with a lid and let it simmer. Worked perfectly and fewer dishes! Served over rice with a side of black beans and corn tortillas. Thanks Chef John for creating!!

Delicious. I used tilapia, doubled the recipe and put them all in one baking dish for simplicity. I boiled linguine in the leftover sauce and definitely recommend the result. I absolutely will make again, hopefully with red snapper this time.

This a very tasty dish!  I bought cod from Costco and wanted to prepare it with a moist sauce.  This fit the bill.  The sauce is so tasty, next time I will make double the sauce!  Keeping this in my rotation.

This was my first time eating snapper and I really enjoyed this dish. I omitted the olives (because I did not have any) and substituted a orange pepper for the jalapeno. Still very tasty even without the spicy flavor.  Thank you Chef John!

I will do it again, but next time using Snapper (I substituted Petrale Sole ... overpowered by flavors), and green olives instead of the Kalamata olives I used (too salty). 
Even so it was easy, and tasty! Thank you, Chef John!!

I have made this recipe many times now. I (and all who have eaten it) LOVE it.  I have made it to true to the original recipe and made adjustments, based on what I had at the time, and both are HITS!  I LOVE the detail of using  castelvetrano olives. Tonight I added poblano chile 'rajas' and Early Girl tomatoes that are in season. I make the sauce, let it cool, and let the fish marinate before hitting the oven.

I got an idea from this recipe, I sautéed cherry tomatoes, green pepper strips, and pepperoncini's using a little of the juice, in lieu of the capers, and olives [ which I do not care for ],. When the veggies were at the softness I like, I put them in a shallow metal dish, and placed  a nice piece of fresh striped bass on top, and baked it on top of the veggies. It came out perfect, and the pepperoncini's gave it a nice little zing. I will be experimenting further with pepperoncini's in the future, I had forgotten how much I enjoy their flavor !                                                                                                                I will definitely be putting finely chopped pepperoncini's in my next Italian sausage calzone !

I used cod.  I didn’t layer the fish, in individual serving dishes like in the video.  I baked it in the same pot I made the sauce.  I served it with mixed roasted vegetables.  I would make it again because it was delicious, light and fresh.

It’s a great recipe if you are looking for a kick of spice. It’s also a nice color that adds more of appeal to the dish.

Didn't have all ingredients but came close enough using jalopeno stuffed olives instead of capers and jalopeno pepper and fresh basil instead of oregano. Added sweet red pepper too. A keeper for sure! Actually very filling

This was a new recipe for us, my refrigerator is scarce at the moment so I had to substitute jarred jalapeños and canned tomatoes and I was still delicious!!! This is going on the regular routine. yummy

This is a terrific recipe that I will be making A LOT!  The only change I made was in the cooking step.  I saved a bit of time and clean up by using the same skillet for both the stove-top cooking and oven cooking.  If anyone also does this, just be certain that the skillet (including handle) is tempered for high oven temperatures.

This was very good. No red snapper at the grocery yesterday so I used swai which turned out well.  Fish was ready in 15 minutes.  Served with corn salad (recipe on this website) which was outstanding.

Love this.  So simple. The only thing is that I was not paying $22 a pound for snapper so I used Baramundi instead and it was just as good.

I used tilapia instead of red snapper and it came out great! It was very flavorful and the jalapeños and pepper definitely added some heat to it. For the lime, I actually squeezed it on the fish before I put it in the over and after it cooked. Certainly a healthy and yummy dinner!

While I liked it, it was not to the taste of the rest of the family. They didn't like the olives and the capers.This is not a fault of the recipe, it was just a subjective no.

I used 3 red snapper filets as that is what a friend sent fresh from Seattle. I baked them in a cast iron skillet and broiled it for 3 minutes at the to "brown it up a little". This was a fun and easy meal to prep.

Found this recipe after searching for a different way to prepare fish which we usually cook on a grill or BGE. A nice change of pace. Makes a low cal, highly nutritious dinner. Kept a freshly caught mangrove (a/k/a gray) snapper for this recipe. Made as written except for subbing black for green olives. Another keeper from Chef John!

I thought this recipe was good, but not my favorite for red snapper.  I want to try it again, using boneless chicken breasts.  I made it as written, and will do so again when I try the chicken.

OMG this is restaurant quality!  My mom made something similar to this with Spanish mackerel when I was growing up.  I live on the Gulf and have my choice of fresh seafood.  I picked up some red snapper today and know Chef John has awesome recipes.  I wanted something different then my typical roasted fish and this dish was just out of this world!  I didn't have olives so I added additional capers.  It was so umpcious!  I didn't add red pepper as the spice was already perfect with the jalapeño.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you Chef John!

OMG! Is all my wife had to say! Simply delicious.  I made this with Mahi-Mahi filet and followed the recipe as close as I could with what I had on hand.  Didn't have fresh oregano so used dried and I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I used a very like seasoning of dried pepper flakes.

This is a wonderful recipe that my family loved. We're not big on jalapenos, so I skipped that. I'm sure this tastes different without it, but we still loved it. This'll be a fish recipe we come back to again and again.

I made it with Red Snapper, which had a wonderful texture to it. I also made it with shrimp, cooking them right along with the Snapper. I served it on a bed of white rice.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have used this for any white fish that we want to spice up.  You can control the heat and it just adds to the flavor of the fish.  This is a family favorite.

Absolutely fabulous! I used large Gulf shrimp and Kalamata olives.  It was such a pretty and colorful dish, not to mention delicious.  I did have to bake the shrimp a few extra minutes.  This would be a great company dish and so easy to fix.
Be sure to have crusty bread to soak up the juices.

One of my standby fish recipes.  Love this recipe. My variation - I never put in the jalapeno or cayenne pepper.

My kind of recipe. This was delicious, inexpensive (snapper was on sale), easy on the waistline, and a snap to make. I just had green olives with pimentos so used that. Absolutely will make again. I think this would also be good with shrimp over Spanish style rice.

Really delicious meal. I doubled it for 4 and it was perfect. We all enjoy a bit of spice and this was just right. Little bit of spice without being overpowering. I layered it as per the recipe then to serve, cut it into 4 chunks so everyone was served with layers of the fish and sauce.

I have made this recipe several times and I absolutely love it! I would say that I have been on Allrecipes for about 10 years and this is probably my favorite. So flavorful!

Since I don't like fish, I made mine with a boneless/skinless chicken breast and my husbands with halibut.  We both thought it was awesome.   The sauce is super flavorful and not overly spicy.  Next time I will double the sauce and put it over some angel hair pasta.

Awesome recipe! I did change things a little bit to my  taste. I fried the snapper whole and added it to the sauce later. I added some tomato sauce to the fresh tomatoes, I used pickled jalapeños instead of fresh, and red chili paste instead of cayenne. I also added cumin, thyme, dried red chilis and paprika. Loaded with flavor!!! My husband is asking for this to be a staple. Thanks for the great recipe

I absolutley loved this receipe! It is not only delicious it is a beautiful dish! The only change I made was I only used 1/4 of a jalapeño. The first time I made it I thought it was just a tad too spicy for my taste. I also used just a little less of the cayenne pepper. I would suggest tasted a small piece of the Jalapeño to see how spicy it is because they vary so much in heat.  I've made this receipe 3 times and loved it!

Excellent with just a delicate little bit of spiciness to it. This is a recipe that is so adaptable.  I added a little sweet green pepper and a plum tomato that I had on hand, and opted for Poblano peppers which are spicy, but are much milder than jalapeno peppers. The sliced cherry tomatoes gave this a really fresh taste. I used a combo of basil and oregano and just a bit of fresh ground black  pepper. Served over a  Long Grain and Wild Ready Rice for ease. This makes a tasty broth.  Thin asparagus with lemon/pepper made it all come together. If you prep everything this is an excellent recipe when entertaining. Just  pre-assemble and pop it in the oven when ready.

So good! My husband loves fish I get bored with it but this recipe was colorful with a nice balance of flavors and delicious. I used tilapia, a lil extra jalapeños and no olives because I was out. I heated up 2 tablespoons of sour cream with 1/8 top of chili powder that I topped the fish with before serving. The creaminess went so good with the tartness of the pickled jalapeños and capers.

Love the this recipe! Such and easy yet tasty way to prepare fish.  My kids are  really picky eaters, but they really enjoyed this one : ).
 I just add some coconut milk right before baking to add some creamy taste to it.

Made exactly as written except used Tilapia and regular sliced green salad olives.  Quick and delicious!  Don't be afraid of using fresh jalapenos.  After sauteeing with other ingredients and baking in the oven, they aren't hot.  Have made twice and will be making often!   Everyone loved it!

Nice recipe and fun to make. I needed to cook longer than recommended as the bottom piece of fish was under cooked. I just nuked it a bit and it was still fine.

Wow! This was so good. I followed the recipe except I used one extra jalapeno.  I used cod because it was on sale, and served it with tortillas and rice. I am in love, I will definitely make this again.

This is definitely a keeper! Followed the recipe exactly except doubling the sauce and putting it over the separately grilled cod fillets at the end.  Flavors are intense and wonderful and this topping would definitely work with your favorite flaky white fish. Will be making this often.

Was awesome!!  Made pretty much as stated.  The only difference was that I used Tilapia as that is what I had, so really no change.  I served it with mashed cauliflower on the side and I must say it looked and tasted like a restaurant quality dish if I dont say so myself.  Will definitely be making this again and would make for company.  Easy to make as well

What a great recipe, I didn't change a thing. I did use mahi mahi which is what I had on hand. Next time I'll use more capers since I really like the briny taste they add. Thanks Chef John.

So delicious! The crunchy olives make this! I doubled this and baked in a 9 x13 glass dish. My market didn't have fresh snapper, so used fresh cod with great taste and texture.

Absolutely loved it!  Easy to make & truly delicious.  Wasn't able to get pickerel so used tilapia, and cut back a bit on the garlic as that's not our favourite.  Didn't have the small pans as shown in the video, so placed the fish layers on a leaf of kale, then spooned a bit of the juices over top.  Yummy!  Will make again and again...  :)

Used corvina (sea bass) instead and it was fantastic. Next time, I'll marinate the fish in some olive/caper/lemon juice ahead of time. Also, I forgot to salt/pepper the fish as I put it in the baking dish, so that would probably help. Served with spinach and homemade baked tortilla ships.

My husband used to own a seafood restaurant in Nuevo Vallerta.    He loves really good seafood!!    I made this with cabrilla (sea bass) and we simply loved it!!   Had to use tiny orange tomatoes (couldn't find the red ones here in Mexico), but they were just fine.    Company food at its best!!!   Thanks Chef John for another winner.

I used talapia. I don't like olives. Added zucchini. No capers. Went 50/50 freshed squeezed lime and orange juice. I often use orange with lime in Mexican recipes. 

Loaded with flavor and delicious. Pretty spicy tho but I like it that way. 

My girlfriend loved it. Will make it again

Question... My husband hates olives  but this sounds so yummy!! Has anyone tried it without olives (or by subbing something else) and was it tasty as well?? 

I'm making this for MYSELF using my garden veggies when hubby is OOT... This sounds delish!!

Added cheese towards the end.  Used rockfish we caught, tomatoes I canned, and chile my uncle gave us from Santa Fe.  So, yeah... it was good!  Served simply with avocado, tortillas, and wine.

The family all loved it;  substituted jalapeno with 2 small banana peppers with one small ghost pepper. Also used small tomato from the garden along with our homegrown bulb onion. Cooked it for 18 minutes but next time will cook for 13-15. Snapper was fresh as my son and I went on a fishing trip the day before.

Had some fresh caught red fish that I wanted to cook up for a lunch with guests. I omitted the capers and the jalapenos because I knew at least one guest was allergic to both, and I couldn't find the fancy olives, so I used less expensive sliced green olives. Still turned out great. I used roma tomatoes and, because I don't like cooked tomatoes with the skin on, I blanched the tomatoes first so I could peel the skins more easily, then chopped and added to the onions and garlic. I added the olives before baking and mixed it all together with some fresh basil and oregano. I also marinated the fish in a little olive oil, some seasonings, and a splash of white wine I needed to use up while I chopped the onion, blanched the tomatoes, and then made the sauce. When the sauce was done, I put down a layer in the bottom of a 9x13, put down the fish filets, and topped with more sauce. Turned out great - everyone raved about it. Even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, it was a great starting point, and I bet it would have been just as good - and possibly even better - with the ingredients I had to omit.

We aren't crazy about capers, so left them out. A winning recipe! We served it with Motor Mouth's Taco Rice (also on Allrecipes.com).

Excellent! I've made this with red snapper, halibut, and another flaky whitefish (can't recall which one), and it tastes great on all of them! I made it with fresh sweet cherry tomatoes as well as canned, and discovered that I like a combination of the two. I used canned diced tomatoes that I further diced, and yellow sweet cherry tomatoes. The added color is nice. This was easy to make and easy to clean up.  I serve it with a side of sautéed peppers (red, yellow, orange) & onions.  I just sauté them in a little oil, salt, pepper, garlic, ancho chili pepper, and whatever else grabs my attention in the spice rack! This creates a filling, low calorie, highly nutritional meal.

Excellent recipe!  Quick, healthy and so tasty.  Used jalapeno stuffed green olives and seeded and chopped tomatoes and omitted the oregano as I didn't have any.  Even my husband who doesn't like fish, enjoyed it.
