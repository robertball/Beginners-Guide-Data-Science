Fantastic!  This is the best tuna salad I have ever tasted!  The first time I made it I used chunk light tuna, and tonight I used albacore...it's great either way.  I don't understand why some reviews state that there's too much mayo or dill.  When draining the tuna, I use the lid of the can to squeeze it dry.  Isn't that how everyone does it?  It makes quite a stiff mixture this way.  I also used the straight edge of a spatula to level off each measuring spoon and get an accurate measurement of each ingredient.  My 7th grade home economics teacher was a stickler about this.  I find this especially important when using the more potent herbs and spices such as in this recipe.

Anyway...I simply ate this on a slice of sundried tomato bread from my local bakery.  I was planning to toast it first but I couldn't wait!  It was delicious!  Once this is refrigerated overnight and served on bakery bread with romaine lettuce, swiss cheese and a slice of garden-ripened tomato it is a ten star recipe for certain!

Just thought I'd share my twist to this wonderfully flavored salad!!! I used only 1 T. lite Miracle Whip just to give moisture and The Pampered Chef Dill seasoning mix for the dill and garlic.  It was JUST the VERY low fat change I wanted so I could add more healthy tuna to my diet.   Thanks soooo much!!!

I searched for a tuna salad recipe that was a little different from the norm.  I doubled this recipe and found that the taste was just ok, but easily modified to be GREAT!   First of all, I would cut down on the amount of relish and parsley and add a little more cheese.  I used fresh onion since I don't keep minced dried onion in the house.  It took about 2 Tbl of the onion to make it "show up" in the taste of this recipe.  That's 2T total for this recipe DOUBLED.  I know I will make this again, but with a few little tweaks that I mentioned.  Also, don't be afraid of the curry.  It is excellent in this dish!

I've prepared this a few times for several different people and everyone loves it. I do use less mayo in mine, fresh, finely diced onion (maybe 2 Tbsp., more than a pinch of garlic powder, half the parsley and I have taken to adding a bit of diced cucumber, as well. Customize to suit your own taste... the basic recipe is a winner. Highly recommended. Thanks, TANAQUIL!

Barbie I have to hand it to ya - you've taken tuna salad to whole new level.  This stuff is really, really good.  I normally don't like sweet pickle relish in tuna salad, but for some reason it works here.  I used 1/4 tsp. of dried minced onion flakes and was a bit liberal with the garlic powder.  I also added a bit of salt and pepper.  I have to say, this is probably one of the best tuna salads on this site.  It was so good I whipped up a second batch and made a sandwich for my husband to take to work tomorrow.  He's not a huge tuna salad fan, but I bet this will turn him into one. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good tuna salad recipe! I cannot understand why some people don't follow the recipe or don't like an ingredient or two, then give the recipe a poor rating. I changed a few things because of mine and my family's tastes. I added some hard boiled eggs, more onion, a dash of yellow mustard and a pinch of tarragon. I usually do a little tweaking to most recipes I as I've been cooking for 40 years and know what my family likes. But if a recipe I've seen here doesn't turn out well and I have altered it, I would NEVER come here and give it a poor rating since I changed it! We LOVE this tuna salad and I would never have thought to use some of the ingredients in it (such as Parmesan and curry powder), so THANK YOU TANAQUIL!

This is my one of my favorite sandwiches.   I can't eat the tuna plain anymore after this recipe.   I ran out of dill weed so I just made it without it the other day and I liked it even better without it.   I make this recipe regularly now.

This is a great unique take on traditional boring tuna salad.  I LOVED the curry addition.  As most have stated, I used quite a bit less mayo, 2 TBL, and replaced with Mircale Whip, as I like the flavor better.  I also decreased the relish to 2TBL, as I wanted the tuna flavor to be more recognizable.  Fantastic!

Thanks so much for this great recipe! The only change I made was to use less mayo (about 4T.) My husband and I love curry so this was a match made in heaven for us. I use the tuna in the pouch which I think is moister and has a better flavor. This is the tuna salad I'll make from now on!

To me, when I imagine what tuna should taste like, THIS is it. The ingredients in this recipe just seem to compliment tuna perfectly. The only change I make is using Miracle Whip instead of mayo (but that's just a personal taste preference... I don't like mayo). Like several other reviewers, I usually double this recipe, which then fits perfectly into a medium bowl. I highly recommend using the Starkist Chunk Light PACKETS (in water) when doubling this recipe. The texture of the tuna is perfect for this recipe, you can buy 1 large packet (11 oz.) and 1 small packet (2.6 oz) which is the perfect amount of tuna for a double batch (0.4 oz does not make a difference), and all you have to do is dump the packets directly into the bowl (no draining). Another useful tip when doubling this recipe is to just use 3/4 cup of mayo (or Miracle Whip) instead of taking the time to measure out 12 tablespoons... this will save you a lot of time. I'm not trying to insult anyone's intelligence with a lesson in conversions or anything... just trying to be helpful!

Wow.  This is the best!  Thanks for divulging this secret recipe.  Now I know why your sister would be mad. I just finished making this for the kids and husbands lunches but after licking the spoon I almost polished it off myself right out of the bowl I prepared it in.  Thanks again for a fresh spin on plain old boring tuna sandwiches.

Try it with chickpeas! Make a vegetarian version by draining and rinsing a can of chickpeas instead of tuna. Mash with a potato masher and follow the recipe as written or however you have adjusted it to your tastes. Sooo yummy!

Excellent combination of ingredients.  Easy to make and done with items one usually has on hand!  The pickle relish, dill and curry powder really made this version stand out.  I followed it to the "T"!  Thanks for sharing Barbie!  I will use this recipe over and over.

Fabulous!  Although I like tuna salads with sweet pickle relish, my family do not.  I omitted the relish and added a chopped hard boiled egg.  This is a keeper - the curry and dill balance well.

1 word- Yummy!!!! 

The comb of curry and parm are new to me for tuna. But I will be making this tuna recipe instead my old one for now. Now I was a little notty, and added tablespoon of bacon bits pieces that you buy at the store to it, and I added a little salt and pepper to taste, and  little lemon juice for brightness. Instead of dried parsley for color i had real parsley. And instead of dried onion flakes I used a half of a shallot, it is milder than onion and also the color was nice. I used dill relish instead of sweet, because I was going for more savory flavor. I scaled back on the mayo and just added it until i got a lite mayo consistency. It was the best Tuna I ever made. YUM! My friends went nuts for it.

I'm not a big fan of tuna salad but tried this and it tasted great! I omitted the onions and added golden raisins. The only thing I'd change for myself next time is to use less mayonnaise as the salad was a little too wet.

I honestly don't understand all the rave reviews on this one.  I made it as written except for using real onion and less mayo and I thought it was barely palatable.  I thought the ingredients sounded a bit odd together but I had to try it since so many people loved it.  I thought the dill to be an overwhelming flavor (and I love dill) and the only thing the parsley did was add more green funky color.. maybe fresh would add more flavor?  The addition of parmesan did nothing for this but add more calories.. again maybe a good quality fresh grated parm would've added the zip I was expecting.  I couldn't even taste the curry in this because my taste buds were overwhelmed with dill and sweet pickle.  I wouldn't even attempt this again even with some changes.  I didn't like it at all!

My can of tuna was 6 ounces.  I used the 6 oz can but halved all the other ingredients.  I just couldn't do 6 T of mayo...too fattening.  It came out fabulous...made 2 very nice sized sandwiches.  I did add a bit of seasoned salt.  I toasted on the griddle with a slice of havarti....yummy.

Thanks so much for sharing this Tanaquil!!!! This is delicious! This is a nice change to tired tuna salad. I used 4 TBS of Mayo and I think I would have been happy with 3 TBS. Also, I want to add that I think that this is better after it has sat in the refrigerator overnight, giving the flavors a chance to marry. See submitted photo. Thanks again!

I love tuna, and wanted to find a good tuna salad recipe.  After seeing the overwhelmingly great reviews and watching the video, I knew I'd love this.   I do add chopped celery to mine.  I just like the crunch. 

This was absolutely delicious.  Since I love "extra" everything, I do double all the measurements (except the tuna and the mayo).  I've made this so many times, I've lost count.  

I eat it plain.  No lettuce, no bread, and no crackers.

This is an EXCELLENT base recipe. I made a couple modifications. I added 1 boiled egg per can of tuna. I also sauteed celery,onion and garlic in place of the onion flakes and garlic powder. The amount to use of the three depends on your preferred tastes. I also added a 1 cup of pepperjack cheese (or your preferred kind of SPICY cheese).

I just made this for the first time today and it was great. It has such a wonderful taste and when you keep in the frig for a couple a hours its even better. I used 2 (5oz.) cans of tuna and drained well, and used recipe as is, and it comes out very chuncky. Thanks for a great recipe Barbie

One word:  YUMMY

This is the best tuna salad I've had. Made a minor sub as my hubby is not a fan of mayo. I did have the mayo and supplemented the other half with mustard (it worked).  I found myself adding a pinch more of the spices (I love super flavor in my food). Overall it was delicious and will never follow any other Tuna Salad recipe!  This was a great recipe contribution !!!

Wow! This is delicious, definitely our favorite, and we enjoy it every few weeks! I was hesitant about the curry at first, (and my husband thinks he doesn’t like it!) but mixed with the sweet relish, dill, etc. it adds a unique and excellent flavor. I make a triple batch and use two cans of red tuna and one of albacore. I also adjust the seasonings and use double the curry and garlic, and about two tablespoon of the onion flakes (triple batch) which have the perfect flavor for this tuna salad.  I also add some sliced green onions and do cut down on the mayo a bit.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe! It makes it easy to add more fish to our diet.

The dill really is too much.  And the amount of mayo makes it too soupy.   I went exactly by the recipe.

It was great but the sweet pickle relish and the dill over powered the tuna to were i could not taste the tuna or any other ingredient. i will only use half next time and will add hard boiled eggs. it felt naked without them.

The flavor of this tuna salad is unparalleled.  However, the amount of mayonnaise called for places it just at the border of "soupy."  I suggest adding mayo slowly to the other ingredients, in order to obtain the texture you most like.

This is the best tuna salad I have ever tasted! I did use less mayo but, to me, the flavor is wonderful! I just want to know where to buy a 7 oz can of tuna...

I don't understand how this recipe works for some people.  I used a standard can of tuna which was 5 oz (recipe calls for 7 oz can, but our cans aren't that size) and only 4 T mayo.  It reached a soup-like consistency (and yes, I drained the tuna) to the point where I had to add another 5 oz can of tuna just to thicken it up to a normal texture, and it was still too runny for my taste.  The parmesan was overwhelming.  I did like the curry/dill combination and plan to use that in my tuna in the future, but otherwise this recipe wasn't so great for me.

Delicious--also tasted great after a few days in the fridge because the spices all came together.

I agree it's easier (and better) to eye the ingredients and add more/less of what you like.  In addition, hard boiled eggs and/or little noodles add a great more salad-y treat.  It also tastes great on a croissant as a fantastic light lunch.

I love tuna salad! I make mine so different, but this was real good and different, I didn't use onions flakes, I chopped red onion instead and used fresh parsley and my own canned green pepper relish. It was so good. Thanks for posting, I never would have thought to put these ingredients in tuna salad.

I really enjoyed this tuna salad!    I've eaten tuna a lot over the years with just mayo and recently switched to low fat ranch dressing.  I think I'll use this recipe for tuna when not making tuna salad using pesto!

Very good tuna salad!  I didn't have any curry powder, but it was great without it.  It has a very gormet taste to it, and I wish I would have had some good bread to do it justice!

This was an excellent recipe. My changes were - mayo to our taste, no dill, and a little onion powder instead of the flakes. 

I used solid white tuna and added a little dill relish instead of the sweet. 

We made tuna melts, on broiled garlic french bread, with a slice of baby swiss. The whole family loved it.

Ok, no offense, but this was not good. I was surprised as I have never given less than 4 stars for something so highly rated by others. I work with a all men who will eat anything & even they said this was awful. I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed in the overall flavor of this. I will stick to the standard from now on...onion, sweet relish & mayo.

i changed the relish to dill instead of sweet since i dislike sweet relish, and i usually sub 1/2 of the mayo with sour cream. but, the flavors in this recipe are awesome, and i love it with either tuna or chicken.   thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! Outta control good!  If you want to take it totally over-the-top, use fresh dill and parsley, finely chopped red onion, a little more garlic, and fresh grilled Ahi tuna instead of canned (great way to use left-overs because Ahi isn't so great the next day by itself). The only thing I added that the recipe didn't call for was a splash of lemon.  Served on rye with romaine lettuce, baby swiss and tomato. THANK YOU BARBIE!!!

Tuna salad is one of my favorites. THIS tuna salad is my VERY FAVORITE. So, so yummy! We made double the recipe, and the only change we made, is that we added 4 chopped eggs. This is the recipe that I will use from now on. Thanks for the recipe :-)

Always hate to write a bad review, but I am afraid that I must.  We really did not like this.  I used a 12 oz. can of tuna and it was drowning in the 6 T. of mayo.  Had to add an entire additional 12 oz can and it was still a bit too moist for us.  And we did not think that the seasonings complemented the tuna.  Sorry.  With all of the great reviews this has received, we are certainly in the minority in our opinion.  But there you are.

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a way to make a curried tuna salad that wasn't bitter. I used a little less mayo and pickle relish and a touch more curry powder. Chopped half an apple and threw a handful of cashews and raisins in there, too. This easily stretches one 6 oz can of tuna into two generous sandwiches. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this tuna salad recipe was good, but unremarkable. I was really hoping the curry and parmesan would give it a unique "grown-up" twist but those flavors virtually disappeared and if I hadn't made it myself I wouldn't have questioned the addition of any unique ingredients. I must admit that I was forced to tweak it slightly by what I had on hand: I used dill relish instead of sweet and just 1/4 tsp of dillweed, finely chopped fresh onion instead of flakes, and omitted the parsley. Still, it was the curry and parmesan that I was really counting on to give it some kick. It just wasn't there.

This is awesome!  I was a little skeptical about dill and curry together, but I absolutely love both spices and it's a very delicious combination.  However, I did only use 6 tablespoons of mayo and added more curry because I less mayo and I love curry.  I suggest you try this!  It's delicious!

FAN..TAS...TIC!!  This was wonderful.  The curry makes a ton of difference.  I added chopped celery for crunch and since I had an onion that needed to be used, I substituted that for dried.  This was wonderful on crunchy, freshly toasted French bread.

I made this and it was delicious! Also, I didn't have any curry so I left it out, and it was great! Next time I will have to try it with the curry. Overall this is an excellent recipe and I will definitely use it again!

A wonderful blend of ingredients to produce an excellent tuna salad. Tweaked one thing by reducing 6 tablespoons mayo to 2 tablespoons and subbing 2 tablespoons Hidden Valley Lite Ranch dressing and adding some sweet pickle juice. We made flour tortilla wraps with romaine lettuce leaves and tuna salad. Makes for a quick and yummy lunch!!

I loved it!! I will make this again. I didnt use sweet relish, I preferred using dill relish. I chose to boil some boiled eggs too and it was great. Thanks for your recipe.

Curry and parmesan in tuna salad?  I made the recipe with everything but the mince onion flakes.  The taste is just plain weird.

I discovered there was only dill relish in the pantry and no onion flakes. Everything else was added and it was great. Ok, so I did add more cheese, but we love parmesan.

I just made this and it's really nice!  I was longing for more crunch.. like onion or pickles..  I also added some boiled eggs.  Stretched it further, but I'd double the spices if I did it again.. and maybe add scallions or onions.  Really was a nice twist though. Gotta give you that!

Yay!!!  Found a tuna salad  I really like!  Very good. Made it for the secnd time today,and decided it is going to be my, go-to good sandwich or fork, for a quick lunch for my 2yr old daughter. (she just ate it without the bread today, and dogged it)  Didn't use the onion flakes,since the bottle we have is at least 7 yrs old (ya,toss it) used a little onion powder instead.  Was really leary about all the ingredients..but it rocked!  Thanks!  Oh..and there were no ill effects from the curry.  ;)

No one liked the curry flavor in the salad.  I think
it was a nice change but I love the flavor of curry.

I really wanted to love this recipe based on the reviews, but I just don't :(  Followed the recipe exactly.  You need the full 6 tablespoon of mayo if you properly drain your tuna.  Not too moist at all.  I think one full tsp of dill is too much.  That's all I can taste.  It's defiantly edible, just not the best tuna salad I've ever had.  I think the reason for such high ratings is because just about everyone tweaks the recipe for their own taste.  How can you properly rate something when you're not following the original recipe?  I think the flavors might mix a little after it sits in the fridge a bit and it will taste better.  But based on my first taste I can only give it 2 stars.

I was hesitant to try this recipe the first time as it does not contain the more traditional ingredients of chopped onion (fresh), celery and egg. But this is not your traditional tuna salad! It is WONDERFUL. I made it exactly as listed the first time (5 stars as is!!) but did find it a but heavy on the mayo for our taste.  The following times I made it, I cut back on the mayo.
I would highly recommend trying this just as it is though...as you will want to make this again!  Then tweak it according to your preferences!  SO GOOD!  Don't be afraid of the curry and parmesan cheese - everything melds together beautifully!

I made this for my dad today (he's the only one that likes tuna salad) and he loved it! I used Miracle Whip (his favorite) and only used 3 tablespoons...which was the perfect amount. Also, didn't have any parsley so I used dried basil instead...thanks, will be making often.

If you are not a big fan of curry, you won't want to try this recipe. I spent 20 minutes trying to fix it and never could.It has a wierd taste. I like curry in some things but NOT in tuna salad.

This was a nice change and it still keeps the taste of tuna salad. I used a fresh minced red onion, fresh parsley and chopped garlic clove as I don't keep the dry stuff on hand. Will make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe, thank you!  I made a few adjustments as previously suggested, but I also added this base to some spiral pasta - and put together a tuna pasta salad.  Absolutely scrumptious!  I added a bit of fresh garlic, cayenne pepper, chopped celery, and rather than sweet relish, I substituted with just regular dill pickle, chopped in circles.  Once done, I placed chopped avocado on top of the salad.. and viola!  A wonderful summertime lunch or dinner. :) This will be such a fun recipe to play around with - but the main spices/herbs should definitely remain.. as they are what make this tuna salad so unique and tasty.

This was really great!  I modified it a bit: 2 cans of tuna, 1 tsp of creole seasoning, left out curry, dill, parsley, and kept the rest the same.  Very good.  I served this in a green pepper for dinner and it was a hit.

The taste scored a perfect 5 from my husband and I. Then I totaled up the fat grams and calories.  So I had to drop it down to a 4 star.  I used a 9 oz can of tuna and 4 T of Helmans mayo.  Unfortunately it was so good the 2 of us ate it all in one sitting wrapped in lettuce.  THEN I looked at the nutrition side of it and I don't feel good about what I ate.

This is for the entire recipe 
Total Fat 48 (40 was from the mayo alone)
Total calories 645 (360 wa also from the mayo)

But if you don't care about how many fat grams you're eating.... This recipe is amazing hands down. My husband complains every time I make tuna fish salad.  This time too.  Until his first bite that is.  I wrapped in lettuce leaves with garden fresh tomatoes.  I picked fresh parsley and onion from my garden to use instead of dried stuff and cut back from 6 to 4 T of mayo. Other than that I followed to a T.  You must try this recipe.

Followed the recipe and it ended up tasting ok on a baguette with lettuce and Swiss for a quick sandwich. I doubled the recipe so I had some left over that I just put into the fridge. When I tried it with some crackers two days later, wow! The flavors had time to really pop and tasted amazing, especially the curry! I recommend preparing and leaving it to sit in the fridge overnight before serving it.

This recipe was fantastic.  I did however make a few changes, instead of dried parsley I used fresh and I used finely chopped fresh garlic and onion in place of onion flakes and garlic powder. Added to the texture of the pickles this made the recipe a chunky and tasty tuna salad to remember.

This tuna salad rocks!  The curry transformed what would normally be a pretty bland tuna salad into something out of this world!  This will be my go to tuna salad from now on.

Unfortunately as written this one really didn't work for me- so I played with it until it did.  I doubled the parmesan, upped the garlic powder to 1/4 tsp, and added 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp celery seed, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp sriracha.  If I were to make this again I would also back way off on the mayo, it was just swimming in it.

I thought this would be an interesting tuna recipe to try, but I found it was quite unpleasant.  Too much dill and pickle relish.  Had to perform magic in order to eat it.  I'm so glad I'm not in need of a great tuna salad recipe as I already make one.  I tried this one against my better judgement. - KRuss

Tried this concoction just to change things up.  Spice mixture was awful and the parmesan was the worst.  I doubled the recipe because I was service for 6 and no one ate any.  This is my first negative comment, but I wouldn't stray towards this recipe again.   Sorry!  :-(

Pretty much standardized on this recipe for my tuna salad, and I make it often. It's the curry - fantastic!

This is a pretty good tuna salad.  I am personally just not crazy about the dill.  I may try leaving it out next, but that is just a personal preference.

This is the best! Not your traditional tuna salad at all so if your partial to your traditional tuna salad skip this recipe because it is quite different. I however am very picky about tuna and rarely do I order it when I'm out. I usually find tuna bland, too fishy, dry and plain. This is perfect and I don't change a thing. I put it on french bread and melt cheddar on top in the oven to make tuna loafes. So Yummy!

I did not have curry powder or regular mayonnaise on hand.  Instead I had chipotle mayonnaise and used that.  This tuna recipe is by far the best I have tasted.  I put the spread on a flat bread with lettuce and provolone cheese - Yummy.

I was looking for something different, it sounded better than it tasted. Maybe because I had used tuna in oil (I bought by mistake) instead of whole filets. It wasn't bad, I do like curry but something was a little off on the taste. I might try it one more time with the white filets.

This makes a great meal when combined with pasta to make a "cold tuna pasta salad" which I made last night. I love curry in my egg salad so I thought I try it in tuna-so glad I did.  Used 3 5oz cans of tuna with approximately 1 1/2 pounds of dried pasta and tripled the rest of the ingredients,  It fed 4 of us plus enough for leftovers for another meal.  Thank you Tanaquil for a quick easy recipe on a HOT summer day!

An odd combination I never would've considered, but it turned out really good. However, I used light mayo and reduced it to half.

I changed a few things as per what I had in my kitchen. I first used 2 cans of shredded tuna in sunflower oil, I used fresh onion about 1 small onion,only added 3 table spoons of mayo, I used dill pickles  and fresh dill and I added salt pepper and 1 TBL fresh lemon juice. I served it in a avocado. The first day it was good but a bit lemony but the second day it was so delicious we could not get enough if it. It was by far the best tuna salad I have ever had. Thank you so much for this recipe. It will be my go to from now on. Finger licken good

It was OK.... it seemed like a lot of stuff to add for just OK, so I think I'm going back to my way, with the addition of the curry powder, so thank you for that.

I just made this and used 2 cans of tuna. They were the same brand and looked like the same size but as I read their labels closer I noticed one was 5 oz and one was 6 oz. This may be why some people reviewers are saying there is too much mayo. I just put 2 or 3 tablespoons less in my mix and it turned out perfectly.

Delicous! A few notes..I did not use pickle relish, dill, or parsley. I added some finely chopped onion and raisins...served the tuna salad on toasted "everything" bagels. This was a terrific recipe for tuna salad...you can truly alter it to your specific tastes.

I made two batches of this Tuna Salad, one as written, for my kids and one lighter version, for myself. The recipe as written is very good and my kids loved it! As for myself, I liked it a little better with only 1 TBSP light mayo and 1 1/2 TBSP light Miracle whip and no Parmesan cheese. I've been searching a long time for great Tuna Salad recipe and this is it, thanks for sharing,TANAQUIL!!!

It is somewhat soupy - definitely needs less salad dressing/mayo or more tuna. And wow! That is just way too much dried green herbs! Green tuna salad? It looked like some kind of St. Patrick's Day version of tuna salad. Sorry but I can't figure out what other people like about this... Off to try another recipe.

This is the best tuna salad I have EVER had.  My husband even asked me to put the recipe in a place he'd be able to get to easily so he can make it all the time when I'm gone for work.  He usually just wings it when it comes to tuna salad, but he fell in love with this recipe.

This was...interesting. I normally just put chopped dill pickle, chopped red onion, fresh lemon juice with tuna and mayo but I wanted something different and this sure was different. I think it was a little too much dill for my tastes and the Parmesan was really nonexistent. I couldn't even tell it was in there. Maybe if I used fresh parsley, fresh chopped onion, fresh dill and fresh garlic instead of everything dried, I might like it better.

Sooooo good and tasty! We used light mayonaise, and it tasted great. It did seem like 7oz is probably enough for 4 servings for appetizers on a cracker but not for 4 sandwiches.

Wow! I just had this for lunch.. what an amazing flavor. Could really taste the curry and sweet relish, gave it such an interesting kick! Didn't have dried onion so used a little bit of onion powder instead. Next time I will probably just throw in some minced onion like others, and some celery too, maybe cut down a bit on the mayo. But seriously, just as I made it was really, really good!!

I needed to prepare a very light and simple dinner for my husband and I because we had a very late, heavy lunch.  I decided to prepare this and serve it in mini croissant rolls.  Hubby said he wanted only one, but after his first bite his words were " honey, you have this tuna stuff down...maybe I shouldn't have said I only wanted one", I too liked it very much and we'll be putting this in the keeper file for all of our future tuna salad sammies :-)  Thanks so much for sharing the recipes.

Really good and different from my standard tuna salad recipe.  To cut back on sodium, I used a can of really low sodium white tuna.  I didn't miss that salt one bit with all the other seasonings.  If you don't have sweet pickle relish, like me, try subbing sweet picked peppers, chopped fine.  They work and the colors actually look very pretty.  I served on fresh sourdough with romaine lettuce.  Oh, and mix all ingredients except tuna, then lightly flake/stir tuna into the mix.  I overblended my first batch and thought it was just too spreadlike (I don't know how else to write that).  Enjoyed this on road trip up to Denali Park Reserve, Sept 2010.

Just found this virtually by accident. In the midst of major yard work and worked up an appetite, but just didn't have time to run out either for groceries or food. With the sparse fridge, cluttered work space & oppressive heat outside, I wanted something cool, fresh, simple, quick & satisfying. Tuna salad sandwiches sounded spot on. After a quick search, found this recipe and had almost all the ingredients on hand. Whipped up a batch adding just a touch of salt & pepper. Substituted fresh cilantro for the parsley as that was the one thing I didn't have. Served it as sandwiches on hotdog buns with lettuce & tomato. Sooooooooo good!  What an unexpected treat on a sweaty workday! Thank you so much for sharing it.

I cannot BELIEVE how good this is!! Tuna is one of those things I can only eat in moderation because too much of it grosses me out. But, I could eat a gallon of this and still want more!! I didn't have any sweet pickle relish on hand, so I used diced sweet pickled squash. Heavenly. I'm going to go make another sandwich.

Since my cans of tuna were 5 ounces, I had to adjust the ingredient proportions a bit, but this was delicious! For 10 oz of tuna, well drained, I added 4 tbsp of mayo, 1.5 tbsp Parmesan, 5 tbsp sweet relish, no onion flakes because I didn't have any, 1/4 plus 1/8 tsp curry, no parsley, 1.5 tsp dill and some garlic powder. YUM!

This recipe is nothing less then amazing! I was going to stop eating tuna fish, After a last effort to eat up the last can of tuna in my pantry I decided to make this recipe. I AM SO GLAD I DID! Needless to say, Tuna fish is back on the grocery list :) Thanks Barbie! Oh one more thing :) I did cut back on the mayo but thats about it. I left the rest of it as is. Super great tuna fish - good enough to eat plain!

Sorry - I don't get all the five star reviews - this was just okay.  If you are going to make this - cut WAY back on the mayo - it was swimming in mayonnaise.

Yummy!  I didn't have any sweet pickle relish so I just chopped up some dill pickles.  I didn't think it needed all that mayo so I only used about 2-3 tablespoons.  This was a delicious lunch with some saltine crackers and tomato slices!  Will definitely make this again!

Where do you find a 7 oz can of tuna?  In the USA, they have reduced them all down to 5 oz !!  Incredible!   The reason that so many members are having trouble with the amount of mayo is because of this fact.   I adjusted the amount by putting in a small amount & adding to it until I got the correct consistency.  I used the other ingredients as listed without changing anything & it was delicious.

This was yummy.  I used fresh chopped parsley- about 3 Tablespoons before chopping, and one small chopped gherkin, and subbed the garlic powder with a teeny taste of jarred chopped garlic.  My next goal is to do the proportions for a 12-oz can of tuna.

I made this thinking that I would like it because of the sweet pickle relish in it.  Well, as it turns out, that's exactly why I wasn't crazy about it.  Maybe I should have used dill relish as some other reviewers.  I used chopped green onions instead of the dried, and I omitted the curry powder as I am definitely not a fan.  To me the parmesan cheese wasn't detectable at all in the finished salad.

OK--must say, a few things...Very very good recipe. I love curry and never thought of putting it on my tuna. However you have to watch the curry powder because it can over power the tuna flavor, plus you won't be able to taste the other spices in the recipe. I was worried in the middle of adding the mayo that it was too much, but as I put the other ingredients in, it worked out. I did use reduced fat mayo and ended up tasting to adjust more minced onion. I can say next time use fresh onion for the extra crunch. I didn't have sweet relish but had dill. And when the recipe calls for 7 oz of tuna, the common sizes at the grocery stores are 5 and 12. So use the 12 oz can, and totally drain off all excess oil or water, and it should equal out to 6-6 1/2 oz. I weighed it to be sure. (I weigh just about everything due to my strict diet intake). However, this was a really good twist in flavors on a tuna salad. I actually ate this on Wasa Light N Crispy Waferbread Crackers. Yummy!! Thanks

Speck,    Use grated.  Preferably some you have freshly grated.  Too many off tastes from anti-clumping chemicals and preservatives in the others.

I am not a huge fan of sweet pickle relish nor am I a fan of dried parsley, dried dill, or curry.  So, what made me decide to try this recipe?  I guess the 97 degree heat went right to my head and I just decided to branch out a bit, take a walk on the wild side, and try a totally new tuna recipe.  I am glad that I did!  I used fresh parsley, fresh green onion instead of onion flakes, less dried dill than the recipe calls for,  about two tablespoons of sweet relish, and just slightly less than ¼ teaspoon of curry.  The parmesan cheese was so subtle and so good with the other flavors.  I cut back the mayo since I do not like a lot of mayonnaise and the cans of tuna today are only six ounces.  I found that two Tablespoons ended up being the perfect amount for our personal tastes.  This was good enough that I will buy fresh dill specifically for this recipe when I make it again. My friend declared this to be the best tuna she had ever had!

this is good stuff!! I have always loved tuna salad and this is a very good version. I esp. like the touch of curry powder. It adds just the right spice. I was out of pickle relish so I chopped up pickle slices instead and I used fresh instead of dried dill from my garden.

Way to much dill in this recipe. It was actually green. I measured it exactly although I had the web site to automatically scale the recipe to 12 servings maybe that was the problem. I fixed this for a birthday party some like it some not. Will never use this again.

I'm not impressed (sorry!). Made this earlier in the week for this week's lunches. Don't know what I did wrong.... Maybe I used too much mayo (I just squirted Miracle Whip into my tablespoon, but didn't level off for an EXACT measurement). Or, I could have done the same with the sweet rellish??? My tuna salad had a wierd yellow tint to it (maybe from the curry - but everyone's pics don't seem to appear yellow...). My mixture was also very thin, not thick like the tuna salad I am used to (i.e. mom's). Used 1 (6 oz.) can of white chunk tuna since all I could find were 6 or 12 oz. cans. My only other change was to add a pinch more minced onion and garlic powder than called for. Served spread on wheat crackers with a side of carrot sticks. Sorry, won't be making this ever again. So diasppointing (and this is all I brought for lunch today). It seemed to be a winning combination. Thanks anyways!

Try this recipe.  Don't be afraid.  The curry is subtle.  I have been loving tuna salad sandwiches forever - this recipe has brought me so much joy!  I am going to try this with chicken next.  C'mon, try it!

I am a tuna salad lover, and this one is by far my FAVORITE recipe I've found.  Sometimes I tweak it here and there when I make it (add hard-boiled eggs, or celery), but it is also perfectly tastey just the way it is written!!

Very yummy!  I really liked the addition of curry & parm. cheese.  I did double the amount of tuna & if I had another can, I would of probably added that too.  I only used 1T sweet relish since that was all I had & I think that was all it needed.  I did use fresh onion & parsley since I had it on hand.  Some previous reviewers commented it tasted better the next day, but, even though I made extra--there where no leftovers!  I will be making again.

I loved this tuna salad.  I doubled the recipe and put the tuna in single-serving tart shells (cream cheese tart shells from this site).  It turned out delicious!!!  The only thing I would change next time is to put less dill (it was just a little too much) and less mayonnaise.  Oh, and I replaced the minced onions with chopped fresh onion.

This is a really good tuna salad. I used a large (12oz) can of tuna - and kept all of the other ingredients the same. I liked that balance - any less tuna and I think the other things would have overpowered it...It was a little too dill-y for my personal taste - so next time I will reduce the amount of dill a bit...

I love this!  It's so different from your regular tuna salad.  Personally I enjoy this with less mayo is used, real pickels chopped as opposed to the relish, add in a rib or two of chopped celery for some crunch and a squirt of mustard.  Love this - Thank you!

I am now forced to eat tuna, as I am trying to eat healthy. To me,tuna really smells  fishy, although albacore is much better than chunk light, so it is a challenge to eat it.This recipe was great, however. We all liked it in my family-even the non tuna eaters (ever) liked it. Not at all fishy. Had tuna melts and will make sandwiches tomorrow.I suggest everyone else who wants to cut fat, try nayonaise (soy based substitute). It does not change the flavor in the recipe barely(there's some dijon in it, too)-I know as I tried it both ways. I prefer salt to sweet so I used dill pickles instead of sweet relish and probably used half the mayo-nayo portion. My husband liked it very much.

Different from my usual tuna salad - not a drastic change but the curry, parmesan and dill add a little "grown up" flavor, with no "canned tuna" aftertaste at all.  This is definitely my new tuna salad recipe.

My family did not like this recipe "as is".  My husband complained of heartburn all evening!  Even though I cut back on the mayo, it was far too wet for us.  And I thought the sweet pickle relish made the salad too sweet.  I may experiment with this again using even less mayo, fresh onion and parsley instead of dried, and no sweet relish (maybe dill relish would work??)

Wow!  great tuna salad.  i was looking for something special and this it.  i adjusted the mayo down a bit.  i thought it was too much but otherwise it is excellent.  at first i actually mixed a batch with my electric hand mixer and it kinda made it into something resembling a dip - and it was great.  i would serve it at parties but for a sandwich i think it needs less mayo.  very unique.  glad someone thought of it and shared.

I substituted the onion flakes for onion powder, but it didn't affect anything. The tuna was delicious, one of the best tuna salads I've ever had! It's crazy easy to make, inexpensive, and can be easily doubled or tripled.

This is so good! I used a 9oz can and used dill pickle relish. This ends up being two servings for 309 calories.

I would give his recipe 10 stars if I could!  This recipes raises tuna salad to a whole other level.  I ate it on a bed of mixed greens.  I only used 2 Tablespoons of mayo and found it to be enough especially because the relish made it moist and easy to mix.  I didn't add dill weed as I didn't have any.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for posting.

There's nothing I love more than a good tuna salad sandwich and I agree that this one is exceptionally good.    I didn't have relish on hand, so I left that out but I did add a few shakes of celery seed which I put in almost everything.  Love the way it turned out!

Best Tuna Salad Ever. I originally made this for my husband because I haven't been able to stomach tuna ever since I requested tuna fish everyday in kindergarten for lunch. (I'm 30 now lol) My teacher praised everyone so much for eating something so healthy! I tasted this recipe and I couldn't taste the fishiness of the tuna. I used olive oil mayo because it's my favorite. Also used dill relish instead because we don't like sweet, but probably wouldn't make much difference. I have also subbed canned chicken when I haven't had tuna and still wonderful!

This is the BEST tuna salad I have ever had!  I made it per the recipe the first time, and added boiled eggs the second time to stretch the recipe. Definitely a keeper. I'm a slap dash cook, but will use this recipe in the future for tuna salad.

Quick and easy with a twist on the usual.  Great on crackers or bread. I used a little less mayo, the can of tuna I used was only 5 ounces.

I thought it was amazing. My wife doesn't care for curry or sweet relish, so, I'm going to sub for curry as others have suggested and put in different bowls. 1. Creole seasoning 2. Chipotle (maybe fresh?) and 3. Paprika. We'll see which one works for her. Also going to sub fresh diced red onion, dill pickle, minced garlic, and add chopped celery as others suggested. I think the higher mayo content would go hand in hand with spreading on non buttered bread and to keep the sandwich from drying out in a catering truck scenario...so, I would also cut that back to preference, especially if using in lettuce wraps as we do. Nonetheless, Thank you very much for the share!!! It takes tuna and chicken salad to another level for sure!!

This recipe was outstanding. I loved the refreshing alternative to standard tuna salad. I usually don't read reviews when I see a 4+ star rated recipe. I loved the flavor combination just as the recipe depicts. I did however, use 3t of olive oil infused mayo (that was all I had) and half of an avocado which gives you a wonderful flavor with "good fat" content. I also used fresh sweet vadalia onion and added two finely chopped hard boiled eggs. Topped on a butter cresant and a side of grapes for a delicious lunch. Fantastic base recipe and the curry made this a home run for me. Yummy!

This is delicious!!  I used 8 oz of tuna (5 oz plus 3 oz cans), used dill relish instead of sweet (personal preference) and added 2 hardboiled eggs and fresh red onion instead of dried.  I also let it chill in the fridge a couple hours before serving.  I must say however if I didn't use the hardboiled eggs, 6 tablespoons of mayonnaise is way too much for such a little amount of tuna but with the eggs, it works (honestly I could probably scale back to 3-4 tablespoons with eggs and it would be super good too).  Served over lettuce leaves since I'm cutting back on carbs.  This is a winner!!!

This is a great base recipe! I made quite a few changes, but wanted to stay as true as possible to the original. First, I used 2- 5oz cans of tuna since that's what we had on hand. I used the amount of mayo suggested. I used dill relish rather than sweet because of my family's preference, and I used fresh parsley and onion. Overall, a fantastic recipe, and we will definitely make it again!

I wasn't real sure about the inclusion of pickle relish since I personally dislike it but the reviews were so positive I wanted to try it. I made a couple minor adjustments to a double batch.
I cut the mayo by 1/3 and substituted 1/4 tsp of dill seed for the 2 tsp dill weed suggested for a double batch. I also mixed sweet relish at a 50/50 ratio with Hellish Relish from Roxtar Gourmet for a bit more interest. 
Thanks Tanaquil! This stuff was a real hit and went like everyone's favorite ice cream. I served it with warm crusty home made bread wedges.

I just made this recipe and just finished wolfing it down on pumpernickel bread. I can confirm that 6 tbps. of mayo is not too much. I used 2 6 ounce cans of tuna, which, when drained was 8 ounces, according to the cans. I made the recipe exactly as indicated, except for the extra ounce of tuna. It was a nice sandwich. I tasted the relish and the curry the most. It was a touch too sweet for me. For my taste, I would throw in some salt or bump up the onion flakes a bit or downplay the relish a bit. I also used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo. I'll try it with Mayo next time. It was a darned good sandwich. I can't say it was the best, but maybe with some tweaking it could be.

Yum. This is great when you have not gone to the grocery store in forever. You don't need any fresh ingredients. Very flavorful and good. For us, it made two servings (two sandwiches). We actually had this for dinner two nights in a row! The second time used half mayo half plain yoghurt and it tasted the same.

This is a new favorite recipe of mine. I like to serve it as a wrap, rolled in a crispy lettuce leaf. The only changes I make are substituting cilantro for the parsley (just a preference) and adding celery for crunch. I also use fresh chopped onion in place of the onion flakes. Delicious.  This is so yummy and fresh tasting.(Honestly, the first time I made it, I thought the flavor was too strong and different...but after I ate the leftovers a couple times, it really grew on me. Now, I make it frequently.)  Thanks for sharing.

This is absolutely the best tuna salad recipe I have ever tried, and it's been my go to recipe for several years now (for everything from holiday appetizers to an everyday lunch).  Depending on your mood, you can easily insert or delete an ingredient (I often add Sriracha).  I've always made the recipe with dill pickles (because I hate sweet pickles), but after buying the wrong jar at the grocery, I made the recipe as is, and it was WONDERFUL.  Despite me hating sweet pickles, they added the perfect note of sweetness to the tang of the mayo, and heat of the curry (and Sriracha for me).  Don't discount this recipe just because it has an ingredient or two you don't like/never used, IT'S GREAT!

After all the great reviews, I just had to give this recipe a try and boy am I glad I did. The 1st time I made this I thought it was way too much mayo... But I followed the recipe to the T anyway... The taste was amazing... But it was a little too soggy for a sandwich...then I re-read the 'most helpful review' and realized I probably didn't drain the tuna as much as I should've. I made this again, making sure to drain the tuna really well (yes, with the lid) and the texture was perfect -as was the taste. I will be making this regularly now. Great recipe Barbie -thanks for sharing.

I add 2-3 hard boiled eggs and about a cup of chopped cabbage and let it sit in the fridge for at least a couple of hours and it comes out awesome! When I made it originally without eggs or cabbage I reduced the mayo so it came out drier; if you like how wet it is originally and have add-ins, you may want to up the mayo.

Fabulous! Substituted the curry for cayenne pepper for a bit of spice and it turned out delicious. The Parmesan cheese just does something for it and I would have never thought to put it in the tuna salad. Worth a try, quick and easy!

I always made tuna the same way, mayo and dill pickle relish... until I found this.  The curry caught my attention, so I made it and was very impressed and pleased with the taste of all the different ingredients.  I used less mayo and used hellmanns 1/2 the fat and reduced fat parm cheese.  My 11 year old son loved it and asked for me to make another batch :)

It's always great to find a recipe that is wonderful as written.  This is one of those recipes.  You can also change it to adapt to personal taste, and it is still as great as the original.  The second time around my changes were few - I like to reduce the mayo and add a little sour cream.  I also used finely minced Vidalia onion and just 2 Tbsp. pickle relish.  Wonderful!  The next time I may use Vidalia onion relish instead of the fresh onion and pickle relish.  I can't wait to make it again!

This is the PERFECT base tuna salad!  The first time I followed this recipe exactly and it was great.  The second time I subbed freshly chopped onion, and a little more curry (love curry).  The third time, I added some sliced grapes and it was SO GOOD (the curry and grapes play well together).  

The last time I made this, I went back to the original recipe (except used the fresh chopped onions) and made 6x this recipe for a big work lunch.  It scales perfectly.  One thing I did notice is that if you make it ahead and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, the flavors seem to meld/develop more, so I always make it a few hours ahead now.  THANK YOU for this super easy and tasty spin on tuna salad! :)

Very good recipe, thank you. I made mine with italian salad dressing and just 1 tbs mayo. The curry powder is wonderful in this recipe. I added chopped tomatoes for color. Served for my boys on sourdough and it was well received.

I've made this four times now.  I started with the original recipe exactly like it was listed.  For my hubby's taste there was too much mayo and it was too soupy but he still loved the flavor.  Each time I reduced the mayo by one tablespoon and for my hubby two tablespoons was the perfect amount.  I served it on thin slices of cucumber and he raved about it the entire time.  Even though I changed the recipe I gave this five stars because regardless of how much mayo was used the flavor was fantastic!  The only other problem was this "so-called" four servings...my hubby ate it all himself in ten minutes.  lol

I LOVE this recipe. My fiance and I make it often. The only thing I substituted is dill relish instead of sweet relish and I added about 1/4 teaspoon of mustard. Also we use fat free mayo.

The flavors in this salad are amazing! I loved the addition of curry. Definitely will make again. I did add some celery and scallions with a little bit of mustard, but that is my preference.  I wouldn't change the spices at all. This makes an awesome tuna melt!

I truly enjoyed this tuna! Typically I only enjoy sweet tuna, however, this was great. I did make a few changes, such as adding crushed red pepper, red onions, and celery. I also didn't have dill weed, but the tuna still turned out great. Thanks for posting!

MUCH too much mayo, as I doubled the recipe and still barely used half of what was recommended, but otherwise, a great blend of flavors!!  Added frozen peas for color/texture, and had a scoop on top of my spinach salad today for lunch... Mmmmmmmm!!

Just tweak the ingredient measurments to suit your taste, I always use 3 cans of 5oz StarKist Albaore Tuna drained, 4 T mayo, 2 T Parm Cheese, 2 T sweet pickle relish, 4 green onions sliced, 1/2 t curry powder, 2 T parsley, 2 t dill weed, a pinch of garlic powder and 3 boiled eggs chopped.....perfect everytime!

Execellent tuna salad, every now and then I'll dice up an apple to add along with some celery and raisins. Outstanding.

This is a great additional keeper on my file. The only change that I made based on the reviews I read was I used 4 tablespoon mayonnaise instead of 6, 2 tablespoon sweet pickle relish. I also used 1 tablespoon diced onion instead of using onion flakes since I do not have one. Half the dried parsley and I did not include the dill weed since I do not have one in my cupboard. The taste was so wonderful that my family loved it so much. Cheers Tanaquil for a wonderful tuna salad!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I added celery and boiled eggs which only made it better.  It has a slight after taste and I cannot pinpoint exactly which ingredient causes this, but overall it is extremely tasty.

Used 184 gram tin tuna.  Only used 3 tbsp mayo, that was plenty and less calories.

Absolutely the very best tuna salad I've ever tasted! Reminds me a bit of a wonderful fresh tuna "spread" that we used to get when we vacationed in Seagrove Beach, Florida. The deli has since closed and I never thought I would find anything close to that delicious spread. I've found it! Thank you so much!!!

Awesome, awesome change from the regular 'ole tuna salad. I used albacore tuna, cut back on the mayo (I prefer a stiffer salad; I used about 3 tablespoons), used a little under 1/8 teaspoon of onion powder in place of the onion flakes (I was too hungry to mince a fresh onion ;)), and left out the dill weed (didn't have any on hand). Served atop toasted whole wheat bread, it made an awesome lunch. Thank you for sharing!

My daughter loves tuna salad and said this was pretty good just needed some mustard in it! I did leave out the dill and curry because I didn't have any on hand! She still liked it so it's a keeper!

I omitted the sweet pickle relish because I was looking for something a little more savory, cut back the mayo and used an herb blend with shallots, tarragon, bay leaf, basil and dill since I didn't have just dill or onion... but it turned out fantastic! I was so surprised. The curry adds a depth of flavor I never thought I'd find in tuna salad and the parmesan is a nice touch- adds little salt, brings it all together...  What a great idea.

This tuna salad is absolutely delish!  I only tweaked it just a tad to fit my taste and really is super as is.  I found that I needed 2 cans of tuna, 3-4 tblsp of mayo, left out the parsley and upped the curry (because I soooo love curry).  Thank you Barbie for bringing tuna salad back into my menu!

Excellent sandwich! I put lettuce and thinly sliced mozza on top. Great ingredients, make a great taste! These ingredients really work together well and the total flavor is perfect! Nothing is over powering in this mix. Thank you for sharing this with the class!

I just made this the night before Hurricane Irene is set to strike to get rid of some mayo in my fridge. Delicious! I doubled the tuna, cut out the parsley and pickle relish (because I didn't have them). The curry is what makes it, though - what a great twist.

GREAT TUNA SALAD! wonderful balance of flavors and a great lunch. As with making tuna salad, you don't really need to measure everything just eyeball it. I added a little extra curry, fresh diced onion, and a pinch of s&p. Wonderful recipe!

YUM, I used 12oz can albacore tuna, lots of miracle whip to make it creamy and all ingredients listed to taste, using lots of curry, less parm & relish.  I really like it, make sure you blend everything well and it is better chilled- giving the tastes time to meld together.

Made this for lunch today, but used 1 can white and 1 can light tuna. Lowered the mayo content to 5 Tbsp, 2 Tbsp Parm, 2 Tbsp Relish - kept seasoning amounts the same for double amount of tuna. Served on a lettuce leaf with tomato and made a wrap of it. Flavorful version of tuna and lighter up a bit. Serves more like 3.

I was looking for something different and this was it. I left out curry as I didn't have any in the house but, also used Pampered Chef's Garlic and Dill seasoning with Pampered Chef's Onion Onion. Have to admit this was the best I have had in a long time.

This was SOOOO good! I was skeptical at first, as I am a novice in the kitchen, but my husband raved about it, and then I dared to taste it and was very pleased.  I doubled the tuna and used half the light mayo with half plain yogurt, and added some pickles (which I thought might be excessive, but was just right). I also cut back on the relish just a tad.  YUMMY!

Simple to make and delicious in a sandwich with a side of chips.  I added celery and green pepers to the recipe . . . I love the crunch!

This is by far the most flavorful tuna salad I have ever made. I only had a 5oz can of tuna so I tried to scale back the rest of the ingredients. I used only 2 TBSP of mayo to save a few calories, omitted the dill weed because I didn't have any, and I added a hard boiled egg. This was delicious and I will definitely make again. I may even try this with chicken.

Served w/ Triscuits.  Great spin on tuna salad.  I had issues with it being too wet and I think I tossed in a bit too much curry for my liking.

AMAZING recipe! The curry and seasonings I never would've thought to put in tuna salad, but it's amazing and easy. I've made this at least 5 times already (I use half the mayo and add more curry for personal taste) . Great to double/triple the batch and use for lunches, snacks, picnics - gains flavor after refrigerating. Love it on Bibb lettuce wraps and on toasted wheat rounds, crackers. Delicious!!

We had this for dinner last night.  It was the best tuna salad ever.  I  also cut down on the mayo.  I was hesitant with the mix of ingredients, but this was outstanding!!  We had it with a tomatoe & cucumber salad.  Great summer meal.  Will definitely be out new tuna salad!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Oh, so good!  What a unique recipe for tuna salad!  Loved the curry flavor and it went so well with the sweet pickle relish.  Never would have expected that!  I used fresh diced onion and a little less mayo, but those were the only changes I made.  Next time I will cut back just a bit on the curry powder.  The brand I have now is pretty powerful.  Thanks Barbie!

This tuna salad recipe was a WINNER!  A refreshing change in flavor from the boring, blah I have come to expect from other tuna recipes.  I admittedly did make a few minor changes/additions to this recipe.  (Sorry, I know that can be annoying!)  I added a minced carrot, chopped half of a medium sized onion, and chopped two stalks of celery.  I also gave the salad a squirt of yellow mustard and a few shakes of black pepper.  It was PERFECT!  I can't imagine anything better than this salad on lightly toasted whole grain bread, nestled in a bed of spinach and roma tomatoes!!!  YUMMY!

Do you like tuna with your mayo?  haha. Needs to cut that in half at least.  I did the recipe as stated and added a bit of Dijon to sharpen the flavor.  I also doubled the curry but I don't think it would be necessary with less mayo.

I made this almost exactly, but I don't know where you get a 7 oz can of tuna. I ended up using two 5 oz cans (maybe its a regional thing?). I only used 4 TB of light mayo and 2 TB of relish. I pretty much followed the rest though. My weight-lifting husband at the entire bowl in 1 sitting & raved about it. Loved the protein factor and the flavor. Very good recipe!

Loved this because it's so different than what I'm used to.  Yes, it's a little runnier than the normal tuna salad, but I think that is because of the sweet relish.  It's versatile recipe though.  My husband put a scoop on a sandwich, I put scoop on a bed of spinach, and tomorrow we are going to mix it in with cooked pasta.  One cook mix it in with rice.  Yummy.

This tuna salad is great.  However, I substitute plain yogurt for the mayo for added protein and less fat.  Its equally creamy and delicious.  Also, to give it a flavor kick, I added some small raisins.  The sweet really complements the curry spice.

The mix of relish and mustard with the tuna had an odd taste. I added more curry powder as well between 1/2 teaspoon and 3/4 teaspoon. I reduce the dill to 1/2 a teaspoon and added more garlic powder. I saute some onion as I did not have dried onion flakes on hand.I did this recipe without the relish with my previous modification and it was way better.

I wanted to love it because it sounded so good and had so many great reviews.  The combination actually wasn't as good as it sounded.  I had to add another can of tune to"tone down" the flavors. My husband didn't care for it either and he is NOT fussy about food!  Oh well, I always appreciate trying new ideas.  Glad so many people enjoy it!  :-)

Really tasty! The first time I made it exactly as the recipe instructed, and it was delicious! The second time I didn't have any mayo in the house so I substituted Caesar salad dressing. It was still good, but better with the mayo.

Super!  I have long made chicken salad with curry powder, but for some reason, it never occurred to me to try the same thing with tuna!  Wonderful!  A great spin on a pedestrian sandwich filling.    I omitted the parmesan, because I prefer to sprinkle cheese on my tuna salad rather than have it incorporated, and I omitted the relish, because I'm not a fan of sweet pickle anything. Rather than dried onion flakes, I finely minced about a quarter of a red onion, and used that.  I'm sure I probably used much more curry powder than the recipe calls for, because I tend to do that.   I think slivered almonds would be a great addition to this recipe, and when I do basically the same thing with chicken salad, I also add golden raisins, although I'm not sure I'd dig that with tuna.  Celery, too!

I loved this!!! Beware: It's very different from standard tuna and mayo! It almost has a sweet taste to it. I'm not a huge fan of tuna but thought this sounded different enough to try and it's my favorite tuna by far!! I will definitely make this again.

I think this is very good, but I'm not sure if it's better than my usual.  It was nice for a change, though.  I added chopped celery and used fresh minced onion instead of dried for texture.  I found the amount of mayo to be perfect (maybe others aren't draining the tuna as much?).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this tuna salad. I've always used salad dressing and sweet green relish, so this recipe takes tuna to a new level for me. The dill is sublime! Use the full amount of mayo. Change nothing.
UPDATE: I had a taste for this Tuna Salad but also craved pasta salad. So, I boiled 8 oz of bow tie pasta. Added 1/2 cup of frozen peas to the pasta water near the end of cooking. Then I combined all the ingredients for Barbie's Tuna Salad except the tuna. I tossed the tuna with the pasta and about three sliced green onions, then added the dressing, with about an additional 1/2 cup of Miracle Whip to moisten it up.  This recipe makes a great pasta salad!

I loved the use of curry powder, but 6 tablespoons of mayonnaise was way too much for me- I like to be able to taste the tuna in a tuna salad, and this one was drowning in the mayo. But it was great after I added an extra can of tuna- the other seasonings were yummy and seemed well-balanced, but I'll cut the mayonnaise at least in half next time.

Wonderful recipe.  We used a 12 oz. can of tuna and still cut back on the mayo.  We only used 5 tablespoons.  The rest of the ingredient amounts we kept the same.  It is delicious. It was perfect to pack for lunch.

I thought tuna salad is tuna salad but was I wrong! This is sooo good. But I would cut down on the dill weed because it becomes stronger as it sits in the tuna salad. Husband loved it too which is surprising!

This is sensational! It seemed like a strange cobination, but WOW was it good. I used dill relish, as that was what I had on hand, and used onion powder (half a teaspoon). But those were the only variances.

AWESOME! This one's now in my personal recipe collection. I used my own homemade mayo, used all organic ingredients, and left out the dill as I'm not a big fan... My husband said, "This is really good. What's giving it the kick?" Of course, that was the curry powder. I served his tuna salad on a sandwich and ate mine with Pita crackers. I highly recommend this and can't wait to try it on my friends! Good Job!

I have to say that for me the tuna salad was to "wet"..I perfer less mayo in mine.  All in all it was a good recipe.  I do like the cheese, curry and dill.  Next time I will reduce the mayo.  Thanks for a good recipe

Yummy.  Served it on various crackers.  Subbed dill relish for sweet, as that's what we use around here.  The curry was a nice touch.  Next time I'll add just a bit more.

I used two 5 oz. cans of tuna but used the amount of spices listed.  3 T. of mayo was enough for me.  Since I was fixing this for lunch, I didn't take the time to chill it so all the flavors could mingle.  I did have some leftovers tho, so I am looking forward to seeing how different it tastes.

When I made this I thought it was strange, but what was strange was that I kept going back and eating it, its utterly addicting, only use a max of 2 tbls of mayo, doesnt need 6. I have had 4 cans of tuna in the last 2 days!  YUMMMMMY

Great recipe.  Curry is a very interesting flavor in it.  I was out of parsley, but it was fine without it.  I did add some celery because I like the crunch it gives.

Very tasty! It was quick and easy and I had everything right on hand. I was just making it for myself and had one of those 3 oz. foil envelopes of tuna so I kinda halved everything. I only used about 2 T. of Mayo and 1 T of pickle relish but everything else I just cut in half and it was great plain or with some Wheat Thins. I will definitely make this again.

I love, love, love this tuna salad. It's so easy to make, and you really don't even have to measure if you don't want to. I just throw in a few shakes of this and a few dashes of that, and it still turns out great. HINT: I rarely have relish on hand, so I just chop up some dill pickles and add a little sugar. This is great on crackers!

I made this exactly as written and served it on toasted croissants with cheese.  I was very happy with the amount of mayo and dill.  The dill really makes the sandwich.  My husband and I were still talking about how delish dinner was a few hours later.  That's longer than I ever thought I'd talk about tuna salad in my life.  I had leftovers for lunch today, and it is even better with all the flavors mingled.  We will keep this on hand in our fridge for lunches and snacks.  I can see how it would be great with crackers.  Very easy and satisfying as well, and a simple source of healthy protein during the day.

This is a great recipe. it was not too wet AT ALL. I think the confusion is a can of tuna is 5oz, not 7oz.   I used 2 cans (10 oz) and kept all the current measurments, but added another tablespoon or two of mayo.  This recipe is very adaptable too - it would work well if you wanted to add celery, eggs, or anything else you like.

This tuna salad is so easy and packed full of flavor!  This has got to be one of my favorite ways to make tuna salad now.  The only change is instead of onion flakes, I mince up fresh onion to put in mine.  This recipe makes enough for two small sandwiches or one big sandwich.  I definitely would make at least triple this recipe, because it will all be eatin up in no time!

I wasn't too sure about this recipes, so I was truly going by the ratings.  My only change was to omit the parmesan cheese.  The flavors blend perfectly, and it's really a "must taste to appreciate" recipe.  It's the only recipe I go to when making a tuna sandwich.

I'm not a huge fan of tunafish, but this recipe sounded refreshing, so I tried it.  My girlfriend was over and only wanted a half of a sandwich, until she tasted it...then She licked the bowl clean!!!  Put a slice of provole and a garden fresh slice of tomato with it.  It was great.

This is the best tuna salad I've ever had! I used a little extra curry powder and fresh dill from my garden. I also used onion powder instead of flakes. I'm not a fan of pickle relish so I omitted it. I served it on a sesame seed bagel with a big slice of tomato and it was great! The best lunch I've had in a long time!

Attention to the people who say this is too wet- look at the size of your can of tuna! This calls for a 7 ounce can, the standard can size is 5 ounces.  I doubled the recipe and used 3 5 ounce cans and mine came out great. Make sure you drain it, and if you have a kitty I'm sure they would appreciate you giving them the juice. :) I also added minced celery and 2 hard boiled eggs, chopped just because that's how I like my tuna. The flavor of this is great- I measured everything and the addition of curry was awesome.  Thanks for sharing!

I have found my new way to eat tuna! This was AWESOME!!!! I can't stop eating it and I made it for lunch tomorrow. LOL! The curry and dill really set this tuna salad apart from others I have tried. Thanks ever so much for sharing this recipe.

I wish I had read the previous reviews, because this had way too much mayo. (Something I realized as I was putting it into the bowl.) That being said, the flavor is really good. I only used about a tbls of relish, and I left out the dill weed because I didn't have any. Next time I would use less mayo, same amount of pickle relish, and add diced celery for a little crunch. Love the curry!

It is a little unfair to rate a recipe when you didnt follow it - but.....here goes - I didnt change much.  I used mayo not m.w. I didnt use the dried onion flakes - I used red onion (about 1/4 cup) I didnt have sweet pickle relish so I used dill pickle relish - lastly I doulbled this so when I made it I cut back on the mayo by about 1/4.  This was a hit! I made sandwhiches for my husband and I also put some on some Ritz for him and he really enjoyed it. I am doing the lo carb thing right now so I just ate it straight up - Really Really good and I will make again

This is definitely our new tuna salad recipe, without changing ANYTHING! It's the BEST on toasted bread for sandwiches. I have shared it with several others that said the same thing. It works well with leftover (plain) baked salmon too. An absolute keeper - thank you so much!

Ok..I didn't quite have all the ingredients on hand, but I was craving tuna salad w/ a twist. So I made this w/ everything but the curry and onion flakes. I ran out of relish, so I took the sweet pickles I had a chopped them up. I also cut the mayo down to 4 Tbsp since I'm trying to watch my weight and used light mayo. And cut the cheese down a bit too....it's still wonderful. I'm sorry I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but I'll be sure to get them this weekend and try it again. Thanks for the great recipe...even though I couldn't follow it completely!

I absolutely LOVED the sound of the ingredients in this recipe all thrown together, but I had to make a few modifications to it considering I didn't have everything it asked for. First, instead of 6 tablespoons of mayo I used 5 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon of ranch dressing. Second, I added a little bit more dried onion than called for, but not much more. Third, I didn't have curry powder or dill weed, so I added the parsley and then garlic salt instead of garlic powder. It was SO GOOD. I will definitely keep this one in my trusty recipe box.

AWESOME!  The only thing I changed was to use 2 tsp dried minced onion flakes (I love onion!).  Everything else I followed to the letter.  Thanks Tanaquil!

UPDATE!  After 10 years of making this on a regular basis, it's still the best recipe for tuna salad I've ever tasted!

Although I used about half of the mayonnaise and no dill (we don't like it), my husband refers to this as "his" tuna salad and not Barbie's.  He requests this for lunch and can't seem to figure out what is in it, but doesn't care because it is his favorite.  Great recipe!  Try it once and you'll keep on eating it!

This tuna salad made a really awesome sandwich. I altered this recipe slightly, but it still turned out fantastic. 1) I felt really guilty about all the mayo that went into this recipe, so I used 3 Tbsp of light mayo and 3 Tbsp of honey mustard dressing. 2) I subbed one green onion, finely chopped, for the onion flakes. 3) I omitted the sweet pickle or dill weed because I didn't have this on hand. I'd definitely make this again.

OMG this recipe is to die for. Awesome!!!
The only thing i did different was used dill relish instead of sweet relish, just because I don`t care for sweet relish.
I will make this often, thank you for a great Tuna salad recipe!!!!!!! 10 stars from me.

Excellent, I would never have thought of putting parmesean cheese in tuna salad.  The combination of spices is random but perfect. I love curry so that makes it even better.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is the best tuna salad I have ever had. I have made it 3 times this week. The only change I made was using dill relish in place of sweet.

I made this today and had it on a sandwich with a little bit of lettuce. It was sooooo good. The added spices give it just the touch it needs to make a boring lunch exciting.

Great mix of flavors, oddly addictive! I had a sandwich for lunch and HAD to have another for dinner! Go with the writer of the recipe and just 'eyeball' the salad dressing. Sounded like a strange mix to me, tried it not expecting much, but LOVE IT!

I don't care too much for tuna, but decided to give this a try after reading the reviews.  I'm glad I did because it was the best tuna salad I've ever had.  I only used 2 T. of relish, 1/2 t. of parsley, and substiuted minced red onion for the onion powder.  I will definitly make this again, but next time I will add a little more cheese.

Oh my gosh... this is sooo good! I followed the recipe except for (I did not have the dill so left it out) and (Used onion powder because I was out of onion flakes.) Everyone should at least try this. I did not think I would like it better than my usual tuna-boiled egg-mayo-sweet pickle, but I do. I don't even miss the egg.

I made this today for lunch and I really enjoyed it. My can of tuna was only 6 oz., so I did cut back a little on everything else. I didn't really measure. I just guessed. I, also, left out the onion because I didn't have any. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. I usually make plain tuna with mayo but decided to search for a recipe. It was soo good. I didn't have any parsley, dill or relish ( I used pickles instead and added some sugar) and forgot to add the garlic powder and it was still really good. I'm going to go to the store to get those ingredients to I can make this recipe again, the real way!

This is a great recipe. To make recipe healthier I used soy mayonaise called Nayonaise. I also used only 1/2 teaspoon of dill.

I just made this salad and it's pretty good.  I made some changes for personal preference...I added some celery and a couple of hard boiled eggs.  I used a small onion instead of the onion flakes.  I used less mayo (although still a bit too much) and used 1/2 tsp of the ingredients instead of a full tsp.  Overall it turned out pretty good.  Next time I'll use even less miracle whip for a bit drier taste.  I think my husband is going to love it!

My husband loved it but I did not like it, I taste my food as I go along, mixing the ingredients together I added the Parmesan cheese last, before I added the Parmesan cheese I thought it tasted quiet good. I think next time I'll make the same recipe only make them tuna sandwich melts so the Parmesan will blend in better and place 1 slice of American cheese or some other cheese of choice to be melted on top of tuna salad. I think I’ll like it much better next time.

This is some really good tuna salad... I usually just eat tuna with a little mayo & nothing more but needed a receipe for a lunch I was attending.  Not only did my hubby & I love this when I made it the night before, it disappeared quick at my lunch and now everyone wants the receipe!  So happy I came across this one.  I'll be using it often.  I did cut back on the mayo & I used fresh onion but other than that kept the receipe the same.  It was perfect!

Delish!  I omitted the relish since I didn't have any, used fresh onion (about 1/4 cup) and halved the mayo.  I thought the ingrediants sounded strange together (dill and curry?) but it tasted very nice.  Will make again, next time with relish.

This tuna was really delicious.  It is very different from what I am used to.  This is tuna with a kick.  I suggest using this recipe for entertaining or whenever you want to make a good impression.  Although the flavors were a bit too strong for my husband, I will still make it again.  I suggest using real onions instead of minced onion flakes, which could be mistaken for egg shells while eating.  Next time, I will start with a bed of romaine lettuce, then add tri colored pasta noodles, add this tuna, shredded parmesan, and probably Olive Garden's salad dressing.  I can not wait!  I think this will be a fantastic pasta/tuna salad.  FYI-I used more tuna and less mayo than the recipe calls for...personal preference.

This is a repeat of my review for New Wife Tuna Salad, also on this site, because I mixed the two recipes: Don't you just hate it when people change the whole recipe and then rate it, I do...but here I am doing it, sorry...I basically combined New Wife Tuna Salad, on this site, and Barbie's Tuna Salad. I used: 5 hard-boiled eggs diced * 7 (6 oz) cans tuna, drained * 1 stalk celery, chopped * 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion * 1/2 cup mayo * 1 TBLS honey mustard * 1/2 tsp black pepper * 1/2 tsp seasoned salt *  3 TBS Parmesan cheese, 1 TBLS dried parsley, 1 tsp dried dill weed and a pinch, or sprinkle, of garlic powder * omitted sweet pickle relish, dried minced onion flakes and curry powder. This was great as an open face sandwich topped with cheese and broiled in the oven just enough to melt cheese. Thanks to both TANAQUIL and JMOR777, author of  New Wife Tuna Salad...

Yummy!  These ingredients give tuna a unique and delicious taste!  I doubled the recipe, and the only changes I made were to cut down on the mayo (as others suggested--you can always add more if you wish) and I only used two tablespoons of the sweet relish, as I normally do not like sweet relish in my tuna.  The combination of ingredients is fabulous.  Thanks!!!

First, let me say that I rarely give 5 stars as that is "Thank God for this!" food.  That said, this is a 4+ star with the caveat that you MUST let it sit overnight in the fridge.  I made a double batch and the first sandwiches were a 3.5-4 but the next day definately increased the flavor 1 full star.

Based on the original recipe's portions, I decreased the mayo to 4 tablespoons to match my preference for creaminess and used paprika instead of curry (out of it).

Next time I might add a little celery to give it a little crunch.  Otherwise, this is a very good recipe.  Thanks!

This was good, but I don't think I'd make it again. Maybe it was my curry powder, but the taste was just a little weird for me.

I wasn't sure whether to give this 4 stars or 5.  It was very hard to get people to try this because of the color and consistancy, but once they got a taste it turned out to be quite "addictive"; they kept coming back for more.

OUTSTANDING!! This tuna salad was great. I was skeptical because of the combination of ingredients but I am so glad I tried it. The flavors all marry so well together I hate relish but loved the sweetness it added. I will make this tuna all the time now. Who would of thought such a strange combination would make something that tastes so wonderful.

Who would've ever thought that tuna could be almost "refreshing"!  My husband and I loved it and the only thing I changed was the amount of relish.  I used only 1 tablespoon as I am not that wild about sweet relish, and I thought it was just right.  This is most definitely my new tuna recipe.  Thanks!

Very good, easy recipe. I did a couple of mods - real onions instead of dried, and the addition of celery and chopped boiled egg. The dill seemed waaaay overpowering at first, but after sitting in the fridge a few hours, it mellowed out into an AMAZING dish. My husband and I gobbled it up that evening, and I had made a double batch!

A refreshing change from the same old tuna salad. I had my doubts about the relish and the dill (I am not a big pickle fan) but they weren't overpowering and added just the right zip and flavor.

I spotted this in the latest reviews a couple of days ago. I'm not a big tuna salad fan but thought I'd give this a try. So glad I did. I left out the dill (don't like the aftertaste) but used everything else. Took it to work for lunch in a roll and added some lettuce. Great. Was planning to take it again tomorrow but my husband walked in to the room earlier with a plate of sandwiches saying this tuna's really good what did you do differently. Grrrr nothing's sacred is it lol. Obviously a hit. Many thanks.

FABULOUS!  I was skeptical about the sweet relish but it was a perfect balance to the seasonings.  I used 4-5 tbls of mayo and it seemed the right amount of moisture.  I plan on serving this at a ladies' luncheon next month.

I literally could not stop eating this.  I substituted mt. olive splenda sweetened bread and butter pickles for the relish since i'm lowcarbing.  I added a little more than a pinch of garlic too.  WONDERFUL!

This was so yummy.. I'm making it again except I would go with the others and not put so much mayo. I also put some pepper in it and use more of the recommeded spice doses. I don't have parme cheese so we're going to have to do without it. But I love this recipe it's taste is great and it's fast..

I’ve been using this recipe for years but am just now getting around to reviewing it.  It is the perfect combination of flavors and you will NOT be disappointed!  Because it is so highly requested at my house, I double (or triple) the amount of tuna, spices, sweet relish and Parmesan - but always start with the 6 TBL of mayo and only add more as needed after it has sat in the fridge for a bit (Depending on the type of tuna you use and even if you drain the relish, there is usually still enough liquid in the mixture to keep it moist after the spices & Parmesan have been absorbed).  That is the ONLY change I’ve made to the original recipe after all these years and everyone keeps asking for more!  On a side note - Try using fresh shredded Parmesan when you have it instead of the standard “shaker” stuff we normally depend on

Not just another tuna salad...it's subtle, poignant , surprising and, in the end, truly memorable, destined to be memorialized as the best tuna salad ever !!!
I've been using it for over ten years...no need to fool yourself thinking that by add anything, or by substituting anything,  you'll make it better...it's not going to happen,

Wow... this was really good. Glad I read reviews and tried this. The only modifications I made were to my preferences. I added 1 cup chopped celery (crunch), cut mayo to 3 tbsp, cut parsley to 1 teaspoon, used dill relish instead of sweet and added more garlic and onion powder. Delicious!  I follow a ketogenic diet so I used avocado mayo and this recipe worked out great!

This wasn't phenomenal, but it was better than our standard tuna salad.  I was afraid it would taste strongly of curry, but I wouldn't have even known it was there if I hadn't made it or seen the recipe. My husband described the flavors as "delicate"--something extra but not overpowering. I do have to admit I didn't have dill weed, so I reduced the mayo and added a little dill pickle juice. I also thought it seemed like too much parsley, so I reduced that by almost half, though I think it actually would have been fine with more than I put in. Edit: I made this again with the full amount of parsley, and I've determined it was better when I reduced it.

This is my go-to protein salad recipe. I often swap out chicken for the tuna and it's just as good. You can do so much with this recipe. The key is to always use the relish and curry. Everything else is up for grabs. I have even subbed fat free greek yogurt for half the mayo with great results. Another twist is to smash an avocado with it. This opportunities are endless!

My family loved it. Thank you for submitting a recipe for a classic with a little extra zip.  As for some of the other reviews... COME ON! Its one thing to suggest one or two little additional things you added or took away to make it your own, but those of you who write books about what you changed to make it better basically rewriting a whole other recipe should quit hating and just submit your spectacular version on here to be tested by thousands. Just show gratitude that you found a recipe that inspired you to make of it what you did and say Thanks  It's called community and that is what this site is about. Community of home cooks coming together and sharing and swapping recipes. If your stuff is so brilliant why arent you sharing your brilliance with the rest of us

I knew this recipe sounded "different" but I thought that since a caterer served it in their catering business that it must be a good recipe! I just so happened to have all the ingredients on hand (and was glad I did). I made it per recipe and the curry  powder and parmesan both did lend a unique (but good flavor) to the tuna! It seemed like the combination of these ingredients really complimented each other, without being overwhelming and I was surprised by that fact!The spices melded very well together ~ I will definitely make this recipe again and I would give it a thumbs up! I made this and had some of this tuna salad on some potato bread,and it was tasty! ~I think  it would also be really good served as an hor d'oeuvre (with crackers or on melba toast) or on a bed of lettuce as a nice light lunch!~ Thanks for the Share on this splendid recipe!

This is such an excellent recipe! My husband and I don't even like curry and I, before this, did not care for tuna, but wow! I do use a little extra parmesan, and also use about 1 TBSP or more of fresh minced onion as we LOVE onion. I also add some cracked black pepper as we like spice, and I really loved the addition of the pepper. The consistency, in my opinion, is just right! I have not made it with the full 1 TSP of dill weed as I was a bit scared because of other reviews so I used 3/4 of a TSP and it was still wonderful! Also, just for reference, we don't care for sweet relish so I used dill relish. I have not found a 7 oz can of tuna but I used a 5 oz package of Albacore and it is still perfect. I just made this a few days ago and my husband asked me to make it again tonight for his lunch tomorrow! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe ((=

It was really good but next time I think I'll add less curry. That's just my preference, really good otherwise.

I made this and served it open face on homemade tomato herb bread. (Bread recipe from almanac.com (The Old Farmer's Almanac)). I only made one change to the tuna recipe; instead of onion powder, I used some red onions that I already had cut up. My family said this was the best tuna sandwich they have ever had.

My name is Nicole Ashley Allen. When I tell you that this recipe is amazing...THIS RECIPE IS AMAZING! This was my first time making this tuna salad and my entire family loved it! I followed the recipe exactly how it is stated. However, once I was done, I tasted it and added a few things. I added a few tablespoons of chopped celery, a tablespoon of freshly chopped green onions and another pinch of curry powder. I will be making this tuna salad at least once every other week. Yup, it's that good!

The reviews are definitely accurate - this is the BEST tuna salad I've ever had. I've made this several times. Such an unusual mix of ingredients that all work so well together. Yum!

This is a great-tasting tuna salad, but it is very, very wet  using the given recipe. Since I prefer drier salads, I changed the proportions as follows: 4 tbsp mayo (down from 6), 2 tbsp Parmesan (up from 1), 2 tbsp relish (down from 3), 10 oz white albacore tuna (instead of 7 - this is also easier to buy at my grocery store since it is generally sold in 5 oz cans). It turned out great, and I will absolutely make it again.

Wow! I was so surprised that it didn't have fresh ingredients, really, but was happy since I made it on the fly. I used a 12 oz. fresh tuna steak which I seared first. I added heaping amounts of most of the spices (including accidentally quadrupling the onion flakes), and it was so delicious. Next time, some fresh onion and celery and maybe a bit of cayenne. Yum!!!!!!!

I made this recipe for a potluck at work and after I mixed it all up I tasted it and it tasted horrible!  But I put it in my fridge and let it sit overnight and went ahead and took it in to work, and it tasted 100% better the next day after the flavors melded together.  I think to those that made it and didn't like it, they might have ate it like I did at first immediately after it was made. Try it again, and let it sit a few hours and see if you like it better, I certainly did and would make it again!

It was good made it exactly as written. Something different. It's taste was more of a sweet pickle relish tuna taste with subtle hint of curry. Used it to make sandwiches, i think next time I'll cut down on relish & curry.

Who knew tuna salad could be this exciting. It's a great base that you can easily tweak to superstar status by adjusting to your taste. My rockstar tweaks: fresh herbs/onion, a good squeeze of lemon, toasted almonds, & pepper flakes. AMAZING!

I don't care for tuna salad with a lot of mayo. I would never add 6 tblsp of it to one can of tuna. When it comes to amounts of ingredients in recipes, to me it's common sense to use amounts that work for you and your own taste and preferences. Otherwise you ended up tossing and wasting, and that's not good. I only added about a tblsp of mayo, and it still came together nicely and was not dry (less calories, too!). I also added only 1 tblsp of relish, more garlic powder and a bit of salt and pepper. The spices did combine for nice flavor.

Who would have thought tuna salad could have so many levels of flavor?! Not too wet, not too heavy. No spice overpowers another. Won't be making your run-of-the-mill tuna salad anymore! Not to mention, my son gobbled it right up too :)

After reading the reviews I made the following changeS to a double batch.

1. Halved the amount of dill and relish. 
2. Creamed the yolks of two hardboiled eggs into the mayo.
3. Added two ribs of celery diced and the whites of two gard boiled eggs.
4. Added mayo based on texture of salad.

It came out really good. We tasted it before the addition of egg and celery and it had good flavor. The egg yolks help smooth out the flavor a bit and the whites and celery give a nice range of texture without changing the flavor too much.

I don't know what all these rave reviews are about! I followed the recipe to a T and it was pretty bad. My curry-loving husband didn't like it either. And it didn't look ANYTHING like the main photo. I can't believe this was from a catering company. Sorry, but it was a big let-down.

Rating this as a "let's try again".  I accidentally messed up the recipe and put in a TABLESPOON of dill instead of a teaspoon, so it was hard to eat.  I think it was too heavy on the mayonnaise and I missed the crunch of celery, so next time I will be adding some in.

What a great recipe!  I love how the Dill and Curry blended together so well.  I used Bread and Butter pickles for their sweet and tangy taste.  I also put in one boiled egg and used fresh onions.  This is a keeper!  I gave some to my neighbor (whom is a Hugh Foodie) and she even said it was the best she ever had"

Mix all ingredients and add the mayo in last.  I always add more seasoning than called for.  I've made this twice and now I just eyeball what I want it to taste like.  It's sweet from the relish, and the curry adds a nice punch.  I really like this Tuna Salad!

I followed the recipe exactly and it's fantastic!  To those who are saying its soupy, has too much mayo, etc., the recipe calls for white tuna.  It's much firmer and drier than "chunk light" tuna.  Please try it again using the correct tuna and you'll have much better luck!!

Wanted something different today for lunch. I used 2 5oz cans of tuna & prepared it according to directions.  Added spices slowly, tasting as I went as I too was skeptical about the curry & the relish. Ended up using about, what the recipe called for. I'll definitely make this again. Great flavors. Thanks for sharing........

The addition of curry powder to tuna salad is surprisingly delightful!  I made a few modifications...  I used 3 5oz cans of tuna, added 1/2 tsp creole seasoning, a pinch of cayenne, 2 green onions and black olives.  I also ate it on celery sticks since I'm grain free.  I may try adding some tomato next time too.  The recipe was really good before my modifications, I just like my food a little spicier.

This recipe is very good as tuna salads go, and it may become a go-to recipe because it's a little different than others I've made. HOWEVER---BE AWARE OF YOUR CANNED TUNA VOLUME! This recipe calls for a 7 ounce can. I thought they used to come in 6 ounce cans, so I checked. ALL of my cans are 5 ounces (water packed), regardless of brand. I therefore had to reduce the rest of the ingredient amounts by almost a third, otherwise the spices would have been overwhelming. The only changes I made were to use chopped gherkins (that jar was open) instead of the relish, and I added a half stalk of very finely diced celery for some more crunch. It was good as I made it, and I imagine it will be even better when I make sandwiches with it in an hour.

I'm not a big fan of tuna. I think that's why I love this recipe. There really isn't a strong tuna taste.  I only had 5 oz cans of tuna on hand, so I added used 2 for this recipe.  That's the only thing different I did.  I put it on toast and it was delish!  Will make again.

I was looking for a different way to make tuna and came across this recipe. Holy smokes this is wonderful! I used less mayo (4t), fresh dill from the garden, a little extra parsley and loooooved it! Next time, I think I'll add fresh onions in lieu of the dry (and add more onions). My 6 year old loved it :) Thanks for a great recipe!

Try it! You will like it.  I didn't have sweet relish so I used dill.  It came out amazing.  I didn't miss the egg  I usually use at all.  You. Amy really taste the curry but it does not have the tuna taste.  This may be the best tuna salad I've ever had.  I used light mayo so that cut the calories.  I will make this again.  I think on top of little tomatoes for appetizers or crackers.

We LOVED this! I didn't use the relish because I don't like crunchy things in my salads, but otherwise even the kids said it was the best tuna salad they ever had. I am not even a huge tuna fan and loved it. I also used Albacore tuna which is a better quality/tasting tuna so that helped too. Will make many more times to come!

I have been making this recipe for years, it’s very good. If I want to make sandwiches out of the tunafish I add an extra can of tuna, and salt. If I want to use it as an appetizer on crackers, I follow these directions. It’s delish?

I HATE tuna, but being a type I diabetic, I needed a low fat, low calorie lunch.  This was DELICIOUS!  I used only 4 teaspoons of light mayo and added a teaspoon of mustard, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I served it on top of a mixed green salad with avocado and tomatos. This will go onto my weekly menu.

Wow - cannot believe how good this recipe was! I'm a (broke) law school student so I eat a LOT of cold sandwiches for lunch. I was sick of my old tuna recipe and figured I would give this one a shot. I love it and am NEVER going back to old, crappy, 3-ingredient tuna salad!

I did make one slight adjustment and used ginger instead of curry powder, really just because I didn't have any curry on hand at the moment. It still tasted delicious. Also, I know several people were worried about the mayo. Honestly, I'm kind of a mayonnaise-a-phobe; I like a teeny bit of it on sandwiches and I don't mind cooking with it but I don't really love the taste. Happily, I think the spices and other ingredients really worked well in this recipe because I didn't feel overhwelmed by mayo taste at all. Love it!

I had such high hopes for this recipe, as I love both curry and dill and already prefer to use sweet pickle relish for my traditional tuna salad. The addition of parmesan gave me pause, but I soldiered on with the reassurances of hundreds of rave reviews. Oh, how I wish I had trusted my intuition. The flavor is strange at best, with a bold smoky aftertaste that seems like some unholy union of the curry and parmesan. The only alteration I made was to cut back on the mayo for a consistency that seemed more palatable. In the end, however, I am not sure I can actually eat this, which is saying something! I've now added diced celery (which I never normally use in tuna salad) to attempt to add a fresher taste to the smokiness. I'm not sure anything will save it, though, and I likely will mourn the 2 cans of tuna I wasted trying this tonight.

GREAT recipe!  Not a fan of curry, but in this recipe all the flavors come together nicely!  Even my picky kids loved it!! Made just as listed and fabulous, but also made with real onions as I did not have onion flakes and either way was great!! I doubled and tripled recipe using 1 tablespoon less for each portion.

My finicky 8 year old with very sophisticated taste buds gave it a thumbs up and asked me what I put in it to make it so yummy.  The only modification I made was use fresh onion diced very small and fresh parsley and garlic.  I will make a scoop salad with the remainder for dinner tonight.

Loved the Curry and Parmesan flavor.  I used chopped onion instead
of minced flakes and finely chopped hard boiled egg. I doubled this
recipe but maybe next time I'll use a little less mayo. Husband liked
it...always a winner when my husband makes a point of saying something.

At first I did not like this recipe.  But after letting it sit in the fridge for a day, it actually got a lot better.  The only addition I made was 2 hard boiled eggs chopped up.  Be careful with the garlic powder, as well as the onion flakes.

I used diced fresh onion and diced baby gerkins (because I didn't have relish) and it turned out great on sandwiches.  My guy scarfed it up and said it was the best he's ever had.  "Definitely a keeper."

Great twist on traditional Tuna, I was skeptical at first about the curry because I don't normally care for it but it tastes wonderful with the other ingredients. I didn't have Dill on hand so I subbed Basil after searching online. Will definitely make again!

The curry & dill weed give this great flavor.  Next time will add diced sweet pickles instead of relish for more crunch.

Wonderful !! Tastes very middle eastern. For an even more exotic taste, add lemon juice squeezed from 1/2 lemon, 1/4 teaspoon saffron, table spoon finely chopped red onion, table spoon finely chopped celery, salt/pepper to taste. I skipped the dry minced onion and used ranch salad dressing instead of mayo, and used two 5oz cans of tuna fish.

I halved the mayo but otherwise followed the recipe. We scooped it onto leaf lettuce and it was excellent. Thank you!

I stumbled upon this recipe and it immediately piqued my interest. What a wonderful blend of herbs & spices. After sampling a few spoonfuls, I placed it in the refrigerator for a few hours to allow all of the flavors to meld. Wow! This is an all-star recipe.

This is the only tuna salad that the whole family will eat.  Just delicious.  I do add 2-3 egg whites for extra protein.  I love eating this with crackers.  I have no desire to search for another tuna salad recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this with trepidation.  I like to cook, but usually steer clear of recipes with too much tarting up.  This one has lots of additions but still features the tuna as the star.  It's delicious.  I made it just as it's written except no sweet relish.  Never touch the stuff. Minced some bread-and-butter pickles that were made with hot chiles.  Also upped the minced dried onion to a tablespoon (in a triple batch) because 1/8 of a teaspoon, even of a dried condiment, is not worth taking the jar down from the pantry.  And onions are always welcome and are often the backbone of tuna salad.  But I practiced restraint because I had a feeling about this recipe.  I made my own curry powder from a recipe by Alton Brown.  Curry powder was the only thing I did not have to complete the ingredient list for this recipe, and I'm glad I didn't and was forced to make my own (I did have all the ingredients for that).  I keep going to the little container of my newly made curry powder and sniffing.  It's aromatic and wonderful.  The tuna is truly great.  The tuna flavor is front and center, but the Parmesan and the pickles and all the great spices round it out and fill it out.  My husband just ate a mound of it inside half a Delicata squash, freshly picked and roasted.  Thank you for this recipe.

So tasty! I was hesitant to make this since the ingredients did not seem to go well together, but decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. So glad I did! I was making this a day ahead for lunch but could hardly stop eating it when I finished mixing. Savory and delicious! I made the recipe mostly as is, but added finely chopped fresh onion (didn't have minced). I didn't have garlic powder either so cut a clove in half and let sit in mayo for a few minutes then removed. It was delicious just like that, but the taste just called for capers so I added a few of those and loved it even more! As others have said, don't let the ingredients put you off. Give it a try! :-)

My new favorite tuna salad! I'm not a mayo fan, plus wanted to cut the fat down, so I followed other comments & added just enough Light Hellman's to get it moist - somewhere around a tablespoon. Wonderful!!

Really different and tasty. Not your usual mayo, tuna and celery salad. When I read the ingredients, I wasn't sure if I would like it but the flavors mesh together really well and make it taste "gourmet". I didn't even use bread or crackers with it. Ate it right out of the bowl. Delicate taste.

Sorry, I did everything just like it says to do and nobody liked it :( I give it two stars though because I never thought of flaking the tuna before! (duh) So that helps with using my own old recipe. Nobody said specifically what they didn't like, they just didn't like it.

Easy and very good. I didn't have any onion flakes or dill and only had a mixture of italian shredded cheese so I used that instead. It really was good without the onion flakes and dill. Will definitely make this again.

This was phenomenal. I liked it much more than expected. I made it according to the recipes except that I used half the relish.  I made sandwiches with it, using Panera honey wheat bread and tomato. So good! I made sandwich after sandwich. I don't keep recipes unless they are great, and this one is a keeper! Much better than boring old tuna salad (which I liked to begin with).

I am so happy I found this recipe. I've tried adding curry before but I just couldn't get the taste I was looking for. This is an interesting and wonderful mix of ingredients. I thought the dill/curry combo wouldn't work since they are both fairly strong, but I think all of the flavours mixed together made it well balanced. I adjusted the recipe to suit our tastes... less mayo (eyed it as I went along), no onion powder, and instead of sweet relish I added half of a delicious apple (diced)... and of course, fresh ground pepper. I used good bread and added some fresh spinach on top. YUM! It will be a staple in our house from now on.

Super yummy and easy! Don't be afraid of all the spices.  Somehow it all just works.  It was a tiny bit too sweet for my taste.  Next time I might try using dill relish instead of sweet.

Very nice on a hot summer day.  I too reduced the amount of mayo to 1 1/2 Tbsp. and used mayo flavoured with Olives.   I reduced the amount of onion flakes and relish.   I just love the taste that the curry imparts to this salad.  It's nice served with lettuce and pumpernickel bread and some smoked apple cheese on the side.

This recipe has ruined all other tuna salad recipes for me!  Just pay attention to the size of your can of tuna and adjust the mayo accordingly, because this calls for a 7oz can and all of my cans of tuna are 5oz.  I think 5oz of tuna would be drowning in 6 tablespoons of mayo!  Don't let the curry scare you away if you are not a curry person--it is very subtle.

This is very good. This was my first time using curry powder in anything and I loved it. I did use the larger can of tuna, also I used a lot less mayo more like 2 Tbls its just a personal preference. Also I had a cucumber in the fridge so I peeled and cubed it for some added crunch. I will definitely make this again. I think next time I will add celery and maybe cubed red pepper too. Also my mom suggested using canned chicken with these ingredients too I think it would be good.

O-M-G!!! i was skeptical putting curry, but it was so delish!!! i raved about it to all of my family members. this has become a top 5 to put into a sandwich. i put mine into a croissant. even my picky 5-yr old daughter devoured it! i didn't have dill weed or relish but thought it was still great as is! can't wait to try it with all the ingredients.

I am just now getting around to reviewing this recipe after having made it several times now.  It is my go-to recipe for tuna salad.  Most recently, I made tea sandwiches.  I also serve it on lettuce leaves and on sweet finger rolls.  This is a real winner.

Barbie you nailed it with this recipe. This is awesome! I don't like curry, so just left it out. My tuna hating friend now makes this and takes it for her lunch. LOL

Just made this and am eating it with crackers RIGHT NOW. Didn't follow the recipe exactly. I used what I had on hand. Changes were as follows:

1. I didn't use mayo but used half an avocado instead.
2. I omitted the sweet pickle relish.
3. Used fresh chopped onion instead of dried minced.

I will definitely make this again.

Tasty! I enjoy tuna salad with pickles and curry so this recipe is a keeper for me. I ended up making tuna melt sandwiches with this salad.

Wow. This was much better than I expected. It's nice to have a change from the usual tuna salad recipe.  The dried herbs worked just fine but I bet fresh parsley and dill would be fantastic.  I will definitely be making this one again.

I don't even like curry and this was wonderful!  I scaled the mayo down and will use even less the next time I make it.  I topped the tuna on a bed of spinach and mixed veffies and it was SO GOOD.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I came across this recipe a few years ago and make it often. The only changes I've made is to add a little extra curry and I swapped out regular mayo for the mayo made with olive oil as it's much healthier and lower in fat.  I always get rave reviews when I make this. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good! A added 3 Tbs diced celery, 3 Tbs defrosted frozen peas and used diced onion instead of flakes. I upped the curry powder slightly. The curry was a very nice surprise...Highly recommended.

This is the best tuna salad ever! I made a couple of changes just based upon what I had. I didn't use dill, I definitely did not use all that mayo.  2 tbsp is enough (thats why I can only give it 4 stars).  And I also used capers instead of the pickles.  Probably about 1/2 tsp worth since capers have a stronger taste. And sometimes I also use a diced boiled egg.  My husband LOVES IT.  I like to eat it on a bed of spinach for a healthier substitution for bread..needs no dressing.  Making it for my lunch right now :)

This was fabulous!! Since I used solid white tuna, I mixed the mayo and spices, then added the flaked tuna. I cannot imagine eating boring plain tuna salad again!

Ive mad this about 5x now for my husband. I'm not a fan of tuna salad- but he grew up eating it. Now I just eyeball all the ingredients. He asks me every week to make it. Haven't added anything. Perfect the way it is.

GREAT! This is an amazing recipe! It's amazing what a big difference sweet relish as opposed to dill relish makes. Much better with the sweet relish or half/half to cut out some of the sweetness.

Wonderful.  Has an almost savory quality to it.  Had to substitute some chopped onion which had been marinating in white vinegar and stevia, but only because we didn't have any relish or sweet pickles.  We all thought the relish would be a better choice, but either way, I personally love the seasonings in this recipe.  My family wondered why I did, since they liked the plainer fare they grew up on, but they just need a bit of nice bread and some swiss to 'clue in', I'm sure of it!  IMHO - --  this was great, just on crackers.  Wonderful stuff!  But, as another reviewer stated, if this is on fine bread, with lettuce, toms, and swiss, I'm sure the savory will carry extremely well (hot or cold, IMHO).  ---  will sub half yogurt and a touch of stevia for some of the mayo next time, though.  Thanks, Tanaquil!

Delicious!!! Used all fresh ingredients because I happened to have them on hand. I also added celery so the whole thing was slightly chunkier than the original recipe. Loved the curry and will be making again soon!

I used this to make tuna pasta salad and it was a big hit.  The only change I made was to double the mayo, and cut the parsley in half.  Was perfect with 2 C cooked macaroni noodles.

This was surprisingly wonderful!  I only had a 5oz can of tuna so I wanted to make sure that I measured everything exactly as written.  I tasted as I went to make sure that the flavors were something I enjoyed.  I was very nervous when I added the curry, but once it was all mixed together and on my sandwich roll it was divine.

Great taste, parmesan and curry are good ideas.

But 6tbs mayo? That's approaching 1000 fat calories... I suggest using olive oil based mayo and reducing the quantity a bit. (adjust mixture to taste)

I doubled the recipe for a church work day lunch -- VERY well received -- only 1 T left over.  I used 2 cans (5 oz) and 2 bags (2.5 oz) because that's what I had in my pantry -- it was perfect.  Great consistency (agree it had a bit of a green tinge, but it tasted really  terrific).  Everyone who tried it went back for seconds.

Only change was to use onion powder instead of flakes -- I had run out.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe...just made a couple changes to make it low carb as I eat tuna in my salad as apposed to a sandwich. So, I used dill pickle chopped up instead of the sweet pickle, didn't need 6 tbsp mayo, just used 3 1/2 and  added a few drops of hot sauce also found it needed a little salt and pepper. Even my daughter who does not like tuna loved it...another great sandwich idea for the kids' lunches. thank you!

I found this really salty as written.  I do like the concept though.  I will give this another go but next time I will use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder and less curry powder.  It also may have been saltier because I made the mixture the night before and it sat in the fridge all night.

Great recipe. I think it would have been too much mayo but I used about 10oz of tuna and the 6 tablespoons was good enough for that. I also added a chopped red bell pepper for some extra crunch and it was really delicious. And instead of the relish I chopped half a dill pickle. Also added a squirt of mustard. Took me 5min to make and I had a delicious lunch with leftovers for tomorrow. Great recipe thanks!!

Good stuff. I used a big 12oz can of tuna, and changed the servings to 6 and followed exactly. I make all my salads in one of these with the blade attachment and it always comes out perfect.

Barbie,Barbie, Barbie baby this is amazing. I did skip the cheese and dill but some chopped water chestnuts and I am ready for another. Some kettle malt vinegar chips and homemade bread and butter pickles and alls good. I will be doing this again. And I will be playing with the fish/curry combo more often.
I think some grilled tuna, steak with green curry will be in the works. Yum, cannot wait until the wife and kid tries it.

I have to confess that I am violating my own cardinal rule here by rating this recipe as I modified it, but the modifications were slight and essential.  In any case, 5 stars means it couldn't possibly be any better, so I think 4 stars is appropriate.

This was a very good recipe and we enjoy it a lot.  I used dill pickle relish, as I am diabetic and don't stock sweet pickle relish.  I had to make do with 2 5 ounce cans and adjusting ingredients accordingly, as tuna processors no longer use 6 or 7 ounce cans.  I also did not have any dried parsley, so I used the equivalent of fresh (3+ Tbsp.).    I used white tuna because I happened to have some, but prefer the taste of chunk light for salad.

I just don't think that you should have a tuna salad without celery.  On top of that, the sweet pickled relish made it too sweet.  It needed more salt and onion than in the recipe.
Ultimately, I needed to alter way to many things to give this recipe 5 stars.

I just made this for my husbands lunch and it is delicious. Im not a fan of sweet pickle relish but in this recipe it's wonderful. I especially like the curry, it adds a unique flavor but not to overpowering. Will absolutely make again! Yummy

5+ stars for this recipe. The sweet relish combined with the zesty curry have turned tuna fish from a boring lunch to a fantastic experience between bread. Thank you for sharing!

Interesting take on tuna salad.  I tripled the recipe for lunches this week. Curry was a little strong for me, so I will decrease it next time, perhaps even keep it at the 1/4 tsp if I make a triple batch again.  I did like the flavor profile it created though, just a bit too pronounced for me.  Adding Parmesan was a great addition.  Look forward to trying again.

Reduced the mayo to about 4 TBS.  I don't care for sweet relish so I simply chopped up a good-ol' dill pickle and added that.  The herb collection really works well with tuna, and all the green specks make it look pretty.  I'd like to try this with chicken!

Very GOOD! I added some chopped celery and hard boiled egg, no curry on hand so I added red pepper flake and all seasoning. We don't care for pickle relish so I omitted that and it was still great.

Great tasting! I alter the ingredients a little every time but for the most part i stick to it. Only thing i usually always change is the amount of mayo to about 4 tbsp.

Tried several tuna salad sandwich recipe throughout the years and this is the BEST so far. Even my mom loves it. Was reluctant at first to do (with curry powder? LOL) BUT i'm glad i did.  I reduced mayo (don't want it runny), reduced sweet pickles as well.  My have to increase the curry since it's really good.

This is the best tuna salad I have ever had. Even fans of regular tuna salad, who don't normally care for different flavors, have loved this. I think the dill and the parm are what make it so amazing. Next time I will add fresh dill, and more of it since it isn't as potent. For my taste I prefer much less mayonaise, though. Don't be afraid to try it:)

It was OK...recipe asked for way too much mayo, put half as much in and it was plenty. Used diced onion instead of the flakes.

I love this recipe.  I love how the curry and dill really bring this tuna salad alive.  I make as is and sometimes when I don't have all the ingredients it still turns out great.  I have used half mayo half ranch dressing and it was fine.  I also think that it tastes better the second day!!!

the best tuna salad I have ever made.  Hubby demands that we have at least once/week.  I have sub'd garlic salt for garlic powder and have also on occasion eliminated the dried onion (only because I didn't have items on hand) and it is still delicious.
Thanks so much for this recipe!

I was looking up tuna salads for lunch and found this as one of the top rated. The ingredients were non-traditional, but I wanted something different. After I started making it I realized it had dill, which I always find to be overwhelming, but I wanted to make the recipe as is. The flavor was really strong as I expected. The green of the parsley and the dill also made the tuna salad barely recognizeable, as tuna salad, with all of the green flecks. The other added spice I found out of place was the curry. It works in chicken salad, but just did not seem right in the tuna. I did realize after making this that tuna cans now come as 5 oz and not 7 oz anymore, so that may have added to the spices and dried herbs seeming a bit much. I made the sandwiches for someone else's lunch, and was asked why there was so much curry and herbs as I myself had also thought.

Great change of pace, but I prefer a more traditional recipe.  It wasn't bad.

AMAZING recipe! I made this for my husband and he also thought it was one of the best tuna salads he ever ate. We used sugar free sweet pickle relish. I didn't have onion flakes so used 1/4 of a real onion,. It was absolutely delicious!!!

Delicious! I wasn't sure of adding the curry but it made the recipe unique and very memorable. I cut calories out by using only two tbsp of mayo and two of low fat sour cream. I will definitely make this again and again- Thank you Tanaquil!!

Amazing the next day. I added extra curry the day I made it and it tasted great but was too strong the next day. My advice: Make as directed and let sit - adjust flavours before eating if you want. I added peas, corn, raisins and celery to the tuna and pasta. Yummy!

Honesty, I am BLOWN AWAY. I have always liked tuna salad, and for some reason have been craving it lately. Now, I can honestly say I LOVE tuna salad. This is a seriously amazing recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only tweak was I added celery because tuna salad w/out celery is unheard of in my house haha. Other than that, I kept everything the same and it's PERFECTION. I will never use another tuna salad recipe again! I could eat this every day, but because of the mercury in tuna I won't...but I might substitute salmon for tuna and see how it works so I can indulge in this delectable salad more often!

best tuna salad i've had. love the seasonings. only thing i changed was using 2 tablespoons of the sweet relish instead of 3. i like my tuna salad to be more tangy, and it was too sweet for me with the full amount. GREAT RECIPE! [:

I love it and my wife was thrown off by the curry.  I give it five stars but had to take one off bc it's not going to win over everyone in a crowd.  Made recipe as shown with no changes.

This is a great recipe! I leave out the sweet pickle relish, since I'm not a fan of that. I sometimes add some finely diced celery if I have some on hand. It gives it a little extra crunch. This has become a Sunday lunch staple for us!

We thought this was YUMMY! I used 3-6oz. cans of tuna (so there would be extra for a couple days), VERY WELL DRAINED, and doubled all the spices, except for the relish...I just started w/ 2 Tbsps. of that and it was plenty enough sweetness for us. Also, I eye-balled the mayo, using a little at a time, until it was the consistancy that I wanted. I served this on homemade toasted bread w/ cheese and tomato. This was a nice change from my usual recipe, and one that I would make again for sure! Thanks for sahring. :)

EVERYBODY loved this one.  I didn't have dill for some reason, but it didn't matter, this recipe is awesome.  Also doubled the Parmesan cheese because we like things cheesier.  Overall, an amazingly tasty tuna.

I was expecting flavors to really stand out here, but, the relish seemed to be the only ingredient that made this have pizazz.  Couldn't taste or notice the parmesan cheese whatsoever (even though the description says this makes this tuna "stand out").  As a sandwich, nuke one slice of Colby cheese on one slice of bread, then add tuna mixture - makes it quite yummy.

This is amazing!!!!! I used 5 Tb. of miracle whip and chopped up some dill pickles instead of using the relish because that is what I had.  The best tuna salad I have ever had!

Wonderful. I cut the mayo in half, and used a bit less relish. Interestingly, relish is one of my least favorite foods but I went ahead and added it only because this recipe was reviewed so well, and it REALLY worked out! Those of you who prefer a tuna salad without relish may be delighted with this one. I know I was.

I used canned chicken instead of tuna and reduced-fat mayo instead of the regular mayo.  It tasted great!  Because of all the great flavors, I may try the fat-free mayo next time to try to cut down on the total amount of fat grams.

Really, really good! I left out the parm cheese, just seemed to weird, and I didn't want to have to throw it out (I made a HUGE batch of it).I also added hard boiled egg (old habits are hard to break!) The curry powder is amazing in this dish. I will try the parm next time when I make a small batch.

This had great flavor. I accidentally forgot Parmesan cheese, and added 1 less tbsp of mayo on purpose. I also only had dill pickles (no relish) so I minced a couple pickles up and added some agave nectar for light sweetness.

Was looking for something a little different for a tuna melt. This was awesome!  I too used less mayo and added a little celery for crunch. I will definitely be making this again!

This was pretty soggy and had way too much mayo and relish. It didn't taste like much of anything else, despite all of the other seasonings.

This is wonderful. I used double the amount of  fresh parsley and dill and skipped the sweet relish because I was out of it. Next time I make it I will be sure to have the relish. Thanks for this :)

I live this tuna salad recipe and so does everyone I make it for! It's great on a sandwich, served on crustini's as an appetizer, and as a melt. The only mod I make is much less, and fat free mayo. I use approximately 2 tblsp., but I also like my tuna salad fairly dry and use just enough mayo to keep it moist... the relish also helps with that! I ran out of relish once and used honey mustard and it was equally as delicious.   For the tuna melt, I top the tuna with thinly sliced tomato and avacado and a slice of white cheddar. Yum is all I have to say.

Very nice!! I double this recipe, using 3 5oz cans of tuna and just a bit less relish. Otherwise I tried experimenting and came back to using the recipe exactly. I love that it uses ingredients we can keep on hand, and have made this many times now. Thank you Tanaquil for a great recipe!

I had to make a few adjustments due to not having all the ingredients. I used onion powder instead of dried flakes, no dried parsley, only 1/4 tsp dill weed and only 3 TEASPOONS of relish instead of tablespoons. It came out delicious!

This is FANTASTIC! 6 tbsps of Mayo is way too much. I used to work at a health food store and we used to use 3 tbsps of salad dressing for two huge economy cans. I love the ingredients of this recipe just tweeked a bit. To adjust, I use three cans of tuna, and one tbsp of miracle whip (adjust in tiny increments if needed.) I love pickle relish but I try to pour out some of the liquid, otherwise it gets too runny. I use 1/4 tsp of garlic powder with parsley in it and nix that huge tbsp of parsley. YUMMY!

My hubby always gets the tuna salad from the supermarket, so I figured this recipe looked simple enough to give it a try...WOW - loved it!! I added celery for crunch...this is a definite winner, and I have done it many times already.

This is some good tuna salad! I did not have any relish so I chopped up some pickles and added a little dijon mustard. I did not have any onion either. Everything else I kept the same measurements and diced up 1 small stalk of celery because I like the texture.  This was amazing!!

the curry is a GREAT find i didn't know about.  added even more than suggested, though.  skipped out on the dill, beware.  sample a little dill before you go ahead and add as prescribed.

What a lifesaver. I just made this for my notoriously picky grandfather who loooves tuna salad, and it was a hit! We were out of pickle relish so I chopped up a few bread and butter pickle slices and used them instead. The curry and cheese add a nice and unexpected kick. Love it!

An odd combination of ingredients, so I was surprised at how much I loved this tuna!  I'm used to making mine with a little onion and celery, mayo and a little mustard.  This tuna was definitely jazzed up!  I added a little finely chopped red pepper and onion to the mix.  Soooo good!

First time making tuna salad actually and it was freaking awesome!! only thing left out was the dried parsley (thought I had it at home but didn't) and instead of onion flakes I used diced red onion (love the crunch) and it was awesome!! serve this open faced over rye with tomato and cheese!!

That is delicious!  So much better than the standard mayo, mustard, relish.  I didn't have the parmesan :( but it was delish anyway.  Will add that NEXT TIME.  Will def make it again. : )

I really like the combination of flavors but way too much mayo.  I used 4 tablespoons and it was still way too much.  Maybe a little less pickle relish too if you like it more firm.  Mine turned out pretty runny.

I was looking for a different twist to tuna salad and this definitely provided it. I didn't have pickle relish so I used sweet pickles. It was delicious and my husband says it is a repeat.

I'm not generally a big fan of tuna, but this recipe rocks!  I used light mayo to cut the fat and finely minced onion.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as stated.  So yummy!  Thanks!

I love this tuna salad! It's delicious as written, but easy to tweak to your preference. I love dill and curry, so I add them liberally. It makes a super tuna melt. Delicious on grilled rye with swiss. Thanks, so much, for the recipe, Barbie!

Great tuna salad--the parmesan cheese and curry in it is so good. I made as stated except only used 1 tsp parsley.  I let the tuna salad sit for a little bit so that the onion flakes don't have any crunch to them and the flavors meld.

WOW!!! Really a gourmet version of tuna salad, like you would have at a high end bistro! We did use fresh dill and parsley and also grilled our own fresh tuna instead of canned. The curry and relish add a sweet taste, this is great by itself or as a sandwich...it's just too fabulous!

This was the BEST tuna salad I have ever had.... hands down.  I cut down on the mayo slightly, and I only used about half of the relish it called for.  It was so creamy and delicious and full of flavor!  I will definitely make this over and over.

This stuff is great!!! Waaaaaay too much mayo though! I stopped adding at four tbs. and that was still too much. I had to go back to add more tuna and spices just to even it out!! We ate it with lettuce and tomato as a wrap! Way yum!!

This tuna was AWESOME!  This will be my "go to" tuna from now on.  I just kinda eyeballed everything, but I did use all the ingredients.  I sliced a heirloom tomato in half and served it on top, it was a wonderful light dinner for my husband and I.

Honestly, just okay. Not sure about the rave reviews - lacked the fresh taste that characterizes a good tuna salad. I use curry powder extensively, but this is one of the only times I have really not cared for it in a recipe. Will not make this one again.

I love tuna salad but wanted a little more flavor then the usual so thought I would try this but have to admit I was a little worried about the curry . I left out the parmesam cheese . it was great . I couldn't even taste the curry . I will for sure make this again.

This was just blah.  I love curry so was excited by this, but it just tasted, well, kind of tasteless.  Not sure what the excitement is on it.  Maybe it is because I like my tuna with Miracle Whip.  I followed the recipe and will not be making this again.

Excellent tuna salad!  I found this a few weeks ago and have been craving it every week since the first time I made it.  I'm so excited to see it featured as today's recipe of the day.  I never knew how much I liked curry powder until I made this.

love this! it really makes tuna salad special! i eat this once a week or so, and its even better overnight in the fridge to let the flavors meld. now i usually make it without the parmesan, but ive tried both ways and they are both good. the curry really does add so much, without tasting like 'curried tuna'!

This was just okay.   I'll try it again and see if maybe I did something wrong.  I was in a hurry and mixed it in my food processor, which gave it a creamy consistency which I didn't really like (not the recipe's fault, I know).  I drained the tuna, but I think I'll rinse it next time too.  I'll modify my rating if these changes make a difference.

This was delicious!  I would never have thought about adding curry to tuna... I have made it several times - and people LOVE it....  I do add fresh onion (vidalia) when I have it... and I try to watch my diet, I used dill cube relish instead of sweet - and light mayo...

This is the best tuna salad we've ever had! We've been buying tuna salad from delis for years, and this is truly better than anything we've ever bought fresh from the deli.  I only had fresh parsley on hand, so I didn't use any parsley. I halved the curry and put in an extra pinch of garlic powder according to our tastes. I also skipped the Parmesan cheese because my husband doesn't like it.  The mayo was just the right amount for us, I thought. It was moist yet not wet. I did a really good job draining the tuna first, though. That may account for the problems.  So good! A really excellent recipe. I never would have thought to add the curry.

This was really good, but I didn't taste any other seasonings but the dill.  I did find that 3 Tbl. of pickle relish was way too sweet for my taste, but that's just personal preference.  I also added 1/2 cup chopped celery and 1 chopped boiled egg to mine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe!  I doubled the recipe, but didn't need to double the salad dressing...4T did the trick.  Also, I don't keep onion flakes in my pantry...and I didn't feel like chopping a fresh onion...so, I put in a palm full of Tastefully Simple Onion Onion.  Also didn't have dill, but didn't miss it.  It's really the curry and parmesan cheese that makes this tuna salad special!  I'll probably add more curry and parm next time.  YUM!

My family and I did not care for this recipe. the sweet relish is just too much in tuna salad. I think it could of been better if you switch the sweet relish for regular dill relish. I also didnt care for the tumeric in the recipe. I wont make this recipe again.

I have used this recipe for years but adjusted the ingredients like omitting the sweet relish and dill. We use albacore tuna and carefully mix it but leave some chunky. We also like to add celery to it and salt and pepper.

We LOVED this. So much better than "normal" tuna salad. It's great on toast with a slice of tomato or on crackers. I might add some boiled egg next time...

I've made this recipe probably 10 times in the last couple weeks. I love it. The best tuna salad I've ever made. I even added cooked chicken instead of tuna once, and it was wonderful. Sometimes I add diced fresh onions instead of dried. And I'm dairy intolerant, so I don't add the Parmesan. It is yum!!!

My family all agree that this makes the best tuna sandwiches we have ever had.  I didn't have curry in the house, so I left that out the first time I made it.  I included the curry and reduced the amount of relish the 2nd time I made it, to make it a little less sweet.  It's great!

I know my photo doesn't look great but this was awesome! I think mayo ration may be off because I had to add another can of tuna to make it a little firmer. Taste is out of this world.

I'm actually kinda confused by how good this is! I just came to look for a recipe because I've been craving tuna salad for about 3 days. This one seemed a bit odd but it's definitely good. I didn't have the dill or the parsley to hand but it's still great. I'm definitely going to keep them on hand so I can make this when I've got my midnight munchies.

i had some albacore tuna sitting in my pantry for almost a year... found this recipe just to be rid of the darn tuna, but now we can't wait to make more! i did use less mayo... just stopped adding once it looked good to me (about half the suggested amount). anyway, best tuna salad EVER!

This was soooo delicious! I did a few changes just because I was afraid of putting too much of certain ingredients.  I used 2 cans tuna, 10 Tbsp mayo, 1/8tsp salt, 1/8tsp pepper, chopped finely some celery, and I kept the rest of the ingredients as listed (so i didn't double the rest of the ingredients)! It was perfect! Those 2 cans should fill about 6 hamburger buns.

Good and easy!  I thought there was too much mayo in this recipe.  My hint would be to drain the tuna, then add a TBSP of mayo at a time and mix.  Stop when you think it's too runny.

Actually, the tuna tasted very similar to Chick-Fil-A's chicken salad sandwich. I am suprised at how many 5 star ratings this recipe recieved. While the tuna IS flavorful, I'm not sure it's THE BEST flavor, worthy of 5 stars.  It was ok and a nice change from a typical tuna salad, but I probably won't be making it this way again.

This recipe is very good, I never would have considered some of these ingrediants for tuna salad. When first reading the recipe 6 tbsp of mayo sounded like a lot to me for one 7 oz can of tuna, so I made it with a 12 oz can of tuna and it was perfect, not to wet or too dry. I also left the other ingrediant amounts the same and it was delicious.

This was excellent.  I must say though I ended up using 6 cans of 6oz tuna to feed a family of 6.  Sure I had some leftovers but not much.  I think just adding the mayo (I used kraft made with olive oil) a little at a time until you reach the consistency for your liking is the way to go. The curry addition is absolutely fabulous!

The whole family agreed that this is the best tuna salad we've ever had.  I did add chopped boiled egg.  I've also swapped the tuna for chicken to make a great chicken salad.  The recipe can be multiplied with great results.

The recipe tastes great. I am not normally a fan of tuna but this makes it taste really good.   My room mates however did not like the smell. As good as this tastes I don't think I want to make it again. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just something to consider if you are living in a small space with others.

My family hates tuna, but loves this. Instead of pickle relish I chopped up homemade 14 day sweet pickles.

A nice tuna sandwich on a hot day is excellent - but this is so much more than a tuna sandwich, this is amazing. I had no Parmesan this time around, so I am definitely looking forward to making it again.

Wonderful! I'm hooked on this salad. I used leftover grilled terriaki tuna and leftover grilled salmon (each had a little garlic in the original recipes) the first time I made it. Now I grill the tuna just for this recipe.

This is a great tuna salad recipe, I do like to add chopped celery also extra garlic and onion. Also good for grilled tuna and cheese sandwich.

Loved this receipe.  We added a larger can of chicken and a bit less pickle relish to suit our own personal taste. But otherwise wonderful!

This recipe would be perfect with less relish and a little less parsley. Still, it is easily the best tuna salad recipe I've ever had.  Would probably be equally good with chicken.

YUM! I'd give this 4 1/2 if I could. It was good served in a sandwich with lettuce and very good served as a tuna melt on one slice of bread with a slice of mozzarella cheese melted on top. Delish!

This is a great recipe!  Honestly, I tried it because it sounded so odd, lol.  I like "different" recipes and I thought the combination of parmesan and curry sounded so unusual.  But it definitely works!  I had a 5 oz can of tuna, so I cut the mayo to 4 T and left  everything else the same.  I love it!!  I have been making it every week now that I've tried it.  Quick, delicious and cheap!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe. Made a bed of lettuce with shredded carrots, celery, radishes, cucumber and black olives.  Then topped the whole thing with a scoop of the Tuna Salad.  Made a healthy and filling dinner for hubby and me.

Good recipe since it gives a lot of good ideas on stuff to add that I never thought of before.  Will make it again but will likely make the following changes: Lower the amount of mayo to 4 tablespoons-even draining the tuna very well I thought the consistency was a little bit too watery but to be fair I was using chunk light (although a very dry and solid chunk light). Lower the amount of relish-at least using the sweet relish I have, three tablespoons overpowered most of the other flavors.  The relish gives the recipe a lot of it's flavor but I'm probably going to use 2 tablespoons next time. Increase the amount of onion flakes or possibly use fresh onions-this was one of the things I really missed compared to a regular tuna salad, the 1/8 teaspoon of dried onions is almost impossible to taste so I will either double/triple the flakes or just use fresh onion. But even as it is I ate two sandwiches just now right after making them, didn't even make it to the plate so this is definitely a keeper.

Dill should be reduced to 1/4 teaspoon to be able to taste anything else.  Not too soupy with the full amount of mayo.

This was a great recipe, but perhaps a little too pungent.  The next time I make this (and there will be a next time), I'll either decrease some of the seasoning or increase the tuna.  The relish really added a good flavour.  I served this in scooped out tomatoes.

This continues to be my all time favorite for lunch. I pair it with some double fiber bread, and I've got a really healthy meal. I haven't been able to add the onion powder since we're out, but it still tastes amazing.

I was looking for something a bit different and tried this. My husband and I didn't care for this tuna salad. For one, it has too much mayo and too much sweet relish. And the taste just didn't knock our socks off. I added celery & green onion. I will keep my mom's old fashioned tuna salad recipe from now on.

Wow! I will be making this again.  This is a nice change from regular tuna salad.  The flavors blend together nicely and dill reigns supreme in this.  My mom had lunch with us today and said this was delicious.

Amazing!! This recipe has exceeded the taste test of my kids who always complain about tuna casseroles, sandwiches etc. I was reluctent to add the 3 TBS of relish because my husband is not a pickle person though I am glad I did. However, there is no doubt that the curry is the secret ingredient that makes a world of difference and has won the heart of my entire household. Will be making tuna often now (without complaints) and also can't wait to share with others!

Hmmm... after much thought I finally decided that I do like this recipe... just not all THAT much. It was much better after sitting in the fridge overnight. I just think there was too much going on for my tuna salad taste. It was sweet, partially from the relish and partially from the Miricle Whip. I added some celery and fresh onion for crunch, and reduced the Miricle Whip by a tablespoon. I did eat all of this on white toast, but I can't say that I'll make it again.

I fancy myself a tuna aficionado.  I have been looking at the recipe for months and finally decided today to make it for lunch.  I wanted to make it early so that the flavors would meld together by lunch.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have dill and I only had fresh parsley not dried.  I have to tell you I was very dissapointed in this recipe.  First of all there is WAY to much mayo.  The tuna is practically swimming in it.  I think 3 T would have been better.  There is also to much relish.  Alls you could taste was relish and mayo so it was really a mayo relish sandwich.  I will not be making this again.  In fact, I will probably throw out what is left of it.

The flavor is unique and quite good.  I used half the mayo and only 1 tbsp relish.  I think I will tweak this recipe a little and add a little celery or apple for added texture!!!

Yum Yum! I knew I was going to like this b/c all of the ingredients are my fav. So I went by the recipe with the exception of the dried onion, I like the real thing and I added egg whites cuz I love em in tuna. I made a 12oz can of tuna so I eyeballed the measuring just a little over and it was great!!! I started taking bites right out of the bowl but then decided to refrigerate for ahwile for a cold salad and for everything to blend together. I would've never thought of using curry in a tuna salad, but wow, it's perfect!!! Thank-you for recipe it will become a staple :)

It was good, but a little on the runny side, due to the great amount of mayo. I used half mayo, half yoghurt, but still, I think I should have lowered them.

Really diggin' this recipe. Although I would make the following changes: used 1/3 of the mayo the recipe called for, doubled the Parmesan cheese, fresh parsley instead of dried, fresh green onions instead of the onion flakes and my oh my! What a delicious salad.

I always wondered why my girlfriend's tuna salad was a hit EVERYTIME she entertained!!  She uses curry on everything and now I know why.  I now have the secret and my family is thrilled. Thank you TANAQUIL for sharing this wonderful combination of ingrediants to a great tuna salad!

Excellent!  I also used Pampered Chef Dill Mix and a prepared Sandwich Spread (mayo & relish).  Be sure to let it sit awhile or those dehydrated onions will be crunchy.  Great as a low-carb salad!  Thanks for sharing your secret recipe!

I served this salad on croissants at a wedding reception that I catered and it was one of the 1st things gone off the buffet. The flavors are simple and meld well together. Some people were skeptical because of the curry but it just adds a wonderful undertone to the flavors.

My tuna can was 6 oz. not 7 oz. (perhaps this is another sign of the current economic times?) so I recommend adjusting the recipe.  I loved the curry taste and wouldn't reduce the curry which makes this recipe different from any other tuna salad.  I used only 2 TBLS of mayo and 2 TBLS of relish.  I refrigerated the tuna salad and the longer the recipe sat, the drier it became so it needed more mayo; not relish.  I also kept all of the other ingredients the same despite the smaller tuna can and next time I will decrease the dill but keep the cheese, parsley, etc. the same.  Will make again but I know that true tuna salad lovers will probably not like this different recipe.

This will turn out pretty mushy if you use chunk light tuna. Either cut back a little on the mayo or serve only with crackers (unless, of course, you like messy sandwiches). Seems to have the best flavor after sitting in the fridge for a few hours so that all of the dry ingredients are rehydrated and the flavors get blended.

Excellent! I served these with the "Nests" from "Birds Nest Egg Salad" found on this site. I added finely chopped celery, a little bit of celery seed and a touch more curry (I love curry!). I also took others advice and did not use all the Mayo at once. I wound up using about 4 T of it. 
This was a great recipe and with the nests, it makes a great presentation as well. It looks like a lot of work went into it and very little did.

This is a very good tuna salad recipe.  The curry I had on hand was a little old so I don't know if that affected the curry taste (not too strong) but I will definately make this recipe from now on.
I added mayo until I got the consistancy I wanted.

Thanks!

I enjoyed this. I have been making tuna salad one way my whole life, and I decided to try something different. While I like this, I still like my old recipe better, but I think this is an excellent recipe for tuna salad that I wouldn't be ashamed to serve anywhere. Thank you for your wonderful recipe!

My husband and I have been looking for tuna recipe that meets both of our needs, I'm more plain and he's more gourmet.  This totally worked!  The only change I made was to leave out the curry, because we didn't have any.  Stupendous tuna salad!!!

Love it, Love it. I took some of the advice of other raters, I added mayo little by little till I got the consistency that I wanted. I love curry, so I added a little bit more than the recipe called for. I also chopped fresh onions, red bell pepper and parsley. Hmmmm so good! Will make over and over again.

This was my first time ever making tuna salad and I really liked it since it had a lot of flavors going on - loved the hint of curry and the dill.  I substituted fresh red onion for onion flakes and only used about 1/2 the mayo - great recipe I will definitely be making again.

Excellent tuna salad!  I thought this was really very good and a different twist to the plain old tuna salad.  I made it with the exact amounts listed in the recipe and it turned out perfect.  I put all the dry ingredients in a small bowl and mixed with a fork, so they would be better distributed into the tuna. If you are concerned about the amount of mayo, just add it last ...one "measured" Tbl. at a time.  I found that 6 Tbls. was the perfect amount.  A big scoop of this tuna salad would be great on a bed of baby spinach or lettuce on a hot summer day.  Thank you for sharing your 5 star recipe!!

Wow! Is this GOOD! I didn't have any dill relish, so I just chopped up a big dill pickle. I also didn't have dehydrated minced onion, so I used a diced green onion. I also added a couple drops of Frank's Hot Sauce. So. Darn. Tasty. This will be my tuna salad recipe from now on.

The absolute best tuna salad I've tasted.  My husband agreed.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I used white albacore tuna packed in water and drained it well.  Normally I use a lowfat mayo but used regular mayo for this recipe. Excellent recipe - it's for sure a keeper.  Thanks for sharing it.

This tuna salad rocks!  The curry makes it so so special.  I only modified a bit.  I used 12 oz solid white albacore (vs 7 oz) and increased the curry to 1/2 tsp.  PERFECTION and so quick to assemble.

This recipe was a nice variation of plain old tuna salad.  I love the taste of the dill. I thought it called for way too much mayo though.  I would recommend cutting the amount of mayo in half, adding some celery for a crunch and putting some salt and pepper in there.  I put celery salt in mine and it turned out great.

We LOVE this recipe!  I told my friend that she HAD to try my new tuna recipe - she looked at the color and gave me a strange look!  The dill and curry powder do give it an interesting color, especially if you are just expecting plain old tuna!  We love it though - thanks for the great twist on an old favorite!!

This was a very good tuna salad recipe. I followed the recipe, except I did not have any dill weed. Next time however, I think I will use fresh chopped onion instead of the minced onion flakes, and use a little less relish and mayo.

I have made this twice and didn't love it.  It doesn't really taste or feel like tuna salad; it's more like a cracker spread.

This is really good. Makes a sophisticated tuna sandwich.  I skimped on the mayo at first, it was just as good with less- but my husband likes a little more, so I added another tablespoon. So the recipe is good, but if you want less fat, use less mayo- the flavor makes up for it!!

I really enjoyed this.  The addition of parmsean cheese is amazing!  I did, however, make just a few changes.  I used minced garlic rather than garlic powder.  As I don't like curry, I substituted creamed horshradish.  I have to say, with these changes, this was absolutely fabulous!

I made this with all mayo and yellow hot madras curry powder, it was well recieved and disappeared quickly too! The first time I made this I used red curry powder and it had a chile powder taste, this time it was better.

There's a lot of very strong flavors going on in this salad and there's good news and bad news about that--it doesn't really taste like tuna.  So whether you like this will depend on whether you want your tuna salad to taste like tuna or not.  Nevertheless, it's very good.  I had intended to only eat one small sandwich on a roll, but went back for a second one because it was so good.  You can do a lot of playing around with this recipe to adapt it to your own tastes.  The addition of curry really sets it apart from the ordinary.

I always add less mayo to this recipe and never add relish because I hate relish.  It's quite fabulous but you don't taste the tuna at all.  Today I used mashed chickpeas instead of tuna, just to try it out and it was super awesome fabulousness!!!! Definitely doing that again!!!

This was easy but very good.  I didn't have curry, but I think it would have complemented it well.  I used a little less mayo, but kept everything else the same.  The dill is an excellent addition as is the relish.  My husband and I devoured it.

Absolutely delicious.  The entire family loved it.  I tripled the recipe and it was gone in no time.  Used chopped dill pickle instead of sweet relish.  Used my normal amount of mayo instead of following recipe.  Thanks!

I used this with my day old baked halibut and the results were stellar!! The curry was such a welcomed ingredient. I also used fresh onion and parsley for some extra texture.  Try it with your favorite fish - this is a keeper!

I loved all the herbs, and the curry gave it a great kick.  I almost forgot to add the relish, as it's listed as an ingredient, yet omitted from the actual text of the recipe. I finally threw it in last, but I had tasted it before adding and loved it, and then after adding it, found that it added way too much sweetness.  Even my 11 year old son commented that it was too sweet (and he is a sugar junky!).  I cut down the mayo as advised by other reviewers. Eyeballed it to probably what was 3 or 4 tablespoons, max.  Just until it looked creamy enough.  I will definitely make this again, and next time will either use regular relish (not sweet) or omit this altogether (or use less).  I also think that the addition of some celery would add a nice crunch.  Thank you for submitting...even after all was said & done, it was gone in a matter of minutes!

I thought it was odd at how much went into this, yet it tasted just like the tuna salad I make when I just combine pickles, mayo, and tuna. I think the relish overpowered everything. I did cut the mayo in half and could have probably done with less than that. This was perfectly good, but I was expecting something with some more flavor.

Not bad.  Better than just throwing tuna and mayo together, maybe I am just not a big fan of curry powder.  Tasted like a smoky version of tuna fish.  I like it on crackers better than a sandwich, I think the extra salt balances the curry out.

I use about 2/3 the amount of mayo and a little extra garlic powder. i love this recipe with triscuit fire roasted tomato and olive oil crackers. i also enjoy it on it's own. since finding this recipe 2 weeks ago, i've made it at least 5 times. i'm working on my sixth right now. it's a great twist on an old favorite!

Really good tuna salad. I didn't have curry powder, so I used dry mustard instead -- worked really well. I also chopped up some dill pickles instead of using sweet relish and added about a half cup of finely diced celery for some extra crunch. YUM.

I put 3 tbsp mayo, added chopped peanuts and green onions rather than dried onion.  I reduced the parsley to 1 tsp, though with fresh parsley it might be good with a tablespoon.  This was an excellent recipe.  Thanks!

Made this Tuna Salad today & just joined so as to rate it


I give it a gajillion yum yum yums!!

The cosistency is wonderful and the flavors really work well together

I used a little more minced onion & dill and 1 Tablespoon less each of the mayo & pickle relish 

Fist tasting was on regular white bread which was delicious, second sampling was on some Nabisco Vegetable Thin crackers *super duper on these* & the last sampling was on a slice of sourdough bread *the sourdough over powered the tuna salad so wont be putting it on that anymore*

My only suggestion is to let this chill for at least 15 minutes before using/serving so as to let all the flavors have a chance to meld

Thanks Bunches for my new fav tuna salad recipe

Tastes delicious - - the best tuna salad recipe I've tried.  I would add some celery and some tiny slices of green apple or red grapes to add crunch and sweetness.  To make it lighter, I used Light Mayo, and just used enough to bind the mixture together.

Very delicious way to jazz up the usual classic version of tuna saled. I doubled the recipe and added 2T chopped celery and 2T chopped red onion. This added a nice bit of crunch.

Very unique. Both my daughter and I enjoy the old mayo celery tuna standby. This we each liked a lot. Interesting flavour combinations, especially the dill and curry. The proportions are right on. I don't understand all the fuss about too much mayonaise, just use a little less. I thought it was just right. Thanks for this. I will make it often.
Update:  19 March 2016 - having not made this in quite a while it's still delicious. Family thinks I'm nuts when I opted for a lovely toasted tuna sandwich rather than a hamberger!

Very tasty tuna salad, easy to tweak for your own taste. I didn't have relish, but it was still good. I used Smart Balance Mayo to reduce the fat and make it healthier. I also used The Pampered Chef Dill seasoning mix for the dill. I enjoy this with potato chips, crackers, and I'm sure it's good in pita bread too (wished I had some)! I didn't really notice the Parmesan too much like some reviewers did, for me it blended in fine. I like recipes that use "creative" twists and surprise seasonings to make something ordinary different and good.

I love, love this recipe! I make this often for lunch and my boyfriend asks for it every week. I revised the recipe for our taste my using albacore, sweet onions (omit the dried onions) I also omit the parsley and I add in some diced celery for a nice crunch. All the spices together really make this tuna, by far the best I have ever eaten.

This is a very unusual tasting recipe. I liked it a lot as did my family. I scaled down the mayo and parsley and added a bit more dill weed. I also used real onions as I don't like the flakes. I also added pecans and pineapple bits. This is a super tasty recipe. Thanks for sharing. I make it all the time and people are always asking for the recipe.

This was a nice change but I couldn't eat too much of it.  The taste was just too much.  I like my tuna salad to taste like tuna and this doesn't.  I might try cutting back on all the extras to tame it a little next time.

I grilled fresh tuna steaks. Also added some garlic pepper to jazz it up some.

I did the recipe as said before, with less mayo and relish. Very good! I agree that the curry and parmesan are the key ingredients! Enjoy!

This hits the spot if you're wanting something different.  I agree with the other reviewers when they say there's too much mayo.  I didn't even use half the amount called for.  I also didn't want to overwhelm it with the sweet pickle relish and dill, so I scaled those back as well.  Other than that, pretty darn tasty! I like the addition of curry.

This was delicious! I didn't have relish or dill, and I used fresh onion (doubled the amount as was suggested by others). I ate it on Ritz crackers, nothing fancy :), but it tasted superb. Will be making again, thank you!

I think the measurements are off and so our experience with this was way to over powering! We added two cans of tuna and the mayo was still way too much. The curry was a nice added flavor, but again I felt there wasn't a good blend of flavors.I'm sure if I tweeked things a bit and added some crunchy pickles and almonds this recipe would be great, will have to try again with my own experimenting. As the recipe stands now, not my favorite!

The mayo was alright with me as I used Smart Balance Mayo but there was 1 TBL too much of sweet relish.  Not bad though.

Very good recipe.  Nice change from the old standard no-frills tuna salad.  I made it just as written, doubling the recipe, except went a little easier on the mayo (doubling it, it was starting to look *very* mayonnaise-y at 8T and had to actually add a third can of tuna to thin it out).  Except for my family's preference on the mayo, this was really good.

I use a 7 oz. pouch of albacore tuna in water, about 5 T of mayo, half of a fresh red onion instead of onion flakes, and a little more parmesan. I have made this for my fiance several times (since he's tired of my vegetarian meals) and he absolutely loves it!

fairly good recipe. i tried it today for the first time. after using that much mayo i ended up having to put another can of tuna in it and added more spices. i used sweet relish and did not have no dill on hand so i didn't add it but with everything else in it it's pretty good. i only gave it 4 stars because turned out to be way too much mayo.i like tuna salad with celery and didn't have any but with the relish it tastes like celery is in it. thank you. i will make again.

I really liked this.  I give it 4 stars only because I should have read the reviews first and used a big can of tuna to tone down the sweetness from the relish.  Maybe it would be better with dill.  Personal preference I think, but I still thought it was very good!

This tuna recipe is by far the best i've ever had! I'm addicted. I could eat it every day and no other way. I'm always trying to spice up tuna when i make it but it never has been as delicious as this. I now eyeball the recipe and sometimes instead of the sweet pickle relish, i'll cut up reg dill pickles and put them in the recipe. It's delicious either way.

Great recipe.  Based on previous reviews, I lowered the mayo to 4 TBSP.  Next time I'll try it with some egg and let it sit overnight.

Great recipe. I've used this recipe w/ chicken also, just as good. My only suggestion is to let the batch sit in the fridge for awhile to blend all the flavors properly. Have added chopped boiled egg with no additional dressing or seasoning.  Makes it more of a meal.

Soooo yummy!! I agree that the recipe tastes best with less mayo and with one night in the fridge...the flavors just melded into deliciousness overnight! I might also add finely chopped onion or celery for the crunch-factor, but even that's not necessary. It's wonderful!!Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this last night.  I did not add curry and added celery, cayenne (dash) and stuffed it in a tomato and served with a roll. It made a nice light and refreshing meal for my husband and myself.  Next time I want to try it with crab.  Thanks

This was really yummy, and I generally do not like tuna salad.  I did make the following modifications - doubled the recipe -  used only 4 tbsp mayo, 3 tbsp relish, added salt and freshly ground pepper, and about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice.  The fishy canned tuna taste was minimum. Husband loved.

Very good, I usually don't like relish, but with all the other seasoning, it did not stand out as much in the flavor.    Six tablespoons is a bit too much mayo unless you want dip.

I ate this over a salad. What I did like in this was the parm. cheese (I used fresh), I think it sort of gave it texture. I only had to use 1 heaping T of mayo (any more it would have been soupy), 1T relish, and vidalla onion. I will def. add the fresh parm. again and maybe more curry. Thanks!

Loved it! I made this into some tuna melts for my husband and I on a rather cool, dreary day.  A-1 comfort food! The curry and the dill compliment each other perfectly with the tuna.  I'm looking forward to taking leftovers with me to lunch.

I wanted to try this recipe but didn't have tuna, so I used canned chicken breast instead. I added a chopped dill pickle, otherwise followed the recipe. When I first tasted it after mixing, I thought, well it's OK. After it sat in the fridge for an hour or so, the flavors were enhanced and really perked up the chicken. I love the kick that curry adds and the parmesan gives it some body and richness. Tuna would definitely give it the tang to complement it perfectly--I will use it next time. Thanks for sharing Tan!

I used to shy away from making/eating tuna salad until I tried this recipe.  Delicious!!! I made a few changes though.  First, I used dill pickle relish instead of sweet relish, omitted curry powder, and I added three sliced green onions.  I also used toasted slices of texas toast (by Wonder Bread). Wonderful!!!

I enjoyed this. I left out the relish and instead of onion powder added chives. I like the taste the parm. cheese gives it. I think an egg would be a nice addition.

As others have stated, I anticipated the parmesan and curry to really stand out, but found them to be on the subtle side.  At first I was slightly disappointed, as I love parm and curry.  But it didn't take me too long to really enjoy it for what it is - a wonderful blend of ALL ingredients.  Nothing stands out or overpowers another - including the tuna (which is good because I am not much of a fish person).  It truly is a unique and wonderful flavor!  Very unexpected for tuna salad.  Thanks for sharing!

Ok, this is an update after 'just adding curry' to my own tuna salad recipe back in June.  Tan, what a nice change from the usual!  I made the recipe with just a little altering... for approx 8.5 oz I used a scant 6T of mayo and upped the curry to ¾ tsp.  I really did enjoy this but I have come to the decision that I prefer my tuna salad without relish.  It just didnt do anything for me BUT I will be addding the parmesan and especially the curry from now on.  Thanks so much for the great idea!

This is sensational!  I added a little less dill like someone recommended and it was unlike any other tuna salad I had.  I made a double recipe and kept half for dipping and sandwiches, and then I added 1 cup of alphabet pasta to the other half for a side dish.  So very very good!

Used this salad for lunch in tortilla wraps with iceberg lettuce and celery. I liked the addition of curry but I thought the parmesan taste could have been stronger.

yummm... as my husband described it, a very "light and crisp" flavored tuna salad without the "fishy aftertaste".  I didn't have minced onion, so I chopped up some fresh onion and added that instead.  Very good!  Will make this as a lighter alternative to my usual tuna salad with hardboiled egg.

I concur that this recipe is great. My mom used to always chop up velveeta cubes into the tuna salad, put it onto a hamburger bun, wrap it in foil, then heat it in the oven until toatsed. I substituted some sharp cheddar, and used this recipe. Wonderful!

A  very nice recipe for a sandwich! I did make some changes though: Omitted dill (because I don't like it) and substituted mango chutney for sweet pickle relish (which I didn't have in my pantry). Because of the chutney I essened the amount of curry powder. Added some sambal oelek to the salad and lettuce and shredded carrots to the sandwich to make it more fresh. Had a very flavourful lunch!

Made for lunch today and was very good.  It was a little sweet I thought and I'm not sure if it is from the amount of sweet pickle relish or because I used toasted potato bread which is a little sweeter.  Next time I make, I will use a different bread and probably cut the relish down to 2 tbsp.  Thanks

The taste of this was like no other tuna salad I'd ever had. The curry and parm definetly made a difference. I used a light mayo and chopped dill pickles because that is what I had on hand and this still great. The only thing is, I don't know if I would serve this like a dip(maybe because I'm so used to having this with pasta or a sandwich),so I served this on top of a toasted whole grain english muffin.

I really liked this recipe.  It's a nice change from "normal" tuna salad.  I only changed a couple of things. I didn't have sweet relish so I used chopped dill pickles and therefore I left out the dill weed.  I also added a teaspoon of sugar to make up for the sweetness I was losing by not using sweet relish.  I increased the curry to 3/4 teaspoon since I love curry.  I reduced the mayo to 3 tablespoons (1 tablespoon of regular and 2 of fat free) and it was more than enough. And, like others, I used real onion.  I served this tossed with pasta shells and a couple of handfuls of sugar snap peas for crunch.  It was wonderful!  I'm going to make it again for sandwiches.

This was a really great recipe. The ingredient list is 5 stars. However, adjust the measurements to fit your taste. My tuna was a 6 oz. can so I didn't add as much mayo or relish. Also I didn't have curry or parsley on hand so I mixed chili powder, seasoned salt, a dash of italian seasoning (has garlic & parsley) and some cracked black pepper. Even my hubby liked it and he doesn't usually eat tuna/potato/macaroni salads.

Let me start off by saying, I hate canned tuna.  BUT...this recipe changed that for me.  I didn't change a thing, it's that perfect.  I make open faced tuna melts out of my tuna salad.  1/2 bagel with the tuna salad, a slice of tomato and a slice of cheese of your choice baked in the oven for a few minutes and it is FANTASTIC.

Made it, add all the ingredients as recipe called.... but it didn’t work for me, I had to modify the Recipe? after all. I didn’t have much time so I had to improvise. I Added 3 boiled eggs (sliced into a small cubes), 1/2 finely chopped onion, 1 stalk of celery chopped as well and 2 small dill pickles cubes for crunchiness. Pinch of black pepper and salt. Man that was delish. I served it over a toasted ray bread, and sprinkled with green onion for demonstration, everyone was raving about the taste, soft and crunchy at the same time. Defiantly making it next time, but as I stated above.

My favorite new favorite way to jazz up boring tuna salad! My only additions I made were to add 2 chopped hard boiled eggs,( I used a 5 ounce can of water packed tuna was all I had),and I 1/2 T of sweet pickle relish with the addition of 1 small grated carrot,to lower the carbs for my way of eating. I will be making my tuna salad this way from now on! Thanks for posting,and kooto's to Barbie for inventing!

Modified, this is a good recipe base. There is way too much mayonnaise, one to two tablespoons, stirred in slowly is better. Six tablespoons made mine a mayonnaise soup.  With dried ingredients, the directions also need to recommend letting the completed mixture stand until the dried ingredients absorb the moisture. Otherwise you can bite unpleasantly on a hard chunk. 
     It is only a preference, but I like chopped bread and butter pickles. I often substitute them for sweet pickle relish. This modified recipe also stands up if you omit one or two ingredients you do not like except for the tuna and mayonnaise.

The curry powder isn't  detectable as an ingredient ,  but it does add a subtle flavor that goes well with the other seasonings.   I like it!  Thanks for the recipe Barbie - you're a real "doll".

This is my go to Tuna Salad recipe! I’ve stuffed this salad into mini phyllo dough cups as a nice appetizer, served it on crackers, and of course eaten this wonderful salad on homemade wheat and homemade rye bread !!! Always a hit!!

This was excellent. Other reviewers said you can adjust the amount of ingredients to meet family tastes. That is so true. I cut the mayonnaise in half, added more Paremesan cheese, and added everything else as the recipe called. It was excellent.

I'm not usually a big tuna salad fan, but I tried this recipe when I was craving it out of the blue. This is absolutely amazing.  I cut the relish only about 1/3 of the recommended amount but otherwise it's perfect. So flavorful, not fishy at all. I've made it 4 times in the last two weeks! I follow a gluten free and keto diet, so I eat it on cheese crackers (100% cheese) or chicharrones. Enjoy!

Delicious and I have been eating tuna for 60 yrs.  I used double the tuna because I like a firmer tuna salad.  I used canned AND you MUST DRAIN TUNA THOROUGHLY for it to be right for a sandwich.  I squish the opened can with the lid on over the sink and squeeze with the can tilted to drain/squeeze all I can out (sometimes I put it in a bowl for the cat who shows up as soon as he hears the can opening, Lol.)  If you do not want to drain, then buy the pouches, at minimum 2 small pouches for this recipe.

Made no changes to recipe, served in pita bread w/ spring mix salad & sweet vidalia onion dressing. Recipe was judged by family without the dressing. Everyone in our family of varying tastes ( husband & 4 children) liked it. I suspect this will be our go-to tuna salad recipe.

We loved this recipe!!  I personally love curry, so it hit the spot.  Not too much curry, but the flavor was there.  My son who honestly isnt picky inhaled two sandwiches, lol.  I'll be making this again.

adding fresh onions and increasing it to 1/4 of a medium onion. Added fresh garlic. Substituted Miracle Whip and increased as needed. Added a speck of ground pepper. 

I also used chopped dill pickle instead of sweet pickle relish. Just me I suppose. I don't like the taste of sweet relish.

Great change from ordinary tuna salad. I added hard boiled eggs, a dollop of sour cream, real onion and a couple dashes of graham Marsala seasoning because I thought it would go well with the curry powder and I was right!

As I'm stirring up this tuna for the "hundreth" time I realize I've never reviewed it...it has been my go-to recipe a while now, absolutely delicious and a favorite to take on our boat served as a spread with crackers. To me using the Italian tuna in a jar is key, I can find Tonnino brand at Walmart and Publix, more expensive but definitely worth it. The only change I make is decreasing mayo to 4 Tbsp and increasing Parmesan to 2 Tbsp. Hey, that's saving 1 tablespoon of fat, right? Also is better to make a little early so flavor a marry and dried onion softens. Wonderful recipe, thanks Barbie!

Made it before, thought it was great. Just doubled the recipe, swapped out half the sweet relish for jalapeño spread, and it's AWESOME.

5 stars before, 5 stars now.

This recipe is super good. I was never a fan of tuna until recently, and wanted to try a tuna salad. I didn’t have mayo so I substituted that with this dill greek yogurt dip I had. Because I used a dill dressing, I 86’d the dried dill. It turned out delicious! *chef’s kiss* I can’t wait to try it with mayo and dried dill instead.

I followed this exactly using fresh tuna that we had cooked on the grill.  I think the smoky flavor really added to it.  I followed the instructions although I had to use real onions because I didn't have minced.  The hubby loved this recipe and wanted to eat the whole bowl.

This is THE best tuna salad recipe ever.  I usually double the recipe (except for the mayo - I start with the 6 tablespoons then add more mayo after I have mixed it all together to get the texture I want - remember this is for a double recipe so for me 12 tablespoons of mayo is way too much).  The curry powder and the parmesan are magical, and even the sweet relish (which I usually don't care for) are a must.  Try the original recipe before you make any decisions to leave out any ingredients.  You will be very pleasantly surprised!  A big thank you to whoever shared this recipe originally.

Liked the curry and garlic but the relish made it way too sweet. Next time I'll use regular relish and increase the curry.

My go to recipe for tuna salad that I stumbled across last summer and made it for a beach trip for MDW. Ever since, my friend asks me to make this. I have made it for several road trips  served on Hawaiian rolls and recently for a bridal shower and it continues to be a hit. I did tweak it a bit by adding one finely chopped boiled egg and some diced celery.  The curry is such an odd but perfect addition to this delicious salad which tastes better the next day.

Well, I'm really surprised!  I am having a cocktail party soon and want to serve tuna salad as one of the side dishes.  I read the reviews and thought I'd consider making this.  My issue was that I don't care for sweet relish and considered using dill, but I thought...why not try.  So as a test, I tried it with the sweet and I was shocked that it was so delicious.  I used fresh cilantro and dill and about half the mayo.  Both my husband and I really enjoyed it and I definitely will be making it for my party!!  YUM.

Made it! Very good and a nice change in flavors. I did reduce the mayo to 1 rounded TBSP and the sweet relish to 1 TBSP which seemed plenty to me. I really enjoyed it and will make again.

This is a totally excellent salad and easy to make. My only concern when I made it was that it would turn out soupy after sitting in the fridge overnight. My experience with salads like this is to make them a day ahead and let them sit overnight to combine flavors. What I ended up doing was to squeeze the juice out of the relish and to use less mayo. Although this resulted in a drier salad (less creamy), it was perfect for a non messy sandwich.

Swap out dill relish for the sweet relish and this is perfect!  We make it this way for large gatherings on sweet rolls and they always get eaten with many coming back for seconds.

This recipe is truly amazing. I made it this morning and I can honestly say that this tuna salad is even better than most of the tuna salads that you can find in restaurants and stores. One thing that I noticed is that if you don’t like the taste of curry powder or doesn’t want to taste it while eating, just add a little bit less than the amount listed in the recipe, and it will be amazing!!

Just made this and it is fantastic. I "like" tuna salad but usually find it bland. The curry and parm are the real stars and this tuna is elevated to company status.  Can't wait to serve it to my husband as an appetizer tonight.

Made this twice the first time just as written and was great both times; however, I used miracle whip the second time since I don't fancy mayo. I only used about 6 Tbsp when I doubled the recipe. Add however much you like until you get your desired consistency. For example I thought it was good consistency but my brother added more. You can always add more!  I also used minced red onion the second time until I thought there was enough for the amount that I made. I love onions and think it gives more flavor than dried onion flakes. My brother, his wife, and his 7 year old daughter liked it! Thanks for the great recipe.

Making it again.  I remember the first time I made it, it seemed like mayo with a little bit of tuna.

Time to 2/3rds the mayo and see if it's right, plus I might try miracle whip another time to cut down on fat.

I made this as written and it was pretty decent. As with any recipe, it can be personalized. My review is my opinion of how I thought it was as written. :) For me, the relish was overwhelming. I used actual salad dressing (not miracle whip) and I think this was a mistake on my part lol. I would def stick to good ole mayo for this. Otherwise, when left overnight to marinate, it tastes even better there next day. I would make this again and play around with spices etc. Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I added raisins and cut up grapes. I tend to not favor tuna fish but this takes tuna fish to a whole new level.

This was delicious and  easy.  It was great with tuna so I thought I would try it with eggs instead. I did cut the mayo in half and used fresh onions and added some celery as I was using it on a salad,  not as a spread.   I thought it was wonderful as an egg salad.

This is the best tuna I have ever tasted estimation point as I was missing the ingredients together I didn't know what you would end up tasting like. It's sooo  yummy. I use garlic mayo.

OMG! tuna crack. I could sit down and eat a giant bowl of this with a spoon.

A normal sized can of tuna is 4 oz, after you drain out the water, so you need two cans.

I made the recipe as written.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is, it needed salt and pepper and I would use actual chopped onion for more flavor and to give it some texture next time.  Good recipe.

Loved it as written, however here are some things we changed to adjust to our tastes, in case you’d like to try it: dill relish instead of sweet, then half the dill weed and half the parsley, and then add cayenne pepper to taste to give a little punch without overpowering anything

This really is a fantastic tuna salad the dill and curry gives that extra little flavour. I use real onion, add salt and pepper and a bit more more(just my personal preference) make it a few hours or the night before to let the flavours meld together, but it can be eaten right away as well

Off the mother flippin chain. As with any recipe, add salt and pepper to taste. My guess is the 1 star reviewers are culinarily clueless to this fact. Add celery or serve on lettuce for extra crunch. Carbs are sugar and sugar is puhpuhpoison

I’m from the south and this felt more of a northern dish. The curry was WAY overpowering. I think next time I’ll make it with that.

This is a great recipe for tuna sandwich filling.  Made it exactly to recipe, the addition of parm cheese and curry knocks it out of the park.  A keeper for sure.

This is the most delicious version of Tuna Salad I've ever had anywhere bar none!! The only thing I changed was that I added a couple stalks of celery and some diced red onion instead of the dried onions. 
Served it on some toasts Sour Dough and its INSANE flavor overload!! Especially a day or two after you've made it, giving the spices and herbs plenty of time to rehydrate and contribute to the deliciousness. This is now a staple in my recipes for sure.

This is an awesome recipe. I was out of dill and didn’t have sweet relish, but I had dill relish and it came out awesome. I also was short about 25% of the recommended mayonnaise but I had just enough left over sour cream in my fridge I substituted with that and it still was amazing. I like recipes that you can make easy substitutions in a pinch and it’s so good it still comes out awesome. I added some salt and cracked black pepper which I pretty much do to everything. We’re going to be eating it on top of leftover toasted hamburger buns with a slice of cheese on top, and broil it in the oven for tuna melts. Since I’m doing low-carb, I will just eat it on a bed of lettuce with some sliced up cucumbers and avocado.

I liked the change as tuna salad can become so boring.  Only used 1 tbsp sweet pickle relish due to preference.  Used fresh parsley too.

Superb Tuna Salad--
I did not have curry powder but I made my own with Turmeric, toasted coriander, and cumin; I added crushed toasted mustard seeds (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon will be enough)--simply delicious.
I'm eager to try it again using Tahini sauce instead of Mayo.

Had it on toasted English muffins with a slice of fresh tomato (picked fresh from our garden that afternoon) and a side of kale salad (kale also picked that afternoon) with almond slivers and cranberries ... hubby LOVED it!  Me, too.

It could use a little more flavor for my taste but it is good! I think next time that I will try only fresh ingredients and spices instead of dry spices.

I’ve never been a fan of tuna salad until I tried tried this, OMG! The combination of spices makes an ordinary can of tuna turn into a Super Star of flavor! This is best the next day as it lets the spices blend together. Try it, you’ll love it!!!

Different and delicious! The fishy taste of the tuna is made much more mild and creamy. I will be making this for a long time in the future.

The flavor was out of this world. So savory and delicious.  I recommend using less mayo, if you prefer a salad with less sauce. Otherwise this is a great combination of flavor.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 the relish, more onion flakes, and less curry.  I skipped the dill.

Very good flavor and no  fishy taste.  I substituted low-fat plain yogurt for some of the mayo to cut calories.

The liquid content in this is so high you probably want to consider using two cans of tuna or cut the mayo down to 4 tbsp, to be honest.  One can resulted in a soupy pourable tuna salad mix, adding a second can helped.

Very good tuna sandwiches, it made about 3-4 sandwiches, depending on how much tuna people put on their sandwiches.  I did add 1 teaspoon seasoned salt to the mixture just to add a bit more flavor and it really made a good tasting tuna mixture!

This was easily one of the best tuna salad recipes I have ever made. I was so tired of the same old tired tuna salad I had been making forever. I am forever grateful for this recipe. It is easy and tastes wonderful. No tweaks needed. The recipe is perfect as is......

I left a 5 star review already but forgot to add that I but the mayo. My only criticism is that this recipe has too much mayo in proportion to the amount of tuna. If you keep the amount of mayo the same, add another can of tuna or cut amount of mayo in half - to taste. I added diced celery, a teaspoon of Old Bay, diced yellow onions (a tablespoon) a small amount of black pepper & a diced boiled egg (southerner here). I also made a batch w/the Parmesan cheese & one without. Both were great but I prefer it w/o cheese. I’d use the cheese if serving for guests, but this is a matter of preference - it’s great either way.

I'm no tuna connoisseur, but this recipe is pretty awesome. I wouldn't have thought to come up with this combination of ingredients, but it works quite well actually! Every flavor feels like it belongs here. I must confess though that I do alter the recipe slightly from time to time and add a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper to bring a little heat to it. It doesn't need it,  but I enjoy it! The dill weed, curry and parmesan work great together!!

I decided to give this unorthodox recipe a try for lunch at work this week and, while I think it's pretty tasty, I think my search for the perfect tuna salad continues! Cold it was much better. I tried to make a tuna melt yesterday and was pretty underwhelmed with the taste when warm.

Hands-down, one of the best Tuna recipes I have tasted.  On toasted Rye with Provolone cheese this makes a terrific sandwich. I made a single batch, drained the Tuna and the relish well, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It worked for me, and I loved the tangy complex flavor.

Wow, I never think of tuna salad as delicious. but this really is! Outstanding. I was going to make a sandwich but opted to eat it straight out of the bowl instead. I like that this recipe uses stuff I usually have around the house.

I used 1 Tb pickle juice instead of relish, and I added a bit of diced celery for crunch.

I loved this recipe. We  added fresh onion and celery to the recipe for  crunch.  Also, the printed recipe never  says when to add the relish.  We added it with the mayonnaise.  It was delicious.

Yummy! I doubled the ingredients since my tuna can was 12 oz.  I did add chopped scallions for taste and a little crunch-next time I may add celery! Thank you! My adult son had a sandwich and said it was the best tuna salad he had ever had-and he's picky! It gets better the longer the flavors meld.

I found this recipe to be unpalatable. The amount of curry powder called for was too much in relation to the other ingredients. Didn’t care for it and neither did my family. If I ever make this again, I’d omit the curry, parmesan and reduce the amount of mayonnaise.

I prepared the tuna as suggested.  Turned out  well.  I Will definitely make it again. My husband thought I bought it from a deli.  Love the taste of the dill.    My only twirk for “me “  I think “I” will use “fresh cut red onion”next time I make this delicious tuna.
Thanks for sharing.

Wow this is good!  This recipe tweaks a standard prep and makes ever familiar canned tuna interesting again. We all have those “Tuesday night what can I fix?” dilemmas . I foresee a summertime meal of this on a salad or even cold pasta.

I have been a member/frequenter or Allrecipes for over 10 years now. This is the FIRST recipe I have ever rated and reviewed. This is the BEST tuna salad I have ever had! I just finished preparing it 30 minutes ago and my boyfriend and I are trying (unsuccessfully) to leave it alone while it refrigerates. If you are wanting a gold star recipe, look no further! I followed the recipe almost exactly and took a few suggestions from other reviewers. I used solid yellowfin canned tuna and made sure to squeeze of the excess fluid inside. I was very disappointed to see that I had forgotten Parmesan cheese at the store, but thankfully had some quality feta that had aged, and couldn’t even tell the difference (though will make it with Parm next time). I also added a dash of both salt and pepper at the end and stirred it very well. Absolutely divine!

I add in a little celery salt, and skip the cheese. Very good!

I did leave out the curry powder - didn't have it - but the parmesan adds umami.  Really good tuna salad usually has an umami component - parmesan, or anchovy paste, or Worcestershire sauce.  It doesn't take much, but a little of any of the 3 really makes it much tastier.  I add whatever crunchy veg I have - peppers, celery, or cucumbers. Always delicious!

First off I don’t like fish of any kind but I am trying to learn to enjoy it. Secondly the thought of cheese and fishy doesn’t appeal to me. All that aside, this recipe was great!

I liked it a lot. I didn't have dill but it was still very good. I liked the hint of curry and that it wasn't overpowering.

I definitely prefer this as more of an appetizer than a sandwich. It is delicious, but I found it to be a bit rich. That being said, I did make a few changes. 

I automatically added a bit more Parmesan cheese. I also tend to use a lot of Epicure spices when I cook, so I used their Garlic Powder, Lemon Dilly for dill and 3 Onion Mix for the onion powder.  

I found that it should be eaten on an equally flavourful cracker. All I had in the house were saltines and Tostitos Scoops. Both were bland. Maybe try serving it with pumpernickel bread? 

Another modification I made was that instead of relish, I cut up a small garlic pickle. Next time I would add two to three of the same size.

This was delicious!!! I followed advice of other reviewers and used only half of the mayo to cut back on fat. Had no dill on hand so left out. I will never use a different recipe. Thank you!!! The only tuna I had was with jalapeno...nice bite

This is a nice change from using  dill pickles, celery and onions!
The curry and parmesan  cheese with sweet pickle relish is a very nice change! I will be using this new recipe for my tuna salad for a while!

Impeccable medley of ingredients! I used the recipe as a guide rather than exact measurements, but with an ingredients list like this, you can't help but mix up something good. Substitutions: shredded parmesan, dill relish & onion powder. Omissions: curry powder. Additions: finely sliced celery.

This is great tuna salad, but I use less mayo and a bit of Dijon mustard.  I also add a hard boiled egg.  Great recipe - the curry is wonderful with tuna!

Yum, yum, yum!!!! So I tried this recipe and I must say I was a bit skeptical. But when I made and taste this tuna salad all it was missing was a cracker. So I went even further and added elbow noddles and 8 tablespoons of mayonnaise and one last ingredient. When I went to taste it the flavor exploded in my mouth..... And I couldn’t believe it my picky kids liked it.....

I liked the taste of this but it was very green. Next time I will back off on the dried parsley. I used salad dressing so next time I’ll try mayo. The can of tuna I had was a 6 ounce size so I added another can to try and cut down on the parsley. It worked fine to double it.

I ended up making changes based upon some other things I read from chefs out there: 

Omitted the dill and parsley (I didn't have any on hand) 
Used mild cheddar cheese 

Squeeze-drained the can of tuna to get as much fluid out as possible. Mixed ingredients with changes above. Placed heaping scoop on a slice of good quality white bread. Covered with cheddar cheese.  On other slice of bread put a good layer of raw spinach.  Then placed 8-12 bread-and-butter (sweet) pickle slices.  Just trust me on this; it's a game changer.  Carefully put the halves together and then placed in a med-high frying pan with about a teaspoon of butter in it; cooked until toasty brown, then flipped and did the same.  Cut it in half.  

I have to say that I'm in love.

I had printed this recipe off way back in 2/2011 and finally got around to making it today (10/12/2017).  I made exactly as written except I only used 3 Tbsp. mayo--6 Tbsp. seemed like way too much for a 7 oz. can of tuna; figured I could always add more, if needed.  Even after adding the rest of the ingredients, 3 Tbsp. of mayo was sufficient to bind everything together.  I'm not a big fan of curry but the curry was not overpowering.  I used shredded parmesan--not the yellowy powdery stuff that comes in the green can.  I think the cheese could be omitted as it didn't seem to add anything.  Instead, I think this could be prepared like a tuna melt with  a slice of cheese or shredded cheese on top and then stuck under the broiler for a short time.  I will make this again.

I've made this on numerous occasions and there is not one drop of it left at the end. This tuna salad is great on sesame slider rolls.  I find that it tastes better when made the night before and the flavors meld together. I did change the recipe a little - instead of using sweet relish I use tangy dill relish and when it's available I used roasted garlic powder.  This is an absolutely delicious tuna recipe. My husband would eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner if I let him.

Who knew curry would be such a flavor enhancing ingredient.  I followed recipe to the letter.  I may add a tad more onion and reduce mayo a bit.

The day I made this I thought well it is good enough but I have had better. Well the next day I am not so sure.  Spending the night in  the frig seemed to allow everthing to really come together. 
Good recipe and I will be making again.

Made the recipe as written but it was way too much mayo!!!! I think only a third of the mayo in the recipe would be sufficient. And the sweet relish is also very overpowering would probably cut that to 1/4 the amount. Bleh. I think the next time I try this, it's only gonna be just enough mayo to create a dry consistency, a tsp of relish. Not sure what to do with this giant bowl of icky tuna salad now.....

Holy smokes, this IS good! I had a hankering for tuna salad but you know really good tuna salad is a little hard to find, and there is mediocre tuna salad around every corner. But this is some pretty good stuff. 

I didn't deviate very much from the recipe, but I did a little bit. I used 4 tablespoons of mayo instead of 6. 1 and half tablespoons of the parmesan. 1 and half tablespoons of the relish (I don't like sweet pickles in general). 1/4 teaspoon of the onion flakes to punch up the flavor. 

I'm currently munching this right now with some Ritz. Yum.

Excellent!  I make this at least once a week. My husband loves it and so do I. It's easy and quick to make. I didn't make any changes to the recipe either.

I absolutely love this recipe! The curry really takes it to another level. I used a 12 oz can of tuna but still used the same amount of mayo and think there was plenty enough. I have made this a couple of times, with and without the dill weed (ran out) and it is delish both ways. I had this with triscuits and cracked pepper wheat thins and it is so so good. You must try this recipe! I eat regular tuna several times a week and this is a much tastier way to enjoy it.

REALLY GOOD  as other reviews say, I must agree ,,, really good.
I had all ing. and  takes only minutes to put together. I did use a touch less mayonnaise and pickle. I would always double now for tomorrows lunch. I served on a few lettuce leaves with a chickpea salad from another site. Great lunch.

I thought this recipe was just so-so. I am not sure if I will make it again, but if I do, I will definitely use less relish and mayo. I thought the tuna salad was too wet and too sweet.

Four stars bc it needs the crunch of fresh celery hearts & sweet onion & too much salad dressing in this recipe for one 7oz can. Otherwise,  it was a great blend of flavors.  I Doubled the recipe with a large pouch 11 0z of plain tuna and  a 7 Oz pouch of lemon pepper tuna. Added  two chopped HB eggs salted &  peppered them. 1/4 cup chopped sweet onion & 2   chopped stalks of celery hearts. Two heaping tablespoons of Miracle whip & two Tbs of Hellmans  mayo.  6 TBS of grated Parmesan cheese.  2 tsps of dill, 6  heaping Tbs of 
 vlassic sweet relish, 1/2 tsp of curry powder,  black pepper, 1/2 tsp of parsley flakes..it was fantastic..served on a croissant with thin sliced baby swiss..so many compliments

If you like tuna salad, you need to try this. It puts tuna, mayo, and celery to shame. I'm not sure I can ever go back to boring tuna now. Don't be deterred by the curry powder either. I'm not typically a fan of it, but it is not overpowering, and gives it an extra taste. Don't skip the relish either, totally makes the dish.

I like this. No chopping! And it's delicious. I was out of sweet relish. So I substituted the same amount of dill relish and added about a teaspoon of sugar. I think it's even better - more interesting- this way.

Best tuna ever. I'm not a fan of mayo or very wet tuna, so I used about 4 tbsp for 10 oz of tuna. I also didn't have dill weed.

One of the best tuna salads I've ever had! I've made it following the recipe, and also with feta cheese instead of Parmesan.  It's definitely better with Parmesan but feta cheese was a good substitution.  It's even great with no cheese, if you're trying to stay away from dairy.

This was so very good.  I did not have sweet pickles but i did have some Harry and David  pepper and onion relish, so i used 1 1/2 teaspoons .  I did not add the  onion flakes.  I added celery  and a egg, just because i am use to having it in my tuna.  I would have never guessed  that curry, garlic and dill would add so much flavor.  Yummmmmy!!!!

I started with 2 tbsp of mayo which was plenty. Other than that, this is a nice change to plain old tuna salad.
And DONT be afraid of the curry (although I didn't use as much as called for),  it gives it a nice taste

It's an interesting recipe, but I can't palate how these ingredients could replace the cool, crisp freshness of things like real chopped pickle, red onion, celery, garlic, lemon etc - especially when you're serving this dish as a (fancy) salad. I thought this recipe masked the tuna instead of highlighting it.

This was a very nice change from Grandma's  Tuna, egg, celery, onion and mayo recipe.   I followed the recipe and "listened" to the "too much mayo" comments.   Made as written, but only added 1/2 the amount of mayo.  Let the recipe sit, in refrigerator, for about 1/2 hour.   Put mayo on table and added a bit more to taste.   Thank you, really enjoyed this change.

I made this and I must say, it is so good.  I was a little concerned about the curry and parmesan but it really is so good in this tuna salad.  I followed the recipe almost to the letter, but I added diced red onions instead of using minced onion flakes.  I love the red onions in this because it adds a little crunch and I also added a pinch of black pepper.   Not major changes so you can really follow the recipe exactly how it is to get great results.  I love it and will probably never make it any different now that I've tasted it.  Thanks for sharing!

I must say, this is THE best tuna salad sandwich I've ever had, and I'm in my 70's.   I will never fix it any other way.   Although I did drain the albacore tuna well,  I felt 3 Tbls of mayo was plenty and moistened it nicely.  Thank you so much, Barbie, for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I have made this four times now in just barely two weeks and it is the best Tuna salad recipes I have found. I love the hint of curry.  I do add more sweet relish than called for and I have reduced the parsley to one Tsp.

I use this recipe basically as a template. I use most of the ingredients more or less. Lots more curry. I don't see much point in parsley so I subbed tarragon. There's never any left over. I've even put it in a grilled cheese sandwich. (Don't hate me)

This is a really good recipe for Tuna Salad. I was skeptical about the different flavors meshing, but they actually taste great together. I rated it 4 stars because it was way too much mayo. I should've listened to the other reviewers.

This has a different taste than my regular tuna salad but I loved it for that.  The curry powder gives it a nice depth.  Needs to be fully drained or you'll end up with soggy tuna.  Used Duke's mayo (only kind naturally) and dill relish.  Added salt at end - really nice.

I really like the combination of ingredients  in this recipe! That being said, the first time I made it , it ended up as a tuna salad soup... tasted great but way too wet to even think about trying to make a sandwich. I made it again this morning and this time strained the tuna and then squeezed it n paper towels to get out as much moisture as possible. I tried to remove some juice from the relish too. It STILL ended up way too wet to make a sandwich . Maybe if I put it in the fridge for a while? Anyway - I cook like an engineer and, according to my wife,  am way too meticulous about following recipes, so I am pretty sure I did not screw up. Next time will drastically cut back on the mayo and will probably strain the relish as well. :)

I am SHOCKED that tuna salad can be this delicious.....I had no idea! It's the only way I will make it from now on.  Only changes I made was using vegan mayo and not using any Parmesan or pickle.  Since my tuna can was a 4 oz I halved every spice except the minced onion which I kept as written.  I had it over raw spinach leaves....Phenomenal dish thank you for sharing!

Fabulous!  This is the best tuna salad I have ever tasted.  I use albacore, and I am lazing about measuring ingredients.  I use Hellman's mayo and just add it until it feels right.  I always drain my tuna as dry as possible.  I do add fresh onion and celery because I like a little crunch to my tuna salad.  The curry and parmesan cheese really make this dish.

I was looking for a different tuna salad recipe.  Initially hesitant about this recipe, due to the parmesan cheese (I have an aversion to mixing cheese with fish), but decided to try it since it had so many good reviews.
I am glad I did!
The flavors mixed well; it's still a good basic recipe, but with more complex flavors.
I did make some changes, though:
1. I added a can of slightly smashed chickpeas, for texture and to stretch the dish.
2. I added celery, b/c I always do.
3. I added a chopped pickled egg (I bought a jar to try and no one really liked the texture, so I figured I could sneak it in, lol). The egg was slightly spicy and it still tasted good.
4. I used powdered onion. I would have liked to add chopped green onion but I did not have any.
5. I did not have any dill, but the eggs and pickles I used had enough dill flavor, IMO.

Very good!
Definitely a change from the average tuna salad, but still pretty easy!

PS- I decided to add chopped cilantro to this dish b/c I really like having something green in my tuna salad.  It added a nice fresh flavor and paired well with the curry.  Yum!

LOVE the addition of finely grated parm cheese!  I like my tuna salad with texture so I thew in chopped celery and chopped carrots.  I also replaced the onion with finely chopped shallots for a more nuanced flavor, and used fresh garlic juice not powder.  For the best secret of all:  I added pineapple juice, not lemon juice -- it taste incredible with any kind of tuna recipe.

Loved it, but I made the following changes. I didn't have pickle relish so I used dill pickle juice mixed with a little chutney (pairs well with the curry powder). I also added a little thinly sliced celery, a chopped hardboiled egg, and a tablespoon of rinsed capers. The latter additions were simply because I like a chunkier tuna salad; otherwise the tuna salad is more like a sandwich spread. I planned on serving this on a bed of lettuce. This is a really delicious blend of ingredients.

This was a tasty flavor profile.  The recipe as it is makes for a wet salad.  I'm not a fan of mushy wet so I added a can of cannalini beans to it.  They made a great addition..  I won't deduct a star rating for that.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Even without the curry--which I know is a major component, but we were out--this tuna salad is delicious. I just ate two whole wheat tortilla wraps filled with it. Ordering curry today so that next time, I can try it as intended! 

Used Miracle Whip Light (I don't really do mayo) and four 2.5-oz. tuna packets (yes, I know that's 10 ounces of tuna), and followed the recipe as posted, except (as noted) for the curry powder.

This is so delicious because it has the perfect amount of sweetness. Not too much and not too little. I used about 4 tablespoons of tuna and 2 tablespoons of relish.  This is how tuna salad is suppose to taste. I love mine on a wrap!

My new favorite tuna salad. The curry adds a subtle flavor that distinguishes  this recipe from the others. I made it using 2 cans of Albacore tuna of 4 oz each and fresh parsley for dried. Also, cut down the sweet relish to 2 Tablespoons.

Been making Barbie's tuna for several years and we all love it (especially the non tuna eating hubby)! I used to follow it exactly as is but over time transitioned to 1/2 mayo 1/2 plain Greek yogurt and now to all Greek yogurt without any mayo. Thank you for the delicious recipe!!

OMG! Hubby and I just got back from eating our way through NOLA a few weeks ago.  We had the BBQ shrimp at Deanie's in the French Quarter.  Truly a fantastic and memorable dish unlike anything we had ever had. And we eat fresh seafood often.  I couldn't forget the delicious dish and was so very pleased to find out that this dish is equally as delicious.  Can't believe how easy it is.  Will make it often!

Excellent! I left out the parsley and dill weed because I didn't have any on hand. I used chopped dill pickles instead. I added extra parmesan and some real bacon bits. Served with Wheat Thins veggie flavor toasted chips. Yummy!

Awesome, so different than my normal boring tuna salad.  Didn't have the curry on hand, it's on my shopping list.  It was great without it, can't wait until I make it with the curry. Thanks

This recipe was perfect a great twist on the tired recipe. My daughter and I enjoyed it very much! My tuna had a lot of water in it that I could not drain out successfully so I had to add an extra can of tuna to the recipe because it was very watery.

Made this one for several years now. It's my 11 year olds favorite tuna. We use on white bread for sandwiches and different flavors of Triscuits as a topper. I use red onion diced up very tiny rather than minced containered stuff. It's our favorite.

I finally wrote this recipe down today so I could stop searching for it. It's the best "fake" tofu recipe I've ever made. I say "fake" becuase I double everything and add a 14oz block of tofu instead of the tuna. My husband (non vegetarian) requests this multiple times a month! We eat it all in 2 days easy. What I do:  take a 14oz block of tofu and place on a cloth napkin, fold napkin around tofu and massage it while you ring it. This breaks the tofu up and drains the water. Then make the reat exactly like Barbra says leaving out the tuna.

I didn't have sweet relish so I chopped up some dill pickles.   I also added the zest of half a lemon.  I also used fresh chopped red onion instead of dried.  I squeezed by hand the drained tuna: I had a mix of solid white and chunk light.  I added olive oil mayo to my own taste. Otherwise, I made the recipe as directed. It does taste best if you leave it in the fridge at least a few hours.  I made 2 sandwiches. Toasted the bread, adding Swiss cheese and thinly sliced Campari tomatoes.  I used Ezekiel sprouted grain bread.

Substitutions I made because it is what I have on hand.
Low Fat (1%) Cottage Cheese that I put in my mini chopper until smooth,  for the Greek yogurt and mayo. This saved on fat and calories.

Dill relish for sweet relish

For a less saucy salad I used two 5oz cans water packed tuna.

We used hot dog buns.  Because I haven't been to the grocery store.
My husband was skeptical, but his response after his first bite....Mmmmm that is good!
This is a keeper.

I've made this a lot over the years.  My favourite combinations.  
I also love to make it with mashed up chickpeas instead of tuna to make it vegetarian and when I feel like going vegan, I use vegan mayo.   
Always a hit and it always gets devoured.
Hit it with some mustard on top. Yum.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe, and I'm so glad I did. I wanted something different than the usual tuna salad recipes with just pickle relish in it or celery & onion. This was "killer"! I made it for a home products party, men and women in attendance, I was having and served it in mini croissants. I received compliments on how good it was, so a big TY for sharing it. I gave credit where credit was due and shared the recipe.  I had a 12 oz.  can of solid white tuna that I used and I added tablespoons of mayo till I got it the consistency I liked. I ended up using 4 Tbs. so it wasn't too wet. Everything else was measured as written. Would I make this again? Tomorrow too soon? Love the curry in it!

This is now my go-to recipe for tuna salad. Love the dill. I think people aren't paying attention to the size of canned tuna they are using, if you use the correct amount, it doesn't not come out watery.

Barbie's Tuna Salad Haiku: "Three cheers for Barbie. Five stars for her recipe. I loved this tuna!" Made this tuna salad as written, except I used the pickle juice floating in the bottom of my lonely jar of pickles instead of the relish that I didn't have. I had mine "naked" in a lettuce boat whereas husband made his into a tuna melt w/ American cheese and tomato on marble rye. Sure his sandwich was awesome, but the tuna was tasty enough all on its own w/o all that accompaniment.

I made this for supper and it is to die for!  I'm not much on tuna salad until I had this version. It's delicious. I had it on Ritz crackers and it's fantastic. I was a little leery of the curry, but that gave it a little kick and it was just great!

Fantastic flavor!  Reduced mayo to 4 TBSP and increased tuna to 12 oz.  Omitted dill as I have none.

I keep coming back to this, sometimes adding 1 diced stalk of celery and 1 hard boiled egg.  Serve with sriracha on bun!

I've just made my second round of this tuna recipe, and the only thing I did differently was add less mayo. I quadrupled the recipe and simply ran out, but it was still fantastic! It's absolutely delicious. My husband and I really enjoy tuna salad, and I haven't found a recipe that we both like. Well, we now found it. This second time I'm making it, he asked if I could put hard boiled eggs in it like he likes, so I'll try it. I'm a little concerned because I don't want to stray from this magic. All the spices and cheese just really make this extra special tasting. I'm not big on a lot of mayo in my tuna salad, so I'll go less this time, too. A+!

Really like this version of Tuna salad.  The curry and Parmesan make it just a bit different than the normal Tuna salad. Addicting.

Excellent.  I used skipjack tuna because it was what we had and added some celery and white pepper.  Delicious!  My husband wants to try it with dill relish but I like the sweet.

We are working on low carb so we left the relish out and rather than bread or crackers used kosher dill pickle slices to make little sandwiches! Phenomenal!

Absolutely wonderful! You cannot taste the curry so please don't let that stop anyone from making this! What a great flavor! When I was a kid we used to buy this yummy tuna salad kit and this reminds me of it.  My kids demolished it today so I will have to make more! Great on toast!

I love this recipe, doesn't taste like tuna... it tastes so much better.  Perfect on a toasted bagel.  I generally make it as stated sans parsley, using slightly rounded measurements.

To me canned tuna has a very mild taste on it's own and adding a lot of ingredients takes away from that. I used more mayonnaise and left out the pickle relish. Don't care for it. Added more celery and used a bit of green onion which is milder than regular onion.  I only used a dash of curry powder and Parmesan.

he recipe produced a perfect consistency. I followed the recipe except for two ingredients. I doubled the curry and Parmesan cheese amounts.
Hindsight, I'd say increase the onion quantity too and use fresh mined garlic instead of garlic powder and use some celery salt.

I love tuna sandwiches, and it was great to be able to switch up the flavors. I but back the mayonnaise to 4tbsp and used red onion diced in place of flakes. Served it in a lettuce wrap with some diced tomatoes.

Not being a huge fan of fishy things, I've been trying to at least tolerate tuna for the health benefits. I really enjoyed the taste of this!  I didn't have curry, but can't wait to get some and try it next time I make it.  I followed the recipe above, but ended up adding green/red peppers and finely diced carrot for color to get rid of some things I had on had, oh and a little Stevia and Chia seeds.  I will make this again!

This is SO yummy that it has become my standard recipe  for tuna salad, though often I don't have all the ingredients on hand. It tastes great to me without the parmesan, parsley or dill weed so long as I have the other items in stock.

This is the best tuna salad I have ever made! I wouldn't have put dill and and parsley in tuna before but I will now! In my way of looking at it everything was too much except tuna so I just doubled the tuna after tasting it. After doubling the tuna it was perfect! I would have given it five stares except that I had to double the tuna to make it not too soupy and to be able to taste the tuna!

I made this recipe to use as filling for some lettuce wraps, and they were super delicious! It was also excellent on some toasted lavosh bread from Trader Joe's. I made two  adjustments to the recipe, as written:  I chopped up about 1/3 cup of  broccoli/carrot shreds I had in the fridge (totally unnecessary, but added a welcome crunch), and I used white bean humus as a (much, much) lower calorie substitute for the mayonnaise. I will definitely make this recipe again. The odd combination of spices turned out to be a real treat.

This is really good and the perfect recipe for tuna salad for tuna melts!!! Also great on crackers. It's great immediately after making, but we have no idea what it tastes like after the flavors meld together, because we ate it all!!!  I do not like sweet relish AT ALL, but I made the recipe as directed but only put in a table spoon at a time.  We decided 2 tablespoons was perfect!!

My family all enjoyed this recipe.  I used chunk light tuna and dill pickle relish.  ( I can't stand sweet relish. Ugh!)  The curry, dill, and parsley blended beautifully and provided great enhancement to the tuna.  I will make this again.

Absolutely loved it and so did my wife. Made it for a snack and for lunches the next day. Plan to make a whole bunch for our upcoming roadtrip (15 hours). =)

For me, reduce the mayo to 3 to 4.5 tbsp.  Then this is simply the El Dorado of tuna salads.  I can't even fathom improving upon it.  I even normally think that cheese and fish absolutely do not go together, and this is a major exception to that rule.  After all, only a little bit of parmesan goes in.  Trust me, it works.

This is my go to tuna salad recipe, I've never tasted anything like it. My 9-year old son LOVES it, as does everyone else we know. Admittedly, I was apprehensive about the curry and parsley the first time I made it, but even my mother, who doesn't like "much spice", raves about it.

Made as directed.  We just thought the curry taste was too strong.  Easy to make.  I may try again without it.

Super yummy!  I doubled the recipe but didn't double the  the dill weed or the mayo - and then ended up putting some mayo on the bread in the end.  Used english muffin bread (toasted).  Husband thought it was awesome and was practically licking the plate.  The cat drove me crazy while I was making it but it was worth it.

I really liked this tuna salad recipe.  I only added a few things.  I added two chopped up hard boiled eggs, 1/2 tablespoon of mayo and a pinch of salt.  This turned out super flavorful and delicious!!  I especially like the flavor of dill and the curry. Yum!

I would definitely make this again.

Really delicious! I had already added a ranch dressing, 1/2 chopped celery and some chopped red onions before finding this recipe. The ingredients just made it more delicious. Everyone loved it. Great on crackers and celery for an extra crunch. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I added a ripe avocado and a tiny bit of Frank's Hot Sauce.  I was not expecting the tuna salad to be so flavorful.  The curry, dill and sweet relish compliment each other  so well.  Definitely will make again and again!

Really good and this is coming from someone that hates tuna in a can and tuna salad.  I didn't have dill and used fresh parsley.  Also, I added thinly sliced celery and Carrots for color and texture.  The wife loved it.  We will have it again.

I altered the quantities a bit and it is still fantastic. Love it. Cannot wait to hear Mr. Man's response. Feeling positive this will become his favorite tuna salad. 

I really want to make it with grilled ahi and serve title over a bed of spring greens. Yummmmm. Thanks!

Made this with the following substitutions: yogurt for the mayonnaise; finely chopped onions for the onion flakes since I just don't keep that on hand; finely chopped dill pickles for the sweet relish since we don't care for sweet pickles. I'm certain it would be fantastic without my substitutions. My husband said it was much better than a deli sandwich. I think its great too! Thank you for the awesome recipe.

This was excellenct.  I made this essentially as is.  I omitted the relish though since I did not have any and I am not a fan of relish.  I used leftover tuna steaks that were grilled the night before and lite miracle whip for the dressing.  I wasn't exact with my measurements, just eyed it and adjusted to taste.

Looking for a cheap, healthy, good recipe?  This is a go- to. Plus, you're likely to have all these ingredients on hand even when the fridge is looking bare. I imagine I could incorporate lettuce, chopped celery, grapes, nuts, onions, or black olives if I was looking for more veggies.

The flavor was wonderful but the consistency was too wet and runny. I did drain the tuna, but too much mayo made it too wet for sandwiches.  I will use less next time.

Use of the dried herbs made the mixture a bit too crunchy for my taste, that is, until it sat in the refrigerator overnight and was able to absorb some of the moisture from the mayonnaise. I suspect that the recipe would be vastly improved by using fresh ingredients rather than the dried versions. The flavors were interesting (especially the curry), but I've had a lot of tuna salad recipes that I prefer. IMHO it was just OK.

Made curious by the popularity of this recipe I gave it a try and I enjoyed it very much, the taste is distinct and addictive. I made these subs - fresh dill, parsley instead of dry and green onions instead of dried flakes. Great recipe, will make it again.

LOVE  this recipe.
I add finely chopped celery, slivered almonds, and sometimes some finely chopped fresh onion and a bit of coarse ground pepper.
It's great "as is" but I enjoy more crunch. I use less mayo- just enough to get it to mix well, hold together, blend the seasonings.

I am still not sure about this recipe.  The relish and curry combination gave it an odd but curious flavor.  I suggest giving it a try truly unique.

So delicious! For a more healthy option, I used light white tuna and only 1 tablespoon of light miracle whip. I used only 1 tablespoon of the relish as I didn't want it to overpower the flavor. The curry added a nice touch! Will definitely be in the rotation for the future!

I have made this several times now and I can't stop raving about it. I used fresh onion, left out the relish and added black pepper. One sandwich is never enough.

I knew this was going to be good based on the ingredient list. Gravel would be delicious with mayonnaise, garlic, dill and curry; but substitute tuna instead and you've got a spread that makes your taste buds salute.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This definitely isn't for a tuna sandwich type meal.  It makes a fantastic dip served with various crackers.  it beats other usual appetizers by a mile!

My husband said this is the best tuna salad he's ever had. Took it to work for lunch 2 days in a row, which never happens. I left out the dill because I didn't have any, but I'm sure that would make it even better. Def a keeper recipe.

Tweaked just a little, subbed onion flakes for scallions and added a chopped boiled egg.  Fooled my boyfriend who "hates tuna".  The thought it was chicken salad and loved it.  Yes I did tell him afterward.  Truly unique and very good

I made it to the T but used Miracle Whip, My only issue would be too much relish and too much MW, Next time it will be 5 tbs of MW and 2 tbs relish but I HIGHLY recommend this to people who enjoy tuna salad. Also if you blend it in a Ninja or similar blender it comes out great for a cracker dip!

I made this for lunch today and it was amazing! Loved it! The only things I changed were 2 1/2 tables spoons of mayo, Cumin, 2 dill pickles diced up. I didn't have Curry or sweet pickles. I was really surprise by how well all the spices blended together!

This recipe is fantastic! I left out the curry power and the parsley because I don't care for either flavor. I also used the full amount of tuna but I cut everything else in half and that was more than enough miracle whip (which I used instead of mayo). I loved how it turned out there. Will be using this recipe for tuna salad from now on!

It's a good thing I put in about half as much of the spices, otherwise the curry taste would have been overwhelming, and the parsley would have turned the tuna fish green. I will agree with the cook that it was unique tasting. My husband said he would have preferred dill pickles, and it had an odd flavor and smell (the curry mostly), although he ate it. I think he didn't want to waste it. My daughter (20 yrs. old) and I liked it okay as something different, but I don't think I will make again. We love our tuna salad with fresh chopped onion, chopped dill pickles, and salad dressing--simple and always good.

So if you are here, then you were like me, in a desperate search to find the best ever tuna salad recipe! Well.... Tried this and it is NOT it!  I finally found it, took 20 years, so I came back here to give you all my report and share the recipe. I do not have it posted, because I don't ever post recipes, but it is as follows:  WORLDS BEST TUNA FISH SANDWICH!  2 cans (5 oz) drained solid white tuna fish, 2 cans (5 oz) drained light tuna fish, 1/3 cup of mayo (or more to taste), 1 heaping Tbsp. sweet relish, 1 heaping tsp. Dijon mustard, 2 Tbsp. Chopped celery (optional), 1 heaping Tbsp. minced onion ( optional), kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Blend well then evenly spread over four slices whole wheat bread, top with lettuce & tomato, if desired, then top each sandwich with another slice of bread. Enjoy!

I have a RUNNER UP recipe that comes from a Whole Foods deli clerk! APPLE CRANBERRY TUNA SALAD! Chunk light tuna, mayo with canola oil, diced celery, diced apple, dried cranberries, chopped walnuts, diced red onions, lemon or orange juice, salt, pepper, parsley, garlic powder, dill. You figure out the ratio's.... it's not that hard! And YES, always drain your can of tuna!!  I use Granny Smith apple but you can use a sweeter one. Taste great with the green though! If I ever use red then I sub the cranberries with green seedless grapes!  I am only giving this awful recipe above five stars,, so that my feedback will go up top so you people can read it!

Wow! Don't change a single thing! It's perfect! I thought (before making it) that I might want to add celery since that's how I've always made mine and thought I'd miss that crunch, but you don't need it. This is an awesome recipe and I'm so glad I found it - new "go-to!"

I really like this recipe, but with a few adjustments. I hate sweet pickles, so I substituted for dill, and added a bit more than the recipe called for because I use two 8oz cans of tuna in water. I also finely chopped or minced fresh onion instead of the onion flakes, again adding a bit more, about 1-2 tablespoons.  I add extra mayo as needed to compensate for the extra can of tuna. Very good on croissant rolls over a bed of fresh spinach. For party's I put on mini croissants that you can get at Walmart, and it is a big hit! 
Thanks for the recipe!

Full Disclosure:  I gag at the thought of sweet pickle relish.  I ate 1/2 tsp just to adjust ingredients.  With that being said, the family loved it!  Our regular tuna is savory but this was a big hit.  I used half the mayo instead of miracle whip because I didn't want it to be too sweet, used half the dill, doubled the onion and added garlic to taste.  I also added 1/2 tbsp of sweet pickle relish juice.  I let it marry over night and they were wowed at lunch.

I loathe tuna salad but decided one night when I was starving for some protein to give a flavorful recipe a shot. I used the light tuna in water, a tbl of mayo, some sriracha mayo, fresh white onion, parmesan, dill, mild curry powder, garlic powder and chopped up dill pickles. It was delicious!  So good and I will now be going through tuna like crazy. Yum

Tasty tuna salad, the dill is very noticeable in the tuna salad, but it works for me.  Other tuna salads taste bland in comparison.

Hands down AWESOME!!!! I didn't have any curry powder so I used paprika. Next time I will use 5 instead of 6 tablespoons of mayo. Was a bit "wet" for my liking but it was still good and full of flavor! I will def make this again!!!!

I love this recipe! I have tried with smoked salmon (hardwood smoked salmon from SAMs club).  I use an entire 10 ounce package. You have to spread it on a cracker with a knife. It is a whopping hit at our house.!

Yum!  The first time we made it, it was great.  The next time we omitted the dried onion and parsley and added boiled eggs, red onion, celery, brown mustard and a dash of celery salt and it's our new go-to for tuna salad! Thanks Barbie!  The curry adds a nice touch.

This may quite possibly be the best tuna salad I've ever made. I do recommend using less mayo though, as 6 tbsp was much too wet for my personal liking. I followed everything else exactly as written. I really enjoyed the hint of curry and dill, which I've never seen before in tuna salad. Don't skip the curry!

The only part of the recipe I did not care for was the amount of mayo. I cut it down to 2 tablespoons. The curry was awesome. By the way, the dill complimented the recipe well.

Loved this version - curry is perfect. Added a bit of diced cucumber and red onion then threw it together with fusilli for the best tuna pasta salad I have ever had. Also omitted the relish all together and cut the mayo in half - makes a drier pasta salad. Thanks Tanaquil for sharing!

We love this recipe!  We have made it several times this summer and my 9-year-old picky-eater just requested I make this for her lunch when school starts.  I omit the curry, and eyeball the measurements on everything else and it is fantastic every single time!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I absolutely loved it. I read the negative reviews and see the soupy comments and all I can say is they need to measure more carefully or drain the tuna better. I did double the dried onion. I didn't have sweet relish so I used regular relish with a teaspoon of sugar. I used salad dressing not mayo. I upped the servings to 8 and used the large 12 ounce size can of water packed tuna and squeezed ALL the water out. I made it before bed and ate some then next day. Great recipe!

I'll be the first to admit, I tend to doctor recipes when I make them. I made a double batch and used 8T mayo and 4T relish, so 2/3 what the recipe called for. I figured if need be I could add more, but it was exactly to my liking. Like other reviewers, I used fresh onion and added a little more than a pinch of garlic. It was fantastic. The curry is a great touch.

Excellent! The only change I made was to follow the recipe as written. ;-) It's fantastic. I might try dill salad cubes next time to mix it up, but this was a winner as-is.

It is sooooo good! I don't like dill and didn't have curry... But it still turned out great. I did use miracle whip because I really don't like mayo... awesome recipe!

Loved it. Since my hubby doesn't like curry, I wonder if you could use cumin instead. But, I loved it. I was standing in a deli looking at tuna salad and thought. "I can make this myself at home. Why am I paying for it?" And so....I did make it. Thank you Barbie.

I have always loved tuna salad, and wanted to find a good variation on the original recipe I have. I LOVED this recipe! I had all the ingredients on hand & quick preparation.
I used a lot less mayo (about 2 TBL), finely chopped onion instead of flakes, and finely chopped sweet gherkins instead of relish. It turned out wonderful, and I plan on doubling the recipe next time.
This is my new favorite tuna salad recipe and can't wait to share with my sister and mom.

This recipe is awesome!  I used Miracle Whip and then sprinkled chopped pecans on the sandwich. I ate that one, then went directly back to the kitchen and ate another one.  The mix of ingredients might seem strange, but oh, is this ever good!!  Try it.

I doubled all the ingredients.  I really enjoyed it. I'm sure my family will enjoy it on our trip to Harper's Ferry. I put it in the fridge. In the morning I'll dice some pickles and add, just to give it some crunch. :-)

Wow, was this delicious. Put it on lightly toasted croissant and topped with some kettle cooked BBQ chips for some crunch. I don't really like tuna all that much but all the flavor in this recipe has changed my mind.

5/14: i doubled the recipe, but didn't really follow too closely.  i used 6 tblsp of mayo which was perfect, some cut up celery, good, hot dog relish didn't have hamburger  and it was ok. not as much as they said though, i chickened out on the curry, maybe next time add it.  i did add the cheese though, that was good.'

Made this with Helman's low fat mayo.  I did not have sweet relish so I chopped sweet gherkins and cut away a little mayo and added a bit of gherkin juice to moisten.  Super good.  I was skeptical of the curry but it works great with dill and the gherkins (sweet relish)

This was a very tasty recipe! It is exactly what you imagine when you want a tuna fish sandwich! The texture is great, not too much mayo, no hard boiling eggs...this recipe is perfection. I did however substitute the sweet pickle relish for celery and didn't add the dried dill weed at all. Delicious sandwich, would highly recommend!

WONDERFUL change from my norm that consists only of tuna, mayo, pickles, boiled eggs, and pepper. I used 2 5oz cans albacore tuna (drained very well), 3 Tbsp mayo w/ olive oil, 2 Tbsp sweet relish, and just a few dashes of each spice. Also added a couple chopped boiled eggs and a few dashes paprika. Great combination! Served on Melba toast. Note: I didn't know whether to use grated or shredded Parmesan cheese so I decided not to add it at all, which helped out with the calorie/fat count too! I will forever use this as a base. AWESOME recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was delish! I also tweaked it a bit. I used 2 5oz cans of albacore white tuna in water, along with a 5 oz can of crab meat. Then I mixed all the ingredients together before I added the mayo. And instead of dried onion flakes, fresh onion did the trick. With all of tuna mixture, I don't think I used 6 Tbs of mayo. Just enough to bring it all together and not leave it dry. I then layered fresh zucchini in a flour tortilla wrap, and topped it with the tuna salad, closed and enjoyed! Very tasty

I'd have to say I am not a Tuna Fish fan at all I keep retrying it. And this is about the closest to coming to saying I like it.. This is a very good recipe, I didn't have everything used onion powder instead of flakes and didn't have the curry but this was really nice.

This is the best tuna salad mixture ever!  I use it for my husbands lunches and as a dip for everything from crackers to fresh veggie sticks.  I add more relish to my recipe.

Fed-up with tuna, so went on this site.  MANY thanks for a completely new take on this.  Reduced the mayonnaise for health reasons: otherwise changed nothing (you star!!!!)

I didn't have all the ingredients (college student), but it turned out great!!  I substituted cayenne and cumin for curry.  I also did not have dill weed or parmesan cheese, but the other ingredients still packed a punch of flavor.  If I had to change anything, I would reduce the amount of mayo by a tablespoon or two.  Other then that, DELICIOUS and I will definitely make again.

I love tuna fish and this was a nice spin on an old favorite. I've now made this recipe a couple of times and I double up on the curry because I love the flavor that it adds. I use fresh onion to taste mainly because I didn't have any onion flakes the first time, but then I found I preferred the minced raw onion. I used a bit more then a pinch of garlic and I also didn't use as much mayo because it was just to soupy. Everything else I kept the same. This recipe is great because all of the flavors work together brilliantly and you can adjust it to your taste. It taste even better the next day when all the flavors have really had a chance to marrying.

I was a little let down. I mean it taste good, but it doesn't really taste much different then my usual tuna salad which only consist of tuna, sweet relish, mayo and maybe a little salt and pepper. I couldn't really taste to much of the other ingredients, maybe just a little of the parsley, but everything else just kind of got lost. Would I make this again? Maybe, for company, just to seem fancy :) But for myself and my kid I think the usual sweet relish, mayo, tuna recipe will work just fine and is all the more easier.

I made this recipe once and followed the instructions.  It was amazing!  I tried it a second time just now with a bit of Miracle Whip and it just didn't have the same great taste.  Next time I'll avoid the Miracle Whip!

We all love tuna salad and this is the best tuna salad or sandwich filling I've ever tasted! The family loves it :)!
It's best if made at least the night before (kept very cold in the frig of course).  As a matter of face, I make quadruple recipes of this on Sunday evening and the whole family happily has tuna sandwiches M - F.
The flavor gets better every day.

The curry really sets this recipe off from other tuna salads. I use miracle whip instead of mayo. I almost never buy tuna salad anywhere else after making this because I know with this recipe I can make it better!

This recipe had a little too much sweet relish for our liking.  I'd recommend splitting the amount between dill and sweet.

I'm painfully new at cooking so the idea of all those spices was a little intimidating. I put all the ingredients in (making sure to add mayo as needed instead of just a 6 tablespoon glop) and then tasted. I found it tasted a bit off, so I added more of certain spices and added salt and pepper, then tasted again. It still tasted a bit off but I'm thinking it's the parmesan that I'm finding not to my liking (I also followed a suggestion and added more parm so maybe that was a mistake). I added a lot more garlic powder (a pinch?? I'm not a vampire!) and some fish seasoning which gave it a nice aftertaste. I will definitely try it again without the parmesan though, see what that's like. Thanks!

This tuna salad has great flavor. However, the recipe calls for too much mayo (and I'm a girl who loooooves mayo)...it was almost a soup and I used 10oz. of tuna. Scale it back to 3 or 4 tablespoons and it would be perfect.

This was really good!  I used 10 ounces drained tuna and added a little extra of everything.  No curry so I used Chili Garlic Sauce for the kick and an ounce or two of shredded mozzarella!  WOW!!  Will make again!!!

I have made this at least half a dozen times since I saw it.  It is the only tuna salad I make now.  Excellent flavor.  It is a real go-to when I want something in a hurry.  This is now a real favorite of mine.

I can't imagine not likeing this recipe.  Thank you for sharing it.

So yummy!  I used half the dill because a few other people mentioned that they thought it was too much.  Also I didn't have the pickle relish so I left it out.  This turned out great!

way too liquidy, and all the different spices became cumbersome to measure and use.  The taste was different, and I would like it at a party (where I would just have a taste), but would not like to eat it as a staple at home.

This tuna salad had a strange taste to it, probably because of the unnecessary use of curry powder. My boyfriend hated it and I didn't care for it much myself. The only reason it got eaten is because my dad will eat anything.

Great recipe! Made it exactly to the recipe and it was great.  Ended up adding a finely diced boiled egg, just isn't tuna salad without an egg. But it's amazingly either way!

Really good tuna salad! Different from just plain old tuna and mayo! I didn't have any sweet relish, but I can't wait to try it with it as I'm sure this will only add to the flavor.

Low on groceries and needed to find an easy lunch with tuna. I didn't want the same old tuna salad. I made this as is, just as the recipe stated, no changes (oh, except I used chunk light tuna instead of albacore).... LOVED IT!!! My kids gobbled it up as well and my husband said it was the best tuna salad he has had. We ate it with ritz crackers. YUMMY!!! Loved the curry flavor with the dill. It would probably be even better chilled for an hour or so, we ate it right away. Definitely a keeper. Would taste impressive served at a party, baby shower, lunch, etc.

I was curious to make this recipe because it seemed a little unconventional.  I thought the final product was interesting but not fantastic.  The curry gives a subtle pop of flavor that I really liked.  However, there was just way too much mayo, dill and relish.  The taste of these 3 ingredients overpowered the entire dish. Personally, I eat tuna salad because I actually LIKE the taste of tuna, and I think this recipe is trying to mask it with other ingredients.

I made this recipe for my husband, who I witnessed licking the tuna salad off the plate. My husband is not the lick food off the plate type of person, need I say more. I substitute the parsley flake with 1/2 tablespoon of finely chopped fresh parsley. This is my new favorite tuna salad.

I wasn't sure that I would like the dill/curry combo, but I didn't want to spend the time boiling eggs, chopping onion or celery like many other tuna salad recipes call for. I finished this & went to taste test so that I could add salt and pepper that isn't on the recipe & was blown away. This tuna salad was the best and didn't even need the s&p. Thank you!!

I wasn't exactly "exact" with my measurements of the different ingredients, but instead played around with the amounts to suit my tastes.  It ended up great!  The curry is an absolutely wonderful addition to regular tuna salad - I make this over and over again as it's super easy, fast and good!

My husband loved it! I don't like tuna so I really struggle when making anything with tuna for him (because I won't taste it). It's a keeper. The only change I made was raw onion I didn't have any dried.
Thank You!

Fantastic recipe! The curry powder adds a subtle depth to the tuna that is unlike any other recipe.


For this recipe, I omit the dill weed and Parmesan as I usually don't have any on hand. I also omit the sweet pickle relish as I don't like pickles.


I usually also get a 5 oz can of chunk tuna in water (4 oz drained) and eyeball the amount of spices I put in. I also don't put in a full 6 tbsp of mayo, but something more like 3 tbps. I make my own mayo with only olive oil, so I taste the salad as I go. This lends itself to a yummy, super smooth tuna salad!

I just made a batch and a half. Delicious! We are putting it on fresh toasted bakery bread. I made it pretty much by recipe with less mayo and more cheese. It would be great on crackers too for an appetizer.

I had to do it a bit differently because I actually did not have curry powder or Parmesan cheese on hand (but I will use both next time)! I used skim milk cheese, and I added in some diced orange pepper that I had left over and used homemade relish. Everything else was the same as the recipe calls for. It was yummy! Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful and easy tuna salad.  Bursting with flavor and the hint of curry sets it apart.  Definitely a keeper.

AWESOME!  My husband doesn't like pickle relish in my tuna salad, so I chopped up celery instead.  Everything else was exactly as listed.  It was sooooooo goood!!  No more tuna & mayo salad for me!

Everybody loves this version of Tuna Salad but I do prefer to use chopped pickles instead of relish and chopped onions instead of flakes. I also use oil packed tuna and don't drain it. Man, it is SO good that way. Without changes I'd only give it 4 stars.

This is SUCH an amazing recipe. I have made it more than 10 times in the past month since I found this wonderful recipe. I read other reviews and I, too, added a little more curry powder, less mayo, more onion and garlic and parmesan. I CRAVE this tuna salad because it is THAT good. Thanks Barbie!

Made this recipe often now and just realized I hadn't reviewed it. It is the best tuna salad recipe! I love love love it! I do it with or without the parmesan. You can cut back on the parsley but it's also good as is. Don't be scared by the curry (I was), it really gives it a nice touch. It's the only recipe I use now. I use about 4 tbsp of mayo instead of 6.

An exceptional tuna salad - I've made it many times.  I like fruit in chicken/tuna salad, so this time I added some halved red grapes.  Love it both with and without.

I had to use six cans of albacore for this! My guests hated it, so I reassured them that this was a top-notch recipe. Then I tried it. UGH! I was mortified.

This is the best tuna salad I have ever made. I was worried about using curry, but it really made it taste great. The only change I made was I added real onion instead of the flakes. I will make this recipe again and again. Thanks.

i didn't have the relish, onion flakes or dried parsley.. but still managed to pull it off.. 5 oz can of tuna.. kept the parm same amount.. halved the mayo, doubled the curry, used 2 T fresh minced onion as others suggested but could have gone less.. halved the dill and used 1/4 t garlic powder.. which was a bit much.. 1/8 t probably would have sufficed.. there's always next time! ty for an alternate version of tuna salad =)

Excellent!  Substituted cucumber slices for crackers and added 1/8 cup real onion and some extra curry.  I didn't have sweet relish so I used dill instead and just ommitted the dill weed.  It was SO good and perfect for a hot summer day's lunch!

Wow! I love tuna salad and I love curry. But I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about putting the two together. Still, I had been craving some kind of tuna salad and was bored with my old recipe. I'm so glad I decided to give this one a try. Didn't have the onion flakes, so I skipped that. Had everything else. It turned out really well! The curry (and likely the parmesan) gave it a little twist that made it so much better. This one is a keeper for me!

Great recipe!  Only change I made was I used 3 tbs of mayo instead of 6 the recipe called for to make sandwiches. But, if you were using it as an appetizer, I would add the full amount of mayo.

Absolutely terrific flavor combination! Will definitely use this recipe again. I drained my sweet relish so it wouldn't become runny as a few mentioned. Just added salad dressing and spices to my liking.

I'm on a high protein diet and have been eating a lot of tuna lately. I'm glad I found this recipe because it is delicious. I just reduced or deleted what I don't like while still remaining open. I don't like the idea of putting pickle relish with tuna so instead I just used one tablespoon. I could taste it just enough and to my surprise it pairs well with tuna. I omitted the dill because I simply don't like it. I love garlic so I used a teaspoon. I didnt think curry would taste good either but it was so yummy.

This recipe certainly lives up to its reviews!!  
I did tone it down on the mayo (4T instead, as I like the consistency to be chunky). Other than that, would not change a thing really.  You can even turn this into a big meal; just toss up some bow tie pasta in the mix.   

Thank you for this Tanaquil. :)

This is the BEST Tuna Salad I have ever had.  I can't get enough of it.  Be sure to adjust the recipe to 5 ounce can's.  I usually use two can's at once and go from there.  If I could give this 10 Stars I would.  It's good alone, on bread or crackers.  I could eat the whole thing at one sitting, but I try to control myself.

Wonderful flavors.  I combined everything except the tuna first, then stirred in the drained, flaked tuna.  I used fresh parsley and dill (tripled the amount), and made the recipe the day before.  I served it on whole grain, toasted bread, cut into quarters, with tomato basil soup.  I got raves!

Love this recipe, this is the only way I eat tuna salad/sandwiches now! Super easy and I always have those ingredients on hand, so works great for me. Thanks!

I really wasn't sure how to rate this because I haven't decided if I like it or not.  It doesn't taste bad...just not an expected flavor for tuna salad.  I mixed everything except the tuna and let the seasonings merry, so that if I didn't like it I could dump and make my normal tuna salad.  When I tasted it again, I still wasn't sure, so I decided to go with it.  I added a large can of white tuna and three boiled eggs, with a dash or two of pepper.  I've never been on the fence with another recipe as I am with this one.

Great recipe!  I used a 5 oz can of tuna and scaled the recipe, except i only used about 1 tablespoon of lite miracle whip.  Anything more would have been soupy, I think.  Not normally a tuna salad fan, but this was good.

Great work, Barbie! I felt like one can of tuna was just not enough so I added an extra can and that worked out great.  I also added some black pepper and a little extra dill and garlic.  So yummy and different, we'll be making this again soon.  I would like to add a boiled egg or two next time.

This is really good. I love the curry and the dill.  I did use a little less mayo, but that is just because I prefer my tuna salads more chunky than creamy. This will be my standard tuna salad recipe from now on.

I really like this recipe. It's easy to make and taste great. I have used tuna and crockpot chicken to make this recipe. I think I like the chicken the best. It doesn't taste very good when it's first made but after chilling it's great. My lunch time favorite with crackers or as a sandwich.

Excellent. On the A|R page for tuna salad its listed close to the bottom. Luckily, for me finding it I googled it first and it was near the top of the search. Guy thing, nevermind. Anyways, I like the variety of ingredients that are used here. I was wondering can this recipe also work successfully with canned chicken or ham?

I definetly liked this receipe but thought it needed a litte more flavor.  I guess I had higher expectations from the other reviews I read.  I'm going to play around with some of the "spices" and see what happens.

Wow.  I needed a solid, tested recipe for a luncheon and choose this after reading the reviews.  I made the recipe as written (after I scaled it for 52 servings) and the results are spectacular.  This isn't your grandmother's tuna salad by any means!  My children loved it as well.  Don't be afraid.  Try this and you will never go back to traditional tuna salad.

I love this recipe.  I used a 12 ounce can, so I had to change the measurements.  But I read through the reviews and decided to to use 2 less tablespoons than written.  Also, instead of curry powder, I used ground cumin.  This is just a personal preference, but I really enjoyed how it turned out.  Also, I didn't have any relish or garlic powder, so i just sprinkled some sugar, and the result was fantastic!  A new recipe for the boxes!

this is by FAR the best tuna salad ever! I have to triple the recipe when I make it. My husband is addicted to it! I literally have to make it once a week! 
I love it on a toast sandwich with a slice of cheese. : ) 
I'm so glad I found this! I have been making this recipe for over a year now. I didn't make any changes cept i use onion powder instead of the dried onions... all i had was powder and I loved it with using that. : )

I had high hopes for this recipe and read all of the rave reviews.  I was shocked at how BLAND this recipe tasted.  I even added a litttle more of all spice ingredients and still blah taste.  I am refrigerating it now until in the morning, hoping that the flavors will come alive and meld.

This is a great tuna salad recipe! The only changes that I made the second time around was adding a little chopped celery -I personally like a little crunch, and I used half the mayo. 
Great and delish!! Thanks for sharing :-)

This was pretty good but not amazing.  I love curry so I had to give it a try.  I'm not sure the parmesan cheese added anything, don't think I would put that in next time.  Kind of a strange ingredient with everything else.

Loved the mixture of flavors in this tuna salad.  I added 3 hard boiled egg whites and 2 celery stalks for the crunch.  Made it stretch a little further and I like a drier tuna salad so it worked out great!  I ate mine on a whole wheat tortilla with lettuce.  YUM! Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

Just made this with some leftover seared albacore.  I used fresh dill/parsley, skipped the parm & added toasted, sliced almonds & 1/4 tsp. red chile paste.  I also substituted greek yogurt for 2/3 of the mayo. It is delicious and I LOVE the curry flavor!  Great snack w/ rice crackers!  Thank you for sharing!

Prepared this dish a few minutes ago ... OMG ... this is so good.  This will now be a staple in my household.  My son ate his with crackers.  Never thought all these ingredients would marry so well together.  Thank you for giving me a new "spin" on tuna salad.  No more dicing onions, celery and eggs for me.

It was so delicious, I loved it ! I did have to add an extra can of tuna because I like it chunky.

This recipe came up as I was hunting for new ideas for tuna salad.  The can in my pantry I thought was tuna turned out to be chicken breast, but I made this anyway.  It  was excellent!  I didn't have the onion flakes, so I used fresh finely chopped onion.  I'll be making this again and can't wait to try it with tuna.  Great one!

I really loved this recipe! I didnt add the dill weed or the pickles, but the curry and parmesan make for a really interesting flavor. I love my tuna salad smooth so I stuck it in the food processor for a few pulses and it came out great!

I was surprised at how good this was! I love fresh tuna...but gag at canned, so this is REALLY a good recipe. I did change it a bit--less mayo and dill--more sweet relish and fresh onion. It's a keeper!

My whole family enjoyed this recipe--it was easy and a nice change from your everyday tuna fish with mustard and mayo. It seems like it would fit right in with any upscale gourmet cafe's menu. Thanks for the recipe.

My kids HATE tuna salad, and both of them asked for this in their school lunches.  Great recipe!!  (Made mine with dill pickles instead of sweet due to preference, and 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of a pinch.)

Yeah this is it! Curry added to tuna is so good. I would never have thought to do this until I tried this recipe. I don't use the full amount of dill and pickle relish, but everything else is great. I make it so much that I just get out the ingredients and eyeball the measurements to my tasting. Try it!!!

Made this served with pita pockets for my husband's lunch - it was a huge hit!  He is also an olive 'nut' and requested that I add them - while I was a bit skepticl of the addition, he *loved* it.  Will definitely make again!

I just made this and thought it was a really good change to the everyday tuna salad.  After reading the other reviews I put about half the parsley, dill weed and sweet relish in and it tasted great but still a little too sweet for my taste, but that's an easy fix next time. I'm also going to try adding more curry.

Best tuna salad we've had.  The second time we made it we didn't have any dill or sweet pickles so we used lemon basil and pickled peppers.  Will make again and again.

WOW! I've been making Tuna wrong for 30+ years. This is sublime!! My tween loved it so much, she watched as I made sandwiches to make sure she got her fair share. Just to save cals, I used light Miracle Whip and only 3-4 tbsp. Thanks

This is now my favorite tuna recipe!  The curry powder is definitely the secret ingredient and I thank you Barbie for this recipe because I never would have thought to add curry powder to tuna salad!  I was out of dill weed and pickle relish so I just skipped it and I also forgot to add the onion....opps.  For crunch, I added a little celery and corn.  Great recipe!!

This is soo delicious!!  First tried it without the curry and dill since I didn't have the ingredients. I loved it so much I decided to make it the next day with the curry this time but still without dill. The curry made a whole lot of difference. I loved it both with and without the curry powder. The mayo though as was mentioned in other reviews were too much so had to reduce it to 5 tbsps the first time and it was still too uch. The next time I used four. It was okay but 3 and a half tbsps would have been sufficient.  Thanks for sharing the recipe. This will be my go-to tuna salad recipe from now on.

I stumbled onto this and was thrilled to see nearly 5 stars on over 500 reviews....I, like many others, prepared mine a bit differently.  I used only 1/2 as much mayo (and it was a 'lite' version)...for everything else I was right to the recipe.  It was delicious, though a little too sweet for my taste so I think I'll try only 2T of relish next time.  Delicious, though, nonetheless.  And a definite do-ever.

Minor changes: We used fresh, finely chopped onion and celery instead of onion flakes and added hard-boiled egg. Those are necessary for good tuna salad, at least around here. We also put less relish than called for because I'm not a huge relish fan. We also didn't measure the mayo. The dry seasoning itself was awesome, and that alone gets 5 stars. Thanks!

I really loved this tuna salad but for one thing - it seemed a bit salty to me.  The second time I made it I cut back on the parmesan cheese and it was better!  I think maybe halving the mayo would be a good idea - seemed a bit much.  But GREAT flavor!

For the longest time I would prepare the same tuna recipe and it just got old after a while.  Then I found this recipe. I prepared it for my husband and he really liked it. I will definitely keep it in my recipe box. It was good even though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand...I didn't have any dried dill and I substituted onion flakes for onion powder and added a bit more parmesan and leas mayonnaise.

Yum!!!  I made a few changes, such as cutting the mayo down, and omitting the dill, and using sweet relish.  I also used minced fresh onion and tossed in a few tablespoons of pepitas (raw, shelled pumpkin seeds) for some extra nutrients and crunch.  I put a few large dollops of the tuna salad in a bowl with shredded romaine, spinach, and kale and ate it like a salad.  The perfect lunch!

My go-to recipe for tuna salad now. I'm not really a fan of tuna salad, but I love the flavor combo of the ingredients in this. I've only made one change, and that's to add a diced hard boiled egg or two. Yum.

I made this for my husband to take for sandwiches for lunch - I myself don't care for canned tuna in any form.  He pronounced it the best tuna salad he'd ever had so I tasted it myself on a saltine and it was good!!  I doubled the recipe on all but the mayo adding just over 1 tblsp and it was dry but workable.  I was worried about the amount of relish and it did over-power the tuna somewhat, which may be why even I liked it.  This will definitely make it into my regular rotation :)

This is THE BEST tuna salad recipe I've had. I add more parmesan, and onion flakes, and if I don't have parmesan on hand, then I sub romano. Very versatile!!!

Yummy!  I was skeptical at first when I saw the list of ingredients, but this was the best!  I'll never go back to another tuna salad again!

I think this is the best tuna salad I have tried from this site so far. I did not have a 7 ounce can, rather, I used two 5 ounce cans. I kept all measurements the same except added a bit more mayo to make up the difference. I thought it was really good. I ate mine as a sandwich with some fresh tomato.

great recipe!  i agree with other users, i only used about 3 1/2 tbsp of mayo and that was plenty.  i was unsure about the curry and only added about 1/8 tsp and that was perfect.  loved the addition of parmesan cheese, so i added a bit more.  delish!  i ate mine with crackers, this would be a great dip to serve!

I work from home and was looking for something quick but good; I only had 5 minutes to eat! This recipe is delicious and so easy to make!  I didn't have dried onion so I used finely slivered onions and a little onion powder, I also used the olive oil variety mayo which is better for you. The recipe took me two minutes to prepare and about one minute to devour! Thanks for this awesome treat!

YUM!!  I had gotten so tired of tuna fish, that I have not had it in years.  I stumbled upon this recipe and decided to give it a try.   I'm so glad I did!   I used much less mayo than called for (about 3 tbsp), and because I only had a tiny amount left, I used only about a tsp. of sweet pickle relish.  The curry powder really makes the recipe.   Mmmm...

This is FANTASTIC. I gave it only 4 stars because even after halving the mayo it was too much for our tastes. Next time we will add even less mayo and it will be even better. Really love this recipe!!

Whoa! Way too much mayo. I added about 4 tablespoons before I started getting worried and I stopped. I'm glad I did because it was just perfect at 4 tablespoons. Otherwise this was an excellent recipe. The curry really makes it something special. I put this tuna salad on tomato-basil foccacia bread with romaine lettuce and slices of provolone. Fantastic! Next time I'll probably just do 1 tablespoons mayo and 2 tablespoons plain fat free yogurt to make this recipe healthier.

This was just OK for me. My husband enjoyed it, but I thought the curry was WAY too overpowering. *If* I make this recipe again, I'll definitely reduce the amount of curry in it.

This salad was good though I thought it was more like a spread or dip.  Not your traditional salad type tuna.  It improved greatly after refrigeration overnight.  I would make it again but more to go with carackers than a sandwich.

very, very good. so much better than the boring (mayo, mustard, relish) tuna i have made my whole life! i just winged it, and didn't measure anything, just eye balled it. i put everything in there but i didn't have onion flakes so i used onion powder... still tasted great. i put it on whole wheat bread w/ lettuce & tomato. it was easy, fast and yum! :) update: my bf has made me make them 3 days in a row, also he eats 2 or 3 sandwichs each time and can't stop, he loves it.

Very good! We loved the blend of the spices. I did change a little per our tastes though. I used 3 cans of tuna and added 2 eggs, however, I used the amount of relish and spices that the recipe called for without tripling it which I thought was a good idea. The spices were strong with my additions so I can only imagine how overpowering they would be with just 1 can of tuna. Also, I never measure my mayo - I always just use the amount to our liking.

I love tuna sandwiches, but I didn't like this recipe.  Not a fan of the sweet pickled relish, or the Parmesan-tuna combination.  I'll stick to using real pickle, even though it's more work to chop up.

I saw this recipe on the main page and it got great reviews, so I had to try it for lunch!  Unfortunately, I would rate it as just average.  Not bad at all- but not fantastic, either.  It had way too much mayo.  I like my regular tuna salad better: can of tuna, light mayo, a dab of yellow mustard, a bit of dried dill, some sliced green olives, and a bit of olive brine to give the mixture some extra flavor and moistness.  It's so good :)  I'll probably make this recipe again if I want something different and will tinker with the ingredient amounts.

LOVED IT! I like to sub cooked chicken for tuna .... makes a fine chicken salad to.  I suppose you could sub chopped cooked salad shrimp also.... maybe adding old bay for the curry powder? What I don't like is having to print the adds off that come with the printer link for the recipes.  A good waste of expensive ink cartg..

WOW...its truly amazing. A little parmesan, a little curry powder, and it becomes stellar! Who knew that would happen?  It's like adding a dash of nutmeg to a pasta sauce or  spinach dish...an AMAZING taste change with just one unusual ingredient. My hat's off to the talented chefs who figure this stuff out...you guys are the Picasso of eating...and I will follow you anywhere!

I love tuna fish and found this just a few days ago. Its amazing. I'm 22 years old and a beginner at finding new recipes and ohh my! I tasted it when I was finished and was like "holy cow, thats good." Weird enough, I couldnt find a 7oz can of tuna in the stores (publix) so I used a whole 12oz can of chicken of the sea solid white albacore and only used 5T of mayo. It still turned out perfect for me. I cant wait until lunch time, its in the frdge chilling. Yuuum. Thanks for this awesome recipe! I will be putting this in my recipe box!

Very good combination of spices/ingredients. I sort of eye-balled everything and it turned out great. Very easy to add what you need to make it taste just to your liking. I will make this again when I am in the mood for a tuna salad sandwich!

Great flavor, much better than the normal boring tuna salad! However, it needed some crunch so I added some slivered almonds.

This is now my favorite tuna salad recipe.  It's flavorful and unusual.  I used less mayo than called for and slightly less dill.

Very good!  I would definitely cut back some on the mayo.  I only used 1/2 what the recipe called for and it still had a nice consistency.

This recipe is excellent!  I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the mayo, for a lighter version.  Also, I added a touch of salt, and some freshly ground black pepper.  I served it with toasted garlic baguette chips, and it was gone in a hurry!

Pretty good tuna salad - I'm not a big fan of curry powder, so when I first tasted it I didn't think I was going to like it.  However, after the tuna salad sat in the fridge for a while the flavors seemed to blend better and the curry was a very subtle background flavor that I quite enjoyed.  I used slightly less mayo, due to personal preferences, and fresh parsley and a scallion instead of dried parsley and dried onion.

This was amazing!  I'm only so-so on most tuna salads & was also a little apprehensive about the curry, because I'm not a big fan.  What a wonderful delicious surprise--definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

This is such a fabulous and easy recipe.  The Parmesan cheese is a genius touch... it adds so much savory flavor that's undetectable as anything but "yummy".  I double the recipe using one can of Bumblebee oil-packed tuna and one can of albacore in water.  The curry, too, is very subtle but essential.    For texture I'll add some celery and bell pepper, but it's great without as well!

I don't even like tuna and I loved this recipe!  I'm trying to eat more healthy, so I served this with whole wheat buttery crackers.  I was out of dill weed, so that is the only ingredient that I left out.  But, it was still very delicious.

I tried to follow this recipe exactly, but I didn't have mayonnaise so I used Ranch Dressing instead.  I also used 1/4 teaspoon in place of 1/8 teaspoon because I don't believe in 1/8 teaspoon of anything!  It was fantastic. I was a little afraid of the curry, but the dill ended up being the most noticable flavor, and it is excellent.

This recipe works better with 4 TBS of mayo. I added chopped apple which goes well with the curry and used fine shopped onion celery about 2 TBS each.

I made tuna salad sandwiches for lunch today.  I thought I had curry powder at home but I didn't!  :(  So I made the tuna salad without it.  My son is 16 months and he ate his whole half a sandwich without fussing!!  We really enjoyed ours too.  I just had one question about the tuna salad...where does the sweet relish come in?  I've relied heavily on take-out most of my life and it's made me really not confident in the kitchen!  It seems like the obvious answer would be to mix in the sweet relish with all the other ingredients, but since it didn't say I wasn't sure if I should do it or not and I tasted the tuna without it and decided it was pretty good and so I left it as it was.

My friend and I really liked this.  I am trying to eat lighter so I used reduced fat mayo, and about half the amount called for and was still impressed.  The curry and parm are nice touches which give this a unique flavor.

We like really flavorful and spicy things in our house and I'm always trying to make things healthier. Simply, low fat mayo and less just to bind. Increase Parmesan to 2 oz and use 1/2 tsp of curry and some red chile pepper. THe onion and garlic should be fresh and chopped finely.

I'm not a big fan of tuna, but loved this tuna salad. I have made it many times, since trying it. Everyone in my family loves it, even my picky 6 year old. I can't give it 5 stars though, simply because I did not have all ingredients on hand. I did not have curry, or dill weed and don't care for pickle relish in my tuna. I found it to be great without the other ingredients and love it on a bed of lettuce.

This is a great, fast recipe that has become my go-to for lunch.  I sometimes substitute canned salmon for the tuna.  I reduce the mayo and parsley a bit and double the cumin.  I can only say Yum-oh!

The dill is a great addition! I would suggest a higher quality tuna for a more appealing look--it's dryer than some of the recipes heavier on mayo so the appearance of the fish shows.

LOVE IT!!!!  Made it w/o garlic powder-did not have.  Eyeballed the mayo as i always do making tuna.  The addition of the relish seemed to make the "dressing" wetter, but I took that in consideration.  Bottomline.  This is without doubt the lovelist tasting tuna salad that I have ever tasted.  My husband, not a fan of sweet relish in tuna salad, loved it!  As the sweetness was tempered by all the other wonderful flavors.  PS: Added tiny dices of celery as I NEED crunch in my tuna salad.  This is the best!!!

Oh my GOSH! This is the best tuna salad I have EVER had. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because I did reduce the amount of mayo by quite a lot because it seemed like mayo overload to me. Also, I find I actually like it better without the parmesan or the relish. The curry is so complimentary to the tuna that I found the other flavors kind of get in the way. This recipe on a nice toated piece of flax bread...HEAVEN.

This was OK, but I did not like the curry taste. I would have rated this recipe 5 stars if the curry was omitted.

I made this recipe twice and found for me it was better when I used 2 cans of tuna but kept all the other ingredients the same.

This is my favorite tuna recipe.  Just use MUCH less mayo than the recipe calls for- use your own judgement.  I also substitute fat free yogurt for part of the mayo sometimes to make it a little healthier.

I enjoyed this, but my husband thought the blend of seasonings was too overwhelming for his taste. In his words, he'd prefer plain onion powder, mayo, and tuna.  I liked it, though - it had a little more kick than many other tuna salads.

Absolutely amazing. I found this recipe maybe two months ago and have since made it about 5 times. I don't like tuna, so I used salmon, and cut down on the mayo. Really, an amazing recipe! Thank you!

This was a hit with my family. I used less mayo and used fresh chopped onions and added celery and more parmesan and curry powder. Also, I left out the dill since I didn't have any. Still tasted great. Thanks for the recipe.

This was very flavorful and tasty.  I served it on toasted multi-grain bread and it was delightful.  But, be warned, the recipe calls for WAY too much mayonnaise.  I had doubled the recipe, so I doubled erything else but only added about 50% more mayonnaise, and it still came out looking like it would be a mayonnaise sandwich.  I had to add a third can of tuna to thicken it, yet it was still heavy on mayo.  Use about 1/3 or less of what the recipe says.

I only used a 5 oz can of tuna so I pared down the ingredients.  Honestly I didn't measure, just put everything that it called for in it.  Ok, this tuna is so good!  I will srrely make this again!!!

This was awesome! My husband was very skeptical of a new recipe but loved it. I but ranch salad dressing instead of mayo, and served it on a bagel (because we didn't have any bread or crackers)...I chopped up onion instead of the flakes. I liked it too,  and I really don't care for tuna very much.

Once I read the ingredients to this recipe I had to give it a go and try it out.  Barbie's tuna salad was so yummy and filling.  I made a few slight modifications - I added 1 extra tblspn of parmesan cheese, 1 tblspn cayenne pepper (love the kick), added some salt/ pepper, left out the pickle relish (hate relish), left out onion flakes (I didn't have any).  The tuna salad came out perfect, the best tuna salad I've tried so far.  I will definitely be making this at my next party - Thanks!

Yum!!  This was very good.  We have a large family so I doubled the recipe, used 1/2c. m. whip lite, 5T. relish and added 3 boiled eggs (to make it go further).  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely WOW!  Yes, today's cans are just 5-6oz so I used Lite Mayo and only 2T and scaled down the other ingredients to match a 5oz can. I eat LOTS of tuna since it is low in fat and am always looking for ways to give it flare, this was it!  Try it!

After eating tuna fish every Friday for twenty two years I never thought I would want another tuna sandwich. Because of the curry,dill and Parmesan I decided to try it. Added maybe a touch more curry than the original recipe but that is the only change.

The original recipe has way too mayo, so I used slightly less. There is also a lot of pickle relish in it! I am a fan of it, but I cannot taste the tuna. I also did not have any curry powder. I might try to make it again with less relish.

WAY too much mayo!!!   I love mayo, so I thought I could handle it but it really made the tuna much too heavy.  Otherwise it's a decent recipe.

Awesome tuna salad! The only differences I made were omitting the dill weed (didn't have any), adding extra garlic powder, and also adding 2 stalks of chopped celery for crunch. Delicious!

I didn't love this or hate this, but it definitely works better as a cracker topper (as the submitter suggested) than a sandwich filler. I'm taking it out of my recipe box.  It was just okay.

I thought it was very good except for me there was too much dill. Thats all I could taste. I did give it a four star because I believe if there wasn't so much dill it would have been great. I will make this again I just won't put as much dill in it! Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  I scaled everything back just a smidge since my can of tuna was only 5oz.  I chopped a dill pickle instead of the sweet relish just for personal preference.  Had is as a wrap on a whole wheat tortilla with a little lettuce.  Delish!  My 2 year old daughter ate hers on crackers and loved it also.  This will be a regular summer lunch for us.

I never liked tuna salad until I tried this recipe.  It's really delicious!  I definitely did not use all of the mayonnaise that it called for.  And I used the pouch of tuna instead of the can because draining it is time consuming and I really like for all of the liquid in the tuna to be drained.  So, great recipe.  Only change was less mayo.

Wonderful...after a few changes.  I didn't do the relish.  Added less dill.  Everything else pretty much the same, but added celery, the onion was fresh, red.  Always Hellman's.  Next time I will add hard boiled egg and green olives.

WAY too much mayonnaise and relish - I used 4 tbs of mayo, 1 tbs of relish, and 15 oz of tuna, and it was still pretty mayonaissey.

Very tasty! However, I had over TWICE the tuna and used HALF of the mayo.  I don't know if it's just me but I thought adding it all would be way too much, even for alot more tuna.  This recipe was good though, I don't actually need a recipe to make tuna but I will definitely use it again.  Yummmmmmy!

The first time I made this recipe, I doubled all ingredients except for the mayo and pickle relish.  I need my salad to be a little less fattening and less sweet.  Great tuna salad though.

I've always ate my tuna salad with boiled eggs in it so I was reluctant to try this. I am glad I did this was great and I didn't miss the egg being in it. It was too wet for me for a sandwich. If you are using with crackers then it was perfect. If you are using for a sandwich then I would cut the mayonaisse by half. I used 10 oz of tuna and it was still too wet for a sandwich. I also added cayenne for some heat and doubled the amount of parm. I will definitely make again.

Yum! And very different from my family's classic recipe of tuna-mayo-mustard-pickles-celery. Which is a great basic but this is more of a gourmet twist but with things you probably already have on hand.

I loved this!  It was a bit of a different twist on tuna salad.  If you don't like curry that much, use only half- but I'd keep the other spices at the amounts the original recipe calls for.  I didn't have the pickle relish so I took the pickles and finely chopped them.

I freaking loved this tuna salad but I have to say, it was WAY too soupy with the amount of mayo it gave for 3 cans of tuna, so I added another.  and I added more cheese.  i like my tuna salad to be chunky, this was more of a spready thing for crackers than it was for a sandwich but DANG it is awesome.  oh and i didn't have enough sweet relish so i added some sweet pickle things i found in my fridge and it was even awesomer!

I am rating the recipe as is at 2 stars, because I believe the amount of spices and relish were WAY overpowering.  Actually I think the combination of ingredients is excellent.  The next time I make it though, I will half the parsley, curry powder, and dill.  There is enough relish that you really don't need the dill.  Also, I will use fresh onion and parsley instead of dried.  Great recipe, and I can see how others would enjoy it.  I myself like things a little more simple and if you are of that mindset I would advise halfing the spices!

Oh, man, is this good....  Just finished having it for a late lunch.  Would be 5 stars, but a half a cup of mayo for one can of tuna would have made this really soupy...  at least to me.  I added a boiled egg cause I love them with tuna.  Other changes were based on what I had.  No relish, so cut up some fire and ice pickles.  No dill, but didn't miss it.  After tasting, added a touch of celery seed and a little black pepper.  This would be wonderful in a pita bread with lettuce and tomato, but as I can attest, is equally great with a few crackers and a spoon!

I was pleased with this tuna salad. I'm always looking for ways to make tuna more flavorful, and I think the parmesan cheese was a big help. I didn't have any dill, so I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the salad even more with it. Also, I think I should have used a little more mayo. (I didn't use the amount the recipe called for, I just used the amount I wanted) All in all, I will make this recipe again, but I'm still looking for a recipe that has just a bit more kick.

Great tuna salad!  I usually double it and use one can white one can regular to cut cost.  I also use half the mayo and half the relish to cut fat.  I love celery in my tuna and add it to cut calories and for test.  This is my favorite tuna salad I could eat it for lunch every day!

I have tried many tuna salads and this one is among my favorites! I use a bit less of mostly everything for the amount of tuna in the recipe and it still turns out great. I serve as a tuna melt open faced with a slice of cheddar cheese...yum!

This was pretty good. I only used about 2 tbsps of mayo and relish and even that made it liquidy until I chilled it in the fridge for about an hour. I used real garlic and left out the curry (personal tastes) and after it had chilled it was the perfect consistency and tasted great. A nice change of pace for tuna I will definitely make again.

Very good! I tried it with water based tuna (well drained) and a brand of pickles and mayo that I don't like and it was good in spite of all that. I really like the dill. I served it on baguette with coleslaw. Would also have been great with lettuce and a bit of mustard. Thanks for the recipe.

this is a wonderful tuna salad. I did add hard-boiled egg whites, but this beats any tuna dish i've tried in the past, even my children loved it.

This was ok.  The curry was an interesting add, which is why I tried it, but all in all this was not one of my favorites.

I thought this was a very nice twist on the regular tuna salad. I did cut down on the mayo as others have suggested. I did not add the parsley. Only things I added to it was a pinch of sesame seeds and I added 2 chopped hard boiled eggs to it. Wife enjoyed it. The girls did until I told them it was tuna fish. They wont eat any fish for some reason. Should have told them it was chicken salad.

This is a wonderful sandwhich mix.  I used a light Miracle Whip but because of the tang I think light mayo will work better....will definately make again and again especially for functions. Thanks!

Hmmmm, delicious!  I have to give it 5 stars because it was exactly what I was looking for.  I had to laugh a little about your sister.  If it makes her feel better then tell her that an American living in Germany got a taste of home today and that helped her feel not so homesick!  Thanks for sharing!

I changed this recipe somewhat. I felt that 6 tablespoons of mayo was way to much. I reduced it to 2 1/2 tablespoons. I didn't have dill so I didn't use it. I had Red Curry and Indian Curry. I used the Indian Curry because I like the taste of that best. I thought 3 tablespoons of sweet pickle relish was way to much, so I reduced it to 1 tablespoons. Everything else, I used what the recipe recommended. I will be making this again. Also, it was great without the dill.

This was really good... I doubled the recipe, used one can of fancy white tuna and one can of regular tuna (both in water). Great if you want a change from the plain old tuna with mayo & relish.

My husband absolutely dreads when I periodically "try" to cook.  He actually calls my attempts at cooking "experiments".  I must say he was quite surprised when I made tuna salad wraps tonight using this recipe.  He actually loved it!  Thanks to Barbie's Tuna Salad recipe we don't have to go out to eat after a failed attempt at making dinner.

I was a little disappointed.  I made the recipe as stated, but cut back on the parsley & dill by half.  I thought it was OK, and my husband was definitely NOT thrilled.  Interesting flavor blend, but have had better recipes.  Will not make again -- sorry.

I've never really been a fan of tuna salad.  I don't like raw celery.  This one is simply amazing.  I'm a huge curry fan.  It's hard to wait for the flavors to really develop.  I can see myself making this on a bi-weekly basis.

This is a great recipe! 
I am on Weight Watchers and made some changes to make it more point friendly. 
I used 2 TBL fat free mayo
1 TBL reduced fat grated parmesean cheese
And as I was making it I also adjusted the other seasonings. I think the amounts listed would be better suited for two cans of tuna.However this is just to my personal taste. Either way I used only 1/2 tsp dill, 1/2 TBL parsley and left everything else as is. 
Great recipe! I will use this as my main tuna salad recipe from now on :)

This is very good. My family loved it. I used leftover grilled Tuna and added enough mayo to make it stick together. I used the Pampered Chef Dill seasoning as I didn't have any other dill. I, personally,would use less sweet relish and a little more curry but my family likes sweet relish.

This is the best tuna salad recipe I have ever had! I did follow the advice of others and used only 4 tablespoons of mayo and I only used 1 tablespoon of relish. Also, I used a little less dill. All in all, it is a wonderful recipe!

I was a little afraid to try this considering the combination of ingredients, but it is actually quite good.  After reading numerous reviews I made these changes:  only used 2 Tablespoons relish and 1/8 teaspoon curry.  Substituted fresh chopped onion and parsley for the dry. I did not use the all the mayo--just stirred in a  little at a time till desired consistency was achieved. I also added chopped celery and hard cooked eggs.  I will make this again.

I found this recipe several months ago and saved it but did not make it until today. Yumm - O. I made it according to the recipe, using less mayo and low fat. Only two things different were fresh parsley vs dried and I added a tablespoon of celery. This is my new favorite tuna salad. Thanks for sharing.

I tried this recipe b/c my friend makes a tweeked version of it, and she makes, hands-down, the best tuna salad ever!  Anyway, if I were to do this again, I would definitely not use sweet relish.  I also think I may have overdone the curry.

I wasn't sure about trying this because I don't like curry that much, but the reviews were so good I had to. I'm glad I did because it was great! The only changes I made were that I used dill relish because I didn't have any sweet, I used fresh onion because I didn't have any dried, and I didn't have any parsley. I loved it! I'm sure I'll be making it again. :)

This was excellent tuna salad.  I made just a few changes based on what I had one hand:  I used McCormick's It's a Dilly seasoning in place of the dill and garlic.  I cut way back on the mayo by half and used about 2 tablespoons of relish.  I melted a slice of american cheese on top while toasting the bread.  It was delicious!!!  My husband really enjoyed it too.  I will definitely make this again.  I  may try dill relish next time as I typically prefer dill over sweet.

I think I prefer a sweeter tuna salad and this one was not.  The dill, for me, overpowered all the other flavors so maybe I'll try again and use less dill and add sugar to sweeten a bit.

This was definitely a different twist to tuna salad for me.  It was so good I ate the whole thing!  I did not use any measuring utensils, just taste-tested as I went along.

Oh my, I have to say I am not a tuna salad lover, but my husband is.  I could not walk away from this.  It is so good.  The flavors are perfect together.  All I changed was to use less mayo and pickle relish.  This is a keeper.

I just made it this morning to bring to work for lunch and sampled a bit- quite delicious. This is how I'll make tuna salad from now on.  Thanks so much for posting this for us.

I thought this was great tuna salad.  I will always make it this way from now on.  I made a few changes but only due to taste preferences.  I don't like curry so I didn't add it.  I am also watching what I eat so I used 3 Tbs. of light mayo and 3 Tbs. of daisy lite sour cream.  This cuts a few calories and you can't tell the differnce.  I ate it on toasted 12 grain bread and it was delicious.

I made this as a pasta salad and it came out great. I doubled most of the ingredients, except the mayo and the curry. I left out the relish. I added some celery salt b/c I can't have tuna salad without it! It was great! I highly recommend making it with some pasta, but I am sure it would be great on some bread too =)

I really wasn't happy about the taste.
Ended up adding shallots which made it better but all in all it wasn't a flavor I cared for. I will continue on my  quest for tuna salad.

I have tried many tuna recipes in an effort to find a recipe that will tone down some of the overpowering tuna fishy flavor without success until now.  The flavors mix so well and compliment the tuna amazingly.  I didn't have any parmesan so I left that out.  Also, the proportions might be a bit off if you follow it exactly.  You should measure according to your tastes.  I used less mayonnaise and less quantities of spices and it still turned out fantastic!  This is a super keeper!

I love this recipie. Lots of people have complained about the mayo, so I just used the amount I normally do. I also added in 3/4 of an apple (cubed), and some crushed pecans - delicious! This tuna salad was great on some bakery fresh whole grain bread with a slice of swiss cheese and pan fried.

This is the BEST tuna salad recipe I have ever had! The only thing I did different was use dill relish instead of sweet (detest sweet!) and I didn't put any parm in it because I didn't have any. I also doubled the amount of tuna in it, because there seemed to be a WHOLE lot of mayo going on. GREAT recipe!

I have made this recipe a lot since trying it for the first time.  The only thing I did different was add mayonnaise to the consistency that I like.  It is very good on a square toasted bagel bread.

I liked this but made a few changes.  I used a lot less mayo than indicated, just adding enough to moisten the tuna.  Also just added a fraction of the relish and curry powder as I am not a huge fan of these ingredients.  I liked the addition of dill and parsley though.  A nice change from the typical tuna salad.

I read so many glowing reviews and tried this recipe. I was disappointed. You can't taste the parmesan cheese and although I like curry, this was a little overpowering. I'm glad everyone else liked it though.

I used less mayo, no relish (didn't feel like it?), fresh parsley rather than dried, and some liquid smoke.  It was pretty good.  :).  I also added celery seed.

This one was so-so.  I left out the curry, as I am not a fan.  Maybe that is why it was only middle of the road?  I think it would be better if onion powder was used instead of the onion flakes-they just don't have a texture that goes with the rest of the salad.

This is a really really good tuna salad recipe!  I used tuna packed in oil, so only ended up needing a little bit of mayo (maybe 2 tbsp).  I used fresh onion instead of flakes to give it a little extra crunch.  The curry and the dill really made this pop for me!

This was very good.  Used 3 pouches of tuna (9 oz. total), and half the recommended mayo.  Everything else was the same.  I did think the flavoring was a bit strong, but it was tasty.  I also added celery, but would omit it next time...too many flavors going on.  Will make again, thanks!

The tuna I buy comes in a 6 oz can, not 7 ounces, so I decreased the mayo to 5 tablespoons and it's still too much. Used dill pickle relish instead of sweet because I really hate the sweet kind. Also, I was out of oregano so I just skipped it. The curry powder is fantastic in it! Can't really taste the parmesan but then again, I'm using the powdered kind instead of fresh grated... I'm sure that would make a big difference. This is an awesome recipe and I would've given in 5 stars but I think 4 or maybe even 3 tablespoons of mayo would be great.

I made this for my husband who likes tuna & he didn't like it. He thought it was too sweet from the relish & there were too many herbs. I used 4 T of mayo instead of 6, used onion powder instead of flakes (didn't have any) & didn't add the curry powder (didn't have any). We ate this on bagel chips. I thought it was ok but I won't be making this again since my husband didn't like it. It's kind of a lot of work for tuna salad. Sorry.

Excellent tuna salad, I didn't have the onion but didn't miss it!  I only had a spicy/sweet relish on hand, so I cut it back a little, and it made it all the better!  Like some of the others, I cut back on the mayo and I actually made the recipe with 2 6oz cans of tuna.  It's a keeper!

Thank you!

I really liked this tuna! The parmesan gives it a wonderful flavor, but next time I may add more mayo, I give a 5 because the amount of mayo you use differs with different people, I happen to like more!

Hmmmm...this was an interesting one.  I was really nervous when I first combined all of the ingredients.  I wasn't sure if all  of the flavors were going to work together, and it kind of smelled funny.  But as I starting eating the salad, it started to grow on me.  I would eat this again, but it won't become a staple at our house.

I followed many of the previous comments and drastically reduced the mayonnaise.  I used about 4T for a triple recipe.  I cut back on the relish too.  I wasn't that impressed overall, however.  I thought the tuna was overly sweet.  I might try it again but use dill relish, instead of sweet relish.

Really good tuna salad.  I thought there was a bit too much mayo, like some other reviewers, so next time, I will cut back on it.  I also left out the dill because I don't like it.  All in all, it was pretty good!

This is awesome tuna salad; the only fault that I found with this recipe is that there is way too much mayonnaise for our tastes!  I cut the mayo in half and used two 6-oz cans of tuna instead of one 7 oz can, and it was perfect.  My husband loves the curry flavor, and I especially like the dill.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I normally HATE tuna salad but this was really good!  The seasonings and cheese seem to neutralize the overly "fishy" taste/smell that normally bothers me.  I used less Miracle Whip than it called for.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was very good. I did not have dried parsley, so I did not use any, and I also used regular dill relish instead of sweet relish because it was what I had in the fridge. Still turned out very tasty.

Outstanding!!  I did add 3 cans of tuna instead of one; used 3 TB fat free Cains mayo and 1 TB light Miracle Whip.  Added some diced onion and celery.  All the other ingredients I followed the recipe exactly.  Chilled a couple hours in the fridge before serving.   We put this on toasted bagels and topped with some shredded swiss cheese and broiled a few minutes in the oven to melt the cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

SIMPLY DELICIOUS! As soon as I saw this recipe I knew it was going to be amazing.  Even my husband who normally is a mile away when I make anything resembling fish, had seconds.  The kids ate it too.  This is going to be a regular at our house.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Pretty good recipe. The dill and curry gave it a nice savory flavor I've not found in other tuna salad recipes I've tried. Tomorrow will be the true test - sandwich in my son's school lunch!

Yummy, made this last night and we had none left over. I did not have curry so I omitted it and used dill pickles instead of sweet relish. It was still very yummy. Think I will try it with curry next time.

Excellent flavor.  I love this stuff.  I cut back on the mayonnaise (actually the "Nayonnaise"). I didn't have onion or dill weed. But it was still fantastic.

I loved this! I doubled the recipe to have leftovers for lunch & I used finely minced red onion instead of the onion flakes. I also decreased the mayo (I used lite) some becasue it seemed like a lot. Served this on a bed of spring greens squeezed w/ lemon, w/ sliced tomatoes, breadsticks w/ garlic butter & a glass of white zin. Thanks Tanaquil...this is a winner!

I was tired of my usual tuna salad, so I thought I'd give this a try and was surprised at how good it is.  Initially I was put off by the green of all the herbs, but the taste made up for it.  Also, I decreased the amount of mayo to 4 T--6 T would have been too much.

I'm not a fan of tuna salad, but I LOVE this.  I put less Mayo and added egg.  My boyfriend can't get enough of it.  We've had two batches in two days.  NO leftovers!  Thanks for the recipe!

Best Tuna Salad I ever had!! I left out the relish, because I don't like sweet relish. I might try it with dill relish next time, but it really dosen't need it. I will be making this again!! What a great way to put more fish in my diet!

This was good, it just wasn't anything too different from your normal tuna salad.  I used a 12oz. can of tuna rather than a 7oz can of tuna and kept the other ingredient amounts the same.  I doubled the curry powder, and used chopped red onion rather than dried onion flakes, which was yummy because it added something a little crunchy.  I couldn't really taste the parmesan at all.  But it made for a good lunch on whole wheat bread.
