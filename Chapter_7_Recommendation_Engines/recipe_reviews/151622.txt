I doctored it up a bit.  I had tilapia filets,so that is what I used.  I added a can of sliced  mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic to the browning butter/onion mixture.  Since I had it, I tossed in my last 2 tablespoons of cooking sherry, and added about 2 more tablespoons of white cooking wine.  Then I drained the can of tomatoes a bit before adding them.  After adding the cream of mushroom soup I added a 1/2 cup of half and half instead of milk.  I think I would either add salt or more garlic next time.  (My husband votes for more garlic!)  All in all it was tasty, the fish didn't taste fishy, and there is lots of sauce left over to have on spaghetti or linguini another night.  Maybe next time I'll add some peeled and deveined shrimp to the mix!

The fish was great. Not fishy. The sauce was good too, especially on spaghetti. I would use more garlic, and I added a can of sliced mushrooms. No complaints from my very picky family!

This was delicious...definitely a keeper!  However it does need more garlic and we also added shrimp and some clams.  Also added some fresh mushrooms.  Very Good!!

We loved this!  Definately go for the Campbell's Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic.  I also added some mixed seafood that I had, some diced bell peppers, mushrooms and some extra garlic.  This was a big hit!

It's okay.  Too garlicky with the mushroom garlic soup.

This is a very bland and uninspired recipe. I can't believe it was even tested first. All I can say is use it as a base and go freestyle. I used salt and pepper, for a start, and some fresh parsley. I used cream instead of milk. I added chopped sun-dried tomatoes for flavor and texture.

Very tasty and easy!  I added red pepper flakes and some adobo, then served over brown rice.  Will make this again.

This dish was amazing! I'm fifteen and I was more than capable of making it. Instead of the flounder, haddock, or halibut, I used cod and it seemed to taste x10 better than I expected.

Nope... the only person in my family who really liked this dish was my teenage son, and HE doesn't know what he's eating -- he only knows that he's SOOOOO HUNGRY. I used flounder, and for some reason it came out pretty fishy. Bad batch of fish?? I don't know. But the mix of tomato and creamy soup was not good. Would try fish with pasta again, but making my own recipe with olive oil, garlic, and lemon with some veggies, maybe.

We thought it was tasty, but too much of some things and not enough of others.

I substituted olive oil for the butter to make this more healthy.  I then added fresh mushrooms.  Very mild, tasty, and not too fishy.

I used scallops and shrimp which I sauteed in garlic white wine and Thai Basil seperately and then added to the sauce which I made exactly to the recipe - found it tasty but wanting so I added some Masala powder to make it sort of a Tikka Masala sauce and it was great - very nice with shrimp and scallops
