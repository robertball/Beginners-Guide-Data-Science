I made this the other night, but made lots of alterations to it.  First I didn't have any chicken on hand, so I used ground beef instead.  Second, I used a can of Rotel for added flavor.  And third, since I've been a little unsure of the Cooking Creme, I used 10 ounces of Breakstone's Sour Cream Southwest Style Dip.  It was really delicious and my picky hubby went back for seconds before I could even finish "firsts."  If you can't find the Southwest Style Sour Cream dip (which I believe is new), you could also use regular sour cream or cream cheese and add chili powder, cumin and other spices to taste.

I made this twice, my family loves it. There's usually leftovers but it don't take long before that's gone. I use shredded co jack instead of the Monterey jack.

This was fast and easy.  It was mild and reminds me of mexican style mac and cheese.  It needs a pick me up like rotel or something to bring on the flavor.

We didn't think this was bad, but it wasn't great, either.  We didn't like the corn with it at all.  I think that the creme with the pasta and chicken by itself would taste better.  All of the ingredients just didn't taste quite right together in our opinion.

My family loved this dish and I loved how easy and quick it was to make!  Due to a picky eater in the family I didn't include any of the vegetables and I increased the chicken to 1 1/3 pound.  I estimated the pasta so I probably added a bit more than the recipe called for.  Nevertheless, it was delicious and I will definitely make this again!  The overall flavor reminded me of fajitas so if you like fajitas you should like this too.

My husband and I loved this dish!! Instead of using green peppers I used orange and yellow peppers. Then instead of diced tomatoes I used a can of Rotel made it extra spicy!

So fast and easy with an amazing Southwest flavor! No revisions or additions needed for this one. I'm looking for more recipes using the cooking cremes after trying this one. Yum yum!

Love this!  I dislike it when people completely alter recipes...but I had to use what was on hand.  The Sante Fe Cooking Creme was very tasty, but some had mentioned that it needed some zip.  I omitted the green peppers, as I didn't have one, but used a hot yellow pepper.  I also didn't have corn.. but I had some left over black beans, which I added when mixing the chicken, pepper, and creme.  I used a can of Rotel tto that mix (some had suggested that) and a couple sprinkles of red pepper flakes.  Mix in the pasta and cheese... PERFECT!  I work very long hours but still like to get dinner on the table for my husband and I.  This was a quick meal and tasty.  He really enjoyed it.  Can't wait to try the other flavors.

I made this dish last night and was quite pleased. I did however make some few changes. I seasoned the chicken with BADIA adobo and about a teaspoon of taco seasoning. I also used a can of ROTEL tomatoes with Chili and Lime flavour. I followed the instructions and added about 1/4 cup of half and hald and chicken broth. I wanted to make the sauce a bit creamier and it turned out delicious. Will definately keep making this dish.
