I make this just as the recipe says except for a few minor changes. I add canned sliced mushrooms and decrease the amount of pepper. We don't like very spicy food. It always turns out great. Oh BTW, I serve it over pasta not rice. Very filling. Serve with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and it's perfect!!!

I seasoned my chicken and browned it very, very well. I then pulled out the chicken and then sauteed my vegies. Added a splash of red wine to the sauce. Very flavorful and delicous Susan. Thank you!

This recipe was very good and my family really enjoyed it. Next time I will add some wine to the sauce for more flavor and use real garlic instead of garlic powder.  Perfect for a quick weeknight meal with little effort.  Susan, thank you for sharing!

Pretty good! Cacciatore literally means "hunter" in Italian. The only thing that is "un-cacciatore" about this recipe is the omission of mushrooms (but I don't care... I DESPISE the things!!!). It has been said that mushrooms were a "typical" ingredient in cacciatore because they were readily available to hunters treking through the forest... but who really knows!?!??! While I liked this version, I did find it necessary to make a few small changes to suit my tastes. Here's what I did: a) tossed chicken cubes and a 1/2 c. flour (would use 1/4 c. next time - 1/2 c. was a bit too much...) seasoned generously with s&p in a lg. Ziplock bag FIRST, b) browned chicken VERY well in a bit of EVOO, c) set chicken aside, then added 2 T EVOO, veggies and 2 cloves minced garlic to skillet and sauteed until tender and d) added chicken back to skillet along with tomatoes, sauce, 1 full tsp. Italian seasoning (didn't use oregano) and a couple "glugs" of cabernet sauvignon. Served over Brazilian white rice by Nandabear (one reviewer suggested serving over garlic rice, hence the idea - check out Nandabear's recipe). This was a very filling meal. Thanks for sharing this quick and easy recipe!

Absolutely delicious!! I loved it. I put in fresh garlic over the powder (2cloves) and didnt have any green peppers but I cant wait to try it with them in. It was so easy, super flavourful, and used pretty basic ingredients we normally have on hand. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I was very pleased :) I'll definitely make this again.. soon!

Love it! I cooked the onion and green pepper a little first to soften them then added the chicken and fresh garlic. I also added Italian seasoning instead of just oregano. This was great.

This was so easy and great, even my 15 month old twins ate it!  I did serve over pasta and added some thyme and rosemary for more flavor.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!  Easy to make, and a little time consuming, but it was worth it.  I doubled the recipe, and it took much longer than anticipated.  I added fresh garlic instead of the powder, and added extra tomato sauce, in place of some of the stewed tomatoes.  I was a little short handed, otherwise I would've used 2 cans of the stewed tomatoes (don't forget I doubled it).
Delicious!  Thanks!

Yes, "cacciatore" does mean "hunter" in Italian.  But, this delightful dish is often over-done.  Dredge the chicken breasts in well-seasoned flour.  Brown quickly on both sides.  Place in baking dish, cover with 1/2 jar of Newman's Own marinara sauce and 1 can of tomato/greenpeppper/onion sauce.
Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.  Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and serve with garlic toast.
THAT is Chicken Cacciatore.

I grew up on this dish with skin on chicken, but now I always remove the skin and leave in the bone, more flavor that way and closer to authentic.  White meat chicken dries out if cooked a minute too long; thighs and legs are more forgiving--and we always had mushrooms in it when we had this as children, but dad never liked the things, so we 3 sisters happily fought over them.  If you like mushrooms, you can add white button or sliced portobellos.  Just sautee them b/4 onions so they brown. Set aside, then proceed with recipe.  I like to then add my peppers back in at the end so they don't turn to mush. A good, healthy, low cal meal.

Great base recipe. I actually threw all of the ingredients in a slow cooker and added about 1/4 cup of red wine.  It was excellent.

I have been making this for years, with two exceptions, I add chopped green olives (about 1/2 cup)  If you do this, you may want to cut back or delete the salt.  Adds a nice punch if you like olives! Also, I brown the chicken well before adding the rest of the ingredients.

The sauce itself was probably the best part- it would make very good spaghetti sauce on its own! We ate it on pasta, not rice.

This was really good and I plan on making it again.  I used italian style stewed tomatoes as that is what I had on hand.  I also used fresh garlic in lieu of the garlic powder and threw in some mushrooms and italian seasoning.  My husband loved it!

This was excellent! I never had chicken cacciatore before and this was so good, my husband and I loved it. Great leftovers too. I chopped the onions instead of slicing them into rings and I added a sweet red pepper as another reviewer suggested. Great, easy recipe, I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks!

I am giving this recipe a five because it is very healthy and tastey. I added three large mushrooms and 1/2 cup white wine. I didn't have a large can of tomato sauce so I added some V8 to make up the difference. I wish this made a larger amount of sauce. Next time I will add more wine and more V8 or tomato sauce.

Good recipe, but the instructions should not say to cook chicken until lightly browned.  That would result in chicken that is not completely cooked through, and no one should eat that.  It's not safe.  The rest of the recipe is fine, but I did have to switch out the green pepper for a red pepper as my family doesn't care for the green ones.  Easy recipe that cooks up quickly.  I usually serve over pasta, but have done rice on occasion.

This was just okay. I even doctored it by using fresh garlic and a lot more spices and it was still rather bland. I will not be making this again.

This was an excellent base to start a cacciatore on.  The only differences I made were to dredge the chicken pieces in flour and fry them in a couple Tbsp of olive oil.  My family of picky eaters loved it.  Thank you.

Good base but, I made a lot modifications. 1: I added mushrooms and carrots (i will also add celery next time) 2: I used fresh garlic 3: I used fresh tomatoes (sauteed with all the other veggies) instead of canned/stewed tomatoes 4: I used tomato paste instead of sauce so I could control the thickness 5: I thinned it with chicken broth 6: I added a little sugar to cut the acid from all the tomato products. It came out thick, chunky, and delicious.

It was simple and easy. My only issue was that it can't all fit in the skillet at the same time. I used a large Lodge cast iron skillet, and honestly I feel like I needed a skillet twice that size. I cooked the chicken first, so I had an issue with everything being the right temperature. It was good, but frustrating.

Um... yum!  OK, I admit it, I didn't follow the recipe to the letter.  After reading the reviews, I made some modifications.  I cubed, floured and seasoned the chicken and browned it a little first then added about 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic for about 30 seconds and then added the rest of the veggies, including chopped mushrooms.  I used Italian stewed tomatoes, just a few dashes of the garlic powder since I had fresh garlic in there already, Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and about 1/2 tsp of sugar to balance the tartness of the tomatoes.  Next time, I will cut back on the pepper since I had salted and peppered the chicken and it was plenty spicy.  Served it with pasta and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make again!

Great, simple recipe!  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of stewed and added a banana pepper which gave it a nice punch, but not too spicy for my kids.  Yum!

Bland.  Add more seasoning, herbs, spices, mushrooms, fresh garlic and this simple recipe earns a fifth star.

The simplicity of this dish was unbelievable.  Next time I might drain 1/2 of the liquid of the tomatoes.  Used 2 cloves of garlic not powder.  Great one pan dish.

Very delicious!  I used two whole tomatoes diced and sauteed in 1 tsp. olive oil instead of canned stewed tomatoes.  I also used fresh garlic and a little extra salt.  Make sure to brown chicken before adding onions.

Made as written the chicken breast did not get flavored by the sauce. Next time I will flour and brown the chicken first and then follow through with the recipe. I also added mushrooms and a bit of dried garlic bits.

This was really good and soooooo simple to make. I did change it a little by cutting chicken and onion into bite size pieces, added a little extra tomato sauce and letting it simmer for 30 minutes to get the flavors set into the meat. A great quick meal!!!!

This made a great weeknight meal.  Easy & fast.  I could anticipate that 1/2 teaspoon of oregano wasn't going to cut it, so I added about a palm full & also added dash or two of dried red pepper flakes.  My kids loved it.
Next time I'm going to add some halved small mushrooms!

Good flavor. I used a garlic clove instead of powder  and added sugar instead of wine because I can not have alcohol. Very tasty and generally easy to make.

love this recipe and it's super easy.  I also had a happy accident with leftovers.  I had a small amount, about 1 cup, leftover and decided to mix it with some leftover chicken/veg soup I'd also made... and voila!  The combo made one of the best soups I've made to date!  Will definitely use this recipe again and again, it's easy, super tasty, and versatile!

I was VERY disappointed in this dish.  It just seemed so bland -- like something was "missing".  I used minced garlic (instead of the powder) and a can of Italian stewed tomatoes (which included oregano, basil and garlic), the only type I had on hand.  I thought that would actually give it a deeper flavor.  My husband doused his with hot sauce and said it was O.K., but I won't be making this again.  There was just no depth of flavor.

Turned out fantastic! My hubby and I both went for seconds. I made a few adjustments due to not having all the ingredients listed. I used two soft tomatoes chopped instead of the stewed, and had a tiny bit less tomato sauce. I cut the onion and pepper into large dice. Tasted fantastic over rice.

Our church prepares meals for the homeless and I use this site a lot since I can easily increase the servings to what we need. We were lucky enough to receive a donation of chicken breasts which is rare. I searched this site  and found this easy and fast recipe. This turned out to be very delicious. The chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderful. We did put it in the oven for an hour after we browned the chicken and added the remaining ingredients. We served it with spaghetti, since that is what we had. The rule is we must taste the food before we send it to the shelter. It was so good I went home and made it for myself. Yum !!!  I will be making this again.

My family enjoyed this very much. We used a bit of red  wine for deglazing, and next time I might use less. It was too tomatoey for me, but I ate it anyway, it was so good. I served it with linguini, which my husband requested. He's not much of a rice person. Will definitely make this again, and add more chicken. We ran out too soon! Thanks for the submission.

This is a super recipe -- so easy and delicious.  I made a couple of changes as did other reviewers:  added a little red wine to the sauce, used fresh garlic, substituted olive oil for butter and added mushrooms.  This will be a go-to recipe for me

My husband and I really liked this.  It's so easy to make and super tasty.  When I order this at my local Italian place, they make it spicy, so I added some cayenne.  I also added mushrooms.  I think it would be great with zucchini in it, too.

Oh, so gooood! I floured the chicken and cooked it 1st then sauted the vegies, added some mushrooms, and the canned tomatoes that I had on hand had jalpenos in them. I did double the onion and bell pepper. I had about a half cup of red wine that had to get used or drank. I used it. Had company for supper and this was a hit. Thanks for sharings

Tasted awesome, the only thing I did was aside from "browning" the chicken and veggies, I threw everything into a crockpot on low for 4 hours. Put it over rice, tasted AMAZING! Will make again!

This was really good, very easy, and I would definately make it again. I made a few small changes - I used coconut oil instead of vegetable because it has extra health benefits without changing the flavor, simmered it for 10 minutes instead of 5 because it looked too thin at 5, and served over pasta instead of rice.

My family just loved this recipe and it was so quick and easy to make!!!  I did make just a few minor revisions.  I used garlic cloves instead of powder and I deglazed the pan with red wine before adding the tomatoes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  I will definitely make his recipe again.  Thank You Susan!

Great, hearty flavor!  As other reviewers suggested, I used real garlic.  I made a few other changes out of necessity.  I used a combo of red and green bell peppers instead of just green.  I substituted Mrs. Dash Italian blend for the oregano.    I will definately make this again, however I will add mushrooms next time.  I also suggest making it ahead of time and letting it sit awhile.  The flavor was better the next day when we ate the leftovers.  FYI - I served it over pasta.

Very delicious! The boyfriend liked it too. I did change some things. I floured the chicken before cooking, and removed it to cook the veggies. I used some minced garlic, zucchini, and mushrooms also. Adding red wine like others suggested was exactly what this recipe probably needed. I also used italian seasonings. Put it over rice...VERY TASTY!

I didn't think this was bland at all!  I thought it had great flavor...how could it not with garlic and oregano!  I followed the recipe as written and served with garlic rice.  It was great.  In the future I would consider adding mushrooms like others have suggested.  I also followed Linda's advice about browning the chicken well.

Susan, this was absolutely the best recipe for cacciatore that I've ever had. MY FAMILY LOVED IT!!!! And now, I'm their hero when it comes to chicken. I tried your recipe just as posted. I usually change a few things or add something here or there, but this recipe looked good like it was and I'm soooo glad I didnn't alter it. I'm a male "chef-wanna-be", and this recipe will go with me where ever I go! Thanks again, Susan.

Very good.   I added more garlic powder and used a 3-blend pepper and onion mix.   Also cooked longer than 5 minutes as I feel canned tomatoes and sauce need time to blend with the spices and 5 minutes isn't enough.

With some modifications I'd give this recipe a five stars. I stewed fresh chopped tomatoes (15-20 mins) in chicken broth added a large onion (minced), green peppers (minced), dried oregano, minced garlic, fresh cilantro, sour cream, hot pepper (pepper jack) cheese, a little sharp cheddar cheese, a dash of salt and pepper. (Sorry, I don't measure, just go by taste). Added the cooked chicken and let it simmer about 15 minutes. Served over rice and it was divine. Huge hit and very flavorful.

This was ok, I should have floured and browned the chicken as others suggested but I just didnt have the time.  I made this recipe as written and found that it was bland.  I even used the tomato sauce and diced tomateos that had itialian seasoning in them.  While it was cooking, I tasted the sauce and added more of the seasoning and also added red pepper flakes.  With this addition, the sauce turned out great but the chicken itself had no flavor while you were eating it.  I definitely feel that if I had used seasoned flour on the chicken and cooked it separately from the veggies, it would have tasted better.  I served this over whole wheat pasta with some parmesian cheese.  I will give this another try and see if it comes out any better.

Excellent. Quick, easy and even my very picky husband liked it. I make it with red instead of green pepper because nobody in my house likes green peppers but otherwise I make it exactly as per the recipe.

I use drumsticks in place of the breasts and instead of the tomato juice and canned tomatoes I just use V8.  I also let it simmer for a lot longer, up to an hour and at home we always had this served with french fries so since that's what I grew up with, that's how I serve it to my family now.  The sauce is excellent over the fries as well!

I have made this dish twice and it was a hit at my house both nights. Followed the recipe the first night, but on the second go round I switched to pork and egg noodles rather than chicken and rice.  Just as good and it makes some wonderful leftovers. Can't wait to ty it with shrimp.

This is better than our favorite restaurant's cacciatore.  I used garlic cloves instead of the powder and added mushrooms, olives and a splash of red wine.  Served it over angel hair noodles.  It was the best meal I have ever made.

I used a red pepper and added summer squash and fresh tomatoes rather than can stewed.  Browned the onion, pepper and squash before adding.  It's yummy!

I've made this a few times now.  It's delicious as is, however, i've also added cashews and mushrooms at times. The cashews are a great addition.  I've also made it with a can of diced tomatoes I had on hand instead of the stewed tomatoes.  Tasted just as good.

I used two regular chicken breasts that I cut into big chunks, bone, skin, and all, floured them and browned them. The only other thing I changed was I also used minced (jar) garlic. I did cover the pan and simmer for about 40 minutes to let the chicken get good and tender. I served it with rice and some oven sweet potato fries. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

this was very tasty, made it last night although i made some changes.  i cubed the chicken in the morning and seasoned it with adobo, garlic powder and oregano then left it in the fridge.  i used 2 garlic cloves and 1 teaspoon garlic powder also a little extra oregano and i salted the veggies before adding the sauce too.  when i first tasted it, i was a little disappointed but i had it left over and it was AMAZING.  my husband even took it to work for lunch.  it was a littel chunky and oily, next time i'll maybe used diced tomatoes? and olive oil instead of veg... thanks for the recipe.

this recipe was ok.  i didn't have any boneless chicken on hand so i used the bone-in chicken.  i followed the recipe as is and the flavor was kind of lacking and needed a little something extra.

I was wanting to make something using a pound of sweet italian sausage I had on hand. Couldn't find a recipe that was what I was looking for-saw this and figured why not? Used my sausage in place of the chicken. It was yummy! The only other difference was I used minced garlic in addition to some garlic powder. Could still have used a little more-I really like garlic. Also, one pound of sausage wasn't enough for my family-will use at least 1 1/2 pounds next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy! My family enjoyed this dish. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic in with the veggies instead of using garlic powder. I also used a can of fire roasted tomatoes in place of the stewed because that is what I had in the pantry. I also added an additional 1/2 tsp. basil ,1/4 tsp rosemary, and a bit of crushed red pepper (we like spicy)Thanks for the recipe..it is now one of our go-to meals.

I loved this recipe, even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I usually try to but I did not have green peppers. I did, however, have fresh baby zucchini, so i decided to substitute that for the green pepper. OH MY GOSH! Talk about AMAZING! Even my boyfriend who HATES zucchini loved this. Technically I didn't make cacciatore since I didn't use green pepper but I could eat it by itself in a bowl without the rice or pasta haha

This was very good and easy.  I didn't add the can of tomato sauce or green peppers (my family doesn't like them).  I used diced tomatoes (w/garlic and onions b/c that is what I had in the cabinet).  I also took someone else's suggestion and added some white wine that I had in the fridge, about 1/4 cup.  My whole family loved it and it was low points for weight watchers.  Thanks!

Delicious and so easy! I followed the advice of others and sauted the veggies first, and added about 1/4 a cup of red wine. I also used regular can tomatoes rather than stewed. Will make again.

Very easy to make and delicious!  I love this recipe because it doesn't have a ton of ingredients and it's a crowd pleaser!  I use a little more oregano and  pepper to make it more flavorful.  Perfect over rice or pasta, whatever you prefer.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish...unfortunately I misplaced my oregano so I had to use a 5 Italian herb blend  seasoning but it was a great substitution. Very flavorful. We also put if over pasta rather than rice and it worked well.

I thought this was very bland.  The only deviation I made from the original recipe was the addition of some fresh basil which helped a bit, but not much. there was little flavor to this dish, it just tasted like chicken and tomatoes.

This is a good recipe for using up those veggies that are left in the refrig...I add some zucchini and squash and then just used Barilla tomatoe basil sauce and a table spoon red wine. Very quick and healthy! Thanks!

My husband and I really fell for this one. I've made it several times and liked it better each time. I also added a tablespoon of red wine and found it really added to it. Also liked minced garlic as well. Thank you, Susan!

Everyone enjoyed this dish. I used chicken tenders (not breaded) and used another reviewers suggestion and lightly floured the tenders and browned them in the pan with evoo. I also sauteed the green pepers, onions and added some mushrooms. I made white rice along with bow tie noodles and everyone wanted the noodles. This will be a regular dish at our house, thanks for sharing.

Good basic recipe. Easy and quick. 
Can add extra garlic, red peppers, and pepper flakes (spice). I prefer Redpack crushed tomatoes in puree over stewed tomatoes. I also lightly flourered the chicken and browned it in Olive oil first.

This is perfect when you have virtually no time, virtually no ingredients and even if you have virtually no cooking skills.  It's yummy and satisfying.

Yummy recipe.  The only thing I did different was replace the stewed tomatoes with a can of diced tomatoes seasoned with green pepper and onion.  We served over farfalle pasta and will do again next time I make this.  There will definitely be a next time.

This is good and easy to make, although the prep time took me far longer than 15 minutes. Maybe I'm just slow when it comes to cutting and chopping. I've had it both with rice and linguine, and both have tasted good!

YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY.  I followed the receipt exactly, but I did add some minced garlic, and since I doubled the recipe I added a red pepper.  I could not stop eating this.  Loved it and I will be making this more often. Thank you for sharing

This is a big hit in my home. I use stewed tomatoes that are italian seasoned in the can and also add fresh garlic to the peppers and onions. I also use chicken thigh meat instead of breast meat as my family prefers the dark meat in this dish. Very filling meal and tastes even better as leftovers!

Delicious and easy to make! I added a few ingredients - mushrooms and a little bit of celery, plus a bit extra pepper because we're spicy food fans. I served it for dinner and everyone loved it - and can't wait for the leftovers!

This recipe was a huge hit with family and a dinner guest. My very picky 2.5 year old loved it! I followed the recipe except for adding two sliced stalks of celery. It was very flavorful and satisfying. I served it over brown rice.

Pretty good. I served with rice and a side of veggies. I did add minced garlic and not garlic powder. Also, I floured the chicken before cooking as other reviewers suggested. The last modification I did was using diced tomatoes because I didn't have stewed tomatoes. Next time I make this dish, I would really like to have fresh stewed tomatoes and fresh tomato sauce.

This is a great recipe.  I did cook the chicken breast first (I used frozen chicken tenderoins that had been thawed) then removed them from the skillet and added 1/4 cup cabernet wine to scrape off the brown bits of chicken then added the vegetables.  Followed the recipe after that and it was delicious.  I served it over noodles instead of rice and it was a great hit.

Outstanding!  Based on reviews I made minor modifications by adding a splash of red wine and floured the chicken--which thickens the sauce nicely.  Makes yummy leftovers...quick, easy, and delicious!

We added sauteed mushrooms and used 3 colors of sweet peppers.  We substituted fresh garlic and added extra Italian seasoning.  Also, added some red wine.  Much easier than other chicken cacciatore recipes we've tried, and more flavorful.  The boneless, skinless chicken breasts were much easier to use than a cut-up chicken and made it easier to serve.  Will use this one again.

I loved this recipe, especially because it was so easy to throw together, and healthy, too! I added poultry seasoning to the chicken, and used half red bell pepper and half green pepper. It was nice and zesty, and I felt like my kids were getting some good veggies, too.

I may use diced tomatoes next time, instead of stewed, simply because my 3-year-old is suspicious of really chunky food. Otherwise, this was a hit!

This was a nice change to regular spaghetti.  You can definitely play with it to suit your own taste.  Very yummy and hubby liked it too!

This was good. I didn't cook the vegetables long enough, but that was my own fault. I will definitely make this again! Very quick and easy!

My husband and I enjoyed this, but next time I will make some modifications.  Some of the users added a splash of red wine, and I will try that, because I felt it was missing something, so that will hopefully help.  This recipe would even be good over pasta.  I give it 4 1/2 stars.
