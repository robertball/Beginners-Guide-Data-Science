This was pretty good. It makes way more than 2 servings though. I halved the pasta and sauce and had enough for 4 servings. I added a wee bit of Parmesan cheese before serving.

I probably have no right to rate this recipe since I altered just about everything, but I suspect my complaint would be the same even if I had followed it. The sauce seemed more like uncooked scrambled eggs to me than a sauce. It tasted fine, but I was so unhappy with the texture that I wound up cooking the sauce longer until it became scrambled eggs. I used canola oil instead of butter, added a clove of garlic, used a bland sliced deli meat and used 1 c plain yogurt + 1 c whole milk instead of sour cream. Taste wise, mine needs some more seasoning, but I'll bet with a flavorful salami, no extra seasoning would be needed.

I don't know if I did something wrong... I don't think so, the recipe is pretty straightforward, and I've done a fair amount of cooking.  But I did not care for this dish.
