Excellent!  The potatoes make the patties creamy.  Because of the reviews, I only put in one potato so I could still taste the salmon.  I also added a chopped onion for flavor.  Make sure you chop it really fine so it doesn't interrupt the creamy texture.  Also, you don't need that much oil.  I just put in enough to coat the pan.

Overall very tasty!  But 5 large potatoes
is too much.  We could barely taste the
salmon b/c the potatoe over-powered the
overall taste.  I would use only 3.

This was actually quite good.  But I did tweak it a little.  Gotta have onions in a salmon cake!  I added a small, finely chopped onion and some parsley, and coated the cakes in cornmeal instead of flour to give it some texture.  Yum.  Not bland, but a slightly 'muted' salmon flavor.  Great w/homemade tarter sauce.  I confess I had seconds!

I found this recipe to be very good. I live in an area where pacific salmon is very prevelant and I needed a recipe that would use up the leftovers from my catch of salmon. This was great. My family and I are not the greatest salmon fanciers and enjoyed how this recipe did not have an overpowering taste of salmon. If you like but dont love salmon this is a good recipe, mind you when frying the patties, they absorb a tremedous amount of oil. Make sure you pan is hot.

I tried a variation of this recipe using only one large potato and some matzo meal.  Even with that variation, the cakes had too much potato flavor. I find it hard to believe that you're supposed to mix five potatoes to one average-sized can of salmon. Why even bother to add the salmon at all in this recipe? It's simply a waste --- you CAN'T TASTE THE SALMON!!!

These were very tasty.  i made a few changes.  i drained all the water from the potatoes and left none.  i added about a tsp. of Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing mix to the flour before coating the cakes.  Then, i fried them in extra-virgin olive oil.  We really enjoyed them!

The patties tasted good, but they would have been even better with less potatoes.  It tasted like a potato pattie instead of fish pattie.

The fish cakes did taste nice, but the preparation was a bit of a nightmare. Frying them took ages and also caused some of them to burn, it may take practice, but its not the easiest recipe in the world.

This recipee was very good.  I don't like a strong salmon flavor in patties and the potatoes really helped remedy this.  I added a little Italian bread crumbs for more flavor and that tasted exellent.  I made fairly large patties and I ended up with 14 patties just from one can of salmon.  This is definitely a recipee I will make again.

Yum yum! I do recommend adding seasoning to your liking. One thing I think most people are missing is that the recipe calls for a very large can of salmon (14.75 oz). The usual size is only 5 oz. If you use the large size can then 5 potatoes is probably fine.  I used 2 potatoes and 2 5 oz. cans of salmon. That ratio was pretty good. I added parsley, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne. I also added about 1 T milk to help the potatoes stick together, and I used crushed gold fish crackers on the outside instead of flour. I only used 3-4 T oil to fry them. Perfection.

The texture and taste is good but mine didn't stick together when I cooked it.  I'm going to have to give it another try.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it! I agree with others in that the potatoes are too much. I had a large group coming so I used 4 potatoes with "two" cans of salmon. I also tweaked it a little and added a little mayo in the mix for creaminess and texture,I also  added chopped green onion, and coated with corn meal instead of flour - alot of tweaking I know but the family loved it !!

These were a LOT tastier than I expected, but also more labor intensive.  Plus I had to modify the amounts b/c I only had a small can of salmon.  So I don't think the texture was quite right, they were extremely hard to make into patties.  I ended up adding another egg and some flour just so they would hold together until I turned them.  I DID add some minced garlic, onion, jalapeno and cilantro.  Yum.  Even the kids liked them!

It was late one evening, well past dinnertime, when I realized I was hungry and had nothing in the cupboards except a 2 year old can of salmon that had somehow survived moves into two different apartments.  I made this recipe, which was super easy, but definitely did not use 5 potatoes, as all I had was one.  I added some breadcrumbs because it wasn't "caking" well, too wet.  A little diced onion, dry dill, and a touch of minced garlic.  The dish was OK.  I ended up busting out some cocktail sauce I had in the fridge and it seemed to save the day.  Tartar sauce would be more fitting. Overall, it beats a can of spaghetti-o's for a last minute meal, but definitely not something to mess your pants about.

Had these salmon cakes for dinner tonight and they were really good except they need more salt and pepper in the mix.  I only used 3 small potatoes and think more would overpower the salmon.  I served it with cole slaw and stewed tomatoes.

Great with some additions.  Added minced garlic, onion and breadcrumbs.  Coated patties in crushed corn flakes before frying.  My kids loved it!!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the idea.

I LOVE this recipe! Something a little different with salmon.  This is a mild recipe even the kids will love, there is plenty of room to add whatever type of seasoning you prefer, more salt and pepper, dill, garlic, hot peppers, or as is.  It's sticky once mixed, but after dipping in the flour and frying, it becomes a light crispy dish with tender creamy inside, suitable for eating alone as a patty, or on toast or a bun.  Extremely versatile and flavorful for the baby or Dad! Thanks for this recipe!

I made this tonight.  I changed things a bit.  Instead of canned salmon,I used some salmon that I had in the freezer, marinated it in a garlic herb marinade and baked it.  I didn't use as much potato as the recipe called for.  I also added some garlic, onion and dill to the recipe.  It was good.  Next time I want to make a spicy sauce/salsa to serve with it.

I am not a fan of salmon cakes, but with the addition of potatoes I tried it.  I did change the original recipe a bit.  I used less potatoes and added Old Bay seafood seasoning to the mixture. I chilled the mixture making it easier to form.  I coated the patties in a mixture of flour, corn meal and Old Bay.  The whole family loved them.

These were yummy!! :) I had a bunch of potatoes that needed to be used and cans of salmon, so this was PERFECT. A nice change from regular salmon patties too... I did use green onions and only three potatoes.

Really delicious!  I also added one large potato and an onion that was finely diced.  I added flour to the ingredients and then spooned it in to a lightly greased pan.  It turned out great!

Last minute meal and my kids and husband liked it!  They are tough critics with salmon, so the fact they liked it is amazing!  I took the suggestion of only using three potatos, and it tasted good.  I addd garlic powder, salt, parsley flakes, and onion.  I also didn't use flour because I need to cook gluten free, and they held together fine.  A good, fast easy meal!

I added a little old bay seasoning and used fresh cooked salmon.  I also used leftover mashed potatoes instead of cooking them fresh here.  A good basic recipe.

Wonderful - add a little more seasoning for flavor, like onion salt and garlic, but otherwise, very good

This recipe is definitely for people who do not like fish because I could not taste it at all and I only used 1 potato! I'm also very glad I made a tarter sauce since even with the addition of onion and parsley, these tasted very bland and a little dry. Probably will not make again.

These were so good!  If your patties fall apart, I suggest adding an extra egg or two (I doubled the recipe anyway)  and instead of making patties, make balls, roll the balls in flour and flatten with a spatula when you place them in the grease.  The ones I did that to were perfect!  Hubby and kids made sure there were no leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.

Very little flavor with the original recipe.  Tasty only in the sense that fried things are tasty.

The taste was good, but it didn't hold together very well.

Not enough flavour and too many potatoes in recipe as written. I used leftover mashed potatoes (maybe 2-3) and added some garlic, parsley and onion.

Very good. Reminds me of potato Ladakhs, but with salmon added! Made these into a yummy sandwich!I only had 1 potato and one 6oz can of salmon. SoI peeled the potato and microwaved for 12 mins. I wasn't about to use only 1/2 egg, so I used 1 whole egg obviously! Then I added some garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and about 1/4 of finally minced white onion. The pattys were kinda dry and falling apart as I pressed them together, so I added a big dollop of sour cream. Worked like a charm. I fried until outside was crispy. I then placed the salmon patty on toasted dill rye bread that I dressed with Dijon mustard, mayo, creamy  horseradish, and tomatoes that were lightly salted and peppered. De-lish! Would have loved some butter lettuce, but I was all out.

My 6 year old loved it! (After having a not so fantastic experience with baked salmon last week.) I loved it too, and it was super easy, considering I am not much of a "cook." I used instant potatoes because that is what I had on hand, and I was trying to figure out dinner at the very last minute....Yum!

Thank you for a canned salmon recipe that my significant other will eat! After reading the comments, I tried it with two medium potatoes, and it came out rather well. I did add a little bit of garlic to it (because I am a garlic fanatic), and the cakes were still bland. Next time going to experiment more, but am going to continue using it!

great recipe I make a slight change instead of flour I used about 1/4 cup of vegetable thin crackers crushed mix in with the rest and fry.
