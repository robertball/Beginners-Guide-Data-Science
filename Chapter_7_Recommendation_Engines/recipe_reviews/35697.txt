I made a couple of changes (used seasoned bread crumbs instead of crackers and didn't use cornstarch at all), but this recipe was wonderful! I don't much care for the 'gamey' taste of deer, but have a freezer full of it to cook. This took out the gamey taste and was just great! I will definitely cook this again!

This recipe was loved by my whole family - even my wife who does not like the gamey taste. 

I did customize this recipe a bit though. 1. marinate in apple juice over night, turn once. 2. I added 1 sm.can diced tomatoes. 3. 1 can mushroom soup

Be carefull when you place venison cubes into frying skillet, that there is room to turn them to brown, otherwise the breading will fall off. 

Will make this again!

This was an excellent recipe, my family wouldn't quit raving about it.  I used Elk, instead of venison, which my dad hunts every year.  He, my step-mom, and husband all loved this dish.  It's worth the effort that goes into it.

I have not tried this recipe.. but to be fair I rated it 5 because it sounds delish!  I did want to comment to those that find venison (or elk) meat gamey.  I have been eating wild meat for years.  My grandma taught me a trick she's used for years.  She will either soak the meat overnight (or all day) in either milk or salted water.  I use the salted water.  The salt helps pull the blood out of the meat, and in turn eliminates most of the gamey taste.  As the day goes on, empty the water, rinse, and add the more salted water.  The milk works well too, but milk is a little expensive and it seems like such a waste!  Best of luck using these techiniques!

I rated this 5 stars because for the type of dish it is, it's really good.  I made a couple of changes.  I didn't have any crackers so I used whole wheat bread crumbs.  I also used fresh mushrooms, which I think make it much better than canned mushrooms.  The gravy was just the right consistancy.  We served it with potatoes and sauteed beans.  My hubby doesn't like venison, but we have a farm and let people hunt so they give us venison.  He liked it fixed this way.

I liked the idea of coating the venison first -- tasted so good and was a hit with my husband! I usually just shake the meat in flour before cooking, but this was different. Thanks.

Good flavor but kind of a mushy dish. Mine came out a little oily but meat tasted good.

I made this for husband and he thought it wasn't bad.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also substituted canned beef broth.  The sauce was good, but the meat didn't turn out as tender as I thought it would have from the other reviews.

My husband is not a huge fan of venison, but he loved this.  It stays moist, and melts in your mouth!

I marinated the venison in apple juice with garlic and herbs seasoning. I also used bread crumbs. It was awesome to say the least......
