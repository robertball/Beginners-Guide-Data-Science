Add honey at the end. 1 tbsp was too sweet for me. You may not need to add it at all as bananas are quite sweet...

I just made this and it's fantastic!  I was going to make banana bread but didn't have enough ingredients for that so I just made the smoothie.  I also didn't have a blender but - no worries!  I took a bell canning jar and put all the ingredients in it and shook it vigorously.  Voilia!  my own hand made blender.  Might-ee fine.  Yeah!  I just used to spoon to scoop out the unblended banana.

This is a good basic recipe for a banana smoothie with the addition of pistachios. I love using my overripe bananas for drinks like this. I followed the recipe exactly (except for cutting it down to 1 serving) and blended it for 2 minutes. The pistachios were perfectly blended into the drink and the flavor was still there. While pistachios aren't something I'll add again, I'm sure others will like this flavor twist.

I used my Magic Bullet for this one! I had one blackening banana in my fridge and didn't want it to go to waste. So, I divided the recipe and made one serving instead of two. I used almond milk, chopped up my own, unsalted pistachios, and added chia seeds at the very end. So easy and so delicious!

I will definitely make this again. Simple and yummy with ingredients I had in plenty. I used frozen bananas and oat milk (just because I didn't have regular milk) and it was really good.

A nice change from your standard smoothie. This is more of a milkshake, and I really liked it! My bananas were fairly small, so I had to add a small amount of frozen banana. I didn't add honey until the end and only a small amount because it had enough sweetness already. I skipped the pistachios but did add one scoop of protein powder. I liked this for the subtle banana flavor and the non-icy or frosty texture. I will definitely make again. Thank your husband for the recipe, Autumn Leaves, and the scoop of ice cream on top sounds good, too! UPDATE 2/24/16: I've made this quite a few times since I found the recipe. I likr that it's not thick and icy, how smoothies can be. Today I also added a small container of plain Greek yogurt that needed to be used. That gave it a very slight tang but no thickness (and more protein).

I make smoothies 5 mornings a week with bananas, fruit, milk and yogurt.
I like to peel and freeze the bananas for thicker drinks.  Also prevents wasting overripe bananas.
