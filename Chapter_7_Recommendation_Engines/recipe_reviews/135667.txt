Thsi was a bit too sweet for me so I added an oz of Absolut vodka...it was absolutely perfect after that. LOL I had a feeling the grenadine was going to sink, not float & even though I poured it very carefully onto the back of a spoon, I was right. It immediately sank to the bottom. Could be the fault of the bartender though...a fancy, flair bartender, I am not. Maybe I need more practice? LOL I think it looks just as pretty down there as it would floating on top though. ;o) I garnished w/ a marashino cherry & a sprig of chocolate mint. Thansk for a recipe I'll enjoy again & again, J. Kunkle. BTW love the name!

This was excellent, although I'm not sure I ended up with the right drink.  The only banana liquor I could find was banana flavored rum, so used 2 oz. of it instead of everything else. It turned out like the picture and was very punch like.  In fact, it would make a great punch for a bridal shower or a wedding. You could really get the ladies hammered!

The drink is okay.  I like to add soda water (club soda) to my drinks or instead of juice to make sure they are not too sweet

We absolutely LOVED this recipe.  Also, we tried the variation with a little absolut, and it was just as good, if not quite as sweet.  Quickly becoming a party favorite.  Well Done!

This recipe is better named than "Z-Street Slammer" though similar in construction. It looks better too!

I first ordered this in a restaurant in my city. I was telling friends about  it and they suggested that I google the recipe. I am so glad that I did. This tastes exactly like the one that the restaurant served.

I don't like strong drinks. This is a keeper.

Not bad. Grenadine has a higher specific gravity than any of the other ingredients though so I’m pretty sure that part is an error. Anyone having a hard time finding banana liqueur should find 99 bananas is pretty readily available in most stores.

I followed the recipe exactly however I added a very generous splash of ginger beer and man oh man was it good.  Goes down very easy so FYI.

Very good. I am not a fan of bananas, but thought I would try this and  it is very sweet and delicious. You barely taste the alcohol or bananas...Nice one. Will definitely make again
