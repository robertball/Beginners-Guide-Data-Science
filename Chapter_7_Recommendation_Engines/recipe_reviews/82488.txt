This is wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again. It reminded me of somewhat of a stuffed bread. It set up very nicely and was easy to serve. What a great way to use up the zuchinni from the garden. We ate it the next day and it taste even better. Husband and the boys loved it. Thanks for the recipe !  Lorraine

Great recipe! Few changes - I made the pie crust using a food processor recipe from this site. I also used about 2 tsp of dried basil and omitted the pesto. I also used about 6 eggs and used whole milk instead of cream. I also topped with some slices of roma tomatoes to give it color but also add a hit of acidity. Overall - delicious!

This was really, really good. I would definitely make it again because it was relatively simple for something that involved a crust, and it's always nice to have a variety of ways to use up zucchini. I made it with lower-fat turkey sausage and it still tasted great. My only suggestion for improvement would be to watch your baking time. 35 minutes plus an additional fifteen minutes would have been way too long in my oven. Luckily, I peeked at it 20 minutes into the cooking time and realized the top was already getting very brown, so I put the tin foil on it at that point and then baked it only an additional 10 minutes. So it was 30 minutes total cooking time in my oven, plus resting.
