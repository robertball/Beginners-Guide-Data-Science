Excellent recipie!!  All you need is salt & pepper and of course the amount of Balsamic can be adjusted to suite one's taste.  Rather than boil the potatoes, a much faster alternative is to just prick each potato and microwave them.  Potatoes are less "soggy" and retain their moisture.  Wait until they are cooler, dice them et voila...done.  Far less work, not to mention heating up the kitchen. Also, you can substitute green onions and Dijon mustard...equally excellent results!!

Delicious!! I was assigned potato salad for a picnic and I hate potato salad and refuse to eat anything with mayo in it, so I did some research and found this recipe, with all things I love in it. It was a huge hit, especially with all the other people who are not fans of your average potato salad.  I made three minor adjustments, I used kalamata olives, since those are my favorite, I used white balsamic, since I thought it would make a prettier presentation, and I discovered at the last second I was out of mustard powder, so I used a heaping tablespoon of dijon mustard.  It was great, will make again.  Plus it is picnic friendly!!

I made this recipe and it was fabulous! I roasted the red peppers myself and used 2 shallots instead of the white onion because I find this onion too sharp tasting to use uncooked. I sure red onions would be even better. I used the microwaving technique suggested by some other people to cook the potatoes and it really kept the potatoes from getting mushy. However, make sure to test each of the potatoes for doneness because a few of the bigger potatoes weren't quite cooked long enough for my taste. This recipe was fantastic none the less! Thanks Peregrintook!

I really liked this, but it didn't receive any favorable comments or requests for the recipe when I served it for guests.  It is very different from traditional potato salad, so maybe that's why they didn't seem to like it much.  One lady said it wasn't moist enough for her (she prefers traditional potato salad with lots of mayo.) Definitely needs salt!!!

This was different but good. Let it sit for 24-36 hours before touching and that seemed to help the flavors meld together. I do think this recipe would turn off a lot of people.

I didn't like the combined flavors.  I had high hopes for this one.  It's probably just a personal taste issue.

This is a nice change from traditional potato salad, with two daughters that will not eat mayonnaise or hard boiled eggs it's a winner. I used red wine vinegar, (taste preference) and added salt and pepper to taste. The suggestion to microwave the potatoes works well and cuts down on the dishes. I wasn't sure about which artichokes to use marinated or unmarinated I used marinated but I think either would be good. Thanks for the recipe.

Hubby said this was a "do again"! Might try the white balsamic vinegar, though, as the salad would probably be "prettier".

I just made this dish and thought it was excellent! I don't like olives, so I left them out, but it was still great. I was eager to try it so I actually ate it warm and liked it that way too. Was worried about the combination of ingredients, but would definitely recommend this recipe, yummy!

Delicious!  I sauteed the onions and peppers as I didn't have roasted peppers and don't care for raw onions.  Because I found this recipe so late in the day we actually ate it warm, and everyone raved about how good it was.  I must say that the left overs which were equally delicious today for lunch!

I must share what I did with this super recipe.  I made it as is to take on a camping trip.  It was wonderful(my husband agree) the first night with our marinated barbaqued chicken.  The next night we had steak.  I heated the leftover potato salad in a skillet when the olive oil was hot.  After heating a few minutes I added some sour cream.  It was so good "the second time around" with our steak. I have to say, Yum,O.

We've made this quite often and it's one of our favorites for summer BBQs. We sometimes use jars of an antipasto mix instead of the olive/red pepper/artichoke heart mix described below. Definitely give the flavors time to mix. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is delicious. Perhaps those of you who found it bland or unappealing neglected to SEASON both the potato mixture AND the dressing with salt and pepper, as those instructions were not included in the original recipe. It is very important to layer your seasonings. I had bought the feta, anticipating that it would be needed for more flavor, but with the S&P, it was not. Next time, I, too, would use white balsamic for the presentation. I did micro the potatoes, also. Very nice salad.

So simple to make and incredibly delicious!  I used about 3/4 cup of Newman's Own Balsamic Vinegarette dressing in place of the Oil, Vinegar and seasonings.

I was excited to try this salad, since I love all the ingredients listed.  I tried some right away and again a day later, and I just didn't like the way the flavors mixed.  I only added half of the balsamic vinegar and it was still overpowering.

This is one good potato salad - I was looking for something just like this with no mayonnaise - to me the regular potato salads pretty much taste very similar to each other - I even heated this up with some white sausages and it was great cold or hot - can't beat that.  Thanks so much for this excellent recipe.

I had high hopes for this recipe as my son doesn't care for any mayo or miracle whip. What a disaster. All it tasted like, when I finally got past the way it looked, was vinegar.

Make sure to prepare this a couple days before it is to be served.  The longer it sits the more time the flavors have to meld together.  I also added Bleu cheese and real crumbled bacon.  Very delicious!!

This is a nice change for potato salad if you're in the mood for Mediterranean flavors.  I subbed sundried tomatoes for the roasted red peppers.  Gets better with age and a great option for warm weather picnics due to the lack of mayo.

Delicious — only giving it three because i can't believe garlic was left out. also added some crushed red pepper to make it a little spicier. but all in all a very refreshing, delicious potato salad. add green beans if you like them!

It was very good!!!  Found out at the last minute I was out of balsamic vinegar and all I had was regular, malt, apple cider, white wine and red wine vinegar so went with the red wine vinegar which gave it probably not as heavy a taste.

I didn't mind it and that's the best response it got from my family. No one else liked it at all.  An odd texture and combination of flavors.

It's not a typical potato salad, and I strongly suggest adding more veggies or some feta.  However, it is still delicious!

I choose this recipe because I’m not a fan of traditional potato salad.  Unfortunately I didn't care for this one either.  I enjoy each of the ingredients in this salad but the flavors never really melded together.  It wasn’t bad just not great.  Also, it isn’t a "pretty" salad.

I've been making this recipe for two summers now (yes, it's a good accompaniment for grilled foods) and my wife and I love it. As usual, I would suggest making this as is first, then try substitutions and amount variations.  I was surprised that I enjoyed the olives in this!

Thank you Peregrintook for this recipe. It was delicious. I was looking for something to feed vegans, and this fit the bill.  Besides nuking the potatoes, the only changes I made were to use red onion, plus I added about a tsp of oil from both the red peppers and artichoke hearts so that it was less dry.  I'll definitely make it again.

I really liked this recipe as a starting point.  My husband doesn't like mayo and we love Balsamic Vinegar so I thought I would give this one a shot.  I did make some changes.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave like others suggested and was happy with that (it was a very hot day and I wasn't dying to set up a pot of boiling water) method.  Do remember to check the potatoes to make sure that they are cooking evenly.  I cooked them in the microwave in 5 minute increments and then tested them.  I also chunked the potatoes, not diced. I had some fresh garden picked green beans so I added those to the potato mix.  I used fresh red pepper instead of roasted red pepper because I happened to have one on hand - I was happy with that and would do it again. I used kalamata olives, again, had them on hand and we love them. They are so much more flavorful than canned black olives.  Don't skip the artichokes, they add a great taste.  For the dressing, I added together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, 3 fresh garden basil leaves instead of parsley, a teaspoon of dijon mustard (approx), and a small amount of pure maple syrup for a drop of sweet.  I pureed it all together in my Magic Bullet and it made a fantastic balsamic dressing. I poured it on the potato mixture and let it marinate for the day. We had it for dinner as a side and we all loved it.  Also, you can add salt and pepper to taste but be careful with the salt if you are using kalamata olives, they are salty already.

Delicious! I didn't use artichokes only because I don't care for them.  Added Mediterranean Herb Feta cheese. Absolutely loved it!

I used equal amounts of EVOO and Balsamic Vinegar.  Everything else was as the recipe suggested.  Got good reviews from guests and would surely make it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was great! With a bit of experimentation of my own, as well as, a lack of ingredients, I didn't use any of the veggies except the onion. I wanted it to be a bit more creamy so I added some fat free half and half and about 2 tbs. ranch dressing. So goooooood.

I liked it pretty well, though it was a strong flavor. I added a little brown sugar to the dressing to tone down the vinegar a tad. The vinegar has quite a bite, a little too strong for my taste. Definitely different than regular potato salads, so keep that in mind!

This was delicious! I used purple potatoes from the CSA, red onion, and fresh herbs, so it was very pretty. The vinegar flavor is just right, and I love the veggie combo. The only change I'd make is I'd add more red pepper; the sweetness is a nice complement to the tangy vinegar and artichoke hearts.

Very tasty change from traditional mayo potato salads.  We thought the blend of flavors was excellent.  Presentation was pretty too with lots of fresh parsley sprinkled on each serving.  (I used Yukon Gold potatoes and left the cubes fairly large to allow for stirring several times while chilling to distribute the dressing evenly but not end up with mush.)

Delicious! You can also use fresh mustard instead of the powder. Since red potatoes are not as readily available in Europe, you can also use regular ones. I prepared them in the automatic steamer at 100 degrees (Celcius) for 30 minutes and they turned out great!
