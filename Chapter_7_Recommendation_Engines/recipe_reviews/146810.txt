This recipe ROCKS!!! If there were 10 stars, I'd give it that!!! We've been buying a tiny tub of a very delicious cilantro lime pesto at our local gourmet grocery store, to the tune of 4-5 bucks . . . I just purchased my first food processor and thought it would be fun to try and find a similar recipe, for my processor's maiden voyage! This one exceeded my expectations! The jalapeno adds a nice, surprising kick that the grocery store version doesn't have. Thanks a million for sharing!

Good recipe; nice and spicy.  I did add a little salt.  Good with meats and I even mixed some in with my salad greens.

Recipe was really good.  I tossed it with whole wheat rotini pasta and grilled chicken but somewhere between here and the grocery store I lost my jalapeno so I had to make it without...Im sure it will be MUCH better with it next time....Ill definitely make this one again!

Wow. This is so good. I love cilantro. Unfortunately, I have a cilantro hater in the family which makes it challenging to get my cilantro fix. Lol. I actually like this better then regular pesto. I had toasted pumpkin seeds (so good) versus the pine nuts. I also used roasted/grilled garlic. My jalapeno was wimpy; so wound up using the whole pepper. I added a touch of kosher salt to the party and had to put the spoon down and walk away! Lol. It's that good. Thanks for an awesome recipe to get my cilantro fix.

This recipe is AMAZING! I did add a little extra parmesean cheese and my cilantro bunch was huge. I am going to mix this in some yogurt and make a dip out of it. I could eat it as is! It absolutely needs a 1/2 tsp of salt!

This is a great recipe, good twist on pesto!  I don't care for Jalapeno, and we used a whole one without seeds...just the right amount of kick!  Served it as an appetizer on a toasted baguette (with olive oil).  Placed some pesto on top with a piece of tomato as a garnish.  Delicious!

I love super spicy food - so I used 2 huge jalapenos with seeds.  I added a little extra oil & lime juice to compensate.  It was delicious!!  I used in veggie wraps with roasted potates, cheese & lettuce.

The best form of pesto!  Love love love it!  Didn't change anything and it was perfect.  Highly recommended - especially for those with a spice tolerance.

Absolutely perfect.  I used a hot yellow pepper instead (for the kids' sensitivity).  This stuff will be perfect for any whitefish or when you buy that frozen fish on sale that is flavorless.

This is a great recipe. I more than double the jalepeno in general and have also taken to sometimes supplementing the pine nuts with toasted cashews, as well as adding some fresh basil, just because I have too much growing right now. This recipe holds a lot of room for error depending on personal tastes in all areas except for the garlic. Be careful not to overdo it there. Great recipe.

This is DELICIOUS!  Of course, you have to be a fan of strong strong flavors, but it's wonderful.  I love the strong flavors, so I added a few more garlic cloves and more lime juice, but just a bit more.  I'll probably double the jalapeno next time I make it, but I WILL be making it again and again.  BRAVO!

I signed up just to thank you for this.  It is excellent as is, I usually add a little fresh ground black pepper though.

I've made this twice and think it turns out well, but not great.  I like to use it on my steak sandwhiches for a nice kick but don't care to use it in any other applications.

I fixed this tonight to have on rigatoni.  It was very good.  I used an entire seeded jalapeno, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  We like spicy food, so I could have used a second jalapeno.

We found this recipe to be very tasty, but we will try it again and toast the garlic. We thought the raw garlic was a bit too much for the pesto. Might also try Anaheim chilies and roast them as well, give more depth to the flavors. Overall we liked it though, and will add it to our pesto recipes.

Good use for leftover cilantro. If I made this again, I would cook the garlic as I didn't care for the raw garlic flavor. The cilantro pesto seemed a little milder flavor than a basil pesto. I didn't have pine nuts, so I used walnuts & that worked well.

Spectacular!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, though I used a food processor rather than a blender.  I took another reviewer's advice and spread this on a toasted baguette with heirloom tomatoes.  The cilantro and tomatoes came straight from the local farmer's market.  Simply delicious!

I substituted 1/2 of cilantro for fresh basil and it was wonderful!  Makes a great dip for crackers.  Just the right amount of spice for our family!

I made this last night to go along with shredded rotisserie chicken, brown rice, and steamed spinach. It was soooo good. I thought it needed a bit of salt (probably dependant upon the salt in the parmesan) and for my tastes it needed the whole jalapeno. This will become a regular for me, because it's the perfect condiment/dressing to top our "bowls".

I didn't have any cilantro, so I used Italian parsley instead. It was great, but I definitely will try it with the cilantro. I used it as a pizza topping, and it added a nice spicy touch with cheddar cheese and some veggies. We added it to some roasted meat and as a chip dip.

Awesome! What a great blend of flavors. If you are skipping the seeds then you can likely add a whole large jalapeño. Best to start slow and toss in the other half once you have tasted it. But give it a second... The heat of the pepper sneaks up on you. I love it so much I made a few extra jars and tossed them in the freezer.

Our family loved it.  Took just a few minutes to make and clean up mini food chopper.  Just had a small bunch of cilantro I needed to use up and found this recipe.  Had slivered almonds.   Used a whole jalapeno.   Tastes great eaten all different ways, including spreading some on a slice of deli turkey and rolling up.

This is the sooooo good!!! It's much much much better than the ones I would buy at the grocery store!! I followed the recipe exactly but needed to kick it up a notch!
I added extra tbl spoon of lemon juice, salt, pepper and threw in another whole jalepenos! This is crazy good~

Thank you for posting the recipe!

You can add or leave out the jalapeno depending on whether you want your pesto spice or not.  This is GREAT added to cooked rice!   Very refreshing and adds a zip to any meal.

I love this stuff!  My only caution would be that the amount of jalapeno depends on how hot each individual pepper is.  I loved this on my mashed potatoes, on pasta, on a sandwich.  Yum!
