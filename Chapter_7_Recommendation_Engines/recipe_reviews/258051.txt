This was just ok for us. I did like the rice in it quite a bit. it was outside the box for me that there was rice in sloppy Joe's, but it works well. For me I think I might have preferred ground beef to ground chicken in this dish. Nothing is really wrong with recipe it's just a preference thing.

This was really tasty. I liked the addition of brown rice and that this used ground chicken. Next time I think I'll play around with some of the proportions of the sauce to get it perfect for me. I had this on a bun and it was fine, but I think I like it best when I had it in a whole wheat tortilla with a little cheese and sour cream
