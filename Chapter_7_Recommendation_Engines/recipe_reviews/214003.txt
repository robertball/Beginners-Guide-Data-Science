This is by far THE easiest glaze I have ever made. There's no cooking on the stove, no measuring of a ton of spices. It's super quick and easy and yet it still tastes great. I don't often try recipes that haven't gone through the allrecipes gauntlet and gotten reviews with things that need to be altered, but I wanted something different for my ham. I was tired of the same old, same old pineapple or maple recipes. So I gave this one a try and was glad I did. This one will be a keeper for me, and I'll be passng it along to my daughters who need uncomplicated and quick recipes.

Followed the recipe exactly, would neve make again. I tried to doctor it up alittle bit at the end but it was just not for me. My husbnd and I decided that the combination of honey and mollasses just did not go together. Will never make again!

It's pretty good! I wish it would have thickened up a bit and stuck to the ham better. Overall, a really nice taste though.

Yummy! I used a hand full of brown sugar instead of molasses because I do not keep molasses on hand. Everyone loved it

Putting this glaze on my ham made it the best ham ever. We ate the leftovers for breakfast lunch and dinner until it was gone. A+++++

I've tried this recipe several times and absolutely love it! I not only use it for holidays but also for Sunday dinners occasionally, and when guests come to visit. The only thing I've done differently is adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice to the glaze just to give it that extra sweet/tangy taste.

Love this and have made it many times! If you are out of honey you can use pancake syrup. I did and it turned out fine.

AWESOME, EASY recipe.  We bought an inexpensive ham from Walmart last November.  Pulled it out of the freezer a few days ago.  Although it was smoked, it didn't come with any pre-made glaze, nor was it scored.  Sliced a piece off to see how it tasted and BLEH!  It was awful!  Found this recipe and scored the ham.  Followed recipe as written except added some ground cloves.  Baked for a couple of hours and only basted a couple of times.  Oh baby, what a difference.  Made that bland, salty piece of meat taste wonderful.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.  Thank you very much for sharing!

Perfect!! I, too, did not have brown sugar in the house when it came time to glaze the Thanksgiving ham.  This recipe was just what I was looking for ~ and it was delicious!!
