Fantastic recipe but since I'd anticipated the cake portion might be bland, I added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the light biscuit mix with grated orange peel (not lemon)in the blueberry mixture.  Also used a can of Eagle light condensed milk, not the regular. Result was outstanding! Did not bother with the sauce as it was not necessary.  Very moist, delicious dessert. Definitely a keeper!!!!!

Would have given it a 2 or 3 stars if it wasnt for the fact of unnecessary changes I made.  I followed the advice of other reviews and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and found that it was WAY too overpowering..considering there is already a decent amount in the topping.  It just took away from the blueberry flavor completely.  I feel that if I would have just followed the recipe EXACTLY...it would have came out PERFECT, a 5 star!!  I will definately give this recipe another go without the adds...and will re-rate it.

I made this recipe for company on Saturday night and my only regret was that I didn't assemble it earlier than I did as I found myself rushing with all the "steps."  However, the "proof is in the cobbler."  It was delicious and one guest even remarked that I had to have used real butter when preparing this recipe and I answered that indeed was the case.  It is truly delicious and the sauce is the perfect "topping."  None of the guests wanted either whipped cream or ice cream, both of which were offered.  So it comes higly recommended, but don't make the mistake of waiting until the last minute to prepare it.  I made no adaptations to it other than to add a little more of each of the spices for the sauce.

Moist, gooey, delicious.  I never made any changes to the recipe, and I don't bother with the lemon zest when I don't have a lemon on hand.  It definitely makes a difference to have it, but it still tastes great without it. Goes great with vanilla ice cream.

sxcellent! to add even more flavor I used the juice from the frozen blueberries in place of the water for the sauce. I also crushed the blueberries for the sauce..so much better!

This is an excellent recipe! I searched through several recipes for Blueberry Cobbler until I found this one. It sounded delicious so I decided to give it a try. I followed the advice of “3DOXIES” and added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the batter. This is definitely a “keeper”!  I used frozen blueberries that I picked last summer. The blueberry sauce nicely complimented the cobbler. I didn’t have any vanilla ice cream so I topped each serving with whipped topping. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

This was really pretty good. In fact, I liked it better the next day reheated. The sauce is what really makes this dish.  We enjoyed it.

Very good. My husband said it was one of the best desserts I've made. Serving it hot with vanilla ice cream on top is a must! FYI: This makes a lot!

This blueberry cobbler was wonderful! There is no need to change it in any way. The cake and the blueberry sauce are easy to make and extremely delicious. I recommend using walnuts, since it doesn't specify what type of nut to use. I also used the servings calculator to make it for 4 instead of 8.

I made it according to recipe but without nuts and it was fabulous!  Nothing bland about the cake...and the sauce was terrific.  We served the cake a la mode with sauce on top! There were 8 of us and everyone raved about it...even the 3 year old!

Wow this was so delicious! By far the best cobbler I've ever had and my family loved it! For the "chopped nuts" I used chopped honey roasted pecans that I think were meant for a salad topping but they worked oh so well. I used my grandma's recipe one night then used this one the next night and this one  totally blew everyone away! I can't wait to try different fruits in it!

We made this according to the directions and it is really good.  The topping turned out crispy and the blueberries in it were so good.  We had ours with the vanilla ice cream.  The blueberry sauce really makes the recipe!  Thanks for another good recipe!

A great cobbler/crisp compromise. I made it without the sauce, and will double the blueberries mixed with the sweetened condensed milk next time.

Wow, a perfect recipe! I used fat free condensed milk and orange zest instead of lemon (there's no sense trying to lighten the suger content, just enjoy) - otherwise no changes. Beautiful presentation with vanilla ice cream and sauce over all and it tastes even better! One of the best deserts I've ever had. Thank you.

My daughter-in-law made this and I was blown away by the flavor.  This is my new favorite blueberry recipe.  I think it is great just as written, but I will try adding the nutmeg and cinnamon to the crust, but I think it will be overkill.  Again, I think this is the best dessert that I have had in a long time.

Fabulous!  All of my guests loved this and asked for the recipe.  I'm not a great cook, and this was fool-proof.  The only change I made was I used a multi-grain baking mix.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing this outstanding dessert.

Delicious cake!...did not change anything in the cake recipe.
 In the blueberry sauce used honey in place of the sugar and the juice of the lemon mixed with water (to make 1/2 cup). 
Lemon adds a lot of flavor to blueberries! ;)

I've made a few recipes from this site, but this is the first that tastes like it was designed by a gourmet chef. Pure genius!   I've made it twice so far, the second time, substituting a couple of things. I replaced half the biscuit mix with almond meal plus a little baking soda and salt. I also replaced the half-cup sugar in the blueberry sauce with 1/4 cup blue agave. I got the carb count down as well as the glycemic index. Tastes the same to me.   Great recipe, at any rate.

I loved this did exactly the recipe.  The crust was great... I used walnuts on top.   I do want to tinker with the sauce a bit.  Bet brandy added would be great.

I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I went to a pick your own Blueberry farm and picked over 11 pounds of Blueberries.  I went searching for Blueberry recipes and came across this one first.  This has got to be the best Blueberry dessert I have ever tasted!  The flavor is very Blueberry which I love.  This has become my new favorite Blueberry Recipe.  I want to go pick more Blueberries before they are gone!!!  Thank you soooooo much!

This is a great recipe.  After reading other reviews I was worried that the cake would be bland, which by itself it kind of is.  When you add ice cream and the blueberry sauce the whole dish comes alive with flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe & very easy-i didn't add nuts & turned out fine. Also added nutmeg/cinn to topping.   I did add extra 1/2 pint of blueberries-to me, this is a must.  Also drizzled icing on top (powder sugar+lemon juice)-made it look pretty.   Thanks!

This was good, definitely not a true cobbler more like a cake.  It would be nice for breakfast. I give it only three stars because its just that, good but not great. I think I'll try another recipe next time.

This was an awesome recipe.. Will make again and again. Everything tasted awesome, we served it with ice cream, although you don't really NEED the sauce, it tastes awesome with or without it..  Thanks for the recipe

really good. Blueberries were not in season so I used peaches and it was delicious. The sauce really makes it. Took it to a church dinner and brought nothing home except requests for the recipe.

The only thing I didn't like about this, was that I found it to be salty...it must've been the brown sugar.  Next time, I think I'll use oatmeal in the streusel.

I was a little wary about this recipe because there was no egg or milk (not counting the condensed milk) But it got such great reviews were so good, I decided to try it.  I used fat free condensed and had to make my own baking mix (from a recipe on AR) I used half blue, half black berries. I followed the recipe, with the exception of no blueberry sauce. My husband doesnt usually like me to veer from the usual recipes I use, but he really liked this one (thankfully!) It's really tasty. I baked mine for one hour and it turned out perfect. Dont change a thing- Great way to use those fresh berries!

Oh goodness!   This is delicious!!    I absolutely loved it.  Only change I made was to use orange peel instead of lemon peel, since that's what I had on hand.
Can't go wrong with this recipe!

We have blueberry bushes and tons of fresh blueberries come on around the 4th of July.  I have tried this with both fresh and frozen, but find we like it best with frozen berries.  I increased the berries by half, since we like the taste of the fruit.

Just like the other folks here, tweaked it just a little….I added 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp orange extract to the condensed milk mixture and the blueberry sauce.  It was beyond fabulous! Loved it and will make it again and again!  PS It didn't take me long to assemble as one of the reviewers seemed to think it was….I think I will make it with cherry pie filling next time!

Great recipe. It was so quick and easy. I was hesitant about this recipe because of the lack of egg and long cooking time but no worries!  It is moist and rich and has a great texture. I doubled the recipe and it filled a 9x11 and 8x8 pan well. I added a half tsp. of cinnamon to the stueusel topping and it was a hit. I didnt make the sauce, just used whipped cream and it was a great summer treat.

I used frozen blueberries since the recipe said that you could use that.  I'm sure it would have been better with fresh blueberries, but with frozen blueberries it was just too sweet -- especially with the sauce.  I've read other reviews that said it was better the second night, so my fingers are crossed. . . .

Excellent.  Comfort food style cake; the sauce gives a fresh tart note, so I wouldn't skip it.  I thought I could speed things up by baking at 350 degrees but it needs the full time.

Delicious exactly as prepared. Only change was lemon peel as I didn't have any! I made a 1/2 recipe as I had 1/2 a can of sweetened condensed milk and some baking mix that nobody liked as pancakes. A 1/2 recipe fit pretty well in a glass pie plate. Baked for 65 minutes. Used all frozen blueberries and served with a little whipped cream.

this is the most wonderful things i have ever made. The combination of the blueberries, brown sugar, and pecans is beautiful. 

Sometime i would like to try this with cranberries, and see how it turns out.

This is the best recipe I've ever made. It's my favorite thing to make. The past few times I have made it, I have left the sauce off, and it's still wonderful. The combination of the blueberries with the brown sugar and pecans on the top are phenominal.

This was actually very good with a lot of flavor. I was expecting  it to be more like cobbler but it came out cakey (drier). I was concerned I made it incorrectly, but the only change was to add a little lemon juice and cinnamon to the berry mix.  I also added a bit of salt to the topping. The condensed milk I had was way past its date and syrupy,  but that didn't seem to be a problem. The topping was powdery and I may switch out some for oatmeal next time. We ate it without the syrup topping and just used spray cream -- we had to have seconds!

Awesome!  I enlarged my recipe to be enough for my big family. (I did NOT add a second can of Eagle Brand tho, only added about 1/2 C milk for more liquid)  I also added the cinnamon & nutmeg to my batter, not the topping, and had to use orange zest since I had no lemons.    SO GOOD!   Definitely will make this one again!

Made this once. The blogger is leaving out something in the steps like freezing the butter before cutting it into the baking mix or kicking the heat up higher. Following this recipe as is will not get you the crumbly texture as shown in the picture. It’s delicious but presentation is lacking. 
PS: to achieve a crumbly topping, just do ^^^ the things above I mentioned. It works!  Start by baking at 400 for the first 15 minutes and then turning the oven down to the recommended 325 degrees for the remainder of the cooking time. This will ENSURE that the top stays crumbly!!

Wonderful! I used gluten free bisquick, raw sugar, and a a larger pan (because I didn’t have 9x9). So only baked 45 mins. No one knew it was gluten free.

I added a touch of cinnamon and a heavy splash of vanilla in the actual batter and made the sauce exactly as described in the recipe. This is fantastic and even my four year old son loves it! I WILL be making this again. (I used frozen blueberries just fyi)

This is a delicious recipe!  I have made for my July 4th BBQ two years in a row.  I made it with the blueberry sauce recipe that used to accompany it.  Great with ice cream.

I made it just as the recipe said and it was fantastic :) the only change I made was I added a touch of lemon zest to the sauce and for me it tasted yummy only need a drizzle cause it is very sweet next time I make it I am going to try and lighted it up by using coconut sugar or pure maple syrup

While this recipe is good, it is not the traditional cobbler I was anticipating.  It was more like a blueberry coffee cake with a topping.  Again, not bad but not was I was hoping for.  I also used almond instead of vanilla.

I picked this recipe because my husband loves blueberries and didn't even look at the reviews because they were so high I just assumed it would be a winner...well I only gave it 3 stars because I believe the title of this recipe is misleading...when I think of cobbler, I think of a cobbler as a "cousin" to the pie...mostly fruit on the bottom.  Well, this recipe when finished is more like blueberry cake..its nothing like any real cobbler or pie I've ever tased, maybe its a regional thing Im southern...even at that, this "blueberry cake" was nothing to right home about, it was just okay.  TO each his own, I definitely don't see where the high reviews are coming fromrom

I made it exactly as directed and chose this because of the reviews. I personally did not like it. The blueberries were overpowered by the nuts and brown sugar. I could see using apple pie filling with the bisquick brown sugar topping. Also, I didn't care for the spices with my blueberry syrup. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just not my cup of tea.

Really great. It has a wonderful rich flavor, and the crunchy topping is perfect. Topped the whole thing with the blueberry sauce and it was heaven!!

The sauce was a big, multi-purpose hit. Only change was a nub of butter, pinch of salt, lemon zest and cooked it down! Enhanced the blueberriness. Thanks for a great recipe.

WOW! We loved this and it got raves from friends at a BBQ. I made it exactly as written. I didn't find the cake bland or overly sweet at all. The spices in the sauce really made it delicious. I used frozen blueberries. I will be making this over and over again!

I made this 2 times in 2 days, and doubled it each time when I had family staying with us for my son's high school graduation. We couldn't get enough of it. The 2nd time I reduced the lemon peel by 1/2 and added vanilla. I'll make this again the next time I have blueberries to use up.

I followed this recipe until I got to the sauce part.  I added NO spices and a teaspoon of lemon juice.  It worked better for my family to put the sauce in the food processor and make it great for icecream also.  It's a keeper.

Delicious.

I made it in a 9-inch round, metal cake pan, since I don't have a 9-inch square baking dish.  It turned out fine, although the sides of the cobbler were higher than the center, and I had to cook it a few minutes longer than recommended.

One note:  If I could have given this recipe 4.5 stars, I would have.  (Degree of difficulty counts for something in my book.)  I loathed cutting the butter into the baking mix and into the streusel.  I am a novice cook (and that's being generous).  I don't have many specialty tools like pastry blenders.  Many years ago, I was taught to cut-butter-in using two knives.  Since I had knives, that's how I did it.  My hands and wrists ached before I was done.  I'm happy to say that the end-result was worth the trouble.

Yummmmm.

I bought a 4# container of blueberries and wanted to make something with them to take over to our friends. This was a hit! I followed the recipe just as it is (except I doubled it...and used flour in place of cornstarch, bc for some reason I was out of cornstarch). And I noticed in other reviews that people suggested to add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. No need. It's in the sauce (which is phenominal)! I use Penzey's spices - the Vietnamese Cinnamon and the Indian Nutmeg - Oh. My. This recipe is going in the 'make again' file!

Excellent recipe!  We ate it without the sauce and it was still awesome.  I did not modify the recipe in anyway.  It is a great way to use your fresh picked blueberries!

Very good on its own, with no major changes necessary.  I used orange zest (had no lemon on hand), and the orange was a nice complement to the blueberry.  Also, I have a convection oven, and the cobbler was done in 30 minutes at 350F.  Really, really good served warm with a side of vanilla ice cream.

Wow! Everyone wanted the recipe! Doubled it for a 13x9 pan, followed recipe exactly but added a little vanilla to the milk/Bisquick mix. Made it early am,  baked it that night. Great recipe!

I am not a huge desert fan but this was so delicious I had to stop myself from having seconds!  I used the fat free sweetened condensed milk and made my own brown sugar (1 cup sugar & 1Tbs molasses).  Yum. . . Yum!!!!

This was so good, I can't believe it was made with bisquick!  I used to think bisquick was a lazy persons ingredient but after eating this and impossible coconut pie, I will always have some on hand!  The cake itself is delicious but add the topping--that put's it over the top.  Do not skip if you can help it!  YUMMMMMM!

Excellent! I prefer this without the blueberry sauce  because it's perfect on its own with vanilla icecream or whipped topping. But if you want to get fancy then go ahead and make the sauce.

I won the cobbler contest at the 2012 Kingman Christian Church Family Camp.
