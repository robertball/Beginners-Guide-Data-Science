It was runny before I ever added the puree. I only added 2 Tbls of puree and it was even worse. No amount of extra conf sugar made this any thicker. Waste of time and money. Maybe fold finely chopped strawberries in instead of puree. 
 I've made many different frostings and this did not turn out at all.

My family and I loved it!
Due to the potential of having thin, or watery frosting, I added a bit more (1/4 c) confectioners sugar and added the strawberry pur√©e a little at a time instead of the full amount the recipe called for..I used about 1/2 the amount it called for. It came out perfect:)

I made this frosting for a vanilla cake and the taste is delightful. Fresh strawberries are the best. It is definitely a thin frosting, even after adding around a cup of extra confectioner's sugar. If I make it again, I'll likely try adding cornstarch (I would've this time of I had any in my pantry). On another note, it was just as delicious and much closer to the consistency of a true buttercream before adding the strawberry puree.

This recipe has great flavoring however it is way to thin even after adding in extra sugar/ corn starch. I think next time if I do make this I'll use strawberry cream cheese instead of plain cream cheese. Maybe that will save this recipe.

i loved this recipe! Will certainly double it next time. I added less sugar because I do not like overly sweet cakes and frostings.  I also left out some of the puree. Once together, I refrigerated it for better consistency. Next time I'll add cornstarch for it to have more body.
