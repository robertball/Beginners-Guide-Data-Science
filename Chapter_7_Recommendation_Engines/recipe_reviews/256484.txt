This is an amazingly moist chocolate cake with an essence of stout that is not overpowering. The only thing I added was 1/4 t salt. It was a huge hit at my St. Patty's day party and 3 people asked for the recipe.

I made these for the March challenge #everyonelovescupcakes for Allrecipes Allstars Canada.
The liquid to flour ratio is off in this recipe, basic cake ratio is 1 part fat, 2 parts sugar, 3 parts flour and 4 eggs. 
I wanted 12 cupcakes so I adjusted the recipe to 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cups flour, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup Guiness, 1/3 cup sour cream, 1/3 cup cocoa, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 tsps baking powder (I used Dutch processed cocoa which requires baking powder not soda) 
For the frosting I used 1/4 cup of Baileys Irish Cream and added an additional 1/4 cup of icing sugar as it was a bit soft for piping, would add a little more next time.
Baked in 23 minutes and yielded 14 cupcakes.
Made for an early St. Patrick's Day lunch, strong in flavour but tasty.

It was good but not great.  It wasn’t chocolately enough and the frosting completely overpowered the cake, so much so that I could barely taste anything but the frosting.  I’ve tasted the cake using Diana’s Guinness chocolate cake recipe on this site and it’s better than this one.  It’s more chocolately, and the chocolate frosting makes all the difference by re-inforcing the chocolate flavor

Delicious!! It's definitely not your average fluffy kind of cake, it's a bit dense but still unbelievably moist. And the frosting is amazing. I like my frosting a little more cream cheesy so I about doubled the cream cheese and added a bit more powdered sugar and liqueur to make up for it. This was a win with our St. Patrick's day guests.

Made for my son's birthday.  It was so very delicious that it disappeared.  My granddaughter liked it so much, that she is thinking of having it for her wedding cake.
