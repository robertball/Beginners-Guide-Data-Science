Wonderful recipe! I made the following changes, many of which were recommended by others.         
A) Reduce: Cream by 1/5, Salt by 1/4, and 
Chilis by 1/3- 1/2.     B)Increase the seafood, because people will inevitably want more of it.    C) Use Bay scallops instead of other scallops, if available.    D)  Saute fresh green peppers and mushrooms in butter with the green onions before adding them to the cream.    E) Reserve a small portion of the cream mixture and toss the pasta with it just before serving.    F) Don't prepare the pasta until the cream mixture is ready, as the pasta will only take a few minutes to cook and the sauce took longer to prepare than the recipe indicated-- its taste REALLY improves if it is allowed to simmer.

My fiance came across this recipe a couple of months ago and it's been a staple in our kitchen since. After reading a couple of other reviews, I would recommend the following.. 

Change the order when adding the ingredients:
-Heavy cream, as directed (+ addl 1/4 cup)
-Peppers, onions, parsley as directed (reduce red pepper by at least half if you are sensitive to spicy foods).
-Cheese, as directed
**Let reduce until desired consistency. This will achieve that traditional Alfredo texture and body w/o add'l unecessary ingredients.** 
-Add shrimp and scallops last(make sure shrimp and scallops are comparable in size so they have similar cooking times). By adding the seafood last, you are avoiding overcooking when letting your sauce thicken.  

Hope this helps- Happy Cooking :).

This is a well written recipe and tastes good, but if you are looking for a creamier (more alfredo style) recipe you should continue searching. Based upon previous reviews I made the following changes: I added approximately 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, added 1 teaspoon of cajun seasoning, did not use the parsley, used mozorella instead of swiss and used dry herbs (for the basil and thyme) instead of fresh. I would have used fresh herbs but I did not have any on hand and I did not want to make a special trip to the grocery store. My roommate enjoyed this dish immensely, but I was hoping for a more "alfredo" style sauce. I will probably not be making this again.

If you expect this to be seafood alfredo, you will be disappointed, but if you want a flavorful cream-based sauce with a kick, you'll love this.  I make a few modifcations to streamline the dish: 1. sauted the seafood seperately from the cream while the cream was boiling and mixing the seafood into the cream at the last second, 2. added 1/2 tsp of low-salt cajun seasoning and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the seafood while sauting, 3. save a 1/4 cup of the pasta water to add to the sauce if needed to thin, 4. pre-warn the pasta bowl otherwise the sauce congeals before you can serve it. 5. add the pasta to the bowl, then the sauce, it will spread to every noodle much better. 6. serve immediately, this dish does not sit well.  My husband loves this and can't for me to make again.

Lots of people have commented on this being too peppery.  Most people, however, like the consistency of the sauce.  I think I've found a nice balance.  DON'T reduce the peppers -- just INCREASE the liquid.  For example, in addition to the 2 cups of cream, I add one cup of regular milk, whisked together in a separate bowl with 1 tsp. corn starch or flour for thickening.  Add that to the cream in the skillet -- it dilutes the peppery taste, but preserves the natural flavor balance and allows for even MORE (and lower fat) sauce!  Nice job, Star Pooley.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I changed it up just a little - used chicken instead of scallops, added some fresh mushrooms and broccoli....oh yes, and used mozza instead of swiss.  Could have used just a touch more moisture - I think one of the other reviewer's suggestion of adding a cup of milk together with a bit of cornstarch would make it that much better.  But either way, excellent recipe.  Oh yes, one other thing - not as good leftover so if you don't need such a big amount, I'd half the recipe.

This recipe is Very Good! I used 2cups of half-&-half and 2 cups of milk. I made with 1lb scallops and 0.5lb shrimps. I did not add much more of other spice (pepper) but with addition of ~1/2tsp of cajun spice.

We used frozen bay scallops, and frozen shrimp with some shredded crab meat.....eliminated the red pepper and halved the other peppers...served with angel hair pasta....and it was fantastic. I can understand why people might feel inclined to add a thickener while cooking, but the sauce thickened wonderfully when removed from the heat. Not an inexpensive dish to make here in the Midwest, but worth it for my husband's birthday dinner. Thank you!!!

this recipe is great. The first time I made it I left out the white pepper and it was perfect. The second time I made it at my sisters and found it oo peppery. I now leave out the white pepper.

This was my first time cooking shrimp and scallops and I think I cooked them too long but it was still very tasty.  I also used dry spices (halved) and halved the peppers (omitting the white pepper completly). Still very good and I think it is a great idea for serving for guests or for a romantic night alone with a loved one.  Tastes like restraunt quality. Thank you Star and allrecipes.com!

Whoa!  What did I miss??  I have never posted a review before as all of the recipes I've tried have been fantastic.  This one just wasn't.  I can see how it might be good if you omitted most of the pepper (especially the white pepper).  But it is unfortunate that you have to try the recipe first to discover this; what a waste of good shrimp & scallops. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE spicy food, but this was just obscenely peppery, and I even cut back on the pepper flakes!  Although I see the potential for a good recipe, I am just so disappointed that I probably won't bother trying it again.

This recipe was AMAZING!!! Made it for my boyfriend who is somewhat of a picky eater and he absolutely loved it. Took the rest home to my parents and siblings and they loved it too. My brother is begging me to make it again. Followed the recipe almost exactly with a few modifications based on other's reviews. I cut back on the pepper just a tad bit because I was worried it would be too spicy. Where it called for 2 teaspoons of pepper I'd use more like 1.5. Additionally I added more heavy whipping cream. I used 3 cups and added a few TBSP of all purpose flour to thicken the sauce. Lastly, I added mushrooms. All in all, preparation was a breeze and it didn't take long to make. I mixed the sauce in with the pasta instead of serving them separately as the recipe stated. Will definitely be making this again.

I've made this twice, once for a romantic "just the two of us" dinner, and once shared with friends.  
If you're looking for one of those dinners that always pops eyes open wide and fills the room with "MMMMMMM," this is your recipe for sure!  One person told me it rivaled most gourmet restaurants he'd been to.
Both times I made this, I used chili powder in place of the white pepper.  (I am a huge fan of "the kick.")  I also used dried basil and thyme (halved).  The second time I made it, I used cheddar instead of swiss and that tasted phenomenal, too.  It's a fun recipe to play around with.  One of these days I'll have to make it as written!  ;)  
This is definitely a keeper; a great one to have around to WOW the most discriminating dinner guests.

Wrote my first review to rave about this pasta!!  As we were eating it, my husband declared it better than Olive Garden.  He went back for thirds!!  It was yummy!!  I did add a little extra milk to the cream, and brought my cream to a boil with the herbs and seasonings in it.  I reduced the spicy seasonings down quite a bit because we have children.  I used frozen shrimp and scallops, and it still turned out amazingly!!  From start to finish it took maybe 35 minutes to prepare, so bonus points for being quick, too!!  We will be eating this one again!  It was super delicious!!!

Wonderful, easy recipe! I would give it 5 starts but I did make several changes so it is different.  I cut back on the amount of pepper because I'm not a huge fan of very spicy foods.  I used about 3/4 tsp red pepper and 1 tsp black pepper.  I cut out the white pepper bc I didin't have any and it was fine.  I added sauteed red peppers and red onions which I think added even more flavor.  I doubled the garlic and used an extra 1/2 cup of whipping cream.  I also added the cheese first as others had recommended.  Once that was well blended I added the seafood.  It was soooo good!!!!  Definitely a favorite and will make often.  Thanks for sharing :)

They should change the name of this dish to pepper or mouth horror.  In retrospect I should have just eaten a box of pepper for dinner instead of wasting 40 bucks on the ingredients.  Couldn't even finish one plate, threw it all in the garbage.  What about this dish is cajun?  It has red pepper flakes in it so that makes it cajun?  I put red pepper flakes on my piazza so is that cajun?  I am a huge fan of spicy foods but this dish is not spicy, it is just peppery.  I ate it 10 hours ago and I can still taste the pepper, and I cut it by 25%.  This dish should only be served to in laws or enemies.  If my fiancee ever tries to make this for me again I will throw it in her face and then kick the dog just because he was there.  This peppery poison should be on the menu at guantanomo bay, forget the water boarding one lick of this sauce and they will start giving up all their secrets.

Soooo good!  I was really impressed with how well this turned out.  It was delicious and spicy and looked a lot harder to make than it was.  Next time I make it I'm going to try to thicken the sauce a little bit more but other than that... fantastic!

This is a great recipe for seafood pasta! I used half milk & half heavy cream (same measurements), added 1tblsp of Cajun seasoning and sauteed fresh red bell peppers, red onion, and mushrooms with the green onions before adding them to the sauce. I served this over fresh red pepper pasta which made the dish that much better! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and it was great. Normally, the first time that I make a new recipe from this site I go directly by the directions so I can make a fair and non-biased revue. Shame on me, I added fresh mushrooms. The only reason that I don't give this a five rating is because it didn't thicken the eay I thought it should. This recipe is definately a keeper. I didn't think about it until later, but if I wanted it thicker I could have used a little cornstarch. So much for my diet, I will be working out very hard today to make up for my foolishness last night, but it was worth it;-)

Wonderful dish!! As I ate I thought it reminded me of something I've eaten at Red Lobster....it was that good. I did have to do some things different based on what I had on hand.  I didn't have enough heavy cream so I made a slurry of a cup of whole milk and 3 tsp. cornstarch. Added this in as the heavy cream started to bubble just a little. Substituted crab leg meat for the scallops.  No Swiss cheese either and my pasta on hand was a spaghetti noodle. Even with what I had to change, this was a most wonderful meal. Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent! I used low fat milk instead of whipping cream (thickened with cornstarch in a little of cold water at the end). Used 1 teaspoon of dried basil and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme since I didn't have any fresh basil or thyme.
Also only used 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes. Everyone loved it. 
Will probably omit the scallops next time. Directions should probably say to turn off heat prior to adding the cheeses so they don't curdle.

I substituted fat free half and half to be health conscious, and it didn't thicken up as well as cream but the flavor of this dish was still amazing. I also used 1 tsp of black pepper, 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp of cajun seasoning, instead of all the pepper called for. Added the seafood last so as not to overcook.  UPDATE: I used 2 c of skim milk with 2 Tbsp of flour, and the consistency was perfect!  An extremely flavorful no fat cream sauce at last! :) Instead of the salt and peppers called for in this dish, I use 2 tsp of cajun seasoning (has a lot of salt in it), NO additional salt, 1 tsp of black pepper, and 3/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Zesty and spicy!

I would definitely like to try this again. The sauce had nice texture.   I made this with just the scallops, used dried herbs, added a single clove of garlic & omitted the white pepper & swiss cheese.  It was hot enough!    Next time, I would eliminate the thyme. It is definitely a strong flavor in this dish, so if you are not a big fan, skip it! Also, I would use FF half/half to cut some fat.  Finally, I think diced red peppers would be a nice addition... maybe peas too.

This is absolutely delicious. My family loved and keeps asking for it. I did change a few things: I added 4 cloves of garlic and minced onion and I also added baby portabella mushrooms and sauteed them in butter and white wine. Also, I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end and it was absolutely delicious! Great job!!!!

Excellent recipe, not for the timid, a bit spicy. Will make again soon. Added Calamari and broccoli to the recipe, along with Scallops and Shrimp.

I made this recipe and it was fantastic! I will definitely make this again! I did read reviews before I decided to make it and made some modifications after reading them.  I added 1/4 c more heavy cream and added a splash of milk.  I also put crab meat along with the scallops and shrimp.  I also cut the peppers in half and it still had great flavor as well as heat! Absolutely wonderful!

Wonderful!  I modified to make a little healthier.  Used 1/4 cup cream, 1/4 cup milk and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce.  I omitted the swiss and topped with a dusting of parmesan instead.  Served with whole wheat pasta.

I took the other reviews advice and use moz.  It was very good.  I added a little milk and a bit more parm.  I also added a little oregano.  My husband said he was going to smack me because it was so good.

There is so much flavor in this recipe. The amount of spice is perfect, it's hot but it doesn't take away from the flavor. After making this I tried to eat seafood pasta at a restraunt and it was so bland. I'm actually making this for my husband for Valentines dinner instead of going out, that's how good it is.

What a wonderful recipe!  I did reduce the crushed red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, used 1# shrimp and no scallops, added sliced mushrooms and three cloves of minced garlic - the fresh herbs made the dish - it was just like something from a restaurant!  I assembled all the ingredients about an hour before cooking and then it was a snap to make!

I normally don't post reviews, but this recipe was the best I've EVER made!  It turned out great!  I used fresh dried thyme and added a tiny bit of cornstarch after the cheese, we like the sauce thicker.  We LOVE hot foot, but only 1/2 tspn red pepper flakes are needed.  Anymore would have really taken away from the wonderfully combined flavor of all the other ingredients.  This really makes a perfect blend of flavors where you can't quite tell what you taste, but you know it is sooo yummy.  This dish is something I would have in a fancy coat & tie restaraunt.  Picky fiance loved it, he even complimented me on it all on his own, without coaxing!
SIMPLY EXQUISITE AND DEVINE

I should have paid more attention to the reviews that were given. I have to agree with jbundles comments. I made the SAME mistake and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce before adding the cheeses. OOPS! I compensated by adding more cream to the sauce and it still tasted excellent! I too would suggest starting with less red pepper flakes and add more gradually.  I thought that it was great, but if serving to others, it might be too hot for their tastebuds.  Overall this was an excellent recipe. I am going to try this again and use some of the suggestions that were given on this site.

I made this with minor changes and it was absolutely delicious. I combined everything in the cream sauce and simmered on very low to blend the flavors. After the pasta was started I added the seafood last to the sauce. It was quite hot so I will cut back a little on the 3 peppers next time. I used extra cream and extra cheeses to thicken up the sauce and it coated very well. The fresh basil, thyme, parsley, and onions gave a nice fresh taste. Will def make again.

Awesome recipe!!!! I read the other reviews and used only half of the crushed red pepper. Everyone thought it was just spicy enough like that and we could still taste the other ingredients too. Tasted great the next day too.

VERY SPICY!! Next time, I would only put 1/3 of what the recipe calls for for each type of pepper. Other than that, It was absolutely delicious. I didnt put any thyme or parsley, and i used yellow onion instead of green onion.  I also used regular milk instead of whipping cream and substituted the shrimp for crab meat.

I would give it a five, but I made a ton of changes to make it a five.  First off it was way too spicy that we felt like it was overpowering.  I reduced the spices by an eight and we loved it.  I also didn't have cream on hand the second time I made it and used milk.  Turned out great.

Everyone that ate this loved it.  I could really taste the white pepper in particular and will probably cut this to 1/2 tsp next time.  I omitted the scallops and doubled the shrimp because i'm not a big fan of scallops.  Great recipe though!

This was delicious!! I had a to thicken it up quite a bit, but that is not a problem. I used corn starch or flour I can't remember off hand. It was very spicy but DELICIOUS my boyfriend who is an EXTREMELY picky eater. Went back for seconds and thirds!!

Too hot for me, but my husband added it to the make-again list. He ate a few bites as soon as it was finished and then had a plateful a few hours later, and said it was DEFINITELY better once the flavors settled a bit.

Delicious.   Per other reviews I added 1 cup milk with 1 TBS cornstarch (whisked together) to thicken.  I agree with others that 2 cups heavy cream was not enough and needed more liquid.   I used sea scallops cut in half and also cut the red pepper flakes in half.  I used dried seasonings.  Also sauteed the shrimp and scallops in a little olive oil before I mixed with the sauce.  Will make again.

Wow.  I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit!  Based on previous reviews, I did alter some of the ingredients: I halved the white and black pepper and I halved the parsley.  I didn't use the swiss chesse, but instead doubled the parmesan.  I also added a 1/2 block of cream cheese for added texture and flavor.  I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent! But I used half the amount of pepper, omited the swiss & used only parmesan, used 1 pound of shrimp & no scallops. Also the onion is toooo much. Use only 1/4 cup.

Recipe I thought was good but leave the swiss cheese out. Much butter and authentic tasting without it. I am from Cajun Country!!! Also at the beginning use some olive oil and garlic clove first to saute...

I've never written a review before but I had to write one on this recipe.  It was AWESOME!!! My husband said 100 times how good it was. I put in 1lb of shrimp and crab and left out the scallops. I cut back on the red pepper to 1/2t and added minced garlic.  This was super easy and it tasted SO good!! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great. I am not a very good cook and ruin lots of recipes but this one turned out awesome. My husband and I both loved it and ate way too much. After reading some of the other comments I decided to only put in half the pepper also, which I think was smart.

I made this the other night and it was AMAZING. Like something out of a restaurant. My fiance and my 14 month old daughter loved it as well. Definately a keeper! The only changes I made were to the peppers. I hate spicy food, and I was also cooking for a toddler, so I used the whole amount of white pepper, only half the amount of black pepper, and I didn't use any red pepper flakes at all. It came out absolutely perfect, just the right amount of spice. Love love love this recipe!

Heed the warning "divide the amounts of peppers in half."  I am not "weak of tongue" and I couldn't finish a single serving.  I couldn't taste any flavors other than pepper.

Good. I used dried spices/herbs, probably would have been much better with fresh, but still really tasty. I cut the amount of red pepper for my little kids. They both really liked the shrimp.

There is great taste in this recipe but the sauce needs work. When I read the instructions I was not quite sure that 2 cups of heavy cream, once reduced, would be enough to cover an entire box of fetuccini--and it wasn't. And then when I added the seafood the barely working sauce fell apart--became too liquidy. Next time I'm going to use chicken stock & cornstarch to make an actual sauce--then that recipe will be a 6-star meal!

If  you're looking for cajun flavor, you won't find it in this recipe.  Bland, bland, bland...and this is after I added garlic, more pepper and more cheese. I did appreciate the other reviews, that shared their feedback on what to expect.  Sorry to say, this one is getting deleted from my recipe box.

WHOA!! When they said hot, they meant it! I cut the amount of pepper in half and still it was too much for us to enjoy. I might try it again, but will cut the pepper in half again.

I made this for both me and my boyfriend. It was really spicy but oh so good. I exchanged the scallops for chicken because my boyfriend does not like scallops and I think it might have turned up better.

This is good.  If you use sea scallops, be sure to cut into bite site pieces so that the scallops cook at the same time as the shrimp. Also, the red pepper flakes are hottest.  I recommend that you reduce red pepper flakes to 1 tsp, and reduce black pepper to 1 tsp.  This will still give you some heat and a chance to determine what level is best for your family.

WOW!!  Words cannot describe how WONDERFUL this dish is!!  This is hands down one of the best recipes I have ever made!!  This is the kind of dish you want to make when you're looking to impress...not only does it taste FANTASTIC, but it looks so elegant!!

I made a few minor adjustments to the original recipe, per other reviewers suggestions.  In addition to the 2 cups of cream, I added 1 tsp cornstarch disolved in 1 c milk.  I cut back a bit on the peppers as well...only 1 tsp black pepper, and because I didn't have red pepper flakes on hand, I used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, and the full 1 tsp white pepper.  This gave it a nice little kick without being overly spicy.

I didn't use ANY parsley simply because I forgot to add it...but it tasted fine without it!!

Once again...WOW.  Try this recipe...even if you don't like seafood, I think you'll like this!!

Wow!  This is a delicious and versatile recipe.  I did not cut the pepper amounts as suggested by some reviews and found that the spice was perfect for our tastes.  However, I did substitute fat free half and half (thickend with a bit of cornstarch) for the cream and replaced the scallops with crab meat.  While I halved the overall recipe I still used 1/2 pound of each meat.  We thought it was perfect this way, but I am looking forward to experimenting with vegetables, chicken, and such in the future.  Great recipe.

My husband loves the spicy dishes.  I didn't have white pepper but had everything else.  Still had a nice kick to it.  I also substituted crab for scallops after I saw the price for scallops!  It was still excellent.  This will be in my recipe repertoire.

This is the 3rd time I've made this and made it for our New Year's Eve dinner. I leave the recipe as is - it's perfect - and since it was a special occasion, I added 1/2 a pound of lobster to the shrimp and scallops. It was amazing! For those folks that don't like spicy, or expect it to be an alfredo sauce, this one is not for you! And as a side note, if you're making a Cajun seafood recipe - it means spicy SEAFOOD..if you're going to put chicken or beef or pork, or remove or change 1/2 of the ingredients and then say it's horrible, then don't review THIS recipe (I never get that!)..If you want a wonderful seafood dish that amazes your palette with every bite, then this one, AS IS, is pefect! I will continue to make this one and it will continue to be a huge hit, time after time. Thanks for such an awesome recipe! P.S. I tried about 5 times to add a picture, but the site wasn't cooperating..

I held back on the pepper flakes a little and it was still quite spicy.  I'd add them at the end and check for your own tastes.  Otherwise, it was decadent and yummy.  I will make again with the following changes :  I will saute the white part of a sliced leek and a cup of sliced mushrooms.   Then follow as directed.

Cooked this with my daughter for her college roommates when I visited and they all said it was so good. Was a little spicy for some, but overall was very tasty.  They love cheese so we add 1/2 cup more swiss cheese. Yum!

This was fantastic!  I changed it a bit so I could use what I had on hand.  Instead of scallops, I used diced tilapia.  I also substituted shredded mozzarella for the Swiss cheese.  And I used all dried herbs...I didn't have anything fresh in the fridge.  Even though I adapted the recipe to what was in my house...it was still great!  My boyfriend has requested that we make this again...which is unusual for him!  Thanks!

This dish was very spicy with the red pepper flakes and I wish the sauce had thickened more - maybe add some corn starch?  But overall a good recipe.

This was fabulous!  I traded out the thyme for parsley since I had that growing.  I also used Creole seasoning instead of red pepper flakes.  When making the sauce, I added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  This made a thicker sauce which we prefer!

This was excellent.  I modified the recipe a bit.  I used cayenne instead of crushed red pepper and omitted the white pepper.  I also used dried herbs instead of fresh.  All of this was to utilize what was in the pantry instead of buying alot of new ingredients.

Before, I always used an alfredo recipe that contained a lot of butter.  I could barely tell the difference between the two, even though this one did not contain any.

I will definitely make alfredo this way from now on.

Mmmmm, delicious!! I substituted a few ingredients (just used what I had on hand) - didn't have Shrimp, just scallops, and didn't have green onions or fresh herbs so I used fresh chives & leeks & dried parsley, thyme, & basil. I also used a little extra Swiss & parmesan Chs - absolutely delicious! My husband and kids (ages 3 & 4) loved it :)

I made this for the first time several months ago.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  WHOA!  5-alarm fire in my mouth!  My stepdaughter and I could barely eat it, but my hubby loved it!  It cleared out my sinuses, that's for sure!  I made it again and backed waaaaay off the spices, only putting in 1/3 of what it called for.  It was perfect for us.  Once I actually got to taste the seafood and pasta, I loved it!  Great recipe, but beginners who are not used to heat should modify this way down and start off slowly.  Thanks!

This is a very easy and quick recipe packed with great cajun spice! I've always been a fan of cajun and spicy food and this dish doesn't dissappoint. The sauce had a great flavor with just the right amount of kick, without overpowering the delicate flavors of the shrimp and scallops. The only issue I had was that the sauce was a bit thin for my liking, but it was nothing that a pinch of cornstarch wasn't able to fix. I'll definately be making this again!

My boyfriend and I made this dish last night! We were looking for a dish for our scallops.  It was delicious!! At first we only put half the amount of red pepper flakes as people had said but then we put the full amount.  Kinda wish we only used half but it was still really good, but def spicy.  Will make again!

I made ths recipe as a side dish without the shrimp to compliment John Braggs Baked Scallop recipe.  It turned out great even tho I had to use dried herbs.

Delicious with the following changes: I used cilantro instead of parsley (just personal preference, I'm not a fan of parsley :S); 2 tsp of chilis was WAY too much, next time I'll use maybe 1/2 tsp or less; I omitted white pepper and Swiss cheese simply because I didn't have any; used only 1 1/2 tsp salt, and used fresh fettuccine. Excellent recipe, definitely will be making it again.

Everything came out perfect! My boyfriend and I however, did make a few adjustments; used penne instead of fettucine, used a lb of shrimp instead of scallops, had a cup of mushrooms, a cup of ONE cut up cubanella pepper with no seeds or core, and a dash of chili powder. Added more of a kick and kept the sauce from being too thin!

I started out following this recipe as written but the sauce wasn't thickening as it said in the instructions so I got impatient and ended up adding some cream cheese to the sauce. This wasn't the right thing to do because then the sauce thickened too much while eating. I think if I had just left it alone a little bit longer it would've thickened up. I am definitely going to make this again but I won't change a thing next time and just be patient and give the sauce more time to thicken. I'm not sure if its my stovetop but I think the 7-8 minutes is more like 12-15 minutes on my stove. The taste was amazing and it was spicy but I didn't find it too hot.

Everybody really liked this....but there is a lot of chopping invloved...a little labor intensive. And make sure not to let the cream mixture boil...it will curdle!

Couldn't wait to make this recipe after reading all the reviews. My family
loved it and but definitely rich.   
I did cut the white and black pepper in half, added 1/2 tsp cajun pepper  1/2 tsp of crushed peppers not too hot.
I cut the green onions in 1/2 and that's why i gave this recipe a 4 it needs all the green onions for flavor.
took the suggestions of others and added 4 gloves of garlic and sauteed
the garlic and onion together before
adding to the sauce. Good idea!!!
Substitue swissh cheese for shredded monterey jack cheese 1/2 cup with  of mixed romano, parmasean, perconi cheese.  i used was 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups milk with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken. Sauce came out enough  for 4. last I used sauteed chicken  breast and 3 italian sausage was another good suggestion just as tasty as the seafood i am sure,  but i will try it, with seafood next time.

Definately going to making this one again!

I followed the recipe for six serving, there were four for dinner, and absolutely NO leftovers!

Like others, I saute'ed the shrimp & scallops in garlic and wine, but also held back half of the green stuff until closer to the end of the cooking time to let the fresh flavours of the parsley, green onion and basil "pop"

I absoultey loved it! I also sauteed garlic, mushrooms and a shallot before making the sauce then added while the sauce was thickening. Also instead of cooking the scallops in the dish, sear them in peanut oil or some sort of high temp oil, then add them in the last 2 or 3 minutes of cooking the sauce. This will keep them from becoming rubbery. A very HOT HOT spicy meal. I love it I love it!!!

Very Good.  I did follow some of the advice from other reviewers.  Doubled liquid, just used shrimp(2#'s), added slightly steamed broccoli.  I loved it as did my wife and four friends.  One said that they would have to tone down the pepper for their child.

Excellent recipe.  Extremely easy and delicious. My husband gave it 4 1/2 stars.  I gave it 4- only because of the pepper.  I did cut it back a little.  Next time I will cut pepper in half.

This was wonderful. Better than a restaurant quality seafood pasta dish. I did use slightly less red pepper flakes than the recipe called for - and I'm glad I did because it still had a lot of bite. I made this for a dinner party with friends a couple of weeks ago, and they're still talking about it.

Me & my hubby LOVED this pasta dish! We love spicy food and this was perfect! I used half-n-half instead of heavy cream, omitted the parsey and scallops and used dried herbs. It turned out great and was pretty easy for a beginner like me! If you don't like REALLY spicy food I would definitely cut down on the peppers to tame it down (and keep a glass of milk around!). :) This is definitely a keeper in the recipe box! :)

It was great! I began by saute mushrooms and orange/yellow peppers with a clove of garlic. I then heated the cream and added the mushrooms and peppers with the rest of the ingrediants. I also used 3/4 Lb. of prawns and 1Lb. scallops and added 1 can of crabmeat.
YUMMY!

I joined allrecipes simply to be able to review this amazing pasta!  I have used a lot of recipes from here, but never felt compelled to review any.  This pasta is out of this world.  I used cayenne pepper (it's what I had on hand), used all shrimp, added one garlic clove, cut back on the parsley, used 1 1/4 cup of the whipping cream and 1 cup of half & half.  I may try it with some milk next time to bring the fat down.  I didn't use any white pepper, but it still had a nice kick.  You could do spicier or less spicy - it's such an easy recipe.  Thank you for this excellent recipe!  Next time I'll add some sauteed chicken.

My husband really liked this dish. I took some leftovers to my Mom's and she loved it. Even my little boys (7 year twins) liked it. Although I only used 2 tsp of black pepper and 1 tsp of the red, my boys could only eat a little bit of it because it was still a little too hot. The only time consuming part of this recipe is chopping the fresh herbs by hand. Other than that, it is simple and delicious!

Halved the red pepper, didn't have any white so didn't add, used 1/2 amount dried basil and thyme. Added sauteed mushrooms ~3/4 cup. Served over garlic and spinach flavored fetuccine. Yum!

This is AWESOME!  Can't wait to try it with chicken.  Cut this recipe in half to accomodate just my husband and myself, there is no way our kids would have been able to eat this.  It was hot but it had great flavor.  That swiss gives it good flavor.  Don't be afraid to add some gaaaaarlic!

This recipe turned out wonderful...I followed the advice of other reviewers and halfed all three peppers.  I can't even imagine what it would have been like with them at their suggested measurements!  Talk about food with a kick!  This was a simple dish to make but you have to watch the cream while it heats and stir constantly so it does not scorch on the bottom.  The taste was fantastic and everyone agreed to make again.

This dinner is restaurant quality. I did add mushrooms(cooked first in butter) and slivered sweet red peppers. I omitted the shrimp. It wasn't hot enough for me, so I added more red pepper. This is a fantastic recipe. Thanks!!!

This recipe has good potential! Very good base but way too much pepper. Even at half it wipes out the delicate taste of the scallops. Use very little pepper or use chili peppers instead. A lighter version can substitute the 2 cups of cream for 1 1/2 cups cream with 1/2 milk, or 1 1/2 cream and 1/2 cup white wine. My experience says do not every use the full amount of pepper!

This was fantastic, and we used frozen scallops and shrimp. I also added an 8 oz can of crab meat. The only thing is I disliked the after taste of the white pepper... I wont be using that ever again. It had plenty of kick for us and after the addition of the seafood it really had great flavor. I plan to make it for the kids next time and decrease the spice. Does anyone know a healthier variation that worked ie: milk instead of heavy cream etc?

This has been a staple recipe in my kitchen for two years. That warrants a review. Even my picky daughter loves it, though I make it a tad milder for her. As others have said, it is NOT Alfredo but it IS delicious...as is. I sometimes add broccoli and/or mushrooms and always use only scallops because that is the way we like it.

Great recipe!! I enjoy heat but I'm not a mouthburning lover, so I eased up a bit on the peppers. It was still hot but enjoyable to my taste buds. I didn't thicken the sauce because first time out I wanted to honor the recipe. And I thought it was perfect. I wouldn't add flour to it at all. I'm not sure what people think this sauce is but it's perfectly fine. Actually, way better than fine. It's Cajun culinary magic!! Thanks, Star, for reminding me that I need to get my cajun butt back to N'awlins!

This pasta is awesome!  I changed a few things due to the recommendations of others.  I sauteed the green onions in butter with green pepper, mushrooms and garlic before adding it to the cream.  Also, I used half the amount of red pepper flakes and it still had a kick to it.  I also used dried basil and thyme as I didn't have fresh available.

This was very good.  I did not put in all the pepper it called for, and I am glad!  I used the crushed red pepper and one teaspoon of the black pepper. I did not put any white pepper in.  It had a kick to it, but did not overwhelm the flavors of the shrimp or scallops.  My husband loved it.

I made this just as it is written.  And WHEW it's spicy!  I think my mouth and tongue are starting to liquify. LOL! If you don't like spicy food - you'll definitely have to make adjustments.  But it's REALLY yummy!  Thanks very much!

I was surprised this turned out so well for me since I cheated and used dried herbs, skipped the scallops, parsley and Swiss cheese.  I used herb and garlic fettuccine pasta which really added flavor and I doubled the red pepper flakes.  My hubby gave it rave reviews.  This is going in my recipe box to try again.

This is an absolutely fantastic dish. I put slightly more basil and plenty more chilli flakes. I don't really get why the 2 cheeses but used them anyway. I've done this one a couple of times and served with egg taglietelli and both times I got extra brownie points.

This pasta is GREAT!!  I have made it twice for my family and each time, it has been a hit!  The first time, I added brocolli and the second time I added mushrooms.  My family is at the table eating now and all I hear is forks hitting the bowls!!!

This is fantastic.  My two adult sons (19 and 22) raved over it.  I did cut down on the pepper amounts (1/2 t. black pepper, 1/4 t. white pepper, 1/2 t. red pepper flakes) because I could tell it would be too hot for me at the recipe amounts.  I used 1 cup of cream and 1 cup of milk instead of 2 cream, and it was probably a little more thin than it would have been with full cream.  The fresh herbs really make the sauce.  I served it over rice instead of noodles, and it was perfect.  I just wish my husband wasn't allergic to shellfish, or I would make this all the time.  I'm going to try it with chicken for him to see how it is.  Yummy.

This was delicious!  I used Whole grain fettucini.  I also added a teaspoon of cajun seasoning.  Added chopped clams and scallops also.  Used a bag of Italian cheese instead of swiss.  It was outstanding.  Also tossed in 2 large cloves of garlic.  WONDERFUL!

I made this last night and and it was great.
I'm not sure why people complained about the sauce not being thick enough - it doesn't claim to be an alfredo sauce.  Plus, I am about as inexperienced with cooking as you can get and I thought my sauce was the perfect thickness.  I followed the recipe exactly with only 3 changes.  1 - I did not use white pepper because I didn't have any.  2 - I used dried herbs because it is less expensive than keeping fresh in the fridge. 3 - the grocery store I was at did not have scallops so I used lump crab meat (which I actually prefer anyways).  Oh and I also sauteed the shrimp ahead of time in extra cajun seasoning.  I made the pasta with cheesy garlic biscuits and asparagus.   It was amazing - and my boyfriend, who is not the biggest fan of seafood, loved it too. I looove spicy food and this dish was the perfect amount of spice and flavor.

I made this for Valentines Day 2011. It was wonderful! The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because the sauce didn't thicken, and I think 1 1/2 tsp. of Red Pepper flakes is too much if you're planning of a child eating it. My husband raved about the sauce and the scallops (I was in Heaven, lol). So DEF give this recipe a try!! You won't be disappointed :)

This was well received by all and easy to make but I would not use whipping cream next time, but make a white sauce  maybe add wine and use blend to cut back on the fat but I certainly will keep the seasoning the same, it was a hit.

This was pretty good. Definately not a "seafood alfredo" type dish.. it was more just a spicy sauce to go over the pasta. I left out the white pepper (after reading the other reviews) and used alot of mozz/parm cheese and a little nutmeg in the sauce. Its pretty good.. just very hot! We thought it was a little too cajun for a pasta dish. I'll try this again and maybe leave out the cajun seasoning and try to make a creamier more alfredo style version of this.

Good stuff- there is a modifications to the procedure needed, though.  I would recommend adding the shredded cheese in small amounts BEFORE adding the seafood.  If you put it in after it gets clumpy, and it's hard to stir without breaking up the scallops. I also omitted the white pepper and added a few dashes of lemon pepper and old bay, which really brightened the flavor.  At the end because my cheese was clumpy the sauce didn't thicken very well, so I stirred in a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in cold water and let it simmer a few more minutes.  My seafood was overcooked at this point but it still tasted fine. Also, I added about a cup of surimi which was amazing I'll definitely be making these changes when I make this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious pasta recipe! The sauce is a little on the salty side so don't pour too much sauce on the pasta at once - add to taste. The saltiness, though, is perfect for the thickness of the fettuccine noodles.   I added 1/2 a tbsp of minced garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper instead of white pepper to the sauce.   Separately, we brined the raw shrimp and scallop in kosher salt water for a few minutes then sauteed the shrimp and scallop in a little bit of olive oil, butter, garlic, and some old bay seasoning with chopped green onions. We later added the sauteed shrimp and scallop mix to the sauce.   As other reviewers have noted, if you do not like pepper, this is not for you. My family loves spicy, peppery foods, so this was delicious. The red pepper flakes added the perfect kick.

Instead of heavy cream, I used fat free skim milk. I cut down on the salt and peppers (it just seemed like a lot). This recipe is really good.

Now I know why I never use heavy cream...it's sinfully delicious.  This pasta is now on my top 10 recipes list.  I did make some changes.  I used 1/2 the amount of peppers (kids had to eat it, by the way they loved it too).  1/2 cup parsley, 1/2 cup green bell pepper and 1 clove garlic.  I didn't have enough swiss cheese so I added mozzarella cheese.  My sauce thickened up just fine for me.  However, I did save some of the pasta water just in case.  I did use the pasta water the next day when reheating the pasta for my husband's lunch.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

This recipe is fantastic.  I took CHEFSINGLEDAD's advice and added the additional cup of milk with the tsp of cornstarch.  Also, just to step it up a notch I seared some hot italian sausage (sliced in bite sized pieces) before making the sauce and added them back in when I added the shrimp and scallops.  Wow - I love the combination of spicy sausage and shrimp.  Perfect!

My husband took the leftovers to work and everyone asked him what restaurant it was from.  Excellent made as directed (I didn't think it was too spicy, but that's all relative), also good subbing fat-free half & half for the cream to cut fat/calories.  Also good with all shrimp, or shrimp & chicken, or just chicken, etc, etc.  I change things up a bit - add 1 clove of minced garlic (no pasta recipe is complete in my book without garlic) and I cook the scallops/shrimp separate and then add to the sauce at the end of cooking.  Also good with added sauteed mushrooms and/or bacon.

Oh, this was so good... I did make a few changes 1)I used smoked sausage instead of scallops(my kids). 2) Used dried herbs instead of fresh(on hand). 
I think that the sausage gave it even more of a cajun taste. 
I have made this dish twice now and I know that I will be making it again and again.

A great shrimp dish.  I did not use scallops but doubled up on the shrimp.  I used 2 ounces of spaghetti with 1/2 pound of small shrimp (1 serving).  The sauce (2 servings) is very easy and tastes absolutely great.  I did add a little extra milk to thin the sauce only very slightly. I will lighten up on the pepper next time (to 1/4 teaspoon each), as it was a little hot.    I agree with other reviewers; don’t start the pasta until the shrimp is cooked.

This is so good! I made it a little different by using an alfredo packet for the sauce, but added in the same spices. It was really good, and cut down on having to buy cream, which I never have handy.

FANTASTIC!  Loved the spicy kick & heat of the dish.  I did double the sauce, and used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the heavy cream.  Just thickened a little bit with cornstarch at the end.  Just substituted to save a little on fat/calories.  Also, I just had to add a little garlic.  I have to put garlic in EVERYTHING...I think it is some kind of condition that needs medical attention with therapy and/or medication! :) Thank-you for your wonderful recipe!

This was awesome.  I made the changes recommended by Luvs2cook4u.  One warning, however.  We had white wine with this dish and ended up drinking way too much!  This is a spicy one and the wine just was perfect, as was the conversation!

Great recipe! I used mozarella and parmesan cheeses instead of Swiss and parmesan. Also used chicken and hot Italian sausage instead of seafood. It was a hit for Valentines Day!!!

This is an excellent recipe!! If you want a little less fat try fat free half and half instead of the heavy whipping cream. You can't tell the difference.

This is the best! After reading reviews, the only things I changed were to half the amounts of the three peppers and only used shrimp. It still had plenty of heat and all plates were cleaned! Thanks so much for the recipe!

AWESOME!  Delicious!  We omitted the scallops and used some pre-cooked, frozen shrimp and it was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I both LOVED it.  I would actually serve this for company it was so good!  It IS spicy though- so if you have litte ones or people who do not care for as much spice- I would cut the spices in half.  But we enjoyed the spice as is!  Thanks for a great recipe!

For a 5 star recipe, which has been reviewed by over 300+, both my husband and I were extreamly disappointed with this dish. The only seasoning, which we teate in this recipe is the red pepper, and I had cut that down to 1 tsp.

My fiance and I are both seafood lovers, so when I came across this recipe I had to make it! We both thought it was delicious, except for it was really spicy. Really really spicy. I'm going to make it again tonight, but cut the peppers down a little bit. Since we're being health conscious, though, I'm thinking of using half and half or just regular whipping cream. I'll let you know how it comes out!

Very easy and very tasty recipie.  Fair warning... its got a great kick to it.  For me this was awesome... for my kids... not so much.    Second and third time I made it I toned it down.  The white pepper being the most important.

Really good, really fast. I made a couple small changes... half-and-half, bay scallops, and gouda instead of swiss. I was really, really happy to have leftovers. The fresh herbs were delicious. Next time I won't make as much pasta. (There will be a next time!)

This was so good! I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream, and it was still amazing. I would strongly suggest cutting the salt, or leaving it out all together-way too salty. I added more cream to balance and saved the dish. This was a real winner!

I tried this recipe and it was fabulous!!! My boyfriend and roomate both went crazy over it (They went back for thirds!!!). I ended up using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream and it came out just as great. Definetly restaurant quality.

Ok, I totally screwed this up...but it still came out good. I used fat free half and half, but then I kind of overcompensated when it did not thicken at all (like the recipe said the cream should)...so I added cornstarch. Then, when I added the cheese it turned to glue. Fortunately, I just added some more milk and it was OK. Sauteed some red peppers and mushrooms, plus garlic and onions seperately. I like spicy food and I would not add all of the red pepper flakes if I make again. I would use the ff half and half again I just would not add any thickener until after the cheese step (I also only added parmasan). Anyway my personal meal came out about a 3.5 star but I am sure with all the cheese and cream and following directions it would be a five. Thanks!

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and definitely better than any seafood pasta dish I’ve eaten in a restaurant! I made this on Valentines for my husband and we both loved it!  I cut the pepper amounts in ½ and didn’t find it too spicy.  I couldn’t find scallops at the time so used 1lb. of shrimp, thought it could have used more and will definitely add scallops next time.  The only other thing I might change is to increase the amount of sauce or use less pasta…just because there didn’t seem to be enough sauce when eating leftovers.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe, it is one I will make often!

This is an excellent dish!!! My husband said to give this dish 9 1/2 stars. He really likes seafood.
You feel like you just ate at red lobster. I cut all the peppers in half and it  still had plenty of spice to it. Will be making this once a month.

I made this dish as a candlelight dinner for my boyfriend. He loved it so much and couldnt stop raving about how wonderful and tasty this dish was. I served it with some white wine, italian bread etc. and it was perfect. Really, restaurant quality.
I followed the receipe almost to the tee, however I halfed the amount of pepper recommened and it was still hot. 
I will definetly make this dish again and again.

We followed the recipe exactly and all enjoyed.  The sauce was heavy but that was expected using heavy cream.  We will make again, however will try using half/half instead of the cream to make it a "little" lighter.  I also did add 3/4 lb of bay scallops instead of 1/2 lb. Yummy!!

My husband and I LOVED it! I just made a couple of slight changes based on what I had on hand. For the peppers I used 1 tsp Cajun seasoning, 1 tsp ground red pepper and a couple turns of the black pepper mill. I used all dried herbs, 1 tsp each of basil and ground thyme and 1/4 cup parsley. Hubby said it was the perfect amount of heat to complement and not overwhelm the sweet seafood. Next time I'll use fresh parsley which I think will give it even better flavor. A definite keeper!

Only changes made were no white pepper 1/2 the pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon of Cajun seasoning...I also put a tablespoon of flour for a little more thickness and 2 cloves of fresh garlic minced and I accidentally forgot the cheese but everyone loved it...so this works with or without cheese

I made this recipe today and it was amazing! If you are sensitive to spicy food: reduce the amount of red pepper flakes. It is intense! I also added about a TBSP of butter to make the sauce a little less dry. But it was a hit in my house and I know if you try it you will love it! Thanks!

I've made this quite a few times with the suggestions that were made and it always turns out great and is a huge success.  I also like adding a can of roasted tomatoes and mushrooms for extra texture.  Definitely a go-to when you want to make a meal that is slightly more memorable.

I thought this pasta was absolutely delicious. I served it to my boyrfiend and my fried, who both really enjoyed it. It was fairly simple to make and was a nice dinner. The only request I have is that the recipe owner put cook time and prep time with the recipe. I like toknow how much time I need for a meal so I can plan around it. I also don't cook seafood that often, so helpful tips on how long the shrimp and scallops should cook for would be appreciated. Other than that, great job and thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This recipe was easy to make with not a lot of steps to follow. My wife isn't a big fan of spicy food, so next time I make this I'm going to reduce the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon or even remove it all together.

Thanks for this recipe

This recipe is delicious! I don't like seafood all that much but my husband loves it. This was the perfect recipe for us. I added 1/2 tsp of Canjun Blackening seasoning and just followed the recipe to the tee. We will definitely be having this again.

Holy cow, very spicy but tolerable and I like spicy food, I added small diced bell pepper and was perfect. Will try this with sliced grilled chicken, super yummy! This sauce would also hold up to a penne.

Simply Amazing as is. It's spicy but not tongue burning hot. It's a light sauce which is exactly what I was looking for. Add a couple tsp of Bay seasoning for that extra cajun taste but unless you like a lot of salt then don't add the salt earlier, or not.

Yummy! Instead of getting scallops, I just added a whole pound of shrimp.  I did not add the white pepper and used only half of the red and black.  My fiance is a wimp when it comes to spice.  I just love fresh herbs.  I added lots of dill as well and thought this was so good.  I will def be making this again!

Usually the hotter the better for us, but this one was WAY too hot for our taste!  We halved the peppers and it was still too hot for the even the adults...the sauce w/o the pepper was good though.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  We reheated it the day after we made it, and it tasted even better the second day!  The spiciness was toned down a bit.  We like spicy foods, but when we make it again, we'll probably cut back on some of the pepper.

This was a huge hit with my family and I would definitely make it for guests.  I doubled the amount of both scallops and shrimp.  I didn't have any swiss cheese so I used mozzarella and I wouldn't do that again - there is too much moisture in mozzarella.  I didn't add any thickening agent as some others had suggested and I had no problem getting the sauce to thicken - but it did take longer than 8 minutes.  Don't cook the pasta until the sauce is just about done.  It takes longer than you think and the sauce can stay warm on the lowest setting on your stove and covered...just don't keep the heat up because then the seafood will overcook and get rubbery.  Thank you for this recipe Star!

excellent recipe.  Made some canges which worked great for me. 1 1/2 tbs olive oil heated in a wok add 1 tbs chopped garlic, fry for a a minute add the the shrimp and sliced mushrooms.  Once the shrimp turns opaque remove the contents with slotted spoon in a bowl.  Now add the cream and all ingredients per recipe.  cook for 5 mins and add the shrimp and mushroom into the sauce.  follow per recipe after this.   The result fantastic

I left out the white pepper and used 1 lb of frozen shrimp instead of .5 lb of shrimp and scallops. I also let the sauce simmer for about 10-15 min before I added it to the cooked pasta to let it thicken a bit more. Delicious!

I loved this recipe !  I used dried basil and tyme because I didn't have fresh on hand also added 2 cloves of garlic minced and 1 teaspoon of cajun spice .  I love seafood so I added 1 extra cup of shrimp .  I also used mozorella instead og swiss .  MAKE SURE YOU ADD SEAFOOD LAST .  You don't want to over cook it .

This was great. I made it valentines day for my boyfriend and he had no complaints, and neither did I. I want to do this again because I messed up on one of the ingredients. I would also like to make it a little spicier!

I made this for my husband last night. I followed the recipe almost exact. I omitted the white pepper and the addtional half tsp of red pepper flakes. Believe me it was plenty spicy (and my husband LOVES spicy). It came out perfect! Definitely restaurant quality in flavor and presentation.  Rest assured I will make this again. I highly recommend anyone considering making this recipe, go for it....you'll be happy you did!

I tweaked the recipe and made this for myself and my college friends, and we loved it! Since we wanted something with more of an Alfredo taste, I simply added about 1 cup more of cream and more mozzarella and Parmesan cheese-don't use the Swiss!!! Also, I sauteed the onions and added mushrooms in about 1/4 cup of butter, and then added the whipping cream, etc. I reduced the pepper amounts and enjoyed the lighter amount. Also, dried basil and thyme worked fine. I was worried about cooking the shrimp all the way through, so I sauteed that in butter, set it aside, and added it in the end. I did the same thing with chicken chunks. Very delicious

I only had the parmesan cheese, but otherwise was able to use the recipe as calls, it was so yummy!  My whole family ate it up.  I left out the pepper flakes because of my little ones, but it was still wonderful!

With a few changes this is definitely a five star recipe.  It needs a clove or more of garlic and a 1/4 cup of red bell pepper sauteed with the green onions before adding the heavy cream. It is also very good with mozzarella cheese instead of Swiss, and adding a healthy spoonful of Cajun seasoning didn't hurt either.

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL, I thought I must have been in a 5 star restaurant. I cut back on the heat by adding only 1/2 teaspoon chilli flakes (crushed) and 1/8th teaspoon pepper. I used 600 mls of cream so I thickened it slightly with some cornflour at the end. PERFECT. I served with mushroom tagliettele. Thanks for sharing - a sure recipe for a fancy dinner party, guaranteed compliments.

Made this for dinner last night and everyone loved it! I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream, dried thyme instead of fresh, vidalia onion instead of greem, and bow tie pasta instead of fettuccine(what I had on hand). I had leftover cooked shrimp from shrimp cocktail and I added these in the very last minute after the sauce was made so they just heated through...didnt want to make them rubbery. I did sautee onion,garlic, and diced green pepper in a little evoo. That combo to me is in a lot of Cajun dishes so I used that as my base for the sauce. I also added 4oz. of cream cheese to make it a little richer since I used the FF half and half. My biggest addition was to add quite a bit of Cajun seasoning. It really kicked up this dish. Will make again. Thanks!

Very creamy and very rich.  I used a dash of garlic salt to make it feel more Italian.  Otherwise, I liked the spices.  I also used baby scallops.  yummy

LOVED the recipe! Thanks so much for sharing. I did make a couple chages. I used 1 cup of shredded swiss cheese and also added 1/4 cup of milk (it was just a tad thick for me). Make sure you let the herbs/seasonings and onion simmer for about 10 mins to let all the flavors mix well. Thanks again for the fantasic recpie!

I cut the red pepper in half since we are somewhat weak of tounge as the author puts it. I halved 1 clove of garlic and added that to the sauce while cooking for extra flavor. Fish it out befor serving though. The sauce tightens up quickly once the cheeses are added so be prepared to thin it with a bit of milk or pasta water if you like that. Overall we are pleased and will make this again very soon.

Great recipe....We used to love the Cajun Seafood Pasta from the Cheesecake Factory and they no longer have it on their menu.  This is just like it and even better.  I usually use just shrimp and everything else I follow....it is spicy, which we love, so if you are not a big fan of spicy dishes, you might want to tone down the peppers.  Spicy lovers, you will love this one!  It is a keeper recipe!

This was SUPER easy, very quick, and very good. That being said, I really didn't want to give this recipe 5 stars due to the changes that I had to make, but I do want people to try this recipe. I love spicy food but did have to cut all the pepper amounts in half. I would also recommend only using a quarter amount of the salt recommended and then adjusting right before you add the shrimp in. Remember, cheese can be very salty too. I only added 1 teaspoon of salt and I ended up adding a cup of milk to the sauce to make up for the saltiness. Next time I will add half a teaspoon of salt and work from there. I also used dried thyme. I only had spagetti, which I don't care for, but in this dish, it worked well. Can't wait to try it next time with fettucine (and no milk).

Let me start out by saying that in my family of 5 adults, it is very rare that I serve something for dinner that everyone likes.  Well, everyone liked this meal.  I did cut the amount of all of the peppers in half because it just seemed like a little too much heat for us, but that was the only change made.  The dish was easy and quick to prepare making it perfect for a weeknight dinner, but tastes like you fussed over it.  Serve with homemade Italian bread for a hearty meal.

This has a great cream sauce with just the right amount of herbs and spices.  I make it often.  It's best served immediately after the sauce is poured over the fettuccine.

Like others, it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked it. I think eliminating the Swiss cheese would improve this. I cut back on the amount of pepper, and added fresh garlic, and a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste to make a "pink" sauce. That was a nice combination. Made a beautiful accompaniment to our New Year's dinner of stuffed flounder and crab cakes.

I absolutely love this very unique recipe!  I made very minor changes to the sauce - I ommitted the parsley and the white pepper.  I think the swiss helps to balance out the spicy and the green onions are essential.  I add veggies to make for a more well-balanced meal.  Thanks for sharing!  I look forward to making this dish again!

I made this for my husband and we've had it once a week for the past year. He loved it!  I did make a few minor changes though. I substituted the scallops with imitation chunk crab meat and substituted the Swiss cheese with Pepper Jack for a little extra kick.  It's probably one of the easiest and best tasting meals I've made!  Goes great with some crescent rolls.

yum yum yum!  great comfort food.  i sauteed some veggies (mushrooms, zucchini, peppers, broccoli) in butter, then added the raw scallops & shrimp & cooked until done.  i made the sauce (the used nonfat half & half -- worked great!) in a seperate pan, then added the g. onions & spices as directed.  i combined the seafood/veggies, sauce & cooked noodles when everything was ready.  Delish!

Great Recipe.  Not overly spicy at all!  Instead of mixing the shrimp and scallops directly into the sauce,  I seasoned them separately with Tony Chacheres Original Creole Seasoning, garlic powder and leftover parsley and sauteed them in butter.  Awesome restaurant quality dish!

Very very good.  I substituted dried herbs for fresh, used 3 tbsp dried parsley and 1 lb large shrimp instead of 1/2 lb.  Might try it with fresh herbs next time.  It is quite spicy as written, but we really enjoyed it.

This was amazing. We had friends over to try celebrate my birthday and try out my new pasta machine last night and decided to make this for the occasion. Everyone loved it! We cut back a bit on the red pepper flakes as it seemed like too much. It was still plenty spicy.

We had the herbs in the cream for about 20 minutes as the pasta making took longer than expected. It seemed to release even more flavor this way.

Will DEFINITELY make this again very soon!

Oh wow! Not the most healthy meal I've ever had but oh boy was it ever delicious! I followed the recipe except for cutting down a bit on the pepper and adding some creole spice mix I had at home. Thank you for this posting!

This is an awesome recipe.  A few things I did made all the difference.  Instead of Cayenne pepper, I substituted 2tsp. red curry.  I cut the black pepper in half.  It still has a kick to it, but the taste is fantastic.  It is my brother's favorite dish.  NEVER TRY TO MAKE WITH LOWFAT.  It comes out runny and the cheese doesn't melt smoothly.

Fantastic recipe!  I changed the recipe slightly.  I sauteed 2 cups sliced mushrooms in butter until brown and them added 1/4 cup white white.  After the wine evaporated off, I added 5% light cream.  Did not use the chili peppers or the white pepper.  Served it over green / white linguine.

This was awesome!  I changed my serving to 4 and I also made some changes.  For one, I sauteed the shrimp seperately in garlic, butter, and cajun seasoning, I also used calamari.  I added them into the sauce at the very end.  I used all of the seasonings, expect I also added 1/2 a cup of milk to the whipping cream.  I definitely recommend this recipe, it's easy and delicious!

Way too peppery for us.  We loved the "seafood fetteccine" way better. Even for Cajun it was waaaayyy too peppery.  I would still cut the pepper down by half.

This is very, very good. I follow the recipe exactly but I only use a little thyme when I make it now. I discovered I'm not a big fan of thyme the first time I made this but I didn't want to omit it completely. Thanks.

This is one of my families new favorites. I do use light cream rather than heavy just cut down the fat. I also cut down the spice a little. It is delicious!

This recipe is awesome! I did make a few changes for health reasons; I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and I used whole grain pasta instead of regular pasta. It was delish! I truly believe if I had not made those modifications, and followed it to a t, it would've still been great.

This is a very flavorful sauce. Although I toned down the pepper, and decreased the amount of green onion and parsley, this is definitely being added to my list of favorites.

Wow!!! Loved it. I left out some of the ingredients I don't like(basil,thyme,scallops) combined 2 ingredients from 2 prior ratings (1 tsp of cajun seasoning and 1 cup milk w/1  tsp flour) it was awesome.

Awesome recipe.  The only thing I did different was to use 3 teaspoons of Emeril Lagasse's Bayou Blast in place of the 3 peppers.  It was wonderful and my kids loved it.  Wasn't spicy, just very flavorful.  Served with a warm Artisan bread and French Merlot (no, the kids had milk).  Add candlelight and you have the perfect pasta dinner.

This recipe was phenomenal! My boyfriend and I love spicy and this dish lived up to the task. I prefer bay scallops to sea scallops, but couldn't find any so instead, I added a can of lump crab meat and a can of whole baby clams . . . threw some sliced fresh mushrooms in and it was absolutely delicious. Next time, I might cut down the amount of crushed red pepper to half . . . a bit too spicy of a dish for the middle of summer. Even our ears were sweating! But other than that, wouldn't change a thing.

Excellent dish! I sauted some fesh mushrooms in olive oil until light brown & soft - I added them with the shrimp. I used 1 lb shrimp and also stirred in at the very end 4 imitation crab legs sliced in rounds.

I use half and half and whipping cream. I also use shrimp, crab and scallops and like always, this dish has been excellent. I don't add the pepper and sometimes I add broccoli. All in all, play with it--but its great!

This is a really awesome dish! I love spicy food and made the recipe as is but decreased the amount of parsley to about 3/4 cup. This is a flavorful and not too heavy like a lot of cream dishes tend to be. Perfect! Thanks.

I used 1/2 the white pepper and no red pepper flakes and it had enough kick for me.  I used all dry herbs (instead of fresh), so I reduced to about 3/4 T each.  
I used the seafood, but I also added chicken for the non-seafood lovers. (I added cajun seasoning to the chicken and grilled it).  it was excellent with chicken as well.

This was tasty. I mixed Rotini pasta in with the sauce to make it easier to serve, but I think it was a mistake. It's a good. creamy sauce that needs to be poured over pasta, not mixed with. I did use only black and red peppers with this, and it was spicy enough. This is a keeper!

This is my 4th or 5th time making this recipe. It's rather simple. I've tried it several ways..w/milk, 1/2&1/2, and cream. They all turn out great. Of course, for a richer base, use cream. Only thing different is that I add red/yellow peppers for color and maybe a 3/4 teaspoon old bay for extra flavor. I also added lump crabmeat AND lobster. Please DO NOT use imitation...it defeats the purpose.

This was awsome.  I will make this for a dinner party next time.  I had problems with the thickening so I added 2 teaspoons of corn starch. Was very easy to prepare.  Thought I was at Olive Garden for dinner!!

What a great meal this was!!  Not too difficult or time consuming either. I added sauteed fresh garlic in olive oil for a minute then added the heavy cream. Next time I will try fat free half and half like another reviewer did. I used the "fresh" basil from a tube, because I hate buying basil that goes bad within 2 days (1st time trying this product, and its great!). I used ALL shrimp, but next time would like to try the scallops also, even though we did not miss the scallops at all. I also added sauteed chicken breast. One suggestion for next time is I would take the tails off the shrimp before cooking, just because it is much easier too eat that way. I did not add the swiss cheese (didn't have any). I will definately be making this again!!

A wonderful dish!  One hint, if you want to tone it down just a touch, add some fresh veggies like mushrooms and red peppers and use a little more half and half.  It isn't as spicy that way.

Big hit at our house the other night!  I did tone down the red pepper flakes for me and the kids, however, my husband added more to his serving.  His spicy or our mild - delicious!  I used all shrimp and cooked it separately in a little butter and crushed garlic and tossed it in right before serving - less chance of it getting over cooked!  Also cut back on parsley - it just seemed like too much.  Everything else I kept the same, which is rare thing for me.  Only one problem...the calories!  I usually work out several times a week so that I can eat what I want, however, since eating this I have been doing an extra half hour on the elliptical over the guilt. Of course all the wine I drank with it didn't help...

My husband and I didn't like this very much.  I didn't like the way all the heat came from pepper.  I think the pepper should be decreased and chilis should be added.  I also thought the green onions were a little overpowering.  It wasn't bad, but it didn't taste like cajun to me.  This was just OK.

Never have I been inclined to rate a recipe until now!  I never knew that food this good could ever come out of my kitchen!!  If you love creamy and cheesy foods as much as I do, this recipe is a MUST TRY (it's easy too).  My bf did not enjoy it as much as I did, only b/c he's not a huge fan of creamy cheesy goodness.  My changes: reduce cream by 1/2 cup to keep sauce thick, reduce peppers b/c bf is a wuss, use all shrimp, add a variety of mushrooms.  But besides that, I stayed true to the recipe in all other respects and the results were phenomenaltabulous!  Fit for gods.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was a hit at girls night. It was so great everyone wanted the recipe. 

I only made a few modification from what the other reviews suggested: 
Meat: used shrimp, and chicken (instead of all scallops)
Dairy: used 1/4 Whipping cream and 3/4 half and half of what the recipe asked for
Herbs:  used dried thyme and basil,
added 1 tablespoon of minced garlic
Pepper:  only added what recipe said for black paper, and red pepper added. added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper to make up for white pepper. Did not use any white pepper. 
vegetables: 1 ½ cups red bell peppers, 1 ½ cups fresh bella mushrooms
Precooked: sauteed the  shrimp and chicken before adding to cream sauce. Cooked shrimp in olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice. 
Cheese: used fresh Swiss  and grated Parmesan cheese

Cooked the shrimp, cream and herbs together for about 45 minutes so shrimp and chicken could absorb the flavor, added cheese in last 10 minutes of cooking.

Great recipe - very peppery as is though ... even Puerto Rican husband thought it was very spicy.  Will reduce the pepper next time around.

Excellent recipe! However I modified it slightly since I prefer more sauce. I increased the heavy whipping cream to 3 cups instead of two as well as adding 1/4c more of the swiss cheese and a 1/4c more of the parmesan cheese.I also added a 12 oz bag of bay scallops and a 12oz bag of shrimp.

This is easily my favorite dish to make.  Some advice about reheating:  If you have any of the cheeses remaining you can add a little milk and a sprinkle of cheese and reheat in a sauce pan.  It brings the sauce back to life.  I normally increase the sauce by 1/2 as well.  I've added sausage, scallops, shrimp, crawfish, crab and all manner of meats to this.

Yummmmmmy, I have actually made this about 7 times. I did reduce the amount of pasta by a quarter and also eliminated the white pepper. Added extra basil and a couple cloves of crushed garlic. Everyone who has tried it has loved it.

Thanks

I was really expecting this to be awesome based upon the reviews, but I was actually disappointed!  I love spicey food, and used the spices as written in the recipe.  The pepper really overwhelms the rest of the ingredients, making it a "one flavor recipe" in my opinion.  I guess if you are a pepper lover, you would like this, but it is rather plain in it's flavor in my opinion. I like dishes with a variety of flavors in them, and this is very monotonous!

A wonderful treat! After reading the other reviews, I added 1 cup milk and 1 T. corn starch for extra sauce, and I threw in some pre-cooked sausage with the shrimp and scallops. I loved the creamy, cheesy flavor, and my boyfriend loved the peppery kick. A huge hit with both of us.

This dish was very tasty. The recipe calls for 1//2lb shrimp and 1/2lb scallops, but I used 1lb each. It came out fine, making me believe that 1/2lb may be too little for anyone desiring chunky servings, like I do. I also added quartered tomatoes for color. The whipping cream never tightened, so I had to add some rue: 2 tblsp flour + 1.5 tblsp olive oil blended together in a small cup, then mixed into the hot whipping cream/herb sauce. In the end, it was very good.

Definitely not for the faint of heart. I cut the pepper amounts by about 1/3, and it still was spicy! I also used 1 lb. of shrimp, which tasted great. Pretty quick and easy to make.

Seems kinda silly to add my review, since there are so many, but couldn't resist.  This dish is fabulous!  I followed the suggestions of others and halved the peppers.  It was perfect for me, although I'm sure my hubster could have handled it a bit spicier.  I even cheated and used dried herbs (halving also) and it still turned out great.  I'll be making this one again!

This is an excellent dish. I agree the heat can be controlled with more or less of the peppers. An other idea if you have a dinner party with non-sea food fans ( I can't believe they exists but they do!)Try it with chicken and seperate before adding the sea food. It takes a little effort but keeps everyone happy.

I have made this about 3 times now, and consider it a favorite that I will be making for a long time!  It is extremely good.  I have played with the pepper amounts, and even substituted some of Emeril's Essence.  I like it either way, even very spicy.  Many people have commented that it's too spicy as written...just taste the sauce, it's personal preference.  I also add more shrimp/scallops than it calls for.  Last recommendations:  use fresh basil, buy good swiss cheese (and add more), buy fresh seafood and pasta when you can.  I would serve this to anyone I wanted to impress, and I would be satisfied if I ordered this from any expensive restaurant!  It is one of the best!

Great recipe!  I made it by the recipe, but added a little more cheese to thicken it up a bit.  Great flavor.  Definitely restaurant quality.  Only thing I reccomend is to finely chop the onions, and herbs if using fresh.

This is simply the best recipe that I have ever used for a pasta sauce.  I have already made this 6 times and my whole family loves it (including picky kids!).  I do recommend using only half of the peppers called for the first time you make this, so as to adjust to your taste, and I have used grilled, cajun-seasoned chicken instead of the seafood with wonderful results.  This is a twice-monthly meal in my home.

I did not find this recipe very hot at all, as a matter of fact my 4 year old son loved it!  But I guess that is to be expected since we live in LA. Cajun country, everything we eat is hot!

The one thing I would change although is the amount of parsley. If you are not a big "green stuff" fan, I would half the amount of Parsley.

It was an excellent recipe, and I cant wait to make it again.

This dish is incredible.  I used each of the peppers called for, however I cut the quantity by 75-80 percent.  In addition, I served it in individual casserole dished over rice and browned the top with additional swiss cheese and breadcrumbs.  It was a BIG hit with my guests - a definate keeper.

It definitely has a kick, and it's so delicious!  Cut back on the red pepper flakes if spicy isn't your thing.  It's great!

Excellent blend of herbs, pepper, & cheese flavor. I used a pound of sm/med shrimp and a boneless chicken breast cute into 1 inch cubes.  It was as good as any creamy pasta dish ordered in any restaurant.  Not too heavy, delicious!  My husband loved it!  I will certainly add this recipe to my collection of favorites!

MINOUCHKA  --   I have made this fantastic dish many time.  Au lieu of using the black, white pepper, and the crushed red pepper, I used about 1 tsp. or more, to taste, of Cajun seasoning.  And if needed I use a bit of black, white pepper, and crushed red pepper, just to taste to your liking.  Also, I made it w/ left over roasted chicken au lieu of seafood.... Either way it turned out Soooooo YUMMY!

The wife loved this recipe.  I cut back on the pepper a little bit, but she thought it could be dialed back even more.  I liked the spice.  Overall, we both thought it was delicious and will add it to the dinner mix.

I made this last night and it came out great! Very flavorful :) however, I did add Cajun seasoning, minced garlic and a splash of milk to the sauce to thin it out a bit.

I loved this recepi, however even though I eat spyce food, this recepi turned out to be too hot for me. So next time I would just go easy with the peppers.

I cut the red pepper and salt in half, and instead of green onion, I added a sauteed yellow onion and sauteed bell pepper. With the alterations to suit our tastes, this is an instant favorite.

As written, this is a 3, and I wouldn't make again.  BUT!  I think I can improve it with a few small changes.  

Overall, it had a good flavor, we really enjoyed that part of it, but the aftertaste was so spicy it left a burn in your mouth for half an hour after.  We had to eat this very slowly to give ourselves a break.  This was after adding more cheese to try to cut the spicyness.

Next time that I make this, I'm going to leave the spices the same, but cut all of the peppers in half.  I really think that will cut back on a lot of the issues, and with the extra cheese I added (sorry, didn't measure, but about doubled what was called for).

This is a good, easy recipe. I think the sauce should be thicker so next time, I'll use corn starch or potato starch as a thicker.

it was *way* too salty.

Everything else seems to be just right, but the next time I make this I'm definitely cutting the salt by half. However, with that modification I anticipate that this will be a solid 5 star recipe - it's really good.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, only adding a touch more seafood because we love it so much. It was superb!!! My husband and I are originally from New Orleans and it was just the right amount of spicy for us. My husband usually passes on cream based sauces, but he couldn't get enough of this dish. We ate it for dinner and then for lunches until it was gone. Good enough to serve to company with a nice tossed salad alongside. Will definitely make again and again and again.

This recipe was easy to follow and the outcome is delicious! I made shrimp and scallops as well as chicken (I don't eat seafood but my husband an child do). I followed the recipe as written. My husband and daughter thought it was a bit too spicy. However, I enjoyed it. Next time, I will reduce the red pepper by half. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I give this a 5 stars based on taste, but 2 stars since I was expecting pasta with some kind of sauce on top. I didn't add red pepper flakes and only used 1 tsp of black pepper. The taste was amazing! The consistency however, was way too thick to be putting on pasta. It was more of a Cajun Seafood Dip that you would eat with chips or crackers. I still give it 5 stars because the flavor was amazing but next time I will try some of the suggestions on here and either add 2 cups of milk, (or 4 cups of fat free half/half), or take out some of the sauce to mix with the noodles before adding the cheese.

I took some liberties with this recipe and was very pleased with the results. I started by sautéing some garlic in olive oil and butter and after adding & simmering the cream I whisked in a bit of flour to help thicken it. I used fewer herbs, probably about a cup in total, and substituted freeze-dried jalapeños for red pepper flakes. It was a delicious meal - I would definitely make this again!

Very good but VERY spicy! I'm a southern girl that likes her shrimp spicy but this is a little much. Cut the red pepper in half. That's what I'm gonna try next time. Good technique for Alfredo though.

Not bad. I added additional cajun seasoning and more cream. We also added chicken and sauted garlic and green peppers.

Best recipe I've tried in years! I made it as a side dish without the seafood. 1/2 the peppers and added extra cup of cream. All I heard at the dinner table was Oh my God!!!

I prefer the Chicken Cajun Pasta recipe on here. You can change to shrimp or anything and it's identical to the restaurant style - so rich and good. This recipe was different but the seasoning herbs made it weird tasting, and i had to add alot more cream to get it to not be too dry and thick.

If you don't like scallops, try substituting sliced Kielbasa sausage (browned in frying pan). Really delicious that way. I made it with Kielbasa & Shrimp for company and one little girl who is a super picky eater asked if she could take home the leftovers because she loved it so much. I'm going to thicken the sauce next time like other reviewers did. I didn't think it was thick enough which is the only reason I deducted a star.

I am a younger cook so perhaps there was some error on my part. The sauce tasted salty and REALLY spicy. Perhaps I'm not as big of a spice person as I thought.. so anyone cooking this for the first time should use only half of what is called for the peppers. I might even recommend not adding salt at all. The shrimps seem to add enough of a salty flavor to the sauce already. Also, the sauce was not thick as I expected. It was very runny.

Modified this quite a bit, and was fantastic.  Used Half/Half instead of cream.  Reduced green onions & parsley to 1/2 cup each.  Reduce all peppers by half.  Added 6oz fresh sliced mushrooms and 1/3 lb spicy Italian sausage.  Saute green onions & mushrooms until tender.  Add 1.5 oz white wine (most liquid should boil off).  Add chopped sausage.  Cook until sausage done.  Remove from heat.  Follow instructions (#2 & #3).  I added the parsley and basil with the seafood so it wouldn't cook as much.  Once seafood is done, mix in sausage/onions/mushrooms/cheeses & serve.  Actually made this over a camp stove - the other guys couldn't believe it.  I chose bowtie pasta - slightly easier to manage for camping.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  My entire family LOVED it.  Not the healthiest meal but definitely a great one for a special occasion. It tastied just like a restaurant made favorite.   This meal just proves how expensive it is to eat out. This meal at a restaurant would cost about $19 and you can feed 2 adults and 2 kids with this meal for less than $30.

Very good base recipe. I altered it a bit. We didn't want it spicy because of our kiddos, so I only added a little bit of the peppers. I also added two crushed garlic cloves and all freshly chopped herbs. The sauce did come out a bit too soupy but the flavor was amazing.

I made this for dinner for my boyfriend and I, and we both loved it!

I decided to grill some onions and bell peppers and add them to the mixture and it was AWESOME.  We will definitely be making this again sometime.

Really good.  HOWEVER - I cut the white, black and crushed red pepper in half and I still thought it was spicy.  I would also reduce the amount of salt by about half, I added extra cheese to try to offset the saltiness of the dish.  I also doubled the amount of shrimp and scallops.  Overall, a delicious dish that I will definately make again!

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family!!! I reduced the red pepper to one teaspoon but it was still a bit on the spicy side.  If you are not one for spicy food, I would recommend reducing it further than I did. Next time I make it I will cut it down even more so my son can enjoy it next time (I had to rinse the noodles bc it was too spicy for him). Super easy to make and is DEFINITELY going into my recipe box.

FANTASTIC recipe! This had a great kick to it. We like spicy food and we may have to cut back a tiny bit on the pepper next time. Overall though, a great dish. Lots of flavor when given time to simmer!

I have been making this dish for a couple of years, but tonight I made it for about 12 friends and it was a HUGE hit.  I haven't changed the recipe at all, nor is there any reason to.  My husband likes it a little more spicy so, I leave some extra red pepper on the side for him.  This is an unbelievable recipe! Thank you!

I just measured by the eye. Didn't use scallops, ground white pepper, or thyme and it turned out delicious. I also used a slice of provolone cheese since i didn't have the swiss chess.

I am not myself a shell fish lover, but I had a dinner date and wanted to add some surf to the turf. I chose this recipe. I had to make some changes as I forgot to by the whipping cream and scallions. I substituted the whipping cream with 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of milk, used sweet red onion instead of scallions, and some chopped fresh jalapeno instead of pepper flakes and served it with Angel Hair Pasta instead of Fettuccine. He LOVED it. Kudos to the originator of the recipe!

For a creamier version:  1) 1 can of evaporated milk instead of cream 2)Cream cheese instead of shreded cheese! It turned out quite creamy and yummy! Everyone in my family loved it!

Holy Moly! Spicy but sooooo goood. I made this 3 times in about 2 weeks.  Our dinner guests acutally stole the leftovers, then called us from their car on the ride home to laugh and rub it in.  I tried half the amount of spices, but it wasnt quite enough so I 3/4'd them and that was perfect! And it feeds a lot of people! I made mine with only shrimp and skipped the scallops.  Cant wait to make it again!

This recipe was delicious! However, I had trouble getting mine to really thicken while simmering. Simmering it an extra 10 minutes didn't seem to help much, either, so I added some extra cheese- provolone, as that is what we had. I also didn't have any white pepper, but didn't care to substitute any black pepper in and it still tasted good. I tossed the pasta with the sauce, and it ended up tasting wonderful at the end. Great recipe!

Absolutely Great!!! I made this meal last night for me and my bf.  My bf LOVED this recipe.  This will definitely be added to the recipe book.  I made a couple of changes (added broccoli, garlic, onion, lemon, and mushrooms).  Can't wait for the leftovers....

This dish was extremely easy to make. Followed the recipe and it was very tasty, my family really loved it. It was a little to spicy, next time I will cut down on the pepper. Over all this dish is a keeper!

This was awesome! The only thing I would have to mention is if you don't like spicey food then you should reduce the amount of red pepper flakes...it was very spicey. My husband didn't want to try this, but once he did, he loved it!

I really enjoyed this as did my kids.  The only change that I made was using a blend of mozzarella/parmesan cheese.  I think this sauce would be great on any type of meat and would like to try it on fish.  Thanks for the keeper!

This was really good. I used sea scallops chopped. I also made my own cream using milk and butter but I feel that the sauce was a bit thin because of this. I don't believe that it detracted from the over all taste and flavor however. Very good.

Really enjoyed this. I think the fresh basil and thyme give the dish a great flavor. Only change made was to sub fontina cheese for swiss and add chopped tomato and mushrooms. Absolutely love seafood and pasta. Put the two together with cream and cheese....outstanding.

Wow!! This was great.  Very spicy so if you're not that into hot decrease the amount of herbs you use.  I also didn't use scallions and it was just fine.  This would also be great with chicken.

This is one of the best recipes I have gotten off of this site.. Although I cut down the spices and herbs to almot half. Everytime I have made this though I have gotten rave reviews.

I hate to give this recipe 5 stars when you see how much I modified it, but since it was awesome with the modifications, I KNOW it would be even more awesome as written.  I tried to cut the recipe in half, so I used 2 small cans of evaporated milk instead of cream to save on fat/calories (imagine with cream, mmmmm).  Also, I tried to just half the pepper measurements, but it was SOOOO hot, so I had to add A LOT of milk with corn starch to cut the heat.  I also used all dry spices, I'm sure fresh would taste great, I will have to try this in the summer when my herbs are growing.  That is the nice thing about this recipe, you can really modify it for your taste preferences very easily and turn out an awesome meal!

If I could give more stars I definitely would. This pasta was delicious. It taste just like my favorite pasta at my favorite restaurant. I did add 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning and 2 tsp of minced garlic. I would add less crushed peppers which I only used 1 tsp and it was a bit to spicy for my boyfriend but it was just fine to me. I would definitely will prepare this meal again. It's a winner with me and my picky eater boyfriend whom also loved this pasta!

Delicious!  Wish my cheese didn't stick to the bottom of the pot, but I guess it was worth the effort in cleaning.  This is a wonderful pasta, and the spices are just the right amount not to be overbearing to take over the taste of the sauce.  I can't wait to make this again.  I also always add white wine to any cream sauce I make, just gives it that much more flavor.  Thanks for this recipe!

Easy to make and a hit for dinner guests.  I knocked back the pepper and red pepper to 50% of the recipe amounts, and this dish was still very rich and flavorful.  I don't think I would like it nearly enough with the full quantities!

This was amazing! My Husband and I loved it. This will definitely be on a list of things to make once a week or so. I made a few changed tho i did not add the thyme or the basil i did not add the red pepper flakes because my husband hates spicy food. I simply chopped a regular medium size onion sauted it a little in olive oil added the sea food mix and the heavy cream cooked till ready and added the boiled pasta mixed all together on high heat added salt and pepper about a cup of lemon juice and served it!!! it was PERFECT AND LITE so easy to make but tastes like it was hard to make.

Oh my - this was fantastic.  I left out the white pepper and only added 1 tsp of black pepper after reading other reviews.  I only used 8oz dry pasta instead of a pound because I like lots of sauce.   When everything was done cooking I combined ALL the noodles with ALL the sauce in one big bowl.   After about 5 mins the sauce got nice and thick and really stuck to the noodles well.   The flavor was rich nand delicious.  My mouth was H-A-P-P-Y!!  Thanks for the great recipe.   Will make again with shrimp and chicken (my hubby won't eat scallops so I get this batch all to myself.)  Yum-OH!

My family of seven loved this dish.  I sauted the scallops in garlic butter as recommended (set aside).  Then sauted 1/2c. fresh parsley, onions and fresh mushrooms in the same pan and added to the cream sauce. Adjusted salt 1/2t., black pepper 1/4t., crushed red pepper 1/2t.  This provided a nice hint of spice.  I used cornstarch to thicken and added 1/4c. crumbled bacon.  Yum!  Added scallops to heat just before serving.  I did not add the noodles to the sauce, but served individually.  This way leftovers will be more fresh and the sauce will not be absorbed into the pasta. Will definitely make again and try with chicken.

I just made this dish and loved it! So did my husband.  I didn't change any ingredients. I did however let the sauce simmer a bit longer before adding the shrimp. I love it just the way it is!

Awesome! I did only one teaspoon of crushed red pepper and I like stuff spicy but I dont like to sweat while I eat. That turned out to be the perfect amount. I also only did a half cup of parsley becuase I'm not a huge fan of it. It was only two of us eatting it but I made the full recipie. I guess we use a lot of sauce becuase there was only enough left for us to freeze some for a side dish for two in the future. AWESOME DISH!

I made this just the other day and it was wonderful.  I did cut back on the pepper due to the fact I have younger children-- I used the red pepper but omitted the white and black pepper.  I didn't have fresh basil or thyme so I used dried and the dish was still execellent....even the kids loved it!!!  I also used more than 1/2 pound of the seafood---cuz they are faves in our house!  I also added the juice of 1 lemon and kids and hubby are already asking that I make again

Excellent recipe!  I took many of the suggestions from others, added a little more cream, and sauteed the seafood with garlic and cajun seasoning, and added it at the last minute before serving.  Also used mozz instead of swiss cheese.  Will definitely make this again, only next time i think i'll add some peppers and broccoli.

This recipe was delicious! The family compared it to Olive Garden's Seafood Alfredo. I used a bit more scallops than asked for and omitted the white pepper completely. Other than that I used the recipe as is and I was complimented about it all day!  I will definitely make this one again : )

My HB and I loved this dish!  It had a nice kick to it which we really enjoyed.  I made a few changes because it was what I had on hand.  I used dried basil, thyme and parsley.  Used I white onion, decreased the salt and pepper to 1 t., used 1/4 crushed red pepper and 1/4 t. ground white pepper.  I added some garlic powder and a can of mushrooms.  Will definitely be making again, but I will try fresh spices next time.  Great recipe.....

This dish was great, and so easy to make. I'm sure the dish would good just as it was posted but, like everyone else, I had to add a few things. I got the idea of adding mushrooms and green bell peppers from a review and sauteed them with the chopped green onion before adding them to the sauce. I also added salmon (grilled first) and used cave aged gruyere cheese instead of swiss. It took about 35 min to make.

Came across this recipe when searching for something to do with the scallops and shrimp in my freezer. This recipe hit the spot! A few modifications (out of necessity for what I had on hand): Monterey Jack instead of Swiss, all dried herbs instead of fresh, used minimal pepper to satisfy the kids, and I added a bit of garlic while sauteing the seafood before adding it to the sauce when the sauce was ready. Next time I will try to have fresh parsley on hand and will definitely try with Swiss, though the Jack cheese was great. This was very rich, so perhaps half and half would be just as good, but not so rich. Thanks for the inspiration!

This is one of my household's favorite dishes. I would recommend, however, to add a little less pepper than the recipe calls for. I usually skip the white pepper altogether and only put about a tsp of crushed red pepper in. It is still a very spicy and flavorful dish.

This recipe is WAY too peppery.  If you plan on making this, I'd say cut the black & white peppers at least in half--or just do to taste.  The amount of pepper made this recipe barely edible:(  I had high hopes for it...and will make it again, just not with all the pepper!

This recipe was very good. I didn't have heavy cream so I used Campbell's condensed soup instead and mixed it with some water. It turned out very good. Will definitely do again.

I made this for my husband last year for Valentines day and it was delicious!  Though I may add that it is super spicy, and I love spicy food.  You may want to cut back on the amount of red crushed pepers if you dont like it that spicy.  But, so good that I will be making it again soon for the in-laws.

Had I not taken other users suggestions, I would have rated this 2 stars simply because it was far too spicy (and we LOVE spicy food!)and would have been inedible!

I halved all three peppers, added 3 gloves of garlic and thinned the sauce before adding the shrimp and scallops with a few tablespoons of pasta water (don't bother with the milk and cornstarch suggestions, it's an unnecessary step and will cause clumping.)

I bought a bunch of fresh parsley, which didn't come to a full cup (/3/4 cup) and it was just fine. 

Lastly, I always have a hard time figuring out which part of the green onion to use because I was told the top part is for garnishing, the bottom for cooking. I bought a bunch of onions (4 or 5 to bunch) and chopped them all (tops and bottoms), which was the perfect amount.

Next time, I will add some tomatoes or mushrooms for more variety. I might reduce the amt of parsley to 1/2 cup as well because it was too much.

Wonderful recipe, thanks for sharing!

The recipe was good.  Be careful about how much cracked red pepper you use though, doesn't seem like it's enough when you sprinkle some in but wow it really kicks this recipe up!

I have made this recipe quite a few times and do something different every time.  It is just as delicious as leftovers and the first day you make it.

We made this last night.  It was glorious.  I did tone down the crushed red pepper because we are weaklings in the heat category.  We also changed up the seafood, by adding clams, more shrimp, and more scallops.   This is definitely a keeper.

LOVED IT!  My husband found this in my collection and I had never even made it before.  He fixed it for a little dinner party and it was a total hit...a little spicy...but wonderful. 

We'll be making this again for sure.

I'm still a pretty novice cook, so I was happy at how easy this recipe was to make. I found it a little hot, but then after adding some more cream, it was fine.  Very tasty; I'll be making it again!

YUM!!!  I loved the combination of the three peppers in the sauce.  We do not care for scallops, so I subbed in extra shrimp, which was delicious.

This recipe tasted great but I made tons of changes.  The main change was cutting the black pepper and crushed red pepper in half and omitting the white pepper.  I also added some fat free milk to increase the amount of sauce and added more seafood.  Next time I will get the sauce almost finished before I start to boil the pasta.

Quite spicy and delicious, but I would suggest only 1/2 the salt and maybe some garlic.

Major disappointment! I love Cajun food, especially seafood--so I eagerly tried this recipe --sadly, there is no balance or subtlety to the sauce -you taste pepper & a mild bland cheese flavor and that's it. No garlic,no paprika, no wine , no depth of flavor and the sauce is the consistency of spackle. I'm sorry I wasted a pound of shrimp! 

PS yes I did follow recommendations of reviewers EXCEPT I didn't reduce the amount of pepper b/c I love hot, spicy dishes but even for me this was too much. I tossed the recipe in the trash w/ most of the pasta. There are MUCH better sauces recipes on this and other sites. This is the first time I've ever been disappointed w/ a recipe on this site!

I LOVED THIS!! our favorite restraunt , outback steakhouse, has a pasta dish that we ALWAYS get everytime we go there, that they call TOWOOMBA. this was the closest to that dish. i did add mushrooms like they do, the only thing really missing was the crawfish, but you almost dont even miss it. very very good. i actually made this two weeks in a row.

This turned really good! Definitely not something you can make regularly due to the fat content.. I used sea salt and it was a little too salty for my taste but after the seafood and cheeses entered, it was not as salty. The only recommendation I would make is to only use 1 teaspoon of salt if you are using sea salt.

This is one of my FAVORITE recipes!!!  I love spicy food, but I too had to reduce the red pepper.  There is quite a bit of work to this recipe, but well worth it. My advice is to use all fresh herbs. This recipe is restuarant quality.

What a gorgeous sauce.  I added white wine and just a sliver of butter because I can't resist temptation, but otherwise followed the recipe.  This one will be on permanent rotation.  Creamy without being cloying.  Thank you!

Excellent dish.  My husand and I loved it.  I would make this even without the seafood.  It's very good.  I did use fresh herbs like the recipe says but I probably won't in the future.  I'll stick with dried and cut the amounts.

Very good and spicy as promised. I made an express version of this with precooked frozen shrimp and dried basil, thyme and parsley from the spice rack. I also added fresh garlic. It was so easy to whip up and very yummy too! I will make this again.

This was a very good dish, and was a hit with the company we had. Based on reviews I read, and not wanting too dry 
a dish, I added 1 cup of whole milk with a little corn starch. For my own twist, I added 1/4 cup of Sauvignon Blanc minutes before serving. Using the full compliment of white and black peppers, I eased off of the red pepper by 1/2 and found that the dish was still very well balanced and with enough zing to make it very interesting. I found that this dish comes together quickly and is easy to prepare.

With only a simple adjustment on the pepper spices, I deliberately made this a little milder for personal taste.  But other than that, I didn't change a thing and this came out wonderful!  Super simple, quick and fun to make, everyone raved about it!  Anyone who says this isn't good the next day is so wrong!  The flavors meld beautifully so be sure to make plenty; you 'll be sad when it's all gone, I promise!

I followed the recipe exact and it was absolutely fabulous.  The fact that it was spicy lived up to the name "Cajun" pasta for sure..  Thank you for a great recipe.

Like everyone else, I put in way less red peppers but my husband loved the recipe and even took leftovers to work where his co-workers were begging him for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

This was good, but not great and definitely not worth all the calories.  I probably wouldn't make this again any time soon, but I would suggest cutting down on the parsley and adding a little extra basil and substituting some extra parmesan for some of the swiss.

Not impressed like the others. I thought the cheese was overpowering, and we could barely taste the seafood.

absolutly delicious!!! in our house, were spice addicts so we put two small habanero peppers in to spice it up even more. we ditched the swiss and put in all parmesan, adding almost a half a cup more to get the correct consistancy (if you add more cheese, use a little less salt, the cheese will make it saltier) and added less black pepper. served with a white wine and garlic bread. definitly will make this again!!

Delicious! Huby loved as well and he's not a huge fan of spicy food. I did  follow some of the reviews and left out the red pepper flakes and halved the black pepper. I think next time I will also halve the white pepper and maybe put a pinch of flakes because the white pepper overwhelmed it a bit. I also ended up doubling the cream because I'm a novice cook and wasn't paying close enough atention and the sauce srarted bubbling and reduced quite a bit! wa I'm glad I did or I wouldn't have had enough sauce. I used 2 tsp. of italian seasoning because I was out of basil.....in hind site I should of decreased the salt The seasoning has salt in it so it was a little on the salty side I added a litle milk to compensate.
I also used 1# shrimp no scallops and added mushrooms and minced garlic from jar. Served over spinach fetticine, can't wait to try again!

Hubby told me to put this on the top of the repetitive foods list. It was awesome. I used shrimp, scallops, crab. And I reduced the swiss cheese, because I don't like swiss cheese, and made it up with parmesan. Awesome.

Did not change a thing.  It was not cheap to make, but it was excellent.  I gave the leftovers to my neighbor to eat later and his wife found it and ate it first.  He is now begging me to make it again.  Great dish for a dinner party with french bread and a salad.

My family really enjoyed this, even my daughter who doesn't care for spicy foods.  I did follow the suggestions of others and cut the red pepper to 1 tsp. and the salt to 1-1/2 tsp.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  The only other change I made was I used chopped fresh chives (2/3 cup) instead of green onions because I couldn't find any that looked good at the store.  It was terrific and if I didn't have the kiddos to think about I'd make it full force with the spices to heat it up a little.

Very good! Not very hard to make. I cut back on the salt and parsley, and used crabmeat in place of scallops. I tried pouring the sauce over the pasta, but next time I will just mix them together. Definitely making it again. many times.

OH MY GOODNESS - this recipe was phenomenal!!!  We love spicy and it was plenty spicy.  I'm not a fan of scallops so I just used more shrimp and it was perfect.  Not exactly healthy, but a wonderful treat.

This was SOO good! Quickly made, and tasted like a restaurant meal. The spicyness really depends on the person I guess. I thought it was totally fine while my husband couldn't even finish his plate because it was too hot. Also, I added some garlic which was really good! Overall A+, but definitely use less pepper if you don't like hot food

We thought that this was pretty good.  We like spicy food and this was not very "Cajun".  We will probably make it again and spice it up a bit more.  I would also use less salt in the sauce and salt after if it needed it.

My husband loved this meal, I used 1 lb. of shrimp, since he does not like scallops.  This is a little to spicy for me, but I cut the pepper in half the second time I made the meal, and it still had a great spicy taste.

Very Good, we cut down on the pepper using just 1/2 tsp reg. pepper, 1/2 tsp. white pepper and hot sauce added to taste at the table. Also used 1 tsp. garlic salt and 1 tsp. reg. salt instead of 2 tsp. reg. salt. Very good and great flavor - everyone loved it!

This was a spectacular recipe! The cream sauce is perfect: like others have said, it's a much lighter-tasting alternative to alfredo. I thought the combination of plenty of fresh herbs and the spice was great: you get the fresh taste of the greens first, then the spice comes and grabs you. Like others have said, it is spicy, adjust accordingly. I didn't use the scallops, just a pound of shrimp, but I did add about one sauted and spiced chicken breast. Personally I thought the pasta didn't benefit from the breast, but it's all a matter of preference. I adored this recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

OUTSTANDING...is the word.  We love any type of food and the recipe as is had just enough heat that even the kids were able to eat it, with lots of milk...LOL...but they agreed it was a keeper and asked when are we having it again.  I did take in suggestions to add Red, Yellow & Green Peppers for color.  Additionally I cooked them in a little butter with 2 teaspoons of Minced Garlic (we love garlic, so use your preference).  By using Butter it blended very well with the cream.   I made the recipe later in the week with Chicken and used dry herbs as I didn't have any fresh herbs left.  Use FRESH Herbs if at all possible....BIG Difference in flavors that come through in the sauce then using dry.  Dry was good, but Fresh....Very very good.  Thanks for the great recipe....its a regular on our table from now on.

Also reading some reviews - this recipe  has HEAT to it...meaning that when you take a bite your mouth and body will rise in temp/heat up eating this. Not Hot like eating a jalepeno. If you don't like it that way, cut down the Crushed Red Pepper to 1/8 teaspoon or leave it out. Also if you are not a black pepper fan, cut back on that too.

This is the first recipe that we totally disagree with the rating.  We love spicy seafood, but this was not a good combo.  It was too spicy.

This is just awesome!!! Easy and delicious! Sauce is not heavy at all so it is not heavy like alfredo sauce. You can sure impress your guests with this dish.  Forget about going out to eat.  This is a keeper!!!  Thanks.

Tasted great!!  Will make again and again. Very easy, impressive dish for a dinner party.  I halved all of the pepper for our taste.  I didn't have fresh basil or thyme so I used dried and it tasted fine.  I heated the left over sauce in the microwave and served over skinless baked chicken breasts the next evening.  Great!!

I made this the other night for dinner and was expecting something awesome and was pleasantly surprised!!  I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried and I didn't have white pepper and I'm glad!!!  It was SPICY.  I loved it and so did my husband although we both drank two glasses of iced tea with dinner.  Next time I'll cut all three pepper's by 2/3rds.  Creamy and delicious.  A definite keeper.

I think I somehow screwed up this recipe.  Cheese seemed to clump up and heavy cream never seemed to thicken up.  I will most likely try this recipe again.  Even with the screw up it still had a nice taste to it.

This dish was excellent. You should be in the mood for something creamy and spicy if you're planning to try it. Don't be afraid to stray from the amounts, use your judgement... I used Adobo instead of salt, and used ground thyme. I also cooked everything (before adding the seafood)for much longer than 8 minutes. It took around 20, actually. (The meal took a half an hour in total.) I also used a full pound of shrimp, and about 3 tablespoons of fresh basil. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe twice and both times my guests have loved it!  I've decided this will be what I'll make when supper has to be a success.  I only use about half the amount of crushed red pepper flakes though, so it's not too spicy.  Delicious and easy- the perfect recipe!

This was very good.  We didn't have fresh herbs but used dried with good results.  We also used 1 lb shrimp and no scallops.  We didn't think this was spicy at all in fact my 14 month old ate it and liked it very well!

This is definitely a dish to impress!  So as not to feel guilty, I used fat free half and half (thickened with cornstarch), along with reduced fat Swiss and Parmesan cheeses.  I also used dry herbs, and added in some garlic, red and green peppers sauteed in EVOO (extra virgin olive oil)!  I wish I could give this 10 stars!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site!  I used it with my Cooking Club group, and they keep asking to repeat it!  I use all shrimp, cut the red pepper flakes and green onion in half, and decrease the cream to make a thicker sauce.  It is definitely restaurant quality!

Our family loves spicy food, but, I thought that the hotness overpowered the flavor.  If I made again, I would definatly cut down on the peppers.

Wonderful!  Read a lot of reviews and ended up changing a couple of things.  Left out the white pepper, used 1 tsp. of black pepper, 1 tsp. of salt, and 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  Kept all other ingredients as stated.  My whole family loved and it was still spicy but everyone could eat it.  Wonderful dish!  I did overcook the noodles a bit but this meal was so good that nobody cared.  (see photo) Served with a pull apart herb bread and it was great for sopping up the sauce.  Thank you Star!!

I love this recipe! The first time I made this I made the mistake of making it for my father.  The only reason it was a mistake is because now it's all he talks about.  He could eat it 7 days a week! I also add cajun seasoning to give it a little extra punch, we like our food spicy.  It's very creamy and delicious.  I will make this many more times!

This recipe is fantastic!  I used fresh seafood while I was at the beach and it was so good.  The cream with the fresh herbs and the spice of the hot pepper was great.

My husband loves, loves spicy foods and will eat raw chilies with his meals to kick up the heat. I on  the other hand, can't really tolerate the heat chilies give off. I wanted to try this recipe because it called for quite a bit of white and black peppers and I love scallops. This dish was amazing! All the fresh herbs and ground peppers give such great taste! I did however added a little bit of green and red bell peppers and some fresh sliced mushrooms. I also added some minced garlic and cornstarch to thicken the sauce up a bit more. My husband (who has eaten scotch bonnet peppers) actually said this dish had some kick to it and he didn't even add additional hot sauce to it! I didn't think it was that spicy -not the way chilies add heat but the white and black peppers did give it a nice kick without numbing your mouth like fresh chilies do. A great recipe! Oh, and it's really good over white rice as well!!

This recipe is very good!  I made it for my husband and mother-in-law and they both loved it.  I only put 1 tsp. of crushed red peper flakes in it and it was plenty spicy, just perfect.  I didn't use quite the entire amount of pasta because I felt as if it would have been too dry (not enough sauce) if I added the entire 1 pound.  I think the recipe feeds about 4, not 6, but maybe we are just big eaters!  I'll definitely make it again.

The flavor was OK but not exceptional. The parsley was too overpowering.
I reduced the amount of spices but didn't cut them in half and it wasn't too spicy for us.

I only added a dash of the black and red pepper, and left out the white pepper altogether.  I also added several cloves of crushed garlic.  My boyfriend said this was "the best thing that ever came out of that kitchen". Not sure how to take that, but it speaks well for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome!  My husband and I are very sensative to salt, so I either cut it in half or completely omit it. Being in the military, we have quite a few friends from the South.  They all tell me this dish reminds them of home!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!  I tripled the recipe plus added a bit more cheese than called for to make it a little thicker (I also used shredded mozarella).  Once I tripled it, it served 7 with a little bit left.  Heat was just right for everyone but my husband who sweats when he eats catsup.  THIS IS THE BEST!  I used garlic and herb fettucine instead of just the plain kind and it really complimented the sauce!!

WOW!!! Me and my fiancee really liked this recipe.  He said it tasted better than what a restaurant would serve.  I did follow what others did and reduced the spices.  It turned out great!  I'll definately make this again. Thanks.

we loved this recipe--thank you!!
So, I have been making this for almost 7 years now!!  I make it 3-4 times/year & I make enough that we eat it for several days.  I have made it every which way adding this or subbing that until we found the way we like best.  We like it thick like alfredo, so I start out making a roux with 1/2 c unsalted butter & 1/2 c flour.  After the roux is done I stir in 1 qt 1/2 & 1/2.  I saute my green onions (the whole onion + the green part) in a smidgen of butter in a separate pan & add it to the pot.  Add all the herbs & spices-I use all dry.  I also add about 1 1/2 T of garlic powder & about 3 T of Cajun seasoning.  I heat until it starts to boil & it will be thick.  Place on back burner on warm while starting the fettuccine.  Noodles take about 12 min, so when they have been in for 6 I turn up the heat on my sauce to med & I add my cheeses (little @ a time) &  2 lbs of med shrimp & 1- 12oz pkg of Imitation crab sticks cut into big chunks.  Let the seafood heat up & it is done.  I also LOVE fresh sauteed mushrooms with this, but have to add them separately because kids won't eat them.  Thank you so much for a recipe that we have enjoyed for years & will continue to do so!

Fantastic recipe - I've known it as "Seafood Diablo." I too, cut the peppers by about half, but instead added a tablespoon or more of a red hot sauce, like Cholula (the wooden top).  It adds a nice red color and gives it that tangy kick.  I also like a little more sauce, so I add either an extra half cup of whipping cream, or I decrease the pasta by a quarter.  This is great to serve in a crock pot for pot luck dinners or holiday parties.  Will definitely make over and over.

I can't say enough about this recipe.  I fixed it for a dinner party and everyone raved.  It is so easy and can make anyone look like a gourmet cook.  Delicious!

Oh my God this was delicious. You must try this. I did make a few changes. I used lite half & half, used cayenne pepper instead of the flakes(didn't measure) and I added a little cajun spice. Wonderful recipe but be careful is hot flavor. Just the way I like it.

I halved the peppers, but this recipe was TOO HOT!  It was very good otherwise, I loved the fresh herbs, it tasted very fresh!  My husband wants me to try it again with less heat, so I will be making it again, with a few more tweaks.

This was quite yummy, but anything with 2 cups of cream better taste good!  I reduced the red pepper flakes to just 1/2 tsp. and, even though we love spicy food, it was definitely enough.  We also did not add the white pepper, just the black pepper.  It was plenty of pepper!  The sauce tasted really salty before we added the seafood and pasta, but was just right after everyhting was combined.  We will definitely make this again.

This dish is amazing.  I have been looking for a easy creamy cajun pasta (that everyone loves) for years.  I also (like most people are saying) cut the pepper in half (at least).  Next time I make it, I might add another 1/4 cup of cream...because the sauce is extremely delicious (my husband was even sopping up the remaining sauce on his plate with his bread..YUM!)!!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

This was a very good recipie.  I cut the red pepper in half - I liked it but it was still a little hot for others who don't like hot things.  They did say it wasn't overly hot to where they couldn't taste the flavors.  Overall, we would all make this recipe again!!  Very Good!

this is so good!  for guests i use the heavy cream, but for family and me (to cut on fat) i use fat free 1/2 and 12 with corn starch.  i used all shrimp because i don't like scallops.  fresh basil is a MUST.  makes the recips so much better.  i did not add all the pepper because it would be too much.

This is definitely a keeper. It's restaurant quality and my husband and I absolutely loved it. I made half the recipe for the 2 of us and had extra left over. I used a bit less of the crushed red pepper than called for and no white pepper (didn't have any) and it was just the right level of "hotness" for me - mild tingly sensation on the tongue, not burning hot. I cooked small raw scallops in the sauce for a few minutes and then added pre-cooked shrimp at the last moment. I also used old cheddar cheese instead of swiss. It turned out great!

This was a GREAT recipe! My boyfriend loved it, but from now on, I will have to double the recipe in order to satisfy his tastebuds!!!.  In order to cut out fat, I used fat free half and half and thickened the sauce with a flour/water mixture.  I also added mushrooms sauteed in butter to the sauce.  Note to all: This recipe is very spicy.  I love spicy food, but I would recommend cutting back a little on the black pepper in order to save your tastebuds.  Overall, this recipe was wonderful.  My boyfriend keeps asking when I am going to make it again!!!!

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I reduced the black and white peppers by just a little bit, and I sauteed mushrooms in butter and added to the cream sauce.  I used frozen chinese scallops from Trader Joe's and frozen uncooked shrimp from Costco.  Worked perfectly!  My husband said it was like a dish from a gourmet restaurant.  Even my 12 and 3 year old boys loved it!

Yummy but oh so spicy.  Based on some reviews I figured it wouldn't be THAT hot since I like spice. So, I didn't adjust the spice levels and it was a bit too warm for my company.  Next time I would take out a bit but it was still yummy.

This is the best recipe for seafood pasta so far! Also added crab to it. Since my kids love spicy food, it was a hit all around! This dish will become a once a month treat.

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!  Yes, it is a hot one (and that was even without the white pepper)...I didn't have the Swiss Cheese, so I added a little extra parmesan...what a wonderful creation.  Thank you for sharing it with us.  Bon Appetit.

I made this for my boyfriend (a non seafood lover)he loved it.  I even added mussels to the mix.  This has to be the best seafood pasta dish I have tasted.  Better than the restaurant dishes, because you can add as little or as much as you like.  Great dish!!!

I substituted sauteed chicken breast for the seafood and thought it was really tasty! Both my husband and I thought the spices were perfect, but we kept a big glass of water close at hand.

I made the following changes because it is what I had on hand: used dry herbs instead of fresh; added 2 tbps of pasta water to marry the sauce; used angel hair pasta instead of linguini. I did not add white pepper (didn’t have any) so I doubled the black pepper. I also doubled the shrimp because I didn’t have any scallops. I would make this recipe again. It was very good and took less than a half hour to make!

This is now a go to recipe. Made it with some of the changes others had. Added green pepper and mushrooms. Other than that, I followed the recipe. IT WAS WONDERFUL!

Easy to make and sooo yummy.

This recipe is a spicy Seafood Alfredo with Swiss cheese (the Swiss cheese  seemed out of place).
I agree with another reviewer, if you omitted most of the pepper, it would have a more balanced flavor (and eliminate the bitterness) and you could actually taste the seafood.  I adjusted the recipe by using 1/2 & 1/2, used corn starch to thicken, omitting the white pepper, using only  1/2 teaspoon of black ground pepper and just a touch of red pepper flakes, omitted the swiss cheese and added a splash of vermouth. If I have seafood in a dish, I like to taste the flavors. The changes I made allowed the seafood to shine.

Followed the recipe only adding a little extra cheese to the sauce in order to thicken in up a bit. I also added some calamari just for some extra seafood! It was amazing!!

LOVE! The only changes I made were less parsley, more seafood, more cream and linguine instead of fettuccine. I’ve made it several times because it’s my husband’s absolute favorite!

Second time deliciousness. I made a couple of changes :Used Tony Chachere Creole Seasoning. Use 2-3 tablespoons to taste. I started with 2 replaced all spice except fresh basil :Sautéed the shrimp and scallops in 3 tablespoons unsalted butter with 2 tablespoons minced garlic :added scallops and shrimp and pan butter/garlic after 7 minutes of sauce cooking :only had an Italian blend cheese and parmigiana so I used 1/2 cup each I put the fettuccine in with the sauce and let it soak up the goodness for 3 minutes and served

Hubby hates any sort of “cream” or “alfredo-y” pasta sauce. He gobbled this up & gave rave reviews! Whole family, including extended, looved it. If you love cream/white sauces but wish it wasn’t heavy (& know that a “white wine” sauce is NEVER the same) this is for you! A+

Ok so when I first started cooking on my own I looked up recipes for what my family might like and I stumbled upon this recipe. It was a huge hit, so much they kept asking for it. Either way, I changed a few things from the original so I don't use the recommended amount for the spices I tend to just guess on it. The other changes made is that I use swiss and mozzarella instead of parmesan, I also switched the scallops with chicken I pan fry the chicken with garlic salt and seasoned salt and add lime before mixing it in with the sauce at the end. Either way, it has become my best dish that keeps evolving and one that my family keeps asking for.

This sauce definitely has kick which I enjoyed but found the salt was too much. I’d cut the salt next time and probably try a lighter cream and reduce it until it’s thicker and creamier. This is a Cajun sauce not an Alfredo sauce.

So delicious!  I omitted the white pepper (because I didn't have any) and was glad I did - it has plenty of kick without that.  I also cooked mine in a cast iron skillet and finished it off for 5 minutes under the broiler.

My girlfriend had made a comment, saying that she wanted something with Shrimp and because I aim to please, I made this recipe for her.

It was very easy to complete and so delicious (for us both) that she wants it again and again!

Fantastic recipe. I've made it several times and it never dissapoints. My family likes spicy food so I upped the amount of pepper. This last time I added crab and crawfish tails. Whatever the tails were packed in thinned out the sauce to much. Threw some more cheese into it and it thickened back up.

I added smoked sausage & scallops. I did not let the sauce get thick I wanted it creamy so soon as I poured the heavy cream in started to add my meats and seasonings. I added more seasoning for taste . Once the meat was done I poured it all over my pasta ! Will feed about 5 good portions. I will make again!

Great recipe! I made a few changes: 1. added minced garlic, green pepper & butter for sautéing before adding to cream mixture 2. omitted white pepper (after first time making it) 3. increased seafood 1 lb shrimp 3/4 lb scallops works best! 4. reserve 1/4 sauce to toss with pasta 5. hold off on making pasta as angel hair takes only minutes to make

I made it, and it turned out really good! Actually it tasted better the next day. I followed the recipe, the only thing I did was pan seared the shrimp and scallops in butter, minced garlic, and some of the herbs listed. I probably will not use the whole package of noodles so it will be saucier.

I'm not sure what makes this "Cajun".  It doesn't have the "trinity", bell pepper, celery and onion.  It doesn't have Cajun-style seafood seasoning, etc.  Years ago, a co-worker used to make a "Cajun seafood pasta" dish that was amazing.  I never got the recipe from her and have been trying to find something similar since.  This isn't it.

So easy to make and tastes AMAZING! Usually, I find that recipes with a homemade sauce are never enough for me and don’t usually get thick like an Alfredo but this is plenty. I used only about 1/2 cup of parsley and added in 1 tblsp of cayenne for a little kick. Definitely our go to when having dinner guests

We're no weaklings when it comes to spice, but I halved the peppers and it was plenty spicy for us. Plus by cutting down the spice, the "flavor" of the pepper shone through, which I really liked. I used a pound of shrimp and no scallops (we're on a budget), and added some button mushroom caps  that I wanted to use up, which sort of took the place of the scallops pretty well. We really liked this meal.

This was so easy and so delicious! My boyfriend said it was the best seafood pasta he's ever had - including from a restaurant. We did add some Thai chiles and and asparagus and mushrooms but other than that, follow the recipe to a great meal.

I made this strictly by the recipe.  A lovely meld of flavor and spices.  The fresh herbs made for a very nice presentation and the spices made for a nice Cajun flavor without being overpowering.  Don't overcook this into a clumpy clabbered mess like some of the photos show.  The sauce should creamy.  Anything else and you overcooked it.  If there is anything negative I could add it would be that you could reduce the salt slightly, but that is just a matter of taste.

Used Milk (didn't have heavy cream) and shrimp only which I grilled and added as the last step.  Also added mushrooms and some kale.  Definitely will make again!

Rated this based on my changes. I only added 1 tsp black pepper, no white pepper, and only 1 tsp. salt. I didn't have fresh thyme so I added 3/4 tsp. dried and 1 tsp. pepper flakes. I think I'd like the full 1 1/2 tsp. of that and I added 1 Tbls. chopped garlic.   I only made 3/4 of  a pound of fettuccine. I cooked the shrimp, scallops and garlic separate and added once the sauce was done so they would be done just right. It was very creamy and we loved it.

Will definitely make again however I initially scaled down the Peppers but I found it still too hot for my liking so next time I will further scale down the Peppers.  Also only used 1 Tsp of Salt as I thought the full quantity was too much.  Other than that it was delicious and no leftovers!  Already bought the Cream and Seafood to make again!

I've been craving this since I moved away from Louisiana. If you're from the south keep everything the same, but add a tsp of onion powder, a tsp of garlic powder, and all the Tony's you can handle.

Loved this! It was a HUGE hit!!! Due to some substitution comments, I made the following substitutions: I put in 50% more scallops, added 3 cloves of minced garlic, mushrooms, and green peppers that I sautéed separately and added after the sauce boiled. Substituted part of the salt and white pepper for Cajun seasoning. I sautéed the shrimp and scallops with butter separately until they were almost done, and added them at the end with the cheese. I definitely agree not to make the pasta until the sauce is almost done, and that simmering as long as possible makes it richer. Everyone LOVED this. I'll be making it again!

This was fantastic! A dish I would expect in a 5 star restaurant. I did saute the shrimp and scallops in butter and white wine before adding them to the cream mixture.I also cut back on the pepper flakes and added diced fresh jalapeno. Served it with a simple salad and crusty french bread. Delicious!!

This dish was a huge hit last night with our friends!

It was easy to make and yielded about seven servings when served alongside a salad and crusty warm bread. 

I made a few adjustments to the preparation and cooking of this dish. 

1. To allow myself more time with guests I pre-cooked the pasta and pre-steamed the shrimp and the scallops. This allowed me to simply make the sauce and fold in the pasta and seafood with a five minute turn up of the heat at the end  to heat the dish back up to serving temperature. 

2. I halved all of the pepper measurements. I and a couple of my guests like our food mildly spicy on occasion, and a couple of my guests are crazy for hot/spicy food, so I figured half measurements would work for all of us. Even at half strength this dish is HOT HOT HOT. I could not imagine making this dish at full strength even for the spicy lovers.

This dish was amazing, and I will most definately make it again!

Wonderful recipe. Delicious flavors. We will definitely be making this again. As most people said...you can dial back the chili pepper or just omit it all together. The recipe amount of chili pepper is definitely spicy...I love really spicy food and this was good for me but my girlfriend would have preferred about half of what we put in. So good! Make it...you won't regret it.

I love this recipe.  The sauce is amazing and is awesome with chicken and/or sausage, as well as seafood.  I may even prefer it with chicken.  It's a close call, but you can't go wrong.  Fresh and dried herbs are easily substituted (in the right proportions, of course), and both are equally delicious.  I have never found this recipe to be too spicy, but reducing the amount of pepper is easy if you want to tone it down.  You can always start out light add more to taste.  The only changes I have made have been to reduce the salt a little bit (and I love salt)...especially if using sausage as the meat/protein of choice, and I use half-and half (fat-free or regular, depending on what I have).  Everyone always loves it!

Not a big fan of this. It was edible but I found the shrimp and scallops was all you could taste. However I didnt add any of the peppers as I was cooking for people who don't like any spice to their food so maybe thats why I wasn't totally satisfied. Either way I wont make it again.

Yummy!!!  Hubby loved it!  I used Lemmon pepper scallops, as that is all I could find @ the local grocery. I added 2 cloves garlic & decreased the red pepper by 1/2. Perfect!

So creamy, spicy and delicious. Used all shrimp and just the black pepper.  My 6 year old loved it!

This turned out great, I used what I had on hand, which was half and half, thickened it a little with a roux, used crawfish tails, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Next time I'll cut out the swiss cheese, but other than that it was great.  Thanks!

Did 2/3 lb for both shrimp and scallops.  I cut red pepper flakes in half and substituted cajun seasoning instead.  Did not help.  Should have cut the white pepper.  Added 1/3 cup more cream and added some extra cheese.  All in all, family liked it but think that the white pepper overwhelmed some of the other flavors.  Hope this helps!

I followed the recipe all the way except that I add 1/2 cup of the heavy whipping cream because my kids loves pasta with a little bit of sauce. Definitely this will be one of the dish that I will consider one of my quick GO TO dish for the family and guest. Thanks for sharing.

like the other reviews said, way too much pepper.  Would probably be really good, with  half the amount of pepper and salt.

Possibly the best dish my loyal servant made all month. Despite it being January 3rd this is the best dish I've had all year. Delicious, creamy, and just the right amount of spicy. Yum.

I made so many changes, these notes are for my own reference when I make again.  Used 2 lb bag frozen shrimp.  I added green and red bell peppers and mushrooms. Omit parsley., but kept green onion.  I cooked the veggies first then added the shrimp to the veggies, seasoning it with Cajun seasoning and chili powder and a whole tbsp of garlic powder!  Also add the basil and thyme (dried) to it instead of to the sauce.  However the veggies got way too soft.  So next time, sauté veggies separate and shrimp separate (more work but oh well).  
Used the full 2 cups cream,  and it thickens just fine when you add the cheeses.  Reduce Parmesan to 1/4 cup and used mozzarella in place of Swiss.  With all these changes it was still delicious!

I reduced the whipping cream by 1/2 and added 1 cup half&half, plus 1/4 cup dry white wine. I reduced the red pepper flakes by 1/2 but added 1 fresh jalapeno pepper and I replaced sharp white cheese for swiss.  My family loves this dish and it's definitely a keeper

Best seafood pasta and even better than restaurant pasta. I have been making this recipe for several years and everyone I make it for loves it. It's spicy but you can adjust that to taste.

This is one of the best pasta recipes I have ever had! It reminds me of T.G.I. Friday's Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta. My fiancé and I made this twice this week already and will probably be making it again, we are in love! I omitted the white pepper and did a mix of Parmesan and mozzarella cheese for the cup of cheese. This is a very spicy recipe so the second time I made it I used less crushed red pepper as well. Thank you so much for this recipe! Our fave!

This was so freaking delicious. I used a pound of shrimp instead of both shrimp and scallops. By doing this, ingredients for this recipe cost just under $20. The taste quality was if I would have spent $20 on one plate at a nice restaurant. This made enough for 5-6 hungry people. SO YUMMY!! I love spicy food and this was perfect. Maybe could have even added a little bit of cayenne pepper. 5 stars!!!

I have made this recipe several times.  I've always used shrimp as in the recipe but have added salmon & mushrooms and another time added white fish that I had in the freezer.  Don't think you can go wrong with whatever you add in.  It's delicious.

This was outrageous good!!    The sauce has a little kick to it (I don't like spicy but this was perfect) and it's great with fettucine - will definitely make again.

Very good pasta dish! The only thing I changed was I added a little bit more shrimp and scallops than what the recipe called for. The red pepper flakes really gave it a nice kick!

I wouldnt call this a "cajun" recipe. It is more of a spicy seafood pasta. I would have to say though, that this has become one of my favorite recipes! The presentation of this dish is truely beautiful with all the fresh green herbs and spices. It also packs so much flavor!! I make it as is except you have to simmer the sauce a lot longer then what it calls for in order for it to thicken. I also mix up the cheese combo each time. Some other reviews say this is not good leftover, but I would have to disagree. I only use shrimp, but the leftovers are even better once the herbs/spices set in overnight!

Cut the red pepper flakes to .5 t, and the fettuccine to 3/4 lb. It doesn't give you enough shrimp, scallops, or cream, so just cut the pasta by quite a lot.

It's a fine recipe, but it could stand to be creamier. I didn't have Parmesan, so I left it off and it just wasn't the same as another time when I had it. Maybe I'll try it with Swiss, parm, and romano so it's extra cheesy.

This was pretty easy to make, and my boyfriend and I loved it! It had a nice heat to it, too. Had leftovers and heated them in a skillet on the stove the next day and it tasted just as fresh as the night before. I do think I will be altering a few things, like less red pepper and less parsley, along with no green onions, and mozzarella cheese instead of swiss. AMAZING recipe though!

Great recipe, made it a year ago and was just reminded how good it was by somebody today. Subbed ziti in for the pasta, and my only suggestion would be to take it easy with the white pepper. All in All a Great recipes!!

I revised with some of the suggestions (whipping cream and half and half) and this is one of my favorites! Everyone loves it when I make it!

My husband LOVES this recipe... I had to make some changes though... added a T of garlic, halved the parsley, went a little lighter on the thyme and salt, and added a hint of butter and an 1/8 cup of cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it a bit. This is a definite winner for guests and a new family favorite!

This tasted really good. After going to two stores, I still couldn't find scallops so I left it out of the recipe. Also, I decreased all the peppers by half and only used a dash of crushed red pepper flakes for kidlet's sake.

This was fabulous.  I cut the red pepper in half because my family doesn't love the spicy as much as I do.  I also used angel hair instead of fettucinne because I love it, and I used langastinos instead of shrimp.  I'm sure it's fabulous JUST as specified here but I loved it a lot with the modifications I made too.  I'll definitely be making this again!!

I thought this was delicious!  I did add 1/2 more cream than it asked for.  I love lots of sauce.  And one other viewer said to add more scallops and shrimp and I think I should have.  I cute the recipe down to four servings.  It is FANTASTIC!  Will definately make it again.

I'm not a big seafood fan at all, I wanted to try scallops and this seemed like a good dish, it was very delicious the fresh herbs made all the difference. I would rate this as a great special event meal. My husband loves seafood and enjoyed this very much.

Followed the recipe and it is WAY too peppery as written.  It was very good but next time I will probably completely omit the white pepper.

If you can grow your own herbs, go for it!  Fresh herbs will make the difference here.  Go for flat leaf parsley in this recipe as I think it will yield a better flavor.  I substituted fat free half/half instead of heavy cream because the calories just weren't worth it.  I love my food 5 Thai stars or better but the spice of this was somewhat overwhelming and I wasn't allowed to enjoy the flavor of the seafood.  I'd suggest half as much of the black and white peppers or maybe some vinegar to cut the spice.  The pairing of the basil and thyme is brilliant!  I love the scallops as they take on the spice.. as I mentioned overpowering at times but the aftertaste is somewhat addicting.  I went with a half pound of both seafood ingredients and was happy.  I would add some minced garlic to this.  I was disappointed that the cheeses melded with the seafood and other herbs *creating a coating*... don't have enough cooking expertise to figure out how to avoid this.  Allow the sauce to thicken before adding to pasta!  tomatoes might be an interesting addition to this but only one or two at most.  I'd pair this with some good crusty french bread and a nice dryer white wine.  Don't use a wine with peppers... way too much for this!  A nice salad consisting of light basil, tomato and basalmic would be great!

I cut down the pepper substantially and it was still too peppery, which over powered the rest of the flavor!  Unfortunately I will not likely try this one again.

I like spicy food, but this was way too much for me!  When I saw how much pepper the recipe called for, I decided to cut it down to about 2/3 of what it called for, and I still had to add extra milk to cut down how spicy it was, and when I ran out of milk I was adding white wine in an attempt to make it bearable. I couldn't even taste any of the fresh herbs or cheese I had put in.

It was good.  I made in for my boyfriend who is from New Orleans.  Calling it "Cajun" is a stretch but it was a good pasta dish.

We halved the pepper as others suggested, and cooked the seafood separately in 1 tbsp olive oil with 1 tbsp cajun seasoning and then added it at the end. It was still on the outer limits of spicy. We decided to splurge and use the heavy cream, but it was so rich I think we would have enjoyed it more if we'd used half heavy cream and half milk. It wasn't bad, but I doubt I'll make it again, which is too bad because it sounded really amazing!

I'll give it 5 stars because it was easy, tasty and my husband absolutely LOVED it.  He felt it was restaurant-quality.   I did an ingredient search with shrimp/scallops/pasta and it was the best choice provided. However, I didn't have all the listed ingredients so I made a couple substitutions very common in the reviews.   1. I admit, I halved the pepper level right off the bat.  To me, it was "mild" and my family felt it was "medium" spicy.  So, a good balance for most people I'd say.   2. I used 1 cup cream and 1 cup half-and-half.  3. I added garlic and splash of white wine.  4. I didn't have any fresh herbs on hand so used the equivelent of dried herbs.    So, basically the same (haha!).   VERY tasty!

I liked the flavors in this but it didn't quite work out for me.  I used bay scallops (the big ones) and shrimp (pre-cooked) and I sauteed the scallops in olive oil with garlic, green onions and a diced red pepper, separate from the sauce ingredients.  However, I only browned the sides of the scallops, did not cook all the way through.  Meanwhile I made the sauce in another pan - I used light whipping cream which may have been a mistake - probably should have used the heavy.  The recipe says that it should simmer for 7-8 minutes but really I think that is too long - it should be only about 5.  I cooked the scallops the rest of the way through by adding them to the sauce and then added the shrimp at the last minute just to heat through.  I did find the dish to be very salty.  I had added a pinch of Old Bay seasoning (celery salt, paprika, peppers) but perhaps a little bit too much.  I did not add the white peppers to the recipe as other reviewers said that takes it over the edge, heat-wise.  I'll try this again - with heavy cream, simmering the sauce at a lower temperature and with less added sauce.  I served it over whole wheat penne. BTW -the fresh basil in the sauce is key - gave it a nice flavor.

This recipe turned out to be very good, I followed the directions as followed but added mushrooms and 2 tsp of garlic and allowed for them to sautee a little with the onions. Afterwords I added my already cooked shrimp to the rest of the mixture and let them simmer for awhile. The sauce was actually the most time consuming part of the whole recipe. The cream never seemed to really come to a boil but it was still fine. I cooked the sauce separately and added the whole cup of chopped parsley, and the instructed amount of everything else to it. I substituted the white pepper with Cajun seasoning. Once done I poured the sauce in with everything else and let it all cool so the sauce could thicken. Don't forget your cheese that's the finishing touch. I used the Parmesan but also added cheddar and mozzarella cheeses instead of Swiss. The only thing I wish I had done differently was add cornstarch so that my sauce would have been thicker.Otherwise this dish had a nice taste with alot of flavor. Will do again! Thanks

This pasta is amazing! My fiance and I make it all the time...I usually just have shrimp in my half, and he has chicken (he doesn't like seafood). We use 10% cream instead of heavy cream and still get the same creaminess with less fat. Also, we ALWAYS use fresh parsley...it gives it a wonderful taste.

Loved this recipe!I did cut back on the black pepper and omitted the white pepper(just because I didn't have it).My sauce thickened up perfectly and the whole family loved it. Also,added mushrooms just because I love them.

This is a total favorite.  I make only a few alterations...a splash of wine here and there and I use a frozen seafood blend from Trader Joes that contains shrimp, scallops and calamari. Absolutely fabulous dish. thanks

Per others' suggestions, I sauteed the scallops and shrimp in cajun seasoning and garlic and added them to the sauce at the very end.  I also used dried herbs instead of fresh, and I'm not sure if my calculations were off or not, but it was a little too "herby." Next time I'll use fresh.  Finally, it was just a little too hot, I think largely because of too much black pepper. I'll scale it down next time. But essentially a very good recipe.

I liked it very well.  I listened to other reviews who stated this recipe was very hot, so I cut the red pepper and black pepper in half.  Used fresh italian parsley and dried for the rest (due to availablity).  Did not have white pepper so omitted and other reviews stated to do this.  Used a six italian cheese blend and parmesean as stated by the recipe (I added a little more than called for).  Used sea salt.  I loved the taste, but my hubby did not.  Next time I will follow the recipe to the tee and use all the peppers and not cut it in half.  Will try it again, but for my friends and not the hubby.

This was an absolute winner! My boyfriend got 4 helpings (no joke). And this was the first time cooking for his mother and she really liked it also (whew!).  I used less (about half) red pepper flakes and used a cayenne/paprika/garlic salt equal part mix (total of 1 1/2 tbl sp) and that seemed to create that perfect kick while not overpowering the flavor. I also doubled the seafood.  Don't skip the fresh herbs - it's worth it!

This is a family favorite around our house.  I used a cajun seasoning recipe from this site which makes this dish very spicy, which can be adjusted to your liking.  This is a great basic cream sauce that is so easy and can be used in many other ways!

This is a great recipe! I'm not a scallop lover so I just add extra shrimp. It is a spicy one but you can easily adjust it for your taste. The first time I made this it was for a large party - about 50 people - I made it the morning of the party, mixed it together in a large foil pan and left it over a sterno during dinner. Another time I made it for only 6 adults. I made it and we ate it right away - just as good! I will definately make this again!

Recipe makes a TON!  May want to half it.  Tailored to the spicy tongue so it was a little hard for me to eat but I loved it.  Hubby gobbled it easily.  Used all shrimp, no scallops.  Thank you!

I have made this recipe several times, and it is one of the best on the site.  Recommended changes: cut red pepper to 1 tsp, white pepper to 1/2 tsp, salt to 1 tsp.  Add chopped mushrooms and red pepper to suit.  Use 1 cup fat free half and half, and 1 cup milk mixed with 2 tsp cornstarch.

I made a couple of modifications.  I added about two cups of sliced mushrooms to the mix, substituted one-and-a-half teaspoons of cajun seasoning for the mix of salt and peppers, and cut the cream (by about half) with non-fat evap milk.  We probably could have stood a BIT more heat, but it had a very pleasant "bite."  All in all a very satisfying, somewhat decadent dish....

OH MY GOD, this is SO good!! I've already made this recipe twice in 2 weeks! I did make a few changes: used dry herbs (parsley, thyme, etc.) since I already had them on hand, used mozarella instead of swiss cheese (hate it) and used andouille sausage rather than scallops (hate them). The sausage gave it a more Cajun feel as well. It was delicious!! My boyfriend LOVED it so much he bragged about it to his coworkers and let them try some - they loved it as well!! I will be making this again and again and again!

We loved it.  I did cut back on the hot pepper and I will cut back just a little more on the green onions next time.  My husband loved it just the way it was.  I will be making this again real soon.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made the casserole version of this and loved it.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh simply due to availability.  My two (picky eater) kids loved it, too, so that says it all!

This is super super extra hot even for me! To fix the problem and still have a kick we did 4 cups whipping cream and we used salad ship instead of normal. But over all man it was good.!!

I love this recipe... I have altered a few things to use what I have and what I like.  I have done this recipe with just shrimp and it tastes great.  I have used crushed red pepper and pepper flakes (both.. I love the kick)  I also don't buy fresh parsley and I just use less than the recipe calls for.  Yum, Yum, Yum!

Excellent! I used mozzarella cheese instead of swiss, and added green peppers & mushrooms as other reviews suggested.  I also added some cayenne pepper - about 1/2 tsp and I didn't think it was too spicy.  Overall, I loved the flavor and I would certainly make this again!

I made this for an engagement party.  Since I am on a budget and was feeding a lot of people, I didn't add scallops and instead added shredded chicken and andouille sausage.  I went easy on the spice due to other reviews and a couple people still commented that it was pretty spicy.  I personally thought it was PERFECT.  Just keep tasting it until it seems right.  I also needed to add liquid, so I added some half and half.  Overall, everyone loved it!

We found this recipe last week and made it for my family and they LOVED it!  We did too!  However one minor pitfall for most was that it was too spicy, so cut down the amount of red pepper flakes.  But otherwise this recipe was DELISH!  A must try!

Based on the cooments I did not put in all the pepper, rather I replaced it with Cajun seasoning and also added a clove of garlic.  I did use all fresh herbs.  Everyone raved and after sitting overnight the leftovers are even better having really soaked up the spice

I LOVE this recipe. It is great, ecspecially if you like spicy food! I make this for my boyfriend and I. The first time we made it we added mushrooms--which was a great addition. The second time, since I am a college student on a college budget, we used chicken but added spinach, mushrooms and tomatoes. We also add even more pepper...but that is only for the truly daring. A great meal that is truly versitle..it is easy to make it your own!

I am a pepper freak, so I didn't listen to the other reviews about reducing the amounts of pepper.  Thought I could handle it -- and I was wrong!! I will make the dish again because it has the potential to be awesome with less pepper.  The fresh herbs really make the dish.  --To reheat, we added additional milk to tame down the pepper.  Still hot, but reheated nicely.

This recipe is delicious, in fact my friends make me cook it for them all the time! However I'm a little cautious when it comes to seafood so I didn't use scallops. I replaced them with Bacon chunks. I also added courgettes to this recipe. I used tagliatelle instead of fettucine. I used dried herbs instead of fresh. And I used a combination of grated cheddar and grated red leicester instead of the swiss cheese and parmesan. Truly delicious, I'm making it again for my family tonight, and my housemates at uni love it - they say it gets better every time :) have fun with this one, it'll become a regular in any household :)

I really liked this, but it was sooo hot!  I was glad that I made it though.  It was something different.
HELPFUL HINT: When eating this meal, have a LOT of water with you!!!

Oh...Ma...Gawd!  This is sooooo good.  I didn't put in the white pepper cause I've never even heard of it and only put in one teaspoon of the red pepper flakes.  I did put all the black pepper in though.  I added the whole 500ml of whipping cream stuff and maybe another half cup of milk cause I started to panic i wouldn't have enough sauce, which I did. I'll totally make this when I want to show off to people.

i must admit that i forgot to bring the recipe on my trip and had to guess and adjust ingredient amounts to taste--but what a dish!  made it for a group of friends at the beach and it was such a hit!  to make the sauce go further for less money, i also added some shredded imitation crab meat which made the sauce nice and chunky!  i will make again and again--thank you!

I used crab instead of scallops.  It was AMAZING! The crab really thickened it up and it was perfect.  Really rich but really, really delicious.

Really super increadibly good. And EASY! because of the kids, I used only a fraction of the peppers. My husband and I just added to our own taste (medium for me, molten lava for him!) that way everyone could enjoy.

Wonderful!  However, I would use less red pepper flakes.  I love spice, but this was a little too much for both me and my husband.

Didn't care for the flavour of the sauce, I probably shouldn't have added as many peppers though.

This was really good.  I made a few changes, since we are dieting.  I used fat free half and half, dried Thyme, low fat parmesan, lower fat mozzerella instead of swiss, and whole wheat pasta.  I cut down on the pepper and salt (as parmesan cheese is very salty, I felt the amount listed was way too much).  I just did pepper(s) and salt to taste right at the end.  My husband liked it a lot.

This was delicious! I also put in imitation crab and lobster. I didn't put in any pepper flakes, but used the other spices and it was hot enough! It tasted great, and it made a lot. Even left overs tasted great!

Make this when you are not counting your calories! Served this to dinner guests and tweaked it just a bit. No red pepper d/t request. Increased the white pepper. Used 1 lb of scallops and shrimp. Dry herbs except for the parsley. Overall fabulous taste and texture. Might try blackening the scallops next time and add the red pepper. DELISH!

This was good. Being from Lousiana, I doubled the spices and then it was hot enough. Also used a lot of garlic, and added sliced portobello and red pepper as some others suggested. I used only scallops this time - and separately blackened them - but I will try shrimp next time around. This is even better the next day.

This recipe was excellent!!!  I did not add scallops because my husband does not like them, but the shrimp had such a good flavor.  Next time I will add crawfish tails as well.  Great recipe.  I will definitely do this again.

Very good!  It calls for a lot of parsley i added very little and still thought it was too much.  I also cheated and used grated parmesan cheese you should for sure use fresh.  Other than my oops it was great.  Thanks....I don't think my kids think the same.

This was a nice dish.  My husband really liked it.  I used half of the spices, as per other suggestions, and probably could've used all of them as I didn't find it too spicy at all.  Then again, I'm from Texas so perhaps my definition of spicy is a little skewed.  I will make again.

I thought this recipe had too much of a fishy flavor.  I would halve the cream and add a bit of cream cheese to neutralize the fish flavor a little.  Thank you for sharing!

This wasn't bad, but 2 teaspoons of salt is WAY too much. If I make it again I will definitely cut back on the salt!

We loved it! I didn't have any cream, so I used milk, butter, flour, and cream cheese. I used dry ingrediants, and cooked shrimp and scallops.  It was still amazing, and would def. make again!

Wonderful!  Made this several times for family and friends, who all loved it and wanted the recipe ASAP.  One looked up in the middle of the meal and actually said, with a very serious look on her face, I think this is the absolute best meal I've ever had.  The green onions were the perfect touch to a perfect recipe.  Cheers!

Delicious recipe. I didnt have fresh basil or thyme so I used the dry kind. Still turned out great. My husband said it had such flavour to it. Going to make this one again for sure!

I would give this a 5 star but it wasn't as spicy as it advertises (in my house we love dishes with lots of kick:)). However, it was an excellent creamy dish and I wouldnt mind maing it again. Kind of expensive though...

this was very good. i didn't have fresh herbs, so i used the dry ones i had on hand. i scaled them back but think it was still too much, but it still turned out to be good. my husband loved it, next time i will be sure to get the fresh herbs though. thanks for the recipe.

This was awesome!!!  I added fresh mushrooms and cut the red pepper flakes down to one teaspoon.  Rather than using fresh herbs, I use dried.  Turned out perfect!

I followed other reviews and used extra shrimp instead of scallops.  I made this for a large group of people and they loved it!  I cooked the shrimp separate with a little butter.  I also added a large pkg of fresh mushrooms and 1 roasted red pepper.  I cut the amount of green onions, since there were too many.  Overall this recipe turned out REALLY good and I will make again!!  Thanks for sharing Star!!

One of the best seafood pastas ever, even better than those found in restuarants! Instead of putting the uncooked shrimp/scallops right into the already-made sauce, I saute the shrimp/scallops with onions and garlic first, then added it to the sauce. Plus, I added my own version of Cajun seasoning. Simply dashing to the senses!

This is awesome! Better than most seafood pastas I've ordered in restaraunts. I used a little less peppers than was called for, but the heat was perfect. The swiss cheese seemed strange, but I loved it! Definitely not a low-fat meal, but great for a special occasion or company. Pair with a dry reisling.

Absolutely delish--this recipe is truly the best!  The extra "kick" comes from the red pepper!  I've also used half and half to cut down on fat, and it turns out just as fabulous!  Enjoy!

Great recipe, with the perfect amount of spice.  I added some crab meat and garlic.  Could do without the swiss cheese, as it makes it kind of oily the next day.

This dish was wonderful. I did cut the pepper amounts in half and I'm glad I did. It was plenty hot enough with only half! My daughter age 14 said it was the best dish I had ever made! Definitely will make again, next time for company  ;-)

This was great- however I used large shrimp and it was a little too big.  Not that you can ever have enough shrimp.  Next time I will use smaller shrimp, but other than that this was delicous!  A real keeper!

This recipe is just delish!! It is pretty easy to make as well. I used only 8 oz of pasta (this was for me, my husband and two young sons) and the same amount of sauce. It was just saucy enough for me so if i made more pasta I'd double the sauce. I also used linguini instead of fettucine.. and doubled the shrimp instead of using scallops(which I dont care for) and I also used a bit less red pepper cause I had two little boys eating it. Everyone RAVED. my husband said it is better than Olive Garden and couldnt get enough. I'm sure it'd be great more spicy as well.. I may have to try that sometime.. but its even delicious without much red pepper.. I also dashed some mcormick -1 step seasoning- roasted garlic and bell pepper on the top.. it added color and extra flavor(it didnt require tho) Placed them on a plate and it looked like and tasted like  resteraunt quality! It was even better warmed up for lunch the next day! A definite keeper! thanks!!

this recipe is not only great (and quick) but lends itself to variations, which works for me because i never have all of the ingredients. i've made it twice now - last night, i sauteed chopped portabello mushrooms and garlic in butter, added the scallops for a minute, sprinkled with flour and then added light cream and 2% milk. i only use scallops coz the hubby hates shrimp (sadly), and i use whatever cheese i have on hand. plus, i used whole wheat pasta. everything else was the same. i make it spicy :) it is so good! i am eating leftovers right now for lunch...

I mixed all of the spices together ahead of time but I only used about 3/4 of them. I forgot to add the cheeses toward the end which is the most important part but it was still good anyway.

If you like spicy, this dish is excellent!  When we don't feel like shelling out money for scallops and shrimp we sometimes make it with chicken which is just as good!

I love this recipe, I cut down on the red pepper and used hot itailian suasage instead of seafood.  It was good.

This dish was everything I was looking for, but when I make this again, I will marinate the seafood for more flavor. It was very, very good and tasted better the next day. I tried it with basmati rice too & it was scrumptious. Thanks for the ideas.

I made this for a couple of male friends of mine.  They loved it.  I thought it would have been better with some sort of thickening agent such as flour or corn starch.  The flavor was really good though.  I added a habenero pepper as well though which still didnt make it all that hot.

This is THE BOMB!!!  A 5-plus star, restaurant quality recipe.  I added about a teaspoon of Emeril's Essence to "kick it up a notch."  I also used a pound of shrimp and 1/2 pound of scallops.  If you like seafood pasta you MUST try this recipe!!!

Fabulous! We love spicy, but trust the advice about halfing the pepper. We cut the white pepper in half and only used a teaspoon of black pepper and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Turned out great! One more thing to beware of: If you add this recipe to your shopping list, it converts the red pepper flakes to cayenne pepper and you end up buying the wrong thing...

Made it last night. The boyfriend LOVED IT!! It was not over-spicy like some of the past reviews suggested. It was just right. I used some store bought alfredo sauce and omitted the whipping cream and swiss cheese. Everything was wonderful!!

LOVED IT!  I added another cup or so of cream so there would be plenty of sauce.  I did cut back slightly on the black/white peppers and I think next time I'll cut back the red pepper to 1tsp.  Oh, and I used about a pound of shrimp and no scallops.  I may add more shrimp next time because the SO is a shrimp freak.

I made this dish for a friends birthday (6 people) and it was a great hit. I scaled the recipe for 8 servings and it was absolutely delicious.  As recommended, I cut the pepper in half.  My friend call me the next day and said it was the best homemade meal she ever had.  Thanks for the recipe I will definately make it again.

This was not that great, though I did like its spicy flavor. The sauce tasted better before I added the cheese. I think it would be better with a little cornstarch and no cheese.

I'd will cut the pepper ingredients in half next time, but I still thought it was excellent and I look forward to making this again.  Mushrooms and chicken would be a nice substitue for the shrimp and scallops.  My husband loved it, too.

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner and it was fabulous.  I used no black pepper, only 1 tsp. white pepper and cut the crushed red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp.  It still had plenty of punch.  I think the full amount would have made it overwhelming.  I did add the meat from 2 dungeness crabs, some quartered portabella mushrooms, and a two chopped and seeded Roma tomatoes.  Yummy and definitely restaurant quality.  This dish would impress anyone that likes seafood.

This was delicious, but I would take the advice to cut the peppers by half and let those that eat add more as needed if serving to people with variable tolerances to heat.  I could not find fresh herbs when I made this, but it still turned out wonderful with dried herbs.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I left out the white pepper and it was still quite spicy, just right for me.  Also added red pepper.  I will be serving this next time I have company!

This is one of our all-time favorite recipes.  It is delicious and flavorful and very satisfying (although a bit heavy).  We make it without the scallops, and it is great.

Awesome recipe.  I sub'd chicken for scallops and also tossed in crab claw meat(not imitation). It would also be good if you only used chicken. My wife is not a big seafood fan. I did cut back on the red pepper and used 1 tsp. Otherwise, I went by the recipe. So I did not really cut back a lot I guess :) But my wife and daughter don't like a lot of heat. I barely noticed any heat with that little pepper to it. So if you like it hot, don't hold back. This is really good. Very flavorful. Awesome recipe. Thanks.

This recipe was soooooooooooo good! I included shrimp, scallops, and imitation crab. the imitation crab was a HUGE mistake.  It fell apart in the sauce and was waaaaaaaaay to stringy! i will not make this mistake again! the highlight of this recipe is definitely the sauce. it is spicy but soooooooo flavorful.  I didnt think the scallops enhanced the pasta that much and for the price that i paid for the scallops i will probably leave those out too in the future. I would also like to try this recipe with just chicken.  Really Really good! I highly recommend this recipe. If you dont like spicy you may want to cut down a little on the peppers.

I substituted chicken instead of scallops, per my husband's request, and it came out great, however, it tasted like there was a bit too much parsley.

This is an incredible recipe!  Very tasty.  Only changes I made was using dried herbs except for the parsley (just easier), deleted white pepper and cut back on the red pepper to 1/2 tsp so it wasn't quite so hot.

Yummy. My hubby and I both liked this a lot. It was really quite spicy. I'll definitely make this again. Next time I'll make sure that my sauce thickens up a bit more.

This recipe was, quite simply, awesome!  I added some sliced mushrooms and cut down on the red pepper (my husband likes bland) but this is one of the best seafood dishes I've ever made.  We will definitely make this again.  Soon!

This was a very tasty meal. I think it would be great with or without all of the pepper depending on your taste buds. It was also very easy to prepare.

This recipe was a big hit. I would cut the pepper in half next time and definitely make it again. It was just as good heated up the next day. One of my new favorites.

Wow - this was very easy and delicious!  I used 1lb of shrimp and 1lb of chicken per my husbands request.  I also used a little less crushed red pepper then suggested - it was very spicy!  I served it with garlic bread and salad!  The left overs (there was only a small amount) reheated nicely!  I will definitly make again - thanks for sharing!

This is really spicy! Made with all pepper in recipe.  Used half and half instead of heavy cream.  Added pasta to cream mixture after seafood was almost done.  It thickeded up then.  My husband loved this and couldn't bear to through out any leftovers.  I think it would be great (better) with chicken.  That's the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars.

This was delicious~!  It ended up sooo spicy though that I added an extra cup of cream.  Next time, I'll do a little less spices and maybe add either red bell pepper or bits of tomatoes for color.

Oh MY this is good! Ok, regarding the amount of pepper to add... we like spicy food so I added 3/4 the amount of pepper even though all the reviews say to cut it in half. Well, we'll be cutting in half next time ;-) Just still abit too peppery. Oh, throw in 2 large cloves of chopped garlic with all the other spices. Yum!

Yum!  This is one of our favorite recipes.  I omitted the scallops and used extra shrimp.  I also cut down the amount of pepper called for, and the pasta still had plenty of zip to it!

Excellent recipe.  I used almost two pounds of shrimp and some fresh crabmeat and it turned out wonderful.  I cut the pepper in half and it was still spicy.  Definitely will make again.

I just finished polishing off a big plate of this! It was super easy to make and delicious.  I would say that if you think BBQ potato chips are spicy, you should use the recipe as is.  If you are the type who adds hot sauce to everything you eat, then you should definitely add more spices.  I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it.  I used rigatoni instead of linguini and cut up the chicken & vegetables smaller. I can't wait to make it again with broccoli or asparagus like other reviews suggested.

Using fresh herbs gives it more color, but still looked bland(white & green).  I used shrimp, bay scallops, and chicken tenders(cut into bite-size pieces).  Your sauce must have time to simmer.  Preparation was quite longer than anticipated from recipe (approx 30 min). I suggest sautee seafood before adding them to the sauce.  It seemed as if it took longer in the sauce because of all the sauce.  It didn't look like it was coming out right, but it turned out to be very good.

I made this on Father's Day for my husband who LOVES spicy food.  He loved it, but boy is this a spicy dish! - and I only used half the portions of recommended pepper, onions, etc.  I used garlic fettucine for added kick (like it needed it).  Overall, this dish was great but I couldn't finish the whole plate.  My mouth was on fire!!!

The only alteration I make is to use all shrimp instead of scallops.  That being said, this is one of our favorites.  We love spicy foods, and this one really fits the bill.

I wish that I had followed the advice of some of the reviewers and halved the pepper portions.  We love spicy food, so I didn't think it would be a problem, but it was REALLY peppery.  So much so, that it overpowered all other flavors.  Definitely start with 1/2 and then add the rest by desired taste.  Added lots of other veggies and found that the leftovers were not as spicy and very tasty.  Will try again.

We have served this recipe for guests many times now and it receives rave reviews every time!  It can be a little spicy for some folks so we tend to go light on the crushed red pepper.

ohmygosh! unbelievably good!!! my boyfriend has a thing for seafood, and he raved about this pasta :-)  just one thing-- we reduced the cream to 1 1/2 cups, so it seemed "thicker". also used a little more seafood, less pasta. thanks, star!

This is an excellent recipe!!  I made it for a mardi gras party, and it went over very well...so well in fact there was none left!!  I didn't use the entire amount of peppers and we left out the scallops, I also added a bit of cajun spice and a can of evaporated milk to make more sauce.  it was soooooo excellent!!  Definitely one to try!

Great dish!  Very easy and quick to make! The only complaint was that the next day for some reason the sauce on my leftovers was next to gone.  It was just noodles and lots of oil (guessing from the swiss cheese?) Any suggestions on what to do?

AAAAA+++++ recipe!!  I have made this several times, mostly when entertaining and no one can ever get enough!!  I don't usually use white pepper bc I don't keep it on hand.  Have used both bay and sea scallops and/or shrimp and it's FANTASTIC every time. When I asked my boyfriend yesterday what his favorite meal I made at home was, without a doubt this was it!!!!!  Favorite recipe on allrecipes.com by far!

Great recipe when entertaining. I didn't change a thing, and they loved it. In fact they took home the leftovers.

I have made this dish several times and it is delicious each and every time. I would suggest (like other reveiwers) to cut the peppers in half as this is a really spicy dish. I have also experimented with other cheeses and it's good that way as well. Usually I fix it with shrimp and crawfish or just crawfish alone. A keeper.

This recipe is wonderful.  I can't get enough!  I did make it the second time with 1/2 the red, white, and black peppers.  I also sauteed green pepper, green onions, and mushrooms in a little butter and added to the sauce.  Just adds that much more.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was far and away a great recipe.  Even my girlfriend thought it was great (and she's usally not overly excited about my cooking!)

Add all of the spices...it comes out great...although I would have liked more sauce.

Excellent.  Cut the red pepper flakes and white pepper in half (at least).  Also, cut the Basil and Thyme to 1 tsp instead of 1 Tbl.  Still has plenty of heat and keeps the seasonings from overwhelming the dish.

Very Delicious.  The second time I made it the sauce was a little runny. Its thickens up if you toss it with the pasta and let it sit for a little bit.

An awesome recipe!  My husband and I both loved it and it was extremely quick and easy to make.  It was still a bit hot even after reducing the amount of pepper.  I will definately keep this in my recipe collection!!

This is delicious!  I've made it several times already, and it's what my husband always requests when it's his turn to pick.  Try using Italian parsley; we like it better in this recipe than the curly parsley.

I followed some of the previous reviews and cut down on the peppers and salt - it tasted great and was really easy! I also added some diced tomatoes to the top for garnish and flavor. I highly recommend this recipe!

I have now made this a few times and it is so good!  I used dried herbs, no onions and no parsley.  I also used 1lb of each shrimp and sea scallops (frozen and then thawed from sams).  You can always add a bit of extra cheese to thicken the sauce to your liking.  This is better than any seafood pasta dish i've eaten out.  Very impressive.

This is an amazing recipe!  It's absolutely delicious and quite easy to make.  I like the fact that you don't have to slave over the stove all evening and yet it tastes amazing!  The cream sauce is extremely flavourful and better than most restaurant dishes!  If you like Cajun Seafood dishes in restaurants you will absolutely love this!

I have to agree with a previous poster - you can double the liquid and keep the peppers the same if you aren't a fan of spicy food.  But I am, and I love this recipe as is!  I use andouille sausage, scallops, shrimp, crawfish, chicken....  you can get creative.  I make this at least once a month.  It's easily the best pasta recipe I have had, restaurant or otherwise.  Thanks Star!!!

This was VERY good. Scallops are not readily available in our area so we used extra shrimp (next time maybe crawfish which is more available for me). Also I will add more red pepper next time.  We like it spicy.

This was absolutely incredible! I cook for 12 guys on my group at the Firehouse and everybody LOVED it!I cut the red pepper down by 1/2 and it provided plenty of kick, I suggest the first time you cook it you do the same.AWESOME!

This is an incredibly easy and incredibly fabulous recipe. I mae it for my b/f and he was amazed that it was the first time I was making something like that. one note, check the potency of your black/white pepper if you have a very week black pepper you may want to add more. But if your black pepper is very hot add less

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut the amount of each pepper in half, but it was still WAY too spicy (and I love spicy food).  I can't even imagine what it would have been like if I had used them full strength!  I couldn't finish my serving...  If I try this again, i'll quarter the amount of pepper used...

This recipe is incredible! It was easy to make and very delicious. I made it last night for my boyfriend, who is a VERY picky eater.  He had a huge serving and went back for more.  I did only use 1 tsp. black pepper and 1 tsp. crushed red pepper and it was absolutely perfect. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Oh my word!  This was awesome!  And I don't give praise easily.  The only change I made was that I deleted the three peppers and instead sprinkled the seafood with cajun seasoning and olive oil and marinated overnight.  Just perfect!  And incredibly easy.

Absolutely delicious!  I tone down the pepper a bit since many don't like it quite as spicy as the recipe calls for.
This is my husband's absolute favorite and requests it often.  Restaurant quality yet simple to make.

this was completely delicious!!!!  I've made it several times, sometimes with the seafood, but it's also good when I substituted chicken.  I even used the basic sauce recipe without all the peppers and added some basil and made a wonderful basil pasta.  My family and I all absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!!!

Fabulous is the only way to describe this recipe.  I also halved the pepper amount and was glad that I did.  I also used all shrimp.  Presentation was gorgeous and taste was better than restaurant quality!

This was the first recipe I cooked from All Recipes and it was awesome!  I read all the reviews ahead of time and heeded the advice of the experienced, I used only half the salt and peppers, it was plenty spicy...perfect!  I am not a big scallop fan so I just doubled up on the shrimp...this recipe is definitely a keeper!  Can’t wait to cook it again! :o)

This was a excellent dish.  I also halved the spices, only because of my 14 year old son.  I could have went the full strength! :)  I also tossed the noodles with butter and garlic.  I was excellent, and I will be making it again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I cooked this meal for my husband as he was returning from out of town.  We LOVED it -- BUT -- it is a little too spicy.  I consider myself as one who has a high tolerance for spicy food, but this was a little much.  Definitely start with half the pepper and add more if you need to.

My boyfriend and I had this for dinner last night, it was very good.  I highly recommend the recipe.  I didn't add the pepper flakes, only the regular white/black pepper and did add about 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper.  It was perfect, not spicy.  I actually have some leftovers for lunch today.

Does it get any better than this?  I thought for a moment that I was at my favorite Cajun restaurant here in town.  This is a simple gourmet meal that I will serve at dinner parties.

We absolutely loved this recipe. My husband does not like scallops, so I used 1 lb of shrimp instead of scallops and shrimp. I also used only half of the peppers as suggested by others reviewers and left out the green onions. It turned out perfect. It tasted exactly like the Cajun Shrimp Pasta that Red Lobster serves. This will definitely be a common dish in our house. Thanks for the recipe Star.

Yum, yum!  I added a little flour to the white sauce mixture and used a parmesan and mozzarella mixture since that is what I had on hand.  I also blackened some salmon in the oven and used that instead of scallops and shrimp.  It was delicious - the green onions are a great addition!

This was the most fabulous fettucine! We changed the recipe a bit, we substitued one  freshly cooked dungess crab for the scallops. Also after draining the fresh fettucine we tossed it with 1/2 cup softened butter mixed with 5 cloves chopped garlic then served the sauce over the noodles. Highly suggest everyone to try this for family and company. We will be fixing this one again!!!!!

Awesome seafood pasta recipe!  I kept a little aside before adding peppers for my daughter. She loved it!! Half the pepper wasn' quite enough for me.  I am making it again today (by request!) and will go with about 3/4 peppers.  Enjoy - great dish for company!!

This was a delicious recipe. Received great reviews. I followed the advice of past reviewers and went with 1/2 of all the peppers and salt too since I'm pretty wimpy on the spicy scale.  Even with 1/2 it still had a pretty good bite to it.  I also added a hand full of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of dice onions and a couple of cloves of minced garlic to add some interest.  Turned out great!  Another keeper!

I was EXTREMELY pleased with this recipe.  It was just what I was looking for . . . well worth the effort and calories.  I didn't have the scallops so I used all shrimp - it was still great!  Would like to try adding some Chorizo sausage also next time.

Very easy! Very tasty! Half the spices were just right for our family.  Calorie count is a little high, but every so often is worth it.

Excellent!!!!!!  Excellent!!!!!  Excellent!!!!!!  I would go easy on the pepper though (at least the first time around)  I used 1/2 the pepper recommended and it still came out pretty hot.

I found this recipe to be truly tasty. I recommend taking an additional 5-7 minutes broiling it until its golden brown.

My family thought this recipe was really delicious! We didn't have the white pepper, but it was definately hot enough!
