It was very good and is great for leftovers too.  I did make a key change:  I used a homemade sauce instead of a jarred sauce.  The homemade sauce already had onion and garlic so I left those out of the main recipe.  I enjoyed the cheddar cheese in this recipe, my mother had always used only mozzarella.  I recommend this recipe and I look forward to having it again (with my own sauce recipe).  Oh yah, add some shredded parmessan after you take it from the oven!

this is great...what works for me is to add an egg in with the ricotta mixture. It really helps with the spreading, gives it a better texture.

I had to use more than double the amount of sauce that the recipe called for.  I also added some cottage cheese for more filling and flavor.  Otherwise, good.

Very good lasagna!  My husband & I enjoyed it very much.  I made a few changes, I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and also used Barilla lasagna oven ready-no boil noodles.I then added sliced mushrooms and shredded parmesan cheese.  This recipe was very fast & easy to make!  I'd recommend this to anyone.  This one is definetly a keeper!

Good quick and easy. I don't add any extra salt though. I also sub cottage cheese for ricotta,  and sprinkle some parmesan on top. The addition of a little cheddar to lasagna is just really good for some reason! (If any of you haven't tried the "new" ready to use lasagna noodles do it soon-they work great and are sure a time saver-no more wet,hot,torn noodles for me)!

Good basic recipe, just needs a little oomph.  Double the sauce, include parmesan cheese with the cheese mixture, spice up the sauce with some oregano or Italian seasoning and add some mushrooms (canned or fresh) and black olives to the sauce.  I also used part Italian sausage for my meat, along with the ground beef.

I am new at the whole Italian thing, being Irish (but having an Italian fiance).  We thought this recipe was really good but could use a lot more sauce.  The meat can also be halved if you don't want something too meaty.

I have made this Lasagna for 6 years and everyone loves it.  I love that it is so cheesy.  I use a little more than 1 pound ground beef and no bake noodles.  This is a keeper.

This was my first lasagna attempt. I was so worried it would not be good, but it really was, and it was easy. I, too, used a garlic tomato sauce, and added mushrooms. Oh yeah, and I used 2 10oz jars of sauce.

This was pretty good. I used a 26 oz far of garlic flavored sauce, which worked out pretty well. I also sprinkled cheese on top, which made it taste better. Thanks for the easy recipe!

I enjoyed how simple the recipe was. Instead of using ricotta cheese I used low fat cottage cheese and appreciated the taste difference. I also used more sauce since lasagna can tend to be dry. Good overall recipe

This was my first time making Lasagna, so maybe it was my fault.. but I found there wasn't enough sauce.. and when I mixed up the 3 cheeses, I couldn't evenly spread it over the meat sauce because the ricotta made it all sticky, so I had to drop little chunks all over, leaving opened spots with no cheese. I think if there were some spices, and more meat/sauce, it would have turned out better.

Great recipe! My 16 year old son made it so super easy. We also added an egg to the ricotta mixture along with some fresh oregano & basil. Will make it again but maybe try the oven ready lasagna noodles next time! Thanks for a quick yet easy lasagna recipe!

I've never eaten lasagna before, let alone cooked it. This recipe was easy to follow and come out pretty darn good. Needs more spices and like other reviewers said, a little more sauce. I also would say use basil and thyme! I look forward to trying this again, with a mix of Italian sausage and beef.

I love this recipe its easy to make and very tasty. I have tried this recipe a couple times once with ground turkey and also a vegetarian both were great. I also added more sauce but that's just my preference. I'm making this recipe for my boyfriend this weekend I know he's going to love it.

Lasagna was very good. I added sauted chopped mushrooms for texture. I thought that it could have been more cheesy. I probably would have added more mozzarella. I also added some extra seasoning (basil, garlic salt. . ) Over all I thought that It was a little bland but the boyfriend told me that It was better than BRAVO'S lasagna!!

My boyfriend absolutly loved this! It was my first time ever even making lasagna and he said it was better than his mom's! I didn't use cheddar cheese though, Instead I used two pounds of mozzerella. I wish I would've put in more sauce.

Simple and taste fine.  I prefer World's Best Lasagna from this site though.  Tip for all Lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles.  Soak raw, hard noodles in a big bowl of hot or boiling water for 30 min.  Noodles won't be cooked, but soft and will complete it's oooking in the oven.  Try it.

I tried this as my first attempt at Lasagna, and it was very easy to make, and my household gobbled it down.  Was told it was even better the next day.  I substituted spicy sausage taken out of it's casing for the beef, which added a little bite, but great flavor.  Excellent recipe!

This was a quick, great tasting recipe. In addition to the beef, I added 3/4 pounds of mild italian sausage removed from its casing. Plus I used more sauce than the recipe called for.  It was delicious. I will definately make this again and again.

This didn't have much flavor as is...so I had to doctor it up...added more garlic and a chopped onion, sliced olives and chopped bell pepper to the sauce.  I also used Italian sausages along with the beef.  I added a package of thawed drained spinach to cottage cheese and instead of mozzarella used pepperjack cheese.  I didn't cook the noodles, just made sure the sauce was "saucy" with canned flavored diced tomatoes, covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes and then uncovered it for another 15 to 20.  Now the kids want the pepperjack in their lasagna no matter the basic recipe!

Best, easiest, cheapest lasagna ever! I have made several versions of lasagna, and this is the only one that my whole family goes back for seconds and thirds of (even my very picky 6yo). I found it helpful to double the recipe (except the noodles) to make it fill my 9x13 pan.

this recipe has the right mix of ingredients for me.  I love this yummy basic lasagna.  I had a pan that was a little too big I think so I had to freestyle with the ingredients a little by adding almost another whole jar of sauce and grabbing some munster cheese I had leftover.  I also added 2 packets of splenda to the sauce mixture for a hint of sweetness.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is very close to how I make my dish, however I use 3 kinds of meats, Hamburger, Italian Sausage (Bob Evans) and Denver Steak, the hamburger and sausage are 1 lb each, the denver steak is about half a pound,(I cook the steak medium/well, then chill it and then chop it in fine cubes and mix all 3 meats together in a big bowl) and then I add 6 kinds of cheese, Cheddar, Colby/jack, Provolone, Mozz and Ricotta.. (again, mixing all the shredded cheese in a large bowl) it makes for a very heavy and filling dish. plus I make mine in 4 internal layers with the final layer topped with sauce, mozz and a little cheddar for color.. try it.. you will LOVE it.

I've been making Lasagna similar to "World's Best Lasagna" since I was in grade school, but thought I'd try someone else's recipe for a change of pace. This recipe was good. Very good, as a matter of fact (I gave it 4 stars because, as good as the recipe is as written, I think the additions I made to it made it even better): I made my own sauce; used large curd cottage cheese (for the first time ever -- wanted to try it) instead of ricotta; added 1 egg, fresh parsley and grated locatelli cheese to my cheese mixture (some habits simply die too hard to change :)); and cooked 1/2 lb. Sweet Italian Sausage (cases removed) along with the ground beef. My family especially liked the addition of Cheddar Cheese (another "something I had never done before"). I've always thought Lasagna tasted better the next day -- but, prepared this way, I didn't have any leftover!

This was a very good, basic lasagna and it was very easy!  I will add it to my list of "regulars".  I did have to alter it a bit, though.  There is no way 16 oz of spagetti sauce is enough.  Like others, I had to put it 1.5 regular jars of spagetti sauce in the meat mixture.  I also didn't have cheddar, but made do with mozzerrella, and it was still pretty tasty.  Had a little trouble spreading the ricotta, but maybe it was just a layering error on my part.  Anyway, we really liked it when it was done!

This was great. The only changes I made were I added an egg to the cheese mixture and I used the big jar of sauce. I think it would have been too dry with less sauce. I also used the no-boil noodles to make this meal even faster to prepare. Yummy!

So Delicious! My husband LOVED it and was very impressed! (very important! ;) )  He told me to keep the recipe close by.  I added cottage cheese to the cheese mixture, I don't even like the stuff, but in this it was absolutely great).  I also followed advice and added lots more sauce (Prego traditional).        *Delicious*

Was ok. Too much cheese, not enough sauce. I used ground turkey that I browned with the garlic and added an onion. The sauce came out so flavorful that way. I wish I would have used more in the recipe!

Pretty good lasagna, but not as tasty as I had hoped. Maybe it was the pasta sauce I used (28 oz. Barilla).  It was easy and I liked the addition of cheddar cheese.

My husband said it best whenhe said this was the best lasagna that he had ever had. This is comming from someone that does not care for Lasagna. I did not change a thing. Mixing the cheeses with the ricota cheese made all the difference. Thank you for a great Recipe.

I have fixed this recipe several times.  I use a larger size jar spaghetti sauce and lost more cheese. I also use Italian Sausage instead of beef on occasion and will add mushrooms.  Its one of my sons favorite dinners.

this recipe was quicker than normal for lasagna, and has a cheesier texture than most. it's also less expensive to make than most, which is always a plus!

Easy to make.  Delicious.  Anytime I make it I get a crowd.  I can't make it to take to anyone else without making one for home also.  My husband loves it.

Thank you, Brenda!  This is a delicious and easy lasagna recipe!  I added mild Italian chicken sausage along with the ground beef - great addition.  Also, depending on the type of jar sauce you use, you may need to spice it up a bit.  Mine needed garlic powder, and a few shakes of dried oregano, basil & parsley. I added the shakes between the layers (and on top for looks.) 

Also, it's great that you mix the cheese before you layer it.  This really helps the ricotta spread more evenly.  

I highly recommend this great Italian favorite!

The only lasagna I've ever liked is my dad's. Watching him make it growing up looked like WAY TOO much work. So....at 32, this is the 1st time I've ever tried making it myself. It' GREAT! I just can't tell my dad I tried someone else's recipe. Ha ha. Anyway, th 16 oz package of pasta was perfect. I only had 2 noodles left over. I used a 32 oz. jar of sauce and mixed sweet Italian sausage w/ the ground beef for added flavor. The only negative was that I had too little chees for the top. But me being a cheese lover, it's possible I layered it on a little too thick in the middle. Will do just a tad more next time. THANK YOU!!!

Really good!! The only thing I would change is to add a bit more spaghetti sauce. It was just a little bit dry. Also, a 16 oz package of lasagna noodles proved to be far too much. I could have made another lasagna with all the leftover noodles I had.

This was not hard!! My first time fully preparing a meal, and it went over swell. I used a little more sauce because the jars were big. Half way through, I stopped everything to figure out just how to mince garlic. It didn't seem to harm the meal any. when I put it all together, I had WASTED SO MUCH!! I had enough to double, maybe triple, the dish!! I don't know how I managed to do that..I tried to give it to my dog but there was just so much!!! But it was enjoyed and I thank you. It had a big garlic taste, I've been told.

This was my first attempt at lasagna and it turned out great.  I threw in some extra garlic and chopped onion.  You will DEFINITELY need more sauce!  I dumped in a 26 oz jar and then ended up adding about another 8 oz.  It also made so much that it filled a 9x13 and then also a square pan (which I needed the rest of the second jar of sauce for).  Husband loved it, me too!  Will make again!

Very yummy.  I needed more sauce than it called for and I only mixed the cheddar in with the ricotta and put the mozzarella on top.  I baked for 30 minutes but it could have baked a bit longer, about 45.  Good recipe.  Will make again!

Very quick and easy!! I used a sauce that had garlic in it, so I did not add any. I did add some basil. Next time I might try using sausage instead of beef. Very good!!

This has to be the easiest lasagna recipts of all time.  I used Barilla Mushroom & Garlic pasta sauce.  I didn't have ricotta so I just used mozzarella, chedder, and some romano.  It was delicious.  My boyfriend & his brother said it was better than their mother's.  I don't want to go there, but it was definitely better than my usual version which takes twice as much time & effort.

Yeah for Brenda! I love this recipe and it is so much more simple than most! The cheddar cheese really makes it unique! Never many leftovers when we have this! I do use a jar of store bought garlic and onion tomato sauce, instead of the clove of garlic.

This was okay as it is written. I had to use two 24-ounce jars of pasta sauce in order to have enough. No way is one 16-ounce jar enough unless you like virtually no sauce in your lasagna. The only other change I made was to add an egg to the ricotta cheese to make it a bit easier to spread. A decent basic recipe, but if you tweak it a bit based on your own preferences, it becomes a good one.

Delicious!  I left out the garlic clove and instead added Adobo and garlic powder.  I added brown sugar and a little water to my sauce - (used 2 jars).  In addition I added parmesan cheese an egg to the cheese mixture as a viewer suggested. I adjusted the cheese to my liking ( a little more). Best Lasagna I ever made! Thanks for sharing!

Followed this recipe to the T except I didn't have ricotta cheese but I did have plenty of cottage cheese. I would have to say this recipe is great except it needs at least double the cheese and sauce and half the meat.

The recipe is all right, but I made a few changes. I used ground Italian (mild) sausage and sautéed the garlic and onions before browning it. There was not enough sauce. 16oz. didn't cut it. I would use at least 32oz. I also will add more meat next time, possible 1lb of beef in addition to the sausage.

Great simple recipe, however the recipe was not in proportion... The sauce/cheese/meat combination was in short.  I was afraid it would be so, however I did an additional layer with sour cream and cottage cheese and turned out perfect.  Would highly suggest that this be updated so that it reflex the proper amounts of sauce and meat.

i just did this recipe an found that i needed more then just 1 pound of beef i needed 2 at least as the 1 pound only made enough for 1 layer which then made me waste a lot of cheese, i just hope it turns out good :)
