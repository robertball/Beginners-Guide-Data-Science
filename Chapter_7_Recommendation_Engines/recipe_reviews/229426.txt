This came out great! Okay, I'm a sci-fi fan, so I had to make it into a "roast sand-worm" as you can see from the photo, but everyone loved it. Pear butter makes a good substitute for apple butter, too.

So yummy and easy.  Like another reviewer said, I had to increase cook time and temp but that just depends on the size of your pork loin.  I will be making this again!

Being slightly inept at cooking I probably didn't manage this quite right (in terms of arranging the bacon) but overall it came out great. Seems to be a pretty forgiving recipe!  I did increase the temp and cooking time.  The bacon becomes almost "candied" and was a really nice addition.

Tried this tonight, the flavour was awesome. I had 2 smaller tenderloin pieces that were 3lbs together, but they were partially frozen still, so time to cook was longer than recipe stated (but understandable).  The flavour was fabulous! I didn't have maple bacon, but the apple butter and honey were very thick, so I added some pure maple syrup to the glaze which gave a nice hit of maple flavour.  Will definitely do this one again!

I've cooked this recipe on the grill, indirect heat. It's great!
Brush the apple mixture, then wrap with bacon, but save the final brushing of the apple mixture for the last ten minutes of cooking, otherwise the sugars will darken too much.   I used applesauce, didn't have apple butter.
This goes well with a side dish of fried apples and onions. Core and slice thin an apple or two, mix varieties if you can. Slice an onion or two. Save a piece of fatty bacon, fry it up, then fry the apples and onions in the remaining bacon fat. Add a half teaspoon (total) of your favorite blend of allspice, clove, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg. If you like things sweet, drizzle a teaspoon or two of honey or maple syrup at the last minute or two of frying.

Yummy! Had to really adjust the cooking time. I had a 3.5lb roast and it took 1 1/2 hours on 350 degrees. The glaze got a little dark (probably because of the cooking time) so I would cover it next time for the first half of cooking, but will definitely make again!!

This was incredible! I added some cut up granny apples and saved some of the bacon grease to fry some green beans and onions.

Absolutely loved it. Rave reviews from the family. The apple butter compliments the meat very well... did have to increase bake time and adjust oven temp, but will deffinately make again. Very easy prep for a luscious meal. Thanks!

Tonight will be my second time cooking this in the past 30 days, it is that good!  I did not have apple butter either time, so I substituted squeezable applesauce.  Also, I am using pre-cooked bacon this time (another user suggestion).  The taste the first night is fabulous, but the flavor when you heat up the leftovers (if there are any) is amazing!  Oh, I did not cook on 325 degrees.  My tenderloin had cooking directions of 425 for 25-30 minutes.  I believe that the original author of this recipe might have meant that, because at 425 degrees for 27 minutes my pork is perfect temp and texture.  Making this a fantastic week night quick fix.

This was excellent...I followed it exactly except for the amount of cooking time since every oven is different.  This was so simple and took no time to prepare but it sure does look like you spent hours making it.  One of the best recipes ever.

Great recipe!  Served last night for the first time for a small dinner party.  Everyone raved.  Great blend of flavors.  Pork  turned out very tender; two people commented they could cut with a fork!  The only mistake I made was not cooking the bacon enough initially.  Author says cook until browned but still flexible.  Make sure to do that.  Also please be sure to use a broiler pan as the instructions say - I used a regular pan and the bacon on the bottom didn't crisp.  Broiler pan is the key!  
Thanks to the author for this great recipe!

I love this recipe! I increased the temp to 350 and cooked for an hour and 15 minutes because I had a fairly large loin. Very tasty and the sauce is wonderful. Will make again.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I just used apple butter smeared on top and packaged pre-cooked bacon underneath and over the top a 2 lb. pork loin. I wrapped it in foil and baked. Wonderful flavor and not too sweet! However, I got distracted, didn't check the internal temperature and overcooked. For those using a convection oven: 350 degrees for 40 minutes = 120 degrees (not enough). So back in the oven for 20 more minutes which was too much:  350 degrees for 60 minutes = 165 degrees.  Perfect would have been 350 degrees for 50 minutes. Oh well, hope my error helps....

I have made this twice now. First time I used pumpkin butter because it was all I had and just now I used apple butter. I must say they both were great, but I liked the pumpkin more.  That flavor was more intense.  I use precooked bacon straight from the package (Kirkland brand) and it works great. I can get this prepped in 10 min by skipping the step of cooking bacon.  I put my 1.5 lb loin in at 375 for 40 min, bc I was low on time. Glaze got a bit dark even on the bottom rack. Next time I will allow an hour or so to cook it on 350. I love how easy this is even on a work night, thank you!

Had a 2.9lb pork tenderloin that took over an hour to cook even though it started at 350 degrees for the first 30 minutes.  Other than waiting over an hour to eat dinner the flavor was delicious and the bacon was definitely the best part.  If you are going to make this definitely turn up the heat in the oven to at least 350 and plan for longer than 30 minutes.

Recipe was a huge hit but had to triple the cook time with a 3 pound tender loin. At 30 minutes it was still raw.

Made this last night and it was great!  I ended up cooking mine at 350 for about 2 hours, but my pork was 2 tenderloins that added to about 3.5lbs.  All the flavors went marvelously well together.  Next time I make this I'm going to try these tweaks for more flavor: inject the apple butter in the meat, poke holes in it, and then rub more on; before wrapping the bacon and putting more on and allowing it to marinate in the apple butter and bacon a few hours.  More apple butter and bacon, and then my bacon started to blacken, so I'll probably also lower the temp and raise the cook time.  Over all, a great recipe, and I can't wait to try it again, but with more flavor!  This also goes great with apple butter pie!

This recipe calls for a 3 lb tenderloin, which sounds misleading. Shouldn’t it be a pork loin? The two cuts are very different, and need different preparation and cook times. From the comments, it sounds like reviewers have used both cuts. This should be clarified.

Recipe was very yummy but the temp and time need to be adjusted.  I had to bake at 350 for about 45 mins to get the minimum temp.  I’m a beginner cook so this recipe was a good starter and confidence booster.  It was very yummy with minimal effort.

I made this for supper tonight.  This was so tender 
you could cut it with regular knife.   I didn't have apple butter so, I used orange marmalade and maple syrup.  Followed the directions except I cooked the pork tenderloin in my cast iron skillet.  Used rolled up tinfoil under the pork as a rack,  at 375 for 30 min.  Then I covered with tinfoil for 30 min. uncovered for 15 mins.  This was wonderful.  My grandson has never eaten pork tenderloin until tonight.  He loved it.

This was amazing!  I didn't have apple butter, so I used unsweetened applesauce.  I didn't have allspice, so I used cinnamon and a dash each of nutmeg and cloves.  With wrapping, I sure didn't get 8 slices to do the deed twice... I used a whole pound to get it fully covered one time.  Not that there's anything bad about that... Anyhow, I tasted the sauce before using it, and found it very, very bright and sweet, with little depth.  So I added about a teaspoon of decaf instant coffee (unreconstituted).  That added some nice depth to the flavor.  Since I couldn't wrap the tenderloin twice, I glazed the meat itself, then wrapped it, then cooked 30 minutes, then glazed again, then returned to the oven.  This got rave reviews, and I will make it again!  By the way, those mentioning 160* as the proper temperature, the USDA has finally caught up with the chefs and has lowered the temp to 145*.  Trichinae is very rare in the USA these days, and is killed at temps below 145* anyway.  Enjoy!

I had my husband make this last week when I worked late.  As with everyone else it took longer to cook that stated. We didn't have apple butter so he substitued cinnamon apple sauce, a recommendation I found on line.  It was Delish! All 3 kids thought it was great and went back for seconds.

While I changed up the cooking method and cut of meat this still turned out excellent!  I used a fresh ham in the crockpot, cooking on low for 8 hours.  It shredded easily and had a wonderful apple/bacon flavor!  I served it with BBQ sauce, collard greens and tater tots.  I'll definitely make it again soon, as my men gave it a big thumbs-up!

This is a good recipe. I felt like something was missing though. I couldn't figure out what it was. I will definitely try it again and I hope I will figure it out. Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out very well.  I had a tenderloin, bacon and honey.  That is all the recipe ingredients I had on hand.  So I used a jar of Jamaican Pineapple salsa, mixed it with honey and a little bit of chilli spice.  I never measure unless baking.  The bacon is a nice touch.  It was delicious and well liked by my family.  I will try it again when I have apple butter as we like that a lot

I made this roast for my mother's birthday dinner and got raves for it. The presentation is beautiful with bacon and the glaze. I'm making a smaller version for my husband  and me tonight. Looking forward to it!

This was delicious and very moist.  I'll definitely make this again.  I didn't have allspice, but googled and learned it's equal parts cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.  My family thought it was overpowered by the clove.  Next time I'll adjust the clove down and increase the cinnamon. I have no idea why the original poster says to only cook for 30 minutes and to an internal temp of 145.  Pork is supposed to cook to 170 and at 350 it took 90 minutes.

I would make this again but had to make some adjustments to recipe and would still make more next time. I used cherry almond butter as a sub since that’s what I had. I had difficulty wrapping the bacon as the pieces weren’t long enough to go all the way round my tenderloin but they still adhered during the roasting. I will definitely add more spices to the marinade/glaze next time to give it some zip. Everyone enjoyed it though as it was but seemed to be lacking something to me. Lastly, I ended up increasing oven temp to 350 degrees as it was taking a long time to roast. I only used a 2 lb tenderloin and it took almost an hour to roast not 30 mins.

I added a BBQ spice rub to the applesauce as I cooked it sown to an apple butter.  So I got a nice sweet heat from that.  I used 2 pork tenderloins and wrapped them side by side together in the bacon. I figured there was less of a chance to over cook them that way. I also placed them on a sheet pan with baby creamer potatoes under them to provide a bit of a "rack" and the bacon and apple butter flavored the potatoes.  I will be making this again!!!

We really enjoyed the  Bacon Pork Tenderloin.  We didn't have any apple butter so we used maple apple syrup instead, and I made an apple stuffing.   I served the tenderloin with rice and various vegetables.

This was delicious!! I substituted cinnamon for allspice since we didn’t have it and just a pinch of chili powder because of the kid, used thick cut bacon and it was so yummy. Even the kid ate it! Cooking the bacon beforehand made a big difference.

I loathe even the smell of cooked apples, so I substituted apricot preserves for the apple butter and it was VERY tasty.  I'll make this again in the future.

Little disappointed.  Followed the recipe exactly, BUT, 30 minutes cooking time at 325 degrees was not enough to get to a safe eating temperature for pork.  So had to cook a little longer. Also with the broiler pan, all the juices and glaze  went to the bottom of the pan and the meat was dry.  Might try it again with a different pan.

the recipe was excellent. I had a 3.5 lb roast abd thirty minutes at 325 was definitely not enough time.  I had to increase the temp and cook probably and hour longer.  I increased the temp to 400

The flavor is good, but if you smear the glaze on the pork over top of the bacon, the pork doesn't really get much flavor from the glaze; the bacon does.  I baked it at 350 for approximately an hour, until the thermometer read 150.  I then let it rest for 15 minutes.  I baked 2 separate loins, totaling 3 lbs,  that I just squished together in the pan and baked like a bigger one.  If I were to make this again, I'd coat the pork with half of the glaze, wrap the loin in bacon, and then do another coating of the glaze.

This was amazing!  I used pear butter as I couldn't find apple butter that wasn't made with high fructose corn syrup (which I have an allergic reaction to).  But it was still sweet, and bacon-ee.  The tenderloin faired very well under the weight of the bacon and was super moist.  Highly recommend.  I WILL be making this one again!

Like breezy75, I had to cook it 1 1/2 hours.  I think I would increase the spices to add a little more zip.  May try it again.

Was trying to find something different to do with a pork loin that I had and found this recipe.  It was an instant hit!  My daughter (who is critical of most things I cook) absolutely loved it and even wanted the leftovers the next day!  It was flavorful and moist, even after reheating in the microwave the next day.  I think the only thing I will do different next time is double the amount of the sauce to spread on it so that there's a little more of a glaze.  I did have to adjust the cooking time for mine, but that wasn't a big deal.  I will definitely make this again.

Like others have said, the pork is nowhere near done in 30 minutes.  But the recipe is very easy, the flavor is good and my boyfriend loved it! So it's worth the extra cook time I suppose.

flavor did seem to penetrate past the top 1/16 of the surface of the pork. Will try a few changes next time to infuse the pork with more of the flavor

I made this for my family this weekend and it was a hit (even with my very picky eater)! The only thing I did differently was to use apricot preserves as the store didn't have any apple butter in stock. It was delicious and moist. I did raise the temperature and cook a little longer as other reviewers recommended.

I think people should use common cooking sense when trying recipes.  ovens cook differently, different  I don't like apple butter so I substituted something different and loved recipe.

Followed the directions and the meat did not cook. Took advice from other reviews and cooked longer.  Still did not turn our right.  Apple butter mixture burnt on the pan and ruined it.  I would never make this again.
