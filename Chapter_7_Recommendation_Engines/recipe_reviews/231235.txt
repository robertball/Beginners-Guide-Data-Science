an absolutely amazing dish- thank you so much for sharing. this is a new favorite in our house. but the serving size is too small. we used a smaller brie, since i couldn't get a 9 inch one and it was gone within minutes, shared by only 2 people... i will definitely make this again!!!

It was a huge hit Christmas day, even with the son that swears he does not like pepper jelly! So super easy and delicious, I will be making this again!

Really enjoyed this!  Next time I'd use more of the hot pepper jelly!

This would have been very good if my Brie hadn't turned to liquid.  Any ideas why this happened?  I might try to roast the garlic first, then add the red pepper jelly and the garlic after baking the brie.

Loved it! Super easy. Garlic is super strong so maybe a little less, used smaller wheel of cheese and should have used broiler for 30-60 seconds. 
Family loved it!

Everyone loved the taste of this. But it melted too much and had to be spooned out and the rind never got soft. May have cooked maybe 5 minutes more than it should have.

Easy to prepare and quite yummy!  I didn't have any red pepper jelly so used another milder jelly and it was still excellent.  Would be even better if I'd followed the recipe!

I took this to my book club meeting and had rave reviews.  You have to like garlic and hot spices.  It was so easy to make I was worried it wouldn't taste good.  Boy was I wrong!!!   I used crackers but I think sliced baguette would be better.

Not a fan of working with puff pastry. I can never get it right. I would reduce the garlic a bit next time.
