This is a very mellow and slightly sweet dessert.  I did add more extract than what the recipe called for...simply because I am partial to almond, and next time will probably up the sugar to 2 cups.  I didn't add the other fruit like instructed, we just enjoyed the "ice".  Very similar to jello, but the taste can be altered to your liking.  Hubby really enjoyed this and is a good snack for the kids. Thanks Sadie.

I must be too used to fruit flavored jello, because this was not good at all.  Very pretty, but I did not like it.

I'm giving this 4 stars because it has potential! I hated the cantaloupe... but my dad loved it. I really liked the strawberries and grapes with the almond gelatin. I agree that it may need more almond extract, maybe another teaspoon. This recipe will use up your almond extract quick, so be wary, that stuff's expensive! Otherwise, very pretty and easily adjusted if desired. Great for summer :)

Pretty good stuff--light and tasty. Bit of sugar or whipped cream and it passes as a fine dessert.
