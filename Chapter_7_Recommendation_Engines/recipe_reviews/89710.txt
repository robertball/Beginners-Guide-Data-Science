This soup does sound wonderful.  I believe that one can of tomatoes is about a pound, so I would start out using three cans of tomatoes.  Hope this helps you.

We loved this soup! You get more than just soup! The strained leftovers make a sort of pesto. I sliced some French bread, toasted it,then spread some of the "pesto" on the bread and sprinkled it with grated Parmesan cheese and baked for about 10 min at 350. You can also use the "pesto", add some sour cream and grated Parmesan and make a delicious dip!

Excellent soup, though very similar to others I've tried from this site.  I think its main distinction is the addition of onion, and a good amount of it at that. It may have added extra flavor but to tell you the truth, I didn't notice an appreciable difference than those I've made without the onion. I prepared the recipe pretty closely, only adding a couple dabs of tomato paste since my tomatoes weren't as ripe as I would have liked them to be.  That proved to be a great addition! Loved the flavor boost it provided. I topped each serving with an herbed crostini and fresh basil for garnish. Fresh, simple and satisfying.  And pretty too!

This is a very good recipe!  Even my 16 year old son had a second helping.  I followed another readers advice and added a 1/2 tsp of organic sugar, 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar and 1 sauted garlic clover.  Also I highly recommend blending to get a smooth consistency, however I used a food processor.  A keeper.

FANTASTIC.  I had a surfeit of basil (and I adore it), so I added 1/2 cup more to the recipe.  I also replaced the heavy cream with fat-free half-n-half.  With a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top, I had one of the best homemade soups I've ever tasted!  Thank you!

Too much broth, too watery and not "creamy" and bit too much basil. Will stick to my regular recipe.

Good recipe. I added a couple TB white wine, 1 clove of garlic and a tiny bit of oregano. I also ran 3/4 through the blender and left the rest chunky. My 3 yr old loved it and he hates tomatoes!

I exchanged fat free half and half for whipping cream to reduce calories and fat. I also added a teaspoon of sugar to taste becuase I don't use salt in my foods. Overall it was pretty good and really really easy.

We had a bumper crop of Roma and Hanover tomatoes from our garden so we decided to make this soup for the first time. Stayed pretty close to the recipe, but sliced and roasted the tomatoes with a little EVOO and salt,  for about 25 min. See pic. Then added them to the pot and simmered with the broth and other ingredients. Most of the skins floated to the top and were easy to skim out. After 20 min we took an immersion blender to it, and then finally put in the cream and simmered down. Was excellent with grilled cheese on crusty bread on a chilly fall afternoon!

I have made this soup twice now. Once with canned tomatoes, and just this evening with tomatoes fresh from my garden.  Boy what a difference.  When using canned tomatoes, I would add about a tablespoon of brown sugar to cut the tartness out of the tomatoes as well as adding an extra 1/2 cup of cream.  When I made it using the freshies, I didnt add anything and followed the recipe to the t.  Really flavorful quick & easy soup.  Oh and one more thing.  Sometimes I add some white american or chedder cheese to this in the bowl when I eat it.  Makes a great cheesy tomato soup!

A terrific and easy recipe!  I followed the recipe regarding ingredients, using tomatoes from the farmers' market and basil from my herb garden.  I read the other reviews before I made the soup, noting that some without an immersion blender ended up wearing the soup.  Since I do not have an immersion blender, the only change I made was stopping after step 1 and refrigerated the unblended soup overnight.  The next day, I used my blender on the chilled soup and continued with step 2.  No soup bath and a deliciously easy recipe!

really good, i added 1/2 tsp of sugar becuase the tomatoes tasted a bit tart.  Also I added a spoonfull of cooked orzo pasta in each bowl!  (this makes it good!)  Also a word to the wise, if blending in a blender, Please do not put the center of the lid on, cover it with a towel instead.  the heat will make the lid pop off and believe me, it is a mess!!!

I made this recipe to help deal with my bounty of fresh tomatoes and basil. It turned out great but I did make quite a few changes. To make the recipe more lo-cal, I used 2 T butter and 2 T olive oil which worked fine to sauté the onions with out any sticking or dryness problems.  Then so many reviewers said that they didn’t like straining out all the solids, so they didn’t strain the soup. I wanted the tomato solids but not the seeds, so I peeled the tomatoes after dropping them in boiling water, then I removed the skins, and then I quartered them and seeded them. To seed the tomatoes, either remove the seeds with a spoon or gently squeeze the quartered tomatoes over the sink to remove the seeds. This takes a bit of time but then no straining is necessary.  I reduced the chicken broth to 1 - 14.5 oz can so as not to dilute the tomato taste too much and I think that worked well. Also I didn’t have any heavy cream, so I used evaporated milk. Evaporated milk has a richer taste than regular milk even if you use evaporated skim milk. I have an immersion blender, so that worked very well, no scalding of myself. The resulting soup was great and my husband who doesn’t like tomato soup, loved it.

Simple and delicious! I've been making this for years and usually make a few "tweaks" (depending on what I have onhand): -----> substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth so my vegetarian friends & family can enjoy it,too! -----> I will usually use up to a full pint (2 cups) of cream or half & half.  ------> occasional/optional additions: more basil ...and/or... 1 cup (or less) finely chopped baby spinach ...and/or... baby carrots, precooked until very soft ...and/or... 2 teaspoons ground nutmeg ...and/or... 2 teaspoons ground ginger ...and/or... 2 teaspoons dried tarragon ............ annnd for my favorite tweak treat: 2-3 cups grated cheddar cheese!! This soup is so good, it's adaptable to what's on hand and forgiving of what's not. My family loves every version I've made!

I made this soup in my slow cooker and served it a potluck! It was gone in an instant! I puree the tomatoes and basil before I heat it up just to lesson the clean up and hassle of pouring hot soup all over the floor!!

Made it in the winter so no fresh tomatoes or basil. Instead used canned crushed tomatoes and a couple of tablespoons of basil pesto and added a couple of cloves of chopped garlic. Also used Better than Bullion chicken broth since I was out of homemade. Even with these not so fresh ingredients, the soup was outstanding! The immersion blender made the soup so smooth there was no need for straining. Served with parmesan-topped crostini and it made a delicious lunch.

Made this last night from fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden. I choose this recipe because all it needed was tomatoes for the base.  I didnt want to have to go buy tomato juice or tomato sauce when my table was covered in fresh tomatoes! It was a great way to use up the surplus.  I used roma tomatoes and got most of the seeds out when cut them (i just halved them because they were small).  Seeds came out easily with a swipe of my finger.  Followed recipe almost exactly, except i made the broth with bullion because that is what i had at home.  Turned out great.  After looking at the other reviews, i tried straining some at the end, and tried it without straining.  I preffered the soup not strained, it had more body to it this way and I wasnt wasting all that tomato goodness.  Since I got most of the seeds out when cutting the tomatoes, there were very few in the final product without straining. Had this soup with BLT's, yummy!  In my second helping i crumbled an extra slice of bacon and threw a bit of shredded cheese on top- very tasty!

YUM!  I used Organic everything.  Though next time I think I will add another tomato or two and scale down a tad on the basil.
The straining is a MUST -- that makes the texture perfect.

Delicious!  The only real change I made (besides approximating the tomatoes and basil a bit, based on what I had on hand) was that I didn't strain it at the end; it didn't seem necessary, and we didn't mind the seeds at all. :)  

Note: Strongly consider investing in an immersion blender!!  I recently acquired one, and, having used the standard blender method for soups in the past, was AMAZED at how much easier and cleaner this was.  If you like making blended soups, you won't regret it!!!

This one was a hit with the whole family! I meant to get this review up earlier. We actually tried it a few weeks ago. What to do with all the tomatoes from our garden? I had already made lots of spaghetti sauce and we'd eaten them in salads, so it was time for something different. This also made use of our garden's fresh basil, which was also plentiful. The result is a soup that is creamy with a delicate blend of the flavors that go into it, most notably the herbs. The batch I made was gone in 2 days. Very good!

Very, very good! I used fresh basil that I grew myself, and it was so worth it. I made it exactly as written and I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this soup for a friend coming for lunch and we both truly enjoyed the flavour. I used a can of tomatoes to cut my time. I pureed the soup, but I didn't stain it so that it would be more heartier. Will make again and again.

I LOVED this soup!  I don't know how I'll ever go back to canned tomato soup.  The only change I made is that I didn't strain the solids at the very end.  Or, rather, I stated to but then couldn't bear to see them leave, so I stirred it all back in and ate it with them.  Perhaps not as elegant a soup that way, but I loved it :)

Oh my goodness is this ever delicious. The recipe is good and I used homegrown just picked tomatoes and basil from my garden and that is what made it outstanding.

Good flavor, although for me, a little too much onion and not enough tomato. However, I skipped the straining step, so maybe that was my fault. The color was pale orange, so garnish is key.

Add some goldfish crackers on top and this is pretty close to the perfect tomato soup! It's a versatile recipe and after making it several times here's the slightly healthier version I settled on: use 2T olive oil and skip the butter, use milk instead of cream, add a bit of celery, add red pepper flakes and sherry, and cut the chicken broth in half. I also skip the peeling and straining steps, and replace half of the tomatoes with a quart of home-canned tomatoes when I have them on hand. Also good with cheesy toast or Yummy Garlic Croutons from this site.

awesome recipe! I had alot of tomatoes and came across this recipe. This is my first time making tomato soup and it puts canned soup to shame.  The only thing i did different was add oregano and  1 orange and yellow pepper. I first roasted the peppers and then peeled the skin off.  Was awesome with toasted italian bread/grilled cheese!

This soup was AMAZING! I always order this soup at restaurants and will drive across town to get it.  I am so happy to know that I only have to drive to the supermarket now ;-) I altered the recipe by using canned tomatoes and I added sugar.  I ended up not using as much butter as the recipe calls for and it still came out delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe I posted it on Facebook too!

I guess my tomatoes had a lot of water in them (garden tomatoes) and I found 1 quart of chicken broth would dilute the soup too much.  So I put in just the chicken broth seasoning (about one teaspoon) and one cup of milk (to replace the cream).  The consistency was perfect and the taste was good, but it's probably richer and better with cream.  Maybe next time I'll add 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup milk.

I skipped the chicken stock and added cayenne pepper for spice.  I froze half of it, so we will see how that comes out. It's very good, and will probably be even better this winter.  A great way to use up tomatoes that may go bad (I think I put about 10 tomatoes in this recipe!).

This soup is amazing!  I used the recipe with the a few additions.  I used approximately 2 tablespoons of cayenne pepper which gives the soup a delicious kick.  I also added 4 tablespoons of orange juice concentrate (in lieu of sugar+lemon juice as previously suggested). I did not strain this soup, as the texture was perfectly creamy after blending the tomatoe/chicken stock/basil mixture. Please try this soup, it is SO EASY and SO DELICIOUS!

I wasn't entirely sure on the first night of this soup that the second degree burns I sustained from pouring hot soup into a blender were worth it. Now, on the second day, with this soup as lunch, i'm re-evaluating. It's pretty good. be sure to thoroughly strain it... all the little seeds sure are annoying when you're trying to have a nice creamy soup. 

All in all, I'll probably make it again.. but not for some time, because I'm going to put the remainder of this in the freezer for the next grilled cheese rainy day.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the result was truly awful.  It amazes me how much tomato went into this recipe for so little tomato taste in the end result.  The chicken broth and butter overpowered the end result, and it was very runny.  It did not taste anything like any other tomato basil soup that I have ever had.  Hopefully my dog will like it.

Very bland, I could barely taste the tomatoes or the basil. It made quite a bit, so I am going to add some. Dried basil and tomato juice in hopes that it will goose up the flavor. I would not recommend this recipe. ??????

Very good! I increased tomatoes to5lbs added 4 cloves of garlic with olive oil and roasted the tomatoes for 20 minutes@325 then continued with the rest of the recipe. It really makes a big difference to roast the tomatoes!

This is my go to with any large quantities of extra tomatoes.   I've been using this recipe for a few years now mostly following it.  A couple changes I've tried. 1. I never strain the tomatoes as I like the texture better

I can't believe how simple this recipe was. We used tomatoes even if they were out of season just to try something new.  It was a hit even with non-tomato soup lovers. I would probably do less broth or more tomatoes (or add corn starch or flour) next time only to make it thicker. But the base recipe is a keeper!

Not tomato-y enough for my taste.  Good, but not great.   Wouldn't make again without some adjustments (more tomatoes, add tomato paste, etc)

I was a little disappointed in this as it seemed a bit watery.   My tomatoes were really juicy, so perhaps that was the reason.  We both thought it needed a little flavor boost too, in spite of using an abundance of  fresh basil.

This was delicious and easy. I made it as instructed. But last minute I decided to throw in come cooked crawfish tails from a recent crawfish boil. It was so yummie!  We even poured some over baked salmon one night and it was even better!

Delicious!  Homemade stock increases flavor and garden tomatoes tops it off! Don't waste your time peeling tomatoes,  by the time it cooks in the stock it's soft enough for blending.

Loved this!  Kept peels on and blended up in vitamaster - that dealt with the peels and seeds for a creamy soup. My husband wanted his without the heavy cream and he enjoyed it just as much as I did with it :)

AWESOME! I'm fussy about tomato soup and this recipe passed with flying colors! The only change was...I used 3 tsp. of dried Basil Flakes instead of fresh Basil, which I didn't have on hand. This soup was to die for!!!

My kids really liked this soup. I would say that you should NOT add salt. The chicken broth made it salty enough on its own. I tried the soup as the recipe said but it wasn't quite to my liking so I added a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of garlic powder. Also, I added half of a block of cream cheese and that made it much richer. I served it at a Christmas luncheon and got a lot of compliments. Make sure you don't forget to put the tomatoes and onions in the blender, though. That step's a must!

In the interest of eating healthier, I cut the oil and butter in half and it worked fine.  I read the reviews about it being to watery so I just let my tomatoes cook without a lid for awhile and it was fine.  I'm sure how much water you have depends on the type of tomatoes you use.  I used fresh out of the garden along with fresh parsley and basil and it was very good!

Ok with the basil. Absolutely amazing without basil. I used green onion instead in subsequent batches because we don't like basil here. Seriously it's super yummy.

Love this recipe!  Added some minced garlic after sautéing the onion as well as a tsp. of lemon juice and balsamic vinegar per the advice of another member.  I doubled the recipe for a big group using 5 14 oz. hunts diced tomatoes and one 28 oz. crushed tomatoes (tomatoes not in season-ones in the grocery store from another country)a couple of tbs. of tomato paste to make it my own. I also used less butter and oil because I just didn't need that much to sauté the onion and garlic.  served with grill cheese sandwiches!  Excellent

I loved this soup, as did my husband.  The only thing I did differently was omit the cream and add a cup or so of uncooked rotini. I also did not strain it, which leaves a bit of pulp which we prefer. It is definitely better using fresh basil, but I have also made it with dried and it was (almost) just as good.

Just made this recipe today. I followed some of the other suggestions and added garlic to the onion cooking process, and also added some spices of my own.

After the first blending process I added 1 can (156ml) of herb & garlic tomato paste, as well as some cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes and some cinnamon (all to taste, depends how much heat you like!).. to make sure there weren't any big chunks of the red pepper flakes I did blend it a little more.

I think adding the additional spices brought this soup to another level. It was good on it's own, but the flavour has more depth after the things I added... I plan to top my bowl off with some grated cheddar cheese.. will definitely make this again with the above modifications. Enjoy!!

Loved the recipe. Very simple.  Used a quart of tomato sauce made from fresh tomatoes inwhich the volume had been reduced by 1/3 with cooking. First time I have been able to get the consistency of commercial brands. I don't bother to skin the tomatoes or filter the seeds out but puree per recipe.

I veganized this with the broth, butter (Earth Balance), and cream (soy milk), and it came out delicious.  I made this to my visiting brother, who's heavily addicted to junk food, so I wanted for him to get some healthy, tasty meals in between.  He kept raving over it and was asking for more the next day!

I added 2 teaspoons of baking soda, which cuts the acid in tomatoes better than sugar would have. Also, I used 2 large Mason jars of home canned tomatoes with nothing added.

Excellent soup, actually doubled the recipe due to over abundance of garden tomatoes. I did add some hot sauce to cut down on sweetness. Thank you for sharing!

I've made this Creamy Tomato Basil Soup five times in a large pot with 24 servings.  Everyone loves it and keeps asking for it because its so delicious.

My wife is the real cook in the family and she tried to tweak this recipe a couple of times, while I wasn't looking. I wasn't too happy about that.  

Why mess with perfection.

I loved this recipe. I added only a cup of broth and doubled the basil. After pouring it through a strainer, I took the pulp and blended it until very smooth then added it. I liked the thickness it added.

I am a big time tomato soup fan, however I've never made it from scratch before. I already had fresh plum tomatoes blanched & pureed so I thought I'd do something different with them. I stuck to the recipe but I only used 1/2 of a large onion, & 2 Tbsp each of butter & olive oil. I also decided to substitute the heavy cream for fat free half & half. I garnished it with croutons and it was wonderful! In the end, I wouldn't have done anything different. Thank you Alok for this super delicious recipe!

This was good but I tweaked it a bit for more flavor. I added 3 stalks chopped celery with the onion, I also added 4 cloves garlic, I used a can of chicken stock, not a quart and it was so creamy after the blender I hardly used any cream at all! Will make again!

This was not very good... I'm not sure what other people found so appealing about it, unless of course, they did not make the actual recipe and instead made a ton of changes and then gave their own recipe 5 stars! The flavor was ok, but it was so thin and watery, and too much basil for my husband's tatses. If you're going to go ahead and make it, use way less broth and maybe some extra tomatoes perhaps

Delicious. Used fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden. Took the seeds out and plunged them into hot water to get the skin off quickly. Added two crushed garlic cloves after adding the tomatoes and two pours of white wine. Blended in a blender and did not strain. The consistency was perfect without straining. Great easy recipe with few ingredients and a great way to use extra garden tomatoes.

Used canned whole tomatos, added garlic, didn't have fresh basil so used dried basil, added spinach at the end for texture before pureeing. Fabulous for my sick hubby!

I made this soup yesterday and it was delicious!  My husband who won't usually touch a vegetable loved it and had two helpings.  It says to strain the soup but we like it chunky so we did not and it was SO good.

Great recipe!  I use whatever is on hand...if I need to add canned tomatoes, that is what goes in the pot. I also don't strain it and usually guess on quantities, adding more basil to taste, etc. Very close to my favorite restaurant's soup.

I didnt have a lot of the stuff this recipe needed, and guesstimated a lot, and it turned out incredibly!!! I used 5 tomatoes, cored but not peeled and 1 can stewed tomatoes, mostly drained. I didnt have fresh basil so just poured in a bunch of dried. Put in some minced garlic, garlic and onion powder in with the onions. Added some hot chili steak spice(it gave it a little kick), used an immersion blender  and started to strain, but my mom was eating the stuff I strained out, so I thought if its that good leave it in. My mom and dad ate almost the whole pot for dinner. I got one bowl. Guess I better make it again soon!

Absolutely delicious! I did not peel the tomatoes instead I cut them in quarters and added a small can of tomato sauce for color. I also chose not to strain the soup, giving more texture on the palate.

This was amazing. I am on a total soup kick and was spending a lot at the store to buy tomato basil soup that wasn't as good as this one! I would definitely reccomend straining it at the end; otherwise it's too grainy. Fabulous!!

I love this soup!  My grandmother doesnt really like tomato soup, but even she thought this was good.  I dont like blending hot liquids, so I puree the tomato and basil first and then cook as directed, then at the end, I strain it through a sieve.  I also use half and half rather than heavy cream just because thats what I always have on hand.

Soup was delicious. Served with grilled ham and cheese for a light summer dinner. Made a few changes: I added 2 cloves of garlic with the onion, only used 28 oz. broth and halved the basil.

Wow, on a cold day this soup sure hits the spot. It may be good with a little bit more cream but either way, it is perfect to dip a nice pice of bread into and also great with pieces of crackers in it.

I didn't have enough tomatoes, and I added a jar of Classico Tomato Basil spaghetti sauce.  
This soup has a wonderful flavor!!  The fresh dill might be the key!!
