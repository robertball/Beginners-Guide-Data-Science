Changed a few things. I let the meat marinate in the honey sauce [ which I changed to a small can of  chipotle adobe ( included seeds), 1/4 honey, 1/4 olive oil] for an hour. Coated the pan with butter and then season lightly with Pappies seasoning salt. Also did two peaches so there were extra when serving. Uploaded the photo. Enjoy :)

I made this. I am new to cooking. I used a donut peach that I diced. I didn't have chipotle and I don't like using canned food anyway so I diced a hot red pepper not sure what it was but it looks like jalape√±o. I put this in a glass 9x13 pan with Yukon potatoes carrots tomatoes and onions on its sides. The result was juicy, tender, and tasty. It was late when I made it and I wasn't that hungry. I cut one of the tenderloins and left the other intact. My mom made tenderloin all the time and I see why because it was easy to make and quick, could of been quicker but I like to take my time when cooking.

I made this for my family last night for dinner.  I followed the directions as is, except (1) this New Mexico gal did not have any chipotle chiles in adobo sauce!  I used 1 TBS of ground dried chipotle instead. And (2) I marinated the tenderloin in the honey sauce for 3 hours before baking it. I thought the sauce was intriguing and was anxious for it to really flavor the entire roast.  It did and it was delicious!  As stated in the recipe, this roast was very tender and very flavorful.  I used one fresh peach, sliced, but next time will use two, as the peaches added such a nice flavor. 
My family loved this dish. It will be one of my two go-to pork tenderloin recipes from now on.
Next time I will add that second peach and again marinate the roast for at least 3 hours.  I'm also going to try sprinkling chopped fresh cilantro over the finished roast, as it goes well with our red and green chiles.

Hubby and I loved it! Served it with a side of roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. We are going to try the same marinade with chicken breasts next time. Always love a good punch of flavor.  And this really has it!

Delicious!!! When I played the pork to test, I put the liquid in a sauce pan and reduced it to a glaze. It was great drizzled on the pork before serving.

I made this for a group of friends and it was a hit. We ended up using pork steaks instead of tenderloin. I doubled the recipe and added even more of the peppers as my group enjoys spicy things! We grilled the meat, so I wrapped them in foil packets and it was delicious. The only suggestion that comes to mind would be to marinate the meat beforehand. The flavor was good, but not very strong when just poured on. I will definitely make this again!

this was amazing.  Be careful not to overdo the adobo.  I emptied a partial can and might have doubled it.  It got pretty hot.

I did double the peaches and do reccomend that.
