This was a great recipe, it was easy to make and everyone raved about it.  I was asked for the recipe many times. Made it the night before my party and baked it before serving and it worked out great.  Would make it again.

This dip was a huge hit at wine night.  So unhealthy, but so hard to stop eating. Everyone wanted to know what was in it.  It makes a ton.  You might want to cut the recipe in half.

This recipe has too many ingrediants...sometimes less is more.  I make a version that consists of one can Rotel (tomatoes and chilies), one block cream cheese, one package frozen spinach, one lb. velveeta, and 6-8 strips of crumbled bacon.  Cut up and put in microwave until melted....It is always the first appetizer finished at every party.

I would not make this again.  The taco seasoning makes it too salty and kind of a unappealing orange color.  I think that it would be better with just some cumin.  I did not drain the canned tomatoes, and probably should have, as it was a bit watery.

It was good, but probably wasn't my first pick.

A great dip, for something different.  I made a half batch and baked it in a pie pan.  I did use fresh spinach, that I steamed, drained, and wrung out the liquid in place of the frozen spinach.  Served this with tortilla chips and it was enjoyed by all.
