Easy and delicious! How can you go wrong with "pizza" for breakfast?  I added sauteed red and green peppers along with some onion in a little garlic to get in some veggies. I subbed light shredded Cheddar cheese as I didn't have any Mozzarella on hand and since my husband is a big fan of bacon I added some cooked and crumbled. This is a great base  for add-in's like veggies, ham, sausage, or bacon - no matter what it's gonna be delicious. Overall, very tasty and a great way to start the day.  Perfect with a side of fresh fruit and OJ! Thanks for a great recipe wramirez1209!

When I made this pizza, I chose to use homemade home fries instead of frozen hashbrown potatoes. This is to prevent any soggy texture on the pizza and to not only get the hashbrowns nice and brown, but to also cook them in bacon grease to add more flavor. I also added half a pound of cooked crisp, crumbled bacon. Good quick and easy breakfast. My husband and kids inhaled the whole thing. Next time, I would double the recipe to use two cans of crescent rolls and use a different cheese.

I used swiss instead of mozzarella and hash browns which had onion and peppers.  This recipe is a good base for all kinds of variations.  You could add different types of veggies, pieces of ham, bacon, sausage, or maybe take it the Mexican route with some salsa, jalape√±os, chorizo, and sour cream.  The crescent roll produces a tasty and tender crust which can be eaten just like pizza...with your hands!  Today I served with turkey sausage patties, fresh fruit, and OJ.

I actually made this for dinner..I made it a 9x13 pan. I fried some sausage, mushrooms and onions,  and then browned the hashbrowns. So it was a loaded pizza..yummy

It was okay, but I should have used two cans of crescent rolls to make the crust thicker, since just one made it too thin to pick up. I also added ketchup as a topping after cooking due to personal preference.

My daughter and I liked it. The crust was a little thick for our taste, so next time I won't use it with Pillsbury thin pizza crust instead of biscuit dough. Otherwise it was great! We added salsa on top after tasting. Thank you for the recipe idea!
