I make these cookies every Christmas & someone always asks for the recipe. In lieu of white choc you can use colored chocolate discs or semi-sweet chocolate for a variety. Delicious

I changed the recipe to tailor more to traditional rice crispy treats.  I used the same amount of peanuts and white chocolate (which I colored green for St. Patrick's Day) but increased the peanut butter to 1.5 cups, marshmallows to 2.5 cups and rice crispies to about 5 cups.  I put the mixture into a large pan to harden and they turned out great!

I've made this but have used less marshmallows and added even mini m&m's and coconut.  For the holidays, I've even added color sprinkles to them just before putting the balls in the fridge to set.

this is good, but mostly a good place to start. i thought it was too much chocolate (and i'm a choc-o-holic) and not enough crispies. the nice thing is, you can vary alot according to taste. next time i think i might actually break up some pretzles and put them in. i also followed the suggestion of others and poured it all into a pan; it took a while to firm, so i put that in the fridge, and then they were a pain to cut into bars! next time, if there is one, i think i will drop them by spoonful.

I made these for my grown sons and they ate all of them in one day.  They said they would have given this one 10 stars!  Absolutely addictive!  Thank you for this great treat!

Great recipe, found it through doing a 'gluten free' search. although i must warn any folks with a gluten allergy out there that most puffed rice cereals contain malt/malt extract and so they're  NOT gluten free. Guess the rule is to be careful with all ingredients.

We didn't love this.  It basically tasted like I put a bunch of things I like in a bowl and then squashed them together and ate them.  It didn't blend very well and was just not as good as making classic rice crispy treats.

I brought some of these to my husband's office and they disappeared in about 5 minutes. He loves them (as did everyone who tried them). I made them in a pan to cut into bars. I did add mini choc chips too. I may melt the marshmallows with the white chocolate next time to give it the more gooey texture. I HAD to freeze 1/2 of the pan. We were eating too many!! (although you can eat them right from the freezer I found out!) Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recently for Christmas & it was a hit.  Very easy to make.  Instead of dropping it onto wax paper, I did as another reviewer suggested & poured the whole mixture into a pan (as w/ regular rice krispies).  I then let it sit & cut it into 1 inch squares.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks.

I found this recipe here two years ago while looking for no-bake holiday goodies.  It is wonderful!  Everyone loves them.  I even won our family/friend cookie swap bake-off with these this year.  the only thing I changed was the name, I call them snow balls.  It sound more festive.

This is so yummy and is the easiest candy to make. My girls enjoyed mixing them up and dropping onto wax paper. They were very excited to find out they don't take long at all to set and they could enjoy them almost right away.

Wow - was this easy and quite a BIG hit.  My 4 year old helped me make it and the results were terrific.  I usually am not a big marshmallow fan, but these are delicious.  I made them for neighbors for Christmas and have to make another batch because my crew loved them so much!  THANK YOU!

So easy and soooo good!  I was short on time, so I decided to make this quick treat for a chairty dessert raffle at work.  They were so simple to make and looked fantastic in cellophane treat bags.  The creamy combination of peanut butter and white chocolate is addictive, but the crispy cereal, salty peanuts, and chewy marshmallows put them over the top.  These little candies are definitely going to make an appearance on my holiday cookie trays.

Excellent Recipe! I was looking for something similar to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory's "Avalanche Bars". THIS IS IT! I left the peanuts out and it is dang close. My whole family loves these and have already told me to add it to the "favorites" list.

I have had a similar recipe for years and love it.  The only difference is that instead of mixing the peanut butter into the dry ingredients I stir it into the melted white chocolate.  I use mini petit four cups and they're almost too small, but I get at least 7 dozen, probably more.  These make a great holiday gift for teachers, gift exchange, or homemade item for a raffle or auction!

Thank you Patty for this recipie!! During college I worked for a caterer and she used to serve these cookies. They are amazing to say the least. These cookies/candies freeze great too. Just pull them out and let them sit at room temp for a bit before serving.

This is a quick and easy candy that should cure even the most raging sweet tooth! WOW! These are so sweet! I melted white chocolate chips and for variation I did a batch with raisins in them. I, too, dropped by half teaspoons into little foil candy cups for ease of serving and eating. Thanks Patty.

Mmm! I didn't use the marshmallows (due to an allergy in the party), but I used some more peanuts and peanut butter. Great recipe...everyone loved it. Put them in the fridge to speed up the setting process, and make sure to keep a close eye on the white chocolate so it doesn't burn.

I had eaten this fabulous candy at a friend's Christmas party and couldn't wait to find a recipe so I could make it myself.  This recipe is perfect!  I've taken it to work, to meetings, picnics and everyone loves it, in fact, they now ask me to bring it.  It is easy and addicting, so watch out when you make it - you won't be able to stop yourself from eating more than you should ;)

Really good.  I used white almond bark in place of the white chocolate.  Turned out great.  I'm adding pretzels to the mix next time -- I think it will make a great addition.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it! To make it easier for displaying and serving, I spooned individual servings into silver foil cupcake liners. Very quick and simple to make as well as easy to scale down the recipe if needed.

I made these for a Christmas party and literally everyone loved them.  I was the only person who went home with no leftovers; everyone wanted to take some home for their families.  These are so delicious!

My family loved this recipe.  I made these twice over the weekend.  Once for my family and once for a work picnic. Very easy to make.  I dropped them into miniature cupcake papers and they look like a fancy candy from a candy store.

Very good and very easy!  Everyone loved them. The recipe did not yield 7 dozen, only 3.  I will definitely make them again.

No one will know you only spent minutes making these candies. I've used this recipe for years, using white chocolate stars. A friend uses Christmas Rice Krispies, and another uses Cap'n Crunch. Either works well.

When a lady had my baby shower for me in 1983, she made these cookies for it.  Her recipe reads the same except that you add 2 cups of Captain Crunch peanut butter cereal and you melt the almond bark and stir in everything else.  Yummy!

Salty, sweet, smooth, chewy and crunchy all at once.  This is a sweet treat on many levels.  It is easy to vary ingredients according to mood and taste.  I suggest making as it calls for first, then adding and substituting according to your taste.  I have made this many times and with several ingredients added.  Although, I did not like the chocolate versions I made.  Even the consistency was too soft, and the bitter of the chocolate did not harmonize with the other ingredients.

Very good!  I didnt use marshmallows, and I added raisons, I also had some chocolate almond bark on hand, so I used that instead of white chocolate.  I was very pleased with the results.  Thanks so much for sharing...

I thought this recipe was excellant, but I did not use the peanuts.  I have already made it several times, and have tried a few twists like using mini hershey kisses instead of white chocolate.  I even left out the peanut butter in a few batches and used cinnimon or butterscotch chips.  It was a big hit..

Very fun, good recipe. I used half white choc and half almond bark to equal about one lb. I think 2 lbs would be too much.

I know this recipe as "Peanut Butter Meltaways" but the quantities differ slightly. My recipe uses the same amount of each ingredient except for my recipe calls for 1 lb. white chocolate (1/2 of this recipe's chocolate). I think this ratio makes the spoonfuls more manageable and the whole concoction not as terribly sweet as many reviewers mention. This has always been a unique treat to share with family and friends. I am a little tempted by the reviewer who added peanut butter captain crunch, one of my favorite guilty pleasures.

This isn't bad, but I wouldn't rave about it like a lot of people have.  I followed all the directions except I used cashews instead of peanuts.  To me this is WAY too sweet.  I made this for a snack for me and my son but I think a lot of it will go to waste seeing you can only eat a small amount at a time.  This might be a good thing to make for a party, but not for a small family at home.  I can't decide if I'll make this again but if I do I will cut the recipe in half.

This was a great recipe, and even FUN to make!  You don't have to measure the ingredients perfectly and it all comes together with a little work of the hands.  I made a big batch for a dinner party and everyone loved it!

We didn't use the marshmallows, but these were still very tasty without them.  Matter of fact, I think they might have been better this way.  I will definitely make these again.  They are very easily to make with children or teenagers.  Yum!

This candy is delicious!  I made this for Christmas and it was a huge hit.  The only thing I did slightly different was to add the peanut butter to the white chocolate before I melted it so it was incorporated into the chocolate.  There is no peanut butter swirl in the candy but it stirred together great and easy.  This is a must every Christmas now.

These are amazing! The only things I did differently than the recipe was that I used more rice krispies than what they called for (atleast a cup more), and instead of dropping them by spoonfulls, I poured it into a pan with wax paper, and after the had set, I but them into little squares. Everyone raved over them, and I will definitely make these again. Next time I might use just "normal" peanuts instead of dry-roasted.

Very good, addictive...  It's hard to make them as small as the recipe calls for, though.  When I made them, it yielded about 5 dozen and took several hours for them to fully set.

Yummy, but is a little much w/2lbs. of wh.choc. Also, not sure, if I like the marshmallows, that much. I have sampled a similar recipe from an acquaintance; it had Captain Crunch peanut butter cereal & little stick pretzels in it, along with this recipe's other ingredients, except no marshmallows.
Oh, that person poured her's onto waxed paper or in a pan w/waxed paper, & when solid, would break into sections. To LSHEPLY, in a review from 'ellisa', she said most puffed rice contains malt/malt extract, which is NOT gluten free. Thought you'd like to know.

I thought this was great!  It does have a lot of white chocolate, but that's fine with me.  It would be perfect to take to a gathering.

very tasty and easy to make. It was a bit too much white chocolate for my case, I think next time I will cut it down to 24 oz. I used melted white choc. chips for ease. Very versatile recipe - can swap out lots of good ingredients to your liking.

Easy and good, this recipe is both. Thanks a ton, plan on taking these little babies to a 4th of July party. I think I will add a bit more marshmellows this next time. Can't get enough... it is just a me thing!

These were awesome.  The only change I made was making them like rice crispy treats instead of spooning it onto wax paper.  I will definitely make again.

These are awesome and so easy to make! However, I must have made mine too big cause I only got 4 dozen out of the recipe instead of 7.

I made this is the recipe called for. It made so much! There's enough to take to a gathering, munch on it while you're making it, and the kids get some too. Thank goodness it makes so much because you  can't eat just one!

I made no changes at all, except for using creamy peanut butter instead. It's amazing! I really love it. I made it for my College Prep English class for Halloween. My fellow students will love it I'm sure. ;) The creator of this is a genius!

Really simple recipe. I didn't read just how much chocolate I needed so instead of thickly coating the mix I only lightly coated the mix. But still yummy

This was so good, especially if your a sweet and salty kind of person. A snap to make, I like to experiment with the ratio of ingredients as well. If you want to make it slightly more healthy, you can add another cup or so of the rice cereal and I find it works out fine.

My grandma use to make these and I make them every year for Christmas.  I use almond bark and pour into a pan versus dropping as cookies.  One of our family favorites!!!
