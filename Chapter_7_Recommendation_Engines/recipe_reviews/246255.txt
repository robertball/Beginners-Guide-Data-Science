I made this for a Happy Hour appetizer and it was a big hit.  I didn't make any changes.  I had some left over, so the next day I added a little more mayo, sour cream, and mustard, stirred it up and microwaved it and it was as good as the night before.

I made this with some leftover corned beef from St.  Patrick's Day used swiss cheese, but other than those 2 minor changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  This is delicious!  I served it with crackers.

My husband LOVES this dip. I'm about to make it a second time for my in-laws by doubling up the recipe. It's definitely our new favorite dip. Try It! You won't be disappointed!

Made exactly as described, yet refrigerated it for a few hours before the game, tossed in the oven for 30 minutes, most excellent!

I halved the recipe (I am the only one in my family that is a fan of Reuben sandwiches) and loved the overall taste, but it was a bit too salty for me.  Next time I will add more sauerkraut and reduce amount of meat.

I made it just like recipe using pastrami. I didn’t enjoy it because it’s not the splash of flavor the sandwich has.

This is an awesome dish to make.  Everyone always loves it.  Even my mother in law who is a vegetarian loved this dish and is having me make it again for their visit this weekend XD

Made 1/2 batch and used canned corn beef and all regular Swiss cheese.  Didn't change anything else.  Was looking forward to trying but thought it just OK.  Served with rye toast, celery sticks, and scoop Fritos.  Won't be making again.
