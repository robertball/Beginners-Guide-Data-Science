I have made this several times and with a little tweaking it is a family favorite. Using the advice of previous reviewers, I used italian sausage and ground beef and added about 3/4 cup of water.  I did not add the tomato soup, either.  I found wagon wheel shaped pasta and used it since it resembles a sliced pizza.  I also under cook the pasta, because it will soak up a lot of moisture and turn mushy.  You may need to add a little extra water after this has been cooking for a few hours, too.  This is a keeper!

This is yummy.  After reading other reviews I made a few changes as follows:  I used a bottle of spaghetti sauce as opposed to two little bottles of pizza sauce.  I then mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering.  The mixture definitely needs spices, and I added quite a bit (a few teaspoons) of chopped garlic, as well as some basil and S&P.  It got dry and I added a bit of water.  Next time I will sautee some onions as i'm browning the ground beef and add it to the mix, as well as add a can or two of mushrooms (or fresh).  I used turkey pepperoni and there is none of that pepperoni grease.  I will probably use smaller noodles than rigatoni.

This recipe is touted as a "slow cooker" recipe but really I don't think it is.  Next time I'll mix it all up in one bowl and probably microwave it for about 15-20 minutes (covered).  That way it won't get dry and all the cheese will be mega-melted.  Even putting it in a casserole dish and putting it in the oven at around 350 for about an hour and a half would work.

Bottom line, the mixture is delicious and hearty.  Can't really go wrong if feeding teenagers and probably would be a big hit at a pot-luck, too.  Enjoy!

I recommend frying the pepperoni first, then draining the grease from it. Just drain the pepperoni on paper towels. You are left with crispy pepperoni that doesn't add any grease to the recipe.

This recipe gets five stars all across! It's even fast as far as being a slow cooker recipe, as it only takes 4 hours on low. I followed the recipe exactly,(make sure you cook the ground beef before you place it in your cooker) and then I went out for four hours. When I got home, it looked delicious! And it was!! It was the best!! Much better than Baked Ziti or some of those other pasta dishes. My kids had thirds, and my sister came over and raved about it. I really enjoyed it, and this will be brought to many pot lucks and barbeques. THANKS, JILL!!

This was okay--I guess because of all the rave reviews, I thought it would be outstanding and was a little disappointed.  Be sure you are using a LARGE slow cooker--I have a small one and couldn't quite fit all the ingredients in.  I found the layering to be a little fiddly, like making a lasgna.  The whole point of using a slow cooker is to throw in the ingredients and walk away for a few hours...no throwing here.  Hubby liked the taste but the kids weren't overly thrilled.  And it looked like a dog's breakfast.  Won't try this one again.

I made this for the office and everybody LOVED IT! I have made it several times since then for my own family but I made sure to add green peppers, olives, onions, sausage. All these things made it truly unbelievable.

My ultra-picky husband really liked this dish, and I liked the simplicity! I think next time I'll try it with bulk sausage instead of ground beef, and I'll skip the pepperoni (I tried it with turkey pepperoni - good, but I'm not a huge pepperoni fan). Also, do not let this dish go past 4 hours, or it will start to burn!

This worked out pretty well. Mine didn't turn out greasy but it was a little dry, but that was easily cured with a little water. I did brown my hamburger with onions and I used my own pizza sauce. I also halved the recipe since some of the previous reviews said that it makes alot. They were right. I had plenty at half the recipe. I think that next time I'll add green peppers and other pizza toppings, this is a recipe that is easily personalizes. I think I'd like smaller pasta than rigatoni too. Frankly, I think just about any pasta that you have on hand would work beautifully. I think this is a keeper!

We liked it! This recipe was simlple and super-tasty. It's basically a pizza casserole and it tastes and smells just like pizza. I prepared the rigatoni separately and served the casserole over it for my fiance who is NOT on a low-carb diet. No rigatoni for me and it was great!

I made this yesterday with a few changes.  I used penne pasta that I cooked for half the time called for on the box.  The only meat I used was sweet Italian sausage and about 2 ounces of pepperoni.  A jar and a half of spaghetti sauce with 2 cups of water.  I layered the sauce, 1/2 noodles, sausage, pepperoni (single layer only), sauce and cheese.  Then I reapeated the layers ending with the cheese.  My children loved this and asked for seconds.  An easy, hearty meal for a cold winters eve.

SOOO GOOD! And so easy. I did a few changes. I used cheddar cheese (i think any cheese would do), I browned the beef with onion, garlic, S&P. I mixed the soup and sauce with the beef. I cooked mine in the oven at 375 for 30mins. I layered like this: 1/2 the noodles, 1/2 the sauce/meat, 1/2 the cheese, repeat. It was so hearty, my husband said it was the best pizza casserole ever!!And it actually tasted like pizza!

This is good but I added 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves garlic minced and browned them after the meat. Very good

I used ground turkey and because I did not have cream of tomato soup, I did use additional pizza sauce. I did add some homemade pizza seasoning to give this casserole a little oomph. This was very simple to assemble and the boys inhaled it. I'm glad I added some extra seasoning because it would have been bland without it. I will make this again but I think I'll make it a supreme pizza casserole by adding vegetables.

Just ok for us. Not a lot of flavor. I thought it would be a hit with my son since he loves pizza but he hardly touched this. We ended up with lots of leftovers and they weren't very good the next day.

My family loved this! I was a little skeptical at first, but it was delicious! I made it exactly by the recipe, and it turned out great! It made a big pot, and my husband asked to have it again the following day! My eleven year old said "It tastes JUST LIKE pizza!" I will definitely be making this again and again! Thanks!

I read many reviews first before trying.  Nobody mentioned if the noddles got soggy. I decided not to add the noodles to the crockpot and just made the sauce. So I threw cooked ground beef with cut up pepperoni (cooked together), 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, 1 cup water, chopped onion, chopped garlic, fresh basil, oregano, and a bay leaf and let it cook on low for 8 hours.  When I got hom from work I cooked up some noodles - takes 8 - 10 minutes.  Dinner was ready with a nice sauce!  Cheese was added at the table.

Perfect recipe for a young family.  My toddlers were able to help assemble it and the taste was great!  We'll be making this kid-friendly meal a lot in the future!    Be sure to only partially cook the pasta in order to keep the noodles firm.  I also used tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and added dried onions to the ground beef.

This stuff is GOOD! I am all about the ease of preparation. I used sausage instead of beef, spaghetti sauce instead of pizza, and no soup- changes I made only to suit what I had on hand. I was full by the time it finished, because I took a bite every time I stirred it. Will make this again. (Side note: I doubled the recipe and it barely fit in the crock pot. I couldn't even put the lid on.)

I took the advice of some of the reviewers and baked it in a casserole dish for about an hour.  My slow cooker and I don't get along very well.  Make sure to stop boiling the pasta about 2-3 minutes before they are done so they don't get mushy while in the oven.

Made this for dinner yesterday. Used other reviewers idea of useing tomato sauce in place of tomato soup, added a 4-oz. of sliced black olives (drained) and a small red bell pepper sliced thin. Cooked on low for 3.5 hours and on high for the last half hour. Came out perfect. Wife said it goes on the "A" list. Want's me to make it for her card club.

SO GOOD!!!  Here's how I made this healthy (and my husband was none the wiser):  Used Boca crumbles instead of ground beef; used half low fat mozzarella and have soy mozzarella; used low sodium tomato soup; used 1 jar pizza sauce and 1 jar spaghetti sauce; and used turkey pepperoni instead of full fat.  Turkey pepperoni is excellent.  I didn't cook the pasta with the rest of the ingredients as I was afraid it would get mushy.  I'll definitely make this again!

This meal was easy to prepare and delicious! My girlfriend loves pizza and I thought this would be a home run and I was correct! I read the reviews so I altered the recipe a little. I added 1 medium sweet onion chopped, 1 teaspoon of rosemary, garlic salt, onion salt, salt and pepper to the meat mixture while cooking and then after draining the grease I added another teaspoon of everything but the rosemary. I mixed the tomato soup and pizza sauce together and added another teaspoon of the spices (not the salt of pepper) to that and mixed it in. Definitely needed the spices. I used mini turkey pepperoni to eliminate the grease and diced ham for toppings! This recipe is a do again! I did alter the servings and made 8 servings, honestly that is enough to feed a family of 4 twice at least, so there are plenty of leftovers for this 2 family home!

Good, and easy.  I didn't bother boiling the pasta first but added it in with everything else.  I did, however, add in some water to help it cook the pasta.  I mixed everything together and added salami instead of ground beef.  Topped with cheese, put it on low, and let it get to work.  In four hours, perfect pasta.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really liked this.  I opted to use more sauce instead of the soup and I added black olives.  I put in a baking dish and baked at 350 for about 30-45 minutes.  It came out really good!

Big hit with the men in my home.  They love anything that tastes like pizza.  Had everything ready that morning and had DH turn it on around 1.  Turned out fine.

This was a hit with my family.  I did tweak it a little by adding some spices, and next time I will cook peppers and onions with the ground beef.  I followed the advice of TABIJO's review and mixed it all together and cooked it in the microwave for 15 minutes.  It stayed very moist and was quick and easy.

I really did not like this at all.  Although I must add that my husband did.  It tasted as if it was missing something.  I should have added some spices per others reviews.  Also, the noodles were way over cooked and mushy after a little less than 4 hours.  This is more of an oven type recipe.  I probably would not make it again.

While I did make this in the slow cooker, I have to agree with another commenter that this could easily be made in the oven (but who wants to heat up the whole house in August?).  I browned italian sausage and pepperoni and drained the grease before mixing it in with the rest of the ingredients.  I cooked it for about 2.5 hours.  Total yum.  I will definitely make this in the oven this winter - I imagine a layer of bubbly, brown cheese on top would taste fantastic.

This is one of my new favorite dinners!  I used a jar of my favorite spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce and stirred it in with the beef.  After reading other reviews, I followed their advice and poured 1/2 the pasta in, then a layer of the meat/sauce mixture, then a layer of pepperoni, then a layer of cheese and repeated this.  YUMMY!  Thanks!

This is a great family recipe.  I would definitely NOT cook the pasta, and add more sauce, as my pasta was mushy by the time it was done.  I omitted the canned soup and used one large bottle of prepared spaghetti sauce and didn't layer.  I also used ground chuck and pepperoni and had no issues with grease.  In addition, I added one large tablespoon of chopped garlic and one large tablespoon of dehydrated onions, and could have used even more.  It was, as noted before, quite spicy, so cutting down on the pepperoni would be a good tip- wish I would have read it before I made it.  I would definitely make this again, as it was really yummy.

I've made this several times. I always use spaghetti sauce and I only cook the pasta about halfway. Mix the sauce and pasta together, put half in the slowcooker. Sprinkle your favorite pizza toppings over, add a layer of cheese and repeat. I take this to wrestling tournaments and the boys practically lick the pot clean. I've used all sorts of pasta, shells, elbows, rigatoni, rotini (my favorite)  and I add LOTS of garlic, oregano and basil. 4 stars because I tweaked.

Let me start off by saying I really do like this recipe. This is my second time making this but first time leaving a comment. I made alterations to the recipe both times but followed the recipe a bit more closely this time. First; I had to double the recipe (my younger brothers could eat a horse). Second; I used spicy sausage instead of ground beef but only used 2 lbs. instead of 3 so I could add more veggies into it. Now, the first time I made this I used penne pasta (I had every ingredient in my kitchen but that was the only pasta). The 2nd time I made this I used rigatoni. The problem with the pasta being overcooked came into play. So I recommend not using rigatoni for this. Also, this cooks really fast. 4 hours on low is too long. The first time I made this it started to burn around the 3 1/2 hour mark. This time I left in for just 3 hours and it was perfect (aside from the overcooked pasta). I will definitely keep making this.

What I'd like to have is my money back for the ingredients.  It smelled divine.  Just went to serve it up and it was MUSH, so much so it cant be served as the pasta cant even be picked up by a fork.  I took advice of many reviews and added a little liquid after assembly.  Big mistake.  If I ever risk it again, there will be considerable adjustments.  The idea is great, but I should have gone with the review of preparing separate from the pasta.

I strayed from the recipe so had to rework it. It called for tomato soup which I didnt have.  I used spaghetti sauce, because I had more of it.  I did mix the sauce with the noodles and then layer. Normally I would have just mixed it all together but I wanted to try to actually follow the recipe a little.  So the meat layers didnt really have much sauce. (I used hamburger, italian sausage style turkey, and some pepperoni that I pre cooked so I could drain the grease) So the meat was a good flavor (I cooked it with onions) but not much sauce. I just wasnt that impressed with it and since no one was home, I had a big crock pot full. So last night, I went ahead and added the pizza sauce and mixed it all up. I added a little extra cheese to the top also. Sooooo much better. And it did have a nice pizza flavor without just a whole lot of fuss. It could just as easily been cooked on the stove or thrown in the oven. Pretty versatile in that respect.  I will keep it in the rotation. All flavors that the kids love and using the italian turkey helped with some of the calories. Might try it with ground turkey next time. I think the pasta was wheat or that smart pasta.  And I used Penne Rigata.  I am sorry that I didnt follow it more closely the first time but I am glad that I gave it another shot because it was a nice little recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good and easy, but a little on the greasy side from the peperoni. Next time I'll try some turkey sausage cut up instead of peperoni.

My family loves this I would have given 5 stars if I had followed the recipe exactly which I do not.  I use 1 lb of Italian sausage instead of gr beef just as a personal preference.  I use 16 of rigatoni and 2 cans of tomato soup instead of one.  I do not increase the amount of meat or sauce even though I use double the pasta.  My husband who usually frowns on casserole type dishes loves this and requests it often as do our four children.  It's really tasty and the noodles are not mushy.

This was a good kids meal.  I made it with turkey meat instead of ground beef (I don't eat ground beef generally) and turkey pepperonis.  I also added sauteed onions and zucchini and some garlic to the turkey meat to pack in vegies.  It tasted pretty good.

Made this last night, followed the directions and it came out phenomenal!  I cooked the pasta halfway, layered it the way the directions say to, and the pasta came out nice and plump, not too mushy.  Added a lot of parmesean cheese (maybe half a cup) and about a tablespoon of oregano on the top during the last hour of cooking and ended up with a real nice pasta dish.  Don't know what everyone else who's complaining about the pasta coming out wrong is doing-I didn't add any water to the tomato soup, so that might have had something to do with it.  Next time I make this it'll be a bacon cheeseburger slow cooker pizza!

This must have been totally good, my kids walked away so stuffed, theny actually turned down dessert....WOW!! I used Nana's Pasta Sauce, a personal recipe by EAKE on All Recipes. For some reason my crockepot was slow, and the center wasn't completely done when I needed it ready, so I transferred it to a baking pan and finished it off in the over and topped it off with additonal cheese. Great recipe for the oven as well if you are in a time crunch. Thanks.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the cheese did not get melty in the slow cooker like it would on a pizza.  The flavors were wonderful!  As another reviewer suggests, next time I'll layer the items in a baking dish and bake it so the cheese gets gooey.  Also, per other reviews, I used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef and I used a large jar of pasta sauce instead of pizza sauce and tomato soup.  I made it for an office potluck, and many people had seconds.  I will definitely make this again!

Excelent, and the family LOVES it.  I'll try some lower fat versions of peperoni in the future and see how it turns out.  It's just as good without the cheese for those with milk allergies.

Very dry and disappointing.  I have made something similar in the oven and it turned out better.  I thought I would try this so I could throw it in the crock pot and go away.  IF I try this again (doubtful) I may add a lot more sauce and water.  Also I like a lot more cheese.  But again I have made this in the oven before and it turns out much better.  Thank you.

I made this recipe for my husband and I on a day that our son wasn't home. We liked it. I don't eat red meat so I used ground turkey instead of beef and turkey pepperoni. I also added some baby spinach and green onions. I only used a 6 oz. package of pepperoni but next time I will use even less because the spices from the pepperoni really came out and the whole thing was quite spicy. My husband and I liked it, but due to the spiciness, I know our son won't eat it. I will make it again sometime when our son is not home.

I liked this recipe but I have to admit, the pepperoni made it a little greasy.  I'm going to cut down the amount considerably.  Other than that, my fussy eaters loved it!

this was a good recipe, but not fabulous.  i might try it again with half cheddar to give it a little more flavor.  also, would stir halfway through cooking time because otherwise, the sauce would not mix in to the hamburger and noodles.

I first made this recipe at a potluck for work-I was concerned about the recipe turning out dry, so I did add extra sauce (although I don't think I would have had to).  I also added my favorite pizza toppings; mushrooms, olives & onions.  Everybody loved it.  (As stated in previous reviews, you need to brown the ground beef before layering it in the crock pot.)  Thanks Jill!

This dish was very tasty and soooooo easy to make!  I did cook the ground beef first, as recommended by another reviewer, and I too used the regular sliced pepperoni.  Fast, simple and delicious....perfect for a busy day's dinner.  Thanks, Jill :)

This was quite good, and definately very easy!  If you don't have a large family, I suggest scaling it down- at 6 servings it made an entire large crockpot full.  The only substitution I made was using regular sliced pepperoni instead of pep.sausage.  A keeper!

I pretty much followed the recipe.  It was tasty.  The only downside is that it got hard on some of the edges where it stuck to the crock pot.  Maybe next time I will only cook for 3.50 hours instead of 4 hours in the recipe.

Good, but needed more sauce than stated. I will make again, but in addition to more sauce, will add extra pizza toppings like green peppers, mushrooms and such.

I quickly added dried onion and garlic to the browning meat, and 3/4 cup water. Don't over boil noodles!

I thought this was yummy.  Made it for the first time last night, and though I had planned it for a dinner, I got started too late to eat it last night.  I let it cook anyway and had some for lunch today.  No issues with dryness.  There was a little grease, but not much.  Will definitely make it again and experiment with more ingredients.

Very easy to make.  I nixed the hamburger.  Added a 5 oz  package of mini pepperoni and browned 6 oz of sweet italian sauage. Substituted tomato sauce instead of soap. Put in 4 cups of Mozzarella cheese.  Spinkled grated Romano cheese into the sauce.  This was amazing!  The family (6 people) ALL liked it....and were talking about the next time we would have it....before dinner was finished.  My New FAVORITE recipe!

Great recipe!  I mixed everything but the pasta and cheese together in the crockpot, cooked the pasta slightly underdone and added it during the last hour.  I added the cheese right before we ate it and it was perfectly melted.  Thanks Jill for a GREAT recipe!

sooo good! only made a few alterations. 1st I used turkey burger cooked with onions. Also I made my own pizza sauce because I didn't have any. Just used tomato sauce with garlic, italian seasonings, and s&p. and I skipped the tomato soup. Also I didn't use nearly as much peperoni's or cheese and it was still plenty cheesey and meaty. I will definitely be adding this to my monthly rotation!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Everyone loves pizza! We left out the ground beef, pepperoni and tomato soup and used black olives, onions, and our favorite pineapple.  It was really, really good.  I didn't cook the pasta all the way through before putting it in the crock pot and it was still a little soggy.  Next time I'll leave it crunchier before adding it.

My picky son gives this 5 stars. He ate three bowls for supper last night and saved some for his breakfast this morning. I pretty much followed the directions except I added a lot of spices (garlic salt, italian seasoning, basil, parsley), added extra cheese and I did not layer the ingredients. I will be making this again and according to my son, it will be weekly.

We used our own tomato spaghetti sauce and mixed it with browned hot sausage. Layered with penne pasta, pepperoni and mushrooms.  Came out perfectly!  Just be sure to eat it up because the leftovers turn to mush by the 2nd day.

This turned out awesome!  My family loved it.  I almost thought that it was going to have too much sauce but it needed all the sauce it calls for - very yummy and the pepperoni added just the right zing to it also.

This is tasty, but I don't think it tastes like pizza. It reminds me of lasagna, in a "mushy" way. I did do mine in the crock, and I used some pizza sauce but ran out so I had to substitute spaghetti sauce. Unfortunately, all I had was this vodka marinara, but it was surprisingly good. I also added about a teaspoon of oregano between the layers.

This recipe is amazing! I loved it. I used Rotoni noodles instead because they hold the sauce better. Seasoned the beef and stirred it up and added water before serving it. Next time I will use more sauce tho...

My family of picky eaters all liked this dish. I made a few changes to the recipe that I found helpful. I seasoned the beef while browning it with italian seasoning, pepper, garlic powder, and parsley flakes. I used Rotoni noodles instead which hold the sauce better. I added water and stured it right before serving it. I also used a pizza cheese (Bothe cheddar and motzerella). Next time I'd add a little more sauce though.This would make a great pot luck meal. I love the fact that it's so easy to make. All in all, this is a great recipe and I plan to use it alot.

Excellent!  Will definitely make again.  The only thing I did different was stir the tomato soup into the ground beef instead of layering it.  I thought one can would be hard to spread out between the two layers.

This was a great economical meal for my family.  My picky three year-old loved it, which is always a plus.  It was exactly what I was looking for at the time-- quick, easy, kid-friendly, cheap, and didn't require a trip to the grocery store.  Will make again & again, maybe with extra pizza toppings added.

Yum yum Yum!! The Fam raved about this one - I am trying to use my slow cooker more often cause it is easy!! This one took some time to prep, but it was great! I added olives, mushrooms, canadian bacon. I only used one pound of well drained sausage instead of hamburger - okay but better with more. Used Spaghetti sauce too - just fine. I did add 3/4 cup of water as others suggested - but the noodles got a little too soft so maybe not so much. Will definitely do again!!

I put the pepperoni in with the ground beef when I browned it.  That seemed to take some of the grease away.  This was Excellent!  Will make again.

This is a lot like a basic crock pot lasagne--but the pepperoni gives it a different flavor.  My lasagna loving kids (ages 12 & 15) really, really liked it--the pepperoni was their favorite part.  I'll definitely make it again!

This was tops with my family. I have 3 healthy boy and a husband that love to eat.  My youngest wanted to know if we could have this every night! Being a working mother (with another on the way), I rely heavily on Slow Cooker meals and especially like the ones that resemble a real meal.  I will be adding this to my favorite recipe list! Thank you, Jill!

I tried this and both my boyfriend and I loved it. I used ground beef and browned it with onions, while mixing a can of spaghetti sauce with half can pizza sauce. In order to get some of the spaghetti sauce out at the bottom of the can, I added a little water then poured it in and mixed well. I layered like this: enough sauce to cover the bottom of the crockpot without burning, then meat mixture, noodles (uncooked), sauce again, top with cheese and turkey pepperoni. I did that again, and after finding I didn't have enough sauce, used another can of spaghetti sauce with the rest of the pizza sauce, and it made a good, hearty portion. I cooked on high for 2.5 hours. Next time I'm going to add more vegetables, but it certainly tasted great, but a little more like a pasta dish than pizza.

This is a keeper. instead of canned pizza sauce, you may want to try Homemade pizza sauce on all recipes by  Recipe by Taste of Home Test Kitchen. I also used 1lb burger and 1lb Italian sausage.

This was very, very salty, probably due to the pepperoni. Not sure whether I will make it again, unless I use another kind of meat.

Ugh! I gave this recipe two stars because it wasn't horrible and I do like all of the ingredients in the recipe, but there was just too much meat!  I think if the tomato soup was omitted, half to one-fourth of the beef was used, and if the cheese was doubled this recipe would be better.

This is a great starter dish. I've made it several times in the slow cooker. Even though I like to stick with recipes, there are a million possibilities to add ingredients that you enjoy - onions, mushrooms, green peppers, black olives, just about anything. I was cleaning out my recipe binder and found this exact recipe 3 times! The date on one was from 2005.

This was very delicious and simple.  It fed six adults and three children, I do think it needed a bit more cheese imo, I didn't have tomato soup, so I used tomato sauce instead.  Very good recipe....

I tried this recipe because I wanted to cook something in my slow cooker besides meat!  It wasn't very good at all.  Not much flavor, and I even added a lot of garlic and italian seasoning.  I undercooked the pasta and it was still mushy when it was done cooking.  I make the Homestyle Bakes Pizza Pasta meal that comes in a box at the store and cooks in the oven that that is sooo much better than this.  It's easier, quicker, and cheaper!

It was really good, but I think it needs a bit of doctering up.  try throwing different spices in there and its great.  super easy, and you can make it for large groups, easy!

My family loved this, I did not love just "like".  I took other suggestions and used wagon wheel pasta, spaghetti sauce, pepperoni, and hot sausage & ground beef combo. So I did not make the exact recipe.  I will make again for the family because it was super easy and they loved it.  I would say you can make it in the oven just as well and the cheese would become bubbly and brown.

Just like a pizza but without the crust! I didn't layer the ingredients and it turned out fine. This is a recipe that you can "customize" to fit your own palette.  I added some red onion and used cute bowtie pasta instead of the rigatoni.  I pre-cooked the pasta for half of the suggested time before adding it to the pot to eliminate soggy noodles.

Based on reader reviews - especially the one below that describes this as a winner for teenagers - I made this recipe for my 16 year old last night. It was just... alright.  Not bad, but not wonderful either.  For about $3.50 per serving, it is a filling meal, but I won't make it again.

This was pretty good but I will definitely cut way back on the meat as this was just too much for me. I envision this would be great with other pizza topping and will change this up some next time I make it.

I made this as a time saver for supper on Trick or Treat night. I used my older crock pot that is not as hot because it was cooking all day while I was at work. This was good but I did make some changes. I browned ground beef and Italian sausage. I used a large jar of pasta sauce and omitted the pizza sauce and soup. I also sprinkled garlic powder and oragno on each layer. I used a whole pack of pepperoni. Kids loved it. Easy.

I made this for a competition at school and it was voted the BEST of 13 dishes!  It was soooooooooooooo good.
I did use sausage instead of hamburger, but so worth it!

Thanks for sharing.

Quick and easy to throw together in the slow cooker!  I omitted the ground beef and just used reduced-fat turkey pepperoni.  This is one of my family's most-requested dinners...in fact, we're having it tonight!  Great recipe, thanks!

Generally good, however slow-cooking not practical for me. I work longer than 4hrs and I sleep longer than 4hrs. I did turn it into a casserole though. Mixed 1/2 the ground beef with half pound sausage and made a sauce mixing pizza sauce, tomato bisque(instead of Cream of T), mushrooms, onions and Italian seasonings with the beef mix. Less layering work that way. Just layered sauce, noodles, pepperoni and cheese and repeated finishing with cheese baking until cheese was melted and starting to get bubbly. Yum!

Used macaroni pasta, and didn't layer, just mixed it together all at once in the crock pot--FABULOUS! Great for football sunday. Would be great with bread on the side. Those of you with Bread Machines--see the Cheese Herb Bread on this site-it went well together. I will make this again, for sure!

I didn't do mine in the Crock. I just fixed everything on the stove(excluding the soup and changing the noodles to Penne and I cooked the pepperoni in a skillet first) and put it in a casserole dish, popped it in the oven on Broil for a couple of minutes. The cheese was yummy brown. It was really good, the whole family liked it. I will definately fix again.

I don't necessarily think this needs to be made in the slow cooker. It is nice that it can be, if needed. I made mine on the stove and then baked it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes. The kids gobbled it right up.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce.  My husband and daughter, who are extremely picky eaters, actually liked this.  I thought it was a bit rich, but because it was something that we all ate, I'll have to give it 5 stars.

Made while camping on the Cape. I didn't have enough sauce so it came out a little dry, but the kids (all nine of them) loved it.  I served extra sauce and cheese on the side. I agree with other reviewers.  Next time I'll add red peppers, sweet italian sausage and a few mushrooms. Will definitely make again

This is very good and easy.  I made it healthier by adding very lean beef, reduced fat cheeses and veggie pepporoni.  I also added a bunch of veggies like mushrooms, olives and onions.  It turned out great.

This was an awesome dish!!!!!  I added onions to my beef while browning it.  It was very tasty!  I didn't have the 2 jars of pizza sauce so I used a can of tomatoe bisque soup.  It still turned out great.  We will definatly make again, and use more cheese.

I changed the serving to (4), and it still came out to a lot.  Very good, very easy recipe.  I read other reviews about it being too dry, so I added a little bit of water after an hour and a half.  And I also cut the time to 3 hours instead of 4.  Very good! will make again, not often but again.

This was disappointing for me. More like your basic ground beef tomatoey casserole with a hint o pizza. Maybe this would be better as an oven baked thing if that's the case? I wouldn't make again sorry.

Excellent flavor...I added pepperoni, cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. It was delicious! I think next time I'd pass on the ground beef...but that's just a personal preference! It was so easy to make, and a big hit at dinner!

Of course I wasn't expecting this to taste exactly like pizza, but although this recipe has ingredients similar to what's found in Pizza, I wouldn't go as far as saying it tastes like one. You can probably start off by substituting the ground beef with italian sausage. My husband, a pizza fanatic, asked me to never make this again. Sorry!

My family enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will make some changes to suit our tastes. The pepperoni...I will dice up and maybe not add as much. I am not a big pepperoni fan...so i picked around it. Really you could add just about anything you liked on your pizza...onions,mushrooms or green peppers. I followed the directions exactly...but did add about 3/4 cup of water when all was said and done, I 
remembered some complaining about dryness so ours was not dry at all. Was perfect! This would be a good recipe to take for a potluck. Makes alot and is simple!

Loved it. I did however add an extra can of pizza sauce, and couldn't find cream of tomato soup so I used regular tomato soup. i work night shift, so i put this in the crock pot in the morning when i got home, went to bed, and when i woke up it was ready. served with garlic bread and it was perfect! will definately make this again.

Great recipe, thanks Jill.  I also cooked the pepperoni with the ground beef, added our favorit pizza topping, onions, mushrooms, green pepper, garlic salt. Drained grease!! I used a 14 oz Jar of Ragu Pizza Sauce, but also a 26 oz Bertonolli (Italian sausage - garlic & Romano)  I mixed all ingredients together, then used the slow cooker so I can forget about whats baking in the over, plus free it up for baking breads, cookie etc.  I found comments very helpful, and this will become an easy dish for family outings/church functions...  Very Good!!!

I baked in the oven instead of a slow cooker so only needed one jar of pizza sauce.  Good and different casserole.

Really good and quick.  The only problem I had was some noodles were hard and crunchy because they were against the side of the crockpot for 4 hours.  I think it would be better next time so stir everything together really well (to keep the noodles moist) instead of layering and then put cheese on top towards the end.

This turned out great in the slow cooker, very easy.  I also liked how you can add in your own toppings for different tastes.  I will definitely be making this again.

My teenage boys loved this recipe. A really hearty dish.  However, it's really, really fattening for the rest of the family!  It's a good crowd pleaser when my boys have their friends over or a take along to a sports potluck.

This was simple and great for a busy weekend.  Instead of the pizza sauce, I used Ragu Rich and Meaty sauce.  I also added some italian seasonings.  Yes, it turns out somewhat greasy, especially if you add a lot of pepperoni/other meat (I added MORE than the recipe called for because I LOVE it!)... but it is PIZZA, and I personally have never ate a pizza that wasn't greasy.  It goes with the territory.  This recipe is great, and you can add anything that you'd add to your favorite pizza.  Thanks for the great one!

This is a wonderful dish.  I have only one suggestion.  You don't need 8 oz. of pepperoni.  I used 8 oz. the first time I made this and there was way too much grease.  I now just make one layer of pepperoni in the middle of the recipe and one layer on top, using about half of the 8 oz. bag and that is just the right amount!

This was so great! My husband really loved it. The only thing I would do differently is to not add so much pepperoni, 8oz ended up being too much, I think next time I would just use 4oz.

This was very easy to prepare and my husband and grown son "wolfed" it down.  I like the fact that it takes only 4 hours in the slow cooker.  Easy to make in the morning and have ready for a hearty lunch.  Thanks, Jill!

This recipe is Fantastic!! My husband and 4 year old son think it is the best dish I have ever made. The cheese seems to melt into the noodles giving it such a great taste. I would highly recommend it to anyone!!

The amount of ingredients is insanely to much.  Unless you're cooking for a family of 12 then you need to modify.  
It had a good taste/basis but the grease from the pepperoni just ruined the dish for me.

For the amount of ingredients, the time to cook, I felt like I should have just made spaghetti. It was nothing special. The pepperoni flavor was lost cooking for 3.5 hrs.; like other reviewers stated- pretty bland. And that's after adding more seasonings like others had suggested. Definitely will not make again.

I made a couple of minor adjustments. I only added 6 oz of pepperoni  and put the noodles in uncooked. I added 1 1/2 cans (soup) of water and mixed everything together, making sure the noodles were covered. I added an extra 45 minutes to the cooking time and the noodles were perfect!  Thank you for this recipe! :)

It honestly didn't taste like pizza to me....it tasted more like goulash but we still liked it. I did fry the pepperoni first and then let it drain on napkins and it didn't turn out greasy at all; which the BF loved because he didn't have any heartburn.

love. easy to make. I used a whole box of pasta and also used 2 bottles of pizza sauce that were 15 ozs each. I also browned the beef and then added all the sauce to let it get to temp all together. I then did my layers in the crock pot.

This was a keeper. I tweaked it a bit too. I used sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of ground beef. I used 1 jar of spaghetti sauce and 1 jar of pizza sauce, added some water, and didn't use the soup. I also used turkey pepperoni and added a bag of chopped spinach. It was a total hit.

I used 1 pound of ground beef. 4 1/2 cups of montery jack cheese. added a little bit of diced onion, little bit of diced green pepper. Used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce for moisture. And used no yoke egg noodles instead of rigatoni. split into two layers.
Good dinner.

I change this recipe by using 1 lb. of rigatoni, 1 lb. of ground beef and 1 lb. of hot italian sausage(out of the casing).  I use 3/4 cup of water instead of the tomato soup and I use Ragu with Meat sauce instead of pizza sauce.

This was a great recipie. I was concerned based on other reviews that is might be mushy. It was not. I mixed sauce and soup with beef and layered with other ingredients. Cheese did not melt away and it tasted great. I make many casseroles similar to this in the oven. This was great to be able to make a few hours ahead. I cooked for a little less time and slightly under cooked noodles. Plenty of sauce and good flavor. All the family enjoyed it.

I didn't change a thing about this recipe other than to add onions to the hamburger. It was awsome. My family loved it especially my pasta loving boyfriend. The only thing I may do differentlly next time is to add more cheese to the very top in say the last 30 mins or so of cooking so it will be all melty. The cheese almost seemed like it disentegrated..but it was still so good!!

This is certainly a keeper.  It made quite a bit for only 3 of us but I think it might even be better as leftovers. I wasn't too sure about adding the tomato soup but did anyway and it turned out great.  Will certainly be putting this into our monthly rotation. Thanks!

This was very tasty.  I used 2 cups shredded mozzarella and 2 cups shredded colby rather than 4 cups mozz. only because mozz. is so expensive!  I layered the ingreadients twice.  Shall make again!

My husband and 2 boys devoured this dish.  It was really easy to make.  I myself didn't think that it had much taste, but then again I was sick the weekend that I made it.  But I'll make this again for sure b/c the rest of the family really enjoyed it.  Hopefully next time I'll be able to taste more of it.

This recipe was a big hit at my job.  Made it for the office and fed 6 people.  However, everyone said that they believed this to be lasagna more than pizza.

Big hit with my camping group.  Only problem was that I doubled the recipe for the larger group and it wouldn't all fit in my crock pot, and I use a decent sized one!  I had to leave some of the layers out, but really, how can you go wrong with pasta and cheese.  Even with some missing layers, it was all eaten up and everyone was happy.  Will surely make again!

Well I made some changes...I used 1 lb ground turkey, no sugar added tomato and basil spaghetti sauce, fat free mozz cheese, and turkey pepperoni (sorry I'm a healthy food freak!). I didn't do it in the slow cooker, instead I layered everything in a casserole dish and baked it for 30 mins in the oven. Not quite sure, but something is missing. I did season with Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Just not the "pizza" I was looking for.

Made this tonite and everyone thought it was good. I also just mixed it all together and put in microwave for about 15 minutes. I probably will make it again.

Sorry, we did not care for this at all. The pasta was too mushy and the texture was just not appetizing to us. I think we are pretty particular about pasta being al dente and can not tolerate it any other way. I will have to steer clear of recipes like this in the future. I did like how the pepperoni cooked down and got so soft - but that was the only thing I liked about this recipe, I'm afraid.

This is a great dish.  My husband made it first for a friends baby shower that I had as a surprise and all was gone!  You can make it however you want.  We use the half Italian Sausage also for some spice.  I have had several people ask for this recipe.

This recipe is so easy and delicious! I've added canadian bacon in with pepperoni and it was great. I'd like to add some veggie toppings in there as well, but my boyfriend says he only wants the meat... I'm sure it's good either way. I also use probably twice as much cheese as what is recommended because we can't get enough of it!

This was great, and you can customize to whatever you like on a pizza, its almost like eating pizza toppings. I also added extra sauce(garlic&herb) on the pasta layer, for fear of it being too dry. The wife and kids gave it thumbs up, and its so easy to make, this is a keeper, thanks.

I didn't care for this recipe. It was far too greasy for my taste. My 18 and 2 year old sons liked it though. I think I would use something other than pepperoni if I tried it again. Maybe mushrooms or onions.

My major issue with this dish was the dryness of it.  The pasta absorbed so much of the liquid, that the dish seemed very dry when we went to eat it.  It had a good taste, but was just too dry.  I think this recipe would be good just all mixed together and baked in the oven.

Pretty good - different and interesting.  I made this using ground turkey and turkey pepperoni and couldn't tell there was a difference.  Also, due to time, I threw everything into a casserole dish and baked it for an hour at 350.

This was good. I liked the flavor of the pepperoni. My 7 year old gobbled it up, so I know she approves. I mixed everything up instead of layering it. When I make this again I will use less meat.

This turned out a little dry but my family still ate it. Maybe with a few changes it would be a repeat in my house.

This was just ok.. I had such great hopes, but it was a little dry.. I would use potini pasta next time to hold the sauce a little better.. Also throw in some onions, green peppers, and other typical pizza toppings to give it a little more umph! I will make this again, with some slight modifications.

GREAT recipe!!  My husband loves this, I make it once a week.  I can't find cream of tomato, so I just use tomato and add in oregano and basil, and save the pepperoni for the top.I have also learned that any cheese goes with this (I have even used cheddar)

Made this last night for dinner.  It's very easy, don't know why other reviewers said there's too much effort, there's practically no effort at all!  Anyway, I thought it was OK, but everyone else loved it.  Will probably make it again.

I think next time I will brown the ground beef before putting it in the slow cooker.   I didn't like the grainy consistency but the taste was great.

My family loved it, although I have to say, it didn't taste so much like pizza as maybe just something italian.  Anyway, the family voted to keep the recipe, definate comfort food!  Thanks!

this was just okay for us.  I followed the recipe exactly with only substitution of turkey pepperoni.  It was okay, but not worth the effort to make again.

Since I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I gave this the benefit of the doubt by rating it a little higher than I would have. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and I microwaved the pepperoni a little before adding it to the crock pot. I cooked the Italian sausage before adding it as well. Those were the only changes I made, and I didn't care for it that much. We ate our servings for dinner, but shunned the leftovers. It seemed to be missing something, and didn't really taste that much like pizza, except for the pepperoni part. I don't think I'll make it again.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe...my kids did not. I found that effort making this was not worth the final outcome. Won't make again.

This recipe was amazing. I made it for a potluck at work and ended up handing out the recipe to everyone of my co-workers. It is so versatile because you can change the ingredients to suit anyone's taste. I will use it again and again!
