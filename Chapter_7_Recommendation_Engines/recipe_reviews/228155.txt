I authored this recipe. I modified it slightly by increasing the liquid smoke to 2 tablespoons for more smoky flavor. I slow roast the roast for 31/2 hours so that the roast absorbs more flavor. I no longer shred the pork with forks, rather I shred it with my fingers so that I can remove all chunks of fat and remove any slimy fat or gristle from the meat. A 3 pound pork shoulder roast will make about 4½ packed cups of shredded pork. Use this base recipe for making carnitas, green chili or barbecue pork. Just use your favorite recipe for making green chili or barbecue pork with the pulled pork from this recipe.

Dale all i can say is thank you, thank you, thank you! just made this recipe this evening and it was fantastic!! i had almost given up on pork butt all together because it would either come out dry and tough or soggy and inedible. this recipe is perfect! i wish i could give it 10 stars. i followed it to a tee but read the update where you had added more liquid smoke and pulled it apart with your hands so i followed those modified directions. the pork roast came out juicy and full of flavor and fell off the bone without any effort at all. if you have ever had problems with pork butt like i have then this is the no fail recipe for you. easy to make and delicious which is how it should be

This pork was FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC!  We loved it.  We frequent a restaurant that serves excellent carnitas, so this recipe caught my eye when I was looking for something to do with some pork for dinner.  
I did make some additions, just because of my family's preferences.  I used a pork loin instead of a pork shoulder and it still came out perfect.  I didn't have any liquid smoke on hand, so I skipped that part.  After adding the pork back to the pot we dumped a bag full of roasted, peeled & chopped green chilis because we are New Mexican natives and that is what we do.  I thought it would make it really spicy, but it wasn't.  I felt that the green chili added an extra dimension that we really enjoyed.  We served it over warm corn tortillas with onions, tomatoes, cilantro and salsa.  It was an excellent meal.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, our family will repeat it over and over again.

SOOOO easy!! And I loved this recipe because it did not use a slow cooker like 99% of the other pulled pork recipes on here. I don't own one, so its not possible for me. I used the boneless pork ribs I had on hand (3 were plenty for a dinner for 2 with leftovers). I kept all spices and proportions the same as stated in the recipe, but added a squirt each of ketchup and dijon as well as a tablespoon of brown sugar to the chicken broth before placing in the oven. DONT get scared when your onions look almost burnt, its just extreme carmelization and will add that "thing" to your pulled pork that is out of this world. i ended by tossing in a quality, sweet BBQ sauce, and serving on toasted bread. felt like I used a secret southern family recipe or something!! My boyfriend was floored :)

I was looking for a pulled pork recipe not smothered in BBQ sauce since we had some at a cookout and my family seemed to like it better. Based on our preferences I modified this recipe as follows:  I used a 1.2lb pork tenderloin because that's the perfect size for one dinner for us. I skipped the onions since the kids won't eat them. I added 2T honey to the liquid.  I accidentally used 2 1/4 Tablespoons liq smoke instead of teaspoons (oops!!). And I seared the meat in a skillet but put the meat and liquid into a glass baking dish covered with foil to bake it. I only cooked it for 2.5 hours. Now the result:  THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.   So simple to make and the whole family loved it!!  The smoke flavor was wonderful, and I would use 2T again. It was not overpowering at all and had a nice flavor. Most of all this was incredibly moist!  After I shredded the meat i tossed it back in the baking pan with tongs, just coating all the meat with he liquid. pretty much all got absorbed back into the meat. It was not greasy at all and so moist and flavorful.  I HIGHLY recommend this recipe.

Just as fabulous as everyone has said.  I needed to serve a party of 25 people.  Used a 9+ pound pork shoulder roast,  5 cups broth, 5+ Tbsp liquid smoke, 1-1/2 huge onions, 6 cloves garlic.  Cooked per recipe instructions.  Checked it at 4 hours and it was PERFECT.  Pulled off the bone easily. Put all the shredded meat and all broth together in crock pot to keep warm and serve from for carnitas for the party.  For the "carnitas bar, added Pico de Gallo,  thin sliced radishes and limes,  sour cream, guacamole,  and corn tortillas.  REALLY YUMMY!  Thanks, Dale. ??????

I just made this and WOW! It fell apart and was so delicious that my whole decided not to even use the buns and BBQ sauce we bought to make pulled pork sandwiches. We ate it just the way the recipe says to. The only things I did differently were 1. I did not have liquid smoke so I used Worcestershire sauce (1 tsp) and 2. I did not mix the shredded pork in the cooking juices but instead poured the juices in a gravy bowl to add on at the table. I love this recipe! So easy and oh so good!!

Very, very good!  Even without the liquid smoke (which I could not find).  I made BBQ pulled pork, and rubbed it with a little bit of dry BBQ seasoning at the beginning (along with the salt & pepper, including both black & white pepper) - and then added the BBQ sauce at the end after pulling.  It turned out great!!  I even saved a small amount of the pulled pork (sans BBQ sauce), to add to some homemade slow-cooker mac n cheese - which are DELICIOUS together :)

This is everything I was looking for in a pulled pork recipe. Easy instructions, a basic recipe that can be played with, and delicious pulled pork on the table for dinner! Also, done in the oven, not in a slow cooker.

This is a great recipe focusing on the pork. It's a great alternative when it's too cold to slow cook on the grill and doesn't hide the meat flavor behind sauces or sodas like other recipes. The only adjustments I made were to coat the pork in smoked paprika and chipotle powder before returning it to the pot, and using beef instead of chicken broth (it's what I had on hand!)

I forgot to take a picture, but we made this over the weekend and it was a HUGE HIT!  There is a guy who sets up on the weekends a few miles from our house, and he smokes pork and brisket and sells it for a fortune.  It is amazing.  Went to get some this weekend, and he wasn't there. So I checked Allrecipes and found this - 60 5-star ratings has to be good, right?  It was amazing and the whole family LOVED it.  We will make this many more times. Thanks Dale!

This was amazing! I had a 6# pork butt roast, so I doubled the onion and garlic. I used the posted amount of liquid smoke, I’m  not a huge fan of the flavor. I added 1 extra cup of low sodium chicken broth and that was plenty. It took 3 1/2 hours to cook. So tender and juicy! This is my new favorite pork recipe!

Delicious meal.  Next time I will use low sodium broth and not return the shredded pork to the liquid.  It is tender and juicy enough without it.

This pulled pork recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I don't like the pork swimming in BBQ sauce because that's all you taste. This dish is very flavorful although if you like the BBQ flavor just add some to your own serving. So good!!!

This is possible the best pulled pork I have ever eaten. I was looking for a recipe to do in the oven, this one covers all the bases. One person in the house dose not care for barbecue sauce, not a problem, left his as is. I did add sauce to the portions for those who like it. It was a feast night for all.

This is the pulled pork recipe you're looking for. Perfection. Delicious even without any sauce, which was what I wanted. As good as any pulled pork from an expensive smoker.

 I made it with the author's changes that he (Dale) mentioned in his comment/review. Even with 2 Tbsp of liquid smoke, it was just slightly smokey. I didn't need all of the liquid at the end, and discarded the onions at that point.

Dale, you have my heartfelt gratitude. Now, do you have a similarly magical way to smoke brisket in an oven?

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I made it as is and it was a hit. Even at work people enjoyed it. Had it in a tortilla with my homemade salsa verde and sauteed onions. YUM!!! Thanks again. (2 thumbs up!)

Simple, Easy, and Delicious! Followed the directions as written, with the modifications the author Dale suggested. Except I did not use any liquid smoke (I did not have any and don't really care for the taste) I used a 3.5 lb. bone in pork shoulder roast and cooked for 3.5 hours in an enamel coated cast iron dutch oven. It came out so flavourful, tender and succulent! We each made our own sandwiches mixing the meat with some liquid & onions from the pot and our own amount of  BBQ sauce to taste (some didn't use any bbq sauce),  slice Harvarti cheese & creamy coleslaw on a toasted cheesy bun, best sandwich ever! This is a fantastic roast as is but also a great base for other recipes calling for pork. A definite keeper, thanks Dale!

My family really liked this simple recipe. It was tender and moist and had a lot of flavor so it made a great base for a number of dishes. I don't have a slow cooker so I started it at 325 degrees then lowered the heat to 275.

I didn't have any liquid smoke nor any garlic, unfortunately, but once the meat was cooked I just added a small bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce to the meat after shredding it and this was fantastic. Sorry, no pictures, I never remember to do that.

We enjoyed this pork shoulder roast recipe tonight with rice and beans and a side salad.  Tomorrow night I plan to shred the pork and add BBQ sauce with a cabbage slaw on top for some delicious sliders.  I like that the recipe doesn't have a lot of spice or a defined flavor, that way I can adapt it by adding my own sauces, spices, etc. to create different dishes.  I'll be making this again.

This was so easy and so good. I was trying to find a pulled pork recipe that didn't involve slow cooker or soda. It's thirty degrees and snow here, so this was perfect. I paired with Zippy BBQ sauce from this site, and it was awesome! I can't wait to do again and try carnitas. Thanks for posting.

I browned this in a pan (with the olive oil, pepper, and garlic) and then transferred it to a crock pot for a while to simmer with the onions and chicken broth. Turned out perfectly tender and delicious.

I was very skeptical of this receipe because of its simplicity. However, it turned out to be one of the best receipes for pulled/shredded pork I have tasted. Perfect and the family is requesting it for Christmas!

This was AMAZING!!!   Great flavor and super easy!!  I used this pork for a sandwich that has become my new favorite.  Fresh kaiser roll, crumbled Gorgonzola cheese, topped with hot pork and cold cold slaw.   OH MY WORD!!!

The taste of the meat was fantastic.  I followed the recipe but added some green chile salsa and a little hot sauce. The only reason for the four star rating is that the meat did not shred easily like other recipes I have used.  I don't know if I did not cook it long enough or if it was a poor cut of meat.  I amused to the meat shredding with two forks, easily but this had to be laboriously hand shredded. It was worth the work because the taste was very good.

I've not been one to cook much pork over the years, but this pork turns out so tender and flavorful that it totally changed my perspective about pork. The little bit of broth that results from making this is absolutely amazing and I've used it to make some really great bean and pork soup that we really love. I really like that it's cooked in the oven and not a slow cooker.  I think it has more flavor in the oven and doesn't turn into that characteristic mushy, flavorless crock pot meat.  This recipe has turned me into a pork lover!

If you are trying to go Paleo or Whole 30 this is a great recipe! Delicious plain... did not need barbecue sauce... not dry at all.

I used a crock pot  (for convenience). Pork butt for ten hours. Used whole cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of liquid smoke

Next time I would definitely use the full amount of liquid smoke (was afraid it would over power) and perhaps increase as author suggested. I also would try minced garlic as suggested or even bump that up a clove or two (we like garlic)

This is an easy way to prepare pork for sandwiches.  I think the next time I try it I'll use a good dry rub along with salt and pepper for the searing.  I didn't need all the chicken broth, so I'll cut back on that next time.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce for our sandwiches, and this was a big hit---especially with the younger crowd in our family.  Thanks, Dale!

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times now and it turns out great every time.  I did up the liquid smoke as the author suggested and it is excellent as pulled pork, BBQ pork, and green chili pork that I make with the leftovers when everything is done.  Pair this with coleslaw, mac-n-cheese, Texas toast and you have a great party!

This turned out amazing! I did put a nice dry rub seasoning on my pork roast before searing it. This recipe is basic and perfect, and you can add your own twist. Thanks Dale for a great resource. I will save this to my recipe box!

Made this a few times and always a hit!  It has turned out best with a few alterations.  I marinated the roast overnight with a can of coke, brown sugar, ketchup, onion, seasoning salt, smokehouse maple seasoning, and bbq sauce of choice ....and if I don't have overnight the longer time marinating the better.  I've used loin butt and shoulder they all turn out great.  Before I put it in the oven I don't sear it but do pull it out of the marinade and cover the roast with dry rub of Lawrys smokehouse maple and put it in the pan using the marinade as braising liquid.   Always turns out delicious with meat sooo tender and moist can't get folks to wait for a sandwich with dip!  ??

Dale, I can't thank you enough for this recipe. The pork, I used country style pork ribs, came out perfectly. The meat was very moist and best of all the recipe is so easy. Will use in tacos, tamales and barbeque pork sandwiches.

Savory, moist, and quick/easy preparation. Tasted great on whole wheat buns with coleslaw.
