Tried this recipe once, not changing anything.  It was good, but missing something.  Just made it again, this time making an pseudo Benedict sauce for it.  It made it great!  2 Tbsp mayo, 1 tsp grain mustard, 1 tsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp warm water, and a dash of cayenne.  Pour a bit on top.  Mmmm!

I love the combination of smoked salmon and dill and for their part, they did not disappoint.  If I were to compare this to other “non-traditional” Eggs Benedict, it’s terrible and only worthy of one star. The reality is, it’s just an egg on buttered toast and there is no comparison to a true Benedict style dish.  Non-traditional or not, to be classified as a Benedict it must include a sauce of some sort.  I thought the seasoned butter spread would be enough to compensate for omitting the sauce, but I was wrong.  Again, it’s just buttered toast.  After several bites, hubby and I had enough.  I quickly whipped up some Hollandaise sauce and turned  this into a proper Eggs Benedict.

I must admit that this is a great alternative to healthier eating.  I did miss the hollandaise, I'm afraid…it's a mouth-feel thing, but I really did love this recipe.  I added a baked tomato and more lemon juice to the gooey egg yolk.  Enjoy!

Wow...I can't believe this has so few ratings.  It was great.  I have to say, I had never had poached eggs or smoked salmon before this recipe.  I loved it!  The kids loved it. The husband loved it.  It also took about 10 minutes total to make, which was awesome.  Try to find a 10 minute meal as good as this. I have a feeling this might become a regular, and we're not the kind of family that has a rotation of meals. I need to work on my poaching technique, but I imagine that will improve with time.  Don't be afraid of it, because even ugly eggs taste good.  Add a nice vegetable to the side, and you've got dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter loves it!  She's a picky teen and doesn't like yolks so I left out the yolks and it's still really good and I substituted with dried dill.

Was a great use of last night's leftover grilled salmon! I was quite pleased with this breakfast and will definitely keep in mind for a quick dinner as well.

I added capers to the dill garnish at the end. Adds a nice look and a bit of zing to the flavor.
Like others, I also topped with Hollandaise Sauce.
Without, it's not (Eggs) Benedict.

Great breakfast.  I used leftover salmon.  Also, for butter used 1/2 butter and 1/2 cream cheese.  I made the eggs with the microwave poacher.  Thanks.

Very good and easy to make. Had to use dried dill because store was out of fresh. Can't wait to make it with fresh dill.

Excellent, I grow my own dill and only used about 2 tsp chopped and this produced an excellent butter.

This was a delicious recipe. I love eggs benedict but didn't want to spend the time on Hollandaise sauce. I found this recipe and wanted to give it a try. I love smoked salmon and dill together. I used a meaty smoked salmon. Not the thin sliced kind. I also used a garlic citrus herb blend with the melted butter instead of just dill. A bit of creamy dijon mustard mixed in to make the sauce less oily. Really delicious!

This is delicious. I only gave 4 stars because I changed the recipe to my taste. I grilled my own salmon in dill butter rather than buying smoked and added hollandaise sauce. Served with grilled asparagus with hollandaise. Yum. My husband loved it and we will make it again! Great for brunch or dinner!

Followed Chef John's recipe for poaching eggs, cooked them for 5 minutes and they came out perfectly. This eggs benedict without hollandaise recipe is delicious and easy. I will be making it at least monthly for Sunday breakfasts.

Used cilantro instead of dill
Added 1/3 of 8oz  cream cheese to butter mixture
1 teas raw apple cider vinegar
Packaged pink salmon(all I had at the time)
I just thought the butter mixture was to bland for the salmon but didn't want it to over power it either. Everyone just loved this recipe.

made this as a late night snack, had some smoked salmon I was wanting to get rid of. I cooked eggs too long (they harden quicker than I expected!!) but was still delicious.

this was delicious, I made this for the morning after the night before. I did make hollandaise sauce which was in a jug for those who wanted it. I went without and was not disappointed. I will be making this again come boxing day.
