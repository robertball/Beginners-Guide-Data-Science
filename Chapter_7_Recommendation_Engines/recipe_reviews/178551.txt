I cut this recipe in half. I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream, reduced fat mayonnaise and homemade ranch dressing mix (I suggest you use SD's dry ranch dressing mix, which is also on this site. I use that several times a week and it's totally replaced packaged dry ranch dressing.) I did thin this down with fat free milk so it would "dip" a little easier and stretch a little farther as well as technically be less calories per "dip". We all liked this a lot. This was a great way to make ranch dip at home with lowfat ingredients that I bought on sale this week. A little really does go a long way and it stretches really fantastically.

This was delicious!  I didn't have the suggested amount of green onions, but honestly, it didn't matter; it was flavor-packed with the amount I had on hand. I love the fact that this recipe did not call for a ton of mayo. This is a perfect dip if you are a green onion lover like me.

This is my first ever review.  I have never made my own dip before.  You know, always the old standby, sour cream and onion soup mix.  So, I tried this and passed it around to my family to taste test it.  They didn't want me to take it away! I did not have the jalepenos, but still good without.

I wanted a good Ranch Dip. This was it. I omitted the onion and jalapeno because I wanted a smooth dip.  This was very flavorful.

THIS IS A FABULOUS DIP!  I will never buy store packaged. I did add a little chopped cucumber to the mixture. Thank you for sharing.

I used 15 green onions (not the 18 called for) and WOW it was oniony. I like onions but this dip makes for very bad breath. My husband's breath was awful for 24 hours after eating this dip. He liked it a lot, but won't eat it again because of this.

I wish I could give this a 4.5 rating, but since I can't, I rounded it up to 5 stars.  The dip was very good, but not one I would RAVE about.  I'm a big fan of anything made with dry ranch mix... in fact, I've invented or modified a bunch of recipes just to incorporate that very ingredient.   I doubled this recipe, and in doing so learned a very important fact: that much dip does NOT fit into a normal blender receptaclel  It must be done in two batches.    Also, I made it the day before to allow the flavors to marry.  They did; the dip was a big hit served with crudite, chips and crackers; and I am very pleased I tried it!  Happy New Year!

This is a great recipe!  I left out the jalapeno, because I wanted it to be used for younger children as well.  A great way to use green onions from a CSA or garden.  I mixed the leftover into mashed potatoes and my toddler loved it!

Tried out this dip this last weekend on a camping trip and we all really enjoyed it.  Next time Iâ€™m going to make it at home so that the flavors can blend together more, but regardless it still was very good.

I followed the recipe exactly and mixed everything in my food processor.  This was super tasty as I served it with carrot and celery sticks along with ruffled potato chips.  Will definitly make this again!!!

Made this for our 4th of July BBQ, there was none left over! Huge hit and people asking for the recipe. I used fresh green onions from my garden. I didn't add the jalapeno, but I'm sure it would be a good addition. I definitely recommend!

This was terrific and everyone raved! I used two bunches of green onions (maybe a total of 16) and saved one to snip on top as a garnish.  I didn't use the jalapeno as I served it with the Sausage Stuffed Jalapenos from this site.  I always use my kitchen shears to cut green onions, doesn't crush them like a knife would and goes pretty quickly. Oh, and I'm thinking if you leave out the sour cream and mayo this would make a great bagel spread.

Really good! I was dubious reading 18(!!) green onions, but I really enjoyed this and it was a twist on the "normal" sour cream and ranch dip with the freshness of the green onions.  I would put another jalapeno in next time to really bring out some spice - I don't think it would overpower the other flavours.  Served with veggie dippers.

Very good I used "dry ranch style seasoning" recipe found on this site, instead of a packet of ranch dressing mix. Everyone loved it

I made this dip for chips. I didn't have any green onion :( and left out the mayonnaise. Was feeding this to my kids so I didn't add the optional jalapenos, but I would have loved it with it!

This is delicious!! I didnâ€™t have jalapeÃ±os but I used everything else and itâ€™s soo good! I have my  daughterâ€™s friends over for their high school graduation and it was gone in less than 10 minutes! Iâ€™m heading out now to get more ingredients so I can make more!

Exceptional dip! Been making this for over 5 years. Lots of wonderful flavor. A little bit goes a long way. Good with breads, and vegetables, as well as (of course) chips of any kind.  Love it with the Jalapenos included.

Thanks!

I made this recipe pretty close as written with the exception of I only had about 15 green onions and not any jalapeÃ±o peppers so I added a few shakes of hot sauce and some lemon pepper to spice things up.  I served with crackers and happened to have some popcorn snack crackers on hand.  It was totally addictive with the popcorn snack crackers and our company loved as did my husband and myself.  Delicious!

This was GONE super fast! I only did 15 green onions, but it was still FAB!  Try it!  I may even try making it a dressing!
