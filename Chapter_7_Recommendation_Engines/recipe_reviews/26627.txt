My roommate and I really enjoy this recipe and it is part of our regular rotation.  I made a few changes based upon previous reviews:  Used only 3 bunches of green onions instead of 4.  Added a medium yellow onion cut into wedges.  Added 4 cloves of minced garlic and approximately 1" of fresh grated ginger root to the marinade.  Used 2 tablespoon of Aleppo pepper instead of the crushed red pepper and whole dried red chile peppers.  I found that the Aleppo adds a nice bite to the dish without being too hot (I'm a whimp when it comes to hot food).  I did not think the soy sauce was too overpowering and there was plenty of salt.  With the above changes it makes this dish great!  Good luck!  

Update: You may substitute vanilla extract for the sherry.  I tried this and it tasted the same.

This recipe was ok, but like others had written, it still needed something. I decided to try some garlic and ginger, I sauteed them in a separate pan and added them in toward the end. Fabulous! I cooked it for the family I'm a chef for and they raved!

I was looking for something that would come close to the Mongolian Beef our favorite Chinese restaurant (well, not the favorite so much as the closest) serves.  This surpassed it.  I added a tablespoon of hoisin sauce and 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the marinade/sauce.  I also reduced the cornstarch to 1 tablespoon.  I stir fried the green onions along with some thinly sliced yellow onion and green bell pepper because that's how King's Garden does it.  I also didn't use quite as much oil as called for, and everything came out terrific.  My daughter claimed it was much better than the restaurant's!  Thanks, Kimber!

This is IT! This is what I've been looking for! I disagree with the two previous posts- this is "eat it 2 times a week, yummy!" Doubling the sauce is not a bad idea if you like more sauce. I just kept it covered while cooking so the sauce didn't cook down. I added some sweet onions along with the green onions- just me preference. This is my new favorite recipe.

All the Chinese flavor but without the complex cooking techniques.  I was very pleased with how the marinade thickened into a sauce.  This recipe is easy to prepare & tastes great.

YUM! Great recipe that tastes like a restaurant dish.
I did make a few modifications. Added broccoli, added more sesame oil and cut down on the crushed red pepper. I served it over maifun rice noodles.

Easily a 5-Star recipe!  This dish is easy and fast to make and produces amazing flavor for the effort.  I substituted dry red wine for the sherry, dried chipotle pepper for the red chile peppers, sweet onion for the green onions, and I added 5 cloves of garlic and one sliced red bell pepper.  The result was a very flavourful dish with just the right amount of smoky heat.  Absolutely delicious - a dish I'll be making regularly.

Overall, a great dish. I shook it up a little. I subtracted the sherry and red pepper, and added two chopped garlic cloves, two teaspoons of powdered ginger, and black pepper to the meat mixture. I also seared the beef for about two minutes in the wok without the liquid to get some texture on the meat, and then followed that with the liquid. I added some thinly sliced white onion before combining everything. I served it over brown rice, topped with store bought fried chow mein noodles. The girl I'm seeing was muy impressed.

My fianci gave this 2.5 stars, I would give it 2. This definitely lacked flavor and heat. Next time I will try adding garlic,ginger and more sugar and kick up the crush pepper. Try adding water chestnuts for extra texture. Might try again.

Excellent flavor.  Not quite saucy enough for us.  I will definitely be making this again, but will double the sauce ingredients.

This was simply wonderful. I used sirloin steak instead of the roast (because that is what I had on hand). What a wonderful taste ... super simple... and just the right amount of spice.

I only had 0.6# of beef so halved the recipe proportions.  Didn't seem necessary to do all this seperate pan stuff, so just marinated everything along with some carrot slices and yellow onion slices thrown into the marinade. I also added 1 small clove of garlic.  Because the cut of beef was very tender used, just threw everything into my wok and it was done in a jiffy.  Used a little wok oil instead of vegetable oil for better flavor.  MY ONLY ISSUE IS WITH THE CORNSTARCH...IT IS WAYYY TOO MUCH.  I only used 1 tbsp. with halfing the recipe and still had to add some beef broth because it was too thick.  I think if using the full recipe would only use 1 tbsp.  Next time I would just leave the cornstarch out of the marinade and add it to the leftover marinade and thicken at the end.  I found the cornstarch had a tendency to scorch a little.  I like spicy and only used 1 tsp. tunisian chili pepper in the halved recipe and it was plenty.  Didn't know they ate so hot in Mongolia.  Very good recipe and would make it again.  Served with plain white jasmine rice.

This version is a little spicy for me, so I only use the crushed red pepper, not the whole peppers, and add 2-3 extra tablespoons of brown sugar.  

I also use only 2 tablespoons of corn starch, since it's too thick otherwise.

I like to put in extra veggies - my favorites are fresh mushrooms cut into quarters and baby corn -  and I usually only use 2-3 bunches of green onions - then I sautee all of the veggies together.

It's sooo yummy.

I had a different Mongolian beef recipe in my box, but my thought was that I had always assumed that this dish was supposed to be spicy. The other dish listed nothing of the kind, so I found this one and have to say it was delicious .. rather then serving with noodles I served with brown rice .. will definitely make again

My friend who absolutely hates spicy food gave me this recipe knowing how much I LOVE IT!! The spicier the better. I think this recipe is full of flavor, but for very very spicy as written. If you do NOT like spicy food this recipe is not for you. This is the first recipe that I have commented on that is how much I love it.

This was a disappointing recipe. I once had an excellent Mongolian Beef recipe (that I'd found in Southern Living magazine) that was nearly perfect: sweet and moderately tasting of soy with a good heat level and a gorgeous dark brown glaze. That's what I was hoping for here but it tasted instead mainly of soy sauce and the cornstarch thickened far too much. But at least it's gotten me motivated to go find that old S.L. recipe again.

Although the recipe is flawed, (sauteeing green onions for 6 minutes on medium high??) the flavor is great, although I did take other reviewer's advice and added chopped ginger and garlic. Superb! 

Edited; second time making I realized it needed more brown sugar and had far less moisture than necessary with the cornstarch. Deleted from recipe box.

Very good.  I did make a few changes...I added an extra tbs of brown sugar to the beef marinade, added some fresh ginger and I left out the pepper entirely.  I also used green peppers and green beans in addition to the onions and cooked them in oil and an extra half batch of the beefmarinade.  I added some grated ginger and garlic to the vegetables as well.  I would recommend using less cornstarch, as the beef marinade thickened way too much...I added extra soy sauce and some water to thin it out.

Really good.  I skipped the sherry and only used crushed red pepper - not whole.  Also prepared it a bit differently so it wasn't totally "authentic" Mongolian Beef but very tasty anyway.  I marinated and browned the beef (I used sliced flat iron steak) but then added about 1/4 cup water, carrots, and green onions and let it simmer for about 15 minutes.  I cut the baby carrots in half lengthwise and then again in 3 strips -

I haven't honed my Chinese cooking skills at all and this was a very easy dish to make. It was nearly restaurant quality. I would advise making it once to the recipe's specs to see what you want to add next time. I added some frozen garlic cubes. Be sure to whisk the slurry until it dissolves all of the corn starch and the thinner you slice the meat the better. This is a great base recipe that I'll use to develop a Mongolian Beef signature.

Not a bad recipe.  Anything but bland as other reviewers stated.  I don't know if I followed the recipe to a "T" though.  I almost always make the recipe as written the first time so I can give it a fair review.  After the initial attempt I'm free to use my creative license.  Unfortunately the first time I made this recipe I didn't have all of the ingredients... exactly.  I had to substitute some Pinot Grigio for the Sherry.  I used some Sriracha in combination with the chili flakes instead of the whole chilis.  I did have some Thai Bird chilis but I find it's easier to regulate the amount of heat using the chili sauce.  I found the sauce to be quite salty, too much so.  I also found the sauce thickened too much so I ended up adding more water.  This had the advantage of reducing the saltiness as well.

I gave the recipe 4 *s as I could've been at fault for not following or perhaps reading the recipe properly.  I'm making this dish again tonight for my Korean sister-in-law so we'll see if I have to change my rating one way or the other.  One thing I will keep the same as last time I made it was to add 4 cloves of garlic, two to the marinade and two to the onions when you initially soften them.  I will submit my recipe for Spicy Thai Beef with Basil shortly, similar to this recipe but far superior.

This has been one of our family's favorite recipes since it came out in Southern Living in 1985!  I had saved the recipe from the original magazine - my son came home from college with a special request for this dish and when I went to get the page from the magazine, I discovered that a big piece of the page was missing.  I thought our recipe was gone forever - I am so glad I found this.  This is a very flavorful dish with lots of sauce for the rice!  The green onions add a great color and freshness to this dish.

I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was way too salty for my taste buds. I think if I make it again I'll use half the soy sauce, and maybe more brown sugar and sesame oil. It wasn't even close to the mongolian beef that I've had in restaraunts, but I think I can doctor it up a bit and it'll be okay.

It was very good but not very spicy at all. I was worried that it would be too spicy because we marinated it for a day. The only substance the dish has is meat and green onions so i also added half of a yellow onion. Adding some carrots or broccoli would also probably be good.

This is a nice start to "Mongolian Beef" but is missing something...
I think it is hot bean sauce which you can find online if you can't find it at the store.

I was wondering how this recipe would come out if beef was substituted with chicken, since my family decided to cut down on red meat. Here are my modifications: take 3 large chicken breasts (4 pounds), separate in half, and slice each across in 1/2-inch thick pieces. Then marinate as described, but use low-salt soy sauce and double all amounts. 
Stir-fry green onions (add fresh rosemary), as in original recipe, set aside. Cook half of chicken and sauce, then the other half; keep adding more sherry in the process as the sauce becomes thicker. If you like spicy taste, keep chili peppers in; if you like it milder, take them out of sauce before cooking and dispose. 
Combine all together with cooked onions and heat through.  
Comes out very nice, sauce is thick and flavorful. I guess, garlic and ginger would increase taste, like suggested by other users.  Takes some time to prepare, but the taste is rewarding, costs less than the beef recipe, and final amount is enouch to feed large (and picky) family. Definitely will make again, and will try to modify further.

This was ok.  I felt the sauce was too thick and  overpowering in flavor.  It reminded me of Teri Tips which I prefer over this recipe (with a few modifications I made from the original recipe).  I doubt I'll make this again.

I was excited about trying this recipie but I was really disappointed. I concur with the comments of  NOVENAFILMS, the dish tasted mainly of soy sauce and like other reviewers tastes like it's missing an ingredient.  There are other recipies that use a velveting technique, use egg whites, dark soy which in my opinion approximate and surpass the restaurant experience. Unfortunately this recipie is quick and easy, but it really doesn't taste like mongolian beef.

This is a very good dish and finally I can make a dish that taste like what I have at a resturaunt.  This is also a fairly easy dish to make and even my two year old liked it.  We will make this again for sure.

I found the recipe is really good as is.  I don’t cook with salt and my husband loves the flavor/spice. He usually adds hot suave to most of my dishes but not this one.  Only thing I change is.. I only cook with olive oil and I use brown rice instead of white (white makes me sick).  I make the meat mixture and let it rest in the frig while the rice is cooks (45 minutes). When the rice cooker goes off I make the Mongolian Beef. It all comes out perfect!  I usually pick out the whole peppers but I usually lose one and warm everyone to watch out for the pepper!  No one has complained...yet!

My partner and I loved this recipe! It was very flavorful and spicy, and it was the perfect amount of food for us! I cut back on the cornstarch after reading some of the other reviews, which was a good call because the sauce was still pretty thick. We also used about half as many green onions because the amount called for seemed like a lot. I added a little bit of minced garlic and ground black pepper to add something extra. My partner thought it was still missing a little something, so next time we may use some ground ginger, as well. Overall it was tasty and I definitely plan to make it again!

I love the sauce in this recipe. Most Asian recipes I try don't have enough sauce, and it's bland. This sauce is crazy potent! (I do add Thai Bird chilies to it...!) Note to self - when you add the meat and sauce to the pan, turn it down a little, so the sauce stays more runny instead of cooking quickly and getting lumpy. I also add carrots and occasionally mushrooms. My husband LOVES this recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  It was OK, but not great.  I used chicken breast instead of beef, and followed another reviewer's comment about adding garlic, and ginger to the marinade, and added yellow onion wedges with the green onion.  I served it over brown rice.   I will try it again, using beef.  Green pepper might also give it more flavor and texture.

Love the sauce.  I add some water to it to thin it down just a little.  I also add garlic and play around with the veggies (I've added carrots, yellow onion, snap peas....  not all at the same time!)

After reading the reviews I added garlic to the marinade and grated ginger to the green onions. I also decreased the green onions to 3 bunches, which was about right. I decreased the cornstarch by a third, but will decrease it by half the next time. My husband enjoyed it saying "It's got some spice!" even though I left out the dried peppers. It was a good make ahead meal for a week night. I cooked the rice, sliced the beef and onion and mixed up the marinade the night before so it went to together pretty easily and quickly when I got home from work.

We really enjoyed this. I added sliced onions, red peppers, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and minced garlic. Next time, I would cut back on the corn starch because I had to add water to thin out the sauce.

I made it with a spoon roast, used all of the ingredients listed.  The only difference I baked it 15 minutes uncovered at 475 degrees and then covered it and reduced temp to 275 for 3 hours.  It was delish. I will definitely make it a keeper recipe!

I served this over a coconut basmati rice but thought it would be too spicy with the additional peppers....I was wrong! Next time I will add them and perhaps some big chunks of onion and a bit more brown sugar. Delicious flavour!

This is a good basic recipe.  I used a few of the other reviewers' suggestions in that I added ginger and garlic, reduced the cornstarch to 1 tbsp, and used vanilla instead of sherry (which I didn't have on hand).  I also added more veggies: thinly sliced bell peppers and onions, and broccoli.  This made it into a very tasty one-dish meal.  Good recipe!

It turned out really nice.
I made a few changes...
Spicy with red dried chillies.
Garlic and ginger
Sesame seeds
White onions cut into cubes
Orange bell peppers.

Would recommend to anyone.

I've got two suggestions, first for the sauce, add 2 cloves of minced garlic and then add 2 teaspoons of  minced fresh ginger, keep the juice that comes out and add it to the sauce as well as he ginger itself. Finally, add 1.5 teaspoons of hoisen sauce this will give it a slightly tangy flavor that is perfect, also add one cup of water and simmer it down.

Second suggestion is use some sliced baby portabella mushrooms, it goes the dish more depth and goes well overall. 

Happy eating!!

This ended up being quite tasty. Even my kids didn't turn their noses up at it, although the mild spice was a bit much for one boy's bland palate (serve with milk). I appreciated how this did not take much prep time the night before either (other than defrosting the beef).

This is the only marinade that I use for broccoli with beef now.  I use one pound of top sirloin, cut thinly, used 1 T of crushed red pepper, one bunch of green onions,cut down the oil to a few tablespoons, and did not use the dried peppers.  I also add about 2 tsp of fresh ginger and some sesame seeds at the end. Yummy!

I was looking for something to do with a sirloin tip roast that I had and found this recipe.  Oh my gosh - it was a salt bomb.  All I could taste was salt.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add carrots and mushrooms.  My husband and I couldn't even eat it. I even tried adding some beef broth in an attempt to save it, but that was useless.  I love Chinese food and usually am quite accepting of soy sauce, but this was ridiculous. Was there an error in the recipe in that it should have included some other liquid?

I used pork instead of beef, and reduced the peppers by half (was still quite spicy, but I don't like a lot of heat).  also added a good amount of fresh grated ginger cause I really like that flavor.  It is a regular on our menu.

I tried this recipe last night and it was awesome.  Restaurant quality. I changed it up a lil bit because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used white zin instead of sherry, I added garlic, sliced carrotts and celery and yellow onion julianne style instead of green onions and it turned out great.  Other reviewers thought the sauce was too thick so I used 2 tbsp cornstarch and it was perfect! It is not a soupy sauce, it is supposed to be a little thicker so it sticks to the meat.  My husband loved it and this recipe is a keeper. Good job!

had to fix this quite a bit. i already used half the cornstarch called for but the sauce still turned out very pasty.  i had to add quite a bit of water.  i also added ground ginger, garlic powder, cracked black pepper (omitted the pepper flakes) and a bit more sugar and sesame oil to suit my taste.

Yum, Yum! Great recipe. I loved it and so did my husband. The meat was so tender and delicious. I added granulated garlic and added water because while I was cooking it, it became thick. Next time I'll add 1 or 2 tblspns of cornstarch to an 8 serving dish. Besides that it is definately a keeper.

For some strange reason, I ran out of soy sauce and couldn't use the amount called for.  Even given that, I was happily surprised at how much it tasted like it was supposed to.   If I could get a good handle on chinese food, my husband would be thrilled.  This was a great start.

I love spicy food and added more red and chile peppers.  This recipe is a hit the original way!  I tried it with the added garlic and gingerroot it was different and good as well.  Thanks to all you creative cooks!

Good recipe. I modified it slightly:

I used stew meat, sauteed it in the sesame oil with leeks and then added the sauce, with stevia powder instead of brown sugar. I adde some water and cooked it in the pressure cooker for 20 min., then added more wine, water and the cornstarch and to make a nice gravy, and served it over egg nooddles (tagliatelle). It was excellent that way.

This was quick, good and very easy to clean up.  I would suggest using less oil when cooking the meat.  Other than that I would just alter the ingredients to your liking!

I wasn't a big fan of this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but felt it was a little bland.  I won't be making this again.

This is a wonderful recipe, my sister and I have both cooked this many times...we usually double the recipe, but still stick to the 2 pounds of beef.  There is so much meat with 2 pounds that with 4 there would just be too much.  Plus in my house we add a head of fresh broccoli, fresh mushrooms, and a few pea pods for some extra greens.
It adds a little more freshness, to a already wonderful dish.

We really liked this, the only thing I would do next time is add mushrooms and maybe some other veggies.  I didn't use as much oil as the recipe called for.  Very good though!

Wow!  This was fantastic!!!  I used 2 bunches of green onions and 1/2 a wedged sweet yellow onion.  I also used 1" of grated ginger and 3 cloves of pressed garlic. I added a sprinkle of Adolph's to the meat while it was cooking.  I also added fresh broccoli when the onions were returned to the meat mixture.  The only thing I will do differently next time is that instead of using crushed red pepper from a bottle, I will crush my own.  We like it HOT!  Great dish!

This was wonderful and was a big hit with the family. I followed the recipe, only substituting Merlot for the sherry and adding some fresh pressed ginger. As it was getting close to done, I let some fresh broccoli cook in. Highly recommended!

Quick, easy & delicious... with a few changes:  I use 1 bunch of green onions (chopped), 1 stalk of celery (chopped) & 1 tablespoon minced garlic.  I also use less oil.  I find it works great with just enough oil to coat the bottom of the wok.

I made this recipe last night and the family really liked it.  I made a few modifications which I think added to the overall flavour.  I added ginger and three cloves of garlic.  I also steamed aspargus along with the onions.  We had it over rice noodles. I would make this again.

This is the best home-made recipe I've run across for this dish.  My family thought I'd gone out for Chineese take-out!
