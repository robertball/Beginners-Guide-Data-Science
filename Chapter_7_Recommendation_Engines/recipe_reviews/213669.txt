Dont you hate it when people rate a recipe with a low rating and they obviously didnt make the dish? If you think 1 cup of whipping cream is too much that is fine you dont have to make the dish. BUT That is not a reason to give it a low rating. I found this dish to be just about perfect. The seasoning was great and the taste was delicious! Thank you for much! I will make this again.

My family like my leaner version of this.  I used ground turkey and used evaporated milk where the recipe called for whipping cream. Also, added a little bit of canola oi/butter to wet my flour after I browned the meatballs(not as much fat in turkey as in beef).Good recipe!

Wonderful exactly as written. I was a little worried about the lack of seasoning in the sauce, but the drippings from the meatballs flavor it perfectly. I served over egg noodles.

A delicious comfort food.  Reminds me of Swedish meatballs, which I adore.  As the previous reviewer said, this recipe tastes great exactly as written.  Will make it again....and again...and again!

As written, an instant family favorite--I second the other review that says nothing needs to be changed. The whole family (husband, children 3 and 1, and myself) wanted seconds. Tasty, economical comfort food. Can't wait to make it again!

To eliminate the cream and milk  - brown the meatballs in olive oil - 1 tbsp. Remove them, then melt 1tbsp butter in pan, sprinkle on 2 tbsp flour & stir well. Cook for a couple of minutes, then slowly whisk in approx. 400ml of hot beef stock(from  a cube works well). This gives you a nice thick gravy. Return meatballs to pan and cook through. I use turkey mince also and they are good with cranberry jelly, greens and mash.

Yummy! I was distracted and forgot the bread crumbs but the meatballs turned out great anyway - delicate and melted in my mouth! I did add a little salt, pepper and 1/4 tsp of allspice to the gravy as I like a little more spice. Next time, I'll make some lefse too! :)

Tuli suorastaan koti-ikava naita syodessani! This was fantastic, and very authentic (I grew up eating these meatballs). Even with a few "leaner modifications" the meatballs melted in my mouth. I used Jenny-O turkey, panko bread crumbs and lowfat evaporated milk. Served with mashed potatoes and beets...kids asked if we could have this everyday. Kiitos, kiitos!

These are easy to make, I had all the ingredients in the house, and they were amazing.
Pretty much exactly like Swedish köttbullar.
I added potatoes, and forgot the veggies, but that was okay. :D
Everyone loved them and they were gone in no time!
I made them start to finish in a classic cast iron skillet. Little mess and little cleanup. I will definitely be making these again.

Excellent! Very easy to make! This is a five-star without any changes. My kids complained about the onions even though it was minced. Next time I will just put onion powder. I would prefer to make smaller meatballs next time, like the size you find at IKEA. We put the meatballs and gravy over the mashed potatoes. Everyone loved it!

My Irish dad made the best Swedish Meatballs ever....better than my Swedish mother-in-law's.  These bought me home!  I'm glad I waited a day to rate, because they're better the next day!  I don't like to "tweak" recipes before trying them out "as is", but I did use the beef/pork/veal blend.  Will make these over and over.

Sorry. I did not care for this. I followed the recipe except for substituting evaporated milk for the cream. The breadcrumb meat ratio is too high. It was basically a tasteless meal. I thought the allspice would carry it, but it needed a lot more spices.

This was delicious! I tried to follow the recipe as close as possible. I wasn't sure how salty it would be so I reduced the salt to one teaspoon. I also used 1/4 cup cream in the meatball mixture and found it worked perfectly. Side note to say I made this in my instant pot! I sautéed the meatballs on low, then added 1 cup of milk. I switched it over to manual low pressure for 15 minutes. Quick released, removed the meatballs- whisked in 1 Tbsp flour and cream until thick and smooth. OMG I'm so glad this recipe was spotlighted for me...yum yum!!!

The meatballs had a decent flavor, but nothing spectacular.  The mix of breadcrumbs and cream was too much for the amount of meat.  The meatballs came out mushy and bready, not really the texture of meat at all.  The sauce was really bland.

The meatballs were very delicious, but the   sauce lacked  flavor and was floury tasting. I think the next time I make this recipe I'll add salt and pepper and possibly a can of cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup instead of the second 1/2 cup of cream.

Delicious!  So easy to make, my four year old helped.  What a great find.  Rich and savory.  Reminds me a bit of Baltic- Russian cuisine.

We liked these meatballs which we served on orzo. A couple of adjustments to the recipe: added a clove of minced garlic to the meat mixture believing that garlic improves everything (except maybe chocolate cake); used 1 cup beef stock and 1 cup milk for the sauce. Next time I may use sour cream instead of heavy cream - more like strogonof. Very Tasty.

I love meatballs, but this seemed very thick & greasy.  If you could thin out the sauce a little it would be much more appealing.

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could :-) I made this last night & it was very good.  The meatballs were succulent & delicious.  The only mistake I made was to substitute plain yoghurt for the cream - don't do that, it curdled in a bad way!  I think I might try low-fat sour cream next time to maintain the texture, but lessen the fat a bit.  Also, I didn't have allspice, so I used a beef boillion packet.  I'll try the allspice next time.  This is going to be a regular family meal in our house!

Tasty, but it took a lot longer than I had anticipated to make and cook the meatballs and gravy.  The mixture was very soft and sticky as well, so it was tricky making them hold their shape.

Absolutely delicious! I used ground chicken and just added a little more butter and flour at the cream stage to offset the lack of beef fat in the pan. This one is in my recipe box.

I'm a "newly fledged" adult. (If my parents are empty nesters, that makes me a fledgling, right?) I make this all the time now. It's great. I use turkey instead of beef and used the gravy recipe from one of the comments to reduce the fat. I also don't cook the meatballs in the gravy since I like to freeze them and save for days I don't feel like cooking. And I don't like onions, so I don't use that either. The allspice flavor is wonderful!

This recipe is great! I have made it twice in the past two weeks as I am going through a meatball phase. They are very soft due to the cream. The gravy is just a basic béchamel, and I seasoned it with allspice for something different.

These are quite similar to the ones I grew up with. The only differences I make are: less salt in the meat, less allspice and add fresh black pepper. I also add salt and cracked black pepper to the gravy and a little dry red wine doesn't hurt either.  These are delicious. : )

Hyvää! I am a novice in the kitchen and this was easy to make. I added some beef Knorr Fond du Chef to make the sauce. The sauce was a bit to thick and I also added water to thin it out to our preference. Good recipe, my Finnish bf loved it!

I absolutely love this dish, and so does everyone I feed it too. The Allspice really makes it. Although I have never used the whopping cream in this dish, always just the milk we have in the fridge, it turns out delectable every time.

This recipe was very good.  I too was worried about the minimal seasoning/ingredients for the sauce, but it turned out delicious.  My coworkers always expect me to bring my leftovers to work, and they enjoyed this.  Served over egg noodles.  Thanks.

These turned out wonderful!  I was a little apprehensive before I made these as all other meatballs I have made have crumbled apart.  However, these were perfect.  Wonderful flavoring, stayed intact, and smothered with a creamy sauce.  I put these over chapatis with a side dish of cranberry sauce - perfect Sunday brunch.  Oh, I also took another reviewer's suggestion and used evaporated milk in place of whipping cream; turned out nice and thick.

Meatballs were good - but only with a different sauce. Did NOT like the gravy! It was very bland even after adding alot of seasonings.  Think the meatballs would be good with more a stroganoff or even spaghetti type sauce.

I did like this recipe.  If I made it again I would have to change some things.  The meatballs were to salty with the 2 tsp, I would only add half that and then add to the sauce to taste.  Also, some reviews about the sauce being bland were correct.  Maybe some garlic, pepper and a little something else to spice it up. Be careful not to cook the meatballs to long, all the onion in the meatballs nearly burned on me.

I wasn't very happy with the results of this.  The meatballs were very tender but the sauce was very bland.  I had to put extra salt and pepper in and then I had to mix up one cup of water with 1 tsp of beef bullion and mixed that into the sauce and that helped, but it still was missing something.  I will keep looking for a better sauce recipe.

I tried one of the meatballs before making the gravy. The matballs have a lot of flavor, though there is a LOT of salt in there. Probably more than there needs to be.  As one poster noted, it is a very soft meatball so you do have to let them cook pretty well on one side before even trying to turn the meatball during browning so it sets up....but that is typical for a Swedish type meatball...it is supposed to be softer than an Italian meatball.  My problems came once the cream sauce was added. (I used 1/2 and 1/2 and not cream to cut down the fat content). The sauce was too bland for me. I added a little white pepper as one poster suggested. That was still a bit too bland so I added some fresh ground black  pepper too. I prefer the Swedish meatballs which are very similar for "the ball" but the sauce made with beef and sour cream has more flavor. Overall for the high fat and salt content....didn't like them enough/bland sauce to be worth the heart attack on a plate with sodium and fat content.

I hate it when it appears I am the only one that doesn't like something, but I know taste and likes differ for each individual.   I make Swedish meatballs all the time.  I/family like the Swedish MeatBall recipe much better.  I did not like the sauce with this recipe. It did not have much of a taste. I felt I was eating meatballs with cream gravy. Anyway, I tried it and you never know until you try something. I won't be making it again, but don't want to be so negative to stop someone else from trying it.

No one in my family cared for this recipe.  Sauce didn't have much flavor until I made changes and all we could taste in the meatballs was allspice.

IT SOUNDS LOVELY, BUT 1/4 WHIPPING CREAM PER PERSON SOUNDS A BIT OVERBOARD.  ANYTHING TASTES GREAT WITH THAT MUCH CREAM!
