I whipped this up as soon as I saw it in the "newest recipes" this morning, then let it sit in the fridge until I made lunch. For lunch today, I used it as a spread for BLT (turkey bacon) sandwiches. Dude, this is freaking AMAZING. This really made our BLT sandwiches 10x better.

Way too much mayonnaise! I had been to a local restaurant recently where they had a delicious horseradish / dijon sauce on their roast beef sliders so I came home and looked for a similar recipe. I thought this had promise but made it with only a cup of mayo (keep all other ingredients the same) and ended up having to add a LOT more of everything else to balance out the flavors. I really wanted something where you could taste the dijon mustard and horseradish but "as written" it just tasted like mayonnaise and not much else. I am trying it again, but this time only with 1/2 cup mayo and all other ingredients as written, so hopefully this time it won't taste like slightly doctored mayonnaise.

I made this to jazz up some leftover grilled pork tenderloin that I made into sandwiches.  I thought it could use a little more horseradish, but Hubs liked it just as written.  I may make some zucchini patties and try it on those.

AWESOME!  There are so many uses for this recipe that I didn't hesitate to make the whole thing.  I do believe it will "keep" in the refrigerator a long time; however, I am sure it won't be around long...it is that good!  Tonight I served it with Avon's "Ham Cake-ettes".   It was perfect!  Thank you sanzoe for sharing such an AWESOME recipe!

This is a delicious and creamy topping to use on ‘Ham Cake-ettes’ another AR recipe.  I also found it added flavor to regular ham sandwiches and to my egg sandwich.  I think this would be a great addition to tuna salad or egg salad.  Love the taste of these 4 ingredients and can find many ways to use it.  Thanks sanzoe for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and added a bit more horseradish. Definitely make this an hour or 2 (atleast) before you plan on using it to allow the flavors to blend. I will be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made half of this for smaller group and really only halved the mayo.  Other ingredients I sort of 3/4’d.  It was wonderful with some freshly made crabcakes we get at our local butcher/seafood shop.  I will definitely file this under a regular recipe in my book!

The base is decent. Way too much mayonnaise. Next time I’ll make it with sour cream instead of mayo.

So much better than just using plain mayo or plain mustard on a sandwich. Loved the combined flavors.

I made this for turkey burgers, and we liked it. I think it would be good on a variety of things. I tripled the amount of horseradish and added a dash of cayenne pepper. Someone suggested lemon juice in their review, and I think I'd like to try that.

I doubled the horseradish - and probably could have added more. This was great with a roast beef panini. It was better the 2nd day after letting everything mingle together for a day.

Tweaked it a bit...used honey mustard instead of dijon.  Just like the famous stone crab restaurant in Miami uses!
