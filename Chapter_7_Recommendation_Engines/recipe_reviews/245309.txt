I'm a little biased as I don't care for white meat but my fiance' liked it which was a bonus. It was actually very juicy because I cooked it for 40 minutes and let carryover cooking do the rest. Made a few changes based on preferences and what I had in the house: 1. Plain pork loin butterflied and pounded to 1/2" thick then sprinkled with salt pepper and granulated garlic and onion. 2. Omitted pecans and used dried cherries. 3. Omitted butter and used all the bacon fat. 4. Once I removed the bacon I sauteed onions and garlic before adding apples cherries stuffing etc to pan. 5. Used apple juice instead of apple cider. Fiance's suggestions were to remove the cherries use more stuffing and sprinkle with brown sugar before putting it in the oven. Will try again with his ideas and see how it goes. I enjoyed the flavor immensely and will be doing this again using a dark meat like duck breast or chicken thighs.

I decided to try a version of this for our Thanksgiving dinner cause we are not Turkey lovers and I was looking for something that would not leave us with too many left overs. I did make some adjustments and improvs to it but followed the recipe in general. First of all I used a rolled/tied pork roast instead of the pork tenderloin. When I took the pork roast out of the string mesh it was already split about in half so what I ended up with was basically two halves of a pork roast. What I did was place them in large baking pan with space in between for the stuffing. I put the stuffing in the center space pushed everything together a little and covered it all with the bacon slices. For the stuffing mix I added the bacon crumbles diced apples and some diced yams. (It was fantastic-my daughter is not a stuffing person and she gave it huge thumbs up!) Because I used a larger pork roast it did need to roast longer- I cooked it covered with foil for about 1 hour then added remaining apple chunks and yams with a small amount of spiced apple cider over them. Recovered baked for another 1/2 hour then removed foil and baked for additional 20 minutes. Be sure to use meat thermometer so you don't over cook it! I turned out fantastic!

The whole family enjoyed this one. The meat was moist and delicious and the cornbread stuffing was a great addition.

Used Pork tenderloin. Cut off the last few inches to square it off. Split and pounded to about 1/4" then added stuffing and rolled. Tied up with butchers twine to keep together better. Pre cooked bacon about 50% then wrapped around stuffed tenderloin. Baked as directed but shortened the time by about 10 minutes due to thin pounded pork. Frikkin awesome. top 3 recipes on my extensive list.

It was very tasty! We used a pork tenderloin. The apple cider gave a great taste in the stuffing mixture. I used only one cut up bacon strip in the stuffing mixture since I figured there was so much bacon in the wrapping. Loved it!

Delicious!  Really really good!  The only thing I changed is that I flattened & stuffed the pork loin. 
And then I used toothpicks to hold it back together after stuffing.  Then I took the rest of the stuffing and put on top.
So YUMMY!  I only roasted for 30 min (perfect timing) and I put a little aluminum foil tent over the top after about 15 min so it didn't burn.
Highly recommended!
