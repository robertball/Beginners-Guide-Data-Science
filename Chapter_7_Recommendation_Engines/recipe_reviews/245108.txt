I added cucumber but followed the recipe otherwise. It was fantastic with the balsamic dressing I made from scratch. This was the first time I've used farro and it has a delicious nutty flavor on its own.

We made this multiple times this summer and served this dish to guests. I highly recommend it! It's refreshing and satisfying.

Great recipe!  Only my 2nd time cooking farro (which I found in Whole Foods).  I made this without the mozzarella to keep it dairy-free and it was still great!  I used 1-1/2 T each olive oil and balsamic and that was just right.  The fresh basil is critical (you could get away with a bit less).

Delicious!! My husband and I are trying to eat healthier so I made this Farro salad for lunch today. I have food allergies so I omitted the nuts. I used ciliegine (small cherry size mozzarella balls) which worked out fantastically!! I also made my own balsamic dressing. Thank you SunnyDay for a healthy Farro recipe! Definitely  will be making this again a strong my garden yields more basil & tomatoes.

Everyone in my family, including my 6 and 9 year old love this.  I have made it several times exactly as the recipe states.  I did omit the onion this last time as I didn’t have it.

Adding Farro to the traditional Caprese salad offers fiber, protein.  It was a wonderful side to Saturday football games.  Everyone really liked the salad.

Really fun side salad and an easy introduction to farro for folks who haven't tried it yet.    Personally I wanted more tomato/cheese/dressing to the farro ratio.
