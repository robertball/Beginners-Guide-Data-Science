Extremely easy and so good! I made a small batch, in a 10x7 pan. The pan held 4 whole sheets of graham crackers. Only, used 4 Tbl butter and 4 Tbl brown sugar. Then baked for 5-7 minutes until it was all bubbly(make sure to check on it, so it won't burn). Then used 2 hershey bars on top and spread evenly.  Sprinkled with toffee bits.  Would be great to take to a party or special event.

So simple and delicious.  I used all butter. (Not sure why you would use half margarine)  I love pecans but was running short so I used half English walnuts chopped fine.  I baked it for 5 minutes in a convection oven.  It turned out great.  Will make again.

Wonderful!  I don't like pecans so I substituted toffee bits instead.  Perfect!  Turned out great and it was gone in no time!

We loved this recipe.  I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup. When I removed from the oven, I sprinkled 6 oz. of chocolate chips over the top and allowed them to melt and then spread over the top.  After the bars had cooled for about two hours, I lifted the foil out of the pan and sliced into squares.  Ooey, gooey delights! Thanks, Haresj for sharing your recipe :)

I used cinnamon crackers. Was good but I wouldn’t use them again. The toffee is delicious!

These were everyone's new favorite at Christmas this year.  I broke the graham crackers in half and pressed them right up against each other on the cookie sheet before pouring the mixture.  If you have room for 28 crackers on your sheet, the thickness of the topping will be just right.
