For the graham cracker crust, try dipping the martini glass edge in lime juice and then into a container of finely powdered graham crackers.  It is like adding the salt to a margarita - the finishing touch!!

For me, using Smirnoff Whipped Vodka is really the way to go. It gives it that creamy texture I think this drink is missing.

Oh my,yes!  The graham cracker crumbs on the rim of the glass is a stroke of genius!  I served these as dessert at a cookout party with lime ribs, and am now extremely popular with all my friends and DH.  Made a giant pitcher of them, and had to make another one for seconds.  Definitely something fun and unusual.

Pretty good- but for a few easier changes, just use vanilla vodka, it is a lot smoother than regular vodka with the added vanilla extract. I also added a tablespoon of half n half for an ultimate smooth key lime taste!

Great summer drink!  I made twice the amount and it was enough for 6 people to have one drink.

This was great.  I had minimal ingredients and a friend coming over for a cocktail and it was a hit. Now I have a reason to buy vanilla extract in bulk.  Thanks for a simple easy recipe.  I didn't have any limes so I did without but I would only imagine that it would make it better.  They definitely go down a little too easy but considering the vodka to limeaid ratio I knew what I was getting myself into.

Maybe I did something wrong with these--I didn't think that they tasted at all like the pie nor did they taste good at all.

LOVE this recipe and so does everyone who tries the Key Lime Pie-tinis.  The crushed graham crackers on the rim is a must.  I have made this recipe at least a dozen times in the past few months.  The only change I make is to cut the vodka down to 3 ounces.

I knew this was going to be sour so I dipped the rim of my martini glass in sugar. This did not taste like key lime pie to me.

Actually, they have made the whole thing, graham cracker crust and all in a liqueur. It's Ke Ke Beach. White bottle with a green top. Only 30 proof so great straight up as an apertif!

Careful - these go down so smoothly!  Would add more lime juice to cut some of the sweetness of the limeade.  Love the graham crackers!

I happened to have vodka and frozen lime juice and searched for a drink recipe because tired of cranberry. I didn't have fresh limes, added a little Reallime juice (not ideal), so I was so pleased with how good these martini's tasted! ... and they look tasty, too! Like the graham cracker suggestion. Next time.
