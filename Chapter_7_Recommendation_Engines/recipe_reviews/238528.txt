To be perfectly frank, this recipe seemed strange to me, but it piqued my curiosity. I couldn't imagine putting the almond butter and the blueberries together. But strangely enough, the flavor was good! Both flavors came through without too much competition from each other. I used frozen blueberries and added the 2 ice cubes as well. Nice and thick and cold, just the way I like my smoothies.

I had to add more almond butter and a splash of agave in order to like it. I did not care for it as written and I will more than likely not make it again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I will be making this a lot. Blueberries are my favorite fruit and it is yummy with my almond butter that I also found through All Recipes. I did not put in the protein powder, but I may try that in the future. Thanks for sharing; I am going to pass it on to  my coaches at NutriMost.

Loved this and will make again! I made a few small changes,  I used a tablespoon of almond butter, 1 C almond milk and a full scoop of protein powder, plus a bit more berries. :)

Perfection. This is definitely being added to my smoothie rotation. I omitted chia seeds because I did not have any but otherwise followed the recipe.
