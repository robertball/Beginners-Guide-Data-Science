This was great but I can make it even easier for you. Skip step 2 altogether. The beans don't need heated. And, you can skip the dry ingredients in step 4. The chorizo has plenty of flavor (almost overpowering actually) and you just don't need it. This was excellent and one I've already recommended to friends. The leftovers hold up and re-heat good too which is always a bonus!
