The hardest part is zesting and juicing the orange, which is really no sweat!  I brought these to a party and they were the first dessert to go! Everyone thought that they were pumpkin, though! I used baby food carrots because they are already cooked and mashed...much easier!  Really yummy, but a little sticky...

I had a hard time rating this since I modified it a bit. Because of the complaints about the glaze, I used the Simple Orange Glaze from this site instead of making the glaze called for in the recipe. I followed the cake part to a T. The cake itself is not all that sweet, but it is good. Without the glaze it has more of a muffin taste than a dessert. I gave it 4 stars based on how I made it, with an alternative glaze, not based on the recipe as written with cake and glaze. I'd probably give the cake alone 3 stars.

I think this has way too much glaze.  I'd probably cut the confectioner's sugar down to 1 cup, maybe even 3/4 cup.  The glaze just puddled on top of the bars in the dish.  I ended up taking a skewer and poking holes in the top so that it could penetrate the cake.  The bars are really sticky, but I think that's just because there's so much glaze IMO.  To my surprise, there wasn't a whole lot of carrot flavor in this, and I don't think it would hurt to add some finely shredded carrot to the batter.  The predominant flavor is orange.   FYI, it took about five medium carrots to yield 1 cup of mashed carrot.  The coconut adds a nice texture to these very moist and rich bars.

This recipie was delicious, I made it in a smaller pan so it turned out more of a cake.  The cake itself is such a lovely taste, definitly a winner.  My only negative is the 'icing' don't get me wrong, its one of the best icings ive tasted, but it was runny. I think next time I will add double the icing sugar.

These are horrible.  A doughy, lumpy, mess.  Not a cookie, really, just a flat plank of not very tasty un-risen cake, with a runny orange glaze.  Don't waste your money or your time.
