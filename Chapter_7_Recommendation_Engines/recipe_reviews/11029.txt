This is the No Bake cookie recipe I grew up with minus the raisins.  Be sure to boil at a full rolling boil for the 1 minute or they will not harden.  If that does happen, have fun eating with a spoon. (Can you tell it happens to me every once in a while?  I also live in a humid climate and that might contribute to those times).

Great consistency.  They firmed up with just 10 min. in the freezer.  My only complaint is that 2 c. sugar is too much.  Even though I reduced to 1 c. sugar (and I have a sweet tooth), it was still too sweet (even though I used no sugar added organic peanut butter).  Next time I will try with only 2/3 c. sugar.

I've made this twice now and still am not totally happy with the results. Making as is results in a WAY too sweet cookie that crumbles everywhere. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added a little extra peanut butter the second time and they came out better, though the trick seems to be that you have to roll these into compact balls or else they fall apart.

Boil too long...crumbly.  Boil too short, eat 'em with a spoon.  I used 1/2 regular cocoa and 1/2 Hersheys SPECIAL DARK cocoa and skipped the raisins.  Very Good!

Was making these for a bunch of serious choco-holics, so I added half a cup of chocolate chips and omitted the raisins, and they rocked!  Very fudgey... totally a keeper!

Followed other users advice and cut the sugar in half, but also went all brown sugar.  (I like it rich.)  My 3 yr old says, 'Dat tast-es good'.  I couldn't have said it better - YUM!

First of all, the taste of these was excellent. However, they didn't turn out well. I used 2% milk, a fresh jar of PB, fresh canister of oats, fresh can of cocoa, Watkins vanilla and Land o Lakes margarine. I omitted the raisins. I boiled this exactly one minute and maybe an extra 5 seconds while I was taking off the heat. After I stirred it all together and went to drop them on the wax paper they did not spread out at all. Nothing. They acted like they needed more liquid. They are now very crumbly. I can't figure out what I did wrong.

My hubby made these for me. He omitted the raisins. I can't imagine them being as good with them in. These cookies were delicious. Very chocolately and fudgey! Must try!

Great recipe. It is very similar to one I grew up making (minus the raisins). This cookie is more candy than cookie and therefore you must be patient when making it. If you rush the cooking stage it will cause a crumbling mess. You must heat the ingredients slowly over a low heat until it comes to a full boil and then continue to cook for 1 minute. That should ensure nearly perfect cookies every time.

Great little sweet treat. I liked the idea of adding the raisins too. I used chunky pb. Thanks for a great treat, my son is taking these on the bus trip as snacks to share with friends after the football game. He sampled (quite a few) and gladly packed up a baggie full to share with his fellow classmates/band members.

We followed the recipe closely, cutting the recipe in half and we used a quarter cup of coarsely crushed salted peanuts instead of raisins. (My oldest boy and I made this together.) We dropped them on the wax paper and let them sit in the fridge for about a half hour--that's as long as they could stand it. Turned out pretty well. I did not have one myself but the kids raved about them. NOTE: From someone who's made these before and used a cheap peanut butter, DON'T DO THAT. Use a name brand. You don't want to skimp, they will not turn out and you'll be cranky over wasted ingredients.

I leave out the raisins. And if they seem a little dry, add a few tablespoons of milk.

These are great.  When I was a child, my mom left out the peanut butter, used 2 C oats and added 1 C coconut & kept the raisins.  She'd also make them with about 1 C chopped pecans.  Yum!

Wow! I'm rating this recipe just on the "dough" itself!  Awesome! Just the right amount of everything.  The peanut butter does not overpower it, just enhances the flavour!

I LOVE them! I tweaked by using skim milk, half-ed the sugar(brown sugar to make them richer tasting), margarine, used heaping tbs of cocoa, upped the vanilla a bit and omitted the raisins. I stirred all the ingredients together to cook except for the oatmeal to get a smoother texture and make sure everything was well combined. I added the oatmeal last. Put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes if you want to eat them sooner! DELICIOUS. It totally ruined my diet! =]

this is the recipe my family loves, minus the raisins. I add the cocoa with the sugar and butter and milk. Bring to a boil for 1 minute,  take off heat, add PB, vanilla, and oats. I never have to roll them as they drop just fine. If it gets to thick or crumbly then it was cooked too long.

This recipe is great... I love the peanut butter to cocoa powder ratio! Sometimes we add a little more PB and oats depending on our mood. Raisins are never used, hubby is picky, but I'd like to try these with some dried cranberries! YUM! Super fast, super easy and delicious!

Perfect, just omit the raisins. Just be careful of the under or over boiling as it will cause them to be under done or over done and crumbly. These are so good you'll have to give most of them away so you won't eat them all!

Hands Down the best no bake recipe I have tried! I did omit the raisins due to personal taste but this recipe is quick and easy. I used to have trouble getting my cookies to set but I have made six batches with this recipe and all have set perfectly!

I am so happy I found this recipe! My mother always made these cookies since I can remember. And when she passed away last year I thought the recipe was lost forever because noone in my family knew it. I had never known of any other person that made these cookies or even heard of them. And then I came across this recipe, Thank You So Much! Cooking them brings very happy memories and eating them too!!! This recipe is PERFECT, just like hers were!

These were such a hit at my Bible study! At the end of the night, I had about 10 people come up to me wanting the recipe. They were very simple to make and tasted absolutely delicious. Thank you!!

I made this with what I had in the house, so:
1 cup coconut palm sugar
1/2 cup soy milk
no butter
1/2 cup peanut butter
2 cups not quick cooking oats (whatever is between quick and steel cut)
6 TBS dark unsweetened cocoa powder
1 t vanilla
no raisins

It was SWEEEET! Super sweet. I ended up plopping the mixture down on a pan and sticking it in the freezer. The texture is great! Just a little (ok a lot) too sweet for me.

Amazing!!! I have had similar cookies before, but there was no raisins. Raisins=Genius! I followed the directions exactly except the milk (We were out or else I would have used regular milk), I used Vanilla Soy Milk. I was really worried, but they turned out GREAT!!! :)

I got this recipe last week and I have made them 4 times already (trying to perfect before Christmas) Everyone loves them! For extra Chocolate flavor I omitted the raisins and added a 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.

These are absolutely delicious! My husband and I love them! I didn't have any nuts to mix in but I did have crunchy peanut butter, which I think worked just as well. At Christmas I just might add some peppermint and cart these around to family shindigs. Thanks alot for the great recipe!

These are delicious! While some complain about the sweetness, I found them to be much less sweeter than any store bought alternative. 
These are rich and yummy! Very easy to make, and take no time. 
I did not have milk on hand, but had Half & Half, I added a little water, and they've come out wonderfully! Oh I also omitted the raisins (not a fan of raisins). 
All in all, definitely a new favorite recipe! A life saver for my sweet tooth!

Nearly same as my original recipe that I lost.  I do not add raisins and am thinking of upping the cocoa.  I love chocolate flavor.  My son is raving and everyone at my family picnic loved em.

My go to no bake cookie recipe. They turn out great every time. Don't over boil, 1 minute, no longer or they will be chalky. Never tried them with raisins, doesn't sound appetizing to me.

I love these!  I don't care much for raisins so I leave those out.  I do add 1t salt when I add the peanut butter.  I like to use smooth peanut butter but both types are good.

I make these and instead of taking the time too make them into cookies, I pat them into a 9x13  buttered pan and cut them into bars. patting them into the pan also helps hold them together.  no raisins in mine tho

This is the first time I've made these myself. I loved them. The taste was rich and very smooth. I did alter the recipe a bit, I used 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, 1 tablespoon of vanilla and a half a cup more oats than was called for. I'm not good with timing so I cooked the milk, sugar and butter at a hard boil for a minute or a little over. I also split up the batter and made half with raisins half without because my family is picky. Since the raisins on this recipe was measured for the whole recipe I added what I thought was enough. When I started spooning it was a tiny bit runny but as the rest in the pan was waiting to be spooned it started to slowly thicken which told me I made it correctly. Again I loved this recipe. Quick, convenient and tasty!

Instead of raisins I added a hand full of each flaked coconut and chopped almonds. Very easy and satisfies chocolate craving! I also reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups.

Love this recipe.  I make it using old fashioned rolled oats and omit the raisins.  I use baking cookie scoop to put them on cookie sheets as soon as the ingredients are mixed together and are really soft.  They only take about 20 minutes to set up to perfection.

I personally find that the simplicity of this recipe is what made me like these the most. Not only were they super easy to make, but they also tasted excellent. Granted, I ended up not using the raisins or the oats because I had the wrong kind of oats and nobody in my family is fond of raisins, but I still think they turned out rather well!

The consistency was good.  I followed the advice of other reviews and halved the sugar.  That was a big mistake!  These cookies were gross because of that.

Very rich and delicious. Cook on lower heat. Start timing when boil cannot be stirred down. Cook exactly 1 minute...do not overlook!!! I used crunchy honey roasted peanut butter and also added chocolate chips. They were yummy and a big hit at our house! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Today I tried both this recipe and the No Bake Cookie V recipe.  Hands down, this one is the one I prefer!  I only used one cup of sugar and dark chocolate cocoa powder and omitted the raisins.  I've learned with these cookies, you MUST bring the mixture to a "rolling boil" and I let it stay there for about a minute and a half.  I used extra crunchy peanut butter.  Turned out perfect!

keep the 2 cups of sugar (it is what helps it set properly) but increase PB to 1 cup, and cocoa to 1/4 cup to balance it out.

These cookies are FANTASTIC.  The peanut butter/chocolate combination is just right.  You can't eat just one.

I make them exactly as stated.  Any variation will mess up the texture of the cookie.  Expect these to be very sweet like candy.  What do you expect?  There is nearly as much sugar as there is grain!  It's delicious, easy, cheap, and naturally Gluten Free.
