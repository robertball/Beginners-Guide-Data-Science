This recipe didn't work for me - after chilling the logs it never held together and was crumbly mess.  This doesn't deserve to be on anybodys list!

This recipe did NOT work. I thought a pound of butter in a recipe this size sounded like a lot.
The first tray of cookies burned before the time frame given. There after they did not burn, but
they crumbled horribly when handled. It was hard
to lift them off the pan without breaking, and the ones that did come out whole crumbled when lifting out of the container. It makes good crumbs but not a recipe for anyone who want to make nice cookies for gifts.

Actually I had no problem with these cookies.  The dough came together very nicely.  Baked, they had a nice crumbly/soft texture. I gave them to a couple people last year as xmas gifts and they were hits.

We spell Bryssel! Try 2 1/4 cups flour and 200 grams butter. You can also roll the cakes in coloured sugar. It's the usual.

I didn't care for this recipe. There is a LOT of butter in the cookies and doesn't hold after chilling. The cooking then either burns them or won't cook.
