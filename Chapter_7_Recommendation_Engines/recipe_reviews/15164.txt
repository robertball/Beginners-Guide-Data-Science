This is the most awesome dip I have ever eaten! I must admit that it doesn't look so appetizing, but if you get your guests to try just one bite, they're hooked!  Thanks for the recipe!

Ok - as far as *unappealing* count me in there - very unattractive dip when finished.  I too used half the amount of ranch dressing and it was good - I think the whole pack would have overwhelmed the rest.  Recipe as is was ok - but seemed to be missing *something* - VERY much improved with the addition of a bit more cheese and a small can of chopped green chiles.  All in all - can't be beat for speed, great for snacking in front of the tv with the family, but not a *company* dish.

I loved it but the comments coming back to me was the ranch dressing was too overpowering and it didn't look appetizing.  Next time I'll use half a package of dressing.  I like the idea of some chopped green onions added.  It would give it better color than just a brown blob in the bowl.

This is excellent. I could not stop eating it. Thanks to other reviewers, I added half the amount of dressing mix and it was perfect. I also mixed everything in a crockpot and just let it cook in that (I brought it to a work party). The first thing someone asked me was "What's in this?" Definitely will make again!

Used 1/2 buttermilk ranch, added a little more cheese and red food coloring to brighten the color.  Awesome dip.

I loved this dip! I t tastes like you're dipping ranch doritos into bean dip. I added a bit more cheese. I agree that it doesn't look too appetizing but the taste changed my mind. My frinds all loved it too!

It tasted good and was easy to make
but looked very un-appetizing.  I had 
trouble eating it, just by the way it 
looked

I served in a chaffing dish.  For a garnish, I sprinkled shredded provolone cheese, a bit more chedder (to give it that multi colored melted cheese look) and finely diced green onions and let them all "float" on the top.  It made a nice presentation.  As the day went on, it was also easy to "re-garnish" the dish.

I really like how simple this is and how addictive! Made this last weekend for a birthday bbq and it went very quickly! They guys were hovering around the table refilling their plates every couple of minutes. However, I used a 32 ounce can of refried beans with only one package of ranch dip and added some diced canned jalapenos. Delish!

I read a lot of reviews, and I have to say, this DID NOT look unappetizing. Maybe I'm just a little weird. I made a double batch because I had a lot of people over and everyone raved about how good it was and I personally loved it and will be making it many times over!

This recipe has become a favorite amongst our many nieces and nephews.  It is delicious and easy and one of my nieces has started taking it to get-togethers with friends.  The grown-ups like to add salsa.

This was really good, I would suggest leaving the ranch dressing out. I just used the microwave, rather than stove or oven and it turned out great!

I guess I'm not too picky or else really hungry.  I didn't even have enough sour cream for the recipe, but I thought it was really good.  Not a lot of ingredients.  And of course, a garnish of green onions would make it pretty and give it more 'bite'.  Very good and easy to make.

This dip was good, but not great. I would add more beans and sour cream to the mixture. The ranch had a strong flavoring, but it was still enjoyable!

Sure, it's not the prettiest dip but we sure enjoyed it. I used my own ranch dressing mix. I had about a half cup of salsa to use up so I threw that in as well. This didn't last any longer than a half hour. We ate it all. Great quick lunchtime snack for the Fourth.

I did make a few changes, but this was good! I used 16oz of Velvetta (it melts alot easier than cheddar and tastes better to us in hot dips) and I used 1 tablespoon of the ranch, based upon other reviewrs! This way it turned out perfect for my family! I was surprised it didn't seem real heavy! We'll def make again as we always have these ingredients on hand!

We thought this was good (though, I did change it up slightly)! I reduced the amount of ranch mix to 1 tbsp. and added 1 tbsp. of taco seasoning. I subbed velveeta for the cheddar (it melts better for me) and added about 1 cup of shredded pepperjack cheese. Also, I added about 1 cup of salsa. Threw everything into the mini crockpot and let it go until warm and melty. This was very tasty and had just the right amount of spice for us. Thanks for sharing! :)

I made a quicker, healthier version.  I used 1 can of spicy, fat free refried beans (adds a kick to it that some reviews said was missing). I didn't have any ranch dressing mix so I used 3 tablespoons of light Hidden Valley Ranch with Sour Cream salad dressing instead. Then I threw in a 1/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and stuck it in the microwave for 1 minute :) I served it with Baked Tostitos. Quick and delish!

This dip is absolutely fabulous.  I served it last night as an appetizer for guests and they just went wild.  I took the advice of everyone else and only used 1/2 the ranch specified.  I didn't have any of the packets at home, so I used 1/2 the recipe of "Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip or Dressing" from this site.  It was perfect.

A bit bland for this Texas girl, but with a few modifications, this dip was not only great, but looked a lot more visually appealing. I added some salsa (all I had was mild, so a few drops of habanero hot sauce went in with it) and chopped green onions. After cooking everything together, I wasn't pleased with the visual appeal, so I dumped it all into a casserole dish and melted some cheddar over the top. Then I sprinkled with green onions and topped with a bit of sour cream. I also took the advice of a few other reviewers and used ranch to taste. I use bulk ranch mix, so I can't tell you in terms of how much of the package I used, but it definitely was not a full package worth.

Added rotel because the consistency was weird.  Almost stringy.  Once incorporated liquid, the texture and flavor was great.

We love this dip!!!  We are making it again for Thanksgiving. The first time I made it we didn't have refried beans so I used this recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/refried-beans-without-the-refry/detail.aspx
 The dip was a HUGE hit and we have been making it this way since. Be sure to be prepared to make the dip when the beans are done so you don't have to reheat the beans.

I made this the way the recipe calls for and it was great. But what made it better was adding a cup of sliced olives and some 1 small can of diced chilies. I also added a little bit of hot sauce for some added heat. Tasted almost like a 7 layer bean dip, but with the cooling taste of ranch! :)

This was ok. But I think with some modification, it could be good. So, for next time I think I may add a more flavorful cheese and something to spice it up a bit like taco seasoning or Rotel.

This dip was just O.K.  I was disappointed because I thought the ingredients sounded great together, but I found it did not have much taste at all.  I followed the recipe to a "T" except I only used 1/2 package of dressing mix as others had suggested.  Definitely something missing.  Some people at the party suggested maybe using this dip as a base and add other ingredients on the top in layers. Not sure but will not make again.

It has a very good flavor for those who are 'heat' intolerant, but I recommend the addition of cumin and either diced jalapenos or green chilies to suit the palate of the masses.

This is one of my new comfort foods! I decreased the (light) sour cream a little bit and added some chopped green onions cause I love them so much. 
I didn't have ranch mix and i'm not really a fan of it, so I used half a packet of spicy taco mix and it was great!

This was OK, but too salty.  I agree with others that you should not use the whole seasoning packet.  Also, if I made this again I would serve it with chips that do not have too much salt on them.

This quick, easy bean dip is both healthy (I used homemade ranch mix) and different from what's already available.  We enjoyed it with corn chips and (although we didn't like it QUITE as much) with carrot sticks, as well.  It was good as-is but probably would have been better with a little less of the Ranch (1/2 pkg. like other reviewers have mentioned is probably perfect).  I'm planning to also try it with taco seasoning in place of the ranch mix.

I tried this recipe and I revised it a little bit.  I added a can of Rotel tomatoes and about 1/2 a package of taco seasoning (to taste).  I used fat free sour crean and fat free refried beans.  I mixed half the cheese into the dip and sprinkled the rest on top.  Next time I make it, I might add a little extra cheese and maybe another can of tomatoes (probably not Rotel because I don't want it to be too spicy).  I rate it 4 stars just because it's really not a pretty dish.  But it's good!

I hate to cook with ranch due to the msg but I had some given to us, and made this on a whim.  THIS BEAN DIP IS AWESOME! Too bad it's not healthy or we'd have it all the time.  My whole family loved it.  I just sprinkled the ranch w/out measuring, according to taste.

The ranch was pretty overwhelming, I should've reduced the amount like the other reviews suggested.  The flavor was pretty good over all, but it didn't seem to be too much of a hit with our party-goers.

I'm not sure what everyone expected it to look like, it's been dip! I used Velveta cheese because that's all I had, but it was super good and looked just like bean dip would look like. I added cumin, hot sauce and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute  since it's salt free and didn't use all of the Ranch packet. My husband and family loved it, it was perfect for football games on Sunday and was eatin up quickly!

Made as recipe is written, was a hit at our family get together.  I always try really hard to NOT make any changes the first time I make someone else's recipe, and I made none with this recipe. I do, however, plan to try adding a little heat, like jalapenos next time, but was really good as is, we just like a lot of spice and hot in most of our food. Oh and I did add some green onions on top and it helped with presentation, but there weren't any complaints about the appearance.

Loved the addition of the ranch to this.  It gave it a zesty flavor.  I think this would be a great base for a layered dip.  Or even to use in tacos or burritos.

Yummy!  This would be best served in a fondu or small crock pot to keep it warm and runny.  BTW, like many other reviews, I also halved the ranch, much more and the other flavors would have been lost, half was still really strong.  I also happened to use mozzarella, because that's what I had handy at the moment, and it was nice.

This was quick to mix together. For the refried beans I just used a can of pinto beans, I drained slightly and mashed. For the cheese, sour cream, and ranch powder, I added them to taste and to lower the sat fat and sodium: I used 4 Tblsp of light sour cream instead of 1 cup of sour cream, 1 cup of cheese (Mexican blend) instead of 2 cups, and just 1 Tblsp of ranch powder instead of a whole package. I stirred all of the ingredients together minus 1/4 cup of cheese. I microwaved for 2 minutes and then sprinkled with the rest of the cheese. My only major complaint is, it is really salty despite reducing the ranch powder. That is to be expected from the ingredients though. I would still mix something like this up for a super bowl type party though.

Try this dip with refried BLACK beans instead of regular (pinto) refrided beans!  It's looks and tastes better.  I added some greens onions and hot pepper flakes to really punch it up.

This was way better than I thought it would be.  I ended up adding a bit more beer to the dip to thin it out some, but everyone loved it, and it was a total hit.

This tasted great! Although I used the entire packet of ranch and added about 7 to 8 oz. Of salsa which gave it a better color and a spicier flavor.

The ranch dressing mix, cheddar cheese, and sour cream really turn an ordinary can of refried beans into a tasty dip!  This recipe is easy enough to estimate measurements if you're comfortable doing so.  The next time I make this I'll probably use  homemade refried beans instead of canned.  I gave this 4 stars, because I think it could have used a little bit more spice (taco/pinto bean seasoning or Rotel, maybe?).

I made the recipe as directed, decided not to change anything and it was a hit. I brought it to a party and it completely disappeared. It has an interesting taste that I haven't experienced from other bean dips.

Just made this dip and it was awesome.  I just threw it together with what I had - no measurements.  The only thing that was exact was the can of beans and the ranch packet.  I had about 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar and used about 1/2 cup of mexican cheese mix.  Will make again soon.

This dip was delicious, I made it with fat free sour cream and you can't taste the difference, also I used only half of the amt of cheese, When I plated it added chopped tomato and red onion and sprinkled with more cheese and it was awesome:)

I read several of the reviews so made some modifications of less ranch dressing mix and making the dip spicier.  This dip was so bland that even after adding considerable hot sauce, dry taco seasoning mix, cumin, chili powder, and a cup of salsa, it was basically a globby dip not worth making again.

This is a great recipe! I did as others and cut down the ranch to 3/4 of a packet. I also did half jack cheese and half cheddar.  I added a bit of green tabasco for some kick it was fantastic I will definately be making this again!

This was super good & very easy to make. I took it to a family gathering & everyone seemed like it. When I tested it out first for me & the husband we found that it was good but there is something missing in the flavoring! I still do not know what it is but regardless, it's still very good!

Amazing dip! I brought it to a BBQ and it was the first thing to go! However I substituted the ranch mix for southwest fiesta like another reviewer did and it gave it a great kick (I also wisely cut the amount of mix in half like everyone else, this is a must)! Everyone raved about it, I would definitely make it over and over again. As for the looks, I just sprinkled a little ground red pepper and chili power over the top - no complaints!

Very tasty!  If working from bulk ranch mix, use up to a tablespoon.  Also, if you want the dip a bit less dairy, use about half the cheese.  Great for "what to bring" to potluck in a pinch.

I personally didn't like this, but my husband loved it. I found a "fiesta ranch" mix and used that instead, which really gave it a kick.  I also didn't use all of the cheese because it seemed like a lot!

Everyone at the family reunion liked this.  
I used white cheese, instead of cheddar and not quite all of the ranch on the advice of another reviewer.
REally easy to make.
Thanks!

I thought this sounded so yummy but it was just was okay. I flavored it up by cooking some bacon first, crumbling it, then adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added some mild red salsa and extra cheese. I took it to a party and it was gone by the end of the night. So doctored up it's yummy but on it's own just alright.

I made this dip in just a few minutes with items already in my cupboard/fridge. It was so easy! I made it as is except only half the ranch because was all i had was one small packet, and being a spice lover, then added some tomato salsa (with onion and cilantro)and some hot sauce. My husband liked it! So, I know it will be gone shortly:). I will def. make it again and may try adding some taco seasoning as well.

Wow.  This was pretty good.  I used only 1/2 of the ranch packet and added a little garlic powder and salsa.  Yum.  Made it on request 2 days in a row!  Thanks.

My boyfriend really liked it, I added some onion as well as salt and pepper. I would not add the salt next time, he said it made it too salty. I also added some salsa which was really good in it.

We all liked the different blend of flavors.Excellent contrast with the normal mexican flavors in our taco dinner. Even those who hate bean dip normally, helped eat the whole bowl.

Good dip! Looks pretty unappealing, but I'll choose a nicer presentation for it next time. The first time I made it, I accidentally doubled the sour cream, and it still turned out ok.

Good if a little plain tasting.   A good dip for serving to a lot of people whose tastes may vary widely.

I didn't find the ranch flavour to be so overwhelming as other commenters did, but then again I tend to douse everything in ranch anyway!

Could definitely be improved by adding some chopped green onions for flavour and colour.

I wasn't too fond of this....made for a party last night and judging by how much was left, noone else was too fond of either. I LOVE refried beans so though this would be a good one for me, but all in all sort of bland in my opinion. We added some hot sauce to pep it up a bit, but still didn't help much.

Ranch was overpowering. I overcompensated by adding a tad bit of taco seasoning  but lost the ranch taste altogether....grrr. Anyway, I am eating it. This does make a lot! I will try again with half the ranch.

The dip had too much of a light taste and it tasted too much like ranch than bean or cheese. Next time I'll put around half of a pack of ranch dressing mix in it and I'll put jalapeño peppers in it again. The dip was surprisingly fast and easy to make!

Why are so many people saying it looks unappealing?  It's bean and cheese dip - what did you expect it to look like?  I added salsa and cumin to mine and after it was heated up and combined put it in a pie plate, sprinkled more cheddar on top and threw it in the oven for a few minutes.  I thought it looked just fine.

The ranch was overpowering in my opinion, so if I were to make it again I would only put in half a pack. The first few bites were good, but I couldn't eat a lot of it. I doubt my other half will eat any.  He likes cheese dip loaded with meat.

I wish I would have read the reviews first and cut the ranch by half. It was too over powering. I will try it again though with the adjustment because it really seems like it is a good combination.

I used a fat free refried black beans and sour cream plus added a jalapeno and some chipotle hot sauce.  Super yummy!

I followed the recipe as is & liked it! Would maybe try again with Velveeta since it melts a little creamier.

I made the dip and used the fiesta ranch packet. it was okay. I would suggest using the spicy beans to give it more flavor. I added a can of chopped olives to it to. I think it needs more of a kick.

Excellent! I did not have ranch dressing so I used this recipe from this site: Dry Ranch Style Seasoning for Dip or Dressing. I added 1/8 teaspoon of smoked paprika.

After reading some of the reviews about this dip lacking flavor I decided to brown up a 1/2 lb of hamburger/onion to add to it. I also added in the chopped green chiles someone else mentioned. I have to say I was expecting a bit more flavor-it still seemed like something was missing! Overall quick and easy but not something I would make often.

It was ok, but quite bland in my opinion.   After initial sampling with no alterations, I added almost a full can of Rotell, some chili powder and some Frank's Red Hot.   Then it was pretty good and the family really liked it.

Someone commented it was missing something, I figured it out. Add a half a pkg of spicey taco seasoning and also the small can of chopped green chiles. Added just enough flavour. Really good. Very addictive.

Made this last night for my dinner companions and they practically inhaled it. I used my own refried beans (from this site's Refried Beans Without the Refry) and cut the ranch dip down to 3/4 of the package. I added chopped up green onion for a garnish and the dip looked delicious (probably because my own refried beans look way better than canned ones).  I'll be making a double batch of this for the next family gathering.

One of the top recipes I tried on this site! All I need is to add ground beef and this is a replacement for nachos IMO.
