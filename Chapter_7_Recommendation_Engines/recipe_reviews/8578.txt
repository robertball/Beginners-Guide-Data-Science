I tried this recipe after years of having it in restaurants and wondering what they had used to make this. Finally I found this recipe and I was very, very pleased. It was easy to make and delicious. I did end up having to add more olive oil to prepare the chicken and a bit more marsala wine for the sauce but overall it was great! I would reccommend letting the sauce and the chicken sit for a while so that the flavors are absorbed.

Good Recipe!  I changed a few things though.  Instead of using egg and just flour I omited the egg and added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp dried oregano to 1/4 cup flour and dipped the chicken in that and then fried it.  I didn't have the meat extract and couldn't find it at 2 grocery stores so I ommitted it and added 1 tsp chicken bullion granules.  I used cooking wine so didn't add any additional salt.  Before swirling the butter and juice, I added about 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and thickened it with a water/flour mixture.  I served it to guests and they loved it.

An excellent authentic Marsala. To add complexity to the flavor, and easily bring this up to restaurant quality, consider the following modifications, MERWIN MARSALA 1.1:

1) Only use 3/4 pound chicken with the ingredients specified, reducing the serving size to three or so.

2) Substitute 1 tsp. "Gravy Master" for "meat extract" - I can only assume that's what Merwin meant. At any rate, it works wonderfully and adds a rich color and flavor to the sauce.

3) Substitute 2 tbsp. each of both butter and margarine instead of 4 tbsp. butter, since margarine burns less easily.

4) Start with 1/2 tsp. black pepper, no extra salt, and the oregano reduced to 1 tsp., and work from there. Also, consider adding 1/2 tsp. sweet Hungarian paprika to the other dry spices.

5) Add one large clove of finely chopped garlic and one large shallot to the butter in step (1) first, allowing them to cook a little before adding the chicken. Sprinkle approximately 1/2 the dry spice on the chicken *before* cooking, and save the rest to add to the sauce later, as originally specified.

6) Although I originally used 1/2 cup of Marsala wine as specified, I will probably increase this to 3/4 cup next time. Use some corn starch to thicken the sauce at the end of step (3) if you like your sauce thicker - I used 1 tsp. mixed with 1 oz. cold water. Let the chicken sit in the sauce for a few minutes on low heat at the end.

7) Optional: "Baby Bella" mushrooms instead of white mushrooms.

My teenage daughter exclaimed, "Oh my gosh, I can't stop eating this!"  It is so tasty, you will want to double the sauce.  I added shallots, garlic and diced prosciutto along with the mushrooms.  Also, some corn starch dissolved in chicken broth and a splash of heavy cream just before serving to thicken the sauce. Great recipe!

I truly enjoyed this recipe, although i did make some changes to compensate for my father's medical needs and the family's taste. I skipped the breading process and seasoned the chicken prior to cooking as I found it to be slightly bland the first time I made it. To season, I used garlic powder,onion powder and pepper. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch as it is very yummy over brown rice and angel hair pasta. This is a new family favorite!!!! Thanks Merwin for awakening our tastebuds!

This was quite tasty but no where near as good as PORK TENDERLOIN WITH DIJON MARSALA SAUCE from this site. It's going to be hard for any marsala based sauce to beat that one!

I made this recipe strickly according to the instructions with the exception that I used only 1 Tablespoon dried oregano.I  was very disappointed with it.  It was far too much oregano which total overwhelmed the whole dish.  Will not try it again.

Very Tasty. I did add some minced garlic,  used the oregano to taste, doubled the sauce, added flour to thicken and than put the chicken back  into the sauce to absorb more flavor. Will make again and again.

this was ok.  The oregano flavor was a little strong for my taste.  I might try it again with less oregano.

Absolutely delicious! Didn't know what meat extract was. I used Better than Bullion to make stock and made it a little stronger than directions. Then I used some Kitchen Bouquet. I did add an onion and garlic to the sauce and mixed a little cayenne in with the flour. I doubled the sauce, but next time I will triple it. It was soooo delicious. I used Fiore dry marsala and was great.

So full of flavor! I picked this recipe because it called for chicken stock, which I thought would really bring out the flavors. This recipe was perfect, I just tweaked it a little to suit my situation. Before sauteeing the mushrooms, I added 2 tbsp of minced onion and 1 tsp of minced garlic to the butter. Then, I didn't use Marsala wine (so I guess it's not technically a chicken marsala, haha). I only did that because I dont like drinking sweet wines, and I wanted to drink a few glasses with the meal. So I picked Pinot Noir, and sprinked about 1 tbsp of sugar into the sauce, since Marsala IS a sweet wine after all.  I used pre-cooked, grilled chicken tenders from Trader Joes for convenience and it turned out great! Lastly, I splashed about 2 tbsp of half-n-half to the final result along with 1/2 tbsp of butter. All served over angel hair pasta!  so yummy (p.s. with the chicken stock, and "meat flavor" --I used granulated chicken boullion-- this recipe does not need any addl salt. Use at your discretion)  Enjoy!

This recipe was perfect!!!! best chicken marsala I've ever made, EVER. probably the best I've ever eaten too! I followed this recipe exactly as it's written, and only changed a couple things. After I added the marsala wine and the parsley and oregano, I also added about 1/4 cup of cooking Sherry. I had no ''meat extract'', because I have no idea what that is, so I added some a packet of Beef flavoring from a package of Ramen noodles, ha ha ha. Also, I let that simmer with the mushrooms for about 5 minutes and then I removed the mushrooms, put them in a separate bowl, and then I added a mixture of cornstarch to thicken the sauce just a LITTLE. You don't want it to be too thick. After that was mixed up I re-added the chicken and the mushrooms back to the pan and covered and let it simmer for about 5 minutes or so. It was perfect!!!

This is one of my favorites!!! It has awesome flavor.   Add a little wine and broth and then thicken with a water flour mixture for a nice sauce to put over pasta along with the chicken.

This came out really good! I didn't cut the chicken up into pieces and instead used the whole breast so I had to fry for a little longer. I thought they might be lacking in flavor but the mushrooms and sauce more than make up for it. I think if I did add salt to the flour it would have made it too salty. Great recipe!

This just became my favorite recipe. I brought the laptop in the kitchen, made this and just took my first bite. Mmmm!!!
I did not have meat extract, so I used beef broth instead of the chicken broth. I also added 1/2 cup heavy cream as another suggested, Awesome!!!!

Tried this tonight, and it came out pretty good.  My wife really liked it, and I loved the buttery flavor of the chicken.  However, I think there's a typo: 2 tablespoons of oregano and parsley were WAY too much.  Next time, I would try2 teaspoons of each and see if that works better...

This was tasty but I felt like there was something missing.  I added a splash of cream to thicken it up but that didn't change it too much.  I diced up a half an onion and put it in - it tasted nice but it didn't blow my mind.

This recipe is good, but not the best, but is better than some of the other recipes I have found. I was looking to find a recipe that tasted more like chicken marsala I got at the Bucca Di Beppo Restraunt.

Another fabulous marsala recipe! I made 70 chicken breasts for our daughter's grad party so with that much meat, I didn't even bother measuring the wine. I did add a few more seasonings but that's all this needed. My guests loved this dish and it was even better the second day at our post grad party!! Thanks so much L. Chambers!

This is very good.  I use shallots, garlic and mushrooms in the sauce along with the wine.  I added fresh chopped Italian parsley just before serving.  Wonderful!

This recipe is excellent.  I cook every Tuesday and Thursday for my Husband and his co-workers.  They loved this new easy recipe.  And every recipe must have meat.  Thank you.

So good.  I also changed a few things.  Added some green onion and used Baby Bella mushrooms.  Used lot less oregano.  Will double or triple the sauce next time.  Yum!

Delicious! I was very happy how this one came out. I did what the reviews said and used a little less Oregano & am glad I did. I also added a tiny bit of cornstarch at the very end to thicken the sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe & thought it turned out very well.
