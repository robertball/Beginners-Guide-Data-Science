I made this in my food processor (not sure if that changes things) and found the recipe called for too much liquid. The next time I made it, I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups and decreased the milk to 1/2 cup (together with the orange juice, it made 3/4 cup liquid, total).  With these adjustments, it's a good recipe.

Delicious. 
I added more  OJ & another 1/4 C of 10X Sugar & added less OJ to make itinto an icing rather than a glaze. I put mixed icing into a  zip-lock bag & drizzled it over all the tops so not to loose any; as a glaze  would pour over & off dripping into pan. Why loose all that delicious topping. 
Keep it on all the Scones to injoy. I pressed in some real cranberries on top, egg washed & dusted  coarse Demerara Sugar before baking.

Very simple scone recipe that turned out very well.  Made it with real milk instead of almond milk.  Tried it with fresh cranberries, craisins and a lemon poppyseed version.  Al three turned out good.

Have made it 3 times and always delicious.  I wrap individually and freeze them.  Just take one out as needed.  
I make 2 batches at a time.   Love them.

Just made the recepie with raisins, applesauce instead of orange juice, cinnamon and vanilla flavoring.  Super great.

Delish. Orange flavor came through so well!  Great rise on these! I cut milk to 1/2 cup (I use dried because I don’t drink milk and keep this in the pantry for baking). Total liquid with juice of orange was right at one cup. I had also soaked my Craisins, so knew I’d have plenty of liquid.

I made it exactly to the recipe and it was far too wet. Cranberries should be chopped and not hold. They do not rise very well at all and they were very underbaked even at the full 15 minutes. I would not make them again.u

Very good.  A little more cake-ish than I like, but that may be due to my substitutions.  I didn’t have almond milk, so used half and half, with a half teaspoon of almond extract.  Also used dried cranberries, and twice the amount of sugar.

It was very dry. I substituted buttermilk for the almond milk because that is what I usually use for scones and that worked. But when I went to knead the dough it was too wet so I used a bunch of flour to knead and it turned out too dry. Though the flavor was good, it was very subtle
