This recipe was very good!  I doubled the filling because I like a gooey sticky cinnamon roll, but it was good and easy!

These are absolutely fabulous! I made them exactly as the recipe reads, and I have had requests from family and friends over and over again for them!  I used my bread machine to make the dough, and placed the ingredients into the bread machine in the exact order listed in this recipe and it works great!  I wanted some smaller rolls to take to work to share, so today I followed the recipe to a tee, but after I rolled the dough out and put the butter and cinnamon suger on, I used a pizza cutter to cut the whole thing in half lenghthwise. Then I rolled the two halves up separately, and cut each one into twelve pieces, giving me 24 "mini-rolls". I have them in the oven now, but am watching them to see if I need to reduce the cooking time by a couple of minutes for the smaller rolls. Worked beautifully!

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls as a fun weekend baking project with my son. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and the sugar for ten minutes in the mixer bowl, then added the vegetable oil, flour, dry milk powder (I used dry BUTTERMILK powder) and salt. We did need a little more flour than what was called for. We kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes, then set the dough to rise for an hour or so on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and my son mixed the softened butter together with the sugar and cinnamon and spread it on the rolled out dough (it was just easier for him to do it that way). We sliced them up and set them in a baking pan, covered them with foil and set them in the fridge to set overnight. We'll update our review once we bake them in the morning. EDITED: I took them out of the fridge this morning and set them on a warm baking sheet to finish out the second rise. 400* for about 15 minutes and we were in business. I used Cinnamon Roll Icing to drizzle over the top, which is also on this site. These were okay, but not our favorite. It didn't seem to have enough of the cinnamon sugar filling and these seemed a little on the dry side, even with icing.

I love these cinnamon rolls! They aren't the huge, gross, overly-sweet, and overly-sticky cinnamon buns available at the store or a certain cinnamon roll shop found in malls and air ports. These cinnamon rolls are just sweet enough, small enough that one roll is a reasonable portion for one person, and the rolls are delicious iced lightly with a cream cheese frosting. These cinnamon rolls didn't last a day when I made them for my friends and family and I'll definitely make them again. The only change I made was to add extra cinnamon to the cinnamon-sugar mixture and I iced them with a vanilla cream cheese frosting.

This is a great sweet roll dough, I have made exactly like the recipe and also did it with rasins and a little more sugar. Both times they were great, but really fabulous with cream cheese frosting!

I used the dough as a base, and made a "cheese bun" variation of these - they were incredible!  After I rolled out the dough, I brushed it with a little butter, and then used about 4 and a half processed light cheese slices as the filling.  (Only because my toddler loves them, but they would be awesome with shredded cheddar!)  Rolled it all up, and sliced then baked as directed.  The buns were soft and fluffy, not too dense or too sweet.  Very good!!!  I'll be using this recipe again - for cinnamon rolls, too.

Wow! These were awesome. Followed suggestion of other reviewers and doubled the filling. These were a-m-a-z-i-n-g. Took a long time to make, but totally worth it! Leftover rolls reheated nicely....

For flavor, I think next time I will double the cinnamon sugar mixture seemed a little lacking in flavor and gooeyness but not bad.  They were still good.  Just need more cinnamon sugar next time for my tastes.  Easy and no eggs which is a plus for my family as our son has an egg allergy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these rolls as savory. I followed the dough instructions and the dough came out perfect. In the filling I used Thyme instead of the cinnamon mixture and cooked it as suggested. My kids love this recipe, their friends too.

These rolls have an excelent flavor which is why I gave them 3 stars. However, when I removed the pan from the bread machine, I had a batter not dough. It took almost another cup of flour before it could be madeinto cinnamon rolls. They could use more cinnamon sugar in them as they were slighty dry and not gooey. I will try these again using more than 3 cups of flour and hope they are more doughy and not batter again.

These are wonderful! Also made them using 1/2 cup peanut-butter for the filling. Made them for a slumber party (checked no one had allergies). Topped with icing. They were a hit!!!

One of the most versatile cinnamon rolls doughs I have ever used. The dough came out perfectly, not sticky at all.  There are so many different variations of cinnamon rolls that could made with this.  I made a homemade cinnamon frosting for the top, but a nice orange glaze would work well too.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will definitely be using it again.

They were good. I didn't have a bread maker so mixed it manually and only did half the recipe but it came out great anyways.

This is a great recipe, although I recommend doubling the filling. They would probably be a bit bland without the extra.  I use "the perfect cinnamon roll icing" by Cara M. on top.  I have brought them to parties and made them for my family; the are always a hit.

I have made these several times in my bread machine.  The dough recipe is very good.  To make the filling better double it and use brown sugar instead of white.
Butter the pan and sprinkle a little filling in the bottom of the pans before you place the rolls in.
