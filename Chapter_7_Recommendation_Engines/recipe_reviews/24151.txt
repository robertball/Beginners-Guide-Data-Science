I made this for my husband and myself.  We found it to be too sweet with not enough sausage flavor to even it out.  I would definitely make this again, however, I wouldn't use quite as much sugar and I would use more sausage.

I was looking for something diffrent for breakfasts. This sounded intresting and I gave it a try. WOW! It is everything that is said about it! I cooked it on a rainy sunday and it had my family asking when it would be done! It filled my whole house with a spicy aroma. My kids did like it and it was gone by monday night!  I plan on making this often and espically for Christmas monrning. Thanks Ann M. Hester for a great recipe!!!

I have been looking for this recipe for years. I used to make this every year for Christmas but lost my recipe when I moved. I do remember having used 1 cup of orange juice in place of a part of the water. You might want to try this it is fantastic.

This cake was a a little time consuming.  The biggest compliant I had was that the cake was more sweet than savory.  And that it would be better if it was a balance of the two.  Other than that the cake was polished off in two days!

Hi everyone, thanks for all the reviews! This cake will not be for everyone, it is an old recipe that my grandmother used to make. When they got up at 4:00 am to go milk cows, they got a slice of this with coffee and went out the door. Then 2 hours later, grandmother came in and made breakfast. You are not suppose to get a strong taste from the sausage, it is meant to be a cake that has a "hidden plus" that is nutritious. Someone suggested adding orange juice...I  say this...try it the original way first. Then you'll know if you like it or will what to change in it to your liking. I am known to add diced, peeled apple during Christmas time. And sometimes I use pecans instead of walnuts. One year at Christmas time I added some dried cranberries and diced apples! My mom likes to add cinnamon to the apples before I stir them into the batter. If it is too sweet, reduce the sugar! Make it the way you want for your family ...isn't that what we do with recipes?! Happy cooking and eating!

I followed directions exactly, came out, I'm sure as it should have, but I just didn't care for it.  I took it to a pot-luck and I think only one person tried it.  Sorry!
