This is my husband's new favorite recipe - it was SO tender and delicious!  Since the spice rub had cardamon, I served the pork with Sauteed Apples (also on Allrecipes.com) to compliment the sweetness in the rub.  I was more than happy with my choice - it was a GREAT combination!  We didn't grill the pork, but baked it at 500 for 20 minutes to seal in the juices, then at 350 until it hit 160 degrees.  Yum, yum, yum!

I used this recipe last night on a 1 pound tenderloin (it’s just my husband and I).  I didn’t scale the spices down for the rub even thought it was a smaller roast.  I grilled it with indirect heat for about 20 minutes until it reached an internal temperature of 155.  I then pulled it off the grill and lightly tented it with tinfoil and allowed it to rest for five minutes.  This allowed the internal cooking to finish nicely.  My husband and I loved the flavor.  The cardamom and cumin were present, but not overpowering.  Next time I will decrease the salt though.  We both love salt, but thought it was too much for the smaller roast.  This will be a staple in our household for years to come.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My family and I thought this recipe was on the salty side. I rubbed the roast with the ingredients that were listed, and let it "marinate" for over 30 hrs. Cooked it on our gas grill, on indirect heat for 1 1/2 hrs. Very tender! The flavors were good, but next time I will use less salt.

The spices on this were very subtle and enjoyable.  My son would prefer that I not rinse the meat as much as he likes a lot of salt.  I on the other hand thought it was seasoned perfectly.  Now for the cooking time, I always always use a meat thermometer and never go by the cooking times listed.  I cook pork to 155 degrees and then pull it off the heat and cover it with foil for about 10 to 15 minutes before carving.  This was very juicy.

Didn't know pork could taste this good! I was upset about paying as much as I did for this piece of meat but was very glad I did when I tasted the results. I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results. Cooking it on the grill was wonderful and half the mess!

I had no idea that pork could taste like this!  We grilled a 4 lb roast and followed the exact recipe, curing the roast for about 23 hours.  It cooked on the grill for about 1 hour 15 minutes, and was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  You can just taste each of the spices, and they work perfectly together.  We grilled corn-on-the-cob to go with it, and it was wonderful, although I want to try the other reviewer's apples, too!  Well worth the wait for something so easy that tastes so great!

Deliciously different!  I cut back on the salt and added a pinch of black pepper to the rub.  After 24 hours, I rinsed really well and seared it for the flavor/color then into the 325 oven until 150 (about 45 minutes for my 2.5 pound roast) and then tented.  I prefer my pork a little more medium than well (and everything is dead above 140 anyways).  Served with the apples and onions from the apple and onion pork chops from this site with roasted potatoes.  Will definately make this again for company and try using the grill when it's warmer out

I thought I would give this a try following the directions -whoops!  It was too salty and yes I did rinse it as called for, and I really like salt but this was too much.  May try again w/less salt.

excellent. I didn't have any cordomom, so I used some Coriander instead. Tasted great. Very easy recipe, with a great payoff.

Made this one with rice on the side, with lots of leftover pork, knowing that cured meat lasts a good long time in the fridge. Weeks later I diced some of the left over pork and added it to pizza, with pineapple. Do it.

This was awesome. The smell of the rub is so unique, I wasn't sure how it would taste. Incredible! The outsides were kind of like a ham, and the inside was so juicy! This was a perfect recipe. Thanks so much!

My whole family of six loves this one.  There are a couple picky eaters in the mix, so that says alot.  As others have said, be sure to cut the salt in half unless you are a salt fiend.  Quick and easy to prepare.

as with other reviews, i couldn't really see how the cumin/cardamom combo would work but it REALLY does!  this is a really interesting spice combo that works and the overall flavor is a perfect sweet/salty balance.  I would use a little less salt next time but not much less.  I also used brown sugar instead of white for more body in the flavor from the molasses.  I threw it on the grill on the upper rack (indirect, the one u use to heat buns, etc) on low heat and it took about 10-11 min on each side.  Next time i will likely add some cayenne pepper as well for some heat.  great recipe, so easy - def try!

My family really liked. the meat was very tender & juicy. Being that it is winter, I baked it at 350 degrees for about an hour & a half & it was perfect. It is worth the wait!

This will be a new summertime tradition in our house. I marinated the pork loin for 48 hours.  The spices were perfect. I did not have any cumin(just ran out) so instead I used some McCormick Bbq seasoning and a little less salt. I cooked it over indirect heat for an hour and fifteen minutes. So moist and very flavorful. My husband who doesn't like a lot of salt really loved the dish. This was by far the very best pork loin I have ever tasted. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I was pretty skeptical at first, but decided to try it based on all the positive reviews.  Wow!  I am amazed that such a simple recipe could be so good.  I roasted at 350 for one hour and it was delicious:  tender, juicy, and flavourful.  It's just a little sweet and salty.  I will definitely make again and again.

We served this at a dinner party last night and it received fabulous reviews by all of our guests! We followed the recipes exactly and grilled it on a gas grill. We served it with the Early Morning Oven Roasted New Potatoes, also on this website. This will be a "regular" at our house!

This was delicious! Not too sweet or too salty, and the flavour was out of this world. I wonder if previous reviewers remembered to completely rinse all the rub off the roast before baking, because that's the only way I can see the sugar or salt taste being strong enough to be disagreeable.

Pork is tender with a subtle spiced flavor. Easy to make (once you can find ground cardamom). Mine took about an hour and 15 minutes on the grill. Very nice dish.

Loved it. I used a 4 1/2 lb pork roast, and let the roast marinate for two days. I rinsed the meat by placing  it  into a large pot of cold water and rubbing the salt off the meat. I changed out the water twice, rubbing the meat each time until the water was clear. I'm not good with the grill, so I placed the roast into a covered dutch oven and baked for 4 hours at 275. Great flavor, not too salty, and very tender.

This is an excellent recipe.  I thought it was a little salty, so I cut salt content in half and it was great.  I've made it on the grill and in the oven, the grill is definitely the choice cooking method!  (Good either way though.)

What a delicious and easy recipe!  I rubbed my roast the day before with the published amounts  of spices.  No grilling this cold February night, so I roasted to 160 internal temperature.  This was moist and so delicious.  Takes on kind of a ham-like quality.  Would be a great main for Easter.  A do-over for sure.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Kathy.

I do this very much like the recipe, although on special occasions, I put this type of roast on a rotisserie until golden brown, the wrap it in foil and put it in the oven for about an hour to an hour and a half. To prep it, before the rotiesserie, I rub it with my favorite spice rub, wrap it in plastic wrap and put it in the frig overnight. Melts in your mouth when I am done.

I have made this recipe in the oven and now in the barbeque. It is so delicious every time. I was never a fan of pork roast, but with this recipe I like it so much I'll double the recipe and eat this delicious roast for a week or more. The spices are subtle and the sugar/salt curing is perfect. I like my meat well seasoned, however if you dislike salt, by all means lower the amount.

Turned out delicious, but I only gave this 4 stars because it took longer than the recipe stated to cook. Cooking time is at least an hour and a half. One hour and it will still be raw in the middle. An hour and a half, still juicy, but safe to eat!

2nd Review,
We tried this on pork loin chops and cooked them in the oven.  They came out very nice.  Again, my husband really enjoyed it.  He always said he didn't like pork because it was to dry, the way his mother made it.  This is not dry if you don't over cook.

I made this during the winter, so I roasted the pork loin at 350 degrees for about an hour or so in the oven and it was delicious!

Really good and moist! I'm surprised the flavors penetrated into the meat and seasoned it better than some other recipes i've tried for pork loins! Not too salty if you rinse like they say. I baked it at 325 degrees for 1 hr and it came out great! Easy to make too, don't let the amount of salt shock you!

I’ve made this twice now just using a pork roast and it was a big hit.  Had to hand out the recipe again.  I’ll make it when I want to impress.  The glazed apples are a great accompaniment.

I used two frozen  pork roasts totalling about five pounds.  I marinated it in the fridge for twenty hours, then roasted it at 375 for an hour.  I also baked acorn squash with butter and coconut sugar, and glazed the pork with a little of that stuff for a ten minute broiler because it looked grey and boiled.  

By the time it was all ready it was pretty and tasty and tasted like hzm!  The meat does look grey, but I think that might be natural.  The squash was outstanding too!

I froze the leftover roast and it will appear someday in a fried rice dish!

Since I was feeling lazy, I chose to roast it in the oven.  I started at 450F convection roast for 20 min and then turned the temp down to 375F convect roast for another 20 min.  The temp registered 147F after 40 min and then I let it rest for 15 min.  It  was really good.  It tastes almost like a cured ham.

Deliciously moist. This recipe is a keeper.  Next time I plan to use more cardamom because I love cardamom and felt like the cumin had overpowered it.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious as is, I just want to see what it tastes like with more cardamom.

Delicious, doubled recipe but 1/2 the salt. Added sage, white pepper and paprika. Did not rinse, wrapped in parchment then foil, put on grill indirect heat. Remove from heat at 145, seared out side for crust and let rest!

It was alright but severely lacking in any real flavor. Might have liked it if I didn't already have an amazing pork marinade at my disposal.
