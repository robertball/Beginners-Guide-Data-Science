I made this (at the B&B) when a guest said he was coming in and is a type 1 diabetic.  I always make mini-muffins.  I asked several questions and made a few changes - I used butter rather than margarine, increased the apple and used a combination of Fuji and Gravenstein (picked fresh from the tree), I added a touch of fresh ginger and used brown sugar instead of the Stevia.  Because one batch actually makes 3-4 batches of 8-12 mini muffins, I found each quarter batch freezes well also. When I serve for non-diabetics (most of the time) I sprinkle it with a modified streusel before it goes in the oven - flour, cinnamon and brown sugar (no butter, so I can keep it in the pantry).  Thank you!  This is becoming a go-to!

I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 2/3 of white flour, and two tablespoons of Stevia instead of one. I wanted something with low carbs and diabetic friendly.

Used a mix of whole wheat flour and oats instead of white flour.  Increased sweetness to 3 tbsp. Splenda.  Cut butter to 3 tbsp. and added 1/4 cup of applesauce.  Last, used buttermilk instead of skim milk.  They were very good!

I wa looking for  Diabetic friendly recipe for  JDRF bake sale.  Yeah I know.  Bake sale for diabetic research fund rising.  But it worked!  I had people asking where I got the recipe and they all sold out!    I used Granny Smith apples and Stevia Honey as my sweetener.  They were delicious!  A definite repeat recipe

The recipe was very bland. Next time I will add more sweetener and cinnamon.

I made these for a guest at our B&B who has diabetes and she was very pleased with them. I did use banana extract instead of the vanilla and used stevia baking sugar for the sweetner. They were a little dry.

I used regular salt;  did not have nutmeg;  used eggbeaters;
used "I Cant Believe It's Not Butter" for the "reduced-calorie margarine".
They turned out OK, but seemed to be lacking something - can't put my finger on it.

I prefer a sweeter muffin, personally. No fault of the recipe, just my opinion. I did make this exactly as directed.
