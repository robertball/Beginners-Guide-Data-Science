Have made this twice now. Wife and I loved it, made our way though. We take recipes and try to make them healthier. I used multi-grain spaghetti, all natural tomato sauce instead of ketchup and low fat pizza cheese. I threw in some diced chili peppers to spice it up too.   We prefer spicier foods so we add a little hot sauce to ours as we eat it.

Easy and delicious. I used the spaghetti sauce/mozzarella cheese version of the recipe and added onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper and basil. Next time I'll make it with penne or ziti though - I made a mess trying to serve this thing.

This recipe tasted to us like the spaghetti from highschool. It was a little to sweet for our tastes, maybe the "italian" version would taste better.

Easy & tasty recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, and I liked it a lot. I was nervous about using ketchup instead of a spaghetti sauce, but it actually gave it a yummy flavor. My 3 year old even asked for 2nds, which a very rare! 2 thumbs up!

I was looking for a new way to do spaghetti! My family loved this recipe. I added garlic cheese bread and it was perfect. Thanks!

This recipe wasn't bad. I followed the recipe listed but I want to try the Italian version. I think this would be much more enjoyable as a baked spaghetti dish.

I made the recipe like written for a big family get-together, except I used sausage turkey to add a little spice and red peppers instead of green.  The group loved it!  It doesn't taste like italian spaghetti, but that was ok, we liked it being different.  Some added tabasco to add some kick. Very easy to make ahead of time!

Decent recipe - nothing special! I did change it a little bit. Instead of using ketchup or tomato sauce i used a 10oz jar of spaghetti sauce. I also used mozzarella cheese on top instead of cheddar. It was good, just average. Nothing to make you say "Wow"..

Hello!  I thought this recipe was simple and tasty.  I put in 1 C. ketchup and 1 C. pasta sauce instead, and yellow pepper which added a nice sweetness to it.  I asked my boyfriend if I should make it again and he said "Definitely".  Thank you.

This tasted very bland, it was not a success in our household. I tried the "Italian" recipe. It may be better with some chopped black olives    in the mixture as well as some breadcrumbs on top. If I ever make this again I think I will mix the spaghetti in with the turkey mixture and then bake it all together, instead of  the spaghetti on top.

This was a nice easy recipe. I added the tomato sauce and mozzerella cheese. Also, salt and pepper. Next time I make this I'll spice it up a little bit more. A good dish to make with ground turkey.

This was great for my whole family!  I followed the "Italian" recipe with tomatoes and mozarella.  A great use for ground turkey.

I made with the submitter's alternate suggestion of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. This is okay but needs more seasoning. Maybe Italian seasoning would help.
