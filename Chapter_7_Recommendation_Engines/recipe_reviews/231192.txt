I've never been a big fan of corned beef & I only make it once a year for St. Patty's Day...but after trying this recipe, I will make it more often. YUM!!
The only things I did differenty were to add the spice packet (that came w/the beef) to the crockpot, cut the sauce recipe in 1/2 (it made plenty) & did my potatoes & cabbage seperately. Again, YUM!!!

I made this and it was the best Corned Beef I've ever made! I cooked the corned beef first. Removed it from the pot then cooked the cabbage in the remaining liquid. Added the sauce and cooked it as directed in oven. Delicious!

The corned beef and trimmings came out great, but nobody cared for the sauce.  I was looking forward to it, as I like butter, honey, and horseradish mustard, but as a combination, it just had an odd taste.  Next time I'll forget the sauce.
