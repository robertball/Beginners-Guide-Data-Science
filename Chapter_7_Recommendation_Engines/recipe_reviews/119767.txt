I've been making these for years and they are delicious.  One thing though, you should definitely drain the zucchini thoroughly after shredding.  I put it in a colander and cover with paper towels, then weight it down with a large soup can, let it sit for about 20 minutes.  It makes a huge difference!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this! There are so many ways to change this recipe, too, as desired! Sometimes I leave out the seafood seasoning and skip the crackers and bake the patties. The possibilities are endless!!! Sometimes I add shredded potato and carrots!

OK - I messed this recipe up a little and they were still fantastic! I had a large group here for my dad's birthday celebration this evening and with all the kids running around the kitchen and chatting/having fun, I scanned the directions quickly and threw everything in a bowl and mixed (including the crushed crackers). After noticing that the mixture was too dry to shape into patties, I realized my mistake and added an additional jumbo egg. With the large number of people, I had to double the recipe.  I also made the cakes small to serve as a side. After shredding the zucchini, I placed it in a colander, sprinkled it with Kosher salt and let it hang out for awhile and allowed the excess moisture drain out. Before adding it to the other ingredients, I squeezed the remaining liquid out in a clean dish towel. All alterations worked out great. Everyone really enjoyed these and several did agree that they taste like crab cakes. Very flavorful and a great side or meatless main dish. Absolutely a "make again" here. Thanks for sharing!

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I have tried several zucchini cakes over the years, and this is my favorite by far.  The only modifications I made were to use onion powder instead of chopped onion, and I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup cracker crumbs because I ran out of bread crumbs.  I drained the zucchini very well before mixing with the other ingredients. I also had to add a little more oil to the skillet while cooking.  These had great flavor, were crisp on the outside, and weren't as mushy on the inside as the other zucchini cakes I've tried.  I will definitely make again!

I love this recipe.  I have made it 3 times.  My father was visiting and he thought at first I made salmon patties, then he saw the green flakes.  He knew I had used zucchini, but then he asked what kind of fish did I use? 2nd and 3rd time I made with 1 extra egg. Thanks for the recipe, Pat. Love it!! Maybe it should be named Zuchini Moch Crab Cakes and put under side dishes so it is easier to find.

These were fabulous!  A couple changes, I make my own bread crumbs with butter crackers & Panko Crumbs & seasoning.  Added it to the zucchini mixture & didn't need to coat again with crumbs.  Scooped mixture in large fritter size directly into the oil.  Fried em up & YUMMY!  Thank you thank you Thank you!

Flavor could fool you!  Be sure the zucchini is very finely shredded.  Does not stay together real well, as a "cake".

These are really, really good! You do need to make patties small otherwise they fall apart and are a little mushy

This recipe is great--and very filling! Would not change a thing. I did not have the seafood seasoning so I used crushed red pepper & parsley to taste. Will be making again!

Very good, but I don't necessarily think they taste like crab cakes since there isn't any crab!  Quite tasty though and I used corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs because that's what I had.  I also used two eggs to make them hold together a little better.  I didn't dip them in cracker crumbs either and still delicious.

This is a great recipe! Personally my family and I preferred the seasoning to be in the dredge instead of inside the cake but that's personally preference. Don't make them too big cause they will fall apart too easily if you do other than that it was great.

I don't know what "seafood seasoning" is, omit that, I used salt & pepper. I goofed and mixed the cracker crumbs into the mix instead of the bread crumbs so I tried to dredge in the crumbs, it all fell apart so I dumped the crumbs in the mix too. 
BAKED 350F 20 min, flip, 20 min more. Great taste, very buttery flavor. Next time I'll omit the butter. 
Try also Carrot Burgers by Phyllis Moody, Italian Vegetarian Patties by Shecooks2. Those are excellent!

Delicious, almost meaty cakes, with even better taste. Add one tbs of curry, and there you have a wonderful dish!

This gets my 5 starz for EASE!!  I really LOVE crab cakes but they are SO time consuming!  This is so fast and EASY!  TASTE? tho... really nice, but does not taste crab cake enough for me... So I kept it simple and CHEAP by adding 1 container of Starkist REAL crab meat!  It's in a small plastic tub in the refrigerated section, by the imitation seafood's.  I added one container and it flavored the whole batch!  My husband thought they were completely crab cakes!  WONDERFUL and EASY recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!  PS.. MAKE SURE YOU DRAIN/PRESS the water from the zucchini first!  Makes a HUGE difference!

I used panko crumbs instead of butter cracker crumbs, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I let the "batter" sit about 20 minutes before I formed the patties to give the breadcrumbs a chance to soak up all excess moisture.  My family loved these and I will be making these again.

Very good.  I used a potato ricer to squeeze all the liquid out of the zucchini.  Works better than draining in a colander.  If the cake is too moist it will be mushy and fall apart.

Loved these so much.  Made them exact except followed advice of others to make them a bit smaller.  Will be making these again for sure.  Severed them up with some cocktail sauce, perfect!

These were great!  My garden is bountiful and there are soooo many zucchini.  These fooled my husband since he was sure that they must have crab in them.  I will make these in a mini version and use them as a nibble the next time we have friends over.  Thanks!

Made this recipe for the 1st time yesterday and was better than I expected.  Didn't use the seafood seasoning.  These are probably the best zucchini cakes I have ever had.

These are a great idea!  I reduced the recipe to the amount of shredded zucchini that I had (about 2 c) but followed the recipe otherwise.  Even with less to work with, there was way more than 5 cakes!  And they fry up better and stick together better as smaller cakes anyway.  I salted them before serving, which I do with crab cakes too.  I will increase the Old Bay next time and look for a good sauce for them, but they're a great recipe to have on hand!

OMG, these were so delicious! I did end up putting 2 eggs in it and it made them stick together more. I will take the advise of others to make them smaller next time, so the inside will cook a little more. DH actually thought they were crab cakes. Thank you for this recipe and thanks to all the others with their reviews and different suggestions. We loved these. If you haven't tried these make sure you do, I don't think you will regret it.

Best zucchini cakes recipe I've tried! Changes:  I just used bread crumbs instead of the 'butter flavored crackers" because those all taste fake to me. You HAVE to get rid of the water in the shredded zucchini for any zucchini cake recipe. I lightly salt it, toss, and leave in a colander for an hour. Then press with paper towels.  I also added one stalk finely diced celery and doubled the amount of Old Bay seasoning. Easy and delicious... good for the massive amounts of zucchini from the garden!

Instead of butter flavored crackers, I just used breadcrumbs, and then fried it in butter and fresh garlic. The taste was much different that I was expecting, but very enjoyable. I didn't use seafood seasoning, so I added 1/2 tsp. of salt, minced garlic, dried onions, and crushed red pepper. I had a little trouble getting the consistency right, but it worked out, even still.
I will most likely make this again, multiple times.

These are just sooooooooo good! I was late making dinner & did not allow the shredded zucchini time to drain & I used 2 eggs as suggested, which let to the batter being quite runny in no time.  However, I made them smaller & they tasted wonderful!  Next time I will let zucchini drain though.  My husband loved them!  Cathy L.

I called these zuccinini cookies and my kids loved them! I made a few adjustments as others had recommended including skipping the crackers. I baked them at 350 for 10min then flipped and they were lovely brown and tasted yummy!! Definitely a repeat in my house.

THESE CAKES WERE SOOOO YUMMY. FROM THE REVIEWS, I EXPECTED THEM TO BE GOOD, BUT THEY HAVE TO BE TASTED TO BE BELIEVED. I DID ADD LEMON AND MINCED GARLIC, AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. I SERVED WITH A MIXTURE OF LEMON, PAPRIKA, AND MIRACLE WHIP FOR DIPPING.

I took these to a dinner, fried them up on the stove there and served piping hot - they were very tasty and we all agreed we would make them again.  I omitted the onion for personal preference and added in garlic instead.  I think the addition of Parmesan cheese in this recipe would be very good, too.  I also plan on trying to bake the patties, and will roll in crumbs and then lightly spray w/my olive oil sprayer and then bake to see how that works.  All in all, a very nice recipes, thanks!

I thought this was a great idea. I think next time I will make smaller patties. I felt that they were getting burnt before the middle was getting cooked. Flavor was good, a little heavy but would make again.

We thought these were awesome, husband couldn't get enough and the kids liked them too!! I didn't use seafood seasoning because I wanted them to taste like zucchini cakes.  I used a regular seasoning instead.  Next time I will dry them out more first and make them smaller. as they didn't hold together very well. We used ranch as a dipping saucce.  Also, the prep time is extrememly decieving (or just plain wrong) It takes WAY longer than five minutes to get these ready.

these were delicious.  I served them with a grilled pork loin and roasted sweet potatoes. I ate two before we even sat down, and skipped the pork and just ate these.  They were even good leftover--cold.

I love to try new recipes and this was a good one. I made it exactly the way it was written except I used Panko bread crumbs instead of the crackers. I would make this again.

Absolutely Wonderful!  I am allergic to eggs and seafood, so I had to use egg re-placer and a different seasoning but they were great!  My husband could not get enough.  I will be making these again and again.  Thank You!

These were delicious! Easy to make. The only difference was I made garlic croutons and used them for the seasoned bread crumbs. Yummy stuff!

I wish I could give this more stars.  It is one of the go to recipes in my vegetarian household.  Honestly one of the best things I have ever found on this website.  It makes me miss crab cakes a little less and is so easy to whip up on a week night.  Thank you!
