I made some significant changes, but it was very good. For the casserole, I used meatloaf (ground veal, beef, and pork) instead of ground beef, a large can of chopped tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, and I added fresh basil, garlic, a can of tomato paste, and a half a pound of bowtie pasta. I also changed the topping. Instead of bread crumbs and butter, I used grated romano and mozzarella cheese.

This is literally one of the BEST dishes I have ever tasted. The combination of flavors was perfect. My modifications were that I used half ground beef and half ground turkey, I sauteeed the eggplant along with the beef, onion, and green pepper (I used a big pot for this since I also doubled the recipe basically throwing the meat and veggies all in and stirring until cooked). I also added Parmesan and Gouda to the breadcrumb topping - the Gouda went perfectly with the other flavors! I added a bag of frozen spinach to the meat-veggie mixture, and I used canned instead of fresh tomatoes. It was great right away, and my husband even enjoyed taking it as a cold lunch.  A fantastic, healthy-ish recipe that I will DEFINITELY be making again, soon.

Great recipe! I read the reviews on here before I made it, and took some advice. I added 2 teaspoons of Italian seasoning to the mix, used canned tomatoes, and put breadcrumbs and mozzarella on the top. Mine came out really wet, so I would recommend drying out the eggplant a little after it's boiled. Other than that there were no problems and the taste was great!

Good, easy and healthy recipe, but a little bland. I added some Italian seasoning and topped it with parmesean cheese.

I made a vegan version by substituting sliced portabello mushrooms for the ground meat.  It was quite good.  Also, add 2 cloves of garlic and sustitute garlic salt for plain salt.  Add melted cheese to bread crumb topping.

Everyone at the table loved this dish.  I added some garlic and garlic salt to the beef and veggies while cooking.  I also added a few sweet peppers and shredded cheese.  The final touch was some parmesean mixed in with the bread crumbs and butter.  Will definitly make this again :)

Excellent!  Great flavor!  I added a 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese and the flavor popped!  This will become a regular at our house!

This recipe is very bland as written. If I try it again I will add a teaspoon of minced garlic and a tablespoon of Emeril's Original Essence to the meat while cooking.  I will eliminate the butter and top with plain breadcrumbs. I may add a bit of cheese as well.  This is a good base recipe. Add your own flair!

I concur with the salting, draining and roasting. Then throw in all the spices you want and clean out the veggie drawer while you're at it!

Just OK. Didn't feel it was a good use of my fresh veggies.  Only had 1# of ground beef so added a half pound of baby portebella mushrooms. Added some garlic and herbs to the mixture and some parmesan cheese in the topping...still kind of bland.

I've made this twice now.  Both times, without the beef.  It's probably good with the beef, but I wanted to taste the eggplant more.  I follow the rest of the recipe, except saute the veggies in butter (Smart Balance).  My other two additions are mushrooms (to replace the meat and cuz I love them), and garlic powder, because I love garlic.  The breadcrumb mixture is the coup de gras, as it compliments the flavors and adds a little texture.  Love it!

Very good!  I added Italian Seasoning to the meat mixture and a shredded Italian blend cheese to the bread crumbs.  Everyone loved it, and it was easy to make.

Thanks for getting me out of my baba ghanoush rut. This recipe is a solid start, and I'm really glad it has no cheese. I modified it heavily to add flavor: 1) sliced, salted, drained, then roasted eggplant and drizzled with balsamic vinegar; 2) added layers of caramelized onions and carrots, chopped spinach, large can of crushed tomatoes; 3) seasoned tomato and eggplant with oregano, rosemary, celery seed and garlic; 4) omitted the milk (no lactose for me). Turned out great. Next time I'll add mushrooms per the vegan suggestion earlier.

This was a very quick, easy and delicious dish.  I used canned diced tomatoes and would suggest draining them very well so dish isn't watery.  I also added sliced mushrooms and topped it with crumbled Ritz and breadcrumbs.  My family loved it and we will definitely be having it again.

This is great!  I read some reviews and modified it as follows:  I didn't boil the eggplant, I cooked it together with the ground turkey (instead of beef), onion & green pepper (I only had half an onion & green pepper but it worked well).  With that I added 2 tsp each of garlic powder & italian seasoning, then threw in some garlic salt & pepper to taste.  Used 1 small can of tomato paste & large can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh tomatoes. Added 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese to the mix before transferring to the baking dish.  Finally added a layer of Sargento 6 cheese italian (2 cups) to the top before throwing on the bread crumbs.  It turned out delicious!

Tried this recipe because I wanted to use up some egg plants a friend of mine gave me.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the green peppers (didn't have any on hand).  It was okay--not a lot of taste;a little bland.  Seemed like it was missing some "oomp".

Definitely a yummy and healthy casserole.  I agree with some other reviewers that it is a bit bland, so next time i'll use the italian breadcrumbs as others suggested.  I did add a 1/2 can paste and used two ground up hamburgers instead of the 1 1/2 lbs ground beef since I didn't have time to defrost.  Will also try to make it a vegetarian dish another time! A keeper for me!

This was absolutely delicious! It was a very light dish for being a casserole and had tons of flavor when we added more herbs and spices.  I went along with adding 1 can tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes and that created a great texture for the recipe!  My housemates loved it and it was great as leftovers!

I enjoyed this a lot. I added mozzarella cheese to the top, as well as oregano and basil. I also used Italian bread crumbs instead of regular.   I think next time I will mix the cheese into the ingredients to make it even cheesier. It would also be nice with mushrooms and broccoli added.

This was a very tasty dish. I did make a few changes to add a bit more flavor and to make it Vegetarian friendly. I used canned diced tomatoes with Oregano and garlic. Instead of using ground beef I used a product called Morning Star Griller Crumbles. Do the veggies as directed, then add the crumbles and stir constantly (because they will stick) just until they are warmed. Then I added the eggplant and continued with the directions. My husband who is a firefighter took the leftovers to work and they didn't last long. They are asking for it again.

i really enjoyed this dish; however, my husband and 4 year old son were not as sold on it, so i probably won't make it again. but you should; it was tasty. i took some tips from other reviewers and added a little fresh garlic, italian seasoning and garlic salt. also sauteed the eggplant with the other stuff and drained the pan twice - once after the meat was cooked and once after the tomatoes cooked. i was really wondering how the egg/milk was going to work out, but it did and the dish was not runny at all. i had three helpings.

I added some raw cheddar and fresh garlic.  Also substituted out the breadcrumbs for a gluten free meal.  This dish was really good.

I used a red pepper (rather than green) and added a little fresh spinach, with good results.  Neither my husband nor I are eggplant fans, but this is a very good recipe!  Nest time I may saute the eggplant with the meat mixture rather than boiling it, as it did seem to hold a bit more water than I expected

very good recipe for something to do with eggplant besides eggplant parm.  my additions - add garlic and italian seasoning to the meat when cooking, add 2 cups of cheese to the casserole and another 2 cups of cheese on the top then the bread crumbs.  i used sargento  6 cheese italian.  great with rice or mashed potatoes (for a shepherd pie feeling)

I did not care for this. Made recipe as is and turned out to be soggy and very egg tasting. Will not be making again. Also, used pan recommended and found that the recipe had no depth. You either need a smaller pan or to double it up.

I changed it up a bit, like many others. I added some veggies (portabellos, yellow and green squash), garlic, and basil and oregano from my herb garden. To add a little flavor I boiled the veggies in broth with a little water added instead of just water, and like other people I used garlic salt instead of plain salt. Delicious!!! I could also see adding a dash of white wine to this dish, but for now I'll just have it on the side. Healthtacular!

I took lots of suggestions from the comments section... I used a yellow bell pepper, added 16 oz baby portabella mushrooms, used a can of diced tomatoes, and subsituted Italian sausage for the beef.  I cooked the sausage with minced garlic, then added the onion, peppers, and tomatoes with Garlic Basil Seasoning.  I also used 2 cups mozzarella in the mix.  It was delicious!  All I'll do differently next time is use a larger can of diced tomatoes.

I'll be making this again! I changed a few things, as others suggested. No meat, instead I used spaghetti squash.

I baked this last night, but with just a few changes.  I loved it so much I ate it for breakfast as well!  :)  I used less ground beef, more eggplant, left out the green pepper, used canned tomatoes, and added mozzarella cheese inside the mixture & on the top.  I added italian seasoning to the bread crumb topping, gave it an extra flavor, which was delish!!  Good, good stuff.  :)  Will definitely be making again!!

Good basic dish.  I added a tablespoon of fresh basil, teaspoon of fresh oregano, half teaspoon of dried thyme, would've added garlic if I had any.  I also cooked the eggplant in with the beef and other veg.  I only used 1 lb beef, but even with 1.5 lb I can't see this serving 8; we got 4 servings out of it.

This was good - a great way to use up the eggplant in the garden - but it wasn't great, and it didn't keep well.  After 3 days in the fridge it had to go.  I'd make it again, but a smaller batch probably.
