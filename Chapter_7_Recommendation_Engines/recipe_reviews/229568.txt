This recipe was a light, refreshing, summer salad.  We really enjoyed the brightness from the lemon juice and lemon zest.   I am not a fan when a recipe says juice of a lemon or 1/2 a bunch of parsley because the amounts can vary depending on the size of your ingredients.  My general rule of thumb is 3 tbsp. of lemon juice for an average sized lemon.  3 tbsp. was the perfect amount for my salad.  My parsley bunch was very large and 1/2 bunch would have way overwhelmed the salad.  I used about 1/4 of my bunch that equaled to about 1/2 cup chopped.  I would start out lower on your parsley amount and adjust to your taste.  Nice side dish that I would make again.  It would also be great with some cherry tomatoes added in.

A Keeper! Intriguing flavors which evolve with sitting: 3 hrs after making it was very tasty & Very Lemony; after 24 hrs the lemon flavor had mellowed substantially yet was still nicely lemony (used fresh lemon & lemon zest, as called for). I substituted fresh basil for the parsley & the result was excellent; also used light agave syrup instead of sugar (easier to mix) which reduced the 'sweet' measurement in the recipe to 1 tsp with no diminution of flavor. We mixed green & yellow squashes which made a very attractive presentation. Well-refrigerated, the salad kept very nicely over 3 days. Altogether a lovely recipe with great potential for adding your own particular flavor flourishes!   [Cilantro (coriander leaf) might also be a nice change from parsley & we plan to try that next while we have it in the garden, as store-bought parsley & green zucchini will be our wintertime choices for this dish.]

Made this twice and the family loved it. Used Persian cucumbers and added a tablespoon of Joy mayonnaise. Very tasty. Next time I will try adding some sesame seeds.

This salad was excellent, and I will definitely make again.  The family really liked the lemony dressing.

I used a potato peeler to cut the zucchini very thinly.  Very lemoney flavor.  Tastes like summer.  My husband doesn't like zucchini, but he liked this salad.
