I didn't make this exactly by the recipe, but based on what I did, I'm assuming it's great.  I followed it exactly, but didn't make the sauce (because I was lazy, I just used a bottled BBQ sauce) and it was SO GOOD.  My husband loved it, and has already asked for it again.  I also mixed in a ladel-full of water and some of the onions once I put it in the oven.  It was so tender and delicious!

One of the best recipes on the internet. I cooked this for my wife and kids and they all enjoyed it. I have a bunch of picky eaters and this one was hit so I will definitely make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I modified a bit by using half beef, half pork country style ribs for a variety.  Also boiled them in beer instead of water.  Added some molassas to the sauce and voila.  Perfection!  Will be keeping this one around.

I thought this was an exceptional recipe.  I only wish I had done a better job of buying my ribs...they were a bit too fatty...certainly not the fault of the recipe! The only change I made was the addition of some liquid smoke and molasses to the sauce.  Wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing!

These turned out great!  I actually cooked them a bit longer on the stove because I had a cake in the oven at the same time then left them in the oven for an hour and a half.  They were better than fork tender.  I added a few things to the sauce to spice it up-some ancho chile powder and chipotle powder, but it just depends on the level of spice you're into. We plan on using the leftovers for sandwiches tomorrow-just shred the beef and add some bbq sauce and it's a great sandwich.

This recipe is amazing, and although time consuming, very easy to make. My whole family, including my picky 2 and 4 year old gobbled it up. I subbed garlic powder and onion powder because I didn't have the real ingredients on hand and it was perfect. I recommend and will make this again

My only comment is that more water was needed to boil than the recipe called for and more sauce for the final cooking stage.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

I followed this recipe to the letter. The ribs were delicious, but the sauce was burnt to a crisp. I think there should be more liquid. Next time, I would add at least one or two more cups of water, in addition to the ketchup.  Otherwise, great recipe!

Yum-Tweaked it! It was tender, fell off the bone.  I added 2Tbsp worcestershire, 1 Tbsp and a half of honey and sprinkled Mrs. Dash to season the meat (pre-sauce) Half way thru cooking I added close to a Bottle of krafts BBQ Sauce will cook again!

I doubled the sauce recipe and still was barely enough.  These ribs were very tender but we really didn't like the sauce.  I image it is taste preference.

We love Sweet Baby Rays BBW sauce so I opted to add that with the ketsup. I also added brown sugar instead of the white sugar, but I added more! I included some of the water from boiling with the onions in one glass pan and none in the other(my kids hate onions) and the one with the juice was alot more moist. But I will only cook them for about 30 minutes next time. they got too done in the hour and a 1/4. Hubby was eating them before I got on and said just heat them enough to warm the sauce next time!

i gave this a four cause it simply takes too long but besides that it was really an easy good recipe i altered it a little though i used no lemon juice and added a little worchestchire sauce and i also added a little brn sugar also i think when you go to put this in the oven add a little water to your sauce too thick without but all in all it was ok

This is a great recipe. I added worschester sauce to add to the flavor. You need to add less salt if you add worchester sauce. All in all, my family loved it!

This was a hit. I added some spices to the braising liquid, cumin, garlic...I imagine any thing you like will do.  I had to braise longer, because some of my ribs were sort of tough.  Like others I used onions from the liquid, Plus thinly sliced onions under the ribs in the baking dish.  Used our favorite store bought BBQ sauce , covered and baked.  Ours took longer to bake but I cooked them lower and slower than recipe. Because store sauce was so thick I added a cup of the braising liquid.  This is a great jumping off recipe and easy easy easy to make for large groups or big families.  
Thanks Margery!!!! I would have never thought of this myself.  Will be making this for my sons and grandsons very soon.

I made these the other night and they were a huge hit! Although I used a bottled BBQ sauce, basic recipe is what I was looking for because I did not know how to cook short ribs. They were fall of the bone tender and the kids loved them! I will be making this again!

great recipe,the meat is tender and delicious! I actually used Stubb's b-b-q sauce mixed with their basting sauce. My mother loved it, since it was her mother's day dinner, she had to try it as skeptical as she was, but in the end it came out just perfect!

Ribs were melt in your mouth tender but the flavor was lacking. Try a different sauce over these ribs.

Great recipe! My family of picky eaters all loved it. My youngest one still talks about it and keeps asking when I am going to make it again. Really easy with great flavor.

Pretty good ribs recipe. I didn't give it a 5 since I didn't use the sauce. Plus, I don't think I'm a ribs gal.

I fixed these over the course of two days.  I braised, put in the refrigerator overnight and finished in the oven the following day (due to time constraint).  They came out okay, not as tender as I was expecting.  The sauce wasn't award-winning, but it was still decent.  Overall, I was satisfied with the recipe and will try again with some adjustments.

I give it a star for the way the meat fell off the bones, otherwise the ribs were pretty much tasteless. My husband has requested I not make this resipe again.

Flavorful and tender!  My husband asked me to add maple syrup and brown sugar to it for a sweeter sauce, so I did.  It was a hit with the family.

Good recipe, but needed more sauce for my taste.  I'll keep this recipe handy though!  Served it with mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus - delicious!

First time cooking beef short ribs. Made it pretty much as written but thought that the sauce was lacking. Ended up adding a good amount of our fave bbq sauce to the mix - a big improvement. Really liked the end result but wished that they were a bit more sticky and/or crispier. Will have tioo experiment a bit next time. Thanks, Margery!
