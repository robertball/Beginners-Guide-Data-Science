Amazingly good!  Very caramel-ly!  I was lazy and didn't want to bother with a pie crust, so just made it as a crisp.  I even left the peels on. I will make this again and again (a good way to use up too many ripe pears).

This was amazing. I made it with combination of two types of pears and some granny smith apples. Next time, I might even make it as a crumble/crisp because the crust was not even needed!

I've been meaning to write my review for a few weeks now...after having made this pie 3 times already this Fall. I wasn't too sure about the Cheddar cheese but was it ever the best! The topping is just sweet enough to offset the pear filling. We had so many left-over pears and this was a wonderful way to use them up. I even made a pie for my neighbors..they loved it! Thanks much for sharing.

YUMMY!  Made it exact and loved it!  Used sharp cheddar but you really don't taste the cheese - will probably use a little more next time. Thank you!

So good, have made twice. One time I used fresh pears the other time canned (fresh was better but canned still tasted dang good). I used one full cup os sharp cheese and I didnt have cornstarch so I used flour. 1 tblsp of cornstarch= 2 tblsp of flour

In france they have cheese after the meal and then dessert. this is like the combined two if you didnt think you had space for the both. really awesome and made it with Roblochon instead of cheddar which is the special cheese of the area. i also didnt have a pie crust, or any cornstarch or enough flour so i used oats and bread crumbs in replace of the both. suuuper!

This is by far the best pie.  I originally made this many years ago and I was the only one who ate it -- the guys at my house thought it was "okay'. This year I have received an abundance of pears and have probably made it at least a  half dozen times.   It is that good and my siblings liked it so it is a good potluck dish.  I do recommend using the sharp cheddar cheese though to balance out the sweetness of the pears.

I made this as mini pies in a muffin tin when I realized I had no available pie plates!  This was good, but I was expecting a little more from the cheddar; I couldn't even tell it was there.  This does taste like apple pie, just a touched more sweet.  This is def worth trying & I will prob make it again, should I have pears in need of using in the future.  If I make it again, I think I'll shred my own cheese (used pre-shredded from a bag) and see if that helps.

This pie was incredible!! Made it to take to my mother-in-law. We all were skeptical at first, but then we all had to have seconds!! It was gone in no time with 5 of us!!! Definitally a keeper. My husband won't eat pears once they soften. I always hated to throw them away. Very happy to have this recipe!!! Will make this again and again and again!!!

Very good flavor.  I omitted the crust and made cheddar pear crisp.  I also added a dash of cloves, 3/4 tsp. minced ginger, and replaced the cornstarch with 1 tbs. tapioca.  This recieved rave reviews from everyone who tried it!

This was AMAZING!  I added some cloves by accident which I think made it even better.  Next time I'll use more cheddar, or sharper cheddar.

Wow!! What a good pie! I thought a pear pie would be too bland, but this recipe has lots of flavor and the crunchy topping adds even more. Might be too sweet for some, but I liked it and so did my husband.

This pie is super good and easy to make! The pears I used were almost too ripe so they gave lots of flavor to this recipe. I also used sharp cheddar cheese. The contrast in flavor was amazing. My family loved it!!

Did not change a thing. Bought my own pie crust. Was very very good! Pears were very sweet.Bartlett pears were used. People thought it was an apple pie. Will make again. (I could not taste the cheese, might increase it the next time and/or use sharp as stated by other users)

This is really good! I made exactly as directed and the only change that I would make next time is that I would add a little more cheese (could not taste it at all!). My entire family enjoyed it and I think that it will make it to my Thanksgiving table. :)

This was excellent.  I've made two different pies and used some old home canned fruit (one was peaches, one was apples).  It turned out great.  Family and friends loved it!

Delicious!!! This one is a keeper. I did have to make some minor adjustments. 1) Substituted cornstarch for flour.  2) Chopped my pears into chunks instead of slices because they are not supermarket "pretty".  3) Divided the pears and crumble to make two pies instead of one because 6 cups of chopped pears wouldn't fit in one pie. Made thin pie crust and the pies were ready in about 30 mins. Brought a piece to my mom and she LOVED it.

Very good pie. Enjoyed the savory/sweet combination. 
Followed the recipe as written except I used arrowroot in place of the cornstarch as that is what I keep on hand.
Will definately make again :)

I made this pie last night to test it out before Thanksgiving dinner. Its AMAZING! Everyone was skeptical of the name but it is delicous. I used a refrigerated pie crust that wasnt very deep so I had enough filling for two pies. If you are planning on using this type of crust I would be prepared to have filling for two pies or cut down the amount of pairs you use.

I received this recipe in the Pie Countdown email and it just sounded too interesting to not try.  It was very good and easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and used Bosc pears which held up quite well.

Fantastic pie.  I had been having a craving for pie and got this in my e-mail and wanted to try it.  It wasn't hard at all.  I put a little more topping than called for but the rest of it followed to the letter.  I gave 4 stars because it was a bit runny, but it maybe even better tomorrow, we'll have to see.

I haven't made this recipe myself yet, but every time I go to visit Mommachef it is on my request list.  Mommachef is a fabulous cook and it says a lot that out of her arsenal of awesome this is one that we come back to again and again.  Thanks for posting the recipe--I'm sure it will be in my oven very soon!

I made this for a Christmas party last weekend. It was one of the first pies to be gobbled up!
I was given a box of apples and fancy pears about a week and a half ago. Pears go bad so fast, so I looked around for something unique to do with them. I'm so happy I found this recipe!

This was a great way to use up those pears that are almost 'over the edge'.  It was relatively easy, and very tasty.  When I mixed up the crumble top I had a little bit of shredded cheese left and threw it in the center, on top.  I don't recommend that - made a hard crust in the center that was difficult to cut through.  Chill it a bit to give the filling time to set - it will be easier to cut.

This is amazing! The only thing I would do next time is possibly add a little cheese at the very end for a more cheesy flavor, but it is perfect as is.

Very Good!  I just used a regular 9 " frozen pie crust - next time I think I will use a larger one or not put as many pears in recipe. Will definitely fix again!

Was easy to make and received great reviews from our guests - fed four of us with us all having second servings. 

A few minor changes: I didn't bother with the pie crust (who needs the extra calories) and I added a little tapioca to make sure it wouldn't be too liquidy.  Used sharp cheddar cheese - the only kind I buy.  Will make again if I ever need to use up a bunch of ripe pears.

Amazing!!  Annoyed with pears canned before they were ripe, so drained and sliced them.  I left out the pie crust and added 1/2 cup quick  to the crumble.

No good at all the first day.  Very weird to mix a mild pear flavor with a strong cheese flavor.  It was much better the second and third day.  Still, not enough to make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly but was disappointed in the results.  The flavor of the pie was great, but the cheese gave the topping a weird, chewy consistency insteady of a crispy, crumbly one, which I expected.  Is that the way it's supposed to be?

I was unsure about the cheddar, but this dish turned out to be delicious!! Like many other reviewers, I skipped the crust and just made it as a crisp.  I also doubled the recipe and gave one to my neighbors, who very much enjoyed it. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. I used medium cheddar, and it was perfect. I’ll definitely be making this again! Next time I might add a bit of nutmeg, just to give it an extra amount of autumn zing!

This is a good base recipe. We use gruyere. We roll some into the crust dough. We also prefer a lattice to a crumble...the crumble is tasty.

I liked this recipe, but I found it was a little too sweet for my taste. Also, I used a Muenster cheese instead of Cheddar, hoping for a more 'smoky' flavor, but to my disappointment, I could barely taste it at all. Next time I will tweak it a bit.

didn't use the pie crust, and substituted 6 tbsps of flour for the cornstarch, also left the peel on the pears.  Added 1/3 cup of raisins as well.  The pear cheese crumble was a hit will make it again.

i used a stronger cheese and loved it - also added 1 cup 35% cream to the tossed pears - yes i know, way more calories, but if im going to eat pie...
anyway, never had pear pie before and now i think i like it better than apple!

Good recipe!!  I was hoping for more cheese flavor - I will simply sprinkle more cheddar (at least 1/2 cup more) over the top next time I bake this.  Delicious, the kids loved it!

This works well without a pastry crust.  Just spray pie pan with Pam.  In fact, I was distracted at a crucial point and mixed the topping in with everything else and it was still wonderful!  Good hot or cold.

It was a great foundational recipe, and I would make it again.  I had less pears than required, so I threw in an apple.  I also used sharp cheddar, though it was *not* very evident in the taste of the pie. It has a great fruit pie flavor, and I think next time I would add chopped walnuts to the crumble topping for nice compliment.

From the reviews I thought this is going to be an excellent pie, but it didn't live up to my hopes. This was my very first pie ever! I was confused as how big of a pie shell does this 6 cups of pears need. It'd have been easier for me. I've settled with 9" pie shell. It was probably a bad choice. I had 5 cups of pears after chopping, and it was full! I mean overflowing, the "crumbles" were heaping over the top. Oh, the crumbles! I don't know what was wrong, but I followed the recipe... and with a pastry blender I was cutting in the butter... it was a disaster! It didn't work out for me. The dry ingredients were too much and did not cling to the butter the next second it was a mush. I had to kind of scrape it in little bits on top of the pie. My husband loves it though. I think it is just average.
