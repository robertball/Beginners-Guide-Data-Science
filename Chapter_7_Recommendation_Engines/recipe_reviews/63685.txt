Very easy and tasty! I liked the ginger flavor, and this was wonderful chopped up and added to a salad the next day. I will be making this one again.

I used Chicken Tenders and baked them rather than pan-fried. The lemon flavor and ginger go well together. Definitely worth trying!

Very good as is, but I cheat a little and use 2 tsp canola oil instead of just a spray.  It's also great with fillet of grouper . .  this fish has a texture similar to chicken breast.

I felt like the marinade didn't make enough for all the chicken breasts so next time I'll probably double the ingredients for the sauce.  But they turned out moist and lemony and were quite good!  I'll probably add some herbs next time to give it a little more flavor.

Loved it! The only thing I did differently is I didn’t measure anything, just did it by guess and it was perfect. You really can’t go wrong unless you go crazy with the ingredients. I also made the marinade over the chicken in a bowl, then tossed it. Made for a quicker clean up.

This dish was very easy. The only change I made was to use chicken tenderloins 2/person. Plenty of flavor, nice and healthy!

I don't know If I give this a 4 or a 5, there is 
absolutely nothing wrong with it.  In fact I thought it would be very bland due to lack of ingredients and the amount of ingredients.  Boy was I wrong and I only marinated it for and hour.  In addition, I used the lemon concentrate not real lemon, so I am sure it should taste much better.  I enjoy this dish, not bland, but no overly seasoned. Really easy and I will make again.

Update:  The next day it was extremely bland.  I guess it just tasted good coming out of the oven. I will try again with real lemon and if it tast e the same then this is not a keeper.

Very tasty and easy.  I usually let it marinate overnight to get more flavor.

I really liked this recipe, but I had to do a lot of changes due to what I had in the kitchen.


Update: I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, 2 teaspoons of ground ginger, and 2 teaspoons of garlic powder.  Next time I will up the ground ginger...

I did make this again, this time using 3 teaspons of the ginger.  Of course, it turned into a paste, but I just diluted it with some water.  Much more zippy - Yum!

I actually cut down on the lemon in this recipe and it was still pretty lemon-y, but very flavorful for sure. I ended up chopping this up with grilled vegetables and adding it to the Easy Olive Tomato Basic Pasta (also listed on this site)and it made for an absolutely fantastic pairing. My kids and family loved it and with the pasta and veggies the lemon was not at all overpowering. Such a great blend of flavors! I will be definitely repeating that combo for sure.

Be sure to use fresh lemon juice.  Using concentrated lemon juice from the bottle makes this VERY tart.

Really tasty. Instead of grilling the breasts, I covered then with tin foil and baked them in the oven. Very good recipe :)

Made this dish and my boyfriend LOVED it! The lemon was a bit much...next time I'll cut it down just a touch.  Marinating for a long time is key...I had to rush and it could only marinate for the 30 minutes, but overnight would probably allow the ginger flavor to take center stage. Made it with brown rice and mixed veggies...very healthy and tasty!

Also added some salt and a little chili garlic paste to marinade. Used a little olive oil in glass corning ware and dribled a little over chicken breasts - put under broiler to brown a little. Then covered and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes. At end added chopped cilantro. Great!

I love ginger and lemon so this was the perfect combination. It's a nice change from the normally used chicken spices.

My first thought was: "how can this tiny bit of marinade season all my chicken".  After cooking it, I was pleasantly surprised at the "big taste".  I added salt (since I'm not on a diet) and it was great.  Even my kids ate this.  My only regret was not making more.

Not bad. Not great but at least it's another way to serve up just plain-old chicken.  And I usually have all these ingredients on-hand so it's easy to throw together.

I thought this was very good.  It was the first time I've bothered using fresh ginger and wow, what flavor!  We grilled ours and it turned out perfect.
