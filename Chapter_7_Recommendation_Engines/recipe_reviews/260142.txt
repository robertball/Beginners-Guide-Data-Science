Tasty! Great winter recipe. I used double the tempeh since I had some that needed to be used. I also needed to use a bunch of fresh tomatoes  so I subbed those for half the canned tomatoes. Added salt to taste and cayenne for spice. Thanks!

Recipe came out pretty good. I will day that I ended up using one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and another 28oz can of tomato sauce. I also added a little more of the seasoning in the recipe. I can say that I definitely recommend this especially if you are Kokomo incorporate tempeh into your dinner rotation.

This was a good recipe. I used 32 ounces of  tomato sauce that I made from fresh tomatoes. I used 3 cans of beans. Although I used a 4 quart pan for cooking this, I didn't have room for the corn and one of the peppers. I served this with some vegan cheese and it came out great. I will definitely make this again.

Pretty good and I added my own twist which was pepper powder, peruvian beans instead of canellini beans, and himalayan sea salt w/extra spice mix. Turned out great!

We really liked it.  I had to add some water which I got from rinsing out the can of crushed tomatoes.  I was surprised that there was no mention at all of salt.  I added some -- maybe a teaspoon.  I also wished it were a little hotter.  Next time I might add a jalapeno.  It's very hearty, and, of course, gets better as it melds together.  Thanks, Scooter.
