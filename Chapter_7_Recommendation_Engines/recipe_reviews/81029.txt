I made this dish for Christmas Eve last year.  The flavor was spectacular, but I will include some type of thickening agent next time as the sauce is on the thin side.

An excellent dish! It proved convenient as well for dinner with friends. I made it in the morning till the point before you put it in the oven. I kept it in the fridge and then, while we were having a drink with appetizers at dinner, I put it in the oven for 20 minutes! If you like your meat well done though, you should leave it longer, maybe 30. The porcinis are delicious and the sauce didn't come out thin at all and I used light cream, not the thick kind. However, next time I think I will omit the stock cube as it takes away the totally 'home made' feel from the dish.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good. We used an obscene amount of garlic (that's how things are done in my house) and also alot of pepper. I also went overboard with the mushrooms, which may have given it a stronger flavor than it needed. The sauce did thin out a bit once it was in the oven with the tenderloins-I'm positive it will thicken with the leftovers. My picky seven year old who doesn't even like steak devoured it-  and my husband loved it.We'll be making it again.

After reading several expert reviews, I used 3/4 oz. dried porcini mushrooms in 2/3 cup water, thickened sauce with roux, omitted cube, vidalia onion, and a splash of cabernet. Had 1 1/2 " medallions seared in pan and finished in oven without sauce on them uncovered for 15 minutes for medium rare. Served with sauce and garlic mashed potatoes.  Absolutely delicious!!!!

I substitued fresh chanterelle mushrooms and the flavor was incredible. Also, I used Elk tenderloin, which, in my opinion, is far superior to beef.

Very good.  I found 15 minutes was not quite long enough in the oven and my meat was stil quite raw.  I went 20 minutes but unless you like your beef still bleeding, I'd go as long as 30minutes for a rare to med-rare piece of beef, depending on how thick your medallions are (mine were about 1 1/2 inches).  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this meal was REALLY good, simple, easy to follow, and worthy of beef tenderloin.  LOVE the 'shrooms!  Thanks for sharing such a delicious and simple recipe!

This beef recipe is delicious. My DH and I both loved it. I had 1 pound of beef tenderloin that I cut up into medallions myself. This is a cheaper way to go. I also only had 1/2 oz of dried porcini mushrooms and used 1/2 cup of water to hydrate, used vidalia onion and 3 large cloves of garlic. I browned the meat thoroughly and left a very pink center. 20 minutes in the oven was perfect and the meat came out medium rare. Perfection. Try this recipe you won't be diasppointed.

This was very, very tasty.  It was the first time I had used dried porcini mushrooms, and I am now a big fan of them.   At the end, I did thicken the gravy with a bit of flour.

I think next time I will  skip the roasted potatoes in exchange for garlic mashed potatoes.   And I like the idea of adding a tbsp or 2 of bordeaux to the gravy.  I think that would take it over the top.

Recipe was well received by all who ate it. We did use a little extra butter and sprinkled dish with some chopped parsley before serving for color. Pretty easy to make and would be great for entertaining. We served with green beans almondine.

Awesome!  Next time will make sure use heavy cream.  Used real torn up mushrooms as didn't have porcini mushrooms.  Added 3/4 small chopped onion and 2-3 green chopped onions and 2 tspns garlic.  Skipped the potatoes, salt and thyme part.  Made separate mashed potatoes.

Very good, even with the few minor substitutions I made.  I did not have the Porcini so I used button and I swapped out the water and the bouillon cube for beef broth.  Would probably be better if I had the porcinis but it was still very good and I will probably make it again.

Really great with beef but even better with a pork roast. Try it out. I have also substituted shallots for the red onions. They are a bit more subtle than the red onions. Fabulous!

Husband is a meat and potatoes guy - I like more "sophisticated" food.  This dish appealed to both of us, is good for company also because it can seem elegant and doesn't tie you up in the kitchen for too long.

Very flavorful.I was a little disappointed with the consistency of the sauce and would most likely use a roux next time to thicken it a bit. Using the pan drippings is a great help, perhaps a little bordeaux or port for added flavor as well.  I would serve this with garlic mashed potatoes rather than the roasted ones in the recipe. Additionaly, some pasta would also go very well.  I made the mistake of cutting the tenderloin medallions too thin (1/4 inch) and would go to 1/2 inch next time. Easier to keep them medium or medium rare.  All in all, a good recipe and we will enjoy it again.  Note: The leftovers heated up the next day had a more intense flavor!!

This was very good!  I used venison tenderloin and portabella mushrooms.  I cooked the onions and mushrooms AFTER I cooked the meat to utilize the pan drippings and therefore omit the bullion cube.  My sauce didn't thicken as many others mentioned, so next time I will cook it a bit longer and ensure it thickens before I roast it all in the oven.

I didn't use porcinis, so I just sauteed the bella mushrooms as I normally would.  I substituted half and half for the heavy cream, and cut and essentially diced the potatoes, otherwise I thought they might take much longer than the meat to cook.  I did add some cornstarch to the mushroom mixture, but not sure that was necessary.  I roasted for 20 minutes, then realized the beef was not done, however 10 more minutes was too long.  Next time I will do 23-25.  Thanks!

This recipe is sooo fabulous.  We made it for an early Valentine's dinner and it was totally luxurious and completely befitting of the occasion.  I normally hate onions and was worried about the pungency of the red onion but it cooked down absolutely deliciously (half was enough for us) - it's the first time I felt like an onion really truly complemented a sauce perfectly. I had a hard time finding new potatoes (in the dead of winter) and ended up using Yukon golds that we peeled and cut into 1 inch chunks.  Next time I will cook it 8-10 minutes as after 5, they were still hard even after roasting.  I didn't think the beef bouillon took away from the flavor, it made a really nice, beefy, mushroomy sauce.  We trimmed the beef our self and cut them into 1" thick medallions.  The beef came out PERFECTLY medium rare, I just can't say enough about this recipe.  Can't wait to make it for company!

This is my go-to tenderloin recipe, such a nice combo with the creamy porcini sauce and potatoes. It gets compliments every time! Make sure to fry the potatoes well so they retain some crunch when roasting (if you like to have some crunchy and some soft).

This really didn't have that much flavor.  The sauce was much too thin.  All in all, it was a lot of work for a mediocre meal.
