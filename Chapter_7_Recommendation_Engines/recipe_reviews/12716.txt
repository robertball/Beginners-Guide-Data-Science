This one was a winner with my family.  I only had thin pieces so layered them in a dish, spread on the filling and topped with another layer of fish.  Also was great with a touch of garlic and italian seasoning.  I'll keep this one handy as my son's catch alot of halibut fishing.

This is the best way I have ever tried Halibut. I did add a topping though.

This recipe was quick, fast, and delicious.  I was unable to find fresh halibut, but used orange ruffy and it was a big hit.  My family loved it served over rice.  I prepared it ahead of time by stuffing the filets (about 15 minutes) and refrigerated them. A stress free meal.

We loved this!  I used tilapia as that's what I had on hand.  The filets are to thin that I simply coated one filet with the filling and topped it with another before baking.  I added some fresh chopped garlic.  This dish would benefit from some color.  Next time I'll sprinkle either some paprika or parsley on top.  Neither will alter the taste of the dish.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy.  This was my first time cooking fish so I was nervous.  I seasoned and stuffed the fish the night before and put it in the fridge, then I baked it the next night.  I added butter to the stuffing.  I put the cream cheese mixture inside and on top of the fish.  Halibut was not available so I used Mahi Mahi.  Everyone that ate it raved about it!  Thanks!!

This recipe was good but I found the cream cheese didn't get very hot in the short cooking time which made it less appealing.  I'll probably try it again but put the cream cheese mixture on the top of fish filet so I can broil it if needed.  My husband also suggested cooking it in tinfoil packet?  
I also added garlic for additional flavoring which was good.

I made this for my family and we all really enjoyed this very much. I also could not find any halibut so I used one large piece (about .65 lbs) of Orange Roughy and cut the cream cheese in half.
It was enough to feed a family of two adults and 2 toddlers which I served with a salad, steamed broccoli and some corn on the cob. Also, I used larger cooked cocktail shrimp and cut them in half. I found it helpful to mix the cream cheese with the basil, salt and pepper FIRST since I had a hard time incorporating the shrimp without damaging it. I just stuffed the cream cheese mixture with the shrimp randomly and it came out great! Thanks for this recipe. We will definitely be making this again!

The filling for this was very tasty but the fish itself was kind of bland.  I want to try it with crabmeat instead of shrimp, and season up the fish a bit.  It is very quick and easy to make.

There is no mistaking that you are pretty much eating warm cream cheese on top of an expensive piece of fish.  Yuck.  The filling seems like it would be more fitting as a cracker or bagel topping. All of my family ended up scraping the filling off and just eating the fish.  Will definitely not be making this one again.  Sorry.

This is a good recipe, I used salmon instead of halibut and it was just as good. It's surprisingly easy to make as well.

This recipe was great!  Even my husband, who is not a big fan of fish liked it!  I used goat cheese and dill instead of cream cheese & basil.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so easy to do and looked pretty next to my sauteed spinach!  I didn't have any basil or lemons on hand, so I mixed Italian seasonings in the stuffing, placed any remaining stuffing on top of the fish, and sprinkled it with lemon pepper before baking it.  I softened the cream cheese in the microwave for a minute before mixing in the other ingredients and and no problems with the shrimp breaking.  Next time I may add a little chopped spinach inside the stuffing.  Thanks! :)

This was so simple and great tasting.  I used it on top of cod..great!  It would also taste terrific as a spread on crackers, minus the fish of course.

Was Great. We tried one dish with the shrimp, and another with crab. Both were good. A little bit creamy for me and my children's taste, mainly because we are enjoy the falvor of out meat/fish.  But my husband enjoyed every bite, as he is more  about sauce flavor.

This recipe goes really well with any white fish as it complements the taste without  overpowering. Will have to try with fresh Salmon when the season comes around.

This was an amazing dish! I substituted crab for shrimp and it turned out fabulously!!!! I also sliced thin lemon wheels and layed them on top of the fish while they baked. I'll be making it again

We added bacon on top.  This was the perfect addition to make it a 5 star recipe. Also needed 40 minutes to cook and we increased the temp to 350.  Turned out fabulous.   I will make this again.

I'm rating this based on a slight change I made because of the reviews I've read concerning bland flavor for this.  As I started mixing up the ingredients, it appeared to me that it was missing butter and garlic.  I mixed a cut garlic clove with some butter in a saucepan, heated it with some lemon juice, removed the garlic clove, and spooned that butter sauce over the opened up halibut pieces before putting the filling in.  I finished off the top with the same sauce.  It doesn't take much butter and garlic to add some flavor.  This was very delicious!  We will definitely have this again!  YUM!  Thanks for posting this recipe (way back a long time ago!)!

I used tilapia instead of halibut. For the stuffing I used shrimps and scallops. I also added a bit of breadcrumbs for texture. I was afraid the melted cream cheese would be too sloppy, so the breadcrumbs helped make it thicker. I forgot the lemon. The results were good, but the fish really needs a bit of flavor. I added parsley and paprika, but that doesn`t add much flavor. Fiance liked it and said it was different, because he has never has cream cheese in a dish before. I`d make this again, but need to alter the recipe. Perhaps a more flavorful fish would have helped...
