The recipe was easy enoough, but I found the cool and lumpy cottage cheese inside the hot omelet disconcerting. I think mixing the cottage cheese in with the beaten egg might have imporved things. Thanks!

I'm not a cottage cheese fan, but I used it for a recipe and had some left over. I found this recipe and was skepital, but I loved it. I used canned mushrooms, but I'll use fresh next time. The jalepenos gave it a nice kick. Thanks alot!

This was interesting. I took another reviewers advice and whipped the cottage cheese in with the eggs. I used one full egg and three egg whites and trim cottage cheese. I think I might add in some onion and garlic next time.

WOW! I thought it sounded good, but I was not expecting this to be so delectable. I'm not much of a jalapeno girl, so I used green pepper. Also, all I had were canned mushrooms. This was just fantastic, I'll be making this often!!! Thank you!

This omelet is wonderful!  Didn't expect it to be this good.  I did not have any mushrooms so used black sliced black olives and diced green chiles.  Also some salsa. I put a slice of yellow cheese ontop and let it melt, then used sour cream when fully cooked,  A 10!

This is the perfect healthy omelet!  I modified it to my taste: using only egg whites (8 egg whites), added finely chopped chives to the saute, and minimized the oil to 1 tsp instead of 1 tablespoon, because you really don't need that much oil to saute.  The cottage cheese is what makes it different and satisfying.  I used 1% fat cottage cheese, using 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup.  I served this with a side of freshly chopped tomatoes.  Delish!

Delicious and healthy! I'm always looking for more ways to use cottage cheese and this was a great idea. I did not find the olive oil to be necessary and used just a tad. I used fresh mushrooms and added red onion and green peppers. Loved the simple addition of basil, and I imagine this would have been even better if using fresh basil. I was worried about it not having enough seasoning and made the mistake of adding salt to the veggies. I forgot how salty cottage cheese is on its own. I contemplated adding garlic because I love it, but didn't. Overall, I thought the veggies, jalapeno, basil, and black pepper gave this enough taste. I also used egg beaters which worked just fine. Thanks for the great recipe to start my day!

Not bad. I had to make quite a few changes, though. I omitted the mushrooms and cottage cheese, as I don't care for either. I added peri-peri peppadrop peppers and diced green onion, and used feta cheese. It tasted divine, even though it wasn't aesthetically pleasing (I need to work on my omelet making skills). Thanks, Dakota.
