I had to prepare a salad for a cookout and wanted to find a recipe for something other than the typical pasta or potato.  I saw the star rating and read the reviews for this salad and immediately my pessimistic side thought no salad made with a combo of these odd ingredients could ever be that good. So I made the salad, partly in a effort to counter those who have continued to hail it's excellence.  
My first complaint was the estimated prep time of 20 minutes.  It took me quite a bit longer than that, but I can be easily distracted and perhaps I use a slower cutting/chopping technique. 
But in the end, I was forced to accept defeat, for everyone at the cookout did, in fact, rave about this salad and inquire as to who made it.  Yes, it really is that good.

This is a very nice salad. I almost gave it 5 stars, but didn't since I had to make so many changes to the original...and I think the changes really made it much better. The changes I made are as follows: (1) lightly steam the broccoli, (2) omit the dried cranberries...preference only, (3) omit the green grapes and double the red grapes, (4) slice the red grapes in half, (5) reduce the sugar to 2 Tablespoons, (6) reduce the wine vinegar to 2-3 Tablespoons, (7) reduce the mayo to 1/2 cup, and (8) add 1/2 cup of regular sour cream. Everyone really likes this salad...even my 4 year old gobbled it up! Thanks.

Now here is a beautiful salad that will keep its shape when traveling to an event. It was easy to prepare. I, too, quickly steamed the broccoli and the peas but kept them still basically raw. The steam also helps to bring their color out. I used reg grapes only since that is what I had. I thought the recipe could have used more almonds so I just kept adding till it seemed more consistent throughout. The almonds I found in the store were roasted slivered almonds. They were very tasty and added a nice dimension to the rawness of the rest. I cut way back on the amount of dressing the recipe called for. It would have been drowning in mayo if I hadn't reduced it back by at least half. I think just getting it coated lightly was enough. 

One note: I decided to make the bacon but didn't put it on the salad but instead in a bowl on the side. That way vegetarians could still eat it - where if anyone wanted the meat they could sprinkle it on. It went over well at the party. I will make it again.

I have tried a few other broccoli-like salads here and this is the best one by far!  I didn't use the grated onion in the dressing and I also didn't use all of the dressing on the veggies.  It was way rich and about half of the dressing was quite enough.  I used 2 cups of red grapes instead of red and green and I ran out of sugar so I used splenda instead and I couldn't even tell the difference.  Make this recipe and everyone will be sure to love it!  YUM!

I halved this recipe and brought it to a friend's house for dinner for four. It all got eaten up! Everyone, including myself, loved it. I used light mayo to reduce the fat. I also mixed up the dressing and the salad ingredients ( in seperate bowls) the night before and that worked out fine. Thanks!

Very good recipe!  I used sunflower seeds in place of almonds and all red grapes instead of red and green, let chill for a couple hours.  Tasted great!

I tried this recipe which was emailed to me.  It was fantastic!  I've shared it with several friends.  I used light mayo and it was just fine.  I also did a "quick steam" with the broccoli and peas.  It was delicious.  I will definately take this to any gatherings!

YUM!!!  Suggested a friend make this for a picnic.  The entire batch was gobbled up!  Instead of using the both types of onions, she only used the green onions.  I am going to try a lighter version using lowfat or fatfree mayo, Splenda instead of Sugar, and turkey bacon.  I will post with the results.

This is a very different, delicious salad, with a surprising, but fabulous variety of ingredients.  I brought this to an all-church picnic, and the bowl was practically licked clean.  A bit time consuming, but well worth the effort.  I will make this again and again.

This recipe is great! You cannot go wrong with making it! It is simple and tastes delicious. Some reviewers suggested to steam the veggies first but I feel that defeats the purpose of it being "raw." The point of eating raw veggies compared to cooked is that there is greater nutritional value  when eating raw. It tastes wonderful without steaming the broccoli and peas so why bother adding that extra step? This is my favorite salad to make and it is really easy! Everyone always seems to love it. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't love this recipe.  Brought it to a neighborhood party and it wasn't that popular.  For all the work and expense of ingredients, I'd do a more simple version next time.  Ended up throwing some out.  I do usually like the more traditional version of this salad so was suprised I didn't love it.

Really good. Really Easy. I increased the recipe to serve a crowd of 50 and still turned out great.  Watch the salt though.  Depending on the brand/style of the bacon you use, this dish can get a little too salty.  I reccomend adding the cooked and crumbled bacon to the "wet" part of the recipe, tasting the mayo mixture and then add the salt to your taste to this part of the dish before combining with other ingredients.

this is a good broccoli salad.  i used only 2/3 cup mayo, and that was definitely sufficient.  unsalted sunflower seeds can be substituted for the almonds.  I put the peas in when frozen to keep it cool, and after letting it rest for 20 or so minutes it's ready to serve.  In the past I've had a similar salad, in my opinion LIGHTLY steaming the broccoli florets and shredding the big stem (but not steaming the stem) is what i prefer.

Have made this 3x in the past 2 months.  I didn't do bacon, grated onion and didn't use all the dressing (it is pretty heavy and sweet).  This dish is easy to make and a crowd pleaser!

Great salad! A departure from the usual. I have made it as this recipe calls for, and a couple of times, substituted what I had on hand for some of the ingredients. Delicious every time.

Really really good salad.. I did a couple things diff from the recipe.. I did steam the broccoli as suggested by another user, and if you are in a hurry, don't bother to thaw the peas.  The heat of the steamed broccoli thaws the peas and makes the whole salad cold and super tasty.  Also I substituted honey for sugar, which worked quite well and halved the mayo and subbed it with sour cream.  I also increased the amount of grapes, just because I like grapes, and the red ones make it look pretty.  Will add this recipe to the "keep" list for sure!

This was a big hit at an end of summer BBQ. I used maple bacon and dried cherries since I had them on hand. I did steam my broccoli for about 5 minutes and the color was bright green. Cut back on the mayo (light) and sugar slightly. And I did toast the slivered       almond since it's so quick and easy with a great toasted nutty flavor. Delicious....!!!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I found this recipe this spring and have made it over and over.  I brought it to a baby shower and everyone wanted a copy.  I added blueberries to it once because they were in the fridge and I did not want them to spoil.  That was very good.  I use fresh broccoli.  Instead of sugar I use Spenda and I use light mayonaise.  This is one of my favorite salads now.

Made this for a cookout.  My girlfriend, hubby and myself ended up eating the whole thing.  A lot of people wouldn't even try it because of the ingredients.  They just don't know what they were missing out on!  Very good, and a nice combination of flavors!

I LOVE this salad! I made it without bacon, as I'm trying to cut back on meat, and I also cut out green grapes (didn't have em) and the green onion (didn't have em either). I put it in tupperware and ate it everday as a snack or lunch or whenever. It is SOOO good. I love the broccoli with the sweet cranberries and grapes. Very satisfying. Its like a Waldorf Salad without the meat. Delicioso!

This recipe is awesome!! I made it for a picnic/party and it was well received! It is definitely a keeper. I like the additions that others have mentioned. I wouldn't leave out the cranberries or the onion juice in the dressing. They help add layers of flavor to the salad. I added both sunflower seeds and almonds as I really like the crunch in salads. I bet raisins and chinese noodles might be good,too. I also used about half of the mayo, sour cream and vinegar. Very versatile! This is good for those going raw! It can be as healthy as you want and others will like it too!!

Yum!  My DH is on a mostly raw diet and this was a perfect salad for both of us to share - and to take to potlucks to be sure he has something to eat.  Great flavors, textures and colors!

Yummy salad well liked by all.  Kept all ingredients the same (how else can you really rate a recipe?) I did put the bacon in with the dressing (per suggestion) which worked great from keeping it from all dropping to the bottom of the bowl.  Used only 1/2 of the dressing, but will enjoy the rest on a salad later. Thanks!

I really didn't find this recipe to be anything special.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything that anyone in my family thought was great either.  I did halve the dressing after reading reviews that some only used about half the dressing and I'm glad I did.  I omitted onions & celery, both of which I do not like.  I was looking for a "different" salad and found it, but wasn't wowed.

I made this using the 48 servings scale, and it worked great.  I cut up everything at home the night before, and tossed into green bags, and tupperware, and it was easy to throw into the cooler. The day of the tailgate, I mixed it all together, using a plastic glove to stir, and it was a huge hit! Although, I didn't end up using all the dressing. I had many people ask for the recipe, and have been asked to make it for the next tailgate.

I thought this sounded slightly strange, but had to try with how well it's been reviewed. Seriously, this salad is amazing! I switched fake bacon, all red grapes and pine nuts instead of almonds. I'm going to have to make this again soon.

This was an excellent salad!  Crunchy, sweet, LOTS of great flavors.  My husband is not one to rave about food, but he raved!  It was a little more saucey that I prefer, and I would cut back on the sugar, probably by half or so.  Otherwise, it's great!

This was good. I made it for a church potluck and it was well received. I put all the ingredients I'd cut into baggies, the dressing was put into a sealable plastic container, and I just dumped everything in together, stirred well, and chilled. I think next time I'll steam the broccoli like another reviewer suggested; the raw was good and crunchy but I like to try new things, too. Thanks for the post!

I fixed this salad for a beekeeper picnic.  I also had my doubts about it because of the unusual combination of ingredients, but it got rave reviews and there were no leftovers..  I steamed the broccoli and peas until their color changed.  I doubt it I will steam the peas again because it doesn't seem necessary.  I used about half of the dressing.  I believe the dressing recipe would be good on other salads.  I will definitely fix this again.

I like this salad a lot and have made it on several occasions when I am craving a broccoli salad. I usually use a little stevia (sugar sub) in place of the sugar because we are watching our sugar. I also add sunflower seeds when I don't have nuts.
