I should preface this by saying that I've never had the restaurant version the submitter talks about.  I wanted to like this more than I did, but most of my feelings about it have to do with wanting more lemon flavor (perhaps it isn't supposed to).  Also, it was hard to cut to look good.  It could be that the day I made this we had high humidity and even a few raindrops---unusual for a warm July day in SoCal.  One mistake I made was to use parchment on the bottom of my springform pan---totally unnecessary and burdensome.  I would maybe use half milk and half lemon juice in the cake itself, or at least use lemon flavoring in the cake topping.  Another thought would be to spritz the top of the bottom layer of cake with a simple syrup made with lemon juice and sugar.  I would use a little more lemon zest in the cream layer.  I will try this again on another day!  Thanks, CindyAnn!

I love this, it's like my Italian gramma used to make, but easier because of the cake mix, I used 3tlbs lemon juice and one tlb lemon zest as her cake called for in the cake and it was perfect, I followed the filling as it was. Thanks for making this wonderful family favorite so easy.

While I still prefer the restaurant version, this was delicious.  I've made it twice.  The first time I used a lemon cake mix because I didn't have white.  I also baked it in a 9 x 13 pan because I was feeding a group of people and needed to be able to serve 18+ pieces.  I was a little worried I wouldn't be able to slice the 9 x 13 cake in half and reassemble the top layer without it breaking, but surprisingly I had no problem at all.  The group I made it for really enjoyed the cake and I received requests for the recipe.

The second time I followed the directions exactly, including using the springform pan.  Both times, delicious.  I'd like to try using 8 oz. of cream cheese next time as I think I want a little more cream cheese flavor in the whipped cream filling.

I knew I'd want a more robust lemon flavor after reading the ingredients. I used a yellow cake mix and added a box of lemon pudding to the cake batter. My mother used to add instant pudding to her cakes because it makes them lighter. I also added the juice of one small lemon to the cake. I had about 6 ounces of cream cheese left from a box, so I used it all. So, I added slightly more of he other ingredients for the filling as well (cream and sugar), but the biggest change I made was adding the juice of two small lemons to the filling rather than the small amount it called for.  The cake baked up beautifully, although I have to say that taking part of the mix out to make the topping made it thinner. I think in the future I might use two mixes and 1.5 times the filling. All of the components taste good separately and the lemon is not overpowering in either the cake or the filling. We're excited to try the cake tomorrow.

I made this for an Italian family's Christmas dinner and they loved it! Even Nana gave me a compliment. I don't have a spring pan so I used two 8" cake pans. I also wrapped  waxpaper around it  before chilling to help it hold its shape until it is thoroughly chilled. I will definitely be making this again.

This was great!  Easy to make, light, tasty, and flavorful. I made the recipe as directed.  I can't wait to make it for a family event.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I have now made it twice in the last few weeks.  It's the perfect spring/summer cake.  I have done what others have suggested and added a few tablespoons of lemon juice and a teaspoon or so of lemon zest to the cake.  So many compliments and it looks lovely!

I loved this recipe, though I did make one change. I added the juice and zest of a whole lemon to the cake batter. It turned out like a giant lemon bar. It was amazing.

I made this cake recipe exactly as it is written. It was much easier than I anticipated. I actually made it late one evening when I arrived home after working a 12 hour shift. It was the centerpiece dessert for an Italian night with a group of friends and it was a big hit! 
The cake looks impressive and people assume you put a lot of time and effort into whipping it up. The truth is with the use of a boxed cake mix as the base it was no more effort than baking a cake and making icing. 
As far as adding additional lemon zest and juice. I guess if what you're looking for is a LEMON cake, then by all means go ahead. We all thought the cake tasted perfect just the way it is. There is just a nice lemon flavor to the cream. Everyone thought it was the perfect "light" ending to a pasta laden meal.
One thing I do need to add is that I've never had the restaurant version of this cake nor did I ever have an Italian Nonni serve it up for me. That being said, I'm certain we will be having this exact version of Italian Lemon Cream cake at this house again....and again!

This is a delicious cake that has gotten rave reviews from everyone who's had it. I wanted a "light" dessert to serve with a heavy meal and this cake hit the spot.
I recommend letting the cake cool in the pan as long as possible. The last time I made it I let it set overnight and slicing it in half was so much easier.  I didn't dust it with powdered sugar; the crumbs were a lovely topping.

I mostly followed the recipe but did some tweaking of my own.  Used two, 9" round baking pans to make it easier than cutting the cake in half using springform pan,  followed white cake instructions on the box instead of the recipe.  Used all the cake
mix (not reserving any for crumb topping) used lemon zest and real lemon juice (from one whole lemon) in the white cake mix, didn't make the crumb topping (I actually forgot - but next time I will use one cup confectioners sugar with butter and vanilla  to make crumb topping), used 8oz of cream cheese, doubled the confectioners sugar and used 2 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream and zest and lemon juice from another whole lemon for the cream filling.  My daughter added pastel colored nonpareils to the side for an Easter holiday look and we dusted powdered sugar on top.

Holy moly this was a delicious cake! I read the reviews before making it and thought I’d want more lemon flavor so I made a lemon cake instead of the white cake. I used the zest and juice of a whole lemon and it was perfect. I will make this dessert again and again!

Definitely good enough to try again however, my 10 in springform pan made the cake very thin- too thin to cut in half so I ended up leaving it in the pan and spreading the filling on the top.  This took away from the crumbled topping and I couldn't sprinkle with a little extra sugar.  It was so thin that most of the topping ended up cooking through to the bottom of the cake.  I did add 3 TB lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon zest to the cake mix as others suggested and will do this again.  Next time I will make this in 2 separate round cake pans that are smaller so I can get the layered effect and the topping.  I will update- maybe that will earn the 5th star!

01.28.17 ~ I'm not sure what restaurant the submitter is referring to in the bio about this cake, but we liked it. I only had a lemon cake mix at home, so I went with that, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I am huge fan of cold cakes (more so than my DH) so I enjoyed it right from the fridge. My DH let his come to room temp before enjoying his. A nice cake with a pleasant taste and a very nice presentation.

I've never had the restaurant version, but this recipe was delicious. 

I used a full box of cake mix, and bought a second box to make the crumbs. (It did not seem enough, otherwise, when you have to reserve a cup of the cake mix for the crumbs.) Also, I doubled the crumbs. I did not add lemon to the cake mix, as other reviewers suggested. I liked the subtle lemon flavor in the cream, using fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, and about a 1/2 tsp of lemon extract.  

Unfortunately I used an 9" spring pan (didn't have 10") which made it difficult to remove the cake in one piece, since it baked over the rim. Nothing that a little cream couldn't help "glue" back together. Next time, I will instead use two round cake pans. 

I will definitely make this again.

We have this cake as a standard in our house now for special occasions. Totally awesome! This cake does not last very long in our house. Thanks so much for a great recipe. I always make a recipeas is a few times and then modify to suit our family needs and wants. After making it as per the recipe four times, I did make a few changes as we are lemon lovers. Decrease the cup of milk by 1tbsp and replace with fresh lemon juice. I replaced the vanilla with almond extract to enhance the lemon. Also add the zest of one lemon to the cake batter. The crumb mix decrease the butter by 1/2 tbsp. as we like it a little more crumbly. The icing sugar I decrease a bit. I use 1/3 cup in the cream cheese mix and when I combine the whip cream and the cream cheese, I add icing sugar to taste...we prefer a not too sweet filling and icing.

I was in a super rush when I made this the first time. I added all the sugar to the cream cheese and whipped it all together, totally forgetting the cream part. I had wondered why it didn't yield that much filling, so I duplicated my error 3 times to make a 4x batch. My guests loved it. 

When I had time to make another cake I did so at a slower pace and realized my error. When my family and I tasted the correctly made cake we all unanimously stated the 1st one was a lot better.

While the cake following the recipe tasted great, my cake made incorrectly blew this one away. 

Do yourself a favor, after making one correctly with this recipe, make another one quadrupling the filling portion WITHOUT the heavy cream.

This was very good, its easy to prepare. I had fresh squeezed lemon juice but no zest and it was still yummy. I didn't use a spring form pan just a 9 inch cake pan and it was perfect. Cindy Evans

this was probably the most complicated cake I've done. that said it was easier than I thought it would be.  I want to note if you don't have a spring form pan you can assemble this on plastic wrap and wrap it up tight for shape.  Cream cheese really has to be soft and I recommend adding some zest to the cake batter.  mt oven needed more cooking time as well.  Other than that it was exactly as advertised.

This was good and simple.  I needed more robust lemon flavor, though, so I added lemon zest to the white cake, and more lemon juice, lemon zest and natural lemon extract to the frosting.  It was tasty, and it did hold up well.  It kept in my fridge for several days after it was cut, and as long as the plastic wrap was kept tight, it stayed moist with a delicate crumb

Perfect dessert after a dinner of lasagna, roasted vegetables and tossed salad.  I used 8 oz. of cream cheese.  The lemon flavor is subtle and delicious.  Nice textures with cake, crumb and cream.  Always a winner when guests ask for the recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe! Made it for Easter and it was a hit! I followed the recipe exactly as written. To me the lemon was subtle, so if you want more of a lemon flavor you could do what some people suggested and add lemon to cake mix.

This is fantastic!  I made it for a family get-together and multiple generations all agreed it as a definite "keeper". I started this recipe and then realized my lemon wasn't good, so I just substituted real lemon juice, some dried lemon peel, and a drop of lemon extract in place of the fresh lemon juice and peel.  It still turned out wonderful.  Also, I had used 2 Tbsp of the heavy cream for another recipe already, but the remainder was enough to make a thick, rich cream.  I was also able to hurry it along a bit by cooling the cake about 20 minutes on the counter, removing it from the pan, covering it loosely and then putting the cake in the freezer for about 30 minutes. At that point, I was able to slice it just fine and it was not longer warm, so I could add the cream filling and refrigerate while we ate our meal. It may have been better if I as able to let it sit and the flavors blend longer, but in a hurry this worked for me.  I will definitely make it again when I'm not having to rush to put together a big meal for a lot of people.  My MIL loves lemon and I wanted something a little different that wasn't a ton of trouble.  This fit perfectly!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!  I think I will try it with some other flavored fillings too, though I prefer not to use cake mixes too much, except when I need things kept simple.

This cake is absolutely wonderful!  I found it very refreshing and sophisticated. The cake is fluffy, and the cream is just heavenly.  Everyone who tried it at the party was impressed, and I have plans to make it for my next family get-together. :) And probably many more after!

I’m sorry but I seriously can’t take any cake recipe seriously when it lists boxed cake mix as an ingredient. This was a flat and incredibly sad version of the restaurant cake mentioned. That cake happens to be my very favorite by the way. 
I tried this just hoping that it would be a cost effective way to enjoy my favorite treat. I should have known better. I think the restaurants cake has lemon in more than just the center, it is so flavorful and creamy.

I would absolutely make this again. Brought to a potluck and it was a hit. Has to literally steal 2 piece to bring back to my guys that were counting on a piece. Apparently smelling it cooking and then being taken away was torture. I couldn’t find my springform pan, I used two 9” rounds. It worked out perfectly, cooked up in 15 minutes, the one with the crumb topping took a few more minutes.

Followed the recipe as indicated with the only change being added more lemon zest a bit more lemon juice. A big hit and surprisingly nice in the not too sweet department. Will for sure make this again. Thanks for posting.

Excellent.  I did take some liberties based on other suggestions and experience w the alterations.  I used 2 cake mixes separately.  Took the 1 c of mix out for topping as directed in recipe.  For the other cake mix I added an additional egg and liquids and a package of instant lemon pudding.  For the other cake mix I added 1/2 a package of instant lemon pudding and I used the other 1/2 in the cream cheese and whipping cream mixture. The frosting for the layers ( I have 3 when done ) holds up better w the instant pudding and adds more lemon flavor.  I used a spring pan for the whole cake mix then cut it in half.  The other partial mix made the other layer.  I adorned it with raspberries and dusted w powdered sugar.  Everyone RAVED about it.  Thanks for posting.

Yum! Made for Dad's birthday & the whole family loved it. Made a few changes  - added few tbsp lemon juice & a cup of plain yogurt to cake mix. I didn't bother with the crumb topping. Had added another cup of heavy cream & another tbsp of lemon to the filling - so I had plenty to put on top instead of crumb. The filling is so light & lemon fresh!! So easy, will make this again.

I made this for a dinner group and it was enjoyed by all. I used a lemon cake mix, next time I'll try a white mix. I used a bit more cream cheese than called for. The filling had a nice tang to it. I found cutting the cake and moving the pieces very tricky. It didn't look like those pictured, very tasty however.

This cake was simply amazing. I followed directions w/o making any changes with the exception of using a 9 1/2 springform pan as I didn't have a 10". Still came out perfectly. I will definitely be making this again.

I've never made a cake before, not even a sheet cake. I bought a springform pan for this, thinking yay I'll make cheesecake sometime. It turned out wonderful, very light and summery taste. I did flour the pan, and put a bit of lemon juice and zest in the cake, but otherwise I followed the recipe. Sure is scary cutting a cake in half though hahaha.

I added a more fresh lemon juice to the filling, otherwise I followed the recipe. Although it turned out in my favor, the amount of filling was too generous.  Since I had also baked lemon cupcakes that needed frosting I had more than enough to fill the cake and frost 12 cupcakes.  The cake was a party-pleaser. Quite "light" and very tasty. I would make it again.

Going by previous reviews I decided to double the lemon zest so it would be a stronger lemon taste.  That was a good idea.  The taste was perfect.  Instead of putting all the filling in between the layers I put a little over half in the middle and the remainder on the sides.  That made it look better with the crumbles and powdered sugar sprinkles on top.  It was good and will make again.

The only change, I used a yellow cake mix as that's what I had in the pantry.
I took this to a reunion appetizer/dessert party with all women and they loved it.

This was delish! I followed the advice of another review and didn't make the crumble on the top.

Delicious!  I sold this at a cake auction.  It was bought and shared immediately.  I got so many compliments.

I made this cake this morning. I usually like to follow the recipe the first time making something. But this was for our son's girlfriend's birthday. She loves lemon and she loves this cake. It was a little difficult to cut the cake in two horizontally. Next time I'm going to use two 8" cake  pans instead.

My family loved this cake!!! Although, I added my own little twist to this cake by using lemon cake mix, instead of white cake mix. It was delicious!! Especially if you love lemon flavored cakes!!

Loved this cake. Was a big hit at a dinner party. Make sure you beat whipped cream to a very stiff  consistency. I added 1oz more cream cheese but followed the recipe exactly. YUM

Easy, delicious and a hit with everyone! I made another Italian lemon cream cake from this website and it was far more complicated as the crumb mixture was on the entire cake- having it just on the top was great! I did add lemon zest to the actual cake as some reviews said that the cake itself was a little boring. I may try using a lemon cake mix next time and see how that turns out because we LOVE lemon! Great recipe and I will definitely do it again!

Very easy and fast to make. I served it at a dinner party last night and my guests loved it.  The cake goes well with the silky texture of the cream.  I used an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and more lemon zest, and it gave the cream a great flavor.

Really enjoyed this cake and so did our dinner guests. I did half the cream and it was great. Very light and fluffy.

Very light and refreshing. I added some raspberry jam under the cream but I think strawberries would be better.  If you want more lemon zing, add some juice to the cake batter or just make lemon cake. The filling is just Devine

Cake is fantastic!   Used lemon juice, lemon extract and lemon zest in cake batter. (we like lemon!!)   Next time, I am going to spread raspberry jam on bottom layer before spreading the cream filling on cake bottom!   Yum!

I made this for Easter and my family loved it. I added 3 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of zest to the cake batter. So good and perfect for spring.
