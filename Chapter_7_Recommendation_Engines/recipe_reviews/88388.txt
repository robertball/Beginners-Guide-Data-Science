Wow - this takes classic PB&J to a whole new level! I'll eat anything with peanut butter - heck spead it on an old rubber boot and I just might try it I love the stuff that much! I used Red delicious apples and added some dried cranberries along with the raisins. I toasted the whole grain bread and YUM this is a really sweet, nutty, crunchy treat!

As far as PB&J goes, this is top notch!  I also like it with banana instead of apple, and chopped the peanuts instead of adding them whole/halved.  I always use organic natural peanut butter as I DO NOT recommend using other peanut butters, EVER.  Great to take to work for lunch-it kills my afternoon slump and want for a snack.

Great sandwich. Unusual twist on PB&J and so good too. I didn't have apple, but the rest was fantastic without it. Very filling as well. Thanks for the wonderful sandwich.

This was breakfast for me this morning. Very good! I used natural chunky peanut butter, organic raisins, Granny Smith apple and homemade freezer jam. Filling and very tasty.

This was ridiculously fantastic!! It was simple,quick , and very delish! The crunchiness and creaminess were balanced and tasted fabulous!! You can also do it with other combos like different jams,fruit,nuts or raisins. Yours by far is the best! Five stars!!! :)
