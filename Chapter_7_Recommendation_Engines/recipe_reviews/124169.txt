After the 2nd try, this was a hit! The first time, I made it exactly as the recipe states. The apples were a little "too done" while the toast part was more like bread pudding (which wasn't necessarily a bad thing). So, the next time I made it, I flipped it - laying the apples down first in the pan and topping w/the bread and pouring the egg mixture on top of it all. I sprinkled the sugar/spice mixtures on top as well. Came out lovely... the toast was a little more "Frenchy", the apples were soft and tender. Served w/maple syrup. Delicious!

Great recipe! Pet peeve is people who review recipes when they have used things like canned pie filling in a recipe calling for fresh apples, changed the way the bread is cut and then pronounced the recipe "no good". Stick to the recipe if you want to submit a review!

Very good! I didn't do the two layers. Instead I placed the apples on top of the bread, combined all the other ingredients in a bowl, then poured this mixture over the bread and apples. Saved time and it was yummy!

I loved this recipe.  I used apple cinnamon bread from Trader Joe's and cut it into cubes.  Coated my apple chunks with cinnamon and nutmeg, tossed it all together with the bread.  So easy to make!

Made this for Christmas morning brunch and had a fight over who got the leftovers.  It was that good!  My father said it reminded him of the bread pudding his mother made when he was a child.  I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  Great Recipe!

Every month my church has a potluck.  Tonight, we had breakfast for dinner and I made this wonderful recipe.  I replaced the French bread with homemade Hawaiian sweet bread and put walnuts on top of the apples.  I actually made two batches and none was left.  The recipe speaks for itself.  Next time, I'm going to use a non stick spray though as it stuck to the pan.

I wanted to make a special breakfast for my daughter the morning she took her SAT's. Baked French toast with fruit seemed like a good choice. Only problem was that I didn't want to have to get up at 5 a.m. on a Saturday morning to bake it. Soooo... instead of refrigerating the pan overnight, I put it into a larger pan with ice and set it in the oven, which was programmed to turn on in the morning. By morning, the ice had melted and the French toast baked in a pan of water, like a custard. Other than needing a little longer baking time, it turned out great (and I got to sleep in!)

Made this for my family over the holidays. Corner store did not have French bread so I made do with doughy Pepperidge Farm Italian and it still turned out great; everyone loved it. Thanks for submitting this; it is now a permanent part of my recipe box.

This is simple and tasty, and not too sweet.  I cubed the bread instead of slicing for ease of serving.  An hour at 350 degrees seemed to dry things out  a bit--I may try cubing the apples and mixing in with the bread so they don't dry out on top, and a lower temp and/or shorter baking time next time.

Good.  Made it according to the recipe.  I'm going to make it again and next time I'll make these changes:  

1.)  cut the french bread into 1" chunks;
2.)  toss the apples with the spices;
3.)  mix it all together;
4.)  pour milk and egg mixture over all.

The flavors were great, but the apples on top were a little tough and most of the spices were on top of the apples.  When mixing it all together, I'll also increase the spices just slightly.  I love that this recipe makes use of leftover french bread!  Thanks for a good recipe, John.

I cut the recipe in half and used store made brat buns for the bread. I split them and put in the "boat" shown, with the apples on top. I felt if I had the apples on the bottom, the bread wouldn't get wet enough. It tasted more like bread pudding than French Bread. I had it on the "convection setting" for 40 minutes.

Great, easy recipe which is totally yummy! I chopped the bread and apples and just threw them in altogether, poured the liquid mixture over and then sprinkled the remaining cinnamon mixture on top (after stirring the first half in with the apples). Came out great and it was gone before I could blink.

Used pie filling (great), cubed bread instead of slicing and it came out soggy. Covered for first half and removed for second half. Top got crust but center was still soggy after cooking 15 mins longer. Family not too happy. Don"t think I'll try it again. Looking for another one !!!!!!!!!!!!!

Thank you for this awesome recipe!  I made it with the same ingredients, but rather than layering the sugar mixture, I did this:

Ripped up bread, let it dry overnight.
Mix cored/sliced/chopped apples in the cinnamon/sugar/nutmeg mixture and toss on top of bread.
Mix eggs, milk, vanilla, milk together and dump over top of apples/bread.
Bake!

It was really, really yummy.  As I tend to watch my caloric intake, I don't get to eat stuff like this a lot.  This was a perfect breakfast to eat right before heading out for a 50 mile bike ride.  Nutrition to get me through the ride, and was able to burn it off before the ride was over, so it was guilt-free!

Like someone else mentioned, I did not have time to let this cook in the morning, so I set my stove to start at 5am, and left the casserole dish in the oven before heading to bed. Came out perfect!

Made this several times and it is great! Important to use day old bread as it soaks up the batter better and to try to bring it to room temperature before putting in oven. Then baking time is accurate. I sometimes place apples on bottom with some brown sugar and butter, then turn over.  Good recipe just as is.

This recipe was very good - I would definately make again.  I added chopped pecans on top too. It also took less time to bake, so keep an eye on it.  The only thing I wasn't sure of was to grease the pan or not...

Made this last year for Christmas morning! It was a huge hit. I did a couple changes and put the apples in the bottom of the pan. I also used the raisin cinnamon bread I had and it turned out so good. Thanks allrecipes for some good memories. I'm going to use it again this Christmas.

I host a holiday brunch each holiday season and this is always a favorite.  Easy prep the night before with a quick toss in the oven in the morning.  I have altered the recipe by using cherry pie filling and that was equally delicious.

This recipe is nothing fancey, but tasted good with some malple syrup drizzled over the top and a cup of french roast on the side. :) A nice simple Sunday morning breakfast that is easy to throw together the night before.

I made this for a teen sleepover breakfast.  It was pretty terrific, and I could not stop eating it myself.  I made a few adjustments.  I used a Cranberry walnut bread that I found on sale at our local supermarket that was a hearty type bread. This recipe seems to need a hearty type bread to hold up and not get too soggy from the overnight soak.  Also.  I added (Granny Smith) Apples on the bottom of the pan, layered the bread, then added another layer of apples.  I also substituted  1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2  for one cup of the milk.  This did not need any syrup or embellishment, it was great on it's own.

excellent! Instead of french bread I used Subway bread since I work there and can take home the day old bread. And then I put the apples in the middle and only used 1/2 the amount of sugar. But I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on the apples and then on the top bread too. I realized doing it this way It needs to be covered when baked. I baked for 45 min un covered and the top kinda burnt.

I made this for my family's annual christmas brunch in place of my mom's traditional coffee cake and it has now taken the cake's place.  I actually did as another reviewer suggested and flipped the apples and bread.  The bread was awsome and the apples were perfect.  Myself and a few of my family members noticed that this was good hot but even better after it had sat fot an hour or so.  All of the flavors melded and intensified.  I thought it was okay at first but AMAZING on round two.

This reminds me of apple brown betty and other bread pudding-like desserts.  So I halved it, baked for 40-45 in an 8x8 glass pan, and served it with hard sauce. It was good and served 4 people well. I also used 5 slices of Arnold Whole Wheat bread since I didn't have french bread and it worked out fine.

Delicious!  I changed this up a bit, but the original recipe was my inspiration.  

- Used quite a bit more apple and cinnamon than the recipe called for.  

- Used sprouted bread instead of French bread.  

- Added ground ginger and julienned fresh ginger root

- Used 1/8 of a cup or less of honey instead of white sugar

- Prepared recipe right before cooking it, not night before since I didn't plan ahead.  

- Might use a dash of salt next time to bring out flavors. 

- Will spray pan with cooking spray ahead of time!

- Will snuggle the apples in between bread slices and underneath them next time so they don't burn on the edges.

Great base recipe!

This smelled wonderful when baking.  It would be a great Christmas or Thanksgiving breakfast.  Very easy to prepare.  It tastes almost like bread pudding.

We really like these.  My husband wanted to help me the third time I made this.  Don't let your husband slice the apples.  We went to the ER.

Yummy! Think bread pudding meets apple pie! I followed the recipe exactly, but think next time I will follow the suggestion on another reviewer and put the apples on the bottom, as on top they came out a bit crunchy.

I replaced 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk, decreased the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon and increased the the butter to 2 tablespoons, it was a hit at the B and B I cook at... Great texture and flavor.

I thought this was pretty good, but my fiancee really enjoyed it.  Apples had just the right amount of crunch and the whole thing had great flavor.  Serves a lot (could feed a family of 8 easily).

Delicious and EASY. I used regular wheat sandwich bread and it kind of disappeared, so I will use heartier bread in the future. I live on a farm with free eggs and apples, so this is a recipe I will use again and again. It is also a nice way to serve up french toast without standing over the stove while everyone else eats!

Had some apples I wanted to use up and this was a good way to do it. Was easy to make. Liked that you could make it the night before and just pop in the oven. My husband was worried it would be too mushy soaking it overnight, but once I served it he thought it was just right.

Simply wonderful.  It was fantastic!   Easy to make. Looked beautiful and the taste was worthy of 5 stars.  Next time, I'll cut the sugar a bit- it was almost 'dessert' like.  I can't wait to make and eat it again.

I made this last night to bring to work for breakfast. It was a HUGE hit.  I was concerned that the middle would end up soggy with all of the milk in this, but it wasn't, it was perfect.  I didn't layer the apples, I mixed all the sliced apples with the cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar, and the put those on top of the bread. It was perfect, and smelled great cooking.  This is a definite make again.

This was the hit of Christmas morning.  My 11 month old granddaughter loved it but had a little trouble with the apples and only 2 little teeth :)  Those of us with teeth gobbled the apples up.  I'm going to try bananas and blueberries for her next time.  I added some really good half n half to the milk mixure.  Made it very rich and tasty.  A keeper in my house for sure!!!!

Very Yummy!  I did modify the original recipe - I only had plain old white bread, so I used that.  Layered bread, apples, cinnamon sugar etc, & half the egg mixture, then repeated those layers.  It was a great treat for the kids, almost like a bread pudding!

I made this to have a special breakfast for my husband when he came home from a business trip.  I have made breakfast casseroles like this for years for staff appreciation breakfasts at my daughter's high school, and this is the first recipe that came out so soggy - like a bread pudding.  Not what I was really looking forward to.  I was really disappointed but my husband was okay with it - but then, he'll eat anything.  Followed the recipe to a "T" except I added some orange zest to give it some more flavor.  I even left it in the oven for 1 hour and 20 minutes, hoping it would firm up more.  Even tho the knife inserted in middle came out "clean" I could see the excessive moistness in the bread.  I was looking for something quite much more firm and not quite so mushy.  I don't normally like to play around with recipes, but the only thing I can think to do differently is to put less milk and maybe more eggs in for the liquid ingredients and pray for the best.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I had a pre-sliced loaf of bakery French bread. The slices were only 1/2 inch thick, so I stacked them with two layers. I cut the slices in half before placing them in the pan. That made a perfect serving size. Next time I would slice the apples thicker. I also thought that maybe this recipe could use a little salt. I am one who normally cuts salt in all recipes. However, I did think the recipe needed some. I would also try a different topping. I am not sure what, but maybe something with oatmeal. In spite of my suggested changes, it really is a great recipe.

Yummy...I make this on the weekend, cut it into servings, and zipper bag them, so during the week everyone can grab one on their way out in the morning. You don't need syrup, but it's good with that or caramel topping.

This turned out pretty good.  Next time I will reduce the nutmeg a little since it was overpowering. I will probably sprinkle the sugar mixture over the bread before putting apples then do all the apples and sprinkle the top again since all the spice was concentrated too much on top for me.  Definitly used more bread slices than it called for in order to cover the whole bottom of the 9x13.

I thought this dish had very nice flavor.  I don't know what I did wrong though.  Other than halving the recipe I followed the directions as written.  The top layer of apple was chewy and dry.  The bread while nicely cooked on the bottom and sides was soggy in the middle.  I am going to keep trying because baked apple french toast still sounds good.

I realize we all have different definitions of soggy, but this was too soggy for my family.  Only one of my 4 kids ate it.  It had a good flavor, but we couldn't get past the texture.

Very good. I made this today for my fathers birthday brunch and everyone loved it. The one thing I will do different next time is reduce the nutmeg a little. I think it was a little overpowering other than that it was great.

This was just delicious! Easy and so very tasty! I melted some butter in maple syrup with cinnamon and it was perfect! YUM!

I don't know exactly what happened.  I know that I read other reviews saying that they ended up with a "soggy" inside, and I left it the right amount of time so it wouldn't happen to me.  I had a burn-edge, soggy in the middle breakfast.
It wasn't that bad, but I'll think it twice before I make this breakfast again.

this was awesome - the only thing i did different was use sliced up day old cake in place of the bread - makes it already sweeter - and i just like that.... thanks for the recipe!
