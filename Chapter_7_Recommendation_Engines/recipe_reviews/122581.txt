I wanted to try baking something with all the grapes I had and this was the only recipe I found that did not require peeling them.  I really used this as a reference recipe, as I also had strawberries I needed to use.  Ended up using about 2 1/2 cups halved green and red grapes and a lb. of sliced strawberries instead of pears, put them in a 2-qt baking dish.  Also substituted vanilla for the almond extract and pecans for the walnuts.  I'm pretty pleased with the results - definitely a different flavor!  The grapes become somewhat tart, almost like cherries.  And I swear it has a subtle wine-like scent to it - in fact, the flavor reminds me of the claret sauce you get served with spumoni.   Not sure if kids would like it though - Nice dessert to try when you're looking for something different.  If you like sweet, you'll need ice cream to go with it or add sugar to the fruit.

An amazing dessert.  It's an elegant and "grown-up" version of apple crisp.

This recipe is magnificent. It was hard to find a decent baking recipe for grapes, and this was a true find! I made mine with peaches to fill in extra spaces, and it tasted wonderful! I added a little extra butter, sugar and vanilla with the grapes. For anyone doubting that baking grapes would not work, don't worry, it turns out like any other fruit bake.

Really wonderful flavor with this crisp.  I did add a little oatmeal to the topping for some crunch.  Diced fresh pears to mix with the grapes and added a little bit of honey to make it a tad sweeter.  Tasted just as good the next day too and we had no need for ice/whipped cream.

Good. To be fair, I used fresh pears and no walnuts. I think next time I'll do the same but with 1 tbs lemon juice and 1/4 tsp cardamon tossed in with the fruit. When using fresh fruit, significantly more time was needed, almost 20 extra min.

My family loves this, and that's a real miracle considering they don't like pears!

I loved it!!  I used fresh pears, though, and I can't imagine using canned.  I don't even like desserts and I've eaten 1/3 of it in 2 days.

Family enjoyed this - somethng different. I would have liked more "CRISPY CRUNCHY but maybe I need to bake longer. Substituted vanilla extract for the almond as I didn't have on hand.  Will make agin and try throwing in some oatmeal as another reviewer had suggested.

Such a delightful surprise! We like a lot of fruit in our "crisps" so I increased the amt. of grapes. And, we like a lot of the topping so I always make more.  I threw in some otmeal just to get the oatmeal-cookie crunch and it was great. We also use pecans instead of walnuts and it is delicious. It has been such a hit that I've made it three times in the last 4 weeks for company. They can't get enough! Thank you for this recipe.

This was a plesant suprise. I was looking for a recipe to use up some grapes I had. I was a bit skeptical about using grapes in a crisp but it turned out great. Followed the recipe as written, but I baked at 350 for 30 minutes instead of 375.  Will make again and I wouldn't change a thing (except I may have to double it next time :)

Never would have thought to use grapes in a crumble, but they worked great with the pears.  Terrific flavour and my whole family loved it.

I made this on Mother's Day. It was a huge hit- very unexpected but a classic at the same time. Thank you for sharing it! I've been tempted to try it with wine infused black grapes too.

This is awesome! And true enough the combination of grapes and pear gives it a red wine taste. I think it tasted better left over night in the fridge and reheated in a microwave. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy and tasty. I didn't think that leaving the peels on the grapes detracted from the taste or texture at all. I accidently bought a can of peaches instead of pears, and it was still good.
