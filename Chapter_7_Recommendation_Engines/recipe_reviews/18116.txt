I used cook and serve Jello pudding and mixed in the peanut butter after the pudding was done cooking but while it was still hot. It was AMAZING! Definitely a keeper. Very simple, quick and TASTY!

What's not to like! It's super easy. My kids loved it! And if you have kids you probably have the ingredients in the pantry.

After I got done making it, I sat down on my couch. When I was pondering I realized that I forgot to bake the crust. other than that the middle turned out good. Mixing peanut butter with the pudding was a great idea!

I used Van instant pudding and it was wonderful.  I also drizzled some hot fudge sauce over the top.

Yummy !!!  Who knew pudding would make it so good.  I added a 3rd box of instant pudding and a little less milk to make sure it was firm going in refrig in a graham cracker crust.  I loved crumbling chocolate, Reese cups and Carmel cups on the top of 2 pies and very light cool whip before topping it.  They will love it at work.

Great, easy recipe.  I made this for a friends get together and they gobbled it up.  I made this using cook&serve Vanilla pudding and added 1/4 cup Ovaltine chocolate powder (didn't have chocolate pudding).  Added the PB and poured the mixture into a plain crust.  I spread 1/2 tub Cool Whip over the cooled pie, then crushed up Graham crackers and spread evenly on top.  Will definitely make again.

It seemed simple enough.  Everything was a great consistency and going great. Followed the directions exactly. The pie had set up beautifully.  Put it in the refrigerator to chill and when I took it out to serve it was the consistency of soup. Tasted okay, but one ugly mess.  I have a brand new refrigerator that seems to be working ok. So I am mystified.
