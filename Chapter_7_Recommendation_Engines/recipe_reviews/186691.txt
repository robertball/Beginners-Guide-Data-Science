Ok, so initially (upon first bite) I was taken aback by the overpowering citrus flavor. As I continued to eat, it got better. I don't recommend this as a piece of meat by itself, but rather, shredded or chopped for tacos or burritos. You talk about a SUPERB taco meat?!?!?!?!!!! OUTSTANDING!!!!!! It made enough that I have a sigificant amount left for freezing to be used for tacos again down the road. Thanks for this recipe!

Thanks Lisa for sumitting this recipe.The meat came out juicy, flavouful and tender,this marinade is very similar to what they use at carnicerias (mex. butcher's shop).The only changes i made was to omitt the soy sauce and I also added chopped green onios to the marinade,very good will use many times.

This was my first time making carne asada for the whole family and I have to say it came out delicious. It came out so good that I have now become in charge of the meat for future gatherings. I call it my secret recipe. Little do they know I got it from All recipes. YUMMY!

This is the best beef marinade that our family has ever had. We live in California so I must say that we are extreemly fortunate to have most of the citrus available all of the time. The taste is fresh,tangy and full of flavor but not overpowering. I usually have two bags going at a time with beef and marinade. We cook one overstuffed bag, so that we have dinner one night and leftovers for tacos and salad the next day. the second bag can sit for a few more days "marinading" until we are ready to BBQ again. I was thinking about freezing a ziplock full of steak and marinade, it should come out. I will update. Also, the frist time I tried this I used London Broil ( on sale), and tonight we used top sirloin because it was on sale. Every cut of meat has worked beautifully. I do tenderize the meat with a "Cabela" meat plunging tenderizer, but a stiff fork would do the trick. My thanks to Lisa for sharing.
Continuation here, the beef that I froze in the marinade, and later grilled,came out perfect- great for a last minute meal.
I have also used chicken and pork with the same exceptional results-my children and friends RAVE about this!!! Thanks again.

I could not find canned chipotle peppers, so I substituted 1 tsp. Tabasco Chipotle Sauce.  I marinaded the steaks for 36 hours, cooked them on a "George Foreman" style electric grill and they were wonderful.

Great flavor. I used chipolte peppers in adobe sauce, I don't know if that made a difference but it was great. Plus I added some crushed red pepper. Best tasting flap meat I ever had. I marinated it 24 hours.

This is so similar to a fajita marinade from the Food Network. It is wonderful for fajitas. Try it, you will love it.  The chipotle is in adobo sauce in a can.

followed everything but left out the cilantro, I hate the stuff! Made on the grill and it was very tender which is a trick sometimes with flank steak. Thanks Lisa.

Wow, this recipe is amazing!  It is quickly becoming a weekend staple in our house.  Very versatile, you can change the size of the flank steak you buy and it still turns out perfectly.  You would be very hard pressed to find another marinade with as much flavor.  Great to make on a Friday night and serve on Sunday.

One of the best carne asada marinades I've found. I sometimes add a 1/4 of tequila for flavor and to help tenderize the meat.

Made 3 times now, first time exactly as written. 
Second time, doubled the fresh garlic(garlic lover) and added a 3 inch Jalapeño finely diced, 2 TBLS of honey -fantastic! Something about the honey balances out the tangy citrus flavor. ...
This last time, I doubled the fresh garlic, added the Jalapeño, honey and swapped out smoked paprika i/o the regular paprika and 1 Tsp of Cayenne ONLY because I forgot to buy the Chipotles and had to improvise - just an FYI in case you find yourself in same situation- since I only had 1n1/2 pounds of beef to marinade, I froze the remaining half. Well, last night I defrosted it and marinaded boneless/skinless chicken breast for a few hours, grilled them and sliced to add to a BBQ Chicken Salad -FANTASTIC! 
I grill my Flank Steak until its almost done, then wrap in foil to let stand for about 15 min while I warm tortillas and get all the condiments put out. It does have a dominate citrus flavor, thus adding the honey might do the trick if you're not a fan of it. I ABSOLUTELY love this recipe and its a keeper!

I think the ingredients in this are spot on, but the ratios might be a little off for me. I halved the citrus juices while leaving the other ingredients the same. I also added some green onion. I was out of chipotle so I just omitted it, but I think it would taste great and will make sure to get it next time. I threw everything in a blender to make a better consistency to penetrate the meat. After tasting it, I added a bit of water to thin it out and mellow out the flavor a bit. I will continue to play with this marinade. Good base recipe! Also, I need to mention that beef flap meat is a better choice than flank steak.

We LOVED this!!  I've tried it twice and did not like it the first time...no fault of the recipe!!!  The first time I added 1/2 a Corona beer & threw it in the crockpot without marinating.  The flavors were VERY muted & the texture of the meat was grainy.  The second time I omitted the orange juice (didn't have it) & skipped the reviewers suggestion for beer.  I ended up marinating for 2 days unintentionaly, GRILLED it this time & was BLOWN AWAY at the depth of flavor!!  The meat was super tender, the flavors were intense, perfect for tacos & able to stand up to all of the toppings.  The olive oil gave richness & the chipoltle gives depth, the citrus was perfect, not overpowering at all.  I prefer no orange juice and will make it just like this many, many more times!!!  Thanks!!!  :o)

Yuumm! From reading other reviews, they had mentioned about being too citrusy. I had to adjust the ingredients to suit my families taste buds, so I had to cut down the orange juice in half and added more soy sauce (1 oz more). I also omitted cilantro because we hate them. We set aside chopped cilantro for those who like them. Seriously, these are the best carne asada ever!!!

We enjoyed this very much, I used round steak that I already had on hand and marinated it 24 hrs. We broiled the steak 5 mins each side and sliced it thin. Served it with some homemade Guac, sour cream and naan bread. Will definitely make this again.

Good marinade. I only gave 4 stars because of the adjustments I made to the carne asada marinade. I substituted the soy sauce for Negra Modelo beer and I substituted the chipotle peppers for jalapeno and Anaheim peppers. Also, for a bit of sweetness use a kiwi in the marinade. It was a natural tenderizer in it. These tasted just like tacos I used to get on the beach in Mexico.

DELICIOUS!!!!!! This was phenomenal. My husband and I conquered all 3lbs in minutes! I didn't change anything about the marinade - but I had my husband grill 2 red bell peppers, 2 green bell peppers, 2 tomatoes and 2 jalapeno peppers as well, pureed them with a little salt, cilantro and juice from 1/2 a lime, and served the meat with the puree on the side, some grilled onions, and a little queso fresco on top - YUMMY!!! :)

My family absolutely loves this recipe!!!!  The longer it marinades the better.  We added less soy sauce and added more chipotle pepper.  We also substituted the flank steak with pork shoulder (about 4lbs) and cooked it for about 4 hrs on 275 degrees.  We made this for a Cinco de Mayo party and everyone couldn't get enough!  It was amazing!!!

This is my FAVORITE allrecipes.com to date! Uh MAZING!!!!!! If my dad who says everything is "so so" and says this is tasty/ very good, I know its a keeper! 

I omitted the chile pepper and the canned chipotle peppers AND its still good, this is a must for your family! I also used the cilantro after it was grilled. But all in all its amazing! I just wanna eat it all day everyday. Cold, hot, leftovers etc. Its soooo good. If you dont try this youre missing out! Highly recommended!  Thanks for the share Lisa!

This is my go-to recipe for carne asada. Always gets rave reviews! I use 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper in place of chipotle pepper, and cut the olive oil to 1/4 c. Thanks so much for sharing!

This marinade is terrific! Great job, Lisa! I used less black pepper due to family tastes, only 1/2 of the soy sauce, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar. I didn't even have to oil my grill and they turned out wonderful!

This marinade was great! I didn't have lime juice though and I used all fresh fruit. I also added 1 cup of chopped onion to the marinade because that how we do it traditionally when making carne asada. The only reason its not getting 5 starts was because I didn't get the right meat for it and it was not how I like it so next time I will try it with flank steak and I will update the recipe!

I had only made carne asada once before and it wasn't all that I'd expected. This recipe, however, made me fall in love with it! Will definitely make it again.

This was sooooo good!  I made it as written except that I didn't have cilantro.  Just awesome!  Next time I make this I will have cilantro because I know it will be awesome with it.  HIGHLY recommend this one!  Thank you Lisa for a great recipe!

I will made this again, BUT I will try to use less ground cumin. One think about this meat is the more you eat it the better it taste. I dont know if you get used to that cumin taste or what. I will definitely make this again!!!!

This was so flavorful. I didn't have the canned chipoltle so I added a couple spoonfuls of my homemade very hot salsa. We loved it, thanks!

I didn't use the orange juice but followed everything else and cooked it with a roast in the crock pot.... had shredded beef tacos.  I will never use ground beef and the instant seasoning package again!

This turned out great, but the one thing I changed was to use THINLY sliced (by the butcher) flank steak.  That is the key to tender carne asada.  No need for a meat mallet.  Even the main stream stores carry flank sliced like this.  I am fortunate that I have many carnicerias where I live so this is never a problem.  I have never had tough meat.  Don't forget the lightly grilled green onions for a traditional dish.

Excellent. Didn't have lime juice so simply omitted it.  The husband raved about the flavor and tenderness of the meat.  Super easy, but doesn't taste like it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love, love, love this recipe.  I use low-sodium soy sauce but stick to Lisa's recipe for everything else.  My husband raves about the carne asada.  I have been buying flap meat and it's perfect for carne asada.  I marinate it as little as 8 hours and as long as 2 days and it's great either way because the meat is so think.  There is a good depth of flavor.  Citrus and cilantro are prominent but so are the spices and chipotle.  That's a good thing when you can really taste what went into it.  

I don't reserve any marinade but have found that it's best to take the meat off the grill, cover it with foil, and let it rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.  It will be moist and delicious.

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out amazing. I have tried it twice - once marinating it only 30 mins, and the other overnight and both ways it turned out outstanding. Will definitely continue to use this one!

This was delicious! I felt like i was eating at an authentic Mexican restaurant. I used a London broil and ended up marinating it a day and a half. Cooked it hot and fast on the grill, let it cool/rest a bit, and then chopped it into bite-sized pieces. Served it on corn tortillas with pico de gallo. This one is a keeper!

I was having people over for lunch and I needed a marinade - after marinading the meat I realized I was suppose to let it sit for 24 hours...I only had four!  It turned out delicious - hard to imagine, but it would probably taste even better if it sat an extra 20 hours!?

This is the best carne asada ever. Add half a bottle of beer for added flavor. I also added a little green onion and a dash of cayenne pepper.

Added chopped onion and some salt, and left out the chipotle pepper. It tasted wonderful by itself and in a burrito. I will definitely be making this again!

I was tempted to omit the soy sauce because it didn't sound very Hispanic, but I decided to make exactly as the recipe was to try it and see if I like it and I must say, my whole family LOVED it.  We are very picky with our Mexican food. Of course, we all had to add more lime and cilantro over our roasted peppers and onions! Thanks for the recipe!

Living in a rural area that doesn't have a single taco shop around for miles and miles (I'm talking hours here!) has been brutal! Until I found this recipe....YAY!  My boyfee says 'best ever' and we used to live in SoCal close to the border, thats pretty impressive!  Only thing I *had* to do different was use a different cut since the local grocer didn't have flank/skirt steak.  I used 'Milenesa'??  Never heard of it till now but it worked great. Thin cut, low on the fat content but still tasty delicious-oh yeah!  A big thumbs up. I'll be fixing this for my baby shower for all to enjoy :D Thanks!

I made this for a taco party at school.  I live in a Hispanic community so everyone knows what good carne asada tastes like.  Everybody loved it....very authentic...tasting and smelling...lol.  I made a few changes...I added the whole can of chipotle peppers in adobe sauce because I didn't know what I would do with the rest of the can,  I also added 5 six green onions.  I put itn in all in the blender until it was smooth....

Exactly made it was good BUT a little too lemon/limey.  Next time may omit the lime.  Also, the chipotle, was so little that I wasted a whole can for a tsp.  So I may omit that as well and if I want a hint of spice, add a fresh chopped pepper of some sort.  Remember, it all comes off when you grill it anyway.

My honey hates chipotle anything so I subbed a whole fresh jalapeno. It was WONDERFUL. A little sweet, for our tastes, so next time I'll use a little less OJ and more lime juice. The meat was tender and juicy and the juice ran down my arm as I ate my taco. THAT is a sign of good tex mex!

Made this today following the marinade directions with the exception that I used a little dried chipotle chiles instead of the teaspoon of canned ones.  Weather wasn't good for grilling outside, so I put the meat and the marinade into my slow cooker on high for 3 hours.  It was amazing.  We decided to serve it "burrito bowl" style like Chipotle Grill, so I put out separate bowls of black beans, rice, home made guacamole & pico de gallo, chopped romaine, shredded mild cheese and low fat sour cream to serve with the beef.  Also had whole grain tortillas available for my daughter.  Everyone loved this recipe.  The meat is very flavorful and tender.  Thanks for the recipe and we will be making this again, next time on the grill.

With only 6 hours to marinade before dinner, I left it out for the first hour of marinading, placed it in the refrigerator for 4 hrs. more, and finally took it out an hour prior to grilling. The meat was perfectly tender and very flavorful with just 6 hours in the marinade! 
My lower-carb meal option was to place this atop of a bowl of mixed greens, diced tomatoes, and a bit of guacamole, and dress it with a couple tablespoons of the reserved marinade. It was delicious and filling! 
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't find the citrus flavors overpowering at all. The only modification I made was increasing the quantity of chopped, canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (I hate to waste an entire can), using 1/4 cup of the peppers and sauce, well chopped. 
Made a great meal - the kids loved it with yellow rice and black beans on the side - and is delicious enough to serve when entertaining.

Use 3-5 tablespoons of canned chipolte peppers. I use the sauce as much as the peppers themselves in the can. It makes at awesome. Everything else is perfect.  Trust me

This kinda fell flat.  I didn't have a whole bunch of cilantro, but had some.  I don't think that would've made much difference.  I don't think the citrus flavor was as strong I as I had hoped either.  This is okay, but I don't think it rates higher than 3.

This is an amazing recipe. I let it marinate overnight, then put it in the slow cooker with all the juices and left it for 8 hours on low. The result was incredible!! It gave it SO much flavor and it was really tender and juicy. My family preferred that to grilling it, so I will be slow cooking this from now on. I made this with homemade Mexican rice and it was the perfect meal!!

At last! I can have carne asada without having to dine out! The only ingredient I didn't have was cilantro. I like spicy so I added a little more chipotle chilies. It was perfect! Thank you! I served with spanish rice and home made re-fried beans.

I loved this marinade recipe. Made it exactly as written, and served it as burritos. My husband and sister loved it. I think I'll serve it on its own next time (maybe with some black beans and rice). It made good burritos, but the flavor of the meat wasn't as pronounced.

Followed the recipe precisely (except for baked it in the oven) and loved it!  I will definitely be making it again soon.  Thank you very much for the recipe.  For the side dish, I made Quinoa and Black Beans which is a recipe that can be found on this site.  It's a very good side dish for this meat (tasty and healthy).

Delicious! I did make a major change though. I forgot the orange juice so I used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice instead. Yummy!

I cubed up a chuck roast and soaked it in this marinade then grilled it on skewers. I could die happy right now. This may be my favorite thing we have ever cooked!

This marinade was a huge hit! This was the first time in 10+ years that I strayed away from our beloved Carneceria Carne Asada. I had my doubts and was nervous since I had the whole family coming over for Cinco de Mayo. I followed the recipe pretty closely and even added some fresh orange slices/ lemon wedges/beer to the marinade and let it sit for 24hrs in the fridge.  Everyone loved it and is asking for “my secret recipe”!

This is amazing it is perfectly spicy, I have gotten carne asada from the store several different places. But this recipe is way better. I added red pepper not paprika  which gave it more heat. I had it marinade 24 hours.  I added a little more garlic and the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce in a can but I can't explain how good it is..... you need to make it.

Good marinade I let it sit for 1hour before broiling it in the oven. I didn't have the chipotle peppers so I omitted them. My lemon was a little dry so I didn't have as much juice as the recipe calls for. The flavor of the meat was great and very tender.

My husband is from Guatemala and his family makes the best carne asada so I was looking for a recipe so I could make it as well. I found this one and I gave it a shot. It is NOTHING like his family makes it but with that being said I think I like it more! The only think I did different was I did not use cumin bc we don't really like it in my house and I also didn't have any chipotle pepper or chili powder so I threw in a couple shakes of crushed red pepper. I also used fresh lemons, limes and oranges for the juice! We had friends over and they loved it as well! Definitely suggest giving it a try!!

My family really enjoyed this. I made the marinade in the morning and marinaded the steak for 6 hours. I didn't use as much lime as the recipe required and next time I may skip it all together. The final meal had hints of underlying citrus flavor. The meat was very tender. I cooked the meat in the oven for about 45 minutes covered in foil. I then finished on a cast iron grill on top of the stove to give it the grill marks.We made tacos with the steak, used the pan drippings as sauce and topped with queso fresco cheese. I skipped the chipotle all together. Very tasty all in all.

Fantastic! I love it when some reviewers (none here) start out by saying that they changed a recipe "only a little", like instead of beef they used tofu, and instead of grilling they boiled it! This recipe was followed to a tee, well, maybe except the quantity of meat since I bought it at Costco and it came in side-of-beef quantity. But I accounted for the extra weight and adjusted the ingredients so as to maintain the integrity of the recipe as written by Lisa. The meat turned out better than the marinated version we had purchased at our local grocery store! So we'll keep doing it ourselves from now on.

I've never made carne asada and this was sooooo so good.  Why'd I wait so long? Will use this recipe again!

I made this yesterday and it was a hit! I did change it up a bit, however.
My pallet does not work well wit too much spicy. I added spicy paprika and chili powder instead.
I also added onions to the marinade. Once I placed the crane asada into the marinade I allowed it to sit at room temperature for 2 hours before BBQing at 1.5 minutes a side and the grill temp at 400 ... It was perfect!

We've used this marinade many times exactly as it is written. It might be a little over powering if you eat the meat plain but we chop it up and use it for tacos so it's perfectly seasoned for our purposes. I put it in grilled tortillas with chopped tomato, red onion, cilantro and top it with queso fresco.

We made this for a group of 15, and it was SO good, everybody loved it! The flavors were perfect. I used top sirloin & ordered it from the butcher, I also did a few breasts of chicken and was very tasty. I did the recipe exactly as it says but had it marinade for about 30 hrs. Highly recommend!

This was the star of the show at our cinco de mayo party.  Everyone thought it was the best Carne Asada they tasted. The only thing I change was I ran short of soy sauce so I finished the measurement with Maggi's Seasoning. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe Lisa

My family loves carne asada and we loved this recipe! I omitted the chipotle peppers and the oregano because I didn't have them.  I added garlic and salt and pepper and will possibly omit the lemon juice next time to lighten the citrus flavor a bit.  But, I am so pleased with this recipe. Thanks Lisa!!

I used this recipe for a party and it was a huge hit.  All the meat was gone and I had a lot of it. I had lots of compliments on how good it was and a lot of people wanting the recipe. This is by far the best I have found. I highly recommend it. I use it on chicken too. Just be sure that you do as the recipe says with pounding out the meat.  I use the rough side instead of the flat side. Great for a summer grilling party.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this wonderful recipe!  Yes, the citrus flavors are slightly pronounced,  but with the seasonings, it has a very balanced flavor.  I marinated the meat overnight, and didn't pound it; I only pierced the meat thoroughly before marinating. I served this to guests, who stayed several extra hours at our house just to have the leftovers for dinner!

Love this recipe.   It came out perfect.  I used hanger steak instead and blended everything in the Vitamix and it was the best Carne Asada.

We loved this!  I made exactly as the recipe stated except I used traditional flap steak instead.  I also didn't marinade the entire 24 hours since flap steak is so thin.  It was so flavorful!  I will definitely be making agin.  Thanks, Lisa!

Excellent mojitos!  I used homemade simple syrup instead of granular sugar because sugar does not always dissolve completely in a cold drink before it's ready to drink.

Didn't have chili powder so used 1 tsp of cayenne instead. Other than that, didn't change the recipe. A-MAZ-ING!  Pouring the cup of marinade over the top after it is cooked is KEY!

This recipe is soooooooooooo easy to follow, quick simple and delicious!! I love that you can throw all the ingredients together and then marinate overnight. Delicious, I topped all my Hispanic friends recipes when I made this. My husband loves it too. We will definitely make this for our vacations in Havasu Thanks so much for sharing :)

I didn't have orange juice or lemon juice, so I increased the lime juice and added brown sugar. I omitted the soy sauce. I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and it marinated in the refrigerator overnight. Cooked in batches in an iron skillet and pair with homemade tortillas. I used carne picada because it was already thin sliced and was perfect for tacos. The result was definitely delicious and crowd pleasing! Can't wait to try the recipe as is, I am sure that it is just as good!

With a couple of small changes, this tasted just like the Carne Asada that I used to have in San Diego. I only used 1/3 cup of orange juice and since I couldn't find the canned chipotle I used 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle powder since that is what I had on hand.

Closest to authentic flavor I have tried- we love this one! I make it just as the recipe states and it comes out perfect every time. I usually marinate a roast in it overnight and slow cook it for pulled beef for tacos and burritos. After the meat is cooked, I freeze the leftovers and can make quick tacos anytime.

Loved this recipe!  I would DEFINITELY recommend marinating it, as said, for 24 hours.  The flavor and tenderness was incredible.  I thought the cumin was a little strong for my taste, so next time I would reduce that a bit.  I also would double the garlic.  Thanks, will be making again very soon!

This is out of this world amazing!!!  My husband made this (with a few slight changes based on ingredients we had on hand) and it tasted very similar to some of the delicious steaks we had in our travels to Latin America that we were hoping to duplicate. We will definitely be making this again!  I served it as a steak with sides of black beans, cilantro rice pilaf, homemade salsa and guacamole.  Delicious!

This marinade is awesome! I also add Worcestershire sauce. I also use it for chicken, veggies, and even tofu! There have been a few times I didn't have any citrus and I substituted vinegar. It still tasted pretty good.

This was not carne asada!!! My husband and I have had carne asada at so many authentic mexican restaurants and this just was not it. I was so excited thinking i could make this at home. The flavor was just way, Way off!!!! We marinaded over night and grilled it. The meat was also dry. I could have grilled a plain flank steak and it would have been better.

First tried this with boneless pork cutlets.  Today, split the marinade between steak and boneless chicken thighs (b/c we had guest who don't eat red meat.)  An all around success.

The marinade itself deserves 5 stars, but the recommendation of flank steak is a mistake.  Next time I will definitely use skirt steak.  Still, the marinade is phenomenal.

I wanted to spice it up a bit so also added 2 diced jalapenos and 1 bunch chopped green onions to the marinade.  I had 2 lb.s of diced carne asada meat and marinated it overnight and browned it in a pan on the stove.  DELICIOUS!!  Will definitely make again - this recipe is going in the box for sure!  Thanks!

Oookay. I'm all for trying new things: I made the marinade 2 nights ago then cooked it last night... The meat was tough, I even tenderized it before hand, but by gods, it was horrible. I made it exactly how the recipe stated and everything, minus the whole having to tenderize it with the bumpy side of the meat tenderizer (along with the flat side) the meat was bland. all I could really taste was the chili powder. I'd like to say it was a great recipe and went off without a hitch like all of the other recipes I've tried on here before, but It didn't. Haha... 2nd failed dinner in 2 nights. (Previous night I made chicken breast with basmati white rice, seasoned with "Emeril's Chicken Rub" which sucked

I've been looking for a great fajita recipe and this carne asada recipe is great! I live in New Mexico and have been trying to find a good citrus based marinade  for fajitas because my favorite restaurant uses a citrus based one. I followed to the letter and I wouldn't change one THING about the recipe! Do not skip grilling the meat! i know people are tempted to just fry it in a cast iron skillet but grilling makes all the difference. Let's just say that I won't be frequenting that restaurant anymore...well at least not for fajitas LOL, Thanks Lisa

This was really good. The marinade could be used on all sorts of steak. The only thing I would do differently next time is add a little less oil, it just didn't seem necessary.

Tangy, nice heat and delicious. I wasn't sure how the citrus would go with the chipotle sauce but it was perfect. I was also initially a little put off with all the ingredients but I had them all in my cupboard and they were perfect together. You got hints of cumin, oregano, chipotle and citrus with each bite. I marinated a london broil which I put under the broiler for 7 mins on each side and it worked well. It was also worth it to save some of the sauce to dip the meat in after and I also poured some on the sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts I had on the side. Very flavorful and now part of the family recipe book. I think we'll try it on a pork tenderloin, too.

I didn't had the chilli, I didn't had the soy sauce I use teriyaki sauce with sesame seeds instead and i use chicken. I put the ingredients in a flat pan with the chicken in the oven on 350°f  to get crispy or toast. My family loved it.  For the next time I will do the same but with the steak. Great recipe

I can't rate the recipe as written. I omitted lemon and orange juice and used a dash of ground chipotle pepper instead of the peppers in adobo as my kiddos can't handle the heat.  The remaining ingredients made a tasty marinade for steak taco meat.  My whole family ate it up.

I didnt make the entire recipe in the way I was supposed to - I was looking for a seasoning profile last minute and didn't have time to marinade.

I halved the quantities because I had less meat.  I was out of OJ, so I omitted it. Everything else went into my instant pot and was cooked with some stew beef for carne asada quesadillas.

Excellent!

This is great. Full of flavor and tender.  Fairly straight forward to make, I used Chipotle powder instead of chilli. Also only managed to marinade it for about 9 hours, but it was still awesome.  Will definitely be made again.  The left overs were great in soft tacos, possibly even better tasting than the first serving.

My teen said “I really like it- I don’t know why, but I really like it a lot. Fix more!” I added more beef to stretch and added carrots to the veggie part. It was really good!!

DELICIOUS!! I used oven brook setting instead of grill (no grill at house), and turned out delicious. Marinated for 24 hours. Recommend double the marinade, it’s amazing. No changes recommended except having some fresh lime and cilantro to top the dish. Saved for future use!

This is an all time favourite - I love to make it for big family get togethers! The recipe makes A LOT of marinade - I’ll often reserve some extra to use on a big pan full of sautéed bell peppers.

Simple ingredients is always my favorite. I used some frozen orange juice from concentrate and Chipotle chili pepper instead of regular chili pepper. Wasn't too spicy at all. I love to eat carne asada with cotija cheese (salty and very crumbly, and good to freeze) and a squirt of lime juice. I also lightly fry up corn tortillas. So good. Corn tortillas can dry out easily, so a few drops of oil on a pan brings out great taste and makes it foldable. Flour tortillas are more flexible, but doesn't offer the same at all. Corn tortillas all the way!

Followed this but added a half bottle of beer and a whole onion sliced into the marinade. Grilled over charcoal for tacos and I must say it was delicious.

This was impressive.  I just used a splash of soy sauce and I added 2tsp salt. I also added more garlic and 2 tsp apple cider vinegar. I used it to marinate  the drop from a whole tenderloin and some shrimp. I only marinated it for 4 hours since the meat was already tender. Then I made kabobs and grilled them. It was really good. I am deducting 1 point because of the soy sauce. It is too much. Plus it needed a hint of sweet to balance the acid. Next time I make it I am adding a bit of sugar or honey. But I will definitely be making it, a lot.

Update - I habe made this at least 3 more times since my original review. I use a chuck roast and pressure cook it. Chuck is less money than flank and we are on a budget. My family loves it. I still use a tiny bit of soy sauce and salt but have only changed it by adding in some more chipotle or another spicy chile in addition to tbe chipotle. The only time I get leftovers is when I pull out a chunk of meat and hide it from my husband and son. It is a favorite in our house. Thank you.

No changes!!!
I had a steak about a pound and a third so I cut the marinade recipe in half.
I marinaded a skirt steak over night. I grilled it over hardwood coals.
The carne asada was so delicious and tender.
I will definitely make this often. I served the steak thinly sliced with fresh Pico de gallo, sour cream and shredded lettuce in warmed fajita sized flour tortillas.
Fabulous! !!!

Oh goodness, this was the real deal!  I marinated the steak for 24 hrs, cooked it for 5 min each side on the grill and sliced it up.   It was like butter!!!  We served these as street tacos and everyone couldn't get enough!!!  We will be making this again!

Made marinade as recipes  states other than no chipotle peppers since I didn’t have them.  I used round roast sliced for carne asada from the store, and cooked in a giant skillet. Family enjoyed. Served with rice and sautéed peppers and onions, wrapped in tortillas. Will keep this recipe and fix again!

I omitted paprika and added a tsp or so more of chipotle, used flank steak and sirloin. I can’t compare it to the original but it was worthy of our lineup!! I’ve served it as a taco filler 2x and on top of romaine with a lime cilantro vinaigrette and cojita cheese. The compliments keep on coming and the whole family loves it! Recently I added sautéed peppers for a fajita style and poured the remaining sauce over it all- absolutely the best carne asada recipe I’ve found. Looking forward to every taco Tuesday ??

Fantastic marinade!  I used a Jaccard prior to marinading. I also strongly recommend squeezing lime over the meat just before eating it.

Yum! I didn't have time to marinade it, and was cooking it in the crockpot, which needs less liquid, so I halved the recipe (skipping reserving the 1 C) and that was more than enough. I drained a can of kidney beans and added that. When the meat  was done, I put a cup of liquid from the crockpot into a pot, shredded the meat with two forks, and then added it to the pot. I had it over a big salad with tortilla chips and my OH had 3.5 burritos. Super tender and flavorful!

Exceptional marinade, only thing I did differently was I blended all the ingredients together.
In my opinion this allowed the spices to shine along side the citrus base as opposed to fighting each other.

Yummy, yummy yummy. I did add some beer for the marinade, but no can of chipotle. Cooked on a flat grill at work, (Home Depot), added warmed corn tortillas, sautéed onions and cilantro….. Great!  Added money to our employee fund  . :-)

Used this recipe as a slow cooker carne asada instead of a marinade for a taco bar party weeks ago...people are still talking about how good it was!

I squeezed the fruit so I had fresh juice and everything else was exactly as the recipe said. It was magnificent! everyone said it was the best they had every eaten. OI will definitely make it again, still with fresh juice.
(I think I liked pounding the Flank streak a bit too much.)

So Good!  Wanted to make delicious carne asada for my gluten free guests (corn tortillas).  They ate it up.   No leftovers.  I used Cajun seasoning instead of chili power because I was out.  Still awesome.  Marinated meat for 24 hours.  Thanks Lisa.

I tasted it and it was needing adjustment for my taste of the citrusy taste...I adjusted only for my plate and put sugar.  When I had it the next day, I got used to the taste and its my favorite sauce.

OK, I have tried several asada recipes only to walk away sad. This recipe is the real deal. Unfortunately I didn't have OJ or an orange so I stole some of my husband's Odwalla Mango Tango juice and used it in place of the orange juice. I also added about 1/4 worschestire. I also did not have the chile adobo so I left that out as well. I marinated my flank steak without punching holes in the meat for about 30 hours. I grilled it and cut it up and served with tortillas and some guacamole. Yum!

Good recipe.......... Still looking though. Just missed it for my taste. Not sure why, maybe the soy sauce, not quite the citrus fresh taste I'm searching for. I hope shes' out there.

I don't usually leave reviews but I fixed this for dinner tonight and had to comment. I found some sirloin steak in the freezer and decided it needed to become steak tacos. It obviously didnt flatten out to 1/4 inch, but it was the most tender delicious sirloin I have ever had. My husband and roommate both also liked it and definitely want it returned.

Very good--had to use a tropical juice (orange, banana, pineapple) and pepper flakes instead of chili powder, and it still worked fine.

I marinated both thinly sliced steaks and thinly sliced chicken breast in this tonight for tacos - very good. The only thing I changed was I omitted the oregano, reduced the black pepper, used 1T of chipotle sauce instead of the canned peppers, and reduced the oil a bit.

This recipie was perfect. I added some jalapeno for a little more spice and it was soooo good. for those that are complaining that the citrus taste is too strong, try doing just 1/2 cup OJ, 1/4 cup lemon and 1/4 cup of lime.

Rave reviews every time. We use fresh squeezed juices and always marinate over night or longer. This is the BEST carne asada recipe and the only one we recommend

Hands-down, the best marinade I've ever made or had!  Used it on lamb chops too, and despite my love of lamb-with-mint-jelly, these chops were the best lamb I've ever eaten!  My wife has a garlic sensitivity, so I omitted that.  Also, we're not lovers of cilantro, so I subbed in parsley instead... still great!

ok for a starter recipe.  #1 I tenderize & "hammer the living  out of the protein" lol  to 1/3 inch prior to the marinade, it really helps.  #2 I sub all lemon juice w/ Sunny D -- or you can use fresh valencia orange juice .  #3 Cut chili pwd to 1 tsp, #4 drop chipotle ppr to just under 1 tsp and put everything in blender. #5 You can marinate meat over 24 hrs, yet it becomes more cumin-flavored. Most socal carnicerias do not add cilantro or garlic, yet it's up to you. I suggest also to drop the cumin just a bit.

The best carne asada marinade!! Every time I use this marinade I get rave reviews. The only change I make is that I leave the adobo chipotle pepper out. I used it once, didn’t use it the next time simply because I didn’t have any on hand and I didn’t miss it all. So I just leave it out since it’s not something I keep in stock.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It has become my go-to carne asada recipe!  I have a few minor adjustments.  I omit the canned chipotle pepper because I don't want to keep it in my fridge.  I also omit the lemon juice because it's a bit too citrusy for my liking.  I prefer using skirt steak over flank steak; skirt steak really takes in the flavor.  I sprinkle garlic salt directly onto both sides of the meat.

I used all the ingredients but maybe not exact measurements because I just don’t.  This was AMAZING!!!  It had a nice warmth on the tongue but not so hot you’re breathing through your mouth.  My chipotle peppers were in adobo sauce.  I marinated overnight then put in the slow cooker slow and low for about 8 hours. Served on warm corn tortillas, fresh cilantro and lime wedges.  Will definitely make again!!!!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was an amazing recipe. I am a fireman and made this at the firehouse. You wanna talk about critics, the firehouse will tear you down if you prepare a crappy meal. With that said I had a few guys saying they would pay for this at a resturaunt

This did not taste like authentic carne asada and yes I have had it in Mexico, not just Americanized versions.  The chef at our clubhouse is from Mexico and his also does not taste like this.  He says in Mexico, they don't use soy sauce.  Also no lemons.  I have to say that the meat was very tender, but the sour citrus taste of this recipe was overwhelming for me.  If you like sour citrus, you might enjoy this recipe more than I did.

I made this marinade using Flap steak from Costco.  I didn't have any chipotle peppers on hand, so I just left those out.  I marinated the meat for 2 days and then we grilled it and used it for tacos.  It was so yummy!!!!

This recipe was a hit!! I added green onions like a couple of people commented. I also put all ingredients in a blender and blended them together so the cilantro and green onions could really give flavor. I loved it and so did everyone else. It was super easy too.

Thank you, thank you and thank you!!!!  there are a handful of things I can make that my whole family loves, and this is a grand slam winner in our house.  I make it exactly as written.  We use chicken breast, sliced into 1" thick strips and grill.  I then chip them up, add any juice from the cooked chicken and the mix in some of the maranade set aside in the beginning.  It is so good!  Thank you Lisa!

I used the marinade for skirt steak fajitas, saving some of the marinade out to add to the veggies as I finished sauteing them.  As I didn't have oranges, I used orange juice concentrate.  Definitely will make again!

I used this marinade for "the Best Meal I Ever Made" according to my family. I used a flat iron steak at the suggestion of the butcher. I used it in Carne Asada Breakfast Fries from this site. Marinated for 24 hours and served chopped over Oven Baked Fries with fresh salsa and guacamole with a sunny side egg on top. Delicious!!! Only change I made was to add green onions at the suggestion of another reviewer. Flavors shone through and proportions were spot on! Thanks for making my family's day!

Good recipe. It was a bit spicy and needs salt. I now know the add salt to the recipe. I marinated my meat for a few days and it came out good. Just needed salt. I will use it again.  Thank you for sharing.

Oh my god, this made for the best taco meat I have ever had. Better than Chipotle. The only things I did differently than the recipe was that I bought a cut that was already thin, so I didn't pound it, and I cooked it on the stove instead of a grill, which worked fine.

My brother and I loved it. I made some changes on accident, but it was still good and may be more citrus. I put 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 cup of lime, 1/3 cup of Lemon. Those are the changes. I will definitely make it again.

This marinade is so good! No, really...it is awesome!!! We usually just buy carne asada from our local tortilleria, but this was even better than theirs. I made this exactly as written (except I don't really measure anything) and this will be my go-to recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing!

Don't know to many  kitchens in Mexico  use  soy sauce??  Tried it based on reviews and did detect the soy sauce flavor.  Not what I look for in  a Mexican dish.   Will try again  without the Asian ingredient.    Didn't give any  savory advantage.

Love! Love! LOVE this recipe!  Marinated 7# of flap meat (skirt steak) for 24 hrs.  Doubled the recipe and used all ingredients listed, generously adding more garlic.  Fabulous raves and reviews from all in attendance. Repeatedly told it was the best Carne Asada they've ever tasted!  Excellent recipe!  Thank you so much for posting!  Read the comments  and reviews and BELIEVE!!

This is so good! I'm not usually a carne asada fan, but my husband wanted to make it, and it was wonderful. I didn't change anything; we grilled the meat after it marinated and rolled it in tortillas with cheese, onions, guac, sour cream and some of the reserved marinade.  The flavor was so much better than any other carne asada I have ever had! Will definitely make this again.

I will make this again but plan to add more spice and salt to the marinade. It had a nice flavor but was flat compared to the recipe I used to use (and lost). It's a good base that I will build on though.

Absolutely delicious and very easy.  We only marinated it for about 4 hours and it still had a ton of flavor.  I halved the chili powder and didn't use the entire amount of cumin.

If there were more stars, I'd give this recipe more. I followed the recipe exact. The video for this showed the meat being grilled but I didn't feel like grilling tonight so I did the cast iron skillet.  Oh, I used rump roast as the store didn't have flank steak.  The meat marinated for about 12 hours before cooking. I cooked each slice (4 of them) to a medium rare.  I sliced each slice cross grain and as the meat had cooled, the reserved marinade was poured into the skillet alone and cooked until it reduced and became fairly thick. Then I returned the thin slices and cooked for only 2 minutes.  It was so good, we didn't even use tortillas.  I served with fried potatoes and Spanish rice.  My boys even made the comment that this was one of the best meals they've had in a long time even though we always eat really good food.  I will definitely make this many more times.

We have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was a little to much orange flavored for us.  This time, I used about 2/3 of the orange and a bit extra lime.  We didn't have any cilantro so a used 1 tablespoon of coriander seeds that I ground using a mortar and pestle.  We loved it and gave this version 5 stars for our palate.

I've made this marinade three times in two weeks- it is wonderful. I use filet mignon in place of flank steak. Melts in your mouth!

Overall I thought it was quite good. The only slight modifications I made were less lemon juice and more garlic. Also I only had time to marinate for 2 hours and would recommend longer(as she says in her recipe). Next time I will further cut back the lemon as well as the other two citrus ingredients - not a lot but just to balance it out a bit

This was delicious!! Wanted to do it on the grill, but it was raining so cooked it in the slow cooker.  Kids all say "mom it's a keeper"
Will make this again.  the only change is I used less orange juice than recipe called for and next time I will use a different cut of steak instead of flank steak.  didn't like how stringy it was in the cooker.

If I could give this marinade recipe more stars I would! 
Absolutely delicious marinade! I didn't have any  canned chipotle peppers on hand so I left them out. This will be my new go to recipe for marinade!

It was pretty good!  I had been buying grocery store butcher counter marinated carne asada steak , and was looking to replicate that at home.  This recipe came close.

My main criticism of the recipe is that it was way to lemony.  It was like lemon steak.  I will cut back on the lemon juice next time.  (I used combo of fresh squeezed lemons and store bought lemon juice, wonder if that had something to do with it?)

My second critique is that the marinade has a lot of sediment from all the spices, especially after pouring the cup of marinade that we are instructed to save on top of the cooked meat.  I bet I would have enjoyed it more if I didn't do that, or at least strained the sauce.  Next time I will attempt to do that.

Overall, it was worth making as it gave me a lot of experience with this set of flavoring, and ideas on how to tweak if for next time.

My fiance and I ate a pound of this carne asada in one sitting, if that gives you a better idea of my feelings about this recipe!

Made this just like it said, and turned out awesome.  My wife even said the meat was addicting.  Instead of flank, I used Flap/Skirt steak and chopped after cooking, and was great.  It is citrusy and not too spicy, so you may have add more chili for more kick.  Don't think I would really changes anything about it...just maybe marinade for even 36 hrs.

I forgot to put the lime juice in but turns out it wasn't really needed. Marinated for about 6 hours and it was so juicy and tender. Also cold and snowy so didn't grill but cut into bite size pieces and cooked on stove top in the extra marinade and just reduced the liquid down to form a sauce. Paired with cilantro lime cauliflower rice and it made an excellent meal.

Awesome recipe!  I used carne asada meat from the deli at Fred Meyer. It's sliced super thin. We love heat so I added a whole can of chipotle peppers in adobe. I was a little worried because I only marinated it for a couple hours.  Wow! I think this is the best Carne Asada I've ever had! I served it with "La Tortilla Homemade Corn Tortillas" ( if you haven't tried these you are missing out!) and pico de gallo and rice and black beans. So yummy!

This is DELICIOUS!  I've finally found THE recipe that replicates the authentic carne asada flavor I was after.  My young kids even raved about how good the steak was.  Serve on double wrapped corn tortillas with diced white onion and cilantro.  YUMMM!  We will be making this often.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I have made this marinade a dozen time or more. It is fantastic. I have used it of course on steak, but I've also used it with pork, chicken breasts and even made homemade sausage with meat that I marinated with this recipe. There is none that I have found or had that is better.

Delicious.  I did omit the orange and increased the lime juice to make up for it.  Loved the idea of reserving 1 cup of marinade to  pour over cooked meat.  I grilled it.  Thank you!

This was so delicious!  I think I even liked it better than getting the Carna Asada meat at the local Mexican market. It had a citrus taste which made it seem so light and fresh. It worked really well to grill to medium rare and it did continue as we pulled it off to become medium. My family absolutely loved it!! It's a keeper!

Delicious! I made one change, I do not like soy sauce, so I substituted with a few dashes of hickory smoke and a few dashes of  Worchestershire Sauce.  Fantastic marinade!

My favorite Carne Asada so far.  I made it exactly as the recipe said, then used it for tacos.  Topped the tacos w/ mexican crema w/ a little chipotle and lime mixed in and cabbage.  Lots and lots of flavor.

It was freakin' amazing. The flavor was a perfect combination, and the meat was so tender. I actually used skirt steak instead of flank just because I had it, and it worked incredibly well. I served it with homemade cuban style black beans and rice, plantains, and flan. I definitely recommend this!!

I honestly was a bit  skeptical about all the citrus in this marinade, but it was awesome! I did half the recipe, as I only had 1.5 lbs of meat. I also didn't use as much cilantro, I was running low and needed some for the slaw I was making, so it probably was only about a 1/4 of a cup at most. Oh- I also didn't have any canned chipotle in adobo, but I did have dried Chipotle, so I used that, and the meat only marinated for about 2 hours. This was a huge hit. I had recently found a really good fajita marinade on this site, but I'm pretty sure this will be our new go-to fajita/carne asada marinade!

I love this marinade! Yes there's a lot of ingredients but oh so worth it! I've made this 5-6 times already and it works with all sorts of different beef cuts (flap, chuck steak, etc.) 
This has quickly become my go to marinade for beef! Thanks for sharing!

This could be great, but it is too citrusy. By itself or served as intended. Probably not again as designed. I'll need to tweak the amounts of citrus.

O.M.G. Yum yum yum. I had carne asada at a restaurant in San Antonio once that literally was the best steak I've ever eaten. This marinade is just as good if not better. Thank you for this recipe! My kids are like "please make this every night". Can't wait to try this on chicken. Wow. Awesome.

Delicious! I loved the citrus flavor and especially liked the fresh taste resulting from adding the citrus/soy marinade at the finish. Paired with brown rice and brussels sprouts tonight; will enjoy in a salad later this week. Will definitely make again. Thanks for submitting.!

This was so good! Really surprised just how delicious it turned out! Did the recipe exactly and didn't change a thing.. What I did after was used the marinade that was set aside not on the meat (it was so juice didn't need anything) but cooked up a can of pinto beans (drained some water) with 1/2 chopped onion and remaining marinade... Added that as burrito filling with chopped up meat, tasted like a great taco stand burrito! Juicy and rich with flavor

Served this for my wife and 2 daughters all from northern Mexico (Monclova) While many of he ingredients are not "typical" in mexican cooking, they all loved this recipe! As in love love love it. 

Bottom line I think I have a job for life making the marinade for the carne asada. Great job Lisa, amazing flavor!!

This was great, although not quite as spicy as I had hoped. The acidity of the citrus is great, and it helps to tenderize the meat, which came out fantastic.

I have been using this recipe for a while now. I use it to make fajitas. Cut up your veggies put them in a Ziploc with a cup of this marinade. Put flat iron steak in a separate Ziploc and add the remaining marinade. Put in the fridge for 6 hours and then cook meat on your grill. We put the veggies in foil and put on the grill the last 15-20 minutes of the meat being done. We use the juice from the veggie bav to baste the meat with. Great flavor!!!

I've used this recipe many times over the past few years. Its a family favorite now. The flavor is authentic. I use fresh squeezed citrus juices and marinate the meat over night. Set a small portion of the marinade aside before use to drizzle on the grilled meat when its served. Its best with flank steak but is wonderful with top sirloin and even chicken. I always serve it with sliced grilled onions and bell peppers, fresh guacamole, and pico de gallo. It takes a little prep ahead of time but its well worth it.

We had friends over for dinner, and I prepared this.  It came out very tender and flavorful.  I had to make a couple changes, because I never leave any recipe alone!  But I'm sure it's tasty just as written!  Also, I didn't have chipotle peppers or cilantro.  So I used a teaspoon of red pepper flakes (probably could have used more. We didn't taste any heat in the finished product). I used avocado oil instead of olive because it's healthier.  I also sprinkled natural meat tenderizer and a bit of adobo seasoning on the meat after pounding it. Marinated in a zip bag over 24 hours, and everyone loved it!  Thank you, Lisa!

Cooked it up and it was very tasty. I substituted Cholula sauce for the chipotle peppers because I couldn't find any at the store, couldn't find any cumin either, or lime juice (I added more Lemon).
I also added two drops of Satan's Blood (Very very hot hot sauce) to give it a nice little bite.
Barbequed it up, and threw it in some tacos. Some people said it was too spicy, but everyone else loved it.

This was very tasty, not salty, and full of flavor. Since I had no chipotle, I used another red chile for spice. I used sliced carne asada and sauteed with onions and peppers. It was delicious.  Next time I want to try it with the flank steak. Thanks for a great recipe.

I did not have the canned chipotle but I did use everything else and my family loved this. Even my 3 year old son who doesnt like beef loved this over the chicken taco we made for him. He seriously loved it. We made this last week and will be making this again tomorrow. We had been looking for a new taco because we were growing tired of our usually chicken tacos (recipe from on here as well)so this will be nice to swap in and out. We made fresh Pico De Gallo, added alittle more onion and cilantro on top. The rest of our meal brought the spice that this needed but this was great.

It's a great marinade. It came out great as the recipe was written.  After using it, though, I would suggest that if you are cooking this over a wood fire, the smokiness of the canned chipotles is really overkill and I would suggest a more "green" flavored chile like a anaheim or fresno.  I would also brush the steaks on the grill with the marinade right before taking them off, rather than using the reserved cup as a sauce because it's pretty strong for a sauce.

This is a good recipe, but turned out a little too much on the citrus side for our liking. Good basic one to go by though, I would reduce the citrus next time.

Good marinade, I would make it again. For my personal taste it wasn't quite spicy enough so I would increase the chipotle peppers or add some hot sauce or something next time, but overall I enjoyed it. I served it in corn tortillas with a corn salsa, sour cream, and sliced avocado.

By far my favorite carne asada marinade. And...I only let the meat marinade for about 45 minutes (as opposed to 24 hours)before grilling. It was fantastic!

This is a must add to your recipe box.  After it was off the grill and cut, with the sauce poured over it, it was good.  The next day after the extra marinade soaked into the already cut pieces, it was luscious!  Ate some of the leftovers as is, and for another meal, made fajita/tacos - added some rice, sour cream and avocado to the tacos - delish!  For both meals, used the Best Spanish Rice recipe at http://allrecipes.com/recipe/best-spanish-rice/detail.aspx.  Perfect!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that we have added to our list of recipes to make when guests come for dinner!

My entire family loved this! It's very hard to get all of them to agree on how much they like something but this won raves from all, including the pickiest eater of our family.  I followed the recipe as is, with the expectation that I would most likely need to play with seasonings on the next try.  I was pleasantly surprised to note that I wouldn't need to play with the recipe at all for next time! This is definitely going into our favorites!

I prepared this recipe very little changes:  added a little white vinegar, omitted the cilantro and used a homemade recaito (it has lots of cilantro in it along with other delicious flavors), and since I couldn't get any chipotles I just used a jalapeno. I'll admit, when I tasted this marinade before using it I wasn't so sure about it.  But I pressed on and marinated my flank steak for a few hours and it turned out fantastic.  Even the kids loved it!  All of the flavors blended very well in the steak, and the steak was pretty tender.  To the recipe box this goes!

Having searched for an authentic tasting marinade, I came across this one.  AMAZING.  My children and husband inhaled it.  Change nothing!  I didn't reserve any marinade, instead, I just boiled for 3 min the marinade while the meat was cooking.  After I sliced the meat, I poured a cup of the marinade over the meat to reheat.

This was a very tasty recipe, and I'll definitely use it from now on, but with one small change.  The olive oil somewhat overpowered the wonderful flavors present before I added the oil.  Next time, I will cut the oil in half, or maybe even less.  But overall the best carne asada marinade I've tried yet!

I made this recipe with pork loin.  Like others, I was overwhelmed by the citrus initially.  I cooked a test bit after 2-3 hours of marinating.  Citrus was strong then, and other spices fairly mild. I had used 2 chipotle peppers (canned in adobe sauce with most adobo removed) - added 3 more blended with a little of the reserve marinade and added it to the meat.  Cooked the following day after 16 hours of marinade time.  Ended up adding salt to the meat as it cooked and to the reserve (also added two more chipotle peppers to reserve - total of 7 peppers).  Was fabulous!  Served in tortillas with mexican blend cheese shreds, fresh sliced onions, bell peppers and red cabbage dressed with reserve marinade.  Will do again, with added salt, chipotle peppers and less/no orange juice, more lime.

Wow!!! I just ate the carne asada that i marinated for 2 days and it was out of this world delicious! I broiled it due to bbq limitations. Also, instead of using the canned chipotle, i highly recommend using chipotle powder. It intensified the flavors even more, and I personally wouldn't waste an entire can of chipotle peppers for a minimal difference in taste. I used orange juice from the supermarket. It tasted very similar to the premarinated ranchera meat that I get from my fav Mexican market. The meat was tender and the flavor was on point. I also used less lemon juice than the recipe calls for. It really doesn't need that much.

I made changes to this recipe and it turned out great. I omitted the orange, lime, chipotle, and paprika.  Added a half cup of beer, 1 small onion, and a 1/2 tsp white sugar.  Put everything in a blender, seasoned meat with salt and then poured mixture over meat.  Marinated in refrigerator for 2 hours.  Will marinade longer next time.

This recipe is amazing.  I have tried many different carne asada recipes and with a few modifications, this is the absolute best (I'm done searching).  Modifications: I used 1/2 cup lime juice (instead of 1/3), I omitted the chipotle and instead I added about 3/4 of a large jalapeno pepper, thinly sliced.  I think I probably added a little extra garlic too (Just because I always do).  For the chili powder I used some from one of those packets you get in the mexican food aisle (as opposed to the jarred stuff - I find it to have a much more complex flavor).  I used an immersion blender to mix everything together well and emulsify it.  Absolutely phenomenal!!

Marinated skirt steak and chicken overnight.  Make sure to reserve a cup of marinade to brush post-cooking! Excellent with chipotle salsa and corn tortillas.

This is the best and last marinade recipe I will try.  It left the meat tender, juicy, and flavorful!  Now I don't have to search and experiment anymore. Thank you for posting it and sharing it with us. And for those complaining about the citrus taste…. Well feel free to experiment with the amounts in the recipe they are not set in stone.  Reduce the amounts of juices and increase the soy and spices, eventually you'll find what you like and be happy.  Personally, I loved this one.

THE BEST.  I cannot believe how delicious this marinade/sauce is, and it makes the steak soooooo tender and juicy when allowed to sit in the fridge for 24 hours. Followed the recipe exactly as written, except I subbed chopped dried chipotle peppers instead of the canned. This is the best recipe for flank steak I've found.

i usually buy "carne asada..preparada" (prepared carne asada) at the mexican meat market... but i made this as stated on the recipe and my family as well as i LOVED IT!!  definately amazing!  i was having friends over so i purchased the meat at SAMS club 2 large pieces about 5lbs total (20servings).    it was a little work to cut the meat, pound and fork it as well as store it in large freezer bags to marinade but soooooo worth it!  my friends mom owns a mexican restaurant in Park City so i was curious to have her taste it... she asked me for the recipe :)   i will definatley make it again!

I have made this recipe before and it was a hit.  I am making it again tonight for a different side of the family and I know it will disappear again (thought I should rate it this time!).  This is the best carne recipe just like it is.  Don't touch it and you can't miss!  Thanks Lisa!

This is a fabulous recipe! I wasn't so sure about all the citrus juices, but it doesn't overwhelm the meat (which I barely had 2 lbs of). I added a little extra chipotle pepper (on accident) and it still turned out awesome. Also, I made it in the slow cooker since we were planning on it for dinner that night. Turned out great (on high for about 3 hours), then "fried" it up in a cast iron skillet to give it that wonderful crunchiness from the grill. Also used a little of the left over marinade on some brown rice. Overall, an awesome recipe!

This comes as close as I've ever had to the carne asada I ate in Mexico when I was younger.  The second time I made it, I neglected to pound the steak, although it did marinate for almost 48 hours.  It still came out incredibly tender.  In the future, I'll probably skip the pounding and let the marinade tenderize the beef.  Outstanding!!!  This winter I'll follow other reviewers' suggestion and try it in the slow cooker.

This recipe was amazing!  It never made it into the toritilla shells though, because my boyfriend and I kept eating it faster than it was coming out of the pan.  He said it was the best Carne Asada he's ever had (GROWING UP IN A HISPANIC HOME!).  I didn't have the chipotle pepper so I just used a close substitute and it worked out fine.  Great flavor.  We will definitely make this again!

The meat came out sooo juicy, tasty and tender, this marinade is very similar to what they use at carnicerias (mex. butcher's shop). I will definitely make again and again and again.

Living in L.A., there are plenty of carnecerias where carne asada can be purchased pre-marinated, but getting the buthcher to reveal the recipe is impossible.  This is THE BEST marinade our family has ever had.  Coming from a Mexican, that is a big compliment, LOL.  This marinade is also good on chicken.

After reading the reviews and looking at the ingredients I thought this would be great. I followed the recipe and, unfortunately found it just average. My quest for excellent Carne Asada continues.

This was great!! I made it for a tailgate party, and everyone raved about it! I let the meat marinate for 48 hrs. and so much better than store bought!!
