I tripled this recipe because I wanted to make enough to use in individual servings. I found that for 8 oz of hot water you'll need 5 level Tablespoons of the hot chocolate mix. This is not too sweet and not too chocolaty, with a hint of cinnamon. Very tasty served with some marshmallows on top. Thanks for the recipe.

I increased the cocoa amount to 5 tablespoons per 1gdcowgirl's review. After I poured the cocoa in the cups, I topped each cocoa serving with french vanilla marshmallow snowmen. Great weekend treat--the kids and I absolutely loved it.

Super simple to make and very delicious--MUCH better than a store-bought mix!!   I love chocolate, so I used two heaping tablespoons of regular baking cocoa and 1 tablespoon of dark cocoa, plus a dash of vanilla extract---the end result was rich and delicious, and completely satisfied my chocolate craving :)

This is great!  I was looking for a quick and easy hot chocolate mix recipe.  It's just what I was looking for.  The cinnamon is an excellent touch!

This was good hot cocoa, but had a very strange texture at the bottom. Probably wont make it again...

Very good. I threw the mix into my hot chocolate maker and it was awesome! A much more frugal alternative to buying the mix at the store, but with a better taste!

Very nice, mild chocolate.  I doubled the cinnamon and used about 5 Tblsps per coffee mug of hot water.

It has a very mild, chocolately flavor and isn't terribly sweet, which I like!  I think you could make this a little richer by adding some milk or half and half after mixing.

Pretty good! My powdered milk wasn't nonfat - and I still ended up splashing some half & half in to make it creamier. Finished it off with marshamllows and chopped semisweet chocolate. Yum.

I used dark chocolate cocoa because that's all I had.  I also added more of the powdered milk because it looked too watery. I think I will try it next time without adding the extra powdered milk, as it ended up being too thick. Good homemade, easy hot chocolate though. I will try it again.

Quick & easy but mediocre flavor.  Perhaps it needs a little more cocoa.

I haven't ever made hot chocolate before without using a store bought mix and now I don't think I'll ever buy a mix again.  This was wonderful.  Just the right amount of chocolatey goodness and super simple.  Loved it!

Choose this recipe because it used all dry ingredients... easy to store and is easy for my children to make a cup for themselves.
I made 5x batch, used Spenda for the sugar and added one bag each of shaved dark chocolate chips and white chocolate chips.  It tastes good with just adding the boiled water...but YUM if you add hot fat free milk :)

This hot chocolate recipe was delightful. Instead of powdered milk, I used a 2 cups of milk: 1 tablespoon of sugar: 2 teaspoons of cocoa ratio with 2% milk. Does not require perfection, but always tastes perfect! 

A warm treat for cold nights and a good book.

I really liked it.  I've made it two ways, followed the recipe, very good, then used splenda and strong hot coffee instead of water, just a little bit better in my opinion.  Next time I'm going to put in some cayenne pepper after I go to the store and purchase some.

Best Hot chocolate I had in years. I think the magic ingredients in this recipe are the baking cocoa ( not the ready made mixes) and the cinnamon, it gave it a huge kick. A Definte Keeper!

10.10.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/120563/haunting-hot-chocolate/ ... Another good review for Suzanne's Haunting Hot Chocolate!  'Used 1/3c mix w 1/2c hot water to dissolve, added 1/2c milk & heated.  'Didn't add the cinnamon since I'm not very partial to drinking spices.  Eating them is fine.  :D  Definately more creamy-tasting & looking than any others I've tried.  That's surprising w no creamer, but still true.  :)  Subtle chocolate flavor. 'Think more serious chocolate lovers would want to add more cocoa.  The 2:3 ration seems right, to me, for cocoa & sugar.  And, although I enjoyed this, K & I liked my adjusted version of Hot Chocolate I better.  It's more chocolatey, K said - & it is.  :D

This was great!  We made it with milk powder, which was a cheap and easy option.  It turned out great.  The next time, however, we tried this with soy milk powder, and it was not so great.  Tasted like wheat.  (Of course, that's nothing on the recipe. :P)  Also great if you add a bit of peppermint extract.

I am searching for the best hot chocolate on the web, there is nothing I love more on a cold snowy morning than a good hot chocolate.  This was easy to make and tasted great.  I did miss out the cinnamon.

I loved this recipe. I looked all over the web to find something with minimal ingredients that would also be tasty. Being a missionary in a foreign country can sometimes prove difficult with I can't run down to the local Walmart to pick up ingredients so I love finding recipes that are easy with few ingredients.  This was a great recipe. It reminded me of the hot cocoa out family always gets at a local amusement park in Texas when we're home for furlough.  I made one fop-pa, I used full fat powdered milk and it was not a pretty site. The taste was great but I couldn't get the milk to dissolve all the way.  After a full day of snow my family loved this cocoa with a ton of marshmallows piled on top.   Thanks for a great keeper!!

Easy to make, but the kids wouldn't drink it until I added some non-dairy creamer to it.  Then it was really smooth and they liked it.  It would be even better with flavored creamer.
