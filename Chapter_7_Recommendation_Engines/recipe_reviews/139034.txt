Absolutely delicious! My two daughters loved cutting out stars and Christmas trees for our holiday dinner. This got more reviews than anything I served. Will use this again and again.

Wow I really hate to do this but I made this for the Super Bowl and it was so wrong. The cook time is way off. I only had these under the broiler for about a minute maybe less. You can see from the photo that I posted that they would have been inedible after 8 minutes or even 5. The spread was okay but you need to take it out of the refrigerator to warm up and become spreadable as it will completely tear the bread if used while cold. The underside of the bread was completely soggy and unappetizing. In my opinion you should toast one side of the bread then put the spread on the untoasted side prior to putting these under the broiler.
