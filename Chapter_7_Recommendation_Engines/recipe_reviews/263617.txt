Freaking awesome. Didn't change a thing (why would I? It's Chef John for crying out loud!")  It's going into my permanent recipe file. Thanks Chef John!

Family loved it.  A little spicy for some of my younger kids ---- just throw in more sour cream.

Very tasty!! I left out the cilantro because my guest doesn't like it, but I look forward to adding it in next time. It's very easy to make & pretty inexpensive. I served with rice & avocado- tortilla chips would be good too.

Longtime viewer on the FW channel, first time comment. I just won our office's Chili Cook Off competition today with the Green Chicken Chili. So different, vibrant, and tasty. Thanks, Chef John!

This recipe is very dependent on the quality of sauce you purchase. We added more water and a chicken gravy packet to thicken and reduce the heat. We added vegetables and quinoa to make a thick soup and it was more to our taste.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! So much flavor!! I doubled the recipe and after 5 people ate there was not much left. I put frozen, boneless, skinless chicken breast in the crockpot, rinsed and poured the beans over the chicken, added everything else to the blender then poured it over the chicken and beans and cooked on low for about 5 hours. I then took out the chicken, shredded it and added it back to the crockpot. The chicken was tender and easy to shred. I will make this again and again! I also had some chicken stock so I rinsed out my blender with a splash of stock and poured that into the chili. Super easy and really good!

Chef John, you've done it again. Made the recipe exactly as directed with the only variation being leaving 1/2 the jalapeno seeds in . It has so much flavor and is really nice on a cold evening to warm you up all over. We enjoyed it, as always. Another one for the recipe book. Thanks Chef John!

It was easier than I thought it would be. A little spicy but so delicious! You know it's good when my husband says its definitely a repeat!We paired it with tortilla chips but next time I'll make cornbread to go with it. Also adding avocado to it was a great idea!

It was easy and delicious. The flavors were perfect. I only used 1 1/2 lbs poultry because that is what I had and it was more than enough with the beans. I will definitely be making this again!

Chili is very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  My only negative, and I am knit picking, is that it was a little too thick.  But I put the beans in too early, so that could have been my fault.  Also a very flexible recipe, I had to do some spice subs and it was still fantastic.

I have made this twice now and it is delicious! I do cook my own beans because it's cheaper and I like to make sure all components of the chili are flavorful, but by god I had been making white chili for years and I don't think I ever will again, green chili is the way to go

I thought this was really good.  Easy to make and I'd recommend using the thighs versus breasts b/c the meat was moist and tender and I think a breast would be dry.  My kids were suspicious of the green color of the soup and unfortunately, couldn't get over it.  Nonetheless, my husband and I really liked the soup and was good with a bit of sour cream and some crushed tortilla chips over top.

Delicious but  I knew it would be too spicy (even without the jalapeno) for my kids so I added some chicken broth to the pot and a dollop of sour cream to each bowl. They all liked it.

Tasted too salty, so I added a bit of lemon juice. It was a bit too spicy, so I added a can of low sodium chicken broth. I served it the next day, when the flavor had mellowed a bit (over rice).

Delicious and forgiving of my mistakes and shortcuts. I used pulled chicken and accidentally opened a can of chickpeas instead of the white kidney beans. It’s still fabulous!
