This was easy and tasty.  I made individual cakes using cupcake tins with liners.  I also used flour as a substitute for corn starch.
I baked it at 350* in a regular oven for about 20 minutes.  It made 48 little cakes, there were  5 people home that weekend and all the cakes were eaten

Used conventional oven, used a springform pan, created an almond crust and replaced the granulated sugar in mix with confectioners sugar. Cooked at 350F for 30 minutes. While slightly jiggly in center, refrigerated for 4 hours to stiffen. The cheesecake came out extremely smooth and didn’t crack as typical with some cream cheese cakes. Tasted well and like a cannoli so plated with a raspberry coulis on the side. A great holiday cheesecake with a great smooth texture.

It wasn’t that good. I made it in my 1400 watt Airfryer and this recipe was made in 1450 watt one. I adjusted cook time but it could have been better

This has a delicious flavor and is super easy to make. The cornstarch gives it an odd texture though. I will try tapioca starch or potato starch next time. I made this at 7,000ft altitude and it cooked exactly in the time stated. I used a Philips HD9620.
