Wow!!! So good! I will admit I don't know what Anaheim chili peppers are and they didn't have any at the grocery store so I used jalapenos. Also since I was using jalapenos and cilantro lime juice seemed like a better option than lemon juice but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Incredible flavor the perfect amount of spice. I would have happily paid for these in a restaurant! Thank you so much for the recipe this is going permanently in my dinner rotation.

It was a great fresh easy to make meal. Will be a great summertime dinner. Made it just like the recipe called for. Was wonderful.

I'd just come home from the store with a little bit of cooked shrimp intending to throw it on top of a salad for lunch. I prepared this recipe and just tossed the shrimp in at the end to warm them up and WOW! Best salad EVER! Didn't need any other dressing but the EVOO I used to cook the peppers & garlic. I didn't have seasoned salt so I used a mix called "Vegetable Supreme" by McCormick and left everything else the same. Delicious!

We really enjoyed this. I was not sure about the Anaheim Green Chili (by the way they are a very mild green chilies) but they were really good in this. I followed the directions with one exception - once the shrimp were done I removed them from the pan and allowed the sauce to reduce a bit to thicken up. Excellent dish and really quick too.

Used wild caught shrimp doubled the garlic then added crushed red pepper flakes (didn't have the chile peppers). Put the shrimp mixture on toasted French Bread with Olive oil and Garlic Powder. Wow was this good. This is a Five Star Recipe. Thanks Mrs. Jennifer for sharing the recipe.

I made this recipe basically as described but I replaced cilantro with lettuce the chile pepper with a quarter of a green bell pepper and added swiss cheese and ginger. What a tasty fresh treat! The lemon juice might be too much for someone who doesn't like lemons very much but that person is not me.

This was excellent. I served over rice as opposed to on a sandwich but it was absolutely scrumptious!

I did like this recipe; next time I make it I will need to find some sort of creamy mayo to slather on the bread. I will make it again! Thanks!
