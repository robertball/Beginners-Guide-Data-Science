My husband liked these, but I was hoping for more of a "pina colada" flavor. I'll try this recipe again, maybe with more pineapple juice or something, maybe less half/half.

Made as is minus pineapple because wanted to get traditional flavor of coconut paletas . This recipe does not disappoint. Taste same if not better than the ones sold out of carts. Surprised there are not more reviews. Such a great recipe. Will make again and again thru out summertime.

I just put all of the ingredients in the blender together.  I really enjoy these but next time I'm going to cut the sweetened condensed milk by half because the flavour of it stood out a bit too much for my taste.

These were a delicious dessert with very little effort involved. The coconut floated to the top of the pops, but that's fine. There as much more than I could use to fill 7 molds, but that depends on the size of your ice pop molds. I will make this again. Thanks!

I was finally able to make this and it was very good.  I didn't have any problem making it and I used all the ingredients listed.  For me it almost tasted like an almond joy without the nuts and chocolate.  Going to make it again.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely delish! I did not have a can of sweetened condensed milk so I made my own. The SCM came out a little runny so I wonder if the Paleta mixture was affected because of it.  Final product (before freezing) was rather soupy, plus the coconut and pineapple wanted to rise to the top. I went ahead and gave 5 stars because it was easy to make and tasted absolutly divine! Truely reminded of Mexican Paletas.  I might make again but I prefer not to use SCM from a can. So if I do, then I will just make my own again or try another recipe without SCM.   Thanks for sharing this!

This recipe was ok...the sweetened condensed milk taste definitely stood out so next time i'll try cutting it in half and maybe replacing some of it with water but other than that it was good.

Wow!  What a hit, even with friends who grew up on this type of Popsicle!  The flavor was nice and light, not overpowering, and super easy to make!
