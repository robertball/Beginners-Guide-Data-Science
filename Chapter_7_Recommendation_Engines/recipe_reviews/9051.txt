This is the best lemon chicken recipe I've tried.
My husband likes to order lemon chicken at restaurants and he thinks this recipe is great! I added a couple of tablespoons of flour to the batter recipe so that it would adhere better to the chicken. I also left the breasts whole. Very delicious! This one's a keeper!

This is a tempura style lemon chicken that is surprisingly similar to a famous Chinese restaurant in Dallas.  The sweet lemon sauce goes perfectly with the lightly fried chicken and goes great with steamed rice.

This was very good after a few small changes. I didn't add any extra salt to the marinade or the sauce. Cut the chicken into bite size pieces before you cook it. Also, I don't think you need extra oil in the sauce. I just mixed it all together, warmed it up a bit, and added the chicken and mixed it up. I will definitely be making this again, wonderful!

I'm pretty confused as to why this recipe is getting such excellent ratings. I order lemon chicken quite a bit at Chinese restaurants, and this recipe doesn't come out as expected. I made the recipe, without any changes, and was disappointed. My chicken was edible, but not lemon chicken. As I suspected, the sherry in the marinade was too strong, overpowered the delicacy of the lemon, and was generally out of place in the recipe. The batter was lovely, but pretty unsuitable for the recipe, unless sauced very lightly at the last minute (anything else and such a light batter loses its crunch). Hence, the sauce should be made first, then fry the chicken and drizzle sauce over hot chicken. Lastly the sauce was lovely, but other reviewers are right, the lemons shouldn't be added until the last minute. I'll definitely make this recipe again, but this time with changes.

Really tasty! I added about a tablespoon more of each lemon juice and cornstarch. I cut up some large pieces of ginger to steep in the sauce while it was warming through and I also used some lemon marmalade I made earlier this year instead of the cut up fresh lemon. Everyone really liked it. The flavor of the chicken was right on and with the sauce it was just wonderful.

This sauce was tasty & easy.  I used Splenda, and will add more lemon juice next time.  I also added a couple of drops of yellow food coloring. I used my standard breading method: flour, than egg, than panko (panko is great-found in Asian food section}, put in refigerator for about an hour after breading.

Great and easy recipe.  I did not use nearly as much oil as suggested.  I just put 2 tbsp of olive oil to coat the wok and then stir fried the chicken.  It came out great and  probably not nearly as fattening.  Thanks for a very tasty recipe.

This recipe was great with a couple little changes. First I zested the lemon and added the zest to the sauce for a stronger lemon flavor. Also the batter needs to be thickened a bit. I also cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It tastes just like a lemon chicken dish that my brother loved when we lived in Hawaii. He passed away 11 years ago and I have been looking for a recipe that resembled it. While I was making this, I knew it was the one by the smell and look of the sauce and immediately got choked up and called my family and sent them the recipe. It tastes wonderful, I wouldn't change a thing!! Thanks again.

I would give this 6 starts if I could, my DH said it is his favourite recipe.  I did make this early in the day while DD was sleeping and heated it up before dinner, and I only used the lemon juice not slices.  I served this with green beans and rice.

The batter was very thin, barely coating the chicken pieces.  The sauce was great, though I recommend adding the lemon slices after thickening and not before.  I will make the sauce again but will look around for a better batter recipe.

The batter was awful - next time I make this I'd use a different batter - I would also pound the chicken breasts out a litte thinner. The sauce was very good and very easy to make - I added more lemon juice than the recipe called for as I like LOTS of lemon flavor. If we could give 1/2 stars this would be a 3 1/2 - the one has lots of potential!

This is a good recipe but I made a couple of changes. First, instead of sherry I recommend using mirin, rice wine or even just a dry white wine for the marinade. 

For the sauce start by sauteing garlic and ginger in oil. Deglaze the pan with wine and add the rest of the ingredients. I also used the juice of two whole lemons. Pour the sauce over the chicken just before serving. Turned out really well.

I read reviews before starting recipe. I cut and marinated chicken before cooking. Based on other reviews, I did not add salt to marinating chicken. I used about 3/4 to 1 cup oil in a cast iron skillet and cooked in batches, held in the oven at 150 until all was done. I poured sauce over chicken before serving as suggested by one reviewer but sauce did not penetrate coating enough. Next time, I will do as original recipe suggests and toss chicken and sauce together before serving.

Overall an excellent recipe that you can play with. I'm going to try it with my homemade General Tsao sauce.

The batter was fabulous and not sure why another reviewer found batter too delicate. This was just like a good Chinese buffet. I added lemon zest and doubled lemon in sauce. 

This meal was devoured by all. It got a suburb rating from both 8 yo son and DH. I did find that I had to salt the meal when eating and would salt chicken while marinating when I do this recipe again this week. Would have given 5 stars but chicken should be cut before cooking to maximize batter coating and flavor!

This is one of my fav. dishes to cook. My whole family on my mother and father sides LOVE it. This is very sweet, and the sauce is RICH. I sliced some lemmon soaked it in my sugar to get rid of the tardy then placed it with the chicken. Serve this on top of some fried rice with carrots, and it's the perfect Asian meal. Didn't have any Sherry to cook with, but plan on buying some. If your sauce doesn't turn out thick enough, just simply add a touch more cornstarch after it comes to a boil. I also battered my chicken with tempra for a more authentic taste. Had to buy it from the Asian market.

This is a great recipe.  The only change I made was to add fresh lemon zest.  After tasting it I thought it could use a little more zing that the zest provides.  The tempura chicken is very delicate and the sauce is perfect as neither overpowers the other.  I served it with stir fried Manderan style veggies.

Instead of pouring the Lemon sauce mix over the chicken, dumped the chicken pieces into the sauce mix as it began to thicken. Just as good result, this way the chicken is well covered and the sauce gets absorbed a little.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe. Everyone said they didn't like the batter so I did my own, flour with lemon pepper seasoning. I marinated the chicken in 3 Tbs. soy sauce, 1 tsp. sherry, 1 tsp. ginger root, and 2 tsp. lemon zest. Also, I thought the sauce should have been sweeter, like orange sauce, but for lemon, so I added juice from 2 lemons, and added a lot of sugar, like 2/3 cup. When the chicken was done frying, I tossed it in a large mixing bowl with the sauce and some lemon slices, it was seriously good, my husband told me this recipe was a keeper, thanks for the great idea, sorry I made so many changes to this recipe...

Delicious but omit the extra salt. With the chicken broth and the soy sauce there is no need for extra salt. The salt made mine way too salty. Other than that it was good. I am going to try the same techniques and use oranges and orange juice and make orange chicken.

Here is a tip for those of you who said the batter didn't stick to your chicken.  Try cooking the chicken in batches and keeping it warm in the oven on a cooking rack in a cookie sheet pan when done frying.  You can't crowd the pan or the oil temp drops too much and it's a mess. I don't keep alcohol on hand, so I just added rice vinager in place of the sherry.  I also found that adding more sugar to the sauce made it taste more like the lemon chicken that is served at Pick-up Sticks (fast food Chinese chain), though it was fine as is. With the additional sugar, my husband and I loved it!

This is a full five start elegant lemon chicken recipe. Very easy to make! I loved spooning some of the lemon sauce over my rice too. I may even just make the lemon sauce in the future to use for rice. My batter didn't stick to the chicken really well and a lot of it fried and came off in the oil, but that was okay. When the chicken was close to brown, I cut the chicken with my spatula in the pain. I scooped all of the chicken out of the pain and let rest on a paper towel while I got rid of the oil and extra crusted batter. I put the chicken back in the pan and poured the lemon sauce over and let it heat for about 10 minutes before serving. My picky husband really liked this, it is a keeper.

i didnt follow through with the batter but i did make the Lemon sauce...just a note, taste your sauce when it thickens if it isnt @ your desired flavor then add more of whatever it lacks.. i didnt have white sugar so i used Brown instead and used about 4-6 table spoons as well as 3-4 tables spoons of lemon juice ( didnt have real lemons)i also didn have chicken stock so i had to disolve chicken stock powder into a cup of hot water. all in all this is a good recipe! thank you for sharing!

This was wonderful! The whole family loved it. I made the following changes based on suggestions from other reviews: added no salt, cut chicken into smaller pieces before cooking, and added a small amount of flour to batter. I also made these changes on my own: added about 1 tsp of lemon pepper to the marinade and doubled batter

This was a yummy dish.  The sauce adds a nice sweet lemon flavor.  Although, I think I should have cooked the sauce a bit longer so it would get thicker.  Good for the whole family!

An excellent intro to lemon chicken. I served it over vegetable fried rice. Definitely one to revisit.
Another reviewer complained of the batter getting soggy,so I sauced at the very last possible minute. Additionally, I reduced the sherry by half so as not to elbow out the lemon flavor. I also cut my chicken into bite size pieces prior to marinading and battering. It came out really pretty and delicious.

Good recipe with very good sauce. I give it 3 stars because as written, it's just OK. After making it a few times, I now saute the chicken (rather than deep fry) for a healthier dish, and add the sauce to the chicken for a final few minutes of cooking. This coats the chicken more evenly and pulls the dish together.

I've made this several times now, and I always look forward to the meal! Sliced green bell peppers or red onions give it added color. The only change I make is that I add as little salt as possible - the soy sauce adds plenty by itself. I use low-sodium chicken broth, OR just water with a little salt.

So completely wonderful! I am an American girl living in the UK and crave all things American so this recipe was such a blessing. I thought it might be hard to make but it was so simple and absolutely delicious, even if I was in America I would still make this recipe it's that good! A keeper for sure!

The batter didn't stick to the chicken at all--I ended up with little bits of burnt batter pieces and bare chicken breasts after cooking.  I think it would have been good had the batter stuck.  The sauce was pretty good, although I didn't let it cook long enough and it came out too thin--I'd suggest not rushing the sauce.

The was really good.  The batter was amazing. I omitted the salt and next time I will add a little more sugar.  Makes a very pretty dish!  Also, I used frozen, boneless, skinless, chicken tenderloins and they were the perfect size...didn't have to cut them up until they were on the dinner plate.

i found the batter to be too liquidy and the lemon sauce was awful with that chicken broth added and i had to add more lemon juice and sugar to bring up the lemon taste.

This one took a little bit more work.  It is a good one for a weekend dinner due to the time.  I used my deep fryer instead of a wok to cook the chicken.  I did not have a lemon so just used the juice, I should have increased the amount of the lemon juice in place of the slices because did not have ANY lemon flavor at all.  Word of warning be very careful when you are pouring the sauce in to the wok or skillet due to hot oil and cool liquid.  All in all it was a dinner dish just more time that I wanted to take for dinner.

This was great. Husband loved it, preschooler said it was so yummie. I only changed two things. 1) didn't add the sherry, because i didn't have any, thought i could try some white wine, but could not find the bottle opener. 2) Did not put oil in the lemon sauce, it definetly did not need it.
Sauce was so good, i am not a big fan of soy sauce, but i only marinated for about 10 min, the flavor of the soy sauce was not over powering, oh also didn't put in the extra salt with the soy sauce. Will make again, next time with some sherry or white wine.

This was a good recipe and one I will make again. It may even keep my husband from going out for Chinese! I did make a few changes. I cut up chicken into strips, coated and fried. I added a tsp of fresh minced ginger and increased lemon juice to 5 Tablespoons. I stirred all the ingredients in a pot and heated to low simmer for 4 minutes.

Fantastic recipe! Fairly simple to make but lots of dishes to do. I did follow someone elses suggestion and doubled the corn starch and lemon juice for the sauce. I used 3 chicken breasts and followed everything else and it was enough for 2 people. If you are going to serve 6 I would triple the sauce. I also added the lemons at the end.

I have been to plaenty of chinese restaurants in LA, SF, Phoenix, etc., and this is as good as it gets.  The marinade is a great idea that although subtle, really adds to the overall flavor.  Excellent.

I like the idea of this recipe, but it didn't turn out for me. First, I changed the batter (cup of flour, one egg, enough cold water to make it runny) and that was good. I cut my chicken up before I battered it and fried it. I served it on spaghetti noodles that were tossed with a little sesame oil so they wouldn't stick. That was the good part of the meal...the sauce didn't taste good. I did not like the salty taste of the broth with the sweet taste of the sugar...and it never thickened for me. But again, I like the idea.

WOW!  Certainly the best chicken recipe I've found so far.  On my first try, I made chicken so mouthwatering that my roommates were begging for more!  Two recommendations:  make more sauce (trust me, it's worth it), and cut them into bite size pieces BEFORE you put them in the batter.  Excellent recipe!

The is a great recipe!!!! The batter cooked up like the delicate "tempura" at my favorite restaurant.
Next time I will try cutting the chicken in strips "before" frying because it seemed to take too long for chicken to cook thoroughly.

I didn't care for the chicken batter, it didn't stay crunchy, next time I will make my own batter, but the sauce is very good, I feel like the sauce is missing a little something to make it exactly like the restaurant style... I just can't put my finger on it... otherwise very good, my friends/family raved..

This recipe is very similiar to my favorite oriental restraunt.  Following their lead, I cut my chicken into bite-sized pieces prior to marinating, breading and frying.  I used much less sugar in the lemon sauce and added pineapple tidbits and mandarin oranges (both drained).  I steamed broccoli flowers, red pepper strips, julienned carrots and zucchini slices.  We layered rice, chicken and the vegetables on our plates and topped with the sauce.  Yum!  I will be making this again.

Made this vegetarian using Quorn tenders (chicken-like bites).  Skipped the breading, and added a little soy sauce to the lemon sauce.  I added extra lemon juice, and it was still a little too sweet for us.  But otherwise a very good recipe.  Will surely make again, using less sugar.

Used just the sauce recipe and halved it. Followed it except I added the lemon juice at the end per another reviewer. I added about 1 lemons worth on a half recipe. Needed just a touch more, or maybe some lemon zest next time.

My husband LOVED this lemon chicken! I added a coating of Panko bread crumbs on top of the thin egg/cornstarch mixture, which gave them a nice crunch. I also used bottled lemon juice and suspect it would have an even better flavor if I used fresh squeezed lemons. Oh yes, and there is no need to make the sauce in the wok after your chicken, I made it on the side in a saucepan while I was cooking the chicken-- that way they were ready at the same time!

I liked the recipe. Yes there was a problem with the batter staying on the chicken, but that could be caused by the heat of the oil.  I probably would make smaller pieces of chicken.  The lemon sauce was great and I can't wait to try my Meyer Lemon in this recipe. I made the recipe for 6 and there were 3 of us and no left overs.  Everyone had ideas about using the lemon sauce for other things also. I would definitely make this again.

The lemon sauce is by far the best I have ever tasted. The only reason why I am only giving this four stars is because the recipe  should not include the marinade. The marinade completely overpowered the lemon sauce. Please forget the marinade and you will agree that this is the best lemon chicken.

ok, sorry, maybe it's me.  The batter didn't stick and made just clumps of batter in the wok.  I had to add another tablespoon of corn starch to make it anything like a sauce.  The chicken with it's marinade tasted weird.  I don't think i'll even bother trying again.

This recipes is as close as I've gotten to a good chinese resteraunts version.  Make sure you add the sugar.  I was half-way through the bitter meal, when it clicked that I'd forgotten a vital ingredient.  I am so glad, or else this would have got a bad review.

What a excellent recipe! My Autistic son, who is a picky eater loved it and wanted me to make it the more. The only thing I would do different is cut the pieces before instead of after the are cooked. I added a little bit more cornstarch to the sauce to make it a little thicker per my taste. I am going to make it again in a couple of days.  This is now in my top ten! I am going to recommend this recipe to family and friends!

Very delicious!  I took someones advice and served it with broccoli and peppers.  I've never had it in a chinese resteraunt, so I'm not sure if it's on target or not, but it was resteraunt worthy.  My chicken also didn't stay crispy, but it was delicious all the same.

Really liked the sauce.  I thought it was just like the restaurants.  I added the lemon slices to the sauce a few minutes before serving so that it would not get bitter.

I don't know why the last reviewers had problems with this recipe. I enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes and consider myself an accomplished cook. I've made this recipe many times and thought it was delicious every time. I will never look for another lemon chicken recipe now that I've found this one.

The actual batter on this chicken was fine - I had a problem with the lemon sauce, though.  I sliced up the lemon thinly and only used 1/2(with the rind on).  The sauce had a terribly bitter taste - we couldn't even use it because the rind gave it such a strong taste.  Maybe it would have been okay if I had peeled the lemon first.  Not really worth the effort!

We have been trying to find a lemon chicken that compares with resturant and this one is very good.  We thought it needed a little bit more sugar, so we added 1/2 c and it tasted even better!

love lemon chicken and love this recipe after a few changes. 
I left out the sherry and soy sauce and added the juice of two fresh lemons for the sauce adding a couple of lemon slices at the end .
The batter is light and is just the job easy to make and sticks to the chicken.
So there it is give it a go you won't be disappointed

For me as a quick fire chef this recipe takes quick a bit of prep time and cook time. So I don't make it very often, but when I do everyone loves it. And they're always looking for seconds.

I just made the chicken but didn't like how grainy it tasted. Perhaps I left a step out or something. Used the Sweet and Sour sauce I made instead. The family loved it.

My husband and I both LOVED it.  The only drawback for us was too much salt in the sauce.  Our remedy for that is less salt in the sauce!
PS: Batter is great on fried zucchini chips!

I really wanted to like the recipe, but it was a disaster. The coating didn't stay on the chicken when fried. I had to add a little flour to the batter to make it thicker. The sauce was not even edible. I ended up having to start from scratch and create my own recipe for the sauce.

This was good, I added flour to the batter to thicken as per one reviewer. Kids loved the chicken, not the sauce as much. I thought it was good, would have preferred a bit more tang-more lemon....

This is a very easy recipe and a little tasty. The lemon sause is a little runny and thin. I think next time I will use some honey to thicken it up a little. I will be making it again. I paired it with fried rice and an egg roll.

I have never had this dish from a restaurant so I can not speak to how well it compares. However, it is very tasty indeed and enjoyed by the whole family.

Used masa harina flour instead of corn starch for the batter and increased amount of batter.   Used the Fry Daddy instead of the wok.  Served with rice.

My husband told me to rate this one five stars!!!  This recipe was a hit. He sat in the kitchen and tasted the chicken as I was frying it.  I had a family size pack of chicken so I did double the recipe. I also followed another writer's suggestion and added a couple of drops of yellow food coloring as I feel we eat with our eyes before our mouths. The only thing that I might do different next time (there will be a next time) is sweeten the sauce a little more. I kept the sauce and the chicken separate as I knew there would be leftovers and I did not want the chicken to get soggy.

The chicken tasted of cornstarch, and the sauce was extremely bland. I will not make this one again.

After reading the reviews, I made 2 alterations. I replaced the sherry with Sake, and dredged the chicken pieces in flour before dipping them in the batter.

Didnt like the batter or sauce, batter soft spongy thin, sauce missing on the simple  lemon flavour,  thats really entire purpose of the recipe...imo. Sauce I stripped down to just fresh  lemon juice, small peice lemon rind, cornstarch, broth/water, sugar..no frying, thickened clear, tripled quantity...minus 1 or all egg to make stickier crispy batter.

The chicken was perfect the sauce was perfect also. One change I made and is a must is; add green onions to your rice and let it form and cook with those in the rice.

This is one of our favorites!  We cut the chicken before we coat and fry it in our turkey fryer. Other than that and maybe doubling the lemon sauce, we make as in. I have also just made the sauce and put it on grilled chicken when I don't want to pull out the fryer.

I made this with my 6 & 8 year olds.  We all loved it!  We didn't put in the lemon rind and actually, next time, we will just juice the lemon instead of cutting it up.  Thanks for sharing!

I agree with other reviewers--this is a good base, but needs a little tweaking. Next time I will not add salt to the sauce (it was REALLY salty--I think the chicken broth would provide enough) and will add more lemon. The batter could also use more crunch...flour maybe? I'll make again, but with the alterations.

Loved it! The batter for the chicken is perfect. I added a little extra lemon to the sauce because I like it tarter. Rave reviews from my family. We will make this one again for sure!

I substituted oranges for the lemons. I added a T of juice to the marinade and put the remainder in the sauce. I used only about 2 T sugar in the sauce as well since it was orange juice and not lemon. Even so, it wasn't very orange-y. I think it was the chicken broth, perhaps plain water (and less of it) would have helped; perhaps even the addition of some lemon juice to boost the citrus taste.

Wow!  I cut it down to 1lb but kept the measurements pretty much the same.  Added a little lemon-pepper seasoning to the batter.  Cut it into bite size pieces before marinading.  I think this may test better on chicken finger-style cuts because it won't overcook as easily as the bitesize pieces to.  But... DELICIOUS!

I thought this was a little too much trouble and not good at all.  I tried to follow recipe exactly.  My husband said it was "okay, but not good".  It had a strange flavor that I could not quite make out.  I will not attempt this again.  Thanks, but no thanks.

Dont add the extra salt to the recipe for the sauce. I added a bit of vinegar, like 1 tbsp, and extra lemon juice, and it tasted a lot better. Also, the batter doesn't come out crispy at all, but it still tastes good.

I liked it.  My husband hated it.  I've honestly never seen him NOT finish a meal for the most part.  He's not a picky eater.  I guess this did have a funny tang.  BUT I finished it, so I'll give it 3 stars for that. ;)

Very good, the sauce is really nice and not sour at all. The flavor of the lemon juice is very light but you can't miss it. Make sure you soak the chicken on paper towels after you take it out of the oil!

Totally yummy, comparable to take-out!  Like many other reviewers, I cut the chicken before the marinade.  I also made extra sauce and served it over angelhair pasta.  To get the chicken crispy I fried it in the 2 cups of oil til medium golden brown- it was perfect!  The sauce was a little bitter- next time I'm going to put the lemons in the last minute or two instead of the full cooking time.

Highly recommended!!! I love lemon chicken, it's my absolute favorite when i have chinese... Didn't have any dry sherry, so I just skipped it. It still turned out quite well.
