I have made this recipe for 30 yrs but only use 1 cup raisins, 2 cups candied fruit, 1/2 cup red candied cherries and 1/2 cup green candied cherries. I also put all the fruit in a bowl and cover with crushed pineapple, then cover and let stand overnight. Next morning mix other ingredients and fold into fruit mixture. I like baking in smaller pans so I can share with friends.
