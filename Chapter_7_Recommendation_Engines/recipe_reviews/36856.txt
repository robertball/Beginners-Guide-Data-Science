Great flavor, but I recommend using mushrooms instead of water chestnuts--they are not a traditional thai ingredient and they break easily when you try to skewer them.

Delicious!   I wanted to try this but don't have a grill so I made it as sort of a stew instead by simply adding three tablespoons of water and letting it cook in a pot for 30 minutes on low.

This was soooo delicious. I served these to my neighbor who is from Thailand and she thought it was very good as well.The water chestnuts break in half when you try to put them on the stick, so I used a toothpick to make a hole in them first so they wouldn't break.

I found that the peanut butter marinade/sauce was lacking in any complex flavors. Very bland for a Thai recipe.

WOW~  I loved this recipe!!!!  I thought that chunky peanut butter sounded a bit strange for a marinade but I was so glad that I went ahead and used it. The peanut chunks tasted great and made these kabobs look very impressive. The combination of ingredients and flavors in this is exceptional. Next time I will double the recipe.  This is a new family favorite!!! Thanks for this great recipe.

Oh my gosh, these were wonderful!!! I added 1.5 times the sauce ingrediants, except for the cayenne which I doubled. I didn't have coriander so I added 3 tbsp. of fresh chopped cilantro. I marinated these for about 7 hours. I didn't add waterchest nuts either because I didn't have any. The flavor of these is perfect!

Great flavor and a great weeknight meal.  I'll definitely make these sometime again.  My only complaint is that the water chestnuts broke almost every time I tried to skewer them, so I'd skip them next time around.

This just did not work.  Try the Chicken satay from this site form the All Recipes cook book.  Don't waste your time on this one.  Followed recipe exactly (checked it many time, thought I did something wrong)  Not enough liquid to boil remainging sauce.  I had to add extra soy sauce.  I am going to stop trying to find a good peanut sauce and stick with the chicken one I previously mentioned.

My husband went CRAZY over these. They were pretty tasty and easy to make, the only reccommendation I have is to up the cayenne a bit. Nummy stuff! A keeper.

I made this for a big Mother's Day dinner party! I marinated the meat in the thick pasty mixture for about 4-6 hours. We threaded the meat onto skewers alternated onion, pepper, mushrooms and pineapple. Everyone raved about how wonderful it tasted. It was perfect! I served it with roasted red potatoes and fresh vegetables, and an Asian style salad with the toasted Ramen noodles. It was one of my best dinner parties yet!

This was excellent!  Wonderful flavor.  I added mushrooms and tomatoes to the kebabs.  Next time I plan to try the sauce with chicken.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

This was really good and pretty easy.  I didn't have a lemon, but I substituted lime, which was fine.  Also, I couldn't get the water chestnuts to stay on the skewers, but that added entertainment value.

We love this recipe, my husband makes it.  He says: do what everyone else says and double it!  Hard to get the veggies on the sticks w/o breaking(mushrooms espcially) but still it's so good and makes great for left overs.

Make sure you double the sauce so you have extra to boil down. I marinaded the meat for about an hour and that was not enough time. I did however like the sauce, it was what I dipped the pork into after I grilled it. I will not be making the recipe again, however I will find a way to incorporate the sauce into another recipe.

So yummy! I didn't have any green onion or ground coriander. I added some leftover teriyaki sauce and just used pork (no veggies). Also, I did not make the sauce (don't care to reuse marinades like that). Still, it was so delicious, flavourful and tender. Next time, I will try it with the veggies. Great recipe!

This recipe was a big hit. I used chicken instead of pork, and the flavors were still great. I've made these three times, and they've turned out wonderfully each time. I also used chopped cilantro instead of the coriandor seeds.

Very good flavor. Pork came out very tender. Its quick to burn though, probably cause of the peanut butter so be careful. I think next time i will thin out the marinade with some coconut milk. The marinade is really pastey and a wee bit to peanut buttery. I opened up a can of water chestnuts but could not get them on the skewer with out breaking! Oh well.

Very good!  The flavour of the pork is incredible!  Careful not to over cook on the BBQ, as it can dry out really quickly. Thanks!

yum. my eight year old stated this was the best kind of meat he ever had on a bbq. Oh, and did I state he does not like pork. Also, we had no corriander seed, so I just chopped up a handful of cilantro to get the flavor

I didn't make this recipe exactly as instructed. 
I didn't do the veggies. I just marinated strips of pork, threaded them on skewers, then grilled them. 
It tasted very good. I think I might try it again with a peanut dipping sauce on the side.

Marinated in a foodsaver bag for several days in the marinating ingredients. The chestnuts were hard to skewer. I didn't have a red pepper, so I only used a green pepper. There was not enough marinade to heat up, so I made the marinade again, minus the green onions. It had good flavor. We ate it with some leftover Thai Noodle that we made the night before (recipe found on allrecipes.com).

This was an absolute hit with me and my boyfriend. I served the kabobs over a bed of white rice and I omitted the water chestnuts since they just fell apart while trying to stick them. Overall it was an amazing dinner and the sauce/marinade is what makes it

It wasn't bad just bland.  I was hoping the sauce would be more robust/flavorful considering it was Thai.

I thought this was great ~ even my kids snarfed it up!  I was late getting dinner together, so I didn't have time to marinade, just brushed the sauce onto the skewers & threw them on the grill.  I did add a tablespoon of Chinese Cooking Wine to the sauce, and I didn't have green onions on hand.  I'll try marinating it next time, but it was still great.  I skipped the veggies (only because my kids would've freaked if peppers touched thier meat!).  Outstanding, easy dinner, especially for those nights when you need something quick.

There is not enough marinade left to boil down for a sauce to brush on bbq-ing meat!  That said, the meat had little flavor (and we marinated pieces for 3 days!).  Served with thai sesame noodles and green beans.

This recipe was a huge hit at our house.  I have made both pork and chicken satay before using another recipe from this site that requires you use roasted peanuts and a food processor.  This recipe is so much easier and just as tasty.  I maranated the pork for about six hours and couldn't have been happier with the results.  My 4 year old love it as did my husband.  I will be throwing away my old satay recipe for sure.

I cooked them on the stove top instead and didn't skewer them. More like a stir-fry. It was delicious. The peanut sauce was good although I reduced the brown sugar by a tad as we don't like peanut sauce being too sweet. Something I will make again for sure - stir-fry or grilled!

This was wonderful! I used summer squash in place of the water chestnuts since i had none. Watch how thick the sauce is. I thought is was a little thick and should have been a little thinner for the boiling step and basting. I think I'd thin it with more soy sauce or even water.

This recipe was excellent!  I followed it pretty much exactly, except I substituted fresh mushrooms for the water chestnuts, doubled the garlic and cayenne, and used smooth peanut butter.  I made vegetable fried rice as an accompaniment, was even better as a leftover the next day with some added peanut butter.  Thanks for sharing!

I used chicken instead of pork (just because I forgot that is what it called for). I used smooth instead of crunchy peanut butter which was fine, but crunchy probably would be better even better. I do not like water chesnuts so we used bok choy. Also, the recipe calls for using the peanut sauce marinade used on raw meat as a dipping sauce by bringing to a boil. We put some of the marinade (about 1/4 cup or so) aside before adding the raw chicken to be used for dipping sauce. Worked great!

Followed the Recipe exactly.  Found the Marinade pasty but had taste however I will give it a second try but add 1 Tbsp of Sesame Oil to the Marinade.  When boiling the leftover Marinade it started to burn in the pan.  I think with the addition of Sesame Oil this will illiminate the Pasty texture and burning. Also might add a little more of Authentic taste.

Very good but not really exciting.  Flavor is good and meat stays tender.  Water chestnuts kept breaking...  Probably could have gotten similar flavor cooking it all in a pan.

We really liked the flavors used in the marinade and thought the peanut butter, ginger, & coriander were a nice complement to the pork.   I did have problems with the water chestnuts as others did.  Every time I tried to add one to the skewers they broke in half.   I would recommend just leaving them off.

Carmelize or saute your onion and it's even better!  So easy for camping.  Easy make ahead.  Have extra water chestnut as half of them broke even when using the toothpick method.  Delicious.

I followed the recipe, but used zucchini instead of water chestnuts and chives instead of green onions. My husband preferred to use mustard instead of the peanut sauce.  I would serve this to guests in a heartbeat.

Yummmm- even our 2  yr old liked this!  a little labor but worth it as it can be done ahead and it is suppose to marinate. Think I will double next time so I will have extra and add a little more heat for the adults. Such a different taste and we all enjoyed that! So much cheaper and better than store bought!

VERY GOOD.  MARINATED OVERNIGHT AND GRILLED VEGGIES AND PORK ON SEPARATE SKEWERS.  USED 1 1/2" THICK PORK SIRLOIN CHOPS.  ADDED A TSP OF GINGER.  WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN.

We loved this recipe- it is very similar to a peanut chicken I do in a pan, served with rice or pasta (sons fav. is mini Farfale), anyhow I did add white vinegar to this, as it is in my other recipe, and it was a hit!!The pork was nice and tender, and we just used thick, cut up pork chop, AND were only able to marinate for about a hour and a half!
Thank you for this great recipe!

I didn't have enough pork, so I added shrimps. It was delicious.
