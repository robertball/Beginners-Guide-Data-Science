I do believe there is a "typo" - as regards the oven temperature.  I tried it at 350 degrees for an hour and it turned out great.  This is a good dish and you can any number of your favorites - any color bell pepper, bacon, more cheese or onion. etc.  Give it a try.  This is now my family's favorite potato side dish.

This recipe tasted fine, although it is not very visually appealing.  I would never serve it to guests.  The flour and cheese got a little lumpy.  The taste was good, very cheesey.  I will probably make again simply because it is so easy.  I also baked at 350 for a little over an hour.  I do not recommend putting any paprika on the top layer though, mine burned.

I was looking for a potatoe recipe yesterday for our dinner. I found this one and I have to say it was DELICIOUS! It is so easy and it turned out real cheesy. I have to admit, when I poured the milk in I was a bit concerned. I told my husband we were going to either have a potatoe casserole or potatoe soup. He said  soup would be fine!! It turned out great. Thank you for posting it. It is a keeper.

I have never made scalloped potatoes from scratch before - now I can't figure out why not.  This was an EASY recipe, which you can make to your liking.  I made 4 layers, with a different type of cheese in each layer.  I had something else in the oven, so cooked it at 350 degrees.  My husband had 4 helpings!  It turned out a little runny, so I will have to experiment to see if different types of cheese will help there, or more flour.  Regardless, this recipe is a keeper for me.

At 250, this took considerably longer than the hour in the recipe - total time in the oven was almost 2 hours.  I added about 1/2 of an onion finely chopped, and it was very good!

This was a great dish that I will definetly make again.  I changed it a little because I didn't have enough potatoes.  I added fresh green beans, zuchinni, mushrooms and onions in the layers and baked for an hour at 350.  It was tasty.

This recipie didn't rock my world as I expected from the other reviews.  It was cheesy enough.  I cooked it at 350, and I still didn't think it was cooked enough.  I ended up putting it in the microwave to finish it up quickly.

I don't know if it is a typo, but 1 hour at 250 F is not enough for this recipe. I tried it and it took at least 2 hours before I could put a fork in the potatoes. Try it at 350 F instead.

This took even longer than an hour in my oven.  Next time I will cover the potatoes and cook them on a higher temperature maybe 350.  Other than that they turned out really good!

I didn't have any hash browns so I diced up potatoes.  Cooked the casserole the same amount of time and it turned out great.  I also used sour cream and mayonnaise and a little mild cheddar cheese with the american. We like things a little spicier so I added some cayenne and garlic. I will definitely make it again.

I thought this was rather dry w/o a lot of taste.  I added a sprinkle of onions for extra taste too.  I will try again with modifications.

I'll try this again sometime.  As others recommended, I kicked up the oven temperature.  It looked as if it were done after 50 minutes, but the potatoes weren't soft all the way through.  It was decent, but not fabulous.  Beware--take a test bite before serving.  I was so sure it was done, I just served it.  My bad--I think this one has potential but even at it's best--I'm guessing is only a "4."

I liked this recipe. I shredded my cheddar and added all the flour, paprika, salt and pepper to the cheese. Then I just layered this mixture with the potatoes and poured a cup of milk over it, next time however, I will also add a 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. I baked mine at 375 in the middle of the oven for one hour.

Great dish! We baked at 350 as posts suggested. We also covered the top layer of potatoes with a coating of paprika (because we like it so much) and then covered that with the last layer of cheese. It was watery when baked in a two quart casserole so next time we may use a baking pan to cook off some of the excess moisture. This will be a regular side dish from now on! Thanks Sara!!

I liked this dish, but it didn't taste any different than au grautin potatoes.  It was too dry for scalloped potatoes and needed more seasoning.

Yes, baked at 350 for just over an hour. I also buttered the dish first, and added some dots of butter on top before baking. Easy and tasty, without a ton of ingredients.

We liked these well enough. They took a lot longer to cook than specified and I took others comments to cover and turn the heat to 350.  They were easy enough and just the right amount of cheese. I will make them again adding some seasoning to give them a flavor boost.

I made this recipe to go along with my family’s traditional New Year’s Day dinner. My mom recommended this recipe. I did 2 things differently than the recipe stated. First, I added 1 stick of butter chopped up divided between the layers. Second, I baked the casserole at 350 degrees for exactly one hour. The next time I make this recipe I will add onions and cover the dish for the first 45 minutes then uncover and add the paprika. I believe it will make this dish a little more visually appealing.

My family loves scalloped potatoes. I didn't use cheddar cheese, I used velveeta cheese, and also put chunks of ham in it. Definitely bake at 350 degrees. Tastes very good.

Had no flavor and the milk, cheese, and flour did cook well together when poured over potatoes.  Almost 2 hrs of cooking and the potatoes still were not cooked.

I wasn't very happy with how these turned out. There was very little flavor and even though I sliced the potatoes paper thin with my food processor, they still were undercooked after one hour at 350. I didn't want to keep cooking them because the top layer of cheese was burning.

I tried this recipe for Xmas Eve.  Bad idea.  I think the cheese, flour & milk should def. be combined/heated together before being poured onto the potatoes and baked, otherwise they do not mix properly on their own while baking.  Some potatoes had no sauce on them at all and the flour didn't get mixed in in spots.  It wasn't a disaster, it just wasn't that good, have a lot leftover, bad sign. Also, cooking this dish at 350 for 2 hours seems to be the right amt. of time at the correct temp.  I am going to try this again with adjustments.  This recipe has great potential!

Delicious and pretty easy! But bake at 350, NOT 250. That is definitely a typo.

I followed this recipe to a T. I cooked the dish for 90 minutes on 200 degrees celcius as the other cooks said that when they tried it was under cooked. I had to put the dish back into the oven because the dish was still under cooked. I put foil on the top for half an hour so that the cheese did not burn. My house mate told me later that it was still under cooked despite the fact I used a julliane. I am also sorry to say that this dish did not have any flavour. I used a really good cheese to make it to. I think it needs more work on it, such as. garlic herbs, or ingredients such as bacon or onions. You can choose whatever you like to make it better.
