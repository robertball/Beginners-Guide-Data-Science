Great recipe!  I used cornstarch instead of flour to make this gluten-free, a can of corn plus a half cup frozen corn instead of mixed veggies, and a whole tsp Sriracha sauce.  Loved it! It was not very spicy even with the additional Shiracha. I’d like more bacon (of course!) so I will double that next time.

Chowder was an excellent way to use up leftover turkey. Only change I made was to swap the siracha for white pepper and a dash of tabasco. Was very good and I will be making it again!

Very tasty.  Didn't have sriracha so just added minced garlic and sautéed with onions and added pinch of cayenne.  Also, avoiding extra wheat so omitted flour knowing it would be less thick - didn't take away from flavor. Will make again.

A little too thick for our tastes, but would make it again and just use less flour. We added shredded cheese as a garnish and that really made it great!

Good, simple, delicious.  I made it with corn since I didn't have other frozen veggies on had.

I used my Turkey carcass to make my own broth and then used a roux instead of the half & half mixture. The flavor is amazing. I really like this and will make again.

I used left over mashed potatoes instead.  My crew loved it.
