I used this recipe as a basis for a soup I made at work.. Didn't use lettuce or shrimp and instead added coconut milk making it "peach coconut curry" soup... It was pretty good, although next time I will omit the tomatoes, I feel that they are unneccessary.. Soup went over well though since it is so unique... Nice work :)

Excellent recipe! It's a little different (from what I normally eat). I asked my husband to surprise me and he made this. It's sweet and creamy. It's easy to make (though not quick as it simmers for a while) and relatively inexpensive. The only change we made was to skip the lettuce because we didn't have any. I didn't miss it. Next time I may serve this over rice.

I omitted the vegetable broth, the tomatoes and the lettuce. Added some milk and fresh ginger. Served this over noodles and it was a hit! Everybody loved it! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  Used fresh peaches, fresh ginger and a dozen large shrimp. Dropped the shrimp in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Used coconut milk in place of cream.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
The second time I used canned peaches instead of fresh and actually liked it better.
