I love this recipe!  I leave out the sherry, and instead of pouring the butter on top, I mix it with the cracker/poppyseed mix, then sprinkle on top.

I made this for a couple of friends and they both loved it.  I did make a lot of modifications to the recipe based on others suggestions, therefore it only gets 4 stars. I used the French Onion dip instead of sour cream, used chicken breasts rather than shredding it, used cream of mushroom soup and added fresh cut mushrooms.  I also used white wine instead of sherry b/c I had it on hand. Next time I would like to make up the mixture, let the chicken marinate in it over night and cook it on low heat so the chicken would be more moist.

This is an old family favorite in my house.  It was my favorite when I was little - and that says a lot because I was very picky.  I add the butter (I use low-fat and a little less) to the cracker mixture.  It's not so messy.  Also, I shred the chicken breasts after poaching.  Use judgement when spreading on the soup/sour cream mixture over the chicken-only use enough to cover the chicken.  Can use low-fat soup too.

this was really fantastic served over white rice. i added a little garlic and chilie powder when i cooked the chicken to spice it up a bit. then used half the sour cream and butter called for to reduce fat. yum

My family now requests this for every gathering.  It always turns out perfect, and is easily complimented by a variety of sidedishes.  I've used white wine with success when sherry wasn't handy.

This turned out to be great! My boyfriend absolutely loved it! I even made it ahead one night and it was great reheated. I omitted the sherry and I added: finely chopped celery, onion, fresh garlic, and blended it all in with sourcream/soup mix. I also added softened cream cheese and cooked egg noodles! All of the additions made this simple recipe 'gourmet'!

Ver easy and delicious.  You can use french onion dip in place of the sour cream- it adds more flavor.  Also, you can use different soups.  Cream of mushroom or celery work well.  This is one of my favorites.  I told people from work about it and they tried it and all love it too.  Also a bit hit with children.

This is my husbands FAVORITE dish, although I make a few changes to it.  I like it because it is so versitile and goof-proof!  I usually poach the chicken with some onion, celery and carrots for flavor, and use Wheatsworth crackers in the topping, processing them in a food processor with the butter and poppyseeds to make a sand-like topping that bakes together nicely.  I also mix the sauce with the chicken rather than spreading it on top of the chicken to keep the chicken nice and moist.  I also add leftover veggies (ie: peas, broccoli, carrots, etc) to the chicken mixture more often than not.  Its a good way to sneak in veggies since my hubby doesn't like to eat them plain!

This wasn't very good at all.  Neither my husband or I liked it, and we're pretty easy.  My 1-year-old picked at it, and my 3-year-old ate one bite and wouldn't touch any other food that came in contact with it.  It was a lot of work for the end result, and we won't be making it again.

This dish was good, nothing special -- but E-Z!  The  bigger breasts were not cooked through after 45 mins so I would say just bake for a full hour.  8 oz. of Ritz crackers?  According to a 14.5 oz. box, that's over half a box of crackers!  I think you can get away with much less than that.  The crackers absorbed most of the sauce so it was a bit dry, no sauce for the rice.  That may have interferred with the cooking of the chicken.  I left the breasts whole.

My husband LOVED this chicken.  Both my 2 and 4 year old kids also ate it very well.  It was easy.  The only thing I did different, was omit the sherry because I didn't have any.

Love this recipe! Sometimes I use Sherry, sometimes I leave it out, it's wonderful either way. I have used it over noodles and over rice, I prefer it over rice.

This is a fabulous dish. I have cooked it with whole chicken breasts (as opposed to diced)and then served atop rice. I have also used it as a casserole by cooking the  diced chicken, adding some of the sauce to the chicken, then cooking egg noodles and adding the rest of sauce to that. put egg noodles on bottom of pan, then adding the chicken , and top with the cracker mix and back. Both ways are great!

We LOVE this recipe! I use whole, boneless chicken breasts because it is faster and easier and I'm lazy. I have made this recipe several times and it is fabulous! My 16 year old daughter's best friend requests it every time she comes. A really family favorite. Thanks!!

I used cream of celery, based on previous reviews, to give this dish a little kick.  I also added a 10oz. package of frozen broccoli florets and substituted bread crumbs for cracker topping ( I was out of crackers)  I served this with white rice and it was wonderful.  I wish that I could say that my kids ate it but they wouldn't.  That's not to say anything bad about the recipe, sherry or not, they won't eat anything.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

We really liked this recipe.  You can put in raw chicken, just make sure it's cut up and bake for longer an a slightly lower temperature.  I will definitely make it again.

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and I also left out the sherry. (for my kids)  It was wonderful!  I'm going to next time leave the chicken breasts whole and maybe use even a different soup.  We loved it!

My husband asks me to make this every week! It is so easy, and very tasty.  It also reheats well for leftovers, and it halves well, if you are only cooking for a few.

Changes: 1 tbsp sherry, 20 ritz crackers, lite sour cream, 1/4 cup butter. With foil in place it wasn't heating, still barely warm after 30 mins! Therefore, leave uncovered. Soooo good!

I loved how this turned out!  I tried what some of the other reviewers suggested and used french onion dip and added about 1/2 onion and a cup of fresh mushrooms chopped up and substituted white wine for the sherry because that's what I had.  There is a restaurant here in town that makes this and I have been looking for a recipe that is just as good and now I have finally found it!  Thank you!

One of our favorite dishes of all time. I make it with both chicken tenderloins and chicken breasts.  I substitute low fat ingredients and you would never know.  I serve this dish over egg noodles and there are hardly ever a leftover! My 2 year old just loves it too.

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe. I thought it was really lacking in flavor, and I even added some dried onion to the mix. I added fresh broccoli as well, and don't think that was the best idea, it seemed to give it a weird aftertaste. I thought it had too much of a sour cream taste, maybe cutting back on that would help. Not sure, with some doctoring it could be better but I think I'll stick with other recipes.

This recipe has great potential.  A local caterer sells a poppyseed chicken dish from their take out case that I love.  This one is similar. I used the diced chicken instead of whole breasts.  I know the one I'm trying to copy has monterrey jack cheese in it so I added about two cups of shredded cheese when I made this recipe.  Next time I try it, I will cut back on the poppy seeds and try to make the consistency a little more "soupy" so it spoons over the rice better.  These are definitely the same ingredients so I will be experimenting to find the right combination to make it as good as the version I've bought.

I thought this recipe was a great deal of work.  My kids would not eat it and my husband and I thought the sauce was a little too rich.  It was fun to try, but I don't think I will make it again.

I really needed to doctor this recipe up, I added mushroom, thyme, onions, and some garlic salt.  Next time I will probably use cream of mushroom soup instead.  It was good, I put the chicken breast on top next time I will next time I think I will cube it.  I will make it again.  Thanks

I love this recipe!!! I left out the sherry as mentioned by another reviewer, and I too usually use a wholle chicken cooked in the crock pot rather than the breasts.  This is my husbands second favorite recipe, we eat it over cooked rice.  Everyone I serve this too asks for the recipe.  Well done!

Very good, family-pleasing meal that's so easy to prepare ahead of time, so all you need to do is pop it in the oven. This is a regular dish at home!

Pretty good.  I used my own condensed cream of mushroom soup from scratch (you can find the recipe in my recipe box) and did not dice the chicken breasts.  I tossed the cracker crumbs and poppy seeds with only 1/4 cup butter.  Served it over angel hair pasta.  I couldn't really taste the sherry, so I would double it next time.

Very tasty; One of the few that don't require precooking the chicken. Also works using fat-free and low fat substitutes.

This was such a good comfort food meal for the first cool day in Norther Arkansas.  I made exactly as the recipe stated except I substituted bone in chicken thighs and boned and skinned them before sauteing in evoo and s&p.  After which I shredded with forks.  My picky 5 year old asked for seconds!  I served with white rice, steamed green beans and canned biscuits.

Great recipe, easy to adjust.  Added poppy seeds to sour cream/soup mixture, in addition to the cracker topping.  Used hint of salt crackers, low fat sour cream, and white wine and still came out tasty!  Added sauteed fine diced onion, and sauteed mushrooms to the dish. Layered diced raw chicken on the bottom, then onions, mushrooms before spreading the sauce and finally topping with crackers.  By the way, 8oz of crackers equals two sleeves according to the package. This is a lot, but if you love the crunchy topping, go for it!

Thanks Janet, this was truly fabulous! Super easy to prepare and went well with rice with herbes de provence and some sweet peas. I'd never even heard of poppyseed chicken before, so we didn't know what to expect. This was beyond expectation, a keeper! I didn't dice the chicken, just left the breasts whole. The cracker topping was sooo good, we used a spoon to scoop up extra from the casserole dish, yummy! This is a great comfort food. 4.5 stars for this winner.

My whole family enjoyed this, even my 2 and 3 year old boys.  I omitted the sherry, but made no other alterations.  We will be making this again and again.  It yielded a bit too much for us, so I think I will try dividing between 2 8x8 casseroles and freeze one prior to topping and baking.

We eat this recipe often and love it. I just cut up raw chicken instead of cooking first. Both my boys and husband eat it with no compliants. I serve it with rice pilaf from a box. Easy and good flavor each time.

I shred the chicken or use the canned chunks if i'm in a hurry and put that on the bottom of the dish.  I mix the soup, low-far sour cream (reg sour cream makes it too rich for me) , and a can of mushrooms (no sherry) and put that on top.  Then i mix the melted butter, cracker crumbs, and poppy seeds and sprinkle them over the whole thing.  This is one of the BEST recipes and i make it often!  My husband and 2 year old LOVE it and i usually have to make two batches so we have leftovers for lunch the next day.

After raving to my mother for a whole year about a poppy seed chicken casserole I had at a party last spring, I found this recipe and insisted we try it.

We were disappointed. It was bland and salty--tasted like your ordinary chicken-and-condensed soup casserole. I did substitute buttermilk for a bit of the sour cream b/c I only had about 6 oz--maybe that's where I messed up but somehow I don't think the taste could be affected THAT much by such a small change. A waste of rather-expensive poppy seeds. I'm still hunting for something that tastes like the poppy seed casserole I had last Spring.

I followed the suggestion to use onion dip instead of plain sour cream to add more flavor. I also added a little shredded cheese for flavor. While this was good, and my family ate it, I didn't get the rave reviews I expected based on some of the other reviews.

I didn't expect this to be as good as it was!  I used cream of mushroom soup because it's what I has on hand, and I just microwaved the chicken pieces while I prepared the rice and sauce.  Excellent!

Tastes Great. I used 6 tbsp margarine instead of 1/2 cup butter to reduce fat. I found the taste of sour cream too strong (but my husband loved it) so next time I will use plain yogurt instead. I think I will try cream of celery/mushroom soup next time for different flavor.

One of our favorites.  I use lemon juice instead of the sherry.  Also I will sometimes debone a fryer cooked in the pressure cooker or boiled and use the meat from that (much cheaper than the breasts)

This is very easy and very good.  I used 2 tsp poppy seeds and only 1/2 cup cheese and 1/2 stick butter.  It really didn't need anymore than that.  I use recipes from this site all the time.  My husband usually enjoys them, but this he absolutely wants me to make it again.

I am rating this because I have had it as is and is really good.  I had to adjust tonight to what I had on hand.  I had 3 small cans of chicken, mixed with a can of cream of celery with a chicken boullion in it.  Mixed that with the chicken and sour cream.  Since this wouldn't make much   I made white rice with a chicken boullioun cube in it.  Layerd the rice and then the chicken mixture and then the crushed crackers, butter and poppy seeds on top.  made a 8x8 pan

Very yummy.  I followed the recipe very closely.  I did cook the chicken first, then diced it, then covered with sauce and toppings to bake.  Baked 25 minutes covered, 5 minutes uncovered).  I used "Honey Butter" Ritz Crackers.  My husband and in-laws loved it too.  We ate almost the entire 6 serving pan, just the 4 of us.

My husband and I love this recipe - couldn't get enough!  And I am not a huge fan of recipes that involve canned soup, so that's saying something.  The sherry makes the dish, so if you have it (or wine), use it!  Next time I think I will try cream of mushroom.  Used light soup and sour cream to reduce some of the fat and calories.

I made this for years, but when I got married my husband said he would not eat casseroles. One night I finally made this for him, and now he says it's the ONLY casserole he likes. The only differences I make are I omit the sherry entirely, toss the melted butter with the crumbs, and sprinkle the poppy seeds across the top.  Just as a word of caution, he swears the poppy seeds give him weird dreams LOL

This is an EXCELLENT recipe! I made only minor changes. I omitted the sherry and used chicken and muxhroom soup. I've seen other recipes like this calling for 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can cream of mushroom soups. Since this only uses 1 can of soup, I decided to use the two combined in 1 can. I also used just 1 sleeve of Ritz crackers. It was just right! Served it over rice and did a side vegie and dinner was complete. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! Thank you sooooooo much for such a GREAT recipe, Janet!

I also put 4oz. of french onion dip and 4oz. of sour cream instead of all 8oz. just sour cream.I also put about a tsp. of garlic pepper in the soup mixture, thanks for the idea it was great!

We loved it. My 4yr. old said double thumbs up. I deleted the sherry, added some cheese and used half Ritz and half club crackers. It was great. We will make it again.

I thought I remembered having this dish at my best-friend's house when I was young and just loving it, so I made it for my husband the other night exactly according to recipe (minus the sherry as we don't use alcohol) and it left a lot to be desired. The poppy seed taste was just overwhelming. I am not picky about food by ANY means, but I could barely eat this. You have to really like poppy seeds in order to like this casserole, as it is the only distinguishing taste in the dish besides the butter and cracker (I used Ritz) topping. Ech.

Because chicken breasts vary in size, please provide weight rather than number of boneless breasts halves to be used in recipe.  I had 1.5 pounds of chicken and it was too saucy.  Two pounds next time.  And because of the sherry, mushrooms are a natural addition.

I love to make this dish when all of my nieces and nephews are over.  It is one of the very few things that they will eat.  However, the boneless chicken breasts can be substituted with canned chicken once it is drained for an easier version.

Outstanding! Has become one of our favorite dishes! So quick and easy to make and everyone loves it. My 4yr old calls it Polka Dot Chicken because of the Poppy Seeds! I have made it for company and always get asked for the recipe! I stick to the recipe but omit the sherry.

Today my family was at my husbands nephews funeral.  The men at the church very nicely made this dish for our family and guests.  This recipe was absolutely wonderful. fyi -They didn't dice the chicken breasts, they served them whole. Thank you so very much for all your kindness (Men at the united Methodist church of clarenceville in Michigan). One of the gentlemen was kind enough to give me this website for the recipe. Thank you again!

Boring and bland. I had heard good things from a friend about a similar recipe so I thought I would try. I seasoned and grilled the chicken before putting it all together - don't do that. It didn't work out. I thought since it wasn't really good for you, it might at least taste good - nope. Not trying again.

This is similar to a recipe that my best friend's mother used to make. She had less chicken in hers though so it was more saucy. And she served it over rice. I like the idea of serving it with noodles instead. Next time I will use less chicken so the noodle are coated with the extra sauce. :-)

I make this a little differently. Boil and shred chicken. Mix cream of mushroom, cream of celery, sour cream and 2 tbsp poppy seed. Pour over shredded chicken. Crumble crackers over top, then pour on melted butter. YUM!

LOVED this!  It was delicious.  It was so creamy, and the chicken just melted in your mouth.  My husband and family LOVED it.  We scraped the dish clean!!  Can't wait to make it again.

I use 8 oz of cream cheese instead of sour cream.  I also use 2 can of cream of chicken soup.  This sauce makes the meal.

We love this stuff!  I make this all the time, but cut my chicken into bite size pieces instead of using whole breasts.  I also always use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken just because I prefer that taste.  Sometimes for a more complete dish we add broccoli florets to it.

Excellent! I made this with diced turkey tenderloins, doubled the recipe, added some cayenne, minced garlic, fresh cracked black pepper, and used fresh sliced mushrooms and shredded carrots in the sauce. I marinated the raw turkey chunks in the sauce (in the fridge) for an hour and then baked the dish, covered, for one hour at 250 degrees F. I then raised the oven temperature to 350 degrees F, recovered the casserole, and baked for another 30 minutes. The turkey tested at 150 degrees F, so I put the topping on the dish and continued to bake it, uncovered, for 10 minutes. then I let it cool for 10 minutes and served it.

I varied the recipe slightly: 1/2 C. dry white wine instead of the sherry and 5 fresh mushrooms, sliced. I mix the poppy seeds into the chicken mixture. I melt the butter in a skillet, add the crushed Ritz crackers to it, and brown them slightly.  Then I put them over the chicken mixture. After baking, we serve the chicken mixture over pasta or noodles.

Really good.  I did use a can or cream of mushroom soup along with the other items.  I served it over rice.  Very good and simple.

this was delicious! I wasnt quite sure what sherry was, so it didnt add it. It also adds more crunch if you just get a big box of ritz and use 2 sleeves for the top of the casserole and use the other two sleeves on the bottom of the dish. (& it creates a smaller mess if you put the ritz in a big ziploc baggy and add the butter and ritz,close it up, then pound on it a bit)
thank you so much! it was awesome!

Yum--this was so good.  I wasn't so sure about it at first, but it really surprised me.  I used cream of mushroom instead just out of personal preference and I didn't have sherry so I just used a little white wine.  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT recipe... just made this tonight.  I didn't have sherry on hand, and I'm not typically one to use canned soups. I gave it a try and it was worth it.  I used whole, skinless/boneless breasts instead of cubes as others had mentioned. Overall, I think this is a keeper.

I make this all the time minus the sherry just because I don't ever buy it.  My fiance loves it, and he's super picky!  I've baked it for friends and family and have never had a complaint!  It's also great for freezing!

I don't use sherry with this recipe, but it is amazing without it. I always crush two of the ritz packs and bake a few more than 5 minutes without it being covered. It comes out amazing and I never have enough to feed everyone. They always want more!

My family loves this dish!  It has become a staple in our house.  I've had it without the sherry and it is really not the same.  The sherry gives it a punch that is lacking without it.  Delicious!!!  My ultimate comfort food.

This is comfort food at its best.  I like to season my chicken with salt & pepper and a sprinkle of Lawry's Seasoning. I also find the casserole more creamy by combining the sauce with the chicken before adding it to the dish to bake. If you have a jar of mushrooms handy, drain and add those as well.  This is a favorite in our house. Casserole goes great with green beans and rice pilaf.
