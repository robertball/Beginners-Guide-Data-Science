I've been baking no-knead bread ever since the original recipe came out in the New York Times several years ago, so trust me when I tell you it is not recommended that you remove the baking vessel from the oven after you've just spent 30 minutes heating it.  Do NOT remove it from the oven, just pour the dough (batter, really) into the baking vessel and then cover and bake.   That way you don't lose the heat you just spent half an hour to achieve to heat the pan.  Also, there's no need to shake the dough once it's in the pan, it'll spread by itself while baking.   It's really a misnomer to call this a dough, because it really comes out as a batter.  I agree with the other reviewer that it's impossible to form it into any kind of a ball 'cause it's just too sticky.  And forget the step of placing it on a towel to raise.  It's just messy and doesn't achieve anything more than if you just stir it and place it in a bowl and let it rise another 2 hours.  That said, I would rate this a 4, only because I think the instructions are not the best way to make this bread.

I became an avid bread maker when I discovered Jim Lahey's recipe.  I wanted to post it, but you beat me to it, Jewissa.  I'll have to try adding the fresh herbs, though.  Great idea! Proud as a peacock, I brought a few slices from my first loaf to work.  One of my colleagues, who lived many years in various European countries, picked up a piece and immediately identified it as European peasant bread.  After one bite, she said, "I need this recipe."  (She hasn't bothered with recipes in years!)  BTW, the "heavy-duty casserole dish" should be either cast iron or stoneware.  I've read that Le Creuset works fine, as long as you remove the handles, which aren't oven-safe at 450 F.  UPDATE: I brought this bread (minus the herbs) to a staff potluck, and it was a great success.  There were many recipe requests.  Those who've tried it are converts.  The only challenges are to find the proper pot and to figure out the timing.  I haven't bought bread since I discovered this recipe!
2ND UPDATE:  I've found, tweeked, and posted a recipe for a healthier yet delicious whole-wheat multi-grain bread which uses the same method.

I use 1/2 tsp instant yeast. Mix all ingredients, cover the bowl & set it aside for 12 hours.  Flour a surface, scrape the dough out, stretch it out, sprinkle with flour, fold it over itself one way & then the other, put a sheet of parchment paper in a bowl, spray with cooking oil spray & sprinkle with corn meal, place dough into the bowl for the 2nd rise (1-2 hours), & cover with a cotton towel.  1/2 hour before ready to bake, put the pot in the oven and preheat to to 500 degrees.  When ready to bake, if you want sesame seeds/grains on the top, spray top with cooking oil and add your seeds/grains & pat down lightly, take the pot out of the oven and remove the lid.  (I use several old towels just to protect surfaces when handling extra hot pots, also; you might want to use a pair of long sleeved pot mitts with silicone palms.  Lift the parchment paper & dough out of the bowl and place it into the hot pot.  Take a scissors and cut the excess parchment paper from around the top of the pot.  Put the lid back on the pot and place it into the oven.  After the first 5 minutes, lower the oven to 475 degrees & continue to bake for 25 minutes more.  After 30 minutes, take out the pot, remove the lid & check the internal temperature. If it reads 200 degrees, & the end of the thermometer is not sticky or gooey, put the uncovered pot back in for 10-15 minutes until browned. Remove pot, use a turner to lift the bread & paper out & place bread on cooling rack. Remove paper when cooled.

I have been making no-knead bread 3 times a week for over a year - love it!  I always thought that getting the dough from a towel into the pot a really clunky process, so I started using baking parchment and got myself a La Cloche. I rip off a piece of parchment a bit bigger than the bottom of the La Cloche, sprinkle it with flour or semolina and place the formed dough on it.  Cover with a tea towel and allow it to rise while the La Cloche is preheating.  What is great about this is that when the dough is ready to bake you can just lift the parchment and set it into the bottom of the La Cloche and put the lid on it.  The parchment will stick out, but it does not affect the baking process at all.  Sometimes the risen dough is so slack that I have to slide a pizza peel under the parchment to lift and transfer the loaf to the pot, but it works great, beautiful, high loaves of bread, no flipping or mess.

I also have used this recipe for a couple years with great success.  The only diff is I use 1/2 tsp. instant yeast, 1 tsp salt, 1 1/2 cups water.  This is more in line with the Sullivan St. bakery recipe.  I've included a pic of my version of cranberry walnut bread using this recipe.  Simply add cran. and walnuts to flour mixture, then add water.  Follow directions as given.   I've had luck with a shorter proofing time also....12-15 hrs depending on the season.  To make the baguette pictured, I placed the dough on a hot pizza stone and covered it with a loaf pan.  Shorter baking time, that's all.

I  Use this recipe all the time.  Usually 2 1/2 cups APF 1/2 c wheat flour. 1 1/4 c water. I let mine sit for 12 hours then 2.  Ive made about 30 of these loaves over the last 3 months.  Jalape√±o cheese, rosemary garlic, Hearty (with germ, bran, flax and nuts).  Awesome bread with no work. Comes out looking and tasting better than any artisan bought bread out there!

excellent bread. I love the crust. Tastes like great grams farm bread. I make it in the same bowls she used. I doubled the recipe this time the last time the loaf was gone before I could blink! if you feel the dough is to watery add more flour, too dry more water.

Part of making bread is using your sight and the feel of the dough. sticky like a marshmallow you break apart in your hands. dry is like leather so you add a bit more water. 

I have been making bread for over 4 decades now if it doesn't work its not the recipe.

The weather also plays big in making bread and the altitude at which you live.

Whenever I make this bread it disappears like magic! I do the same as another reviewer...1  1/4 t salt and 1/4 t yeast and 1 1/2 cup water. I don't bother with using a towel or anything. As soon as 18 or so hours is up, I dump the dough on a floured board, wait for the dutch oven to get really hot and just dump the dough in there! No matter how it has looked when I put it in the dutch oven, it looks and tastes fantastic when it comes out of the oven.

I made few no knead bread in the past and this recipe is the best .
Easy and simple.
Bread came out very very  crusty in the outside and soft and chewy in the inside, it looked similar to bread from fancy NY bakeries .
I read all  reviews and comment and I decided Just gonna do exact recipe steps .
Other reviews that give bad review basically seem not familiar with baking sticky dough .
So that my advice:
Don't worry how sticky it is just flour your hand and don't worry how it shape look pre baking , just dump  the dough in the Iron cast dutch oven pan and it will shape it self .(yes and I said dump it)
I read other review say no need to cover the pan and I disagree .
The reason you cover it because of the steam that going to drip back in to the dough and give the great crisp bakery style we looking for .
If you ever see the Lodge Iron Cast cover u will understand the kisses look like dots and that is mainly for the steam to fall back to the pan .
Other review give the recipe very poor review because the dough did not rise ,that a bad reason to give bad review , your yeast in fault thats why not working or you put hot water instead of warm which burn the yeast so go buy new yeast and try again .

EXCELLENT BREAD!!  Wonderful taste and texture! I added twenty turns of peppercorn and 1/2 tsp of minced garlic along with the recommended rosemary, thyme and sage.   I mixed all ingredients in the dough cycle of the bread machine - 30 min cycle.  When the 30 min dough cycle was completed I placed the dough on a lightly greased parchment paper to rise - let rise for 5 hours with a piece of parchment paper on top.  Preheat oven 450 for 30 minutes with a cloche or covered dutch oven inside.  After the 30 minutes of preheating I gently lifted the bread dough and placed inside of heated covered cloche and placed the top on.  Baked for 30 minutes with the top on then took off cover and baked 12 min to get bread golden brown.  PERFECT!!  The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and chewy.  Will Definatly make Again and Again!!  NO NEED TO WAIT THE 18 TO 24 HOURS unless you want a more sourdough taste.

This is a great way to make bread.  The recipe here is exactly like the one I have used in the past but mine used 1 teaspoon of instant yeast.  I so not know if the difference is important, but measurements of instant yeast are smaller than active dry yeast.  Annie0214

I made this bread with whole wheat instead of all-purpose flour.  The herbs make it special!  Instead of putting a towel under and another one over the bread, I used parchment paper on the bottom.  That made it easy to stick in my Dutch oven!  I'm sure I'll be making this again!

I have been making this bread for about 2 years and it's wonderful.  What I do differently now is let the dough rise for the 2nd time in the pyrex bowl or heavy pot I'm going to bake it in.  I seemed to burn myself alot trying to put the dough into the preheated pot.  I also don't put a lid on it and it comes out with a great crust.

I gave this recipe 5 stars, but I have to admit, I haven't made this exact recipe.  But, I was just so annoyed at the people who changed things and then gave it a low rating!  My recipe is slightly different; 3 cups flour, 1/2 tsp rapid rise yeast, 1 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 cup warm water.  Just mix the dry together, add water, stir it up and cover with plastic wrap.  Let it set 12 to 24 hours.  Then scrape it out of the bowl onto floured parchment paper, with floured hands pat it into a "loaf" shape or round, depending on how you cook it.  I've done the dutch oven method, 450 degrees for 30 minutes once the oven is preheated, then 5 to 15 minutes with the cover off.  I've also just preheated a pizza stone and moved the dough onto it with a pizza paddle under the parchment.  Baked it for 30 minutes with no covering and when I got it out of the oven buttered the hot crust.  The dutch oven version is a crunchy artisan type crust.  The pizza stone version made a soft crust.  Both were delicious!  Do NOT add extra flour because you think that a 2 to 1 ratio of flour to water is wrong.  It isn't.  The long 12-24 hours rising time turns the dough into a sloppy mess.  It's SUPPOSED to look like that!  If you want a firm sandwich loaf, this isn't the recipe for you.  But it's a simple, great bread.  The only addition I make is to sometimes add a tablespoon of sugar to the dry ingredients.  That suits our taste a bit more.

I, too, have been making this bread for several years & it is WONDERFUL!! It also makes great pizza dough... I just decrease the water to 1 1/3 cups & flatten the ball out in the pizza pan & let it rise for about 1/2 to 1 hour. Also makes great ciabatta bread! Just 1/2 the dough, stretch each out into long, thin, flat loaves, let rise on a large piece of parchment paper, then make deep dimples all over the top just before putting in the oven. No need to cover them during baking.

I've been making this kind of artisan bread ever since I saw the NYT recipe from Jim Lahey's Sullivan Street Bakery.  The main difference between this one and the original recipe is the increase from 1/4 tsp. yeast to 1 full tsp and the amount of salt seems a bit "much".  I wouldn't think you'd need such a long rise with the extra yeast.  Saw a cooking blog and a 4 1/2 year old child made this bread.  Cute as heck!  Took a loaf to a party and people loved it.......said it was like European styled breads.  Figuring out the timing is the most challenging part of making it.....especially if you have to go out to a job!  Try to find yeast made for Bread Machines.  Using parchment paper in the bottom of the dutch oven makes handling the dough much easier.......it's like a sling!

WOW!!!!! This bread is absolutely blow your mind delicious. I want to start by saying thanks to Baking Nana for her helpful review and advice on the Buzz. Doubt I would have had the courage to attempt this without her. My biggest concern when making this was how very, very wet the dough was. See the photos I submitted of the process. I see a few people tried to add more flour after the second rise. Don't do it! Trust me it will turn out fine. I added 3.5 cups of flour at the beginning because I was so worried (1 cup was whole wheat flour) and my dough was still soupy. There was no way I could fold it or mold it into a ball. After 36 hours for the first rise (I figured it would give a more yeasty flavor if i let it sit longer and it did, but mostly I left it that long because Baking Nana did. lol) I just used a rubber spatula to kind of slop it onto the parchment paper. I have to confess I was worried. But following the directions exactly this bread came out full of beautiful big holes and is the most delicious bread I have ever had. I do strongly recommend using parchment. Put the dough onto that after first rise, and back into the bowl for the next rise. Then just use the parchment to transfer the dough into the hot casserole dish/Dutch oven. I think you might lose some of that second rise if you try to spoon it from one to the next. I guess I've said enough. Just make this bread, and know you are doing it right! Thanks SO much for posting Jewissa!!!

I always make a 6 cup version and use my 10 x 4 cast iron pot. This way this dough is forced to gain height while cooking. Here's my initial mix - the rest is common to all recipes. 1. Proof the batter by mixing 1 teaspoon of rapid rise yeast and 1/4 C sugar in a large bowl. 2. Add 8 oz of 115 degree spring water (100-120 ok). 3. Whisk thoroughly and cover for 15 minutes to get foamy (ensures yeast is not deceased). 4. Add 10 more oz of the water (warm is fine) and 3 tablespoon salt (I prefer sea) - you can adjust the salt and yeast amount for the next time. 5. Start adding the 6 cups of high quality bread flour - first 3 cups can be just dumped in - and mix thoroughly. The add a cup at a time but mix thoroughly for 3-4 minutes before adding more flour - this is essential to observe how the mixture is hydrating since kitchen humidity varies. 5th cup is the same process but 6th becomes the part where you need more touch. So the last cup is a 1/4 cup at a time -mixing by hand for a few minutes each step until tacky and pulls away from side but still a bit sticky on your hands. More flour only if absolutely needed - wet is better than dry. Cover with a wet cloth and into cold oven with light on for the first several hours.  I add a head of chopped roasted garlic and 1 C of grated asiago before 2nd rise for special meals. The probe thermometer inserted when lid off is essential to get to 195-200

I agree with the reviewers who say NOT to take the pan out of the oven, but just to pour the bread into the pan. If you don't have the right pan--and you need one with a thick surface to prevent the bottom from burning, you can pour the roughly shaped dough onto a preheated pizza stone, and invert a large pot over the top. Still get the amazing crust, and the minimal handling keeps the awesome texture.

This turned out lovely.  Everyone commented on the sourdough taste.  Was easy to do too.

Made twice now following other hints that said to skip the towel steps and just stir in bowl then poured into the pan when ready.  
Both times I used dried spices as I did not have fresh and I used 1/2 white all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat.  The first time I increased the yeast by about 1/2 a teaspoon, the second time I didn't - I thought the addition of the extra yeast made rise a little higher and will do it this way from now on when using 1/2 whole wheat.  
I also put my clay baker in the oven when I turned on the stove so that it heated as the oven did instead of wasting time getting oven to heat and then spending 20 minutes heating the pan.  
Once the lid was removed mine only needed about 10 minutes to finish baking but I think there are other  factors that can affect this (altitude, true oven temperature)

I have made this recipe many times, and once you get the hang of how the dough should look and feel when you're mixing it, it becomes a really reliable recipe. Here are a few tips I've learned:  1.  The brand of flour that you use REALLY makes a difference. Spend some more money on a good flour, and it makes all the difference between a flat shapeless thing and a round plump loaf. I suspect that many of the bad reviews are due to using cheap flour, which just doesn't bind and hold it's shape as well. 2.  Instead of flouring everything, I learned that buttering a clean bowl and letting your dough rise in that overnight allows it to release from the bowl without popping the bubbles (olive oil won't work, I tried). I drop it out onto parchment paper, let it rest 30 minutes while my pot preheats then put the parchment paper and all in my preheated pot. Super easy. 3.  Also, you can use this recipe for pizza crust. Mix it up as normal, then stretch it out onto a buttered pizza pan (not stone) right away, no rise time in the bowl. Brush with olive oil so it doesn't dry out, and let it rise for a few hours. Top with whatever you want and then bake near the bottom of the oven at 450 for 12-20 minutes. Yum!  If you like a crispy bottom, prevalent the crust for about 7-10 minutes before adding the toppings.

A bread recipe with 50% water to flour is an unheard of ratio for bread. With the adoring review of poster AZ93 I just had to try for myself. This turned out a big mess! The mixture is one step above flour water. Why should a recipe need this much effort for proper results? I dumped in extra flour at the beginning after reading the posts. The recipe results were hard bread and a burnt up pot. There are better recipes out there that don't require tons of modifications to ingredients or instructions. The loaf is way to small anyhow. European style bread is much easier than the fore thought this recipe entails.

Made this for the 1st time today.  It was delicious.  The best bread I have ever had homemade.  It tasted like I just went to the bakery.  I read all the reviews and did what they suggested... not to take out the baking dish but to just "dump" the dough in while still in the oven.  I used a stone roaster.  I did spray the pan and sprinkled corn meal in the bottom.  Definately will be making this again.  It was a hit with my family.

This bread is amazing.  It is the famous NY Times No-Knead Bread.  I didn't add the herbs.  Worth the wait.

Very easy.  I live in a very dry climate and my dough was a little thicker than described.  I let the dough raise for 16 hours in the mixing bowl, then placed it in a 1 1/2 quart French White Corningware casserole dish that was sprayed with Pam and let it raise for another 2 hours.  I didn't preheat the dish, just placed it, covered, in the preheated 450F oven for 30 minutes, then took off the cover and baked it another 20 minutes uncovered.  I had no problems getting it out.  It has a nice crunchy crust with a slightly salty taste.  It is good with cheese and goes well with soup.

Absolutely wonderful!!! I made this exactly to the recipie using 1 teaspoon of fresh rosemary chopped fine. I cooked it in a 3 qt. enameled cast iron Dutch oven, the bread just rolled out of the pan when it was done baking without any sticking whatsoever. It  had a great crust and a chewy inside and the rosemary flavor was just right. I will make this from now on instead of plain ordinary french bread!

WONDERFUL bread!  Mine ended up sitting for closer to 36 hours - just because I didn't have time to bake it.  I used a silicon spatula to gently scrape the dough onto a well floured silicon mat.  Gently floured the top of the dough, it is sticky and gently stretched into a rectangle and then folded in thirds, like a business letter.  Then folded again to form a square and used floured hands to gently turn it into a round.  I let it rise on the mat, covered with a cotton tea towel for  2 hours.  I used a round enamel covered Le Creuset - pre-heated and followed the directions for baking.  It had a wonderful crisp chewy crust and a soft tender, holey crumb.   It rose beautifully and was just the most perfect golden loaf.  Thanks - this is a keeper!

PERFECT!!! My first ever time making any kind of bread without a bread maker and it was EXCELLENT! I am making another loaf for tomorrow. I made only one small change which was to only add 1 tsp salt instead of 2. I followed the instructions exactly and it was really SOO easy. The loaf was entirely gone in 10 minutes. This might be dangerous for my waist line!

I have been making this bread since Jim Lahey/Mark Bittman's recipe was published in the NY Times. It is fantastic! I also successfully make the  fast version using warm water, a little more yeast, & a touch of red wine vinegar. So good that I usually make a triple batch & have some to give away or freeze. Always works, always impresses!

I didn't want a round loaf so I simply put the batter like dough on a baking stone. I put my broiler pan on the bottom rack and filled it with water, creating the steam necessary for a crusty bread. The dough was way too wet to form any kind of loaf, but since that was my game plan, I was stuck with a blob of dough on the baking stone. Ugh! HOWEVER... what came out of the oven in 30 minutes was ABSOLUTE heaven! I'm telling you, it's the best bread I've EVER eaten. The crust was pretzel-like - divine. So I will be working with adding more flour or less water to see if I can end up with a dough that holds some kind of shape. I just don't want a round loaf. I'm telling you though, this is the best bread I've ever eaten, so I'm going to be experimenting.

This bread didn't work out for me. It either didn't rise or I missed the rise. I baked it anyway...it turned out about 3 inches high and it tasted ok when it was fresh out of the oven...soft on the inside and crusty on the outside. But after it sat for a few hours it became soggy and dense. I'll try again....

The key to this bread (in my opinion) is to use the cast iron or heavy covered pot (one time I used a roasting pan and it didn't work well).  The dough really is gooey like others have posted, but if you use a healthy dusting of flour, you'll be able to move it to the towels (be sure there's plenty of flour under the bread while it rises) and then kind of dump it or roll it into the heated dutch oven.  I only left it in for 30 min covered and 10 uncovered and it came out wonderfully crusty on the outside and chewy inside.  Awesome recipe.  I've shared it with friends and they rave over it too.  No more $3 loaves of tuscan bread!

I didn't add the herbs because I had multigrain bread flour. I decided to make this bread white this time around.

I had to make about 5 loaves to gt this down. Needless to say I can't bake bread, EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE!

I suggest you change the temp. of the water to 125degrees F. because my yeast instructions recommended the water temp be between 120 - 130 F. I also used a warmed bowl that came out of the dishwasher since I don't quite have a nice warm place to place the loaf to rest.

It came out wonderful. I can't wait until tomorrow to eat the one I'm making today!

this is a great recipe.  I've been baking it plain for quite awhile, but I never thought about adding  herbs.  Now that I've found it here, I've added the herbs, as in your recipe and it's even better.  I only use 1 tsp salt, though as I try not to eat too much sodium.  Next, I'm going to experiment with chopped olives and garlic, and Ancho pepper.

This really is a great recipe. I have made this loaf several times each time earning rave reviews. I have not changed anything in this recipe, it's simple and perfect as written. I am starting to feel adventurous about this recipe though and am thinking of adding flax, cranberries or even asiago cheese to the bread. I always let the bread proof in a ceramic bowl (never plastic or steel) and always use a cast iron pot for baking in. GREAT RECIPE!!!

I made this as is without the herbs because I just wanted plain, crusty bread. I also formed my dough into a log as best as I could and baked it that way with a little ramekin filled with water for steam, just to make sure the crust got crisp! My bread came out with a nice, crunchy, crust but aside from the crust I was really dissapointed with this bread. It was way, way, way too salty... 1t of salt would have been plenty... even 1 1/4t would have been better. And the yeast taste was completely over powering. It tasted the way beer smells to me, only stronger. I love yeast breads and artisan style ones have always been my favorite, but I think there really is too much yeast in this recipe for it to sit as long as it does... I had really high hopes for this recipe but unfortunately It was a waste of my ingredients and especially my time.

Just made this bread & it turned out really good. I added cinnamon & raisins to the dough. I also baked it on my clay pizza plate & covered it with a dutch oven & it turned out just right. I will make this again & try other spices the next time too.

I started this yesterday and am wondering about the water/flour ratio.  Mine isn't just "shaggy" looking as it says, it's just plain soup.  A very thin soup.  There is no way I could fold it into a ball.  I've added another 1.5 cups of flour to get it just out of the soupy stage.  I'm now curious about how it will bake.  No ball making with this.  Just pour it into the pan.

While the bread was tasty, it always came out flatter like a disc. The dough was batter, and was very difficult and messy to work with. Finally, I basically just upped the amount of flour to 4 cups and added in more water as needed. I found that if the dough looked a little dry when I first mixed it, it rose beautifully, was easier to handle, and the result was a beautiful round loaf of bread that my son begs me to make his sandwiches with, and, between my husband and son, I'm making multiple loaves/week!

Very good! Sure don't have to work very hard at all for this good bread. Came out just fine; don't over think, don't worry about it being a very wet dough. Did not stick to my cast iron dutch oven at all - I used a sprinkle of corn meal at the bottom. I will make this again and again!

Found out about this intriguing method of baking bread through Baking Nana's blog (thanks.) I made this twice; the first time I had trouble with shaping my dough into a ball, as others did. I think I probably used a bit too much flour trying to get  it round (fore it was just a blob when starting.) Turned out a good loaf, but not what I knew it should be. The second time; I only added 1 1/3 cups + 2 tb. warm water. I read somewhere (I think Martha Stewart) that humidity can play a part in a bread like this. This time things went much better. I preheated my small enamel pot and when ready to bake, I sprayed with non-stick spray. Carefully I added my dough. When the last baking was ready, I sprinkled with a bit of flour and smoothed for the final baking to make an incredible bakery look. The insides were perfect and full of holes; just like an expensive loaf should be. I cut the salt the second time to half for us and was just right. Thanks for the recipe. Will certainly make now and then with a these changes.

Omgoodness this is amazing! It was my 2nd time at ever making bread in my life. First time was a fail but it wasn't this recipe. Now I did pray an awful lot as I stared over the dough since 11AM yesterday so the big guy may have had a lot more to do with it actually working.  This will be made weekly at my house and maybe as a surprise for my relatives.  Well done and thank you so much for this recipe.

I made this exactly as directed.  The loaf looks beautiful-but is way too salty!  I will definitely make this again, but I will cut the salt back by half.  Can't wait to try it again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  After 24 hours of rising the dough was a perfect texture for forming into a ball.  Will be making this again very soon.

Picked the easiest recipe to learn how to bake bread.  I used all purpose unbleached flour, reduced the amount of salt, added rosemary and cracked black pepper.  I used a regular ceramic baking dish, preheated and dusted with cornmeal.  It turned out really nice for first time bread baking, and it was a hit with the boys.   I'm looking forward to not buying bread ever again.

This recipe for No-Knead Bread is more trouble than it needs to be. 


First, there's no need to heat water for it.  The long rise time makes it totally unnecessary to start with warm water.  Tap water is fine straight out of the faucet. (Also, I only use 1-1/2 cups, and find that's plenty.)


Second, it's too runny to try to shape it and it serves no purpose anyway, plus there's no need for a second rise.  Don't punch it down; instead, handle it as little as possible.  The easiest way to get it into the baking pot is to dust a sheet of parchment paper with flour and gently pour/scrape the dough onto the paper, then use the paper to lift the dough and put it into the pre-heated pot, paper and all.  (Parchment paper says it's rated to 420 degrees.  I've used it in this process at 450 degrees and have had no problems, but I do roughly trim off the corners so there's not a lot of paper hanging out of the pot throughout the cooking process.)

Third, I've found that 12-16 hour rise time is plenty, at least during warm weather.  In colder weather, I might let it go longer.


Try varying flours a little.  My favorite combination is 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup light rye.  Delicious!

Best  bread I've ever made! We were use to great bread coming from Northern California.  We're now in alabama and the bread is not the same. I've tried all kinds of breads from all kinds of sites and never got there until this recipe.  I did follow some of the advice from the reviews. Started the oven at 500 then dropped to 450 after 5 minutes. I also used the parchment paper trick and it worked well.
thanks so much for this recipe.!

I've tried this bread-making techniques for months now, love it!  My no-failed recipe:  455 grs. all-purpose flour, 1/2 tablespoon sea-salt, 1/2 tablespoon Instant Dry Yeast and 340 grs. lukewarm water.  Add a little more water if using bread flour.

Yum! I make this into pizza dough (as well as the regular delicious bread), I just decreased the water to 1 1/2 cups. I let it sit overnight, then when I run home for lunch I spread it out to a 12 inch circle (it spreads out perfectly! Not too sticky, not too thick, don't even need a rolling pin), so it gets a few hours to rise a bit more before dinner time. Then spread it with toppings and bake! We used fresh ground whole wheat flour and you can't even tell it's healthy.

Better luck next time. My bread was very flat. I tried using it for sandwiches and it was too thin. It also broke in my toaster. Wish the recipe gave the exact measurements of how much extra flour to add. Looks like other reviewers had to adjust this recipe also.

I had such high hopes with this recipe and don't know where I went wrong. After mixing the ingredients, I thought it looked rather wet but wanted to follow the recipe. After the suggested 24 hours, it did rise and have the air bubbles. However, There was no way I could even simply shape it into some type of loaf without continuously adding flour. Unfortunately, after doing that it never rose after the second rise time. I baked it up anyhow and it was a flat, heavy, dense loaf. The flavor was not bad, so I am going to try to salvage it into homemade croutons. Wish this would have worked.

Wonderful!  Could not find fresh thyme or sage at the store so used 3 teaspoons fresh rosemary, added fresh cracked pepper, kalamata olives and 1 cup wheat flour, 2 cups white flour.  Loved the crustiness.  Will certainly make again!  Just have to plan ahead as it takes 18-24 hours to sit.

Wow. I used fresh herbs from my garden and my family descended like locusts. I served it with a hearty beef stew (I am feeling fall in the air.) Here's a leftover idea: chop the leftover bread into 1" squares, toss with extra virgin olive oil and toast in a skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle with kosher salt and use as the BEST croutons!

This is just like the NYT recipe I've been using for years, it makes fantastic crusty bread. I cut the salt in half and use the 1/4 tsp yeast that is listed in the original recipe. I have tried countless versions of this recipe. My favorite is 2 cups white flour, 1 cup wheat bran. For the extras I add fresh chopped rosemary and kalamata olives. My family loves it, it is devoured in less than 24 hours.

This bread has a great flavor, however, I cooked mine in a cast iron dutch oven as directed and it tasted too smoky for me because the cast iron was too hot after preheating that long.  Nex time I think I will try baking it on my pizza stone and see if it works better.  It is an incredibly easy recipe and one worth trying again.  I just want to bake it in a different manner next time.

LOVELOVE this bread. I don't buy loaves at the store after making this recipe because we simply do not eat them. It was very easy to make, and completely customizable as it lends itself to many spices.

I love this bread, its the best substitute I've tried so far for using a proper bread starter like sourdough.  I love the big holes it gets.  I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter, except I used a little less salt and placed my dough onto a greased piece of parchment covered with plastic wrap instead of towels (from baking nana's blog).  The only issue I had was mine didn't really form a ball, it was too liquid for that so it really slowly splurged out, but that didn't seem to affect the bread in any way.

Delicious bread. I tried a different cooking method for fun and cooked this in the crockpot. Came out nice, but did take quite a bit longer.. was very moist when cooked that way

A very easy bread and astonishingly tasty given that there is no kneading.  The long slow rise is the ticket to the delicious flavor.

TOO SALTY!!! Will definitely make this bread again, but with 1 tsp salt instead of two. My bread came out flat. Not sure why, but will try to figure out how to make a round pretty bread bowl shape.

I have been looking for a recipe for bread with this consistency for a while.  Crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside with lots of flavor.  Very good and easy to make!

The bread was good but I thought it would be a denser bread, it was very airy or as my husband described it, spongy.  The flavor was good.  I did have issues with it rising during the 2 hour rise, maybe I needed to let it rise longer would that change the texture?  The trick with using parchment paper was great when the bread was done just pulled it out of the pan and pulled off the paper, very easy.

This was fast easy and fantastic.  I did not use towels, as I did not have any that would work.  I used greased foil and cling wrap lose over the top; to allow time for the dough to proof.  Yum-O

This is a good chewy dinner/sandwich bread if you can make it right, but the recipe is tricky and difficult to learn. It took me a few attempts to learn what "sticky and shaggy-looking" was, and I found that the fermentation time really depended on the season. The transfer from the towel to the dish is really clumsy, I'll have to think of a better way of doing that. I also had a bit of trouble with the baking time, but that's probably because I'm using a very small oven. I've added photos of all the stages so you know what to expect when making this bread.

I love this recipe. I have made it multiple times already and it always comes out amazing. I switch up herbs to make it taste like a different bread each time. Right now I have dough sitting with mixed in minced garlic. It smells so great. Can't wait to eat it.

First attempt at making bread ever!  I used bread versus all-purpose flour.  In honor of my grandmother, I rubbed a stick of butter over the entire loaf of bread as soon as it came out of the oven.  This made the crust FANTABULOUS!  Half the loaf is gone already; I danced I was so excited!

I made this exactly like the recipe except to make it into 2 10" baguettes. Just like the breads we make in the bakery, just not the hefty pricetag to go with it. Anyone complaining about the texture is not looking for this type of artisan bread, because it literally was the perfect texture and taste just as it was written. Chewy inside, denser than regular bread, crispy crust. Delicious.  Maybe I will try some fresh herbs in it next time.

OMG...what a wonderful recipe.  So easy to make and absolutely delicious. This bread has a crisp chewy crust...great for olive oil dipping.  We loved it so much the next day I had to bake another!  If anyone is leary about making bread...please give this recipe a try!

Excellent Recipe! Like others have said- it is a VERY soupy dough. I made the dough last night around 7:30 and baked it today at about 4:30. I tried to follow the directions in the recipe and poured the dough out on a floured board to "form" it into a loaf, but it was a runny blob.  Soooo- i scooped it up and put it back into a greased bowl and let it sit for another couple hours to rise again. To bake it I used my ceramic dutch oven and i did preheat it. It turned out fantastic! I am excited to make it again and experiment with roasted garlic and maybe even some cubed cheese. GREAT recipe- thanks for sharing!!

Delicious and easy, although somehow I failed to notice that it needed to sit for 24 hours!  The entire time I kept checking it and thinking the dough/batter looked like a terrific mess, and it was too salty, and I was sure I was wasting perfectly good ingredients and time, then it turned out fabulous!  I added ground flax seed (@ 1/4 cup) so I could claim it was healthy.

Made recipe with only 1/4 tsp of yeast and it is fantastic.  I've been making bread for forty years and never had tried anything like this.  It won't replace my regular bread recipe but I will make it often.

Really great bread! Easy to make and very tasty. First time really having success without using a bread maker. I followed the recipe exactly without adding any herbs. I used cast iron to cook it. Only thing I am doing different next time is the instructions say to let the dough rise a second time on a floured towel and it stuck. Next time I am using parchment paper. Overall, I recommend!

Ok, so I bake bread a lot (whole wheat & multi grains) and have wanted to try some Artisan type bread.  When I put this recipe together yesterday I was not sure how it would turn out.  I had read many of the glowing reviews.  I just took it out of the oven and I can't wait to share it at book club tonight.  If it tastes like it looks I will be the Queen of bread.

I consider myself a decent baker, but I try not to venture far from the recipe because baking can be a fine art and I'm not accomplished enough to experiment.  After letting the dough rest the first time for 24 hours, it came out of the bowl as a gooey, glop.  The consistency was so wet, I couldn't fold or stretch or tuck. I refused to give up so soon.  I added enough flour to get it to a manageable consistency and continued with the process, but the end result was spongey, not what I was hoping for.

Easy to make. Great recipe for beginners. The crust is great! I will double the recipe next time. I made the amount called for in the dutch oven and the bread came out more of a disc shape than the boule I was hoping for.

I use this recipe both as a no-knead and kneaded dough recipe. I recommend using more like 3 and 1/2 to almost 4 cups of flour (I use bread flour). I also reduced the heat of the oven to 425 degrees because of the parchment paper I use to bake and the bread came out with a softer, easier to chew and cut, crust. I baked it for about 35 minutes (20 minutes with the lid on the dutch oven, and 15 minutes without). This is my go to recipe.

I‚Äôve made this several times. There is no need to mess with the ‚Äúbatter‚Äù after it rises. Just heat the vessel your baking it in, open the oven an pour it in the parchment lined pot, cover and bake. Uncover bake longer. Bread lifts out smooth as butter!

This is my new favorite bread recipe!  Like others suggested, I did not bother putting this onto a floured towel.  I just stirred it up in the bowl.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  It came out with a soft yet chewy texture that tastes bakery-worthy.  It will be fun to experiment with different spices.  One suggestion: spread some cornmeal in the bottom of your pan before you pour in the batter.  I didn't the first time, and it got very stuck!

Crazy about this bread. It is going to fun to work this recipe in the future.  It turned out to be one of the most beautiful loaves I have ever made and the texture was just perfect.

I took the advice of some of the reviewers. I didn't have the proper pan to bake this in and I think that was part of the problem. The other was that it didn't rise enough. It was only about 3 inches high and it was very crusty. I had a hard time cutting into it, but the inside was soft, the texture was nice with little air holes. But, the crust tasted a little yeasty if that makes sense and I did think it was a bit salty.

PARCHMENT!!

I have seen this recipe on other websites, and many recommend using parchment paper to line the bottom of the Dutch oven.  This version did not, so I skipped that step.  Big mistake.  The bread was fine, except for the 10% that was burned hard to the bottom of the cooking vessel.

Yummy!  With a little planning, delicious home made bread is so simple.  I had two problems.  1 - the loaf stuck to the bottom of my dutch oven.   I don't know if the dough needed a light flour coat before going in (though I thought it was coated) but I will be sure to add a sprinkling of corn meal to the bottom next time.  2 - we couldn't wait!!  I started soup the same time as the dough (soaking legumes, etc) and put it on the stove when I put the dough up for its second rise.   The draw of warm, fresh bread and hot soup was too much for my daughter and me.  :)

This was the easiest bread to make!  Just know that the "dough" is more of a batter.  I just let it set for 16 hours, then floured a piece of Reynolds NON stick foil and poured the batter in it!  I shaped it with the foil, making it round by pulling up the corners, then set the entire thing, foil and all into the Dutch oven once it was hot, made a X on top of the bread and followed directions.  It's ok if the foil sticks out of the sides of the Dutch Oven!

I use 1 1/2 cups of water, 1 tsp sea or kosher salt, 1 tsp yeast, and then whatever herbs I want.  I usually prepare the dough before I go to bed and then bake it just after lunch the next day.  While it is still hot out of the oven, I rub a stick of salted butter along the crust...my man eats it like he has been starved for weeks!

I have made this same recipe for 20+ years now. I also use an 18/10 Stainless steel Dutch oven with lid. Cut a circle of Parchment paper,(using the lid to be exact),then after preheating pan I spray the inside with olive oil, place the paper in bottom, spray again, then place the shaped dough add the lid and bake as directed above. Comes out beautiful every time!

I've been making this bread for some time now...here is what I have found in my experience.  I use only 1 to 1 & 1-/4 C. water (otherwise dough is way too sticky and too hard to handle.  When ready to bake, preheat oven to 450, preheat the dutch oven for 30 min.  (no need to preheat the lid.  For ease of placing the dough into the dutch oven, take a piece of parchment and generously flour it and your hands. Place the dough on the floured parchment to form your loaf. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rest while the dutch oven is preheating. (There is no need to go through the second 1-2 hour rise)
When dutch oven is heated, remove from oven.  Gather up the 4 corners of the parchment over the bread dough and lift and place the bread, parchment and all, into the dutch oven.  Cover and bake as directed.  Turns out gorgeous!

I use only ¬º t. yeast and 1 t. salt.  But what I want to say is that this can be baked another way, and also that It can be stored in the refrigerator and used in stages. I didn't have the right kind of pot to use for it when I first tried it, so I baked it on a pizza stone, and I never looked back. It bakes in 20-25 minutes on the stone and it's great. I have also found that you can keep the dough in the refrigerator and cut off a hunk of it and bake it days later, and it is still great. So if you can't use up a whole loaf right away, you can bake small loaves instead over several days. I finally bought a pot to just dedicate to making the bread the way the recipe says, but I went back to using the stone because it seems easier than getting the dough in that very hot pot and then baking it so long, first covered, then uncovered, etc. I admit It's a little awkward to get the dough onto the baking stone - it is very wet and sticky. I put a lot of cornmeal on the peel, let the dough rise for the second time on the peel itself and take a dough scraper to make sure it is not sticking before I shove it onto the stone. It's quick and stunningly good.

I did exactly the recipe says. Turned out perfect! Let it stand in the room temperature for 18 hours, risen more than doubled. Love the smell of herbs while it baking, taste very good! 

The wet dough doesn't bother me since i make my pizza dough exactly the same way(texture of wetness) except i put 1/2 cup oil in the dough. Make sure your yeast is alive. A few weeks ago I went to my friend's house make some dough for baking, turned out her yeast was not alive after waiting for over 2 hours! I went to store bough new package of yeast dough risen within 90 minutes in the oven! Lesson leaned! Pre-proof your yeast all the time!

I have made this recipe for the last three days trying to perfect it for our taste.Although it is a simple recipe supposedly, I think the amount of flour added after the initial set time is critical.I think it's a touchy feeling thing as my first loaf came out just fine although to dark so I cut the the time back to 12 minutes for browning. I cooked in in my clay pampered chef  chicken cooker. Perfect for holding the moisture in. The second loaf I added garlic and herbs and cooked it in my iron skillet with a tin pie pan on top, I also used a little less flour. It cooked perfectly and came out of the pan perfectly. Just when I thought I had mastered this recipe, I baked my third loaf again trying to use what I thought was the best pan for sealing in the moisture. (clay pot)I used less flour and more or less poured it in the pot. Well it came out more like fachacia bread. very tasty, but not sandwich quality.I back to the drawing board.I needed more flour and I'm sure I'll get it eventually:)

The best bread recipe I've tried in a long time! Excellent texture, just the right amount of yeastiness. I used sea salt and cracked pepper with a bit of dried rosemary and left the entire 24hrs. I cant stop eating it with everything! Olive oil, butter, as sandwiches. I'll be making this weekly.use PLENTY of flour when tuening and again with the towels - I had no problems with stickiness.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I don't have a fancy dutch oven but I have a commercial clad 4 liter pot by Lagostina so I used it on this recipe.  The only down side is the loaf is a bit flat not as round as I expected. Next time I will reduce the water portion to 1.5 cup and a smaller pot.   Thank you for sharing.

I feel guilty taking credit for this bread because it was so simple.

Make it! You'll love it!

Super easy and delicious! Used a dough bowl instead of a towel for the second proofing then placed directly into the dutch oven.  The hardest part of this recipe is waiting for it to cool. I will be making this again!

It's simply to die for!! A sourdough taste that you want to keep eating. I have also substituted 1 cup white flour for 1C whole wheat.
Another change possible is to add 9 grain cereal in exchange for some of the flour. As for anyone complaining about "not rising", it would only be that the yeast was not good.  It rose perfectly for me, just like your picture.."Delightful" is how I would describe this bread!!

Cut the salt in half and it is a great base recipe to experiment with in regards to all the optional additions (various herbs and spices, cheese, etc.).

Wow- is all I can say! This is so good- chewy inside  and crusty outside-and SO easy to make! I personally found out I do NOT like the taste of Rosemary- I don't put that in anymore- but I DO like Basil, Oregano and Garlic :) I have seen that people think it's too sticky and try to add flour- DON'T!!! Just trust that it will come out perfect even if you have to pour/roll it into the baking pan. Ok. I tried adding cinnamon and sugar- not so good- but any of the savory herbs- absolutely delicious!!My whole family loved it! This is better than any bread machine recipe out there and much more delicious!!! Also the best outcome is to use a cast iron skillet, that I have found, or baked on a pizza stone. Tried it in casserole dishes and it didn't come out as well. I took it to work for a potluck and it was gone in no time with co-workers saying it tasted exactly like the bread a pricey Italian restaurant in our area serves. Great also for dipping into meat lovers spaghetti sauce from this site! Also great to make gourmet style grilled cheese sandwiches! It's absolutely delicious! If you should have any leftover, cut into 1 inch cubes and toast at 350 for about 15 minutes to make croutons :)

I made this bread and it came out wonderful! I didn't put the herbs in it, but I will try that in the future. I made this bread to bring to a pot-latch at church, and I received compliment after compliment from women that know how to cook and bake very well!! I even impressed myself. It came out just like the artisan breads I buy from the bakery. I cooked it in a cast iron dutch oven and the crust was crispy and had a nice hearty crunch to it, so tasty too! My husband liked it as well, so I will definitely bake this bread again.

This is very tasty.  Patience is needed and planing the day before.  I didn't have fresh herbs so added just a t of dried which was too much for me.  I also thought it might be a little salty and will cut both down the next time I make it.  Will be great  with soup.

Bread was dense and so-so flavor.  I hoped the longer fermentation time would yield a better flavor and texture but not so much.  Beyond that this recipe took a loooong time and the end result was unimpressive.  I would not make this again but if you want a loaf of bread in 2 1/2 days go for it.

What an easy way to make a crusty artisan loaf.  I have never found another way to get that great crust.  
Now I am trying to find a way to make this into "soup bowl" rounds without buying tiny dutch ovens.

This is the third time I have made this bread.   So super easy.  This time I added fresh oregano, fresh rosemary and some kalamada and green olives. Too  yummy for the tummy!  Each time I make this bread, I add something different.  The fresh herbs are always a hit.

OMG, never thought it would be so easy to make great bread like this. Did everything exactly as asked for and it turned out wonderful.
I used half spelt flour and half whole wheat with rosemary, thyme and fresh sage.
Can't wait to make a bunch of more breads playing around with different flour combinations (Buckwheat, white, spelt, whole wheat, rye...) and ingredients like onions, garlic, shredded carrots, fresh parmesan

This recipe is AMAZING! If it were not so tasty, I would have given it 4 stars due to the saltiness. 

I used King Arthur bread flour. I opted to exclude the herbs. Next time, I'll use less salt, perhaps, 1/2 tsp salt instead. Also, I will forego using the towels, which was slightly messy while transferring to the Dutch oven. 

Overall, the dough was beautiful to handle and not too sticky after the final proofing (as many have described in their reviews). The texture is chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. The bread had lots of air bubbles but not too many.  The final product was picture perfect and is now a staple in my household.

Yes, I will make it again. Very simple.
This bread is dense, not fluffy. But air bubble holes throughout and very good as a bruschetta or with butter, good bread for a charcuterie board.

Easy!  I followed reviews and just kept it in the original bowl while rising.  I beat it down and let it rise the second time.  Then just scooped it in the baking vessel.

A forgiving bread, I wasn't feeling well and left it to rise an extra 2 hours.  The resulting loaf looks impressive and has a flavour slightly reminiscent of sourdough.

Very nice taste but a bit strong though with one teaspoon per herb. It does not go with everything you want to put on a slice of bread. I will try to use some caraway seeds next time but still delicious ... great bread. Another point is that 18-24 hours is not working at all for me I had to toss that batch out but tried it again and after 3.5 hours I saw good result. I took the dough out of the bowl and put it onto a floured surface put a good layer of flour over it and die actually kneat it for a minute or so and it made it way easier to be formed into a ball. Put it inot a proofing basted outlined with flour for another 2 housr and it really worked. One might also play with the flour mixture and use whole wheat or rye flour in it ... I will update y'all ...

New to the baking bread scene so I measured exactly.  Dough was sticky but WAY TOO thin. Added flour but could never get it to look like in the video before letting it rise. 
Tasted good but something amiss
. I used 3 cups of flour but seems I should have ‚Äúweighed‚Äù vice using a measuring cup. Then used 1 2/3 cups of warm water
Help-several blogs suggest weighing flour vice measuring in a liquid measuring. Cup

I made this without any herbs.  It was out of this world delish.  Crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.  It takes a long time from start to finish, but you don't have to do anything with it while it is doing all the work by itself.  I will be making this over and over.

I‚Äôve made this recipe dozens of times using a Dutch oven and follow it almost exactly. Sometimes I bake it after only five hours or so, and it‚Äôs great, too. Overnight it gets more of a sourdough taste. It‚Äôs great though and really simple.

Made it, followed directions. My daughter observed that the area where I left the dough to rise was not very warm. The dough didn't rise much. However, it was quite tasty. I'll make it again

Such good bread. I did tweak it a little. I have my own sourdough starter and added about 1/2-2/3 cup of that and slightly reduced the water. I used an entire package of yeast and left everything else the same. I made plain bread and it turned out so chewy and moist with a nice sour taste.

What a great recipe! I made it once this past week and was worried since I have never made bread what it would be like. Oh my gosh it is so good and easy! Now I have made it 4 times in the past 2 weeks!

As others have said, the instructions and video describe it as a more solid dough before it goes in the oven, but it's really more like a batter and you have to keep rolling and folding more flour in in order to make it look like in the video.
That said, the bread tastes (and smells) good and wasn't too difficult to make.

This is so yummy. Smells and tastes a bit like sour dough bread but much better with all the herbs. Word of warning. It's not easy to get the bread off the towel. Maybe add a LOT of flour. :)

Have baked a lot of bread, and this is the only recipe I've ever tried that completely failed.  Looks like other reviewers have modified the method or recipe to good results, so suggest others read comments thoroughly before baking.

First off it has to be unbelievably outstanding for me to put a 5 star on anything so 3 from me is likened to most people's 4 star.
I was looking for a bread similar to the one I used to make out of my mom's old hand written cookbook I have had since 1986, buy that got lost in the fire last summer. It was close but the texture and flavor was a bit off so 3 stars.
I had no problem getting it to hold I suggest that if you do have a problem make sure that it is in a area over night  that doesn't get cooler than 65' f and use a generous amount of flour on the work surface and your hands.
I am thinking next time I will use lard instead of shortening to get the texture and flavor I was hoping for.
Thank you for the recipe.

This bread might have been good, if I could have extricated it from the baking dish.  I cooked the bread in my Le Creuset enamel coated dutch oven, but the bread stuck so badly, we could not get it out to eat it.  The recipe indicates that the baking dish should be ungreased.  If so, then you need to shake a lot of flour into the dish to have any hope of getting the loaf out.  So disappointing.  The instructions should emphasize the need to flour the baking dish or use cornmeal to keep the loaf from sticking.

This was delicious! My whole family raved about it. I didn't have sage so I added a little bit of oregano. Right after I took it out of the oven I brushed it with melted butter. It turned out kind of flat, but is was still great.

I live on an island in the Pacific Ocean up by Canada so it‚Äôs a lot cooler here.  I need to go with the longest recommended first and second rise times. In fact, I get perfect results going 3 hours for the second rise.

Also I get an evenly crisp brown chewy crust if I bump my oven up to 500-degrees for the first 30 minutes and then turn it down to 450-degrees for the final 15 minutes.

I, like others before me had noted, avoid the proofing cloth on the second rise with the no knead recipes because the dough is still too sticky.  I switched over to laying the dough ball on lightly greased parchment paper instead.

And lastly, I don‚Äôt put the lid on the pot in the oven to preheat. It‚Äôs easier to just set it on the rack next to an empty cast iron pot to pre-heat the dish and then cover the pot only once the bread is placed in the pot.  It‚Äôs one less opportunity to burn yourself if you do.

Its awesone arrisian bread without the complicated steps. Im making it a second time this week.  
The flavor, crispy crust and airy bread makes it the perfect choice.  I do use King Arthur flour which is a winter wheat and higher in protein. It has given us a good result.

I've been making this recipe for 3+ years.  I don't add the herbs, but I follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  Never have a problem except I find I'm enjoying too much of this fantastic bread.  I lived in France in 1950's and this bread brings me back to that time!

This bread was amazing with Chef John's Chicken, sausage, peppers, and potatoes, toasted or just sliced and dipped into the sauce. The bread also compliments my Elk Chili for  dipping as well, I can just imagine all the possibilities with the addition of herbs, spices and cheese! Awesome recipe, thanks! Double the recipe to make an extra thick loaf for BLT's and today Roasted Turkey Bacon and Muenster Grilled Cheese with all of Thanksgiving leftovers!

More or less how I make my bread. Use to have a bread maker but some toe rag broke  into our house and stole it with everything  else.  Only thing  that I do different it put garlic power in the mixture. How much well how much do you like garlic.

Very easy to make but i found it needed some added gluten or it came out a little flat. Also the dish needed greasing before the bread went into the oven in it or it would stick really bad.

I always follow a recipe to the letter the first time I try it. 1.67 cups of water seemed like an awful lot as I was adding it, and what I wound up with after a 22-hour "rise" was a gooey, unsalvageable flour slurry that went straight from my counter to the trash. Wish I had read the other 1* reviews before attempting and gone with my instincts.

I've been experimenting with all sorts of bread recipes this summer. this one's a total winner, came out exactly as described. I added some rosemary and dill, did second rise in a floured bowl in unlit oven with hot water underneath. used mixer to mix initial ingredients and dough hook very briefly
to make the ball. sprinkled cornmeal bottom of Dutch oven so no sticking.

Yum yum yum and easy. Just make sure you take note of the time it takes to prove (rise) which is about 20 hours more or less. Other than that, very easy and tasty. I added the suggested herbs and carved it up and made the best turkey and Swiss sandwiches I've ever tasted.

Are you kidding.  Bread was good but two days to make is not acceptable.  I'll knead any day to get a loaf in four hours.  Sorry ??

I have made this bread several times and I love it!  I have split the flour in half using 1.5 cups all purpose and 1.5 cups whole wheat.  It works great.  I use a cast iron dutch oven and cook for 30 minutes covered and 15 uncovered at 350.  Turns out great every time!

This turned out perfect. I followed the instructions exactly as outlined and we ended up with a perfect loaf of artisan bread. We used an unbleached organic flour, and fresh sage and oregano from our herb garden. We loved it so much that it was completely eaten an hour after it was taken out of the over. The kids couldn't keep their hands off of it.

We used some good quality extra virgin olive oil mixed with some freshly ground black pepper for a dipping sauce and paired it with various types of cheeses. We will definitely make this again and look forward to sharing it with our family and friends.

I've now made it twice. Popular with the eaters in my household. I'm doing something wrong though...at the step where you take it off the floured counter top to put it on the floured towel, it's not that easy to move and you end up kneading it.

I made this recipe that is very close to the new York times recipe.
What happened to me when making the NYT recipe is that my oven cut out( breaker?) after 30 minutes. I just left the loaf covered for another 25-30 minutes . Turned out GREAT.
So I did the same with this one. 450 F for 30 mins then turned the oven off and left loaf COVERED for another 25-30 minutes.
What you have is an amazing crust..
Try it.
portions of water flour yeast ect is way better in this recipe
I did cut salt by half and it was perfect for my taste buds

Excellent bread.  Took some time and patience but well worth the effort.  I followed the recipe  and  Instructions in detail with no undue mess.  Rising under the floured towels provided a easily worked dough, no excessive mess and not too sticky with floured hands.   Transferred easily to the preheated dutch oven and baked up perfectly, great crust, inside texture and taste.   I will make this many more times.

I followed the portions on the recipe but the dough was super gooey.  I'm not a first time bread maker so  I ended up kneading a full cup or more of flour into it & then let it rise in the bowl a couple hour to incorporate all the extra flour that I had to add .  From this point on it turned out great.  I used a piece of floured parchment paper to transfer the loaf into the Dutch oven. It worked great. My dough didn't have a lot of air holes in it so it may have been from the extra flour or I might not have let it rise enough befor I cooked it. Still super yummy. All the other recipes that I've seen online use 1 1/2 cup of water instead of the 1 2/3 cups that are in this recipe. I'm trying it again and already it is looking better.  I used some leftover potato water for my liquid which I'm sure will fine.

This recipe is a slight variation on the New York Times No-Knead Bread recipe by Jim Lahey and Mark Bittman. I find this bread to be so easy to manipulate. It is really a batter bread rather than a dough. 

Per the original NYT recipe I used a rounded 1/4 teaspoon of INSTANT YEAST. Instant yeast gives more volume. Also I just use standard unbleached flour.  Used exactly 1 5/8 c water.
My house is cold at night, but nevertheless, in 18 hours I get a bubbly batter that is ready to shape and raise. I heavily flour a silicon mat  and pour the dough out onto that and fold the dough over on itself.  I skip the ball shaping because I bake this in a large oval dutch oven and it really isn't necessary. Cover with MORE flour and a towel or a plastic wrap, and let it rise 2 hours or until a finger poke does not spring back. I have used both plastic wrap or a cotton towel loosely placed over the top of the shaped dough with no sticking.
I preheat the  dutch oven in the oven at 450 for 30 min.  The dough then easily slides into the preheated pan from the silicon mate. 
 I score the dough, add a couple ice cubes in the sides, clap the lid on and bake for 30 minutes. Take the lid off and bake 15 to 20 min more or until it is browned perfectly. This bread is usually gone in a day or two-my husband cannot get enough. I haven't tried the herbs or seasonings other than salt yet. I have made it twice and it turned out deliciously perfect both times.

Quick & easy!    I did not use the towel or parchment paper in the process to transfer the bread.  I stirred it in the same pan it had rested in, let it set another 2 hrs then dumped it in the hot corningware dish.  Yes it did not look like it would turn into a loaf of bread but it did!   I also used dried herbs about 1/2 tsp each because I did not have fresh.  It came out great.

This bread is fantastic.  I'm new to baking so I appreciate the simplicity.  To be honest I was a little confused on the directions  with the other reviewers advice..... so I looked up no knead artisan bread on youtube.  It was a no brainer, simple and comes out DELICIOUS.  I used fresh rosemary from the garden and a tsp of dried ground thyme from the cupboard.    Deeeelish.

Although the flavour is nice, the batter should not be transferred to a work surface, but simply stirred down. After letting it rise a second time, it should then be poured into the hot casserole.

I make this nice crusty bread often, allowing it to rise in a covered bowl rather than a towel. It's  easy to customize the seasonings to  your preference. It's very good without any seasonings at all.

Wonderful recipe. My first time making no-knead bread. I omitted the herbs and added dried cranberries and nuts instead.  Loved the cranberries, but the nuts got soft and I would omit them , but will definitely make again. So easy.

I've made this bread SO many times that I've become comfortable making changes and additions. 
First, the salt amount can be reduced if you don't enjoy salty things like chips. If you do, you can even up it to a Tbs if you'll be adding the seasonings.
Another thing to take into consideration is the yeast amt. If you're baking in a warm and humid kitchen, 1/2 tsp of Dry Instant Yeast (DIY), by the time 24 hrs comes around your dough will have over proofed. That means the yeast will have "eaten" up all the "food" it had in the dough. It will have risen and flopped and nothing you did will have revived it. A warm kitchen is in the 75 - 80F and above temps. I would start checking your dough by the 12th hr if your climate or kitchen is that warm and humid. Any warmer and I'd check even at 8 hrs! So I have actually decreased the yeast to 1/4 tsp in MY recipes because my kitchen is usually around 78F.
Also, if you've added whole grain flours, you might want to increase the water by at least 1/4 c for e/ c of whole grain flour. So adding 2 c of whole wheat flour instead of the APF you'd add 1/2 extra cup of water to the recipe so you'd be adding 2 cups of water TOTAL.
You might also want to add bread flour instead of the APF, just to make sure you have good gluten structure in your bread. Not all APF has enough protein in it to build it so it would be good insurance.
And just to be sure, in case someone has a question about it, there's no way to make gluten free bread no knead. The e

I was surprised how easy this was and it came out great!  I have made it several times now.  I just make it the night before and let it rise overnight, then for the second rising I just put plastic wrap over the dough and it works fine.

I am so happy I found this recipe! I used 1/2 tsp of Active Dry Yeast and the parchment paper to transfer the dough from the bowl to the Dutch oven dish. whole family was amazed by this bread. We don't have to buy $5 fresh bread any more. Thousand thanks for sharing this recipe.

Wrapping the gooey dough with floured towel  and removing preheated dutch oven is not recommended.

This is my second no knead recipe I've tried.  I'm glad I read the reviews before making because I did reduce the water to 1 1/3 cup so the dough would be more pliable.  I was looking for a more flavorful bread.  I used 1tsp dill, Penzey's Fox Point seasoning which has onion, garlic and salt  & reduced the salt to 1tsp.  
The bread was very good but didn't rise much.  I will keep tweaking this, maybe I can get a higher loaf.  However the flavor, crust & crumb were outstanding!

This is a wetter and higher yeast version of Jim Lahey's bread. Use 1/4 tsp yeast, 1 1/2 cup water, and 1 1/2 tsp salt and you have the bread of the Gods. God bless.

This bread was easy to make and turned out well.  The dough was very sticky as described.  I let it rise for about 24 hours but it was too gooey to try and form into any shape so I gave it a little stir then turned it out onto a piece of parchment paper then covered it with a towel and let it rest for another 2 hours.  I baked it in a pre-heated porcelain covered cast iron dutch oven for 30 minutes covered and an additional 15 mins uncovered.  It has a nice crusty crust and a soft interior.  It was a little on the salty side, so I plan to reduce the amount of salt in future loaves. Looking forward to trying this with different flours and adding other ingredients in the dough!

I loved it. My husband even loved it!  Great toast.
I made it in a Corning White 2 qt with lid, lined with parchment.  
I DID NOT heat my pan.  Just poured batter onto parchment paper.  Covered with lid. Put in preheated oven
My oven was preheated at 425.  
Baked per instructions.  Removed the lid and let it crisp up.
Am making it again this week.
FUN....EASY...AND TASTES GREAT!

I have made this for a second time.  The first I only added 1tsp of salt, this time the full two.  I will split the difference next time.  This time I used 2/3 c 12grain flour, fresh rosemary and thyme.  I also added two types of flax seeds, sesame seeds and some walnuts. Turned out just as nicely as the first loaf!  This is so much fun to make!  Next time I will try cheese in it.

It was good but I think I will use 1/2 the spice amounts as I thought they were a bit overwhelming. Cooked in a cast iron pot and the round shape looked something out of the country.

I wanted to be able to use this bread for French toast, so I left out the herbs.  No flavor! Texture is great though, so won't be able to eat it plain. Be sure to grease your baking dish, or you will be chiseling it out.

This was as easy as the recipe said. I couldn't believe it!!! And the taste was incredible. I only added fresh rosemary (as it's all I had on hand), but it was just perfect. I used about a tablespoon and a half of freshly chopped rosemary.  I can't wait to make this again!

Made this as written. Didn't add any herbs just the base recipe, next time I will use less salt it was a bit too salty IMO. my dough was sticky but shapeable after it sat the 24hrs. I scraped it onto a floured cookie sheet and dusted flour on top stretched and folded it into a ball flipped it over seem side down and covered it with a towel for the 2 hr rise. I put my dutch oven in and let it heat with the oven, when it was ready I just opened the oven took the lid off and placed my dough in the Dutch oven while it was still in the oven I put the lid on for 30 min then 15 min without lid and it came out perfectly golden with a crunchy crust. I'm in colorado so high altitude baking sometimes needs adjusting and this was fine as is didn't need any adjustments.

The first time I made this, it came out perfect- but that's because I accidentally didn't follow the recipe. I didn't put as much water- only 2/3 cup, but then added a little bit more until  the dough was sticky- and I added less salt (not sure if I misread the proportion or I excluded it completely). Nevertheless, it was absolutely divine, both in taste and looks, which was amazing because I didn't even have a dutch oven. I baked this bread in an ordinary lidded casserole dish, and the 30 minutes were enough for it to brown very nicely under the lid. The second time I made this, I put exactly the amount of water and salt that the recipe called for and it was waaaaaaaaay too watery. I couldn't even make a ball out of it; it was just batter. So I poured it in the casserole dish and baked it and it came out okay, but too salty and not  good-looking. I will make this bread again, but I will do it like I did the first time.

So very easy and delicious! This is the least work I've ever done to bake bread, and one of the best loaves I've ever made! I used crushed dried rosemary and thyme, and I baked in a cast iron skillet with a lid as directed. The bread has a beautiful, flaky outer crust and chewy, moist insides. This is my new go-to bread recipe!

This recipe is Very forgiving!  I am not an experienced bread maker and did about everything wrong. My kitchen was cold so bread rose and fell.  Then it stuck to everything.  The last rising I put it outside which helped a tad, but not much.  With all that while my loaf wasn't very high, the flavor was outstanding. And I will follow other's advice,  skip the towels and put it in a bowl to rise next time.  Will definitely make it again.

Extremely bland. It is decent with a dipping sauce such as garlic butter or an olive oil blend. This is not a stand-alone bread. My family hated it and I won't be making it again.

This was so easy to make!  The first time I followed the measurements exactly but used only crushed rosemary for herbs.  My son thought it was the best bread ever.  I followed other's advice and just dumped the dough onto a heavily floured board and folded it once and let it sit there while I heated my dutch oven at which time I was able to pick it up and put it in the dutch oven.  I think it helped that I floured my hands well before dumping it onto the board and picking it up off the board.  It kept my hands fairly clean.  Baking time was perfect.  I'm making it again with no herbs added and I cut the salt back to just one teaspoon as I thought it was just a tiny bit too much the first time.

I have made this bread several times using the recipe as is - my family LOVES it!  It could not be easier .  Bakery breads are getting so expensive that I decided to give it a shot and this will now be my go to artisan bread.  If you like bread make this recipe, you won't believe how wonderful it is!

This bread did not work well for me; perhaps I had some differences in how I measured the flour?  Followed the directions exactly, and it was more like batter, as many of the reviewers noted.  It never really formed a dough, so I was skeptical I would get much rise/loaf formation in the oven, and I did not.  It also had a slightly sourdough flavor, likely due to the extended fermentation period.  Not sure if I will try again - maybe with the addition of 1/2- 1 cup of flour and more stirring, to give it more structure.

This was really good and quite easy. We live at high altitude (6200 elevation), so I wasn't sure how it would work, but it worked great and I will make this again!  The only spice I used was fresh rosemary because I love it so much. I started the bread in the morning and baked it the day after in the evening (about 34 hours later), so I gave it extra rising time for the second rising because of the altitude and cooler winter temperatures.  I also followed the recommendation of not putting the risen dough on a floured towel, but just covering it in a bowl with a floured towel for the second rising.  This tasted very much like the La Brea rosemary and olive oil bread they used to sell at Costco. So good!!  Dont use rapid rise yeast.

This bread is excellent!  I had to add a little more flour than was called for....could be the difference between american and canadian flours.  The crust was golden, crisp and crunchy while the inside was moist, soft yet dense.  A keeper for me.

I am an experienced bread baker but This was the first time I have made a No-Knead bread recipe and I am very happy to say it turned out great. I made some changes, I used bread flour because I have lots of it. 2 cups ABC and 1 cup of Field Blend from Grist & Toll. The only other change I would make is a little less salt. Great texture and taste.

I use this process frequently, favorite change is omit the herbs and add 1 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup toasted pecans. Baking in a dutch oven is fantastic, use that process for most all bread recipes excepting sweet breads.

BIG FAN!! This was absolutely perfect! After reading some reviews that the bread didn't rise, I used a smaller cast iron dutch oven that I originally thought I needed. It rose beautifully & was the perfect sized loaf. Crusty & chewy on the outside & tender & delicious on the inside. I have a feeling this recipe is going to be the demise of my New Years resolution.  Make it; it's SO good!

Was skeptical  at first, as the dough was so liquid, but I followed the steps exactly and was rewarded with a beautiful tastey loaf.

One of the easiest bread recipes out there! I've been making Artisan breads for a while because I like the hard crust and an almost sourdough flavor. It was fun to cook bread in my cast iron skillet with a lid (Dutch oven) because The only other bread I've used that for is cornbread. I really enjoy having the option of the fresh herbs - I found a poultry pack at Walmart that has Rosemary, Sage and Thyme! So I only had to buy one pack! Yummy!!!

This bread is AWESOME, I've made 3 times, but I'm still troubleshooting a little with the first rise time. I've let it sit 18 hours (our house stays pretty cool at night - about 65) and it seems to be too much, since the bread doesn't rise properly while cooking.. it ends up a little flatter than I like. However the taste is really great, and it looks beautiful. Next time I'll try putting it in the fridge for longer the first rise.

Easy and fabulous.  The artisan breads we buy are at least $5. a loaf. This bread can be started at dinner one night and baked just before dinner the next. Really great!!

I love this bread, and so do all my german friends.  Much like german bread!  I like to make mine with pistachio nuts and another variation with sun dried tomatoes, garlic and grated parmesan cheese.  To die for!

This was a very tasty bread but it stuck to the enameled cast iron pot I cooked it in.  I recommend oiling the pot.  It was too moist too.  Don't know what to do about that but reduce the water.  I'll try the same recipe but kneed the dough and oil the pot.

I just baked it on a pizza stone and it turned out beautifully. Leaving it out for a day or so before baking it really adds a great flavor to it.

Needs to be baked on a GREASED cookie sheet or casserole dish.  Now I have two casserole dishes with stuck-on bread crust. Otherwise, good bread.

It was tough to eat, and took a long time to rise.  Not worth the effort.
