This is one of my family favorites as well!  It was lost along the way.  Thanks for posting it.  It is an art to get just the right amount of filling AND have them stay sealed.  A tiny bit of water on the edge helps. Also I do not use the glaze, I gently roll them in powder sugar instead while they are still warm. I have discovered that they are too fragile for hot humid summer days of North Georgia.  They are usually fine in December though.

I liked the taste, but mine didn't really stay together.  I followed the directions exactly, but while they were baking, they came apart and apricot preserves leaked out of them and all over my pans.  I did  not use the glaze.

These are the classic apricot jam cookie that I have made every Christmas-You can make the almond drizzle for these if you use raspberry jam or else leave them unfrosted for a less sweet cookie-Either way they are 10 times better than store bought and make the kids help you too!PS-a little water helps in keeping the points together over the jam

I've made this recipes for over 40 years. I lost my recipe so hunted for it online. Found a recipe ( not on this site) and it was the same. Cookies were flakey, light and VERY good. Didn't think to save the recipe of course so tried this one. Not good. Tough pastry, not sure about the ratio of ingredients, I think something is off here. Darn

I have been trying to work this recipe but am having huge problems with it.  It rises too much to fold over the cookie.  I tried making balls and filling them, but again, it expanded too much to be filled.  I couldn't fold them over because they kept coming apart.  Honestly, the dough is sooooo tasty, I will do anything to make this work, but I cannot seem to not end up without the apricots all over the parchment paper, (thank goodness for parchment paper!!!)  Someone please help me to fill these without all the filling falling out!
