Why settle for commercial "finger-lickin' good" when you can have these?  Absolutely fantastic, and not too spicy for us.  Because I didn't have jerk seasoning blend on hand, I added jerk flavours to the dip.  The ingredients that went into the blender were all the above plus one onion, 2 1/2 tsp. thyme, 2 tsp. allspice, 2 tsp. black pepper, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. cayenne, and salt instead of the jerk seasoning blend.  While the flavour was out of this world, the other revelation was the long cooking at a lower temperature.  Usually I make my wings at a higher temp for a shorter time, and while they're good, the texture was much better this way:  crispy on the outside, and meltingly tender on the inside.  I'll never cook wings at a higher temp ever again.

These wings were out of this world. Very easy to make. Loved the longer cooking time at lower temperature. Managed to hide a few for reheating the next day...even better. Thanks for a great recipe.

These were not as "kickin" as I hoped they would be.  Marinaded them overnight in the pasty marinade, but they were still very bland.  They smelled great cooking and the little bit of flavor they did have was very good.  I don't know how to rescue these.  Maybe some vinegar in the marinade to help it penetrate?

These are very good.  My family couldn't stop eating them.  I paired this dish with baked beans and coleslaw for an overall yummy meal.

The sauce has a fresh and flavorful taste.  

Following are the changes I made or will make the next time I make these:

1.  Use fresh jalapeno instead of pickled.  I did and it is the way to go for added fresh taste.  

2.  Make more sauce than the recipe calls for.  The chicken can be somewhat dry if you use all of the sauce prior to roasting.  This sauce is so good that you can use the extra for dipping and added moisture after they are done cooking.

3.  Rotate the wings every 30 minutes.  I neglected to do this and while they were quite good, they ended up being kind of burnt on one side and not very crisp on the other.

Overall,  an excellent recipe and I will make again.

These were very good wings. I couldn't believe how moist and tender they were! I only had one pound of wings, so I followed the conversion for 2 servings. I didn't have any green onions, so I just left that out. And I only let it marinate for about two hours. I served this over white rice with raisins cooked in-this gave a little balance to the spice. I was not expecting it to be very spicy, due to other reviews, and they were right. But my husband and I found it a unique, flavorful burn. I suggest liberally adding salt once it is on your plate. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

These were very good, but I really expected the them to have more flavor and spice. I had some difficulty getting the sauce to mix in my blender. I had to add extra oil. Even then, it would have been difficult to dip the wings and have any sauce left over. I marinated my wings in a freezer bag and removed all the air to allow the most contact with the marinade.

First of all the presentation was not so good. The wings were a very odd and unappealing green color. Beyond that the flavor was bland and in no way "Kickin"

These were the most delicious wings I have ever made. I could not believe that they turned out crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yummy !! My husband loved them, great snack while he watched the World Series.

If I could give these wings 6 stars, I most certainly would.  They are  wonderfully tender and delicious; I love the flavor of jerk (don't make these if you don't have this spice mixture!) especially combined with green onion and jalepeno. Short of a trip to Jamaica, well, nothing could be more IRIE on a chilly Minnesota day......or on a warm one, for that matter!

I prepared this recipe last week and it was delicious. I did not have jalapeno peppers so I used Habernaro peppers instead. I also did not have fresh ginger and used ground ginger. They were delicious. I am preparing them again today. :0)

I made this as a sauce for Restaurant-Style Chicken wings (recipe from this site) as an additional offering of sauce instead of just Buffalo...  GOOD!  Very different...  Used Pampered Chef seasoning...

What a wonderful recipe! When I blended everything together I was just sure it wasn't enough for all the chicken.  I put it all in the baggy with the wings and sure enough there was plenty of sauce. I love the slow cooking, just wonderful and the taste was amazing!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made a few modifications based on the other reviews and it was perfect! I kept all the ingredients the same except I added about 2 tbsp extra of the jerk seasoning because someone complained that the wings could get dry. I also used fresh jalepenos. I wanted these wings very spicy so I kept adding jalepenos to the blender until I was satisfied (it was about 4 or 5). I marinated in a ziplock bag overnight.  I was a little worried about the cooking time but it turned out fine. I did turn the wings every 1/2 hour and also spoon the sauce on every time I turned them. I had some left over the next day and it was even better. If I was serving this to guests, I would cook it the night before. NOTE: I think some people were confused about the jerk seasoning. This is not dry seasoning like McCormicks. It's more of a wet rub like Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning. I like to use 4 tbsp of the mild Walkerswood and 1 tbsp of the spicy. Thanks for the recipe!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but these wings came out green.  Perhaps too much marinate, but the flavor was good.  Because of the color I may not make these wings again!

I'm a wing freak and these were absolutely the best.  I always have wings as one of many appetizers for parties and these are going on the menu as a repeat for the second time in a row.

I love this recipe, with one huge difference, I made my own jerk seasoning, (spicy), with another recipe from this sight. I would find it bland as many others have commented if I had not.I let them marinade overnight, and for the last 2 mins cooking time I put them under the broiler and got them extra crispy, nice!

I made this tonight for the first time.  I did make some changes, but not so much to the ingredients in the recipe.  I did halve the recipe because there are only two of us.  The only other change I made was to leave out the jalapenos.  I use McCormack's Jamaican Jerk seasoning quite a bit, and thought it would be spicy enough without the peppers.  I was right, for our taste.

What I did differently was the time marinading.  By the time I found the recipe I didn't have time to go to the grocery and then marinade the wings.  I got a bag of frozen wings, and put the jerk directly on the chicken wing pieces, and popped them in the oven at 400 degrees for an hour.

They were fabulous!  My husband said they were the best chicken wings he'd ever eaten, and suggested we have people over during the NCAA tournament to have some!  

I've put myself on a strict diet, so I did some calculations to make sure I stayed within the 230 calories given in the nutrition section of this recipe, and figured I could have 4 chicken wing pieces.  I served it with black beans and rice (I had 1/2 cup serving and it's more than you think), and it was a great dinner.  I didn't feel at all deprived.

I will be making this again and again because we both love Caribbean food.  Thanks so much for this wonderful and easy recipe!!!!

OK I am not a huge Hot lover, but my hubby is. He loved these. Didn't burn the hell out of him, but he liked them a lot. Kinda middle ground. Too spicey for me. But him and the boys loved them. Even the Jamaican in the crowd loved them.
