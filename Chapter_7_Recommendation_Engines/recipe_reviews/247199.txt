I love garlic, avacado and this dip. Quick, easy and just the right taste for me. I added Penzy's lemon pepper seasoning to make it just right!

basis was good but it needed a lot more seasoning.  I added lemon juice, onion powder, parsley, and perfect pinch seasoning in garlic herb. was very creamy and simple as written but for my taste I needed more flavor.
