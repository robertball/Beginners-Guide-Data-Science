These are not your typical fajita but they're really good!  I did a full pound of flank steak and it made 8 fajitas.  If you use minced garlic cloves there's no need for garlic powder. I used a full jalapeno.  

I really loved the corn, onion, pepper concoction!  I doubled the amount of corn because I love corn.  The pablano was super mild and I couldn't even really taste it on the fajitas at all.  I think next time I'll try using a green bell pepper instead.

The marinade is awesome - I thought it was going to be a not so nice flavor because the smell was putting me off BUT it was great. I let it soak in the marinade overnight (because by the time I started cooking it was late and I didn't know it even let it marinate lol) - it only calls for an hour to 4 hours however. The steak held its moisture well while cooking. (I cooked it on top of the stove by the way because I don't own a grill)
