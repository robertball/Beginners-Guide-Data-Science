I added some BBQ sauce, and took first place in a local chili cook off with this recipe three years ago. Very good.

The original recipe was much spicier. Allrecipes changed my original recipe. I used baby portabella mushrooms, more chili powder, more paprika, more garlic, and sweet italian sausage. I also did not use the liquid with canned diced tomatoes, I like my chili thick, not runny.
Thank you for the great reviews!!

The recipe was good but I thought it needed more spice. I added several tablespoons of Tabasco Chipolte sauce. I also added canned and rinsed red kidney and white navy beans.  I thought it turned out very good. Men at a church wild game feast ate it all, so it must have been good.

Didn't have any Italian sausage, so spiced up some breakfast sausage w/ no problems. Also added another pound of ground venison; it was a little too saucy. Made for a friend watching her diet and she loved it!

I added lots of barbeque sauce to give it more flavor.
