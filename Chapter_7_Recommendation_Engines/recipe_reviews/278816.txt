How simple and yummy! I can't believe I hadn't tried roasting cabbage before. I used it as a filling for piroshki.

I used olive oil, garlic powder and black pepper.  I did my corned beef in the pressure cooker and this made the cabbage come out wonderful.  It was much better than the limp cabbage I usually make.
