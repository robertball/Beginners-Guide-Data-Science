This recipe is fast & easy.  I did make one change though, instead of mixing all of the ingredients in the baggy I put the garlic in with the butter, layed all the slices out on a cutting board & sprinkled both sides with the spices. I tried the baggy thing but the wet garlic & the dry ingredients made a paste so it did not coat the pieces like it said it would. They turned out great.

This was very quick, simple, and delicious!  I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and sprinkled the spices onto the pork instead of shaking it. My maple syrup was the regular kind. I've honestly never seen sugar free maple syrup.  We really enjoyed this and I will definitely make it again!

My family loved this.  I think the net time I make it, because we love the flavor of mape.  I will marinade it first...at least a couple of hours and then add in the remaining ingredients.

I agree with Sara.  This was fast and easy but I ditched the baggy.  Pretty darn good.

My family tried this recipe. My husband loved it, and even my son, who's a picky eater. We'll definitly be adding this to our collection of favorites.

Flavor was ok, but did not win me over.  But I didn't like the texture of the chops. It was tough...I find it hard to get tender pork chops without marinating for hours.
