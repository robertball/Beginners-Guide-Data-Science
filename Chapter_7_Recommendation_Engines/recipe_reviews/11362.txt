I chose this recipe for my preschooler's cooking class. We 1/2'd the recipe for practice at home, omitting the nuts to make it as easy as possible on the teachers! My husband, whom grew up eating peanut butter balls, was very impressed! His mother never used the graham crackers and it was a great touch! Measurements were excellent, not too sticky or soft to eat right after rolling the balls. Thanks for a great recipe! We will be making this one for a long time! I will be trying some rolling variations (coconut, powdered cocoa, nuts, etc) in the future!

This is an easy recipe, with little mess involved. The combo of pb and honey reminded me of the pb sandwiches Mom used to make...I didn't put nuts in mine, and used 1/2 cup rice crisp cereal instead of the graham crackers, and they turned out fine.  Make sure to cover these in the fridge or they'll dry out!

Really yummy pb balls!  I forgot to get the graham crackers at the store so I skipped them.  I'm glad I did because it was so hard to stir without them. I couldn't imagine stirring it with even more dry and sticky ingredients.  They would also be good rolled in other nuts or chocolate sprinkles.  Next time I'll try a variety of coatings.

This recipe was very sweet. The honey overpowered the peanut butter too much

I don't know anyone who loves peanut butter more than my husband! I made these for him and he loved them. His only suggestion was to add more peanut butter.  
Note:I left out the nuts & used natural peanut butter.

I remember when my mom would make these--usually with some added mess, from the three of us rambunctious kids!  (She never added the graham crackers or walnuts, but that tastes good, too.)  I searched and searched for a recipe to share with my hubby and kids (when we have them), and just to eat when the mood struck me.  This is it!!!  I highly recommend it as a fun, rainy-day activity that is also edible--think non-salty play-dough!  With a few raisins, pretzel sticks, sunflower seeds, etc., the bored kids can become messy, happy, creative kids!  Enjoy!

Yum!  I did 2/3 cup pb and 1/3 cup honey.  I also replaced the walnuts with coconut.  These would also be good dipped in chocolate.

perfect ratio of powered milk to peanut butter to honey. I saw that in another recipe, too. I did one batch with chocolate chips and then rolled them in the graham cracker crumbs. I did another with dried cranberries and rolled them in coconut flakes. Mine were the size of small sausages.

I made these a lunch box addition by wrapping them burrito-style in waxed paper deli sheets and taping the end closed. Way cheaper than zip-loc bags.

As written, that was way too dry.  I had to double the peanut butter and honey.  It was okay after that.

My mom always used to make these for us; they're one of my favorite treats. That said, I'd halve the amount of dry milk powder and just do half a cup-- it's too dry otherwise.

Perfect as written!  Well I did roll in some pecan meal instead of walnuts, and some I left plain.  I searched for this today because for some reason I was thinking about a PB ball that was served to us at our elementary school - decades ago - so I wasnt even sure what to look for.  But this is so very very close, if not it!!  I can't wait to share it with my sisters sometime, to see if they remember this yummy little ball of goodness from our childhood.  Thank you so much for sharing!!

Great recipe, especially for kids... I add extra powdered milk to mine to make them easier to roll into balls & not be sticky as we don't coat them with anything... my 10 & 8 year old love 'em... so do I... we've always liked peanut butter... my mom use to stir peanut butter & honey together & put 'em on saltine crackers! =)

I make these with all organic ingredients and substitute raw agave nectar for the honey (doesn't spike blood sugar as much).  My family gobbles these up!

The peanut butter balls were great and very easy to make.  They were a hit at our holiday party.  Next time I am going to cover them in vanilla almond bark.  I can't wait to try them again.

Coming out great.  I substituted 3/4 cup finely shredded coconut instead of 1 cup dry milk powder, to produce a non-dairy (lactose free) version.  At 3/4 cup coconut (and I'm using natural peanut butter) it makes a very firm dough, and still quite yummy.   I'm using commercial graham crackers, and no nuts.  The exact flavor also depends on the type of honey used; while I'm finding standard brown honey a bit overpowering, I plan to try a later batch with raw unfiltered honey, which has a different flavor and blends will with natural peanut butter.  I do suggest working your wet ingredients together first, stirring well, and then gradually folding in the dry.  Expect a really firm dough.  It will get hard to stir.

This recipe is very easy and very delicious.  I didn't have graham crackers, but they turned out fine without them.  I rolled half in powdered sugar and half in cocoa.  Since I'm a peanut butter fiend, I'll add more peanut butter next time, but this is an easy, quick recipe that gives me a peanut butter fix--and some protein and calcium while I'm at it.

VERY good!  Just like a recipe I had many years ago and lost.  Be careful what kind of honey you use.  I suggest wildflower versus clover which has a much lighter flavor.  I used store bought clover honey and it really did overpower the balls.  But it seems to overpower everything.  Thanks for the great recipe!
