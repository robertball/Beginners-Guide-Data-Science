One word of advice if you're going to try these: don't let the spoonfuls get too big, or they won't cook through without getting too done. I haven't got a deep fryer, so I just heated some canola corn oil to the prescribed temperature in a pot, which worked well enough. I also didn't have self rising flour or self rising cornmeal mix, so I looked up an online substitute for both which involved adding a little baking powder and some salt. It worked fine. They aren't hard, so if these sound good to you, have at them.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. It's good for breakfast with tea. However, they don't store very well and are not good for leftovers.

I'm giving these five stars because they are so darned quick and easy to make. The flavor is pretty good. They sort of taste like a spice cake, with a hush puppy sort of look and texture. I ate something similar recently at a Krystal's restaurant that were called "Sweet Bites". I have a Vitamix blender, so I put some granulated sugar and cinnamon in it and ground it up to the consistency of powdered sugar. I put the sugar on a plate, and just threw them on top of the sugar when they came out of the oil. I think my family is really going to like them (they are all taking naps right now!). Thanks for a great recipe!!

These are good... I added some Anise extract to mine instead of the cinnamon/nutmeg, then topped with sprinkled powdered sugar
