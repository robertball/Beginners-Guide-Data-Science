Did not like this. First time I ever had gizzards and I doubt I'll ever eat them again.

Although I do not eat this I have made it twice for the holidays for family and friends, and they all love it! I actually put my own twist to it with the seasoning..so this might make a big difference in the preparation. I wanted to add my own recipe on the app, but I have no clue on how to do it. Good luck!
