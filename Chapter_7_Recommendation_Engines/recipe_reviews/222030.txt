This is so good! I didn't have any brown sugar so I left it out and I also didn't have green onion so I used regular white onion and added just a pinch of paprika instead which added a little kick to it! With out the sugar the lemon stands out but I served it over plain white rice to balance out the intense flavors. Overall, delicious!

Delicious! I didn't use the garlic and brown sugar because I didn't have time to go to the store, but it was still good and the family loved it!

This is unbelievably great!  Was looking for a non breaded/fried catfish recipe for my health conscious boys and this was fantastic!  Plenty of flavor even without the lemon and sugar at the end. Used minced white onions instead of the green like other reviewers did.  Made it x6 to accommodate the big Costco pack and worked perfectly!

This was a very quick and easy dish, so I'd definitely make it again when I need to make something fast. Personally, it was a little too sweet for me, so I added a little more salt.

If I was a catfish fan I would have given this recipe 5 stars. 
But my wife and I are not catfish fans!  We only got this by mistake when the guy at the store confused our package of red snapper with the order of customer next to us who was getting catfish fillets!  So I came to Allrecipes and luckily found this recipe.

I made this recipe with a few minor changes:  Didn't have green onion or fresh garlic so I used a bit of yellow onion and garlic powder instead. Also, I cut the amount of sugar down to a scant two tablespoons.  Coupled with the  onion (and a couple dashes of onion powder for luck,)  this makes a sauce that complements the catfish fillets really well.    The sweetness of the onion and sugar is a delightful counter to the pong of a fish that lives in turbid waters. 

I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a break from the standard catfish in cornmeal.

I followed this recipe because I wanted to try cooking catfish without deep frying it. This recipe was really easy to follow and the taste was absolutely amazing.  I will definitely  keep it and use it again. Bravo!!

We had this recipe tonight. It is fantastic. Make sure you add enough pepper. I peppered both sides of the cat fish also. I also used a yellow onion chopped small. I had chopped garlic in a jar so I put in a heaping tablespoon.  Serve with rice and corn.
 Put rice on plate, add some pan juices, add cat fish on top then add more pan juices from pan on fish then put corn on top. Oh it is so yummy. I can't wait to have it again.

Really good! The sauce goes really well with the fish. I did a lot of compromising but it was still great! No words, just try it!

Just right! Not too lemony, not too sweet. After asking how in the world I had made such a great sauce, my husband couldn't believe that the lemon and sugar, with a little butter, oil, garlic, and seasonings could be so grandiose to him. He simply couldn't stop informing me how much he loved the sauce on this fish (and it was oh, so easy) - but keep in mind when I say that, even though he loved the sauce, the sauce, as it is written in the recipe, is just thin and runny. If that bothered anyone, they could add some corn starch to the sauce just before serving. THIS WOULD BE GOOD ON RICE, I THINK, SINCE THE SAUCE WOULD DRIZZLE INTO THE RICE. I followed the recipe the first time, and was pleased.  Next time I would substitute one small minced onion for the green onions, then garnish the serving platter or the plates with green onions. I'm not sure if I will thicken the sauce ever or not.  It might depend on my mood, or how the sauce settles into the rice next time. The dish in and of itself was really yummy as is.  For guests I might include some red pepper with the sauteed onion. I had hoped to serve the fish with bread rolls alongside a large salad. That wasn't the best plan since the sauce is really half of the feature with this fish.  However, I didn't even get to make the bread and salad.  The rest of dinner was just a bunch of half baked ideas here and there using up leftovers, but it was all a hit just because of the fish!  Thanks for saving my dinner, Shelli!
