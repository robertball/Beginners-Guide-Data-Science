I loved this dish and surprisingly, so did my BF.  I left out the bacon completely and used light mayo but kept the rest of the recipe exactly the same.  I will definitely make this again but next time, I will try FF mayo and maybe a sprinkling of parmesan.

Very good.  I used real crab instead of imitation and I actually think it would have been better with the imitation as it would have had more "meatiness" to it.  But very good!

I used this recipe alongside Lasagna and it was pretty good. I did not make ahead, although discovered that I could have. This salad held up really well and actually tasted great 2 days later. I couldn't get the crab meat to "flake" so I just used a random chop. I doubled the recipe with no trouble at all.
Great salad for a buffet!

I halved this to use up a half pound of imitation crab.  It was very good even without the bacon.  I added a little paprika for color at the end and served it on some romaine lettuce.  Refreshing summer meal.

I really enjoyed this.  If you like crab meat it is a nice change of pace.  I have made it for work lunches and topped a green salad or mixed veggies with it.  I used turkey bacon and reduced fat mayo... added some salt and pepper.  Very good!

I had a package of imitation crab that needed to be used up before it went bad and I found this recipe. Simply delicious!!!!  Added a little chopped red onion and about a tsp of white vinegar, but it was really good even without those additions.

I am not a crab person, so I made this for my family.  I added more mayo (Miracle whip) and small pasta shells for more of a dinner.  My 7 year old had seconds and then finished her sister's plate.  :)  I say it was a sucess.

My whole family loved this meal.  I forgot the onion powder, but will include that and Parmesan cheese next time.  In addition, I used plain yogurt instead of mayo and it was really tasty.  Would make it again! (But probably a bigger bathc.)

I thought something was missing when I made this, so I added a little bit of curry powder and it gave this salad the right kick! I could have gone without the bacon though. Even using turkey bacon gave it too much of a meaty flavor. Other than that, this recipe is delicious and I will surely be making it again!

I had bought a package of imitation crab that I had purchased for another dish however plans changed and I never made the original dish and so I went looking for a recipe that I could use the crab.  This is a great recipe simple to make and will go in my favorite file.  The only change I made was I diced a sweet onion and put it in the skillet just before I turned off the burner and let the onion soak up some of the bacon grease.

Very good.  I added a tbsp. of sugar a bit of milk and some cider vinegar to the mayonnaise which gave it a little extra flavor, but either way it is a very nice salad.

Wow!  This is such a simple recipe & it's so good!  Everyone wanted to know what was in this awesome salad.  I added 1 tsp of cumin the next time I made it & it was really good.  Next time I'm going to try a bit of worceshire sauce, I bet that would be awesome.

This one's a keeper for me. Made a few modifications to make it a bit healthier: used Morningstar "bacon" and light mayo. (Did use imitation crab.) With those changes, it's only 150 calories per 1/2 cup serving.

We cooked up some tortillas and used this as the filling...really good stuff.

Loved this recipe! We added more peas and extra bacon because we had it. I also used a Hidden Valley Ranch packet with Mayo instead of the onion powder. We will definitely be making it again!

this was really good...my family enjoyed it...I did add some garlic powder and pepper to taste, and also a splash of worchestersire sauce...great on a soft croissant with some butter lettuce and mustard...delish!~~update: I've since used lean ham cut into small cubes in place of the bacon, and used a 1/4 cup light sour cream and a 1/4 cup light mayonnaise to make this a healthier meal...just as tasty too!

I gave it 3 stars because it was very bland and dry. I ended up adding 1/4 cup more mayo, 1/4-1/2 cup sour cream, salt, pepper, fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup finely chopped celery and a pinch more onion powder. I only had 12oz of crab meat and didn't use as much peas as the recipe called for.......turned out pretty good. Crab, peas and bacon is such a good combo....ENJOY!!!!

Fairly bland, even though I added a lot of fresh parsley and extra onion powder.  I used organic frozen peas, which were definitely better than canned.

Great recipe!  I didn't have enough peas so I put in 1/2 C celery and 1/4 C diced onion.  It was the hit of the potluck.

Very good! easy to make. If you don't want to go to the trouble of cooking up the bacon, you can use the REAL bacon bits found in the salad are of the grocery store.

I would give it three stars as-is, we just felt it was a little bland and lacking something. ** When I made it the second time I used half ff mayo and half ff sour cream, added two stalks of diced celery, two chopped green onions (whites and greens, no onion powder) and a handful (maybe 1/4 cup) of sliced almonds. We don't eat bacon, so that was also substituted with veggie bacon. I spooned it into pocket bread and my boys gobbled it up. Thank you for the base recipe!

My family all rated this recipe a thumbs up.  Easy summer salad to make.  Definitely more tasty on the second day as the flavors combine.  Used diced onion instead of onion powder, and peppered bacon was a nice addition.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I use to make a similar recipe but this one is way better.  I changed it a little by adding lettuce and serving it in a toasted hot dog bun (Crab Roll).  It’s a great summer meal when it’s to hot to cook.  It goes excellent with lots of crunchy veggies.  This is my new crab roll recipe.  Thanks Theresa

Made it many times following the exact recipe, and love it. Super-easy to make and addictive. Can be made without bacon, but not the same though - bacon definitely takes it to the next level.

My husband and I absolutely love this. The recipe is easy, tastes great, and has a lot of flavor with not too much mayo.
I also found that the type of imitation crab meat used is very critical to the taste. I use the Osaki brand "fish cake" from my local Chinese supermarket and tear them into pieces by hand. The juice really comes out during this process and gives the final product a great flavor.

Was looking for a quick and easy crab salad and I found it! My only substitution was I used miracle whip instead of regular mayo. And I added the onion powder to the whip and mixed it before adding it to the salad. Very yummy! I think I found my go to lunch!! Think I’ll add some extra bacon and some garlic powder to kick up the garlic flavor a notch and just because I love bacon. Thanks for sharing!

The only change I would make when I make it again is to cut the flaked crab into smaller pieces. It was quick & easy to make. The mix of peas & seafood went together well so that one taste did not overpower another. I will definitely make this again.

I made one today and my Mother and I decided to make one for Thanksgiving. The only difference I brought a can of sweet peas and added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, chopped minced white onions, and chopped 1/4 of fresh cilantro.  My family loved it.

I was looking for something to make with the imitation crab I had. This looked very similiar to the pea salad that I love, so I made it.  Yummy!  I added shredded cheddar like my pea salad calls for. I will be taking this for lunch tomorrow. Delicious!!

I love pea salad and also love crab salad. I read quite a few reviews and used some tips from other posters only after I made this recipe as published. It was 5-star as published but being Southern I had to tweak it. 
I used some parsley, chopped water chestnuts, paprika, celery seed and lite mayo/lite sour cream. I also used green onion and omitted the onion powder. I used chopped garlic and real bacon bits from the supermarket. 
Someone mentioned that the crabmeat stayed too lumpy so I shredded mine with 2 forks prior to adding it to the mix. It tastes wonderful already so I can't wait to have it with dinner tonight!! I already know that I will make this again and again!  Thanks Theresa!!

This is a good base recipe for cooks to build upon, but I was skeptical of this recipe as written.  As such, I used kasia777's recommendations, as well as omitting the bacon as other reviewers suggested.  For my own touches I added some Old Bay seasoning and a little bit of Sriracha for kick.  I'll make this in some iteration again!

I was looking for something to make with the left-over imitation crab I had. I came across this recipe and thought I would try it. I used real bacon bits and tried to save on the fat by using a 1/2 low fat mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream for the dressing. It was actually better than I thought it was going to be. I did top it off with some green onions and fresh cracked pepper.

This was ok, but no more than that. I gave it 4 stars instead of what I feel it deserves (3 stars) because I substituted canned crab meat for the imitation.  It must really need the imitation, because this recipe was almost gross.  :(  I had to add some pepper and lemon to make it edible.

Hubby and I thought this was OK. Used real crab. Not sure if I like bacon with it. Maybe the imitation crab would be better. Will try again.Thanks

My family usually turns up their noses at this type of dish, but I recently made it for a potluck.  Everyone loved it, even my family.  We didn't have enough peas so we added some green onions instead of the onion powder.  Delicious.

I made this using Turkey Bacon and light mayonnaise and it was delicious.  Will definitely make again.
