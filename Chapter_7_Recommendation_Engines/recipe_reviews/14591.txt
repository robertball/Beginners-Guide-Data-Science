5 STARS IS A RIP OFF!!! This one truly deserves 10 stars! We just finished dinner and I couldn't wait to get my review in... This was incredible... Really! Absolutely incredible. I used some boneless, thick cut, pork chops which usually come out way too dry for my liking. (Especially when you do them on the grill.) Well, my hubby grilled them and we were OH SO delighted when we bit into that first bite. It was seriously the most moist chop I've ever had! HANDS DOWN!!! What I cannot believe is that just 4 simple ingredients make such a HUGE difference! The only change I made was to use "low sodium" soy sauce, and I marinated it for about 4 hours. These chops were OUTSTANDING!!! I think I'll be buying pork chops more often these days!!!

This is a good basic recipe, but should come with a warning: Do not over marinate with this recipe! Your meat will be tough and salty! I botched it cause I didn't follow the directions.
The next time I tried it, I added black pepper and 1tb brown mustard. I marinated chicken instead of beef. I liked it. I think next time I'll try adding some kind of herb like cilantro or rosemary instead of mustard.

I tried the recipe the way it is, and it's OK. But for the PERFECT steak, try adding Balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and ground pepper. It is best if the liquid ingredients are added in the same proportion, that way the saltyness of the soy sauce is not overpowering. Juicy!

What an awesome marinade recipe!  Took me 3 minutes to prepare. I marinated 2 butterfly pork chops in it for 1 1/2 hours, then grilled. I couldn't believe how wonderfully they turned out! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I used this marinade on a pork tenderloin, which Hubs grilled. Both of us are relative purists when it comes to how we like our meats, generally preferring a light seasoning over marinades.  But I like to try different things.  After trying this I still prefer no marinade at all, but I did enjoy it. Hubs, on the other hand, said it tasted like soy sauce.

Way, way, way too much soy sauce. It just over-powers everything else.

This is a good one. I add a tbsp of red wine vinegar and a tsp of worstershire sauce. If I have fresh ginger I grate a tsp in too.

This was a fantastic marinade.  I only eat red meat once or twice a year (and only then with lots of BBQ sauce), but this marinade has me craving grilled steaks and I didn't use any BBQ sauce!  It so simple and so wonderful and made the steak very tender and tasty! Thanks!

I thought this marinade was excellent.  I liked the fact that it complemented the meat (I used a couple of Delmonico steaks) and didn't over-power it like some marinades do.  My every picky husband however thought it was just so-so.  The fact that it was sooo easy and quick to make means he'll be seeing a lot more of it anyway!!

I like this recipe, I use it a couple of times a month to tenderize tougher cuts of steak.  I use it more for that purpose then for flavor, although I like the flavor.

Great recipe!! Thanks!  I have used it on tougher cuts of meat and they were great.  I will probably never make steaks without this marinade again!!  I wanted to add to my review...we almost ALWAYS use this for pork chops and call it "fake steak" it is MUCH cheaper to do than steaks all of the time.  We LOVE it!!

This was absolutely delicious.  I was in a real time crunch so was looking for a very fast marinade and this one fit the bill.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I modified it by adding about 1/4 c. honey.  DH and the kids loved it too.

Been using this for years, only I usually use white/red wine in place of the lemon for steaks.  Always great and we use with all meat...great as a rib marinade to if you like a dry rib on the grill...My family likes it so much that the ribs hardly ever make it to the table, they are gone straight off the grill!!

Excellent marinade, perhaps the best ever!  My old recipe was similar, but this recipe even beats my old one, I am recommending this to all my family and friends.  Also is very easy!

After reading several of the other reviews I decided to try this recipe with a few modifications.  The first being I only used 1/2 of the amount of soy souce called for.  (1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup.)  The second, which is what I think made the most difference, was the addition of 1/8 cup of orange blossom honey.  It turned out to be a wonderful marinade that my husband really enjoyed!

This was okay, but not fabulous.  I tried it with chicken.  The lemon juice chemically cooked the chicken before I put it on the grill - that was a little odd.  I think this recipe is better for beef.

I've made this a couple times now and it's really very good.  I like to get a typically tough cut of meat and this marinade tenderizes it and adds great flavor.  Last night I marinated a London broil.  It was juicy and tender.  Everyone loved it!

For a healthier version, substitute the traditional soy sauce with Liquid Amino... tastes the same but major health boost!

Basic marinade but nothing special. Soy and olive oil is the base and then you add whatever you want per your taste.  Don't want it to get too salty?  Use Kikkoman Light Soy.  Why Kikkoman?  Because it's brewed right here in Wisconsin!

We use it all the time on a variety of different meats - flank to New York - and love it. I like garlic, so I tend to use more.

TRULY THE BEST!  My husband is a big game hunter and I run out of ideas on how to fix the meat. I used this marinade on his elf and wild boar and he is still raving over it - a week later!  Thank you!

While this recipe was really easy - it was WAY to salty and had no variation in flavor.  I added some orange juice to add a little sweetness to it, but it didn't help enough.  It also didn't really do anything for the tenderness of the beef.

This is really good. I've made it twice - once exactly as the recipe states, and once using lime juice instead of lemon. Both are delicious! I'll be making this again and again.

This is the only marinade I use on steaks and the only change I make is to add freshly ground pepper.

Usually put the steaks (most often strip loin) and marinate in a ziplock in the morning and grill them for supper that evening.  The steaks sear nicely and are juicy and tender. Delicious!

I use this all the time, but I don't use the lemon juice, and substitute Italian dressing for the olive oil.

This is one "Incredible" basic Marinade.  The key is not to over cook the meat.  Tried it – using a “less sodium” Soy Sauce - on a typically tough piece of pork and the resulting meat was as tender as a filet mignon.  My domestic partner was as impressed as I, she having tasted many of my past efforts with some distaste.  Also did wonders with chicken.  This is a keeper to be experimented with.

Like others have suggested, I used lite soy sauce for my chicken marinade. I also added a bit of ginger. Great flavor if you're a fan of soy sauce!

Great on beef, would not use it on chicken. A friend put 1/2c sugar in hers, soy sauce taste wasn't as strong and it was good. I prefer the original recipe!

I let this marinate over night and they were absolute heaven. I marinated steaks for Valentines dinner and my husband asked if they were hard, when I replied that they were VERY easy. He responded "good, then we can have them a lot more often!"

This marinade makes me a star!  Everyone
always asks me for the recipe.  I used 
it on a really inexpensive cut of beef, 
and it turned out so tender my family 
thought they were getting sirloin.

I am sure the marinade is good based on the reviews. It went wrong for me somewhere, may have been the lemon ratio (small lemon v. medium lemon).

The taste was amazing. I like my steak to be juicy and well cooked. This marinade kept as juicy as I like it and helped cooking the steak to perfection. I through away my A1 sauce, as I don't need it anymore.

Excellent!!! Cannot believe that this simple marinade improved the taste of thick pork chops so much!!! Sometimes I am So temperature conscious that I end up over cooking our chips and steaks.  The combination of these 4 ingredients seemed to insure perfectly grilled entrees!  Loved it ....so easy!

Fantastic marinade. 
Made it as written except an extra clove of garlic.
Let the sirloins set for an hour then 7 minutes a side on a medium heat grill.

Wonderful

My grandfather taught me this marinade 35yrs ago. I’ve been using it ever since. It works great on both chicken and pork as well. The thicker the meat, the longer the soak. Full size bone in chicken breasts work best with an overnight soak. I find ziplock bags work best since all sides of the meat are in constant contact with the marinade. One other trick works wonders. Buy yourself a Jacquard hand held meat tenderizer. Run this through the meat before you marinate. The tiny piercings will allow the meat to soak up more marinade in less time.

My Husbands go to marinade for many years except he always used lime juice instead of lemon. Lots of garlic & cracked pepper.  Excellent on rib eyes & boneless skinless chicken thighs.  I don’t believe he used any oil though. We definitely always had compliments.

Made this exactly as written (except only had garlic powder and used equivalent) it was so so good. I loved it, my kids loved it. We used it in Ribeyes and will try it in chicken and pork chops. Can't wait to use it again!

My family has been making this marinade for steaks for 30-40yrs! It's especially good on london broil and does a great job tenderizing cheaper/tougher cuts of meat while making them super flavorful.

Hands down best steak marinade I've ever made. I added about a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and let my sirloin tip steaks marinade about 8 hours. Spectacular!

Best Marinade around in deed!! I made it exactly as directed and enjoyed every bit of my grilled pork tenderloin! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you H. Roberts for sharing it with all of us!

made it last night for steak. I put a bit less soya, used lemon juice instead of a lemon, and added about a half cup of orange juice. I also marinated it longer, as it was steak. it was great.

Best Marinade All Around Haiku: "Way too much soy sauce, threw off balance with its salt. Reduce it by half." I made the recipe as written and marinated two small chicken breasts in it for 2 hrs., but found that after grilling, the soy sauce was just over-powering. If it was in the same ratio as the olive oil, I think it would've been better, or perhaps low-sodium instead of regular.

Very good marinade especially because it has no sugar in it. This I think could be used on chicken and pork as well.  Maybe adding some different herbs would vary the flavor so it could be used often. Very good for people who have to be on a high protein, no carb, no sugar diet.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I used it on porkchops and they came out extremely tender. I don't make them often because they're usually so tough. My family went back for seconts & thirds. I didn't have any lemon so I used orange juice instead and it was great. I cant wait to try this recipe on steaks on the grill. It was very easy to put together and I'm sure you could add so many different seasonings depending on your preference and it would be just as good.

I used light soy sauce it was still too salty. Definitely cut down on the soy sauce if you don't like your steak so salty. Otherwise, it was a delicious marinade. I cooked bell peppers in the remaining marinade from my steaks and it turned out good but quite sour, more so than the marinaded meat. I guess bell peppers soak up lemon juice better than steak. Will try to water down the remaining marinade for bell peppers next time.

This recipe really lives up to it's name!  I used low sodium soy sauce and it was just delicious.  We couldn't believe how tender the meat was.  My husband, who is an A-1 sauce disciple, said he didn't need any - thanks!!

At first I was concerned it would be too salty because of the 1/2 cup soy sauce but that wasn't the case for me.  Very good.

This marinade was pretty tasty, but the flavor lacked complexity. Still, you can't beat the quick & easy nature of this recipe and the results we're quite good.

This marinade is so simple to prepare and tastes really good.  I added some water to make it go farther and used it to marinate beef and veggies for kabobs.  It was wonderful.  Especially yummy on the mushrooms after soaking the marinade up all day long.

I liked the flavoring, and it went really well with bbq sauce.  I thought that the soy sauce was a little too strong and it covered up the other flavorings.  If I made it again, I'd probably double the amount of lemon and halve the soy sauce.

I used this recipe at a bbq. I used my best home grown angus steaks, which are great, and people said that the marinade taste was wonderful. I let them marinate longer than suggested out of necessity. I would definitly recomend this one.
