I made the shrimp in the marinade as written but decided I didn't want to use the sauce just for dipping so I added 2 tablespoons of coconut milk to it and served it over rice noodles instead. This was just an outstanding meal, thank you for posting it.

Yum! I followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving the prawns in the marinade for about an hour and a half (unexpected store run). Excellent! I'm thrilled that I have leftover vinaigrette for steak salad this week. Thanks!!

This sauce tastes very similar to one I've made for a Mongolian hot pot dinner, but turned out significantly thinner, which led me to use a tsp. of cornstarch and water to quickly thicken it a touch. The flavor is actually so impeccable that making the marinade isn't really necessary, so I'll definitely be skipping that step next time around. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was the BEST peanut sauce I have tried and it complimented the shrimp (and I added chicken as well) perfectly.  My family was over and it was a huge hit.

I didnt marinate the shrimp. I grilled them with salt and fresh ground pepper. The sauce was enough to make you want to slap someone. We added cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, but it was really awesome. Just the right spice, balanced by the peanut butter. Great recipe!

It is a pity, but this recipe didn`t work for me. The marinade was great, so spicy and delicious. I will use it for grilled shrimp. But I didn`t care for the peanut butter sauce. I didn`t have mirin and used white wine with sugar instead (a suggestion from one cooking site), maybe it was a wrong way, but this sauce had a "sweet and sour thing" I didn`t like.

This is very, very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I changed was adding coconut oil instead of peanut oil in the sauce (which is healthier and added a very subtle coconut flavor to the already delicious sauce). The sauce is a little runnier than most peanut sauces I'm used to- it's definitely more of a vinaigrette, I added a couple tsps of cornstarch and still found it a little runny- delicious over rice though! There is a pile of sauce left over... if you're just dipping the shrimp, you could probably get away with halving it.. A couple of people have mentioned skipping the marinade... do NOT do this!  The marinade is absolutely delicious with flavors of lemongrass, garlic and ginger... I marinated mine about 45 mins, and didn't wipe the chunks off the shrimp before grilling. My bf thought the shrimp was delicious and ate it on its own... I thought it complemented the flavors in the sauce wonderfully.  Yum!

We like heat so we upped the peppers a little. Wonderful flavor, grilled over charcoal and only enough for a lite lunch the next day. I will make it again but I want to try it with some coconut.

Delicious shrimp! We let our shrimp cook through completely instead of turning them... Just like Bobby Flay says--- it gave them the perfect char on one side and perfectly cooked through without being overdone.
