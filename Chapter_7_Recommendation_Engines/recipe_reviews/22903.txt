This is a very pretty cake and it was a nice presentation for my daughter's birthday. Aside from looking nice, I don't think the candy-coated chocolate pieces worked with this recipe. And the white cake paired with the whipped topping was just not a flavorful enough. I think this recipe really needs a regular frosting to give it more taste. I love the idea of this cake though and will make it again using pink tinted vanilla frosting and more of the rainbow sprinkles on top instead of the candies.

If you are looking for a quick way to WOW some kids, this is perfect.  Yes, it's a cake mix, but I made them into cupcakes, topped it with homemade butter cream, then added  more sprinkles and kids loved them.

While my daughter and I had fun making these cupcakes. the jimmies didn't spread out like other recipers did. Maybe if we would have left the batter sit out a little bit and then put them in cupcake liners, maybe that would have made a difference. We also tried to use whip topping but it spread at room temperature. It wasn't pretty. So we just another frosting recipe from the site, that was neat to do, when I combined 3 colors my daughter picked out to use to swirl on top. She had a blast. That's all that matters.

I added a twist to make it taste more like bakery-type cakes--I subtracted two teaspoons of the water and added a teaspoon each of vanilla extract and almond extract. The kids asked for canned frosting which I used instead of whipped topping. They had fun frosting the cake together and covering the cake with M&M's. They cut into it right after lunch. What fun!

We made cupcakes and used strawberry frosting and more sprinkles on top. This was very kid friendly and fun to make. Thanks for the recipe.
