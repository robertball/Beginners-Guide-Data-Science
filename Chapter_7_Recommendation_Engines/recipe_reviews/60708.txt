We thought this was very good and would not change a thing.  I was born in Germany and this is very close to authentic.  I would not recommend using any type of seasoned bread crumbs because it will really change the way it should taste with the sauce.  Thanks

Delicious, best w/pork as Veal is to bland.I've eaten it in Karlsruhe and they made it w/pork.It is a dish for people who like to cook and eat well.Yes it is authentic to Germany and dishes like Jaegerschnitzel vary from Region to Region, from Village to Village .And if the meat is tough, then it is your meat/cooking most likely it was not pounded thin enough. When I lightly brown my onions and mushrooms I then add regular flour and also brown it lightly , I then use beef-stock to make my gravy, season it again and add sour- or sweetcream whichever I have handy and I always use freshly ground carawayseeds,when I season my porkstaeks and when I prepare the gravy.

This is a wonderful dish. The only changes I would make is the cornstarch. Try only 1/2 T. The Germans do have a thinner sauce. We were also in Germany for several years, loved this dish. It most authentically should be served with a cucumber/yogurt dressing salad and pommes frites(french fries) or spaetzle. And served with spatzee which is orange crush and coke. You'll feel like you're at a German fest. I've also made this with turkey or chicken breasts (pounded real thin).

I have to admit I added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder to my flour/bread crumb mixture, and instead of using a can of mushrooms, I fried up fresh mushrooms in butter with the onions till soft, then added the cornstarch and followed with the water, bouillion and sour creme.  My family of 9 loved this!  SOOOOO much flavor.  I also went all out German and served the German Spaetzle Dumplings (from this site) along side this Jagerschnitzel.  The two dishes went together beautifully. This is easy to prepare, smells and tastes wonderful cooking-a winner of a recipe!

My husband and I recently returned from 2 weeks in the Bavarian region of Germany. I discovered Jagerschnitzel the first day and was hooked. I ate it at 4 different restaurants (from a five star restaurant down to a truck stop). It was different each time. This is an excellent version, I may add a little additional seasoning to the gravy to make it absolutely perfect. As a side note, we prefer to make Spaetzle with the schnitzel.

This recipe was a hit at my annual wine and cheese party. We had alot of german people there, and they thought it was right from Germany. I would suggest using fresh button mushrooms, instead of canned.

This is fantastic, and tastes very much like what I used to buy at the butcher shop while living in Germany!  I made two changes--used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I used the thin 'breakfast style' pork slices so that I wouldn't have to pound the meat.  To make an even thicker, crispier crust, I dipped the pork in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs, and then did that again.  I had this as the main dish for my "Oktoberfest"-themed cooking club, and it was a raving success--especially for a bunch of women who are not big fans of fried meat!  I served it with Spaetzle and Rotkohl (red cabbage).  I've made it several times for family and friends, and it turns out excellent every time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband's father was stationed with the Air Force in Germany when my husband was very young, so a lot of his "comfort food" is German.  As someone who has in lived in the South all my life, cooking is a big part of my life and I wanted to find some recipes to make for him.  This recipe was easy to do and, according to him, was what he remembered.  We had it with steak fries, a German spinach casserole and Apple Strudel.  It was a great hit with my whole family.

This was one of the very few German foods I grew up with that I actually liked, so I was eager to make this for my gang. Altho my pork was sliced very thinly, five minutes per side left the meat still very pink. I used fresh mushrooms and fat free/low sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon. Because the pork was still rare, I added a can of C of M soup to the sauce and simmered the meat in the sauce until it was done. Still in all, this was a wonderful recipe that my whole family loved. Thank you!!

WOW this was delicious!!!  I made this recipe exactly as written and was very impressed!!!  The ONLY suggestion I would make is this: start the gravy FIRST, and in the 20 minutes that the gravy has to simmer, begin to bread and fry the cutlets.  I did the cutlets first as the recipe suggested, and then as I made the gravey, the cutlets got cold.  Also I served this with Spaetzle, and poured the remaining gravy all over the spaetzel as well.  This dish also reheats nicely....lucky for me, so I got to enjoy left overs again today for lunch :)

A true 5-star recipe! The cutlets are prepared simply, but the sauce puts it over the top. Use real mushrooms and only a small onion. I also used beef broth in place of bullion cubes, and flour works just as well as cornstarch. I had the sour cream ready but I forgot to add it (whoops!), and it still came out great!

I made this schnitzel twice. Second time I used fresh mushrooms (crimoni) and vegetable stock and reduced the cornstarch. On both, as in Bavaria I used a couple of tablespoons of white wine to deglazethe pan. Good recipe. It was good to see that allrecipes.com offered scaling advice, keep it up with other tips to help the amateur cooks.

This was very very good. Please remember this calls for pork cutlets NOT pork chops!! big difference here! I doubled the recipe and kept them on low directly on the rack in the oven to keep them crisp and warm. My husband said leftover were wonderful!

I made this the other night as my first try of German food.  I made my own bread crumbs with a mix of wheat and white bread.  (Toast the bread, let cool, then grind in food processor into crumbs) I found very thin sliced pork cutlets.  I followed the directions exactly except for using fresh mushrooms.  I did put the cooked cutlets in the oven on low while I was making the gravy.  What a wonderful flavorful recipe. I was tempted to add some garlic but stuck to the recipe instead. I'm glad I did! I would describe it as a "Stroganoff" flavored gravy.  Very tasty.  Thanks for this recipe!

Came out really delicious.  I was skeptical about mixing bread crumbs(I used Panko), flour and spices in one step but it works.  I also sustituted the water for 1/2 can of German beer it gave the sauce more depth of flavor.  Thanks for a winner.

This was awesome! I've been experimenting with German fare during this month - Oktoberfest and all - and this was definitely a winner. I don't have much frame of reference here - I haven't had much German food in my lifetime, but my husband has and he loved it. I took the suggestion of serving it with french fries to soak up the gravy, and also served braised cabbage alongside it. The pork cutlets didn't look that great at the store when I went shopping, so instead I just got a pork tenderloin and sliced it myself, pounding it very thin. I followed the breading instructions exactly as written, and then deep-fried them in my fry daddy - they fried up in three minutes perfectly. So tender - and I've always had a hard time getting pork just right. This is totally going into my regular rotation.

I used to order this while stationed in Germany 36 years ago. I have tried many German/Canadian,German/American restaurants (and they were all great)but this takes the cake. FANTASTIC!   I found I used a little more veg oil when cooking and added a tiny bit of milk at the end to thin the "Jager Sauce", but the taste was absolutely fantastic. My wife loved it and wants me to keep searching this site. Thanks to the provider.

I used corn flake crumbs instead of bread crumbs and it came out great.  I find that the corn flakes blanket the pork chops much better and rarely stick to the pan.

My mother is German and I lived there for most of my life so I know a good jagerschnitzel when I try one. This recipe was great! I made a few little changes. Instead of using the beef bouillon and diced onion I substited a packet of onion soup mix. I also added a little extra sour cream and cornstarch to the juices just because I tend to like my gravy a little thicker. Excellent, my Oma would be proud :)

This became a favorite after I made it for an Oktoberfest party a few years ago.  I use fresh sliced mushrooms.  It takes longer, but well worth it.  Just simmer in the beef broth until tender and then add the sour cream.   For potlucks, I cut the pork cutletts into 2" strips, double the mushroom sauce, and keep warm in a crockpot.

This was great! I agree with the reviewers who stated this was like stroganoff. It's just a little more "fancy"! I followed the recipe exactly and served with garlic smashed taters. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I followed the directions exactly.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs.  Once the pork was browned, I put them on a plate I had warmed in the oven (I had scalloped potatoes in there cooking), then I wrapped that all up in tin foil to keep them warm on the counter while the sauce simmered.  This recipe was easier than I had thought it would be and reminded me of being in Germany.  My german husband said "This is EXCELLENT!" apon his first bite.  We told our little girls it was chicken and they ate it right up (hee hee).  Will definately make this dish again and again!

This was the first time I've made any type of schnitzel and let me tell you, it was a big hit for dinner last night.  The only changes I made were using panko crumbs and fresh sliced cremini mushrooms in place of the canned.  Will definitely be making this again and will double the recipe for certain.

I decided to try this as I heard a few people who said they really liked it on here. I had 4 kind of large pork cutlet steaks. So, I just cut them in half, so they would get throughly cooked. I did the full amount of bread crumbs, but about half of them did not get used. I thought the sauteed pork tasted fine without the sauce. I may buy some better quality cutlets and tenderize my own and try it again, just making that meat. I just really did not care for the sauce at all and found it to be way too chunky. And, the canned mushrooms just did not seem to work well in it. I wish I would have used fresh mushrooms in the sauce, that may have helped. I don't know.

I wanted to treat hubby, he works hard and was in Germany in the service.  The breading stayed on and fried up nicely. I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them along with the onions. Really yummy!  Easy to prepare and if you can find the pork steaks on sale, easy on the wallet too! Carlos thought this was Pretty good. he couldn't quite remember if this was how it tasted back in Lovely old Germany but I say, it's a winner:) Thank You Dspiral73

The schnitzel itself was wonderful, just like I recall.  The gravy was not at all what I expected, although I can't fault the recipe -- it tasted okay but more like Strogonoff than a brown Hunter sauce.  I think if served with lemon wedges for adding acid to the gravy I would have liked it better.  Regardless -- I'll make this again but will doctor the sauce significantly.

I made this spur of the moment with what I had on hand. I used pork loin chops so had to cook them a bit longer. For the sauce I'd prefer fresh mushrooms, but only had canned, and used beef stock in lieu of a cube and water. The sauce and the crust were very good, however the chops were on the dry side and lacked flavor. If I make again, I'd put the chops in with the sauce for the twenty minutes of simmering instead of leaving them out just sitting there waiting. I almost forgot I used white wine to deglaze the pan and it sure added a wonderful flavor to the gravy.

We loved it!  I do agree with a previous rater that suggested cooking the pork steaks and starting the mushrooms and onions at the same time.  

Since i took the suggestion of making french fries, I stuck the pork steaks into the oven once those were done in order to keep them warm while the gravy thickened up. 

This will be going into our rotation as well.

This recipe is so addicting!  My husband continually asks for "that pork chop and mushroom thing".

Based off the recipe as is, I give it 4 stars only because canned mushrooms are disgusting and really impacts the flavor of the rest of the ingredients.  I used them the first time I made this and have used fresh ever since.  Also I found that seasoning the flour with some salt, pepper, allspice, and garlic powder really gives it that something special.  I rarely have beef bouillon so I just use a can of chicken broth and it always comes out super.

I love this. Its now always requested at my house. Now the changes I made:  I don't not use any salt, I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and since I used vegetable broth instead of beef bouillon. And I didn't pound out my pork chops. I have made it with thick ones and thin ones, I just recomend you use boneless.  I cook mine just enough to get the outside brown and crispy and then toss them in my oven's warmer. Remember meat continues to cook even once out of the pan or off the grill   The fact that Sour Cream comes in 8oz containers works out perfect because once I make this its asked for again within a week max.

Delicious.  Made it as written with a couple of minor changes in the sauce.  Ran out of beef bouillon so used chicken and cut back on the corn starch in the sour cream.  With or without the sauce this is my new pork chop recipe.  We served it over homemade spaetzle.

This is just like Oma made it. The only thing I would change is frying the pork in butter on medium lto medium low, rather than in oil. A tblsp + of butter per batch crisps them up nicely so long as you wipe out the burned butter and crumbs between the batches.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I served it with gnocchi and green beans.  However, we thought by adding the sour cream it gave the mushroom gravy a more stroganoff flavor.  Instead of water and beef bouillon I used beef broth and instead of adding cornstarch at the end I added 2 tablespoons. of flour to the mushrooms and cooked it for a few minutes so you wouldn't taste the raw flour.  Overall, this was a great recipe and easy to do.

We decided to have a German night for dinner and try all new recipes.  This is delicious.  I substituted chicken breast tenders which did not need to be pounded in place of the pork.  Served with Hot German Potato Salad III and German Apple Cake I, along with a Romaine salad with vinaigrette dressing for some color.  Loved it and will make this again!

My husband really enjoyed this. The only things I did differently were that I used 8oz. of fresh button muhrooms, and I dredged the pork in seasoned flour, then in the egg, then in the bread crumbs. I think that the coating sticks better if you do the flour first.

This was so delicious!!!  I used a 1 lb. pork tenderloin and cut it into about 8 thick slices which I pounded thin. I did put a little garlic powder in the breading along with the salt and pepper.  I separated the cooking a little due to time constraints. I browned the onion and fresh mushrooms, added the broth and simmered 20 min, then set that aside. When I was ready to cook, I fried the pork cutlets in 2 batches (they went in the oven at 300 after cooking), then wiped the pan out and re-added the mushroom broth to finish as directed. The pork was tender, crispy, and delicious and the sauce was very mushroomy, creamy, and flavorful. Next time I will probably make the sauce mushroom free since I'm the only one who would eat it (even though it was delicious). I served this with sautéed cabbage and egg noodles. Such a good recipe for fried pork chops, even if you don't make the sauce. Thanks for this one!!!

This is me and my fiance's favourite use for pork tenderloin! I cut a tenderloin in half and pound out each piece until 1/2" thick. Although I know it's supposed to be fried, we prefer ours baked (using a cooking rack on a cooking tray) 35 mins @ 375 degrees.

WOW - this was great! We used pork cube steaks to save the beating step, and found 20 minutes was more than enough to simmer the beginning of the gravy, but followed everything else to a T. we'll have this regularly. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I served it with fries as recommended, but I think next time i'll serve noodles because the gravy reminded me of stroganoff.  We'll definitely make this one again!

This was great!  Did remind me of stroganoff but more mushroomy!  Make sure you measure the salt.  I just sprinkled it on and it was a little saltier than I like.  The mushrooms add their own salty flavor.  Will be keeping this one handy.  Fast & easy!

I've been making this for years, ever since I got my first church cookbook and found this in the "Other Countries" section. We like this best either with buttered egg noodles or fluffy mashed potatoes to soak up the gravy. My oldest boy especially likes this.

I loved this, my wife thought it was OK.  I double-dipped the meat using Panko bread crumbs and refrigerated it for 2 hours.  The pork cutlets came out perfectly, tender and juicy inside and crisp outside.  My gravy was a little lumpy, but very flavorful and a good match with french fries, as suggested.  Overall, a tasty meal and one I will serve again (whether she likes it or not!).

Bought Pork Cutlets at the butcher so I didn't have to tenderize. Was good but the sauce wasn't strong enough. I think the sour cream made it too lite. Next time I will half it.

I followed this recipe exactly and it tasted nothing like what I had when I was stationed in Germany. The picture looks good but the actual recipe looks gross. If I ever make this again, I will leave out the sour cream, onions, and I will season the meat before breading. Sorry.

This is one of my favorites!  I've made this a few times now.  My bread crumb of choice is definitely Panko and I'll often use pork chops instead of steaks or cutlets since the chops are easier to find.  If it's just me eating I'll omit the mushrooms.  If I were making 4 nice size chops I'd double the sauce since that is the best part.

I've never tried this before so I cannot vouch for its authenticity. I REALLY liked the mushroom/onion/sour cream topping, and the breading was pretty tasty, but the pork was soooo tough and chewy. I threw mine away. I would like to try this again with chicken.

I used panko bread crumbs and fat free sour cream. We just got back from Octoberfest and he couldn't stop raving about this recipe--this will be a staple in our house.  Now if I could only make beer!

I also remember Jagerschnitzel as having a thinner, browner sauce, and don't remember sour cream in it.  Otherwise, it brought me right back to the years we lived in Germany: Jagerschnitzel was what I always ordered, with spaetzle, and celery root salad.  Delicious!!!

This is great! I add 2 tsp. or either garlic powder or minced garlic to the sauce. My family loves garlic.

I'm not the best cook but I am trying to work on it. I have german heritage and I remember growing up with my grandmother cooking amazing dishes so when I seen this I was super excited to try it. I made it for dinner tonight and it was a hit! It was a easy recipe and delicious. I made cheesy ranch potato bake as my side.

This is absolutely one of our favorite pork dishes. The only changes I have made to the recipe is to use beef broth instead of the water and bouillon, I often use sliced pork tenderloin instead of cutlets or steaks, and I often use garbanzo bean flour instead of cornstarch. This recipe is wonderful as written, and my changes are to add nutrients and what I have on hand.

Darn good! The only thing I had to do differently was use medium-lowish heat instead of med-high like the recipe stated. Med-high burnt the coating on the pork before the meat could cook all the way through. This may not be as much of a problem for others though as I do have a pretty kick butt stove top! Will def be making this again!

This was very good. It tasted very traditional and Old World. I do happen to like the Mushroom Pork Chop recipe from this site better. The reason? I think the taste of the cream of mushroom soup and wine make a better sauce than the sour cream/beef broth combo.

I made this for my husband after he tried jagerschnitzel at a German restaurant. He was very scared to try it after hearing the ingredients and seeing that it looked different from the original jager sauce he had, but he liked it. He actually added a little bit of Amber Bock into it and let it simmer which he said made it taste great!

This recipe is delicious.  I did not have sour cream so I improvised and used condensed milk with the corn starch and cooked it down until it was thicker - gravy consistency.  Very good recipe!!! I would not have changed a think if it were not for the fact I did not have sour cream on hand.  Thank you for sharing!!!!

I have never had jagerschnitzel before, and have no idea whether or not this recipe is authentic, but it was definitely delicious!! I had bought boneless pork chops, not realizing that the cutlets were thinner, so I pounded them out and put them in the oven after browning them in the oil. Since the gravy had to simmer for 20 minutes anyway, I just cooked them in the oven at 375 F until the gravy was ready. They came out great and tasted amazing! I will definitely be making this again!

LOVED this recipe.  Not quite like my great grandma's but with a little tweaking I think I can get there.  I used beef stock instead of the water and bouillon.  That was the only change I made.  The sauce was fantastic!  I will be making this again.

This was a pretty good schnitzel recipe. I would give it 5 stars except for the fact it is very easy to burn. When the pork is pounded thin, it really only takes 2-3 minutes per side to cook. Any longer and the breading burns. The only other note I would make is to dice your onions fairly large for the gravy. If you dice them too small, they tend to melt into the gravy while cooking, making the onion flavor of the sauce a little too strong. I'll still make this again, but I may tweak a few things next time - and maybe improve on my pan frying skills a bit...

This was good, but a little bland.  Not the type of Jagerschnitzel that makes you say "it's great".  It helped to add lemon before it was served.

This was absolutely delicious just as written.  I did use egg beaters for the egg and fresh mushrooms and fat-free sour cream, but otherwise followed the recipe.  After frying the pork I put in a 200 degree oven to keep warm while frying the onions and mushrooms and simmering in the beef broth.  I've never cooked with sourcream that way and I was very pleasantly surprised how much I liked it.  My husband spent 5 years in Germany and I wanted to surprise him with this meal.  He said it was exactly what he remembered and he kept saying while eating it.. man, you got this one right!!  That's high praise from my picky hubby.  I did make french fries to go with as that is what is served in Germany.  This will definitely go into my menu rotation.  Thank you DSPIRAL73 for this wonderful recipe.

I couldn't give it a 5 star because I changed it a little bit.  First off, pork chops do not have a lot of flavor, so I used boneless skinless pork ribs that I sliced thin and then pounded thin.  Then I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper,marjoram,garlic, and ground carraway.  Used panko instead of breadcumbs, and double dredged the pork so it was extra crunchy.  Fried in olive oil (more flavor)... Deglace the pan with beer(same as below), then added the onion and FRESH mushrooms.  Last, I made a Beer Sauce instead of a gravy... more authentic and delicious!!!

Although this recipe was very good, I would have to say it is not the authentic Jagerschnitzel.  My dad is from Austria and I made this for him last night. He agreed that it was good, however true Jagerschnitzel has a brown gravy.  Good, but not authentic.

Very good, but I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also used pork cubed steak so I wouldn't have to do the pounding.  We served it with spaetzle and red cabbage.  My husband's father's family is German and he loves all German food, he gave it a five star rating also and wants to eat this again next week!

Unbeatable!  I no longer need to go to my favorite german resaurant and pay 25$ for my favorite meal.  Sometimes I follow this recipe to a tee and sometimes I change it to the way my french grandmother (who had a german mother-in-law) made it and that is to add lots of dill.  She alway chopped up dill pockles and put pickle juice in it.  Sometime she would just simmer pork chops in pickle juice. Great comfort food.

My fiance is half German, and we have both visited Vienna, so we have had some pretty good schnitzel over the years. This one was delicious! The meat was crunchy and juicy at the same time, and the sauce was yummy! I didn't make any changes. We had this with "Authentic German potato salad" from this site also, and my fiance thanked me at least 20 times for the amazing dinner!

I made this for my two German exchange students; they  pronounced it "Great"!! just like  from home. 
It was very easy; I pounded the cutlets the night before, I used a combination of beef broth and boullion in the gravy. I served it with thick fries with the skin on, and fresh green beans!! Yummy- there were no leftovers.
Thanks!

FABULOUS! And that's from the kids and hubby. I used fresh mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I served it with spaetzle as suggested and a lettuce salad with a cucumber/yogurt dressions. They all ranked it among their top meals, even more than weinerschnitzel recipe from this site.

This was so delicious. My husband kept going on about how good it was. I changed the recipe to use what I had--pork chops instead of steaks, which I browned on the stovetop and then baked to finish cooking. I used beef broth instead of water and boullion. And I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I served it with redskin mashed potatoes. The mushroom gravy was great on the potatoes and the pork. Try this recipe!

I was looking for a quick, easy weeknight meal with an Octoberfest feel to it and I am glad I found this one! The gravy was so flavourful and delicious. My only changes were to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and two packets of boullion. Served it with steak-cut fries and a green salad as suggested, and the whole family enjoyed it. Thanks!

I too was stationed in Germany until Jan 07.  My Oma gave us a recipe which was misplaced but this one was much better. I added 1 extra bullion cube for a beefier taste.  It was awesome and my whole family loved it.  It has made our top 5.

This was very good.  I used Panko instead of ordinary bread crumbs. I used pork cube steaks and dredged them lightly in flour before dipping them in the beaten egg.  I also needed to use 2 eggs to coat my pork steaks, but then they were quite large.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and after the onions and mushrooms browned, I deglazed the pan with a little red wine.  I used canned beef broth instead of water and a bouillon cube.  This dish came out great, and we loved the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Was looking for something different, and tried this recipe - it is wonderful!  Somewhat heavy, though, and I would recommend serving with Spaetzle rather than fries.  (For all you Southerners out there, think chicken-fried pork cutlets with sour cream/onion/mushroom gravy.)  Great comfort food - definitely a keeper.

We thought this was just "okay".  I think that using fresh mushrooms instead of canned would have improved the flavor of the sauce greatly. Also, I had a lot of the breading leftover, and I had 6 pork chops(instead of 4, like the recipe called for).  I hate throwing away food. I might try again with 1/2 the breading, fresh mushrooms and maybe some good beef stock instead of the boulillion and water.

This recipe was ok. I really wasn't too fond of the sauce. It was easy to make and wasn't really all that time consuming but I just wasn't too fond of the taste. Maybe you just have to aquire a taste for German food.

Mmmmm-mmmm good!  I don't like mushrooms so I just omitted them and kept everything else the same.  Used two pork sirloin pork steaks, but kept the breadcrumbs the same, which was a waste of breadcrumbs- I used less than half.  My fault though.  Served with Carnation Mashed potatoes and steamed green beans.

Great tasting recipe.  To make lower carb friendly, I skipped the flour/bread crumb coating and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  Decided to keep the cornstarch since it only added 2 carbs per serving.  Yummy dish! Thanks.

This recipe was a hit with the adults and two and under set in my house.  I had to serve the sauce on the side for the picky 7 and 19 year olds.

I did alter the recipe, as I found it interesting there were very little seasonings in the recipe.  I added garlic powder and paprika to the flour, and rolled the steaks in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs for a more robust "crust" on the meat.  I also extra beef base for more flavor in the gravy.

I found this to be a little different than I expected...the jagerschnitzel I had in Germany had a much browner, thinner sauce.  It was still pretty good, though!  I just added a little more water to thin it down.

The mushroom sauce was amazing.  I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned because they just taste better.  Will definitely make this again.

I really liked this, but I'm giving it four stars because I made some small changes - I used fresh baby portabella mushrooms instead of canned. I also used Better Than Bouillon and omitted the corn starch.  I would definitely make this again!

Very good recipe. Only change was using fresh mushrooms instead of canned but next time i'll take another reviewer's suggestion and try adding some white wine in with the water for a little extra zing (not that it needed it, though)

Incredible flavor out of the meat despite very few ingredients. Gravy was rich and and delicious. 4 stars only because mushrooms aren't my favorite food in the world, and I have to rate based on taste. Thanks!

I followed pretty closely with a few changes. I did flour, then egg, then seasoned bread crumbs for the coating instead of mixing them. I also had fresh mushrooms on hand so I sauteed them ahead and added them in lieu of canned mushrooms. You could certainly do that after you remove the pork from the pan, too. My hubby is not huge on sour cream cooked into things, but he really liked it...and so did I. I served it with roasted red potatoes and baby carrots and the sauce was delicious on those too. Will make again for sure!

Very good recipe for Jagerschnitzel. Much more flavor then veal, and cheaper as well. Wish it produced a bit more sauce, but taste was perfect.  Only thing missing for a genuine German meal is the blaukraut.

I made this today and it was delicious. I used thin sliced boneless pork chops and they didn't require much pounding. I did have to tweak the cooking time. Five minutes each side was too much, but it may be the thickness of my chops. Three minutes each side was sufficient to get above 145* and not be too dark. The only other change in my dish was the use of several fresh, sliced mushrooms instead of canned. I served it with spaetzle and cinnamon apples. Yum!

made it exactly as directed, served with green beans and mashed potatoes.  Really simple meal - gets five stars for being very easy to make, tasty, and a hit with three picky children!

Sadly our ancient freezer died yesterday morning but we caught the problem in time to save everything.  We had carefully hoarded 4 packages of wild pig cutlets that had, unfortunately, thawed, but still had ice crystals in them.  Unwilling to submit them to less than the perfect recipe I used this one tonight.  OMG!!!  Hubby ate 5 cutlets!!!  I had 2...(they were rather small :)  and we will use the remainders later this hectic week for leftovers.  Hubby just kept saying...these are GREAT...what do you call them???  I don't know what the German interpretation is...but it must mean super wonderful pork cutlets!!!  (Will admit I subbed non-fat yogurt for sour cream as we have an issue with cholesterol...but they were still EXTREME!!!!)  Hope we get some wild piggies soon!!!  This recipe rocks!!!

With thin, kind of fatty pork chops this was good.  Would be excellent with thick steaks.

Delicious!  The only modification I made is boiling fresh mushrooms in the microwave for 4 minutes before adding to the skillet.  Grew up in Germany, tasted authentic to me. Served with spaetzle.  Yum!

I didn't make the gravy.  I fried the pork in 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil to give the pork a tastier crust. Came out wonderful!

I wasn't impressed with this at all. I used beef stock instead of bouillon and fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and I didn't think it had much flavor at all. Definitely didn't taste like it does in the restaurants here in Germany. A German friend told me that in south Germany they add beer to the sauce...I'll have to research that. To me, this didn't taste creamy or mushroomy or really like anything :(

I can't get my husband to stop raving about this recipe...it was fantastic. I had to make one change, though because I didn't have beef boullion. I used chicken and it still tasted great.

I found I needed for oil to cook them in to keep from burning, but otherwise a great recipe!  Wife and I both loved it (and i'm not a mushroom fan) and will be using the sauce on other dishes as well.

So I had some Pork Steaks and was wanting some yummy non-American food. And I stumbled on this little nugget. Seriously, my world changed. I would compare it to southern chicken fried steak with the country gravy but about a MILLION times better! It is sweet and savory and SO filling! Obviously, I'm in love!

I think we have a keeper.  This was easy to prepare and not too involved or time-consuming for a weeknight.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I especially liked the creamy mushroom sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, DSPIRAL73!

This was delicious! The kids loved it too, but ate it withouth the gravy. Served it with spaetzle. The gravy would not thicken up, so I added some flour mixed with water, and that fixed the problem.

I lived in Germany for a few years quite some time ago and I have yet to have any recipe come even close to what is one of my favorite meals. The meat should be very tender and juicy and the sauce is more of a hunter sauce served with a good Pilsner beer , sorry but this is not it. This was not meant to be a pretentious meal just good home cooking like mom's roasted beast.

I followed the recipe exactly, adding the suggestion of a reviewer with 1tsp ketchup, worhestire, and A-1. However, the porkchops were really good, but we did not care too much for the sauce.  I will def make the chops again, its a NO to the sauce though.

I am not a pork chop fan but my husband loves them.  Since he had recently bought some pork chops and I saw this recipe, I decided to try it.   It was soooooooo easy to prepare and the results were terrific.   Tasty and moist, they are now my favorite way to make pork chops.   I served them over egg noddles with the delicious sauce.  We had leftovers and I simply heated them in  a saucepan over low heat with a little added chicken broth and it was just as good.   Try this one and you will love it.

The taste is pretty close to authentic, but the sauce is a little too thick.  I doubled the sauce - next time, I will double the mushrooms, water & bouillon only, and leave the amount of cornstarch & sour cream the same, adding more sour cream as needed for taste. Also, I added quite of bit of "salt & pepper to taste" b/c the dish is supposed to be salty.  Super good over egg noodles if you don't have the time to make spatzle.

I made this for the first time last night.  My fiance and I absolutely loved it!  We didn't change the recipe at all.  There is no need to - it is fantastic as is.  We are planning on making it for our friends on Christmas Eve.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

About 40 years ago I would go to Germany semi regularly. Not enough to get the language or the menus  down well. I remember this as being "don't matter where you are, it's good".  Served this recipe verbatum tonight, and got all kinds of "Wow's". Don't remeber if this is the same as I was eating back then, but it is fine dining now, and will be served again. Think that I will add some garlic and worchestershire next time. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I dipped the cutlets in egg and breadcrumbs a second time to get a thicker coat of breading that stayed on during cooking.

This recipe was so delicious! The only change I made was to add dried parsley and lemon zest to the breading. I doubled the recipe for a family of four to have leftovers. Doubling the gravy makes way more gravy than you need but that worked out great since the gravy got such rave reviews from my family. I'll serve the extra gravy tomorrow over egg noodles. YUM!

Very tasty, AND, authentic. I lived in Germany for 11 years and every single Jaeger Schnitzel I ordered was ALWAYS breaded (and i ordered a lot!). Great simple recipe.

The weather is starting to cool off here and it was the perfect day for some comfort food....soooo....Jagerschnitzel it was!  I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and subbed the beef broth for the buillion.  The only other change I made was accidentally omitted the onions and subbed onion powder instead because I am a dunce and forgot to grab one at the store.  It was extremely good and tasted just like the kind I get at the authentic German restaurant down the road.  I made sure to pound the pork very, very thin and served it with fried potatoes and apple sauce.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

YUM! I made lots so that there would be extras and there ended up not being any. This was soooo good. Definitely comfort food. My hubby was born in Germany and lived there for quite a few years and this meets his approval. He loved it! I did make a couple of changes. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned because I had some in the fridge and I used beef stock instead of a bouillon cube because I had some in the pantry. My hubby says that I have to put this in our regular rotation :)

Used a 1 gallon zip lock bag to hold flower and bread crumbs for less clean up.  I added the salt, pepper, and a dash of garlic powder to the flower inside the baggy.  Other than this I followed recipe to a tee.  Very good and tastes as good authentic.  Family all loved it!

My father is German so I made this for him.  He loved it.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned as I don't like the texture of canned mushrooms.  Served with German potato salad and you have a great German meal

This was delicious.  I used fresh bread crumbs and fresh baby bella mushrooms.  Serving it with spaetzle made it the perfect German dish!  The pork made excellent sandwiches the next day too which is always a plus!  A definite keeper and new family favorite.

The problem I have with this recipe is not ingredients, but execution.  Frying the cutlet for 5 minutes per side and then keeping it warm for 20 minutes while making the sauce guarantees a hard, dry cutlet.  What I did instead was to fry 2 slices of bacon in the pan for the sauce then saute the onions and mushrooms in the bacon grease.  Once the sauce is simmering, I fried the cutlets in a different pan for about 4 minutes per side.  Plate the cutlets and cover with sauce immediately for juicy, tender meat.  Delicious.  Even better with fresh mushrooms and beef base instead of bouillon.

This is breaded pork chop stroganoff, as you suspected.  It is okay but not great.  I made per the recipe except I used fresh mushrooms. Spaetzle from a box was awful.  Little lumps of chewy pasta.

This was a welcome change. I made the gravy less healthy (but oh so good) by cooking the mushrooms and onion in butter. My only complaint was that the meat wasn't very tender, but that could have been my mistake in overcooking. Nice dinner.

This was delicious! I think it will be great for cold winter days. Also had roommate approval--even my German roommate approved. I had leftover gravy which I have just been enjoying with rice. The only bad thing was that I had too much oil in my gravy, but I will just dump some before adding the onions and mushrooms next time. Thanks!

DH loved this. The only thing I did differently was using garlic/herb breadcrumbs and only half an onion as that was all that I had.  I agree with another reviewer that putting flour on the pork BEFORE the egg, because some of my coating came off in the pan.

This was awsome! My friends & I had a Bavarian dinner & made this. What I did was use porkchops & after frying them I mixed gray mixture in pan added chops & let simmer for a while. The chops came out very tender & it was a big hit even with the most pickiest eaters. we also served over bread dumplins. Thanks.

Schnitzel is always tasty. I followed some of the other reviewers notes and used beef stock instead of the bouillon cube, and I'm not sure if that was the reason, but my sauce didn't come out exactly as I would have liked. It was a little too beefy. I'm used to Jagerschnitzel with the white, creamy sauce, so for those who noted that they liked theirs with a brown gravy, use the stock. I prefer it the other way. Served it with potatoes and a cucumber salad. Was a hit with the roommate and our boyfriends.

As much as I wanted to like this I didn't.  I let the broth cook down for 20 minutes but then there was not enough to make the gravy.  I was disappointed.

Spent 3 years in Germany and don't remember Jagerschnitzel like this.  The meat its self was fine but didn't care for the gravy at all.  Make use as a base but will try a different gravy recipe.

My husband found this and I must say 5 start all the way!!  

It was very tasty and filling. This was our first attempt at this, so my husband used a cup of sour cream instead of a half.. and it was still Delicious!!!!

Awesome, i can't wait to have it again!!

My family loves this recipe. Tastes authentic. I am a working mom with a long commute so to cut time I do the gravy differently. I buy a large can of roasted beef gravy (the best is from GFS) and add worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke (just a couple of drops), minced garlic, and tons of sauteed onions and mushrooms. I don't add sour cream usually because I don't remember having a light colored gravy in Germany and I like the robust flavor. To Die For!

I'm not sure what a traditional Jagerschnitzel should taste like. Whilst this was very nice, it just didn't have enough flavour for me. The main taste was sour cream which is kind of bland.

Easy and delicious.  I ended up adding a little more water because I didn't pay attention and the sauce cooked down too far but it was still great and everyone loved it.  I served it with pasta.

I rated this recipe a five because I've never seen the kids eat so much. My little 'non-meat eater' scarfed it up. Not sure if they were just hungry from getting back to school from summer, or if they just loved this! I'm thinking the latter. I thought it was very good, but the Italian husband didn't dig it so much. We have never had German food so we are not very good judges. I didn't want to down grade it any as it has received such rave reviews. I enjoyed making it. Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Would use a boneless pork steak next time. Thanks for the comfort food it was very easy to make!!

This was very good Jagerschnitzel. We made this with veal, used beef demi-glace instead of the bouillon, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. It was delicious! My husband, who was stationed in Germany when he was in the Army, and said this Jagerschnitzel was as good as any he had there.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great Recipe only change would be to use veal cutlets instead of pork cutlets.  I'm from Karlshrue and there they use veal, not pork.  Also serve with spaetzle (Germany Egg Drop Noddles) or noddles instead of fries.  A side dish of red cabbage with apples, you can use the jarred product, is perfect.

Superb! I used fresh baby portabella mushrooms, and the only downside to that was that it added extra time to cook them until tender. What a great dish.

This is a great recipe.  I did use veal and fresh mushrooms but everything else the same and served it over mashed potatoes.  I made it for my husband's birthday since he had been wanting me to make it since we went to Germany seven years ago.  He loved it and even my daughter had seconds!  I will definitely make this again.

Exceelent - I would give this more than 5 stars - the only changes I made were to use Panko crumbs for the breading and I used fresh mushrooms.  Served it with jarred red cabbage and Adrienne's Cucumber Salad (on this site).  I plan to make this again next week for company.

I thought this was a great recipe. My kids, husband and inlaws loved it. We served it with mashed potatoes and doubled the "gravy" that came with it and served it on the potatoes as well. We will definitely make it again.

This turned out very tasty!  I added a little dried basil to the bread crumbs along with pepper and seasoned salt, then added the pork steaks (bone in) back to the pan while simmering to finish cooking.  Had to sub chicken boul. for the beef.  Served it over noodles with peas.  We really enjoyed the flavor!

My first review. This is an absolutely awesome recipe. I did make few changes. Don't know how authentic my version is but it was restaurant quality meal.

I used just a bit of meat tenderizer on the pork before I pounded it. Then after marinated in just a bit of red wine ( I would imagine beer would be a bit better, but I didn't have any)  I added one small clove of chopped garlic to the onion, and additional spices to the bread crumb mix ( white pepper, garlic powder, paprika) My Mother always said to add paprika to pork because it sweetens the meat.  I used flour to thicken and not corn starch. Served with additional dollop of sour cream on top. Ummmm.

The schnitzel itself I breaded with panko and added salt and pepper. The sour cream and corn starch made the sauce way too thick and it just tasted like sour cream. Next time I’ll use fresh mushrooms, make a roux with the onions and mushrooms cooked in drippings and add beef stock. After all the work of this plus spaetzle and red cabbage, the sauce was a huge disappointment. Thanks for the inspiration though.

I have to eat Gluten Free, so I made it with corn flour and GF flour instead of the breadcrumbs/flour mixture and it came out great! Really impressed with the amazing flavor yet simplicity of this recipe. Even as a Cajun that loves spicy food, this recipe still impressed me!

The sauce was excellent! This dish was great and I made it as directed (I just added garlic and fresh mushrooms, instead of canned to the onions.)The only thing I would change is how much oil you need. I should have followed my own knowledge and instincts and used enough oil to cover half of the pork chops (probably about half a cup or so.) Instead, I followed the instructions and the breadcrumb/flour mixture BURNED because they were touching pan and not oil because there wasn't enough oil. It wasn't enough to cover the pan. The dish was still great, next time I will just add more oil! Delicious and THANKS for this recipe :)

Delicious!  I had to make do with only flour as I was out of bread crumbs, but it was still great. Have to try it with the crumbs next time. Used firm fresh mushrooms, of course (instead of the slimy canned ones).

I've made this several time but somehow, last night I missed/omitted the flour and just used bread crumbs.  It fried up just as nicely and the schnitzel was much lighter and tender than my previous attempts. I will omit the flour from now on!  Also, I've thrown away my stash of bullion cubes and only use Better Than Bullion Roasted Beef Base.

This is a great recipe that allows you to make a fairly large amount in relatively little time.  I had to deviate from the recipe a little, but I loved it anyway. In addition to the schnitzel, I made some spaetzle, which I poured some sauce over. The one fault with the meal I made, which was probably because I reduced the sauce too much, was that there wasn't quite enough sauce. 

________My deviations from the recipe:
1) I used Japanese panko breadcrumbs (unseasoned tempura-style), as suggested by one of the other reviews, and it worked out well. 
2) I used half vegetable stock and half beef stock for the sauce. 
3) I didn't have any onion.
4) Accidentally used corn starch + breadcrumbs instead of flour + breadcrumbs


________The only thing that can be difficult about this recipe is getting the pork thin enough. I bought pre-sliced pork chops from Walmart, and overestimated how much I'd hammered them down with my meat tenderizer. As a result, the meat was a little tough. I recommend either buying thin-sliced pork chops or buying pork loin and slicing it to ~1/4 inch thickness on your own before hammering it.

________Recommendations:
1) Use thin cuts of meat (

Love this recipe.   I have made it several times.  I have even substituted pork with chicken.    

This is one of my favorites which helps entice me to do the extra work to make this meal.    Well worth it.  


Thanks for this recipe.

I used cubed pork cutlets and started the sauce first. If you brown yr onions and canned mushrooms for a good amount of time you cannot tell they are canned and chop the onion a little larger than normal as it will reduce a lot. Only thing I wish I would've done is maybe brown flour before adding beef bouillon powder/water. Then simmered. I was not expecting a whole lot from this recipe as it is not something I would normally put together but it had so many good reviews and it was great. Thank you ????

I followed this recipe almost entirely, somehow I forgot to pick up the bouillon cube and my husband forgot to grab it when I texted him so our gravy was kind of bland lol. I'll have to try again, I'm sure that when I have it everything will be fantastic.

Loved the flavour, and it was simple to make. I'm starting to cook more and this is my first foray into schnitzel so perhaps more experienced people will have a different view, but I think this recipe is worth a shot.

I was very pleased with this dish. My husband and my toddler scarffed it down. I used fresh mushrooms and I substitued yogurt for the sour cream (since I had no sour cream on hand). I also browned flour with the onions and mushrooms before adding water instead of using cornstarch. Still yummy. Thanks for this recipe.

After going to Germany and eating schnitzel everywhere, I was determined to make this for my family. They loved this recipe and especially the sauce! I would add more mushrooms and less onions next time. This will be on the special dinner rotation for sure.

This was enjoyed by adults and children alike tonight.  I did change a few things due to time constraints and what I had available.  I used plain panko rather than fine breadcrumbs, but not complaining as this was super crisp.  My other change was to just use a packet of brown gravy mix with the water rather than the beef cube.  I used one packet with the 1 1/2 c water and just whisked it into the sauteed (fresh) mushrooms and onion.

It was very good. Pork chops were nice and tender. Sauce was good. Used extra mushrooms added lots of salt and pepper and next time I will be adding a splash or 2 of red wine. Served with the home made baked french fries on this site and made a side of mixed veg. using extra mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots.

The porkchops with the bread coating were excellent while the sauce seemed to be lacking something in flavor. Maybe a dash of Worcestershire sauce would add a little something to  it. The sauces consistency was just right like a gravy with onions and mushrooms. Overall this is a good recipe and I will make it again.

I have made this twice and both times it was outstanding. Second time I did make it low carb and it tasted just like the first time not being low carb. Only change I made to the recipe both times was putting the meat in with the sauce during the 20 minute sauce cooking time. If you are interested in low carb options I coated cutlets with ground pork rind and used xanthan gum in place of cornstarch to thicken sauce. Thanks for this gem!

Best pork chops I ever made!!!! Added 2 cloves of roasted garlic to sauce and used 4C breadcrumbs. Chops were amazing even before adding sauce. Instead of adding the corn starch I used remaining flour and dissolved in beef broth. Came out perfect.

I made this for my husband and we both loved it! We went to Germany for our honeymoon and this meal brought back some great memories. I prepared it with the German Spaetzle Dumplings (from this site) and also a German red cabbage and it was wonderful. It is very easy to prepare and tasted amazing. One tip is to make sure you pound the cutlets thin and don't keep them too thick. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, which is really the only change I made. It was good, but canned may actually work better. I found the fresh ones didn't get as tender as I thought (but still very good), but next time I'll try canned to compare. The gravy was very good and I will definitely make this again!

We added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the cutlets after they were cooked and served with pasta/ noodles.   Definitely make again - whole family enjoyed.  Made extra cutlets to use for sandwiches later.

I have made this many times for the incredibly picky eaters in my family. This is the only meal I make that the entire family eats and most go back for seconds. I have made this recipe exactly as the recipe states and I have also made it with a few modifications such as using fresh mushrooms (even better!) and low fat sour cream (no loss of flavor imho).

I have made this recipe about a half dozen times and it is a family favorite. My only change is to use fresh mushrooms.

Wunderbar! I wish I could give this six stars! I used avocado oil for everything and replaced the onion with leek, but it turned out amazing. The only thing I would have done differently was make a lot more of the sauce / gravy - I did Spaetzle on the side and it was a little dry, and everyone loved the gravy so much they were heaping it up, so it didn't last long.

It was easier than I thought it would be and tasted great! I used a carton of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the can, and served it with spatzle. Delicious!!

Made this last night and it was delicious.  I added a 16 oz can of mushrooms, since I love them, and served it over noodles.

I was fairly disappointed with mine. Wasn't much like the jagerschnitzel I had in Osnabruck a few months ago.  Not really sure whether to fault the recipe or my own cooking skills here.

I liked the sauce, but thought the breading and pork were pretty bland.

Excellent recipe to start out with, made it exactly as is first time I prepared it. After that, I added a few extra spices like paprika and garlic to the breading.  I made the gravy without the mushrooms as well and it turns out really good if you aren't a fan of mushrooms.

I made this recipe last weekend and we loved it. The only change I made was to use flour as the thickener instead of the cornstarch. This recipe is a definite keeper. I served with oven roasted potatoes and grandma Jeanette's awesome German red cabbage from this site. Was an unforgettable dinner that the family still talks about. I will definitely repeat this recipe.

Typically I hate how dry pork always turns out and I was nervous about trying German food for the first time. My verdict: it was absolutely wonderful. The meat came out so moist and tender even though I thought I had fried the thin slices too long. My boyfriend has decided it is one of his favorites. Which is great for me since it's so easy to make. Thanks! So recipe notes: I did the usual change of fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Also, I didn't buy pork cutlets, I pounded pork chops until they were about a 1/4 inch think instead.

Not bad, a bit dry (and definitely smoked up the kitchen!).  Used fresh mushrooms, sauce was good but I would have enjoyed a bit more flavour.  May try again although I don't think this will become a regular recipe for me. Served with egg noodles and green beans.

I love my grandmothers version of Jagerschnitzel. It's not an authentic way to make it but its absolutely delicious. No breading. All you need is pork, brown sugar, heavy cream, mushrooms (any kind, depends on preference), onions, and some spices. Rub the pork with brown sugar and spices, fry it up. Remove it from the pan and saute the mushrooms and onions in the same pan (DO NOT CLEAN DRIPPINGS GIVE IT THE TASTE). Then add heavy whipping cream and more brown sugar and make a gravy (add spices to taste). Then put the pork back in the pan let it mellow in the gravy for about 15 minutes and serve. AMAZING! It's sweet but delicious. Serve with some german potato salad, rolls and sweet and sour slaw.

I made this for my husband who lived in Germany during college. He said the sauce was great and reminded him of some great meals he had while living there. I only gave the recipe 4 stars because this isn't my favorite recipe for the schnitzel. I'll keep using this sauce recipe, but I'll continue to use my other schnitzel recipe instead of this one.

Amazing! So very good....dont know why I havent tried this recipe sooner....I used 12 cutlets pounded thin and used a whole wheat bread crumb. The sauce was really what made this dish for me.....I used no sodium beef boullioun packets instead of the cube. The sauce was thick, creamy and very flavorful...perfect for the pork cutlets. My family and company enjoyed. Will make again. Thanks!

I thought it was good but missing something. I used pork loin chops and fresh mushrooms. DD loved the sauce and gave it a 5 but since I only rated it a 3 I split the difference and rated a 4. I would make it again but add more seasonings.

I enjoyed this as a change although my family gave it a so-so rating, they don't like onions as much as I do.  Also, I had it for left overs on toast the next day and it was even better.

This was great!  I accidentally left out the flour in the breading but the pork was still crispy.  Next time I might substitute beef broth for the water and bouillon cube so that I don't have to wait for the cube to dissolve.  I also added some salt and pepper to the finished sauce to bring it together.  For something different you could pair it with chicken cutlets or even chicken fried steak.  This recipe is going in my rotation!

This was a hit with the whole family. 3 girls, 1 boy and Mom and Dad. Everyone enjoyed it. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used crushed saltines. Worked great. I made an entire pork loin so we could have left overs and there is nothing left. This will be a monthly recipe for our family!! Thanks for sharing

This was really good. I was so tired of Italian cooking and this was a great change!! I have never eaten this before, and followed it to the T, except no bouillon and used beef broth, and it was well. If you have a stainless steel pan don't heat it so much, maybe just medium, it will burn the breading. Thanks DSPIRAL.

My husband had eaten this dish on his trip to Germany.  He wanted to cook it at home for our family.  It was superb!  He said it was even better than the dish he was served in Germany.

My husband and I just love this served with spatzle and green beans on the side. I use panko bread crumbs and fresh mushrooms but otherwise follow the recipe as written. Yummy!

DELISH!!!!  Instead of french fries, however, I made white rice, although I am sure it is delicious with fries, or potatoes, mashed or not....possibilities are endless!

I am glad I finally made this!! Very good, my sauce was a little weird looking but it tasted good. I love the mushrooms and onions, it kind of reminded me of a stroganoff sauce. Yum Yum!!

A keeper and due to be a family fave! The only change I made was to use fresh Crimini mushrooms instead of canned. ( I don't like canned) So yummy that even the picky ones enjoyed it!

Doubled the recipe (I'm feeding 4 teenagers and a firefighter), and it was a HUGE hit!  I just received a text from my husband that it was just as good warmed up the next day!  Thank you for what will become a family staple.

I never take the time to review recipes that I try on this site.  But this recipe deserves a reviw.  THis is excellent!  Great with mashed potatoes!  It is pretty time consuming as I had to rip the meat off the bone first then pound the dickens out of it.  If that was already done for me, I would whip this together more often.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

This was great, and hubby said it was just like he remembered from Germany!  I even subbed dried chopped onion for fresh (cut into the one I bought and it was no good), just added it to the water/boullion to simmer and it worked great. I bought schnitzel cut pork so I didn't have to do the work myself and it really made this recipe easy!

This was really good. Soft and tender pork beaten into submission! I did use freshly dried bread crumbs which I think made a more tasty and fresh dish. The gravy was excellent but the rest of my family didn't like it. Served with "Green Bean and Bacon Saute" and mashed taters.

Very good recipe. The gravy was missing something but it was still TONS better than a mix.  The only change I made was using a veal cutlet rather than pork but I noticed no difference there.  Served it with the spaetzel from this site and it's a keeper.

I used butterflied center cut pork chops pounded flat and tenderized.  This dish turned out great using the recipe as is.  I served with the Spaetzle I recipe from this site and my family loved it.  The sauce is the absolute best.

My husband doesnt care for pork because what he HAS tried was never prepared properly. I made this and he loved it, he said 'you have a way with pork'. I said, I have my allrecipes! Thanks for a hit, now I don't have to spend $50+ to take us out to a good German restaurant.

Excellent -   You do not need a full cup of bread crumbs.   1/2 cup would be sufficient.   I recommend using 2 eggs.   I used fresh mushrooms.   2 teaspoons of cornstarch made the thickness "just right".

UPDATE: MADE THIS AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME I USED BONELESS TOP LOIN CHOPS (I USED PORK STEAKS BEFORE). I CUT AWAY THE OUTER EDGE OF FAT AND THEN POUNDED EACH CHOP TO THE THICKNESS OF A CUTLET (BETWEEN 1/4-1/2 INCH). I PLACED MY BREADED CHOPS IN THE FRIDGE FOR ~ 20 MINUTES TO ENSURE THAT THE BREAD CRUMBS WOULD "STICK." PERFECT! I THEN PAN FRIED IN SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 2 T OIL (JUST EYEBALL IT). USING A PREHEATED  STONEWARE JELLYROLL PAN (200 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT) TO "HOLD" MY COOKED SCHNITZEL WHILE I PREPARED THE SAUCE WORKED REALLY WELL! AN ADDITIONAL BOUILLON CUBE PRODUCED A RICH, DECADENT SAUCE. NOTE: YOU MUST FRY YOUR STEAKS FIRST!!! THE BROWNED BITS ARE WHAT MAKES THE SAUCE. YUM! Pretty good! Tonight's meal was German themed with all the fixins' - Bavarian sauerkraut, steak fries and German beer! Although my fiance and I BOTH liked this, we didn't care for the sauce (but I liked it a tad more than my fiance did...). I found the sauce to be too bland and very light (not typical of TRUE German foods / sauces). We are not fans of mushrooms, but I added them anyways in order to enhance the overall flavor. We just picked around them as we ate. I remember having schnitzel in Germany and Austria. Sometimes it was served with a brown gravy (oddly enough, WITHOUT mushrooms in it) and sometimes just plain. Overall, this was a hearty meal that I will make again, but not without a few tweaks to make the sauce better (or a new sauce recipe altogether). Thanks for sharing, DSPIRAL73! :-)

This was really good! I didn't make any changes to the recipe, and was happy with it! Since I've never eaten authentic German Jagerschnitzel, I think next time I will bake the meat instead of frying to save on some fat. But otherwise this was a great recipe!

Very tasty, family loved it.  I was short some ingredients so I changed a couple of things, I also used Shake'n'Bake to coat the pork to save time and mess and so I could bake in the oven instead of frying it. I used a small amount of olive oil to saute the mushrooms until soft and brown, added several chopped green onions and the garlic.  The boullion ended up cooking too long and needed more liquid so I added a splash of white wine, then the sour cream (low fat version).  Worked out great.

Excellent recipe, and my boyfriend who worked for a long time in a German restaurant loved it!  I used fresh sliced mushrooms rather than canned and would probably use about 2 containers of them.  I served it with Spaetzle, but mashed potatoes would also be good.

I made this for our Friday night dinner party only because we have a ton of pork cutlets in the freezer and I wanted to use them up.  Three of my guests were german and loved it.  This was a hit with everyone.

Very good.  However, watch the heat closely.  I slightly burned it which threw off the flavor of the entire dish. Even still, it was good.  Will make agagin.

I made this and had never even had Jagerschnitzel before. I was slightly concerned that I wouldn't know if it tasted right. My husband had had this when he was stationed in Germany. He said it was spot on! I was impressed that the recipe could be so accurate that it could come out that good even though I had no clue what I was making. lol

I used cube steak instead...not sure how authentic that is, but it tasted WONDERFUL!  Probably one of the best dishes I've ever made!!

My family really enjoyed this. Simple to prepare with basic ingredients.  I doubled this easily and used fresh mushrooms.

I served this with spaetzel and red cabbage. I sliced pork loin and pounded the slices. I'll make it again. Thanks for the recipe.

My fault for the 3* rating - could have been a 4.5*. Ate this with Spaetzle Dumplings. Didn't change anything. Chops were definitely too large - heck of a time trying to flatten them. Result: they were too thick and didn't 'brown' and cook well at the same time, (outside too cooked/inside not cooked well enough - lesson learned! - don't get thick chops!! Very filling and tasty meal - gravy is to die for.

Excellent flavor-loved the gravy!! I used 3 thin pork steaks & the 1 egg was barely enough, so you may want to have 1 more egg available just in case.

I cooked the cutlets a little too hot and they got a little burned.  It still tasted great.  I used real beef broth instead of boullion and the gravy turned out very nice.  I will try this again sometime with lower heat.  Ore-ida steak fries were great for sopping up the gravy.

This was very, very good.  I pretty much followed the recipe except for two minor things...I used two beaten eggs instead of one because there wasn't enough (my pork steaks were pretty large.  And, I used a splash of Kitchen Bouquet in the gravy.  I too(like one other reviewer) think the gravy should be brown and Kitchen Bouquet made it brown.

This was great.  We had it with noodles then I layered the cutlets with the sauce.  I didn't have mushrooms nor beef broth so I just used onions and chicken stock. It still was yummy.  I recommend finely chopping your onions so they get nice and tender. I'll make this again. (Maybe even with the right ingredients!)

Made this tonight for dinner. DH liked it, I thought the sauce was a little salty. I guess that was was the beef boullion cube, or maybe cause I quit smoking and everything just taste salty. Anyway I will make this again.

This was really good.  I didnt make the sauce to cut calories.  Instead I squeezed some lemon juice on them.  I made the Authentic German Potato Salad recipe to go along side......what a tasty meal!

My husband loved this! I am not normally a pork fan, and I am always looking for a way to dress it up. The only change I made was I used fresh mushrooms and those thin, breakfast sliced pork chops, because that is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was delicious. Definetly something to keep in rotation. I was unsure because of it was so foreign to me but the only difference I made was using fresh mushrooms. My sauce didn't turn out looking anything like the picture but who cares when its tasty.

Enjoyed this recipe.  Used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs. Left out the bouillon cube.  Beat two eggs because I used twice as much pork. Happy to make this recipe again.  Everyone loves it.  "Spaetzle I" recipe goes well with it.

Very good recipe.  The only thing I did different was I used Panko Crumbs because that's all I had.   I will def. make this dish again w/the panko crumbs.  I think I will try making this w/chicken cutlet next time.

I've never ordered this from a German restaurant so i'm not sure what it is supposed to taste like, but it was very good! I, like many of the others, used fresh mushrooms. I bought the thin "breakfast pork chops" trimmed off the fat and just pounded them extra thin. I also double coated the chops for a thicker breading. Will make this again sometime!

Made this recipe last night, was soo good!  Followed it exactly, (and I rarely do that), turned out great.  I left my sauce a little bit runny, but that was my personal preference.  Had no trouble getting it to thicken up afterwards.  Definitely will be making this again.  I served with homefries.

This is a good recipe if you replace the canned mushrooms with fresh, but it's still missing something and I think it's a "depth of flavor" in the sauce.  Rather than following the recipe for a quick saute of the onions and mushrooms, I'll slowly carmelize the onions separately in butter and add them to the pan with the mushrooms - this may perk the flavor up a notch.  I will tweak this recipe and try again since it's fairly close to the real deal.

My husband loves to cook, especially German food. He really liked this recipe, except next time he will add more salt and pepper. Otherwise we will definitely add this to our recipes to make in the future.

This turned out wonderfully and the pork chops were moist and tender. I did use fresh mushrooms and 1/2 tbsp cornstarch and served over baked frozen french fries. Definitely a keeper!

I didn't change a thing, this was so good!!!  The most important thing so this recipe, is to be sure to pound the cutlets thin.

Yuuuummmyyy! I lived in Germany for a total of 8 yrs becaus emy father was statoined there with the U.S. Army. We used to eat schnitzel all the time. The best restaurant was E-Tony's in Hanau. They made the most awesome schnitzel cordon bleu with cream sauce. This recipe was very close to other places we got schnitzel from. I also recommend fresh mushrooms for the best taste.

Just as good as what we had in Germany.  We prefer the gravy a little bit thicker, so next time I will add a little more corn starch.  My corn starch lumped when I added it to the sour cream, so I am glad I added it about 30 minutes before I needed to use it.  This gave it time to smooth out before it was used.

Made this for the mother-in-law and it was a hit. Everybody wanted seconds. Served it with chips (fries) and corn but would likely drop the corn for a more elaborate vegetable dish. Might also add a German wine to the mix next time.

My husband, who was stationed in Germany, said this was just like the schnitzel he used to eat.  It wasn't a hit with our ten year old but we both liked it. I especially liked the gravy.

I made this with veal and used lite sour cream instead.  The recipe doubles very well, but the egg and breadcrumbs do not need to be doubled.  For a double batch, I used only one egg but I added about a tablespoon of whole milk to the egg to thin it a bit.  I also used a blend of forest mushrooms (purchased as dried and rehydrated with water).  I will try this again and will try to make it a little creamier by using non-lite sour cream. I might also add a little more salt to the sauce.  One other note--even with the doubled batch, the preparation time was pretty close to the single batch--a little extra time to prepare the cutlets.

An excellent dish and easy to prepare at that!  I followed the recipe exactly, but only used 3 pork chops and made 2 cups of the sauce.  My husband loved it and so did I.  Definitely a winner.

Finally!  Jagerschnitzel that I can enjoy in this country and I don't have to wait to go to Germany!  This is so easy and so good-thanks for the recipe.  And, yes, we love it with the fries and I always use fresh mushrooms.

This recipe turned out awesome!!! We live in Germany, but can not often afford to go out to dinner, so I made it at home, and it is better than some of the schnitzels I have tasted here! Thank you for sharing.

I was trying to find a Jagerschnitzel recipe like the one I had at Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas and this was definitely it!  The only things I changed were I added fresh mushrooms like other reviewers and added 4 slices of cooked and crumbled bacon as the Hofbrauhaus did.  Superior Touch Better than Boullon Beef Base (about 2 t.)added to the 1 1/2 c. water is great, too, instead of bouillon.  Great over spaetzle.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

I lived in Germany for a number of years and if you've never tasted a Jagerschnitzel, actually made in Germany, this is pretty darn good. The sauce/gravy was a little peculiar from what I'm used to (from the sour cream) but it was still good.

I served this over egg noodles (I had no time to deal with spatzel though it would have been really good!). I also mixed regular mushrooms with shitake mushrooms. Yummy. My only complaint was that the sauce was a little on the runny side. However, still very good!

This is a wonderful, delicious recipe! I used fresh cremini mushrooms instead of canned, and canned beef broth instead of a boullion cube and water. All I had were Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, but the flavors still worked perfectly .As with many other reviewers, I prepared this along with the spaetzle recipe found on this site to make a perfect, authentic German meal!

This was as good as the schnitzel we order from our favourite Polish restaraunt.  I altered it slighty by adding green, yellow and red peppers as well as onion to the mushroom mix. It looked so professional, next time we make it we'll invite company for dinner so we can show off.

mmmmm, we made this for oktoberfest. i had a small boneless sirloin pork roast in the freezer which worked well here. i carved the roast into 1/2" thick slices while it was partially frozen then pounded the meat out after it defrosted. i also substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned variety. my jagerschnitzel was both tender & flavorful. this dish served well with german spaetzle dumplings (from this website) & applesauce. vielen dank, dspiral!

This was very very good.  You must try it.  Make it with the German Spaetzle from this site.

Very good, nice and easy.  Even my hard to please husband said that it would be worth making again.

Made this recipe for 100 people at our weekly legion dinner, but used fresh mushrooms - it was a hit! People raved about the sauce. Plates were coming back wiped clean. Used the sauce recipe for our chicken breast dinner as well. Equally loved.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. He was stationed in Germany before and he always talked about how this particular dish was his favorite. He took leftovers to work the next day bragging on my cooking!!! The kids and I didn't care for it too much but I would make it again just for him (and so I can hear him brag) Thanks!

Very good.  Used seasoned bread crumbs, which other reviewers seem to have mixed feeling about and I thought it wouldn't have been nearly as good without (however, I have never had this dish before so I have nothing to compare it to and have absolutely no idea how the true German dish tastes.)  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This was great! I made it with pork tenderloins, still breaded and fried them then baked them in the oven for 30 minutes or so. Made the gravy with the flour and bread crumb mixture instead of cornstarch mixture. Also added real bacon bits to the bread crumb mixture. I poured the gravy over the pork tenderloins for the last 5 minutes in the oven. Although I tweaked the recipe just a bit, it was still fantastic!! Went great with German Potato Salad and boiled cabbage.

Pretty good, simple, and fairly easy...I was expecting a little more flavor, and might add something next time I make it, but it will definitely be a repeat in our house.

Fresh mushrooms, sour cream and beef bouillon made the perfect combination for the sauce.  My husband enjoyed this recipe and I will  definitely be making it again.  I breaded the pork cutlets in Panko as recommended by another reader and used fresh mushrooms since I am not a fan of canned mushrooms.  Thank you for the recipe DSPRIAL73.

Outstanding!  I've been looking for a good jagerschnitzel recipe - this is just like the one at my favorite German restaurant, maybe better.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned & served it over spaetzle.  Comfort food at its best!

My husband has spent several months in Germany, so I made this for him...turns out he'd never had jagerschnitzel, so he couldn't comment on its authenticity. But we both really enjoyed it! It's an easy dish, and tasty...neither of us are huge pork fans normally, but we'll definitely eat this again!

I will make this again. I used prok chops just because I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough before shopping.  It was good anyway.
