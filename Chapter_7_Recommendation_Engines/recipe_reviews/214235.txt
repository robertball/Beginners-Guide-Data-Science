I used this recipe to make a filling for a cake. It was pretty good, but I made a few changes. First, I couldn't find cool whip dips, so I just combined cool whip with instant chocolate pudding mix; it worked well. Also, I added some crushed oreo cookies to the mix. Next time I make it, I will include more cool whip and some sour cream.

Okay, I had to use regular Cool Whip, but it came out like a French silk. Love it!

This is an easy recipe. I, too, could not find the cool whip DIPS.  I added a small package instant chocolate pudding to cream chees mixture and then folded in the regular cool whip. Worked, Will make again.

Awesome and easy. I made this and took it to the bake-off in Cincinnati, Ohio and I had just enough time to make it. The judges gave me first prize!!!

This recipe was super easy.  The only problem I had was finding the Cool Whip Dips- Chocolate.  Like a previous reviewer I used instant chocolate pudding.  I thought that gave the cool whip a bit of an odd texture, but it tasted great.

OH MY GOSH. If you love chocolate and/or mousse, then this is the cheesecake for you! LOVE this. 

I don't think Cool Whip Dips are available anymore, so I did what other reviewers suggested: one tub of cool whip + a small box of chocolate pudding + a splash of milk. It turned out perfectly. So easy and delicious!

I have made this several times.  I use alternative sweetner and it is great for people with diabetes or low carb diet. It's not 100% diet this way but it helps.

Like others who commented, I tried adding the chocolate pudding mix in.  It made the mixture gritty, so I added a little extra cool whip (ended up using the whole container, just about) and drizzled in some milk very slowly until the grittiness was gone.

I've made this a few times and even changed it up a little. I skipped the chocolate and berries, used plain cool whip( the dips kind isn't available where i live)and a plain graham crust to make a plain cheesecake pie. Last time i added blueberry pie filling while blending. Amazing!! It tastes like a cheesecake but is so simple to make and you can add whatever you like to fit you! This is a regular go-to recipe for me now and the kids and husband keep requesting it!
