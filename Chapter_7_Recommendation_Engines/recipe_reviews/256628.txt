This is salmon for salmon haters! None of us likes salmon but my husband and I thought this was very good and the kids ate it without complaint. I don't have the oven or grill pan used in the recipe, so i just cooked 20 minutes at 400 degrees, adding mango mixture the last four minutes, as directed.  Cilantro was key.  Will keep in my rotation of salmon recipes!  Thanks, Bibi!

If you’re bored and looking for something interesting to make, pick this! It was OUTSTANDING. My mother, who hates spicy food and mangos, loved it. The photo I attached is no filter; the dish is pretty and tasty. NOTES: I live in an area where chutney is hard to find, so I used an electric juicer to juice a mango. The liquid of a juicer mango is thick, slurry-like, so it worked great.

Luscious salmon. I also baked at 400 for 20 mins as suggested, adding chutney last few minutes. Mango chutney  not available at store when I shopped, so substituted with Major Grey. Remained delicious, but I look forward to preparing with the mango chutney in the future. The cilantro really does add a tasty layer of flavor — and pretty.

This has become a weekly family favorite. I could not fine mango chutney so I use mango salsa. I drain it in a colander to get a lot of the liquid out and use what’s left.

This was a good, simple and tasty way to have salmon. I liked the cilantro on top. I didn't have chutney, but I did have mango preserves, so I used that and added some spices to it. I don't have an induction oven, so I baked it for 20 minutes at 400, and that worked perfectly. Next time I will have to find some chutney and try it with that.

This was really tasty! I used skinless salmon, and it cooked much quicker than the 23 minutes that the auto cook mode wanted to cook it (adjusting for 1 lb vs 2 in the recipe). I think with fish, you just really need to keep an eye on it until it is firm in the middle. I couldn't find mango chutney in my grocery store, so I made my own, using the recipe on this site. I served this with basmati rice, which went well with the chutney.  Thanks Bibi!
