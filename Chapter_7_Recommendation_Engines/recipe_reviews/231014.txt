I make this all the time! I have also filled with chopped up green olives instead of tomatoes! Both very yummy!

I made it and everyone loved it. I made it again with different ingredients: dry salami with pepper coating cream cheese and dill and cucumber. Let you imagination run wild. You can t miss with this recipe.

Easy and quick to prepare and tastes good. I thought there was too much salami so I cut salami in half rather than fold in half. Instead of using toothpicks I put some cream cheese between ends of meat to hold it together
