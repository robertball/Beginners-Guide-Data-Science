This was a hit! I regularly make dessert for a friend's card club and after at least two years of baking for them, this was their favorite. The cake was moist and flavorful but the icing is truly what separates this from all other apple cakes. Almost like German Chocolate cake icing without the pecans and coconut. I followed the directions except I always add a little extra vanilla. Firm Golden delicious apples were used. Highly recommend!

I've made this recipe twice exactly as printed and our family had the same reaction twice. The cake was okay (nothing special), but the "frosting" was awful. It kind of tasted like diluted sweetened paste. I've deleted this one from my recipe box.

We love this version of fresh apple cake. I didn't change a thing! That is until I poured a quarter cup of bourbon in the leftover half just as an experiment. Awesome! It is more crumbly that way, but this recipe makes an awesome whiskey cake. Just sayin'

The cake was good. Easy to make and came out of the bundt pan easily. But, contrary to other reviewers, I did not care for the frosting. It did not really soak into the cake that much. I would just use a powdered sugar, milk and vanilla glaze if I made it again. But, the cake was moist and it was nice to be able to make it  a day ahead of my party.

Got a Bundt pan for my birthday and decided to try it out. Chose this cake due to simple ingredients. I made a few changes to the recipe but it still came out wonderful. I did not have pecans, so I used cashews-added wonderful flavor. I did not have allspice or cloves so i just added extra cinnamon and nutmeg-came out great. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used whole milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar. I didn't have baking soda so I used powder and it worked out. I used applesauce instead of the oil. I also added maple whiskey to the icing because someone mentioned that the icing was bland, and that came out excellent. I also used only white sugar throughout. Cake came out perfect, moist, flavorful, with delectable little apple chunks in every bite even with all my meddling. My husband took some to work and it was all gone in the first half of the day. I will definitely make this again if i have some spare apples laying around.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving this year.  I'm a beginner baker but this was easy and turned out great.  Moist and the icing was really good.  I didn't have any allspice so I just added more cinnamon and nutmeg.
