These are fabulous!  They are very light and fluffy in texture and the flavor is so well balanced with the chocolate and cinnamon.  I did use heavy cream instead of the milk in the frosting since I like a more whipped texture.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks LTH for another stunning cupcake!

I made these before the recipe was officially published and am so happy to see them as a kitchen approved recipe! 10 star recipe! The cake has the perfect balance of cinnamon/chocolate and sprinkling the tops with cinnamon sugar before baking is genius. The frosting? To die for. I think I added a bit more cinnamon and cocoa than called for because I wasn't paying attention, but it's divine regardless. Thanks LTH!!!

WOW WOW!!  THESE ARE SOOOO RICH & DECADENT!  I MADE MINI CUPCAKES & AS WITH MOST RECIPES I GET FROM HERE, I TOOK THEM TO CHURCH POTLUCK.  EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THEM, EVEN MY PASTOR WHO ISN'T MUCH ON SWEETS.  I DIDN'T ADD ANY ADDITIONAL POWDERED SUGAR TO THE FROSTING AND PIPED IT USING A PASTRY BAG/TIP AND IT CAME OUT LIGHT AND FLUFFY, A MOUSSE LIKE TEXTURE.  PERFECTION!!!!  I GIVE THIS 5 * * * * * !!!!!

i love cinnamon so these were great for me!! So fluffy and yummy, i filled them with a cream cheese/cinnamon filling and used regular buttercream frosting with 1tbsp of cocoa, yummmmm, GREAT cupcakes.. The batter was soooo fluffy and creamy I thought I did something wrong but they turned out wonderful!

I have to add though that many people weren't into the strong cinnamon flavor so if making for many people I suggest less cinnamon.. That's why I took one star, a lot of people weren't into them at the party I took them to.... But *I* loved them & will make again for my son and me!

I just made these and they are amazing. I forgot to add the butter in the cupcake mix and they still came out nice and moist. I was a little skeptical using the shortening in the frosting but it came out delish.

These cupcakes are amazing.  They are the perfect combination of chocolate and cinnamon.  The frosting is the perfect addition to the cake.  I made these and people said they tasted like they were professionally made.  I will definitely be making again.

A little dry and some what bland I did not care for the frosting at all. The flavor was good but it was greasy.

Absolutely delicious it was like a spiced chocolate cupcake and the frosting was so good. The recipe did say to add two more cups of confectioners sugar. I tried the frosting before  I added the two cups and decided if I did add it. It would be too sweet

So, SO delicious! This is a really interesting and creative twist on the usual chocolate cupcake. I didn't have cake mix, so I substituted it with brownie mix. As a result, the cupcakes were thicker and richer, though slightly smaller. It wasn't the traditional taste and consistency, but it was still delicious. I also added about a teaspoon of instant coffee and a half cup of Cool Whip to the frosting. They turned out great, and my family loved them!

Followed recipe to a T. Liked the cake part, turned out wonderful. Frosting was a bit too sweet for me, however the addition of cinnamon was an interesting flavor. I will attempt again. Yup, madeâ€™em king sized. Reduced servings to 12, and it made 6.

These were very tasty, very moist.  The frosting was a bit too sweet and too thick.  I added an additional 1/4 cup milk to the frosting to get a proper consistency.

Really good I would say depends on cake mix u use. Plus frosting is WAY to sweet so I cut down on the suger and added more cocoa powder and cinnamon.

I made the cinnamon frosting to go with brownies. The frosting is not too sweet with a hint of cinnamon.

This recipe was good, however, I would still serve or eat one of these but if I had a choice I'd take the snickerdoodle first.

I think the frosting was better than the cupcake. Yes the cupcake was light and fluffy but i don't think it had much taste. The frosting was great though!

Great combination; I tweaked this a bit and added 1 box of chocolate pudding, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and 1t of mexican chilli powder. Frosted with cinammon buttercream. Delightful.
