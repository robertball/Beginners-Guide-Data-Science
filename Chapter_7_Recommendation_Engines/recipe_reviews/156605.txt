We loved these. I did add more jalepeno & a healthy dose of my homemade creole seasoning. Very tasty & fried up perfectly.

LOVE THEM.  These are the best hush puppies. I added a little more jalape√±o peppers thought. Used about 1/4 cup. Just hot enough!  Sometimes I use butter milk instead of whole milk.

Great recipe!  I usually make the frozen kind when frying fish...never again.  These are ten times better and easy to whip up!  They fry quickly too so you're not slaving over hot grease.
