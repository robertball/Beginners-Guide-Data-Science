I made this with instant rice boiled the carrot, boullion, butter and water first then added the rice. It turned out great and looked very pretty. A nice way to add some vegetabels to our diet.

Very pretty and a nice change from regular rice, though the carrots really didn't add much flavour - it tasted basically like normal steamed rice.

I agree that the carrots add more color than flavor, but it was a nice change and it went perfect with our fish and vegetables dinner. I did add 3 bouillon cubes for a little extra flavor. Thanks Melissa.

I left the carrots raw & added some raw shredded zucchini as well.  My lil' one loves rice & this was a great way for me to sneak in some veges as well.  As everyone else stated, it is a nice change from normal rice & really does look pretty.  Thanks Melissa!

Overall, I thought this was a good rice side dish.  I've made this twice so far and the first time it tasted a bit on the bland side so the second time around I added another chix bouillon cube.  It still tastes like it's missing something though.  Next time I decide to make this maybe I'll add yet another bouillon cube and maybe some diced onions or something like some other reviewers mentioned.  I also used a cup of frozen green peas both times which added a nice color and taste to it.  Thanks Melissa.

A good way to fix rice so that's it's a little different and doesn't sabotage my diet plan.  (Just for the record, though, I can't imagine any kid thinking it's cheesy rice!)

I loved the base idea of this recipe! But to make it creamier I used a can of chicken broth and added a can of cream of mushroom soup. So good! I'm thinking next time I'll make it a quick one pan meal and add some chicken to it too.

My 4 year old son does not like any starchy side dishes. He won't touch rice, potatoes, or pasta in any form. He not only ate this dish, but even asked for seconds! (I made it with a vegetable cube.)

Yummy!!  I used chicken broth instead of water and bullion because that's what I had.  So very tasty, and the carrots add a great color to the plate!  Thanks for the great idea!

yum yum. For such a simple recipe, this is great! I used Jasmine rice, which was cooked already (leftovers) I doubled the carrots and added peas and red onion. Simple sweet side dish in minutes.

This rice is quick and easy in a rice cooker, and the carrots give eye appeal, as well as color.  I added diced onion, and used a can of chicken broth instead of bullion cubes (I tripled the recipe).    I rated it a three only because it had no burst of new or interesting flavor.  For ease and visual acuity, it rates a 5.

I added 3 boullion and onions to this recipe after reading comments from others. Even with that I thought it was still a bit bland.

great recipe. very easy. I already had some shredded carrot so this was a great way to use some of it up. I had some premade chicken stock to use up too, i just added 100ml to make it equal 2 cups. i used 3/4 cup white ricee and 1/4 cup wild rice. It was delicious!  Hubby was impressed too. Thanks for the great recipe. I'll use it next time I have guest for tea, too.

We like rice and this gives me another way to serve it.  One of my children, the carrot hater, thought it was cheese rice.  It certainly won't give the kids a whole serving of veggies  but it is a start.  Will definitely make again.

After reading the reviews that said this was a little bland I added two beef bouillon cubes (didn't have chicken) and about a Tbsp of lemon pepper when I added the carrots and rice. Turned out great! My three year old loved it so I will definitely be making this again!

Pretty good base recipe. I added shallot, parsley, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Served with chicken and family enjoyed it. I imagine it would pair also with fish very nicely.

Nice change. The kids enjoyed it as well.  I used Jasmine rice (which upped the calorie count, but not by much)and 2 bulion cubes. I made it my double decker steamer instead of on the stove top.  I placed the cubes in 2 cups of hot water and let them disolve, then added it all to the steamer and let it go.  Easy, and we'll be having this again.

This was excellent!  I sauteed a small shallot and the carrots a bit before adding the water.  Also threw in a couple teaspoons of butter at the end.  Will make this again soon!

This was really quite nice as a side dish.  I should have just followed the recipe as is for the first time, but followed others' advice and added 3 bouillon cubes.  WAY too salty!!  Next time I'll try one, maybe two.  Simple, easy, and enjoyable!

Very good.  I also added some frozen peas.  A good alternative to rice and gravy for those watching their calories.  I served it with a fish dish, some steamed broccoli, and crusty rolls.  It felt very healthy!

I thought that the recipe as is was pretty flavorless, although it looked visually nice. I think one needs to tweak it considerably by adding this or that to make it better. The fun is in the experimenting, so 'it's all good'.

Well the carrots made the rice pretty but didn't bring a lot of flavor. A little onion, and garlic would have been a good addition.

Not bad. I used instant rice and added some butter to the water for flavor. I also cooked the carrots with the rice; the raw carrots in the cooked rice didn't work for me. A good recipe to get some veggies in.

I needed a change and didnt have many ingredients on hand and found it to be a refreshing change from regular plain rice.  I served it with bbq chicken and loved it.  My 4 yr old on the other hand burst out in tears when he saw it, being that he likes things plain and simple.  I might make it again anyway.

I made it with white basmati rice instead of the regular white rice and it turned out very well.  I'll probably make it again.  I'm going to cook it with homemade chicken broth and see how that turns out.  A good and easy recipe.

I doubled this recipe but used a whole package of broccoli slaw mix that I lightly browned in a saute pan with garlic olive.
