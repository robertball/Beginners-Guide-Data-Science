Good recipe, however, I made a few changes. After slicing I put three chopped leeks and an onion thru my food processor and then sauted in butter (not margarine). I then added only four potatos which I cubed. While that was happening, I made a roux and added it to the mixture. The broth came next. After the potatoes were tender, I whirled them in the food processor to give the soup a velvety consistancy. Once back in the pot, I then added fat free half and half and topped with chives and crumbled bacon. Wonderful soup and thanks so much for a GREAT start Michele!

I sauteed the leeks in bacon grease for the added
flavor... and the second time I made this soup I
sauteed 2 chopped stalks of celery and a chopped small onion. I also put 3 cups of the potatoes in
my blender and pureed to thicken the soup.

This was my first time to make potato and leek soup and this recipe was SUPER easy.  I did use whole milk instead of the cream and added some salt, pepper, and garlic.  I loved this soup and it was great for a rainy, cold day.  Thanks so much for a quick, easy, and delicious soup!

This soup is delicious and filling, a meal by itself. I used whole milk instead of cream and a 1.5lb bag of French Fingerling potatoes (with skins)...YUM! Leftovers (if there are any!) need a little bit of milk because the soup gets pretty thick in the fridge. I will definitely make this one again!

This was the first time I've use leeks and was plesantly surprised how tasty they are. Next time I'll use one more leek and a few more potatoes. One suggestion.... When you dice up the potatoes make the pieces fairly small (bite size).

Excellent easy soup. Like some of the other reviews, I added salt,fresh ground pepper, and cayenne pepper.I also used milk instead of cream, and mashed some of the potatoes. I think I will try adding celery next time. My husband and I loved this soup. Thanks for a great recipe!

The soup had a great consistency but I found it to be a bit bland.  I added sea salt, fresh ground pepper and dill which helped a lot though.

I really liked this soup, although I did add a few touches.  I added onion and mushrooms to the leeks while they were cooking.  I also didn't add as much heavy cream, I used half and half.  I salted and peppered the onion, leek and mushroom mixture while it was cooking as well.

This gets 5 stars for ease but only 3 for taste, hence the four star rating.  Don't forget to add salt and pepper or whatever seasoning you like!  I added a bit of garlic powder and celery.  Next time I will add some fresh, minced garlic.  This is a great base recipe and I can't wait to play with it some more.  Everyone loved the results.

great start, but I changed it around just a bit. I used small yukon potatoes, veggie broth, irish cream butter, and half and half instead of margarine. I also added more salt and pepper as suggested, and a dash of garlic salt. Put some chives on top for color, and delish! Thanks for the pointers and getting me started.

Instead of leeks, try this with kale!  Also add a few links of skinless italian sausage to the potatoes while simmering and about 3/4tsp black pepper to add spice.  I found I use much more chicken broth, and much less cream than the recipe calls for.

A neighbor gave me some leeks, which I had never tasted before. I found this recipe and tried it, and it became one of my favorites. I added bulk Italian sausage to it, which added to the flavor. It's gotten rave reviews from my husband and friends!

This soup is truely comfort food. It is easy to make and everyone in our family, right down to the grandchildren, loves it.  It can be served either hot or cold and is equally good either way. I did add some pepper but because the chicken broth is so salty, I didn't add salt. It didn't need it. To save time and effort, I sauted the leeks in the soup pan and then added the broth and potatoes and simmered until the potatoes were soft. I put everything through the food processer for 45 to 60 seconds then added half and half. Heat it up a little and it's done. It's hard to believe that soup this good can be this easy. Thanks, Michelle, for sharing this wonderful recipe

We loved this soup! I used half Yukon gold potatoes and half red potatoes, left them unpeeled. Very pretty colors. I don't use canned broth, instead use chicken soup base and water, so used enough liquid to cover the potatoes. I zapped about a third of it with the stick blender, perfect texture.  Eyeballed the amount of cream. I would have added some chopped kale for some color balance if I'd had any on hands. And followed the advice to add some cooked bacon. Reheated it the next day for dinner, and it was even better!!

Really tasty soup. So easy to make, too. Used veggie broth instead of chicken and 1% milk instead of cream and it still ended up delicious. Super thick -- even using fewer potatoes and some more milk than the recipe called for. I'd say 4 medium-to-large or 5 small-to-medium, but 6 potatoes would have been way too many for what I made.

I had really big potatoes so I just used 4.  I also added 1 more can of chicken broth.  After we had eaten some of the soup my husband said it was too rich (I had used the heavy cream) so I ended up adding a 3rd can of broth (I then mashed up some extra potatoes to thicken it back up).  It really was good but the heavy cream made it quite rich for us so I think next time I will make it with half and half or milk.  I garnished with some parsely and served it with rolls.  This is great for cold days :).  Will make again and might add some minced ham to it as well.

This soup is so good!  I used 3 leeks and added some thyme to the potatoes while they were cooking, I also added some cayenne pepper to give it a kick.   Instead of heavy cream I was going to add soy milk but I  forgot, I remembered after we ate it and apparently we didn't miss it, it tasted great.

This is a delicious and comforting soup for fall. I added onions and garlic to the leeks when I sautéed them. It added a lot of flavor. I also added a bit of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. Very nice recipe. This is a keeper.

By far one of the easiest, most tasty potato soup recipes.  The leek makes the soup much more flavorful!! Even my picky eaters loved this.  No changes necessary.

Easy recipe that was super yummy! I did make a slight change in the cooking method by boiling the leeks with the potatoes but otherwise I followed the recipe.  Could use more flavor, but a great starting point!

Easy and delicious.  I make this every few weeks and the whole family loves it.  The only change I make is substituting veggie broth for the chicken broth (I'm vegetarian).  Try it.  It's delicious!

This was an easy, quick recipe my child was able to make.  But aside from the heavy cream, it didn't have a lot of flavor.  We had to modify it once it was done.  A good start though.

I make this recipe so often, that I just realized I forgot to come back and rate it.  This is simplicity at it's best, but tastes like gourmet!!  I LOVE this recipe with some fresh scones!!  Just the perfect meal to warm your bones on a cold winter day!!

Very easy to prepare, and so good to eat!

I didn't have cream (or half and half), so I substituted 1 1/2 milk and 1/4 butter.  It was very tasty this way too!

I crave this soup! Easy & delicious.  I recommend using half & half instead of cream, and season the soup with cayenne pepper.  Absolutely scrumptious!  Great recipe.

This is the first time I made Leek and Potato soup. I used this recipe as a base and made some changes. 
I cooked some bacon in a fry pan. Then added 1 Cheyanne pepper, 1 stalk of celery, 1 diced medium onion, a sprig of fresh thyme and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Then added the leeks (both green leaves and stalks).  Finally adding to the softened potatoes and broth mixture .I also left out the cream, mashed some of the potatoes and left it a little chunky. It was delicious and you didnt miss the cream. My boyfriend said it was amazing especially with the kick of the cheyanne. Oh, I also added fresh ground black pepper on top. Delish!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good - I put shaved parmesan on top of the hot soup in the bowls - it melts slightly and I think was a great touch.

Great recipe.  I also cooked the leeks in bacon fat and at the end I added a handful of freshly grated parmesan cheese and a drizzle of good olive oil.  Delicious!!

I used vegetable stock instead of chicken and added one onion to the leek mix, plus some garlic and fresh ground pepper. I also used an immersion blender (or "stick blender") to make this creamy and not chunky before serving. Topped with grated cheese and crumbled bacon (for the non-vegetarians), this was delicious and VERY filling. Also - fast and easy, hardly any mess! Great fall or winter meal and reheats well for lunch the next day.

So simple and so good! I used a little less heavy cream and more chicken broth.  I sauteed half an onion, a clove of garlic, and 2 stalks of celery with the leeks.  I also used about a 1 1/2 tablespoons of real butter.

It tasted okay, as written. I used slightly less potatoes, and half cream, half 2% milk, and that made it soup-like. However, once I added in shredded cheddar cheese, it became PHENOMENAL. As listed, 4 stars. With cheddar cheese added, 5 stars!

This was good, but I was looking for an AWESOME recipe and thought this was a little bland. I added some bacon, onion, cheddar cheese, and pepper to make it more flavorful. Next time, I think I'd try a recipe for baked potato soup instead.

I followed the recipe and ended up having to puree the entire thing because it didn't look that appetizing at all.  I definitely suggest pureeing with about a tablespoon of salt.

This soup is fabulous, and so easy. Every time I make it, I taste it thinking it must need some spices or something, and am always shocked at how good it is. The only modification I make is to substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth since I'm a vegetarian. My husband (meat-eater) loves it too, but our two-year-old doesn't like potatoes, so he doesn't like it.

I used a quart of Chicken broth, added plenty of fresh ground pepper, and sauteed the leeks (I used 3) in clarified butter.  I also only added 1 cup of heavy cream.  Mashing some of the potatoes is a great idea!

I'm currently making this for the second time. Last time it was supposed to be an appetizer and it ended up being the entire dinner! (with French Bread - the recipe for 4 was all gone - and there's only 2 of us!)

I did use milk instead of cream (didn't have any)I do recommend using more leeks than called for and rather than using a "masher", use one of those immersion blenders for a "smoother" consistency.

BTW: If you find the soup to thick, just add more milk.

This recipe was super easy to make. I found it velvety and rich. Although the soup was more like mashed potatoes and needed a little pick me up (pepper or a shot of hot sauce)my family and I really enjoyed this soup. No need to add so many potatoes unless you are going to use milk instead of the heavy cream. I also would recommed using three leeks. We will definately use this recipe again. Thanks so much for sharing!

Thanks for the recipe I used whole milk still came out thick, so thick that when my husband got home from the gym and warmed it up in the micro it turned out like mashed potatos. This was the first time I ever worked with leeks it was super easy and tasty, made my whole kitchen smell divine.

I cooked the leeks in the same pot I used for the potatoes to save washing an extra pot. Also, use Yukon Gold potatoes for an amazingly silky texture that doesn't even need cream added (I just thinned with milk). Mmm, leeks!

I used this as a starting point, but did not add chicken broth.  I added spanish onions because I had some extra in the cupboard. I put in 8 cloves of garlic, some fresh ginger and then to thicken it I used milk, cheese and butter. I would probably add flour next time to make a roue before adding it to the soup.  I also used a "Braun" hand-blender to blend the soup to get a nice creamy texture. Loved it!

This recipe was super easy and disappeared in a flash! ... thanks Michele for sharing as it is definately a do over in this household. 
Just as a small note for those that question the use of other milk product...I didn't have the whipping cream (35%) so added 2% and it was still fantastic!  ;)

Delicious!! I pureed the soup after it was cooked, rather than just mashing it.  Kids loved it, husband loved it. I even shared a bit with my assistant. she's making it tm on her day off. Shared the link with friends on FB :) Simple ingredients, straight-forward instructions, great flavour! Thank you!!

Delish! A few things I did differently other than altering amounts. I always thicken potato soup with either a grated potato or instant potato flakes. I added some white wine (sauvignon blanc) cooking it down a few minutes before adding the cream. I also added some chopped onion to the leeks and carrots with the potatoes. Thanks for a solid base recipe!

I used about 10 potatoes and a box and a half of chicken stock (52 oz?) I boiled the potatoes in the stock for about 20-25 minutes.  I added the leeks after sautéing them in butter.  Then I took the whole lot and used my blender (this is a great place for an immersion blender, but my mom didn't have one.) Then, I added the cream and a little salt and pepper.  The kids LOVED it! My 10 yr old said it tasted like the restaurant (Sweet Tomatoes), so that's high praise.

Everyone LOVED this.... added misc. spices and ground beef... half of the potatoes were already boiled (left overs from the day before) and the other half I boiled in chicken broth just for this..... SUPER YUMMY!

It's pretty good, but a little bland. It could definitely use some bacon or ham - that would put it at five stars, easily.

Super easy and tasty soup.  I left out the milk or cream altogether and just added some seasonings and it was delicious!  I did use my stick blender to make it nice and smooth too.  Definitely making it again.

Great recipe...I just don't get though.  Just rate the recipe as is.  If you want to change it completely, then submit your own.  Seems like no one on this website can admit that someone else can cook something decent.

Very good!  Very rich and even cheesy.  To avoid the texture of the leeks I put the mixture in a blender save a cup or so of some smashed potatoes to give it a little body.   I added a little onion and garlic to the leeks when they were sauteing (butter vs. margarine) as well as a bit more broth to the mixture and some salt and pepper.   Very rich and yummy with the cream!

I love the simplicity of the ENTIRE meal. I picked the recipe because I didn't want a bunch of flavors going on (just a personal preference for Potato Soups). It could not have been easier to pull this soup together! Only thing I added was salt and pepper, and an additional tablespoon of butter while I was sautéing the leeks. I used an entire pint (2 cups) of heavy whipping cream. I didn't have a potato masher so I used a hand mixer right in the pot. It turned out creamy and thick -  but one can add more broth or cream/milk for a runnier consistency. Yummy! Perfect for the cold weather days of December. We'll enjoy the left overs tomorrow.

A great recipe! Added a few things that made it amazing... From others' suggestions, I sauteed two stalks of celery, half a large onion, and two minced garlic cloves with the leeks/butter, and substituted skim milk for cream. I also added a tsp of cayenne and a tsp of paprika (I might add even more next time b/c I like a good kick). While the veggies were sauteing, I also browned thinly sliced chicken breasts that I had rubbed with salt/pepper/random spice mix I found. After I added the veggies and milk to the potatoes, I blended the soup with my immersion blender until it was velvety. Then, I shredded the chicken and added it to the soup so I could get some protein. YUM! Easy and perfect for a cold night.

I dislike it when recipes don't list  ingredient quantities in cups. An indication of vegetable size would help even. Anyway, I made this with three large potatoes and two very large leeks, and it definitely needed a lot more liquid. It turned out tasty but made way more than four servings.

We made this as part of my Kitchen Production class at school - being experienced in the kitchen I saw how little liquid the potatoes had to cook in and wound up adding 2 1/2 cups more. The poor other group made it as written and wound up with potato glue. The recipe needed salt and pepper badly, too, and definitely could have used less fat for sauteeing the leeks. After my alterations, it was a good soup, but as written, you'd need a fork to eat it.

I did not like the texture of this soup.  I had to add an extra can of broth to make it work.  It tasted OK when topped with crispy onions.  I used the cream and it was a bit cloying.  I will try with milk next time.  Also added a lot of seasoning and an onion.

This recipe is so easy and so good! My boyfriend adds chili powder or hot sauce, and I'm usually good with just adding salt and pepper. I tend to use more butter/margarine when cooking the leeks. Served with french bread makes for a perfect dinner!

This is a great tasting soup!  I took the advice of previous reviewers, and I used 2 potatoes, which was plenty.  The leeks were fantastic!  Instead of using 1-1/2 cups of cream, which I felt would be too rich, I used 1/2 cup of cream and 1 cup of fat free milk, along with a lot of pepper and a fair amount of salt.

This is a pretty tasty soup, but beware, the fat content is extremely high.  Did you know that 1 tablespoon of heavy whipping cream contains 5 grams of fat?!?  Next time I may substitute some if not all the heavy cream.  Other than that, it's a pretty simple recipe to follow.

I added one more leek because I love the flavor of leek, and boy did I really enjoy this soup. The extra leek made it that more flavorful. YES I will make it again, and again, and again.

Really good recipe, only 4 star because I had to add a lot more seasoning. I added 1t Lawrys seasoned salt, 1 1/2t Adams all purpose seasoning, 1/2t black pepper, 6 shakes of Tabascoalong with 3t minced garlic from the jar, I had used the heavy cream and then it came out awesome!

It really only makes 4 small servings--depending how you define "small" ;).  In the end, my soup was alright, but needed more leek flavour.

It was really good, but maybe I was using super large potatoes because there wasn't enough broth to cover them and I had to keep turning them over with a spoon so they'd cook evenly. At the end I added a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of garlic powder--just right!

I followed the recipe as instructed. I sweat leek, onions and pasted the garlic. Add the three ingredients with heavy cream didn't require much creamy and pureed it to a creamy texture. Delicious.

I loved it! I used coconut oil to saute the leeks until they were a golden brown and yukon gold potatoes. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream which gave it a lighter consistency. I added some pepper to taste and I almost ate all four servings!

This was so good and not very difficult at all!  I followed other reviewer's advice and used 3 leeks and 3 potatoes, made a roux then stirred in the broth, garlic powder and celery salt (no fresh celery), then pureed til mostly smooth with a few soft chunks.  Added about half of the amount of half-and-half but next time I'll try just using milk.  Got rave reviews on this one - thanks!!!

Great, simple recipe.  Like many of the others I made a few minor changes, I added some celery, salt, fresh ground pepper, fresh minced garlic and I used soya silk instead of heavy cream.  It turned out great.  I did wonder though if you added a bit of bacon when sauteing the leeks if that would also give it some nice flavour.

Very east recipe for my first time making potato leek soup.  I followed recipe (but added salt and pepper and a little chopped onion.) and decided next time I would only use 1 leek chopped and would leave some skins on my red potatoes.  I served this with shredded cheddar cheese on top and some crumbled bacon pieces.  My family loved it! Oh, it was a little thick so next time I may add a little more milk.

I cooked my potatoes first then pureed with broth. I used vegetable broth for the earthy taste. As a final touch I added some Chicken Apple Sausage cut into bite size pieces. This added that extra bit of flavor and  meat that some in my family prefer. Overall this recipe is just wonderful.

Absolutely fabulous flavor!  I, like others, added celery, garlic, and onion with the leeks.  I also substituted fat free half and half to bring down the fat and calorie content.  The only thing that was problematic was that I had to add LOTS more chicken broth, almost a whole box to keep it at a soup consistency.  Yummy!  I'll make it again.

This is easy and yummy, I added salt and pepper as well as a few sliced of cooked crumbled bacon. Instead of whipping cream, I used 1/2 n 1/2.  Will make this again. Lisa in Canada

Yummy, and very quick.  I have made it twice, once added some crumbled bacon, once some chopped up ham.  Both are delicious.  However, the original recipe was a little bland for me.  I use butter and olive oil rather than margarine, and added about a tablespoon of herbes de provence, plus sea salt and coarse ground black pepper.  Very delicious and sets off the leeks nicely.

I love this recipe. I made it as is for the first time through, and it was very good. However, I did make some changes. First, I mashed half of the potatos after boiling them to give the soup a creamier feel. Also, I like very bold flavors, and this soup was a little bland for me, so for some extra zip I added: 2 tsps. onion powder, 1 tsp. granulated garlic, 2 tsps. salt, and a few shakes of ground red pepper. This really stepped up the flavor of the soup and added some much needed salt to it. This is also a great recipe to build off of. Thanks for the great recipe!

I couldn't believe the flavor in this soup.  I made it almost as the recipe said the first time around, but didn't haven any cream, so I added what I did have, which was 1/2 c. of half and half.  I don't even think it needs all that cream, b/c it was just delicious!  We sprinkled a little cheddar on top and YUM! I am making it again right now, but since I don't have 4 potatoes, I am substituting rutabagas, 1 potato (all I have!), carrots and zucchini.  I'm sure it'll be great!

My first time making potAato/leek soup, and with some modifications suggested by others, I give it a 5 stars! The modifications: i used two large baking potatoes diced very small, substituted the 1 1/2 cup of cream for 1 cup of non-fat milk plus 1/2 cup of cream, I added  a 2 finely chopped garlic cloves to the leeks when frying, and 1 cup of water in addition to the milk/cream. I puree all with a manual blending/pureeing machine and when I served, I sprinkled finely chopped cilantro and a dash of cayenne for color. A hit with my two men in the house, and a delicious treat for me! Thank you for the recipe - a keeper and soooo easy to make!

I made this and it was great and easy to do. My boyfriend and my very picky 8 year old both really loved it. the bacon grease is a must! I threw it all in the crockpot for a few hours and it got even better.

So simple and so good.
Imagine spending Christmas day at Epcot, Disney World in the pouring rain.  Now imagine sitting in their English pub eating this delicious soup.  It warmed us up for the rest of the day.
This recipe was exact.  My whole family loved it.

My husband & I really liked this.  I used half and half and added some ground sausage.  I also added salt and pepper to taste.

I've never had potato leek soup and was nicely surprised at how easy and tasty this soup is.  Good for cold stormy weather.
