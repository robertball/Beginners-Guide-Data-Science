We loved this recipe. The funny thing though is I didnt have baking powder so I just double the baking soda. They came out flat but we really liked it that way so I will continue on making it that way. I also added 1/2 cup of coconut. Very yummy. Just be careful on the cooking time. By 8 minutes mine were already a bit too dark so it is usually good to put for 6 minutes and then check it. Very delicious. Thank you so much for sharing.

I have been searching for this recipe for years.  My mother had it when I was young, and it was the first cookie I learned to bake on my own.  My sister loves them, and I'll be making her a batch for Christmas.

Finally, I found the recipe that my grandmother used when we would make these together!  I have fond memories of these cookies, and the dough my grandmother would let me eat.  Thanks for sharing it.  YUMMY!

i used chocolate chunks instead of walnuts in this, and it makes a really yummy chocolate chip cookie base, but the pineapple makes it tastes funky. it doesnt fit in well with the actual cookie, even if there was no chocolate. everyone loved the parts without pineapple, but said the pineapple made it taste "gross."

I was so excited to find this recipe.  I too remember a recipe similar to this one from my childhood.  I am sure this isn't the one.  The recipe looks good, but the cookies turn out very bland and you can hardly taste the pineapple.  Pros for the recipe; the cookies have a nice soft texture and aren't too sweet.  Maybe with something added for more flavor they would be better.

Had my professional chef daughter make them, hoping I had done something wrong.  Same result.  Really awful taste.

These cookies are so moist.  My brother-in-law asks for them every year.  Very easy to make.
