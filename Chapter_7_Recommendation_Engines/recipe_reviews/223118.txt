I was afraid simmering my sliced potatoes would turn them to mush by the time the dish was complete. I rinsed my sliced potatoes and patted dry, placed them in a single layer on a plate and microwaved them for a minute or so and then proceeded with the recipe. If you're able to find ramps (wild leeks) I encourage you to try this. If you like onions and garlic you'll like ramps.  They taste like a cross between the two.

I overboiled the potatoes, so this turned into a delicious bacon and ramp fried mashed potatoes... delicious! I topped it with shredded gouda cheese.

I am new to ramps, thank you for the recipe!

5 large potatoes was way too much for this recipe.   I also over-cooked mine but that was my fault, not the recipe!  What I ended up with was the consistency of a baked potato, but we were ok with that and not bad for a first try!  We have wild onion growing in our backyard and my 12 year old wanted to try cooking with them, and this recipe was perfect  for that.
