This is very similar to a pizza I make quite often, the only changes being that when I roast the Butternut Squash (we call it pumpkin here in Australia) is that I also add a little balsamic vinegar to the roasting pan. This helps the onions and squash caramelise beautifully.  I have also in the past roasted different vegetables to go on the pizza... things like new asparagus, cherry tomatoes, zucchini or eggplant.  Further to that after the vegetables are roasted I add Proscuitto to the pizza, as well as some goats cheese or feta (depending on what I have on hand)and a little parmesan or pecorino along with some mozzarella.  Serve with a simple green salad of baby spinach leaves with a balsamic vinegarette

Wow, I was so surprised by this recipe.  It came out awesome, and I don't normally like Butternut Squash at ALL.  This recipe can even be enjoyed cold.  It's sweet, fragrant, and so good for you.  I used only a small amount of cheese (Monteray Jack & Parmasean).  I also carmelized the onions instead of putting them in the oven with the squash.  
It was someones GREAT suggestion that the butternut squash be boiled on the stove for 4 minutes in order to aid in peeling. Thanx!

This is a great recipe!  Here is how my boyfriend and I spiced this up a bit.  Add Olive Oil and chopped garlic to the crust (we used a already made pizza crust.  Then top with the squash and onions.  Before putting on the Parmesan, top with shredded mozzarella.  Bake the same way as the recipe.  Mmmm....it's so good!

In a word - Amazing. Loaded with flavor. 

I carmelized red onions with a little bit of balsamic and sugar instead of baking them, and put it on top of the roast squash. 

Instead of parm (which I will still try), I used a light (!! - too much would overpower the delicate squash flavor - !!) sprinkling of cheddar and blue cheese. WOW, it kicked it up a notch. 

I made this with Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza crust which made 2 9in pizzas, and in the last few minutes of baking, I slid them off the tray and baked it right on the oven rack to get it nice and crispy. 

I also added some julienned bresaola - a cured italian meat, like procuitto, except made from beef and not pork. It added a nice bit of salt to the savory, and went great with the blue cheese. 

Awesome.

This has turned into one of my top go-to recipes!  I made a few changes for ease - I just make one big pizza and then cut it into squares.  I microwave the grated squash for 5 minutes before adding it to a saute pan with carmelized red onions (instead of white) and the rosemary.  Delicious!

What a find!   I used an oat bran pita bread instead of the pizza dough and pre-cooked/mashed squash in place of the sliced squash.   Once they came out of the oven, we topped with more diced veggies.   Excellent springboard for creative lunches!!!

wow - what a unique and tasty pizza!  i used trader joe's cornmeal pizza dough and added a little garlic salt and a dash of cayenne to the squash prior to roasting.  also, i topped the pizzas with the cheese during the last 10 minutes of baking.  my husband dislikes squash and loved these!  thanks!  (the squash is a bit of a beast to cut before roasting...any suggestions?)

This is really good and a healthy alternative to traditional pizza.  I used half the dough for the amount of toppings and increased the cheese, using a combination of asaigo and mozzerella.  Yum, also good heated up for my lunch.

OH. MY. GAWD.  Can you say good???  I've made this twice in 2 weeks now!  I ground some fennel seed with dried rosemary and sprinkled that over the squash & onions.  I made just one large pizza, and on the crust I spread a light coating of Aldi's Balsamic Glaze...you could make your own (its a thickened balsamic basically) or you could use a decent balsamic vinegar.  Then I put the squash mixture, added moz, shredded parm, and some crumbled feta.  SO good!

I've made this a few times now and have to say I've enjoyed it every time. I peel the squash then lop off the bottem and scoop out the seeds. Then slice it super thin and roast it as instructed. My personal preference is to use homemade pizza dough and to drizzle the onions w/ balsamice vinegar before roasting.  I use asiago cheese and instead of sprinkling it over the top I cover the dough w/ a thin layer and arange the onions and squash on top.  DO NOT make the mistake of expecting a gooy, cheesy take-out pizza!  It is a beautiful pizza and very unique.  Make this and present it as a classy new dish for your family and guest.

This pizza was delicious! A few things:
-boil butternut squash for a few minutes to make chopping/peeling easier before putting it in the oven.
-adding tons of olive oil and garlic to the pizza crust is a must
-added feta cheese crumbles to kick it up a notch
Next time, I'm going to make a creamy sauce out of cream, melted asiago, garlic and onion for the base to build some flavor.

I thought it was ok...and alittle bland and I don't mind blande. My 10 year old liked it and my husband made so many faces while eating it I got up and made him a sandwich. If I were to make it again I would add a lot to it...more cheese, mushcrooms, cherry tomatoes, garlic, a little more rosemary but I doubt I will be making it again.

Delicious.  I followed other reviewers' recommendations and roasted the squash mixture with a little balsamic vinegar.  I used Trader Joe's garlic and herb pizza dough.  It was fabulous and healthy to boot.  Even my steak-and-potato-eating husband raved about this pizza!

The best flavor combinations ever! I used roasted butternut squash, red onions, and eggplant - delicious! I loved the balsamic, oil, and rosemary combination. Also, for cheese I lightly sprinkled a combo of parmesan, feta (fat free), and mozarella (2%). I made the crust from a pizza dough recipe on this site. The second time I made this I doubled up the recipe and froze six 8-10" pizzas. After they cooled I wrapped them in foil and then ziploced them. When I wanted one, I simply got it out of the freezer, unbagged it, left it in the foil and covered but with the foil loosely opened. I would cook on 350 for about 20 minutes! Delicious every time!

Made this today and it was really great! Gave it 4 stars because I think it tasted better with some spicy marinara dip to give it some sauce, and added some feta.. also I would suggest cooking the dough until it was golden and then adding the toppings, perhaps putting it back in for a few minutes to warm and melt the cheese..
It still tasted good, but the dough wasn't cooked all the way and the onions and squash were going to get burnt if I didn't take it out.
(It might just of been the dough I used, though)

This butternut squash and rosemary pizza wasn’t too fussy to prepare and was pretty decent. It has some interesting flavors but I probably would not recommend it if you are not a fan of butternut squash. The tang and saltiness of the asiago helped to contrast against the sweetness of the butternut squash. If you are a fan of sweet potato, I would definitely explore with this type of squash since they have similar flavors. I didn’t have the cornmeal to place in the pan, but greasing it works perfectly fine as well.

Great pizza and easy to make. It was sweater than I realized it was going to be - probably from the butternut squash. We didn't measure out the Parmesan cheese and just sprinkled on as much as looked satisfying. Extremely tasty. I'll be making it again.

This was really delicious! I used the Trader Joe's ready to bake whole wheat Pizza Crust for it. I also made it into 4 pizzas instead of quartering the two. I will definitely be making again.

I feel this would be perfect as an appetizer----cut into small rectangles.  I didn't love it as a dinner pizza.  I did add bacon as some suggested---glad I did, not sure I would've liked it as much without.  The flavors of the squash, rosemary, onions, bacon & cheese are all very distinct, in a great way.

Good recipe, but I prefer my own pizza dough.  It's so easy to make!  3 cups unbleached a/p flour, 1tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp yeast, 13 fl. oz. warm water.  Mix in food processor until well blended and dough forms a ball.  Let rise in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes.  Kneed on a floured surface for a minute, then return to the bowl for a second rise until doubled in volume.  Roll out into rounds or refrigerate for up to 2 or 3 days for later use.  I usually substitute about half a cup of whole wheat flour for the same amount of the unbleached white flour for some added flavor, but this is optional.  I harvested about 200 pounds of butternut from the garden this year, so this recipe will get lots of use with many variations along the way.

Was really skeptical about the whole squash pizza combination, was totally surprised by the yumminess of these pizzas!!!!!! Excellent comfort food.  I used mozzerella, tasted great!  
Definetly try this recipe.

This is surprisingly delicious.  Based upon prior reviews, I added blue cheese, cheddar cheese, a small amount of chopped pancetta that i had in the fridge, as well as a piece of leftover chicken.  I used a trader Joe's herb pizza crust

This recipe was by far my favorite by allrecipes so far!  I altered it a little by adding bacon slices to be roasted with the onions, roseary, etc.  The juices from the bacon gave it a great taste!  I also did not have cornmeal and it was still delicious!  I added minced garlic under the cheese so it could cook well without getting burnt.  I could eat this pizza every week! Thank you for this recipe!

This was good, but the squash took a lot longer to cook than I had anticipated.  Also, I should have done what other reviewers said they did and carmelized the onions on the stovetop.  They didn't turn out as well in the oven.

My family was skeptical when I started making this pizza but ended up loving it.  I made my own crust using the Pizza Crust for the Bread Machine II recipe here on Allrecipes and divided the dough to make two small pizzas.  I also added one clove of chopped garlic to the roasted squash, onions, and rosemary.  I used goat cheese, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese lightly on it.  It was wonderful.  I do think it would be good with a contrasting flavor like ham or chicken especially for those who like some meat on their pizza.

I made this in a super healthy way tonight and it was delicious! I had a bag of cubed butternut squash I needed to use up. I sliced up the cubes into thirds to get thinner pieces, arranged them evenly on a baking pan lined with wax paper, and brushed organic coconut oil over the squash. Instead of olive oil, I melted 1/2 tbs of Nutiva extra virgin coconut oil in a small pan (other oils become toxic when cooking to high heat- I only use olive oil when it's consumed without heating i.e. mixing with balsamic vinegar and pepper as a salad dressing, making bruschetta or tabouleh etc). I sprinkled italian seasoning, pepper, and a dash of sea salt, and baked in my convection toaster oven for 20 mins. On the stovetop, I caramelized a brown onion with balsamic vinegar and finely diced organic garlic clove. I used a Classico Crostini Pizza Crust which only has 30mg of sodium per 1/3 crust! I brushed the crust with a lil bit of melted coconut oil, layered butternut squash, caramelized onion and garlic, and lightly topped with Kraft 'with a touch of Philadelphia cream cheese' mozzarella cheese. It was good as is but I decided to add avocado, tomato, and dabbed a lil bit of Litehouse kefir yogurt probiotic blue cheese salad dressing and was AMAZING!!! I only add the avocado, tomato, and dressing on the individual slice as I'm ready to eat it. The kefir blue cheese dressing was really the key, it tastes like reg blue cheese dressing, you cant even tell it's a healthy version!

needs more flavors. can only eat one slice at a time because it is so bland. definitely not a full meal. but it is a good base recipe for something grander.

Alone, the butternut squash did not do it for me.  But on the honey wholewheat pizza crust with caramelized onion, mozza and fresh parm, it was absolutely delicious!  I was surprised that even the pickest of my family loved it!  See my submitted picture of butternut squash to see the easiest way to cook the squash.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe, I will be making this over and over again!

Wow!  I forgot to rate this the first time I tried this. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I just made it again tonight from memory and still have that 'yummy in my tummy' feeling again!  I especially love it because I have an allergy to the acid in normal tomato sauce and the squash is amazingly similar in texture but without the acid that bothers me.  Also I used less oil, only about 1 T, and it was fine, though I think I used less squash too.  I used a flat bread that was premade so I only needed to use my toaster oven for about 3 minutes.  So delcious and easy. I will be making this more regularly.

I loved this recipe and it was the first time I ever ate butternut squash! What a sheltered life! I did slightly change a few things....first, I boiled the squash for about 4-5 minutes and it made it so much easier to peel and cut. Next, I used a pre-made whole wheat pizza crust and brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled with oregano, salt, and pepper. I baked the squash and fresh rosemary (without the onions) as directed. I cooked the onions in a saucepan on the stove with a tablespoon or so of olive oil, and about the same of balsamic vinegar. I also added about a teaspoon or so of sugar to the onions and cooked until soft. I then sprinkled some asagio cheese on the crust, placed the baked squash, then the onions, and then MORE cheese and oregano before placing in the oven. Delicious! I love this recipe! I made it twice this week! My meatarian husband even liked it!

This is a great recipe that can have additional toppings as desired and is a great switch from the traditional pizza. My husband looked at me crazy when I started making this but ended up putting some chicken on his pieces and dipping it in BBQ sauce, loving every mouthful! I added mozzarella like other reviewers suggested. Yummy! This is a keeper!

I used a jiffy crust mix (so fast and easy).  And I roasted my squash first.  I think it's way easier than peeling and slicing the squash. I also put the cheese on the pizza before it went into the oven.  It melted into the squash and made it like a cheesy squash hot dish on the crust.  I used Gruyere cheese, because it tastes so good and I used almost a cup instead the little that this recipe calls for.  This recipe was great inspiration, my house smelled so good while it was baking.

Delicious!

I added a few ingredients that made it so good:

After putting the squash mixture on the dough, I added the layer of onions, some garlic, fresh basil, and fresh baby spinach. Then I added the layer of cheese to trap it all in. Finally, I added around 10-15 cubes of delicious feta cheese. The saltiness of the feta was a nice balance to the sweetness of the squash. Oh and, I used home-made whole-wheat dough fused with oregano, dried basil and rosemary. For the crust, make to dribble some cheese onto it to make it ten times more delicious!

SO GOOD!

I was really excited to try out this recipe. I love the flavors of roasted butternut squash and onions but sadly this pizza was nothing more than "alright". We ate it because there was nothing wrong with the flavors, but there was nothing memorable about the pizza that would make me want to make it again.

Very nice!  I used the Premium Pizza Crust recipe from here for the dough, and I made two different pizzas with it, including this one.  I just made another pizza for bf bc he's not a fan of butternut squash.  I really like this--the flavor is sweet, like the squash, and it's tasty and filling.  I did find it a little hard to mix the squash together without well, squashing it, but it still worked out okay.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing recipe. Super easy and it comes out looking like you spent hours slaving over dinner! One of the first recipes where I wouldn't change a thing! I did forget to mention I nuked the potatoes until they were medium soft so I didn't have to cut them into tiny pieces and it worked out perfectly.

This recipe filled my house with a beautiful smell and tasted perfect. We followed the directions exactly and used Trader Joe's garlic and herb pizza dough. This will not disappoint.

Delicious and healthy change from the usual pizza!  I added fresh grated parmesan cheese with slices of purple onion and prosciutto ham on top.  I made these for my family at Christmas.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe was VERY good as is and the only thing we added was some crushed red pepper, about 1/2 tsp. We like a little spice and I think it was a great improvement. This is a great pizza for me since I'm vegetarian and I think next time I'll add a base sauce of cream cheese mixed with veggie stock and garlic.

This pizza was fantastic.  The reviews were difficult to decipher because it seemed that everyone was reviewing a personalized version of the recipe and not the recipe itself.  I made it exactly as it says and it was amazing.  The key is to slice the butternut squash incredibly thin.  Some people commented that the cooking time was not long enough, but when I looked at other people's uploaded photos, it is clear that they had made very thick slices...if made the way the recipe describes, this is a very delicious pizza.  On a side note, I chose to go the Asiago route...very good...but next time I make it, I think I will use a little more than the recommended 2 tbsp...I am a cheese lover.

Really tasty! We skipped the onions and added goat cheese.  Peeling the squash was a huge pain, next time we're going to cook it and put it on like a sauce, with green beans and chicken

This pizza was light, but so tasty.  I didn't use the cornmeal and I used the whole wheat pizza crust from Trader Joe's.  I used Asiago cheese and it turned out perfect.

This was great! I did change a few things- I carmelized two red onions and garlic in one cup of red wine.  I also added sugar and basamic vinegar to the squash.  I rubbed olive oil on the dough and sprinkled it with italian seasoning.   Cooked in the oven and had olive oil, balsamic and italian seasoning in a bowl to dip the crust in!  It was great, def be making this again :)

Absolutley loved this recipe but did make a few minor changes.  I took half the butternut squash and puree'd it with a touch of milk to the consistency of a ragu' and used it as a base on the pizza.  I also used goats cheese and mozz. and sauteed mushrooms & garlic allowing the guests to build thier own pizza.  I also did the pizza on the grill to really get that crispy crust.  It was a major success.

great pizza! for a milder taste, ricotta and mozzarella is the answer. But if you want to dare, blue cheese along with mozzarella is what you are looking for:-)

I've been making a lot of squash since it's in season right now, and feeling very thankful to allrecipes for so many interesting recipes.  This was awesome bf and I really enjoyed- I omitted the salt to taste and just used pepper.  Really tasty~ thanks! :D

Better with a thinner crust. I also would like it with more cheese than called for in the recipe - although it would be less healthy then.

I've had very similar to this before and it was great! The way I've had it also includes using regular pizza sauce, topping with the onions and squash as described and then putting dollops of goat cheese instead of the listed cheese(s) and then topping with some shredded mozzerella.

Delicious! My absolute new favorite recipe! Everyone in my house loved it and it's become one of our favorites to make.  I love using fresh squash and pre-baking it in the oven, then the whole house smells like fall. The precooked squash works great when you need to save some time. And it still is just as delicious. Yum yum yum yum!

I have never made anything with Butternut Squash before but I was given one so I looked up different recipes and decided to try this. We like a sauce based pizza so I made a homemade sauce and skipped the extra olive oil at the end. I also added sweet red pepper to the squash and onions. I made a homemade crust and added garlic and herbs to it. For the cheese I used parmesan and mozzarella. I followed the roasting and baking times above and OMG it turned out delicious!!

This is absolutely delicious, easy and different. Only recipe additions I made were adding some balsamic vinegar and garlic cloves when carmelizing then made one large pizza.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Oh, and added a bit of shredded mozzarella as well.  Yum!

Awesome! Made exactly as written. I tried this with an "original" style crust, but next time I'm going to try a thin crust. This would be excellent with a homemade whole wheat thin crust.

I love butternut squash and loved the idea of making pizza with it. In an attempt to make it a little healthier I really skimped on the olive oil. Don't do that. It needs it. Mine was a little dry. I had a bit or two of my boyfriends (with the appropriate amount of olive oil) and it was perfect! Also we cooked the other half of the squash as directed for the pizza and it was delicious all on its own!

Learning experience: There is a difference between butternut and acorn squash.  All squash is not the same.  Good to know.  However, even with the acorn squash it was really good- but I'd go with the butternut next time.

This was pretty good. It needed a bit more flavor (a little more parmesan did the trick). I ended up putting fresh mozzarella on ours so it looked more like a pizza and my kid would eat it. I actually preferred it that way.

Not fantastic.  Bleh...used pita-type thingies for the crust.  Pureed the squash and added 2 Amaretti cookies (World Market) a little salt, and some half and half to give it sweetness and make it creamier.  Not sure if I'd make again, maybe I'll try a homemade crust.

This was great.  I made my pizza dough out of a focaccia bread recipe found on this site.  I didn't have rosemary so I used dried thyme instead, and added prosciutto along with the squash on top of the pizza.  I also topped mine with some mozzarella as well as parmesan.

I have made this recipe twice and it was delicious on both occasions. I only gave it 4 stars though because I made a couple of changes. For the rosemary, 1 tsp was not enough so I used closer to 2 tbsp. For the cheese, I used at least a cup over 2 pizzas it made. 10 minutes was also not enough, it took 15.

This was excellent.  Like a gourmet flat bread.  I just used pre-made thin crust pizza crust and tossed a little crushed red pepper to the grated Parmesan cheese that was spinkled over it.   Very nice with a salad. Loved it!

Instead of pre-baking the squash and onions, I just sliced them thin, spread them over the whole wheat herbed crust, then topped with rosemary.  After baking for 15 minutes at 400, this was great!  Its's a very tasty idea!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical, but this was awesome!  I did add a little bit of mozzarella on top, but followed the recipe otherwise.

I loved the flavor of this.  I think I did something wrong with the pizza crust though, cause it was soggy in the middle. (If I cooked it any longer the outside would burn.)I think next time I will bake the crust for a bit before adding the squash.

This recipe was awesome! I don't like squash, so I tried it with carmelized onions, Roasted red peppers, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It was so delicious! Be careful to follow the recipe for the rosemary - I didn't measure and just "winged it" and the rosemary was VERY overpowering!

Loved it. Made our own whole wheat herbed crust using basil and rosemary. Added just a bit of mozzarella because we like a lot of cheese. Will definitely make again.

I made this today and my husband and I both really enjoyed it.

As recommended my other reviewers, I roasted the veg with balsamic vinegar and put mozerella cheese and goats cheese on top of the pizzas before cooking.

Thanks a lot for the recipe - I'm sure I will make it again soon!

This has become a family staple at my house - even my kids love it - & it gets rave reviews when I've served it for guests as an appetizer.  I make it on a Trader Joe's whole wheat crust.  Sometimes we add sauteed spinach or kale to it; have also omitted the rosemary on occasion.  Will try the balsamic vinegar addition next time!  I've also cooked the squash this way & served as a side dish (w/o the pizza crust).  Thanks for posting this - we love it!

Excellent! I also used a dash of cayenne to the squash, which was great. I added a little turkey bacon and it was a nice, but I would suggest not to put too much or it overpowers the squash. Feta was key also. This night turned into a pizza making party and we made all different kinds, tons of fun!

I love this pizza, but the peeling of the squash was a major pain, so the second time I made it, I used the hint from LadyClotho and put the squash in boiling water for 4 minutes.  It was way easier to peel.  Thanks, LadyClotho for the tip.  Also, it freezes well and heats up in the oven in no time.  Great for a late night snack.

The taste and flavor of this pizza was awesome.  I substituted red bell pepper for the onions.  The only reason I'm only giving this recipe a 4 star rating is because of the hassle and work involved in skinning and slicing the butternut squash.  I researched easier ways after spending over half an hour trying to peel and slice one, and found that if you boil the whole squash in a covered pot for about 4 minutes, so the skin is punctuable by a toothpick, but only the skin, it's easier to peel.  I'm going to try it next time.

Pretty good! I used a homeade dough that I had preveiously frozen and whole wheat. We dipped it in a marinara sauce and made for a nice dinner. We also doubled the cheese. Will make again! Thanks!

I will admit that I used way more cheese than the recipe calls for, using up a variety of cheese odds and ends we had in the house. HUGE thanks to the reviewer that suggested the boiling water as a way to make peeling the squash easier. That tip was a lifesaver.

I love, love, love this pizza! My husband and I have it for dinner often. It is perfect as written. I've also added mushrooms, olives, celery, spinach, and peas with great results. I made a "Halloween version" of this pizza by cutting the butternut squash into jack o' latern shapes, and adding black olive "spiders"! I also always make the crust using the Master Pizza Dough recipe from Allrecipes, as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I really enjoyed this pizza. I used a whole wheat artisan pizza dough, which I thought went really well with the toppings. The leftovers are even yummy.

This is delicious! The only change I made was to caramelize the onions and put that on top of the squash when assembling. The flavors of the onions, the squash, the cheese, and rosemary all come together so beautifully! Thanks for the recipe :)

Yum, I cooked the squash (used veggie peeler to thinly slice) and onion on the stovetop and added the balsamic as others did, in addition to the Asiago I added goat cheese, topped with the oil and more fresh ground black pepper, delish. Used the NY pizza dough recipe...very thin crust was perfect.

This was delicious! I really like the review that said to add some balsamic vinegar in the roasting process. It really added a wonderful flavor to the pizza. I used a premade pizza crust and added 1/4 cup of ricotta under the butternut squash. So much flavor and a feel good meal.

Used exact seasonings/amnt of oil & tossed squash in ziplock bag. Threw in red bell peppers & zucchini-amazing! Spred veggies out on non-greased baking sheet, baked 13 mins. Rolled out Jillian's gluten,dairy,wheat free dough, spread la pizza sauce(3tbs), placed veggies on pizza then topped w parm & mozz. Also used tip about brushing olive oil on crust.Excellent tip! Baked 12 mins, until crust was golden brown & cheese melted. Was told it was best pizza people ever had. It really was too! We live mins frm NYC, so that's saying something :-)

I liked this recipe but, like most reviewers, I thought it was good but not great. I thought it had potential though, so I've been tinkering with it and I think I've figured out some simple additions that make it extra yummy! 
First off, I boil the squash for about 15 minutes so its soft. then I use a peeler to peel off slices of squash so they lay flat and overlap nicely on the pizza crust. If the squash is boiled long enough there's no need to cook it alone for additional time; just layer it onto your crust and put it all in the oven. 

Before you spread the squash onto the crust, mix it thoroughly with white truffle oil. This gives it way more pop than boring olive oil. 

I spread asiago, parmesan, and romano cheese over the top before putting it in the oven. Once out, I add roasted pine nuts and a balsamic reduction, for smokey sweetness. (tip: my favorite so far has been theoliveoilexperience.com's vanilla balsamic.)

Yum!  This was delicious.  I added a bit more rosemary than the recipe called for, but that was my only change.  Be sure to wipe away excess cornmeal from the baking sheet before popping in the oven -  I learned the hard way that the excess cornmeal will burn.  Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

I substituted the pizza dough and used a pita pocket for the crust which turned out great! Suggested if you are looking for a lighter option.

I was trying to find something to do with my butternut squash that was NOT soup and this was a great alternative! I felt like such a foodie because of how sophisticated it tasted. I took the recommendations of several reviewers and roasted the onions and squash with balsamic vinegar, and used mozzarella cheese with a sprinkling of parmesan because I didn't have enough. I used fresh rosemary, and on one of the pizzas  added sun dried tomatoes but that taste was overpowering, so I wont do that again. I only gave it 4 stars because it could have used some garlic, and on some bites it was a little bland. We found that a little Alfredo dipping sauce did the job. We'll definitely be making this again!!!

Surprisingly good!  I added way more Parmesan than the 2TBSP called for and I added it before I put it back in the oven for 10 mins.  I used a sprinkling of dried rosemary.  I only gave it 4 stars because I believe this would taste a million times better if you used a pizza "crust" made of phyllo dough instead.  I'll try it that way next time.

I made several changes based off of other reviews and what I had on hand. I love butternut, but didn't grow any this year, but instead used part of a Guatemalan Blue squash that is similar in flavor that I have in my garden this year. I used a Boboli crust so, I didn't need the cornmeal. I carmelized the onion in balsamic and a pinch of sugar while oven roasting the squash. I minced garlic into olive oil and rubbed that on the crust before putting toppings on. I put the onion and squash on, and added hot pepper flakes, six pepper sauce, and sliced up andouille sausage, then topped with parmesan. It was very tasty! At first the sweetness of the squash comes through, and then the added spices - nice combo, and I'll probably make it again!

I made this according to the recipe and it was pretty good, but the next time I decided to mix it up a bit. I used wheat pizza dough and I took chunks of butternut squash, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and a bit of garlic chili sauce and sauteed it in a pan for several minutes. Then add that to the crust and top with cilantro and soy mozzarella cheese and bake according to the recipe. It is soooo delicious! I will be making it much more often!!!

Brushed the pizza crust with a little bit of melted butter, rosemary and garlic. Served with blue cheese dressing drizzled on top. Very good!

Did a light covering of pizza sauce on the dough before baking.  Also did not use fresh rosemary as I have a lot of dried (I live in France).  And used a LOT more than 2TBSP of cheese.  This was the perfect recipe to use up that half of a butternut I had sitting in the fridge.  Merci beaucoup!

Maybe we had too much pizza dough but my thought was that it needed more oil, more cheese and more squash..

This has so many stars because people have changed/added things to this recipe but still gave it 5 stars... its kind of misleading. I made this as is, except I used butter w/ garlic powder instead of oil (flavor preference), a home-made crust (jays signature pizza crust from this site) and I ended up using way more cheese... 2 tablespoons is not nearly enough for a recipe with the word "pizza" in its name! I steamed my squash in the microwave for 3 minutes before I put it on my dough, rather than roasting it & used the butter to make a 'sauce'.  I layered everything on my unbaked dough, and baked it at 425 until my crust was golden and the squash and onions were cooked perfectly this way. This was kind of bland, but still good.... I wouldn't call it a pizza when made as the recipe says, its more like a flat bread... I love the idea of this though so I will make this again with changes... ill use 1/4 cup of butter with garlic and parsley for the sauce and ill add sliced mushrooms as well as mozzerella and some feta cheese with the asiago cheese. Ill also add some sugar and a pinch of salt to the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza, I think the sugar will go nicely with the squash. I think this would also taste good with an alfredo sauce.

I made a pizza based on this recipe as a starting point because I didn't have or couldn't get all the ingredients. And it was great to follow regardless! What I changed was yellow squash instead of butternut, basil pesto instead of rosemary, both asiago and parmesan cheeses, also I used ready pizza dough and threw in some everyday seasoning (both from trader joes), then also added some dried oregano and garlic powder. So delicious!

Added additional rosemary, mozzarella cheese & Italian sausage to the second one... was better. Edible, not even close to "great." Probably will not make again.

I tried the recipe as written, and it was savory but bland.  I think this recipe would do well with a strong flavored cheese.  And I liked other people's suggestions--caramelizing the onions, for example, or adding chopped garlic.  I will try this again, but it needs more flavor.

I made homemade dough (and forgot to use the cornmeal), roasted the onions with balsamic vinegar, and sprinkled parmesan, goat cheese, and mozzarella cheese on top. The flavors were good; it didn't work well as a main dish for us. (Four adults.) After two small pieces I was wishing for regular pizza instead! I just couldn't eat a lot of it. However, I think it would work great as an appetizer. I almost threw the leftovers away, but in the end put it in the fridge. Ate a slice cold the next day, and it was still pretty good. Not good enough, though, because the remainder sat in the fridge a week till I dumped it. Not sure I'll make it again.

It was bland and the ingredients did not mix well.  My wife and I both took a bite, looked at each other, grabbed the phone, and ordered some NY style from the local pizza shop.  I don't recommend this at all.

super yummy. My kids loved it! I did adjust it a bit, using a full pizza size and adding some brown sugar. I also carmelized the onions and added it to the top. I used mozzerella and parmesean cheeses. Definently a keeper!

I was very hesitant to try this recipe but I can't get enough of it. I did use the honey wheat pizza dough from this site instead of buying some though. I also used the balsamic vinegar tip.

I made this using Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough which I prebaked just several minutes before adding the toppings.  I boiled the butternut for 4 minutes for easy pealing and slicing.  I added a little more cheese than the recipe called for and was pretty darn good.  A little sweet so I'd like to try adding something to balance the flavors.  If I can think of something, I'll be making it again.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I also pre-cooked the squash and used pita bread instead of pizza dough as some others mentioned.  I am in love with butternut squash and this recipe just fuels my love affair!  I could eat this pizza every day and not get tired of it!

My husband liked this recipe a lot more than I did.  I caramelized the onions rather than roasting them and I should have used twice as many since they really cooked down.  They were what made the pizza good, in my opinion.  I used whole wheat crust from Trader Joe's and the crust was sort of dull and tough.  I did enjoy the pizzas, but I think this recipe could have used something more, maybe some sort of tangy sauce.  I might try serving it with BBQ sauce next time.

Made this with Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site. I'm a huge fan of roasted squash and onions, so I expected this to dazzle me more than it did. But I still liked it a lot. I preferred the onion taste to the squash on this, surprisingly. I will probably make it again as a nice alternative to a regular pizza.

My husband was amazed by the idea of this recipe, after he tried the first bite, he was sold.  This is a unique and tasty combo - we LOVE it!

I also added some balsamic vinegar to the squash and onions and used a Boboli crust.  Very tasty but there was way too much squash to fit on the crust and it did keep falling off.  Maybe turning the squash into a puree/sauce would work better.

This is a good basic recipe but when I made it I added a lot more to it. I'm a big fan of vegetarian pizza's so I added spinach, roasted red peppers, and sundried tomatoes and some fete cheese. Also, pizza dough is not always available so the second time I made it I used Greek style pitas without the pockets and cooked it for less time. But they are not always an option, so you could also use prebaked pizza doughs as well.

Thought this recipe was fantastic! Following other users' suggestions, I added thinly sliced zucchini and cherry tomatoes plus a dash of balsamic vinegar to the roasted vegetables; and I used goat cheese instead of parmesan. WOW! What a flavor combination. Something about the sweetness of the roast vegetables with the salty of the pizza crust with the gooey cheesiness of the goat cheese. A definite keeper! Oh, and the 4 minute boil of the butternut squash worked perfectly.

This was amazing! Based on other reviews, I did make some changes. I carmelized the onions instead of roasting them with the squash and I put the parmesan cheese on the pizzas when cooking them. I used "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" recipe for the dough. I will definitely be making these again.

This was SO good, and very 'gourmet'! My husband and I both thought it was a great change of pace for a pizza, and very seasonal. I was very impressed with this! I did follow the advice of others and add a splash of basalmic vinegar during roasting. I used the 'crazy pizza crust' recipe listed here which produced a great thin crust that complimented this recipe perfectly.

Update: I actually use this as a base recipe and make it often. I should post another recipe, but here goes. I do not use squash. I saute garlic and onions. Spread some tomato paste on the two pizzas and top with the sauted garlic and onions (sometimes add romemary). I wait until they are almost done to sprinkle with parm. cheese. I have changed this, but I really like the pizza and it is better than store bought.

Husband thought this was really good. I had a hard time making the pizza's, but with alot of kneading it worked out. I am not a big fan of butternut squash, I just added the onions to mine. Added fresh grated parmasan cheese.

This was amazing!!! I made the squash and onions just like you said. I spread olive oil and garlic on the dough, and used mozzarella, chèvre and honey on top. My husband and I loved every bite. Even my 11-year-old daughter, who is a traditional pizza person, really liked it. Thank you!! We’ll be making it a lot.

Awesome! I used a bit more cheese (1/25 cups) and added red bell pepper slices to the roast. Also, instead of drizzling the remaining  oil on top of the whole pizza, I added a little garlic and brushed the crust before assembling.

I made this for the first time today. We loved it! Here are the changes I made because if you've seen my reviews, you know I make it how my family likes:
First, I used a cauliflower crust I bought in the frozen section of my grocer and precooked it for 10 minutes. While that was cooking, I tossed the squash (which I cut thinly and bite sized) and onions with the olive oil, fennel seeds and rosemary (same amount each), 1 clove finely minced garlic, a tablespoon of balsamic, teaspoon of honey, and salt and pepper. I roasted according to the directions. I put the mixture on the crust with shredded prosciutto, asiago, parmesan and feta cheese. I added more salt and pepper then sprinkled  basil and garlic powder on top for more flavor. 
We had to use a knife and fork to eat it but it was worth the effort. Thanks to all the reviews for helping me come up with the changes! Yum!

I've made this a few times. The only thing that I change is the pizza base. I don't have the time or patience to make the dough from scratch, so I follow the instructions for the toppings, but put them on garlic naan bread that has been warmed up in the toaster oven. One half squash covers 2 pieces of naan so make sure you have 4 pieces of naan or save the other half of the squash for something else.) I also like to drizzle a little olive oil over the pizzas before serving. :)

I didn't make changes but I enhanced it a little.  I used a good quality pita bread, I brushed olive oil and garlic on it before adding the toppings.  
I caramelized the onions and added goat cheese in addition to the parmesan.  With these changes it was restaurant quality.  Served with a glass of wine and it was if we were at some fancy gourmet pizza bistro. 
wow, wow, wow!

Honestly amazing, added nutritional yeast before adding the cooked onions/butternut squash to the pizza bread. Changes the whole game and works well with the sweetness of the butternut squash. YUMMY!

i didnt have all the ingredients but the idea of this was awesome. I used a mixture of hummus and pesto sauce because we wanted a red sauce of some sort.  you definitely need the corn meal for the bottom of the dough but it was still good.

Love this pizza! We make butternut squash pizza about 3-4 times a year and have tried different variations of this recipe 
(like italian herb seasoning and mozzarella instead of rosemary and asiago) and it tastes great EVERY TIME!

Add shredded cheddar cheese as well. Could benefit from some sort of creamy/cheesy alfredo sauce. Bake veggies for 5 extra min. Use a thin crust.

We used fresh mozzarella and a sprinkling of goat cheese. We did a lot of caramelized onion on top along with roasted garlic slices and ham fried in bacon fat so it had those yummy crispy edges. We also added 1-2 tsp sage to squash puree. Old and young all liked it!

This is one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten! I used a homemade recipe for the dough and caramelized the squash and onions with balsamic vinaigrette like some of the other reviews suggested. My husband and I both devoured it. I think I actually love it even more than traditional pizza.

So good! I did make some changes - I roasted both butternut squash and eggplant together with whole spring of rosemary (chopped up), plus pepper/salt. While those were roasting, I caramelized red onions with some garlic, earthy spices (pre-made mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, and savory spices) and a bit of a homemade "balsamic vinaigrette" sauce (ACV, sugar, and some red wine) since I didn't have any on hand. For the crust, I brushed a pre-made  garlic/herb pizza dough from Trader Joe's with olive oil and baked it until it was firm before adding the toppings. Once everything was done, I added fresh spinach (pre-chopped) to the top, covered it with a mixture of asiago, parmesan, fontina, and provolone cheeses and baked for a few more minutes. It turned out AMAZING! I think using caramelized red onions + spices with this dish is really essential to rounding out the flavors. Will definitely make again!

This was very tasty.  I added garlic and green pepper to the squash mixture to bake.  Then i used garlic salt and pepper.   I was nervous if my hubby would like it so I cut up some sandwich ham for the top.   I then put on a mixture of Italian cheeses.   Yum.     Next time I will leave off the ham.  I didn't think it was needed.

I agree with other reviewers that this was very bland. I bought a basil pesto white sauce to use for this, and that added a lot of flavor. I also think it needs some garlic. This is a good base recipe, but definitely needs more flavor than what is given.

Pretty bland, I even added roasted peppers. Not bad, just kind of what I expected. Would be pretty good with goat cheese I think, the tanginess would be a good addition to the flavors.

We really liked this pizza. It took longer in the oven to soften the squash. I did add balsamic to the mix, and chopped artichoke hearts to the pizza assembly on Naan bread and topped with toasted pine nuts. Nice pizza spin. Thank you!

I thought it was pretty good.  Although I took the advice of some others and used some balsamic vinegar while I was roasting the squash and onions.  I think next time I'll try this with a little prosciutto or something similar for a little more flavor.

I have made this pizza a few times now.  The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious but I did think it could use a little bit more flavor.  The second time, I followed somebody's recommendation of parboiling the butternut squash for a few minutes prior to peeling and slicing.  That makes this SO much easier.  Also, because I use rosemary in almost everything, I was out and had to improvise.  I caramelized the onions in balsamic and sugar on the stove and just pan fried the squash a little bit to avoid having to cook it in the oven.  To add a little bit more kick, I added some leftover gorgonzola butter to the crust.  The results was very different from the original, but equally as delicious! This is very versatile and delicious!

This pizza was great! It was so full of flavor -- I'll be making it again. I made one big rectangular pizza on a sheet pan and added some chopped garlic into the mix. Love it!

I made this once and thought it was too bland but immediately thought that crisp bacon on top would be good. So I tried that tonight with more cheese and some garlic sautéed in the bacon fat.  Two thick slices of top quality bacon crumbled is the key to elevate this pizza to a do again meal.

This pizza was pretty good, but a little bland.  Will make again but change the recipes to add a little more flavor.

I made this last night and it turned out great.  I had a hard time getting the squash peeled, so I ended up microwaving it for about 8 mins.  Then let it cool and peeled it.  I also used whole wheat pita bread instead of the dough.  And I used left over seasoned olive oil (the sort used for dipping bread in) instead of plain.  It added a wonderful flavor.  I also added some shredded mozzarella.  This is a great recipe to customize to your own taste.

SOOO good. I sometimes worry when things look to simple that they'll turn out bland but WOW, this was fantastic. We used red onion and it turned out GREAT.  We also added some cooked chicken on top to add some protein. Didnt need it, but it was a nice touch.

This was a very good recipe.  I did follow some of the previous viewers suggestions and added garlic on the crust, balsamic vinegar and asparagus to the roasting vegetables, used feta cheese, and cooked the crust slightly before adding the vegetables.  It was very good, but I should have added more vinegar, and I found that the vegetables did not stick to the crust.  Next time I will cook the crust and vegetables together to see if they adhere better to each other.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tastes good. I felt like it needed some acidity to it, so we poured balsamic vinegar on our plates and dipped it in it. That improved the flavor. I think I used too much squash though because it was a bit overpowering. I will probably make it again if I happen to have all the ingredients on hand.

This was awesome! I needed to cook something vegetarian-friendly for a dinner party and took a gamble on this.  Even the meat-lovers of the group loved the contrast of the sweet squash and the onions.  Will definitely keep this one!

An unexpected surprise! The sweet squash goes great with the pungent parmesan. 
Great recipe!
