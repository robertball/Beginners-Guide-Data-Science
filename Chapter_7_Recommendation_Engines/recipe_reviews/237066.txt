Lela - these rolls are FANTASTIC!  One of my biggest thrills from being on AR is What's for dinner, mom?('s) assistance in helping me overcome my fear of using yeast.  With her guidance, I've made many yeast recipes, including your recipe.  The first time I made them, I forgot the salt.  Not one person noticed and every roll was gobbled up, but I knew something was a tad off.  The second time I remembered it and I noticed instantly the difference in taste.  This is a very simple recipe to follow and super easy to make with my KA mixer. They make wonderful hamburger buns and next time I'm going to try hot dog/brat buns.  Thank you for taking the time to share your grandmother's recipe.  It is a keeper!

Oh ... these are quite good! They are a breeze to make, making them a go to recipe when you want dinner rolls. Followed directions to the "T", and very happy with the flavor and texture. I will be making these again, and quite often as they will also make a good roll for making sandwiches. I would also use this recipe as a good hamburger bun. Thank you Lela for sharing this great recipe. I'm giving them 10 stars. Perfect!

I made these hen it was a personal recipe.  I have made them several times since that first review.  They are wonderful rolls! So glad it was published. My Review: These were wonderful, Lela! I made everything in my KA mixer. I only needed about 3 cups of flour - perhaps a little less than that. The rolls were flaky, rose well and browned nicely. Thanks for sharing your recipe! The rolls were a treat slathered in homemade butter and dipped in gravy.

Yes I converted this to a copy cat of Hawaiian sweet rolls. I used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice instead of water and they were delicious..!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy to do.  I have not done bread by hand since I got the bread machine and was very pleased with how easy to pull together and how great they tasted.  Thank you Lela for this wonderful recipe will be making again.

I give this 10 stars!  Lela - your Grandma made awesome rolls! These were easy to make and baked up so nice and brown, yet are so soft.  I pulled them out of the oven and couldn't even wait until dinner to try one.  I believe I will use this recipe to make hamburger and hot dog buns, as well.  Thank you!

These are so good.  I don't always do very well with yeast and these turned out pretty good even though I over baked them a bit. Thanks Lela!  UPDATE 2014, even better this year, I'm getting used to yeast:)

This were easy to make - I thought they tasted too floury when they first came out of the oven, but my husband said they were better after the next day.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them at the Thanksgiving table so maybe my initial reaction was off-base

This is a great recipe! I made these on a whim one day during the week. They were super easy to make and I already had all of the ingredients on hand. As soon as they came out of the oven my husband and I each ate one while it was still warm. He commented that they taste a lot like the rolls you get from Texas Roadhouse restaurant. We made it with the Honey Cinnamon Butter recipe also from this site. I can't wait to make them again and try them with burgers or pulled pork sandwiches as others have suggested.

I have tried these twice because Step 4 using the wax paper was a disaster. It stuck to the dough and was a mess.  I did use flour but I was left peeling the wax paper out of the dough.  If I wasn't needing these that day, I would have just thrown out the home mess.  The 2nd time I used my pampered chef silicone mat and it came out great.  These are now my go to rolls.

I believe I was the first to make and review these when first posted as a personal recipe and here is my review:  These are really good. I did everything in my stand mixer. I had to use quite a bit more flour, but I am at sea level and it is very, very humid here today. They still turned out so light and fluffy. I made 4 large hamburger buns, 6 medium hamburger buns and 6 dinner rolls. I put the 4 burger buns back in the oven to crisp them up a bit because I will be serving them with a rather wet sauce. The others I kept soft. I do believe this recipe will be my go to for hamburger buns from now on. Thank you, Lela, for sharing your grandmother's excellent recipe.
3/24/2014 I have made these rolls many times since Lela shared the recipe and they come out perfect each time.

Omg! I tried so many online recipes and the bread will become stiff after a few minutes. This recipe is amazing! I enjoy the rolls even more a day after baking. This is now my go to recipe and my family love it. I would give you a big hug if I could. Thank you for sharing.

I make a lot of bread.. I'm a High School Foods teacher, I bake as a hobby and honestly, these are the best rolls I've ever made.  I love my no knead bread recipes for everyday bread... but these rolls were super easy, super fast and super delicious.  They're light and fluffy, golden and buttery.  The only change I'd make is to add a bit more salt, but my foods kids actually made the dough, so I can't be 100% positive they used the correct amount of salt. :)  Delicious, amazing.. I will be using this recipe instead of store bought dinner rolls and burger buns.  wow.

Tried several bread recipes from this site and this one, by far, was among the easiest to make and definitely the best tasting. Mine ended up tasting like yeast rolls, but that is probably just me. Family loved them.

Followed the recipe as written.  These rolls are simple to make and absolutely delicious.  Let them rise to close to the size of rolls that you want before baking.  I rubbed butter on top of the rolls when they came out of the oven. Will be making these again, thank you!

These rolls are exceptionally good! I've made them often; they're always very soft, light and delicious. I've just made a double batch for Thanksgiving and felt I needed to take a minute to say thank you for this recipe.

They turned out a little dense. I’m not very experienced with yeast, so I’m guessing I either proofed them too long the second time or I, my 7 year old daughter, kneaded them too long. I couldn’t tell her to stop. She was having too much fun!

This is my new favorite roll recipe! We love the light, buttery flavor. I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, because the rolls get dry after a day where my regular recipe is good for a few days (but not as good as this straight from the oven). I have played with the milk/butter amounts some of the times I have made it, keeping the total the same, but upping the butter to add more butter flavor. Doesn't make a huge difference.

This is an outstanding recipe which always seems to deliver. Rolls are also good made the day before an event.
I am sure to allow yeast to proof for a long time which makes the rolls fluffy. I add two tsp of salt as opposed to one. These rolls are outstanding. I wish I knew Grandma Rita. I always think of her when I am making these beautiful rolls.

My family LOVES these rolls!!  I have made them 5 times and they have always turned out great!!!  I have also made them into cinnamon rolls that turned out very tasty as well.  This time, I doubled the batch and will be making cinnamon rolls and dinner rolls, and freezing them for later after the first rise.  I will then use the other half for the same now.  My plan is to take them out when needed and use them like premade Rhodes rolls meaning, to let them thaw, rise and cook.

I do believe these are the best rolls I've ever made. Thank you for this great recipe. I didn't change anything. I did make them a little larger than I should have and cooked them a little longer to make sure they baked all the way through.

This is my go to recipe for soft bread that lasts for days. I use it to make sweet breads as well by adding more sugar, some ground cinnamon and vanilla extract. It's my favorite specifically for chocolate filled bread because of how soft it is.

I used a bread machine to make my dough. As with most bread machine recipes, liquid goes on bottom then rest on top. I just added more  flour after initial 2cups was added. I would like mine to be sweeter but this recipe is the best rolls becuz they r  soft, sweet aroma, and texture is perfect. I would add a bit more sweet to it. Any suggestions?

I should have doubled the recipe.  The rolls were gone it 10 minutes.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I will be making it again.  I am considering using butter-flavor Crisco next time.

I made these for Thanksgiving today. When I covered the dough for the initial rise it dawned on me that I forgot to add the egg. I normally don't rate recipes if I change anything but they turned out great and I know from some experience that the egg would have only improved the taste and texture.

I did not make any changes because it was 1st shot making this recipe....did not want to mess it up :) 
It is WONDERFUL bread I have to say! So soft and light when you take it out of the pan! It will be a staple in my recipe box as I make my own bread a few times a week.  Thank you for sharing this great bread!

Haven't yet made these because I have been trying to find out what kind of milk would produce the softest roll. I cannot seem to find out if whole milk, lowfat, or nonfat milk would be the best choice. Hoping to try the today, so I hope someone can suggest something to a first time roll maker.

These rolls easily replaced my regular roll recipe. Not only are they easy to make, but they are delicious. I substituted AP flour because that is all I had. It worked perfectly. The rolls were light, airy, and fluffy. They were the hit of our Easter dinner.

These were amazing!!!! Just the recipe I was looking for!!! I made 6 large hamburger buns and six dinner rolls and we ate the rolls before dinner they were so good! They are the soft rolls you are looking for! And they were soft the next day!  We just popped them in the microwave to warm them the next day!

This is the last new recipe for rolls I will ever try; they're that good. 
I don't use white sugar at all, so I substituted an equal amount of brown sugar and was concerned that it would have a negative effect. No need for worry. They turned out perfectly. 
My husband declared that he could make a meal out of just the rolls. As for me, I'm not a fan of bread products but I loved them too. Can't wait for the kids to get home from school to try them. I imagine I'll need to make another batch of them in short order. Good thing they're quick to pull together!
Would give them more stars if I could!

This one's a keeper! Mixed the dough in my Kitchen Aid with the dough hook and it worked great. I made these into smaller rolls and served them with Awesome Pulled Pork BBQ. Everyone loved them! Thanks Lela, for sharing your Grandma's recipe!

Threw everything into my bread machine and set on dough setting.  Then, made into the rolls.  These raise beautifully.

Very good and easy!  I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead though.  :-)  I like my rolls a tad sweeter.
