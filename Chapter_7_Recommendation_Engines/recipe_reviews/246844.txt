I made it for a mom's coffee at my child's school, and it was completely devoured.  All really enjoyed the dish.  It was simple to make (easier than a pie b/c you skip the saut√©ing of the apples).  Four stars, only b/c I think I'd like to kick up the flavor of the filling with some extra spices next time.

I made this to use up some  apples I had. The only thing i  changed was that I used mostly spelt flour in my crust and I cut back half of  the sugar in the filling  because my apples were not tart ones. Everyone in the family loves it.....Even better than apple pie! This is definitely a keeper!

This is really good!  Easy dessert or breakfast treat.  The crust is soooo good.  I used Granny Smith apples and about 2/3 of the sugar called for.  Will definitely make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I did everything the same except I added lemon juice after I tossed the apples with the sugar.

It turned out great. It tasted good too. Use 2 or 3 apples instead of 5

Great crostata recipe! I used granny smith apples because I love the tartness of them -- coupled with the lemon and sugar...yummmm. Thanks for the recipe!
