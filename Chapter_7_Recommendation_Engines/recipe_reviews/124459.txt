This recipe turned out so good! I made it just a little bit healthier. I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar by half and instead of a whole half cup of butter, I used half fat free plain yogurt. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I did not have chocolate chips or walnuts BUT I did have Hershey's cinnamon chips in my freezer so I used a cup of those. Next time, I'd just cut to the chase and use a teaspoon and a half of the pumpkin pie spice as pumpkin pie spice includes cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger. Seems silly to use the seperate spices. I was able to get 12 regular sized muffins and one "gift" loaf out of this recipe and they turned out so pretty, nevermind tasty! Next time, I'll be sure to add pecans. I think that would be fantastic in this recipe.

Good pumpkin bread!  I used a small sugar pumpkin, baked at 350 for about 70 minutes, then pureed the flesh.  It yielded over 2.5 cups (I fed the extra to my baby- he loved it!) so I doubled the recipe.  I like how this recipe uses butter instead of oil- more flavor that way.  I used half applesauce for the oil and half whole-wheat pastry flour.  I also used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, but sadly, they melted and disappeared into the bread.  I'll try milk chocolate next time.  The glaze puts this over the top- it's delicious with the cream!  It was too thick to drizzle (even though I added an extra TBS cream), so I cut the corner off of a ziplock snack size bag and piped it onto the bread in a "drizzle" design.  It makes a little bit too much icing, so I had to eat the extra.  ;)  Very tasty, impressive-looking bread.

I loved it but my boyfriend wasn't so sure. Easy to make though but TIP: don't bother roasting the pumpkin folks, just microwave it. I'm not normally a fan of the microwave but when it saves you an hour and turns a long recipe into a 5 minute mix together it's worth it.

This is a very moist and tasty bread! Perfect after dinner with some hot spiced tea. The only problems I had were my own fault! I used too much flour on the bottom of the pan, and I accidentally dumped a whole can of pumpkin in the mix instead of measuring out what I needed... oops! Regardless, it came out delicious, just a little squishy in the middle from the extra pumpkin, ha. I can't wait to make my next loaf--and next time I'm going to double the chocolate chips!

This pumpkin bread was delicous! It wasnt long before i made my second loaf, it got eaten up quickly. The bread lasts for about a week and still has the yummy taste. I had to cook it for about an hour and used more chocolate chips instead of using the glaze on top. This bread is good for breakfast and dessert!

This was very easy & DELICIOUS!!  I made muffins and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I also left out the walnuts and used 1/2 Cup Mini Chocolate Chips, for chocolate throughout.  My 3 year old loved the "pumkin nuffins"  Will fix again!

Great simple recipe.  I made cupcakes/muffins out of the batter instead of a bread, and made a cream cheese frosting with cinnamon and ginger added to it.  They turned out amazing!

Tasty.  Didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so made do with the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger.  Added 1/2 tsp salt, omitted the glaze.  Used Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. which stayed whole, as opposed to another rater whose chips melted into the cake.  I prefer muffins, so I made 12 large muffins and baked them for 15 minutes. It sure beats that 50 minutes of baking for the loaf!  Nice little treat in February from the pumpkin I harvested, baked and pureed in November.

I was looking for a recipe to use up 3 small kobucha squashes, and this was a hit.  Kobucha substitutes perfectly for pumpkin. I steamed/seeded/peeled and blended in the food processor.  I substituted 1 cup oatmeal for flour to make them healthier, lowered sugar to 3/4 cup, but used probably 3/4cup choc chips, still sweet. Did not glaze mine  and used cupcake  instead of loaf pan. made 18 regular cupcakes and 12 mini ones.  Delicious!

Best pumpkin bread recipe I've ever made! I didn't make the frosting on top (too sweet for my taste) but it turned out just how I wanted it!

I am a big fan of pumpkin chocolate chip and this came out moist and delicious. I did, however, add more chocolate chips than the recipe calls for, substitute Splenda and nixed the walnuts. Yum Yum Yum!

This recipe is excellent!  I use air bake pans and do have to cook it  a little longer.  Also I have been making a double batch without the nuts and it is a huge hit.  I have already made about 10 loaves this season.  Good stuff!

I used the entire can of pumpkin, and 1/2 a cup of mini chocolate chips.  This turned out fine, but I had a much longer baking time.  I didn't do the glaze, but I wish I would have, as I think it's missing something without it. I'm just not "wowed." Boyfriend told me he prefers pumpkin bars with cream cheese frosting.

I didn't include the pumpkin pie spice because the spices in that were already part of the recipe list. Also I included more c. chips. Unfort. I think the spices overwhelmed the pumpkin flavor. It was also a little dry to cook the inside. I think I will stick to my pumpkin chocolate chip cookie recipe for now.

Oh my!!!  Wonderful!!  I am not an experienced baker but this is an easy quick bread.  I reduced the sugar to about 3/4 a cup since I don't like anything too sweet. I didn't measure the chocolate chips and walnuts either, just kind of used a handful or so of each.  I don't keep all of those spices, so I just used about 1 and 1/2 heaping tsp of pumpkin pie spice and added a bit of salt.  I was surprised with only baking soda and no baking powder in the ingredients, but it worked!  Instead of a single loaf I used my pan of eight mini loaves which worked very well.  I didn't bother with the glaze and I don't regret it, the bread itself is rich and moist.  Even though I am not a big dessert eater this is one of my favorite things I've eaten in a while!  It's great with vanilla ice cream.  I thank you but my waist doesn't LOL.

I really liked this bread. It was dry though, maybe I over-cooked it a bit. Very nice flavor and the chocolate chips were excellent with the pumpkin. I will make definitely make this again and re-rate if the dryness was due to user error. Thanks!

Great bread!  My kids, who have never liked pumpkin, liked this a lot!  It was perfectly moist and delicious.  I left out the cloves.  I will definitely bake it again.

GREAT!!  It's fun and something different...very moist.  My 5-yr old LOVES it (but he likes Pumpkin).  I've had lots of compliments from others!  Thank you for a twist on a traditional bread :)

Perfect, except that I also got a lump of uncooked batter in the middle as another commenter mentioned, even though my cake tester came out clean in the middle.  I think the cook time of 40 minutes is way too short, as similar quick bread recipes I have made usually cook for 60-70 minutes.

Oh yes, also 1/4 cup of chocolate chips is not enough for me.  I increased that to 3/4 cup.

A big hit!  I would have posted a picture, but by the time I got around to taking one... the pumpkin bread was already gone!  Ah well, maybe next time!

Very good.  Nice blend of spices. Family and I gobbled it up! (I prefer using pecans, but that's just me). Also, I'm sure the frosting is an awesome touch, but I didn't feel like buying a carton of cream for just the two tablespoons needed, so that got skipped.

Tasted delicious, but I made it exactly as the directions called for and there was a giant blob of dough in the center. I am fine with my dessert breads being a little gooey, but this was a bit much.

EVERY time I make this bread my husband and I eat it all.  I make smaller loaves so that we can freeze them.  I also always forget the confect. sugar, so I ususally don't put the glaze on the top, but it is still delicious!  Thank you for the recipe

This recipe was easy to make and yummy!We didnt even use the icing and just ate it warm out of the oven, and it was still delicious. It was very moist.
