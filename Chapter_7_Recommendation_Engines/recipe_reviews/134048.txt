I made a diner-type lunch today so I thought a malted would be fun. My oldest helped me make this which both he and I enjoyed. I used an already divided neopolitan ice cream. We really enjoyed this.

This is a very good milkshake. Next time I will add more malt due to personal taste but this is a great shake for anyone who loves neapolitan icecream. Thanks for sharing 3D's Mom!
