This is a yummy recipe! I didn't add the sugar and it was sweet enough for sure. I also upped the cinnamon because we like it.  I made it as directed and it was great. Last night I made it with 2 cups of apples instead of the dried fruit and applesauce. I used 1T of cinnamon too. We loved the apple cinnamon version too. I will use this recipe again and again.

Good flavor. Used honey instead of brown sugar.  We made different versions: we tried cherries, raisins, and goji berries. One note: the finished oats came out stuck to the edge of the pot, so an occasional stir should remedy that problem.  **UPDATE** made it again, this time I coated the pot with butter, used brown sugar, omitted the appleasauce, and cooked it for 6 hours.  After 3 hours, I checked it, and the texture ws PERFECT.  The full cook turned the steel cut oates into a textureless mush.  THis shorter cook maintained the integrity of the oats but remained tender and creamy.

Husband made this recipe. It was our first attempt at overnight oatmeal. Enjoyed it. A couple of things. Use almond milk. Add the applesauce. Hold the sugar. It does become sweet so if you prefer less sweet, purchase unsweetened almond milk. The cherries were delightful.

I just made this last night, and it came out great! I did add unsweetened applesauce, and I'm glad that I did for the added moisture. I was a little worried after reading reviews about it burning cause I only made a half batch, but it was great after seven hours. I did use the almond milk, and I think next time I might use all almond milk to up the protein. The only change I made was to add about 1/2t salt to enhance the sweetness of the added fruit (in my case, dried cranberries).  My husband loves a good, thick oatmeal, and this hit the spot on a cold morning. He commented about how much better it was than the commercial stuff that has so much added sugar and wayyyy too much salt, not to mention the preservatives.  I'll definitely be making this often in the winter. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE, 4/12/17: I've made this every week for probably the last six weeks now, switching out different fruits or mixing them. BIG TIP: once you know how your slow cooker handles the recipe, PUT YOUR SC ON A TIMER!!! Mine really only takes about 6 hours to cook this to perfection, but I'm not setting an alarm to get up at midnight to start this. I can put the recipe together before I go to bed, and wake to perfectly done oatmeal. Also, I make a half batch on Sunday, and can stretch it for the whole week's breakfasts by nuking it with a little milk and adding some dry cereal to it; my hubby likes the added texture, too. LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I made it exactly as the recipe requires except didn't add the applesauce as it was optional.  Put my cooker on low and set it for 8 hours. Checked it at 6 hours and  It had stuck to the sides and actually burned around the edges.  Taste was OK but 8 hours is much too long even on a low heat (or my slow cooker cooks at a much higher degree on low than others).  Would like to try it again but will cook 5-6 hours.  Probably closer to 5 and a half.

I made this for 12 people and it turned out absolutely delicious! I skipped the cherries but use the exact measurements for everything else. Will definitely make this again in the future - GREAT for a big group!

We love this oatmeal. I use the oats, water and a pinch of salt only. In the morning when we are ready to eat it I add a little milk or cream and stir it up. This allows for it to be very creamy. I sit out add ins for my family like sugar, dried fruit, cinnamon, and home made ham. It travels well too!

There is way too much liquid in this recipe. It was a running mess. I ended up adding 1 Â½ cups of quick oats which helped tremendously. The flavor is great. And, the process is a good one. Also, neither my husband or I are crazy about steel oaks. Next time I make it, I'll use old fashion oats and cut the liquid I'll also cut the time it cooks.

So good and not "gummy" like oatmeal can get.  I didn't use applesauce and used dried cranberries and 2% milk (had on hand).  Very easy and will make again.

Made the oatmeal with pumpkin puree instead of applesauce. I doubled the recipe for an event. Huge success! No burning. Served with half-and-half and other dried fruit.

The only change I made was that I only had half the applesauce and I added a handful of walnuts at the end.  A bit soupy, but probably one of the better slow cooker oatmeal breakfasts that I have made.

I followed the recipe as written, omitting only the brown sugar and half a cup of the almond milk.  The applesauce and the cherries made it quite sweet enough for me, and I used unsweetened almond milk.  I followed the recommendations of others and timed it for six hours, and I also greased the pot with butter, and it came out perfect with no sticking or burning.  This was the first time I used my Instant Pot, and now I'm hooked!  I would absolutely make this again.

If you are an oatmeal lover this recipe is for you! I like a firmer oatmeal and so I swapped half the milk (I used lowfat milk) for water. I added cinnamon, vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg and omitted the sugar. Because I have some finicky eaters, I left out the add-ins as well, but certainly there are many fruits and flavors one could put in with the oats. I cooked it on low for 6 hours and it turned out to perfection. I turn in early and was worried about the oatmeal sticking to the crock and overcooking, but I sprayed the inside with cooking spray and even though it was on warm for several hours prior to getting up, it was fine--not crusty and not stuck to the crock. An added bonus is that as it cooks, it fills the house with the aroma of cinnamon. What a cozy, warm wonderful way to start the day! It's a great timer-saver in the morning, too, with nothing to do but get out a bowl and spoon. 5 stars!

I really liked it but will decrease the amount of water next time. I prefer a slightly thicker oatmeal. This was a bit too soupy for me. Used half and half since I did not have almond milk and raisins since my husband does not like cherries.

This is a great recipe, what I like to do so it doesn't stick to the sides is to add one or two tablespoons of coconut oil to the recipe.  I also add toasted nuts and nutmeg.  I am going to try making it in my instant pot and see how it turns out.

I made this once and will make it again, the only changes I made were I used regular applesause and substitured dried cranberrys. This was very good, very easy and I used the leftovers in our morning smoothies.

His has the potential to be good, but mine was a soup this Morning. I questioned the liquid content of this but added 1/2 cup less than the recipe calls for and it was soupy. I'm going to try again with the almond milk only.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very mushy. I couldn't enjoy it at all. perhaps 8 hrs on low is too long. I'll have to continue my search for overnight steel cut oats.

I used the applesauce in addition to the almond milk and water, and it came out a bit like porridge. I would recommend scaling back on the liquid if you are also using applesauce. I found it tasted really good with some candied pecans or maple sugar on top! Like other reviewers suggested, I did not use brown sugar as it already had some sweetness to it. I also had an apple which I chopped and included in the mixture overnight. The cinnamon is also a nice ingredient here!

We've done this 3 times in a row & it's our new favorite.  We make our own applesauce with no sugar and we leave out the brown sugar.  We find it to be sweet enough.  Yum!

I am generally not a fan of oatmeal, but this has changed my mind.  My family asks for it frequently.  I did not use the applesauce or brown sugar, substituted fresh apples for the cherries.  I put out whatever dried or fresh fruit on hand and let everyone add as desired.  Also, I use non dairy milk if my daughter is visiting because she is lactose intolerant.  On the rare chance there is any left over, we add some milk and microwave and itâs just as good as the first time.  I will continue to make this again and again.

This was the perfect thing to have ready on a crazy morning, easy and tasty. I served it with a dollop of vanilla yogurt. Even my not-oatmeal-loving husband praised it!

Perfect minus the sugars. I made this recipe but didn't add the apple sauce, sugar or cherries. It came out perfect for my taste with just the right texture and moisture. I added a little brown sugar and milk to my individual bowl.

I didn't have applesauce so I finely chopped two apples. I used a small slow cooker and it was perfect overnight, 8 hours. Really creamy. I used cashew milk, was out of almond.

This turned out runny in the middle and crusty on the bottom.  I cooked it for 6 hours and did not use the applesauce because I didn't have any.   It tasted good, but was pretty pasty.

I probably did something wrong, but this was a disappointment. Made it for Christmas breakfast with the family and even my parents, who are nuts about oatmeal, werenât too jazzed about it.

I didn't have almond milk so I used cow's milk. It was way over cooked by the morning and a caramel color.  The dried cherries were mush and overwhelmed the flavor.  Will not make it again.I was hoping for a way to avoid the 30 minute cook time in the morning but I will go back to the original recipe.

We made the Crackpot Oat meal. It was way to runny. We will go back to the stove top oatmeal. This was more like baby food. Won't make it again.

We didn't care for the consistency, although the flavour was pretty good. Don't think I'll try it again.

For my first attempt I followed the recipe as written.... eight  hours later I came down to find it burned around the edge of the slow cooker and the middle cooked to a mush.  What was salvageable tasted pretty good but lacked any texture so next time I will put the timer  on for three hours and see how it's coming along.  Eight hours is much too long in my slow-cooker.
