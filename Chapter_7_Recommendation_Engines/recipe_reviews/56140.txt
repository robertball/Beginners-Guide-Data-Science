This is a good recipe although I've tweaked it around to make it just like in our favorite Thai restaurant: add chicken and/or shrimp as well as the ham. I season the chicken with oyster sauce and some cinnamon. We also add cashew nuts and use mixed veggies, not just peas. Our favorite restaurant adds some cherry tomatoes, but we're not whole-tomato-people in our house, so I skip that part, although tomato lovers might find it a good addition. Also, I get pineapple chunks in 100% pineapple juice, and when I drain the pineapple I DO keep the juice. I then mix up about half of it with the soy sauce and add it to the rice. We rather use a bit more soy sauce and less (or no) salt. And finally, a trick I learned from my mom: I don't use the sesame oil to stir fry. For that I use regular vegetable oil or cooking spray made of real oil. But I do sprinkle sesame oil at the end, for better aroma.

So good!  I used jasmine rice and cooked it with coconut milk instead of water.  I also substituted shrimp for the ham and added raisins and cashews.  Yummy.  My husband raved and raved about it- thank you for the recipe!

This was a real hit at our house.  I cooked the rice in the rice cooker.  I omitted the salt as the soy is very salty.  I added yellow and red bell peppers.  Very good.

This was pretty good. I made a few modifications. Chicken instead of ham. Omitted the onions. Twice as much peas and pineapple. Two eggs. And some carrots. A yummy alternative to normal fried rice.

This was very good.  When I boiled the rice I added the pineapple juice and a little soy to the water. Also I use ponzu instead of regular soy sauce,  and some grape tomatoes, chicken, shrimp and the ham.  Make a lot,  you'll love the leftovers later.
Thanks.

Oh so good! I used chicken, regular onions, and frozen mixed vegetables. Totally scored bonus points with the fiance! Thank you for the recipe.

This was very good.  Next time, I will cut back on the amount of soy sauce, skip the sugar, and not drain the pineapple.  I may ruin it, but I think it will give me a smoother flavor.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was delightful! My husband had at least three helpings, and he's not even that crazy about anything even remotely asian or soy-sauce-ish.  My kids ate it too without too much prodding.  I made the "Thai-Style Peanut Sauce with Honey" from this site to serve on the side....awesome.....also served with thai sweet chili sauce.   Fresh cucumber slices and blue cheese dressing on the side.   GOOD MEAL!

This was very good! I'm a huge fried rice fan, but this was the first time I tried making it and I was very pleased.  Made it for a group of friends and they all loved it.  Very easy.

I used half water/half pineapple liquid to cook the rice.  Used brown sugar instead of white, and also added a little bit more pineapple juice when adding the soy.  Omitted the salt, and the egg because I'm not a big fan.  Also just used canola oil then added the sesame oil with the soy for flavor.  Husband really liked this when I made it with grilled honey teriyaki chicken legs, grilled pineapple rings, and a green salad.

I made quite a few changes to this recipe using the suggestions from the reviews and here is what I finally came up with:  I cooked the rice in 1 cup water and 1 cup pineapple juice.  I added shrimp as well as ham. I used 1/2 tsp minced ginger and a few dashes of chinese 5 spice.  Other vegetables that I add are green/red pepper, celery, carrots, zucchini, green beans, beans sprouts, basically whatever I have in the fridge.  I made changes to the cooking method:  I cut the pineapple into smaller chunks and added them to the wok first in order to brown them properly.  Then added the vegetables and lastly, the egg.  I also mixed in a bit of pineapple juice to the soy sauce.  This is the only fried rice recipe I use now.  Thanks so much for sharing.

First of all, I love, love, love fried rice AND pineapple so from the beginning this sounded promising to me.  I made this for my Luau themed 30th birthday party and loved it.  

I did make a few changes.  I omitted the ham because I know everyone doesn't eat pork, I used a diced yellow onion (probably about half) in place of the green onions, I omitted the sugar and used teriyaki sauce in place of the soy sauce.  Also, I omitted the white pepper.  

SO good!  I will definitely make again.

Delicious!  I did use shrimp instead of ham, omitted the green onions (used a generous dash of onion powder) and added some oyster sauce.  I also used leftover white rice from another meal.  Did change the cooking method as per another reviewer's suggestion, cooked pineapple first then added the peas and carrots (had them on hand) with sesame oil.  I added the rice and heated through.  Made a well in the middle and mixed 1 Tbsp oyster sauce with the soy sauce, onion powder, sugar, pepper, garlic powder, salt, a dash of Chinese Five Spice powder and approximately 2 Tbsp pineapple juice.  Mixed thoroughly, pushed to side and cooked shrimp then scrambled the egg.  Very yummy, my mom at 3 plates!  Next time I'll add some broccoli (to make it a more veggie-ful dish) and maybe some toasted sesame seeds.  Can't wait to make it again!

This turned out perfect! I cooked the rice a few hours before I needed it and just let it sit and cool.  So when I got ready to put it all together it only took about 30 minutes.  Really easy!  I didn't have sesame oil so I used regular veg oil and I also didn't add any extra salt.  The soy sauce provided plenty of salty flavor.

What a hit? I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was outstanding. My husband absolutely loved it. It was quick and easy and I wanted something different for dinner. I didn't have green onion so I used red onion. Didn't have ham so I  used shrimp. I had some red and green peppers on hand so I chopped some of them in. I didn't use the salt and used low salt soy sauce.  This is definitely a keeper!!!

Loved it.... like other reviewers, I subbed chicken for the ham and cut out the extra salt altogether, as the soy is awfully salty.  Doubled the eggs,  and kept the juice from the pineapples for a more sweet taste... cant wait to make it again!!

YUM!  I skipped the sesame oil as I find it overpowering.  I added celery, carrots, and mushrooms.  And for the "sauce" I did soy sauce plus hoisin, and garlic and ginger pastes.  I forgot to add the peas and missed them dearly.

Tasted just like the stuff we get @ the restaurant! Used shrimp instead of ham, onions instead of scallions, and added 2 Tbsp oyster sauce and ommitted the salt.
Absolutely delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum! We all really liked this! I made the rice the day before - used brown basmati like I always do. I used mixed vegetables instead of peas (DH hates them). And as one reviewer recommended, I reserved the liquid from the pineapple to mix in the rice and didn't add sugar - that gave it a little more pineapple flavor too.  It's really good, DH especially loved this :)

This is pretty dang good! I made the rice ahead of time. I also used tofu and chicken instead of ham. I also added a bit of fish sauce and oyster sauce. I will make this again and continue to tweak the ingredients to my personal taste.

This was very delicious.  Next time I will cut back on the salt a bit, but it was really good as is.  I can't wait to make it again (and I rarely make anything twice).

I loosely followed the recipe, when it came to measurements. I used shredded chicken instead of ham, since it's what I had. Overall, decent... but lacked SoMeThInG. I kept wanting to add something but wasn't sure what... guess that means I'll just search for a different recipe! It certainly worked fine for a really quick late-evening dinner.

* Curry (added to the rice/pineapple when it's almost done cooking)
* Shallots
* Soy sauce to taste

This is soooo good. I love the tangy sweetness of the pineapple with the saltiness of the ham. This is a main dish for sure because you'll find yourself putting a pile of it on your plate and devouring it. Pretty good for you too.

Just starting to learn how to stir fry and so am making simple dishes and this is definitely one of them. 
No peas cuz I forgot to buy them, but will be making it again and again and again . . .  The flavor combination is so tasty! Our soy sauce is Braggs Liquid Aminos which only enhanced the taste of it all.

This was delicious, didnt have sesame oil so I used olive oil and used a regular onion. I used a maple flavored ham steak because thats what I had on hand and it gave it even more flavor. I'll be making this again

Not bad, but I've had better.  The rice is less mushy if it's allowed to cool for about 30 minutes at room temperature instead of being stuck in the fridge.

This was a good side dish and 99% of my family enjoyed eating it.  The other 1% are fussy eaters that need everything on their plate seperated.  Will make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Very good fried rice.  First time I made it, I added the salt as called for in the recipe, but I found with the salt from the ham, it was too much, so second time I made it, I did not add, and I found that it was perfect.

When I first saw the recipe and mentioned it to my hubby, neither one of us could imagine it tasting all that good.  BUT I decided to try it anyway, and WOW! were we ever pleasantly surprised!  We'd both give it 10 stars if we could.  The only thing I'll change next time is the amount of soy sauce -- I prefer none; hubby likes it the way it is, so I'll halve the amount as a compromise.  He can always add more to it when he puts it on his plate.

My family loved it. I substituted 3 cups raw minute rice and 3 cups water. I might add some additional spices next time and twice the amount of pineapple. (I have to admit that I didn't measure most of the ingredients!)

I didn't have the exact ingredients such as soy, green onions, and white pepper.  I instead used teriyaki, dried chives, and a litttle black pepper.  It was still very good so I am looking forward to making this dish correctly. Thanks!

I just made this for supper. It is hard to find recipes that use ham. This is the best one that I have tried. I didn't have green onions, so I used dried minced onion and chives. I used 2 eggs and honey instead of sugar and didn't add salt.

I rate this 5 stars because it actually does taste good and it's easy to understand. And let's face it, were are all on this site because we aren't gourmet chefs! The great thing about fried rice is you can vary it so many ways and to your liking. Sesame oil is a flavoring oil, so I suggest using it only at the end to mix in, not to cook with (use any cooking oil instead). You can mix in any type of meat and veggies; frozen mixed veggie are my choice and takes so much less time than fresh. But make sure you drain well and cut everything to the same bite sizes. It's very distracting to eat fried rice with big chunks along the way. Depending on your purpose - ie a side dish of mainly rice or as a main dish - alter how much of your proportions. I personally like fried rice as a main dish, and steamed white rice as a side. So think visually how much of the various ingredients - equal part dairy (egg), rice, meat, and vegatable. In fact, the rice should only be enough to "bind together" the other ingredients to get a good balanced meal. Same as if you had a side of rice, side of veggies, and meat. For meals, I use 1 egg per person. Make sure the rice is "firm" so you don't have soft mashy rice - the point is that the rice should be individual little pieces even when stir fried. For more egg taste, scramble them up by itself. For blended egg taste, put beaten egg in with the rice. You can even skip pre-adding seasonings; put them on the table for everyone as condiments.

Loved this!  I read through all the reviews first, but only made a couple very minor changes to the original recipe.  I doubled the recipe because I knew my husband would want leftovers for lunch the next day.  I cooked the rice in half water/half pineapple juice.  I used some leftover holiday ham.  I added 3 eggs, instead of the 2 that would have been double; mixed the soy sauce, remaining pineapple juice and seasonings with the rice before adding it all to the wok; left out the salt; and threw in a handful of slivered almonds.  I was skeptical about the ham in this, but the flavors blend beautifully.  I'll probably try it with chicken also.

This recipe is a great base to make 5 star variations with! I did the following:

Doubled the recipe (except for the pineapple and soy sauce), 
Cooked the rice in the pineapple juice, 
Added 1/4 cp cilantro, 
Added 2 Tbsp oyster sauce, 
Did not add egg or sugar, 

Even without doubling the pineapple it still had a very strong flavor, so I'm glad I did the variation I did! Adding the cilantro and oyster sauce really makes it pop as well. I'm already thinking of ways to vary it the next few times I make it! Thanks for posting!

this was a very good starting point for us.. used the meat from 3 chicken drumsticks in place of the ham.. used fresh pinapple.. added 1/2 cup of chopped baby carrots.. omitted the salt, sugar, pepper, and egg.. used light soy sauce and i can only imagine how salty the original recipe would have been.. used veggie oil to fry everything and then seasoned to taste with the sesame oil like others suggested.. ty for the recipe

I tried this the other night, omitting the egg, ham and sugar.  I also used brown rice, which I cooked in half water and half pineapple juice.  It was ok, it needed something more.  Egg, ham and sugar, perhaps? It is worth trying again, correctly.

I had never heard of Pineapple Fried Rice until my pregnant daughter told me she was craving it.  So I looked it up and offered to make them some.  They were thrilled. I used a fresh pineapple.  She is a vegetarian so I left out the ham and substituted edemame beans for the peas so we got some good protein in there. I also doubled the eggs. I  added some red peppers for colour.  My husband and I were delighted with her craving because we got to try something new that we loved too!

Came out delicious.
Changed the recipe by using some brown rice, crushed pineapple (that's what I had), and fried a green pepper with the onions in olive oil. Left out the ham and peas and used less onions. It probably came out very different but this was a great recipe. I would use pineapple chunks next time and see how it comes out.
I would make it again.

Just finished making this ... 2nd time.  My grandson who is 16 requested it.  I make a few changes... I use chicken, fresh garlic and ginger , no salt.  I use pineapple juice instead of sugar and mixed veggies. I didn't measure the soy sauce .. I just sprinkled it on and stirred until the rice was coated.  The first time I cooled the rice but this time I didn't and it didn't seem to make a difference.    The recipe still deserves a 5 star rating because the basic recipe is a good starter for anyone and then you can tweak it to your own preferences. BTW.. my granddaughter stopped after work and ate some and is now requesting I make a double batch next time.  Did I mention she took some home for her lunch tomorrow?

made it as written/we liked this one a lot better than a another one we tried on this site. My tweak was to add some chopped nuts....cashews or macademias.

I cooked my rice in coconut milk (Careful! You will burn your pan!) to make it a little sweet- it was great.  I added crushed red pepper flakes  because I thought it may come out too sweet- it was perfect!  I also made double rice so there would be plenty of leftovers.  SO good!

I think this recipe is a little too sweet, next time, no sugar and I will be dosing it with some chili garlic sauce too! Thanks for this recipe, it will be in my rotation.

Just so happened that I had both ham leftovers and very very ripe pineapple that I didn't really want to eat just like that. I liked the taste of the cooked pineapple in this, to make it sweet and salty. Played around with the veggies though, green onions, no peas as I didn't have any, carrots, white onions, cauliflower, broccoli and peppers (we're big on adding lots of veggies!). It was a quick and easy meal, but would not go out of my way to make it again. Boyfriend thought it was a little too tasteless, would need more seasoning, though I don't know what exactly. Maybe pineapple juice. And definitely would add more eggs, that was a nice touch.

This recipe is one of my absolute favorites, currently my favorite dinner one! I cannot say enough positives about it. The ingredients are things I mostly have on hand, and the ham itself isn't costly; plus, it's very fast to throw together. I must have known it would be a hit, as I doubled the recipe the first time I tried it! (And every time since then.) The only thing I added differently was some chopped vidalia onion, and I didn't use quite as much soy sauce the 2nd time around. You can always add more to taste if desired. Thanks for an amazing recipe.

I made this dish for dinner last night and we LOVED it. I had trouble finding sesame oil and finally I found toasted sesame oil in the salad dressing isle of the super market, and that totally gave the dish its flavor. It was so good, my 30 year-old son made a copy of the recipe for himself!

Tasty. I used peanut oil, adding the sesame oil at the end, with half the sugar and pepper. If I make it again, I will make a few changes: Fresh minced garlic, and no pepper. I'll probably use chicken, too. It seemed to cover that nice hammy taste a little too much for me.

I used hickory smoked SPAM instead of ham. I cubed it and smoked it on my smoker. Now, don't laugh if you have never had smoked SPAM. Smoked SPAM is a whole nother thing, it's good. And it made this great.

This was a terrific base.  I used chicken instead of hame (since that's what I had), and frozen peas and carrots.  I also used fresh pineapple, as the local Asian market had them on sale for $1.00 each.  Delicious!

Yum!  I had ham I needed to use and I had already made several other things and was out of ideas.  Thank goodness I stumbled upon this recipe.  I omitted the egg b/c I was out of them, and added carrots, fresh garlic, and some broccoli.  It was so good!  Thanks for the recipe.

I agree with the other poster about maybe not adding the additional salt. My rice came out a lot darker than the photo, and I thought I'd need to add more, but it tasted fine the way it was.  I also added a little bit of garlic and chopped white onion. Also, I would recommend holding off on adding the peas until the very end, as mine weren't as bright green as they could have been.   VERY good though! Will make again!

Made using wok.  Not good with shrimp.  Soy sauce turns rice ugly brown.  No brightness on the flavor spectrum.  No textural interest.  A miss for my taste buds.

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  I made a few changes to suit or palate.  I made the rice with pineapple juice instead of water.  We love pineapple.  Did not have ham and added bacon.  I added some chicken and shrimp.   Did not have soy sauce,  would not lie I panicked.  Found a Soy Sauce recipe here and it was delicious.  Never buying it again.   This is a keeper in our household.

This is a really good base to play with. I used chicken instead of ham. Next time, I'll coat chicken in corn starch and fully cook before adding the greens. Also way too salty as is. I added more rice to recover. I'll probably skip salt til the end next time, adding as needed. I also want to try it without eggs for my daughter who's allergic.

I was a little hesitant to make this recipe, but it was very tasty. I adjusted it to 8 servings. I only used 1 and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Also, since I usually cook with  Bragg Aminos natural soy sauce alternative instead of regular soy sauce, I only used 1/3 of a cup of Braggs because it is saltier. I also cooked it with fresh pinapple instead of canned.  The end product was very good! My kids loved it and they wanted seconds ;  ). 
This is a recipe that I am definitely going to make it again.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but it was so salty it was inedible. If I ever made this again, I would leave out the salt and half the soy sauce. I would also add in some other veggies.

I changed this quite a bit, but I followed the recipe as far as rice and seasonings go, and it was SO salty. I used low sodium soy sauce too. I used jasmin rice, broccoli instead of peas, chicken sausage instead of ham,  fresh pineapple instead of canned, and fresh garlic instead of powder. It had a good flavor overall, but definitely omit the extra salt and maybe cut down the soy sauce.

This recipe is a great start for other rice/ham dishes, but also a hit just as it is here. 
I found it a little bland so I added kernel corn as well as a garlic based multi-purpose spice. I wish I had broccoli and/or cauliflower on hand. 
Thank you for a recipe that should be on everyone's radar.

Have made several times... great as-is, but I mix it up and throw in extras that I have on hand, such as red peppers or fresh pineapple.  Tonight I used left over pork roast in place of the ham.  Also, the full amount of white pepper made it too spicy for my 12yo, so I only use about half.

loved it so much that I still rated it 5 stars even though I found it too salty.  Next time I'll cut salt in half and soy sauce in half.  Yes I used the low sodium soy sauce.  Wonderful!

This is a great start to a delicious fried rice!  You can make this with or without the ham/pineapple and add shrimp, chicken, pork or whatever protein you prefer.  I cut the soy sauce in half and add replace with "yum yum" sauce.

Yum!  I cut a fresh pineapple instead of using canned, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Easy and delicious.

We LOVE this.  I double the recipe so that I have leftovers.  I don't add the salt; I think the soy is enough.

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious! I added red cabbage, orange bell pepper, snap peas, red wine, teriyaki sauce, and
extra soy sauce that gave it an pea nutty flavor. 

I think this will be one of my favorite recipes in the future the taste was so good

Pretty good and easy to make. Way too salty though. I will omit the salt next time. I think the soy sauce has plenty enough salt for this recipe. Added a little chopped red bell pepper for some crunch.

This is a great recipe. I did make some changes though. I left out the ham (I'm vegetarian) and added broccoli and carrots. I added a 1/4 cup of pineapple juice to the soy sauce. Used half the amount of salt. I left out the sugar and used maple syrup. I also cooked everything in coconut oil. Very tasty. Even my 3 year old ate it.

This was delicious!  Left out the green onions because I didn't have any but otherwise made as directed.  So good!  I'll be making this again for sure.

This is easy to make and delicious. I used crushed pineapple because that is what I had in the pantry. For those of you with picky eaters, the crushed works great because you don't even know it is there. It is perfect as is but I think it could easily accommodate changes to add what veggies you have on hand. Thanks for sharing this.

The Hub and I both loved this recipe.  We had it last night and the two of us made absolute pigs of ourselves.  I served it with Oven Roasted Teriyaki Chicken from AR.  Great combination.  I altered it slightly because I only wanted it as a side for the chicken so left out the ham (did add a little bacon, though) and added more pineapple tidbits (I pre fer those to chunks)   Also had to use chopped yellow onions because I had no green onions. Thank you lilfoodcritic.  It's a great recipe!  Darn, almost forgot, I added all the pineapple juice to the water before cooking the rice as suggested by one of the other AR members and it was really good.  I think it added a lot as I liked it even without any other additions.

Made this tonight for dinner, we loved it! The only changes I made was I used a regular yellow onion because I didn't have green onion, used brown sugar instead of white sugar, just personal preference, and because I only had a little sesame oil I just drizzled it on the rice at the end and mixed it in. Super delicious recipe, will definitely make again!

This was AWESOME! I did as a couple others and didn't use the 1 tsp salt as the soy is salty enough.  I also did half soy half pineapple juice instead of straight soy and added more veggies than just peas (peppers, celery, etc).  I used only the one egg and did shrimp instead of ham!  SO GOOD, will definitely make this again!!! There were NO leftovers! YUM :D

This is a great recipe. I use reduced sodium soy sauce and omit the salt at the end.  I always use a rice cooker. You can play around with the protein- sometimes I use ham, sometimes chicken and shrimp. Next time, I think I'll try using tofu. Hubby requests this all the time.

I think cooking the rice before hand would help a lot, it turned out a bit mushy, and didn't have enough flavor- i hear adding oyster sauce helps increase flavor-

We didn't care for it. Had a "smoky" flavor to it. I used jasmine rice. Consistency was good, but I won't make it again.

This was excellent.  I had some leftover pork loin and a can of pineapple to use up.  When I found this recipe it was a great way to whip up a quick meal from what I had on hand. I highly recommend it!

Good Fried Rice. I liked the combo of ham and pineapple together. I used a cup and a half of instant white rice, pineappke and ham. I didn't add the sugar, but it could probably use it, I thought it was a little salty. Great way to use up ham and pineapple. Thanks

Excellent.  Too much pepper though.  I will cut it in half next time.  I added julienned carrots for extra veggies. Will make again.
