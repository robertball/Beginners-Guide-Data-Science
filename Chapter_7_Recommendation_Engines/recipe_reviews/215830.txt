Wow! This dish came out way better than I could have imagined.  The paste forms a nice crust on the salmon making it have a cajun feel to it.  The spiciness is nicely offset by the sweetness of the caramelized onions.  It's also super simple to make. I did double the cayenne because I like spicy and omitted the onion powder (didn't have any.) I also used a whole onion which was the right choice.  One note - if the salmon is thick then use a lower heat because the paste will burn the top while the inside remains raw.

Ahoney squeeze of honey to the marinade to give it some more sweetness. Also keep the onion in strips when they are minced you can't even taste them.

Hubby actually liked this! It was too spicy for our 3 year old though. I baked my salmon in the oven, and used sliced onions rather than minced. It's great served with wild rice pilaf and broccoli.

The spice rub is fantastic!  I rubbed my salmon with it and let the fish sit in the fridge for a few hours and then baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Outstanding, even the next day as leftovers.

We made this recipe last night and paired it with a smoked gouda risotto.  We poked some holes in the salmon with a fork to allow the marinade to soak in better.  We cooked the fillets on the flesh side down first and then flipped them on the skin side, so that the marinade could form a crust and seal in moisture and also because we thought we could then cook them on the skin side a little longer if necessary.  We diced the onion instead of mincing it and used half an onion.  The onion was delicious and next time we will use a whole one.  This was very flavorful, sweet and savory, and not too spicy (but we LOVE spicy foods).  Next time, we'll add more cayenne to better suit our tastes.  Overall, this was a fantastic recipe!

Soo good! The only complaint is we weren't expecting it to be soo spicy. But we just drizzled a bit of maple syrup over it, and it was heavenly. My guests gave it a 5 out of 5. Thank you! We served it with butternut squash, rice pilaf and a baby green salad with apples and grapes in it. Delish! Will make this again and again!

Love this recipe, it came out fantastic. My family kept saying how good it was. Its easy and so delicious. The only thing different was I added one whole onion for the topping. My new favorite salmon recipe!

Although I like spicy food, this was a bit too spicy for me and my hubby.  This is the secod time I'm making this recipe and only used 1/4 amount of the cayenne pepper.  Other than being too spicy for me, it is absolutely delicious.  It's definately a keeper.  Thank you Romeo ! ! !

Delicious recipe!  I made a couple of small changes based on other reviews.  Like other reviewers, I baked the salmon instead of cooking it on the stove (about 22 minutes at 400 degrees). I also used a whole onion, sliced instead of minced, with a dash of balsamic vinegar.  The dish was flavorful and spicy, although not too spicy for my taste.  I will absolutely make this again.

I've made this dish twice...... once baking in the oven, and once pan frying. I prefer baking it COVERED, so that the salmon stays moist. I also used 1 medium onion, sliced, for the caramelized onions (cuz you just can't have enough of those!)

My husband, who's picky, picky, PICKY asked that this recipe be put in permanent rotation, and that it tastes like restaurant food. Can't get better than that!

I served with mashed white/sweet potatoes and steamed baby spinach. SO YUMMY!

Seriously, the best salmon recipe out there. I had to tone down the heat a lot, so my young ones would eat it. But, they LOVED it with the following changes...I only used a dash of the cayenne pepper and most of the paprika and pepper, but doubled the brown sugar. Served with green beans and jasmine rice. This is a definite rotation dinner. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is very good and quite spicy for people who aren't used to eating spicy foods. The second time I made this recipe, I omitted the onions and cooked the salmon in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, and also added some maple syrup in the bottom of the pan. I do find the rub a bit too thick (perhaps it makes too much for 2 salmon fillets?). I just removed most of the rub when I ate it and it was still quite tasty.

Delicious flavor and I didn't even have time to carmelize the onions, just used the marinade and baked it in a foil pouch for 20 mins at 350, then broiled low for another 10 minutes.  We'll be making this again!!!

Sugar in the "paste" made fish start to blacken so I added some water to pan.  Served resulting "sauce" on fish.  Used half a sliced onion per serving.  Used regular paprika then added 1/2 t Hungarian paprika as well. Served with wilted  spinach.

This is our absolute favorite recipe.  I only put a smidge of cayenne pepper in because the 1/4 tsp was way to much.  I also coat the fish with the mixture a couple hours prior to cooking and put it back in the fridge.  When I'm ready it goes in a 400 degree oven for 20-30 minutes!!!  So Yummy  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was great. I made it exactly according to recipe, but doubled the paste so I'd have enough for our larger pieces of fish. Delicious! My 'crust' didn't stay on during cooking, but the flavor was deep in the fish so that was ok.  Will make again!

Wow, this is simply incredible! This was the first time I ever made salmon and I followed this recipe exactly. I LOVE hot and spicy food and let me tell you that this certainly had a kick so be warned! Noses will be running for sure with this dish! My boyfriend said this was the best salmon he has ever eaten and I have to agree! I can't wait to make this again! It's for sure going to be a repeated recipe in my house! Thanks for sharing!

Very good! Fairly easy, too! This is just what I was looking for. We bought some salmon that didn't have very good flavor. If you're in a similar situation or cooking for someone who's not crazy about fish, this is your answer! I followed the recipe exactly, except that I halved the cayenne (we're wimps) and used a whole sweet onion. I also cooked the onion nice and slow while salmon marinated and let it caramelize well. I then transferred them out of the pan and cooked the salmon in the already hot and oiled onion skillet. This saved on dishes. Thank you, Romeo, for sharing this yummy recipe!

Yummy, my husband and 5 year old loved this! I am not to keen on pan frying the salmon, but it was very tasty and full of flavor. The salmon was a little dry, I may have over cooked it though. I will definitely try this again.

We will definitely be making this salmon again! I baked it (@ 400 for 15min) instead of skillet frying it, and it still turned out amazing! As one reviewer suggested, I doubled the cayenne - it was HOT, just how my husband likes it!

My husband said, "You know I don't like fish..." He loved it!  I forgot the minced garlic in the rub(but put it in the onions), didn't have paprika, so subbed a dash of brisket rub, and used coarse pepper.  It was delicious.  If you like pepper or extra crunch, go with the coarse ground.  I seared the salmon on the stove, then finished it in the new wave because the edges started to burn while the middle was raw.  Otherwise, great!

This was phenomenal! We moved out to another country and only have minimal ingredients to work with, so I was looking for a new simple salmon recipe. This one is a score! I don't think we'll be going back to the old recipes we were using any time soon. I cut down the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and it still had a nice little kick to it. We both agreed that every bite down to the last was bursting with flavor. This recipe lets you appreciate every bite. Kudos to the creator!

This is by far our favorite salmon recipe to date.  We do gravitate to spicy dishes but it truly works so well to balance out the salmon.  This is so easy to prepare and so delicious I make it nearly every week!

Loved the sweetness of the brown sugar offset by the kick of the pepper.

This was very flavorful!  My husband(who doesn't eat salmon) really liked it also.  I didn't have onion powder so I left it out.  I also just broiled the salmon in the oven.  I cut the onion in rings instead of dicing them and browned in butter instead of olive oil and added salt to them. Great recipe with just the right amount of spice.

We love salmon and spicy....why not combine the two. The sounds pretty good, I'll give it a try but I'll be sure to cook up a seperate filet for my 5 year old:)

This was a quick and tasty way to prepare salmon.  Followed the marinade/sauce recipe exactly, and did find it a bit mustardy -but we like mustard so it wasn't off-putting, but next time I might reduce it just a bit.  Also followed suggestions and baked fish at 400 for 15-20 minutes and made thin slices of onion instead of minced to caramelize.  The onions were delicious on top of the fish.  Would make again.

Super easy and super delicious salmon recipe. My family isn't big on hot spicy food so I just omitted the cayenne pepper and it still had a little kick to it. Will make again for sure.

This is delicious. Made it for a small dinner party for 4 and it got rave reviews. I tend to not measure (plus my boyfriend's kitchen is poor stocked with measuring spoons) so I probably added much more cayenne then called for, but I like it spicy. We realized we didn't have onions, so they got nixed, unfortunately, they were great the first time around I made it. Also ran out of Dijon so I threw in some honey dijon too, and instead of brown sugar I used agave. Also ran out of onion powder so I used garlic powder. I baked this time around cause I had too much else going on the stove top, for about 15 minutes at 450 instead of pan fry.

Great & Easy. This was the best salmon I ever made and my boyfriend loved it.  I put in the oven 400 degrees for 20 minutes covered and it turned out moist and flavorful

Great marinade recipe, I put it on fish and let sit all day. The only change I'll make next time is a little spice on onions while they caramelize and I'll wrap fish and bake in oven.

This is the best salmon I've ever had!!!! I can't wait to make it again!  I omitted the cayenne and only put in 1 tsp black pepper because my son doesn't like things too spicy.  The salmon still had plenty of kick and flavor to it.  The onions were a nice addition, but not necessary to make some flavorful fish.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!!!

Great Spicy Flavor!!  I sauted the onions and garlic then tossed the remaining ingredients in the pan with a little extra EVOO to loosen to spreading consistency.  Then put the salmon on a baking dish, spread the onion mixture over the fish then baked @ 400 to our desired doneness.

This recipe was delicious!!  Made mostly as is but quadrupled the recipe and added a few teaspoons of honey to the paste mixture and some garlic to the caramelized onions.  I DO NOT LIKE SALMON and I could eat this any day!

this was good! i would definitely make it again . this time i didn't have the cayenne, so it wasn't spicy. I'll be sure to get some before making it again.

served it with spicy mango chutney and that added the missing heat :) they were yummy together!

I don't usually review.... but wow - I loved this recipe.  Very, very tasty!  

I did bake it with the paste over the top because I prefer keeping the skin on.  If you like a spicy dish, you have got to try this!

I'm a very novice cook but was able to whip this up as a main easily.  Paired with a colorful vegetable fried rice and white wine.  The salmon was fun and easy to prepare and the spice soaked in so nicely.  Easy dish to make any time - most of these ingredients area always in the cupboard.

We were very impressed with the flavour of this salmon. The crust provided the perfect balance of sweet, savoury, spicy goodness. After I had applied the paste to the salmon fillets and put them in the fridge, something came up that meant we would have to eat the salmon the next day. Fortunately, the salmon turned out just fine even though it marinaded for 24 hours. When I cooked the salmon, I completely forgot about the caramelized onions, so we didn't have those. However, I plan to make those next time I make this because there will definitely be a next time for this one. I served the salmon on a bed of couscous salad.

The rub was amazing! I had three fillets and it was still plenty, we also grilled ours on the gas grill, the rub stays on very well when grilling. I caramelized a whole onion in my cast iron and topped all three fillets with the onions (we love caramelized onions). This was some of the best salmon we've had, we will make this one again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit with everyone! I made it exactly as directed except I tripled everything for my large family. I also made it with talapia and salmon since my daughter doesn't like salmon. I had a complete healthy meal on the table in no time flat! The coating on the fish turned out perfectly crunchy and it had that wonderful savory/sweet thing going on that I love! I served it with fresh sautéed spinach and corn on the cob. Mmmmm!

My first attempt at pan frying the salmon charred the entire dish. Decided to bake it (covered) for 20 mins at 200 degrees celsius and the salmon turned out perfect! The salmon was moist and flavorful!

It was so good! I used a little less Dijon mustard (as I am not a Dijon mustard fan) and it came out perfect! My fiancee only ate grilled salmon and after trying this recipe, he wants to eat this salmon every week!

We kicked up the spice level on this a little and really enjoyed it.  It was great on salmon BLTs the next morning too.

If you can find Edmond Fallot Provencal Dijon Mustard, that is FANTASTIC in this recipe.  The first time I made this recipe I really liked it, but we loved it when we used the Provencal Dijon.

I really enjoyed the combination of sweet and spicy in this dish.  I used it on Haddock because that was what I had available, sliced a whole yellow onion instead of dicing it, used smoked paprika in the paste and marinated the fish for over an hour.  I served this with a steamed corn, asparagus and carrot medley.  It was great.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe.  I am going to try it on ribs this weekend.

A spicy salmon dish which has a lot of flavor and is quite easy to prepare. 

I made a half batch of sauce for the 2 filets and there was plenty. Also I skipped the 30 minute marinade step and there was still plenty of flavor. This would probably be beyond amazing if I actually followed the recipe to the letter.

I had to cook the salmon for WAY longer than suggested for it to be cooked through.  I covered it for the last 10 minutes of so.  it was FABULOUS though!  Me and my boyfriend's new favorite thing!  I served it with a NearEast box of Parmesan cous-cous that I mixed a diced tomato  and shredded Parmesan into. 

I will be making this a lot!

Absolutely delicious! The longer you let it marinate the better it is. Fast, easy, and inexpensive.

OMG...! I didn't even do it right and it still turned out fabulous!!! I ran out of onions so I used some frozen grilled balsamic onions from TJ's and the sweet and spicy flavors were wonderful! I loved it and so did my guests!!!

This was fantastic! It was so good that I'm actually writing my first allrecipes review even though I've been using this site for years!  I cook a lot of salmon since we don't eat meat, and am always trying new recipes.  This is the most flavorful and tastiest! Next time I make this I'll skip carmelizing the onions-the marinade is perfect on it's own and I honestly didn't taste the onions.  I had to fry mine for longer than 8 minutes to get the fish cooked through, but if anything it made the marinade better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe.  As you said great for the picky eater.  My husband loved it.  I had to substitute a few things like the brown sugar....I used cinnamon sugar.  And for the black pepper I used lemon pepper.  It really turned out great!  Thanks.

So good!   Changed slightly by caramelizing 1/2 large chopped onion then added 3 cups fresh baby spinach;  cooked on low till spinach was wilted;  served spinach/onion on the side with Farro.  Best of all though was the salmon itself!  As above ... so good!!!

Great Salmon recipe, I followed the recipe but seared the top first for 2 minutes then the skin, then baked in fan forced oven at 180 for approx 10 minutes, checking every 3. I read other comments & agree should thinly slice a whole onion, also to caralamise the onion I added a tablespoon of Red wine vinegar, it also adds sweetness. This worked really well & i will be making this again, thanks.

I tried this recipe but I lessened the ground black pepper to our taste.  It tasted great. My husband loved it and he said that was one of the best meal he had.  I was happy he enjoyed his meal and I am glad I found this recipe here.

I made this in the oven which I think is a mistake because it doesn't rub off some of the marinade.  The marinade was way too potent and too spicy.  I also think I lathered the topping too thick, be careful it's potent!!

I made this twice.  Both times I thought it was just OK.  Maybe I need to marinade it longer or put on more spices.

I've used this recipe several times with freshly caught Striped Bass and it's absolutely wonderful. It's one of my most favorite recipes for Striper and it always leaves me wanting more.

Thank you Romeo!

FYI... adjust the Cayenne to taste. 1/4 tsp makes it pretty spicy.

This was excellent. Yes, it is spicy. I cut back the black pepper to 3/4t and only added 1/2T of olive oil to the paste. I used an entire onion and 1T of olive oil for the caramelized topping. Even hubby, who hates salmon, ate the whole thing and said that if I were going to make him eat salmon again, to use this recipe. I'll take that :). Thanks for sharing, Romeo! I will definitely make this again.

This was fantastic!  I am not usually a salmon fan but my husband is.  I'll admit I didn't have fresh garlic or onion powder but I used garlic powder and garlic salt to make up for what I was missing.  This was so good, I have already shared the recipe with friends.  Thank you!

I loved this. Super easy.  I like spicy so after reading reviews I doubled the cayenne pepper to one teaspoon but it was really really hot. I will not double that next time!  
The only other thing I changed was to sauté the onion in butter rather than olive oil.  It gave it a added kick of sweet. I used 1 tbl spoon of butter and half a sweet onion.  Delish.
I  put my broiler on low and cooked the salmon skin side down.  It took about 8 mins and the skin stuck to the tin foil that covered the pan and it was easy to slide fish off the skin and serve... and also no clean up.  I just threw the tin foil away. 
I will def make this again!!

Absolutely delicious! Easy to prepare. We actually cooked salmon on grill.  Three minutes  just on one side and it was perfect! Also added a TBS of brown sugar to carrots which helped them carameliza  and also offset the spiciness very nicely.

Instead of pan frying I baked it at 400F uncovered for 15 minutes, covered (with tin foil) for 7 minutes and broiled on high for 3 minutes. I also used 12 oz of salmon with skin on it and instead of dijon mustard I used stoneground mustard. It was VERY tasty! Will definitely make it again.

Real good.  The salmon topping is wonderful.  I wanted to cut back on the calories from oil so I baked the salmon in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes.    I thought the 1 1/2 tablespoons of minced onion was not enough for an ingredient that receives top billing in the title, so I diced about 1/3 c. onions.  I will make this again.

Would make again with half as much cayenne and half as much black pepper.... a very good and easy dish.
 if you love heat this is good as is, but i think just a touch on the hot side. But I am anxious to try again with half the pepper.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn’t measure everything exactly but it tastes great. Next time I’ll add some mushrooms but I can say 100 percent that I will be making this again. I like my food spicy so I added extra cayenne pepper. This dish definitely made me ??

My favorite salmon recipe! I recently made this for a holiday gathering I was having at the house. I didn’t have brown sugar, so I used a a combination of maple syrup and honey and it tasted delicious! But you can’t go wrong with using brown sugar either!

It was extremely delicious. I myself don't even like fish or spicy foods very much, but this was a dish packed with flavor. I added some lime juice in order to take off some of the fishy taste, but otherwise stuck to the recipe!

followed the recipe for the most part only sauteing additional onions and added zucchini. The marinade was extremely tasty and not to spicy.  Hubby loved the change. This is a keeper.

We're all but snowed in tonight, a little light on some ingredients, and too far from a grocery store, but we have a cupboard of some canned goods. I had to make TONS of changes and substitutions, but the resulting meal was still DELICIOUS!

Substitutions/Changes:
Canned salmon instead of salmon,
1/4th tsp lemon pepper instead of Dijon mustard,
molasses instead of brown sugar,
margarine instead of oil -- I had to add 2 Tbs more to keep things from burning,
two small onions sliced into rings instead of the minced onion and onion powder,
1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of minced garlic cloves,
reduced 1 1/2 tsp of black pepper to 1 tsp.

Still delicious even with all those changes! Next time, I'll make it with even less black pepper; it was almost too spicy for the version of this recipe I made. Excellent dinner for having almost nothing on hand.

Best salmon recipe I've tried thus far. I didn't have onion powder, so substituted with ground cumin instead. Added honey to the onions.  Upped the cayenne amount. LOVED it!  I'll definitely be making this again.... and again... and again!

Fantastic! Used a whole onion because my fiance loves 'em, and I cooked the salmon in the oven as others recommended. I kept it covered for about 15 minutes, then uncovered the last 7 or so. It came out delicious and perfectly juicy! We loved the amount of spice paired with the sweetness. Not too spicy at all. :)

This recipe tastes delicious, even if you half the amount of sugar as I did. Not sure if anyone else's burned on the spice rubbed side, but the flavor was still fantastic.

This is very awesome. We bought a bag of frozen salmon and I had forgotten it came in pre-seasoned bags. We made this with the plans of putting it on the salmon but didn't need to (the pre-seasoned salmon was awesome!). So we used this spice mix for some boneless pork chops the next day. OMG, they were awesome. This mix can be used on anything (salmon, chicken, pork chops). Will be using this a lot. It is on the spicy side but wasn't bad. We love spicy food and it was the perfect amount of heat. May be too hot for kids.

Quick and dirty and delicious.  I'm not big on spicy, so i reduced  the pepper and cayenne pepper.  And instead of sauteing the onions in oil I use butter.  This was a quick favorite in my house.

I was worried about how my family would like this with all the pepper and mustard, but when all was said and done everyone loved it. I decreased the pepper a bit and didn't have the Dijon mustard so substituted stone ground mustard and cooked it in a cast iron skillet. Just a right amount of spicy and I think it would have been even better if we let it marinate longer.

I've made this several times and it's now one of my favorite salmon recipes. Probably because it's quick and easy.   However, I cannot eat it with the recommended amounts of pepper.  It's just too much for my sensitive taste.  The most my taste buds will allow is to cut the black pepper in half and omit the cayenne.  It's still plenty spicy, but the sweet caramelized onions counter the spice.

this is a weekly dish in our kitchen. i add one tablespoon of honey. i make the paste and marinate the fish for a hour or so. its delicious. my husband asks for it all the time. just watch the salmon when you put it on the pan, no more than 3 to 4 minutes or the sugar and honey in the paste will burn...did that a few times...lol

This recipe is amazing!!  It was very easy to make, and it tasted delicious.  I will be making this again and again.  I actually marinated the salmon in the fridge for about 4 hours instead of the 30 minutes.
