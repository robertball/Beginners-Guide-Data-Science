Quick question. Do you pre cook the rice?  Is it 2 cups precooked, or 2 cups uncooked?

I made this for my family. I couldnt find mirepoix so i just  chopped up onions, celery and carrots. I mixed it all up in the crockpot and had my son turn on low at 9 am. I came home at 6pm added the rice (uncooked) left it alone about 30 min and at last 15 added the shrimp. My family raved.

I followed the instructions, exactly, and it was really good.  Next time I cook this, once the rice goes in, I need to walk away and not mess with it until it's done... I was stirring it too much and made the rice mushy, but it still tasted good!

So the base of this recipe is really good, however adding the rice into the crockpot turned it into a glutenous mush. I followed the directions but the rice got really mushy. Next time I will just make the base in the crockpot and make the rice separately.

I made this exactly as the recipe other than I cooked my rice separate and spooned the mixture over rice. It was absolutely delicious. Definitely will make this again!

I’m giving this recipe one star. It was simple to make but tasted terrible! I’m from Louisiana and maybe as a result, I’m used to jambalaya with more flavor. It tasted fishy from the shrimp and that flavor overpowered the rest.

Made exactly as described and was perfect for the entire family. Very easy to make and was a huge hit. Not to spicy for the little ones and easy to add hot sauce or old bay to taste!

This was great! I will defiantly be making this again as my boyfriend and I are like pigs haha! Only thing I would change is the amount of oregano. There was just a little bit too much for my taste.

Easiest jambalaya I've made yet. Followed the recipe very closely and it turned out great. Made a ton, I'll have leftovers for weeks

Great recipe!  Spicy, but not too spicy.  I was worried it was going to dry out, but it was perfect!

The only things I changed were adding extra cajun seasoning, cracked black pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also added more chicken instead of shrimp as my family does not like shrimp. Turned out delicious! Great recipe!

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make!  My husband and I both loved it, and I will make this again many times.  I shared it with my son and daughter-in-law and they enjoyed it too!

I made this, adhering to the written recipe.  While it was cooking, it tasted almost TOO flavorful.  I worried it would be too spicy, "flavorful" and grainy to my husband (who I was making this for).  I kept on and added the rice, then the shrimp (according to the recipe timeline).  After I tasted the final result it was SO bland!  I wanted to pitch the whole crockpot's worth, but, thought I'd let my husband try it.  He, also, found it very bland and not to his liking.  He (despite my protestations) has a friend he wants to give the rest of it to.  I told him to NOT put my name on it.   I wouldn't recommend this recipe.
