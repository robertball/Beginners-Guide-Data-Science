The nutritional breakdown on its own is enough for most of us to try this one.  I used frozen mango, so I did reduce the ice a little, and since I like smoothies a little on the thick side, reduced the water as well.  I must admit that I've developed a taste for smoothies with a little Greek yogurt, so as a personal taste preference, I will add about 1/3 cup vanilla Greek yogurt next time.  However, this is simply pure sweet fruitiness from a combination of perfectly-ripe summer fruit, and it gives you a real pop of vibrant flavor.  Very nice.

Instead of water an ice cubes I used frozen cherries and mangos and some unsweetened almond milk and unsweetened flaxseed milk with just enough water to get the consistency I wanted.
Yummy!

I only had frozen fruit. No ice and added water until the right consistency. If I had fresh, ripe mangoes this would be even better.

I found this recipe to be very thick and I had to add more liquid just to blend it. With that said, I used coconut water with aloe vera instead of water and added nearly 2 cups and my smoothie was still on the thick side. I also added the juice from half of a lime and sprinkles unsweetened coconut on top.

Nice, simple, fruity drink.  Very refreshing on a warm day.  I had some very ripe mango, and since I used frozen cherries (I always have those on hand), I omitted the ice.  I also added a dash of vanilla and after tasting, I added a squeeze of fresh lime.  I used less water...maybe half a cup or so.  Perfection, but since I like to play around with my food, I'll probably also add a slice of fresh ginger the next time...and there'll be a next time.  :)  This is perfect for frozen mangoes and cherries, too, and I keep my freezer stocked with those.  A new summer fave!

Really good!  I got tired of pitting cherries so I had more mangoes than cherries.
