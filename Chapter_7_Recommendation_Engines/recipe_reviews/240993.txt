Simple and delicious! I was worried that it was gonna be garlic overkill w/ the amount of powder used, but it created a nice crust and was perfect. For the few ingredients used, this was very flavorful. I did use evoo instead of butter to keep it on the healthier side. I will def be using this recipe again, as the whole family loved it~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Extremely simple and my family loved it too.  I would recommend pounding the chicken flat in order to get uniform thickness for cook time.

I really enjoyed this chicken. I pounded it flat before putting it in the pan so that it would cook more evenly. I did cut back on the amount of garlic powder and only used 1 Tbsp. I used a mini fine mesh strainer to evenly sprinkle it over the chicken breasts and it was plenty. The lemon flavor was a great touch. I served this with a rice-orzo pilaf and roasted Brussels sprouts for a fantastic meal.

This is a very 'basic' recipe to start out with, but it needs a lot more herbs in it, in order to make it tasty.  Chop up and add in   some fresh Parsley, Thyme, Rosemary and Sage.

Very simple to get together, but, really tasty!  Don't be hesitant to use the full amount of garlic powder in the recipe.  I was afraid it would be overpowering, but, it turned out just perfect.   I highly recommend you pound the chicken out to even thickness about 3/4"- 1" thick.  It will cook more evenly and quicker while remaining moist and juicy.

I've been making this all week for my dinner!  So good!  And easy too!  It has perfect flavor (not too overpowering), with a moist tender inside and a crisp garlic crust.

Wow!  So simple and easy!  I did add some fresh garlic and basil in the lemon juice. Paprika And rosemary I added to the chicken. I served it with buttered egg noodles.  My whole family loved it!!

This has minimal ingredients, but offers a plethora of flavor profiles, especially when the recipe only requires a few ingredients!  I loved the flavor which was very tender and I will definitively keep this in my "go to" easy chicken meals.

Can you say yummy! I used clarified butter, chicken thighs and added red bell peppers to the pan, otherwise followed recipe. Really, really good. Quick and easy to boot! Who can ask for more. My brother, who is a chef, said it's a great recipe. Served with broccoli and put the lemon-butter sauce from the chicken over the broccoli. OMG good.

Very Simple, very tasty!  has a very Dinner at grandmas taste.  Only change I made was to use Chicken thighs In place of the chicken breasts, because that is what I had on hand.  It was simply wonderful!  will be using this again.  Thank you for sharing!!

If you want something quick to fix for dinner that tastes good, then here's your pick!  Easy, quick, and tasty!  I didn't follow the measurements because it's just one of those recipes that calls for eyeing your own requirements.  I did use all the ingredients, and my hubby kept saying how good it was.  That counts!  Thanks, Violet Kenow!

I made this exactly as written.  Adding the lemon juice on top of the chicken makes chicken breasts tough.  It was dry.

I love this combination on chicken and shrimp, kinda like scampi.  Not too much garlic for me, but I love garlic on about everything.  Garlic powder is great in a hurry but fresh garlic is great if you have time.  Fast and simple.

I was cooking this recipe just for myself, so I cooked only 1 chicken breast. When I changed the serving size, I saw that I was supposed to sprinkle 2 tsp garlic powder on my one piece of chicken! I just couldn't do it. I did use a little more than 1 teaspoon, though. This was a very flavorful recipe. I loved the lemon flavor.

This was very good.  Used a lot of butter, a lot of garlic powder and lemon juice to taste.

This tasted great!  I love garlic and 2 tablespoons was not too much.  Reminded me of chicken spiedini.  The only problem I had was that I am not very good at cooking/frying in a pan.  I just do not have that touch to made meat perfectly crispy.

Great dish, I have been making this for years and it's in our rotation at least twice a month for our family.  I ad orange and lime juice (2 parts orange 1 part lemon 1 part lime) and like to spoon any extra juice from the skillet over the chicken before serving.

Very flavorful. I made this just for my husband and I and I used a whole lemon. It was just the right amount of tang. I also used a little more butter along the way when the chicken was cooking. Will definitely make again!

This was a super easy recipe and great if you're in a hurry. I found it waay too garlicy and one of those recipes you have to modify to suit your tastes. I used olive oil instead of butter. Not sure if this is what caused the garlic powder to become soggy. I may try this again but with modified ingredients and baked in the oven.

Holy Chicken! This came out so good. The flavors cooked into the chicken so well and it was very tender. The family loved it! It's super simple but really good. I came here looking for something quick, easy and tasty and it was all of that. I made this with fried rice on the side. Definitely going to make this again. If anyone is looking for more flavor or want to add extra it's pretty flexible. I did follow the recipe exactly though and loved it.

It came out very dry. The amount of garlic powder is surprisingly okay - the first time I made it I didn't trust the recipe and put too little and it was not enough. I chose to marinade the chicken in lemon juice instead of pouring it over, and I delayed adding the butter because the butter burns easily.

I'm not a huge fan of pepper, and this was too much pepper for me, but my boyfriend thought it was just the right amount.  Vary depending on your personal pepper preferences.  I was also concerned that this recipes used way too much garlic powder, but I went with it, and it was great.  Very tasty, very flavorful, and very easy to make.  High marks.

This was simple and easy to make. I followed the recipe pretty much to the tee but free handed the seasoning measurements. Still came out delicious. Served it with rosemary and olive oil quinoa.

This was tasty and I liked that it was ready to eat in under 30 minutes. Quick dinners are a plus in this household. I cut my thick chicken breasts in half horizontally and then in thirds because they were VERY large breasts. I also only used enough garlic powder to give them a good coating, not the full amount called for. Served with a nice garden salad and dinner was done in a flash.

This was just okay for us. With the other 5 star ratings I was expecting more. We made the recipe exactly as written. If we try it again we will make it on the grill. It just seemed like it was missing something. The family said they would eat it again if I made it but they didn't care for it enough to put it into the menu rotation.

Easy, quick, and full of flavor. I used 2 large boneless skinless breasts, and cut them in half to make sure they cooked through without drying out. I don't think I used the full amount of seasonings, but just seasoned generously during cooking. Everyone enjoyed this simple, easy, and delicious chicken!

This is so simple and yet delivers so much flavor.  I didn't measure the garlic or lemon juice and it still came out well.  I so seldom cook chicken on the stove top that this was a lovely treat.  Thank you. Violet,

Pretty good. Well liked by my big brother. I melted the butter and heaped all the ingredients in until well cooked. I was tired so I tend not to measure much. I thought the lemons have this a nice zing. But 2 lemons is too much, even for 6 servings.
  I'll remember this one again because it was so easy.

This was such a simple recipe, and it was ready in under 30 minutes. The garlic powder and gave the chicken such a nice crust. I cooked in a stainless pan to help with the sear. I think that helped a lot.

We only used half a lemon and it was still just a touch too lemony. We made this twice and it was yummy both times. Gives the chicken a well rounded flavor that makes me want to eat more.

Because my husband is fighting kidney stone issues, I had to make some changes. The lemon is perfect for him; salt and pepper are not. I used herbs de Provence along with a seasoned salt (because salt and pepper are minimal in it) for seasoning. Also, used EVOO instead of butter. I also sliced the breasts (instead of pounding) to make them thinner. A reminder to all who do that: your timing may go much quicker! Be sure to use a thermometer or probe! I also used roasted garlic. ALL my spices are Penzeys. Served over bow tie noodles (farfalle). We loved every tiny scrap of this. Oh, I didn't have fresh lemon, but I had bottled lemon juice, which was fine.

Instead of pan frying, I mixed all ingredients together and grilled the chicken basting with the mix. Wonderful. My son’s new favorite.

The lemon and the garlic were not overpowering, and it created a very pleasant eating experience. Does it have a ton of kick? No, but the recipe is simple enough to be modified/enhanced to suit one’s taste, depending on what you want. I served it with pasta that I made in a butter and herb sauce and it was a great meal.

My toddler gobbled it up and my hubby and I were big fans too!  I followed other users' advice and pounded the chicken flat--much easier to cook evenly and no issues with it drying out or getting tough (my daughter won't touch chicken that is even slightly on the dry end). I added a sprinkle of onion powder on both sides along with the fresh cracked pepper and salt (I used pink himalayan salt so that it wasn't too salty). Also, added a sprinkle of dried basil along with the garlic powder and poured the lemon juice into the pan (instead of on top).  Everything was perfect! Definitely a keeper

Only one change: I feel like this should call for 3 chicken breasts halved, rather than 3 chicken breast halves.

I made this last night and listened to many others and eased up on the garlic. Next time I make it (and there WILL be a next time) I will add more garlic. I served this in a salad and it was wonderful. This will most definitely be added to our summer fare. Thank you, Violet!!

This is a great, easy recipe for new cooks. Be generous with the garlic powder for a more pronounced taste. This recipe pairs well with a seasoned vegetable.

Sauteed garlic in the butter then sprinkled garlic powder and fresh garlic on each side while cooking.  Didn't have fresh lemon so used lemon juice, cooked a bit longer but came out moist and tasty.

Easy and fast dinner!  Made it  as stated in recipe except I did  pound the chicken first to even out the cooking.  Husband loved it and it is now a new favorite!  The butter is the secret to this great dish!  Thanks  so much!

I am absolutely amazed at how simple AND delicious this is. I used a mixture of olive oil and butter to  "fry" the chicken in. I also got it sizzling before I put the chicken in. Use all the garlic powder! I also used a bit of salt, pepper, and garlic salt (very light sprinkle)

How easy was this!!!!! For a change I did NOT alter the recipe at all!!! I usually use Lawry's Season Salt, but did not this time, just the ingredients that Violet listed. I did it in my 10 inch cast iron skillet. I had one huge breast, so I pounded it even and cut it in half and adjusted the recipe for 2. It was so good. and the lemon juice really added a nice touch. I will be making this many times over. Thanks Violet.

This recipe is quick and easy to make with amazing results.  I was impressed with how the garlic powder made a nice crust without overpowering the other flavors and the fresh lemon juice really gave everything a nice bright flavor. I served it with a side of quinoa and steamed carrots and those seemed to pair up well.

I'd love to say more but it's a simple and effective recipe that works great  when you need to bang out a quick dinner with minimal prep and quick clean up.

Will definitely make again.

This food was just ok for us. I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews, for which I'm sorry. Next time, I will take some of their advice and use chicken thighs and fresh garlic, and add herbs such as oregano & thyme. It works well for my special diet, though, so I will try it again.

I pounded the chicken flat to get a uniform thickness - taking a suggestion from other reviewers. Then, I cooked it according to the recipe. I found the chicken fairly dry/tough but the flavor was ok. I probably won't make this again.

It was actually very good.  I cut the spices down by about 25%, and it was very salty and spicy.   It has the potential to be very good and is quite easy, but the spices were a little much.  Next time I will make it,and half the spices.

Delicious.  I used 2 cloves of garlic rather than garlic salt and added some of the lemon rind to add a sharper lemon flavour

I used the recipe as a base. Instead of chicken broth, I used two parts beef broth to water, added an onion and used minced garlic. I also used an entire stick of butter for three breasts without thinking, but it made it so much better. Rosemary could improve it further. Super yummy!

My family LOVES this dish and I love how simple it is.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs so they weren't dried out like some of the other reviews mentioned. I didn't change anything else about this recipe and it was awesome!

I coated the chicken in egg first than dipped in garlic salt, parmesan, and lemon pepper.  I threw in a diced tomato and onion in the pan with some oil.  I cut the breasts long ways because they were too thick at first.  then sauteed on low for 10 min on each side.  It turned out juicy and delicious with lots of flavor.  I also added minced garlic cloves and topped with lemon juice as it cooked as well.

Made as directed and came out very good. Had with rice and used leftovers for salads. Will make again. Thanks to OP and other reviewers:)

Lemon Garlic Chicken Haiku: "Well, color me shocked! Didn't think it'd be so good. What's with all the 'flips?'" I reduced the recipe for a couple chicken tenderloins that I was eating solo for lunch, and like other reviews b4 me, was skeptical of using THAT much garlic powder, but I followed the recipe as written and was very happy w/ the light, lemony, buttery, garlic results! A perfectly simple chicken that's nice on its own, but tasted better over salad greens. What I don't understand is why the recipe calls to flip the chicken so frequently, as I've always thought that only two flips per piece of protein is necessary for retaining the perfect amount of flavorful, crusty exterior? Either way, I did what the recipe's directions said to do, and was delighted enough w/ the chicken's taste that I'll put this in the keeper file!

Great taste and something that comes together easily. Love lemon-garlic anything and this one is a keeper! I know I used more garlic than in the recipe-adjust to taste.

A simple recipe that is simply delicious.  I cut the chicken breast into medallions, pounded them to a uniform thickness and then brined them for one hour. This allowed a shorter cooking time.  These were perfect served alongside a salad for a light dinner.
