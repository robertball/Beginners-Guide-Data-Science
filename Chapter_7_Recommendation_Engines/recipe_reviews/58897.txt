I started with fresh spinach and used low fat buttermilk, and ground cumin, fresh peppers.  Loved it!  Great combination of flavors.  I think I'd use even more peanuts or chop a few up to make it nuttier.

The flavor of the soup was excellent.  I think next time I might puree all of the spinach to make it easier to eat.  Also, I didn't quite understand what to do with the peppers.  I cut them in half as suggested. But was I supposed to scrap them into the pot and then remove them after heating the soup?

This recipe is not for everyone, but I thought it was fantastic! I chopped up 3 jalapenos instead of just halving serranos, because I wanted lots of spice and something to chew on besides the peanuts.

This recipe was very quick, simple and satisfying!  I had to substitute a few things because I didn't have everything on hand: 2tsp flour for the cornstarch, cumin powder and jalapeno peppers.  I imagine it would be even better with all the correct ingredients.

I made this to use up some buttermilk and I was not a fan.  My mom said it's 2 stars, but my husband and I give it 1.

Maybe I was less of a buttermilk fan than I thought...because I probably will not make this soup again.

Didnt even eat it. Did not care for how it looked and turned out. I was hopeful this was a good way to use up buttermilk. I was wrong. No stars is not an option.

I liked it. I had 3cups of drying spinach in the frig and wanted to use it. I stuffed it into my Ninja processor with 1.5 cups of buttermilk and chopped it fine. Next, in the Ninja, a cup of no fat milk and three tablespoons of natural peanut butter, then added it to the saucepan with the spinach buttermilk. I didn't have cumin seeds, so I used powdered, also, I didn't have serrano peppers, so substituted one teaspoon of powdered Mexican arbol peppers. I tried cooking the powdered cumin and peppers in olive oil, but in hindsight, would have just added them to the saucepan with one tablespoon of olive oil. I mixed the corn starch with the water then added that with the sugar to the saucepan. I stirred constantly to boiling, expecting the cornstarch to make the soup somewhat thicker. It was a little hotter than my wife could stand, so again, in hindsight, I would bump the pepper down to half a teaspoon.

This is an interesting combination of flavors.  I chose it to use up some buttermilk, but I don't think I'll be making it again.  My husband wouldn't eat it.  I added some chicken broth to mellow out the strong flavor of the buttermilk.  If you don't really like the flavor of buttermilk, do not make this recipe.
