WOW!  I made this pie for Father's Day brunch and it was a huge success.  When preparing the pie, I tasted the filling prior to putting it into the pie crust and was weary that it may not have enough lemon flavor.  However after it chilled overnight, it had just the right amount of tartness.  My mother-in-law begged for the recipe and I'm almost ashamed to give it to her as it was embarassingly easy, but FABULOUS!  Thanks for sharing, I will definitely be making this one regularly.

An awesome summer pie! Excellent with BBQ or potluck if you want a light, lemony dessert.  I like to make my own graham cracker crust (buy the ready to use Keebler Graham cracker crumbs) since it tastes so much better - sweeter, crunchier and homemade tasting.  I think the ready made crusts always taste stale and they crumble and fall apart when you cut into them. Like others, I added about 5-6 drops of yellow food coloring, added 1.5 teaspoon lemon extract and increased lemon juice to 2/3 cups (use quality bottled lemon juice).  Sweet and tangy, similar to a lemon chiffon pie and will take you a whole 15 min. from start to finish. TIP- Freeze this, especially if you add more lemon juice.  Trust me, it won't be 'frozen', but will taste like a silky key lime pie coming out of the freezer.  The fridge isn't cold enough to firm this up.  I also make this in a 9 in. springform pan which makes serving and cutting very easy.

This is my new favorite dessert!  It's so easy, and fabulous.  I thought it wasn't quite lemon enough the 1st time, so the 2nd time I made it I used 2/3 cup lemon juice, and it came out a little softer, but zingier, which I like.  I also put a few drops of yellow food coloring, to make it the perfect lemon-yellow color.  It's my new standby though, it's so easy and delicious!

Just make the custard with 2 egg yolks and sweetened condensed milk, than add lemon juice, it might be more interesting. Frozen whipping cream can be add for the topping or fold either way is ok.

Pretty good for a pie, and really good for a no-hassle 5-minute pie.  The cool whip doesn't even really have to be thawed.  I'm going to try lime juice next time instead of lemon.

A great addition to my Easter Dinner.  This pie was so easy to put together!  I upped the lemon juice to 1/2 a cup, added the zest from one grated lemon and used real whipping cream, and a small amount of yellow food coloring.  For those of us that love lemon, this was a big hit.  Thanks.

This is so yummy and easy to make.  How would it not get five stars?!  You could just as easily pass this off as lemon cloud mousse to your family if you didn't want to wait for it to firm up...just throw it in cute bowls instead!  If you CAN wait, it's really good once it's been in the freezer all day.  It doesn't actually freeze solid and so it is quite easy to slice.

Excellent and SO easy to make!  I ended up making 2 pies with the ingredients.  I put mine in the freezer and served them like that.  Very tasty.  If you want it to "look" lemoney, just add some yellow food coloring to the ingredients to give it a pretty yellow flavor.

It's 4 stars for taste but I'm giving it 5 because of how easy it was to make.  I would make this again based on the ease/taste.  I would try 1/2c lemon juice plus lemon zest from 1-2 lemons next time and maybe even throw the pie in the freezer.  Mine was a bit soft, possibly because I used a bit more lemon juice and only refrigerated it.

I had planned on making a lemon pie,and a lime pie with 2 crusts,and just one can of milk,and one tub of topping. I thought I'd have two shallow pies,but I found that the one recipe made two full-to-the rim pies! I had tons of lemons,and limes,and I went zest and juice crazy! About 4 each(lemon & lime). The lemon filling was "burn your throat"sour!so I had to use about 1/2 cup of Hersheys Strawberry Syrup to swirl into the pre-frozen pie. That made it like a strawberry lemonaid flavor! Really good! The lime pie was perfect as was done! They kept well in the freezer,and sliced wonderfully! My husband acted like it was poison when I told him what I had made,but asked for a piece every night til they were gone! :) thank u! Will make often! And will only use listed amount of juice in the future! ;)

This pie TOTALLY ROCKS ! Especially for people like me who are lactose intolerant. It tastes super creamy, is light and very tasty. 
I read all reviews before making it. I only added one tablespoon of lemon zest, which I really think made the difference. I also made it the night before serving and placed in the freezer before serving. I firmed up perfectly, and the guest loved eating it chilled. It did not freeze up like ice cream, it was just right. I bet even Goldilocks would have approved. So if you want a super simple pie to make, that's creamy and lemony, look no further, cause this pie is the bomb!

If I could I would give this recipe 10*'s.  My mom used to make this for me when I was a little girl.  She sometimes substituted  lime juice for the lemon and some times she would add a bit of lime juice to the lemon juice.  This recipe brings back so many memories...now I plan to use this recipe to build memories with my own son's and friends at church.

great, fool-proof pie. Made it for my Mom when she came to visit, & we all enjoyed it! Used real lemons, added lemon zest & yellow food coloring. I will make it again with real whipping cream (read 'The Omnivores Dilemma' for my reasoning :)

Love this pie! Two were brought to a dinner party and everyone loved it, but only one was eaten. Froze it for a week for pending company and it thawed perfectly and still tasted great! Our local grocery store just had limes on sale for 5 cents each so I went crazy. Want to try a lime version in a pretzel crust. Love the idea of putting in springform pan. Will update when I do that.

Simple recipe with good results.  My husbands comment was "kind of lemony I bet it would be good with vanilla"....I think lemony is the point!  He ate two pieces.  Looks like I'll be playing with the recipe next week.  Kids ate it and asked for more.  I will be putting this in my summer rotation for no bake desserts.

I first made the filling based on the original Brandi(the poster's) recipe. But, I like lemony things, so I followed MommyfromSeattle's suggestions. I added part RealLemon juice & part fresh squeezed lemon juice, lemon zest and one teaspoon of lemon extract(more made it too lemony for our tastes) & a little yellow food coloring. The pie had a great, light and summery taste. Will make again soon. Thanks Brandi for such a quick and delish dessert.

This was easy and exactly what I was looking for. I made this pie for my boyfriend's birthday (he isn't a big cake fan) and it turned out fantastic. I followed the recipe to the letter, ignoring other suggestions to add more lemon juice, and it turned out fine. I used highly concentrated lemon juice, which may have made a difference, and I added a little yellow food coloring.I am definitely going to make this one again.

I made a graham crust from scratch and froze the pie after I finished making it. The family really enjoyed it--GREAT quick dessert.

Delicious and loved by the lemon lovers.  I added the zest of the lemons to boost the rich lemon flavor.

I find this pie so addicting I made it two weekends in a row.  My slight variations are: regular deep dish pie crust, added lemon zest to the mix, and used a doubled recipe of Easy Whipped Cream recipe (found on Allrecipes.com) which includes sour cream for a smooth, creamy filling.  I did not top the pie off with whipped cream like the picture. Tasty, refreshing, light.  If you like lemon flavor you will love this pie.  Very easy and quick to make.

Yummy! Really light and easy to make. I added a tad more lemon juice and let it set over night and it was a big hit. Tastes a lot like key lime pie, but not as tart. Thanks.

Before I made this, I read the reviews and made a few changes(that's why I gave the recipe only 4 stars). I increased the lemon juice to 2/3 of a cup, added 1 1/2 tsp. lemon extract, added a few drops of yellow food coloring, sometimes make the crust from scratch in a 9" springform pan, and sometimes top the pie with a layer of whipped topping and a sprinkling of the leftover crust mixture. It's always well liked by the family. I have made this many times and will continue to do so!! Thanks for posting and for the helpful reviews:)

Great recipe, one variation is just add a can of crushed pineapple (drained) and fold (do not beat) together, Pour into graham cracker crust. Put in freezer.  I find with the pineapple this makes two pies.

Very good and this recipe was quick and easy to make, but the next time I make it I will try one of the other suggestions, adding some more lemon juice and food coloring, I like more lemon look, thanks for the recipe.

My family, friends and co-workers all love this pie! Even on Thankgiving, this is what I am asked to make. For some extra zing and color, I top my pie with fresh lemon zest. For sweetness and added texture, I add crushed graham cracker just before serving.

I thought it needed more lemon flavor, but I like  a combination of very tart and sweet.  I will make it again and use more lemon zest, and juice with a bit more sweetener added.

Simple to make and very tasty. When you buy pie crusts, make sure you get the extra large ones if the width isn't on the product label. I bought an 8" crust by mistake and had extra topping left over. I crushed some graham crackers and coated the bottom of a couple of glasses to a depth of about 1/4, then put the topping in the glass atop the graham cracker, covered with plastic and refrigerated with the rest of the pie. The pie in the glass was great; I might do it again and layer raspberries, strawberries or blueberries in as well!

The family loved this! Honestly, I wasn't thrilled with the taste of the mixture prior to chilling, but afterwards it was perfect. I chilled the pie in the freezer overnight and tried a piece the next morning (no way I was going to be able to make it till dinner...), and then kept it in the refrigerator until serving it at dinner. I found that I preferred the consistency of the pie straight out of the freezer as opposed to the fridge. Gave it more substance.

Great recipe!  I do recommend (as another reviewer did) adding a package of lemon pudding to the condensed milk mixture to add to the lemon flavor!  It really does make a HUGE difference as some lemons can lack in flavor depending on the season.

I also made a BANANA version of this by mixing the sweetened condensed milk, whipped topping and banana pudding.  I sliced bananas and layered and it came out perfect and so delish!  May even like this version better than the lemon!  

I would highly recommend this recipe as a quick and EASY alternative to a lemon (or banana pie) perfect for a pot luck!

This pie is simple and not expensive to make. I have made it over and over again for 20 years now and have never had one fail. I will be making one this coming weekend for my dad because it is one of his favorite pies.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! We also call this "Lemon Icebox Pie". I have done variations with lime juice, or sliced fruit topping, or even use the Oreo pie crust, uber yummy!!

So refreshing! Great easy summer recipe. I had never made a pie before so this is perfect for beginners. I folded the whipped topping into the lemon mixture. It was great! A keeper!

Delicious and embarrassingly easy to make, even going with homemade graham crust and real whipped cream for the top.  Will definitely be making this again and again.
I made this again with lime juice.  Also good.  It took more that 1/2 cup juice but I don't think my limes were that great.

I was skeptical of this one. It sounded too easy, and looked kind of weird, but I must say: it tasted lemony and fantastic! Thanks so much for the easy, yummy recipe!

Awesome QUICK & EASY recipe ! I took suggestions and added 2/3 cup to one pie and made the other as the directions called for. I preferred more lemon taste and my husband preferred the less lemon taste. So make it on how tart you like things. Either way, it took me 5 minutes to make 2 pies and they were GREAT ! Thanks !!

I followed the original recipe and found I would like this pie to be a little more tart.  I plan on trying it next time with fresh lemon juice and making it a couple of days before I plan to serve it, the flavor seemed so much better after a couple of days.  It is so simple and quick to prepare. I did add lemon zest over the top of my pie befor adding the whipped cream.

I'm not much of a fan of lemon pie, so it was no surprise that I didn't think this recipe was that great, but my mother loves lemon pie and wasn't that impressed either.  It was good but it tasted too lemony tart for us.  If I make this again, I would use only 1/4 cup of lemon juice and I think some lemon zest and yellow food coloring will help a lot.

This was my first attempt at making any type of lemon pie.  I made this recipe and the "Sour Cream Lemon Pie" also from this site as 2 of my desserts for Thanksgiving dinner.  I wanted to compare the tastes between a quick, condensed milk-based recipe to one where you actually cook up a custard. My diners overwhelmingly preferred this one, which is great, since it's so easy!  I actually preferred the other recipe, which is why I can only give 4 stars.  But I'll definitely make this one again, since it is so incredibly quick and easy, and most people seemed to really love it.

Great and easy.  Will make again. Added lemon rind to the lemon juice for extra zing; it worked!  We made the crust too, and prebaked it; the pie held up for a few days in the fridge without getting soggy (some of the kids aren't lemon fans and I paced myself).

This recipe was very easy, but I just didn't care for the taste.
