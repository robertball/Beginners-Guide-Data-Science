Kids loved it. I think it tasted better with no mustard or Ketchup, cause it didn't go well with the cheese.  I had 2 dogs one with condaments one without.

It is somewhat different; but good. I placed the cheese in the wrap 1st per instructions & then used salsa versus mustard & ketchup. Worked for my family! These will go into our dinner rotation.
