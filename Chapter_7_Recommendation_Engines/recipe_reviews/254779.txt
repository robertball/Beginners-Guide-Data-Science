Made this for Thanksgiving.  Everyone, including non-vegans, loved it!  I was asked if I could make it again for Christmas.  This is very creamy and smooth.  It's easy to make and a real party winner.  If non-vegans wish, they can add sour cream to their own serving.  I add dill to this recipe because dill in mashed potatoes is like chocolate-covered strawberries, like caramel-apples, like peanut butter and jelly, like...

I was pleasantly surprised by these mashed potatoes.  I had to use dry spices but it still turned out great.  They had to sit around for about an hour because I had to take them somewhere else and we didn't eat for over an hour.  They needed to be reheated and fluffed up with more olive oil.  They definitely tasted better right when they were finished, but I will certainly make these again for any vegan or non-vegan!

I will DEFINITELY make these again. I cannot eat milk or cream or cheese...so these are the only potatoes that I can eat. I am so thankful for this recipe.

These were very flavorful and tasty. The roasted garlic put it over the top.

Delicious! The only thing I think I would do next time is to put the herbs into a tied cheesecloth b/c the rosemary leaves fell off the branch and were all over the potatoes (which would normally be fine, but I had to pick them all out for hubby's sake, lol). Other than that and adding more salt than called for, to taste, this had great flavor and I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The rosemary sprig fell apart while boiling, and in the end it needed more salt than the recipe calls for. But other than that it was a great alternative to the dairy-heavy mashed potatoes that are out there. Will definitely make again.

Used dry thyme and no rosemary. Also used only 1/2 cup vegetable broth and 2 Tbs Smart Balance butter spread instead of potato water.

Did not like the consistency and it was rather bland. I think it would have been better if used almond milk and vegan butter.
