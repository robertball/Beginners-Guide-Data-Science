Made this for the first time, and my family loved it! I loved the fact that it was a super quick and easy weeknight meal!  Next time, I may try using white wine instead of the pasta water to thin it out a bit.

We loved this recipe!  My husband doesn't eat tomatoes, except in spaghetti sauce, but he loved the cherry tomatoes in this recipe.  Very easy to make too!  I served it with sugar snap peas and it was a very filling meal, with leftovers to take to work the next day.  Warmed up was just as good as fresh.

I made this tonight.  It's DISGUSTING!  This PHILADELPHIA Savoury Garlic Cooking Creme Cream Cheese is nasty.  I just wasted $9 in chicken.
