I made this for a choir potluck and got raves from everyone!  It is delicious and easy to make.  My husband was quite disappointed that I was not leaving any at home for him!

Delicious & pretty simple to make. Don't forget to chill the dough before you bake. We've made this recipe 3 times and gotten rave reviews each time.

These were good.  Unfortunately, I was hoping to serve them as dessert for a nice, formal dinner.  I didn't think they were great enough for that, so I'll keep looking.  But these were definitely tasty & easy.  They'd be good for a brunch.

These were very flavorful and easy to make. I brought them to a BBQ. I wouldn't have thought with how easy it was that they would have been so well received!
