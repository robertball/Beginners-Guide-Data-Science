AS A BAKED BEANAHOLIC, I CAN SAY THESE WERE ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I FOLLOWED THE RECIPE TO THE T [CAN'T UNDERSTAND CHANGING A RECIPE UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IT]& IT WAS EASY, DELICIOUS, & MAKES A LOT. IT IS INDEED A MEAL IN ITSELF, & A SLICE OF FRESH BREAD/BUTTER MAKES IT TRUE COMFORT FOOD! THANKS FOR A TRUE KEEPER!

LOVED this recipe!!  I did make one substitution and that was for the ham (didn't have).  I used finely chopped bbq pork.  For the ground beef, I had some leftover hot dog sauce (Grandpa' Classic Coney Dog Sauce recipe) that I used.  I've made many baked beans recipes and my guests and I really liked the flavors this dish had.  It's almost a meal by itself.  I had always cooked my beans in the oven for at least an hour prior to this recipe.  I really liked the ease of putting all the ingredients into the crockpot and letting cook on high for 2 hours.  Next time, I will add the water as needed after stirring occasionally for a thicker sauce.  Can't wait to make these again for our next big BBQ bash!

Very disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly and it still tasted like beans right out of the can---with a lot of meat added. Very time consuming and not at all worth the effort.

I added a bag of "bean meat", leftover scraps of smoked brisket and smoked pork butt I always save and freeze after slicing a brisket or pulling a butt for pulled pork. Then I cooked these on my smoker with pecan, stirring frequently to impart nice smokey flavor. GOOD EATS MAYNARD!!!

These are soooo delish!!!  I have made these several times & I always get so many compliments on them! I have used smoked sausage and ham, in addition to the bacon & ground beef.  Just so yummy!

WOW--- wow, wow, wow!!!!  What a dish!  I followed it to the letter....except, I had smoked a beef brisket yesterday, and couldn't resist chopping and adding some to these beans!  These are delicious!  My husband will go crazy when he tastes these!  It really is a meal in itself.  I think I am going to make some coleslaw and good crusty bread or Texas toast to go with it!  This will feed a crowd!  I have tried similar meat and bean recipes, but this recipe 'rocks'!!  I'll make this again and again!!! Thank you so much to the person who posted this!!!

Great recipe. It took a long time to put together, but disappeared fast at a potluck. I overheard quite a few people saying, "who brought those great beans?" I may use this recipe for every potluck I attend in the future! Thanks.

awesome! very easy to make. However, I didnt use ham and reduced the molasses, I was afraid to put entire amount of molasses. I used 1/2 tablespoon. Next time I will use all of the molasses and ham. Everyone loved them!

First, I am not a cook and love this site for all of the help the reviews give me for recipes. I thought this recipe sounded like a lot of work and it was but after following a recipe once it always is easier for me the second time. Because it was an experiment I only made 15 servings. My mistake should of made more. 2nd I myself am not a big baked bean fan. That said I went ahead and made these for 4th of July Bar-B-Q. Vanished before my eyes... I tried to scrape out the slow cooker to save some for my bean eating spouse. An adult niece came looking for them and they were GONE!!! I will absolutely make these again. And if it is for a event will double the recipe. Yes, I liked them too!

Very good.  This has so much meat that it could be a meal in itself.  Great for a BBQ potluck.

The first time I made this, my family found it too sweet, so I omitted the sugar and my family loves when I make this dish.  I also add a can of chick peas and a can of kidney beans.

It was great!  Added a little orange bell pepper and more brown sugar.
