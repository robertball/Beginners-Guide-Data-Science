This recipe was SCRUMPTIOUS! I did make some alterations though. I took the chicken breast and cut them up in little strips before I breaded and cooked them. I would use only 1 egg and less bread crumbs than the recipe suggests, as you end up throwing a lot away. 

The flavors in this recipe are so good. It's something that could easily be served at the Macaroni Grill. Enjoy!

Excellent! Easy, and very VERY tasty. I halved the chili flakes (too spicy for my kids otherwise) and the breadcrumbs (even with just 1 cup, I threw a bunch away). Also, I prefer to serve the chicken 'on top' of the sauce instead of mixed in, to preserve the crispy quality of the breading. YUM!!!

This was as good as it was easy. I had started out making the Chicken, Sausage and Zucchini Pasta (on this site) but realized I didn't have any sausage or zucchini! Then I found this recipe and was pleasantly surprised! It had just the right amount of spiciness and I liked that the chicken was crispy. One reviewer suggested using only one egg and I second that - 2 eggs would have been too much. I also just used regular chicken breast (instead of cutlet) and diced it. 
And I only used about half of the oil called for. Seemed like too much when it was in the pan. Good recipe overall and will make it again when I don't have the ingredients for the Chicken Sausage Pasta!

I LOVE this recipe!  I've made it numerous times, and each time it turns out great.  If I'm in a hurry, I skip the chicken and just make the sauce and serve it over penne.  I've made this for guests many times, and each time it gets rave reviews!!

Love it. This is so good. I did however forget to thaw some chicken for this but discovered that I had the Tyson breaded chicken breast fillets and used those instead. Didn't make any difference at all because it was still delicious and all I had to do was throw them in the oven while the pasta and the sauce cooked. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tommorow.

LOVED IT! I made only one slight addition I added sliced black olives. I had this in an Italian restaurant and they added olives gives the sauce a slight saltiness. I don't know if people realize this but Arrabiata means angry hence the amount of red pepper flakes we did add a little(which I like very much). I will make again and again for sure thanks VAMPYRESKA

So easy and so good! I did however cut way back on the oil using only a few Tbsp. to sautee the garlic. And, if you are not used to "hot and spicy" cut back on the red pepper flakes - I used 1/2 tsp. and that was plenty hot for me.  I also added two 8 oz. can of tomato sauce vs. 1/2 cup and let it simmer until it thickened up.  I served it with sweet Italian sausage instead of the chicken (personal preference) and topped it with some shredded Parmesan. Great dish!

This was a very good recipe.  It had the right blends of flavor and the pepper flakes added a little heat to it.  This is a keeper.  The leftovers were also very good.

delicious recipe. i used a can of stewed tomatoes and 2 tbsp of tomato paste because that's all I had.  i also added about a tbsp of red pepper flakes bc it wasn't spicy enough and about a half cup of sliced mushrooms. I used shrimp instead of chicken and used panko to bread the shrimp. all in all, a great recipe!

This recipe rocks! I ended up using an entire 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, and after frying my chicken I used 1/2 cup of white wine to deglaze the pan (dumping the oil first), stirring up all those delicious browned on bits and adding those to the sauce, along with a bit of oregano. Also added about 1/3 cup grated Parmesan and alot of parsley to the breadcrumb mixture. I served the chicken whole on the side. This meal was out of site! I'd give it 10 stars if I could! Thanks, VAMPYRESKA.

Very good recipe! I used cooked turkey from the day before, although it was already cooked I still made the breading and cooked it for a few seconds.  I also added other spices to the sauce (oregano,italian seasonning and more chili powder).  I didn't have penne so I used ziti pasta)

Really full of flavor!  I used a half tsp. of red pepper flakes, and it still had lots of kick.  I would recommend using a minimal amount of olive oil to saute the garlic (definitely not the full 1/4 cup as stated)...I used 2 1/2 Tablespoons and the sauce had oil floating on top, but that is the only negative aspect of this recipe.  One egg and one cup of bread crumbs are all you'll need.  I used rosemary bread to make the bread crumbs for extra flavor.  Also, slicing the chicken before breading seems like a better way to get more crispy edges.  I did not stir the chicken into the sauce, but just put it on top so it would stay crispy.

My fiance is from Brooklyn so I decided to try this recipe.  Let me tell you, it is so Brooklyn. I have eaten at Gino's in Brooklyn and this recipe is right up there with Gino's menu.  The only thing I changes was adding less garlic. So worth the time to make.

I couldn't find a 28 oz. can of the tomatoes w/ olive oil and garlic, so I did one 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes w/ olive oil, basil and balsamic, and one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes with roasted garlic. I think it came out perfectly. The breading was really good, even though it didn't stick to the chicken so well and mixed in with the sauce instead. My pot wasn't big enough to mix the pasta in at the end, but serving the chicken and sauce over it worked. I have even skipped the breading and put the spices that were supposed to go in the breading directly into the sauce and it was still great-- and much faster to prepare!

SPLENDID recipe, I am a lover of Italian food-loved all the flavors this presented.  I did cut back the bread crumbs, but not the egg. I also tried using chicken breasts cubed instead, but the flavor just did not  come through as well.  my advise is to just stay with the recipe-except for perhaps the bread crumbs or personal tastes in spices.  The author of the recipe Knows Her Stuff!

Delicious!! I was out of tomato sauce, so I used a can of condensed Tomato Soup. It turned out great, anyway! Even my husband and young kids loved it. I cut the red pepper in half, but then put the bottle on the counter for the adults to spice it up. We will definitely keep this in the rotation. Thanks.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this recipe! I scaled back the servings to 3.  I added fresh yellow squash, 1/2" slices, quartered and sauteed with the garlic. The basil adds great flavor. Used chicken tenders in place of chicken cutlets.  My only complaint was using 3 separate pans to prepare everything in.  DELICIOUS!!

The sauce recipe was pretty good - it reminds me a lot of the "Tagliarini Picchi Pacchiu" dish at Carrabba's. I did add a pinch of sugar to mine while it was simmering because it just tasted way too acidic/tomatoey. 

Like another reviewer, I'm not a big fan of fried chicken cutlets over red sauces, so I just used some sweet Italian sausage. It was better the second day, of course.

This was DELICIOUS!  My kitchen smelled like my favorite Italian restaurant and I felt like a real chef making it.  Note on the red pepper:  My son and I liked it exactly the way it was but my husband thought it was a little too hot - so depending upon your heat tolerance, you can simply adjust the amount of red pepper.

Dang, this was yummy!  I used turkey cutlets instead and halved the red pepper flakes just cause I have little kids.  I probably simmered the sauce  a little longer and it reduced down and made an amazingly flavorful sauce!

This recipe is very good. The only thing I changed is that I don't mix the chicken in with it. I serve it on the side and it stays crispy.

Excellent recipe and flavor. Very worth the effort. Served chicken on the side instead of mixed in the pasta.

Edible... ?
Bottom Line: for the amount of time it took to make and how it ended up looking and tasting, it wasn't worth it for me.
The chicken tasted OK but why take the time to crisp it up only to make it all soggy again?  Save an egg, use only one egg to coat the chicken, it really doesn't need that much, I ended up dumping about an egg and a half after all the chicken was dip.

Made it with sliced grilled chicken breast, YUMMO!!  The red pepper flakes gave it a perfect kick as written, I ran out of olive oil with less than 1/4 cup but everyone still loved it. This will be on the rotation now - or whenever we have leftover chicken!

This is an excellent recipe. IT is very easy to follow and it tastes great as is. I alter things when I make it depending on the ingredients I have at the time and even then it works great!

Great sauce!! I didn't feel that the chicken really did anything much to add to the taste, although I tried it a second time with a few pepperoni slices mixed in and that was fantastic!

I've used this recipe for at least a couple of years.  The only modification I make is to decrease the red pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon.  I like spice but my husband is a bit more sensitive, and a full teaspoon is a lot.  One thing I would note is that it's totally worth it to thinly slice the garlic.  It's just better than chopped garlic in this recipe, and totally worth the extra effort.  I have also used just the sauce portion as a bruschetta-type topping.

I make this all the time and love it!!  Such a good recipe.  I make it with wheat pasta and leave out the chicken and bread crumbs.  I like adding whatever else I have around...garbanzo beans and black olives are some favorites!

This is off the hook insanely good! The only thing I did differently is I am vegetarian so I bought Morning Star frozen chicken strips and breaded and fried those instead of the real mc coy! Everyone loved it! This recipe is a DEFINITE keeper!

I love love love this!!! It was so easy to make and so good, I didn't add as much red pepper b/c I don't like things too spicy and I add a few tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mixture. If you do that, then omit the salt, the cheese is salty enough and gave the chicken great flavor. I also used dried basil instead of fresh and I server the chicken alongside the penne, instead of mixing it in.  I didn't want my breading soggy. PERFECT!!!

EXCELLENT dish... I made it with whole wheat penne and it was great.  The only thing I would do differently is pound the chicken a lot thinnner than I did.  My husband loved it as well, and it makes plenty!!!

Excellent sauce.  I did not use the chicken portion of this recipe.  Instead, I sauteed some shrimp in olive oil and garlic and threw them in the sauce for the last 10 minutes.  I also added green and orange bell pepper to the sauce right at the beginning.  The shrimp and peppers were a great addition!

AMAZING!!  I was hesitant at first about so much red pepper flakes, but I followed the rules and it came out with great flavor and not too much spice.  I chose to cube my chicken into bite-sized pieces before frying.  I began by using 1 egg and 1 cup of bread crumbs (as many had suggested) and cutting the spices added to it in half.  However once I started breading, I found I needed the other egg and a big more bread crumbs than the 1 cup.  Maybe cubing created more surface area which needed more to cover it (or maybe my fingers were sufficiently breaded and used a great deal of it? lol).  FANTASTIC recipe.  I won't give a 10 to often, but this definitely rates a 10!!

This was really outstanding! For the chicken breading, I used only 1 egg and half as much bread crumbs (with full amount of garlic powder, salt and pepper) -- and still have bread crumb mixture left over for more chicken cutlets. I also used half as much red pepper flakes and thought it still had plenty of kick. AND I used only 1 tb. olive oil to saute the garlic and pepper flakes. No need for all that extra oil in the tomato sauce. Also substituted 1 tb. dried Italian seasoning for the fresh basil, since I'm not a huge basil fan. My husband loved this, served with a green salad.

Amazing sauce and very simple, I actually skipped the whole chicken thing and just sauteed jumbo shrimp in garlic and butter, tossed together with the sauce and penne - it was amazing!

Wow!  Spicy!!  We aren't crazy about dishes that are too hot, so I modified.  I cut the red pepper flakes to a little less than 1/2 tsp.  I also cut the garlic in half and used almost a full cup of tomato sauce.  Besides that, I prepared the sauce as directed, and it was delicious.  I agree with others, 1 egg and 1 cup of bread crumbs is plenty.  I crushed flavoured croutons instead of using plain bread crumbs. I topped the pasta with fresh grated Parmesan cheese...mmmm!! Hubby loved it, and asked to have it added to our recipe collection.

I never do reviews, but this was great. Increase sauce to 1 cup (just cause I didn't want to waste half a can), only used about 1 cup breadcrumbs to which I added 1/2 cup parm cheese. Also, cut the chicken up into slices as another reviewer suggested, which I thought worked well since you get a crispy coating on all sides.

I've made this 2 times now, 1st time I followed the recipe exactly & it was absolutely delicious! The 2nd time I didn't do the breading on the chicken, it was still good, just not as good. This recipe has defiantly made the rotation! Very good!

Great pasta recipe!! Like other viewers I also used a tad bit less bread crumbs due to you throw most of it away... I also used the ITALIAN bread crumbs along with the spices the recipe said to add. I used whole wheat penne pasta and more red pepper than the recipe calls for. I also cut my chicken into strips before I breaded them =) Next time I think I'll add some red onions and possibly some bell pepper && zucchini. Definitely a keeper!!

This was absolutely delicious! I did make a few changes, based on what I had on hand. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, between 1.5 & 2 lbs, diced into large bite-sized pieces. I didn't bread the chicken, just pan fried it with the garlic powder, salt and pepper. Also, I was out of tomato sauce, so I made my own using a can of tomato paste mixed with equal parts water, and used 1/2 cup of that. Next time I may use a little more tomato sauce. Finally, I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I used 1/2 tsp of ground red pepper. All in all, it was absolutely wonderful. Definitely a keeper!!!

AWESOME!  I have a very picky Italian husband he helped himself over and over again.  The only thing I will say if you plan on doubling the recipe, do not double the red pepper and the garlic.  It was pretty spicy....

I was absolutely AMAZED by how GOOD this dish was!  This has a great balance of the good ol' Italian flavor with a Spicy kick to it!  Great!!!  Oh, the 6 Garlic cloves are NOT TOO much at all!  Everything is well balanced in the end, so don't be afraid to use all 6, it won't overwhelm the flavor.

Delicious, with a few changes to suit my personal tastes.  Instead of doing the chicken, I sliced up some hot Italian sausage links, a red bell pepper, and a small yellow onion.  I sauteed them with the red pepper flakes and garlic until the sausage was lightly browned and the veggies were tender.  This makes it a 2-pot recipe instead of a 3-pot, so less cleanup.  Then I added 28 oz of crushed tomatoes (I don't care for the chunks), the tomato sauce and basil, and some salt to taste.  Simmered 20 min, mixed it all up with the cooked penne, and topped with fresh mozzarella and a sprinkling of parsley.  Spicy sausage and peppers - yum!  I did decrease the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp instead of the full tsp.  Will make again - thanks!

Delicious and easy!!!  This my favorite pasta dish that I make at home.  We make this at least twice a month, the only pasta dish we are still making since going on a diet.  We love basil so we add as much as we want as it reduces when cooked so use more that you think you want.

What a wonderful meal! I love the chicken/mozzarella/basil sandwich at Max&Erma's and this sauce was reminiscent of that. Incredible! I don't think I'll bother frying the chicken next time as I like it broiled just fine, but I know this recipe will be a hit tonight. Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW, this was absolutely awesome!  It had just enough spice (and yes it did have a little kick) to make this a wonderful and falvorful dish.  What impressed me even more is that when I had leftovers, it tasted almost just as good as the original which is hard to do with pasta.

This recipe was fabulous!!  I made it for my very Italian friend and was a nervous wreck that she wouldn't like it.  She didn't like it, she said she loved it.  I would have thought she was just being nice but she took a second helping!!  The recipe was very spicy (just like I like!) but next time I make if for the whole family, I'll probably use less red pepper so the kids can eat it too.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Definately a keeper!

I didn't use as much oil, just a good amount to saute the garlic in.  I also did not bread the chicken.  I added some chopped fresh spinach (the kids didn't even comment on this) and topped it with parmesan.

I've made this dish twice already. It is so good! I don't change a thing! The chicken came out so juicy and the breading is superb. The red pepper flakes gives it a great spiciness.

Very good! I used Panko breadcrumbs and would not recommend using them in this recipe. When placed in the pasta/sauce mixture, the panko began to separate from the chicken and float around in the pan with the sauce....YUCK! I'm not sure if breadcrumbs would do the same? However, next time, I will cook the chicken separetly all the way and add it on at the end to the plate...not the skillet.

This one didn't turn out for us.  I must have done something wrong, as my chicken lost it's coating and was not crisp after simmering in the sauce.  It's possible I didn't fry the chicken long enough.  The sauce tasted good...but I will amend the recipe if I make again so that chicken goes in last to retain crispy texture.

Super yummy.  Yes, it is spicy but not bad.  I didn't have Red Pepper Flakes so I subbed Ground Red Pepper.  I served the kids the chicken, and pasta mixed with a little butter (no sauce).  Great, affordable recipe.  Fresh basil is a must!

Good everyone liked... Took boneless breast sliced up and did the egg & breadcrumbs.  Kids liked chicken. Adam liked not to heavy.   Fresh parm would be good.

Wow!  I would give this 10 stars if I could.  This is awesome.  I did scale back the pepper because my children do not like hot things.  There was still plenty of heat though.  I will make this again and again.

Absolutely delicious. I was not a huge tomato fan before, but I loved them in this dish. The oil was a bit much for me, so I cut it down, and because I'm super lactose intolerant I crushed some crackers instead of using bread crumbs. You can't really tell the difference. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was delicious! My family loved it. Definitely recommend.

THIS WAS SO GOOD and so simple, i think it would be good even without the chicken. to save calories and time, i did not fry or bread the chicken i just sauteed it in some olive oil with salt pepper and italian herbs. i accidentally used stewed tomatoes and the whole can of tomato sauce and it turned out great. also i used whole wheat penne,forgot the fresh basil and instead used a mix of italian dried herbs. yummy!!

If you don't like spice, cut back on the red pepper flakes, but this was a delicious spicy tomato sauce.  I served it with Meatball Nirvana from this site instead of the chicken.  Agree with others this doesn't make 6 servings.  More like 3-4.

This is delicious. I actually used turkey bacon for this instead of chicken, and it turns out great. I added some red pepper to make it spicy and didn't need the eggs or the bread crumbs since I did not use chicken in it. The sauce was fantastic and very healthy. The only feedback I would give is adjust the garlic. If you like a lot of garlic, go with recipe as is. If you like a little milder taste, you can take some of it out. Fortunately, my boyfriend loved the garlic flavor and this is a hit I've made 2 or 3 times at my house now! Enjoy!

This was great!  I made Pesto Cheesy Chicken Rolls from this site and so left the chicken out of this recipe.  The noodles and sauce by itself was great!!

Excellent.  Too much fat for an all the time dinner, but perfect for the occasional treat!

Delicious and easy!  I followed many suggestions and cut the chicken breast into strips before dipping and cooking.   Absolutely would make again!

AH-MAZ-ING!!!!   The ONLY change I recommend making is less EVOO in the sauce and more EVOO in the pan to fry the chicken. That's it! I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dry basil and it turned out great. My husband took leftovers to work. He NEVER does that.

This was ok. The family was in agreement that it wasn't one of our favorite, and probably won't be made again. There are just better red sauce/chicken/noodle recipes out there. Just nothing special about this one - made as-is. Thanks for letting us try something new though.

This is a really good weeknight meal.  I usually cut the chicken breast in to smaller strips to help with eating, and to cut calories I have skiped on the breading at times.  Great flavors!

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I used egg beaters instead of eggs to cut the fat content when frying the chicken.  You can't tell the difference.

I can only really rate half of this recipe, since I only made the pasta portion!  Just to note, I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dry.  This came out excellent, with even my husband raving about how good it was.  I also threw in black olive slices for a little something extra.  I can't wait to make this dish with the chicken!

Delicious and easy to make. I agree with cutting down the amount of bread crumbs. You could even half the amount of required oil. GREAT dinner.

I love this recipe! I didn't have chicken cutlets so I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and just cut it into strips. This recipe was really simple and it tasted so good. My husband told me to add this one to our recipe book- and he can be really picky! Excellent! Thanks for sharing VAMPYRESKA!!

I LOVE THIS!! Been making it for a while now and I usually use one can italian diced tom. and one can italian stewed tom. and add about two tbsp of tomato paste instead of tom sauce and use all dried herbs/garlic to make it easier along with store bought breaded chicken breast.....yum-o!!

This recipe is outstanding. The canned tomato products called for make it quick and easy; the fresh Basil adds a little upscale flair. You could add steps and ingredients to this recipe- but it's unlikely they would improve it. Thanks for sharing it, Brooklyn!

This is a great, very simple dish to prepare,what a lot of fuss some reviewers have made about all the cleaning up and preparation!! I used to ammount of oil in the recipe, I did leave the sauce to simmer for longer and ended up with a really lovely rich sauce. You could easily add more garlic to this recipe, it sweetens as it cooks. Also I added a bay leaf and sliced black olives, I'm addicted to them. Served chicken on top, divine!!! I added more spice, I have a great jar of minced garlic and chilli so added a teaspoon, also salt and freshly ground black pepper. Shall definately be making this on a regular basis!!!!!! Thanks!!!! Oops almost forgot, unfortunately, I only had dried basil, not quite the same! Next time I'll be sure to get fresh!!

The first couple of times, I followed this recipe to a T. Great! However, I couldn't help but think that I would like it if the sauce had some salt, 2 t. of red pepper flakes instead of 1 t., and the sauce was thicker ( a bit too watery in my opinion). As for the breading, I only use one egg to dip the chicken in (it's enough), use 1 c. of bread crumbs (still have a lot left over), and add 2t. of cayenne pepper for an even bigger spice kick. Then, this recipe is five stars! It's still great without the modifications though! My dinner guests LOVED it!

This was good but not something I plan to make often. I took others advice and did not mix in the chicken for fear of losing the crispy coating

So good! I followed the suggestions, and served the chicken separately. I used one egg, but all the breadcrumbs - and I was happy I did, since it was just enough. I used panko breadcrumbs for some added crunch, 1 tbsp red pepper flakes, and added onion and garlic powders to the sauce. It was so good, that I'm eating just the pasta (no meat) as leftovers - and I never eat meatless meals! Thanks!

This was fantastic! I had purcahsed some prepared chicken breasts for chicken parm and decided to make this instaed. The sauce is amazing! I kept the chicken seperate to maintain some crispyness. 
Have never had arrabiata with chicken. Nice change of pace. Will definitely make again. Even better is that I will also eat the leftovers.

I make this a lot and love it.  I slice the chicken breast before I coat them and cook them.  Cooks faster and makes for a nice presentation on the plate.

This recipe was very easy and the result tasted like it came out of a very expensive italian restaurant.  I didn't use quite as much garlic and I used italian bread crumbs instead of just plain ones.  I also didn't have any fresh basil so I used just regular dry basil.  This recipe still came out awesome!  I will definetly make this again for my family (who loved it!).

This is great. I used already cooked chicken breast strips to reduce cooking time and I added deli style mozzarella and baked it at 325 for about 15 min to melt the cheese and it was great. Make sure you drain at least one can of the diced tomatoes so theres not too much liquid.Wished i would of used more red pepper cause we like it HOT!

Very good...simple sauce with strong garlic flavor, which is what we like.  We served ours with regular speghetti as it was what we had on hand.  Also we were out of basil, but it was still quite good without it.  Will definately be making this one again.

Was ok, but I did add green peppers, mushrooms, and onion to the sauce since I had them cut up from the night before. The one thing that really killed this for me was how HOT this was. I'm not sure why it was that hot or if it was meant to be. Only got worse after sitting in the fridge overnight.

Edit: Made this 4 years later and I didn't change anything except used diced tomatoes with onion/celery/peppers in it instead of garlic(it doesn't really need more with 6 cloves) and olive oil. First night was really disappointed in the taste. Husband actually said it was bordering on distasteful.

But the next day we had leftovers and it was really good. I guess it just needed to sit overnight and be reheated. 

Next time I'd use regular sized chicken breasts, cut it into slices, throw some spices on it, and cook it when the sauce is simmering for the 20 minutes. The breading just gets soggy once it's mixed in with everything anyway and adds nothing to the dish except for the spice in the breading. No point in doing all the work of breading and frying it(plus the extra calories from oil, breading, and eggs) if it doesn't add something to the dish. Since you're already cooking the sauce so long, might as well throw the chicken in with the spice on there and save time and not have soggy breading.

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly, but left out the chicken. Served with a salad and garlic toast. And for those who are complaining that it is "too spicy"... Arrabbiata means "angry" in Italian, and it is a SPICY red pasta sauce. When you leave out or even cut down on the red pepper flakes, it is not an Arrabbiata anymore.

This recipe was great! I love pasta so adding this recipe to my book was worth it. I made minor changes. Last minute grocery shopping and couldn't find basil so I used Cilantro. And instead of the cutlets I used boneless chicken breast. As a few others mentioned Using one egg & less bread crumbs is a good idea! Not all is being used. This recipe was very easy to make. Yumm!

Easy to make and tasty. To save time, I usually just throw in the chicken breast without coating them with the breadcrumbs.

It's alot like chicken parmesan on steroids... which is delicious! The changes I made were tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, I used dried basil (and added oregano, salt and pepper to the sauce) because I didn't have fresh. Less olive oil, and I used non-stick spray instead of oil to fry the breaded chicken. I also homemade the bread crumbs. Used spaghetti instead of penne. Thanks for the deliciousness!

This recipe is fabulous and packs a lot of punch.  I did reduce the amount of oil by half and the amount of red pepper flakes by 1/4tsp.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  It was amazing.  I've also done it without the basil and it turned out fine.  This recipe is very versatile and can be made with any number of additions.  I've added peppers and spinach to the sauce and it turned out wonderfully.

This was pretty good.  I added half a spanish onion, chopped finely, with the garlic. Didin't have basil so I added dried herb de provence.  Simmered until little liquid left.  Also I left the chicken out.

I only had a whole chicken in my freezer, so I ended up cooking down the chicken and shredding a mix of light and dark meet and putting it in the sauce.  It was still good!  I'll make it next time as described in the recipe.  I thought it was great.  To quote my daughter's friend "it tastes like it came from a restaurant"'!

This is pretty fantastic!  I made the recipe as close to stated as possible, with the exception of using a lot less oil (I eyeballed it, as we make chicken cutlets quite often), used only 1 egg (with 1 Tbsp of milk, because that's what my mom taught me) and I used Italian Style bread crumbs because that is what we always have, which just streamlined prep.  I added red wine to the sauce as my own spin (again eyeballed it...maybe 1/8 of a cup?)...and had to cut some canned whole plum tomatoes because I didn't have diced.  I prefer plum tomatoes for my sauces anyway. :)  1 Tbsp of dried basil because I don't have fresh and that was that.  Hubby pronounced it fantastic also, but gave up after 3/4 of his plate was gone because it was a little too spicy for him.  Next time I'll use half a tsp.  1 tsp was plenty for me and I'm sure my mom and dad would have LOVED it.  Will definitely make again and this time let mom and dad have some. ;)

I don't usually like chicken with tomato sauce, but this turned out to be a keeper (thanks dinner spinner app).  As suggested by others, I halved the olive oil, red pepper, and bread crumbs.

Very-Very good recipe, we loved it! I will definitely make this on a regular basis. It's a wonderful and different meal to use with chicken. I love that you add breaded chicken to it. Next time I'm going to use Panko Bread Crumbs just to find out which one we like better. Make sure to double the sauce because the meat soaked up alot of it. I usually double every sauce recipe I make and I should have done it with this one too, but I'll know better next time. I used Italian Seasoned Bread Crumbs so I left out all the seasonings for it and it was very flavorful. That was the only thing I changed. Awesome recipe - Thank YOU for sharing it!

Wow!  I loved this!! I did only one thing not listed in this recipe....I cut the chicken before breading.  Outside of that I followed to the letter and it was amazing!!  It tasted so authentic to me.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I tried this recipe last night and was blown away at how simple and delicious it was! I modified it slightly based on ingredients I had/didn't have on hand. I did not have basil (bummer) and I added green peppers and mushrooms. I used fresh red and yellow cherry tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes. It was FABULOUS. I will be making this again and again!

.this meal was delicious and sooo easy!!! my husband loved it...I too forgot to defrost chicken and used chicken patties and it was just as good the only thing I would change is the red peppers...gave too much of a kick that the kids didn't like...maybe cut in half or omit

Loved Loved LOVED this!  I didn't change anything with the sauce.  Next time, I'll pound the chicken breasts a little bit more to cook faster.  And I'm going to try this by adding ground beef, instead of chicken....I need a good meat sauce.  Will definitely keep this as a staple around my house!!

This was pretty good, but needed some mods for flavor so I gave it only 4 stars.  Flavor mods were addition of onions and fresh herbs (oregano, thyme, and rosemary), plus an extra can of diced tomatos in order to make an adequate amount of sauce, and 1tsp sugar to cut back the acid of the tomatoes.   For dietary considerations (which did not affect the stars), we made it low carb by skipping the breading step and dropped the pasta.  Also we lowered the fat by starting with only 1/8 C EVOO and sauteeing the chicken directly in the evoo along with the garlic and onions, then adding the tomatoes. We let the chicken finish cooking by simmering it in the sauce for an extra 20 minutes.  Also, we used (skinless ) chicken legs on the bone to make up for the flavor we lost when we skipped the breading.

I'm giving this five stars for a fantastic sauce that is easy to make.  I'm vegetarian so I left out the chicken and didn't think it would be fair to rate that part of the dish, obviously.  This sauce is really delicious; it's spicy but not overwhelming...you mouth gets to enjoy all the flavors rather than just the heat.  I could easily serve this to guests for a small dinner party.  Thanks for sharing, Beth!

Yum! What a tasty Italian dish! Both my hubs and I really enjoyed this. I've always been a fan of Ellen's arrabbiata sauce (also on this site), but this is equally as good - if not better! I wasn't sure about the addition of chicken, but to my surprise, it didn't get soggy as I thought it would (which is the reason I was skeptical about adding it to begin with...). The key to keeping your chicken crisp is browning it REALLY well and when adding the cut pieces to your sauce, only simmering for 10 minutes as directed (any longer, it will get mushy). Served with rosemary foccacia and our favorite white wine, this was a FANTASTIC meal. Now I want to visit the Canarsie section of Brooklyn for the real deal! :-)

This is a restaurant-quality recipe that easy enough for any at-home cook to make!  I was incredibly pleased with how it turned out.  We're not fans of hot spice, so next time we will half the amount of crushed red pepper flakes but otherwise keep everything the same.  This is definitely going to get made again and again.

I agree with other comments, pay attention to the serving calculator.  This makes SIX good sized servings.  Lots of leftovers for the two of us!

The best! I followed the recipe exactly and served with mushroom stuffed zucchini from this site. My whole family gobbled this up. Will make this again certainly, even with plain old grilled chicken instead of the breaded to save time and calories

I made this for dinner tonight. It was pretty good, but needs more flavor in my opinion. I only altered it a little due to ingredients on hand. I did not have fresh basil, so I used dried, and I did not have tomato sauce, but I had tomato paste, so I just added water. I also used plain diced tomatoes, as well. I will probably try it again with the exact ingredients to see how it works that way.

I did add the chicken later so the breading wouldn't get mushy, and also added black olives.

3-4 stars. 1 TBL of oil to saute is fine. I measured  less than half of the red pepper flakes, and it was still strong for us.  I used leftover chicken and cut strips off from last night's fryer. I dipped them in one egg, tossed with bread crumbs (not measured) and broiled for 3 minutes. Glad I served on top of the pasta, or else they would have been lost. Oh! I also stirred in fresh spinach in the sauce; it added more color and flavor.

I can't say this was my favourite.  My husband found it much to spicy, but for me it was just a little heat.  I would rather keep the chicken on the side, as it seemed a little soggy once mixed in.  If you are planning on making this, I would reduce the chilies, and maybe add some mushrooms to give it a bit more flavour.  I was not crazy about using 1/2 a cup of oil either!!!

I made this tonite for dinner. We all enjoyed it..I think the spicyness came out by sauteing the garlic and red pepper flakes together. Is an easy dish to make and none was left in the pot.

This dish was fantastic!  My entire family loved it, even my 8 year old.  Was so easy to make and would be great (and easy) to serve to guests.  This one is a keeper- thanks Brooklyn Girl!

Excellent. I did end up doubling the tomatoes because it just didn't seem saucy enough for our tastes. Added mushrooms and used seasoned breadcrumbs, but otherwise followed the recipe and we were very pleased with the results. I can't wait to eat leftovers at lunch! Thanks :)

I just made this today. It was absolutely amazing. My daughter who hates any tomato based sauce, loved it and said that it is the best past sauce ever. Hubby says it was great and I need to put this on our "A list". That being said, I did add extra ingredients. I added 1 red bell pepper and 1 onion diced and sauteed with the garlic. I also added dried rosemary, italian seasoning and parsely and 1 can of tomato sauce instead of 1/2 cup. I did not add salt at all because the canned tomatoes and sauce already have plenty. Will be making again.

IT was GREAT! Tad bit too spicy for my 12 yr old but she cleaned her plate anyway. I used turkey breast cutlets and breaded it with ranch flavored seasoned bread crumbs. I did not cut it in slices and mix it with sauce. After I mixed pasta with sauce, I spooned it on plate and placed the turkey cutlets on top of it. I put in tons of garlic cloves because I wanted to use it up, it was sitting in my fridge. I dont think I will need to worry about Vampires when going to bed tonight.

This was pretty good - it just took me longer to cook and a lot of pans. I opted out of red pepper flakes and didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I used two tsps of minced garlic and some garlic powder. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried. I also only had 14 oz can of diced tomato so I used stewed tomatoes (though diced is better). I used one egg on the chicken and cut up breasts into cutlets. I also used whole wheat penne. Overall, we really enjoyed this and I think I would make it again. I think next time, I would take a reviewer's suggestion and put the chicken on top instead of in the sauce.

So so so so delicious! I can't get enough! Everyone loves this sauce! Just the right amount of kick. I used dried basil and cut the chicken into strips before I breaded it, but other than that I stayed true to the recipe and was amazed! I've made this with chicken, shrimp, meatballs, crab, and it's always good!  I'm definitely putting this dish in regular rotation!

Okay I was really surprised with this recipe because I though that it wouldn't have a lot of flavor and boy was I wrong.  Even my little 3yr old loved it and sorry no leftovers. Thanks again for the suggestion.

This was very good!!  I changed a couple of things to make it a little healthier - I cut the chicken into tenders and baked them instead of frying.  I also reduced the oil a little and only used 1/2 tsp of red pepper because of DD.  My husband said it wasn't spicy enough however.  Although everyone agreed I should make this again!!  Thanks for sharing.

I think this was a lovely recipe.  I messing up a couple times, I ended up using the entire 1/2 cup olive olive with the tomatoes.  It was a slight bit greasy but I still think ok.  I also only used 1/2 t of the red pepper flakes in the sauce which was still too much for my pansy a$$ husband.  I thought it was delicious.  I was afraid to mix the beautifully golden and crispy chicken pieces in with the pasta so I served it on the side, but I think if you waited til the last minute it would be ok and give the chicken pieces a bit of moisture.  I loved this.

I did everything the recipe called for except I used chicken tenders instead of cutlets and used seasoned bread crumbs on top of adding the garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Also, I didn't add the chicken to the sauce, just mixed the noodles into the sauce and placed the chicken on top of pasta to keep them crunchy.  I personally am not too fond of tomatoey sauces but this was really Yummy! The sauce had heat but not too hot, even my 11 year old who hates hot stuff liked it, even went back for seconds. The whole family loved it! I will make this again soon!

This is a really wonderful recipe!  My husband and I love it!  He requests it very often.  I may just make the sauce alone without the chicken just to put over pasta, but I do love the chicken with it!  Thanks for a DELICIOUS recipe!

It was okay, nothing to get excited about. I dont really understand all of the raving reviews. Without the pepper flakes this would have been very bland. I have a much better version of this dish that I will continue to make.

This was like chicken parm cut up and tossed with spicy tomatoe sauce. A lot of the breading on the chicken came off when tossing. A lot of work when my family would probably prefer basic chicken parm cutlets with pasta on the side.

I made this exactly as the recipe was written, except that I used a full 8 oz. of tomato sauce (I didn't want to waste the other half of the can). Like other reviewers, I didn't need a full 2 cups of bread crumbs for the chicken. It was very good, very flavorful and the rest of the family liked it as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was a great recipe! Ate the leftovers for lunch and dinner! I did change a few things. We are pretty picky eaters so I used red pepper and garlic powders and used dried basil instead of fresh. I bought the can of the diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano. (Couldn't find the can of tomatoes with only garlic and olive oil. I added olive oil to the sauce.) I'm not really a big fan of chunky tomatoes so I put them in a food processor to make them a bit smaller and to make more of a sauce. I agree with alot of the reviews about the egg and bread crumbs. You only need one egg and half the bread crumbs. I used half Italian bread crumbs and half regular and I also added parmesan cheese to the crumb mixture. I grated fresh parmesan on top when served. Yummy! Will definately make this again!!!

Excellent!!!  I will be adding this to the rotation definitely.  I feel like inviting people to dinner just so I can make this for them.  As others have said, one egg and half the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and garlic powder was plenty. I reduced the red pepper flakes to only a couple of shakes --just the right amount of spice for me, but still too much for my kids.  I didn't have any fresh basil so I used dried.  I thought the breading on the chicken slices would get mushy from being in the sauce, but that wasn't the case.  All the flavors blended so nicely.  This is a keeper! Thanks!

I made this recipe for my family last night ~ they loved it. It is easy, fast and tasty. I did not have the tomato sauce and used 1/2 cup tomato paste ~ it still was absolutely delicious! We did not have any leftovers. We are family with 2 teenagers; if you have a family of 2 -3;  I would recommend making only ½ of the recipe as it makes quite a bit of the food.

The Best!  My 6 and 36 year old (husband)love this recipe.  I had some thin sliced chicken breast and didn't know what to do with them and then I found this recipe.  Fantastic.  I wouldn't change a thing!

As a college student, I miss grandma's cooking. This meal was the perfect match between speed and flavor. As a vegetarian I cut it out, and added a bit more pepper for the kick.

Loved it. Great recipe.

We'll cook this again. 

I'm glad I read the reviews of others first, though. I used maybe half the amount of red pepper the original calls for to adjust for the tastes of my "guinea pigs." I also used whole grain penne pasta, and just a few tablespoons of olive oil... adding it when needed. 

I can't wait to try this come summertime with some fresh tomatoes, garlic, and basil from the garden :)

I ended up using a pound and half of chicken and an 18 oz package of pasta.  I also increased the sauce by one more can of  tomato sauce.  It came out perfect.  I will probably be making it at least 3 times a month.

This recipe was excellent!  I did make some minor adjustments.  Since I did not have a can of diced tomatoes with olive oil & garlic, I instead diced some fresh tomatoes and tossed it with some minced garlic and extra virgin olive oil before adding it to the pan.  I also omitted the basil since I did not have any.  And I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I cut in half lengthwise to help thin them down, instead of the cutlets.  Rather than mixing the garlic powder, salt, and pepper with the bread crumbs; I instead used garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper which I added to the egg wash before dipping the chicken breasts.  I also did add a bit more tomato sauce and olive oil as I simmered the sauce to create more sauce.  It turned out perfectly and had a nice spicy flavor.  My boyfriend loved it and took the rest of the leftovers with him to lunch today.  I will definitely be making this again.

This has become a favorite at our house.  I cut the chicken before putting in egg(1) and bread crumbs.  I have made without tomato sauce and increased the crushed tomatoes.

I've made this recipe 4 times already & it keeps getting better.  After the first time, I decided to experiment.  I added 2 red Thai chilies instead of the pepper flakes, and also add zucchini, mushrooms & onions to the sauce.  Try other veggies, too.  As for the cutlettes, I first dredged them in a flour mixture w/ salt & pepper & garlic powder and then I dip it into the egg.  As well, I didn't have breadcrumbs the last time, so I used crushed butter crackers & almonds and added some Italian seasoning to it before coating the chicken.  Wow!  Great recipe.  Will be making this one for years to come.

Honestly, this is a hearty filling dish but nothing too spectacular. I felt it was just sort of bland, boring and nothing to shout about. Probably won't make again, though it's relatively simple.

I really screwed this recipe up and it was still delicious. The chicken was awesome and my very picky baby could not get enough. I burnt the garlic, lost my basil, and forgot to buy breadcrumbs(had to make them myelf) and gave 3 baths in the middle of all of this and it was still delicious. In fact my husband hid some so he could take it to work. It was awesome even after all my disasters. This is a foul proof recipe and I will be making it again.

Excellent!  Sauteed sweet yellow, red and orange peppers with the garlic and also added 1cup of the tomato sauce to make more sauce.  I thought the amount of red pepper flakes was the perfect amount of spice.......I like spicy.  Oh......and also added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs to coat the chicken and it was delicious!  Thank you Brooklyn Girl!

This recipe is GREAT!  Love it!  We used a little more red pepper than it said and we will probably use more next time.  If you like spicy add more, if you don't use less.  Either way, this recipe ROCKS!  We will definitely be making it again and again!  Thanks!

This is so good and I followed it almost exactly.  I did use a whole can (8oz) of tomato sauce because I like a saucy dish.  I also used Panko bread crumbs, as previously suggested, and loved the chicken.  It also reheats well as leftovers.  Awesome-thanks for sharing!

OUTSTANDING! This is one of THE BEST Italian recipes that I've tried. However, if you prefer milder foods, decrease the amount of red pepepr flakes; this is packed with a lot of heat!

This is an amazing recipe. You will have to add more tomato sauce though, instead of 1/2 cup, add the whole can.

"This is 6 stars!!" said hubby.  Absolutely delicious and easy to make.  Hubby had chicken penne arrabiata at a well-known restaurant 2 days later and came back saying it was not even half as good as this recipe!  Found 1 egg and 1 cup breadcrumbs was enough and only added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (personal taste).  Thanks so much for a new regular in our house.

This is wonderful. I'll be making this often. Tons of flavor and zip. Great leftover also! Needed to cut back on the pepper a little for my family. 1 cup of bread crumbs and 1 egg is plenty. Many Thanks!

We tried it tonight and we give it a very positive four thumbs up (just two of us dining). I didn't read the cutlet part so I thinly cut up chicken breast strips. After frying, I cut them lengthways and then added to the sauce. We both loved it. If I were serving it to the kids, I might cut back on the red pepper flakes. But other than that... it was delicious and a nice alternative for the standard Italian dinner lasagna or spaghetti and meatballs. Next up, a carbonara dish! Thanks, Brooklyn Girl!

This recipe was perfect, spicy as is supposed to be next time I'll put a tad less red pepper flakes. I changed 1 thing instead of adding the chicken in for the breaking to get soggy with sauce I placed on top to cut up with meal while eating and added grated Parmesan and mozzarella on top and spinach leaves for a finishing look. Tasted fabulous!!! Definitely 5 stars.

This was a hit in my home. I didn't have tomato sauce and used 1/2 cup of pasta sauce instead. Came out great. Also, I sliced the raw chicken first then dredged and fried them. The combination zing in the sauce and fine coating of the chicken made this dish work. Loved it.

This is really spicy,and probably has too mush olive oil,but it is still really good if you cut back on the red pepper flakes.

This was the best recipe I've found on this site so far!!One of the only ones where I didn't make any real changes. Only thing I did was add dashes of oregano and then chili powder and paprika to the sauce.

We loved this recipe! My 6 year old doesn't like spicy, so I kept some chicken and pasta separate for her. The chicken alone was also great. It took me over an hour to make but was worth it! A keeper!

The flavor of the sauce is terrific! But after going through all the trouble to coat and fry the chicken, it just loses its coating and falls apart when you mix it into the sauce. It tasted good, but did not look appetizing.

I'd make the sauce again, and just brown italian sausage in place of the chicken.

My girls and I loved this!  My husband liked it, except for the chunky tomatoes. He doesn't like cooked tomatoes.  I used a little less than 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes because I was worried it would be too hot for my young kids.  However, it was not overly spicy and probably would have been fine with the full amount.  Very good!

Very good but I felt like this took so long to make for some reason! It's probably just me though!

I subbed the chili flakes for this arrabiata spice packet that I bought while I was in Italy.  Used 1 egg and maybe half a cup of italian breadcrumbs.  Left everything else the same.

It was good but the sauce seemed a bit watery to me.  I may have to thicken with tomato paste next time.

Loved this dish! Although next time I will cut back on the red pepper flakes. It was a bit too spicy for my family. The breaded chicken turned out awesome, which I left out of the pasta so it wouldn't get soggy. Great meal!

Great, simple, and fast recipe for cooks wanting to impress! Made this meal for my family and everyone went back for seconds and thirds. Served with a side salad, dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. Next time, the only adjustment would be to double the sauce. Also, I'd advise that if you're cooking for guests, use a conservative hand with the red pepper flakes... Might have too much of a kick for people with a sensitive pallet. Can't wait to make this again! Yum!

Amazing. The flavor is crazy and I loved it! I made it for my dad and he went insane, it was amazing! One tip, don't undercook the pasta because then it ruins the taste, but otherwise, great recipe!

I have been using this site for years and this is my first response.  This recipe was everything I had hoped it to be.  One of my favorite recipes at our local Italian restaurant.  This is a very close rendition only ingredient I added was hot peppers for added spice.  Will definitely be making this many more times.

LOVE this dish!! The only thing I did differently is use rotini noodles instead of penne. I used all natural and organic ingredients and it was fantastic. Now if I can teach my husband to say arrabiata instead of "spicy chicken and noodles", then we'll be in business. Haha!

This recipe has TONS of flavour. Followed the advice from other reviews, and sliced chicken breast before breading it so that all sides were crispy. Only used one egg, but needed almost the full 2 cups of bread crumbs because the chicken was sliced. Personally would not cut back on the pepper flakes, used the full amount as directed and it was just right with the rich garlic and tomato flavour. Served the chicken on the side to preserve crispiness - strongly reccomend that others do this as well! Will be making this one again for sure!

My husband and I loved it!  But like some of the other reviews I read, my 4 year old thought it was a little too spicy.  I loved the spice but would tone it down next time for my son.  I also needed to add a little more tomatoe sauce like other reviews suggested.  Will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is amazing!  I have 6 kids ranging from 2-18 and everyone LOVED it!  I even have kids that hate tomatoes and they raved over this dish.  I only used one tsp. of red pepper flakes specifically for the little ones, however, I made the recipe as is.

This was a wonderful recipe and everyone enjoyed it.  I made a couple of changes because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand.  I added spinach and use fresh tomatoes and spaghetti sauce.  It still came out delicious.  This is a keeper for me also.  Thanks Brooklyn Girl!

I thought it was delicious! I loved the fresh tasting sauce that coats the pasta and yet has enough delicious chunks of tomatoes to eat with the chicken. Awesome! Quick and easy. Will definitely make again. Followed the advice of other users and only used 1 egg and 1 cup of bread crumbs. It was plenty. Only thing I will do differently next time is add less pepper flakes to make more kid friendly. As is it was too spicy for my four year old...who enjoyed the initial flavor but not the spicy after kick. Hubs and I can add more pepper flakes at the table. :-) Also I used chicken tender cuts as they were on sale at the store. Chicken was done in less than 5 minutes. Will probably use that cut again if in a hurry. Worth a try!

Very good. Didn't mix he chicken in with the pasta because I didn't want it to get soggy so I served it on top. I also didn't pound it thin because I was in the mountains and didn't have a mallet. I just used breasts cut in half and it worked out great! This was very very good and I couldn't get my husband to stop eating it. Will definitely make this again!

This is a great, fast and easy recipe. The only changes I make to it are to add a little oregano and to use only 1 cup of breadcrumbs and 1 egg. 

Sometimes I double the sauce and keep it separate from the pasta and chicken. I then freeze it to use for a quick meal another night to save one step (though really, it's so easy to do all at once). 

I usually don't toss the chicken in the sauce, I just serve the pasta, top with some sauce, then put a couple strips of chicken on top of that. 

Delicious!

A life saver! I was looking for an easy sauce for my whole wheat penne, and found this recipe. I made it without chicken (it was meatless night at my house) and I didn't have basil but parsley. I also used heirloom tomatoes 22 ounces and 6 oz of tomato sauce. So few natural ingredients and lots of flavor. My 3 year old, and husband both had seconds! Will make again with. Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe, but I did make a few slight changes.  I cut the chicken in strips and flour them.  I sautee them in the pan with butter and olive oil.  Then I remove them from the pan, add a little white wine to deglaze and then some chopped pancetta for added flavor.  Delicious!

This was so good!  I added a bit more chicken than the recipe calls for so it's higher in protein.  I also added shallots because I had them on hand.  This dish was phenomenal.  My kids said this recipe was a keeper!  This made a lot with the extra chicken.  We've got enough for dinner tomorrow.  Yummy!!

I cut the chicken before frying. I used farfalle, as that's what I had. I didn't use any diced tomatoes, just sauce. and man, this is beyond incredible! It is full of flavor, and that is what I look for in my dishes. My taste buds are extremely happy :)

Yummmm!  I actually sauteed 1/2 a sweet onion and the required garlic in the olive oil - I only used 2-3 tbsp. of oil.  I didn't add the additional tomato sauce - just used my san marzano canned tomatoes with an additional bit of water.  I added just a small amount of oregano (1/2-1 tsp.), a pinch of brown sugar and a 1 and 1/2 tsp. of lemon juice.  I added grated fresh parmesan on top of the plated pasta and sauce.  I didn't make the chicken, but didn't miss it!

This was a quick, tasty, filling meal!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was I changed it and I can't very well give it 5 stars if I change it.  To save calories and time I didn't bothering breading then cooking the chicken.  Just diced chicken breast, partially cooked, made sauce and put chicken back in sauce to continue cooking while sauce simmered (it was tender and yummy).  Also, I added a bit of white wine to the sauce (just 'cause) and I didn't have fresh basil so used dried.  YUM!

This is dish Wonderful! I kept everything as is in this recipe. I did however cut the chicken up first before frying it and then left it out and just added it to the top at the end. My family really liked the crunchy texture of the fried chicken. My husband hates chicken but loved this dish. Thanks for sharing!

Although I tweaked it by adding more tomatoes and onions.
I didn't add the chicken and it still came out good!
Thank you for the great recipe!!!

This was really good and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it wasn't phenomenal.  A good dish for garlic lovers and if you end up with left overs it tastes even better the next day.  I did not add the cooked chicken to the sauce as the recipe said to do because I worried about it becoming soggy with the breading, but I think I should have.  I"ll make it again to try it just as the recipe states.

Excellent! Only changes were used italian bread crumbs since we were out of regular and pre-sliced the chicken before coating and cooking. Delicious with a nice heat!

Pretty tasty! Comfort food material for sure. I used plain diced tomatoes instead - don't think you really need the flavoured one. Will see a repeat for sure.

pretty darn good. I always add more garlic... And it seemed i simmered it for longer than twenty minutes because I was waiting for my fiance and a couple people to stop yapping ... Note that the longer you simmer red pepper flakes. the more the heat will come out of them.

This recipe is AWESOME. I came upon it on a whim after doing an Allrecipes search for ingredients I had on-hand. 

I did change a couple of things, however... I TRIPLED the amount of crushed red pepper because we like a little more than average "kick", and I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried flakes instead.

Also, I doubled the amount of garlic powder in the breading mixture.

All-in-all, this "accidental" meal was a HUGE hit with the family. Thank you Beth V. for the great recipe!

This was really good! A keeper for sure. I breaded and baked my chicken while preparing the rest. Then cut it up and placed it on top. Also used much less oil to saute garlic.

Easy & Delicious!  Not an ordinary chicken dish. We usually don't like red sauce, but this was great!  Did not have penne pasta so substituted wide noodles.  Used less olive oil to saute. Cut chicken breast in cubes, dipped in 2 eggs, but used only about 1 cup of the breadcrumb mixture.  Will make again!

Loved this! It was a very nice, and light dish compared to most other Italian dishes we've had. My husband and sister really liked it and it left us feeling the "right" kind of full. Like several other reviewers, I also cut back on the egg and breadcrumbs (too much of both in my opinion) and also cut the chicken before I fried it. Thanks for the meal, I will be making it more often as a dinner!

Great recipe. I made a few adjustments though. I baked the chicken for a healthier option. As well, I added spinach to the sauce. And I didn't have any red pepper flakes so I used Montreal Chicken Spice instead. It turned out great. Definitely one recipe I'm keeping as a regular.

This is one delicious dish !!! I did modify it a bit by using egg beaters instead of eggs, seasoned panko crumbs, and dried basil because there was no fresh basil at the market - I didn't add a ton of basil, probably about a tablespoon. I also added a pinch of sugar to the sauce, and used no-salt tomato sauce (I used an 8 ox can)   since I felt there was plenty of salt in the an of diced tomatoes. I simmered the sauce for about 40 mins to incorporate the flavors. I left the salt out of the panko crumb mixture also. This was awesome and definitely a keeper. TYSM Brooklyn Girl !

I made 3 servings which was enough for 4.  I cut back a bit on the oil, probably by 1/2.  Since I made 3 servings, I made 3 thin cut chicken breasts which was too much for me because I only used 1 breast.  I guess it's a personal preference, don't like a lot of meat in my pasta.  Added another tsp of red pepper flakes to kick up the spice, which really wasn't that spicy (4 on a scale of 10).  Love this dish!

This dish is wonderful and extremely flavorful.  I would recommend adding an extra can of the diced tomatoes, because the amount of left-over pasta seemed a little dry.  We used Parmesan bread crumbs from Progresso and that made all the difference in the world.  I would highly recommend this dish!

I'm giving this one 4 stars just because it wasn't quite thick enough for me.  I made this recipe by the directions except for the chicken.  I just breaded chicken breasts with Italian seasoned bread crumbs and an egg and baked them at 400 for 30 mins.  They were great and my guests could cut and add to the pasta as they liked.  The sauce was thin even with just the pasta and would have been really too thin with the chicken added in.  I added some parmesan cheese to melt after adding the pasta and that helped somewhat with the thickness.  Maybe another 1/2 can or so of tomatoes DRAINED would help along with some tomato paste to thicken it up.  Otherwise the flavor was good.

my husband's favorite food is pasta w/marinara sauce and he says this is the best pasta he's ever had! (and his mother is italian - and she has also asked for this recipe!). I added chopped zucchini & onion to the sauce so it had some veggies & I always use whole wheat pasta. I also just used Italian bread crumbs instead of flavoring plain ones. I also add a bit of lemon juice to the chicken while it's cooking for a little zest.

So good! I didn't have the canned tomatoes, so I first chopped fresh ones and drizzled olive oil and added chopped garlic and let them site whie I prepped the rest. I also added 1/4 tsp. onion powder to the crumb mix. Love the spicyness! I used orrichiete pasta. Will definitely add this to my regular rotation.

This was delicious. I made this tonight and paired it with American Gewurtztraminer wine. As with most recipes, I did double most of the spices.

I made this for my husband last night who said it was good. This morning he had a couple bites for breakfast and took it with him for lunch. This time he said it was awesome. It sounds like it may taste better if it sits for a bit. I did cut the pieces of chicken up small and then breaded them with that. I agree with another person that you don't need two cups of bread crumbs. One and a half would probably be good. Also, we mixed our chicken in the sauce, but had I ate it by myself I would have just set them on top. They became a little soggy, but hey, some people like that. One other thing is that we threw in some parmesan cheese and I used two 14 oz cans of regular diced tomatoes and a 8 oz can of tomato paste since that is what I had. Then I added water, extra basil, some oregano, and some extra garlic powder to the sauce.

Not sure why anyone would give this anything less than 5 stars. It was oh so good! I did as suggested by others and cut the chicken into strips before I breaded and fried them - though it would be easier, and it was. This is a KEEPER!

Wonderful dinner!  Even my 3 yr/o and 4 yr/o ate it all up.  It was a great family meal.  It isn't too often I find something the whole family likes.  This is a keeper!!!  I did read some comments before making it and I used only one egg and that was plenty like one other said.

Good recipe! Followed it to a T - only adding some fresh parsley as I had it right there. Tastes like something you would get at a restaurant. Next time, I will probably leave the chicken out of the sauce. :)

I cannot say enough about how incredible and flavorful this dish is. Easily THE best recipe on All Recipes.  I had a lot of bread crumb mixture left so will use half next time. No other changes. Can't believe I've lived 42 years without having something this delicious!

A little too spicy for my family's taste. But the chicken was delicious (use only 1 egg) and the sauce was good, minus the heat. Just use less red pepper flakes.

Just wanted to put in my 2 cents worth about the sauce--made it tonight for dinner and it was delicious! Great balance in flavors and spices. Only small addition I made was to add about a half tablespoon of sugar to the sauce as I like my spaghetti/marinara sauce a little sweeter than not. Try the sauce-you'll love it.

This recipe was so easy and so yummy! Although I loved the heat from the red peppers it was a bit too much for my 4 year old and 1 year old. Next time we will reduce it for their benefit, but otherwise this was a great yummy recipe.

I just wasn't a huge fan of this.  I was really expecting something spectacular and it just wasn't that.  I'm sorry.   I love spicy things but it was actually a bit too spicy for this recipe.   I still appreciate the recipe though.  Always nice to try new things.

Tastes like a restaurant arrabiata pasta dish! My teenagers (mom's guinea pigs) loved this but requested a variation for next time. They wanted me to top it with the chicken, maybe just grilled rather than breaded or maybe italian sausage.

We tried this exactly as written, with the one exception being I sliced the chicken before frying, and it is fantastic! Just the right amount of heat/spicyness, and minimal prep work!

Excellent - a KEEPER! I tweaked a bit as suggested by others (more sauce, cut chicken before frying). Next time will try adding an add'l small can of diced tomato (this time I added about a cup of leftover jar sauce, and made a little less penne. Still slightly too hot for me, but my husband loved it). I used 2 large eggs and had leftover egg, probably 2 medium eggs would work. Used 1/2 cup less breadcrumbs, still had leftover. Thanks Brooklyn Girl!

Great taste with a kick which my family likes.  Instead of cutlets, I used chicken tenderloins(which I had on hand) and followed the recipe from there.  Yummy!

This was really good, thanks for posting. My friends mom used to make this all the time when we were growing up. (In Brooklyn too ;) I also used all fresh tomatoes, skinned and seeded. So simple and so good.

Just like our favorite Italian restaurant! I used fresh tomatoes in place of half of the canned tomatoes---makes all the difference and gives it that restaurant quality that brings rave reviews from the family.  Fresh basil is a must also.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I know I will be making  it a lot.  I used dried basil but will try to get fresh the next time.  Had no egg, so I  padded dry the thin chicken slices, sprayed oil on them , then coated with seasoned bread crumbs. Didn't miss the egg.  After sauteing, I sliced them crosswise and laid them over the pasta and sauce.  Wonderful presentation.  Will be better with the fresh basil to sprinkle over.  My husband and I kept raving about how great it all tasted. I will never use bottled sauce again. This was a breeze to make and the taste was incredible.  Can't wait to make it again.

Just fine! Left the sauce ingredients all the same, except added a tbsp of chicken soup base (Watkins) for balance over the tomato taste. For breading, used egg coating and Shake 'N Bake. Worked just fine. I used boneless, skinless thighs instead of breast meat, because we all prefer dark meat, and left them in large bite-size pieces.  Everyone praised it as different and very good.  Will keep the recipe handy.

I made this pretty close to how the recipe was written (lots of times I add or subtract ingredients according to my own preferences). I did not bread the chicken, as I was trying to keep this pretty healthy. We thought it was really tasty. Next time, I think I would add another can of tomatoes. Usually I would much rather have fresh tomatoes and stay away from canned, but not this time. They gave the sauce good flavor and texture. I will probably make this again sometime.

Very, very good. This to me is like a dish you'd get at a great Italian restaurant. Loved it and didn't change a thing. Make sure you don't skimp on the fresh garlic! 6 sounds like alot if you're not a garlic lover but it makes the dish.

What a great recipe for a night when I had NO idea what I was going to make!  This calls for basic pantry staples, is quick and easy, and tastes great!  I only had a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes, so I doubled the tomato sauce and added some oregano.  Eve with only one can of diced tomatoes, it had great texture and flavor!  My husband is very particular about his pasta sauce, and this was a hit with him.  This recipe is definitely being added to my recipe box for future use.

OK.  As a fellow girl from Canarsie Brooklyn, I have to say that this recipe is a great representation of Italian cooking from Canarsie Brooklyn.  As a child, I too learned how to make Italian food.  This recipe is spectacular though because it is simple and most importantly, quick!  Very tasty and very delicious.  The only thing I have to say is DOUBLE THE RECIPE.  It will be a huge success.  I like to provide parmesan cheese.  It doesn't really need it but it's a nice touch.

This is a simple but great recipe that I use. Not every time I dip the chicken in the egg & bread crumbs, since sometimes I don't want the crispiness! Works either way. I did put sausage & shimp to this recipe which was sort of like a jambalaya! Switch it up & get a little crazy.

Very good. A bit spicy.  But beware.  You must have at least three good burners to do this. It's all stovetop. You need a pasta pot, and two saute deep pans, one for sauce, one for chicken. Personally, my stovetop has one good burner, the other three are not as hot OR BIG. It was a geographical nightmare.. moving pots around. DEFINITELY cut in half the bread crumb mixture and egg.  What a waste.

I liked it, and my guests seemed to like it, but it wasn't the best pasta sauce I've ever had.  I did enjoy snacking on the chicken, though, as it came out of the olive oil.

I tried this recipe a few times and with some minor short cuts its five stars!  Cut the chicken into strips before breading and browning and add to the pasta before simmering. A new family favorite.

This was excellent!  I just moved from Italy, and was missing my favorite dish, penne arrabiata.  This recipe was just like the home made pasta sauce from the Italian trattorias we ate at in Vicenza.  Thank you so much for posting this!

Another winner in the McLean home!! Gang loved this one and like my bff Taylor, I too deglazed my pan with wine, however using a Cab as that was all I had in the house. Spice was perfect and so was the dish. Thank you so much for a relatively quick and very easy recipe!

OMG...this is soooooooooo good!  We absolutely loved it.  Didnt change a thing except for I didn't put the fried chicken in the sauce to cook for 10 minutes.  I dont see the reasoning of frying it and then soaking it in the sauce to make it soggy.  Plus the leftovers probably would have not been good like that.  GREAT recipe though!

this was really good.  i think the addition of the red pepper flakes made this more than just a chicken parmesan pasta dish.  i only used 3/4 t red pepper flakes and used 2 large chicken breast thin sliced.  i did not cut them smaller before adding them to the sauce.  i also sliced two large zucchini and added it to the sauce and simmered it for the full time.  the zucchini soaked up the flavors so well.  i also added a sprinkle of mozerella cheese onto the prepared bowl of pasta.  so yummy.  next time i may add parmesan cheese in with the bread crumb mixture.  thanks!

Great!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used only one egg and one cup of breadcrumbs, and that was more than enough.  I couldn't find canned diced tomatoes with garlic and olive oil so I used canned diced tomatoes with oregano, basil, and garlic.  I also added a little oregano to the sauce to give it a little more Italian flavor.  Definitely a little spicy, but my boyfriend loved it and I was able to handle the heat.  Made for great leftovers, too!  This took me well over an hour to make, but it was worth it.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was a little too spicey for my liking so I will add less crushed red pepper flakes next time. But other than that it was great! The chicken was very tasty and juicey as well, I served it on top of the pasta instead of mixed in with the sauce because I wanted the bread crumbs to remain intact and crispy. Delicious!!!

This was really good. I was looking for something different to serve with the ingredients I had on hand and found this. Since I didn't have chicken tenders, I simply cut 2 skinless chicken breasts into strips, breaded them and fried them up. (I had way more chicken than I needed.) I did season my bread crumbs with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper and some italian seasoning. I think I just found a new chicken finger recipe! My daughter loved it!

My sauce turned out somewhat tart, but I am attributing that to the tomato sauce I used.  Next time I will taste the sauce and add a pinch of sugar if it is needed.  The breading on the chicken is absolutely to die for.  I used chicken tenders, and instead of cooking them in oil on the stove top, I baked them at 350 for about 16 minutes (be careful not to overcook!).  This way they don't pick up all the fat, but they are still tender and moist. A really great dish!

My husband, a friend, and I all loved this dish (friend said he was very impressed and thought it was restaurant-quality). I followed the directions exactly, tho I had to use dried basil leaves instead of fresh. I definitely used both eggs, but nowhere near 2 cups of bread crumbs... I feel 1 or maybe 1 1/3 would be plenty. The only other thing keeping me from giving it a 5-star rating is that it took me about an hour to make (start to finish), and that's a long time in the end.

When I first tasted this, I thought it was an average pasta dish, but as I continued eating it, I realized that this was actually a five star dish!  I usually just use regular canned tomatoes even when the recipe calls for a special kind (garlic and olive oil tomatoes, in this case), but this time I decided to go with the recipe and I believe it made a significant difference. Yum! Thank you!

I used ground pork sausage instead of the chicken. I will continue to make this recipe as my family LOVED it! I will stick with the beef or pork and use a 14oz can of tomoatoes next time. Very easy and very tasty!

I give this one 4 1/2 stars, it was really good.  Those girls in Brooklyn can really cook!  I made it for my 4th of July party and it was a hit.  I made it without the chicken, because I was grilling so many meats, I thought we needed something without meat.  This definitely hit the spot, all my guests loved it. Nice easy recipe that I will be making again.

This was VERY good! I didn't have red pepper flakes on hand, which is fine because I didn't want anything spicy. I also used pizza sauce instead of pasta sauce, and that worked well too!
If you don't have a box of bread crumbs, you can simply toast a slice of bread and break it apart into crumbs, works great. This is an amazing recipe, I will definitely make it a lot. :)

Very good! My Italian husband liked it a lot. I only had a small can of diced tomatoes (14.5 oz) so I used a whole can of tomato sauce. I served the chicken on top like others suggested. Will definitly make again.

Delicious! Best pasta dish that I've had in a long time.

Modifications - I took the advice of some others and served the chicken on top of the pasta rather than mixing it in; this made it nice and crispy.  I used chicken breasts instead of cutlets since that's what I had on hand, and butterflied them so that they would be thin enough to cook through during frying.  Finally, I used Italian-seasoned bread crumbs to add a little extra flavor, and it worked wonderfully.

This was pretty good. I think I'll cut back on the tomatoes next time.  I took the advice of another reviewer and added the chicken at the very last minute and it helped lessen the sogginess.

Very good!  Followed directions for sauce except decreased red pepper to appeal to my 2 yr old.  Instead of cooking the chicken, I added roasted chicken to the sauce - easy!

I breaded the chicken and baked it.  The only other changes were reduced the amount of red pepper (still a bit spicy for me but the guys loved it) and onion and mushrooms.  Very good and very easy.  Great quick weeknight meal.

I love this recipie. Just enough spicy. I made it first with the chicken, then again later w/ beef sausage (lightly browned) because that's what I had, and my family loved it even more! YUM.

Made this tonight & loved it! It was easy to make. I did substitute dried basil because I didn't have fresh in. I also used the whole can of tomato sauce to prevent waste. I served the chicken sliced on top of the pasta & sprinkled it with some fresh parmesan on top. Yummy!!

This was wonderful, and probably would have been even better if I had used fresh basil instead of dried, but I was out of fresh basil, as the recipe calls for.  The chicken was so good before I added it to the tomato sauce that I almost stopped right there.  Fantastic!!

This dish was amazing! I made it for my hubby and an Italian friend of his who stopped by and we were all wowed! It is the kind of dish you would expect to get at a really great neighborhood Italian restaurant!I did not add the chicken to the sauce as I wanted it to stay crispy so I just tossed the sliced cutlets in just before serving. Also I did use fresh garlic and basil which I am sure took this from good to Great status! To those that don't keep fresh basil in the house you can also buy freeze dried basil which my local market sells in a jar found near the fresh basil in the produce section.It keeps in the refrigerator and is a good as fresh once it hits liquid. This will definitely be in my recipe rotation and is destined to be an all time fave!

****1/2.  Made with linguine pasta.  Used diced tomatoes and added extra olive oil and garlic.  Used full can of tomato sauce.  Sauce was thin, but maybe pasta not drained well.  Used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  Good flavor.

This is an AWESOME recipe.  I have a house full of picky eaters and they all love it.  I have tried this recipe twice, the only thing I changed is to reduce the amount of garlic by half.  Would recommend to anyone.

I found this recipe pretty tasty.  I only used one tablespoon of oil to fry the garlic and three tablespoons for the chicken.  I am not a fan of fried food in sauce, but I wanted to keep with the spirit of the recipe so I just cooked the chicken thoroughly in a separate pan and drizzled the sauce over the noodles after it was prepared.  It was all very good.  The only notable things are the quantity of bread crumbs and egg.  I only wound up using about 1/2 the egg and probably less than 1/2c of crumbs.  That means that I unfortunately wasted a cup and a half of bread crumbs.  :(  I will make this again though with those adjustments.

This recipe was exceptional.  I halved it as I only had half the amount of diced tomatoes, and it was plenty of food.  In fact, I don't think I could have fit it all in my pan if I hadn't done so.  I also cut the chicken before I breaded it.  Other than that my only change was to skip the step of simmering the chicken in the sauce.  I was worried it would get soggy so I just mixed it in.

In any case, so tasty and easy enough for an amateur like me!  I will make this again soon.

Very tasty, easy to make, and all ingredients are ones I typically have on hand.  Only used 1 cup bread crumbs and 1 egg, and cut the chicken up before breading and frying.  1 tsp crushed red pepper makes it nice and spicy, so if you want less heat, decrease a bit. My husband exclaimed, "This is a keeper!" THREE times while eating (a record, I believe) so I know we'll be eating this again!

This dish was very spicy!  I used red pepper flakes and that is probably what took it over the top in the spiciness factor.  Like others, I would also suggest using less breadcrumbs than called for in the recipe - otherwise you will end up with a lot of waste.  1 cup is probably appropriate with the 4 serving size.

very tasty and so simple! I'll definitely do this dish again, the contrast between the crunchy, crispy chicken and the soft, saucy pasta is fantastic!

Delicious, easy meal!  Even my family's pickiest eater (me) loved it.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to use only one cup of breadcrumbs (still threw alot of them away), and slightly less oil than what was called for.

I would prob have given it a 4, but my boyfriend insisted it was a 3 star recipe. I started by making it as Brooklyn Girl suggested with half the red pepper and half the garlic figuring I could add as needed. Just with half the calling I thought the spice totally overpowered the dish. I didn't taste pasta, sauce, chicken - I only tasted the garlic and red pepper. I then added zucchini, yellow squash, mozzerella, turkey bacon... this made the dish more interesting - but it was still too powerful - you couldnt taste the ingredients besides spice. With that said, we both finished our plates and took leftovers to work today- so I guess it was OK afterall. Probably will not make again. But thanks for the recipe, it did seem to be an authentic Italian dish.

Excellent!  Made a few changes to add a little more kick.  We used cayenne pepper instead of crushed red pepper.  We also added fresh parmesean cheese to the bread crumbs and only used one egg.

Delicious! Everyone loved it! The only change I made was using a whole cup of tomato sauce and mashing the diced tomatoes some after the simmering b/c my husband and son don't like too many chunks.

Awesome recipe!  We were short a couple of the ingredients, so we just substituted and hoped for the best.  It turned out terrific!  Also we took the advice of a previous review and kept the chicken seperate until dinner was served in order to keep the breading crispy.  The crushed red pepper added the perfect amount of flavor and spice!

Just made this meal for the first time tonight, and the family LOVED it!!!  My husband and 10 year old son both had seconds.  My husband said it was like you would find in a good Italian restaurant.  I thought it was delicious as well.  Of course, we love spicy dishes, so this was right up our alley.  If you don't like spicy, cut back on the red pepper.

Before reading the other reviews, I had begun to think that I did something wrong.  And I couldn't figure out what.  This was absolutely delicious.  I was just very surpised when #1, I had to put 4 servings into my huge stock pot so that it would fit, and #2, That there was not enough sauce for all that it made.  Hence, the 4 and not 5 stars.  AS WRITTEN.  However, by increasing the sauce to full can and decreasing the amount of pasta by about 4 oz, you get the perfect combination that I would give a 5 star rating to.  More if possible.

Excellent recipe.  I struggled as I didn't have pots that were quite big enough so the pasta got squished and broken! :( But still very very tasty.  Thought it made about 6 servings (not 4). Next time I will halve it.  Like others I used a whole bottle of pasta sauce and the amount of sauce was just right for me.  Warning, you must be a garlic lover to truely enjoy this dish!

Very,very good. Authentic Italian tasting dish. Easy to make and the next day taste is even better. The zing of the red pepper flakes is just the right amount. My 11 year old son deemed it perfect. This is one of those dishes that you have elsewhere and wish you could make at home.

Great recipe. Baked chicken in oven instead of frying. Also used a bit less pasta and an entire 15 ounce can of tomato sauce. Try using the fresh basil if you can. I will be keeping this one in my collection.

This was WONDERFUL- my husband said that it was quite possibly one of the best dishes I have ever made!  A few small changes- I used dried basil, about half of the red pepper, and I cubed the chicken, tossed it in the bread crumb mix, and then baked it in the oven at 375 for 30 minutes.  I ladled the sauce over the penne pasta, topped it with the baked chicken, and sprinkled shredded italian cheese over all.  It was scrumptious!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was very easy to make, but it was also quite plain. I followed it exactly including the tomatoes in olive oil & garlic, but I used far more crushed red pepper than a tsp and it still wasn't very spicy. I probably won't be making this one again.

Great recipe!  I dredged the chicken in flour instead of using bread crumbs and added a 15 ounce can of tomato sauce.  I disagree that this recipe is too spicy. I actually added more crushed red pepper than was called for.  Great dish!

I am giving this 5 stars because if I had all the ingredients this would have came out excellent! My husband is Italian and is from Queens, so we always have tomato sauce in our home. Well, all we had this time was Ragu, which was giving to use a year ago and we never used. The Ragu made it way to sweet and over-powered the garlic. Please, please, please make sure you use regular tomato sauce!! I will definitely make this again with the right ingredients!!!!

Wow!!! So delicious! I wasn't sure I was going to like this recipe, as it calls for quite a bit of oil, but I'm glad to say I was wrong!  This was great!  I made it for Valentine's day dinner and it was a big hit with me and my hubby.  Great heated up the next day too.  I served the sauce/chicken mixture over the pasta instead of mixing the pasta in, as I had no room in the pan, and used dried chili peppers instead of red pepper flakes (didn't have any), but that was the only change I made.  Wonderful, extraordinary recipe!!! Well done Brooklyn Girl!!

Well we thought this was fantastic.  I made only two small variations, added one cup of tomato sauce as we like a bit more sauce, and did not add the pepper flakes as I wanted to keep it child-friendly. This one is definitely a keeper!!  Thanks Brooklyn Girl. :)

I made this dish last night and it was a hit.. A new family favorite!! The flavors all meld together beautifuuly makes a wonderful hearty and zesty dish perfect for a winter meal. I coupled this dish with grilled bread and Brushetta Pomodoro to start.
I recomend that if you try this recipe you start cooking your chicken breasts before you start the sauce because when I prepared the dish my sauce was done way before the chicken was finished.

Fan-tastic. For all who don't like spicy food, don't make arrabiata... that's what it is: spicy. Anyway, I thought this was amazing. I added red bell pepper, red onion, zucchini, and the called-for sauce (used 8oz) to the garlic/oil mix.. turned out great. Also added a bit of tomato paste to the tomato mix. Some complained that there wasn't enough sauce but I love a lot of sauce and thought there was just the right amount. Only advice is to use good chicken... I pounded 2 chicken breasts flat before cooking (also used only 1 egg and 1 c. bread crumbs.. plenty) and they turned out amazingly well. Will absolutely be making this again.

I thought the recipe was very good and very fresh.  I got scared by some of the other posters and reduced the red pepper flakes, and I wish I didn't...it really needs that spice for flabor.  Also, I recommend simmering for more than 20 minutes to reduce the possible bitterness of the tomatoes...great dish though!

I made this recipe with a few changes.  I added some chopped green pepper and sliced mushrooms.  I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I also added a couple tablespoons of dark brown sugar to the sauce.  My husband loved it, and the leftovers were even better.

Followed directions exactly but thought that it lacked flavor and also thought it was not very spicy.  My family enjoyed but they added a ton of cheese to it.  Probably would not make again due to the amount of work & lack of flavor, but that is my families preference.  That is the great thing about this site, everyone has their own food preference and can rate their food choices.  Thanks

Not too bad at all although the next time I make this I'll either double the sauce or halve the pasta.When I first tasted this,I wasn't that impressed.But after letting it sit for a day the flavors start to develop more.

This was very good. I used chicken cutlets and pounded them until they were really thin and used one egg and panko japanese bread crumbs. I did have to use about 1.5 cups of breadcrumbs for my cutlets. I should have taken others recommendations and reduced the amount of red peper flakes from 1 tsp to about 1/2 tsp or even 1/4. My husband and I loved this dish but it was a tad too spicey for my 21 month old daughter.  Will definitely make this again. Thanks Brooklyn Girl!

I made this last night & my family really liked it. Like the previous reviews 1 egg & 1 cup of breadcrumbs was plenty. This was an easy midweek meal & a nice change from the normal spaghetti bolognaise we have!!

This was absolutely delicious and simple to make! I wouldn't change a thing! It's a great Italian dish for my boyfriend, who can't eat dairy. It's rare that I find a delicious Italian meal that doesn't include cheese!

EXCELLANT!  This is my favorite dish at a local restaruant, now I can make it at home!!!  I would use less red peppers next time, just a little too spicy, and less oil.  But I will definately be making this alot!!! Thanks!!!

This recipe was delicious!  Husband and kids loved it too, and they don't usually like to try new things.  I added some green and red pepper.  Thought about adding some sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and yellow peppers too next time.  I cooked the chicken very crispy, sliced in thin slices on top.  This dish looked beautiful and tasted great.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was really good.  I cut down on the red pepper flakes, added more tomato sauce, and used half the amount of eggs and bread crumbs.

I've been wanting to try this recipe and finally did so today.  In a word, Delicious!  Lots of flavor bursting forth in each bite.  My wife loved it so much so that she's going to make it for her Bunco Party in a couple of weeks.  Good cooler weather dish.  If you're wanting a great Italian dinner, make Penne Arrabiata!

Very delicious! I agree with other reviewer's, serve the chicken on top. I also added a half package of cream cheese to make it creamier and to tune down the spice a bit for my 2 year old. I'll omit the red pepper flakes next time.

I didnt put the chicken in.  I served it on top so the chicken was still crispy.  I loved this recipe and my husband and 6 year old loved it too.  I might cut back on the pepper flakes next time as it was too spicy for my son.

This is so delicious! I agree with other reviewers in  that you don’t need as many bread crumbs or egg as is called for. Other then that I follow it exactly. I’ve made it several times, it’s probably my favorite recipes out of all my saved AllRecipe(s)!

Pretty awesome! Made the recipe as is and it's packed with flavor. Might cut back on the red pepper flakes next time, as they tend to dominate the flavor profile.

I cut the recipe in half, and I stopped at a different store on the way home..... they didn't have fresh basil, so I used a tube thingy of basil, and threw in a few fresh, diced mushrooms from the fridge as well as more garlic and red pepper flakes ....those were the bulk of the changes, other than a bit less EVOO.  I simmered the sauce longer so I had to add a bit of chicken broth and a splash of Marsala to thin it out. Also...I had spicy bread crumbs, they rock. The BF likes it hot, so this hit the spot! Will definitely do again!

We liked this dish, but for some reason, didn't have enough sauce for the amount of pasta, although I used the amounts specified. I would use more tomato sauce next time. 

Fresh basil is unfortunately, out of season now, so I added pesto instead. I'm sure it affected the flavor, but it was still good.

Great sauce! I didn’t measure the red pepper flakes which  made it slightly too hot so keep an eye on that. This recipe is excellent, easy and quick. I will be making this again some day soon!

I listened to a tip from another reviewer, and cooked them on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet. My dad has heart problems and doesn’t need it to be sitting cooking in the grease. This is definitely a healthier way to cook them. My family ate them up and loved every bite. My 4 year old couldn’t get enough.

Only modifications are I only used 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes because my wife can't handle the spice.

Made it and loved it. I used a blackening spice on the chicken and grilled it.  Also used bow tie pasta.  Sauce had a little kick but I like that.  My husband loved this one too.  We will definitely make this again!

My husband (who grew up in New York with an Italian mom and grandmother) could not stop raving about this dish.  He repeatedly asked if I saved the recipe. Since he is the chef in our family, I was very happy with his response. My one alteration,  which was quite by mistake, was that I did not divide the olive oil originally. When I realized what I had done, I used a flat spoon to collect the excess oil from the sauce and used it to fry the chicken. It was the perfect combination of sauce and heat. We will definitely do this one again!

This dish was amazing! I would strongly suggest everyone try this as you will not be disappointed. I had some timing issues with the penne, sauce, and chicken being done at the same do to chicken prep time. So if you are like me an insist on doing steps in order prep the chicken first!

This was delicious - a huge hit with the entire family!  The only adjustment I made was the use half as much red pepper flakes compared to what was recommended. It still packed a nice amount of heat, and those who wanted more could add it at the end to their own dish. Oh, and we also took the advice of other reviewers by adding more garlic and keeping the chicken out of the sauce, which kept it nice and crispy. But seriously... the flavors of the chicken, the sauce... this entire dish was all divine. Will certainly make this one again!

This was SO delicious! I added a bottle of garlic and onion marinara, and threw in extra garlic powder. We had extra chicken strips, so saved them back, and the kids had chicken fingers for lunch. This will definitely be a keeper!!

Delicious!!!!! The only adjustments I made to this recipe were adding more tomato sauce because I wanted it a little more saucy and I laid the chicken on top of the noodles and sauce instead of mixing it in to keep its crispness.

I made some. changes. I used tomato puree with additional  half tablespoon of crushed garlic, used red chilly powder instead of chilly flakes as I didn't have them handy. I diced and marinated chicken cubes beforehand  with one and a half tablespoon of crushed garlic, half teaspoon of chilly powder (paprika) , half teaspoon of pepper and salt. Then reduced paprika, pepper and salt in the bread crumbs. Marination for half an hour made the spices getting absorbed inside the chicken which gave it additional flavour. Didn't put any garlic powder in the bread crumbs.  It was delicious!! Better than the restaurent. Definitely a keeper!!

Absolutely delicious! I made this last night and pretty much followed the recipe exactly. The only things I changed was I used pasta sauce (marinara) instead of plain tomato sauce. I also put the finished dish into a large oven safe casserole dish, covered in an italian mix shredded cheese and baked for about 10 minutes until the cheese had melted and the top was sizzling. I served it with some homemade garlic bread and a dollop of sour cream on top of the pasta. And of course a sprig of garnishment. The result was amazing!! My partner and I had two big servings, and we still have a lot of leftovers. This is probably one of the best recipes I have tried from AllRecipes.com and I definately recommend it to anyone who likes italian food or past! I wrote down the recipe and added it to my "Favorite Recipes Box" here at home!

Very good. Followed the other reviewers and used 1 egg and less breadcrumbs.  I added shredded cheese on top after it was done cooking.

I've made this twice. Once as posted except half of the pepper flakes. The second time, I halved the pepper flakes and used 4 chorizo sausages instead of the chicken. I grilled the sausages and sliced them. Both times it was delicious

Very nice. Spicy, garlicy, tomatoey with crusty moist chicken.  Made it two times and loved it. The portions are not completely right. Tomato sauce (note, not the chicken) was enough only for 2 people. I think serving 6 people, not really, more like 4. Unless you have many side dishes. Tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes can be replaced by simply tomato sauce alone if you want to be easy, still good tasting. I recommend serving this with cucumbers in yoghurt or sour cream, or any fresh cold salad. And cutting the spaghetti afer cooking otherwise it's hard to stir into the sauce.

Even our 6 year old loved this. I didn't think it was too much olive oil as other reviews stated. Wrong time of the year to have fresh basil, so I used dried.  I did cut back on the egg and bread crumbs because I didn't have a full pound of chicken. I also cut the chicken into smaller portions before breading. Used fusilli bucati corti pasta because it was in the pantry, and it was perfect.

I made the sauce only, not the chicken.  This is a very easy and quick recipe, and it tasted really good.  I did find it to be a little too "liquidy"; I had to use a slotted spoon to scoop it up onto my pasta so that my pasta wasn't swimming in tomato juice.  (Oh, and I added extra chili flakes, as my husband and I love spicy food.)  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent flavor. I used panko bread crumbs instead of traditional italian and mini penne. My whole family loved it. My picky husband even took leftovers to work the next day, something he never does.

Tastes so fresh! This is a great recipe and I've put it in our regular rotation of meals. It tastes fresh, even though you use canned tomatoes. I'm not sure it's really necessary to bread the chicken because I haven't been very successful with that; the breading just seems to come off when I put the chicken in the sauce. Still, the taste is wonderful. Don't skip the fresh basil; it makes all the difference.

This is delicious. The whole family loves it. I added sliced mushrooms and diced onions to the garlic. I also used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 6 because I thought 6 would be to strong.  I also added some parsley for color.  I will definitely be making this again.

We loved this recipe. While it is a bit heavy, it is definitely one of the best pasta recipes on Allrecipe. I cut the chicken into strips before coating it and added a bit more garlic.

I LOVE this dish. I substituted diced tomatoes with finely chopped tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, i liked it even better because I could fit more in my mouth. Haha. Wife loved it as well. My favorite pasta dish ever.

this was the first time I made sauce from scratch and it came out perfect!  I doubled the recipe since I like leftovers and even my kids loved it!  I used minced garlic instead of the cloves and I probably should have cut down on the red pepper because my kids said it was spicy but overall I'll definitely make this again!!

Thank you so much for this recipe. It is absolutely delicious! I almost didn't prepare it bc I loathe garlic but it's actually good and not too over powered. I added green onions to mine and did as others suggested with only using 1cup of bread crumbs in lieu of using 2 cups. I didn't have grated parmesan cheese so I used the seasoned kraft Sun-dried tomato and basil parmesan cheese.

This recipe is delicious. I have made it several times and I love it.  We always had chicken cutlets pretty much every week growing up and it is so nice to be able to use them like this and have a delicious pasta dinner.  From a Queens girl to a Brooklyn girl...thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was pretty dang good! i cooked for my parents, and they don't really like spicy, so i took about a quarter of it out and made it more bland  with a small can of tomato paste and water. The pepper flakes make it zippy, they still thought there was a slight zip to it. I on the other hand, love spicy and really enjoyed this recipe! Made it with homemade bread sticks,  and my boyfriend likes me a little bit more now I think! Everyone loved the chicken! i may use it for just making breaded chicken from now on.

This recipe looked so good , I couldn't wait to make it.  I made it exactly like written, which I always try to do, but I did not have fresh basil I had to use dried, but everything else was the same.  I'm sorry to say my family couldn't eat it the red pepper was too hot I would not put so much red pepper.  There is no need for 2 cups of bread crumbs. Maybe I would make it again with half red pepper.

A big hit with the family! All I heard was how amazing the smell was and once they sat down for dinner, every single one said it was one of the best pasta dinners they have had! The flavor was amazing! I doubled the recipe so we can take some for lunch! Thank you for the recipe and this one will be in my go to for dinner recipes!

This dish was super delicious.  I doubled the recipe so that everyone would have leftovers for lunch, and I'm glad I did.  The only deviation I made was to use chicken tenderloins.  Yes, the pepper flakes pack a punch, but they really work in this recipe.  If you're sensitive to a little heat, just cut the pepper flakes in half.  I'm glad I used what it called for.  Although the recipe was a little time intensive (just because of the chicken), it was relatively easy.  I also found that I had enough time in between the stages to do some cleanup.  Way to go, Beth -- I will make again!

At first glance this didn't sound like anything extraordinary. I wanted to use some of my own frozen tomatoes and thought this looked easy enough.  OMG, it may have been the abundance of garlic but as the sauce cooked my house smelled divine.  The breaded chicken a treat that I'm sure was even more appealing to my kids as they were probably thinking chicken nuggets.    It was one of the best tasting dishes I think I've ever made (really!).  I followed the recipe as is using my own tomatoes that I had blanched/frozen.  I followed one persons suggestion to cut chicken before breading and cooking.  However, I don't know that I'd do that next time simply because it took a long time but probably did provide a more fully breaded piece of chicken.  Some of the breading came off in the sauce as I stirred that in but it seemed to just make the sauce a little more hearty and the chicken was still coated well enough.  
I also used one egg and one cup of breadcrumbs as suggested by others.  Still more than enough for the chicken I had.
Play with the red pepper - sometimes I've used too much but that's personal preference.  For a family of 4 we had at least 2 nights of meals.  Lots of pasta which I had a difficult time stirring in without overflowing my pan.
Seriously, use lots of garlic and let that sauce simmer away.  Good, good stuff!

I made it just as directed and it was incredible. Although...I made 4 extra chicken breast cutlets, breaded them and froze them so the 2nd time I made it, like a week later per family request, it was a snap!!!

This was fantastic! The only changes I made was to add pecorino romano and Sharp Provolone on top and put it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese. I also used whole grain Penne pasta instead of regular Penne. I will make this again and again I liked it that much. I then drizzled extra virgin olive oil on top.

So good! A little harder than I thought but well worth it. The chicken was nice and juicy and the sauce was delicious. My husband LOVED it and so did i. Thank you for sharing it with us!

My wife made this and it was exceptional...so good. She dialed back the garlic a little but everything else stayed the same.  Very very good....

Too spicy for us.  Will use 1/2 red pepper flakes next time.  Cut chicken into thin slices before breading.  Used 1/2 amount of bread crumbs & spices & 1 egg.  Used 8 oz. mini penne.

Good recipe. We liked it.  Notes: 1) That's a lot of bread crumbs for 3-4 pieces of chicken. Next time I will reduce it by 1/2.  2) that's a lot of pasta. Add 1/2 of the cooked pasta, mix it in and continue adding until you think that it looks right. I think that 2/3 is about right.

I tried out this recipe tonight and it turned out pretty good. I will make it again. I didn't use as much red pepper and my chicken breasts were frozen so the recipe took a little longer since I had to defrost the chicken first. I used slightly dried basil because the store was out of fresh.

This is a wonderful combination of pasta and chicken---excellent all the way around. If you could call this is criticism and it really is not, add some grated parm to the breadcrumbs ---I am an Italian gal from Flatbush  Brooklyn and always add the cheese into the crumbs. Thanks for a tasty treat!

Delicious and easy! Like others, I too halved the eggs, bread crumbs and pepper flakes and it was still plenty spicy, especially if you're cooking for kids. I also used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 6 which I think was perfect. Didn't have cutlets so I pounded 3 breasts thin and cut them the size of cutlets before frying. Two thumbs up from the whole family!

Had to cut the recipe since it was just for my husband and I ( and some leftovers of course).  The only changes I made was to reduce the red pepper and use frozen breaded chicken breasts. It was delicious and can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow. I will definitely make this again!

Calls for WAAAAYYYY too much olive oil! You don't need a 1/4 cup of oil to saute garlic and peppers. You also don't need as much breadcrumbs. Other than that,  this is a very good recipe.

This was excellent.  Loved it.  Used plain diced tomatoes as that was what I had available.  Also supplemented with dried basil as I only had a limited amount of fresh.   May use a little less crushed red pepper next time as my family thought it was bit spicy although there was no leftover.  I like spicy and thought it was great. Overall it was fantastic dish.

Really good base recipe, but it needs more heat in my opinion.  Either double the crushed red peppers or toss in some hot sauce.  

Also make sure you thoroughly season the chicken before cooking, and if you're putting bread crumbs on the chicken, don't mix the chicken in with the sauce or the bread crumbs will get soggy and that's not nice.  

Instead of bread crumbs, I coated my chicken bits with a single layer of nicely seasoned flour to crisp them up.  When everything's done cooking, put the pasta in a bowl, pour the sauce over top, and then pour the chicken bits on top of that.  Looks beautiful, and tastes even better.

Cut the chicken first, that got stressful to do when the chicken was hot and more breading is good. Also I'd recommend more sauce, I added some more at the end (as well as some salt/pepper to account for the extra liquid) and it was the perfect consistency for me. But it was amazing, definitely something I'm going to save.

LOVED! I added some hot rotel mixed with a can of diced tomatoes to add some flavor. Also I added an extra can of tomato sauce, the breaded chicken absorbed a lot of the sauce. AMAZING RECIPE!

My family really enjoyed the meal. I didn't use the full amount of red pepper flakes and I'm glad I didn't or it would have been too spicy for my kids. It had just the right amount of spice with half for them. My other comment and maybe it's my own lame cooking, but it was a lot of work to bread the chicken and then the breading didn't stay on the chicken once mixed with the sauce.

My 7 year old daughter loved the pasta. I have made this dish twice the first time I followed recipe to the T. However the second time I used ground beef instead of the chicken. I preferred the ground beef.

Delicious! This would taste great with sausage, baked chicken strips or just the sauce and pasta.

This was fantastic! So simple, and with ingredients that I almost always have on hand. I live in a foreign country where cans of diced tomatoes are outrageously over-priced, so I chopped up 6 big fresh tomatoes (left the skin and seeds), and used that instead, and it was delicious. I added about a half an onion to the sauce just because. And the breaded chicken was some of the best I've ever made! Thank you!

First of all can you say YUM! This was delicious and very easy to make.  I made exactly as recipe stated. The only thing I would do different is to reduce the eggs to one and the bread crumbs to one cup.  Of course you would have to adjust the salt, garlic powder, and pepper as well.  I will definately make this again for guests the next time.

I didn't have any fresh garlic so I added some garlic powder to the sauce.  It was still excellent!  I will be making this one again, with real garlic next time.

This was good, but I to change a few things due to a lack of ingredients.  I didn't have any fresh basil on hand, so I used 1tsp of dry basil leaves in the sauce, and another 1/2tsp in the breading mixture.  No eggs either, but I had some sour cream, so I watered it down a bit and used that to dip the chicken in before breading.  Worked really well, as my breading stuck to the chicken even after I mixed it in the sauce.  Dirties a lot of pans, but fairly easy to make. and I like the little bit of kick from the red pepper flakes.  I really want to try this again with the fresh basil, I'm sure it makes this pasta even better.

I have made this 3 times now and it is delicious!!! I add mozarella at the end so it becomes a version of chicken cutlet parmagiana!  I keep meaning to add spinach as I think it would be a great addition and get some vegetables in there.

I am ashamed of myself that I had this recipe in my recipe box for the past 3 Years and never tried it until today. It was incredible, everyone loved it and the next time, I am going to double the recipe because the five of us left the bowl empty!! I made it exactly and sprinkled a little fresh parsley and fine mozzarello on top. They requested a side order to go with tomorrow's meal. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was okay, not remarkable in any way though.  I did have trouble keeping the coating on the chicken, and the coating was the best part so losing it definitely had a negative effect.

I found that the coating on the chicken would not stay on, the temperature for the stove was too high and the cooking time for the chicken was too long.  I cooked my chicken on medium heat for five minutes.  When I went to turn it over I found that the coating that was left was burned to .  I ended up throwing the whole thing out and ordering pizza.  I would not attempt this again.

Really very good, I took other suggestions and cut the chicken up before I breaded and fried it, I used 2 chicken breasts and they soaked up most of the sauce so next time I will only use 1 and this will make a very inexpensive meal for 2 or 3

I loved this - it was spicy, not too creamy, not too runny and the fried chicken recipe is perfect for this pasta dish!  I increased the garlic and reduced the amount of oil in the sauce).  Great recipe!

It wasn't bad, but not exceptional. I would really rate this as a 3 1/2 star recipe. A fair amount of cooking for a lukewarm reception. My daughter, who adores this sort of thing didn't even comment, let alone have seconds. :(

I made this the other night and thought it was very good.  My husband thought it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly but didn't put in all the red pepper.  Will definitely make this again.  The sauce was very good and flavorful. Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe!!  Wonderful flavor, it's a new family favorite!!  I do like to make the sauce/chicken a little ahead, and I use 1/2 the red pepper for our taste.

Great recipe although I did add 1 tsp salt and 1 tsp Italian Seasoning Mix to the sauce. I also felt the sauce was a little thick, so I added more tomato sauce and this turned out great!

This recipe was great, but I would change a couple things. The pepper flakes make it TOO spicy to even enjoy, I guess it's good if you like really hot food. I suggest just putting a forth of the pepper flakes in if you don't like your food too spicy. I also added a half a jar of spaghetti sauce, the first time I made this their wasn't enough sauce to go around. Oh yeah! This pasta is even better the day after, the pasta absorbs the sauce perfectly. All in all this is a really good recipe. DON'T FORGET THE GARLIC BREAD!

A really good and easy dish that everyone liked.  Chicken was tasty and juicy.  I would also suggest making more sauce.  I didn't, but had a spicy, canned variety in the back on the cupboard that I added.  I will definetly make this again.  Thanks!

awesome dish!! My family loved this very authentic. One change I made was to use fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic, basil and olive oil. I also added hot italian sausage on the side.I will def. make this over and over again!!

This recipe is a winner. The DH(who doesnt really like chicken) and the three teenage boys in the house have gobbled this up both times I have made it. Any leftovers have been gone by the next day. Inexpensive enough to make this on the regular meal rotation.

In my first attempt at this it turned out very bland tasting.  I may play with the spices a bit.  I love the colour, texture and ingredients, I just want more flavour.

Easy and tasty. I don't eat meat, and my husband does, so I kept the chicken separate and put it on top of his pasta, instead of mixing it all together.  I put in a little bit less red pepper so that my two year old would eat it.

FANTASTIC!!  We cut the chicken in strips before frying and used fettucini instead of penne.  The recipe is great and yes, you really need to add those garlic cloves.

One of the absolute best dishes I have every enjoyed. We make it at least once every two months, more if it were up to me. Do not be scared off by the amount of garlic. Makes a mess, but well worth it !

This is one of my favorite dishes! My husband eats this until he can't eat anymore! I use less crushed pepper because I'm not big on spicy foods, and if I don't feel like defrosting chicken and cooking it seperate, I use frozen breaded chicken tenderloins/strips right out the bag and it tastes GREAT! You have to give this recipe a try!

Good dish!  I love using fresh herbs but next time I'll save the $2.00 I spent on fresh basil and use dried basil instead because the red pepper flakes over power the basil anyway and you can't really taste it very much.  I used farfalle (bowtie) pasta and prefer that with this dish since I have so many recipes with penne, ziti, & mosscachioli, which are all (pretty much) the same hollow tubes.  I also added a few TBSP of red wine to the sauce and topped with fresh shredded parmesan cheese before serving.  Will make again, but not often.

I thought this was pretty good but my family thought it was too spicy. The chicken was really good though. I've cooked that separately from this dish and it is always yummy.

Great sauce!  I've had some trouble with the breading sticking to the chicken (usually falls off in the sauce), but it's a quality recipe.

This is a staple recipe in our home!  Since it's pretty spicy, I tried using 1/2 the amount of chili flakes, and it turned out great.  Just depends on your taste buds!  I've yet to try the chicken included in the recipe.  I just add chicken that I bake in the oven (with a little garlic salt and pepper).  Enjoy!

I had 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce and chicken breast in my fridge and this is the recipe that came up in the ingredient search.  What a good find!  Instead of the diced tomatoes & tomato sauce, I used my leftover jar of spaghetti sauce.  Also, I sub the hot pepper sauce with red chili flakes and used Italian style bread crumbs instead of plain + same seasonings.  One egg was enough for coating and I probably used around 1-1.5 cups of bread crumbs.  Instead of drowning the chicken bits in the sauce, I scattered the pieces on top.  Yummy!

I was nervous to try this recipe because I had never breaded anything before. This turned out really well. I prepared exactly to the instructions. This is much easier to make then it looks. I recommend giving it a try.

I used rotini pasta in place of penne. I had to add a few little things to make it just a tad better in my taste. It needed a little water added to the sauce and 1/4 garlic salt, 1/4 ground pepper. Served with some warm french bread topped with Italian seasoning and some mozzarella.

A real hit - I halved the recipe (for two of us, and there were still leftovers). After reading the reviews I did reduce the red pepper flakes, and used panko crumbs for the bread crumbs. I mixed the penne and sauce together, and sliced the chicken laying it over the top of the pasta. As an added touch, I grated fresh parmesan over the dish before serving.

this recipe is really good, perfect how it is written, & easily adjustable to personal taste (even vegatarian). this time, since i didnt have any breadcrumbs i just cubed the chicken tenders and seasoned with garlic pepper and browned in some olive oil. i also added a bit of oregano and italian seasoning. either way it turns out awesome.

I felt like I was eating a dish right out of the Olive Garden (my favorite restaurant).  I did add a few shakes of Italian Seasoning, oregano, and basil and even a bay leaf until it tasted the way I like it.  I will definitely use this recipe again and I think I will bread the chicken in italian bread crumbs next time.

This was a very good recipe, but like everyone else I had some changes:  I used egg whites mixed with a little water instead of whole eggs for breading the chicken - just to cut some calories.  And since I don't like the taste of canned diced tomatoes, I used 1.5 lbs. of sliced roma tomatoes instead.  The taste of the basil really made this recipe excellent.  I suggested to my family that we just grill the chicken next time and toss it in, but everyone really liked the breaded chicken.  I will definetely be making this again!

This was really good! Didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I just added extra seasonings. I did just as the recipe said and mixed the chicken in. It didn't make it soggy at all. Some of the breadcrumbs came off, but mixed into the sauce, so it still tasted great!!! Will def. make again!

This was delicious, I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loved it. It's also good without the chicken if you are serving vegetarians. 

I definitely recommend doubling the amount of red pepper if you're a fan of spicy food. 2 tablespoons was enough of a kick without being too overwhelming.

We loved the bread crumbs as a substitution for flower on the chicken.  It made for a lighter taste.  We will defiantly make this one again.

This recipe went over very well in my home. Even my picky son loved  it. I made a couple of changes. I used half Italian bread crumbs and half parmesan bread crumbs.  I also used regular diced tomatoes because that's what I had.  I doubled the recipe because I have a family of 6 and we have leftovers. I only used half the amount of bread crumbs and eggs requested and I still had some to throw away.  I think next time I make it I'll increase the amount of penne as well.
Great and quick recipe.  Will make again very soon.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Made it to the recipe, but used plain diced tomatoes and added garlic/olive oil myself to avoid high fructose corn syrup.

Really good!

LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!  This is an awesome recipe.  So delicious!  My whole family asks for it on a regular basis now.  Sometimes I just leave the chicken seperate from the sauce and noodles.  The breading is so yummy on the chicken too.

I gave this 4 stars only because the sauce was way to plain! I added a bunch of garlic and onion power and a few pinches of salt to get it going right! The chicken was so good that I used the extra in a salad the next day!!!

Very yummy!! The chicken had really nice flavor.  Next time I will wait until the very end and serve it on top of the pasta because it got a little soggy.

Amazing! I have made this 4 times. Friends I serve it to love it.  If I am in a hurry I skip the bread crumb recipe and throw the chicken in with a bit of olive oil, garlic and add some Italian seasoning. It still comes out incredibly delicious. This is really quick and simple to make. I usually have some precooked pasta in the freezer to speed up the process.

This recipe is so good!  I just made one change to cut calories and fat.  Instead of frying the chicken I breaded the strips and drizzled a little EVOO on top and baked them.  Turned out great!

If I could, I would eat this every day! The sauce is going to become my signature red pasta sauce. I added an onion (because I pretty much add it to everything) and used turkey instead of chicken because I had it on hand. The meat is SO good enough to eat on the side or served on top too! Yum my stomach is doing a happy dance.

OK, nothing special. It was nice having a pasta dish w/o hamburger in it. As a start off point this is fine, but needs help. Cut back in bread crumbs for sure, & oil. This does give me ideas to "invent" my own chicken pasta recipe.  Won't make this specific recipe again.

WOW.  This recipe will be a favorite in our house for many years to come.  We loved it.  I used wheat penne and no one even knew the difference.  I cut the red pepper flakes in half as we have picky little kids...turned out perfect.  I've had the leftovers at least 3 times now and I'm still not tired of it...NOT a leftovers lover, but this really hits the spot.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I was impressed with the breading on the chicken, it was so flavorful. The tomato sauce was wonderful as well. All together, a great meal!

This recipe was absolutely FABULOUS!!!!  It will become a regular in my home.  I sauteed a whole chopped onion in the garlic and red pepper flake mixture, what a great addition. Love spicy and therefore almost doubled the red pepper flakes.

Delicious. I was so impressed with this recipe - the chicken is fantastic and it really ties the whole thing together. Next time, instead of frying the chicken breasts cutlets, I will try baking them and popping them under my broiler to get that crispy, crunching coating. I can't wait to experiment with the different varieties of diced tomatoes!!!

This was easy to make and took me a total of 45 minutes from start to sitting at the table.  my husband said it may have been the best thing i have ever made and tasted like it came from an italian restaurant.  i didn't put the red pepper flakes in (because i didn't have any on hand).  very tasty and i will def. make it again.

I liked this a lot. It's a cool alternative to spaghetti especially if you don't eat red meat. The breading on the chicken makes it. You can about 1/2 the amount of pasta.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed a few other reviewers and served my chicken on top of the pasta, it was great.  I didn't think that it was spicy at all and my husband who doesn't tolerate heat to well said that it was delicious as well!  Will be added into the rotation

I really understand why this received so many good reviews.  This was very time consuming and wasn't worth the effort, time, and clean up.  

I added one full teaspoon of the chilli paste - used paste instead of flakes - and it was definitely spicy but it's a good thing because the recipe was so bland otherwise.

I also added sliced mushrooms which added some depth but it's the chopped tomatoes that really ruin this recipe.  Tomato sauce would have been a better choice especially will pasta like penne which lacks flavor and needs something more moist to add to it.

I also added soy cheese but even that couldn't save this recipe.  The breaded chicken is a good idea but served on the side, not in the pasta.  

I won't make this again. My husband wasn't a fan and I couldn't eat it so it was a waste for us.

Delicious! I made this without the chicken for a lighter meal but it's wonderful all on its own. When I was buying the ingredients I ended up purchasing all organic ingredients which only improved the recipe. In the future I think I'll try adding a vegetable, maybe zucchini.

This was super!! This will go into rotation for sure!  I just made a couple slight changes.  I used dried basil because I had no fresh and I served the chicken on top because as soon as I put a slice in the sauce, the wonderful crispy crust fell off.

Wow!  This was awesome!  I can't make anything without tweaking it, but for this one, the only thing I changed was adding dried basil instead of fresh...but that's only because I didn't have any.  I also goofed and only bought one 14 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes seasoned w/garlic, olive oil & basil, so I did have to use a can of plain ol' diced tomatoes.  My hubby and I loved the spice and the amount of garlic!  This one will go into the roatation for sure!

Made this last night and was a real hit w/ my hasband (me as well !)  When my husband suggests a meal "not made" on the grill for company, I'm amazed :) I like the hint of red pepper.  Used panko crumbs and also served chicken on the side so it would stay crunchy.  Will definitely go on favorites.  Thx !

I saw this recipe & couldn't wait to try it.  I used shrimp instead of chicken & it was INCREDIBLE.  I did use less olive oil as others suggested & those are the only changes I made.  This is a definite keeper!

This was SO YUMMY!  I made it exactly according to the recipe, and although I loooove my food spicy and thought this had a lovely kick to it, I will probably cut down the red pepper next time I make it for my family members who do not like spicy food.  Had leftovers for lunch today and it is even better after sitting for a day - the flavors are just great.  At least as good as my local Italian restaurant, if not better!

This was very good.   I liked it because it was different from our traditional spagetti dish.  The spice was a different twist.  I doubt it will take the place of my usual italian dishes but it will be something I make when I want to mix things up.

I was skeptical of this recipe because I had had Arrabiata in a restaurant before and wasn't a big fan.  I was very happily surprised at how much better this was.  Like some others, I didn't cut the chicken up but just served it with the pasta so it would stay crispy.  I was glad because the chicken has a good flavor on its own as well as with the pasta.  I'll definitely make this again.

This dish was very good after I added a few changes.  Since we like things spicy, I added red pepper flakes & about 1/2 tsp of red pepper to the sauce.  Also for the breading for the chicken, I used Italian Bread Crumbs and a spicy chicken breading I make.  Once I made those changes it was great.

The basis of this recipe was fantastic but I broiled the chicken breasts with olive oil, salt, pepper & garlic powder instead of frying them which is why I'm only giving 4 stars. Fried chicken just doesn't mesh well with pasta in my opinion. But the sauce was excellent and I absolutely will be making this again. Oh, I used fresh diced tomatoes from my garden instead of canned - yum!

Wonderful.  We were dissapointed when we ran out of leftovers.  I put a bit less spice in than the recipe called for, turned out perfect for us.

Simply outstanding!  I did make a few minor changes: I added an additional clove of garlic (for a total of 7) and used 1 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes instead of just 1.  You can adjust the latter to your spiciness preference, of course; I thought it was perfect, while my husband thought it could use a little bit less, although he still liked it.  I used dried basil...a generous amount, but not too much.  I used the whole can of tomato sauce (that's why I added more garlic, red pepper, and basil).  Finally, I used mini-shell pasta b/c I didn't have penne on hand.  The end result was restaurant quality!

I have made this several times, and each time it comes out delicious. It is easy to make, flavorful, and quick. I use a little tomato paste to thicken it up; otherwise, I follow the recipe directly. I highly recommend this dish.

I used some fresh tomatoes with the canned diced flavored tomatoes.  Used whole wheat pasta.  Used chicken tender frozen pieces defrosted.  Layed them over the top of the pasta mixture to serve. 
Yummmmm!!!!!!!!!!

Very very good recipe.  I made only a few minor changes.  I cut back quite a bit on the red pepper flakes.  Wasn't sure just how much a "bunch" of fresh basil was, so I used a decent sized handful and chopped it up, not too small.  Also, I only used 1 cup of bread crumbs (with plenty left over) and probably will only use 1 egg the next time a make this dish, and I WILL be making it again...maybe for company.  Anyway, it was delicious and not hard to make.  Thanks!...an update 11/11/08...Once again, this dish is wonderful....this time I completely omitted the red pepper flakes and it was still very good....my husband's stomach just can't handle spicy any more....otherwise, I followed the recipe closly except I use a garlic press instead of slicing the garlic.  It's sooo good.   Thanks again!

i'm a huge fan of arrabiata. back in the phils there's this restaurant called Red Tomato and they serve the best spaghetti arrabiata i've ever tasted. I've been trying to make/imitate the taste but not 100% similar to that yet. I've made this exact recipe on one of my experimenting days and i'm amazed that there really is one out here. Great pasta!

This is good, but there's nothing fancy about it. I would actually add a little more red pepper next time I make this dish. It is a nice change from regular sauce too.

I made the sauce exactly as noted in the recipe, the only thing I did differently was use grilled chicken instead of the fried.  This was wonderful!  My husband is a little picky and when he first saw it, he said, what is that, a bunch of chunks of tomato?  Then he tried it and said, this is REALLY good!  Great flavor as is on the sauce.

Great recipe, not too difficult at all...definitely too spicy for my family...go easy on the red pepper if you are not sure.  My husband and kids all ate it, even though it did earn a new name - "tubes of fire."  Will make again using MUCH less red pepper.

This smells absolutely amazing while cooking my mouth was watering the whole time.  I will admit next time I make this I will cut back just a touch on the chili flakes, I'm a wimp what can I say, lol.  I also only used 1 cup of breadcrumbs as other reviewers and it was plenty to cover the chicken.  I served the chicken on the side so we could enjoy the delicious coating this had on it.  Leftovers were excellent too. Thanks for posting.

Mmmmmm... very good; however, I did make some changes to the sauce and followed others suggestions of using half the egg and breadcrumbs called for. For the sauce, I didn't have canned tomatoes so I roasted a red pepper and cut up some white button mushrooms to add body to the sauce. I also used 2 cups of my mom's thin tomato sauce. Around here we're not big pasta eaters, but I will make this again. Thanks!

This was a good recipe.  It was pretty quick to make and different from other Italian dishes that I have made.  I couldn't find tomatoes with garlic and olive oil so I used diced tomatoes with garlic, oregano and basil.  I chopped them in the food processor a bit  as my family doesn't  like big chunks.  I put the tom. sauce and basil in with that.

Best Italian dish I have had homemade.  I stuck to the recipe excpet for cutting the chicken first, dunking in in the egg, and then mixing it through the bread crumb mixture in a plastic bag (shake-n-bake style). I only cooked the chiken about 7 minutes before adding to sauce to cook through. I also added 1/2 a chopped onion with the garlic. It makes a lot for 2 people but we kept going back for more.  Thanks!!

Great. I had to make it without the chicken the first time and it was still very good...we loved the spice. Next time I'll definitely try it with the chicken because I'm sure it will be even better. Thanks!

This was fabulous! I added extra Tomato sauce and used frozen breaded chicken breasts(baked separately). I sliced them and only simmered them in the sauce for a few minutes. So easy, but it tastes like something I really labored over.  Thank you!

This recipe was good.  I did use 2 cans of tomato sauce because the sauce seemed a little too thick.  Also, we added so much parmesan cheese to the top that I would just add it to the sauce next time.  With the minor changes, it was a good recipe.

This is one of the few recipes with a 5-star rating that deserves it.  Restaurant quality dish with a bit of heat thanks to the red pepper flake.  The only deviation I made from instructions was to cube the chicken before breading it.  This will definitely become a staple dish  in my house.

SO SO SO GOOD!  I use the whole can of tomato sauce, just because we like a little more sauce... and shrimp instead of chicken. (makes it even quicker!) We make this once a week, and it's great leftover for lunch too.  I'll never use canned tomato sauce again.

Delicious and easy to make!  I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilis and onion, which added a little kick.

This recipe was REALLY yummy.  I recommend using Muir Glen roasted tomato in the sauce.  It gives it a great flavor.

Yum!  LOTS of good spice!  I followed this mostly (I can't help myself!!)- except I added a can of black olives to the sauce and served the chicken over the top to preserve its crunchiness like another reviewer suggested. Delicious!  Thanks for this great recipe!

Sorry i didn't think this was all that good.  I have my own version and it's much better.  Fresh garden tomoates are much better than canned ones.

This was delicious and our whole family enjoyed it.  My 12 year old daughter chose this recipe, and prepared it for us with just a bit of help.  We cut the red pepper flakes in half and it was still flavorful.

I had good luck with this recipe and everyone in the family liked it.  I scaled the recipe to two servings and it made plenty to feed our family of 4 served with some grilled veggies.  I made one change by using grilled chicken.  That way it was a little more health conscientious and a bit easer to fix on a hot summer day.

Excellent and very easy.  I sliced the chicken breasts before breading so there was more surface area for the breading.  You could make this as hot or mild as you (or your guests) would like with the amount of red pepper you use.

Good.  Very garlicky, which I liked, but some of my kids, not so much.  Made a ton and I couldn't believe it was stated as four servings!  It fed all six of us and we had leftovers. Which is a good thing :)!

I baked the chicken instead of going through all the trouble of breading and frying.  It was delicious, just the right amount of spice for me.  I will certainly be making this again!

Excellent!  For a healthier version, I just browned the chicken pieces and tossed into the mix after it heated up. Also added a splash of white wine to smooth out the flavor.  For kids/non-tomato eaters, blend the can of tomatoes.

This is an awesome recipe!  It's great with or without the chicken.  I used the whole amount of red pepper and didn't think it was very hot.  Someone suggested serving this dish with mozzarella balls like they do at the Macaroni Grill.

Amazing recipe. Very easy to make. The only thing I changed was I used a 15oz can of tomato sauce (as we like a little extra sauce w/our pasta)& a 1lb box of penne. Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent!  To make it easier, instead of coating the chicken with bread crumbs and eggs, I just coat the chicken directly with a mixture of ~1 cup flour and the other recommended ingredients.  I always buy thin-sliced fresh chicken breast from the grocery to save lots of time too.

This was so good...like chicken parmesan with a really big kick.  I even added a little extra red pepper since we like things really spicy.  I'll definitely be making this again, and soon.

A great recipe that we enjoyed very much. Although spicy (adjust to your taste), the crushed red peppers give it the right amount of punch to set it apart from other pasta dishes. In addition, the homemade chicken tenders were a great addition, but if you are short on time, cooking up pre-made chicken tenders tastes good too. We always look forward to having leftovers of this dish!

Everyone loved it.  I couldn't find oil/garlic tomatoes so I used garlic/onion.  There was almost too much chicken for this- I think 3/4 pound would be perfect.  I didn't use quite a full teaspoon of red pepper and it was a good- I might even use the whole measurement next time.  I will definitely make it again.

The sauce is fantastic - perfect amount of spiciness.  Sometimes instead of the chicken, I'll fix this sauce with shrimp, mushrooms, and bell peppers - delicious!

If you like hot and spicy, you'll probably give this 5 stars.  I loved this dish, but it was too spicy for me and my kids.  Next time I will cut the red pepper in half.  It goes great with a nice salad and a glass of wine!  Very yummy, like restaurant food.

My husband and I thought this was really good.  It definitely had great flavor and was just spicy enough.  I would either add more sauce or add less noodles.  I will definitely make this again.

I enjoyed this recipe. I think the reason some people may have found it too spicy is that they are not accustomed to spicy pasta dishes. I would recommend reducing the red pepper flakes if you're not comfortable with spicy flavor. I followed this recipe, but added a few tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumb mixture, which adds a nice flavor to the chicken. Would make this in the future.

This meal was delicious.  I don't really like my food too spicy so I omitted the red pepper flakes, and as another reviewer suggested added some brown sugar to the sauce.  It came out wonderful.

Wow, that was awesome!
I followed some of the reviews and cut the pepper flakes in half, my girlfriend can't stand too much heat.  And I cut the chicken into strips before cooking it.  I used all of the breadcrumbs and both eggs, cutting those in half would not have been enough.  Then I topped it with mozzarella when it was served.  Super good!  Thanks!

There's nothing wrong with this recipe, I guess it's just a matter of taste - I found it unimpressive.  I used only half the amount of red pepper flakes, and it was still pretty spicy.  I didn't think the sauce was very good - it just tasted like canned tomatoes with too much basil and spicy flavor.  The chicken was good - I wish I had served it on the side and not mixed it in, as it got kind of lost after cutting it up and mixing it in.  Also, this makes a ton of food - 6 servings at least - and I wish I had made only half and not ended up with so much left over.  It did taste better the next day, but all in all it was a lot of effort for a so-so meal.

This had the best flavor, I didn't have fresh basil and didn't have time to run and get any so I used the dried seasoning in the pantry.  I love the crispy chicken.  I think I just may prepare my chicken cutlets this way all the time because my family loved them so much.  Thanks for the great recipe....it's a keeper!

Very good dish.  I thought I was sneaking in the red pepper but everyone noticed the spice.  I loved it but if I make again I'll have to leave it out.

This was excellent!  It was a hit with the whole family.  My only suggestion would be to use a little less garlic than recommended and throw in some Italian spice to make it a flavor extravaganza.  :)

I fixed this two nights ago for dinner, It was very simple to make and it was wonderful. I would not change a thing. My husband and I found ir perfect, my kids found it good but a bit spicy, except for the chicken which I did not cut up.

I just made this last night. It was a huge hit with both of us, especially my picky-eater husband who can’t stand onions. My only problem was that my pan wasn’t big enough to accommodate everything by the end! Next time, I will use fewer eggs & breadcrumbs for breading (I just saved the extra breadcrumbs, I will use them to bread chicken breasts for a sandwich) and also I will not let the penne overcook (my fault.) Also, I’ll try serving it with the chicken on top. An excellent, very tasty and EASY dish!

I will add to the list of those who love this recipe!  Because I am a lazy cook, I fry up some slices of chicken sausage instead of the chicken in the recipe because it is easier, and I use plain diced tomatoes as I always have those in the cupboard. I have already made it several times, it is a definite keeper!

My family really enjoyed this pasta!! I did not add the full amount of red pepper flakes but it still had a great flavor!  After I served it I put graded mozarella on top so that it melted into the pasta....sooo good! Everyone especially liked the chicken.  I will make this again for sure!!

Good recipe.  LOVE the breading on the chicken!  I agree with others that you probably only need one egg to coat and less bread crumbs.  Overall, very tasty dish.

This was excellent and very easy.  I used a little less red pepper because of my kids. Everyone loved it. Thanks Brooklyn Girl!
