Great side dish!  I love broccoli and pasta and so does my husband and this was no exception. This was very light, with a nice garlic flavor and a hint of lemon. I used penne pasta and instead of heating the garlic and lemon juice in olive oil, I used minced garlic from the jar and whisked the "dressing" in a small bowl.  I added a bit more lemon juice and some lemon zest.  Once the broccoli and pasta were done, I tossed everything together and used a combination of parmesan and romano cheeses.  This was a perfect light side dish to accompany "Apple Cider Chicken Marinade" from this site. Note: If you want to add a little kick to this dish sprinkle a bit of crushed red pepper flakes on top!

Light and awesome for summer! I substituted snow pea pods for part of the broccoli as my family isn't big on a lot of broccoli. I think this time I might add some chicken to make it an entire meal!

Great recipe.  My family loves it. Easy recipe to vary.  I make it a little different every time.  Have added red pepper flakes, used whole wheat pasta & low fat parm & even grilled chicken, substituted lime for lemon, and added extra spices (thyme, oregano, basil), or leave as is.  You really can't go wrong w/this recipe

This was very good!  My family ate it all up.  I added chicken to it like the other reviewer.  With the addition of the chicken, I think it could use a little more lemon juice next time.

I added grilled marinaded chicken strips, another garlic clove and crushed red pepper - it was great! Next I want to try it with grilled shrimp.

I make a similar dish with olive oil, chopped broccoli and garlic over angel hair pasta.  It is a family favorite that I grew up with.  this was very close but more suited for shrimp with the lemon in this recipe.

I used 4 oz. thin spaghetti pasta and one and a half cups of organic broccoli. I used half butter and half extra virgin olive oil and added about a half teaspoon of dried basil. The family thought this was pretty tasty. I served this with Grandma's Chicken Chardon.

So easy and incredibly tasty!  Not sure if I cooked the garlic just right, but it still was truly delicious.  I will be making this again.  It was a great pairing with teriyaki chicken.

I did not like this recipe at all as it was too bland. I tried adding different spices, but nothing really worked. Perhaps a broth might have helped, but it was just not flavorful.

Good recipe. You should have a picture of actual bow tie pasta on it though. That is penne pasta, and the rest is regular spaghetti/angel hair pasta.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I just made it and it is so tasty!  I would definitely recommend this recipe if you love garlic, broccoli and pasta.  The lemon is perfect with this dish also!  It adds to the garlic and broccoli perfectly!  I couldn't stop eating it that's how good it was.  I will be making this recipe often.

Good easy meal.  I added lemon zest and cut back a little on the lemon juice and it really boosted the flavor.  I also tried the suggestion to add crushed red pepper flakes another time when I made this dish and it was a hit.

It was simple but delish! Easy to prepare and easy to eat! :)

Will definitely be making this again. The only thing was that I didn't add enough salt (for my taste anyway).

This was lovely accompanied by  shrimp that I'd sauteed in garlic and lemon.  I dropped one star because it turned out rather bland until I upped the seasoning.  Next time I might add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a bit of zing.

I cooked my pasta and broccoli first. While the pasta and broc were draining, I made the sauce in the pasta pot. Then tossed the pasta and broc back in to the pot to finish putting it together. Garnished with some fresh basil from my garden. Voila! Simple, delicious, and only one pot to clean.

Very quick and easy recipe.  Adding the broccoli to the pasta water makes it super quick.  Double the lemon juice.  I used the juice from two lemons and liked the way it turned out.

This is very good side dish.  I served it with Alice Chicken,  from this site.  I will make again but either increase the broccoli or decrease the pasta for a better balance.  I also cooked the broccoli for 3-4 min.  Everyone loved the sauce,  made exactly as the recipe.

This is such a simple and great recipe! I agree with the other reviewers that you need to add more lemon. Two variations I made were to add mushrooms to the olive oil and lemon sauce. The mushroom packs the zest of the lemon juice even more and I used penne pasta made from lentils. It gives the dish an earthier taste. Love it love it love it! My husband also loves it! Thanks for posting this recipe!

This a great start to this pasta.  I however thought there was too much garlic.  I took other suggestions and used half butter, half olive oil.

It needed some more ooomph, perhaps adding butter as someone suggested and perhaps red pepper flakes. It was however, a quick and easy side dish when I didn't have ingredients for anything else. Thanks!

I enjoyed making this dish.  The only thing I added was lemon rind and extra lemon.  I also used very good parmesan cheese with a wonderful flavor and chili flakes.   I made this for 30 people and they came back for seconds. Wonderful

Too much lemon.  I ended up rinsing off some of the sauce.  but when you add the parmesan cheese its really yummy.  I was the only one in my picky family that liked it also.  but i liked it.

I make something almost exactly like this, but I add a tbsp of butter with the olive oil.  Gives it a bit of extra richness.  I also cook the pasta in chicken broth for an extra pop of flavor.

This recipe turned out really good. Paired with some garlic bread this made for a nice, light dinner on a hot summer day. Four/five in my family liked it so I’m sure we’ll make it again. Next time I might add a little more lemon juice, or lemon zest to up the lemon flavor since that wasn’t real strong, but still very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick and easy.  Loved the lemon but cooked the broccoli first.  That was a mistake.  Next time will make exactly as written.   I believe I would like it cold as well.

I used penne instead of bowtie pasta, one clove of garlic. Came out great and the family ate it up!

This was very easy and I liked it.  Next time I will put more broccoli and less pasta.

So easy and delicious! I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms and diced cooked chicken breast to the olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice, browning all while the pasta cooked.

I added grilled, sliced chicken breast to make it a 5 star recipe. Will be making this again.

Pretty easy and quick.  At first I thought there may be too much lemon but after letting everything settle a few minutes the flavor was good.  May try with only 2tbsp next time. Served it with rotisserie chicken.  Yum!

I made this and added Vegetarian Italian sausage which I added to the olive oil and browned before I added the garlic. A little more filling and very yummy! I served with salad, garlic bread and a beverage. A nice dinner. Fits the 1200 Calories a day diet. I did cut down on the cheese just a tiny bit, using a low fat Parmesan.

This is a very simple and  tasty side that could easily be a main dish.  Used a bit too much pasta; but otherwise, the  recipe works well.  I would agree that zesting the lemon would be a great addition.  We had grilled chicken thighs  and cut the last one into the leftover pasta for tomorrow.  May try adding more veggies next time.

I love this dish.  I did a steamable broccoli in the microwave then added it to the bowl while tossing everything.
