I altered this recipe a bit and made it in my Crockpot. Here’s what I did. Used two containers of 26oz parlamat chopped tomatoes, 1 large eggplant sliced to ½ inch, sweated by salting waiting 30 minutes and blotting, then sautéed, 2 chopped green Serrano chilis (seeded), and I soaked ½ cup of dried lentils in 2 cups of boiling water for 1 hour (this constituted pre-cooking) and used 2 onions instead of 1. I also used a deboned half leg of lamb which I cubed. I omitted the hot sauce (the extra chili did the trick.) 

I browned the meat, removed then browned the onion garlic as instructed. I then combined the remaining ingredients in my crockpot and cooked for 4 hours on high (admittedly, I stirred once, but I’m sure you don’t need to.) I then left on warm for 2 hours to let the meat get more tender. This was excellent served over some plain couscous with a nice glass of red wine. I will admit, this was even better the next day! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband is Israeli and I've come to love Middle Eastern dishes. This lamb dish was wonderful!  Absolutely delicious with an abundance of flavor. While it does take some time in the oven, the dish itself is quickly prepared and IT IS WORTH THE WAIT!! By far the best recipe for lamb I've tried to date. THANK YOU Farah!

We had some lamb and I was craving something Middle Eastern. My husband selected and prepared this dish (finally followed a recipe without modifications!) as we had the ingredients on hand. I thought that it was really good although the flavour could have been even more intense. I thought that apricots or some other dried fruit would be a nice addition. I thought that it warranted a 5 but he said only 4 stars (he made it!) - I suspect it's because he's not a big fan of lentils and chick peas! Hopefully he makes this again!

This was great!  Add salt and pepper to taste.  I also used canned diced tomatoes for the cost factor in the winter time (tomatoes can be a bit pricey this time of year).  I only use cinnamon sticks and added 2.  I didn't use shanks...just pieces of lamb with bone in.  Skipped the taking lamb back out of pan...just poured the sauce over the lamb and into the oven.  I adjusted the baking time accordingly because I wasn't using those big shanks.  Taste was wonderful and the spices blended nicely....loooove smokey flavor cumin gives dishes.  I served this over couscous.  Instead of peppers, just threw in some spicey tunisian ground chili powder.

I loved this recipie. We get half of a lamb once a year and I had saved a couple shanks for a roast durning the winter and when I saw this I did question whether to use it because it was different to us. But it was a big hit even the kids liked it. Although I couldn't make it that hot.

I tried the recipe but omitted the peppers and reduced the cinnamon as I'm not a fan.  
I used cayenne instead of flakes.  
It came out with still nice middle eastern  
flavors but needed salt and pepper.

Relly loved the aggressive use of cumin and cinammon. Great with  fatty lamb on a cold evening.!!!  The sweetness can be fine tuned with a little extra green chilli. Super!!

I am Heather Farah, the creator of this recipe. Thrilled that you all like it, but mine uses no heat whatsoever, certainly never a chile! (I have 4 kids, lol).  Also, I've *always* used canned crushed & diced tomatoes (again, 4 kids, keeping it cheap).  Everyone seems to modify it to their liking anyway, which is great!  And yes, you can make a crock pot version, but it's best to do your caramelizing in a pan first and then let it all go in the crock; but I do prefer the higher heat of an oven. More flexibility.

This was a good recipe to try if you want something different.  I made it because I had some cooked lentils to use up and I did an "ingredient search" and decided to try it.  I do not have a taste for middle eastern cuisine, or else I probably would have rated this as five stars, because it was easy and turned out really well.  I loved the meat on the shanks, but there was too much gristle to pick around for my taste.  Also, it did take longer than 20 minutes prep time - more like 45 for me, but maybe I'm just slow :o)  Thanks for the recipe, though - my husband and I both enjoyed something a little different!

Deserves 10 stars!  I served this with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits from this site together with baked red cabbage with apple and plain steamed green beans and my famly thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful.  The only changes I made were to use a whole small green chili and doubled up on the lentils but didn't use the chickpeas.  Clean plates all round in my house!  Many thanks - very impressed - definitely a keeper.

Can't believe how good this turned out!  Found this recipe completely by accident, but I will be making this again.  The kids cleaned their plates and went back for seconds which says alot!  Served with homemade pitas on the side.

This was pretty good.  The lamb tasted awesome, but it was too tomatoey.  I will make it again, but with some adjustments.

This recipe had an unusual flavor that I personally disliked. I felt it had too much cumin and nutmeg. The taste was very overpowering. Perhaps I would like it better if I cut some of the spice in half, but I probably won't make this one again.

Wonderful dish.  So simple, especially using canned chick peas and lentils, but tasted like a million dollars. Didn't make it quite so hot and added celery and carrot to the vegetable mix. Rubbed the lamb with salt and pepper just after browning. Served it with couscous, fresh salad, pitta bread and a yoghurt-cucumber-lemon dip, which balanced the heat and texture of the dish very nicely.  Went down very well with all ages.  Thank you to the contributor, this one will run and run!

Found this doing an ingredient search, and ended up deciding to make it as a side dish to accompany the lamb I was broiling.  I used 2 tomatoes and some "starter" marinara sauce, some sliced carrots and then followed the rest of the ingredients of the recipe to a "T".  I simmered on the stovetop for about an hour and t turned out wonderfully.  I served it with couscous and the broiled lamb and both my husband and I loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

Very easy and delicious! We never finish the beans if we run out of meat, so skipped the  chickpeas and just used about 3/4 c of lentils. To make it even easier, used a can of tomato sauce and one large tomato diced (only about 3 c tomatoes total because used less beans). I left it for about 3 hours at 350 while I ran errands and  it was just falling apart. Definitely recommend trying this one. So flavorful and simple.

This recipe turned out okay. But that was my fault. My oven runs really hot so I compensate by using a lower temp and by reducing baking time. I didn't do enough of either this time. The whole bottom of the pan was burnt...along with the veggies. I spooned the veggies I could salvage out of the pan and mixed with one can of condensed tomato soup. Served over orzo and it was pretty tasty. I'll try this again (in somebody else's oven) and I'm sure it will be even better.   Thanks!   Erin

Tomato and lamb seemed like an off combo to me but the recipe had so many positive ratings I decided to give it a go.  Great decision!  I made a few very minor changes to use what I had on hand.  I used canned tomatoes with jalapeños in place of the Roma's and hot sauce and left out the lentils.  I also did the whole thing in my cast iron Dutch Oven, stovetop and oven.  My house smelled heavenly as it cooked and the taste was just as good,  I served it with couscous.  Thanks, Heather!

This recipe was fantastic!  Definitely one I'd choose for company .  I used canned roma tomatoes and increased the pepper flakes a bit.  My husband rated this as one of his favorite dishes.

Made this yesterday with a few modifications based on the reviews I read. It was yummy. I used tomatoes I had frozen from my garden and diced can tomatoes. Used 4 cinnamon strips and thinly sliced the garlic. I browned 4 lamb shanks, onion and garlic. I had to remove half of the garlic because it burned. I just sliced more and added it to the crock pot where I cooked everything for 4 1/2 hrs. The first hour on high and then low for the remainder of the time. I added my salt at the end of the process. Served with brown basmati rice. Next time I will increase the heat a bit for my taste. Good recipe.

Did not change a thing in this recipe, which is really unusual for me, because this was my first attempt at this type of cuisine. Not one spice overwhelmed the overall flavor, so if there is one you normally don't like, still add it. The blend results in a great flavor. Well worth the prep time. I used a Serrano chile and, next time, I will use a hotter chile (to add a little more bite, which I like).

Served this with Moroccan Couscous and Cucumber Raita. The raita was great with both dishes. The combination made for a great meal.
