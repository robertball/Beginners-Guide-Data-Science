Good comfort food!  I'd totally make it again.  One reviewer mentioned an over-powering mustard flavor.  I'm not a mustard fan, so I was nervous, but decided to roll with the recipe minus alterations.  I agree that the mustard was a little over-powering in the sauce before cooking, but once the cheese melted though and worked its magic, the mustard faded into the background.  The entire thing came out MUCH better than I expected after tasting the sauce prior to cooking.  It was super easy and yummy.  Note:  The next day leftovers were kind of dry and disappointing, so you might want to make two small casseroles and bake separately if you're making two meals of it.

This was good!  I try to make things as written b/c otherwise it's not really fair to the contributor.  However, I tasted this before baking it and the mustard flavor was pretty overpowering so I added the rest of the cheese instead of putting it on top, 1/2 - 1 cup of frozen peas (didn't measure) and approx. 1/4 cup of heavy cream to dilute the mustardy flavor.  I then put some durkee french fried onions on the top.  It came out really great, although I would definitely decrease the mustard next time.  With my changes, I'd give it 5 stars but as written, I'd say 4.  My only complaint is that the directions do not tell you to bake covered or uncovered.  I covered it but it could have been a bit warmer in the middle so maybe uncovered would have been better?  Also, next time I might throw in a touch more cheese :).

I tried to keep to the recipe as written, but I made small changes to make it more appealing to my boys. I did have to add some evaporated milk to the casserole ingredients as it was quite thick, we like a thinner macaroni casserole. I also added another half cup of mozzerella cheese to the casserole ingredients and some sauteed onion and garlic as well. I did not use the mustard, only because I had so very little for lunches this week. I planned on making a cream base for this from scratch but I ran out of energy and ended up using the last can of mushroom soup in my pantry. My boys seemed to like this okay, my littlest ate his whole serving, which was a bonus as that kid complains about everything these days. This made enough for three hungry boys and a lunch for tomorrow. I thought it was good, though next time I might doctor it up and maybe add a little hot sauce next time. It helped me use up pantry ingredients that I had on hand without spending extra money I don't have anyway. I appreciated that. This would be good with tuna instead of ham, too.

It was cheesier than I was expecting, but was still great.  Definitely will be keeping this one on the list for future leftovers.

We liked this casserole and yes, you can taste the mustard a little bit but we didn't find it overpowering as others stated. Maybe it helped that I made this up the day before and cooked it the next day. Great way to use up leftover ham and stretching it for another complete meal.

Very good, comforting, cheesy. Tip: add 1/2 to 1 cup milk to sauce mixture to keep casserole moist

This is an excellent recipe to use left-overs.  It's easy and economical.  The author did miss a step in the instructions but that step is such a no-brainer that its omission is entirely understandable.  During step #3 you need to combine the cooked pasta with the ham/sauce mixture.  A keeper!

Too much mustard. Admittedly, I only like mustard in small doses. I made this recipe using my Christmas ham. It was too overwhelmingly mustard-flavored for me to eat--but the husband had few qualms! If you like a strong mustard bite, I would recommend this. If not, be sure to cut the quantity down!

I used small shell pasta, fat free sour cream and 98% reduced fat cream of mushroom soup.  I used part-skim mozzerella and only 2 t. mustard.  Pretty tasty.  I had made a honey glazed ham a couple months ago and had frozen cut up cubes just for a day when I didn't want to make something else.  It's really almost a glorified mac & cheese with ham.  I'm not sure I really like it enough to keep in the rotation, I think I'll stick with regular mac & cheese with some ham on the side.

We really liked this recipe. I only had 1/2 cup Mozzarella cheese, so I used Parmesan for the topping cheese and it worked out great. I also had to use dried parsley. I was cautious about the amount of mustard, so I only used 1 tablespoon, but I think the full amount would have been fine. Caution on the "salt to taste." When taste testing prior to baking, I added salt because it seemed to need it, then after baking and all the flavors had melded, it was too salty. It's a great way to use up left over ham and I'll make it again.

I'm not that great at looking at at recipe and figuring out how to modify it, so I always make it exactly as written the first time. It's good for what it is--a way to make use of leftovers using stuff that's probably already in your kitchen--but I probably won't make it again. Having said that, husband thought it was great--I think it was the mustard that did it for him :)

This is one of my family's Favorite dish!! It's super tasty and quick and easy to make. I only made a few changes, I replaced the parsley with Dill and the yellow mustard I replaced with a dill spicy mustard. Great dish, Thanks

Didn't have fresh parsley so just added dry parsley to the casserole mixture.  No salt required on account of the soup and ham.  Also cooked some fresh mushrooms in the microwave and added to the casserole.  Goodo.

Oh gosh, I made this to use up some leftover ham, and I think it's wonderful!  The only changes I made were to use egg noodles, lite sour cream, and after reading the reviews I used only 1 Tablespoon mustard.   I can barely taste the mustard, but I really like it, so I'm okay with that.  I also used dried parsley, so when called for I used 1/2 the quantity.

I just made this, however I made a couple alterations, I used swiss cheese instead of mozzerella, I like the combo of hame and swiss and I used dijon mustard instead of yellow.  The flavor is very nice and not overpowering as some had said with the yellow.  Will definitely had this recipe to my list.

I think mustard and cream of mushroom just don't mesh so well.  Maybe its an acquired taste.  It wasn't terrible, but I wont make it again.

I added zucchini, mushrooms and onions.  Instead of Cream of Mushroom soup, I used butter, flour and milk to make the cream sauce.

This was delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly!  We loved it. Since there are only two of us I made it in two 8x8 pans so we will bake another one up fresh in a couple of days. (Someone said it didn't reheat well, that is why I divided it

This is a great recipe. I was nervous about the reviews about the mustard and salt, but I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great. The only thing I did different was the amount of mozzarella cheese I added. I love Cheese. It was missing something but I am not sure what it might be, but most definitely making this again.

This was really good and a bit different.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used fat free sour cream and whole grain penne instead of spirals.  I could taste the mustard but that was OK with me as I like it but it might be too much for some.  Will definitely make again!

We have made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed it as its written here. I too agree that the yellow mustard was over powering. The second time we made this we added some mixed veggies, used brown mustard instead of yellow, and added a dash or 2 of garlic. The first time around was good, but I liked it much better with these few tweeks.

I tweaked this recipe with spinach and replaced 1\2 cup of sour cream with melted cream cheese and used a blend of Italian cheeses. I also added lots of garlic. This recipe was a hit at the dinner table. Thanks for the recipe.

had to say, the mustard for me ruined the dish.  I added frozen broccoli to mine to try and add a veggie element. may try it again, less the mustard and less (maybe 3/4 cup) of sour cream. 3 out of 5 for the boys and I.

Very good.  Was concerned about it being too mustardy but after reading the reviews, I, once again, put my faith in complete strangers and took a chance on it.  Once again, they were right.  You could definitely taste the mustard but it was in no way over-powering or distracting.  It was really good.  Made it just as written.

Didn't like the mustard seasoning in it.  Maybe with another flavoring or something

Made this with no modifications.  A little too much ham for me, and definitely too much parsley, but will make again!  My husband really enjoyed it.
