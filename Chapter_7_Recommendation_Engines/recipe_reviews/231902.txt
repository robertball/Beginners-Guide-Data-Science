They are delicious! We stock Idahoan instant potato packets in our house by the caseful! I happened on them while looking for something for the 'meat-and-potato only' eater in the household. I wanted something easy to fix so that when I wanted something like rice noodles or pasta there would be mashed potatoes as an alternative. These are one of the best products I've used. There are different flavor combinations and then you can jazz them up if you want to - cheese sour cream fresh chives or other herbs and of course bacon! The only tip I can offer is don't add all the water at first. It may have something to do with humidity but I always hold back a little and then see how I like the texture. I've had the unfortunate experience of making them too soupy once or twice and learned that tip the hard way:D
