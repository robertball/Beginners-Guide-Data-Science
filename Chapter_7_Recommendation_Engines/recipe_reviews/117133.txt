Yummy! The white wine is a must! I used more feta than the recipe called for and also served it with grated parmesan. My family loved it!

This was delicious and healthy.  I added some chicken sausage (from Sam's Club) and everyone loved it.

Excellent side item. Easy to make and tastes great. I added 1/4 cup of Calamata pited olives and used pinot grigio as the wine. I left the olives out until the end when you mix everything together. Can't wait to make it again.

Outstanding, I got a stand of ovation from my very picky son.. Im not a huge fan of Oregano so i used dried Basil instead and doubled the bow ties. Perfect

I love feta cheese, but I didn't really like it in combination with the other ingredients in this recipe. I followed everything exactly using white wine, and it just wasn't that good. I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3 because I did love the addition of the sunflower kernels.

This is a great starting recipe but makes a wonderful one-pot dish if you add some chicken breast. I am not a huge fan of feta cheese so i split in half and added mozzarella. I like to use grape or cherry tomatoes cut into quarters and add them last (juice, seeds and all) so they are still cool which contrasts the warm pasta well. And I omit the sunflower seeds since i dont usually have those on hand.

didn't care for it with white wine and the smell of cooking the feta was not nice.

This was dinner tonight, and it was great.  There were no left-overs, but I wish there were (I want to eat it again for lunch tomorrow).  I made a few changes, I made more pasta then the recipe calls for, and upped the sauce ingredients similarly so the sauce to pasta ratio would be ok.  As is, it's really more of a side dish.  I added some asparagus and black beans as well.

This is a nice light recipe, it would be perfect in the summertime, served hot or cold.  I skippped the sunflower kernels and instead added in about a half a cup of frozen corn kernels.  It was delish!
