The cloves add an unexpected taste!  I topped this with pecans, not almonds  Great tasting dish that was easy to prepare!

I might make it again, but the next time with 1/2t of powdered ginger. The way it is now, ALL I could taste was ginger.

I loved this! The first time I made it I had only dry spices, and was still great. This time, except for powdered ginger, I followed the recipe exactly.

Fun & easy way to spice up Quinoa. I served it with Coconut Chicken Korma and the flavors blended together quite nicely.
