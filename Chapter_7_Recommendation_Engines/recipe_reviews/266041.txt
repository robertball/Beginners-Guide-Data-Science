The cheese balls turned out pretty good. I did overdo it on the garlic so make sure you follow the recipe exactly!! They were adorable though! Also, I found the crackers got stale if I rolled them in the crumbs the night before.

I thought these would make very good individually sized cheese balls but they were much too big. They are packed with flavor and I would recommend just making one big cheese ball instead. Very few were eaten at my gathering of 40 people and they don't save well due to the pretzel getting soggy.
