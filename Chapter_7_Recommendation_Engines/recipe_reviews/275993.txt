Sounds wonderful! I don't have a  Airfryer, though. Could I just make this in my oven? I'm thinking maybe some nuts to add a touch of protein could make it more of a meal.

Best. Carrots. Ever. Not too sweet, not too vinegary. And a nice, colorful presentation. Melt in your mouth goodness! I followed the recipe except for omitting the chives.

Perfect as written and these carrots would pair nicely with any protein of choice. I will definitely make again and this is 5 stars all the way!
