WOOF!   Delicious!  Just as written!  Refreshing, different, light but satisfying.  Here's a little trick to get the best lemon zest:  take a fresh lemon, cut it in half, remove as many seeds as possible, freeze it.  Grates like a dream when frozen!   Makes the best dressing ever!

Rarely do I make a recipe as-written & not want to tweak it the next time. This was spot-on & amazing. I served it with various tiny roasted potatoes in olive oil & herbs. It was a hit!...(& easy!)

This recipe was so simple to get together which made it perfect for a weeknight meal.  I only marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes and I didn't think it absorbed much flavor from the marinade, so, next time I would leave it in a little longer.  I added a touch of honey to the dressing to take the edge of f of the acidity.  The salad with the chicken was the perfect bite.  I loved the punch of citrus with the bitter arugula.

I changed it up a bit by using boneless skinless chicken thighs - very succulent!
I live in an apartment so I couldn't grill...I used a heavy copper pan and med-high heat, olive oil till it sizzles then 3 min per side.  I cooked 3 pounds in 3 rounds.  When I served,  I used the first ones that I took out of the pan and had wrapped in paper towels.  They were perfect!
So easy and really appreciated by my friends!

This was a refreshing dish to kick off spring.  It was light and flavorful and refreshing after a winter of heavy meals.

Simple and tasty! I made the recipe exact except for using twice the garlic and no shallots. I love grilled chicken with salad, a great spring and summer meal.

Delicious! I had to use sundried tomatoes instead of fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe. Excellent, simple and easy. Loved it, indeed.

My family thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The marinate is delicious and gives the chicken a delicate flavor of white wine. The lemon vinaigrette works great  with the salad. Mixing the chicken and the salad together make a perfect bite.

This was very good.  It had really great flavor.  I do suggest that if you don't like really citrus tasting chicken than to keep the salad separate from the chicken. (From my son)

We thought this was very good and will have it again.  My pounded out chicken was thicker than the 1/4" suggested and so took a little longer to bbq, and my tomatoes were the cocktail tomatoes rather than the required ones.  I marinated the chicken for an hour rather than the 15 minutes asked for.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I almost forgot the zest for the arugula, but a late addition didn't make much difference.  If your lemon is quite tart, don't be afraid to add a very little sugar to the dressing.  We enjoyed this dinner!  Thanks!

Made it exactly as recipe indicates. The only difference was I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs. HUGE hit!! Kids loved it! Took it for lunch the next day.

This recipe unfortunately didnâ€™t turn out well. I let the chicken marinate for a few hours, and I cooked one test piece. It was completely lacking in flavor. I ended up dumping a bunch of spices on it and frying up the chicken and basically making a different dish:

Wonderful.  I pounded the chicken so thin that I was afraid to cook it on the grill.  Pan fried it was great !

This was really good.  I didn't change up anything.  The recipe for the salad dressing is a definite keeper! Will use that frequently.

Light, refreshing and quick dinner. I love chicken paillard and make a version of it often. The fresh greens on top was delicious however the dressing was to acidic. When making dressing a 2:1 oil:vinegar ratio seems to work out beautifully. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I grilled them on a panini and they didn't brown too good because they were so wet. Also, used bottled lemon juice. I would leave out the lemon altogether if I make again.

Followed the recipe. It is restaurant quality. Light, crisp and savory. I made mine in a skillet with the garlic and shallots from the marinade. They caramelized and gave the chicken a nice brown glaze. The peppery arugula and lemony dressing on the cherry tomatoes completed the experience. This one goes  into my favorites.

Beautiful and light! Perfect summer dish.  I did mine in a cast iron pan on the stove, and served with a side of  Alla Checce from this site.  The combo of hot chicken with the  cool light light salad on top makes you feel like you're eating in a nice restaurant.

I had already made a standard tossed salad with an iceberg/romaine base, and a ton of grape tomatoes, when I decided to use this recipe for the chicken. I made the marinade and dressing as directed. I wasn't crazy about this...seemed one-note to me. I love lemon, but think lemon works best as a complement or in combo with another flavor. (See Lemon-Basil Grilled Chicken...yum.) However...I did not use the arugula, which may have provided a more balanced flavor, so I'm rating four stars.

Liked it  a lot. Simple and easy. Marinated it for about an hour but will probably marinate it much longer next time. Also, could have used another spice or two. I may try celery salt or marjarom. We made chicken salad out of the left overs and it turned out great, so you may want to make enough to have some left over. Used The Royal Chenin Blanc from South Africa for the wine. Paired very well.

Definitely making this again. I didn't have the shallots or white wine so I ditched the onions and used some grape juice instead which made the chicken a funny purple color but the chicken was delicious and the company I served it for loved it. The arugula was a great touch. Planning to make it again to eat as a separate salad.
