We've been doing campfire pies for 40 years.  They are great.  This recipe is good but a little flat.  We usually add a small amount of cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple filling (to taste).  We've also used blueberry pie filling, lemon which is also good cold, raspberry and a filling of extra lean ground beef cooked and crumbled, seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper; cooked, crumpled bacon and shredded cheddar cheese.  Everyone who visits us requests these for dinner.  We even do this in the winter in our home fireplace.
