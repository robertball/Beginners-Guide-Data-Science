INCREDIBLE!!! took all of 15 mintues for me to make this. i was mad when i came home for fried chicken and we had run out of Durkee so i looked up this recipe. mmmmmmm. i'm not partial to vinegar and i didn't have cider vinegar so i used enough white wine vinegar that it wasn't overwhelming, turned out to be around the amount in the recipe. amazing, i'll never have plain fried chicken again.

For the reviewer who said this was not BBQ flavor, they are apparently not from the south.  Here in the south if you go to a BBQ restaurant this is exactly rthe kind of vinegar based BBQ that you get. I used this sauce with leftover KFC and it was great-the entire family loved it! Thanks for sharing!

I did not care for this at all. If you want BBQ flavor, (as the title reads) use real BBQ sauce.

Who's got leftover fried chicken? EVER?  I dredged my legs in flour, the chicken legs that is, and barely browned them in the pan, then sauced and baked them.  Yum-o!  Thanks.

This stuff is TASTELESS.  Unless you like a can of Campbell's Tomato Soup over your fried chicken, do as another poster suggested; just use BBQ sauce.

I was looking for a recipe for left over drum sticks. It was good recipe as a base. I added brown sugar and honey 1/2 of the apple cider vinegar, water & ketchup and it was good. I will do this again with different variations of ingredients.

It took over an hour to make these (I was pretty sure they were thawed before making this but maybe it wasn't all the way through!) and the vinegar taste was too strong!

This is a great way to use left over fried chicken. I did add some brown sugar and spicy mustard to the sauce. Sorry, can not give measurements, I didnt measure. Just added to my taste. Thanks for the idea.
