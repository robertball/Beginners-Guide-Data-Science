Love this salad!  I halved the amount of dressing and used a bag of brocslaw, and it was plenty for 4 people.  I also like to mix everything a few hours ahead except the seeds and noodles, which I add at the last minute so they stay crunchy.

Great recipe, I'll make it again for sure and I was asked for the recipe.  I made for a crowd so I doubled the broccoli (two large banded bunches) but kept the other ingredients the same and it was great. I would definitely reduce the dressing if not making so much. Can't wait to make it again! UPDATE:  I make this all the time now and it's always a hit.  You have to cut the oil by half and then its perfect.  I now use chopped red onion and also add dried cranberrys!

I have made this great salad three times since Xmas.  I prefer it made a day ahead.  It turns out good if you use the bagged brocslaw as well.  Thx for this recipe Jeri.

Very yummy!!  Instead of the white vinegar, I used half apple cider vinegar and half white wine vinegar. Also, I used the Oriental flavored ramen noodles. You really could make this a day ahead. That way the ramen noodles would absorb some of the dressing for extra flavor.

I made this last night for dinner and I absolutely loved it! It was definately a nice change from steamed broccoli. I did think it was kind of oily, next time I will reduce the dressing ingredients in half and add more broccoli. The texture was great the broccoli had a nice crunch to it but was not as tough as regular raw broccoli. At first I just thought it was an ok salad, but as the night progressed I had to keep going back to eat more, and even today I keep going into the kitchen for a bite here and there. I would recommend this to others. Enjoy!

I almost left out the sunflower seeds - boy would that have been a mistake, they make the salad! Only change was to use apple cider vinegar. Wonderful!

My husband and I absolutely loved this salad.  Yes, it was just as good the next day.  My kids are not fond of sweet salad dressings so they were not big fans.  All that to say, I don't care!  I'd make it again and again and can't wait until I have to bring a salad dish to the next family gathering.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

This was excellent!  I halved the oil as per other reviews and thought it was perfect.  I added a little shredded cabbage and some red onion and it was heavenly.  I made it to go with egg rolls and a sesame baked chicken and I thought it was the best thing on the plate!  I barely touched the rest of my meal.  The next day I tossed in the leftover chicken and it was even better!

I thought I'd try this recipe because it was very similar to oriental coleslaw made with cabbage, which I just love.  My husband, however hates cabbage.  This broccoli version was delicious.  I used one large bunch of green onions.  Quick and easy to make, and looked very colourful on the table.  I will be making this recipe again!

I use the full head of broccoli in this, but I also used the stems.  I cut away the flesh material on the outside of the broccoli stem and in the center it is soft and great for dicing up and throwing into the salad.  Also, I cut my carrots into thinly sliced circles because I wanted to give the appearance of using more vegetables.  I chilled the dressing first and then added the vegetables.  Also, I don't use all of the noodles from the Ramen, I think it makes it too crunchy and then when the dressing soaks in, too soft.

I've got a recipe simliar to this one but it calls for 1/4 cup oil, 4 Tbsp. sugar, 4 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, 1/4 tsp. pepper, 1/4 tsp. salt and the flavor packet.  I can't image using one cup of oil!  I also use a 16 oz. package of broccoli slaw mix, sometimes it's packaged as broccoli coleslaw.  I also add 1/2 cup slivered almonds, 4 Tsps. sunflower seeds and 4 green onions chopped.  Made this way it is VERY GOOD!!

The dressing was great, but it made too much.  I put about half of it in a jar to be used for future salads.

Addictive!  I used the oriental-style ramen and added diced red pepper for color as well as 2 TBSP tamari sauce, 2 TBSP minced garlic, 1/2 tsp ground ginger and red pepper flakes to taste.  The people I'm serving it to are big on lots of flavor and it surely won't disappoint!

Fabulous salad!  I used only a 1/2 cup of oil and added thinly sliced red cabbage.  Not only did it tast amazing, it looked beautiful. I was hoping to try the leftovers the next day... but there weren't any!

Excellent!  One of our favorite dishes at the Tokyo American Club is their Chinese chicken salad, and I have just found my own version, sans chicken!

I did make a few changes however: 1. I cut down the dressing in half (one whole cup of olive oil just seemed too much) 2. I didn't realize the chicken noodle I bought was pre-flavored, so no spice packet.  So I improvised and threw in some Japanese togarashi, some white pepper, some hondashi granules and some rotissarie chicken spice.  It was perfect!
3. I also marinated the salad ingredients in the dressing for one hour before topping with noodle and sunflower seeds.

This was the biggest hit at my dinner party. Easy to make and totally yummy. I used the oriental flavor package instead of the chicken so vegetarians could eat this too. Will make this again!

This is so tasty and easy. I had never had it before, but my Midwestern BF had, and he loved it. I've made it a couple of times now, and as odd as it sounds to use raw ramen, it's delicious! I like to use apple cider vinegar instead of regular white vinegar. It does make about 2 times too much dressing, so you could double your produce, or just halve the dressing ingredients and be fine. It keeps well in the fridge if you make too much and you can use it on other salads or veggies.

The family really liked this recipe.  I did half the oil and I am glad I did because it was plenty oily enough.  The ramen noodles and sunflower seeds gave it is a great crunch that everyone loved.  It was a tasty way to get broccoli into a meal.

I was pretty dubious about making this salad and ended up really impressed! I love cooked broccoli but never liked it raw, until this salad came along. The flavors and textures of the ingredients all go together really well for a light, tangy dish that is delightfully healthy. It's my new go-to salad.

I made this for a big family dinner, and everyone, EVERYONE asked for the recipe.  This was a great dish, I used only one bunch of green onions as it seemed like it would overpower the dish, and I used teriyaki chicken ramen noodles, and it was perfect.  Seems like it could be very versatile, I will try red cabbage in it, maybe chicken and raisins along with the seeds, maybe almonds instead of sunflower seeds, although the sunflower seeds were great.

Made this broccoli slaw this past Memorial Day and absolutely loved it, as did my family and guests. I did add a pinch of powdered ginger and a splash of sesame oil to the dressing to give it a more Asian flavor, and I added a pack of shredded cabbage & carrots to increase the amount. I will definitely make this again, thank you!!!

YUM YUM YUM! I brought this dish in for our potluck today and I have heard nothing but wonderful comments about it from my coworkers. Like the previous reviewers, I bought the bagged, shredded broccoli. This is so simple and easy to make!

I used half the sugar because I added sweetened dried cranberries. We thought this gave the broccoli a fantastic flavor but to be fair we're biased as we love this kind of salad when it's made with cabbage, too. I added some shredded cabbage, snow peas, and more scallions also just to fluff it up a little. Thanks for sharing!

Great, simple recipe. I've also used brocslaw, or just green and purple cabbage instead of broccoli. Chicken bouillon works also if you don't have a packet or ramen handy.

I did not bring any of it back home from the Pic-Nic so my taste buds were correct.  I used some broccoli coleslaw mix.  Actually one bag of it.

I'm voting with the majority here!!  Great flavor combination along with crunch.  Used just a little red onion (1/4 cup) chopped very fine, and added just a dash of garlic salt.  Both DH and I liked it very much and will be repeated often.  Thanks for the post, Jeri!

Excellent recipe! In defense of those that review but change the recipe - I only made minor changes because I didn't have some of the ingredients, and didn't want to drive to the store to get them. I used red onion instead of green (because I didn't have green), but followed the recipe other than that. I didn't mix it all together, but kept the broccoli mixture, ramen and seeds, and dressing separate and mixed at the last minute. My broccoli was from our garden, but was starting to flower, and this still tasted amazing. Thanks Jeri!!!!

This was really good, but like many others reduced oil by half.  To low carb it I used xylitol or sucralose instead of sugar, and I left out the noodles and added slivered almonds as well as the sunflower seeds (roast them both first, so much more flavour and crunchy...I just do it on low in a non stick pan on the stove). To flavour the dressing I added a bit of veggie or chicken broth powder, and some garlic/herb seasoning.  I have also added cabbage; very tasty, a keeper!

I cannot believe how delicious this was. I used cider vinegar because of preference and Splenda. I mixed it all together and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours and sprinkled sunflower seeds and peanuts on top prior to serving. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

I blanched the broccoli for 30 seconds, then shocked the broccoli in running cold water before cutting up.  Also, used 1/2 the oil. I was asked for the recipe.

Change someone's mind about broccoli!  That is how good this recipe is.  1 cup of oil is too much; I used 1/2 cup and it seemed perfect.  And you can easily alter the vegetable/dressing ratio to any liking.

Found it quite oily even after reducing the olive oil to 3/4 cup.  Despite this the people who ate it at the potluck loved it.  I would recomment 1/2 cup and not adding noodles and seeds until right before serving.  People liked the cruncy noodles

I love this and make it all the time. I hate broccoli and this is the only way that I can eat it. I love it this way! I use the shredded broccoli in the bag. The bag that I buy already has shredded carrots in it. When I take this to work I keep the dressing separate and mix right before serving. By the way, I use either chicken, veggie or oriental ramen noodles, just whatever I have on hand. This is very yummy, thanks for sharing!

This is a terrific salad that my husband and I both love.  I do find a cup of oil to be a bit much though, and usually only use about half the oil called for.  Other than that - fantastic!

Yummy! I made this minus the onions (the hubby hates raw onions), and kind of improvised on the amount of broccoli (got it from the farmers' market, so I had to guess at the amount for a "large" bunch), and I used baby carrots shredded in the FP (had to use them up), and I used one of those packets of almonds you find in the salad section, cause I didn't have sunflower seeds. I also nuked the broccoli very briefly and shocked it to take a little of the raw crunch out of it, especially since I used thin slices of the stalk. I did make the dressing to the letter, and since so many reviews wrote of how it was a bit much, I put it in a shaker carafe so I could control the amount for each portion. That was a good idea, since the dressing came out delish!!! It works great on this salad, but will work on any green salad, I think. I love a good broccoli salad, so I'll make this again in the warmer months, but that dressing recipe will be a regular in the rotation year round. It'll be great to have an alternative to the "make it out of the packet" stuff.

I have made this salad for a couple of years.  I use the packaged broccoli cold slaw mix and unsalted peanuts in addition to this recipe.  I also use less sugar and oil in the dressing.  It has become a family favorite.

This was pretty good I think I am used to cabbage coleslaw though, but this was a nice change. I didn't follow recipe exactly.... I left the oil out and used mayo instead to have a creamier slaw. I used 1 tablespoon apple cid. vin. and a bag of broccoli coleslaw and 1/2 a red onion. I didn't have the ramen noodles or the sunflower seeds so I left those out as well. Thanks for the starter brocslaw recipe!

Enjoyed this recipe a lot! Makes for a hearty salad.

I made it for a work Thanksgiving Pot Luck. Many of my co-workers asked for the recipe! ;-) I was flattered.

I also added red onion, Craisins and used half the oil.

These recipes are great, I usually use a version of this but with cabbage.  Also I added sliced almounds and sliced black olives.  Turned out great, will use a little less sugar next time was a little sweet for me but was great non-the less.  I did use two heads of broccoli and only used the florets and very little stems.

Very good. I used pre-packed broccoli slaw in the produce dept. Broccoli,carrots,red cabbage. I also used sunflower seeds and slivered almonds. Let sit overnight as this dish taste better every day that it sits. YUM

I brought this to our block party and it was great.  Great salad for a summer day because there's no mayo or sour cream, so no worries about leaving it out.

This can be oil-y.  I use four 12 oz. bags of pre-cut broccoli slaw, 1 cup oil, 1 cup vinegar, and 1 cup sugar.  I put the ramen in with the salad to soak up some flavor, but put the seeds on at the last minute.   This amount feeds a picnic of 12 with enough leftover to ravage for the lunch right out of the bowl the next day.

I lied to my kids and told them it cucumber instead of brocolli.  They loved it.  It's sweet, tangy with a slight crunch that is truly unique.  Will make again.  My husband took the leftovers for lunch the following day and said it tasted even better.

This was really good.  However, I soaked the noodles for 15 minutes in warm water, drained, and then added to coleslaw, as I don't like crunchy noodles.

Wow!!! This was delicious, even better than I thought it was going to be.  I did cut the broccoil in half and added about 1 1/2 cups of shredded cabbage.  Everyone loved it.  Even better the next day.  This may become my dish of choice to bring to potlucks.

I loved this dish.  My husband loved it.  Even my 13 year old son who is not fond of broccoli loved it, and begged me to make it again.  I've made the other broccoli salad with the mayo, sugar, raisins, etc., but it didn't get raves.  I did substitute chopped pecans for the sunflower seeds.  I was stunned by my family's reaction.  They hardly ever get excited by a salad or vegetable dish.  Try it!

Very tasty. I read the reviews before trying new recipes.  As suggested, I used 1\2 C olive oil and a 50/50 mix of apple cider and white wine vinegars. Salt, pepper & delicious.

I really love this salad.  I was looking for a broccoli salad that wasn't a mayo-based dressing, saw this one and tried it.  I did halve the dressing and since I didn't have any white vinegar I used a combo of apple cider and rice wine vinegar.  Works really well.  Thanks for posting it!

I  enjoyed the noodles raw because they add a nice crunch. But then they get soggy. I finally ended up cooking the noodles as normal and adding them after they are fully cooked. I brought it for Thanksgiving last year and people said it looked a little odd until they tasted it. It promptly disappeared on everyones plates and is being demanded again this year.  Yum!
I also try to let it sit over night to really soak up the sauce. and I found that cranberries are a fun addition.

We love this salad - even my two girls.  It is one of our favorites.  However, I did modify it a bit.  The first time we made it we had a lot of oil left in the bottom of the bowl.  After tweaking a few times we decided we like it best when we only use 1/4 cup olive oil, but keep everything else the same.

I made this recipe when company showed up at the last minute and I needed to scrape something together. Luckily I had everything on hand except the sunflower seeds, so I substituted with pine nuts. It was a HUGE hit. The seasoning mix was perfect--just enough brininess to offset the sweetness from the sugar. The textures from the grated carrots, celery, nuts, and noodles were great, as well. The nuts and celery were crunchy while the liquid gave the noodles and carrots just enough softness to provide some contrast. We served it with grilled salmon (marinated in a sweet Asian marinade) and the flavors complimented each other well. I will definitely make this dish again and recommend it as an easy veggie side that is different from the norm. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed!

Tastes so much better after it mellows for a day or so. I sort of followed the recipe as written, although followed others suggestions of using 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 apple cider vinegar. I also used 1/2 green onions and 1/2 red onions, and threw in a bunch of slivered almonds for crunch. I only had oriental ramen (instead of chicken ramen) and it tasted great! I also chopped up the broccoli stems, in addition to the florets. The stems added extra crunch, while the florets make it seem like a salad. Overall, am amazing mixture that I'm sure to make again and again. It's a great way to incorporate extra vegetables.

Very good. Turns out using Hot & Spicy flavor ramen is also good. I halved the amount of dressing and still thought it was a bit much.

Really good! As others noted this is probably way too much dressing though.  Either half the dressing or double the broccoli and carrots.  Really good flavors though,  nice combination of tangy, fresh,  and crunchy.

I made it as per instructions.   I just cut up a whole head of broccoli and did not use the slaw. I must say you really must marinate it overnight. Everything stays firm and not squishy but the oil seasoning doesn't begin to flavor the salad well until well after one hour.  I initially felt that one cup of olive oil was too much but it really needs it. The oil is taken up by the vegetables and it's not oily at all.   If u don't have sesame seeds on hand try slivered or sliced almonds. Either one works well. I thought this salad looked great but initially was not pleased but after marinating overnight it was quite delicious and pared very well with roasted chicken. Yum!!  I will do it again just halve the recipe if u don't want a big bowl of it.

I made this recipe for labor day. I left out the sunflower seeds and also used apple cider vinegar as someone suggested. OH AND.....I made twice the amount of broccoli, only used 3 "stems" of green onion instead of 2 bunches but the same amount of vinaigrette. Everyone LOVED it! The ramen noodles weren't crunchy at all.I thought it was a little too sweet...that may have been the apple cider though. My husband said he thinks the sweetness offset the raw broccoli harsh taste. everyone asked for the recipe!

Added more carrots. Easily make 1/2 the dressing. Good!

I added sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds.  Don't add the ramen noodles until just before serving.  That way they are still crunchy.

Oh, yum, yum, yum! I am excited to find this delicious recipe! It is unique, finely a coleslaw sort of deal without the traditional "cabbage" and mayonnaise. This is a must try and certainly something to keep in the recipe box.

Great recipe - thank you!  I made it as written except that I soaked the crushed ramen in the liquid rather than waiting until later.  The ramen remained relatively firm and the crunch of it and the broccoli (fresh from our garden) was quite enjoyable.  This will be a repeat recipe in our house.

Very good, but the dressing definately needs time to let the flavors mix.  It was much better after sitting overnight.

awesome salad! better the 2nd day. Have been making this salad for several years. Have reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and sugar to 1/4 cup and omitted the crushed noodles to accommodate dietary issues. Still very tasty and healthful salad. Always requested for potlucks.

I would easily give you 5 stars but, because I found it too oily I'm gonna give it a 4.  Although I loved the taste and I'm not a great lover of sweet dressings, I thought it was wonderful.  It was unfortunate that my whole family complained about "too greasy"  next time I make it (and there will be a next time) I'll just reduce the amount of oil.
and I'm gonna take it to my church's potluck because I know they'll love it as well.  Thanks for posting this recipe

Thought this was a great broccoli salad.  my hubby doesn't like mayo, so this was a great option!  I also didn't have the sunflower seeds, but it was fine with them omitted.  Even my 3 and 5 year olds liked it!  Thanks!

This is great.  I used a little bit less sugar just because Im not a sugar person.  I love green onion and I think it made the dish.  This will be on my menus forever.  Thanks for the receipt.

Very good! Followed the recipe, but next time will add more broccoli and maybe less oil as others had suggested.  Will also use less onion - seemed to overpower the taste a bit. Definitely a keeper!!

This is wonderful and very pretty!  The only change that I think is crucial is to allow the broccoli to marinate in the dressing for several hours or overnight, then add everything else 10 minutes before serving.  It is much better this way- although excellent as written too!

i guess i'm going against the grain with this one, but it had a strange taste to me.  it was probably just that the oil solidifies and that was strange. too much oil, too.  i didnt add all the dressing, and it's a good thing.  thanks for the try, though!!

The dressing for this recipe is awesome!  I like to add bacon to this salad and usually leave out the carrots.  I have used less sugar and it is still great.

Very similar to Napa cabbage salad, and i was craving it but didnt have the cabbage. This recipe was so good, and very filling. I didnt have any sunflower seeds so i used slivered almonds instead. A definate keeper and a slight variation from a family favourite.

Pretty good stuff.  I added celery since brocoli and carrots are so dense when served raw.  Very easy to whip up in the food processor.  I also like to add extra vinegar.

We loved this! Didn't need all the dressing and didn't use onions and it tasted wonderful. Will make it again.

Excellent! Next time I'll decrease the oil, I think two single geen onions is enough, two "bunches" would be too much. Tasted better the longer it sat in dressing. Will make many times again.

I definitely enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing is that my green onions were VERY strong for some reason in this recipe.  Perhaps, if I had rinsed them again AFTER cutting them up.  They seemed to overpower the other flavors.

FABULOUS recipe.  I do cut the ingredients in half for the dressing and it is still fine. Adding a few cashews is a nice touch.  We all agree it is our favorite slaw recipe.
