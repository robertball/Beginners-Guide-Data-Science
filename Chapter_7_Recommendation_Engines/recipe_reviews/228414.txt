My family LOVES cole slaw.  We like creamy kind, vinegar based, sweet slaws and this one!  Looking for a faceless recipe for the ‘February 2013 Faceless Frenzy’ I found that I had this saved in my recipe box.  I also had the personal version before it became published.  I mixed the dressing up in the morning so the flavors could blend all day.  I poured the dressing on about an hour before serving, and it is delicious.  I used a blend of half cabbage and half broccoli slaw.  The dressing is so good that my family commented that they would like it as a salad dressing.  I liked that the leftovers didn’t get soggy and were great packed in lunches the next day.  Elle, I’m thrilled to be the first to review and photograph your recipe.  It most definitely will be made in this house, again and again.  :o)

My parents lived in Junction City, Ks for many years and a trip to the Brookville Hotel was always a welcome family tradition.  My family has made this cole slaw for years and it's always just as good as the first time we had it--Lorraine R

This is quite good, and I can't even stand cabbage!  I needed to use up the rest of the head I bought for St. Patrick's Day, and the man loves coleslaw, so I decided to try this.  He really enjoyed it, and I was shocked that I liked it as well  :)

This is absolutely delicious! I love the creamy, sweet and sour taste of it. It reminds me so much of my very favorite coleslaw, made by a very famous Colonel who also made great fried chicken! I'm so glad I came across this recipe...I know our family will be eating a lot more cabbage salad because of it! Thank you so much for sharing this winner!

YESSS!  This recipe is to die for!  I make a slaw similar with pineapple and my husband only likes that but I would gladly trade that one for the Brookville recipe.  When we go to the Brookville restaurant I mainly fill up on the Slaw. Thanks for the recipe.

Our family LOVES this recipe.  All year round, it is a hit and so very easy.  The cream gives it a smooth buttery taste along with the snap of the vinegar and sweetness of the sugar.  Leftovers are rare but when we do have some, my husband always includes it in his lunch the next day.

My grandmother made like dressing using pure cream from raw milk.  I have been to Brookville Hotel when it was in Brookville, KS.  Our honeymoon night was at Brookville Hotel with their good chicken dinner. When I lived in Abilene I would order to go a chicken dinner for about 1/2 price of dining in.  Now I live in Marquette, KS nursing home.

I added some shredded red cabbage and 1 shredded carrot to give it some color.  It was good, but I didn't think it was much different from most cole slaw I've had.

Wonderful, but a little bland for me.  I added a tsp of onion powder and another of garlic powder.  Much better for me.  Garlic is a game changer for all recipes.

Top notch if you like a whipping cream base.  I like to make it a bit dryer than listed.  Tip - Make the topping and chill, chill slaw too then add to slaw at the last minute and serve with a bit more crunch.  Doesn't keep more than about a day.   But SOOOOO good!

I have used my grandmother's slaw recipe for years. Today I did not have one of the ingredients on hand so I searched and found this one. Everyone loved it! Sorry Mawmaw, I have a new and easier recipe now!

This is an excellent recipe!  It is best when served well chilled.
People would drive many miles to go the hotel and eat their chicken, and coleslaw.  Try it, and stick to the heavy whipping cream.  It doesn't hurt as another review mentioned, to add some color, but the basic recipe is superb.

Love this coleslaw ever since we at at the Brookville Hotel. We had driven more than 500 miles to get there and it was one of the most delicious meals of my life. Right up there with Michelin starred Paris restaurants. This coleslaw is perfection! Let it sit overnight in the fridge for the flavors to blend.

Thank-you very much Elle.  I love this dressing.  I made it as is and I prefer a little more vinegar, so I added some.  I made it today with broccoli slaw, cranberries, raisins, pineapple, coconut, and toasted almonds.  I will also try it as a base for a fruit or walldorf salad.  Gramma D.

Excellent Cole slaw, great holiday addition to the menu, quick and easy to make.  Shredded cabbage came in 16oz bags, so we used 32oz of cabbage, then doubled all other ingredients.

VERY watery - wondering if I used too much vinegar (which I happen to like a lot).  Liked the creaminess.

I love that this is one of the rare cole slaw recipes that don't call for mayonaise (I detest raw eggs).  I added shredded carrots and red onion for color.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, as it was a little on the sweet side for me.

This is the third time I have made this recipe. I like it very much and my husband asks for it. I don't change a thing. He used to take me to the Brookville Hotel in Brookville when we lived in Salina.

This is the only slaw recipe I use. It has been a family tradition for at least 50 years. Remember fondly trips to the Brookville Hotel as a child and on return trips home.

This is my first review ever, but I had to submit one because I am sooooo pleased with myself for accomplishing this! Also, this is my very first attempt at making coleslaw...but I wanted to use ingredients from my garden(also a first year for that as well!)  I used the "sauce" just as listed adjusting the amount of cream and vinegar to my liking-it was perfect, and I like that there isn't all that mayonnaise in it!  I used cabbage, broccoli, onion, banana peppers, from my garden...I did add store bought  carrots, and purple cabbage for color it was gorgeous and delicious!!!!!

We love this recipe..... My husband and daughter do not eat mayo and I like a creamy base..... this is the best of both worlds.... I could eat the dressing with a spoon..... I did add red cabbage and carrots.. but you could have fun and add anything....

I used to hate coleslaw.  The very thought of it made me gag.  Then I moved to Kansas and visited the Brookville Hotel with a group of friends, who insisted that this was different.  I put the smallest possible amount on my plate, anticipating that it would ruin the meal, but I was wrong, to my then-friend, now-husband's delight.  Thirteen years later, I'm still not a huge fan of most coleslaw, but this recipe makes it to our table quite frequently during the summer months.

This will be a favorite.  Creamy and smooth; doesn't have the bite that mayo-based slaws have.

The photo shows purple cabbage and carrots.  What happened to them in the ingredients list?  would love to try this if I knew how much to add.
