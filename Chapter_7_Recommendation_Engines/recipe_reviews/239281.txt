I thought I would like this more than I did.  It's good, but I feel like it's missing something.  I did elect to use fat free 1/2 & 1/2 rather than whipping cream to save some calories (and that richness is not what I felt was missing).  I also used chicken broth, rather than water + bullion.   I used fresh garlic since I had some on hand (and meant to skip the garlic powder, but forgot and added it, too).  After tasting, I added a dash of white pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper for a bit of a bite.  After eating my first small serving, I decided to use my immersion blender to see if that would help.  It did; it helped get a little more potato in each bite.  This is good, and I'm sure my gram who prefers foods on the blander side will love, and worth making if you're looking to use some leftover ham.  THANKS for the recipe!

needed a fast and easy recipe for Some extra ham. I really liked this version of ham and corn chowder, although I made one small change to the directions. After all was cooked, I removed about half of the soup from the pot and gave it a whirl with a stick blender. (then returned the rest to the pot). It made it a creamier soup . 
Also, in hindsight I would make sure it the bouillon  and/or the ham was reduced sodium ( and no real need for salting after the fact)

I used some whipping cream to thicken it up a bit and fresh corn from the garden. It was absolutely delicious. My husband devoured it and the baby ate 2 bowls.. definitely recommend this recipe it is outstanding.

Just like the restaurant but better cause I made it myself.  Everyone had second helpings and with some saltine crackers, it was the perfect meal on a cold night with friends.

I'll definitely make this one again!  Not bland at all (like I had read in other reviews).  I added more ham than the recipe calls for (probably 2-3 cups of leftover cubed ham), used canned corn (instead of frozen), and added a little celery.  I also used a few more potatoes and cubed them into smaller pieces instead of just quartering.  I used 2 bouillon cubes instead of 1 because of the volume of broth.  Overall, this is a great tasting, rich, comfort type soup.

To void bland, I added about 1/2 tsp ground cayenne and about 1/2 tsp ground black pepper. To avoid dairy, I used soy milk instead of the milk/cream, and thickened the chowder at the end with 1 tbsp mixed with 2 tbsp water. 
Delicious!

Outstanding. Used fresh corn rather than frozen cause it's in season.
