I don't intend this in an unkind way, but to the Reviewer, "FOOD," from September 15, 2007, I don't think it's fair to lower the ratings of a recipe because of expensive ingredients.  We have the responsibility to make that evaluation ahead of time and choose accordingly, not penalize the chef for offering us a gourmet recipe.

Very good. Maybe just not all together to my taste. It seems like for so many components it would have a lot more flavor, and I even threw in some cajun seasoning...But I do tend to like my food to kick me in the tastebuds!

I was complemented greatly when I created this meal. There are multiple problems though; in many situations when cooking a meal, you can only spend to a maximum budget - and because so many people don't appreciate seafood, I found that when I spent my budget buying ingredients for this meal, I didn't have enough left over to prepare a dinner for everyone that doesn't like seafood. Also, the ingredients needed are hardly the type you would expect to find around the house so it is awfully frustrating having to go out and buy a great amount of ingredients that, because you often have to buy in bulk, you end up with a kitchen full of items you no longer have any use for. Apart from this, as I said before, this is very original and a classic that is probably better off staying with fancy resteraunts who can afford such frustration. An excellent treat! Brava!

Although this is expensive, time-consuming and rather fiddly to make, the end result was tasty and impressive to look at. It was difficult to pummel the chicken breasts flat enough without causing them to disintegrate (I have since learned that you should place the chicken in between 2 sheets of seran before pummeling). I will make this again but next time omit the crawfish and use mushrooms and parmesan to the cream and mushroom sauce.

Excellent recipe! It has a lot of flavour. Followed recipe exactly, except I didn't have any heavy cream so I made my own. Simply with egg whites and sour cream. The second time I made this recipe I used milk, and turned out even better! Definitely recommend this to anyone.

I may make again, but it was a "busy" dish.  If I were to make it again I would change step 5 and first make a roux because there was a lot of liquid and no real creamy sauce.

We did a smothered and covered version of the recipe. It is a keeper. We made a few changes but not much. 
Thanks for the new supper idea. It was delicious.
