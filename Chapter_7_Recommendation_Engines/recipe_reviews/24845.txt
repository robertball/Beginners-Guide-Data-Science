Tastes weird and it comes out messy looking. It's not possible to keep the omelet in one piece while folding it over an inordinate amount of chopped apples. The thing comes out like a pile of scrambled eggs with a pile of apple on it.

Ok I made this second time tihs weekend with Cortland apples .... it was a bad idea!! The stuff just didn't taste the same!! Make sure you have RED DELICIOUS available. .. I won't change the rating since it was really good last time I made it, but beware, the type of apples you use make a huuuge difference!!!

A pretty good omelet with a hint of sweetness. I added cinnamon when cooking the apples and used milk instead of cream in the egg mixture, both of which seemed to work fine.

Despite the fact I got distracted and burned the omelet a bit, this was pretty good. I used Red Delicious apples, and sprinkled them with a little cinnamon during the saute process. I'm not sure if tart apples would work as well, but I'd be willing to try and see. I just cooked the omelet, folded it in half, slid it on to the plate, then topped it with the apples. Worked great. Anyway, this made a nice change to the usual cheese-loaded omelets. Thanks, Sara!

Delicious!  For a healthier version, I sauted the apples in coconut oil and added cinnamon.  I then substituted water instead of cream in the eggs and left out the salt, pepper, and sugar.  I cooked the omelet in goat butter, and at the end, I drizzled raw honey over the top and sprinkled with fresh pecans.  I will definitely be making this again!

I'm eating this right now and it is YUMMY! I spread the top of the omelet with apple butter but otherwise didn't change a thing.  :)

The egg part of the omelet is very "Bready" because of the heavy cream. Didnt like its consistency. Kinda bland flavor because the apples aren't prepared to be sweet. I've had apple omelets before and the apples were sweeter, I believe they were almost carmelized and THAT was divine. Good recipe if you prefer an apple omelet that does not tase like apples or omelets

This is a great omlet/crepe.  One doen't fold it in half.  One flips it over.  Delicious!
