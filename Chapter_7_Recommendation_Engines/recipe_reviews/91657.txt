This is fabulous.  I followed recipe as is; made a day ahead, and as per recipe, did not add the cooked bacon and chives until I was reheating right before serving.
Definately use frozen vegies -- better flavor and texture.  I highly recommend this for Thanksgiving buffet; easy, very nice colors, and very tasty -- and I think even picky eaters would be surprised if they give it a try.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have any cream, so I used evaporated milk and a pat of butter.  It was so easy to make, and tasty and filling- even the kids cleaned their plates.  Will be making again- thanks!

Very good. I used can lima beans and corn because that is what I had on had on hand and it worked well.

This was delicious!  I was skepical at first because the succotash of my childhood was very sweet, and I was worried this would not live up to that.  But it was better!   I'm a college student, who's mother stocked the pantry, so I had canned limas and corn which I used.  I drained the limas but not the corn because the corn juice was sweeter, and since I wasn't cooking the limas in water, I figured I needed some more liquid.  I also had no heavy cream so I used whole milk, less than the half cup called for.  I didn't have the thyme or the chives, so for another flavor I sauteed some red bell pepper in the bacon fat when I was doing the onions.  I was delicious, all my college friends loved it.  And for someone who is not very experienced at cooking, it was an easy recipe to make a success.

Okay, this was downright delicious. Must've been the bacon fat and half/half because I've never tasted beans and corn to be so savory. I might try one of the lighter versions the other reviewers suggested next time to make it a little healthier. If you don't care about that though, follow the recipe to the T!   Also, I used edamame instead of lima beans - just what I had in the house - and it was really good.

This was very good.  My cream did not reduce much, so it's a good idea to mix before scooping to coat the veges.

I love succotash, so I knew I would love this.  This is great with the fresh thyme, but I don't really care for it with the dried...it's just a bit too strong.  However, the recipe can be altered as you see fit, too.  I first made this for Thanksgiving a couple of years ago, and to my surprise, even those who professed to hating lima beans (butterbeans if you are a Southerner!), loved this dish.  I usually use half and half instead of cream.  It works well, too.

This is a delicious recipe.  I usually make it as written and it is loved by all.  While I typically enjoy tinkering with recipes, I can't improve on this one.  My husband, daughter, picky grandsons and friends all devour it and return for seconds.  It's fabulous and I really encourage everyone to try it.  Oh, OK, I often reduce the calorie count by substituting some of the cream with fat free half and half.

Very good, I used sausage instead of bacon, but I felt like it needed another spice to make it great.  I will still make it again.

I have a fond nostalgia for succotash, and was so pleased to find this recipe for an updated version when searching for one recently in advance of a southern themed supper.  I love the combination of flavors and textures.  I've made it several times now, and have used dried thyme in lieu of fresh; have omitted the chives by mistake:  still delicious.

I made this for a gathering, doubled the recipe, and it was gobbled up! I made it ahead by a couple of hours and kept it warm in a 170 degree oven until I had to go.  Really good comfort food recipe! I was unable to find the baby lima beans, and used regular size, and it worked fine. I also substituted green onions for the chives. Thanks for the great recipe!

I needed a vegie recipe for 120 people for a dinner I was catering at church and this was delicious.  I omitted chives and used powdered thyme instead(couldn't find fresh) I sprinkled the bacon on top after it was poured into trays.  YUM!!

This was my second time making this.  The first time I went exactly by the recipe and loved it.  The only change I made this time was to use half and half rather than the heavy cream.  Used this as a bed for some bourbon braised short ribs.   Totally a hit!!!

OMGOSH!!! I (& my ENTIRE family) absolutely LOVE this recipe.  Super easy. Delicious & filling.  My personal opinion, make it the day before & add chives & bacon while reheating.  The flavors just soak up in the refrigerator.  I've got TWO people in the family that HATE lima beans & gobble this up.

Pretty good.  I added about about a tablespoon of flour after the onions were done to create a roux.  This made the cream get nice and thick.  Also subbed edamame beans for lima beans.

I tried to cut a little fat & a few calories, so used turkey bacon & substituted fat free half & half for the heavy cream & added about a tablespoon of reduced fat cream cheese so it turned out a little runnier than I'm sure the original recipe is, but it was still delicious. I don't care for Lima beans so also substituted those for frozen shelled edamame, which took a few minutes longer to cook. I topped this with seared scallops with lemon, salt & red pepper.

I really liked this recipe and many of my guest said that it was their favorite dish.  I actually made it the night before and finished it up while the meat was resting.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

This is so good.  I make it vegetarian with Morningstar veggie bacon on top. I like to add salt and pepper and just use veggie boullion and water to cook the veggies.  Delicious.

I undercooked my beans, but even then... it was fantastic. 

I don't know that the cream was as thick as I'd like, but I worry that any thicker and the dish would become a 'heavy' dish. Flavors were just like husband remembers as a kid (native southerner). Will DEFINITELY be making again!

This was delicious. I added a chopped red bell pepper and sauteed it with the onion. I also added a few splashes of chicken broth with the cream (was using it with another dish that I was making) for a little bit of depth. My husband said that the bacon really "made the dish" and my two year old gobbled it up as well. I'll definitely be coming back to this recipe again.

I have been making this succotash for Thanksgiving for the past 5 years.  I follow the recipe as is.  Everyone in my family loves this recipe.  It also is just as delicious left over.

My father requested succotash as part of his birthday dinner. He can't have pepper but otherwise I made as directed. Made succotash lovers out of everyone at the dinner table when I'd thought he'd be eating it alone.
