To be honest I didn't think this would be that good. I had most of the ingredients and I needed something that was fast, not spicy (husband) and would use some of the kale I had in the fridge. I made some changes based on groceries on hand. I used 1# Johnsonville sweet Italian bulk sausage, subbed mini penne for gemelli, used 1 can of evaporated 2% milk and used garlic granules in place of fresh. It turned out waaay better than I had hoped though I used only 1/2 of the cooked pasta, there was just not enough sauce for  all of it. Also didn't have a fresh tomato so I drained a can of diced tomatoes and used 1/2 in place of the tomato.
Though some of the recipes I've tried lately were duds, this was worth my time and I will make it again so thanks for the post.

Hubby and I enjoyed this. I used Italian turkey sausage and orzo since that's what I had on hand. I only had 4 oz. of pasta, and that was plenty for the dish, I wouldn't use the full amount listed in the recipe because we prefer things a bit saucier. I also didn't need the reserved pasta water; next time I would just add extra milk if needed. Kale is a bit tough, and even though I cooked it longer than stated, I would cook it even longer next time to help reduce the chewiness. But this was a nice one-dish meal. The combination of flavors was really good.
