I made this recipe because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and was in a pinch to make dinner. Overall, I wasn't too impressed. It wasn't bad....it's just that the individual flavors didn't combine well in the dish. Probably won't make this again. Sorry!

I love this recipe!  It's so quick, easy and delicious.  You will definitely need the amount of oil that the recipe calls for. I also find it best to use a can of petite diced tomatoes, rather than stewed tomatoes.  Also, the parmesan cheese definitely finishes it off nicely.  This is a recipe I use regularly and my family loves it, especially my five year old!  Thanks!

This was good!  I have been to authentic Italian restuarants and had chunks of salmon in a tomato sauce.  This was along those lines.  I did not use the exact amounts listed in this recipe, but "eyeballed it" and adjusted where I though appropriate.  I definitely did not use that much olive oil.  Probably only 2 Tbsp.  I also used only one can of albacore tuna, and I think the kind I used was key.  I bought the BumbleBee Prime Fillet albacore tuna for the first time and it was so much better than regular albacore tuna!  Not fishy or oily at all.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  I also used a little less oregano and seasoned with salt and pepper.  I am surprised she left salt and pepper out of the recipe.  I also did not add the Parmesan cheese.  Next time I may experiment by adding peas or capers.  Portion-wise, it only made two servings because I like a lot of sauce with my pasta.  Overall, this was a very quick and healthy weekday meal.  I will make it again!

Added canellini and only used one can of tuna. Used diced tomatoes. Pretty darn good for a meal when you are broke!

The hub and I were a little leery of trying this recipe but since we had the ingredients on hand, we did.  It was very good and though we thought the tuna might overpower the flavor, it was perfect.  Served it with some crusty garlic bread and it was delicious! Will make again, and may try with crab as suggested on another review.

This was very satisfying, but maybe needed a little more flavor - still, for a pantry meal, it was not only different but it was good.  I used penne and subbed red wine because that's all I had.  I added a good pinch of red pepper flakes as it tasted kind of bland, and also the sauce was very thin.  Next time I think I'll add a tbsp or so of tomato paste to thicken it up and give the sauce more body, and maybe some capers or olives (which I think would go great with the tuna) and basil.   This would also be a great dish to add some beans to if you were looking for something very filling!  Pretty good as is, but lots of potential in this one!

I loved this sauce. I sauted garlic, onions, diced tomatoes, then added wine, 1 can tomato sauce, 2 pouches of white tuna and extra seasonings including salt and pepper. No cheese at all. This is a great recipe for Advent or Lent when you are fasting.

I followed the recipe quite closely although I sauted the onion by itself first.  A tasty recipe but it might benefit from a touch of chili.  If anyone tries chili please report back!

I loved this recipe. I added cilantro for topping and substituted canned crab for the tuna and it turned out delicious! I plan to make this again soon.

Excellent.  Added some frozen broccoli to the tuna sauce near the end, then tossed in cooked spaghetti.  Wonderful.

I didn't think it had enough sauce, next time I will cut the amount of pasta by half. I also added dried basil, I thought the sauce was too bland with just oregano and thyme. I used whole grain spaghetti to make this healthier.

This was easy and pretty tasty - the only thing that I changed was that I added about 1/3 of a cup of parm cheese to the sauce and I doubled the diced (not stewed) tomatoes. Great week night meal! Will definitely make again.

I thought this was okay. It could use some punching up. Perhaps some briney, salty black olives. 

I was surprised at how well the tuna worked.

Great use of things I had on hand.  I was surprised by how mild the tuna was.  I added salt, pepper, crushed red pepper as suggested by other reviewers.

I tried it and it didn't go so well with the roommates. It wasn't bad but it wasn't a hit either.
