I like the crumb topping and the addition of flax seeds-I am always looking for ways to incorporate the healthy benefit of flax into my diet.  A moist and delicious cake-I think my photo is a little blurry from the steam since it was fresh out of the oven.  Very good.

Very nice moist coffee cake, I am a big apple fan, as well as a coffee cake fan.  The only thing I did different is I also added a little bit of fresh nutmeg.  But, I also think that apples, cinnamon and nutmeg are a good threesome

02-05-16 ~ Needing to use up some apples, I came across this recipe. I baked it in the morning and took it to school while it was still warm. Oh my, my colleagues loved it! It was done baking at the 40 minute mark, and flipped out the bundt, nicely. I did sub Greek plain yogurt for the sour cream, as that is what I had on hand. A nice, moist coffeecake that was a hit!

Made this today for a church breakfast. Turned out lovely and everyone enjoyed it. Dense and flavorful like an old time apple streusel. Added a hint of cloves to the oat crumble(yum). I also cooked it in my regular scalloped bunt pan. When it cooled a bit, I turned it upside down on a plate like any other cake, then turned it back right side up on another plate so the streusel topping was on top. It was very pretty! Thanks for recipe. Leah M

This recipe works well as a bunt, except the crumble topping is too dry.  When I make it again, I will put the crumble in the bottom of the pan to absorb more moisture from the cake instead of leaving it for the topping.  As I only had 2 apples I added in ~1 cup of apple sauce - splitting it between the cake mixture and the centre layer of apples. And we had ground flax (which is more digestible).

Delicious!  I didn't have oats and flaxseeds on hand so used  a generous cup broken walnuts and 1/2 c packed brown sugar. That gave it a little crunch and was quite delicious.

This is very tasty and moist, but the recipe is fiddly.  I did substitute apple pie spice for half the cinnamon, and chopped pecans for the flax seeds.  I was worried because it seemed more like dough than batter, but it came out okay.  I used two 8 x 8 disposable foil pans and the recipe filled them nicely.
