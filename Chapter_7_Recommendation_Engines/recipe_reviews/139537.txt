To speed up the chilling time, boil only 2 cups of water. In the meantime, refrigerate 6 cups of water and the lemon juice. (Or put several cups of ice in a large measuring pitcher, then add cold water to the 6 cup line.) 
After the tea bags have steeped, dissolve the sweetner in the hot tea, then add the tea mixture to the lemon-water mixture. Continue to refrigerate till chilled.

I used regular sugar. This tea was absolutely perfect. I drank a whole cup still warm and loved it. (Thanks to the previous reviewer for reviewing it, had I not seen your review, I would have never made it!) The orange pekoe was absolutely perfect.

Excellent! I tweaked the recipe ever so slightly by using the ingredients here in my house. Instead of using Splenda, I used 1 cup of white sugar and instead of using half cup of lemon juice, I squeezed the juice from one and a half lemons and used the other half to slice and drop straight into the tea.   This is a PERFECT drink. Make it, you'll be happy you did :)

I used 3/4 cup white sugar instead of Splenda and it was perfect.  I love the bottled Arnold Palmer tea by Arizona but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners. This tasted very similar.  I used Lipton bags which are Orange Pekoe.  It takes 2-3 lemons to get 1/2 cup of juice fyi.

Good! Kind of like half lemonade, half iced tea.  Not too sweet, which makes this a particularly refreshing thirst-quencher.

Perfectly refreshing!  I love the lemony flavor and the sweetness of this iced tea.  It was great for a hot day and just what my husband needed after cutting the grass.

Love the flavor balance in this recipe, the freshness of the lemons (from my tree), and the little pick-me-up of the mild caffeine from the tea. I used "Lady Grey" tea from a gourmet tea shop. It has a lot of flavor notes, but orange is prominent. I put 2 heaping tsp in a tea ball and let it steep for an hour. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly & the result was wonderful!  Good and strong -- holds up when poured over ice. I included the lemon pulp with my lemon juice & that was good. Next time will add a sprig of spearmint from the garden as another reviewer suggested.

I always like ice tea, I've tried a few home made ones but never like them. I'm not a tea drinker and I would taste the tea and didn't like it. But wow I love this one, but all I had in sweetners was stevia, all I used was 1 tbsp. and it was plenty next time I might use a bit less. thanks for sharing this recipe

Very good! I used two bags Red Rose, one orange herbal (not pekoe), and one blueberry white tea. I suspect that almost any combo will taste great. The fresh lemon really adds a crisp kick. I only steeped for maybe 15-20 minutes, since most teas will get bitter after too long. A small pinch of baking soda will help cut the bitterness, too.

This is a great recipe and using Splenda makes it guilt free for me.  I made it as written and it was sweeter than I personaly like so I will use less sugar and mor lemon juice next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I loved the orange/lemon combination. I am always looking for new low-cal beverages, and this was really refreshing and totally hit the spot! To be honest I didn't use a full 1/2 cup of lemon juice, though (I just squeezed the juice out of 1 VERY JUICY lemon). I will definately be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

A previous reviewer is quite correct in that the tea itself- orange pekoe - is just a black tea, perhaps a bit milder than English Breakfast Tea.
No Splenda on hand so I took another reviewer's suggestion and used 1/2c. granulated sugar. I had full intention of using the amount of lemon juice in the recipe but decided to add a bit at a time and quit after 1/4 c.  Perfect balance.  I'll be making this tea up regularly this summer.  Thanks for the recipe.  Much better than the dry mixes on the market.

I find this a bit too bitter.  I prefer a bit off the boil water and 10-15 min steep.  I also like it strong so i use 3 jumbo bags, at least, per 1/2 gallon of water.

I've made this about a dozen times now and I'm a huge fan. I did follow the advice of a couple of commenters to improve it a bit.
First, I only boil 2 cups of water
Second, I only steep the tea bags for about 15 minutes and don't squeeze them when you take them out- that releases bitter alkaloids. If you want stronger tea flavor either add another bag or 2 or reduce the amount of water added in step #4.
Third- once you remove the tea bags, add the Splenda or do what I do and add 1/2 cup Splenda & 1/4 cup cane sugar. If adding sugar- return to a boil for a minute to completely dissolve the sugar
Fourth- this step should be done at the same time as step 1- put 6 cups of water in the fridge to cool. To cool it even faster, replace 2 of the cups of water with ice
Finally, once the tea/Splenda/sugar mixture has cooled a bit add to the chilled water along with the 4 ounces of lemon juice and return to the fridge until well chilled. This time of year (January) where I live (North Dakota) placing it on the cement floor of my garage for a couple of hours usually cools it to the point it's almost slushy.

This was my most delicious batch of iced tea yet, and I will definitely be making it on a regular basis.  I used sugar instead of Splenda, because we had none on hand.  I used 1/2 cup of sugar for the 8 cups of water and it was just sweet enough for me.  Also, I did not measure the amount of lemon juice, but juiced 1/2 a lemon and this was also the perfect amount of tang for my taste.

I cut the recipe in half to try it. I thought this tasted a lot like the bottled tea drinks except they probably use citric acid and not real lemon juice. If that is the taste you are going for you may like this. To me it was a bit too tart and little too much Splenda after taste. Next time, I will go for the real stuff, I think, as little as I drink it sweetened.

I loved it!!!!!
It was the perfect balance between sweet and tart.
I do suggest using white sugar instead of Splenda, it tastes more pure. I also added the tea bags to 2 cups of boiling water while 6 cups chilled in the fridge. Then, the chilling time was 15 minutes.
I highly recommend this recipe!!

Great summer refreshing drink, other than using sugar in place of the splenda.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for sharing!

Whoops, just realized I reviewed this recipe on a different recipe, one for strictly lemonade! I left it there anyways with a sentence apologizing, lol!
I made this today using my Mr. Coffee 2 1/2 quart  Ice Tea Pot. 
( not an advertisement ??) Since my sweet spot with tea in this I used 5 Lipton tea bags, which I take out of their pouches and put in a filter loose, and ran 6 cups  filtered water through the ice tea maker. 
I put the 3/4 cup Splenda  in next so it could dissolve in the hot water, added the remaining 2 cups filtered water and 1/2 cup lemon juice in.  I tried it warm (couldn't wait!) and even hubby said it was great! We are used to buying the jugs of Arizona Arnold Palmer that are reduced calorie, because the calorie free is bitter, so this is a fantastic replacement. Cheaper and always available. Thank you!

This recipe is simple enough. Makes for some really good lemon iced tea. The only thing I did different was use actual sugar instead of splenda and did 1 cup. Great tea, very refreshing. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy! I used more tea bags though. This would be far too weak for us (and probably for most folks) if you only use 3 tea bags for 8 cups of water. I ended up using 8 tea bags because we pour our tea over ice, which of course will water it down as the ice melts. This way, you have a nice, flavorful glass of tea even with ice added. The lemon and sugar amounts were spot on and made for a delicious iced tea!

I like a stronger tea flavour so I added an extra tea bag. Used regular sugar. Very refreshing.
