I was expecting this to be a lot better, judging by all the positive reviews. It was rather bland. I followed the recipe to the letter (as I always try to do before rating a recipe), and came up with a soup that was just fair. I think it needed more tomatoes for body and taste, and I'll agree with one reviewer who thought the thyme was a little much. I had to add lots of salt before I could eat it and enjoy it. I noticed after reading over the reviews that more often than not if a review got 5 stars, the reviewer had added something to the recipe (e.g., potatoes, garlic, in one instance a ham bone!). I think this is one of those recipes that's good to have as a base to work from, then alter to personal tastes.  I'll use this recipe again, but not without some tweaking.

* After the minestrone sat overnight, the flavor improved dramatically. Still not the five-star recipe I'd like, but the improvement was enough that I will bump it up to four stars.

I made this soup for a family gathering.  I scaled it to serve 20 people and it turned out very well.  I'm a strict vegetarian so I had to make something good to impress the meat-eaters of the group. . . all of them asked for the recipe.

I tried to take a lot of advice from the user reviews before cooking and made some changes:

1.  The scaled recipe called for 5 leaks. I subsituted one leak for an onion.  So if using the current scale, probably half and onion and one and a half leak would suffice.

2.  I sauteed one clove of garlic in the olive oil before adding any vegetables. Again, with scaling, you might not need that much.

3.  I couldn't find any cannellini beans so I used kidney beans.  My italain stepmom laughed at me, but it turned out good, so she stopped laughing after she tasted it.

4.  I did let it sit in the fridge overnight before serving.  It really added a LOT of flavor.

5.  I think the stock you choose is probably the most important part of this recipe.  I was fortunate enough to have really good vegetable stock.  Can't remember the brand or I would share it, sorry.

6.  I didn't put as much thyme in as called for.

I served it with another recipe from allrecipe's:  Great Garlic Bread, submitted by Noelle.  Good stuff.

This is a great recipe.  Like others I added a bit more... spinach, carrots, zucchini, and italian seasoning instead of the thyme.  I also added just a few tablespoons of tomato puree and canned tomatoes instead of fresh.  Also threw in a bay leaf of two and a part of a parmesan rind to richen the flavor.   Also, very important to add the beans.  I made it in two batches, and only put the beans in one as hubby is not a fan.  The bean juice added a great dimension to the broth.  Next time will definatly add it to all and just let him pick out the beans!

I took the advice of the other reviews and added 8 tablespoons of tomato puree, some garlic and a little fresh oregano that I had on hand.  I have to tell you this minestrone soup is fabulous and my family loved it!  I can't wait to see how it tastes tomorrow after sitting overnight!  My husband's only complaint was there wasn't enough beans.  If that's the only complaint I'd call this a sure addition to our family recipes.  Thank you Michelle!

This recipe is awesome. My husband is a vegetarian so I'm always looking for new and good meatless recipies. This soup is very easy to make and it truly is wonderful. I have made it at least 6 or 7 times already for us and family, everyone loves it. The only thing I added was potatoes because I love them so much, other than that I stick with the recipe and am very happy to have found it. If you like minestrone soup, one must at least give this recipie a try. Yummy!!

This is a fantastic fail-safe recipe, you really can't go wrong no matter how you make it or how you change it! Unfortunately, I had to give it only 4 stars because my husband didn't like it as much as me-- his complaint was similar to all the other reviews, "it's kinda bland". I think it really comes down to your personal tastes and how you like your minestrone soup-- THIS SOUP HAS A LIGHT BROTH AND IS HEAVY ON THE VEGGIES. If, you're like me and you like your minestrone like that, then this is the soup for you!

Changes I made to adapt to our own tastes: sauteed veggies in one crushed clove of garlic; I used closer to 2 quarts of vegatable broth since the noodles do soak up a lot of the liquid (can adjust broth to your own tastes); used one 14.5oz can of diced tomotoes stewed in garlic, oregano, & basil for more flavor and added one fresh diced tomoato; used about 1/2 tsp. dried thyme since I didn't have fresh thyme laying around (originally used full tsp. but found it overwhelming and had to siphon off some while it was cooking); and since my hubby likes noodles in his soup, I used 1 cup whole wheat noodles (they look white like regular pasta when cooked so no one is the wiser) and cooked them before adding them to the soup so they wouldn't suck up so much of the liquid (they came out to about 2 cups once cooked). Overall, it turned out quite balanced-- you get a little bit of everything you throw in there with each scoop.

Once you taste this soup all others will pale in comparison. (i.e resturant, can, etc)  The first time I made it we were stationed overseas so I had to subsitute some fresh veggies for canned.  AS LONG AS you use a fresh leek you will get good results.  If you are able to make it exactly as intended it will be outstanding!! Enjoy :0)

Great soup -- everyone who tries it demands the recipe.  Improved by adding a clove of garlic IMO.  Also like to add some shredded cabbage.

I opted to try this but will stick with my other minestrone recipe which purports to be authentic Italian.  For that, you add a potato, green cabbage (I often omit, doesn't make a difference), 2 zucchini, and you saute your veggies in stages (longest cooking first) in a 50/50 mix of butter and olive oil.  Use canned tomatoes, it's fine.  Also add salt, rosemany, black pepper and basil AND use beef stock/broth (unless you're vegetarian).  The simmer for 1.5 hours, add the beans (no pasta) and simmer another 30-40 mins.  It's a great recipe for a chilly fall day.

Great basic recipe you can tweak according to personal taste and what you have on hand. Personally, we prefer it with kidney beans, but cannelli beans are pretty good. I cut way back on the thyme, and usually use Italian seasoning. Fresh minced garlic and a couple of bay leaves add some nice flavor too. Thanks, Michelle!

I'd read on another nutrition site that kids are supposed to eat 1/2 cup (or one light bulb full) of veggies a day and used this recipe to try to up their veggie intake. I almost dropped my fork in shock the 1st time I saw my picky 4 yr old devour this soup. I began making it once a week w/ the following changes: Add spinach, subbed chicken stock/broth, add garlic to oil before other veggies, add can of chick peas for extra protien. This also freezes REALLY well, I like to divide into tupperware and freeze for lunches! Thanks so much!!!

This minestrone comes closest to my Italian Grandmother's...lots of fresh vegetables, in a light and bright broth.

I made this today for a group of 14.  I modified it a bit by sauteeing the vegetables in the grease from a 1/4lb of smoked pancetta (you could also use bacon).  Crumble up the meat and add it to the soup in the end.  (yum)  I also added chicken broth as well as vegetable stock, as my grandmother used to.  Serve with fresh grated romano and/or parmesan cheese.

If you prefer a truly vegetarian minestrone, this recipe is great as-is!

Easy to make soup. I usually leave out the leeks and add a diced onion instead. I also prefer orzo to macaroni.

Best one I have found so far! Very light, just how real minestrone supposed to be. To other raters who like more tomatoes or more of a thicker soup, please go ahead and modify it. But please dont say this is not good. This recipe is just perfect!

This recipe was very good. I loved all the vegetables. Everyone in my family really liked it, and we have had a lot of different types of minestrone. This definitely ranks at the top. The only thing I would change is the seasoning, I added extra because I thought it would be bland and it turned out to be a good move.

WOW!  What yummy soup.  I am going to make it again tonight.  I even added a little umph to it by adding some of my homemade pesto - it made the soup a little more robust.  Definitely going into my permanent collection - thanks.

spending time in Italy, this recipe brought me right back to dining on a piazza. I always add a bit more veggies than called for, and a can (or fresh cooked) garbanzo beans, too. Used organic chicken stock for more flavor, a can of tomato paste, a can of diced Italian tomatoes, plus more fresh. No one in Italy uses elbow, so instead I used mini farfalle, or orzo is nice, too. Very flavorful- recommend topping with a strong Italian cheese like pecorino romano. very delicious, and very authentic.

This turned out absolutely delicious, and I am a hard one to please relative to soups. I made some minor changes to the version I created. 
Revisions:
• 2 cloves of fresh garlic, minced added to the end of the saute (It's Italian, right?!? I mean you gotta have some garlic!!)
• 2 cups canned tomato sauce & 1 cup water with only 1 qt vegetable stock.
• 1-1/2 tsp sugar (to compensate for the bitterness of the fresh tomatoes not being in season).
• Substituted garbanzo beans for cannellini.
• Used 1 tsp dried thyme in place of fresh.

YUMMMMY!

I've never even had minestrone soup, so this was my first attempt at making it. And while I have nothing to compare it to, I really enjoyed this.  It was easy to make and was very comforting on a cool evening.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using a can of great northern beans instead of cannellini.  However, I don't think that would alter the end outcome too much anyway. Served mine with a crusty roll and a tossed salad.

Have had much better soups. A great addition to minestrone which adds alot of flavor is fresh fennel.  Next time I will saute fennel and garlic, skip the thyme and see if that improves the broth. I have used fennel and garlic in other minestrone recipes and love the flavor - thought I would try this per the recipe before I made changes. Too bland as it is.

This was very good, but only had a tiny bit of pasta. I will increase it next time. But overall the flavor was nice!

Wow!  That sums up this recipe.  It's great!  I didn't have leeks so I didn't put them in and it was still good.  I used small shells instead of macaroni and served with garlic bread.  The next time I may try to do this in my slow cooker and let it simmer all day.

Yummy!!!! This soup uses a bunch of items from my garden and it is soooo tasty. In addition to the directions, I added some Italian seasoning and used the spiral shaped noodles (took a little longer to cook).

This is definitely a keeper!! Thanks Michelle!!

Great hearty soup (both the the night of and the next day!).  I've frozen a bunch so hopefully that works out well for me.  I didn't "change" the recipe at all (aside from adding a clove of minced garlic), but I did use canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh (primarily because I'm about 12 months pregnant and easy is my M.O. these days!).

For those having troubles finding cannellini beans in the store - look for "white kidney beans"...that's what I found most of the major brands carrying.

Great soup. I did make substitutions but that's the sign of a good, basic recipe. It can take altering and still be good. We used chopped onion instead of leek; canned tomatoes instead of fresh; kidney beans instead of green or cannellini beans; and more pasta than called for. Regardless, my daughter and I really liked it.

4 stars as written, 5 with changes! Next time, I'll quadruple pasta to 1 cup, and add a little extra liquid (tomato sauce?) to make up for it. Also needs more seasoning - parsley, basil, oregano.

Note: The 5 stars includes many changes.  I added more veggies — more carrots, more celery, added potatoes, used canned and fresh tomatoes, a portebello mushroom and added a can of tomato paste. I used more pasta and about doubled the amount of spice, including fresh oregano and basil, not to mention four cloves of garlic. Also, with all this, I doubled the amount of broth.  And let me say, yum. The basic recipe functions as an awesome base, from which you can do whatever you please. In short, it's exactly the kind of recipe I love.

This was excellent!!  The only thing I did differently was add beef broth instead of vegetable to give it a deeper flavor.  I added all my garden fresh vegetables and herbs. Yummm

I didn't have a leek so I used an onion and also used chicken broth instead of veg.  Thought it had a nice fresh taste. Simple recipe... I liked it!

This is so delicious.  I followed the recipe pretty much as stated.  Added a few more vegetables and some kidney beans.  The only difference was to add 6-8 Tablespoons of tomato puree to the stock...I like the reddish color and it added a nice taste.  Thank you so much for a keeper. I doubled it to freeze and will be enjoying this all winter long.

This is a great easy soup to make.  I use half an onion instead of the leek and add a can of red kidney beans(great if you are a bean lover).  I also used dried thyme (maybe about 1 teaspoon) and it tastes fine.  I've made this several times and my 18 month old loves it!!

I made this soup exactly according to instructions, and it turned out okay -not great, but okay. For a much more flavourful minestrone soup, I prefer "Minestrone Soup I" by A.Hatton on this site.

Delicious, wholesome, nourishing and filling. You don't have to be a vegetarian to appreciate this minestrone.

Ah, yes...  A blustery fall evening with friends was warmed up with this soup  recipe served with homemade bread.  As I have a hard time leaving recipes the way they are, I added shredded cabbage, omitted the zukes, sprinkled a generous amount of fresh parsley in addition to the thyme, and I used canned tomatoes in lack of fresh ones.   The result was just as hearty as I hoped it would be.  Colorful, rich and made plenty; I recommend this to anyone as a number one comfort food.

I'm giving this 5 stars with the tweaks I made.  I used half an onion instead of the leek, tow small-ish fresh tomatoes and 1 8oz. can of tomotoe sauce, less than 1 tablespoon of fresh thyme, white navy beans, small shell pasta and I didn't need any additional salt or pepper.  I used Penzeys Spices vegetable soup base to make my stock and it was all the seasoning I needed.  I couldn't believe how good this soup came out.  The flavors are amazing!

I have not made this yet, but a word about minestrone:  Marcella Hazen sautes onions, carrots, celery, green beans, and cabbage in butter/olive oil mixture for 3 min each, consecutively, the cabbage for 6 min.  I can't imagine this without cabbage.  As is my family tradition, probably started by my Mom during the Depression, I use tomato juice for part of the broth, beef broth for the rest.  I love it this way, but I'm sure other versions like this one are equally good.  NOTE:  Real minestrone is supposed to be super thick.  This recipe isn't, but I like it more brothy anyway, so it suits me.

You can also add a bay leaf as the Italians do. Beef boullion works too.

This recipe was so good and easy.  The only changes we made was we added garlic to the olive oil in the begining before adding the veggies.  We added frozen corn when we added the tomatoes.  We also only used half of the vegetable stock but made up for it by adding chicken stock.  This is a very healthy recipe and I plan on making it again.

I'd give this more stars if I could. I've done this any number of ways, plus exactly as the recipe states. One comment that I didn't see from others is to add a dash of hot pepper sauce to the broth, adds just a little extra kick that my family loves. You can use just about ANY veggies that you have on hand, I also add some diced cabbage, great!  Thanks for the super recipe!

DON'T EAT TIL YOU'VE LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT! That's my best advice for this soup. After I made it the first day, it didn't even smell good.  Second day I would've given it 4 stars, by day 3 I'm giving it 5 stars (but since that's a little long to wait to eat, I'll stick to the 4 stars).  
I'm a picky eater: don't like cooked carrots, don't like many tomatoes, and don't get enough vegetables or beans. But stick em in this soup and I'll eat them all! My two year old will too! 
I didn't like how long it took to make, but I'll pay the price to eat this again. 
Also, I added another can of beans (turned out to be too many), put in about a cup of pasta with extra liquid (good amt of both), and put in italian seasoning.  Excellent!

I always make a large batch of this, because it is even better the second or third day. It's a terrific summer dish, not only because the vegetables are in season, but because it's as delicious cold out of the fridge as it is warm. The only change I make is leaving out the green beans and adding spinach just before it's finished cooking (the heat of the soup is enough to cook the spinach).

This recipe is very good. I added some crushed garlic, a couple pinches of oregano, and a full two quarts of stock, instead of 1.5 quarts because I added extra macaroni. Very tasty, especially as leftovers.

Wow!  I don't think you can go wrong with this one, regardless of what you do to it.  I added about three times the amount of leeks called for, just to use up the bunch, added three cloves of garlic, and basically however much of each vegetable I had on hand, and it was fantastic.  I love the clear broth with chopped tomatoes rather than the tomato-base in some other recipes.  Really filling, and a great meal with some fresh bread a salad!

I really enjoyed this soup, although it seemed to make more like 5 or 6 servings instead of 4 - maybe I put in too many vegetables.   I added 1 medium onion and 3 cloves garlic.

A good base soup, but not what I was expecting.  I would add garlic next time, and definitely potatoes.  Kind of bland.

Delicious! I added 1/2 lb of sauteed stewing beef (tossed in flour before cooked) to the soup and left out the macaroni. I also used an onion instead of the leeks. The flavour was amazing!

Very good but it is more like a very hearty vegetable soup.  I cooked the pasta ahead of time so it wouldn't absorb so much liquid. I did not add salt because I used canned vegetable stock and there is plenty of salt in it already.  For a change of pace, make mini-meatballs, cook them first, and then add them in.

This was the first really good soup I've made thus far!  I liked the flavor, but next time would prefer it a bit spicier.  I added slightly  more noodles than called for, and would recommend NOT doing that, as it made it much too thick, especially after refrigeration.  I did make it a day in advance, and it kept well for a week until we ate it all!  Thanks!

This was an excellent recipe! My family absolutely loved it!! Wish I would have doubled it. 
I did tweak it just a little...doubled veggies (zucchini/carrots) left out celery. Fresh  tomatoes are out of season so i used 2 cans of plum tomatoes and added some of the juice from one can. I minced 2 garlic cloves and put that in. Left out thyme and used 2 bay leaves and a shake of Italian seasoning. Used orzo pasta instead of macaroni.  You can also sub small onion for leek.
Will make again for sure!

This is so fast, easy, satisfying, comforting, refreshing!  I made it a day early then nuked individual bowls for four mins. topped with 1/4 cup of freshly grated parmesan then nuked it again for one minute.  You could also add a piece of toasted bread under the cheese to make a giant crouton.

This is a great recipe.  It's the first time I made a Minestrone Soup. I had already bought everything, got home and decided to double the batch, and since I didn't feel like running out to the store again I improvised.  I only bought enough broth, and leeks for one recipe, so I used what I had.  I used green onion and I had beef boulion.  I "eye balled" all of the ingredients and pretty much added more veggies than the recipe called for.  Not by much but use your best judgement.  Oh and I only used 1 can of beans.  I can't wait to make this again!

This was a very easy soup to make. I am disappointed by the broth- it was much too bland for my family's taste. Next time I think I will add a clove of garlic and not so much thyme. By the time my husband (who never adds salt) put enough salt in to taste, he asked me to just add bouillon cubes to made it edible for the next day's lunch. :(

This soup was delish, but I gave it only 4 stars because I did add a couple things...I added 1 clove of minced garlic to the veggies, and I added half of a can of tomato paste.  Even my 8 month old LOVED this soup.  I plan to double it next time so I can freeze one! Enjoy!

Good, but as said many times before, lacking.

Hardly "classic" as minestrone has been in Italy since Roman times, and everybody knows Romans didn't have tomatoes. Decent modern recipe, though...

This recipe is good as a base yet spices have been left out....margoram, oregano, parsley and garlic.  Other than that, it's spot on for a good minestrone.

This was very tasty. Instead of beans and pasta, I used a "minestrone mix" which had a few types of beans and rice (had to soak 12 hours and cook 1 hour before adding to the soup). Regardless of that change, the vegetables and amounts were perfect and we thought it tasted good both right away and after a few days in the fridge. I loved how fresh it was :) I felt like I made a fancy dish, but all I did was chop up a bunch of vegetables.

I really love this soup! I was trying to make something vegetarian that was similar to a minestrone at my fave restaurant. This was as good. I used Italian seasoning and chickpeas instead of cannellini beans. I also used wheat pasta. It was very tasty.

Good!  I took the advice of others and added diced potatos, garlic, oregano, & bay leaf -- glad I did.  I also used chicken broth because that's what I had on hand.

This is a delicious soup! I made very little changes. I added fresh peas and used a can of chopped tomatoes with garlic and olive oil. I use a can of mixed beans ( that's all I had at home ). Everybody loved it! Made it several times!

Good recipe...needs doctoring. Exchanged garbonzo beans for cannelli. Also excluded the celery and green beans. Instead added cabbage and flat parsely. I used 16. Oz of macaroni. This was way too much!

Yes, this is sooooo good. Just something so tasty about it and then you're getting your carbs (pasta) and protein (beans) on top of all that veggie goodness - its the business! I love soups because they're so convenient and you can make a big pot for the week - heat up for lunch - and even dinner with a hearty soup like this - good work Mole888! :)

Much more flavorful after a day in the fridge! I didn't add any additional salt because my veg. stock was very salty already. I did add some crushed garlic to the pot with the veggies. This is a delicious, fresh way to get a days serving of vegetables. My boyfriend said he would have liked more pasta in the soup, in which case I would increase the veg. stock (and for those of you mathmatically challanged, like myself, 1.5 quarts is equivalent to 48 ounces of stock).

This was a good basic recipe.  I did not use leek as the grocery store didn't have any.  I also used dried thyme.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.

I didn't think this soup tasted much like minestrone. It felt like something was missing. Maybe spinach? Not sure but I won't make it again. I had to force myself to eat it.

This really was great- my changes: add potato and asparagus, fresh basil, bay leaf, garlic, oregano.  Didn't include: zucchini (don't like texture in soup) green beans (asparagus was cheaper at the time).  Used canned tomato's, added ragu, used chicken stock.  ALso used onion instead of leek.

Oh yea- it is incredible the next day.

(so maybe I can't really comment on the recipe as is :))

Mmm, I added squash to the veggie mix. I also used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and used whole wheat pasta (more than called for). I wish I had put more carrots in the soup. I used crushed tomtoes (canned) instead of chopped. It worked great! I used pink kidney beans and great northern bean. I'm not a big soup OR tomato fan, but I will definitely make this again. Makes a great lunch to bring to work. And now I have enough soup for a week! Thanx!

Really easy to make and very tasty. The one think I would do differently is add less thyme. Also I would let it stew on the stove for an additional hour for all the flavors to really blend together.

Not bad, but in need of spices. I put garlic in from the beginning, cooking it in the oil, and I also threw in a chopped potato. Fresh parsley, oregano, basil, and red wine spruced up the flavor some. Will search for additional spices if I make it again. Easy to make, and it only needs a bread or salad to go with it.

This was the blandest soup I've ever made.  I used my own stock, canned tomatoes and I cooked dried cannellini beans instead of canned-maybe those things caused the problem but I can't imagine why.

This recipe was great, I will definitely do it again.  I didn't add pasta, though, but toasted some parmesan bread instead...yum!  I also added potatos and garlic, and substituted onions for leeks.  Instead of thyme I used Italian Herbs (because I didn't have any thyme).  I'll definitely make it again!

This minestrone is so good because of all the fresh ingredients...the only thing canned is the beans.  I sliced my tomatoes thin with a food processor, and it made the soup very attractive as well as tasty.  Served it to about 15 friends and they all loved it!

This is a woderful soup.Made it today, cold and a clasic fall day outside.  Family loves it.  We have been dipping into the pot all afternoon for mugs full of this soup.I have a large family so I tripled the recipe and it works great,I used chicken stock as well as added a bit of vegatable juice to help the store bought tomatoes a bit.  Thank you...will make this very often.

A couple of small changes are that I sautéed some pancetta before adding and sweating the vegetables, and I added some dried basil in addition to the thyme. And I used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Other than that I followed the recipe pretty closely with two big exceptions: 1) I steamed the green beans and added them at the last minute so they retain their bright green color and 2) I cooked the pasta al dente separately and  added it to the soup just before serving. I've found from past experience that if you cook the pasta in the soup it becomes soggy and starts to soak up the liquid within a few minutes of finishing. The other side benefit of cooking the pasta separately is that you can reserve the pasta water and add it to the soup as it simmers to keep the liquid ratio about right.

I love The Allrecipes site. I consider myself a pretty  good cook! However, no amount of compliments after 38 years of cooking meals for family and friends gives me as much pleasure and joy as looking through Allrecipes site to get IDEAS for meals. This Minestrone soup recipe is awesome as is. In my opinion it needs nothing else added. Of course we all have different tastes!! I like to use fresh or frozen veggies and herbs from my garden for all my recipes if I can. That being said, all of you reviewers that have to add this or that because it tastes, “bland”, maybe try using fresh or farmers market ingredients. I skipped the sauté in a pan step and sautéed in my slow cooker instead. That was my only change. Oh! And I added kale because my garden kale was very happy this year and produced until it snowed!!

It was good. Made it great by adding the following: 3 cloves of garlic sautéed, 1 extra carrot, 1 can of tomato paste, lamb broth, 1 lb of sweet italian sausage crumbled. Had it with baguette on the side and some blue cheese.

Came out great! I’m italian so I have to have meatballs in mine. I used small Angus Meatballs from Walmart..cooked them a little first then they finish cooking in the soup.  And I used 1/2 cup pasta instead of 1/4 cup but again, it’s an Italian thing, ciao!

I made this last week. It was a little bland, though I loved the leeks. It came out bland even with the addition of oregano, extra thyme. Definitely add the pasta separately if you make it, otherwise the pasta will get mushy! My husband highly disliked this soup, but I thought it was okay.

Just made this for dinner and it was sensational!  I have made a point of working with dry beans more lately, and so instead of canned, I soaked and then cooked dry beans and added them.  It was delicious, and made enough for 4 generous and hearty portions.  I will definitely be making this again, thanks!

I absolutely adored this, but part of that was because I cheated and followed the advice of other reviewers. Here is my compilation of changes: add .5 tbsp of olive oil, 1 clove of garlic (sliced/chopped), 1 more zucchini, ~1 cup of shredded cabbage, 1-2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead of thyme, 8 tbsp of canned tomato sauce (puree was recommended, but I didn’t have that on hand), 1 can of Kidney beans (drained), 1 can of Garbanzo beans (drained), and used a total of ~1/3 cup of pasta. I used a gluten-free pasta that I trust and cooked it separately while the soup was in the 30 min simmer (step 2), then I added it during the directed time in step 3. Mind you, this turned out to be able to serve 8 to 10 people! (Calories were about 231 to 185 per serving, respectively.) This is a great dish and I love how great it came out! Thank you for this great recipe and thank you to the amazing reviewers that helped kick it up a notch! ;)

This was very good. I made a few minor changes. I added 1t of minced garlic with the veggies. I added about 1.5C of cabbage. I used 1 can of Italian garlic, oregano, basil tomatoes. Added 1/2t of Italian seasoning instead of thyme and a few dashes of cayenne pepper.

Good base recipe. Two tips:
1. add 1clove of garlic with the sauteed veg.
2. intermediate step, after veg are mostly sauteed, add the tomatoes and thyme and cook for 2min. Then add a couple cups of tomato juice and reduce it down by half, THEN add the veg stock. Salting the tomato while reducing helps richen it as well. Idk why, it just works.

I always add chopped kale (or spinach if you prefer) to minestrone, cause its good for you :) Also my opinion thyme and bay leaf ARE the appropriate herbs. AVOID THE TEMPTATION TO ADD BASIL.
 Enjoy!

I made a lot of changes with spices and veggies based on other user reviews, but this recipe has always turned out great. I do use the canned tomatoes with tomato puree instead of fresh, I reduced the amount of thyme, and added an Italian blend of spices (oregano, garlic, basil, etc). This recipe does seem to get better flavor with time - it's even better as leftovers the next day.

This is a good start to a great soup. I refer to this recipe for the right balance of vege to liquid quantity. I start by browning pancetta cubes in some oil. Then I add the mix of vergetables + some fresh garlic. Instead of thyme I add in about a tablespoon of pesto, a few drops of green pepper Tabasco (Milder Jalapeno) and a piece of Parmigiano rind. Fantastic!

I have never made minestrone soup before in my life, but this looked so good, I decided to give it a try.  I must say that I did make some changes after reading the reviews, so  I could adjust it to my personal likes.  Not to take away from this recipe, it just had a few things in it that I don't care for.  It was easy to make the adjustments with the help of the reviews and it came out amazing.  My husband and son-in-law both loved it as well.  Thank you Michelle!

Even my picky kid ate some vegetables with this soup.  It was that good!  Tasted very authentic to me.  I gave it four starts instead of five because I had to add some tomato paste to richen the broth and used a bit of garlic, too, just because.

This is a good base for Minestrone but if someone wants a more substantial soup,  try making it with beef broth using oxtails. I use a pressure cooker to cook the oxtails in water, with some chopped onions, salt and pepper. Then you can proceed as in the recipe, except I add cabbage and instead of thyme, I season it with a tablespoon or more of pesto. The oxtails will be very tender, so you can have them with your soup.

Bellisimo!!!  I mean really, this is very tasty, Vegetarian, subtle and hearty, just about as perfect, healthy and delicious as you can get, especially when sprinkled with real, finely grated, aged, parmesean cheese.  The only 4 changes in the recipe I would recommend are; 1) Go easy on the salt for your sodium-concerned family and friends. The parmesean will more than make up for that. 2) Be sure to use fresh tomatoes on the vine and blanch and chop them for the flavor and aliveness of the food. 3) Add a few cloves of fresh, chopped garlic - yummy.  4) Consider leaving out the pasta, which my local, gourmet, Northern Italian restaurant chef says is a no-no in Northern Italy.  He also says, meat or chicken is never used in classic, Tuscan minestrone, so this recipe is a perfect Vegan choice when the parmesean is omitted!  Great recipe - Buongiorno!  P.S. All of my vegetarian friends at the party I just served this recipe at last night raved!  You should have seen them!!!

Skipped the zucchini (don't like it); used canned tomatoes (too lazy), fresh green beans and added an onion...YUMMY, even straight from the pot.  Parmesan on top = perfection!

Great recipe!  I made a few changes: I added garlic and replaced the thyme with two bay leaves (removed after cooking), `1 tsp basil and 1 tsp oregano.    I didn't taste it before refrigerating overnight (as per other reviewers recommendations) so I can only assume that letting it sit overnight is a MUST.   I put this into 4 or 5 mason jars--each jar is a serving--and it's gone in two days.  Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe!

Just made this and it was yummy. After other reviewers said it was better the next day,I can't wait for tomorrow. All I did different was to add some spinach and some fresh basil,which I have an abundance in my garden.

It wasn't the best minestrone soup i've ever had. But I've improvise by doubling the tomato and adding some fresh herbs like basil, parsley.
Not a 5 star recipe though

Excellent! I quadrupled the recipe for a dinner party so I used a combination of cannelini, dark and light kidney beans, because that's what I had on hand. I made it the night before, let it sit in the fridge, and reheated it for dinner. I think it really helped the flavor set in all the vegetables. My friends still compliment me on it.

Perfect. 
This recipe is wonderful. Sometimes I add red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit.

My husband, being full bred Italian claims this is one of the best Minestrone soups he has had the pleasure eating. I used lots of fresh ground mixed peppers and ditalini in place of the elbow noodles. Bravo!~

Everyone enjoyed this soup.  I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth because that is what I had on hand.  The soup still turned out good. Thanks Michelle.

This was really good, I used my own vegetable stock and there were already 2 leaks in there, so I didn't use the leeks in this recipe for the minestrone soup. I also added a bay leaf to the soup and just used the leaves of the thyme sprigs. This was terrific!!

Unbelievable!  This was my first time making the Minestrone soup and it turned out beautifully.  Next time I will omit the cannellini beans, because my family is not too big on them.  The whole thing came out so flavorful...  And it is true that the flavor is even better the next day.  Definitely a keeper!  Yumm!

This recipe is fantastic because it is so easy to customize it to your own personal tastes.  I made a huge stock pot of it, then experimented with suggestions from other reviewers. It was perfect the first time I made it.

I read the reviews and then tried the recipe. I did make some changes, I added about 3 chopped onions, and a jar of Ragu (pasta sauce).  Also lots of garlic, italian herbs and lots of parsley. Salt & pepper.  It turned out really well, lots of veggies or maybe I added more!  Nice & thick like it had been made yesterday!

Not a bad soup.  But not the best I've ever had either.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  But, at the end, I found myself wanting more... flavor or something...

Followed the suggestions of some previous reviewers, and added tatties and garlic. Also threw in some zucchini, and other extra veggies. Wonderful soup for the cold winter months. Definitely a keeper! Mmm... :o)

Everyone loved it, including those in the family that cannot understand me being a vegan!  It's just another recipe that we can have in common.  My sister-in-law, who says she lives for meat, asked for the recipe.  Thank you.

I added a large can of whole tomatoes to it and it really added a tremendous flavor to this wonderful soup! Depending on the noodles you use, this also freezes well. :)
