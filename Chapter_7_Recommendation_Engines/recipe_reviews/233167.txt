The cookies didnt turn out as sweet as i hoped. They were very dry and bland. I would suggest adding a 2 teaspoons to the mix, then sprinkling sugar on the finished cookie.

I tried these because I loved the idea of cinnamon in a chocolate chip cookie, but they were more bland and flat then I hoped. I added extra cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg to the batter. I made them as drop cookies and they turned out excellent with the modifications I suggested. I got about 3.5 dozen cookies.

These were horrible and not at all what a chocolate chip cookie should look or taste like.

I made these cookies for my church and they loved them. I did almost exactly as the recipe said except I used around 1/4 cup less butter...They were amazing :) definitely going to make them again.

Very good! Have made these many times and they have come out perfectly each time. I have even added cinnamon chips to help compliment the cinnamon flavor in the cookies. I rolled my cookies out to about 1/8 inch thickness and they cook very quickly so be careful and watch the amount of time you bake.
