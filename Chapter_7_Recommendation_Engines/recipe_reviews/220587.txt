This is a very tasty dish for sure. The only change I made was to use rice vinegar instead of white. A little labor intensive, but so worth it. Salad does need to sit a little while to let the dressing do it's thing, but as the directions say don't add the shrimp til it's time to serve. Thank you for a great recipe.

Yes, I will make again!
I used pomegranate vinegar instead.  Also, I recommend reducing sugar to 2 TBS

I will definitely make this again.  I took the advice of a reviewer, and because we're cutting back on sugar, added just a 1/4 teaspoon.  The only thing I did different was I put the cilantro in the blender before I read it was for garnish.  Used cooked frozen shrimp (thawed) and put whole shrimp on the top.  We love shrimp! Great recipe, thanks!

I make this around once a month. I've never had a guest who didn't like it!
