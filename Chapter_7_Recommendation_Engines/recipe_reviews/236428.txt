I used 1.5 8oz pkgs. of cream cheese, used about 8 oz. of our alaska salmon that my husband smoked and did not add salt. Really loved this recipe. Quick and easy. I will make this again for sure. Thanks

Absolutely delicious! I served with various crackers and cut veggies, and a loaf of crusty bread! Made this recipe as written, you will not be sorry! Thank you Avon for sharing! Yummy! To say the least, our Seahawks won!

Very good! Since I didn't have garlic cloves I added: garlic powder, onion powder, and dill weed. Yummo. Go hawks.
