The fish turned out great!  I used cooking spray instead of oil and added a tiny bit of lemon pepper to the crust blend then baked it to finish off the cooking.  The blend of original flavors from this recipe is phenomenal!

Great dish for my dad's 61st birthday dinner!  I added a little more cinnamon becaue the cumin made the rub smell a little spicy; I also only had plain breadcrumbs so I added a pinch of basil and oregano to make them Italian. The orange/walnut/honey sauce was awesome (I used raisins instead of currants) but the couscous was just ok.

The orange and pecans (I substituted the walnuts) made this absolutely fabulous. Incredibly unique and sweet taste which totally killed any "fishy" taste you would expect. I usually hate to eat any fish but I loved this!

I LOVE this recipe! My boyfriend and I have had it three times in the last few months. Amazing combination of flavors and very easy! We're going to try it with mahi mahi rather than swordfish next. Also, we've used pecans instead of walnuts with equal success.

My husband made this for company - subbed pecans for walnuts.  Everyone loved it!  Very delicious.

The spices are so good, I always make double for coating. The toasted nuts and honey flavors make this so comforting.
