Ok - for those of you that had trouble with this recipe - try these things:  1) Like many others did, I mixed the flour, peanut butter, and m.creme ahead of time (with a mixer).  2) I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  3) I used Swansdown Cake flour instead of regular flour.  4)I used an even cup of marshmallow creme (8 oz).

 I found out the temperature to cook fudge to is 238 degrees F. - so I did that, using my candy thermometer and didn't go by time.  The moment it reached that temp - took more than 5 minutes on medium/medium high heat - I took it off the burner and mixed the rest of the pre-mixed ingredients in.  After a LOT of elbow grease with a REALLY sturdy whisk (a square pot whisk) - when everything was blended - I let the mixture cool to about 160 degrees F and whisked with vigor again - before spreading in a glass pan that had been lightly sprayed with butter-flavored Pam.

 Once in the pan - I used one of those sharp gadgets that you use to hold a tomato with while slicing it (mine's Pampered Chef) - and made a nice grid pattern before it started to harden.

Came out perfectly!!!!!!

the best pb fudge recipe I've found.  It was so mallow and creamy; not at all dry and crumbly.  I took the advice of others and pre-blended the flour, pb, and marshmallow creme.  I also added a tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. butter extract to this mixture.  I always use a candy thermometer when making fudge.  I used the thermometer and set the kitchen timer to 5 minutes and can tell you that the temp only got up to 225 degrees, well below the soft ball stage.  One does not want to rely on a soft-ball stage to make this.  I realized that this was a different fudge recipe than most with the addition of flour and decided I better only boil for the 5 minutes instead of going for soft ball stage.  glad I did, as it turned out perfect.  I didn't even refrigerate it; set it on the table for about 1 hour.  I always use foil-lined pan sprayed with pam when making fudge; easier to lift out.  I just lifted it out of the pan and cut a sliver to try; MALLOW, MALLOW, MALLOW!  I did add extra pb, as I had an off-brand and didn't think it tasted very peanuty when I opened the jar.*about 14 oz. of pb used*  Thanks for this recipe.  can't wait to take it to work tonight for co-workers to try.

I have never been a peanut butter fudge fan, but this recipe changed that! I have made this recipe a dozen times over the past few years. I get multiple requests from family and friends for batches or recipes! It tastes like peanut butter cookie dough, or the inside of a peanut butter cup - but smoother! I have never had this not set up for me. First, I bring the butter & sugar mixture to a boil using medium heat, stirring frequently. Then I reduce the heat so it won't boil over, and set the timer for a full 5 minutes.  I pre-mix the peanut butter & marshmallow creme in my kitchenaid. I use creamy peanut butter and just eyeball it from the jar. I pour the sugar mixture into the mixer bowl and let it sit for 30 seconds or so to help melt the peanut butter/marmallow mix. Then I mix just until combined. Add the flour, and mix just until combined. I tap the mixer bowl on the counter to help release some of the air bubbles. I pour the mixture into a large baking sheet. I let it sit for a minute, then sometimes add a few handfuls of chocolate chips (I prefer milk chocolate with this recipe)on top to melt and spread. Other times I let it cool so I can handle it, take a pinch and roll it and dip it in chocolate for peanut butter balls that taste just like store bought peanut butter cups! Or just eat it plain and it is heavenly!

Follow the instructions and measure carefully and you will have great fudge!  Be sure to start the 5 minute timing AFTER the mixture comes to a full rolling boil.  I also use evaporated milk and unsalted real butter.  I have been using this same recipe for many years and my teenage son loves it!

This is my first time making fudge, and it turned out really well. I accidentally poured it into a 8x8 pan, but moved fast enough to scrape it into a 9x13 with no problems with it setting too fast (the top just isn't pretty and smooth). I've tried some already, and it's a great consistency - rich, creamy, firm, but not too crumbly. It cuts well, too.

Cooking notes: I followed others' advice and preblended the pb, flour (only used 1/3 cup) and marshmallow. I also used evaproated milk instead of regular. I don't have a candy thermometer, but I let the mix boil for 6 min before adding the pb mix.

this is the most awesome pb fudge recipe! i did mix the marshmallow creme, peanut butter and flour ahead of time in a bowl so when the other was finished cooking i could just mix them together and be done... People RAVE over the taste and smoothness of this fudge.  i will never use any other recipe!

Fantastic! I haven't made fudge before and this turned out awesome! I changed the preparation though: (1) line 13x9" pan with foil and spray with pam(2) Mix together well in mixer peanut butter and marshmallow cream and set aside (3) Bring to boil over medium heat sugar, butter and milk (I used whole milk) When at a rolling boil set timer (I set it for 5 minutes, 30 seconds) and boil, stirring frequently. Add 1 cup salted roasted peanuts, stir and remove from heat (4) Add hot mixture to mixer containing PB and Marsh creem. Let sit for 30 seconds, add vinilla (1/4 tsp) and flour. Mix just until blended. Pour into prepared pan, after leveling perfectly, sprinkle with milk chocolate (I found choc. chips didn't give good texture, but cut-up milk chocolate candy bar or hurshey kisses were great) Spread softly to create a nice top layer (or bottom layer, whichever you prefer). Fridgerate for 1 hour+. Viola!!!
I'd like to thanks many reviewers for these ideas, I combined many of them into this review and it had awesome results!

I am giving this five stars, but I would have liked more peanut butter taste (I'm kind of a peanut butter nut).  I might try adding more next time and hope that doesn't throw off the whole recipe.

I have never made candy before--so here are a few hints for other novices:

1) use a big pot.  I started off with a 2 1/2 quart saucepan and it was much too small.  I had to dump the boiling mess into a 5 quart pot to prevent it from spilling over.

2) It doesn't seem to need to be stirred when it's boiling.  I worried that it would scald, but it didn't.

3) You may want to refrigerate the final product before you cut it into squares; it's pretty soft and wasn't holding its shape as I cut it.

4) I used nonfat (skim) milk and it came out just fine. (I thought it might really need whole milk).

Thanks for the great recipe.  Even thought I have never made candy before at all, it came out really well!

We loved this fudge.  I added a tsp. of peanut butter extract for even more flavor, then while the sugar, milk and butter were cooking I blended the peanut butter, marshmallow cream and flour together with an electric mixer. (I love shortcuts) When I added the hot syrup, I beat it hard for about a minute.  This way there was no chance of any residual flour taste.  This is a keeper, and not just for the holidays.  Thanks for a great recipe!  OH!!  And this is great with a little chocolate melted or drizzled on top too!

I am new to making fudge, but this recipe was fast and easy. I am sure my boyfriend and his family (big PB fans) will love it. Since Peanuts don't typically make handsome garnishes, I put a 5050 mixture of semisweet and milk chocolate chips in a ziplock bag with some shortening, microwaved it, snipped a small part of the corner off and drizzled chocolate over the fudge to make it look nicer. (For chocolate fudge I do the same with white chocolate...)

This is a wonderful recipe.  But, things happen quick.  Make sure you have everything ready and measured before starting.

Shared with all my office staff.  An employee from another department declared it "the best candy in the hospital".

This is a great fudge recipe-it melts in the mouth.  I made it for both our sons' junior high teachers, so I made three batches. They stirred while I added in the marshmallow creme and peanut butter.  I had to have those measured out beforehand so I could add them quickly. Adding the flour at the end ensured a nice texture.

I was not happy with this fudge.  I followed the directions exactly and the fudge is not firm, you can't even cut a piece and take it out of the pan, you need a spoon to eat it.  If there was something else that needed to be done, that should have been stated.

Every year I make peanut butter fudge using different recipes, and every year I've been disappointed.  Not this year!  This is the best PB fudge I've ever made.  I was pretty skeptical about adding flour to fudge, but it works.  I mixed the marshmallow fluff and peanut butter in my Kithen Aid stand mixer, then added the butter/sugar mixture to it.  I hand-stirred the hot mixture to blend, then added the flour and finished mixing with the mixer.  It set up quickly and it is very smooth and creamy.  I have found my peanut butter recipe.

Wow. I have been the family candy maker since I was a child. I had the knack..never ever used a candy thermometer. My daughters fav is my old fashioned peanut butter fudge, rich in ingredients, needs to form a softball, needs to cool down to a beating temp while the peanut butter is laying in the centre. And a lot of BEATING! I tried this one with the marshmallow cream and/or fluff and was amazed..the taste and texture are exactly the same, but the work is minimal. A lot of my friends wait for their annual gifts of fudge, and I wanted to do another batch tonight. I had no marshmallow cream, so I did some research and found that 2 cups of mini white marshmallows = 1 7 oz jar of the cream. I made it and it is awesome again. A great substitute! Just in case you're hungry and don't have the cream in the house. :) I find this recipe combines elements of both chocolate fantasy fudge and the five minute fudge with marshmallows. YUMMY! Great recipe..thank you.

Great recipe!  I used parchment paper in the pan so that I could easily remove the fudge once it was cooled.  I then sliced it with a pizza cutter which works amazingly well!

This is the first time I've ever added flour to a candy recipe. 
It turned out absolutely great. The smoothest, creamiest, 
tastiest peanut butter fudge I've ever made in my 40 years of cooking.
Debbie, you did a fine job. Thank you. Bob Holub

BEST FUDGE! I made this for the holidays and I had to keep making it again and again. Everyone kept asking for it. I definitely will be making this recipe for years to come. It was SOOOO CREAMY and SUPER EASY TO MAKE!  I added more peanut butter than it called for because i wanted more peanuty taste. I added about 15 or 16 oz total. Also have EVERYTHING ready before you start. Pan greased, fluff, peanut butter and flour already out and measured. There is NO TIME once the hot mixture is ready. And make it all in a BIG pot not a 2 qt or anything small ilke that. It really puffs up and you need a big stock pot. Thank you!!

Excellent and very easy fudge to make.  My best advice is... just follow the recipe =) I understand everyone wants to put their own stamp on it, but its super easy and turns out perfect without needing a candy thermometer nor extra steps; like cleaning more dishes!  Try it, you won’t be disappointed.

My Dad is the pickiest person when it comes to pb fudge.  Nothing has ever come close to his mom's fudge until I made him this fudge.  He said it was the best he ever had (even better than his mom's!!)

Perfect and easy!  I made the recipe at Christmas.  I put part of the mixture in a smaller brownie pan and the rest in a round cake pan. Once the fudge in the brownie pan was cool, I added a layer of Aunt Teen's Creamy Chocolate Fudge from this site.  It turned out fabulous.  My husband loves peanut butter and chocolate together.  This was a huge hit.  The plain peanut butter fudge was delicious all on its own also.  Thanks for sharing.

I could not help it i tasted it as i was spreading it into the pan. SO yummie. This fudge really brought back some memories of my grandmother. Every year she made candies at christmas, and she made something like this. One taste and i was back in her kitchen standing at the counter with hopefull eyes. (Yep she always let me "sneak one") the only thing she did differently was she rolled hers into a ball and then dipped then in chocolate. I will make these again and again. 
Debby I am not sure if you will ever see this, but thank you so much for posting this, my grandma has been gone for close to 10 years now. But this recpie has brought back so many great memories  that i had long ago forgotten. Thank you.

I HAVE MADE THIS RECIPE MANY TIMES OVER THE LAST YEAR.  IT IS DEFINITELY NO FAIL. I DO USE CAN MILK SINCE THAT IS WHAT MY MOM USED.  I USED A SUGGESTION ABOUT MIXING THE FLOUR AND PEANUT BUTTER TOGETHER BEFORE ADDING TO HOT MIXTURE AND IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM. I USE A HAND MIXER. THE ONLY OTHER THING I DO IS LINE MY PAN WITH NO STICK FOIL.  WHEN IT SETS I CAN LIFT IT FROM THE PAN TO CUT. I HAVE MADE IT TWICE THIS WEEK TO MAIL IN CHRISTMAS PACKAGES.  THANK YOU DEBBY FOR SAVING ME FROM FUDGE FAILURES.

I didn't know what to expect with the addition of flour to fudge, but these came out great.  They cut nice and even and I think the flour was what thickened these to a perfect cutting consisitency.  The taste was outstanding!  We made 3 pans of fudge for the holidays and this was the favorite with husband and most of my kids.  Definitely a keep recipe.

Absolutely the best peanut butter fudge I've ever eaten.  I found this recipe before Christmas and made my second batch today.  I saw some reviews that said thier fudge was hard and/or dry...they must have overcooked it.  I used regular milk the first time I made and evaporated milk today. Both worked.  I think adding the flour takes away that too sweet flavor that some fudges have...I may try adding a little to my Chocolate Fantasy Fudge next time I make it???

This was my first attempt at making fudge and I'm so glad I choose this recipe. I followed it to the tee and it turned out great! I first thought that the 4 cups of sugar would make it way too sweet, but it didn't. I've had sickening sweet fudge before and this comes no where close to that. I let it cool for about 2 hours on the counter before cutting and it set up nicely and came out easily from the pan (no mess)...I would definitely make this one again!!

I have been making fudge for about 20 yrs. now...I decided to veer from my old standby recipe and try a new one....Sooo glad I chose this one, it is the creamiest I have ever made :) As some others did, I used evap milk.... I had the marsh cream, pb and flour mixed and waiting in my kitchenaid, cooked the syrup about 5 1/2 min and poured it into the pb mixture...mixed it a minute or so...and perfect consistency....absolutely beautiful!

Followed directions, set up perfectly. DELICIOUS!!!  You can't start timing the 5 minutes until the sugar mixture is at a FULL ROLLING BOIL, that is the key!

Really yummy. Lost my recipe so tried this one this year. I used evap. milk just because I also do in fudge. I mixed the pb and flour to avoid lumps. For those having problems, start the 5 min. only AFTER the candy has come to a full boil, which means you can't stir down the bubbles. And for those with dry, crumbly fudge, you've cooked it too long. If your fudge doesn't set up, add 1/4 c. milk and cook again. Not sure how to save dry fudge though.

This truly is the best peanut butter fudge! I was hesitant to try it due to flour in the recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised at the end result. It is very tasty and sets quickly. Will make this one many more times!

The title says it all, the best!! I microwaved the fluff for 15 seconds and mixed it along with the peanut butter, flour, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp butter extract. Set aside and wisked into the sugar mixture aftre it reached 238. You really need a candy therm.. You can not go by time due to different heating and raising heat temp.. After mixing all together I put it in a pan sparayed with non stick spray. Chilled in fridge for 2 hours. I also used cake flour instead of regular flour, enjoy.

I have been looking for a decent peanut butter fudge for a long time. I made 3 different fudges for Christmas. Chocolate, Maple and Peanut Butter. This recipe is awesome... It was very easy to make, it took no time at all, and everyone loved it. It cut in perfect squares, and was very easy to package. I mixed the peanut butter with the marshmallow, vanilla and flour in a separate bowl, and then added it after soft boil. It blended very easily and came out perfect. This one is a "KEEPER". It's not too peanut buttery, it doesn't turn out soupy, and it doesn't crumble before you get it out of the pan. I will make this one again and again... and again !

Before you start, get your 9x13 pan and the peanut butter mixture ready. Make sure you let the sugar slurry come to a complete rolling boil (all of it will be bubbling vigorously), and then start the timer. I cooked for about 5:15 minutes. Stirring the slurry into the peanut butter mixture took a couple of minutes, but the fudge was a perfect consistency by the end of the stirring. The texture is very smooth, firm, and creamy, not hard or crumbly as some other peanut butter fudges have been that I've made. I liked that this recipe didn't use any chips and had very basic ingredients, and it made a nice, big batch, too! Thanks, Debby, for a great recipe.

If you are looking for an excellent peanut butter fudge, look no further. This is delicious. I was a little skeptical because of the use of flour, but this recipe will definately replace my other recipe of 35 years. Thanks Debby. Joy L.Ballog

Yum, yum, yum!  I make a lot of candy for Christmas, and added this recipe this year.  It is delicious, one of my favorites!  I made it with creamy peanut butter, but think it would be good with crunchy peanut butter as well.

Super good and very easy to make. I used my Kitchen Aid wire whisk to mix the last 3 ingredients, then poured the sugar, milk, butter recipe mixture over it and beat until it was silky smooth. I will for sure be making this again.

I have been searching for a great peanut butter fudge recipe and I found it! Not crumbly or hard, but a soft, moist, melt in your mouth kind of fudge! The only thing I will caution on is that you should probably use a thinner, creamier kind of peanut butter, like Skippy, rather than a harder one, like JIF. Using Jif makes it come out a little harder, just because of the nature of the PB I think. But still amazing. Thanks for sharing this recipe!! I love it.

I have a fantastic peanut butter fudge recipe but when I saw that flour was part of this recipe & the raves, I just had to try it.  I used the tips from others & it came out pretty creamy but dense.  Sorry, but I think I will stick with my recipe which is composed of butter, sugar, milk, vanilla, & PB.  It is silky smooth and melts in your mouth.

Very yummy, and very easy too!  I used 18oz of peanut butter because my hubby likes his peanut butter, and also followed the other reviews that said to mix the flour, peanut butter, and marshmallow cream together before adding it to the sugar mixture.

Yummy recipe! And this was my first time making any kind of fudge! I took others' advice. I used evaporated milk instead of milk. I mixed the peanut butter, marshmallow creme, and flour ahead of time. I heated to temperature of 238F instead of boiling for 5 minutes (it boiled for longer than 5 minutes). I let the fudge cool to 160F, then gave it another good stir before spreading it in the pan. Excellent treat!

The fudge did not turn out at all. I have never made fudge before so I made sure to do just what the directions said and the fudge never became hard enough to cut. I can stick my fingers in it and it is more like fudge for icecream. Had to throw away.

The best peanut butter fudge I've ever made!  It isn't crumbly nor too oily as some in the past have been.  I took it to a church potluck today and everybody loved it!  Based on the other reviews, I did mix the peanut butter, flour, and marshmallow cream together before adding to the sugar mixture.  I would have never thought to add flour to a fudge recipe, but it works.  This one is definitely a keeper.  MERRY CHRISTMAS!  :o)

Ok- I'm a blockhead.  I've made fudge 2x now (2 recipes- 2nd recipe was this one) and both times it's come out grainy and crumbly.  Last time I thought I didn't cook it long enough, this time I think I overbeat it at the end.  I'm BUMMED because I'm a pretty good cook and this recipe seems so foolproof!  I took all the advice of other reviewers and mixed the 'other'ingredients and had my pan prepared before I even started cooking the sugar mixture.  I was ok until I stopped to open the vanilla extract (optional)-which for some reason I didn't add to the pb and marshmallow mixture.  Once I added it and mixed it in- that was the end of the silky fudge I had.  (I hate it when I mess up!)  In any event, it tastes ok- nothing GREAT- so I'll cover it with melted choc chips and take it to work tomorrow.  People there are always pleased for somthing to nibble on-especially if it's homemade.  I will try this again to see if it was MY mess up.  UPDATE- My mom seems to think that I should have used more marshmallow creme because I used more pb than the recipe said to use.  I believe her because she's a great cook and AMAZING fudge maker!

This is the best PB fudge I have ever eaten! It's super easy and is delicious! This is my second attempt at any kind of fudge. The first time was chocolate and it was a disaster. This recipe was too simple to mess up! I followed the suggestions and had the PB, marshmallow cream and flour ready and waiting for the sugar mixture. Worked great! My only suggestion is to make sure you use a BIG pot to cook the sugar, milk and butter. I thought I had it in a big enough pot, but it quickly bubbled over. I had to watch it very closely. Next time around a MUCH MUCH bigger pot will be used.

Excellent fudge and so easy!  I would give this more than five stars for flavor, texture, and ease of making.  (I didn't change a thing from the original recipe.) I found this recipe on 12/2/06 and shared the first batch with several different families...just made my second batch by request which was more like a demand!  My son-in-law was extremely disappointed when he found only one piece left in "his can" of fudge!  Can't wait to give this as a gift for Christmas. THANKS, Debby, for sharing this excellent recipe and letting me enter the realm of "best PB Fudge" cooks.

This made some awesome fudge.  I'm sure the recipe would have been great as it is, but I substituted evaporated milk for the milk (I was completely out of milk).  I also added about 2 tsp of vanilla extract to the sugar mixture.  I combined the flour, peanut butter and marshmallow cream together in my kitchen aid prior to adding the sugar combo to it.  Terrific!  Nice and creamy with the perfect peanut butter taste.

Awesome fudge!  I used the suggestion I found here and blended the peanut butter, fluff, and flour together before adding.  I found the sugar mixture was cooling faster than the peanut butter mixture was melting into it, so I mixed it in with my hand mixer.  Just before pouring the fudge into the pan, I mixed in some milk chocolate chips.  I also lined the pan with aluminum foil instead of buttering it.  This way, when it cooled, I just lifted it out of the pan and cut it with my pizza wheel.  Will definitly make again (probably later this week!).

Frantastic! I've never made a Peanut Butter Fudge that calls for flour so I was a little concerned but one taste and I'm sold.

This is the best peanut butter fudge I have ever tasted!  I have made it for 5 years now, at least!  If you melt some chocolate chips on top, you almost have a reese's peanut butter cup!

My family & friends all loved the flavor and smooth texture of this fudge..altho it never set up like fudge. I'm no sure what happened since I even cooked it a cpl minutes longer than directed. Even after refrigerating it overnight, it was more a gooey taffy consistancy...so I wrapped it in wax paper to pass it off as taffy.

What a great recipe! Flour to hot liquid=gelatin. Genious! I didn't have marshmellow cream around so i melted mini marshmellows and added some corn syrup, mixed that with peanut butter then added to the saucepan of evaporated milk/sugar/butter (with a spoon). After it melted a bit, i used a mixer to smooth it out.This is when i sprinkled in the flour. I like a solid, firm (pretty) fudge and this is exactly what I was looking for.

If I made this peanut butter fudge recipe, I would add less flour.  I made this recipe as directed but they also turned out dry and crumbly as other reviewers mentioned.

This is by far my most favorite peanut butter fudge to date.  I am not a fan of peanut butter and I couldn't get enough of this fudge, plus it was a big hit with family and friends. I used honey roasted peanut butter which I thought was a nice touch.  The fudge is so delicious without being too rich.  Excellent for sure.

Perfect fudge for my sissy's b-day and just like gma's. So much easier than I thought. Very creamy and sat up wonderfully. After taking it off the heat I added the butter mixture to my pb mix and sat the bowl in sink of shallow cold water while whisking. So great thank you Debby.

I have searched high and low for the best peanut butter fudge recipe.  My friends mom wouldn't share hers, but with this recipe I don't need hers anymore!  This is the worlds best fudge recipe!  I also pre-mixed my peanut butter, flour and marshmallow cream and it worked great.  I also added honey roasted peanuts to the top, if you like them, it turned out yummy!

Oh so good!  The second I tasted this, it mentally transported me to the fudge stand at the state fair.  This is easily on par with fudge from a fudge shop.  Instead of boiling for 5 minutes, I used a candy thermometer to get the temp up to 235-240 degrees (which is the proper temp for fudge) while constantly stirring.

This is so easy to make, and so good.  Without fail someone asks for the recipe each time I bring it anywhere.  My grandmother requests it every birthday and Christmas, and I just mailed off three pounds of it to her.  This is by far the best peanut butter fudge I've ever had.  Hands down the creamiest and probably the easiest!

My 16 y/o daughter makes this all the time - it is extremely simple.  We do follow the recipe exactly and the results are consistently wonderful.  The fudge is smeary-creamy smooth.  We have also added melted chocolate chips to the top after the fudge cools and that is also a big hit.  Thanks for a great and foolproof recipe!

I registered JUST so I could leave this review! This peanut butter fudge was SO easy to make and sooooo good! I have tried making fudge twice before and it never worked for me- this time it was perfect! Tastes like a Reese's peanut butter cup only better. I added milk chocolate chips on top after pouring it into the pan. The only problem I had was that it started firming up very quickly, so make sure to have your pan ready! I'm bringing this to my Christmas party tomorrow.

I gave this recipe to my husband to follow as he was in charge of making fudge for our Christmas goodie gifts for friends and family.  He mixed the peanut butter and flour first and then the marshmallow creme all before he started cooking the sugar and milk mixture.  We used the 9 x 13 pan per the recipe and it was the perfect thickness.  We took some to a family get together today and it received rave reviews!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe turned out perfectly!  Like other reviewers, I mixed my pb, mallo cream and flour together ahead of time and had it ready.  I used whole milk and once the mixture started to boil I set my cooking timer for 5 mintues. Once I removed it from the heat, I used my hand mixer for a little over a minute mixing in the pb, mallo and flour mixture, and then poured in it my pregreased baking dish.  Slightly over an hour later it was ready to cut and it is PERFECT!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This was my first time making fudge.  It turned out perfect!  It was starting to set before I even got it in the pan.  I think the key to this recipe is making sure the sugar/milk/butter mixture boils long enough.  

I will be making this again.  I can't wait to give this fudge as a gift.  Thanks for sharing Debby!

I just made a double batch of this, and it turned out really well, much to my surprise!   I only meant to make a single batch, but I screwed it up.   I read the reviews that said to premix the flour, PB, and marshmallow crime.  I meant to do that, but I was ticked off at my boyfriend, and took it out on the fudge apparently.

I premixed the flour, PB, marshmallow crime, a bit of vanilla, AND THE SUGAR!   I didn't want to throw all that away and waste money, so I decided to double the recipe to see what might happen.  I added more PB, flour, and marshmallow creme to the mixing bowl, and mixed it in.

I put a cup of butter, 2 cups of (almond) milk, and 4 cups in the pan.  I stirred constantly for five minutes after it came to a boil, them mixed in the premixed stuff.  I decided to let it get to a slow boil,stirring constantly, for another 5 minutes.

I was scared as I poured it into the two pans and slipped them into the fridge.  

I had some of the concoction on the spoon that I set on the counter.  After the pans were in the fridge, I picked up the spoon and realized the drips that were on the counter were already starting to set up!!!

I checked the pans in the fridge, and OMG, they were setting up!   

Now I have 7 1/2 pounds of yummy fudge, minus the couple pieces I've already eaten.   That's not a bad thing, however, since PB fudge is our favorite.   

Time to go taste another piece to make sure it still tastes yummy.

And I'm over being ticked at him, too.  Lol

I'd used the same recipe for peanut butter fudge the past few years at Christmastime. The other day I found this recipe and figured what the heck, I'll try it. I'm so glad I did- this is my new go-to recipe!!! The smallest can of peanut butter they had at the store was 16 oz, so I went ahead and used the whole thing. I added a couple of drops of vanilla to the sugar syrup before boiling. I did as others suggested and beat the peanut butter, marshmallow cream, and flour together. I thought I had probably screwed it up at that point because it was kind of a crumby mess, but once I added it to the boiled liquid and mixed it up real well with a rubber whisk, it all melded together perfectly. Love it!

It has a good taste, but it is as hard as a brick and super crumbly. I would definitely NOT use the flour.

Everyone loved this fudge! I couldn't stop eating it when it was warm. I made it exactly like the recipe, but the second batch I tried using less flour and it turned out crumbly the next day.

I've make 10-15 batches of fudge at the holidays and more during the year. I never could get peanut butter fudge to come out well so I stopped making it a few years ago. I reduce the sugar in my fudges because there is such a thing as being overly sweet but this recipe works out great as is. I was hesitant because it uses twice as much sugar as I use in fudge but the flour cannot be tasted and it makes the peanut butter fudge set up better than all other recipes I've tried. Great recipe, thanks.

Okay, I REALLY cheated. I read the recipe and some of the reviews and decided to mix a little from here and a little from there. Due to neuropathy in my hands, I'm don't always get full use of them. I mixed the peanut butter and marshmallow cream in my KitchenAid mixer, adding small amounts of (sifted) flour until all were combined. Then, I combined the butter, sugar and milk (I used evaporated) in a heavy bottom pan and slowly boiled (stirring constantly) until it reached 240 degrees on a candy thermometer (took much longer than 5 minutes). I poured the hot mixture into the peanut butter/marshmallow/flour and beat it using the mixer. When it was smooth, I poured it into a foil lined dish and it turned out great! The easiest and best I've ever made.

This is THE best peanut butter fudge recipe I've ever made.  I was a little skeptical w/the flour, but it's so rich and creamy. I've made it every Christmas for the past 3 yrs and have never had any problems and so many compliments.  I have to constantly share the recipe.

As written, this is a 3.  DO NOT use 2/3 cups of flour.  That's way too much and makes the batch crumbly when you try to cut a piece.  I threw that batch out and made it again with 1/4 cup.  Better, but I'm not even sure it needs that much.

I have been using this recipe for years and I love it. Recently my daughter had to switch to a  gluten free diet. I decided to make this for her using Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix. It not only turned out wonderfully, but did not change the taste in any way! I have another friend I made it for who has Celiac disease and she loved it when I took it to our small group. The great thing is everyone in the group loved it. If you use Pamela's, be aware the flour has a grainy look to it, but I think it gives the fudge a little more character, sort of an old-fashioned look.

I'm not sure what happened but this fudge was dry and crumbly and I didn't like the taste either.  I'm sure I must have done something wrong considering all the wonderful reviews but since I didn't care for the taste of the fudge I won't try again to get the creamy consistency.

I'm challenged in the kitchen and this was easy and turned out great.  Took the advice of others and mixed the PB, marshmallow creme and flour.  Also cut the flour back to 1/2 cup.  Will definitely make this again!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it had less sugar. It could be my taste buds, but i found it way too sickly. Other than that, it IS a great recipe! Really easy and i have been looking for a fudge recipe that does not have condensed milk in it. I followed some other peoples suggestions and mixed the peanut butter and marshmallow fluff first- good idea! I also used chunky peanut butter just because that's what i had at hand. It gave it a little bite mmmm. Thank you SO much for the recipe! I love this website!!

I made this 2 times. I had made PB fudge many times & thought I try this one cause I lost my recipe when I moved. It never harden. The first one I made, I made it like the recipe called & the 2nd like what some of the other revewers said to make it better for the problem I was having. Still the same problem. I wanted this to work for me for this Holiday. Hopefully I'll be able to find my recipe after I get everything unpacked. That recipe is the best I ever had. It won 1st place out of the fudge cook off here in Arkansas.

This is a very good fudge! I also mixed the marshmellow creme, peanut butter and flour before hand. I also used Evaporated milk instead of my 2% that was in the frig. This took about 9mins on a gas range on appox. med high heat for it to get to soft ball stage. I used the electric mixer to beat it. just took mins to be ready to put into my pan, and set in around 15 mins room temp.

This is the best peanut butter fudge I have ever made! Everyone that eats it raves about it. I used Maranatha Organic No Stir Peanut Butter(make sure peanut butter is at room temperature for easy stirring). Has less oil and really helps to firm nicely. Plus, no nasty pesticides from peanuts. My family requires me to make this for all family functions and several batches at Christmas to give away as gifts.

five stars- this is amazing!!! so soft and smooth! not dried and crumbly like other pb fudge recipes! the only catch is that you have to let it sit for about a day to let it 'set' so the peices dont stick to each other, etc. if you do that its heaven!!!

I could not believe how great this recipe was. Very easy and quick to make. It set up very quickly and tasted delicious. I put an 18 oz. jar of peanut butter in as it is one of my favorite foods. As for being too sweet as others said...NOT TRUE...It tastes like fudge which is always very sweet. I poured it on my large cookie sheet which has sides and melted chocolate chips on half...PERFECT....We loved it!!!

I eliminated the flour and reduced the butter in half. I boiled the mixture until soft ball stage which was about 5 to 7 minutes. Excellent.

I can't believe that this recipe has gotten so many 5-star reviews when it is soooo not a 5-star fudge.  I made exactly as the recipe calls for and it is way too sweet.  I usually like things overly sweet but not to the point that it hurts to eat it.  I felt like I needed to go to the dentist for a teeth cleaning after one bite.  My husband, who eats anything, suggested throwing it away.  So we did.  This is the first time that I have tried a recipe from this website with such high reviews that did not turn out good.  Ick.

I have been looking for a fudge recipe that wouldn't stay too soft, and this is it!  The blend of flavors, and the texture is perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

Easy to make and delicious.  I gave the fudge as part of Christmas gifts and everyone loved it.
The only addition I would make to the recipe is to say that the mixture should be cooked in a dutch oven.  I had it in a saucepan and when it boiled it rose up and was about to run all over the stove. I had to quickly fetch a big dutch oven to finish cooking it.

This was the BEST and EASIEST fudge recipe I have ever made. I followed others' advice and blended flour with marshmallow creme and peanut butter together, then added.
When partially set, I melted 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1 TBS. of shortening, and poured over top of fudge. What a keeper this one was. Easiest thing I made over the holidays!!!
Thank you very much!!! (My dentist will thank you too, ha!)

This is an awesome recipe.  Came out perfect from the first batch! Very easy to make and not too sweet.
We set the fudge in Reynolds Funshapes Baking Cups and gave them as gifts with unanimous requests for the recipe.

I just made this in the microwave in one of those 4 quart pitcher/bowls, using 18 oz. of creamy peanut butter.  It is without a doubt the WBPBF!  You have to stand at the microwave and stop to stir it VERY often or it will boil over quickly, but no worry about scorching on the stovetop.  Once it boiled, 5 minutes cook time exactly is what I used, but stopping to stir maybe every 30 seconds was worth it not to have a mess or scorch it.  I just left a wooden spoon in it while cooking. My first time to make this but not my last....Yummy!  Now I prefer it over chocolate fudge.

I followed the recipe exactly and the fudge turned out beautifully.  I don't say that lightly because I can NEVER make good fudge.  I can't wait for my husband to come home from work.  He'll be really surprised!  I've never seen another recipe that added flour and I was afraid I would be able to taste it but the fudge is very good.

This was wonderful.  Everyone that has had it asked for the recipe.  I did mix the peanut butter and flour.  The marshmallow I just added to the bowl of peanut butter and flour to pour into the saucepan.  I also brought the butter, sugar and milk to 220 degrees.

Words cannot possibly describe how wonderful this recipe is! I made my first batch of it 15 minutes ago and am going to start another as soon as I am done with this review because it will be gone before I get another bite!  One thing, I followed all of the suggestions in the rating by tunisianswife and it came out perfect. You MUST try this recipe!!!

I always thought my Grandmother made the best peanut butter fudge.  I have tried many times to make it and others, but they NEVER ever turned out.  This fudge turned out perfectly (followed instructions to the letter)and we think it's even better than my grandmother's who stands over a stove for over an hour making hers!
Thank you so much!  We love it!  Definitely a keeper!

Want a great gift idea?  Make this fudge per recipe, pour into individual foil-lined mini baking pans, and push in (gently!!) "Reeses premier baking pieces" (they are tiny peanut butter cups) when almost cool.  I use the non-stick mini baking pans that are heart shaped, but they have all different kinds.  When set and completely cool, trim any extra foil around pan, wrap with colored plastic wrap, and tie with ribbon.  These are great little gifts for neighbors, coworkers etc...because you can do many at once.  They love getting to keep the little pan, too.

This is a fantastic recipe if you follow the directions.  Peanut butter fudge by nature is always a tad drier than a chocolate fudge, but this recipe had the perfect peanut butter taste and a very creamy texture.  Great!

I prepared this recipe for a Thanksgiving Day treat.  Every single bit of fudge disappeared while the pumpkin and coconut custard pie remained uneaten!  It's easy to make, although I did have reservations about adding flour.  I decided not to tempt fate and did include the flour, but I think next time I'll cut it by half.  This is definitely a recipe I'll use again!  In fact, I've already given the recipe to several of our Thanksgiving revelers!

Made this with my granddaughter Jacie (11) before Christmas and she practically made it by herself. Everyone liked it so much I had to make another batch tonight. Both times it turned out perfectly. So smooth and creamy.  Never became crumbly and set perfect. I lined my pan with aluminum foil and lightly coated the foil with butter. Easy to pull of out of the pan to slice. Will be making this one of my go to fudge recipes- reminds me of my mother's . She has been gone for over 23 yrs- and never could find her recipe. She had always made several varieties of fudge for Christmas. Thanks for letting me carry on her tradition with my granddaughter- taste just like mom's.  (Not many things can equal -mom's cooking) Thank you!

So good! Everybody in my house loves it. I'm really happy with this outcome because it's been a few years since I made fudge. The first time I made it using another recipe it was good but the  last time it turned out like gritty soup and I was hesitant about trying again. Glad I found this recipe because I think it was the flour that held it so well. I'd prefer just a little bit more crumble to it though, otherwise, so tasty and there's plenty of it!

First time I've ever made fudge and it came out amazing!  I was a little unsure about cooking the sugar so long but glad I stuck with my gut and waited for a full boil before starting the timer :-D

I found this recipe here a few years ago and I have never had it fail.It seems that every time I'm putting in the flour , I'm tempted not to put the full 2/3 cup in, but I do and it is always soft creamy and sets up perfectly every time. So put the full 2/3 cup in. You can't even tell it's in there.

I have made this peanut butter fudge recipe dozens of times and it has always turned out perfect from the very first time.   You must try it.  Don't start the timer until it is at a full boil.  The texture of the fudge is smooth  and creamy.  A must try, you will be hooked!!

Excellent fudge recipe! I did like the rest suggested and used evaporated milk also added 1 tsp vanilla.  I sifted my flour and it worked very well then added my peanut butter and marshmallow cream. I cooked the fudge until 228 after it started to boil turned it down to low so 5 mins was just about right for my stove. It began to set up fast after everything was added and blended well.

Made thes two years now and it's been the creamiest pb fudge I've ever made. Like others, I added a tsp. off vanilla and I premixed the fluff, peanut butter and flour. Didn't need a candy thermometer! Love this recipe, thanks!

First attempt at making fudge and it came out perfectly! I wasn't sure if you stir constantly during boil, but I did so the bubbles wouldn't overflow, turned the heat down a bit and it was super! I too, was hesitant about the flour-- but followed it all, it was easy and delicious! My daughter who was skeptical and said it looked gross tried it and loves it! I had to fight her to stop eating the whole tray!

Just tried this recipe!  Yum!  Turned out perfect.  I did mix peanut butter, marshmallow cream and flour together  with my stand mixer prior to mixing into fudge.  When I first added it I thought it wasn't gonna mix in but kept at it and it turned out great !

I liked this recipe a lot! My family raved over it-- my brother who hates fudge asked to take some home because he liked it so much. However, I did make some changes. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I also premixed the flour, peanut butter, and marshmallow cream as other reviewers suggested. It took quite a bit of stirring, but it did combine into a smooth mixture. One thing to note: I made this on a direct heat-to-pot electric stove top, so I put it on medium heat to get it to a boil, and then once it was boiling turned it down to below medium heat, then let boil for 5 minutes. This worked out quite well, it did not burn, and a previous recipe I tried did. I also like the bottom of a 9x13 pan with parchment paper, and then sprayed the whole thing with Pam, paper included. It popped right out once cool and the paper came right off. I really suggest this if you're looking to cut it into nice squares. Overall, it was delicious-- the flour definitely made it a little less creamy and more cookie-dough, flour-y taste as a couple days went by and the fudge dried out. I did not mind this though, the fudge was delicious! And easy to make.

There is a better recipe that I lost that am trying to find.. A recipe that makes a similar peanut butter fudge with marshmellow crème that is not so grainy and sugary..  This one is grainy and super sweet with sugar grains predominating making the texture not so great.

Followed recipe TO THE LETTER this morning. I was a little leery to make it (am known for my fails in the candy department). IT TURNED OUT PERFECTLY. Initially thought the batter was not thick enough when poured into the cake pan, but come to find that it set up perfectly(well as perfect as I can be) fudge. Had made sure to time my boiling from when it started to be a rolling boil on med heat.  Thank you for sharing this easy peasy recipe.  My thighs, on the other hand, have a totally different review!

Great, except I always buy unsalted butter. I should've added just a little salt to take away some of the sweet.

I made this for the first time and it turned out great!  Like others, I also mixed the peanut butter, marshmallow cream and flour (and 1t. vanilla flavoring) together . After I added the mixture to the sugar and butter I added about 1/4 C more flour because it looked a little thin. I stirred until in started getting thicker, poured it in the pan and it hardened in less than an hour.  It wasn't hard and crumby at all and it tastes great.  I will be making this again.

This fudge is delicious and super easy. It's the first time I've made fudge, and I honestly only chose this recipe because I never have evaporated or condensed milk on hand. I'm glad I did, and I'll definitely be making this recipe again and again.
I made three changes in this recipe: I used 1 cup (8 oz instead of 7 oz) of marshmallow creme, 2 cups (16 oz instead of 12 oz) of creamy peanut butter, and boiled my sugar mixture for about 5 1/2 minutes instead of 5.
I also mixed the peanut butter, marshmallow cream, and 1/3 cup of flour in my stand mixer (whisk attachment, though a paddle would work just as well I think) while my sugar mix cooked. When the sugar mix was done I turned the mixer back on and poured the sugar mix in, allowing it to melt the marshmallow and blend at the same time. When it was mostly blended I added the last 1/3 cup of flour. When mixed I poured it into a foil-lined pan sprayed with PAM, just to make it easier to pull out when it's cooled.
For those having trouble with gooey fudge, I suggest cooking your sugar mixture a little longer. It needs to be at 'soft ball' stage, forming a soft ball when dripped into a glass of cold water. Cooked too long may be the cause of the dry fudge some people were having.
Yummy! I can't wait to make more, and to try this recipe with chocolate.

The first batch I made turned out poorly.  The second batch turned out great!  The first attempt I used an altered version from a comment below the recipe.  The first attempt I followed the posted recipe and it turned out fantastic!!  Thanks so very much!!

I made this recipe because of the comments.  I followed the suggestions given.  I am not really a fan.  I feel other recipes are better and I didn't like the flour.

DELICIOUS!!! I will definitely make this again. My family love peanut butter will attempt to drizzle melted chocolate on it next time.
It is soft so do not attempt to cut it until you have chilled it inside the fridge for a bit.

Super easy & tastes fantastic. I mixed the pb, mm creme & flour as others suggested added abit of vanilla too. I also split the batch into two greased pans & added some chopped peanuts to one. Both are superb!

This definitely lives up to its name as "World's Best Peanut Butter Fudge" because it definitely is! I've tried many fudge recipes over the years, but once I discovered this one a few years ago, it's the ONLY recipe I will ever use.  My husband begs for this, especially during the holidays! I've given as gifts and everyone raves about the creamy texture.  We were recently at a candy store in Gatlinburg, TN, and paid a small fortune for some peanut butter fudge.  My husband took one bite and threw the rest in the trash because it did not even come close to comparing to this recipe!

I'm not a fudge fan and this was good. I used regular marshmallows melted a little bit because I didn't have marshmallow creme. It made a huge mess, but it turned out really well. 
If I ever have to make peanut butter fudge again I'll use this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, but for some reason mine did not turn out.  Not enough peanut butter taste for us, and a really strange consistency for fudge.

Very easy and easy to make, it also keeps well and does not melt too easily. Nice peanut butter flavor. Make sure you mix flour, fluff, and PB ahead of time, though.

Definitely the best! I disagree with the comment about not needing the flour. It is definitely not an unnecessary step. The flour is what makes this fudge soft even after several days (if it lasts that long!). Without the flour, it will begin to crumble and dry out. Love this recipe!!

A very easy and tasty fudge.  If your fudge is not setting up, your not cooking it long enough or a high enough heat.  I started boiling mine on med high heat and cut it down just a smidgeon (between med and med high heat....every stovetop is different) and boiled stirring constantly for 5 min to 5 min and 30 seconds.  Even that was almost too much and started to set before I could barely finishing mixing.  Using the right amount of ingredients and cooking on the right temp for 5 min or so will bring positive results every time.  You do not need a thermometer if you follow the steps precisely in the recipe.  Pre-mixing the MM cream and PB and flour is useful and a dash of Watkins Vanilla Nut Extract added to the PB mixture makes this an extra special fudge.

Wow, I grew up with a special recipe from the family and loved it so much. However, this is by far the best peanut butter fudge I have ever had. Even in specialty shops. Hard work but more than worth it. I can't wait to see how my friends and family feel about it.. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is delicious.  I was out of milk so I used half and half and this is the creamiest fudge I've ever made.  It's also very simple.  I did take the advice of others and mixed the marshmallow creme, PB and flour in advance and then added the hot sugar mixture.  Just a little stirring and it was combined and very smooth.  Very good recipe.

This was my first time making fudge and it is wonderful! This recipe is so yummy! I followed other reviewers instructions to mix the PB, mallow, and flour. I didn't have quite enough PB (about 9 oz) and it was still nice and PBy. Also I put only 1/2 cup of flour. You HAVE to try this recipe!

I have to say that I was a little leary of a fudge recipe that included flour. With that said, this turned out to be the most amazing peanut butter fudge I have ever made! My family just loved it! As soon as I poured it into the pan to cool I sprinkled baking Reese's pieces on the top for a festive topping & it was amazing!

Heaven in a cube! Made me feel like a kid in Mom's kitchen all over again. I cooked the sugar mixture 6 minutes, used evaporated milk and added 1 tsp vanilla. And, I like to use super-chunk p/b. Adds a tad bit of texture. I added the p/b, marsh creme, 'nilla and flour one at a time, mixing thoroughly after each. By the time I poured the fudge into the pan it was ready to set. Didn't need to chill. Came out as smooth as silk. I will definitely make this again. Too yummy to keep just for Holidays!

This recipe was amazing!  I'm used to famous Mackinaw Island peanut butter fudge and didn't think anything could come close to it, but this did! I followed the recipe and just boiled the mixture for 5 minutes, even though I have candy thermometer. I premixed the butter and peanut butter in my mixer and mixed it all together.  Beware, it made a 9x13 pan of fudge.  For my husband and I, I thought this was more than we could eat.  However, when I started cutting up about half the pan for us to take into our works, he said "You're giving it all away!!!!", even though there was still half a pan left.  I guess he liked it! :)

Good fudge! I was looking for a recipe that I could make with ingredients on hand. (didn't have evaporated or condensed milk, chocolate chips, powdered sugar, etc.)  I didn't have marshmallow creme but used 1/2 bag (about 8oz) of miniature marshmallows. Didn't have the required amount of peanut butter either, so used what I had & added 1/2 cup Hersheys cocoa to the mixture to be boiled. So it was really chocolate fudge but I could also taste the peanut butter. Also, I boiled it much longer than 5 minutes. Didn't have a candy thermometer & I was pretty sure 5 minutes wouldn't be enough, so I cooked it to the soft ball stage. Didn't want to take a chance of it not setting up! Used real butter in the recipe & also to grease a glass 9x13 baking dish. Very rich & sweet, much better than the quick & easy recipes!! Gave it a 3 star because of the cooking time....I read a lot of the reviews that said it wouldn't set up, and that's due to the 5 minute boiling time.

WOW, this is really good!  I followed advice to use the candy thermometer to soft ball stage (240 degrees) but wish I had used a bigger pan.  The milk bubbles up a lot while it's boiling. I added a little vanilla extract.   This is a favorite I"ll be serving with my fantasy fudge for the holidays.

This recipe is so easy and it tastes wonderful! I made some for my husband's family and they were raving about how good it was. They said it tasted just like the fudge Grandma used to make, but nobody has duplicated it until now. Recommended for everyone!

This recipe was fantastic.  I have been meaning to make this fudge for the holidays  but have never actually done it.  Today is my mom's birthday, so I made her a chocolate mayonnaise cake and topped it with this fudge (I halved the recipe and it worked perfectly).  This is just like my Grandma Margaret used to make.  Eating it makes me feel five again.  Thank you!

I think that the reason mine crystalized was because I put it in the fridge to try to get it to set - I think that was my mistake.  It probably needs to cool on the counter.  Also - I didn't give this more stars because it seemed like *WAY* too much sugar and not enough peanut butter.  I think to be fair I'll give it one more try and see if I can get the desired effect.

A Huge Hit!  I used Natural peanut butter, because of the hydrogenated oil (trans fat), and it didn't turn out as firm as I would have liked.  Next time I will use Natural NO STIR peanut butter, and I think it will be even better.

All I can say is more of the same - it's marvelous fudge, came out just perfect, didn't have to be refrigerated, and you absolutely can't detect the flour that guarantees success! I did take previous reviewers' advice and mix flour with other ingredients instead of waiting to add it last, and cooked it as prescribed even though I'm a dyed-in-the-wool thermometer junkie, and it came out just perfect. Cuts easily, does not shatter when pieces are removed.

I felt like a rock star after making this fudge!!  This was my first time ever trying to make any sort of fudge, and this recipe caught my eye since it was SO easy and not too detailed. I made it EXACTLY as it reads, poured it into a dish sprayed with butter-flavored Pam and put in the freezer for a few hours to sit up and it came out just perfect. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to impress their friends and family with easy, great and delicious PB fudge!

Disaster!  I added vanilla like some suggested and also whipped pb and creme.  The mixtue did not come together when I added the hot to the pb/creme.  First recipe off this site that was rated as highly yet turned out to be a disaster.  Not worth trying again.  A number of other fudge recipes on this sited rated as high that I would try again.  This popped up on the front page when I opened the site over the holidays - wish I had looked for more recipes first.

I am not a candy maker - at all!!! And I am not a great baker. This recipe was so easy. I even fudged (pun intended!) on the amounts of each ingredient. I didn't want to measure out the exact ounces of peanut butter and marshmellow creme, so I just adjusted by eye balling it. I didn't use a candy thermometer, and if I had one, I wouldn't know what temp it should even be! I don't know if you normally put flour in fudge, but it turned out great, so I say go for it! My husband wasn't excited about me making this, but now he keeps sneaking more. If I had to guess the key to my success, it was really letting the milk, sugar, butter mixture get to a good boil and then letting it cook for quite a while at that boiling point, constantly stirring. I cooked this mixture for about 7-8 minutes once it reached a good boil. I didn't pre mix any of the other ingredients, just added them after I took the milk mixture off the stove. The peanut butter and marshmellows melted into the mixture just fine and came out smooth. Then I added the flour and poured it all into a greased pan. I left it on the counter to cool for a couple of hours and viola - yummy fudge! If this recipe were any more complicated, I wouldn't make it!

I've been using the allrecipes site for over 5 years. And only in that time have I rated one recipe a 5 star. Well today the time has come again! This fudge is the best. I was questioning the flour too, but it makes it set quickly and perfectly. My husband (a fudge lover!) said this is the best I've ever made.
Thanks for the recipe!

It tasted fine but it was not firm at all and I could not cut it into pieces.  I ended up using some it for ice cream by mixing it with the ice cream mix.  The rest of the fudge, I put them into a freezer and made balls and covered with powder sugar.

Most Delicious Recipe!   Everyone who tries this fudge loves it.  I have attempted fudge many a times and it usually turns out runny and never hardens.  This recipe is simple and it even set like real fudge.  Some people have said that it is not overpoweringly sweet  like most fudge.

I also used a hand mixer to mux the last 3 ingredients. Then I used the mixer and just mixed it all together.  It turned out very creamy and yummy.  This is a keeper!

The flavor of this fudge was quite good.  However, I would make a few changes because it did not set up for me until I put it in the freezer.  1.  Make sure the temperature gets up to 240 2.  Don't use a 9x13 inch pan.  Use a large cookie sheet (believe me there will be plenty to fill the pan) unless you want really thick cubes of fudge

This was awesome!!!! I've made it 3 times and love it everytime. Everyone else loves it too. I added a little bit more peanut butter to the recipe and a little less flour since some people said it was crumbly. I didn't have a problem with it and my entire family at xmas loved it! Definitely a keeper

Tasted good, but that is it.  It was way to dry.  You couldn't cut it becaused it was would crumble.  Big disappointment.  I guess it would be okay on ice cream, but that is pushing it.

I was worrie about this because the ingredients weren't what I usually use in my fudge.  I mixed the second half of the ingredients (fluff, peanut butter, flour, etc.) together and then added them to the heated mixture. It turned out wonderfully!  This is my new pb fudge recipe.

An easy and delicious recipe.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and skim milk in place of whole milk.  Since I am one who enjoys experimenting with recipes, I also added 18 ounces of peanut butter, and a bag of Hershey's semi-sweet chips.  I followed one of the reviews that I had read and so while the sugar, chocolate chips, milk and butter were cooking I blended the peanut butter and marshmallow cream together with my electric mixer. When I added the hot syrup and flour, I beat it well for a couple minutes so the flour was thoroughly mixed in. This recipe is one that I will make often. Thanks for a great recipe!  My "fat cells" are smiling.

Delicious!  I used heavy cream instead of milk, which was fine.  The only pan I had was a 9x9, and when I make it again I will halve the recipe.  The flour makes it wonderful!!  I highly recommend making it.

Instead of boiling for 5 minutes, heat to 238 on a candy thermometer and everything turned out great.  The entire pan was gone in a week

I really liked it, though it was very sweet, and I didn’t put enough peanut butter in mine.

I accidentally forgot to put the flour in, and after putting it in the fridge for an hour or so, it turned out great. I ate it with chocolate chips, so it also had that chocolate-y taste. I thought it was perfect.

Followed the recipe and it just didn't turn out great. It says to cook for 5 minutes after it's brought to a boil. I think it probably needed 8-9 minutes. Fudge didn't set. Tastes nice but definitely need a spoon to eat it. Better fit as an ice cream topping than anything else. Might try again to see if I can get better results, but may just go with another recipe.

I've been making this fudge for the last 4 years!  I use crunchy peanut butter, but either way is good.  I usually boil mine for about 30 seconds longer just to be on the safe side, but it hasn't failed me yet.

Easy to make. I used creamy peanut butter. Next time I'm going to use crunchy and add a little more peanut butter.  I'm wondering if I could cut back on the sugar also. I would like more of a peanut butter taste with a little less sweetness.

It’s good - but not as hard like I expected it to be. Also seems a bit too sweet for fudge. I would use less sugar next time.

Very good.  My friend recommended this recipe to me.  It’s a little dryer than other fudges. I think it might be because of the marshmallow cream. I mixed my marshmallow cream, peanut butter and flour together first.  I boiled for 5 minutes at medium high.  Do not walk off and leave it boiling.  Stir it good at least every 5 minutes. If you don’t, it will start to scorch  and it will make little brown pieces in your fudge.  I lined a 9x13 dish with aluminum foil that I greased with a stick of butter.

I've been making this minus the flour for years. I tried it with the flour to see the difference. All it did was add a flour flavor to it.

Skip the flour...it is NOT needed!!!

I have made this fudge dozens of times.  For those who have a problem with the fudge not becoming firm after setting and stated that it was too soft--here is some candy making advice from a real candy maker that I received after having the same problem:. Don't make this fudge recipe on a rainy or humid day, because it won't set.  Something about humidity affects the cooking process.  I have found this to be true.  If I make it on a rainy day, it's too soft. 
 Also, if you cook it too long, it becomes very dry and crumbly.  To save time, I mix the peanut butter, marshmallow cream, and flour together while waiting for the mixture to boil.
 You can vary the recipe by using caramel peanut butter, etc.  After spreading in the pan, I top with colored sugar crystals for the holidays.

It was delicious but a bit too crumbly for my taste.  I sifted out 2/3 cup all-purpose flour; next time I will use 1/2 cup and follow the rest of the directions as written.  I also used extra fine sugar and cooked it in a pot for five minutes...no candy thermometer needed.

Everyone in the office enjoyed it. It is the best I have ever made. I add 1/2 cup more peanut butter than the recipe calls for and fold in a bag of chocolate chips before pouring in pan to cool. Fantastic!

This is excellent fudge and when I make it no one can only eat one piece.  I use Jiff Extra Crunchy peanut butter.  One important change is that this has to be cooked for about 10 minutes after it comes to a boil.  I started at five as the recipe calls for but it was soupy.  However, I liked the taste so much, I did more batches before hitting on about 10 minutes at the "sweet spot" for this recipe.  Now it is the only one I will use.

I love peanut butter fudge, but rarely eat it because most people's is too sugary!  This one was excellent, and it was my first time ever making fudge, so that says something for this recipe.  Watch the video, it has helpful information.

Thanks.

This is my new go to peanut butter fudge recipe.  I did mix the flour, peanut butter and marshmallow cream together ahead of time which made this a quick and easy recipe.  I also used evaporated milk as other reviewers suggested and it was perfect.

Ridiculously  good!  Followed the recipe exactly except I blended the peanut butter, marshmallow, and flour in stand mixer while the sugar mix boiled.  Made three different types of fudge and this one was the best!

I only used 3 cups of sugar. I added about 20 oz. of  chunky peanut butter and 5 oz. of marshmallow cream and it turned out great. My wife is very particular about the texture of fudge and she loved it

I am a guy who doesn't know how to cook anything.  But I really wanted some homemade peanut butter fudge.  My wife (who is a really good cook) did not know how to make it.  I found this recipe and decided to try it.  I followed all of the directions and it came out great, it was even better than my mother's.  If someone like me can make this great fudge anyone can!

It was the best peanut butter fudge I have ever had!!!  I can't believe it.  It was only the second time I have ever made fudge and it turned out amazing.  Super easy to follow instructions, make it exactly the way it states.

This fudge fits its name. Creamy yummy. I made with 1 cup peanut butter and a bag of chips. I added the chips after boiling the suger and butter and like others mixed the peanut butter and mm cream and flour and incorporated those and stirred stirred. ( actually the hubby stirred) this will be the only fudge recipe I will ever use.

I have made this recipe many times and have had no problem. I put the marshmallow creme and peanut butter on a paper plate ahead of time. I put the flour on a different paper plate. I put the rest of the ingredients into the bowl and I stir it constantly. When it is fully boiling, not just boiling around the edges, is when you start the five minute timer. If you still have trouble go to the store and buy yourself peanut butter fudge out of aisle 13 and stop wasting your time on poor reviews for this great fudge. This person deserves nothing but praise and gold barrels filled with mead.

Have made this half dozen times in past couple years and followed the recipe. Always turns out perfect and  any crumbs left over go on top of ice cream. That said after reading  a few reviews I  used evaporated milk and added  1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste and placed halved pecans on top for show!  Also pre-mixed my marshmallows creme, flour and peanut butter. Came out perfect as usual!
I wanted to attach a photo but for some reason could not make it work!!!

excellent fudge.   The secret to this is when it starts to boil, let it boil hard for 5 minutes. Then add your pbutter and marsh. creme.

Again like many others I premixed the mellow, flour and pb. If you lightly spray the bowl with nonstick spray it'll drop right into the hot mix. Also i used a candy thermometer but went on up to the softball stage. That's where it went with 5 minutes and it works well. I added about 1/4 more pb because we like it and a bit of vanilla. My kids fight over the bowl and spoon or whisk. This is by far the best pb fudge out there!

Made it kind of like recipe said but put in a little more peanut butter and a little bit more marshmallow creme. I also used evaporated milk. Made sure I boiled it the full 5 minutes. It wanted to burn but I turned it down. I had all the ingredients measured out and you have to move fast! It set beautifully! LOVED the pizza cutter idea! It cut beautifully. Very rich though!  Tastes great! Cut small.

It was an quick &  easy recipe to make; tasted ok. fudgelike, but not like true fudge.  The marshmallow is what gives it only 3 stars because even though it does taste 'peanut buttery' it still has that artificial marshmallow flavor as well.  Will stick to my mother's old fashioned homemade fudge recipe next time.

Really good recipe! I changed the 12 oz of PB to 6 oz PB, 6 oz chocolate. Worked great.

One thing I'd suggest is to specify in the directions what kind of boil - a soft simmering boil? Or a rolling intense boil? I was unsure of this and went for a medium boil, and the fudge turned out a little gritty.

Followed the recipe and came out with a big goopy mess. Would need a spoon to eat this. And with the 4 cups or sugar the goopy mess is VERY sweet.

This fudge is REALLY good… and the recipe is very forgiving… I have made it with milk/evaporated milk/skim milk and it is all good…. I have also made with regular marshmallows and with marshmallow cream….I used 2 cups of brown sugar and 2 cups of white..  not a problem… I just follow the recipe directions.... have never had any need to use a mixer… just stir… when the mixture is boiling for five minutes… stir like crazy or it will burn… I also added a pinch of salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract…. EXCELLENT RECIPE…

Cooked up well.  I guess I am just not a big fan of  peanut butter fudge.  It needs a layer of chocolate

The is great fudge. The trick to making it or any other fudge, for that matter, don't start your timing until you have a full roaring  boil.  A roaring boil is when it continues to boil up when stirred. After cooling make sure it is kept in a cool place and in  is an air tight container so it does not dry out. This fudge holds up without getting too soft .

I made this last night, following the advice of TUNISIANSWIFE. Because I am so used to making more intricate recipes and using a candy thermometer, it came to much surprise that this recipe is just fantastically easy. I did add the extra peanut butter (instead of 12oz, I used 14oz or 1 3/4 of smooth Jiffy). Do NOT rely on a thermometer as she said, this fudge sets differently. MALLOW is the perfect word  to describe the texture. Soft, melty, delicious. I will be back for this one.

This was my first attempt at making fudge, I'm really impressed with how easy it is! The bonus part of this recipe is that it's GLUTEN-FREE as long as you use Jif brand peanut butter and Kraft Jet-puffed marshmallow creme!! My wife doesn't like fudge, she licked the spoon and says"that is really good!" Made me one proud hubby! Thank y'all so much for the AWESOME recipe!  ?? Smiley

I'm not a fan of peanut butter fudge but this one was delicious. I followed the directions exactly. Mixed the flour at the end...I thought it was a little creamier, not quite as thick as fudge I normally make but I went with it and it set up beautifully in a 9x13 pan. I used crunchy peanut butter, but I think creamy would be better if you don't want the texture.

This was such a simple recipe! The fudge was smooth, pretty and tasted great!!  I was nervous about how long to cook it after reading all the mixed reviews.  So...I timed it AND used a candy thermometer . The result?  At exactly 5 minutes, my candy thermometer read 248 - the temperature of softball stage.  My fudge turned out moist, but firm enough to cut and package.  Not dry at all!!  I do have a gas stove, so perhaps that helped in the timing/temperature issue so many others are experiencing.  I did take the advice of others and premix the peanutbutter, marshmallow cream and flour ahead of time using my electric mixer.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a good and easy fudge recipe and this one is it. My fudge never sets up but this one does. I got so many compliments. It is not real firm it is a little soft but to me just right. I used can evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I also, used candy thermometer 340 degrees. let it cool before pouring into pan. After put in pan refrigerate for 6 hrs. Tastes like real pb fudge should be.

First time making fudge with marshmallows and it was a hit. The only alternation I made was from the advice of other reviewers -  I mixed the flour, peanut butter, and marshmallow cream with a hand mixer prior to pouring the hot mixture into it. It turned out a bit on the dry side and crumbly with a very fine texture which I prefer to too creamy.

This was good but it just lacked that certain something that I remembered from my moms and me being a little kid. Either its not as good or my memory is just made them better. My kids all like this, but I still feel there is a better one out there.

I just tried to make this and had a little issue with it trying to figure out what I did wrong try the evaporated milk  and also milk the flour and peanut butter and marshmallow creme together. But I wonder if The flour mixing it in at the same time made it dry out a bit fast.  Cause started getting dry and crumbly on me

I wish people would put in amts as cups and not ounces! If I have a large jar of peanut butter, what do I add? 12 ounces does not just mean 1 and 1/2 cups as 12 ounces of marshmallows for example would not be 1 and 1/2 cups. I need the amt in cups please. Thanks.

My husband couldn't stop eating until it was all gone! We both loved it! I didn't change anything in the recipe. I didn't mix the peanut butter, marshmallow creme, or flour but did measure them out and ready to add to the recipe when needed. I didn't gradually add the flour, I just mixed it all in at once.  Can't wait to try the variations listed under the ratings.

So this started out as a complete disaster for me. I put the sugar, milk and butter in a saucepan and it boiled over out of control! Got syrup all over my stove and burners... Not sure what I did. HOWEVER I managed to save the syrup for the most part and this fudge is AMAZING! I also didn't mix the fluff/pb/flour, just made as directed and it was completely fine!

I made this recipe and no problems at all with it. It firmed up almost right away, the secret is to make sure you are stirring this stuff when you bring it to a boil and you have to do the entire 5 minutes at a boil. If you don't do that it will not firm up right. Please boil the mixture, I cannot emphasize it enough.

Turned out very nicely, though personally I'd prefer it to be a little less sweet.  Also premixed the PB, marshmallow, and flour.  I had to use a mixer in the end.

Thanks for the recipe :)

Too sweet by about 1 cup of sugar. I thought the peanut butter flavor was overpowered by the sugar in the recipe. Diabetes here I come

I used a bag of whole mini marshmallow instead of the creme and it turned out great.  I had to let the fudge set for 1 day for it to firm up (room temperature - though my house is cooler than most).

The flavor of this fudge is PERFECT!  The only difficulty I had was it never quite set up properly.  I think that if I had used peanut butter chips instead of a cup and a half of creamy peanut butter it would've been just right.  But, that really is not a draw back to me.  I don't like the really dry crumbly fudges, and the flavor of this stuff is truly off the chain.

I couldn't find my mom's recipe this year so I tried this one.  Even before I got it in the pan to cool, I could tell it was going to be good!  Set up very nicely and was smooth!  YUMMY!!!

Perhaps I didn't make this right, but I thought adding flour to fudge seemed odd. Turns out I was right...I could use it as a doorstop. Terrible.

FINALLY, a fudge recipe that actually lives up to it's name.  I used Carnation evaporated milk, Country Crock, a full 18 oz jar of pb 3 cups of sugar (still a bit sweet for my taste so I'll add a little less the next time) and about 1/2 c. of flour (only because I forgot to add the rest) and initially it appeared a little soupy but when I took it out of the fridge about 3 hours later, VOILA!  The best tasting an best textured fudge I've ever made.  This is an AWESOME recipe.  I did mix the flour, pb, marshmallow creme and butter together first like most of the other reviewers suggested and I didn't use a candy thermometer.  I just started stirring as soon as I got a vigorous boil and did that for 5 minutes just as the recipe says.  I will definitely make this again and take it to work.  Heck, I may even sell it, Lol!

This was very simple and tastes amazing. I followed some other reviewers advise and mixed the M. creme, peanut butter and flour together. I also boiled for about 7 minutes. This is the first time I have ever made peanut butter fudge and it turned out perfectly. I will def be making this again and again. So smooth and creamy.

Good fudge.  I doubled the recipe and put it into a jelly roll pan 15 1/2" x 10" that I had lined with greased parchment paper.  Made it easy to lift right out and easier for cutting.  I only gave 4 stars because although the fudge was good, I don't see the need to use the flour.  I only added about 1/3 cup for a double batch and it turned out fine.  I made another batch and didn't use any flour and it was equally good tasting and consistency.  I think that the flour is an un-necessary addition.  Otherwise great recipe.

I have made this great fudge several times now and it is always a hit. I prefer the pre-mix version in the side notes. I have also added a thin chocolate layer on the top and it is loved as well.

I have been looking for the perfect peanut butter fudge recipe for years and this is as close as I have found. It was simple to make and the taste was delicious. It was very creamy and had a great peanut butter flavor. I was skeptical about the flour at the end but it turned out great! Close to what grandma used to make. I will definately be making this again next Christmas.

One word...YUM! Made it JUST as it is written and it was AWESOME! Made two kinds of fudge and this one was all eaten up first! Thanks for a yummy recipe! The flour freaked me out a little bit. I thought...how odd, but it all turned out great!

Excellent. The recipe was simple and I followed it to the letter. I boiled the sugar, butter, and milk together for five minutes. I did not use a candy thermometer. It turned out fantastic- it didn't need to be put in the fridge to harden.

This fudge was very good.  Good peanut butter taste.  I did substitute four cups of large marshmellows for the MM cream (I used what I had).  Will def make this again.  Maybe try with crunchy pb.

I'm not sure what came out wrong with this fudge, but when it was finished, it crumpled and just didn't look very appealing. It tasted great, however. I'll have to try this recipe again.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever used to make PB fudge.  I really feel it works best with real butter and whole milk though.  Trying to make it lower fat made it get grainy.  Again, for someone like me, who isn't the best cook--this recipe ROCKS!!

Very easy to make and nice texture, but a little sweet. I drizzles some semi-sweet chocolate over top and then cut, and that cut down on the sweetness from the peanutbutter mixture. U could also use dark chocolate.

My roommate and I loved this! We were seriously addicted, eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and STILL craving it. Definitely the best. The only problem I had was that it had to stay in the refigerator, otherwise it would kind of melt.

We love peanut butter fudge...and this a very good recipe.  The only issue I have had is that it gets very mushy if left on the counter.  We have to keep it wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge.  I haven't used my candy thermometer when making this though, which I think I will try next time.  Other than that, it is EXCELLENT!

I am not sure what happened, I followed the recipe but my fudge would not set up firm and after two days in the fridge it got thrown out.

Great taste; keeps well; mine melts once out of fridge for > hour. I suspect it can often take 8-10 minutes, rather than 5.

Followed the suggestions below re: mixing order.

Not one I'll make again, really...

Flavor is very good and it is easy to make.  Just a time make sure that the sugar is disolved completely before proceeding to next step.  I was in a hurry and did not make sure and my candy was a little grainy tasting.

I am so excited!!! This was my first time making fudge. I followed others and premixed the flour, PB and marshmallow cream first. I only made 1/2 of what the recipe called for. I have had bad luck trying new things lately. I ran out of white sugar and used 1 c of white and 1 c of organic Florida crystals. I couldn't wait to taste it and tried it while I was whisking away and it tasted really good. Its setting really well. Very excited THANK YOU!!! It's a keeper!!!

I have made this three times now, and every time it turns out fabulous!  I have tried to make other fudges, and they never turn out.  Apparently this is my lucky recipe.  It's so easy and produces a fantastic product, and I have never had any complaints (even people who don't like peanut butter like this fudge!).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent and easy to make! This was a big hit and it makes a ton of fudge. This was one of 2 peanut butter fudge desserts brought to a party and mine was all eaten, leaving a whole plate of the other stuff! Lining the pan with foil was a life saver. I will make this again.

This is by far the best peanut butter fudge recipe I have tried.  The only thing I did differently is mixed the marshmallow creme, peanut butter and flour together before adding it to the butter/sugar mix as I noticed quite a few people recommended doing under the reviews.  Turned out great - it's so hard to keep out of!!

I made this recipe twice once with vanilla and once without. With the vanilla it was super soft melt in your mouth and delicious and without it was firmer, but less flavorful. I wish I could give this recipe 4.5 stars! Because its so easy and yummy!

This was way too sweet.  I am wondering if the ingredients here (Australia) altered the taste and didn't make it turn out as nice as all the other reviewers.  I had a really hard time finding marshmallow cream and perhaps what I found didn't work as well as it should have.  It really was too sweet to eat which was a bummer because my mouth was watering after reading all the positive reviews.

I love peanut butter fudge and this was by far the best I've ever had.  It was so soft and moist, not dry like most fudge.  I didn't change a thing with the recipe and it turned out perfectly.

This recipe couldn't be better or easier!! I've tried several from this site and this will definately be the one I use. I also added vanilla, and make sure you have it to a rapid rolling boil before you start timing the 5 minutes. I sometimes melt some choc chips and cover the top of the fudge. Tastes like a homeade reeses only better. Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  Tastes just like my grandma used to make.  I took the other members advice and used my kitchenaide to whip the marshmallow and peanut butter together first and then added the milk/butter/sugar hot mixture and whipped it all together before spreading in the pan.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla too.  I sprayed the glass pan with Pam and the fudge came out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe just as is. Took it to my Christmas party and everyone loved it. I did put it in refrig overnight before I took it  to work. I actually like fudge cooled and not room temp. just my preference. And I didnt use a thermometer either .. very easy and great tasting fudge

I'm going to give this five stars because the fudge is really, really wonderful. It did not firm up for me but I'm going to blame myself there. I got stingy with my white sugar and I substituted a cup and a half with brown. I also used generic peanut butter. I'm not sure if those two things made a difference but judging by the reviews- it was something I did wrong.

This peanut butter fudge was amazing. It was my first time ever making any type of fudge and it came out perfectly. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and like many others I blended the flour, pb and marshmallow cream first. I used about 14 oz of peanut butter and an additional tablespoon full of marshmallow cream. I followed the cook time exactly...and its the best fudge i've ever tasted

This was amazing fudge and ohh so easy!  I would recomend following the recipe instructions to a "t" and not cooking the sugar mixture to the normal soft ball stange that fudge requires. 
I love this recipe and will use it again and again!

I made this today and I wouldn't say it's the "world's best" but it's good.  In fact, I use the fantasy fudge recipe off the marshmallow cream jar to make my peanut butter fudge and this recipe tastes just like it.

Bingo! This is my third attempt and it worked...finally. First batch (another recipe)never set up. Second batch made with marshmallow fluff got cooked too long. This batch I used the creme. The difference was the pre-blending, although I was a little worried that I could blend that ball quick enough into the hot liquid before it started to set up, BUT success! Thank all of you for your hints for success!

My kids and I made this fudge and it turned out great I was worried because I never made peanut butter fudge with Flour in it before but this is by far the best it reminds me of the Fudge I buy when I go to the Lake of the Ozarks and pay a lot for it. Thanks we will be making this again and again

it was a little crumbly but not enough to even be close to an issue. very nice taste. i used it as the bottom layer to choc peanut butter cup fudge, using a choc fudge recipe from this site and reese's cups cut in half to garnish the top. went fast!

This is unbelievable!  I've never made any kind of fudge, and this came out just perfect.  I used chunky peanut butter (around 15 oz., eyeballing it) and drizzled the top with melted semi sweet chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely the best pb fudge recipe ever!!  I did as others suggested and mixed the mm cream, flour and pb together. I added 1 1/2 tsps of flavoring. Cooked only 5 minutes and it was just perfect.

I thiught this fudge was pretty good, but it was a bit too sugary.  Next time, I'll use a little less sugar and a little more peanut butter for more peanut butter flavor.  I usually don't care for fudge made with marshmallow creme, but I'll definitely make this one again!

I made many different kinds of fudge for the holidays this year and I think this one was everyone's favorite. It had a little different texture to it. It was really gritty for my taste, but the flavor was amazing.

Instead of using this as a fudge recipe, I would use this as a frosting recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and also the advice of some of the other reviewers, but the consistency of the fudge did not just turn out right. I definitely recommend refrigerating it to firm it up. That makes a big difference. Overall, it does have a good taste, though.

Tasted good, but...Didn't set up well, I was very dissapointed.  I will try it again and maybe try to cook it 1 minute longer. I don't know.  I measured everything to the tee and followed along, the only thing I did different was that I did as suggested added the flour to the peanut butter and the marshmallow cream.. I also used real butter.

Super easy and super tasty. This fudge came out moist and not gritty. I followed the recipe exactly on 3 seperate occassions. Turned out the same each time. That's important! No need to stir while it boils.

OMG this is the best sweet I have EVER tasted. It was so easy to make and turned out great even on the first try. It is so creamy and just melts in your mouth. I will never try another pb fudge recipe again.

Delciously rich and very simple! I plan to make it again for Christmas! its also interesting to add your choice of nuts(unsalted works best) to give it a nice crunch. Awesome recipe- just don't eat too much at once!

This was my first time making peanut butter fudge and it turned out perfect! I was very happy that the fudge was ready to serve in 2 hrs. The result is a perfect combination of peanut butter and sugar. It just melts in your mouth. Very easy to make, too. Thanks!

Unfortunately, I didn't take everyone's advice on not using any flour in this recipe.  I thought it would need the flour for substance because I used Adam's Peanut Butter which has a lot of naturally occuring oils.  When I took it out of the refrigerator & attempted to cut it, it began to crumble. Also, for some reason it tasted like there was way too much sugar in it.  Someone suggested I mixed it too long. I need Fool Proof Fudge recipes!=( My peppermint fudge didn't turn out either!  I even tried using a double-boiler....still no luck! My neighbors & friends are deprived of their Christmas Fudge!

This had a good flavor, but the texture was not like fudge. Maybe the flour messed it up? I will not make again though.

Began using this at Christmas this year and haven't stopped yet.  I am asked to make it for potlucks at work, Super Bowl Sunday, when company comes, and whenever my kids think they can get it!  It is VERY creamy and yummy - and I don't like PB fudge!  It's a WINNER!

This was tasty but the texture was all wrong....dry and crumbly.  I cooked a little less than the 5 minutes, will maybe add less flour next time.

Very good fudge and easy to make.  It has a rich PB flavor and tastes like the inside of an Reese PB cup.  I used chunky PB and cooked it on the stovetop for 10 minutes instead of 5.
