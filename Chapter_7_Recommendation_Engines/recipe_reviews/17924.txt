Folks, you can add this wonderful recipe to your breakmaker repertoire!   After mashing and measuring the potatoes, I cut all the ingredients in half, put everything in the breadmaker and processed on the "dough" cycle.  I did use one full tablespoon of yeast as per my machine manufacturer's recommendations, and I exchanged whole wheat flour for half of the flour, and the rolls were soft and delicious.  I've made these twice, and I find that I need to cover them loosely with foil before I put them in the oven, and remove the foil about a minute before they're done so they brown nicely.  Otherwise they were darkening too fast.  My family loves these.

I just sampled one of these from the oven; yes I burned my tongue but it was so worth it. I've been baking rolls for 30 years and these rolls top any I've ever baked. The texture is melt in your mouth and the taste is old fashioned and delicious. Except for supplementing the potatoes with potato flakes, I followed the recipe exactly. I made a dozen big fluffy crescents and then a dozen & a half cinnamon rolls from the rest of the dough, using a brown sugar, cinnamon, and pecan filling and topping them with a powdered sugar glaze flavored with maple. These are a perfect 10!

This is a TREMENDOUS bread dough recipie!  I didn't have baking potatoes on hand, so I made a cup of instant potatoes, and it was just as wonderful!  I even used this as a basic bread recipie instead of making rolls, and it was great.  I didn't let it rise in the fridge as specified, I let it rise in a warm place until it doubled--I was too impatient for it to rise overnight or for days!  :)  It is nice to know you can make it ahead, though.  It is very kid-friendly--my kids had fun rolling up the crescent shapes, and they loved the soft rolls after they were cooked.  Thanks, Colleen, for a wonderful recipie!

Made these rolls for Thanksgiving 2004. Fabulous. I made the basic dough using my the dough hook on my Kitchen Aid mixer, instead of kneading for 8 minutes & it worked fine. Two potatoes were too many. Recipe should read "enough cooked potato to make one cup." A rolling pin isn't necessary--just pat the dough out with flour-coated fingers. The dough is too soft to cut with a knife--do this instead & it'll work great: take a pizza cutter & roll it in flour, then cut the dough into 16 pieces. Fabulous!

I made these for Thanksgiving and the result was exactly what I was looking for, a light, fluffy, rich tasting roll.  I recommend baking at 375. I scaled the recipe in half so I could do it in my bread machine.  I used 1 mashed yukon gold potato, butter flavored shortening (I use butter with a good result as well) and added 2 Tbsp. dry milk powder.  Even though I scaled the recipe in half I used an entire packet of yeast.  I added the ingredients according to the instructions for my bread machine and ran it on the dough cycle.  When it was done I sprayed a 9 x 13 pan with Pam, shaped the dough into balls and put them 4 across in the pan.  Covered with plastic wrap and stored in my refrigerator overnight.  On Thanksgiving I took the pan out of the refrigerator about 3 hours before I was ready to bake them and put them on my counter covered with a kitchen towel to let them come to room temperature and rise up (they will need at least 3 hours to do this).  I brushed the tops with butter once while cooking and again right after removing from the oven.  Amazing result!  I will make this frequently.

The instructions did not say to cream the shortening and sugar and when I mixed it with everything else, it was really lumpy looking. I just knew I had messed up the whole recipe.I decided to use my mixer for a few minutes on low to blend the liquids and potato together. That worked out real well.
I wanted a dinner roll, instead of a sweet type roll, so I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. It was definetely the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner this year. These were absolutely the best rolls I have ever made! Incredibly awesome! The recipe is one that I will use from now on.

Very tasty and high risers! The dough is very easy to handle. I would suggest cutting out some of the sugar if you intend to serve them as dinner rolls, but keep it as is if you want to make them into a sweet roll.

This recipe turned out great for me and it is so easy to tweak. I had to watch them in the oven closely because they can brown too much on the bottom if you are not watching. I made dinner rolls and cinnamon buns(just coated with melted butter and cinnamon and sugar on one side before rolling)from the same batch. It is a really big help around the holidays when, like me, you have several places to take food too; you need variety. The recipe is simple and quite versatile. You can add minced onion, garlic, or herbs to change things up. I served the regular rolls with honey, herb, and orange-cranberry butter... but who is to say that you can't add these ingredients to the batter? I look forward to trying a variety of additives to this 5 star winner!

Dinner roll nirvana. Light, tender, buttery, moist, yeasty little mouthfuls of deliciousness. The one and only recommendation I would make is to cut the sugar if you're looking for a dinner roll and not a sweet roll. I used 6 Tb, which gave a subtle hint of sweetness to the flavor, but stopped short of defining it as more appropriate for a sweet breakfast roll. Easiest way to cut? Use a pizza cutter to cut your rolled circle into quarters, then divide those quarters in half to make eighths, then subcut those in half to get 16. All cuts need to intersect at one point in the center of the circle. After cutting, spread with the butter (I don't melt - just use softened butter. Melting is an unnecessary extra step and one more item to wash) then roll up each wedge as described in the directions. Be sure to wait sufficient time after shaping the refrigerated dough into individual rolls for a complete rise. For me, that took about an hour and 20 minutes (your timing could be more because of kitchen temp. I'm in south FL, so it's always pretty warm.) This step yields the maximum lightness of texture, just as rushing things will contribute to a heaviness in your finished product. I've made these countless times now. Perfect every time.  Superb heirloom recipe. Thank you for posting it.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving, and even stodgy old relatives raved!  I didn't have any shortening, so I used all butter in the recipe, but they were still perfect.  My little tip is to use a pizza roller to cut out the crescents...made it that much easier.  Amazing recipe!

Interesting.  Probably would have been better if I hadn't used canola oil margarine.  I couldn't find the shortening.  Still, they were tasty.  They probably deserve five stars, because of my error, but they get four because that was my impression.

These are rising as I type this. I was going to make a suggestion...use the water you boil the potatoes in for the water in the dough. While the potatoes are cooling, pour the water into a glass measuring cup and let it cool. I do this all the time when I am making my potato water bread. Its a very frugal way to get more flavor into the bread. And you are using something that would normally go down the sink! Will update on taste...

I really love this roll dough.  I would suggest using 1 Tbsp salt to give added flavor to the dough.  Also, I struggled to get uniform looking rolls whenever I rolled them out as circles then cut.  I suggest rolling half the dough out as a large rectangle about 14 x 21 inches long.  Brush on the melted  butter then using a pizza cutter, cut into smaller rectangles about 3 x 7 inches.  Then cut each rectangle diagonally corner to corner, like how Pillsbury cresent rolls come out of the tube, then roll each up from the wide end.  I found this much easier to get evenly divided.  I also did not refrigerate dough at all.  I let it rise once then cut dough into rolls and let rise before baking.  My kids and friends all loved these.

This bread is pretty great.  I made it for Thanskgiving and everyone wanted the recipe.  It was perhaps my finest work, and it wasn't real tough, though it did involve making a whole mess of the dough the day before and filling up the fridge.  Still, the final product is outstanding.  I didn't make them into crescent rolls, and I didn't add the butter at the end, but they were sitll great.  Thanks!

If you want to make these into crescents, you have to roll this into a much bigger circle than 12". Even with only half the dough, this is WAY too thick to roll into crescents. Roll a quarter of the dough until it is a 1/4" thick circle, then cut it into 8 triangles. Make each triangle even thinner by going over with a rolling pin before brushing on butter. - The taste of these rolls is fluffy! They puff up beautifully. Very nice. - Cooked at 350, not 400! ****I do bake these on the top rack, and brush with egg wash (egg white, 2tbsp water) before 2nd rise.

Most of my bread recipes use the yeast starter method of mixing water/milk, yeast, sugar and ~1/2C of flour then letting sit overnight in the refrig.  I am not sure I would leave raw eggs to sit in this recipe for the 'up to 5 days' mentioned.  Not sure that is a good idea.

I made these rolls for a family gathering today and my children, neices and nephews were eating them as they came out of the oven. I don't consider myself a great yeast bread maker but this recipe is wonderful and so easy. I'm looking forward to making them again.

Wow, this is wonderful! I have been baking bread and rolls for special occasions for years and this is now my new recipe. I replaced the shortening with Becel margarine for extra flavor and otherwise followed the recipe as stated. I've been waiting to write the review as I froze a batch on a cookie sheet then placed them in a freezer bag once frozen. When We were ready for more, I took a few out, covered them on a parchment lined cookie sheet and let them rise for about 4hrs. They were just as good as the first time, the freezing didn't effect them one bit. Thanks for sharing, it's great to have these all made in advance and to be able to take them out as needed. I should add that I used my pasta roller attachment for my kitchenaid to roll the dough. Probably why I wouldn't mind making tons at a time as it was so easy to make this way.

I usually go for the "bread machine" recipes, but this one caught my eye.  My family loves it.  It is easy to make and has a wonderful taste and texture.  I mix honey and butter to glaze the top with after baking.

These are yummy! I served them as the roll for a sandwich bar. I let them sit in the fridge for two days. One thing is that you only need one cup of mashed potato total for the recipe. I cooked two large potatoes and ended up only using part of them.

I found my Thanksgiving rolls!  This are light, airy and very tasty.  I followed the recipe to a T, using 2/3 C sugar, which I thought would be too sweet.  No worries....they were perfect.  I made 24 dinner rolls and 6 sandwich rolls.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Thank you, Thank you Colleen!  I will never use another store bought roll again!  This recipe made me look like a bread baking pro.  These were buttery, light, fluffy, rose like a dream, melt in your mouth dinner rolls.  I made these for Christmas Eve and again for Christmas Dinner, the cool rise method in the fridge allowed me to get the big prep out of the way and have hot, fresh rolls both nights.  I used instant mashed potatoes, and half salted butter/half shortening.  I debated about the amount of sugar after reading the other reviews, but I put in exactly what the recipe stated, and after trying the rolls, I felt it was the perfect amount.  I brushed the tops with melted butter after rolling into shape, and brushed again after they came out of the oven (about 15 minutes for me).  My family absolutely loved these rolls!  In fact, no leftovers, so I will be making these again for New Years!  Thanks Again!

Chalk this up as another glowing review!!  The dough was a pleasure to work with and rose very nicely.  I did have to add more than the 6 and one-half cups of flour (by maybe 1 more cup total) when I kneaded it, but they came out wonderful!  I decreased the sugar to one-third cup as per another reviewer since I was making them for dinner, and they were just right.  Make sure you roll them up tight...mine rose so much they started to "unroll" while they were baking.  Definitely didn't need to bake any longer than the 15 min...they were a little more brown than I like.  Thanks SO much for this easy make-ahead recipe!  No more excuses for not making hot, fresh rolls.  I think they would work well as other shapes, too...next time I'll try a cloverleaf!

You do have to make this in advance, but it is well worth the wait! The staff members I work with are such picky eaters, and yet, they all wanted this recipe! It is really good!

These rolls are very, very good!! I'm giving 4 stars because you don't "need" to wait 8 hours in the fridge. for them to rise. First I cut the recipe in half and it made 16 nice sized rolls. I used my kitchen aid mixer. Mixed water, sugar and yeast until proofed...10 min. then with dough hook attached, added all other ingredients adding flour a cup at a time until blended on slow speed. Then kneaded on a board for appx. 10 min. put in lightly oiled bowl covered with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Punched down dough, rolled into log and cut into 16 equal pieces. Rolled into balls, placed on baking sheet, covered with plastic wrap and let rise again for 30-40 min. baked at 350 for 25 min. came out great!!! Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe :)

When ever I make a Potatoe roll, I never discard the potatoe water, I cool the water, and use it as the water in the rolls, much better than plain water.

The rolls are delicious and tender, and boy do they rise nicely.
I only used 1/3 cup of sugar (because when I went to the pantry that's all I had - oops!) but it didn't matter.  They were fabulous.
I let the dough rise for 5 hours before shaping.  I made 1 pan of crescents and 1 pan of cinnamon rolls.  We had the crescents with dinner tonight and can't wait to try a cinnamon bun a little later for dessert.
Easy recipe to follow and simply great results.

Exceptional! So moist and delicious! One thing, READ THE DIRECTIONS! I left mine on the counter to proof instead of the fridge. THEN I moved it to the refrigerator, too late. See Photo. Hilarious!

Absolutely love this recipe. My husband, the picky one, has dubbed it his favorite.
I had to turn the heat down on the oven as it browned way too fast. I did add sugar to the yeast to cause foaming. I also used butter rather than shortning and added quite a bit more flour than called for. I was in a hurry and didn't put this in the fridge at all. I let it rise on the table and then baked. It was perfect!
Made them into blueberry pastries!

These are the most tender and delicious rolls ever!  And they were so easy to make. I used half of the dough for regular crescent rolls for dinner. I took advice from another review and used honey butter on them. Delicious!  Then I used the other half a couple of days later and turned them into cinnamon crescent rolls for breakfast.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I made these rolls to go with our Thanksgiving dinner yesterday.  I loved the fact that I could prepare the dough ahead of time and just let it rest in the fridge until about an hour and a half before we wanted to eat dinner.  Everyone raved out how tender and tasty these were; in fact, my daughters and my fiancee have already asked me to make them again soon!  Based on other reviews, I reduced the sugar to just under 1/2 cup and I'll probably cut it back even further (to 1/3 cup) next time.  These will definitely be a regular in our house.  Thanks for a great dinner roll recipe, Colleen!

I've tried at least half of the roll recipes on here and these are the best, hands down. The slow, cold rise lends a tenderness and softness that you just don't get from a rapid rise. 
  As I am too impatient to wait most of the time, I double the recipe and use real butter instead of shortening. I've tried it with shortening and it does make a lighter roll but I dislike what hydrogenated fats do to your arteries. :o)
  I've used the dough to make pizza crusts (use less sugar), sweet rolls, dumplings, and popovers. Nothing ever survives the intial wave of gnoshing, hence the double recipe.
  My only other recommendation is to watch out for the thickness and size of your rolls. If they are cut too thick they can be a little doughy and/or overly browned on top. Thinner and smaller is better. A little brushed butter or egg wash never hurts either.
  I have plans to try a pretzel roll recipe with this dough in the future. If anyone else does so before me, please review about it.
  Try the other potato recipes if you want or save a few hours of experience and use this one.

This was a good roll recipe.  Don't be fooled by the name, these don't taste a thing like crescent rolls.  They do however, make a nice roll.  So if you want a good roll, this will do, but it doesn't have the taste or texture of a crescent.  They were very pretty.

Fab-U-lous!!!!
I am very critical of my bread attempts and this one was excellent to my own palette.  Okay, if you are using this as a crescent roll/dinner recipe: up the salt to at least 2 tsp.  I will use 2 1/4 tsp. next time.  Thanks so much!!!

These rolls were wonderful.  I used instant potato flakes, and they were perfect.  I know now to save left over baked potatoes specificaly for this use.  The dough was a nice dough to work with.  Made half one night and the other a few nights later to rave reviews from the whole peanut gallery. Thank you very much !!

I made these rolls today and they were wonderful.
I cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup and I put the dough in the fridge and took part of it out to fix rolls for dinner tonight and they were excellent.  I am saving the rest to fix tomorrow. 
These rolls have an excellent flavor and are quite easy to make, I just couldn't wait until to tomorrow to try them and am glad that I didn't.

Made these for Easter 2012 dinner.  Turned out fantastic.  I made the dough on Saturday and Sunday morning about 1 1/2 hour before dinner I rolled out, shaped and let rise before baking.  Really easy!

very tender fluffy rolls! Love seeing them bake up all toasty and golden in the oven! thanks for a great recipe! Like others, I halved the recipe, but I ended up using the whole packet of yeast. I still have another batch to bake! The only thing i would change for next time is add maybe half a tsp more salt to the dough, and use some nice yukon gold potatoes to add a rich color to the crescents.

These rolls turned out perfectly!! They were exactly what I was looking for- soft, fluffy, buttery, everyone loved them.
I cut the rolls into bigger wedges than the recipe called for, thinking that 16 wedges would make them too small. But Next time I will do exactly as the recipe says, my rolls were huge!! Even though they look small to start with, they will raise really nicely and be the perfect size.

I am giving this recipe 5 solid stars even though I won't make them again.  WHY?  well.......Colleen says they are "delicate" and indeed they ARE.  VERY SOFT and SQUISHY....almost to much for our taste but they are very good with a great flavor.  Hence....5 solid stars. If you are looking for a VERY soft roll recipe this is IT.....These were fun to make and good experience for me....thanks for sharing.

These rolls are so fluffy and just WONDERFUL! Like other reviewers, I did not let them raise for 8 hours. I treated this dough like any other dough letting rise 'til doubled, then shaping into crescents and raising again. In all it took about 3 hours until the entire batch of dough was cooked. Great Recipe!

These are absolutely amazing. I've read several variations on the recipe, but I don't change anything. I slather on a ton of butter after rolling out, and I slather on more before I bake them. Sorry you just can't have enough butter. The butter chills on the cold dough, but doesn't detract at all. Watch them when you bake them so you don't over cook them. I never have leftovers, even when I triple the recipe! Fantastic with (more) butter and jam/jelly when hot, and fantastic when chilled. They keep really well in Tupperware in the fridge for days.

Update: Now my inlaws come to my house and ask for these rolls specifically. Family favorite!

My family loves this recipe. I change it to 25 servings, mix the dough in a bread maker and refrigerator as per instructions. I use half the dough and save the rest for another day. What a time saver!

Awesome. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. I don't normally have much luck with yeast, but figured I'd give these a try and I'm glad I did. I didn't leave them in the fridge for quite 8 hours, but I left the second rise a bit longer than an hour. Soft, yummy, thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE: Made these again for our Thanksgiving Feast. They are no fail! My dad and my boyfriend thought I bought them from the store (which is a compliment, from them!). I did cut the recipe in half, and had to work in about 1/2 cup more flour while kneading. I brushed with melted butter on top as well, before putting in the oven. These are so awesome!

Wow, these are so satisfying!  Only change was to add a little sugar to water/yeast mixture to help foam along.  Baked up beautifully!

the dough was lovely and it was nice to have the flexibility of baking it "whenever."  HOW THINLY IS THIS ROLLED OUT BEFORE FORMING INTO CRESCENTS?? could someone please help with the crescent shaping!  a 12inch circle cut into 16 slices... mine ended up too skinny to roll into crescents. i ended up with really big rugalach looking things (and when they rose in the oven, WHOA they doubled in size and were shaped like giant pigs-in-blankets.  not bad, but nothing like a crescent!  i also needed a bit more flour than called for, and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.  i sprinkled vanilla brown sugar and desicated (not sweetened) coconut over the butter before rolling, and brushed tops with beaten egg and sprinkled with more coconut before baking.  very tasty.  just not crescent shaped!!

Very nice rolls, thank you!  Rose beautifully, baked wonderfully, tasted fantastic!

Since I was making a dinner roll, I too reduced the amount of sugar, next time I think I'll use the full amount, I have a feeling they'll taste even better!

Perhaps in the future I'll try mixing in some crushed garlic with the butter before brushing the butter on.. garlic rolls, yum!  Seriously, my kiddos and hubby loved these too and they were wolfed down in short time!

Do what other reviewers suggested and use your pizza cutter to cut the wedges, works great!

It was good, but a little bland, even though I added plenty of salt when boiling the potatoes, in addition to the salt in the recipe. Next time I'll add a teaspoon more salt, or so. I used butter in place of shortening, and also substituted in a half cup of wheat flour. The dough was so sticky that I had to add plenty of oil to the bowl when rising so it wouldn't stick, then that kept it from being too sticky when I shaped the rolls. I made round rolls for breakfast instead of crescent rolls. I think I'll keep this recipe, since it's good for using up potatoes, but I'll also keep my eye out for a better.

Yum, yum, yum!!! I took one look at the shortening mixture and couldn't imagine what to do next. I poured everything into the Kitchen Aid and it mixed up nicely. Then I used a dough hook on my KitchenAid to knead the dough, so preparation was super simple.  I did lower my oven temperature to 375 since the tops seemed to brown too fast.

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner.  They are wonderful....light and fluffy! Great flavor! I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I did have to exchange the shortening for butter and did not chill it.  Although chilling and letting dough develop gives it even a better flavor....next time when I have more time I will do that... I cannot even imagine it tasting better...this will go into my keeper recipes..

I made these rolls following the directions exactly and they were fantastic! I made the dough the night before, let it sit in the fridge overnight, and when I came down the next morning, it had actually risen. I wasn't sure if it was possible for dough to rise in the fridge, but this worked just fine! And the finished product tasted fantastic! My husband and I both got stomachaches from eating too many, but it was worth it!

Absolutely excellent!  I made dough in evening, next morning it had more than doubled.  (Use a very large bowl.)  I had to reduce my oven temperature to 375 since the bottoms of the first batch came out black.

These were amazing! My husband always asks for them on Sundays. I use instant potatoes and usually only raise them in the fridge for a few hrs until I am ready to make them. If I am on top of it, the night before. The only thing I add is a tbsp of dough enhancer for texture. Thank you, these are delicious!

These rolls were amazing, very delicious. I didn't form them into crescent shapes because it was so sticky to work with, I just roll them into balls and rise and bake it as directed.

I really liked this recipe - so versatile!  I made crescent rolls & Clone of a Cinnabon (also from this site).  Both are fantastic!  Made 2 pans of crescent rolls - the first I made at 400 and they baked too quickly and got a little dark - the 2nd pan I reduced to 375 and they were much better.  I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

You know... I make a lot of breads and rolls, but after my husband tasted these he said, "You can make these from now on." He loved them! I used instant mashed potatoes instead of boiling my own (only because I was all out of fresh) and they still tasted wonderful. I also loved how they rose in the fridge. These are so light and fluffy. Thanks for sharing!!!

I've started using this recipe whenever I need bread dough for anything except bread. I tried it first for crescent rolls and received much praise at Thanksgiving. I've since used this recipe with much success in cinnamon rolls and pizza dough as well. It is slightly sweet and extremely smooth.

Definitely a 5 star recipe.  We needed a recipe to replace store bought roll dough for our favorite apple dumpling recipe, which we just finished using with this recipe.  Wouldn’t change a thing in the recipe other than using instant potatoes. We made enough potatoes from instant potatoes to equal the potatoes in the recipe.  We will not be buying crescent roll dough from the store again.  Made a few rolls from the left over dough and they were delicious.

These are, quite simply, the BEST!  It has become my standard recipe and brings raves wherever I bring them.  The only downfall is that I have had to start making twice as many, as my husband will sneak most of them before they make it to the guests.

I got a lot of praise with these rolls over Thanksgiving.  They were real handy to have ready and tasted great.  When kneeding it, the dough felt really "rubbery", but it turned out great, so I guess that was fine.  This will probably be making regular appearances at our family get togethers.

OUTSTANDING! These rolls were WONDERFUL. I was a bit worried when the mashed potatos still showed a few lumps, but they disappeared in the rolls. These are some of the best rolls i've ever had. DEFINITELY a keeper. Easy to make, but time consuming. Well worth the wait. Went great with Thanksgiving dinner, even my kids ate them instead of throwing them like storebought rolls.

I've been looking for a good versatile roll recipe and have been disappointed UNTIL NOW!! These are fantastic. I made the dough the day before baking...followed directions just as written (except cut into 12 rolls instead of 16 on my 12 inch circle) and they were wonderful. Soft with a great taste and texture.  This recipe made two dozen rolls and they're gone this morning. The kids warmed them up this morning with a little butter and raspberry jam! Yum. I will be making another batch tomorrow. You can't go wrong with these!

This is incredible.  I make a batch of 16 at a time.  In a family of 3 which the baker (me) just eats one or two to taste, the rest is usually gone within 48 hours, considering that we usually only take bread for breakfast and not at other times.  

I don't know if it is my oven, but I have to bake it for 25 minutes instead of the prescribed 15 to 20.  Otherwise, the rolls would come out barely done. I tried garlic butter, peanut butter, cinnamon and coconut.  Except for peanut butter, all are very nice combinations.

This recipe makes a very nice dough, it rises nicely and bakes into tasty tender rolls. I like the convenience of leaving it in the fridge until I'm ready to bake it. I divided my dough in half and put it in two bowls before I put it in the fridge so I could bake half and save the other half undisturbed until I'm ready to use it.

I have never made any kind of dinner rolls; this was my first attempt. I thought I was going to ruin the whole thing, being very unsure of myself. These rolls turned out soooo good!!! The dough was very easy to work with. I had my 13 yr old daughter help roll them. My husband kept saying over and over how much he liked them!! Everyone at the table gave them a complement. Coming from a family that almost never eats dinner rolls, this was very high complements!!  Thanks Colleen! You've made my new kitchen Aid mixer a smashing success!!!

Very good roll recipe!  Made for Thanksgiving, halved recipe (since i was cooking for 3) I cut the sugar to 1/4 c instead of 1/3 c.  They were a big hit! My daughter who is not a huge fan of breads ate some of them.

These were really good.  Light and fluffy, but I would not say they have the same flakiness as the ones you buy in the store. Still, they made amazing, very tender rolls.  I used part of the dough to make cinnamon rolls which turned out fabulous as well.  I would make these again.

Absolutely the softest roll I've found!  Yummy flavor - this roll has it all.  In keeping with our "healthier" cooking, used 3 cups whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup almond meal/flour, and white bread flour for the remaining flour.  Used butter flavored crisco (healthy?-no), which I mixed with the warm potato to soften/melt.  Rose in warmed oven several hours, which was plenty, then punched down and used half for a meal.  The other half went into the fridge for later.  Don't forget to brush with butter before cooking, as it is just the buttery goodness these need!

I'm honestly not sure how to rate this, so I'll do so in the middle. I had high hopes, because of all the reviews, but despite how beautiful they looked, they did not taste nearly as good. I cut the recipe in half and followed most of it. I reduced the sugar and used butter instead of shortening (seem not to have any). But all I'm left with is a very weird after taste, like milk. I'm not sure if the reduction in sugar would really make it taste so off, or what it was! Perhaps as a breakfast food, with jam and honey it will taste better.

such a soft bread! it's absolutely delicious.
i would divide the circle into 8 sections instead of 16, so the crescent form is more evident. can cut down on sugar if doing a more savouring bread (i used garlic butter). delicious and super easy to make.

This recipe is so good with a classic homemade bread taste! It was so yummy and super easy to make. It worked really well for my case where my parents came down for the weekend. I prepared the dough the night before and baked it the morning of their arrival and were completely ready for lunch. I made mine into sandwich rolls, so my first batch didn't turn out exactly perfect...definitely eatable, but not perfect. I would suggest lowering the temperature and increasing cook time if you would like to make larger rolls. Still WONDERFUL recipe!

Wonderful rolls for every occasion. I gave these 5 stars due to the flexibility that the dough allows. I let it rise in the fridge for 2 days at which time I rolled out and baked half of the batch. I then put the remainder of the dough back in the fridge and let it rise for an additional 2 days. The second batch came out beautifully as well. Unlike most bread dough, I could make the rolls on my schedule. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made lots of bread but I am not very good at it.  These crescents were the easiest to NOT screw up that I have ever come across so a HUGE kudos and thanks for that.  These were definitely five stars on the morning that I made them but they did not have the same deliciousness the next day.  Next time I will add more salt.  Even with the honey butter that I drizzled on top, I thought they could use a little extra salt to balance them out.  I had my entire family over for breakfast and they gave these rolls compliment after compliment.

I made these at Thanksgiving and neglected to see where you're supposed to cover them for 1 hour after rolling them into crescent shape. Other than that I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. They came out absolutely delicious anyway, and were gobbled up and complimented by all!

I like this recipe... it had great flavor and was simple to make. The only issue I had is that my family and I thought it was a lil on the soft doughy side. I had to flip them over and bake them for a few more mins to firm up and get toasty. Other than that it was good. :)

Recipe base is very good.  I say this because I changed a few things and still got good rolls.  Instead of potatoes, I used left over 'Cheesy Polenta' which is a recipe from this site.  I used all wheat flour and used butter instead of shortening.  We loved eating them with raw honey and butter.  No one could taste cheesy polenta.  A long time ago I made this recipe with potatoes and they were just as good.

I Loved the texture and softness of the rolls.I did some changes though.I used 1/2 cup oats and 3 cups whole wheat flour and then continued with the all purpose flour as needed.I also reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and used 1/3 cup olive oil and 1/3 cup butter flavoured shortening. I had instant potato flakes so used 1 cup of it instead.All in all it was really good and my kids loved it.I still have half of the dough left and I'm planning to make cinnamon rolls out of it.I'm sure it will turn out great.Thanx a ton for the great recipe.

I looked this recipe up in my trusty recipes that I have gotten from my grandma over thirty years ago.  Identical, these are yummy! In my recipe it calls for 1 cup mashed potatoes, otherwise the same.

I love this recipe. They're always a big hit around the holidays and people rave about them. Never any leftovers. Tip: I cheat and use plain powdered mashed potatoes fixed with water in the microwave. Cuts prep time in half.

These had a good flavor, but were a bit too dense and heavy for our tastes. I did not let them rise long enough the second time, however, so it may be my own problem. =)

These rolls are very good, and the dough is very easy to handle.  It was easy to use this recipe because of being able to refrigerate them for so long before baking them.  I wish I would have mixed up the potatoes more because there were little visible chunks of potato in the dough when rolling it out.  This won't replace my family's all-time favorite rolls but they certainly deserve to be made again!

AMAZING!!!! Didn't change a single thing about the recipe, and they were easy to make and came out wonderfully! Baked for 12 minutes and they were wonderfully fluffy and delicious. One warning- this recipe yields A LOT of dinner rolls- might want to try freezing half the dough for later. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I used instant mashed potatoes and they worked out wonderful!!! My family devoured them!! They come out a little bit sweet so just keep that in mind if you're looking for a dinner roll. They'll still be delicious!!! Brush them with a little butter before baking and it'll give them a nice brown color.

Perhaps I shouldn't have been expecting these to taste like the crescents from the market. They were too sweet for my taste. Maybe no sugar or very little would suit my tastes.

This is my new favorite bread recipe!  The rolls were easy to make and tasted great.  I did take a reviewers tip to lower the baking temperature by 25 degrees in order to avoid burning the bottom of the rolls.

Other than taking a long time to let rise, this recipe was easy and tasty. Defiantly not a quick bread, but my family loved them! The ones I made with cinnamon and sugar, my daughter suggested putting the melted butter and filling on the inside before rolling up, like a cinnamon roll, so that it is through out the crescent. You know, it's going to be good when you can't keep the kids out of the dough while it's rising. The recipe makes a lot so it's great for a large gathering. I loved the ideal in one of the reviews to use a pizza cutter to cut the wedges, it worked wonderfully. I used leftover mashed, red potatoes with the skins on. They worked out great and it gave them a little something else to chew on. We would defiantly make them again but maybe save it for special occasions due to the lengthy process.

FABULOUS! I bake a lot of bread, and I am AMAZED at what a difference using mashed potatoes does to the rolls! Everyone voted this as a replacement recipe.  I too left the bread to rise on the counter and ended up spliting it into three parts, 12 rolls each and the shape was perfect.  After I rolled the dough but before cutting, I spread softened butter on the dough, then cut and rolled.  I brushed the tops with egg white (slightly whisked with a tsp of water) right before baking.  Looked and tasted great!!

A great hit at our Thanksgiving!  I used instant potatos as was suggested by some here.  They turned out wonderfully light and yummy.  I'm going to make some more and use half the dough for cinnamon rolls.  Thanks Colleen!

Wow! Not much else to say. This was only the second or third time I made homemade bread and these turned out perfectly. I made about half of the dough into crescents and for the other half, I formed small balls and put them in a muffin pan - 3 per muffin. They were maybe the best rolls I've ever had - including restaurant rolls. My 4 year old said his favorite part of dinner was the "muffin rolls".

These were wonderful! I too cooked them the same day. I let the dough rise for an hour in the oven with the light on. Shaped them into crescents. Let them rise again for an hour. Voila! Wonderful rolls. Next time, I would decrease the sugar a bit, if I wanted something a little less dessert like. An awesome recipe )and I'm often not the best with breads!).

I usually only take time to rate a recipe if I was impressed with the results, and these rolls were very impressive. I made them for Christmas dinner and everyone LOVED these little gems. They were light and fluffy and fantastic with real butter. It was also extremely time saving making these overnight. I made the dough Christmas Eve and the next  morning had perfectly risen dough ready to go. Perfect! Thanks SO much, these will be our new dinner roll.

These are wonderful.  They are tender, and old fashioned tasting.  I follow the recipe exactly and the results are consistently good.  My college age sons cannot get enough of them and have impressed their friends by making this very easy recipe.  The making of this roll dough the day before Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, etc. has become part of our family traditions!

I really like this recipe.  They looked beautiful and taste great.  I followed the reciped exactly and the only complaint is that it took more flour than called for.  I kept adding flour by the 1/2 cup and I probably had to add at least another full cup than called for.  I agree with another reviewer that the flavor is lacking a bit.  So, I think next time I'll use butter instead of shortening or use half of each.   I made cinnamon rolls with the other half of dough.  They turned out awesome!  My husband said they were the best cinnamon rolls I've made.

These are just as good as the reviews say!  A nice tasting roll with many possibilities as to shape, and use.  I especially liked making it the night before - it was so easy to make the rolls and we had already done most of the cleanup.  I used instant potatoes as sugguested and they turned out fine.  My kids loved rolling up the rolls, and brushing on the butter.

Absolutely *amazing* recipe! Incredibly easy to pull together, and turned out perfectly, even though I didn't have the required 8 hours and could only refrigerate them for 5.  The texture and lightness was perfect and the flavour was fantastic. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! I made it once already, and am going to make another batch for tomorrow!

Changes: use instant mashed potatoes, no need to refrigerate the dough before baking, just make it and let it rise, roll it out and shape the rolls, let it rise again, and bake. I also bake at 375-380 for 22 minutes instead of 400. With 400 the tops of the rolls start to burn.

Made this for the family Christmas dinner and they were GREAT!  People even asked for the recipe.  They were easy to make and I made the dough 4 day ahead and rolled the cresents the day before.  I set them out for 2 hour before baking to get to room temp and to rise more.  I will be making them again and again.

Had halved the recipe . proofed yeast by mixing in 1ts sugar . mixed everything in standmixer.Also did them savoury. Added only 3tb sugar.&instead of dividing the dough into 16wedges , divided in 8.perfect size.Also took advice of reviews &kept them covered whole time loosely with foil&uncovered them for last2min.perfect browning.im glad I did else they would have got burnt or overbrowned.For extra flavour i added some minced garlic in butter &some chilli flakes along with some garlic bread seasoning.this added so much to these.thanks.

Very good recipe! if anyone is having a problem getting their yeast to activate first make sure the yeast is not too old second always store opened container of yeast in the fridge third add 1/4 cup
 hot water (110'-120') add in one packet or 2 1/4 tsp. yeast and 1 tbs. sugar that should work for anyone if it works for me trust me!

Delicious! 4 stars only because I made alterations, the result of which were 5 star rolls. I made this with half shortening/half butter and cut the sugar in half. I also did not refrigerate it... just let the dough rise covered on the counter, then let the crescents rise again in the oven at the lowest temp setting. Brushed them with butter before baking, into the oven for 25 minutes and they were just perfect. My hubby loves them. I froze half of my rolls before they rose the second time so we can enjoy some more in a couple of weeks! I think cutting the sugar in half is a good choice if you are making a dinner roll as I can still taste a bit of sweetness. However, this would be fantastic as cinnamon buns or another sweet bread with the full amount of sugar in the dough.

I found these to be rather bland and dense.  I have to be honest, I forgot to add the shortening, but I'm not sure that would have solved the bland taste.  The dough rose wonderfully in the fridge, but I was in a hurry so I didn't do the full hour rise before baking (they did nearly triple in size in the oven).  This could explain why I found them dense.  Normally I would try the recipe again, but I found this one a bit too tedious, time consuming and messy too bother.

These are the best dinner rolls I have ever tasted. My family loves them and asks for them frequently. I have made them with and without the refridgerated rise and while they are very good without the slow, cold rise they are even better if the dough is refridgerated. Made this way they are even more delicate, tender and delicious. The only change I've made is after the first batch, I cut the sugar in half. Amazingly good!

super light and delicate texture! This is what I've been looking for!!! I definitely used real butter since it tastes better and isn't as bad for you as shortening. I am not the best cresent maker, but found they turned out a little better if the triangles are wider and shorter, so they don't look like pigs in a blanket. SO Good! oh I did double the recipe for thanksgiving dinner there was a lot. and I did use the Bosch mixer to do it all including the kneading, I only kneaded it for 5 minutes since its more thorough. that made it easy.

This is a GREAT recipe.  YUM YUM! It was very easy to follow.  I made a double batch for our family dinner for Thanksgiving.  I did find that baking mine at 400 for 15 minutes left them a little too dark for my liking.  My next batch I did at 375 and it was better.  I might not cut 16 with my 12 inch circle. They seem really small. Maybe cut 12 instead. These are light and fluffy.  I don't work with yeast much because I'm always worried I'll kill the yeast.  I did add a sprinkle of sugar to the water when I proofed the yeast.

Thank you so much for this great recipe.  I also used the bread machine to knead the dough.  This was very easy and they turned out great.  I only used half of the dough because it makes so much.  Today I will try to use the rest of the dough to make cinnamon rolls.  Has anyone tried using the dough at two different times?  It didn't rise again in the fridge but maybe that's O.K.  Thanks again for this delicious recipe.

So good & EASY! I found that they were good crescent rolls, but even better cinnamon rolls! It made 2  - 9 x 13 pans.  I baked them up then froze individually for a easy weekday breakfast. Take it out of the freezer and they defrost by the time I get to work, or if I am impatient, zap for 15 sec. YUMMY! I now find an excuse to make mashed potatoes so that I can make this bread!

Have tried several bread roll recipes from this site. Love this one. Very easy. Turned out great.
I tried this several ways, shaped into round rolls and also in muffing tin. Crescent shape is my preference for this. Will definately make again and again. Thank You

This is delicious.  The first time I made this, I used 2 parts whole wheat flour and 1 part all purpose flour to make it a little healthier.  It was good, but after following the directions and using all purpose for all the flour...there was a big difference.  After the cold rise it was double the size.  I suppose that whole wheat doesn't work the same?  I learned my lesson.  These are so light and fluffy and soft!  Yum!  Came out beautiful.  Next time I want to try and roll it with some dark chocolate and also try some others with cinnamon, raisins and pecans.

I have never made crescent rolls before and looked at this recipe and thought I would rather go to the bakery than spend 8 hrs making these.  They were great!  I made only half a batch to just try them first.  I didn't have shortening, so I used butter instead thinking it would be okay.  Well with it resting in the fridge, the butter got hard.  I rolled it out anyway and it worked out nicely.  I am wondering if these would freeze at all either in the rolled dough form, or made completely so I could double the batch, freeze and pull out several to cook at a time.

I had to use canned potatoes since I had no other. pretty good rolls. Next time to save time , I will do bread machine as another states how in the reviews. I saw that too late. for taste I would give these a 5, but since they were kind of a hassle to me , I gave them a 4.

Made dough like the recipe said early kept very well in the fridge. Took out to go along with Easter dinner, didn't have time to make crescent rolls so I rolled out the dough and used a small round glass dipped in flour to cut out and made dinner rolls.  The family loved them with honey butter or alone.  Great recipe.

My family loved these.  The only thing I did differently was to omit the sugar (we don't like sweet rolls).  For some reason, I totally missed the part in the directions that said to refrigerate the dough, so I unintentionally skipped that part.  Results were still great though!

I admit I screwed these up (I used the1/4 cup of butter in the batter instead of the 2/3 cups of shortening), but they were still great. I'm sure they'll be just as good when I make the correctly. :P

This is a great recipe! My husband even said it was"a keeper". I was short on time so I forgo the rest time in the fridge and let them raise for 2 hours. They came out perfectly golden brown and fluffy. Thanks for the recipe.

These are incredible and easy to make.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and they still had a sweet taste.  Perfect for Thanksgiving dinner!

Soft, moist, delicious and EASY rolls! I couldn't be happier with this recipe. Everyone enjoyed them. My only tips are that they are best warm and brush of melted butter before baking gives them a nice golden appearance. Otherwise, you'll be tempted to overcook them! All in all, absolutely wonderful. Thanks so much!

Oops..forgot to add something...  I allowed the dough to rise about 2 1/2 hours.  I started the oven temp at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes and then raised the temp to 375 for browning and they came out picture perfect.  When I did a test baking at 400 the bottoms got to brown.  And, yes this recipe makes a lot of dough so you might want to freeze half.

Haven't even cooked this entirely yet; and I didn't allow it to sit for the 8 hours as mentioned; only did 2 hours in the freezer; but the dough is beautiful to work with; really easy; not sticky in the least; really seems foolproof so long as your yeast is working properly.  And I rolled it out to about a 16-18 inch circle; just size wise to roll the crescents; seemed better; still cut out the 16 wedges as directed (just means for the 16-18 inch you get a few more rolls/rotations in each roll than you for the the 12); and the rose absolutely stunningly; are huge; and they've only just popper in the oven!!  Done half with jsut the butter and half with garlic butter; and they smell and look devine!!

I also used instant mashed potatoes and covered the rolls with foil until the last 5 minutes of baking.  These were excellent and easy.  I also had to add 3/4 cup more flour because my dough was too wet.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

So easy and the rolls are moist and delicious.  I especially like how you can save the dough in the fridge and use for several days in a row.  With only two of us at home, its an easy, fresh way to add delicious rolls to dinner.

This recipe creates a sweet, very lush bread.  I made it exactly as directed the first time.  The second time I quartered the dough and rolled each quarter out very thin.  It made an even better crescent.  In addition to it being thinner I wound up with more crescents...which is a very good thing.  This is definately a keeper recipe.  I will probably keep this dough made and in my fridge on a regular basis.

These rolls are to die for.  I have never been able to make bread well (even other recipes from this site) but these turned out like little pieces of heaven.  I used instant potatoes and also didn't leave them overnight, just let them rise for a few hours before continuing with the recipe.  I lowered the oven temp. and found that they actually finished at only 375 in just 12 or so minutes (maybe because I used dark-coated pans).  I usually shy away from breads because they take so much work, but I'm already looking forward to making these again this weekend!

This is a family favorite. I often make a double batch at the beginning of the week and use it through out the week. Great for many uses... rolls, cinnamon rolls, pizza dough, chicken and dumplings, etc.

I made these for a play date with some other moms and their kids.  I made them without the eggs as one child is allergic and used butter flavoured shortening.  I only made 1/2 a recipe and rolled 1/2 of the dough around hot dogs for pigs in a blanket and 1/2 just as regular crescents.  They were really good, I would definately make these again.

This recipe is extremely easy to follow and the rolls came out nicely.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I am only giving it 4 stars because they were not as sweet as we like them and because they were extremely heavy/dense.  Otherwise, very tasty and I will definitely make them again using a few modifications.

These rolls are fantastick, I'm going to say 5 star. I brought them to a family dinner and asked everyone to rate them. I added a bunch of spices to soft butter and spread it onto each round before cutting and rolling them up, I thought the spices were great, but my very picky  in-laws don't like seasoned food very well. They say 4 star, but I'm going to say 5 because I know if I wouldn't have spiced them they would've said 5 star.

FANTASTIC!!! not stars enough to rate this recipe: the crescent were huge, soft, and tasted great, and I see great possibilities of different combinations arise. I used all butter and didn't change anything else. I had 7 adults and 5 kids for brunch and everyone devouring as mad: this bread made me look like some oldfashioned housewife, my friends were amazed and told my husband he is fortunate indeed:-)

I loved this recipe! I didn't shape it into crescents though. I skipped the fridge all together and let them rise in a muffin pan. I also added a little garlic and onion powder to it. I think next time I will doctor up the mashed potatoes with the garlic and onion powder and maybe even add some cheese to it. My boyfriend LOVES these and says this should be our rolls from now on!

Amazing dough!  I "tried" it out before turkey day, and here is what I did differently the 2nd time.  I let the dough rise on the counter for a few hours and then stuck it in the fridge overnight.  This made the dough softer and more risen the next day.  Also, instead of rolling these into cresents, I cut dough into thirds, and then each third into 8ths.  They taste like Logan's rolls (restaurant) but have substance.  SERIOUSLY AMAZING!  I have been tasked to make the bread now for all future holidays!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!!

Wow.  Every step of this process was so fun.  The dough came together easily, and overall the recipe is a keeper: simple, unique, and delicious.  That's a combination I don't often find!  I'm so excited to have a good make-ahead bread recipe for the holidays. 

I did make a couple of substitutions, but the technique as listen in the recipe is fool-proof so I didn't change that!  I used honey instead of sugar, and butter rather than shortening, and I subbed 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat.

I was drawn by the fact you can prepare this the night before. Halfway through the kneading process, I spontaneously snapped a branch of fresh rosemary out of the garden and added about 1.5-2  chopped tablespoons.  It added a subtle kick and a little color. I also just formed into balls which I set in muffin tins, on the suggestion of a prior post. This reduced the work that much more! Only baked for about 11 minutes.

Excellent.  I too did not put it in the fridge as other reviewers suggested and let the dough rise in a warm spot before forming the dough into crescents, I was shocked at how quick and easy this recipe is to use.  The rolls rose beautifully and tasted good.  I decreased the sugar to 1/3 as others had recommended.  Great recipe.

Very tasty and versatile recipe! Very easy for a newbie to pull off too. I didn't let the dough rest as long as was suggested (8 hours or more), but it came out great all the same. Just be aware that the recipe makes a LOT of these rolls, so make sure you have plenty of friends or family over to help eat them.

Extremely Versatile! These turned out exactly as I imagined they would...only better! I agree with other reviewers that you have to watch them a bit, but as ovens vary it's always good to keep an eye on a new addition to the family recipe box. I use these instead of refrigerated dough as it is unavailable where I live. This will come out perfectly whether you are using it for Pigs 'n a Blanket or for Cinnamon Rolls. This, like any good pie crust recipe, is a wonderful canvas for the create cook's imagination. It isn't as much work as it seems, and is well worth the effort.

everyone ate up these rolls so fast.  they were so easy to make.  i even made some without eggs and used water instead of milk, and didn't cover them in buttar,since my daughter is has allergies, and they still turned out wonderful.  I bake all the time and these are the best Potato rolls that I've tried yet.

I made these rolls for Easter and they were fabulous! The only change I will make for next time is to sub. half of the shortening with butter for a little more flavor.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. Everyone seemed to really like them, especially the kids. I am not really a bread eater so they weren't all that special to me, but I'll rate these based upong what everyone else said. The rolls were huge, fluffy and very light.

Oh my gosh!  These were EXACTLY what I was looking for.  They were light and fluffy on the inside and the taste was divine!  I made them for my family for our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone gobbled them up.  What little leftovers we had, the kids ate as snacks the next day!  Thank you, Thank you!  I will never buy packaged again :o)

great texture, but unless you add an extra flavor of cinnamon, garlic, or something, they are a bit bland.

These came out very delicious. I used melted butter instead of shortening and had to add a cup or so more flour for my dough to come together but they came out great. Wonderful texture and flavor.

This is my absolute favorite bread dough recipe, hands down! Definitely five stars as written. I've made rolls with it as directed (use mashed yams in lieu of potato for a fun Thanksgiving twist), but more often I use it as the dough recipe for my cinnamon rolls - the texture and flavor is just delicious! When using it for cinnamon rolls, I replace the water with milk.
Just a few notes from my own experiences:
One large russet potato is enough to make 1 cup mashed; add a pinch of sugar to the yeast and water/milk when proofing; and make sure you have at least 8 cups of flour on hand (I've always ended up using more than 6.5 cups; it's a pretty sticky dough). Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe, Colleen!

I've been making this recipe for years. It got lost for a couple of years, but I found it and I just finished a batch. This is by far the best potato bread recipe I know. So easy to make. Very convenient when you're planning a large meal - make ahead and use the dough within several days. We've never lasted several days, by the way! I make no changes other than using the mixer/dough hook to do the kneading. Always terrific.

I was wanting to do something special for Thanksgiving. I wanted this to work so badly. 
I checked the date on the yeast, turned the heat up in the house and put the kettle on for steam but after waiting 3 hours, they didn't rise either time. I went through the motions and baked them anyway. I guess I'm just inexperienced with yeast breads because although the flavor was good, my husband said he'd put them in his saddle bag and use them on the trail. (. . .If he had a horse)
 The only thing I did different than the original recipe was use butter for my shortening since Im vegetarian but had read from other comments that it was OK to do that. Who knows what I did wrong

Awesome dinner rolls. My only issue was I doubled the recipe and ended up with massive bowl of dough in the fridge by morning. I had enough to make 16 huge dinner rolls for Thanksgiving dinner AND 4 loaves of the best most deliciously sinful bread ever. Will make again (in single batches only) for every holiday meal.

Wow. I was skeptical, but tried this because I wanted to bring rolls to a friend's for Easter dinner. I made the dough and had it in the fridge around 11AM Saturday. I pulled it on Sunday morning, about an hour before I formed the rolls, which then had almost three hours to rise while I was at mass. I was amazed at how much they increased in size after rising, which was about 3X in volume. I only made a half batch, but messed up and made one half of my dough into 16 rolls, then made the other half into 12 rolls. They came out HUGE compared to the starting point. I made things easier by brushing melted butter over the whole disc of dough before cutting them into triangles and forming the crescents, then brushed them again before baking. I covered the pans with foil to prevent over-browning, removing it for the last two minutes. I got 28 rolls out of a half batch. I can only imagine if I'd portioned them according to the recipe that they'd have been large enough for a sandwich. The rolls had a wonderfully soft, flaky texture. I'm DEFINITELY going to use this recipe often. Thanks so much!

I'm not sure where I went wrong with these, but they turned out very dense and chewy. They were also quite bland - I ended up covering one batch with rosemary garlic butter and another batch with cinnamon-clove-sugar butter.

These were really tasty. I doubled the recipe and used instant mashed potatoes, which worked great. I was cooking for a big party, so I had to maximize oven space and cook some on the top rack and some on the bottom. The ones on the top were too doughy on the bottom and the ones on the bottom were burned on the bottom. The perfect solution was just alternating racks halfway through. Other than these things I followed the recipe exactly and will definitely make them again!

Very tasty and fairly easy to make for someone that is not a bread baker.  They were a hit for Christmas dinner.

I thought these were delicious, but I'm only giving them 4 stars because my fiance's family thought they were much too sweet for dinner rolls.

These were great.  I served them 4 ways:  the cinnamon/pecan rolls that another reviewer suggested with a maple glaze, with herbes de provence rolled in, with bacon cheddar cheese rolled in and plain.  All 4 were fantastic.  Only disappointment is that they were not flaky, but coming from a bread machine, this was fantastic.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. Absolutely magnificent. It takes some time, but they are so worth it. It makes a lot so I cut entire dough in half and made one for dinner. Then I cut the other half in half again and froze those two chunks. This is a must try! Did that all make sense!?

These are easy to make and absolutely wonderful. This will be my go-to roll recipe from now on. My brother said they are better than my grandma's rolls and that is extremely high praise.

I found it easier to divide the dough into 4 rounds, roll out a 12 inch round, and then cut into 8 pieces.

I really like being able to make the dough so far ahead of time. It made cooking Christmas dinner so much easier.

I made these rolls for Christmas dinner and I can say is "WOW"! They are so light and fluffy and delicious! I don't know how it happened, but I ended up with 32 rolls good sized rolls, instead of 16, but boy I am glad I had so many; I've never seen people eat so much bread! It was the hit of our Christmas meal.  I will make these again and again. I think this will be my "go to" recipe from now on.

I think for the amount of work involved, that these are just okay. I'll stick to my favorite roll recipe on here (Buttery Rolls.)
