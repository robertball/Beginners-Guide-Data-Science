I use a little more flavorful breading, 1cup of panko, 1cup of seasoned bread crumbs, and a cup of parmesan cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley, a teaspoon of fresh chopped Thyme and a teaspoon of garlic powder. I brown the chicken in half butter and half olive oil. I also cook some angel hair while the chicken is browning, and put it under the chicken in a casserole dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes, remove foil, add cheese and bake another 10 minutes

3 stars because this was good with my common sense modifications. I do not know how any one of you got a good result as written. #1 - 4 c. of breadcrumbs?! Whoa! Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to 'eye this up' and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded, not 'fresh' for best melting result. #6- Don't put fresh basil on so early. It will burn - leave it for the last 5 min or use dried. Now, with these changes, the dish was delicious - but I guess it is now my own version of chicken parmesan.

Have to admit if it's not easy and/or tasty I won't put the effort in. The WHOLE famiily loved this, and every recipe gets easier each time its' made, right?
I only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn't use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in, and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this, and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great!
Given that I had twice as many fillets, next time, I would probably use half the oil, so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.)
As much as I loved this recipe, given the calories/fat, I would not make it as often as I'd like.
10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner, the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it's not as crispy, I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk, then cut, trim, and pound with mallet before freezing for later use, this saves lots of time during actual recipe.

Some time ago, I learned a useful trick: instead of steps 3-6 above, after the chicken breasts have been pounded and seasoned as in step 2, lightly brush both sides with heavy 33-35%MF whipping cream (use a pastry brush). Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4, pressing the crumbs into both sides.

I now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading, including fish, pork, veal, etc.  It is easier and less messy than using flour, eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well.

All I can say is Wow! I have made chicken parmesan using the most popular recipe from this site, but this recipe blew the other out of the park! This is a no brainer. My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews, does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part, however, made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won't hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat!

Incredible dish! Great for dinner guests.  For those folks cooking in high altitude, 15 or 20 minutes is not quite enough to cook the chicken breasts.  You might want to cook them a little longer (6-7 minutes) on top of the stove or microwave them for several minutes (3 minutes)before serving.  Cut them in half to check doneness before serving. If you put them back in the oven for too long, the cheese might burn.

I made this exactly as directed and it was GREAT! So easy and fast - fabulous use of bnls/sknls chicken breast. It came out moist & tender with the crunchy top - perfect. Served it on angel hair pasta with buttered italian bread and it was a hit. Thank you John - your wife is lucky to have you! I love your videos & sense of humor, and your food is excellent! (swoon...get me the fainting couch!)

This Chicken Parmesan was so good that I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day. I'm writing this review and giving my rating provided that I followed the directions of the recipe exactly as stated. I don't like reviews where people make a bunch of changes then rate "their" version. No thanks. This recipe is absolutely fantastic. There is not much more I can say. I have four kids ages 2-8 and they all loved it. I would stress the importance of pounding the chicken between the two plastic bags. It sounded strange to me but it makes a difference. Give yourself lots of time to make this meal. Its time consuming but worth it. I served it over angel hair, with sides of steamed broccoli and garlic bread. Yum!

Absolutely perfect!  I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and my very picky fiancee loved it! The crispy chicken was great!

Wow! The best part is that it doesn't have any ingredients only found in one store in a hidden back ally in an unknown town 40 miles outside of Paris.

This was great.  My teenage grandson keeps asking me to make it again and again and he is so fussy about food I can't believe it.  My other grandson made it first and served my daughter and I and then told me where to find the recipe.  I have made it three times already.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding garlic powder and seasonall to the chicken before flouring it and adding garlic powder to the panko.  Deliciious!!!

I made this tonight gluten free and it turned out amazing.  Even my husband that is not a fan of gluten free food thought this was delicious.  To make panko crumbs I used rice chex cereal and crushed to the consistency of bread crumbs.  I also used gluten free flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Thanks for a wonderful easy recipe that I will make many times in the future.

I made this exactly like the recipe called for, except that I used a spaghetti sauce. The chicken had no flavor, at all, and lost what seemed like a nice crust after being soaked is sauce. If I would make this again, I would cook the chicken in the pan, instead of transferring the chicken over into the oven. Then heat sauce separately and top at the end.

Nice recipe! Was very much enjoyed at my house. 
I took some advice from other reviewers though, and spiced up the breading process a bit.  
Simply add a half teaspoon of salt, paprika, and pepper to the flour mix, and a dash or two of worchestershire to the beaten eggs.
Easy peasy!

I made this for dinner tonight for a bunch of teenagers. They LOVED it! i didn't have enough panko so I topped the panko off with bread crumbs. I had to use an extra egg. I added about 1 T garlic power and 1 T onion powder  the bread crumbs. The chicken was juicy and tender. The breading was very tasty. And most importantly, like I said...the picky teenagers LOVED it! It's definitely a keeper!

Came out perfect....  I marinated the chicken cutlets with a freshly chopped basil, oregano, parsley, virgin olive oil (very little) paste and followed directions from there.  Chicken was moist and tender. Spaghetti,salad and garlic bread. Great for Italian night!!

Flavorwise this was good, but next time I make it I will totally ommit the tomato sauce, and just add it when plating. That way the chicken will stay crispy but still get all the flavors.

This recipe is fantastic! Although there are a few steps to take in terms of breading and then sautéing the chicken breasts, it was not difficult.  I had about one more chicken breast than called for but I still used about 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs.  I did not have Panko so just used store brand and they worked perfectly.  Next time I will use the panko bread crumbs just to gauge the difference.  I used about 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs and just slightly more parmesan than the 1/2 cups (but not much more - I just had a bit extra from grating it).  I had read (may have been from another chicken parmesan recipe or here -- I can't remember right now) a tip about flouring the pounded fillets then refrigerating for about 1/2 hour before coating in egg (I used two) and then bread crumbs, so I did that. I did not leave the breadcrumbed chicken for the 15 minutes called for -- I somehow skipped over that instruction -- but the chicken browned beautifully anyway so I will leave that out in future too.  I put approximately 1/3 cup spaghetti sauce on each piece of chicken, then fresh mozzarella, and then a generous sprinkling of parmesan (freshly grated).  I did not put provolone but the end results were just fantastic.  After dinner I realized I'd forgotten the fresh basil too -- but although I'll add it next time, we sure didn't miss it this time.  I was so proud of how well the dish turned out and how delicious it was -- thank you, Chef John, for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe stands on its own, just the way it is.  That said, I recommend using only 2 cups of panko.  Why use $2 worth of crumbs when $1 worth will do?  I breaded the chicken twice, following the instructions -- and 2 cups of panko mixed in with 1/2 cup of Parmesan were plenty.  I deviated only slightly in a couple of other ways, which I'll share, just in case you're thinking of trying something similar.  First of all, being the penny-pinching cook that I am, I used only one egg and more than doubled the volume by adding it to a about 2 to 3 ounces of whole milk and beating/mixing them together with a fork.  The milk/egg mixture performed admirably in getting the breading to stick to the chicken.  Instead of frying the chicken in a pan of olive oil, I used my deep fryer, which always stands at the ready with peanut oil.  Using tongs, I gently lowered the chicken into the oil and cooked it at 375° F, one piece at a time for about 2 to 3 minutes each, until it turned a deep golden color.  By frying only one piece at a time, the chicken remained relatively flat and cooked nice and evenly.  (I will try olive oil someday just to see how the flavor changes, but the peanut oil worked well.)  I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dry basil and that was okay, but I think fresh would have been better.  Note: this recipe is all about the crispy breading. Covering chicken in foil while baking, as some do, will result in softer breading; if you like that, use cheaper (than panko) crumbs.

Wonderful taste and chicken was very moist.  I added some garlic powder to the chicken before coating with crumbs and as another reviewer recommended I use Panko and seasoned bread crumbs.  My husband loved this and said I could make this anytime....very high praise.

Unbelievably delicious!  This is a definite 10 star plus recipe. The basil, fresh mozzarella and provolone just puts it over the top. The chicken is perfectly crispy yet tender and juicy.  I will never make chicken parmesan any other way.  Thanks Chef John for another amazing recipe!

This was excellent!  I used my usual Italian bread crumbs, skipped the provolone (didn't have any on hand) and slightly increased the amount of mozzarella.  Although I made this for my husband, daughter, and myself, it's beautiful appearance and delicious taste makes it a top runner for future dinner guests.  Wish I could give it ten stars.

I definitely know why this recipe has a full 5 star review - it's the best chicken parmesan I've ever had, let alone ever made..!  I followed the recipe as called for but did add a few extras. I used chicken tenderloins so I didn't have to pound them out and blotted the extra oil from the chicken after cooking in the skillet. I also grilled up some chopped onions and mushrooms which I sprinkled over the (homeade) spaghetti sauce layer and used fresh basil, parsley, rosemary & oregano for the seasoning. I served it over garlic spaghetti with garlic bread - Yum! Definitely will make again!

Always wanted to make Chicken Parmesan from scratch. This was my first attempt, I followed the recipe as written and it turned out to be absolutely delicious! I used my favorite spaghetti sauce as my prepared tomato sauce, and made some Linguine pasta to go along with it. My hubby couldn't get enough! Definitely a keeper, thank you for posting!

Nicely done chef john! My wife just loved it and she is a little picky. I did the recipe exactly as shown, and didn't read one review out of respect for the man, chef John. I was also a huge fan. But I would modify next time ever so slightly for my taste. Lets remember that all chicken breasts are different, all tastes are different, and there are countless other variables that are different with every ingredient, stove, pan, cook etc. I would use less Panko as I hate throwing unused stuff away (especially crumbs mixed with precious parmesan), and also season the crumbs a bit with dried basil and oregano. I found after salting meat then using parmesan in crumbs and on top of chicken before oven, it was a tad salty, but that's just my taste. I only used half of the oil and must say the chicken was crispy and delicious looking after frying it as directed, but a lot of crispiness was lost after oven time as the sauce, olive oil and cheese melted through. I just 75% covered tops of chicken with sauce so bottoms were okay crispy, but nothing like it was before I put in the oven. That parmesan panko mix was just perfect for frying but I would just bake for half time then add just cheese for last half of cook time without sauce and fresh basil. The heat killed the basil so I would either add it on top after oven with the sauce, or simply put more in the sauce that I ladle on. I garuntee that would produce same effect, but keep all crisp. Respect to the man, chef John.

This was fantastic! Like other reviewers, I mixed 1/2 panko with 1/2 italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also seasoned my flour with pepper and garlic salt. I didn't measure my oil and I also added some butter and I pan fried 1-2 min/side. I sprayed my dish, then put some tomato and basil spaghetti sauce on the bottom of the dish, covered with the chicken, covered with sauce and covered with shredded italian cheese mixture and baked for 15 minutes. Everyone loved it. Kids gobbled it up and husband said to add it to the rotation!

I was able to easily modify the recipe to make it gluten free. The result was absolutely delicious. I used Bob's Red Mill general purpose GF flour and Kellogs corn flake crumbs.

WOW...now this is Chicken Parmesan! And, while the set of instructions seems long, it really is easy to prepare and the result is nothing less than fabulous! Luckily I had some "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site that I got out of the freezer and thawed for this dish. I used 6 thin sliced chicken breasts, cut back on the amount of bread crumbs and used Italian style bread crumbs vs. panko as that's what I had on hand. I did cut back on the oil since I used a non-stick pan. I opted for sliced mozzarella along with a 6 cheese Italian blend from Sargento. I love that this finishes in the oven - the chicken stays crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My husband loved this dish, so this is how I'm going to prepare it from now on (definitely company worthy). This was perfect served with a side of angel hair pasta topped with the extra sauce, warm garlic bread and of course a nice glass of wine! Thanks Chef John for yet another great recipe!

Rarely do I rate a recipe, but I just have to on this one!  This recipe is EXCELLENT.  I made it as written.  It irritates me when people rate a recipe based on their changes.   It was easy, juicy, tender and delicious!  It will not disappoint!   My family LOVED it!  A keeper!

This was a great tasting recipe.  My only comment is you don’t need 4 cups of  panko bread crumbs.  I made 6 breast and didn’t even use 2 cups.

okay _ i am totally confused...  people keep talking about a video, but the video is for a totally different recipe, which I have made and love.  This recipe is fried and then baked??   am I crazy??  Giving it a five star as written, even though it is still in the oven,  did add a bit o worchestershire to the egg as someone mentioned. and have a lot of panko /parmesan mixture left that I must throw out - next time will use less and waste less.

This was very good. 4 cups of panko is way too much.  I used one cup panko and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese.  Also 1 cup of olive oil is too much for me so I just put a Tbs or so in the pan and that was plenty to brown the chicken.  I used homemade marinara sauce which made a very delicious dish!

My husband said it is a keeper.
Every time we go out to eat and Chicken Parmasiano is on the menu he gets it. Because I never found a good recipe, until now.
I love the idea given about how to flour the chicken. Good suggestion so flour is not wasted. I don't agree with the amount of Panko to use. I had a lot left over. I suggest using about 3/4 cup to 1 chicken breast.
The chicken was moist and crunchy. The cheese was the right combination and amount.
I will be passing this onto others I know that enjoy chicken.
Yummy!!

This was awesome. My wife wanted to make some Chicken Parm, but I as the cook in the family said no, I'll do it. I followed the directions pretty much except I added a little more of each cheese and made it with Marinara Sauce from this site. My wife was very happy and we all thought it was better than we've had at some Italian restaurants. Will definitely be making this again.

Well my husband is Italian and it is hard to  put anything in front of him that isn't pretty authentic italian food, but this was a keeper he loved it. I served it with some pasta and a little extra sauce, I didn't have fresh basil but sprinkled a little dried basil on each breast but other than that followed the directions and it was quick, easy and delicious !!!

We can never go wrong with Chef John's recipes.  This is absolutely delicious, John, thanks.  I prepared a homemade tomato sauce at 9am because I just knew this recipe would be worth it.  If you're in for the long haul, I suggest you follow this to a T because the way it is prepared from start to finish creates an incredible result.  Textures, oh my!  Love love love it.  And my family agrees.

This recipe is fantastic.  I felt like I was an Italian Chef...and should open a restaurant.  I followed it exactly.  And yes, I did use a cup of olive oil.  The pan has to have enough oil because the bread crumbs absorb the oil and the chicken will not cook properly.  I do recommend using excellent tomato sauce.  I made my own sauce (off this website).  It was outstanding.  Also I recommend using really good cheese.  I actually could grate the mozzarella cheese.  The chicken was perfect following John's instructions.  I love your videos! I plan to serve this for my mom's 80's family birthday gathering.  My sisters will be jealous!

I have made this. All you need are cutlets so there is no need for pounding. That is how the chicken gets thin to Cutlet stage anyway.
It is good with pasta. Great dish.

DREAM COME TRUE !!!
I always wanted to make Chicken Parmesan. I thought it would be too difficult. 
IT IS NOT !!
Recipe asks for 4 cups of Panko bread crumbs. I bought Progresso Brand Panko bread crumbs. 
There is about 3 cups in a box, there was more than enough to do all 4 breasts. 
When putting together the chicken Parmesan.... 
I used double to triple the cubed mozzarella cheese. I guess it probably depends on the size of your chicken breast. 
I did not have provolone ... So left it out. 
I used fresh grated Parmesan for the topping.  Also used more than double recipe suggestion. 
I used dried basil.

I made Marinara sauce ( Best Marinara Sauce Yet by Jackie) to go alongside the chicken Parmesan. 
It was absolutely delicious !!!

I've made this recipe about ten times now. It's one of my family's favorite! This last time I made enough to have a second meal. Re-heated it in the oven added extra cheese and sauce, and it's almost as good as the first time. Chef John is the bomb!

Very delicious parm chicken. Had to use what was on hand, Italian panko, spaghetti sauce, and Italian seasoning instead of basil. Turned out nice and crispy with flavorful, moist chicken. Don't over brown on the stovetop because it will brown a lot in 450 deg. oven. The whole family loved it!

I needed to make some changes, then it was DELICIOUS!
Here are just some suggestions that you may want to follow...

1. I used 1 cup of bread crumbs and still had some left over (four cups is far too much, 
2. You really only need 1/2 cup of olive oil to cook the chicken.
3. When cooking with basil it is always better to use dried basil, because fresh basil loses its flavour (sorry, flavor in U.S.) when cooked. 
4. I used Marinara sauce, and did not add any salt (there was enough salt in the sauce and bread crumbs.
5. It should be more clear in the recipe that you actually need (in total) 1 1/3 cups of sauce (1/3 cup for each piece of chicken), not 1/2 cup, as listed at the beginning (confusing).
Hope this helps,
JC

I did not care for this recipe.Took 1 hour 20 mins.t0 make and the top came out too brown from the oven from the oil on it. It smoked up the oven and kitchen. I used expensive organic chicken and the best of cheeses. Will NOT try to make this again. Will just order in restaurant instead. My first try and last try on this one.

My family loved this!! I had to use shredded mozzarella and dried basil, and it still turned out beautifully. Also, I only had seasoned bread crumbs, however I just bought a box from the store and plan on making this again in the near future! Fantastic!! :)

I can't argue with the recipe results.  The dish was amazingly delicious.  However, there are a couple of things that don't add up with the recipe.
#1) It calls for 4 cups of bread crumbs.  This is WAY too much.  You need 1.5-2 cups tops.
#2) The ingredients list calls for 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, however, the recipe directs to put 1/3 cup of sauce on each chicken breast (4 breasts).  The math doesn't quite add up here.  Good thing I bought some extra tomato sauce.  
Again, however, the dish turned out wonderfully delicious .

Delish! I HIGHLY recommend watching Chef John's video that goes along with this recipe. I don't think mine would have come out as well if I hadn't. There are some extra tips there and it's nice to see what each step looks like. To those having trouble with it getting soggy, I think the trick is to not cover the whole thing with sauce, just spoon a little on top (again, watch the video!)
Only changes I made were to add garlic powder with the salt and pepper in step 2, and spooned a line of pesto down the middle of each piece instead fresh basil. Also I just eyeballed most of the amounts. As others have mentioned the some of  the quantities listed may be less or more than you actually need.
Served with simple noodles (with butter, olive oil, garlic, parsley) and a green salad. This is definitely a repeater!

I have made this twice, and it comes out perfect! I've had to use more egg.. maybe it's because my chicken breasts are so large I have to butterfly them. This is my favorite chicken parm by far!

I've never seen Chicken Parmesan made with a tomato sauce or all that extra melty cheese.  The version I've made for 40 years is really just chicken coated with a parmesan bread crumb mixture and sauteed until browned (not necessarily crispy).  The drippings is the sauce.

This version was more like eggplant parmesan, which itself is sort of a lasagna.  Good, but not what I expect.

Restaurant quality!  Best chicken parmesan I've ever had, and really easy.  I always worry about my chicken being dry and tough or not cooked all the way but they came out juicy and delicious.  I made garlic pasta to go with it, and used the oil from frying the chicken to fry the garlic/mix with the pasta and it was seriously better than you can get at a restaurant.  Thank you Chef John!

Do not! Put your cheese on the chicken and then bake for 15-20 minutes, the cheese WILL burn and set off your smoke detectors lol cook your chicken for the required time and put your cheese on the last 5 minutes or so just to melt it.

Delicious, I baked and broiled instead of the frying pan. & I used regular sliced provolone & shredded mozzarella because I don't have fancy cheese around and it was AMAZING.

I made this recipe exactly as written, minus the provolone cheese (I didn’t have any). I used a cast iron skillet, which allowed me to transfer the chicken directly from the stove to the oven. Delicious and easy!

It's one of our favorites. There are a LOT of breadcrumbs left after you bread the chicken however. I hate wasting food so once the chicken was transferred to the baking dish I threw the leftover breadcrumb Parmesan mixture into the pan I'd browned the chicken in with a little extra oil and browned them up so once the chicken came out of the oven I sprinkled the browned breadcrumbs on top for a crunchy coating. Very delicious texture profile

Let me tell you something ... this is by far the BEST recipe I have ever tried!!  I added a twist though, using Alfredo sauce instead of the traditional red sauce.  OMG!  My wife went ballistic and made me promise to make this many more times!  I also graded some fresh Pecorino to the recipe, and that made the difference when I browned the chicken.  YUMMY!!

Delicious and easy to throw together!  Loved how the breaded chicken turned out still crispy.  Used thin cut chicken breasts, Bertolli spaghetti sauce and pre-shreaded Italian mix cheese to make my life all the easier :)  Including a photo of the breaded chicken before cooking...forgot to take pic of final product!

AaaaMAYZing!!! lol!! I didn't have any panco bread crumbs so I used regular Italian bread crumbs. I also didn't use that much oil either, just enough to cover the bottom of my pan.  Chicken came out perfecto.  My family loved this recipe.

Great recipe. The only thing I would do differently is the bread crumbs. You definitely do not need 4 cups. 2 cups would be plenty.

This is incredible!  I cut the breasts in half instead of pounding them, which does not change the recipe.  That, in itself, needs no changes.  EXCELLENT.

It was very good even though I didn't have the provolone cheese. Next time I make I will get the provolone.  The 4 cups Panko was way too much. Don't know why the recipe calls for sooooo much & same with olive oil  way too much.

I had chicken thighs, omitted the pounding, and used seasoned Panko crumbs. I mixed the eggs in one bowl, flour in another, and lastly the cheesed seasoned Panko. Then straight into the crockpot on high (I started at 1:30) when done I heated the sauce separately and then on a nice bed of Angel Hair Pasta I spooned out the sauce per pc, layered the cheese......and viola' !! With salad and your favorite bread...mmmmmmmm

Love this recipe!  Added some additional spices to the panko and I didn't even need half the amount mentioned for some reason.  Chicken was crunchy yet tender, yummy!  Will make again without the fresh basil as I didn't care for it ...but that is a personal thing!

Company loved it. Moist and delicious. I didn't need as many bread crumbs as called for but I did need an extra egg. I also put 2 tsp of Italian seasoning in the crumbs. Will absolutely make this again.

For starters, I found this recipe to be incorrect.  You only need 2 cups of Panko (otherwise, you are wasting 2 cups), and a half cup (at most, 1/3 may be closer to what is necessary) of olive oil.  The recipe could use more flavor, my recommendation is to add some itlalian seasoning and garlic to the Panko, or to the tomato sauce.  The chicken was quite tender and juicy, just not enough flavor.

I never cared for chicken parmesan at restaurants, but I thought this recipe sounded good so I gave it a try & I'm glad I did! I used less than 1/3 C. of pasta sauce on each breast because I don't like them swimming in sauce & it worked out great. This is a great recipe for easy weeknight dinners, yet tasty enough for company, just a great tasty recipe! Thanks for another winner Chef John!!!!

I commented on this recipe a year ago with some modifications we made to it, but I neglected to say how absolutely amazing this recipe is. Perfect every time. I like my chicken smothered in sauce, but my wife does not. The great thing about this recipe is that we can easily customize it for both of our preferences.

Delicious and easy!  I didn't have provolone on hand or panko bread crumbs, so I just used my Italian seasoned bread crumbs with Parmesan mixed in and shredded mozzarella with some grated Parmesan and dried basil on top.  My husband and 13 yr old son loved it!  My son said, "Where did you get this recipe?!"  I served it with sautéed broccoli and red peppers with a little marinara sauce mixed in.

A bit on the bland side with the plain tomato sauce. Some Italian herbs & garlic in the tomato sauce would help enormously. It's easier for me to just dredge the chicken in flour instead of sprinkling it on, then dip it in an egg wash (1 egg + 2 Tbsp water) before dredging in the seasoned crumbs. Also, you can skip the pounding entirely if you lay the chicken breast on the cutting board & slice it horizontally into 1/2" thick slices. They're smaller & easier to handle that way too.

Perfectly delicious!!!  So moist and easy to make.  Didn't even use three cups of bread crumbs, (a lot was thrown away when done).  I used dry basil because it was on hand, spaghetti sauce, and didn't measure much of anything.  I did follow the oven directions though.  Will make again.

Finally! A great Chicken Parmesan recipe that is easy and tastes like it does in restaurants! My only tweak is I add Italian seasoning and garlic salt to the chicken before coating it in flour. Tastes great every time!

After reading the reviews I tried this recipe, using a few suggestions. I split my chicken breasts in half and pounded them to flatten. I brushed them with whipping cream instead of egg. For the coating I used 1 1/2 cups panko mixed with 1/2 cup grated Parmesan and 1 Tbsp Italian seasoning. It didn't need extra salt. The coating was the perfect amount for 6 large breasts (12 halves). I fried them quickly using a generous amount of olive oil and butter, replenishing after each batch, but it was no where close to 1 cup of oil. I placed the cutlets in 2 buttered 8x12 dishes, topped with a large spoonful of pasta sauce and then a handful of grated of mozzarella. I used approc 3/4 C sauce and 250g cheese. I baked uncovered at 350 for 15 min. I wouldn't bake any longer - they came out perfectly. Crispy, juicy and tender. Thank you Chef John!

I tried this recipe for dinner last night. The only change I made was I used dried basil because I didn't have fresh basil. My family absolutely loved it! Sometimes, my kids can be very picky eaters. They were all asking for seconds! I served it with angel hair pasta. The chicken had just enough sauce and was not drowned in it and mushy. It was very crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had never tried the panko bread crumbs before. Very tasty! I used the seasoned kind. I think the recipe called for a little too much though, because I ended up throwing so much of it away. I also think it called for a little too much olive oil. The chicken had just enough cheese and was not overloaded. All the ingredients went well together. I would advise people to watch the video first. It really helps. The preparation was easy, but a little time consuming. I would save it for a Friday or Saturday night (for families with kids) or for a special occasion. It is definitely a keeper and I will be making it again! Thanks Chef John!

I'm not sure how others did this.  Some of my croutons got soggy, and the others... well it just wasn't that tasty.

What am I missing? Recipe calls for 1/2 C of tomato sauce. Instructions say put 1/3 C of sauce on each chicken breast.

I've never cooked Chicken Parmesan before, this turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. This one is going in the notebook.

I loved your recipe Chef John!  I doubled the amount of sauce and cheese & served it with fresh pasta found in the refrigerator section of the market and fresh green beans.  It was to die for!

I've been meaning to praise this recipe for a while now but always seem to forget. I always thought I made a good chicken parm, but this recipe is even better. The combination of the three cheeses and fresh basil on top is awesome! I still use italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of panko (personal preference). I have reduced the amount of my sauce that I put on top, per directions in this recipe, and this chicken parm just comes out perfect every time! Kudos to Chef John, again!

This was AMAZING!!! The only thing I changed was adding a little of my own oregano to the bread crumb mixture. This will be a new staple in our house, thanks :)

It was really very good, but I agree that dipping chicken in flour isn't necessary. Also, I put a cooling rack in the pan and cooked the chicken breasts on top of that so one side doesn't get soggy. Used Garlic & Herb breadcrumbs and Italian Seasoning as well. Will definitely be making again!

Chef John has turned me into a family rock star with this recipe. It is ridiculously easy to follow and achieve delicious chicken parmesan. This was the first time I've ever made this dish and the whole family raved about it/ Then they began making plans for when I should make it again.  Your sauce application recommendation is spot on. Everyone was very pleased with the crunch.

One tweak I did was to use 2/3 canola oil in the frying pan. It's just cheaper. Second, I had forgotten to buy provolone (my favorite sandwich cheese).  Instead, I had some Beemster XO gouda on hand (A.K.A. Cheese of the Gods) and grated some on lightly before and after adding the mozzarella.   I also used a basic spicy marinara on top. It added some nice kick.  The only lament was that my wife and I miscommunicated on the fresh basil, and so we only had dried basil on top.  Even so, it was good and I could taste it, but I love fresh basil and I look forward to having it next time.  One other thing I want to try is cubed plum tomatoes on top, with a bit less sauce. It would add more texture... but it might add too much moisture. We'll see.

Chef John's recipes and techniques are always great and this one is no exception, particularly if you are an experienced cook. If not, I'll make a couple of suggestions. First, olive oil has a very low burn point so be careful if you use it. I don't really think it adds much flavor to the finished dish. You can substitute a high burn point oil such as peanut or canola oil if you like. Alternatively, you can use half olive and half peanut or canola oil, heating the other oil first then adding olive oil. Again, I don't think olive oil is necessary at all and you'll ruin the dish if it burns. The only other suggestion I have is to spoon a little of the sauce in the baking dish before adding the chicken. I always make at least a double recipe and either make chicken parm subs the next day or freeze the leftover for another meal. When reheating, I always add a little fresh sauce.

Made this dish for the first time tonight and it was a hit for my boyfriend and I!  I would’ve gave it 5 stars but I had to make a few modifications such as leaving out the flour completely and using a lot less oil than suggested.  Other than that it was great and I will be making this again!

This recipe was a definite hit at our home.  I am gluten free so I made it gluten free, using gf bread crumbs, and my homemade flour.  I will say that I doubled the recipe and ended up with too much bread crumb/Parmesan cheese mix, but for next time I'll know to just mix together less.   Best Chicken Parmesan ever!  I will definitely make it again.  Looked great and tasted even better.  My family all agrees that it deserves 5 stars.

Once again Chef John comes through.  My 17 y.o. is a big fan of chicken parmesan and he said this was his favorite ever.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I found fresh mozzarella pearls at my grocery store that that saved me from having to cut up. some  Shredded the parm in my Vitamix because I don't have the patience for a box grater with a hard cheese like that.  I did use the grater for the provolone though.  

Served with a small side of thin spaghetti with a little of the sauce used for the chicken.  First course was a salad.  It's a little bit of work and I'm dreading cleaning up in a minute but it was worth it, and I like cooking things like this on Sundays.  I especially like Chef John's tip on using a strainer to apply the flour.  I hate the old method of dredging.  Will definitely make again.

Very good!! I made in cast iron skillet so just transferred to oven when done frying.  I pretty much kept the recipe the same except I didn’t have provolone cheese and only had regular bread crumbs. Will make again.

Did not have fresh basil. But had some dried basil flakes.  Other than that, followed the recipe and it was quite possibly the best chicken I have ever eaten.  Thanks. Will definitely be making this again.

This is pretty much the exact same way I always have made chicken parmesan..one of my husbands favourites.
I didn't have fresh basil and only used mozzarella for the topping. 
Really cannot go wrong.

Made this tonight and it was so delicious! I had been wanting chicken parm., for a while now when I came upon your recipe (so glad I found it)! I made one substitution and that was using Ragu's traditional pizza sauce (all I had) in place of the tomato sauce. Nor did I have panco bread crumbs, just the regular type.  Followed directions as much as possible, but I didn't use cup of oil, just spread some in the pan and that was enough, chicken was crisp and browned and when it finally came out of the oven, it was crunchy, tender, cheesy AND juicy! This was sooo good that even my picky husband loved it!!! Thanks for posting!

I finally found a Chicken Parmesan recipe that my husband and the whole family likes! The recipe is very easy to make. When I'm too tired to use the fresh cheese ingredients, I buy a bag of shredded mozzarella, 5 or 6 cheese Italian blend and shredded Parmesan cheese while using the fresh basil (which I think makes the Chicken Parmesan stand out) and the recipe still turns out VERY good.

Delicious recipe as written.  I loved the crispy crust and the sauce and cheese kept the chicken from drying out in the oven.  I did have a lot of bread crumbs left over but that's the least of my worries. This was my first time making chicken parm and it was much easier than expected.

This was the best chicken parm I've ever made THANK YOU! Hands down the best advice this recipe gives is to NOT put sauce on the bottom of the baking dish and to not slather it in sauce. That in combination with the Panko/Parmesan cheese coating is what made this so good. It was crispy & flavorful and well balanced.

It's definitely a make again!!! It's a perfect Sunday dinner. I made it with my 11 year old and we all loved. We followed the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I would do different is that I should of drained the oil
off of the chicken before putting in the oven, or used less oil. I think that soaking up with paper towels would of be sufficient. I loved that the crispy crust didn't fall off I don't know if the secret is in letting the chicken rest for 15 min before frying or the amount of oil. It's a must make again for us! Also maybe split the chicken breast in 1/2 bec they are huge. We had them as parm chicken sandwiches the next day!

Used only 2 cups breadcrumbs for five large breasts.  Didn't use the full cup of olive oil, only enough to cover bottom of pan.

My first rating and it was delicious! I followed the instructions with the exception of only two tablespoons of oil and adding the sauce after the chicken is cooked. They turned out crispy as they crisp up more in the oven. My husband said it tasted like a dish from a high-end restaurant. Thank you Chef John for this yummy recipe!

I use this recipe as a guideline for the chicken. I make my own sauce. The panko Italian seasoned bread crumbs are way better than regular Italian seasoned bread crumbs.

Came out great. Needed a tip on making chicken parm and this recipe helped. Tweaks: cooked the chicken all the way through in the oil. I don't play around with chicken. Baked it for 20 minutes in the oven at 350 with foil on top to melt the cheese and keep it moist. Came out flippen DEE-Licous.

Fantastic family favorite. Made it as written. It had been a long time since the whole family gathered around the table all eating the same thing. They all insist I make enough for leftovers. Better than any restaurant Chicken Parmesan too. A perfect blend with not over doing the cheese! I wish there were 10 stars!

This recipe is amazing as is. This is the first meal I ever made for a guy I was dating...and now over 2 years later we're married. I'm not saying it was all due to this chicken parm, but it sure didn't hurt.
This meal is definitely a splurge...by no means is this a low cal chicken parm. But if you are looking for a tasty, comforting dish that boasts an ultra crispy crust and is lighter on the sauce than usual, then you totally need to give this a try.

Great base recipe that would be five stars if I didn't modify it to my own ingredients. I personally like regular bread crumbs so I used half regular, half panko and a whole bunch of grated parm. You do need all the oil if you are cooking in a pan big enough for 3-4 breasts. I should say that I did eyeball the ingredients since I only made 3 breasts. Instead of fresh basil I used Italian seasoning and dried basil in the crumb. Delicious.

Everyone loved it, except my daughter, who is extremely picky.  I will be making this again.  I didn't add the tomatoes because my family is not big on them, but otherwise it was great.

I was torn about whether to give this recipe 4 stars or 5. The flavor was FANTASTIC, and with a few minor changes (but major to the overall dish), it would CERTAINLY have deserved a 5. First off, let me just say that I made this exactly as it called for the first time. With my suggested changes, to me, it will be PERFECT next time. First of all, 4 cups of bread crumbs is ENTIRELY too much. I used 2 and STILL had quite a bit left. Secondly, the entire recipe calls for 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, but the directions say to use 1/3 cup on each of the 4 breasts...how does that work? And speaking of the sauce, it was WAY too little. I know that the recipe specifically stated that he was using less than normal, but I used a full cup and still couldn't even BARELY taste it. Also, 450 degrees was WAY too high a cooking temp. I think 400 would do.

This recipe worked well for me with one small change.  I used well less than 1/2 of the olive oil and included 2 TBs of butter for added flavor.  Other than this, it came out fine.  I concur with others about posting major changes to a recipe shared and "blasting" the original.  If your recipe is so different, share it with us as a separate entry.  No point in being rude to those who have been kind enough to share with the rest of us.

So good!  I halved the Panko mix the second time around and still had leftovers.  Will definitely add this to the rotation, although I wish there was a light version that tasted as good.

Substituted ½ the Parmesan for Asiago in the breading mix for extra kick plus dried oregano. Doubled the quantity of sauce to keep it extra tender & juicy too.  delicious!

I guess it depends on the size breasts you use, but I only needed 1 and 1/2 cups panko.  I fried the chicken in about 1/3 cup of olive oil.  Shredded mozzerella would melt a lot better, but the fresh mozzerella has a great mild taste.  Only gave 4 stars because the amounts seem off. Taste was a five.

The best Chicken Parmesan I've ever had, hands down. Crispy outside, moist and juicy inside with just the right amount of sauce and cheese....exactly as advertised. For my cheeses, I used fontina, followed by sharp provolone, and topped with parmesan (the good stuff of course!). Chef John really hit this one out of the park. Thanks for sharing your version, it's the only one I'll ever need!

I made this exactly how the recepie calls for. I like the light use of sauce.  Be sure to fully cook the chicken. my cheese melted fast and I wasn't sure if the chicken was done. the portions were large for 4. I have leftovers for lunch for sure. the taste is great.

Great and Easy Followed some other suggestions: mixed panko and italian seasoned breadcrumbs, used less olive oil and in the future I would put spaghetti noodles on bottom of casserole pan, then  the chicken.

Really good. If I made it again I would try flavouring the bread crumbs with herbs. Delicious! I'd also recommend some extra sauce if you're serving this with pasta.

My family loved this.  My husband's favorite meal is chicken parm, and he even said "best ever".  Wow - that's a compliment to this recipe!  Because I was short on time, I picked up thinly sliced breasts from the meat counter and didn't pound.  I also didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried -- I'm sure it would be EVEN better with fresh.  I didn't have time to cube mozzarella, so I used shredded.  All around delicious!

I didn't have fresh mozzarella but it came out great. The crust was wonderful. Be careful not to get errant cheese on the baking sheet, at 450, it burned, there was quite a bit of smoke, and the smoke alarm went off.

I made this recipe last night. Too bad I didn't check the reviews first for the suggestions about reducing the oil and the breadcrumbs. Other than wasting about 1.5 cups of breadcrumbs I was very happy with the results. Tastes great.

This was very tasty, indeed. I did modify, however. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and about 2 cups. I used pasta sauce. I used Monterrey jack cheese. These were the items that I had. It still turned out great! Thank you.

My 12-year-old son declared this "freaking amazing".  Like others, I thought 4 cups of bread crumbs was way too much, so I used half that amount (2 cups with 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese).  I also used less oil, just enough to make a thin layer on the bottom of my skillet.  I followed the rest as written.  Well worth the time and effort it takes to make.

Very good! I prepared just as directed with the exception of using spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I had a lot of extra panko coating so next time I will cut that in half. I also plan to try the recipe with less oil.

I think this was very easy to make on short notice and provided a tasty and good-looking meal.  I served it with spaghetti but next time might try rice and also add a little more in the way of spices.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious! My husband raved about it! He said it was the best chicken parm he's ever had.  I will say this - I made a huge mess cooking it. Lots of steps. Because of that I probably won't be making it often.  But when I make chicken parm again, it WILL be this recipe. Panko crumbs were awesome!

The whole family raved & praised my efforts in preparing this dish!!

My only variation from the original recipe was that I used Panko & Italian style seasoned breadcrumbs because I didn't have enough Panko in my cabinet. 

This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This is the best recipe for Chicken Parmesan ever! I had been craving Chicken Parmesan for a while and found this recipe. I made it exactly as written this past Saturday. I made a large amount so that I could freeze some for later. Forget that! My family wiped it out before I could freeze it! They are already wanting me to make more and this is only Monday! This will definitely be a regular around our house!

Great recipe! Recipe is amazing as is. Only change I made was omitted provolone as I didn't have any and sliced the fresh mozzarella instead of cubing it. I read another review that said 1 cup is way too much oil. This is very incorrect, you need to essentially "deep fry" your chicken breast just like they do in any restaurant you would order this dish at.

I made this,and  I the only modification I used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce. I left off the basil since I didn't have any on hand.  I'm not sure what the flour did for chicken, but I did it the way the recipe called for, and I will be making this again.

Did not want to make any changes. However, I didn't have enough Panko, so I mixed Italian crumbs. My wife said it was the best she ever had. I'm not a chick parm fan, but it was light, evenly cooked, juicy and I have to say,,, delicious! This will definitely be the recipe, for my wife's favorite dish in the future!

Delicious.  Followed recipe except cooked chicken in frying pan longer than suggested and used a little less sauce on each piece of chicken.  Fresh mozzarella made the difference for us. Family loved it and thought it was their new favorite chicken recipe.

Having just retired and having more time to cook, have loved this site for getting ideas. Was all prepped and ready to cook this receipe and happen to look on the Italian bread crumb box and it had almost the exact same receipe..while my meal came out wonderful, am wondering where it came from?!?

This recipe is perfect!! I've made this a few times, and it's always a winner with my family. You cannot go wrong with following this recipe to the tee. I add garlic to the chicken when I season it with salt and pepper to make it even more flavorful. Putting a little sauce (I use marinara or traditional) at the bottom of the pan is a little something extra that I do, too. ;-)

I did what any home cook would do... I modified it a bit.  I added Italian bread crumbs, garlic powder, season salt, and dried oregano and basil to the panko breading.   The flavor was amazing.  I also used a half a jar of Basil spaghetti sauce to coat the bottom of the baking pan.   Somehow, my chicken was dry... no idea why!  But, the leftovers were better than the dish was fresh out of the oven!  I would make this again... Chicken Parm, you taste so good.

I made this exactly as written and am pleased to say that this is another of Chef John's truly excellent, easy-to-do recipes.  His video is SO right -- why bother making a crispy crust on the chicken if you're going to drown the whole thing in sauce?   I'll make this many, many times again just as written, not seeing a need to spice up the breadcrumbs or anything (a really good marinara would suffice).  Thanks Chef John - it was superb!

Delicious,  it turned out perfect.  Followed recipe exactly except I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves.  We always seem to have the tenders and I wanted it tonight and didn't want to make a trip to the store.  Would have added the red pepper seasoning but didn't have any.

Delicious! Used Progresso Italian-flavored panko bread crumbs.  That, paired with jarred sauce (all we had at the time) gave it delicious texture and flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was simply amazing...I say simple because it truley was! I bought 2 thin cut chicken breast (didn't have to pound them out) and halfed the recipe. I didn't use provolone...but did use the other 2 cheeses like the recipe called for. And used both panko and seasoned bread crumbs... Built my sauce from 3 garlic cloves ...red pepper, ground oregano and black pepper with jar of my favorite tomato sauce ( roasted red pepper from classico)( cooked that first on a simmer) with angle hair pasta. Fantastic! I don't know why some people said it was bland?!?! Came out super flavorful!!

35 stars!  Wife and I loved this!  She's a celiac, so I easily crushed ½ cup of GF croutons in place of the panko.  Seasoning both sides of the chicken in advance, plus letting them rest for 15 mins after dredging etc. made all the positive difference.  I'd even add more fresh basil like ¾ cup instead of ½, too.   I followed the recipe verbatim with Chef John, down to the red pepper.  This was the best Chicken Parmesan I have ever had in any restaurant, and I easily made it!   My wife was happy, I'm happy.  I could even make this as a hit at dinner party with friends.  'Really want to thank Chef John for his oh-so helpful video recipes.  He doesn't need a recording studio, he can phone them in any day...they always work great.  They're so informally easy to follow, even a husband could follow them and not screw them up.  Allrecipes is my favorite go-to cooking website and iPad app.

Just made this for the first time and my husband LOVED it!  The chicken was so tender and flavorful.  I had to make a couple of adjustments but they were minor. I used a version of Monterey Jack (at least that's what it looked like) since I am overseas and they don't have provolone.  Don't have Monterey Jack either so I'm not sure what cheese this was but it was flavorful.  I also didn't have plain tomato sauce so used a jar spaghetti sauce.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!  I've never been a fan of chicken parmesan so I gave it 4 stars but my husband would have given it 5!  Definitely will make again.  Thank you Chef John for one more wonderful recipe.  UPDATE:  Just made it for the first time with Panko bread crumbs and real Provalone cheese!  What a difference!  I'd give it more stars if I could!  SO YUMMY!!  This is going to be a standard in our house!

I have made this recipe  several times as my adult children and grandchildren love it! I leave out provolone cheese and replace with mozzarella and I also make my tomato ssuce with San Marzano tomatoes! Recipe is to die for and is a frequent request in my home!

Delicious.  I did it without the extra provolone but it was still very tasty.  Loved the brown, bubbly mozzarella.

5 stars. Super delicious and Super easy to prepare for. I made as instructed minus the parmesan/provolone cheese since boyfriend dislikes "strong" smelling cheeses but it still turned out fantastic! 
Using fresh mozzarella is a must. I set my oven to broil for the last couple minutes of cook time to brown the cheese on top without overcooking the chicken.
I will be making this again and again and again.

Easy to follow instructions. Tasted great! I gave this 4 stars because of my own unintentional tweaks. I forgot to season the chicken with salt and pepper. Rookie mistake! I also didn't let the chicken get as crispy as I would like and I added a bit to much sauce to the chicken before you add the cheese. I also chopped the basil since I didn't want to eat a giant leaf but then I really couldn't taste it. Next time I will listen to the chef and give it the 5 it deserves.

Everytime I make this there is not a morsel left!  Great for small dinner parties or a crowd pleasing family meal.  I agree that some seasoned breadcrumbs add a little more umphf to the recipe.  Outstanding overall and super easy for a rookie chef like myself.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Played around with the breading ratio and added more parmesan but otherwise made as it is written and it was great.  Served with Bucatini Aglio e Olio.

Oh. My. God!  Another Chef John gets the "It's a keeper, honey!" award from my DH.  He practically licked the plate.  Served on top of thin spaghetti.  
Not a huge fan of sauce (except on spaghetti)), so I loved the idea of spreading the sauce like a pizza - edges of chicken showing.
Sidebar:  Chef John, you were not your usual exuberant self - sounded as if you had a sore throat.  Hope all is well.

This was a hit! We didn't have all the proper ingredients listed. I had to sub sargento 4 cheese Mexican for the mozzarella but it still turned out great! The only thing I don't understand is why 4 cups of panko crumbs? We used 5 chicken breasts and ended up with about 2 cups of wasted panko crumbs. So I would suggest 2 1/2 cups of panko crumbs instead of the recommended 4 cups.

It was so easy to make! We loaded it with full bags of pre-sliced cheese (approx 8 slices of mozzarella and provolone each) and also used about three times more of pasta sauce so the pan was at least an inch high and covered the chicken halfway. It was extremely juicy and flavorful! We also cooked some pasta on the side to go with it! I would definitely like to cook this again

This dish takes a good 2 hrs from prep to table ready, it one of my favorites chicken dishes to make though. When tendering the meat (instead of 4 I used 6 ckn breast) in the freezer bag I also used a little oregano, minced garlic, & Italian or lite Caesar dressing, plus your S&P. It really helps with the flavoring. While seasoning my meat I also boiled my pasta ( thin spaghetti noodles or linguini) so I can place the pasta under my Parmesan chicken while baking. Once the timer goes off .. Whaaa Lhaaa diner is done ! Everyone in the house eats it up (4 kids & 2 adults ) even my biggest competitor & critic my husband enjoyed this dishes ! Plus theirs even leftovers for lunch or for a snack when kids get Hm from school... It's a win win !

This recipe was great. I had never cooked chicken parmesan nor had I ever breaded meat before, so as a novice this recipe was easy to follow. My only comment is that I only used about half of the parmesan/panko mix, so I threw a lot out and would mix less than 4 cups next time.

The chicken came out soooooo tender.  Loved it.  You can use less Panko crumbs.  You can also use much less olive oil when frying.  1/4 cup olive oil was plenty.  You can use less tomato sauce on each chicken breast.  I used about two tablespoons per piece.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you watch the video before you begin. It contains some real smart tips.

Once you get your production line going you can turn these out pretty fast & they make a really nice entree. One word of caution...be careful not to let your oil get too hot and watch them closely when they are cooking...it is very easy to burn those bread crumbs. I make these fairly often and mix it up a bit at times and top with different sauces, cheeses, a slice of ham or some bacon....pretty versatile entree.

Frozen and vacuum packed...when my two sons come to town there won't be any of them left in the freezer when they leave:-)

I have never made chicken parmesan before.  I made this tonight for dinner and it was wonderful.  Chicken was so tender.  I changed a few things because I had it on hand but it was basically different cheeses.  I cooked some spaghetti noodles and warmed some spaghetti sauce on the side.  When serving we did noodles, sauce, & then the chicken.  Along with a Caesar salad & breadsticks.  It was to die for.  My husband & I really enjoyed these.  I have put the recipe into my recipe box and will be making it again soon.

I made this for a dinner party. I ended cutting the chicken breast in half, since I had 8 breasts and 12 people coming. I also ended up using equal parts panko, regular bread crumb and Italian breadcrumbs, as that is what I had in the house(2c. each, WAY too much), with double the Parmesan cheese and a pinch of garlic powder. I used regular shredded mozzarella and sliced provolone since it was all I could find and it worked fine. I would suggest to anyone making this to put the basil under the cheese, so that it doesn't shrivel and brown up. And use sweet basil, it's the best kind. Anyhow, this was a big hit and the smell even enticed my vegetarian mother to have some and she can't stop raving about it. Also, my brothers fought over the left overs (they only do that for one other meal), so I know it's good then. Definitely going to be a keeper.

Totally yum!  I didn't have panko so I used Italian flavored breadcrumbs.  The chicken still was delicious and moist!  I used Monterey Jack instead of mozzerella (again, that's what I had).  The recipe was a good starting point and my lack-of-on-hand ingredients didn't hurt it at all.

Great recipe.  Chicken is very flavorful and moist.  Added a little garlic powder to season the chicken.  Only used 2 cups of panko bread crumbs with 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan and it was perfect proportions.  2 more cups of panko would of been a waste.  Instead of using tomato sauce, I used marinara sauce.  Made lots of the marinara sauce so that I could serve this along with a bed of spaghetti with sauce.   Liked the idea of sifting the flour over the chicken.  Will use that tip on future recipes!  I ended up with 6 chicken cutlets. The breasts spread out when pounding, so, I cut them in half.  Then, I also had two boneless skinless thighs as that is what my BF prefers.  Turned out fabulous!

I liked the method for cooking this recipe. The chicken came out very nicely - crunchy on the outside and softer on the inside. I had my one at 350 for something else and left it there so the chicken cooked at 350 for 20 mins and still came out perfect. I hammered some of the pieces thinner, but others were on the thin side already so I left them alone. All seemed to be good. I did not have fresh basil and I did not have provolone cheese...which I think would explain why it tasted a bit bland to me (even with Italian Seasoned bread crumbs). Looking forward to trying it again with those additions. I can't remember if this was in the original directions, but I did include some freshly grated parm cheese in my bread crumbs and served this over pasta.

So yummy! I would omit the drizzling of the olive oil next time before you bake it. I'm not into that much oil in my food. I made extra spaghetti sauce an put it over noodles. I also used all shredded mozzarella instead of province bc I couldn't find it at the store.

Since I'm not a fan of plain tomato sauce unless it's homemade, I used pasta sauce and it was DELICIOUS! And just as easy as everyone says.It's a keeper. Love your recipes and your videos Chef John.

I do not cook on a regular basis, so when I do I need it to be something fabulous because my husband is an amazing cook. This is fabulous!  Followed recipe pretty much exact, except added a little spice with a spicy olive oil and did 3 cups Panko 1 cup Italian bread crumbs.  Thank you, it's already been requested that I make this more often.

This is a really great recipe! My first time making it I didn't flatten the chicken quite enough so it took longer to bake, which in turn overcooked the cheese a bit. The second time I made it though it was perfect! LOVE the fresh basil. I mixed some plain tomato sauce and tomato paste (to thicken the sauce) to use on top of the chicken breasts. This is def. a 5 star recipe!!

This recipe is fantastic. It got rave reviews the first time I made it and is now my go to dish. The only change I make now is to make my own sauce using crushed tomatoes, garlic, and basil. The recipe is very easy to follow. It is the first one I tried when I decided to learn to cook!

I fixed this according to the recipe. I used regular bread crumbs, instead of panko, because that is what is available at the grocery store. I served it with spaghetti and a tossed green salad. A friend of mine, who is of Italian descent, really liked it!

Best chicken parm I have ever eaten. I like Chef John's way, less sauce more crispy! A few steps but soooo worth it. I have made this twice now for dinner parties and both times my guests raved about it. I always use marinara and add herbs to the bread crumbs.

This was a very good recipe. My son who says he's eaten chicken parmesan many times at different restaurants claims this is the best he's ever tasted...quite a compliment coming from him. They were a bit labor intensive but worth it. Thank you for a great recipe which passed my son's taste test. ;)

My husband's new favorite!  My kids love this!  It is important that you use PANKO breadcrumbs, it makes it crispier and therefore it will not get soggy.  I use Bove's marinara sauce (from VT).  I omit the salt because there is salt in the panko and cheese and I found it too overwhelming.  I also use chicken tenderloins for the kids like because they are smaller (and easier to flatten out and much shorter fry time), but chicken breasts for my husband.   Delish.  Every time.

Super good, do not need to use 4 cups or bread crumbs, 2 cups or even a little less works fine.  Kids love it called it a keeper..

Hi John,
This was the best Chicken Parmesan we ever tasted!! It was cooked perfectly, the coating was crisp, the layering of the 3 cheeses with the basil. The pesto was a nice touch with the infusion of garlic.  You have changed the taste of a white mushroom into a truffle.
Thank you
Ray Alexander
The only change I made was adding a 1/2 cup of dried potato flakes to the coating.  The chicken looked darker and tasted crunhier.

I am not a fan of chicken parm but WOW, this recipe is a winner. Making it for the second time tonight, exactly as the recipe states, and it comes out PERFECT. I'm not sure why other reviewers commented the sauce made it soggy. Don't smother it, just a spoonful spread out will suffice. Definitely a new one for the recipe box.

This is the best parmesan I have ever made!!!  The Chicken was so moist and tender.  Everybody raved about it.  The only thing I didn't add was basil, due to the fact I didn't have any on hand.

Followed the recipe exactly, perfect!  Used homemade tomatoe sauce, fresh mozzarella, aged provolone and Regganio parm.  It didn't need any additional seasonings.  Kids loved it and neighbors who came to dinner asked me to make it again the very next day.  Every recipe I have tried from Chef John has been wonderful.

Since I had never made a chicken parmesan before, I was a little hesitant but the reviews helped me make the decision to make it.  I ran out of Panko bread crumbs, so I improvised with some Melba toast that I ran thru the processor for a few seconds.  I added Italian seasoning to the crums as well as to the tomato sauce (basil, Italian Seasoning, and garlic powder) which definitely helped the overall flavor.  I liked the use of tomato sauce instead of spaghetti sauce due to the amount sauce that would have been leftover.  I made it for two and it was wonderful.  I served it with a tomato-pesto farfalle pasta dish and it was great!

Wow!! What a hit!! So yummy and satisfying. This pregnant mama is happy :) We used the sauce from "Simple Parmesan Chicken" from this site. We didn't have provolone, and I forgot the salt and pepper and it still got rave reviews from everyone, including a picky 5 yr old and 2 yr old. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have tried a lot of different recipes for chicken parmesan and they have all turned out horrible. This was the first one that was actually comparable to restaurant quality. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this recipe and think it is perfect as is.

Made this recipe as is and it was absolutely delicious.  The chicken was tender and flavorful. My husband despises chicken yet has been asking for me to make this recipe again. This dish was easy to make and was quick to make too. Clean up wasn't too tough either I didn't have too much mess after breading.

This was good! I love using panko crumbs to bread chicken/fish! It comes out so much crispier! I made my own sauce (just simmering together a big can of tomatos, a can of tomato paste, and some red wine/spices), and left out the fresh basil (though that sounded wonderful). Easy and didn't take too long.

Best chicken parm I've ever made! I think the panko crumbs make all the difference for that crispy crust! Definitely don't sub that out for bread crumbs. I took the easy route for a lot of things in this recipe-used whole jar of Prego spaghetti sauce, bagged shredded mozzarella and Parmesan, omitted the fresh basil as well as the provolone-it still came out fantastic. Hubby said it was better than eating out! This is worth the effort.

Five stars for this easy to make Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was juicy and tender and the fresh Mozzerella really completes the whole dish.

This is an excellant dish.  My husband has told everybody about this dish.  My mother has requested I make it for Mother's Day. I'm thrilled because it's such an easy dish but makes you look like a gourmet cook.  I would'nt try another Chicken Parmesan recipe and why would I when I have found the BEST!

Cooked this last night, and it was excellent. One of the nicest chicken dishes I have ever prepared and eaten. You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I served it with small italian seasoned roasted in olive oil potatoes and it was delicious.

This was well worth the effort! My husband loved it and said it was as good as any chicken parmesan he's had in any restaurant. I did not have the fresh basil on hand; but I used a basil marinara sauce and just sprinkled the top of each breast with a good amount of dried basil before putting it in the oven and I don't think it was missing anything.

I was looking for my chicken parm recipe and I couldn't find it, so I turned to Allrecipes.com and found this. WOW!!! So easy to make and the flavor was exactly like you get at the Italian restaurants. The fry on the chicken was exactly what my original recipe was missing. Made exactly as directed and it was perfect the first time! Looking forward to making it again.

followed exact except I used italian style bread crumbs instead of plain panko. My husband and 2 teens said it was the best chicken parmesan they ever had! This will be added to our recipe cycle...THX!

Yummy and easy!  next time I'll add some garlic powder to the chicken before flouring, as some suggested.  I used seasoned italian breadcrumbs, which is what I had on hand, and it turned out great.  I added a dash of salt to the egg mixture too, since I didn't salt the chicken that heavily.  yum!

WOW!!! Amazing. I never would have thought that the addition of flour would make such a great tasting, crispy crust. Followed the directions to the letter.I used only 2 cups panko and 3 eggs, and I only had a little bit of leftover marinara sauce as well. But it turned out fantastic! Chef John you never disappoint me. Viva la Chef John!!
This is my new favorite chicken parm recipe and I will use it over and over!!

This has become the most requested dish in my house. Easy to make and with my own sauce it was even better. Had to have some for a snack later and was tempted to have some for breakfast!

This recipe was pretty great  but not the best I've ever had. Needed a little work second time around less cheese, less salt(there is more than enough in the sauce and cheeses), more sauce, don't add oil it's already greesy enough from pre cooking in oil and all the cheese and 4cups panko crumbs way way too much tons left over and I made 5 very large breasts out of it. Turned out great second time and not so rich we couldn't finish it

This is now one of my most favorite dishes to eat as well as cook!!  usualy I don't like making dishes too often but I could eat this everyday!!  The only thing I do different is instead of bread crums I use crushed herb and garlic crutons and I find it's makes a huge difference not only with the taste but the texture.
P.S.
If I were on death row this would be my last meal! lol

I fudged with this recipe at every angle, because of a lack of ingredients, but was quite good.
Didn't have Olive Oil, so I used Canola Oil to fry in. I'd see the difference if it was a super quality Olive oil, but whatever.
Also had Italian Bread Crumbs as substitute for plain breading and seasoning. 
And rather than plain tomato sauce I used a random jar of Prego Spaghetti sauce, your choice of flavor for what makes sense :P

Loved it! Chicken came out perfect and panko bread crumbs really made the dish :) I like spice so I added pepper jack cheese and some el pato sauce. This is my new go-to recipe for chicken parm.

Made as directed.  Added a few spoonfuls of marinara sauce before serving as I served with white rice and wanted it more saucy.  This was very, very good.  Raves from the whole household.

Awesome!  Beautiful Presentation and wonderful flavors.  I have just began cooking after 25 years; I used to be a simple meat and potato comfort food cook.  My husband has been retired for many years and has been the cook of the family; mostly he cooks gourmet and everything he makes is delicious. Since I have retired I have tried many recipes from this site as well as multiple cook books and magazines.  I have finally a bravo for this recipe.  Thank you.  I did change it up a bit.  I increased all cheese amounts by at least 1/3 and doubled the sauce amount.  In place of provolone I used Asioga cheese.  I used 2/3 of a jar of Ragu  Spaghetti Sauce with garlic and onion. I used the extra 1/3 jar of Ragu to drizzle over Garlic Penne Pasta.  I generously sprinkled parmesan cheese over all.  Yummy and beautiful!

This was so good! I have never made chicken parmesan before, so I was looking for a recipe to follow loosely because I had no idea what I was doing. I still followed it pretty accurately.

I did half the recipe. I bought a package of 2 chicken breasts; they still had the tenderloin and weighed 1.45lb. They were huge! I cut off the tenderloin, and cut the breasts in half width-wise. I then pounded them, except the tenderloin. It still ended up making so much.

I mixed salt and pepper into the flour, and a little onion and garlic powder. I then sprinkled the flour mixture to coat each side of the breasts. I also added to the breadcrumbs; garlic and onion powder, dried basil, parsley, and oregano, plus the parmesan cheese. I mixed it all together, dipped each piece of chicken in the egg, and generously coated them with breadcrumbs. I let them sit in the fridge for 20 minutes.

I pan fried them in butter and a little olive oil; 3-5 minutes per side, until they were nicely browned, then transferred them to 13x9 casserole dish, which I greased lightly. I used marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce. I topped with the cheese that I had: monterey jack, gruyere, and fresh parmesan. I did not have fresh basil because it's not in season yet, so I sprinkled a little dried basil, then drizzled with olive oil.

I needed them to cook more slowly, so I dropped the temperature to 375 and baked them for 45 minutes, until the cheese was nicely browned, and served over spaghetti.

Delicious!!

Love it! I have done it many times and it's always amazing. I use Progresso Italian Blend bread crumbs and a Bertolli Sauce - the olive, basil, tomotoe one is good. I've also done half marinara and then half of the bottled vodka sauce - also good - I use all organic products minus the bread crumbs and this is amazing. I serve it over wheat pasta - it's a winner! thank you for this recipe!!! :D

I didn't have the fresh basil or the provolone so I just used mozzarella on top of the sauce. It still turned out very good. I've tried a few other Chicken Parm recipes and this is my fav. Next time I will be sure to have the basil and provolone and I am sure it will make it even better.

This was the best chicken parm I've ever had! Better than any I've had out at a restaurant.  I used less oil to fry the chicken in first but followed it exactly other than that.

Like others i noticed the video and recipe are different. I liked the text recipe so I tried that and loved it. Made the following changes based on user reviews: Make sure to generously salt and pepper the chicken - used 1/2 panko and 1/2 italian bread crumbs along with the parmesan and added garlic powder to the mix. Used Barilla Garlic spag sauce instead of tomato sauce. Loved the added garlic flavor. Everything else was to the written ingredients. Agree, you don't need 4 cups of bread crumbs - you could half it to save on cost. My boyfriend said it was one of the best meals I have ever served him. Def a keeper!

This was the best Chicken Parmesan Ever!  Family and co-workers reported as the best. I steamed frozen italian vegetables as the side and used a recipe here "Best Marinara Yet" for the sauce and used the recipe here "Fettuccine Alredo III" for a side pasta, simple but delicious.  Best Chicken Parmesan ever and will look no further.  Thank you Chef John! Awesome!

Great recipe, I was a little leary at first about baking chicken at 450 degrees but it turned out very good!  I even got favourable comments and that doesn't happen to me very often!  I added a bit of garlic powder with the salt and pepper, I switched up italian flavoured bread crumbs instead of the panko crumbs and used a seasoned tomato sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Chef John!

I made this with my best friend one day and could not believe how absolutely delicious it was. Of course, being poor college students we used whatever we could find that was close enough to the recipe that it could do, and it was still phenomenal. Looking for a diner hit? This is it.

This was easy to make and tasted great. We like bold flavor so I seasoned everything; the meat as I pounded it, the egg mixture, and the panko/bread crumbs. I put 1/3 cup spagetti sauce on top of each meat peice and no issues with soggy crust. Husband really liked it. I did use dark meat as the bag I thought had breast meat was actually dark meat and that worked out just fine. I baked it at 350 so as not to overcook the pounded thin meat and I would do that again.  Thanks for sharing another great recipe.

I'm not sure what happened but this is the most bland chicken parm I've ever made. When you cut into it, the breading you took so long to prepare will slide right off with the sauce and rubbery cheese. Next time I will marinate the chicken beforehand, season the breadcrumbs better, bake breaded chicken before adding the sauce (much more sauce!!), use no provolone, then pop it back in the oven to melt, *then* add the fresh basil.

I believe that the amount of oil is correct for pan frying the chicken.  If you place the chicken on a plate with paper towels prior to placing them in the baking dish it cuts back on extra oil if it bothers you. If you use less oil, the sides of the chicken won’t pan fry.  I used spaghetti sauce as the “prepared tomato sauce.”  I agree with other reviewers that you could add flavor by using Italian bread crumbs instead of plain. It is a great Chicken Parmesan recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

First tim making chicken Parm. And I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again!! Yummy!! I made it pretty much the way it’s written. Nothing needs to be changed at all! I’m lazy, so I don’t always measure perfectly, so I’m sure there are som slight variance on precise amounts. I did use Italian Panko and my favorite pasta sauce. Served it with Spaghetti squash noodles and the whole family enjoyed it very much!! (I made a separate one for my dairy free kid with just Panko, no Parmesan and then only put sauce, no cheese. Still worked great and she loved hers too! Thanks Chef John!

Delicious! I’m so glad  I watched the video first and did it exactly the way he did with a small amount of sauce on each piece. I made it gluten free using GF panko and GF flour and used avocado oil instead of olive oil. Best chicken parm I’ve ever made, best I’ve ever had! Thank you!

This recipe is wonderful. It comes out perfectly crispy. I've made this several times and the only thing I do differently is add some Italian breadcrumbs to the panko. This is one of our favorite dinners.

I made this for Valentine's Day and my husband loved it! I'm not a very good cook at all but the instructions where very clear and easy to follow, even for me. It was a little lacking on the flavor but I think it's because I didn't add enough salt and pepper, so that's my fault. I REALLY loved how crispy it was! I can't stand mushy chicken parmesan so this recipe was perfect for me! Highly recommend giving it a try, even if you know how to cook already.

I was hesitant about a plain tomato sauce but it’s part of what made the flavor awesome. I don’t care for herby sauces so the simple flavor of this recipe is what made it amazing. I’d totally make this again. Served over angel hair pasta.

Made as is except I didn’t put the cheese and sauce on the breasts until the very end.  I only cooked on 400 for 15 minutes. While cooking, I heated up the sauce. When the timer went off, I put the sauce and the cheese? and a few more spices onto the breasts and then broiled for two minutes on low. I had tried it according to directions and it was just way too dry and overcooked. Definitely a family favorite and they agreed that this was the best yet!??

This is a great recipe!  Only did a couple things different.  Added some Italian seasoning along with the salt and pepper.  I also used a bag of shredded pizza blend cheese (mozzarella & provolone). Made my own sauce (tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, garlic, salt, pepper & a little fennel.  It was my first time making chicken Parmesan and it came out AMAZING!

This recipe is amazing!!! I made it for dinner last night and everyone loved it! I didn’t have Panko on hand so I crushed up Chicken’N Biscuit crackers. The flavor was spectacular and the chicken was really juicy. Saved this one in my favorites.

I followed the directions except I used an organic tomato sauce. It was a garlic flavor. This came out absolutely amazing! Will definitely share with others and make it again!

This recipe is AMAZING! Only changed I made were to use regular  bread crumbs because I didn't have Panko ones, and use more parmesan instead of provolone. The family loved it! ?

My husband loves chicken parm!  Tries it at every new restaurant we visit- he has his list of the “best parm” restaurants. I made it on the list with this recipe!  I added a little garlic powder with the salt and pepper- otherwise I followed the directions exactly.

My family loved this recipe.   Had to make adjustments for my gluten allergy, and used Italian sausage spaghetti sauce in place of the tomato sauce.    Will definitely make again.

I followed Chef John's recipe to a T & made the most AMAZING chicken parm I've ever tasted! Thank you Chef John. My family doesn't order chicken parm in restaurants anymore, they claim it's a disappointment now that they compare it to mine.??

It turned out perfect I was so excited knowing that the first time I made a dish for my husband that I never ate myself was so good.I tried it for the first time and I’m really picky and my husband who loves this dish and his family loved it they actually asked him if it was bought which just made me so happy and excited for following the directions to the tea.I give this plate five stars definitely follow the instructions and directions as it follows and it will taste better then Olive Garden. Thanks John!!!!!

It was good and tasty.  One change I'd make is the final baking; 450 degrees for 20 minutes is enough to char anything.
Probably more like 350 degrees to finish cooking the chicken and melt the cheese.

Delicious! We made it just as the recipe stated. I'm not a huge chicken parmesan fan usually  but this recipe had such a crispy coating that I've since changed my mind. Our 6 guests all raved about the dish.

Use fresh basil, for sure. Have extra sauce for serving (my family enjoys the extra on the side). Excellent. Followed the directions exactly using Italian spiced panko. Love it!

Great recipe, but I cant make anything without a little tweaking.  I season the flower with onion and garlic powder.  Add grated parmesan, shredded mozzarella to the sauce, but still use chunks of mozzarella on top.  About 4-5 mozzarella sticks cut with scissors to about 1/3 in slices.  The chicken is done once the mozzarella is starting to bubble and brown.

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I didn't make to many changes except I used shredded mozzarella and dried Italian herbs. Also, I didnt realize this until just now, but I used the grated powder-like parmesan cheese to bread the chicken. Oopsie. It still turned out great though!

i love this recipe soo much-- my first time making it, even though i was totally new in the kitchen, it turned out amazing! my friends and mom loved it, and so did i! the second time though, i made the mistake of using presliced mozzarella instead of shredding some of a polly-o mozzarella block and the cheese didn't turn out as well as it did the first time, so be careful of what kind of cheese you're using!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made!  I've been looking for a way to do the outside of chicken and this technique is the easiest and most successful ones I've tried.  Chef John's video's are also wonderful because he takes you through the process beginning to end, so you know what you are doing each step of the way.  My family gave this one 5 stars, which is the only time that has happened.  ;)

I couldn’t find the provolone so I used a shredded Italian mix instead. This was so good and cheesy.

This was my first time making chicken Parm. I made it mostly as written, and it was delicious. I added some Italian seasoned bread crumbs to the panko and parm, omitted the mozzarella, and used slices of provolone (that's how I've always had it when others made it) I started with 1/2 cup olive oil after reading another review, but ended adding the rest half way through, for the last two chicken breasts. Served it over tagliatelli. Please read recipes carefully. There are others criticizing this for measurements that aren't actually written.

I historically have made a version of this in my slow cooker but the breading comes out a bit soggy that way. The slow cooker version is definatly easier during the week but this tastes better and comes out crisper. I didn't have the seasoning suggested in the recipe so I just used the Italian seasoning in my spice cabinet. Would definitely make again.

I'd give this a solid 3. Imo that's too much sauce. I prefer a little lighter sauce to cheese ratio. Parm is where you get the flavour so the sauce can't overpower it. It should be the accent

Do not use Panko ! Way, way too bland. Use progresso bread crumbs — look for Italian seasoned. And add a little salt and pepper to the bread crumbs. The flour really isn’t necessary. Just add some milk to the eggs but is okay to use if you want . Skip the basil. Use Rao’s marinara. You will love it !!

The chicken came out tender with crispy edges where there wasn't any sauce. My only recommendation is to season the chicken and/or tomato sauce more. Texture was great, but needed more flavor.

I made pretty much from the recipe, but I squeezed a little fresh lemon juice over all of the breaded chicken before I sautéed them.  I like the flavor of the lemon.  Served it with fresh roasted spaghetti squash.  Super Yum!!  My husband thought it was the best he had ever had.

Turned out great! I love basil but thought 1/2 cup was a bit too much. I only used 1/3 of what the recipe called for. Added some garlic. Used 1/2 can sauce and 1 can of crushed Roma tomatoes. Mixed it with some light Italian seasonings and lightly covered as directed. Using the remaining sauce for spaghetti noodles seasoned with butter, garlic, basil and fresh Parmesan.

I have made this recipe many, many times, and when I serve it to company, they love it. I make it as it is written. 
 However, according to Chef John , you can use Pesto Sauce in lieu of fresh basil.  Since I love Pesto, I go with th Pesto Sauce. DELICIOUS!

Didn't follow the recipe exactly - used regular bread crumbs mixed with flour (didn't have panko).  Also didn't beat out my chicken breasts as my family likes heartier meat.  I think the recipe is a great guideline though for this dish - easy to follow and achieve great results.  My family loved it!  I used Prego sauce too out of the jar.

I loved this recipe. It came out almost perfect. I would definitely add more spices to this. Maybe some garlic and onion powder to the panko and parm cheese. Some more seasoning besides salt and pepper to the chicken. But other than that this was so good. I can never eat a full piece of chicken breast by myself and I actually almost ate the whole piece. My hubby tore his up and told me this was about the best he has had parm wise. Thanks for the recipe. It will be going in my recipe book from now on. Of course with some added spices.

Chef John never disappoints! Made this last night for my in-laws, and the raves were real! Flavorful, and not over spiced, the chicken was fork-cutting tender, and the cheese blends amazing. This is now in my rotation. Excellent!

This recipe is awesome. I made a few changes though. Instead of using tomato sauce and basil I used marinara sauce and it still turned out awesome. It was a big hit in my house. My parents loved it and so did my boyfriend. This recipe I will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious.  My husband commented on the lack of sauce, but I told him this is the way the dude in the video makes it and we are going to try it.  He loved it!

There is no "4.5" star option, so 5 it is. Having explained all that (and I just know you were waiting with bated breath for that info), this is a fantastic recipe (as is everything I have ever tried of Chef John's)! Please note that he made a 'new & improved' version of this dish, and it, he uses regular breadcrumbs, instead of the panko that he uses in this recipe. Those panko breadcrumbs are the only reason why I can't give this a full 5 stars. I am definitely making this again & again & again, but going forward, I will be using regular bread crumbs. (His other version uses plain crumbs, but I bet the Italian would be fabulous, too!) The biggest thing, y'all... seriously... *if at all possible, use the FRESH mozzarella and the FRESH basil.* It truly makes this dish. And follow Chef John!! You won't regret it. He's my absolute favorite around here - He makes FUN videos, and INCREDIBLE food. Thanks, Chef John!!

The BF loved this! It was very tender and juicy. I used less oil to fry in because I was preparing one breast. Only had Italian panko, and used marinara sauce for the tomato sauce and used Italian Seasoning for the basil because that's what I had. Quick and simple meal, will do this again!

My family loved it! I had a little more chicken than it called for, so I added about a half of a cup of Italian breadcrumbs to my cup of panko. I used one egg with some milk instead of two eggs, and I didn't have any provolone or fresh mozzarella, so I used sliced mozzarella. I did add Parmesan on the top and the olive oil, too. I deep-fried my chicken in a FryDaddy (it already had oil), which worked like a charm to brown it with less splatter. I know, I know: I changed things. But I baked after adding sauce and cheese, and while dinner tonight was great, I'm equally excited to have the leftovers tomorrow. I'd make this again!

I used plain breadcrumbs the first time, marinara sauce, double, almost triple the parmesan cheese. My family loved it! 

2nd time, I added extra marinara. Came out too soggy.

This time, I used olive garden croutons and smashed them up. TO DIE FOR!

Great dish! Everybody loved it. Making it this weekend for a birthday dinner. Make sure you really pound the chicken breast evenly flat.

Excellent, made as is and wouldn't change a thing. Brilliant adding the parmesan with the panic, made a lovely crunch. I thought I saw or heard on the video reference to 5 OZ breasts. That would be helpful to know the size. I wound up with monster breasts, so had to double the breading. Left cheese as is, and all was good!

I made the dish for 2.
I eliminated the provolone cheese and used grated mozzarella cheese instead of cubes. I also added 1/4 cup water and a can of hot rotelli to the tomato sauce 
I will definitely make this again.  It was easy to put together & I loved the crust of the chicken.
I give it 5 stars...

Another great recipe, Chef John! LOVE sifting flour into chicken idea! Letting breaded chicken sit a few minutes made a huge difference. Had to improvise with cheeses, didn’t have provolone, but Monterey Jack worked for us! Fresh basil really added. Thanks again!

I didn't have mozzarella, so I used muenster instead, with provolone and parmesan. TIP: Don't line the pan with aluminum foil. Also I need to cut the cooking time by 5-10 minutes in the oven. The cheese bubbled over and went under the chicken - and glued it to the foil! I had to rip the pieces off the foil, and pick out pieces from the overcooked (but deliciosus) cheese crust!

Phenomenal! I used a lot of chopped basil to make sure that extra flavor wasn’t hidden under all the others. Made for my family last night; they were all impressed. Paired it with some mashed potatoes, scrumptious dinner!

Temperature was a bit too hot. Maybe it is just my oven but I would do them at 400 or 425 instead.

I like the recipe,  I don't enjoy eating chicken parm that's been drenched in tomato sauce. I followed the recipe for frying the chicken it was easier than I expected! I used a  can of diced tomatoes and added a couple of tablespoons of pesto to it and spread it on the bottom of the baking dish. It is definitely better and tastier without the heavy sauce.  Great recipe!

Very good! I didn't change much of the recipe. I used 8 thin chicken cutlets and the recipe's measurements were spot on. I preheated the oven when I started frying the cutlets, not at the start of preparing the cutlets. Remember, they have to sit for 15 minutes. I only sprinkled one side of the cutlets with salt and pepper, otherwise it would have been too salty. I used dried basil and it was fine. (One time, by accident, I put  1/2 c. of parm with 1 cup of flour. I still dipped it in 1 c. of bread crumbs and 1/2 c. of parm. Pretty good!)  I covered it and then uncovered for the last ten minutes. It was in the oven for 20 minutes. I've used provolone when I had it and shredded parm when I didn't have provolone on hand. Both will work, but I prefer the provolone. Wonderful!

This was delicious and easy. I double the recipe for leftovers. I don’t use basil and add a bit of spaghetti sauce. I am a bit heavy on the cheese and it is so yummy toasted brown.

I followed the directions pretty much with the exception of shredding the cheeses. I used a cheap organic tomato sauce but it seemed to lack flavor... I think using a pasta sauce would be better...

I've already made this at least 5 times and I think it is the best Chicken Parmesan I've ever had!!!!   It's fantastic!  My family can't get enough of it.   Love, Love........Note:  I sometimes  spice up the bread crumb mixture  a bit  with some Cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. I also use a small bit of Italian seasoning as well but this is perfect just the way it is written!  Thank you!!!

Great recipe. Easy to make, instructions are clear. And the clean up wasn’t awful at all! Would make again. It didn’t blow my mind but it was your standard chicken parm.

Even my boyfriend, the pickiest eater in the world, loved it! He refused to try marinara sauce on pasta before I made this dish with him, and this chicken parm recipe has finally shown him what he’s been missing out on! This dish will be a regular for us!

I used this recipe because it had panko breadcrumbs. Regular breadcrumbs don’t get crispy like panko does. This was delicious. I used the recipe with jar sauce. I only used the oven to melt the cheese. Otherwise I cooked the chicken to correct temperature on the stove. I will definitely follow the flour, egg, and panko steps to make crispy chicken again.

Most excellent! I made it gluten free for my husband and me. I used coconut flour and used parmesan as the “bread” crumbs. I will use the powdered parm next time.

Amazing, even when adapted to be gluten free. I used gluten free panko bread crumbs, and served with gluten free shell pasta. Just the right amount of sauce so that the chicken stayed crispy. My husband loved it! Can’t wait to make it for guests.

My husband fell face first into this dish! He LOVED it - which means I love it. (Really like to see him enjoying my cooking!) He said he wished I’d found this recipe a LONG time ago and that I should fix it regularly. 

I had forgotten  I previously used all my mozzarella cheese, but I had some cottage cheese and substituted. I also used a whole can of tomato sauce because I needed to use it up. I separated it and put some in the dish and then placed the chicken on top of it.

I made this for my family last week and they absolutely loved it!! Then I made it for my sister and her family and they were raving about it!! They said it was restaurant quality! The only difference I made was I added Italian bread crumbs to the panko and grated cheese mixture. Delicious!!! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

5 star, very good. used seasoned panko bread crumbs. all the cheeses and instructions got confusing lol, as long as it all gets on there, that's all that matters. was delicious, served with some angel hair pasta. oh, and you only need about a half a cup or less of olive oil for the whole recipe.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I made a few minor additions, such as using Italian bread crumbs and seasoning to the dredge. I served it with additional marinara sauce and egg noodles topped with mozzarella cheese and a side salad.

This was yummy and I would've given it 5 stars but the recipe calls for far too little sauce.  For my family's taste, anyway.  I will make this again with 3-4X the sauce.

Delicious!  The only change I would make is maybe covering it with foil until the last 10 minutes or so (may have to cook a little longer)  because the cheese ended up burnt- but still great!

This is great, and yes, if you’re using a large electric skillet one cup of oil is needed. Not if you have a basic small skillet and cooking one at a time. Nowhere does it say 4 cups of panko either, to another post. It’s a very good recipe. I was able to use one less egg and I will use seasoned homemade breadcrumbs next time.

This is a terrific weeknight recipe.  I followed the recipe almost exactly...I pounded the chicken thinner than 1/2 inch which required more Italian Panko crumbs and I added extra parmesan only because I was out of provolone. 
The next time I prepare this, time permitting, I will probably heat the tomato sauce with fresh oregano, parsley and basil (only because I can't help myself from tweaking any recipe and I always have fresh herbs on hand.)

This was probably one of the best chicken parms I have had. My kids loved it. The only change I made was using seasoned bread crumbs rather than panko only because I didn’t relaize I ran out of panko! Anyway, it was a great meal with minimal mess and less frying involved.

I too used two chicken breast and the full sauce recipe. I butterflied each breast, ending up with four pieces. I seasoned each breast with lemon pepper seasoning and also seasoned the flour and Panko mixture the same. After browning the chicken, I placed them in a baking dish, covered them tomato sauce and cheese and baked until the cheese was browned. 
I served the chicken with pasta and more tomato sauce. It’s a keeper.

I used seasoned panko, I didn't measure my oil but made sure there was lots in the bottom of the pan and used mostly vegetable oil with just a bit of olive oil for flavor. I put most of the sauce on the bottom of the pan and a generous tbsp. of it on top of the browned chicken. I used mozza and fresh parmesan and didn't put extra basil. I had angel hair pasta and used almost a whole bottle of garlic spaghetti sauce.

I rarely follow a recipe exactly.  I used dried basil for example instead of fresh.  No provolone, just mozzarella.  These are inconsequential things.  However, my family loves this recipe.  Making it again tonight!

This was super delicious. I made it with a mix of shredded mozzarella and provolone cheeses instead of the mozzarella slices. I also omitted the basil but it was still delicious!! I will be making again soon.

My family loved it! I increased the recipe by half and added an eighth-cup of Tony Chachere’s creole seasoning to the breadcrumb mix. I also used a shredded Italian 6-cheese blend and added a sprinkle of pink Himalayan sea salt on top of the cheese. I was really pleased with the results!

The cheese burned. The chicken had great flavor and was cooked nicely, but I would definitely recommend piling the cheese on midway through the cook time.

I am NO chef. Found this video by Chef John and decided to give it a try. Had my wife buy me all the fixens and using the video went step by step, laid it over a bed of pasta and you won't believe this but it was better then our local Italian place we go. Guys, make this dish for your wife to show her how much you love her. It looks very hard to make. It's not but your better half will be so overwhelmed that you pulled this off for her.

The breading technique was a great lesson,worked perfectly. Loved how they had just enough sauce for individual servings. I only used shredded mozzarella, as I personally don't like the taste of the other cheeses. Got complements on the dish, and I thought it was delicious also.

I liked this recipe!! I also made a simple sauce for this dish and the pasta.  I included a mire a poix and peppers.  I also added onion and garlic powder and sun-dried tomato pesto.  I didn't have provolone or mozzarella, instead I used havarti.  It turned out to be great! I will make this again.

More work than my other recipe for Chicken Parmesan. The only thing I'm for sure going to change is the tomato sauce - plain to the Italian Herb tomato sauce for more flavor.  We also use fresh parmesan cheese & fresh basil. Have made a couple of times now.

Everything tasted very good. I might try baking the chicken some before adding the sauce next time because my the coating got soggy.

Used regular spaghetti sauce with no meat, just added a little basil. Double batter the chicken. And I didn't add the cheese until the last 5 min of cook time in the oven. Turned out great.

First off, this is the juiciest my chicken parm has ever come out. It's a nice medium-effort recipe that lends itself easily to little changes (didn't have provolone handy so I added more parmesan, added garlic powder along the way because we love the flavor so much, etc). We'll definitely do this version again.

I pretty much followed the recipe as is and I also doubled it. So I would have leftovers. This is the bomb. I’m actually tasting it right now as I’m writing this review. This is a must try recipe if you love chicken Parmesan. I know my husband is going to love it! Just make it, trust me it’s worth your time and money.

I used shredded mozzarella and Swiss on top. I didn’t have provolone. Everything else was followed. This was great! I’ve tried other recipes. My family and I agree that this is the best one.

This is going to become a staple in our house!
I had to modify the recipe for a Gluten-free diet in the family.
Substitutions included:
GF flour (King Arthur's)
GF cornflake crumbs for the Panko  I also used a GF Coating mix to add seasoning.
GF jarred Marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce
Dried Herbs de Provence in place of the Basil
Shreaded Colby Jack instead of Mozzarella (I wasn't going to the store just for cheese, lol)

This turned out FANTASTIC.  I will be making it again.  (I'll try to have mozzarella on hand, OK?)

This is a very simple, very tasty recipe. I subbed marinara for the tomato sauce and added more cheese than recommended; we like chewy, gooey chicken parm. Add a salad and a bit of fettucini alfredo on the side and this is a big hit at dinner time.

This was amazing. Just like grandma used to make and she is from Italy. I always recommend using a homemade sauce.

Only variation I did was sprinkling some Adobo season on chicken while in pan. My wife says she will be asking for this dish for her birthday meal. That is a first for me!  An excellent recipe!

Soooo good!  Added Italian spices before baking and waited until last 5 minutes before adding fresh basil.  Restaurant quality!!!   Recommend purchasing thin cut breasts for ease of prep.

This was an easy recipe and the results were superb!! The chicken was moist and tender and the Parmesan added to the Panko gave the best crunch!  I’ll be making it again real soon!

I made this a couple of years ago and it was good, followed the recipe exactly.  I decided to make this again yesterday and read some of the reviews first.  The adjustments made by RebeccaD  sounded great, so I followed her tweaks precisely and, OMG, what an incredible dish!! I can't believe how delish this was.  The only thing I added to her recipe was to put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes at the end to  brown up the cheese a little bit.  Thank you Chef John and RebeccaD!

So good. 

Changes (took from another user):
Rather than using eggs  & flour, use heavy whipping cream. Brush the cream on both sides and then toss with the parmesan & bread crumbs. Less mess and tasty!

I followed the recipe verbatim and my family raved about it.  I made it for mother's day and my wife really loved it.  I might look into marinating the chicken first in some kind of italian marinade to get more flavor into the chicken.  I would also look into adding more flavoring to the bread crumb crust.

This recipe was great!  I did like others use a 50-50 mix of panko and Italian bread crumbs, but other than that stayed true to the recipe.  My family devoured it. We will definitely make it again. Thanks

Another Chef John home run!  I love all the practical tips in the video.  Followed recipe exactly, but couldn't bring myself to use a whole cup of  olive oil in the nonstick pan.  My family loved it, but thought there was a little too much  sauce - will use less than 1/3 cup on each breast next time.  Will definitely make again.

I actually went by the recipe exactly including fresh mozzarella and basil and I don’t think it would’ve turned out the same if I used cheese slices and dried basil. It turned out sooo good my husband had three helpings!

This turned out delicious!  I made my own marinara sauce by cooking 2 cans of petite tomatoes and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Once the tomatoes had released their flavor I added a couple squeezes of Cento tomatoes paste (I love this stuff).  I add in seasonings like basil, oregano onion and garlic powder and let it simmer for a couple hours.

This recipe is delicious as written...  I see a lot of reviews that say they are use to the Parmesan being covered in sauce, if they read the description this is what Chef John was trying to avoid and it’s so much better for it. You get a much crisper dish this way. Thanks Chef John!

Wonderful recipe. I’m not sure why all the suggestions for drastic changes. I literally followed this to the letter except for two things simply because of items I had. I used Rao’s tomato basil jarred sauce and I used Monterey Jack in place of the provolone. It’s CHICKEN parmesan. The star should be the chicken. Mine turned out perfectly cooked (I timed everything according to the recipe) and very moist and tender. Definitely going to take this one down to the firehouse when I’m on shift. It’s a keeper. Paired it with the basil parmesan orzo that popped up when I did a search for most popular chicken parmesan.

Another great recipe from Chef John.  Made this for dinner and the family loved it.  The only deviation was using Italian bread crumbs instead of the Panko.

My husband considers himself something of a chicken parmesan connoisseur, but after I made this, he is now reluctant to order it out because he's pretty sure this is better than any other he's ever had! I will certainly make it again - the only change I made was to use pesto instead of basil. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise.

Second time making this.  I used chicken tenders from the meats section.  Lots of chicken parmigiana.

I have made this again and again because my family LOVES it!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I add fettuccine noodles, veggies or a salad to go along with it, and it is a GREAT meal! The leftovers are so yummy too! The only change I make is that I use a good marinara sauce in place of tomato sauce.

Made as directed except provolone (we didn't have any). I did watch the video and appreciate smaller tips (season the chicken not the breadcrumbs, allow breading to dry before 'frying'). 

I did brown in my cast iron skillet,  then drained remaining oil before baking in oven. My pan was already so hot I could easily reduce temperature to 400 and cook for a few less minutes with same end result. 

Very nice crunch and flavor combos. We served with a salad and enjoyed very much- will make again.

I've made this twice, both times my family loved it. On the second time, I had a little extra cheese so I added it. I'll be repeating that. The chicken was fabulous.

This recipe was so simple and easy to follow but DELICIOUS at the same time! I am not a chef by any means and get rather terrified in the kitchen, but this was so fun to make. And the best part, my fiancé saved the extra and took it to lunch the next day. In the middle of a tough work day it made me feel good when he texted me how delicious his chicken parm was for lunch. I will definitely be making this again!!!!!

I pretty much followed this to a T and it turned out superb. Using an entire cup of olive oil seemed pretty overkill though—if you want to save money, just eyeball the amount and brown 1-2 breasts at a time on the skillet. When adding the cheese, I grated equal amounts provolone and mozzarella, then added a decent amount of basil and mixed it all into a bowl until it looked something akin to cilantro rice LOL. The one thing I really experimented with was adding the basil/cheese layer first, then the tomato sauce, then sprinkled parmesan on top! Popped it in the oven for about 10 mins and it was perfect :)

Chef Brad & I made it last night. It took longer to prep and we had to turn off the oven twice since we didn't read all instructions at once but followed step by step. Also, we forgot to marinate the chicken with salt and pepper. It turned out to be very flavorful still. And so crispy. Loved it!

Excellent recipe.  I did not have any tomato sauce on hand, but I had some pizza sauce left over from a califlower pizza I made the other day,  which added the right amount of seasonings without having to add the basil.   It turned out really good.  Family wants me to make it again.

Delicious! The chicken was so so tender and juicy. I used a little butter with the olive oil but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as written. It pleased my husband and 3 hungry teens. This is a keeper.

We made six servings. We did regular bread crumbs instead of panko by preference. We also used mushroom spaghetti sauce with a little Merlot in it and layered the pan with some sauce then the chicken then covered it in sauce and covered the pan in a shredded mixture of parmesan, mozzarella and provolone all over then cooked according to the recipe and added more of the cheese mixture and made with spaghetti noodles. We also put the breaded chicken right into the hot oil instead of letting it sit for 15 minutes like the recipe said to after dipping in the eggs then bread crumb and cheese mixture. Otherwise, we followed the recipe and it was really good. We also covered the noodles in the leftover cooked sauce on the noodles and added some cooked and uncooked cheese.

I seasoned my chicken breasts with fresh squeezed lemon juice, chopped garlic and Adobe seasoning. The dish was amazing and the chicken was so tender..

Made this with only mild changes and it turned out beautifully. I forgot to take a photo because we were all so hungry! Only change I made was adding additional Italian spices into the Panko along with using grated Romano. I did have to use more Romano and some extra Panko as I had a few more chicken breasts. Aside from those mild changes, the recipe was superb. Hats off to you and thank you for providing the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.... I made one substitution ....I used mozza on the first layer then on the second layer I added a generous amount of Gouda/Parm (artikaas) and I think it sent it over the top ....so many incredible flavours in this dish .....thanks for sharing this chef :)

First time preparing chicken parm!  Delicious & very tender, received several compliments from a group gathering!  Next time though, I will omit red pepper flakes - instead kick up the flavor with garlic & onion powder,  thyme & turmeric seasonings before breading. Also I will use Italian flavored Panko crumbs and fry with olive oil & butter.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper!

I made it with my 16 year old budding chef.  We didn't have fresh basil in the house.  But the dried was fine.  We also didnt have the provolone so we just used more fresh parmesan and mozzarella.   What could be bad?  It was delish!  It lasted w dinners and tastes better the second night.

I am not typically a fan of Chicken Parmesan but decided to make this for my family.  I loved it and so did the family.  Following some of the other suggestions, I did add some seasoning (I use Zoe's seasoning in just about everything) at nearly every step in the process.  I also cooked in half butter, half oil and made my own judgement on the amount of sauce.  Pretty minor changes all in all. Made all the difference.

This recipe was a amazing and was a hit. It was my first time cooking chicken like this and I really enjoyed it. I did forget to season the chicken at first. But no worries, I just seasoned it before putting it on the skillet. I did include some Italian bread crumbs with the panko seasoning and grated Parmesan. It think that helped elevate the flavor.

Great option for dinner, only changed 1 thing. Instead of putting the sauce and cheese on then cooking for 15-20 mins. Put the chicken in the oven first for 12-15 mins by it self, take it out and put your sauce and cheese on and put it back in for the remaining time. I usually go with 15 and an extra 5.

the cheese gets a little to overcooked if it's in for the whole duration, and if you just put the sauce on first you'll dry it out. My way has worked great multiple times.

This was quite yummy! Forgot to sift flour. I sprinkled some dried basil over sauce, then placed the cheeses on. Oh, and we forgot to sprinkle the parm.  and oil on top.  We put some breasts in an 'air fryer basket' and others directly on the baking sheet in the oven at the same time. The ones in the 'basket' were a little crispier. A keeper.

My boyfriend said this was the best meal i have ever cooked him. I had never cooked chicken Parmesan before so i was nervous about it becoming soggy. This recipe makes the perfect crust! It was crispy and very good. The only difference was that i used a shredded Italian cheese mix for the topping because it was cheaper. I am sure the fresh mozzarella would be even better! Thank you for sharing this recipe chef john!

Made just as written. Remove chicken from baking dish and place on a platter immediately or else they'll soak up the grease  in the pan. Delicious, wouldn't change a thing!

Made it exactly as written, minus the fresh basil. Served with noodles and toasted bread.  Excellent meal. Even my pickiest eater enjoyed it. Could be customized a hundred different ways, but it's great just as is.

I have to say one thing before anything else... unless you are buying pygmy chicken breasts, focus on getting  1/3 pound chicken breast per person and you'll be fine.  And I say this with the disclaimer that I eat a LOT. Problem is, you need to fit the pounded breasts into a standard baking dish, and I had to use a 9" x 13" AND an 8" x 8" to get this done. Was it worth it?

Oh, HELLZ yeah!

This is a simple, great recipe. What I come to Allrecipes for, and what I usually get here. The recipe as it stands is almost certainly fine on every level. I changed only a couple things and I think it came out better because of it. I could be wrong... Let's see.

First things first, had I known this would be so good, I would have planned on using two 9" x 13" baking pans (Pyrex pans) and just run forward like a drunken reveler heading to Mardi Gras. Perhaps the faux pas was my own in not putting 2 + 2 together on my own in the first place (4 chicken breast halves , a total of 1/2 cup tomato sauce and you are to place about 1/3 cup on each breast: this isn't rocket science. Then there's the flour... "Or more if needed" should always make you suspect the involvement of wine in the posting of a recipe, but if it doesn't, weigh it against the overall amount of the specific food it's supposed to cover. 4 breasts that need flour for dunkin' comes out to "Or more if needed"! Start with a 1/4 cup of flour. Flour is cheap.) 

Second things second; you're using eggs and bread crumbs. Have you EVER

This was great!  I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I used Rosso Pesto Sauce from Aldi.  The flavor was great and the chicken very moist. 15 minutes in the oven burnt some of my cheese so I'll keep a closer eye on that next time.  This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent.  I did not flatten my chicken.  I also add a layer of fresh spinach under each chicken breast and I bake it about 10 minutes longer to make it more crispy.

Chef John does it again! Fantastic suggestions of using panko instead of regular bread crumbs and limiting the sauce while baking.  Turned out so moist and tender and...STILL CRISPY!  Genius.  We served it with angel hair and everyone could add extra sauce to their pasta to their hearts content.  This is a fan fave in our house!

Changed the breading, love the panko and added corn flake crumbs along with some parmesan cheese. (the addition makes it very crunchy and preserves the moisture).
 Fried chicken til half done and finished in oven.  Chicken was juicy and well cooked.  Served with spaghetti and Chef John's pasta sauce.  Great meal!

I'm 16 and this is the first dish I've prepared for my family where everyone was like "mmmmm" and only struggled to swallow it because it was too hot and delicious to wait for it to cool down. It tasted juicy and tender and like pizza honestly, but better. It's light enough you can feel good afterwards but heavy enough you feel satisfied. The ingredients are not what my family is used to using since many of them are not found commonly where we are from so we had to buy almost everything for the dish. I didn't add more oil on top of it because it seemed a bit much and it turned out perfect with a little bit of oil on the bottom of the pan. I cooked it in a casserole dish with the lid on first and then took the lid off and turned the oven on broil to let the cheese brown since it wasn't doing it on bake. It cooked way more than we expected so not everyone was able to finish a whole chicken but that's okay because they liked it soo much they wouldn't let anyone else eat it and wanted to save it for tomorrow. Hahaha. Overall the dish was scrumptious! Next time I'm adding three slices of mozzarella instead of 1 and adding paprika to the breading. We also couldn't find provolone in the store (it must of been out) and made it without it but I didn't even notice anything was missing. I may add it next time if I can find it and make a salad or some "angel hair pasta" like some of the people in the comments here which will be also new. I'm glad I got to enjoy cooking this with my famil

This turned out very good, but I did cook it on a skillet first and put it in the oven instead of frying it so it wouldn’t be as bad for you.

Made this for my husband for V-day. He usually does the cooking so when he is impressed with what I make that means it's definitely good. I didn't have provolone and only had shredded mozza so I had to make those changes, otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great. The chicken was VERY juicy and quite flavourful. I enjoyed this and would totally make it again!

I adapted this recipe a bit.  It was a huge success and by slicing the chicken I made 11 serving instead of 3. I served it on top of spaghetti noodles that I tossed in 2 Tablespoons of olive oil, 4 tablespoons of butter,  1-2 tablespoons of garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  We will be having this again.

This was my first attempt at chicken parm and both my wife and I thought it was delicious!  My cheese did turn brown though. Not sure how I could’ve avoided that as I used a digital thermometer to make sure the chicken hit 165.  Didn’t matter though, as it still tasted wonderful.  I made some fresh pasta to go with it too...

I thought I had rated this last time I made it, but I guess I forgot! It is definitely a 5-star recipe. I am making it with Chef John's Pasta sauce! It is pretty easy to make, just a bit messy. For sure use the panko bread crumbs, it makes it super crispy! I like to roasted garlic flavored!

Being fairly new in the kitchen, I elected not to change the recipe one bit. And I was extremely pleased I didn’t - for this was the best meal I’ve ever made at home. Great recipe - easy to follow - and can’t wait to make it again.

I don't understand the instructions to cook this dish at 450F degrees?  My dish was burnt beyond saving even though I removed it prior to the recommended cooking time. Maybe it's me ?.  I will try again but at a lower temperature.

I've made this several time and it is absolutely my favorite chicken parmesan.  Better than anything I've gotten in a restaurant.  It's crispy and cheesy and tender inside.  I usually mix panko bread crumbs with Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I don't always have grated provolone, so I just use extra mozzarella and I've found that works fine.

Pretty much followed the recipe, but used pre-packaged chicken breast cutlets, which cut out the  pounding and reduced the frying time.   Used good jarred pasta sauce with provolone, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses on top.   Tasted amazing.

Made this tonight for the first time, minus the basil and provolone (because I didn’t have any).  Excellent dish in a pretty quick time frame.  Will definitely make it again!

This is a great kid-friendly meal!  I used chicken tenderloins so I didn’t need to pound them - (my supermarkets also offer thin sliced breasts which would work well) - anything to avoid an extra step!  I did do half butter/half olive oil, generously.  This recipe calls for the chicken to almost be fried versus sautéed- so if you’re going healthy, go for the sauté. If you’re going to impress, fry these up!  Either way, works. Some commented on the “blandness” - I would agree, but kids love bland!  You can jazz up half of the dish with extra herbs for the grown ups, and keep it as is for the kids.  This recipe works - method is the best I’ve come along on in a long time.

I made it with thighs instead of breasts (the person I was cooking for prefers dark meat) and cubed the meat before breading  and it was really good.  A complete and total hit!

Chef John strikes again!  Love that his main focus is keeping the cutlets crispy. Was initially concerned the bread crumb coating wouldn't have enough flavor. Used grated Locatelli cheese and seasoned Panko bread crumbs - no salt or pepper or anything else. First bite convinced me how wrong I was to be worried.  My whole family loved this dish, in fact it's 5:45 a.m., the next morning and as I write this  I'm reheating the last chicken cutlet upon request so my boys can split it for breakfast before they go to school.

This is a great recipe. Like another reviewer I use panko bread crumbs and mix plain with seasoned crumbs. I also add some additional basil and parsley.  I use a jarred sauce -Bertolli Traditional marina and it’s fabulous!  I usually make my own sauce, but it’s a meat sauce. The chicken  is the star here. It’s tender and juicy and full of flavor. Thanks for a wonderful recipe. My husband loves it. I’ve made it several times and it comes out flawlessly!  Thanks!

Love this recipe! Made it as written and it turned out perfect. I would highly recommend watching Chef John's video before making this dish. He has some tips that I think are really important. Also, make sure you are using as many of the "fresh" ingredients as possible. I think that makes a difference. Will definitely make this dish again!

Loved it! I made two changes, I only had a 1/2 cup of panko so I used a 1/2 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs and I didn't have fresh basil but I did have basil infused tomato sauce. I loved the combo of fresh mozzarella and provolone.  Overall a great recipe that was easy to follow and one that I will make again! Thanks for another great one Chef John.

This was awesome and easy. With left overs i put some tomato juice in the bottom of the pan. The pan was just enough for the 2 left over chicken breasts. I poured a little juice over the breast and reheated in over. It was just as good as the first time. My husband loved it!

My kitchen is too small for this much prep but it turned out delicious and was easier than I thought. I will be making it again.  I didn’t follow the cheese portions to the letter, more cheese is always better in my opinion.

Awesome recipe, the hubby loved it, I did stray slightly by using a little more sauce, and no provolone.

I did not have Italian seasoned bread crumbs so I added oregano, basil and parsley to the Mayo Mixture and I sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top instead of bread crumbs. It was amazing!

It was my first time making it, so I definitely can improve, but I would say I should have put more parmesan on top. 

Tip: Make your own tomato sauce. It's super fun and tastes great.
Tip: Do not get shaved parmesan. Get grated, like the directions.

This was worth the time it took to make it, for sure. This was the best chicken parmesan that I have ever made. The breading was so nice and crispy, and the chicken was tender and juicy. I left out the basil/pesto (the recipe says you could). Served it with some garlic bread and broccoli on the side. SO GOOD.

Really enjoyed it. Only thing I changed was using Panko with herbs garlic and Parmesan. Also made a side of spaghetti with it. Cooked  half in glass the other half in a small cookie bun pan which cooked much faster. Also used pesto on top and mixed half tomatoe sauce with spaghetti sauce. Minor changes. Was moist and really a hit.

It was great! I did not have provolone so I sprinkled a little gruyere cheese on with the other cheeses. It was yummy!

Oh my goodness - so, so good. Letting chicken "rest" w BC mix, excellent tip. Cubed mozzarella is a great too. I just use a little more sauce.  C

The Parmesan in the Panko was key for an overall great taste.

It was delicious! I added garlic powder seasoning with salt and pepper and used Italian bread crumbs and a marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.

I had high hopes of this recipe after reading the reviews and I tried it exactly as written. It was pretty good but definitely needed a little more flavor. I also think the temp needs to be reduced slightly. I will be trying it again, though, but seasoning the chicken first and turning down the oven temp a little.

really good! i think next time ill use more sauce but the flavor was great. be sure to mash the chicken breasts so they are thin and the flavor distributes through each couple bites. i used an "italian" style panko bread crumb mix. really kicked up the flavor.

I love chicken parm and am always trying out new recipes for this dish. This one was a good find! Admittedly, I didn't have the fresh ingredients (recipe calls for fresh basil and mozzarella cheese, but I used dried basil and shredded mozz), which I'm sure would've made this dish even better. I also didn't have the provolone cheese, so the dish was lacking another cheese. I didn't have panko bread crumbs, but found that plain bread crumbs I had in the pantry did just as well. Overall, a pretty decent dish that was quick and easy to prepare!

My family loves this version of chicken parmesan. It's not swimming in sauce and cheese, so crispier chicken without sacrificing flavor. We've made this several times . Love it!

The breading was a bit bland, add some seasoned Italian breadcrumbs to the mix.  Also, put the cheese on with 7 - 10 minutes left in the oven, otherwise it may become brown and overcooked.

I had leftover spaghetti and sauce. I wanted to spruce up my leftovers, so I chose this dish to do that.  It was delicious! I followed the directions to the letter, even though my chef husband thought the temperature was too high. It turned out perfect! I am very good at following directions. My family loved it. I will definitely make again. I love you Chef John for making me look so good in the kitchen.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and my husband loved it. This might be our tradition now. I used parchment paper to pound out the chicken, which worked better than ziplock bags do, in my opinion. I needed 3 eggs and used way less oil (plus 2tbs butter), but other than that, I followed the recipe, and it was absolutely delicious. I served it over a bed of spaghetti, thus I made extra marinara. Thank you, Chef!

Made it according to the recipe and it was a big hit, even when reheated the next day.  Definitely use a home made sauce for best results.

I had some pecorino romano and used some of that instead of the parmesan cheese. Next time I'll follow the directions as I think the parmesan would have been better.

My family said it was the best chicken parm I’ve ever made.  I used less oil and sprinkled minced garlic and Italian seasonings on top of the chicken when frying.  I didn’t have any provolone cheese so just used mozzarella on top when baking.

This is how I always will prepare chicken parmesan. I didn't have olive oil, so I used vegetable oil to fry the breasts and did without for the rest of the recipe. I used shaved fresh parmesan with the panko breading and it was ahhhh-mazing.

Used a little more mozzarella and tomato sauce than what was suggested- the results were great! Made it five times with both extra cheese and sauce and as written- both versions were plate cleaners!

Excellent.  The breaking g stays on the chicken.  I used seasoned break
d crumbs instead of pablo, it's what I had on hand. i plan fried it until golden, topped with cheese and finished it in the oven at 325degrees for 15 min. Chicken was juicy and tender.

This was awesome!! The only things I changed was I used dried basil instead of fresh because I forgot to buy the fresh lol and I used a jar of our family’s favorite spaghetti sauce. It turned out great. So delicious.

Best chicken parm I've ever had! As anyone, I added my own little quirks. (real garlic, garlic plus, roasted garlic and peppers, and cajun spice to the panko bread crumbs) I also removed the salt and pepper as I used other spices. I used alfredo noodles with alfredo sauce. The rest of the recipe, I followed to a tee. I will NEVER order this from a restaurant again as no place could beat this recipe! I almost wish I worked at a restaurant because everyone deserves to be able to try this fabulous meal! I can't wait until my next dinner party as this will be my main dish.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and put the extra in the fridge. If the batch I bake today is half as good as yesterdays I made it will be spectacular. I highly recommend this recipe, will save it for future use.

Really straight forward, great taste, and nice and crispy. I added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to the panko and parmesan cheese mixture and only had to cook the chicken in the frying pan for about 30 seconds each side to avoid from burning. Other than that, I basically followed the recipe as is and it was awesome.

Small correction to above, I skipped the provolone because I missed in on the ingredients list and didn't buy it. I also cooked it on a wire rack on a cooking sheet. I find that makes things even crispier. Still love it!

Great recipe ! Only 4 stars because I would add more pasta sauce next time and cheese. I made the recipe exactly how they said next time I’ll add some of my own things such as, seasoning the bread crumbs and chicken more, adding some garlic in the oil before frying the chicken, adding more pasta sauce and adding more cheese. Will make again!

This is a great recipe! My daughter and I made this, incorporating a few suggestions from some of the reviews. We reduced the amount of oil, used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, shredded mozzarella(skipped the provolone), and dried basil. This will be a staple, for sure!

Great recipe! It's delicious as is, so no need to make any changes. I have also tried it without frying the chicken first (I just baked it) because of special dietary requests. It was just as good that way, in my opinion. When skipping the frying, I omitted the olive oil and flour, and I waited to add the cheese until after the chicken had cooked. This is definitely a keeper!

easy to make and sooooooo good with the right ingredients. Buy a nice piece of bread and toast it mmmm. Get a good kind of parm cheese and provolone. 

if you make your own tomato sauce, this is another excuse to make more :)

You definitely should use thermometer when frying the chicken, and a deep skillet. Will be a bummer if you end up over cooking or under cooking the chicken, so just buy a thermometer.

I loved it as directed! I will definitely make it again! The chicken was moist and he is right about not saturating it in sauce and cheese. Easy to make and so yummy!

I've made this twice and each time the breading has been a little prone to falling off.  I am going to try a more finely grated parmesan next and be sure to use a flour sifter as I think that might have caused some inconsistencies in the battering.

I pounded out the chicken to make them thinner and they still took a long time to cook and the panko fell off like always. But I think it’s the cook. Otherwise good.

Waaaaaay better than anything I’ve ever made before, and I honestly can’t think of anyone else making it better. The tip of waiting 15 minutes after breading kept all the breading together

Great recipe. The cheese melted into a fine layer on top so I added mozzarella to give it a thicker top side. Served it with linguine noodles.

Recipe was easy. My kids loved it. It also looked beautiful. I made a second batch for myself gluten free using almond flour and gluten free breadcrumbs. I also substituted  tomato sauce for  pumpkin cardamom sauce. This turned out to be delicious. Love this recipe.

Just made the dish and my whole family loved it!!! My chicken was a bit thicker and I fried it a little longer. Baked for 20 minutes and got a perfect dish! Used fresh basil, I think it adds extra special flavor. This recipe is saved and will definitely make again!

Delicious.  I did marinate with onion and garlic and salt and pepper the night before and had chicken tenders so I used those. I used two for each chicken breast.  Use 8 of them.  Also made my own bread crumbs and did season them.   The chicken tenders were even so did not do anything to them.  Made more sauce as directed to use 1/3 cup of sauce   Delicious

This was delicious and very easy to make. My husband really liked it. I love the tip about the flour. I have wasted way too much flour dredging. Not anymore. Make this. You won't be sorry.

I cook just for myself so I used about half of the recipe. (Winging it most of the way) I also used 1 chicken breast cut in half so mine was slightly thinner but none the less delicious! I didn’t measure the flower, just used what was needed and used the same preparation method as in the video. This is the best chicken parm I’ve ever had! I love that it’s not drowned in sauce. Definitely saving this dish for when I need to cook to impress for a date! Highly recommend!

I was not able to find the provolone so I used Italian blend instead and it was amazing. Also used Italian Panko to give it a little punch.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and shredded cheese that I had at home everything turned out perfectly after watching the video I realized the importance of pressing the bread crumbs into the chicken and waiting 15 minutes.

Made this for Sunday dinner and everyone loved it! I used fresh mozzarella and provolone cheeses ( even though it was a little bit pricey ) and it turned out great. The only thing that I will do next time is to add more of the tomato sauce to the pasta before I serve them ( because we ate them over pasta, and that’s just a personal preference ). Other than that, this recipe is a keeper. Will definitely make it again and again! My daughter was already asking for the recipe. Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe. Super loved it!

I would definitely make again.  My family loved it.  The 1 cup olive oil was daunting, but once in the pan, it really doesn't look like too much.  I typically don't use a cup of oil, so that is probably why I don't normally get a good crisp.  My only substitution was because Giant Eagle was out of fresh basil for the 2nd week in a row.  I mixed a basil paste with the some fresh parsley and it tasted fantastic.  Chicken was super moist too.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it without provolone, didn't have any, but used mozzarella instead. I also used seasoned bread crumbs instead of panko. I added some penne pasta with sauce on the side with garlic bread knots.  It was fabulous.  Tasted as good as anything from a local Italian restaurant.  My husband loved it too.

Only changed the cheese so I wouldn’t have to go to the store. Also I only had one egg so I added heavy cream. Absolutely will make it again. Husband acts like I now owe it to him. It was that great.

The Recipe turned out amazing!Super easy to make, just takes a while to make sure everything is prepped.  My partner gave it a 9/10! I did not have any provolone, so I just used all mozzarella instead. One thing as a suggestion, is to add tomato sauce and place it in the oven,  then with about 5 minutes remaining adding the cheese then. This way, the cheese would not separate from the chicken.

This was delicious!!!! My picky eaters loved it! I omitted the provolone cheese because my family are not big cheese eaters and it was still very very good! My husband and kids are not cheese lovers but they really enjoyed this meal!

This meal was originally for my oldest son, but when my very picky 9 year old tried it and has asked for it again I knew this was one to bookmark, screenshot, print out, and engrave in the memory banks for sure!

First time making chicken parmesan and this recipe was literally perfect! I was shocked.

Changes: 
-Used sunflower oil because I was out of olive oil
-Let the chicken sit for 15 minutes, then flipped it and added a bit more flour to any areas that were still sticky, and let it sit another 5 minutes. 
-Used a regular bag of "Italian blend" shredded cheese vs fresh mozz and provolone. 
-Used "Italian Style" breadcrumbs
-Added a few sprinkles of seasoning salt in addition to sea salt and black pepper

Great recipe ..... with a modification or 2.  I'm just wondering how a lot of people made this "exactly as written" and managed to put 1/3 cup tomato sauce on each of 4 chicken breasts when they started  out with only 1/2 cup of sauce.  What's the magic way to get sauce to multiply itself?  lol  Add some salt and pepper to the breading so it's not blah tasting.  If you want the crust to stay crispy, avoid putting sauce on the chicken when you put it in the oven.  Fry the chicken a bit longer and when putting it in the oven, just put the sauce around it and not over it.

I am a HORRIBLE cook. I can burn water. But this was AMAZING! My picky husband, who doesn't like chicken parmigiana, went back for more. My kid hates cheese (weirdo) but he loved the rest. I served this over angel hair pasta with salt, butter, and pepper. I forgot the olive oil drizzle. Next time I'm going to add more sauce. I used Prego Marinara but only about 3/4 of the jar. Seriously, this was one of the best chicken parmigiana dishes I've EVER had.

This was a really delicious way to prepare chicken breast!  I followed the recipe exactly, however, I left off the mozzarella cheese/basil since I didn't have that in the house (and the recipe was a little more "heart healthy" without the extra cheese).  The chicken turned out so moist and flavorful!  I served it with a pasta Alfredo and garden salad, and the family gave it rave reviews.  Will make this again!

Delicious! I added a little oregano to the breadcrumb mixture and didn’t use flour before dipping it in the egg. One of the best chicken parmigiana recipes I’ve eaten.

Followed the recipe with a few slight modifications (extra cheese and a little Italian blend cheese mixed in with the bread crumb mix).  Came out AMAZING and served with a small side of skinny pasta noodles.  Whole family loved it and it has become a favorite.

I added a little garlic and black pepper to the tomato sauce. I also use thin chicken breasts rather than pounding the chicken. I also used dry basil. 

This was easy to make. I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic!! Teenager tested and Mother approved! lol. Unfortunately, I did not have fresh basil on hand. I used some oregano and garlic powder sprinkled on top but next time I will definitely use fresh basil. My picky teenage girls 13 and 15 keep complaining that I make the same dinners all the time and asked me to make something I've never tried before. We are all glad that we did. The video was an added bonus as well. Thanks for sharing your recipe! :)

This recipe is fantastic!  It is worth the extra steps (waiting 15 mins. Each after sifted flour and crumbs setting) and the expense of sautéing in olive oil.  1 cup, wow!  The coating  was crispy and almost pumped up while the chicken was moist and juicy.  Just yummy and I had two pieces!  I would totally serve this to company and I don’t say that lightly. It was that good.  Use fresh tomato sauce and fresh basil.  Don’t skimp, it’s what makes this SO good.  The only thing I’d add is Italian seasoning to the crumb mixture because I had plain Panko crumbs as the recipe did not specify plain or flavored and I think it would have been enhanced with the addition of the herbs. Subtle but important.  I bought good mozzarella for the top as well and it was worth it.  Great recipe!

Made as written, we liked it very much!  Placed the chicken on top of sauced spaghetti noodles with broccoli on the side.  A very nice dinner.

QuestIon?  Prepared tomato sauce...???  Is this spaghetti sauce?  I really can't accurately rate this dish yet as I plan on making it tonight.  I haven't obviously made parm  chicken before as I am assuming the sauce isn't plains tomato sauce.

Thank you

This was one of my best meals. At least that's what my boyfriend and I thought. I buy huge chicken breasts from Sams club. I pounded them with a regular hammer in a plastic bag because that's all I have and it worked to even them out. Then I cut them in half.  Since I didn't want my sauce to taste like spaghetti sauce in a jar (because that's what it was) I fried some onions and garlic in oil, then added white wine and the sauce and more spices. Next time I should add more than one clove of garlic.  Simmered it for an hour or so and it was great.  I also didn't have the correct cheeses so I just used what I had including some older cheddar cheese that I just cut off the mold and it tasted a little sharper. I love sauce and was tempted to use a lot of it. But I followed the recipe as Chef John said don't drowned out the chicken. The crunch was awesome and my fresh basil from the garden was awesome.

I used garlic Panko crumbs, and once breaded, I left them in the fridge for an hour to make the breading stick.   These are Texas sized breasts, so I also lowered the heat to 400 for a 1/2 hour to make sure they were cooked through.  Amazing recipe though!  Thanks.  :)

Just a few adjustments - I don't pound the chicken breasts, I either use thin cut breasts or halve regular breasts the long way; they will cook quickly and are moist.  I mixed half panko, half Herb & Garlic bread crumbs; added 4-5 minced garlic cloves and fresh ground pepper to the beaten egg. I don't let them sit 15 minutes after breading the chicken breasts, and I heat the skillet with just 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil before pan frying. I cover the bottom of glass baking pans with some sauce (only one pan needed for 2-3 people, used two pans for 4-6 people and adjust recipe amounts) and place only a single layer of the pan fried chicken breasts on the sauce. Layered imported provolone, then added sliced  smoked fresh mozzarella instead of regular,  for awesome added flavor. Added more sauce, then the chopped basil and sprinkled with the parmesan cheese before baking as directed.  This is now my go-to chicken parm recipe!

Delicious.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts, and a combination pack of shredded mozzarella and provolone.  I sprinkled Italian seasonings, along with fresh basil, on top of the sauce before baking.

Nice recipe, but I used homemade day old Italian bread crumbed with dried herbs , Parmesan , and toasted a bit in the oven. then cooled. Panko is nice for frying Japanese and Asian style seafood dishes but I prefer a more traditional Italian American breadcrumb since Chicken Parmesan is an Italian American dish. Chef John is great but I'll go with the old school style.

Me and my hubby loved it. I like shifting flour instead of using a bowl, because the chicken  was more evenly coated.

A wonder of Wonders!!  My Daughter, Wife and even my 13 yr old granddaughter raved about this dish.

Firstly, before anything else you do.... Watch the vid! Chef John has some cost-effective tips on flouring your chicken. As well as seasoning the chicken, instead of the flour, eggs, and panko.  You will never do it any other way, again.

Two things I changed was to use my wife's spaghetti sauce. Of course... The other was to use Italian Seasoning instead of fresh basil, which was not at hand.

The most important aspect of building the layers, per Chef John, was using the sauce sparingly. Keeping it away from the edges, about 1/2", so they crisp up in the oven providing that delicious crunch factor.
  
Chef John recommended the mozzarella and provolone be cut to about  3/8"pieces.  Believe me, it's worth the extra effort.  With all the cheeses, I made sure to keep them on top of the sauce bed and away from the edges, as well. I made sure to remember the sprinkling of olive oil over the cheese.

One last thing I did. Not knowing just how much the chicken got done while frying, I checked them at 12 mins and found that was sufficient time to read 165 degrees F. 

I hope these tips will produce the same savory and delicious results as was enjoyed by my family. We WILL be making this again and again...

I made this tonight for our son's 21st birthday. He always asks for Chicken Parmesan for his birthday.  I have made many different  recipes over the years and have never settled on one recipe.  We are done looking.  This is the best, most amazing recipe ever!  We had our whole family over and everyone raved and raved about how wonderful it was.  The only thing I did differently was to use pre-made sauce because I misunderstood the directions.  Sooooo very good!!

This is an outstanding recipe.

I made homemade sauce. I have never bought store bought sauce, and never will.

It was so delicious. The chicken was moist and awesome, and the cheese crust was sooo good.

I really liked how crispy the breading turned out. I think it could have used a bit more flavor by adding herbs to the bread crumbs but it was still very good.

My family really liked this even though I did make a couple of changes. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, my favorite jar of sauce & no provolone cheese. It was still so good and we will be having this chix parm again soon.

I used only parmesan cheese (I’m allergic to mozzarella) and it was very tasty.  I didn’t use the flour, as recommended by others.  I used dried basil and plated the chicken over spaghetti.  I would recommend that you ensure the oil is very hot before you begin frying the chicken.  I began too soon and the chicken at the end was much crisper than at the beginning.

I’ve not made this yet, but one part of the recipe is a little confusing.  In the list of ingredients, it says:  “1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce”.  Further below in the instructions it says:  “Pour 1/3 cup of prepared tomato sauce over each piece of chicken”.  That’s  4/3 of a cup of the tomato sauce.  Which is the it?  1/2 c or 4/3 c?  Have I missed something?

Chef John, who doesn't love your recipies...this was the best chicken parmesan I have made ...it was crispy as promised. I really do think it is because of your tip to not have the prepared chicken submerged in sauce while baking in the oven ..a little on the top was perfect!  I will be making this again.

Super yummy delicious! The only thing different was omitting the parmesan from the Panko, simply because I was out of it. Other than that, the chicken turned out so moist and tender, the breading so light and crisp, and the fresh basil I used from my garden really gave it that oo-la-laa oh so fantastic and mouth-watering burst of flavor! Thank you Chef John - great video, too!!

Very easy to follow. I like the tips about layering sauce and cheese directly on the chicken instead of in the pan.  Will definitely make it again.

I agree with Grandma G. Great recipe when made as written. However, as with just about any recipe, there’s room for your personal touch. I’ve been making this recipe for over 3 years now. It’s a family favorite. Most of the time I make it as written but if I want to modify for the sake of creativity or out of necessity, it’s always worked.

I wasn't sure when I decided to try this, but I am very happy I did?  We loved it.  The only thing I did different was to use a canned spaghetti sauce and heated to the side and then served pasta with it and some of the extra sauce.  We will be making this again for sure!

I thought this recipe was exceptional. I really enjoyed it a lot and it completely sufficed my craving for chicken parmesan. However, I did just a few things different- not a lot- that the recipe didn't call for. Such as doing slices of the provolone instead of grated. And I didn't use Panko brand crumbs, just generic crumbs and they worked just fine. I was a huge fan of the sauce recommended and put more than the recipe called for on each chicken and it turned out great. I didn't do full chicken breasts, either, cutting them into cutlets, which works just as great.

This is the BEST ever!  I used an entire jar of  my favorite Marinara and a mixture of aged provolone and fontina cheese instead of mozzarella, for the topping.   It was the meltiest!

I loved it and will make it again (and again). I cut the breast in half by weight. A whole breast can be too much for some and I also find it easier to pound them to the same thickness.  This recipe has balance. Details like the blend of cheese, the fresh mozarella and basil make for an exceptional dish.

Hi Chef John - Chef Jack here. I thought I would give this recipe a try. I must say it was absolutely delicious. Everyone commented how good it was. The only thing I changed is I browned the crusted chicken longer, as a professional chef  (I trained at CIS) and at 450 degrees chicken breasts pounded out to 1/2 inch  and baked for 20 minutes will be over cooked. I browned them in the fry pan until they were  almost done then I put all of the delicious cheeses on top and the Basil, and popped them in the broiler until the cheeses melted..  The chicken came out perfect. Thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe.

I usually don't change the recipe, but I had some leftover homemade marinara sauce and used that instead of tomato sauce. I also used Italian bread crumbs. The result was a very flavorful moist chicken dish that I will proudly serve to company.  Thank you Chef John

It turned out great.  I was thinking the panko bread crumbs were too much and was going to use regular bread crumbs.  I had some panko on hand, so I used themand it was delicious.  This is my “go to” recipe for this dish.  Was great with zoodles.

Made this twice now and it was delicious both times! Followed the recipe without changing a thing. I'm a pretty basic cook and I'm  usually afraid to try anything too fancy. Great instructions make this super easy and the finished product makes this look like I'm cooking above my skill level :) Definitely a keeper .

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I did, however, not have provolone or fresh basil, so I used dried Italian herbs instead. It was still pretty delicious. Will be eager to try it with the fresh basil next time (when I am more prepared :) )

I didn’t have provolone cheese or fresh basil so I added more mozzarella and dried basil. This is the best chicken Parmesan we’ve ever eaten.

Outstanding recipe! I made no changes and my family raved about it! My fiance says this recipe is as good or better than any restaurant, and he always orders chicken parm when we dine out. Excellent recipe!

By far the best and only Chicken Parmesan I eat! It is the perfect combination of taste and texture. I follow the recipe exactly as recommended. I serve it with  small bowls of Marinara sauce for those who want more. It is delicious!

Excellent. Since I'm trying to watch my fat intake; I cut the oil down to about 1/4 cup and it worked just fine. The chicken turned out perfectly when I pulled it out of the oven.

This is the best chicken parm I've ever made! I forgot to drizzle olive oil on top before I put it in the oven but it really made no difference that we could tell. It was moist and delicious but most of all, the breading stayed on! That is the biggest challenge I have making anything breaded and this time it came out as it should. And the tip about using a strainer to flour the chicken was so helpful...I intend to do that with every recipe that requires dredging in flour going forward. Really first class recipe and techniques. Bravo Chef John!

Rave review from family.  Crispy,  and oh so satisfying.  Froze some of the breaded chicken and they turned out just as good as the fresh when baked.

Turned out better than I thought it would. I had low expectations since I had never fried chicken before. Used canola oil instead of olive (apparently Chick-fil-A uses canola, so my husband wanted us to use that instead) and it turned out great. Threw it over spaghetti with a little extra sauce and it was better than ordering it from some restaurants we’ve been to.

did exactly as the recipe called for..... except didn't use so much oil to fry the chicken.  Only a little oil and non stick spray.  Needed to be low fat for health reasons. But absolutely delicious!!!!

This recipe makes a delicious chicken parm!  I had never made this dish before and it turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again.   I used seasoned bread crumbs, not Panko, as that is what I had on hand.

This was my first time preparing anything this involved. Never washed, breaded, and pan fried before. This is what happens when the designated "kitchen manager" gets laid up. Soooo
I had the oil too hot for the first piece but then things went smoothly.  Bottom line.  This was GOOD real GOOD. I plan on making this again, (with wife's help). The balance of herbs and cheese was wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic as is.  Now everyone wants the recipe.  The chicken was so moist.  I wouldn't change a thing about this.  Maybe have extra sauce for those who like more.  TOTALLY ??

Excellent! Just a few small deviations from the directions.. Dredged the chicken in flour so I needed more of that. Added some water to the egg and a little  salt and pepper to the flour.

Amazing!  My chicken breasts were huge so had to cut down a bit and then double the recipe, but they turned out perfect.  Tender, Juicy, just wonderful.

I've made this a couple of times and serve over a bed of spaghetti. It's definitely a favorite at our home.

Super delicious! The whole family loved it. Had it with a side of noodles one night, and a salad the next day with leftovers. Will be making this again!

I still kind of feel like a chicken parmesan should be as crispy as a fried chicken breast from Wendy's. The flavors were fantastic and chef John has a great recipe but maybe it's my perception that needs to change.

I didn't have fresh basil, so I used Italian seasoning, otherwise I followed the recipe to a T.  It was awesome! The best chicken parmesan I've ever made. I'm so glad I made it and I'll make it again. Kudos to the chef for all the tips along the way. Those are what makes a difference! Bellisimo!

The only things I changed were that I used mozzarella that I sliced off a block, skipped the provolone, plain bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning, onion powder, and garlic powder, and I used the Italian seasoning instead of the basil. All changes were because it's what I already had on-hand. Served over spaghetti. This was so good. Great recipe.

We actually had to substitute a LOT of the ingredients (like Mexican blend cheese instead of mozzarella and provolone, and we didn’t even have a bit of Parmesan!), and it was still good! I can’t imagine how good it will be next time when we make it the “right” way.

Because I'm gluten free, I dusted chicken very lightly with cornstarch and ground up multi-seed gluten free rice thin crackers for gluten free panko since I had run out.  Having watched Chef John's video and made chicken parmesan many times before, he is SO right about using less sauce and cheese. Less is definitely more. Wow!!! Can't wait to eat the leftovers!!  Exceptional dish once again Chef John. Thank you!!!

I didn't have any Provolone cheese, so I substituted Asiago and Romano cheeses for that layer.  It was excellent.  A hit for adults and kids alike.  
I've never had Chicken Parmesan before, but my husband (who orders it every time we go to an Italian place) says it is  a keeper.  Definitely making it again.

This recipe is so delicious! To really get the cheese browned put your broiler on high for about 2 minutes prior to removing from the oven.

Fabulous!  I followed the video, using less oil than the recipe called for and didn’t measure out the marinara sauce but used an amount that looked like the same as Chef John.  The panko mixture called for was the perfect amount.  Served the garlic toast, green beans and a simple salad.  Raves from all my guests...definitely a keeper!

I will definitely make this again! I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil for frying and baked a little longer. I also didn’t have provolone cheese so I used cheddar. Husband said I got it right!

Brilliant. Followed recipe almost to a tee (used shredded mozzarella instead of cubed). Still turned out exceptionally well. Chicken was moist, it had a good crunch on the outside, and with a good quality Marinara sauce, it made for a very very tasty dish!

This turned out delicious! Juicy chicken with great coating and tons of gooey, melty cheese! Only complaint was maybe they were too thick? I pounded them, but they were huge! Made 3 breasts for a family of 4 and we didn't finish it in two meals! And not for a lack of trying! LOL!

Instead of fresh basil, i used the dried one (just rubbed together in the palm of my hands), everything else was as the recipe stated. My family has now declared it Chicken Parmesan Mondays'

my husband brought home thin sliced chicken breasts. I found this recipe. the only change "I didn't  pound them thin", they were thin enough, cooked evenly and were fork tender. and used an open jar of pizza sauce.

Really great recipe!!  Decided to forego beating the chicken and instead sliced each breast in half. This required more egg and bread crumb+cheese mixture to dip the chicken in, but loved the extra crust we got out of it!

I made it exactly as the recipe calls for. It turned out too crispy, my family prefers a softer chicken. Overall it was very good and tasty.

For our family, it was a bit too saucy/wet for a crisp Parmesan Chicken.  My suggestions would be to make sure you have thin chicken breasts, use a good marinara sauce with herbs, consider broiling to crisp up the cheese and breading and using italian herbs to spice things up.  The chicken, as the recipe listed above, was a bit bland.

My first time making chicken parm and it was amazing - one of the best I've had! Crispy! And juicy! Perfect. Not too difficult either. I did not use a full cup of oil to brown the chicken and it did not need over 10 min in the oven.

This turned out very good.  My bf really enjoyed it as did my neighbor.

I made it as directed with the exception of I made my own Marinara sauce and topped it with that instead of tomato sauce.  I served it with Penne pasta and brussell sprouts.

Best Chicken Parmesan I've ever tasted- made me really proud of my very limited cooking skills. Very juicy chicken and the breaded texture was perfect, didn't leave me feeling heavy after the meal. I served it with simple asparagus and it was divine.

This is our new favourite recipe for chicken. It is not too complicated, and chicken remains soft, even after reheating. I do not follow the amount of ingredients exactly, but use it more as idea what to put, and in which order. Once again, excellent and very tasty chicken breast recipe.

The recipe turns out a perfect chicken parm as is. Pair it with some butter and herb tossed pasta for a nice meal.  One star off because the seasoning is a little bland for this traditionally bold dish and the seasoning needed some tweaking to suit my family's tastes.

I loved this version of chicken parm. I definitely loved having more crunch and not overpowered with sauce. The seasonings were really good, but may add a little more garlic for my own taste next time.  Husband and kids loved it as well.

Easy recipe, great for weeknight dinner. Based on other reviews, I added dried oregano, parsley and basil to the bread crumbs for more flavor. The chicken was nice and juicy!

Want to make this recipe even easier and quicker?  Use the Panko breaded “uncooked” frozen chicken tenders from Tyson!  I cooked the chicken fully as directed and then threw it in the oven again for 20 minutes with the sauce, pesto, and cheese.  So easy and totally delicious!!!!! Restaurant quality.

This turned out beautifully! For the sauce- since I already had it on hand, I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes w/ green chiles, and just picked the chili pieces out. It didn't take long at all, and later I omitted the red chili pepper flakes. To that I added 4 minced cloves of garlic, on med-high heat, crushing it all down and then reducing the heat to add a can of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce. It's very important to not over-fry the chicken. I accidentally filleted (and then pounded) my chicken a little too thin, so I only needed about a minute or 1:15 on each side, and then 15 minutes in the oven. Only thing I would change next time: to let the it cool after baking, I would place it on a rack or on paper towels instead of letting it sit in the baking dish, because some of the residual frying oil saturated the bottoms and impacted the wonderful crunchiness of the panko.

This was OUTSTANDING!! I will be making this again for sure! Beautifully crispy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside! I used Basil in the tube in place of fresh basil. My husband is extremely picky and finished his dinner in less than 5 minutes!

Very good. Had to sub some ingredients simply because I didn't have them on hand. Used Italian bread crumbs and dry parsley. Also didn't use provolone as I didn't have on hand either. Used my homemade sauce.

I followed the recipe as is. In the future, I may add a little more seasoning as the tips suggested; otherwise it was delicious I covered it with aluminum,  and it wasn't dry!

I made it exactly as described in the recipe using pesto in place of fresh basil. It turned out delicious. We served it over pasta and had to add a  bit more sauce to our fettuccine. Will definitely make this again.

it is SO good! We actually had to use bow tie pasta for this when we made it so when the chicken was almost done we mixed the cooked pasta with pasta sauce then put it in a casserole dish with a layer of cheese and then put the chicken on top with sauce and more cheese. it turned out amazing!

Chef John does it again!!  I made this for the family last night.  What a hit!  I changed nothing; there was no need to.  I served it over spiraled sautéed zucchini for my husband and I and over spaghetti for our picky teen.  The only problem was there were no left overs for my lunch today.  Next time, I'll make extra!

Delish!  Made it tonight, and got rave reviews!  Definitely a keeper.  To save on fat and calories, I only used a couple of TBSPs of olive oil instead of a cup and reduced fat cheeses, but still full of flavor.

I make a recipe from All Recioes almost every week day, but this is the first one that I’ve taken the time to review... I had to review it because it was SO GOOD!! I think this isn’t family’s new favorite meal. The only change I made was to us chicken tenderloins instead of breasts. The chicken was so tender and absolutely delicious! Served over angel hair pasta, with a salad on the side.

Tender, juicy chicken with a nice crispy crust.  Delicious.  I like the minimalist sauce/ cheese idea.  The chicken parm that we would  get from the local pizzeria is swimming in sauce and although tasty is soggy.  Will be making it this way again.

I changed a couple of the cheeses (because I didn't have the recommended cheeses in the house) but it turned out amazing! Will be making it again for our family Sunday dinner today with everything as written. Can't wait for the accolades....It should be amazing!!!

I made this for dinner last night and both hubby and I loved it. It was tender and juicy on the inside and crunchy with some spice on the outside. I served it with a side of pasta in the same red sauce and a salad, and it was one of the best meals I've cooked in awhile. We will definitely be having this again.  

I had 3 small changes: 1) I did not have fresh basil so I used Italian seasoning instead and it was fine. 2) I used an arrabbiata sauce to make it more spicy instead of the red pepper flakes mentioned in the video. 3) I used only half of the olive oil it called for and the frying part worked just fine.  I also used only reduced-fat cheeses to lower the fat content a little.

Delicious. I used thin sliced chicken breasts and less olive oil for frying. Also didn’t have fresh basil so sprinkled dried basil on top.

This was so good, but I did change things a bit. To make things easier forget  the milk, eggs and flour and just dip the pounded pieces of chicken in Ranch Dressing then in the bread crumbs panko mixture and fry in a few tablespoons of oil.

Made this dish for Sunday supper only changes I made was to use prepared pasta sauce  (I didn't think I would like the strong taste of tomato sauce) and more cheese (I always use more cheese).   Doubled the recipe so I took the leftovers to work the next day and everyone raved about the dish and asked for the recipe.  I almost always find Chef John's dishes worth trying.

Tastes great as written. I didn't have egg and flour, so I brushed the chicken with sour cream instead to get the breadcrumbs to stick. Worked like a charm. My husband loves Chicken Parmesan, and he have this recipe two thumbs up. I will definitely make this one again!

Great recipe. I added oregano and garlic seasoning in addition to salt and pepper to the chicken. Also added a dash or salt and pepper to the beaten eggs. Yes, use a good marinara sauce, if you’re not making your own. Eat good!!

If I could give more stars, I would! I am going to have a really difficult time ordering Chicken Parmesan in a restaurant from now on, too! We made it exactly as the recipe states. We also watched the video. In the video, you add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to spice it up. I think we will try that next time as we like spicy, too.  Thank you for the amazing recipe!!

Just be careful frying with olive oil!! It has a really low burning point, which I learned after almost torching our house down. The fry-pan was just a ball of flames, luckily we have a fire extinguisher and I was able to get it onto the back deck and douse the fire. Next time I'll use vegetable oil. :(  Update: FWIW, after the fire fiasco, I just baked the chicken 5 mins per side at 450, then topped it with the cheese/sauce, and baked for another 15, broiled on low for 3, and it was really, really good.

This recipe took me longer to make than I had initially planned, but it was delicious. My 8 year old picky eater told me she loved it when I asked her if she liked it. I did not follow the recipe exactly but took a few tips from others...1) I did not use grated provolone because I could not find any at the grocery store I was at and was not that concerned to travel to another store that would have probably carried. 2) I used some of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the pan not oil when baking. 3) I used 1/2 cup of panko and 1/2 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. 4) I covered with foil and baked without the mozzarella cheese and basil, for 20 min then removed foil added basil and cheese and baked for 10 min. Chicken was delicious and moist served with spaghetti noodles w/ same sauce, salad and garlic bread. Will definitely be making again. I like the suggestion to prepare chicken and freeze to cut down on prep time will have to try that.

I made this for dinner and it was phenomenal.  I did make a couple.of changes.  First, I used 1/2 cup each of seasoned bread crumbs, panko bread crumbs and grated Parmesan cheese.  I also put dried oregano and basil into the flour.  I pan-fried the chicken in a mixture of  garlic oil and butter-probably about 2 Tbsp of each, then into the oven to finish baking.  I served it with a romaine salad, garlic bread and linguini with brown butter sauce.   I will definitely be making this again!

Didn't tenderize the chicken because kids like it thicker.  Was fun to make with my 7 year old and would prob fry it in the oil a little longer due to thickness of chicken breast.  Awesome recipe and unfortunately no leftovers!

I used Prego Roasted Garlic & Herb sauce and added 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes to really spice it up. Also, I substituted Cache Valley Creamery shredded six-cheese Italian blend in place of the individual cheeses. I added half the fresh basil to the chicken at the start of baking, then added the remaining half of the basil three minutes before baking was finished. Phenomenal recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

Hands down the best chicken parmesan recipe ever. For those of you that were complaining about the amounts of ingredients, you must have been doing something wrong. Everything was perfect and if something doesn't look exactly right, adjust it a bit. That's why it's called cooking and not following someone's writing blindly and hope for the best. Bottom line, everyone seated at the table (including me) said it was the best chicken parmesan ever, and that's saying something when it comes to a dish that's commonly found on many restaurant menus.

This ended up being very good, but I made a few modifications. I did not pan fry, used shredded mozzarella and baked it for a 10 minutes before putting the sauce and cheese on. I accompanied it with fettuccine Alfredo. My husband said this is one of the best meals I’ve ever made! I did sprinkle basil on before baking and I loved the flavor it gave the chicken.

Key to recipe is not to overdue the sauce.  Too much gets  soggy.  Too little gets dry.  Leave border of chicken around sauce.  Also, pounding chicken down thin to recipe ensures even cooking and sauce and cheese staying on chicken and not overflowing.  Some other recipes pan fry the breaded chicken before the final oven bake with sauce and cheese.  This can work also to reduce soggy sauce and maintain crisp crunch.

It was very delicious, I seasoned my chicken with garlic and onion powder, Italian seasoning and salt and pepper. And I substituted provolone cheese with Asiago cheese which gave the chicken a very distinct taste. All the other directions I followed directly from the recipe.

Get sandwich slices from deli of mozzarella and provolone cheeses, easier than cubing blocked. Sprinkle basil. Garlic Panko for a little extra flavor. Green grapes compliment taste well. Family loves it, my picky two year old ate it up.

We loved this. 
The easy change we did was 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 Panko. Also, I did 2T of butter and 2T of olive oil (instead of 1Cup of olive oil). 

Turned out perfect:))

AMAZING chicken parm recipe. I went my whole life thinking I didn't really care fro Chicken parm until I tried this one. The fresh mozz is really the key here. I starting use spicy marinara with this recipe as I think it steps it up even further.

Chef John's recipes are always great and this chicken Parmesan is awesome.   I follow the recipe, but use Kroger's shredded cheese, and skip the fresh basil because I never have those things on hand.  The chicken is always tender, juicy, and cheesy.    I serve it with a side of spaghetti and a little sauce.

I made this for my family and they loved it! I should mention that we are a family with Celiac disease so I substituted gluten free all-purpose flour and panko crumbs forThe chicken was so moist and delicious! Honestly, the only thing I would change would be to add a little more marinara. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this an d it was very delicious.  I cut the recipe in half because I made two instead of four, but it worked out just fine.

The only difference is that I still dredged the chicken a little because just dusting the top did not give enough cover.

I also beat the egg in a blender which seemed to made it lighter somehow.  This was for sure a hit at our house!

This is identical to the recipe I've been making for 15 years, except for the provolone. It's a family favorite, everyone raves about it! (I make my own simple sauce: San Marazano tomatoes, basil, s&p, 1/2 onion, garlic, EVOO).

It's an expensive, time consuming, and messy meal to make but it's worth every penny, every minute, and every dirty dish.  My family loves it.  I make it for them, dinner parties, company, and when I'm part of a Meal Train because it is always a hit.  Absolutely delicious!

I had large chicken breasts so I opted to add a little more tomato sauce and cheese which was a good choice. I also fried it a little longer to ensure it would be properly cooked. Very tasty.

I have made several versions of Chicken Parmasean over the years, sometimes following a recipe, sometimes not.
This is the first time I used Panko Bread Crumbs.  I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have fresh basil so I used the dried.  The chicken and the taste was amazing.  I have found a new recipe and I will not deviate from it !!  Amazing!!!!!

This was really tasty! I seasoned with Mrs Dash garlic & herb no salt seasoning, reduced all the cheeses by half because I am on a low sodium diet, made my own sauce which I think makes a huge difference, used way less oil as well for frying.

This is FANTASTIC. The marinara sauce, however, could make or break this dish, so try it with CJ's tomato sauce recipe. Outstanding, and super easy!

I really wanted to like this since it had such a high rating, but it fell short. I’ve prepared chicken similarly many times before for chicken katsu and was curious to see how adding the other ingredients would taste altogether...and although it wasn’t horrible, I’ll definitely never be eating again.

Very tasty and moist chicken.  I subsituted seasoned bread crumbs for panko crumbs.  Would definitely make this again.  Served with broccoli and bread instead of pasta.

This is absolutely delicious!! I read reviews first and I agree you only need a small amount of oil, (not a cup). I did not have cubed mozzarella, so used shredded and it is yummy.

Absolutely delicious. I didn’t have fresh basil or mozzarella AND my oven cooks too hot!  It was still great. I am a new cook. Usually my husband says, “it was fine” when I do.  Tonight he raved “how delicious !”

I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing is that I didn't fry it in a cup of oil, only enough to brown on both sides before putting it in the oven. It was excellent. I will be making this again very soon.

This chicken parmesan was phenomenal! I used soft bread crumbs rather than panko and added parsley, parmesan and basil to it. Also, I browned the chicken in butter instead of olive oil but my whole family agreed it was better than what you get in most Italian restaurants.

Excellent! I had to improvise slightly on the cheese but the recipe still turned out great and the extra servings (I am a single dude) made for excellent leftovers.

GREAT DISH Prepared as written except added italian seasoning to tomato sauce & used a 12 in cast iron skillet to brown.  These were very large breasts.   Could only fit 2 at a time in the skillet.

This was a good recipe and we loved it in our home! I did it exactly like the recipe stated and it came out really good. I was surprised! I will definitely be making this again, it was really flavorful! The only thing I changed a little is the grated Provolone, I just used sliced Provolone and put it on top! It was still really good!

This is an unbelievably delicious chicken Parmesan ......easy to prep & bake.  The pounding of the chicken breasts is super-important for tenderness.  I used fresh mozzarella & basil & added some red pepper flakes for a bit more zip.  This can be totally prepared ahead & then baked before serving.  Thank you....... this recipe is a big keeper!

Made it for 15 people,  used some tenderloins and chicken breast already sliced. Still pounding of the meat first. Added the parmesan cheese and grated romano in the panko. Added pesto instead of the basil. So good!! I will definitely make this again.

I will definitely make it again. Some changes I made were placing the fresh basil on top of the sauce then thin sliced mozzarella, and then thick mozzarella. I also seasoned the chicken with more than just salt and pepper. Great recipe!

I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I crushed saltine crackers.  I added some Italian spices and parmesan to the bread crumbs.  I only put enough olive oil in the pan so that I could brown the chicken . . . .   probably a few tablespoons of oil.  I was not wanting so rich a dinner so I did not add the tomato and cheese ingredients in steps 7 and 8.  The chicken was delicious.

This is a great dish for company.  The end result has a fairly crispy outside and is juicy and delicious inside.  I cooked on a slitted roasting pan so the bread crumbs could get crisp (instead of mushy from sitting in the chicken juice).  Added Italian seasoning an put the fresh basil on at the end so it wouldn't burn.  The amount of bread crumbs is excessive - you likely only need half of what is called for; you do need the full 1 cup of olive oil for browning.  I omitted the provolone cheese.  The recipe is a bit labor intensive, but turns out very tasty. I used 5 full skinless chicken breasts.

Came out great. I used chicken breast cutlets instead so they would all be the same thickness. I didn’t want to pound them out. Will definitely make again!

I don't know where to post questions other than reviews. Can you make this without egg like using milk instead? We have an egg allergy in the house but this recipe sounds good, better than other chicken parms I've tried.

I skipped the flour part and didn't use Provolone, just parm. Now I don't know if it's due to the oven being too hot or it was in there too long - I did 15 minutes instead of 20, thankfully - but I found it dried out the chicken and the tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese were non-existent! Mine did NOT come out looking like it does in photos! IF I were to make again, I'd put the oven lower - maybe 400. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad but as I mentioned, a tad dry.

Turned out great! I didn't have fresh basil, used dried basil, didn't have provolone either AND I forgot to salt & pepper the chicken & it still tasted amazing!

Pretty solid recipe.  I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan and a little less oil and panko.  I definitely recommend using a great sauce or it will be a little bland.  Good combo of moisture and crunch

This was okay. I think seasoning the sauce would have made it better. The chicken was crispy and juicy; might make it again.

Outstanding recipe. I had to modify a couple of things. I used Fontina cheese because that's what I had and I had to use all dried herbs because I did not have any fresh on hand. Mine turned out just like the chefs photos and it was delicious. I got rave reviews and a request to make it again soon!

This recipe gets rave comments from my guests.  Even my picky grandchildren like it.  I split the breasts to reduce the thickness.  Love the panko but use about half what is recommended.

A fave.  I just use shredded mozzarella and parm since I regularly have it in the fridge.  I also use Newman's marinara sauce.  Quick and easy!

I made this and it was everything that we were expecting. It is as good as it looks. I substituted and made 1 cup panko and one cup mozzarella and asiago cheese mixed together with parmesan for the breading and it was sensational.
I am thrilled with this recipe. 
This is my first attempt at chicken parmesan, ever and my family loved it!
I would add a pic but I can't seem to figure out how to do that.

I loved it. I’m not a great cook and usually my first effort on a new recipe is hit or miss, but this turned out great on the first try. My wife says she doesn’t really like chicken parmigiana, but she liked this. She is even taking some of the leftovers to work tomorrow for lunch. I didn’t get fresh basil, so I just used a little dried basil leaves, other than that followed to a tee.

I make this recipe all the time for my boyfriend and I and we can't get enough of it! The first time I made this I copied the recipe to a T and it was sooooo delicious! I now make very minor changes, though it's great the way it is in the recipe .

* I now add more mozzarella cheese and fresh basil and it's even more tasty

*Do not skimp out and use cheap/bland sauce. You will be disappointed. I buy extra sauce because I always top the chicken parm over pasta 

*Do not prep as much bread crumb mixture as suggested. I had a lot left over and had to throw it out. You can always make more if you need more, but you can't really save what was unused

Absolutely fabulous.  Even my 5 year old loved it and to get her to eat anything other than chicken nuggets is a triumph in itself.  I actually and her help me make it, and while some things (like handling the raw chicken) I didn’t let her do, the recipe was easy enough that it wasn’t hard for her to help. This recipe is going in my success pile.

Excellent. Used common sense regarding the amount of oil and bread crumbs needed - but very good!  A little spaghetti and bread and BOOM !!!

I’m sort of new to cooking and this recipe was easy and delicious! I did make a few changes to the receipe because I love FLAVOR. I used garlic infused olive oil. Based on other reviews I used half seasoned panko bread crumbs and half plain. I seasoned my chicken with salt, garlic pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. Instead of using mozzerella and provolone I used an Italian cheese blend from Kraft (the blend contained both). I still used grated parmesan. I cooked 4 servings and I didn’t need 4 cups of bread crumbs. 2-3 would’ve been enough. Lastly, i sprinkled an Italian seasoning mix on top of the cheese before placing it in the oven. My husband is a picky eater but HE LOVED IT!

This was very tasty.  I took the advice of one reviewer and skipped the flour/egg steps and just brushed on heavy whipping cream and dipped in Panko/parmesan mixture.  It still had a nice crunchy coating.  Also, it is listed to use 1 cup of olive oil, which seemed excessive to me.  I used about a 1/4 cup and I actually made 6 large chicken breasts.  I used a homemade marinara sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  It was delicious and I will definitely make again.

I bought thin breasts, used less provolone and less oil for frying. I also chopped the basil and made sure the chicken was seasoned before I started the coating processed. It was great!

Made this and it was perfect!

I salted chicken and I used panko and parm cheese as directed.  Cooked on both sides in oil for 2 mins each as directed.

I used canned spaghetti sauce and I added lots of mozzarella, a slice of provolone and a ton of parm cheese (I love cheese).

It did not come out bland or soggy.

My kids LOVED it and told me it was just like eating at East Side Marios lol.

I paired it with a simple spaghetti with garlic butter sauce.

Good recipe and I will use it again.  Only change I made was to add some Italian Seasoning to the flour and breadcrumbs.  Tomato and Basil sauce from a jar was easy and worked great.

Well, I am starting to follow this particular chef, as he usually gives helpful tips, speaks clearly, at a moderate pace and doesn't go overboard on ingredients, and the end result is delicious.

As I only like to cook when I have lots of time it takes a little longer for the final product, but definitely worth the effort.

I would certainly prepare this again as my family gave it two thumbs up!  I don't usually review dishes but had to this time.

I've always loved Chicken Parmesan and this is the best recipe yet for this dish.  I see the mistake I had made was adding too much sauce and cheese.  If you love this dish you'll love it more using this method.

This was very easy to make and absolutely delicious!!  I didn't have provolone cheese so didn't include it,  and used store bought tomato basil sauce....it tasted great.  Chef John is right when he says that sometimes the recipe is ruined when there is too much sauce.  This has just the right amount to keep the flavors balanced.  Highly recommend.

Delicious! I quit ordering Chicken Parmesan at restaurants because I always ended up being disappointed. I decided to make it myself and this recipe is great! I actually used half Panko crumbs and half crushed Italian croutons for the crust and made homemade sauce (tomato sauce with sauteed minced garlic, basil, oregano, salt, pepper and thyme). I served it over angel hair pasta. My family loved it!

I bought "thin cut" chicken breasts so I did not have to pound them thin. They worked out perfectly. I would also recommend you start checking the chicken after 10 minutes in the oven. Depending on your oven you may not need the full suggested cooking time for the chicken to be done.

This is the best chicken parm I've ever made.  I used regular bread crumbs instead of Panko, and I only used mozzarella...no provolone.   Absolutely delicious!!  Will make again and again.  Restaurant quality!!

I know Chef John is the king of cooking so I make it with just a couple small changes. Number one, a little less Olive oil and careful patting of the browned breaded chicken breast with a paper towel. Otherwise I feel like I can taste the oil. Two, more sauce. BUT, I always cook it to completion with just the sauce in the recipe and add some of my own upon serving. Make sure you are using chicken breasts of about 3/4 pounds each and 20 min is perfect. If smaller or thinner cut the time down. This is the best chicken parmesan I have ever had!

The recipe turned out fabulous.  Followed directions but used parmigiana spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I will definitely make this again.  My husband loved it.

Family and friends raved about this dish!!!!!!

One problem :
I made this recipe twice and find the 4 cups of Panko crumbs is a waste of money. I end up  throwing more than  half away. 
2 or 2 1/2 cups is plenty for my taste.

This recipe was awesome. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I didn't have provolone cheese but I substituted sliced havarti cheese instead.  this was pretty quick to make. Served with pasta and remaining tomato sauce.

Only used 2 cups of panko breading and even that was too much for 4 large flattened chicken breasts. Could have probably covered 4 more with this. Recipe called for 4 cups. Also didn't cook it at 450. It seemed a little too hot.

Great recipe, fundamentally!  As always, I looked over several of the reviews, and RebeccaD was "dead on!" You shouldn't need the amount of breadcrumbs called for, and I wouldn't use the amount of olive oil called for (too much), and you will need more sauce than is listed in the ingredients list (it doesn't match up with the cooking instructions). So, there are some quantity errors... no biggie. We've figured that out and this is a darned good recipe! Keeper!

This was the most delicious Chicken Parmesan I've ever eaten! Luckily, we had leftovers for a couple of days. I made as directed (except didn't need as much bread crumbs or olive oil). Next time, I will probably add some spaghetti sauce, because there wasn't enough sauce on the noodles; but overall, amazing!!!

Excellent chicken parm recipe.  Each time I make it I get wonderful reviews.  I pretty much followed the recipe BUT did not need all the  Panko recipe called for.  I started with 2 cups and threw a fair bit out.  Also, I used mozzarella instead of provolone cheese.

This was an excellent recipe.  I used home grown basil from my herb garden.  The chicken was tender.  The only change I made was to put the flour in a plastic bag to coat the chicken.  The rest of the recipe I followed.

I used boneless thighs since that is what I had on hand.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  I only needed about 2 cups of bread crumbs to coat 6 thighs.  Cooking time was spot on (since thighs without bone are about the same thickness as flattened breasts.  I didn't bother to measure the cheeses.

I would decrease the amount of bread crumbs used for the recipe.  I made up 8 breasts and followed the recipe (other than the amount of bread crumbs) and it turned out excellent.

Another amazing recipe from Chef John! I have made this so many times & all 7 of us love it, it's one of our favorites. I omit the provolone just because of personal preference.

Great recipe, however I made a few changes.. I had time so I marinated the chicken with Italian herbs. I dipped the chicken in ranch dressing instead of egg as I've found it to be more flavorful. I used Italian panko bread crumbs and only used maybe 2 tbsp of olive oil for frying. I had fresh parsley on hand so sprinkled that on the chicken and cheese. This recipe will work with vodka sauce and leftovers are even better the next day!

These turned out great.  I did follow some of the other suggestions to use about 1 cup of breadcrumbs (I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs), mixed with 1/4 cup of grated mixed cheese.  I also only used about 2 tbsp of olive oil to brown the chicken in the skillet.  I too skipped the flour.  I used a whole jar of prepared pasta sauce.  Was extremely tasty, even thought I forgot/didn't have a available the basil.  Will definitely add that next time, during last few minutes of oven baking.

This is delicious. 

I made six chicken breasts so I could have lunch throughout the week. They're just as good as cold leftovers as they are out of the oven.

I will definitely make these again.

This had an excellent flavor.  I used a marinaro sauce instead of just tomato sauce.

My husband and I loved it! It's not something I would cook every week but nice for a change. Only cooking 2 chicken breast, cut back on crumbs and definitely cut back on the oil for frying them, It left that after taste and forget about drizzling oil over it. I also used sweet basil Mariana and served this on a bed off egg noodles. Other than, I would definitely make it again

My family loved it! Amazing! I agree with others here - you don't need as many breadcrumbs as it calls for; maybe half that much. I replaced the provolone with additional parmesan (it's what I had on hand). I also made some that was gluten-free and keto-friendly by replacing the breadcrumbs with half ground pork rinds and half almond flour, and omitting the flour. OMG SO GOOOOOOOOOD!

Loved the panko and Parmesan cheese combo. I only used two chicken breasts (split one) and used one cup panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and that was plenty.  I also fried the chicken 5-6 mins per side and then sprinkled with shredded mozzarella, covered fry pan until that melted and served with a side of spaghetti and marinara. My preference is to not cover the crispy fried chicken with marinara and make it soggy.  The result was a wonderful, crispy Chicken Parmesan!

This was fairly easy to make, and it was SO delicious! I used chicken thighs in place of chicken breasts, which guaranteed very tender results.  My kids can be picky eaters, but I cut the chicken up, and served it with pasta wheels to make it more fun. They loved it! I was so surprised and happy to be able to share this meal with my kids! Will be making this again and again!

This was amazing. I cut my chicken breasts in half to make thinner fillets instead of pounding them. Worked out great.

Loved this!!! Made some tweaks based on reading reviews. I didn't need nearly as many breadcrumbs as what was called out, I probably used 1 cup at most. I also added salt, oregano, parsley, thyme, cilantro, and sage to both the Panko mix and the tomato sauce. It turned out fantastic, and I kept the extra sauce so anyone could add more to it if they wanted more on their chicken. The chicken turned out SO juicy and crispy. Awesome!

Very good, didn't change a thing.  However, the chicken breasts I used were too large and too filling with the richness of the other ingredients. Recommend finding small chicken breast and using them.

Excellent . Chef John is one of the best . I have made this a dozen times and it doesn't disappoint  . The only change I make is that I use  regular bread crumbs that are spiced . Hope this helps . Oh ya I always serve it with a basic tomato spaghetti pasta . Delicious!

Made the recipe last night and it came out fantastic! Our family are not fans of red sauce, so I placed slices of plum/roma tomatoes on the cutlets before putting on the cheese. This made for crispy, juicy, cheese chicken goodness!  The chicken came out tender and flavorful, thanks to the breading technique of the recipe. This one goes in the recipe box!

This is delicious and a crowd pleaser.  The combination of cheeses made for a yummy Chicken Parmesan!  The only changes I made:  I didn't pound the breasts and I substituted Trader Joe's Bruschetta  for the tomato sauce.

We like ours spicy, so I start out with sautéd crushed garlic before adding chicken to the hot olive oil.  Being a big Tuscan style Italian fan, I prepare the tomato sauce with garlic, red peppers, thyme and oregano prior to adding to the chicken.

I added Italian seasoning and pepper to the Panko bread crumbs. I had quite a bit of bread crumbs left over.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. These came out really good. I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks Chef John!

Did tweek recipe a bit. Used 5 bagged frozen chicken breasts thawed (they run smaller and are already flattened which saved time), garlic salt, only 1 cup of Italian seasoned breadcrumbs was necessary to bread this those 5 pieces.  In place of the tomato sauce and fresh basil, used the entire jar of Bertolli tomato & basil 24 oz sauce, shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan, no provolone available so it was omitted. Roasted some asparagus during the last 15 min of baking and served with the chicken over angel hair.  (Note-Would probably have needed more breadcrumbs as well as sauce if fresh chicken breasts were used).   The whole meal was prepared and ready in under an hour!

Against my better judgment, I used 4 cups of bread crumbs like the recipe called for.  What a complete waste!  half of the mixture ended up in the trash.  I'll give this guy the benefit of the doubt and assume that 4 cups was a typo.  2 cups is all you really need.  I also seasoned my breadcrumbs with granulated garlic and oregano.  Turned out great!

I really like how this turned out. The family liked it as well. I used seasoned bread crumbs and also seasoned/marinated my chicken breast in low sod. broth, thyme, and Natures Seasoning.  I did not have olive oil so used canola. Used store bought marinara sauce as well. Served with whole wheat pasta. Very tasty!

I followed this recipe except I didn't have fresh basil so I used the paste from a tube sparingly and I mixed tomato sauce with salsa so it was a bit more zippy.  When it says to not use too much cheese, do that.  The best part was the crunchy coating, which was not crunchy under the cheese, obviously.  My husband and I loved it.

I do a gluten free, GF, version by using GF flour and GF Italian bread crumbs.  This is a very good recipe that we will be adding to our regular rotation.

We loved this recipe and will definitely make it again!  I normally don't rate recipes unless I make them as written but with this one I didn't have any tomato sauce on hand so I used Italian pasta sauce.  I'm sure the recipe would be just as good with tomato sauce as written.

I fried the chicken a little longer and I baked @ 350 for 30 minutes.  I used a small jar of Ragu chunky garden sauce and really needed a large jar, I made spaghetti to go with it so I needed a bit more sauce.   This is the best recipe for chicken Parmesan I have found.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.

Made just as recipe calls for except I add more sauce over the chicken before putting in the oven. We like to have more to put over  the angel hair pasta. I have made numerous times and my son in law asked for it for his birthday meal.

I suggest using the recipe as a guideline and not a dictum.  Going into the oven now, looks good.

Came out well.  Tender chicken, good mix of cheeses, nice flavour.

This recipe turned out great, even though my first time making it I was pressed for time and juggling multiple things. I made a couple of adjustments on the fly, such as when I discovered I was out of provolone, and using arrowroot flour with no breadcrumbs for one gluten-free serving. I will definitely make this again!

Followed the instruction in all steps except that I used normal bread crumbs instead of the one on the recipe and also used mozzarella and Parmesan only and it turned out great. so tasty, my husband loved it. little bit crunchy on the outside while moist and tender inside.
If you don't want it super crunchy, you can fry it for one min on each side instead of the 2 min mentioned in the video.
Thank you Chef John.

Loved the crispy crunch, the flavors, and the presentation.  When the family heard that I was changing from my usual recipe they were all questioning why, but every single one preferred this version.

I loved it!  It is time consuming to make...just a fair warning. I gave it 4 stars because 1) I attempted to double the recipe because I have a large family and 8 cups of bread crumbs seemed like an awful lot. I cut back a little and then tried to figure out how much to use of the remaining ingredients and got all mixed up. 2) Tomato sauce...even a high end brand, didn't give it the flavor it deserved over pasta. It was dry because I didn't want to over do it with the tomato sauce and wreck the chicken. I would definitely make it again with a different sauce.

I made this using Italian seasoned breadcrumbs and it turned out really well. This was my first time making Chicken Parmesan, it was a lot of work but was totally worth it. My mom and brother both loved it as well.

Made two breast halves, two thighs.  Only change was used only 2 cups of bread crumbs and still had more than needed.  Delicious and will be making again.

The measurements were all off. Too much bread crumbs, too much frying oil, not enough tomato sauce and perhaps my chicken breasts were too voluptuous because they were massive by the time I flattened them out .  After eyeballing the correct measurements, this is a very nice recipe. I'm never going back to frozen chicken patties. This is way easier to make than I imagined.

This is much better than restaurant chicken parm. It's our favorite recipe that we've ever found online. We now search Chef John recipes on here for most meals.

We've adjusted the recipe to make it gluten-free only by using gluten-free bread crumbs, but no one ever notices the difference. It's still delicious, and the leftovers might be even better. This also freezes very well.

If you want to save time or make it a little less labor-intensive and messy, we do the following:
1. Buy chicken breasts that have already been pre-sliced (so one normal chicken breast becomes 3 or 4; look for "thin chicken breast at the supermarket.) It saves the mess of having to hammer them flat.
2. We normally skip the part of adding flour (instead just put the chicken directly into the eggs and then the bread crumbs). If you try this, too, let the chicken sit longer than the recipe suggests for the bread crumbs to stick (more like 20-30 minutes than 15).
3. We use shredded mozzarella instead of the cubed fresh mozzarella suggested.

Also, quick tip: keep in mind that you're only cooking the chicken in the oil for the bread crumbs, so watch them closely (it's easy for them to get a little burnt; made that mistake the first few times).

Thanks, Chef John. This is our favorite meal and always a great pick-me-up.

I made this recipe using the ingredients listed. It was delicious. The only thing I would do differently next time is cut down on the Panko crumbs. I had a lot left over that ended up in the trash. I think 2 cups would have been enough. Other than that, it was delicious! I will definitely make this again!

I thought this recipe was fantastic. I changed a few things out of necessity. I don't keep fresh herbs or mozzarella, so I used dry and store bought mozzarella. I didn't have the provolone so I substituted Gouda. I do not like panko crumbs so I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. But the technique was great and the results were too.

My family loved this dish, I served it without the pasta, added store bought sauce and served it with a fresh French roll as a sandwich, it was really good. I also panned fried mine for a few minutes before putting it into the oven.  Great recipe!

We make this at least twice a month in my house. To add more flavor I use half panko and half italian style breadcrumbs.  I also use dried basil as opposed to fresh and it's still great.

Very good. Only dinged it one star because the recipe called for preheating the oven before starting to make it and the prep time before it went in the oven was very long. Shouldn't preheat the oven till after frying the coated breasts.

This is a great recipe, I use thinly slice chicken breast because I did not have a chicken pounder to pound the chicken breast the thinly slice worked perfectly, with the sauce I added dice tomatoes to it I use vegetable oil to fry the chicken breast I did not have olive oil.  Other than that I follow the recipe and both my husband and I loved it, this will definitely go in my cooking rotation l, thank you for sharing a great recipe.

Best ever Chicken Parm. recipe!!! I am a native New Yorker currently living in Minneapolis MN. This recipe brought me back home to my roots! Chef John's suggestion regarding the amount of sauce and where to place it was instrumental in allowing the chicken to be the star in this recipe versus drowning it in sauce. Perfect amount of cheeses and the Panko Bread Crumbs were perfect for breading the chicken. Can not say enough good things about this recipe! Loved it!

Excellent!!!!  and everyone enjoyed even my fussy grandchild. 
But I have one concern I find the 4 cups of Panko is a bit of a waste. I have to throw a lot out. Especially when I double the recipe and freeze the chicken. It is greater straight from the oven but also great from the frozen state. Secret thaw in fridge overnight and less time in oven for warmup.  
That avoids drying out the chicken.  I usually cover to warm up then uncover for the last 5 minutes. . Warm up at 350 for about 20 minutes

Very ez pz to make. I didn't change anything other than make my own tomato sauce. Very easy to do. 28oz can of crushed tomatoes. Heat up a bit of oil in the pan, fry up some garlic for about 45 seconds, dump in that can of tomatoes and season with salt pepper and Italian seasoning. I also add a few fresh basil leaves. Simmer for about 10 minutes reducing heat to almost low about halfway thru. Very yummy chicken parm

I've made a version of this before, but for some reason decided to try this one. Made for my girlfriend on Valentine's day and I'd put this up against any restaurant I've eaten it in.

The bread crumb waste wss ridiculous. Yikes. I could have used 1/2 or 1/3 that amount and I had six breast halves. The recipe was missing flavor but I didn't have the fresh basil on hand so that may have made the difference. I had to turn the oven down to prevent burning of the cheese and cook the chicken until done. Watch your breasts if you cook at 450 and make the adjustment if needed.

Very good as prepared!  The two things I will do next time are to add more tomato sauce, and I missed the taste of garlic so I will mix some Italian herb seasoning in with the sauce.

The only reason I gave it a four was because I haven't eaten any, but it smells FAB U LOUS!

I am making this for a friend so that she has some meals in the freezer.

I followed the recipe, as best I could, with what I have at home.

Love the way to do the flour, that was awesome, used home dried oregano from my garden, didn't use quite as much parmesan because I didn't have enough.  Used home grown tomatoes, that I had frozen, and used an immersion blender to smooth them out.  For cheese, I had mozzarella/provolone blend.  Didn't measure out the flour, or the panko, just eyeballed it.

I can't wait to make this for my family and I have added to my recipe box.

Thank you for the great recipe!

Another wonderful recipe from Chef John. I made a few changes: added salt, pepper, pinch of cayenne to flour; used half seasoned bread crumbs, half Panko; sautéed in a mix of olive oil and butter.  Didn't have Provolone so I used a mix of Parmigiano Reggiano, fresh mozzarella, and 5 Italian cheese mix for the topping. Yum!

I made the receipe with only one change. I could not find fresh basil so I used a premium brand name tomato basil sauce and was very impressed with this dish. it is really surprising how filling this dish is. I got 2 serving per breast since slicing the meat in half before pounding it flat. this was way better than any restaurant I have had. I can't wait until summer to make this dish outside for pool parties. it's easy and fun to make.

This was delicious! A few things were substituted only because I decided to make this dish at the last minute. I used marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce and added a hefty sprinkle of italian seasonings. I also had to use monterey jack cheese instead of provolone and mozzarella. Lastly, I used italian bread crumbs instead of panko. It all turned out great!

I made the dish following the instructions carefully.   I loved the crispy crust but chicken was overdone.  When I make it again, I will make the following changes:
Fry the chicken breasts on medium high for 5 min per side to brown.  When you pound the breasts to 1/2 inch, they don't need to be cooked too long.
Heat the tomato sauce till bubbly.
Do not bake it, put sauce and final cheeses on, remove from heat, cover until cheese is melted.

This was excellent chicken parm! I made a few edits because of what I had on hand: used just mozzarella cheese and some shaved Parmesan. I pan fried the chicken breasts, didn't deep fry. The who,e family raved about it am

First time making chicken parmesan.  The steps were easy to follow and on point.  The flavor was explosive.  Probably one of the best chicken parms I've ever tasted.  Great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly as Chef John stated.  It wasn't the easiest dish in the world, but this was definitely worth the minimal effort.  My family raved about this chicken Parm and begged me to make it again in the future.   Thanks Chef John!

I think it was really good, nice and cheesy, I think the only thing that I would do differently is put a little more seasoning into the breading mixture.

Great recipe for a chicken parmesan beginner.  It was easy and the kids loved it!  I just eyeballed the cheeses and it turned out great.  Served it with Primus Cabernet and garlic bread and it made a terrific meal.  One caveat: my Kroger didn't have plain panko bread crumbs so I got the Italian-spiced version and it seemed a little much.  I can't wait to try this as written with just plain panko.

Turned out pretty good! It's the first time I ever tried doing chicken parmigiana at home. I've customized the recipe with veggies - onion & bell pepper. It just tasted like restaurant made parmigiana ???? Thank you chef john for a wonderful and easy recipe.

Didn't have pants,  used regular bread crumbs.  Still turned out amazing.  Think I would halve the portions though, and serve with salad... Just finished eating,  need a nap!   Excellent recipe.

Easy and excellent! 4 cups of Panko Bread crumbs was too much. 1 1/2 cups of panko and 1/2 cup of parm was perfect!

Juicy crispy and great! I didn't cook with the tomato sauce, just added pasta and sauce and covered when served!

This has to be the best chicken Parmesan recipe that I have found. The chicken tasted wonderful and not a lot of sauce. Some in my family don't like sauce much and this was perfect if a lot of sauce isn't your thing. Great recipe. I changed nothing.

This was just so good, better than at any restaurant! 
I did follow all the directions with the exception that I made my own tomato sauce - it was definitely worth the effort! And I used about 2 - 2 1/2 cups of it. I put some on the bottom of the dish as well as over the chicken. The bread crumbs - 1 1/2 cups is plenty. And I baked it at 400 rather than what was stated,

Made as prepared and it was a tad bland.  Second try, mixed 1/2 planko and 1/2 Italian seasoned bread crumbs for the coating.  Also, cut pounded chicken /breasts into smaller pieces, more manageable.  Let sit after breading for half hour on waxed paper before frying.  Fries up better.  Used sliced provolone instead of shredded.  Also, used more sauce than called for, a whole jar.  I like my sauces....
Will definitely prepare again.

we used Italian seasoned Panko and didn't mix powdered parmesan in with it. instead we put grated Parmesan directly onto each piece immediately out of the frying pan before spreading the sauce on. we used Newman's Own Marina for sauce. it came out amazing.

Like another user suggested, I subbed italian seasoned breadcrumbs (whole wheat in this case) for the panko.  I also added a little butter to the frying oil, and used parsley and a little oregano and marjoram in lieu of basil because it was all we had.  If you don't have a meat mallet, just use a heavy rolling pin (we also found parchment paper works really well over the chicken while you are whacking away at it, if you don't have any heavy plastic on hand).

Chef John never disappoints!  The only thing I did different was the flour - I added a packet of ranch dressing dry mix to the flour and actually patted it on the chicken before the egg mixture.  Someone taught me long ago to make sure every step is well seasoned.  Otherwise, it's bland, right?  Anyway, a great recipe - loved the outcome!

I made this for my a dinner party and everyone raved. I used Emeril's marinara sauce and whole slices of provolone. It was delicious.

I made a few changes. I used Italian bread crumbs rather than panko because it's already seasoned.  I mixed 1/2 of the parmesan and 1/2 of the Italian bread crumbs in equal parts. I don't measure. I fried and baked chicken but I didn't bake the chicken in sauce. (I make my sauce from scratch)
After I pulled my chicken from the oven I immediately sprinkled the chicken with mozzarella. 
I spooned the warm tomatoe sauce over the chicken. I did not want the chicken to be soggy.

the chicken I used I purchased from Aldi's and was already marinated in garlic & herbs.  I made a double batch since there are many steps and its very well worth it...This is a keeper recipe

Chef John, THANK YOU !!!
I just made this tonight.  I prepared 6 halves,  omitted the provolone and extra Parmesan for health needs.  I was out of fresh Basil and a dry Sweet Basil worked great.   I have been trying to make this dish acceptable for 6 YEARS and THIS recipe made it excellent FINALLY.

This was delicious. I'll make it again, but will use less bread crumbs next time. I didn't need nearly as much as the recipe called for.

WOW!  This is restaurant-quality.  I think using two kinds of cheese really added something.

I made it with no changes.  Used my amazing home-made sauce.  :)

One note:  by the time the internal temp of the chicken reached 165 F, the cheese was very dark.  I was worried that it was burned and ruined, but we all agreed we loved it that way

This recipe was as good as, if not better than, most restaurants!  Slightly crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside.  This will definitely be an absolute favourite with my family.

This was awesome. I didn't have the provolone so just omitted it. Used Prego for the prepared tomato sauce and dried basil because I didn't have fresh. I also served this on a bed of spaghetti squash. Absolute keeper and will be making this again.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I didn't use as much bread crumbs as called for.  I followed the rest of instructions as written. The end result was fabulous! Everybody raved about how good it was! This is a definite keeper!

This was fantastic, restaurant quality the first time!  I did deep fry them in peanut oil for 5:30 and also used slices of provolone and mozzarella and dried basil.  I put them on a sub roll with tomatoes and extra sauce, but my son and wife ate them without sub roll or pasta and loved it too!

This recipe was "phenomenal"!! Watching the video chef john has helped explain a lot more because I am a visual learner :) I just tweeked a few things . Instead of shredded prov I subbed out Gouda which added a nice kick. In addition to the bread crumb mix the parm Panko and Italian seasoning are perfect choices ! Surprisingly the chicken was cooked all the way through at 450 degrees in 20 minutes remaining juicy and I had a couple of thick pieces . Chicken was crispy and using fresh mozz helps it cook the correct time as listed without burning . I served it atop butter garlic  angel hair noodles !! Will definitely keep these tips when making chicken parm ! Thnx Chef John !!!

One change I made is putting half the cheese on initially, baking for 10 minutes, and then putting the other half on.  Resulted in more gooey cheese.

Yes, I will make it again. I substituted Angelic Sprouted Wheat bread crumbs. I saved an extra pan by preheating the Corning Ware with olive oil and put the chicken tenderloins in that, then in the oven. I flipped them in about 5 minutes, brushed oil on the other side, cooked 5 more minutes. Then I put the sauce and mozzarella cheese for the remaining 10-15 minutes. I used Aldi's Never Any chicken tenderloins, and their Traditional Reggano sauce.

It was so good, my in-laws and my husband loved it.  They are very conservative eaters, no new recipes allowed. LOL So we ate it as a chicken dish with broccoli on the side, no tomato sauce or spaghetti.

This was wonderful!  I made it for my son for his birthday dinner, and everyone loved it.  I used gluten-free Italian panko bread crumbs and didn't have any fresh basil on hand so I used dried basil instead.  I used some red wine pasta sauce, which made it even better!  If I had to make a change to this recipe, I'd make it saucier, but it was wonderful as is.

This recipe was great, I added a little bit more seasoning to the chicken. I think that 4 cups of bread crumbs are too much, nest time I'll reduce it to 2 cups.

This chicken parmesan is very delicious! It was my first time making chicken parm so I was curious as to how it would turn out. The chicken gets nice and crispy and stays that way while it's baking in the oven which gives it a great crunch. I left mine in the oven a little too long and I didn't use the provolone cheese but I followed the recipe almost exactly otherwise. I definitely recommend it.

The only change we made was to use less oil to cook and different cheese. We used what we had on hand. Agario and another one I can't remember at the moment. It was a family favourite.

Excellent but watch the salt. Maybe my own inexperience but after watching the video and hearing his comment on seasoning I over did it. No big deal and will adjust next time. Could have easily done it on 2c. breadcrumbs. All in all awesome though and will be on my keeper list.

I would give this recipe a 3 ½ overall. Definitely not a 5 star dish. I  liked the flouring  step as it saved a dish but otherwise I didn't find much time saving steps. The ingredient amounts were way off so had to do quite a bit of adjusting and I thought it lacked flavor. The finished dish was okay but couldn't compare with traditional chicken Parmesan.

My family loved this recipe!  Didn't change a thing!  My son
was searching for a great chicken parmesean recipe and he
found this one,  so I made it for him and we all enjoyed it.  We especially like the hint of heat with the crushed red pepper flakes. The video was helpful too.   We will definitely make it again.  It's a keeper! Thank you Chef John.

I made this exactly as the recipe described and it was really delicious -- using my own freshly made tomato sauce.     I agree with the cook's notes that said to use really good tomato sauce.    I feel the key to a good tomato sauce is the type of tomatoes -- I use San Marzano tomatoes (whole) in a 24 oz can and chop them up.

This recipe turned out great, though a few things are worth mentioning. First, what about the PASTA? Chicken Parmesan and pasta go hand in hand, though there was no mention of the latter in this recipe. Second,  the recipe calls for 4 cups of breadcrumbs, which is way more than you need. I only used 2 cups and that was still probably 1 cup too much. Ended up throwing half of it away. Other than that, this was my first attempt at Chicken Parm and it was very delicious!

Tip:  Use small balls fresh mozzarella cheese (often labeled bocconcini) vs. shredded mozzarella.  It melts better, browns better, tastes better.  

Followed recipe exactly - except that I had just made fresh spaghetti sauce from fresh tomatoes (using onions, carrots, etc) so it was more of a "garden" spaghetti sauce, so did not use store bought.  Mine had some crushed red pepper in it so had a lot of zip - I think it complimented this recipe. 

Be SURE to salt/pepper the chicken BEFORE putting in flour -- very important.  It's also an opportunity to use garlic salt or flavored spices instead.

The crust from the panko can't be beat - mine did NOT go soggy in the oven.  I did not smother in sauce - I put the sauce through the middle of the chicken, leaving the ends "exposed" - but made sure the cheese would melt that direction and prevent the ends from over-browning.

If you want the chicken to have a bit more zip - put spices/flavorings into the panko mixture.  One thing I did slightly different is I put the panko crumbs into the remaining flour (used same plate) - so there was a bit of flour - which I think added to the crispiness and helped the panko really stick.

Will use this recipe again - everyone LOVED it!  Would have given it 4.5 stars - but not an option, and only mama's chicken parm gets 5 stars in my book.  :)

My whole family loved this recipe! My husband said it was better than any chicken Parmesan he's had at a restaurant. The only change I made was heating up some extra sauce to go over the noodles with the chicken since it didn't have much extra sauce after baking.

I followed the recipe to the letter and all of my family stated it was the best chicken Parmesan they had ever eaten. Great recipe Chef John.

As an aside, it's important to follow each step precisely as I have made chicken Parmesan many time and it never turned out like this. There are techniques he employs that change everything in my view.

We really enjoyed this chicken parmesan.  I did make a couple changes.  Panko bread crumbs really have no flavor at all, and 4  cups?!?  I used about 2 cups and then added 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Maybe this problem is specific to this cook and his stove, but I heated my oil on only medium heat, and 2 minutes per side gave me much darker than a golden brown crust. Medium high heat would have given me a black crust cooking for 2 mins per side.

This is a great recipe!! My husband is NOT a fan of spaghetti noodles and he absolutely LOVED this when I made it!! So much that he ate it leftover (something he also never does) AND asked for it again already :-)) I earned the nickname"Jama Childs" with this one! Lol Followed the recipe exactly and it came out great both times. Of course, the recipe does not mention the noodle part at all but all I did was cook the noodles about 7-8 minutes for all dente, added some olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking together, and sprinkled some sweet basil over them before adding the chicken on top. Highly recommend this recipe!!

I used all of the ingredients he listed, the only thing that was different was I had prepackaged cheese, not fresh. Still turned out great!

I skip the flour step and use less oil (or butter instead), but this is always a hit. I've made it several times now. I also don't put sauce on when I bake it, so the chicken comes out crisp on the outside (I bake it on a rack to let the bottom coating dry). Thanks for the great recipe!

I love it so much!! Made it just now and currently enjoying this crispy and scrumptious delight! I am a university student currently studying in Japan and this is my first time making such an advanced meal. I was scared to make such dishes because they looked like they were difficult to make but thanks to this dish, I realized it might not be as hard as I thought. Thank you :)

Great and easy recipe to follow.   My husband had asked me to make Chicken Parmesan  ... I have attempted on my own in the past to make this,  but have never been satisfied with the results.    Found this recipe and decided to give it a whirl.  LOVED IT!  Super easy to make - and delicious every time.   Have already made it twice since finding it 2 weeks ago! lol  I highly recommend giving this one a shot!


**Note ** another review said using Fresh Mozzarella was not a good idea - I disagree - I used fresh mozzarella (Sliced - not a round Ball) and it cooks up perfect every time -   browns up a bit - so good!  Also it was stated flour is not needed to coat the chicken - it really does make a difference... the flour adheres to the chicken, allowing the egg to adhere , allowing the dreading to adhere.  So Unless you have a restriction to using it - the minimal amount you need is worth it. :)  Just my two cents :)

This was amazing! I used shredded mozzarella  because that's what I had, and sliced provolone  on top  with the fresh basil and shredded Parmesan below it .  I had left over spaghetti sauce with sausage in it that I used and it came out delicious.

Made this recently and loved it!  My husband and I were debating over who got to take the leftover to lunch the next day!  I followed the recipe just about exactly as written, and I was fortunate to have fresh basil straight from the garden.  I did load up on the mozzarella because I was trying to use up what I bought.  Lately, I've been trying coconut oil so I did end up doing the initial "fry" in it, and it worked wonderfully---very little splatter and good flavor.  I served the finished product over angel hair pasta.  So good!  The only thing I'd possibly change next time is to measure out fewer panko crumbs because I had a lot leftover after the egg/flour/crumb coating process.

My wife made this tonight and it was incredible. The flavors and overall taste were easily restaurant quality (and a very good restaurant at that!).

She did put some sauce in the bottom of the 9x13 pan, as suggested by some other reviewers. It was easily the best chicken Parmesan I've ever had (and I like this dish and have had it numerous times at numerous places).

I made this just the way it stated but I did not beat the chicken. I used plain bread crumbs because I was too lazy to go to the store lol. I did add a zesty lemon seasoning to the bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.  It was great and my husband hates chicken!

This was a fabulous receipe! My favorite Chicken Parm of all time! I used a little less oil, and a little more sauce, but otherwise followed the receipe pretty closely. Oh, and I added fresh basil toward the end of baking. Yum!!!

A very good chicken parm recipe. I like the Panko mixed with grated parmesean and the fresh mozzarella with provolone on top. I will stick with this recipe from now on.

This is a simple and pretty quick to make. I made it per recipe and next time I will make a few modifications. Less panko, I probably used 1 1/2 to 2 cups. My family likes garlic so I will also take some pressed garlic and mix it into the olive oil.

I gave it 4 stars because it's a good recipe but I did make some significant changes... I used Italian flavored bread crumbs (I cut the amount in half and still did not use it all) with added garlic and dried basil (because that's what I had on hand). I also used our favorite spaghetti sauce (garlic, onion and mushroom flavors) I skipped the provolone all together. The Parmesan and breadcrumb coating is delicious. I didn't let the chicken sit for 15 min before frying and I did fry in half butter half olive oil (the butter did turn brown so if you don't like that then skip the butter). Also, I boiled the pasta and added that to the casserole dish before baking the chicken. I heat up the rest of the spaghetti sauce and we added that on top once it was finished in the oven (we like it saucey). Also... I did use fresh mozzarella and it was wonderful!

Chicken parm is my boyfriend's favorite so I decided to make it for him for Father's Day.  He loved it! And even though I'm not a chicken parm fan I enjoyed it as well.   Only changes made were breadcrumbs, I didn't need as much as the recipe called for and I made angel hair pasta.  Put Classico sweet basil as another reviewer suggested on chicken instead of tomato sauce.  In casserole dish I sprayed olive oil, angel hair pasta, sweet basil sauce, then chicken and toppings.  This was so extremely delicious and I think it'll be a staple in our household from here out!

Since I am learning how to cook, I made the chicken parm exactly as per recipe, including the pepper flakes.   It came out just great. My husband also commented on how good it was.  Will definitely be making more recipes from Chef John and this site

it was very delicious....the ingredients called for 4 cups of bread crumbs and I thought that was a lot so I only used 2 along with the 1/4 cup of parmesan and make 9 pieces of chicken instead of 4 and it was way too much bread crumbs....so much waste.

I decided to make this at the last minute, wanting to use up some fresh mozzarella that was in my refrigerator.  I basically followed the recipe as written but substituted tomato sauce with Pomi (Italian) strained tomatoes and added a little extra spice (basil, oregano & seasoned pepper).

I cut each chicken breast in 3-4 pieces, flattened them, sprinkled with flour, salt & pepper, dipped in egg, then panko/breadcrumb/parmesan cheese mixture.  I did need a little extra panko/(home-made) breadcrumb mixture.     After sitting for 10 minutes, I pan fried in oil on med/high making the outside crispy quickly.

Then transferred to oven dish and topped each piece in basil, strained tomatoes, mozzarella + sprinkle of fresh grated parmesan + drizzle of olive oil.

Baked at 400 for 15-20 minutes.  Yum Yum.  Will make again.

My family LOVED this dish! The chicken was so moist and tender we cut it with butter knives. The only thing I adjusted was the sauce. I know its not supposed  to taste like spaghetti sauce but I had to spice it up a little with diced tomatoes and some Italian seasonings. Over all I give this recipe a 4.5

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it turned out perfectly. The inside was tender, and the outside was crispy.  Last night I made it for my girlfriend and two friends, and one of the friends complimented me twice about how tender it was. My girlfriend said she liked it, too, and that says a lot because she has good taste and dislikes poultry that's overcooked and dry. The cumulative five-star rating (as of 06/12/2016) speaks for itself, but I'll add to that and highly recommend trying this dish.

This was dinner tonight and it was EXCELLENT. I would say that this is the best chicken parmesan I have ever had....even from a restaurant.
1. I used basil from a tube because there was no fresh basil.
2. It takes closer to 45 minutes of prep.
3. I will add marinara sauce all the way to the end of the chicken.
This was definitely an A+ recipe.

I made this for 18 people and had to make the breasts the day before, transport the entire dish and finish it on-site. I kept the marinara sauce and finishing cheeses separate as to reduce the chance of overly saucy chicken - EVERYONE loved this! Here are my additions: 
> Brine the breasts. I only had time to brine for three hours, but it really kept them juicy. I added fresh oregano sprigs to the otherwise basic brine.
> Home-made sauce. Hey... if you are going to do it, why not ad an hour to make it truly home-made?
> Fried in lard + shortening (50/50) - WHY haven't I tried this before? Crispy and super flavorful! Did it in a large dutch oven and was able to do two breasts at once. Candy thermometer is a MUST!
Thanks, Chef John, for another great recipe!

Good recipe, only I made it easier on myself by keeping the chicken in the pan (three large breasts), and before moving in to the oven,  topped with a sprinkle of mozzarella first, then sauce, then more mozzarella, then shredded Parmesan.  Once it's out, I sprinkle with grated Parmesan.  Newbies, remember to use an oven mit when removing pan from oven!

User rebeccad has the perfect review for this recipe. You have to use common sense modifications - like putting the fresh basil on when you put in the oven will end up burning the basil. I didn't have a mallet to pound the chicken with, so I just butterflied the breast and they ended up nice and juicy. I didn't use 4 cups of panko because I only have 4 breasts and I didn't need but liked 2.5 cups. I needed more tomato sauce because when I butterflied the chicken it made them twice as large surface area wise. They turned out wonderful tho - a bit hit for dinner that night! Moist chicken, great flavor, and professional presentation.

Oh, this was GOOD!!  After reading the reviews, I added some Italian spices and garlic to the breading and it was excellent!  The only thing I will do different next time is add more of the sauce...

Chef John, you are the truth! We live in Hawai'i and there's no where to get good chix parm, so I decided to attempt to make it at home, and gosh I'm so glad I did! I followed your directions to a T, and it was absolutely magnificent! I also saved a few of your other recipes, and you've never let me down. I've made your honey mustard, ( I'll never buy it again!) your "let the chicken fingers do the walking", mmmm and your chicken nuggets!  I always make something from you on our cheat days! Keep up the tasty work!

Great recipe, delicious, will be making again FOR SURE! Changes I made: used half italian seasoned bread crumbs and half regular bread crumbs, SO GOOD. 3 eggs instead of 2, because I made 6 chicken breasts. Cooked up some angel hair pasta to put the chicken on. Used a pre made spicy tomato sauce (also REALLY good).

 Only changes I will make: had WAY TOO MUCH breadcrumb mixture left over (and I even made 6 chicken breasts). So I will be cutting that in half that next time. OVERALL SO SO GOOD!

Made it as instructed and served with pasta and salad.  Very good; worth the time and effort.  Fresh mozzarella makes all the difference.  Will make this again.

Everyone loved it! I used Japanese style Panko and I served it over spaghetti and marinara sauce. I cut the recipe in half and it made enough to serve four adults.

fried chicken 30 seconds each side and did one piece at time.
Instead of putting olive oil on top, I put it on bottom of baking dish and added maybe 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce on bottom along with EVOO.

Best Chicken Parmesan - EVER!!!!  I made this recipe using Italian Seasoned Panko Bread Crumbs.  Not only was it amazing, it was without reservation the very best Chicken Parmesan I have ever had anywhere, and I made it.  I'm not one to toot my own horn but this recipe was beautifully crafted from start to finish. The recipe itself was well written, had precise steps to follow and lent itself to resizing without any issues at all.  I made it for two using a single large chicken breast that I cut into two generous sized portions.
The texture, finish and flavor were without comparison.  Delicious....

This recipe was sooo easy, and, to quote my hubby, "The best f-ing chicken parm " he's ever had. Normally, I'd serve this with a side of pasta, but this dish held its own without it! The only alteration I made was the amount of cheese and sauce I put on. Dee-LISH!

This is an excellent recipe! Made it almost exactly per the recipe but used a basil marinara sauce  instead of fresh basil. Next time I will add some seasoning to the breadcrumb mixture (Italian seasoning, garlic, etc) just to kick it up a notch but it was delish!

Made this twice, but much better than I remembered from the first time I made it.  The real test for me, when making anything  jn Italian dishes is the review from both of my sons, who have been servers in fine dining Italian restaurants, from where they also bring home food... and it's a five star thumbs up.  I made no changes whatever, and served it over spaghetti with a side of Italian bread.

This is the first time I have ever made "actual" chicken Parmesan! I've baked chicken and thrown pasta sauce over it and called it chicken cacciatore, add some cheese and called it chicken Parmasen ! What I have missed out all these years, I'm embarrassed to say!
Chef John I have to say this is the best chicken parm I have ever eaten!  
I ALWAYS try the allrecipes recipes to the tee! If from there it's not to my satisfaction then the next time, I might add a bit more heat or a bit more of this or that! 
Some of the reviews are so out there it's no longer "the recipe"!! Why do they do this? 
Chef John this was so amazing I wouldn't change a thing! 
I love how you "season the chicken" and not the bread crumbs!! KUDOS

This recipe is mind blowingly delicious! This was my first time making chicken Parmesan and certainly will not be my last. I changed a couple things. I used Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of Panko and did two layers of egg wash/bread crumbs for a thicker crust. I then deep fried instead of baking. I used canned spaghetti sauce (spinach and cheese) and used shredded marble and Romano cheese and had no fresh basil so I just used basil leaves I had in my cupboard. Baked it to melt the cheese and this was amazing!

The absolute best.  I used homemade classic tomato sauce and only spooned a small amount on the chicken to ensure it stayed crispy.  Used the rest with spaghetti.  yummo

This is a great recipe! I make it close to exact, except I add fresh homemade breadcrumbs to the panko crumbs which allows me to coat them repeatedly. Thank you Chef John.

I've made this 4 times now and it's been a hit every time!  The panko breading makes the difference to me and the steps are very easy.  Very important to pound out your chicken breast so that they cook evenly.  Love it!

Easy & delicious! I followed the recipe for the most part & the chicken turned out crispy on the outside & juicy inside! I made a few adjustments based on the reviews...I used Italian spices panko, a bag of Italian cheeses instead of mozzarella & provolone separate, & put the basil on after it came out of the oven instead of before. Easy, fun, & tasty weeknight dinner the kids loved to help with!

This was the absolutely most delicious  Parmesan Chicken recipe I've ever made. The chicken breading was crisp and the chicken was very moist. Be sure to let the chicken sit 15 minutes before browning in the pan and  only brown 2 minutes per side. I also only roasted in the oven for 10 minutes.. I have a commercial grade Thermadore oven and it cooks really quick. I would reccomed checking after 10 minutes to see if done. No one wants tough dried out chicken. I also think adding olive oil before  baking is a great idea. I will make this recipe over and over for years to come.

Its a keeper! I only changed the sauce to a marinara sauce and added basil and Italian seasoning on the breaded chicken. Everyone loved it. I'll be making it again.

I loved it, the key was to go easy on the sauce. I did just under a double recipe and instead of grated provolone, I just sliced a small wheel into strips. I used a lightly smoked Provolones which really stirred up the flavors. Pretty labor intensive but I managed to cook some roasted Asparagus and a pot of pasta to go with it, so the recipe has plenty of opportunities for a pause or for multitasking. Absolutely stunning flavors, I'll make this again.

Excellent recipe! Made as written (reduced the breading-1/2 cup Italian style bread crumbs & 1/2 cup panko) and it was delicious! Chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside. Paired with angel hair pasta and garlic bread. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch!

I used shredded mozzarella.. And sliced provolon.. And grated Parmesan....and less oil cause I didn't have much...turned out great...

I LOVE THIS DISH so much I cook this for my family and I am 13 I do all of the steps and  the chicken is NOT dried out is what usually happens when my nana cooks but i loved it, its so amazing and its now the every M0nday night dinner.
If you want something with the chicken, I suggest make some spaghetti  noodles and put the amount of chicken that you would like on top of the pasta

~Enjoy with love Matia

Chicken Parmesan is my husband's favorite meal at Olive Garden. I wanted to make it at home. My husband said it was better than olive garden. I took the advice of others and added seasonings to crumb mixture and garlic powder to salt pepper mixture on chicken before the flour step. I also need to beat the chicken more. Some of the halves were not at tender as others.

Easy! I fell in love with this with each bite I took! Loved the cheese combo but did add garlic powder to the chicken along with pepper and salt (love garlic) for seasoning. I did cover it though and took the top off the last few minutes which gave it a softer breading and used tomato basil spaghetti sauce. AMAZING!

Tried it with different sauces including Cucina Antica Tuscany Style Pumpkin Pasta Sauce and Cucina Antica La Vodka Sauces; excellent! Also as my husband is gluten intolerant we used gluten free flour and gluten free rice  bread crumbs. We make big trays of this every few weeks and freeze individual portions. Highly recommended!

This was great. First time making it, had provolone and mozzarella cheese slices and fresh parm. Next time I will add a little more tomoto sauce. My boyfriend added quite a bit more parm before I put it in the oven. I used about 1 c of bread crumbs and on the stove top, cooked the chicken in a little bit of Rosemary Olive Oil and veg oil.  We both enjoyed this recipe.

My husband and I loved it!. The only change I made was using only 2 cups of planko (homemade) and 1/4 c of Parmesan for the breading and about 1/4c olive oil in the skillet. I did use a premium pasta sauce.  I'm not a fan of waste  and what I used was enough. I will make it again.

Very flavorful!!!  Used Prego since that's what I had on hand and added garlic powder to the breadcrumb mixture.  Served with bow tie pasta and a salad.

I made this meal using RebeccaD's suggestion and it turned out great and used just enough of everything. For 10 chicken halves I only needed 4 eggs and 2 cups of Panko bread crumbs and 1/2 cup of parmesan was exactly enough to coat the 10 breasts. I skipped the salt, pepper and flour and it turned out fine. I made the Chicken Parmesan with Fettucine noodles and it made for a great dinner.

I kind of messed up making the recipe, but it still came out great. I also cooked everything in one pan (cast iron). The panko crumbs give the chicken a nice crust. My husband appreciated having less sauce and we truly enjoyed the dish--as usual great flavor with Chef John's recipes.
 
I used 2 cups panko bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesean/romano cheese. I chopped fresh basil with garlic and a little olive oil, but realized this was not going to mix up evenly with the panko by hand. So, I tossed the panko into my chopper with the basil/garlic/oil, which yes did turn the crumbs greenish,  but who cares no one's going to see it once it's covered with sauce and cheese.

The recipe is pretty solid. The only thing I would suggest is add more seasoning to the chicken...in the flour or breadcrumbs... I will make this again. 
Also- I'd probably put the sauce on the last minute or two...otherwise the chicken may get a bit soggy on the bottom.  
Chef is awesome! Love his meatballs too!!

YUM!! The only things I changed were that I used Italian bread crumbs instead of Panko (better flavor), made my own sauce and put spaghetti in the bottom of the baking dish with some sauce and chicken on top as directed then baked.

Family loved it.  My only comment, which I can't believe wasn't   mentioned before, is inconsistency in directions. First, 2 cups of panko crumbs is more than enough. I added seasoned crumbs because I didn't have enough plain. Great flavor so I would recommend using 1 cup plain and 1 cup seasoned panko crumbs. Also in the list of ingredients it calls for  1/2 cup prepared tomato sauce but in the directions it states to top each of the four chicken breasts with 1/3 cup. I used the 1/3 cup so used 1 1/3 cups of sauce. 
I definitely will be making this often.

It was decent, especially for those who aren't a big fan of tomato sauce.  However, as others noted, it did come out a little bland.  Next time I'm going to try some additional spices, along with an additional cheese as a top coating (maybe Romano).

I would also note that the prep time is way off.  As an amateur I spent well over an hour, working at a leisurely pace.  Granted I did a little hunting and searching for ingredients, but I doubt I could have finished prep in less than 30 minutes even if rushing wildly.  It took 20 minutes just to unpackage the chicken, cut and trim the fat, and then properly tenderize and spice.

I will make this recipe again in the future, but with some modifications.

This recipe makes me feel like a true chef. My husband raves about the chicken. The method for breading the chicken works so well and I don't have problems with it not sticking.  I make my own bread crumbs with leftover bread and add lots of herbs to the breading and parmesan mix. Superb and every time I have made this it came out perfect. Yum, yum!

I didn't have any panko so I had to use cornmeal. I used all the cheeses for my husband's and I used nondairy cheeses for mine. My husband loved his! Mine was delicious as well. We served ours over spaghetti squash. I would make this weekly & I don't repeat recipes that often. Yum!

Chicken Parm you taste so good!  Don't forget to buy the pasta. It wasn't listed in the ingredients. The other 2/3 of tomato sauce goes over the pasta. I used a fancy tomato sauce because the flavor of the sauce can make or break it.  Peyton Manning would approve. Go Broncos!

This was terrific. Chef John, I love how you make things simple for the home cook. The only things I changed was I used my own spaghetti sauce and added garlic. This can be decreased to two breasts for just you and yours. Kids love this too.

You have the basics here and it's definitely been improved upon. Definitely use Italian bread crumbs with the Panko. I added grated classic Italian Parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella to the breadcrumbs. I seasoned my eggs with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. I definitely did not use that much olive oil. I lessened the time for cooking down to 10 minutes. Make sure you keep an eye on it.

This was an ok basic recipe. Like other reviewers mentioned I ended up with 7 chicken breasts bc I had to cut some in half so they weren't huge. I only used 1 cup  breadcrumbs. Other things I did to give more flavor was add stewed tomatoes to my sauce and black pepper and garlic powder. Also there is no way the bake time is long enough. I had to bake the chicken about 15-20 mins longer than the recipe stated. Also, I didn't follow exactly the amount of sauce I like nothing dry so I used way more sauce on the chicken before putting in oven. Lastly, I didn't follow the amount of Parmesan and mozzarella to be put onto the chicken before putting it in the oven. I just averaged and covered my chicken pieces liberally. Also, used shredded mozzarella bc wouldn't that melt easier and more evenly than cubes? Sure enough it came out great, will make again but with my tweaks.

Delicious recipe, the chicken was tender and delicious.  Only used 1-2 tbsps of olive oil to brown my chicken and it was plenty.

It was a huge hit at a family gathering. I did change the recipe slightly, using gluten free bread crumbs and gluten free flour. It didn't stick quite as well to the chicken breast and it wasn't as crunchy as it could have been, but that's typical with gluten free ingredients.

This was soooo good! My boyfriend said it was the best thing I've ever made. It tasted better than any chicken parm I've ordered in a restaurant. I omitted the provolone cheese, only because I didn't have any. I also used organic chicken, and olive oil that I bought in France. Quality ingredients can make a difference. I'll definitely be cooking this again and again!

This changed my opinion of chicken parm. My butcher sells thin cut chicken breast cutlets, so I use those rather than pounding beast halves. otherwise, I follow the recipe to the letter. Fantastic.

I followed the directions mostly but I added basic seasoning to my bread crumbs other than that I went by the recipe 100% and the results were amazing I made it about 5 months ago and my guests still talk about it, one of the best chicken recipes I've found and I've tried many. Would recommend making this for sure, it's easy for beginners as well. Great dish In general

We loved this recipe.  As far as taste, we agreed that this is  5 star recipe. It was crispier and lighter on the sauce, but plenty rich and balanced both flavor and texture-wise. We will absolutely make this again. 

The recipe itself had a few points that needed clarification. The panko breading made too much, and it's not like you can reuse it once the raw protein comes in contact with it. You could get away with using just 1 cup and just add a pinch more parm to additional panko as needed. That is a common sense alteration, but heads up for those making this style dish for the first time! The second thing I'd have appreciated is the chicken having a weight measurement in the recipe as well since some people may be using tenderloins/frozen/portioning/huge breasts. That said, 1.5 lbs of chicken worked for us!

Fantastic Recipe!!! After reading the reviews the only thing I did not do is flouring the chicken before dipping it in egg. This dish came out so delicious and cheesy. I am sure it was over a thousands calories per plate. The next time I think I will cut down on the cheese. 3 different cheeses  was a little bit for a normal family night dinner, and you could not taste the panko crust on the chicken with that much topping. All in all a definite   keeper and will be making at least once a month. Thank you for the recipe!

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes, and he loved this recipe.  His rating is based on the taste and my rating is based on the ease of preparation, so we both gave it a 5 star.  I read other reviews and made the following changes: Used Pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce, and used Italian Style Breadcrumbs instead of Panko and only needed half of what was listed.  The chicken had the perfect "crunch" factor.  Will definitely make again for him!

There's a reason this recipe has 5 stars. This dish is absolutely incredible! Even though I didn't quite get the breasts pounded down to 1/2 inch, they were STILL moist all the way through. Definitely a must for any Italians recipe book.

I have been looking for the perfect chicken parm recipe for AGES and this is it!  No real changes except I didn't need as many breadcrumbs (even double dipped) as suggested. I can't wait to make this dish for company.

Delicious but definitely did not require 4 cups of breadcrumbs. I ended up throwing half of the breadcrumbs away. Make the recipe as is with 2 cups of breadcrumbs and it'll be just as delicious! My husband loved it too :)

Five stars for flavour but (1) cut panko mixture in half; (2) just dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off. The sprinkling method doesn't cover the chicken very evenly.

I made this for dinner last night and OMG it was yummy !!  My boyfriend took one bite and said WOW this is delicious. Said better than any upscale restaurant ever ! I followed the recipe pretty much except I used Classico Tomato and Basil sauce. I used part on the chicken then the rest on the spaghetti. The cheesy crispy coating on the chicken was fantastic. Fabulous recipe. Can't wait for leftovers tonight =)  
  Merry Christmas, Deb

I used half Panko and half Italian bread crubs.

I enjoyed this recipe with a few tweaks made to it. I didn't use Panko I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I used dried basil instead of fresh. It came out so juicy I loved it!

Keep the recipe as is. Chef John nailed it. My only suggestion is to half the breadcrumbs/panko. I barely used two cups of the four cups it called for. Other than that, I baked mine on a wire rack to keep both sides crispy. This a good one to keep for quick dinners. It's not open a jar of sauce easy, but easy enough to make within 30 minutes. Served ours over a bed of rice, huge hit with the kids and adults!

I made half a recipe and just used as much as I needed to make the recipe. It was delicious. The chicken was crunchy and moist. While I was eating it I kept thinking "who can I make this for". It was the best chicken Parmesan I have ever had. I am so pleased.

Turned out great. I substituted one of the cups of panko for seasoned bread crumbs to add more flavouring. I also put it over a bed of spaghetti with Classico sauce, diced tomatoes, mushrooms, peppers and basil leaves.

I personally loved it, but my wife and daughter were just OK with it. Chicken gave out so tender and moist! If any change, I would add ALOT more sauce before baking it.

This was delicious! I used seasoned bread crumbs and for my husband I added seasoning to his gluten free bread crumbs. I used jarred sauce because I had some I needed to use up and it was really good. Would definitely make again.

We love this.  I think that we have used pesto instead of fresh basil because we had it on hand.  The chicken parm rivals any restaurant  dis.

I enjoyed this recipe. I had to make a change in the amount of panko. I only used 2 cups of panko, which was more than enough.  And of course reducing the amount of parmesan. I breaded 8 breast fillets with still enough to do at least one more. I didn't use a sifter for the flour to apply to the chicken, I just dredged it. I used Prego's Roasted Garlic & Herb sauce, as the prepared sauce. The author of this recipe wanted a more crunchy chicken, this is why it didn't have much sauce. But for me, there was just not enough sauce, so I added much more to include saucing the bottom of my baking dish before I put the chicken in it.  Then topping  each piece of chicken with more sauce. The flavor was great. I placed a slice of Provolone ( Sargento's ) instead of shredded provolone, and then adding the mozzarella cubes. Served it up on a bed of angel hair pasta....my family really enjoyed it.

I made with 8 chicken cutlets. I used about 1 cup and 1/2  pankos since I ran out and used 1 and 1/2 cup bread crumbs ended up with a lot left over.  I used the exact amount of oil but next day left overs you could definitely taste it. This still was awesome! And I'll definitely keep this!

Absolutely delicious & really easy to put together! I was surprised at how easily I was able to get this made. The only change I'll make next time is adding more seasoning into the breading as well (or using italian breadcrumbs - I used plain). This is really delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a smoked provolone and it was delicious with all of the other flavors.  My family and friends loved it too!  (We live in an area where it is difficult to find good chicken parm at a restaurant, so thankful to have found a good recipe!)

I didn't have enough bread crumbs so I used about 1 cup bread crumbs and then 2 cups crushed crackers. I also didn't feel like pounding the chicken so I cut horizontally. I cooked it for 12 mins instead of the 15-20 as suggested. It was juicy and delicious! The fresh basil was a great addition! My family loved it and I will be making this again.

I made a few changes, I only used 1cup of bread crumbs and     
used store bought mixed cheese (sargento 4 cheese Italian). This was an awesome find and a great meal, I've made it twice. My family also loved it.

I have been trying to find the "perfect" chicken parm and I have to say, this is about it! The trick is definitely pan frying it first, before putting into the oven. I only had Italian style bread crumbs instead of panko and it was wonderful. Exactly what I had in mind.

Great dish!!  Don't cook the chicken before baking with spinach and mushrooms.  It will be dry.  I sautéed the spinach and mushrooms before and then drained the liquid that came out, before placing in the dish.  It's great over brown rice or quinoa.  Last change was I made it with almond four instead of breadcrumbs.  It made it healthy w/o being able to tell it's healthy! My husband and kids LOVED it!!!!

This recipe was awesome!! I made a few changes however... Changes from beginning to end... I did not beat the chicken breast at all... I use breast halves.. I rinsed the meat then dryer it off. Then I placed the flour on it. Dipped in egg. And I used Riz crackers vegi as my crumbs to cover the chicken. I took a big pack of the crackers and beat them into small crumbs with my hand. And continued with the recipe. I put seasoning on the top of both side and let it sit with the Riz on the meat. After 15min I fried lightly and then cont with the recipe. I used ITALIAN mix cheese from Kraft which has all cheeses from the recipe above, taste great!! It came out very good!! Loved loved loved it!

This is the best chicken Parmesan ever! I tend to order chicken Parmesan whenever I go out and have tried many failed recipes. After making this, I still try to order chicken parm when I am out and nothing comes close! Thanks Chef John!

This is the first dish in a long time that my family demanded I add to the biweekly rotation. I forgot to buy mozzarella at the store, and it was still a hit. (Just put a bit extra parmesan on the top.) 

It's a little time consuming than my usual recipes, but turned out great.

I followed the recipe except I  didn't add any sauce until the chicken was done.  I wanted the chicken crust to remain crispy.  It did!  This was very tasty to me although I must admit this is my first time for chicken parmesan.  I will certainly make this again!

Really loved it! First try with Chicken Parm and I don't think I will need to find another recipe.

I made a couple small tweaks. 1/2 panko and 1/2 italian breadcrumbs, but much less than recipe calls for. Learned that on another recipe when I wasted cups of crumbs and cheese. Aside from that, I just used some dried Basil and Italian seasoning and it worked out just fine.

Also was very flavorful leftover the next day.

All I needed was a side of fettuccine Alfredo and I would've squirm I was eating at O garden. Delicious even the next day. Whole family loved it.I didn't have provolone so I just used mozzare and an Italian blend of shredded cheeses I already had on hand.

I changed it up a little bit, by cutting the chicken into pieces. I also made the sauce with breadcrumbs separately  then mixed chicken with it when chicken was fully cooked. it came out very well

Needs less breadcrumbs. I skipped frying it too as I didn't want to use that much oil which probably made the breadcrumbs less crispy. Still an OK recipe.

Delicious! Although, I did make some changes! instead of tomato sauce from a can I used my homemade marinara sauce which made it way more tasty and the breading wasn't as bland. I would have definitely seasoned the breading if I wasn't in such a rush. It tasted great on top of a bed of mostaccioli noodles!

Amazing! Tastes just like the chicken Parmesan from corner pizza joints back in Philly. Used a slice of provolone instead of shredded, but otherwise followed the recipe closely. Loved it!

I live it and have done it a few times and it's delicious. Just a little question though. For the pasta sauce, which one would be ideal to use? Marinara, garlic and herbs.... like what I'm asking is, which one is used by restaurants that serve this dish. I know you can chose which sauce but I'd like to know THE ONE used....

I didn't use provolone but used shredded Monterey Jack cheese instead. It was delicious! I added a smidge of italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, and used original bread crumbs, not panko. Other than that, I followed the remainder of the recipe and it was awesome! I would have extra sauce on the side though, either to put on when cooking, or for the pasta, as this amount was not enough for the amount of chicken used.

excellent, made it with what I had on hand (no panko, used regular breadcrumbs, no basil, no provolone, used all Mozzarella). Didn't even put it in another dish (used only about 2 T of olive oil) and just cooked it in the pan. So good!

I thought it was good, although lacked a little flavor. Next time, I would use same prep method but add red pepper or something to the coating.

Yummy!!  I added Italian seasonings to the panko, and substituted pesto for the basil.  I put some al dente thin spaghetti with jarred spaghetti sauce and a little red wine under the chicken to bake, covering it with foil until the last 5 minutes, when I added the cheese.  Definitely will make this again.

I love Chef John and I loved this dish!  I am a total novice and this was a pretty simple recipe to follow.  I love when there is a video, this helps me a lot.  The whole family raves about this and asks me when I am going to make it again.  Thanks Chef John!

I made this almost exactly, the only change - I made my own sauce, and so, seasoned it to my liking.  It does yield a small amount of sauce to chicken, but he mentions it in the description.  So, remember to at least double the sauce if you plan to eat it with spaghetti.  With white rice and salad, it's perfect!

I am a huge fan of Chef John's recipes and, as usual, this one does not disappoint. This recipe is great for company because you can prepare it ahead of time by breading it, frying it, and dressing it. When your company arrives, you can bake it while preparing your sides. Both adults and children like this recipe which is also a nice feature.

I LOVED this recipe! The chicken was tender and juicy, and had the perfect amount of crunch! I didn't add so much Parmesan cheese, only because I didn't have a lot at the time.  Also I only used 2 cups of panko bread crumbs, and that was still way more than enough. Although I would have loved to put basil in the chicken, I didn't have any, however the store bought spaghetti sauce did, I think it evened it out. Lastly, just because I am a sauce lover, I went ahead and heated up some store bought spaghetti sauce and add some garlic, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, placed it over spaghetti, and topped it off with the chicken! So good! Never thought I would be able to make chicken parm.

It wasn't to my liking. Coming out of the oven it was very beautiful to look at but the taste was underwhelming. I love Chef John, most of his recipes are a hit, this one was just OK.

Delicious. I didn't need anywhere NEAR 4 cups of panko though. I started with two, and even that was too much. Otherwise, a perfect, delicious chicken parm!

I have made this several times over the years and it is great!
How ever this time with the tomatoes ready to pick, and I planted 7 plants have tomatoes everywhere and have given so many to everyone I know and strangers too, I couldn't just go buy tomato sauce when I have so many on my counters, tables and still more to pick so I made the tomato sauce from scratch, time consuming but well worth it. I know I will make this sauce and can some so I can live up to the raves the next time I make this dish. Go get tomatoes and have fun, they are available this time of year and cheaper than  the jar sauce. Support your local CSA and farmers market. This makes you a great cook.

My husband loves chicken parm and post me making this dish for him, (keep in mind he is critical), "honey this is money".
I asked the SME (subject matter expert on chicken parm), what would you change, he said "absolutely nothing"!
Thank you!

Made it for game nite with the girls. Everyone LOVED it! Even asked for the recipe.  I did change a few things to speed things up. I used Prego spaghetti sauce with sausage in place of the tomato sauce and Kraft pre-packaged 4 cheese (romano, mozzerella, provalone and parmesean) and sprinkled extra parmesean cheese over the top. Made the recipe for 8 and should have used more eggs for dipping the chicken breasts.

This is my best chicken recipe!   I didn't have time to pound the meat so I just cut the chicken breast in half horizontally to make it thinner by using scissors.

I added some garlic powder and oregano to the bread crumbs. Sometimes we skip the sauce and cheese on top; it turns out really good too. Family favorite!

My husband and I loved this recipe, even though I had to sub colby jack for the mozzarella  (I know! But it's what I had) and I only had dried basil. Used thin cut chicken breasts and 20 minutes was more than enough at our 3800ft elevation. It was over 200 degrees according to the thermometer, but the browning before baking kept it juicy and tender. Definitely making this one again, and I'll make sure to have fresh mozza next time!

So good and so easy to make.  My husband raved and now that I've told him I'm making it again tonight he's very happy!  I used bottled parmesan and jar of basil & garlic spaghetti sauce but it tasted restaurant-worthy.  So yummy.

We liked it alot! I only needed 1 cup of bread crumbs and I would definitely use more sauce next time, but that is just my preference. My teenage son told me it was great so that makes it a winner in our house!

Really great Chicken Parmesan! I made this when we had our friends over for dinner (there were 12 of us all together), and it was great because I breaded and fried the chicken ahead of time, then put them on a sheet pan and finished baking in the oven while we had our cocktails and appetizers, and while the pasta cooked. Also works great breading the chicken breasts and then freezing them for those busy weeknights when you're not sure what to make for dinner.

I used a different kind of bread crumbs, (panko wasn't available at my grocery store). It was still amazing. This is my new favorite recipe for Parmesan Chicken.

I would definitely use a more flavorful breading, but beyond that: Brava!

My roommates all really enjoyed it, so I'm planning on putting a bit more mozz during the baking stage, and plan on using sun-dried tomatoes along with my tomato sauce. 

Can't get over how juicy this chicken is!

This was GREAT. The only thing I didn't have was provolone (missed that when I first read the recipe). My husband raved about it. It's going on our list of regular meals. 
I will join the others who say 4 cups of Panko is too much.  Start with 2c and if you need more, you can mix it together quickly. 2c is all I needed. Thank you Chef John!

I definitely didn't need as many bread crumbs as the recipe called for and my brother said that the breading wasn't crunchy enough even though I followed the recipe's directions. I figure it might have been the crazy amount of sauce the recipe says to use on each chicken that made it more soft than crunchy.

I made this tonight. The reason for the 3 stars is because I made major changes.  I have one person on a low carb diet, so made changes to accommodate.  I used boneless skinless thighs, trimmed all fat.  I did not bread them or brown the meat before baking.  I used a high quality low carb tomato sauce.  Baked them for 21 minutes.  Did not use olive oil at all. I've been told that I'll have to do it again.  Served over spaghetti squash.

This was easy and delicious for me to make! Normally I'm not very good with cooking and my dishes turn out less than wonderful due to total lack of experience, but I would definitely make this one again! It tastes like restaurant-quality food, and that makes it great in my book.

The breadcrumbs and Parmesan  breading on chicken is perfect!  I made this a 2nd time this week, minus the mozzarella, provolone and tomato sauce. Just squeezed some lemon juice and yum!

Delicious! My family thoroughly enjoyed this. I followed the recipe as written for the most part, I just didn't use as much oil, used only Italian bread crumbs & dried basil, as that is what I had on hand. I will definitely make this again.

Amazing Chicken Parm recipe!!! Love the idea of frying the chicken before baking it. Awesomely crispy crust, great mix of cheeses, very beautiful, and a perfect amount of sauce. While eating this dish, I felt like I was in Olive Garden.

Loved this recipe! I usually make a chicken Parmesan that I just bake in the oven all the way but I couldn't find the recipe so I randomly stopped at this one. My husband and I loved this one so much that this is going to be my go to recipe for chicken parm. The pan fried aspect definitely made all the difference!

I have tried many versions of chicken parmesan and this is the best! it is moist and flavorful. My family wanted more and asked if it could be in our regular cycle of menu items. Compliments to Chef John!

Great chicken parm! It's one of my favorite dishes so I tried this at various restaurants, as well as cooked different recipes too. So far, this is the best version I've tasted. (I did use dry basil as I didn't have fresh on hand and it still tasted great)

Wow!  Better than any restaurant I've had. Yes, you DO need that much oil AND the panko. The only thing I did different was I used prepared tomato and basil spaghetti sauce because I didn't have tomato sauce.  I put the sauce and cheese on center third of chicken to keep the crunch and the fresh basil under the cheese. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!

Perfect fit for a middle of the week meal. Prep was simple and results were devoured by some finicky eaters. This will be going into our regular installment of go-to meals.

I have celiac disease so I made this recipe using gluten free flour and gluten free panko crumbs and it WAS WONDERFUL!!  Makes the kitchen smell like an Italian restaurant.  I used pesto and prepared spaghetti sauce.

Found that the taste of olive oil was too evident. (should have used a mild tasting olive oil).  I enjoy fresh basil but found there was too much of it.

We just finished eating this for dinner.  It was my first time making this dish.  I went by the recipe except for the amount of olive oil.  I only used about 1/2 cup.  This was delicious!!  My whole family loved it, even my very picky 14 year old grandson!!  I would recommend this recipe and this will definitely be one of my 'go to' dinners from now on!

Fed this to the In-Laws, seemed to be a hit. Added some Alden Mills Italian Seasoning, from Olive my Heart before frying. It looked like the BOMB, I'm excited to eat it later!

Thank you Chef John, your videos are as entertaining as they are informative. Always fun to watch! This dish is my favorite and I've been afraid to try making it for fear of ruining it for myself. This recipe far exceeded my expectations.  I made a batch of chicken and using the same recipe also made a batch of eggplant. Thick eggplant slices cooked in the same amount of time as the chicken.  I'm not sure which was better! I used large boneless chicken breasts from the meat market, next time I will make sure they are smaller so as not to overcook the coating.  This recipe is one I will use to impress, it is that good!

This construction makes the best Chicken Parm, keeping the breading crunchy and toothsome, not gummy and drowning in a sea of sauce. I copied the assembly from the video exactly. Because I was using cutlets I didn't need extra cooking time in the oven, so stuck them under the broiler to melt the cheese. Made almost as written, scaled for 2 cutlets with 1 cup Panko and ? cup grated Parm. Lacking fresh basil, I amped up the flavor with Italian seasoning added to the Panko mix and a sprinkle of fresh parsley when I plated the cutlets.  I used Chef John's tomato sauce (slightly modified), it is my standard tomato sauce for years and works so well with so many things, Chicken Parm being no exception. Total winner, and completely company-worthy. I served it with some Vermicelli and a salad.

I made this pretty much as written, and it came out great! I did not have any trouble with basil burning, despite what one reviewer said. I did NOT use 1 cup of oil, I just eyeballed it--probably 2 or 3 tablespoons. But other than that I didn't make any changes, and it was wonderful.

This was so perfect
I added garlic to the olive oil when I did the quick fry
Served over angel hair and paired with Zucchini :)
I skipped all different cheese slices and opted for an Italian shredded blend - perfection

My first time making chicken Parmesan and it was excellent! Picky toddler and hubby loved it. I served it over pasta, so I did what another reviewer suggested and used a full jar of spaghetti sauce. I spread some sauce on bottom of baking dish and and mixed some spinach in, just for some extra greens. Other than that, I followed recipe as written. Will definitely be making this one time and time again!

I'm not a huge fan of chicken parmesan but I tried this recipe. I thought it was good, but my family loved it and keeps asking when I will make it again. If they were doing this review it would be 5 stars but since I'm doing it, it only gets 4 stars.

Yummy!! My husband enjoyed so much! Made this version tonight for dinner & I'm so glad I watched the video also. Using the parm in the breading did make a wonderful crunch to the chicken & not covering completely with sauce made so much sense! I enjoy Chef John's recipes & practical hints! I didn't have fresh basil but the dried worked wonderfully! This is a must keep recipe. Will add to my list when I want to impress guest! Thank you!!

Made this last night and it was perfect! I didn't have fresh basil on hand so just used dried Italian seasoning but the panko really keeps it nice and crispy as opposed to regular bread crumbs. Also pounding out the chicken always makes a world of difference.. Awesome recipe!

This was a great recipe! I made it just for myself so I had to scale it down. My only suggestion would be to make sure you season the chicken.

Took longer to cook in oven, about twice the time listed so cheese turned a little golden/burnt but I like it like that.  Chicken was juicy and tender.

Only one thing missing from the recipe instructions.  When do you layer in the sauce?  I modified the recipe with a ratio of 1/2 Panko and 1/2 Italian bread crumbs.l

I made this for supper and it was wonderful.  I didn't have the special bread crumbs so I used the flavored crushed ones in a can instead. Family loved it. Will make again. Very moist.

Very good recipe. I added some Italian seasoning I get from tupperware to the breadcrumbs. It turned out awesome.  Very flavorful. Will definately be making this often.

Great recipe.  I did not have fresh basil so used dried basil resulting in a user error.  I will substitute the (dried) basil on hand with Italian seasoning (dried) on the 2nd pass in hopes that it will suffice.  My hubby enjoyed it despite my not measuring accordingly on the first pass.  Chef John's recipes are always delicious.  God bless!

Great recipe, but like all chicken Parmesans...I don't see the point in stacking sauce on top of a breaded cutlet.  So..Pasta, then sauce, then mozzarella, chicken and top with Parmesan.  Home run!  Assemble on plate and it's no bake.  Then you got crunch..and gooey num nums.

I made this tonight and it was great. I made the following changes after reading reviews. Used half panko and half italian seasoned bread crumbs. I used canola oil and butter to fry in (was out of olive oil.) I bought the kraft shredded italian blend instead of buying all different cheeses and omitted the basil.  I fried 1.5min on each side, transferred to baking dish and cooked 15min at 425 before added marinara/cheese. I would highly suggest a glass dish and not metal pan. My chicken were so large I had to cook one in a separate pan which ended up being metal and it crisped the chicken too much so I took it out early. After 15min added marinara (Ragu brand tomato, garlic, onion) and the blended cheese and broiled for 2min. Served with angel hair pasta and garlic bread. Will do it again but will use smaller chicken breast next time. We will have left overs for days

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have fresh basil or provolone, so I just stuck to Parmesan and Mozzarella for the cheeses and it still turned out delicious. I will definitely be adding this one to my recipe box. Hubby said this is his favorite Italian recipe that I've made so far. Thanks!

This is only the second 5 star I have given and both are too Chef John. This was great. Its a lot easier then it looks and make sure you let the chicken breasts rest for 15 minutes after breading them.  I think that is a key to the breading sticking so good. Used homemade tomato sauce.  YUM!!!!!!

This was SO amazing, and I couldn't find any basil so I omitted that part but I'll be trying it with basil next time. Still tasted fabulous!! I ended up turning the broiler on for the last 5 minutes which gave the chicken a delicious cheese crust! My boyfriend was raving with each bite!

I liked this recipe, reminded me of Olive Garden's dish. I did exchange the tomato sauce for Francesco Rinaldi pasta sauce, other than that the recipe was followed exactly and was delicious.

I watched the video and it was a great help.  I can only cook with a recipe and this recipe was easy to follow. It was absolutely awesome. I will be making this again, probably several times.  My neighbor loved it too. She kept calling me a chef. Really nice compliment.

Use slices of mozzarella. I only breaded with flour and then again with italian bread crumbs. The better the sauce, the better it will taste!

Excellent taste and easy. Had different bread crumbs on hand but worked out fine. Also used a jar of marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce for a little oomph and more for the pasta!! Will make again often!!

I will be making these again for sure. Nice and crispy and not all breading (I hate that). I added some spices to the tomato sauce (garlic powder. Dash of onion powder, some Italian seasoning, and white pepper). I also added in some dried parsley and oregano to the bread crumb mixture, and pepper to the flour mixture. I really think the secret is leaving them sit for 15 minutes after breading and before frying. I didn't have provolone, but I can't wait to try it with provolone along with the mixer ell and parm cheese the next time! Easy, fast and tasty make this a perfect dinner.

Love this version of an old classic. I made it according to the recipe for my family. For myself made one tweak, I made the bread crumbs using a gluten free bread that I like. Then followed the recipe for the rest. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks Chef John.

I followed this recipe word for word...it was fantastic!  I always prepare enough to have the following day and I must say, it was as good or better warmed over.  My husband has not had all favorable comments on some of the recipes I have tried on  ALLRECIPIES.COM, but he totally loved this one...it's a keeper for sure and great when serving guests.

I used my veggie spaghetti sauce with it.  Made sure I had extra in a pot on the stove.  Served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta.  Very delicious.

Very good recipe! I used tomato and basil pasta sauce because I didn't have any tomato sauce. My husband is not a fan of chicken breast but truly loved this dish!

I substituted panko with a gluten free mix, wheat flour with rice flour, provolone with aged white cheddar, and kept the rest of the recipe the same. We had to keep it in the oven an extra 10 minutes for a total of 30 minutes since we used a cast iron casserole dish which was covered. Overall, it turned out magnificently!!!

That was really really good.  It took me about 1.5 hours but it was delicious.  I used chicken tenders from Costco and pounded them a bit and I used half panko  and half cornflake crumbs.

Love this recipe!!!! My boys get so excited when I tell them I'm making it. Only thing I changed was using bertolli marinara with burgundy wine to save some time. Yum yum yum. Never have leftovers!

I made this exactly as written. It is by far the best chicken parm I ever had! The key is the 3 different cheeses and only using 1/3 cup of sauce per chicken breast. Thank you Chef John.

This dish is wonderful!  Easy to put together.  I didn't have provolone so I just added a bit of shredded mozzarella on top of the fresh.  Also no fresh basil so I put dollops of pesto on top of each one.  It looked really pretty, and tasted great, too!  The chicken was very tender.  A Keeper!

HUGE SCORE! My boyfriend said this was the best chicken parm he has ever had.  He LOVED it so much he got up at 3 am to eat a second helping! I did modify my recipe slightly.  I season the chicken with lemon pepper (instead of salt and pepper) and I used seasoned panko bread crumbs. The favor was AMAZING! Other than that I followed the recipe.  I will however have to make more sauce because my boyfriend uses a lot of sauce on his angel hair pasta and chicken parm.  Super easy recipe...huge score...great flavor.

Perfectly delicious and beautiful just as instructed! As the video explains, too much sauce and/or cheese only takes away from the flavor....learned this by experience -  increased the amounts the first time i made it....a mistake for sure. Suggest having additional sauce and/or cheese available if guests choose to add more on their plate, but personally think less is more in this case.

Every time I order chicken parm in a restaurant I have to tell them to halve the sauce, it's just too much for me.  This recipe is the perfect chicken parm ever.

Very good!! I didn't have provalone cheese on hand so I just did it with mozzarella and Parmesan. My husband loved it!! I also did the angel hair pasta underneath the chicken like another member suggested.

Made this last night. My husband, who never really compliments any meal I prepare, told me he wants this meal once a week! "Best thing you've ever made!" That's high praise! I used shredded Mozzarella, sliced provolone, and dried basil, but other than that, followed the recipe. I think 2 cups of bread crumbs would be enough….I had a lot left over.

Great recipe, easy to follow, and very open to modifications to suit your family's tastes!  I made this substituting Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage in place of the chicken, and it was delicious!!  I sliced the sausages lengthwise and dipped them as in the recipe. I would suggest using a little more sauce, or having some heated to serve over the pasta.

I have made chicken parm many times but not in this manner. Was quite intrigued with the method so had to try it. My wife is a chef so when I make dinner I like to try different angles. This turned out fabulous and as depicted remained much crisper than the norm. Third time making it now and will continue to be a go to for my chicken parmesan appetite. Thank you Chef John!

My boyfriend said this is his favorite thing I have ever made him! It was so easy, fun to make, and fast. I left out the basil, used a jar of prego we had open, regular seasoned breadcrumbs, and just used a few cheese that we had (shredded mozz., cheddar, etc.), next time I will add garlic, and use panko for extra crispness!

Great recipe. My wife was nervous about the cheese, not being a big fan of cheeses. The flavor was wonderful. I mixed pizza sauce with the tomato sauce. The cheese was nice and crusty, the chicken tender. My mistake was using two huge chicken breasts for the two of us (had to slice the breasts in half lengthwise and horizontal to get thinner pieces to pound). But that means we have some great leftovers!

This was absolutely amazing!!!! I doubled the amount of Parmesan in the breadcrumb mix just because we love cheese, and 2 eggs just wasn't enough so I ended up using 6.  Incredibly easy recipe. Will definitely be making this again!!

Outstanding! Chef John is a genius. I followed the recipe exactly.  i got rave reviews from family for my "restaurant style" chicken parm. I also had some extra chicken and ended up fully cooking the coated chicken breasts in the pan. They were fabulous. Crispy, crunch, juicy, falvorful. Perfect. You cannot go wrong with Chef John. And his videos are hilarious.

This was great.  I say 5. My husband, who usually does not like Chicken Parmesan gave it a four and said it was really good.   I used garlic and basil tomato sauce. Be sure to use plenty of cheese.  It's so yummy!

This was okay.  It needed way more seasoning and spices to make it better.  Good starter recipe though.

My favourite chicken parm recipe!  The one I now use all the time.  I don't really change a thing apart from adding a little garlic & herb seasoning blend to the bread crumbs.

The best chicken parmesean that I have ever made. My husband loved it. I didn't have panko so I used what I had.  I had Italian bread crumbs. Also I didn't have provolone, so I just used extra parmesean. It was still wonderful!

Simply awesome, easy step by step directions.  My 11 year old loves to cook and helped in some of the preparations, with the exception of the frying in the oil, she did it all.  We will have this again for sure.

This is the first time I've tried making chicken parmesan and my hubby and I loved it. I make my own tomato/spaghetti sauce, which was very flavorful. I really liked the fact that it wasn't all tomato sauce. I loved the idea of the small sifter for the flour. I'd never pounded chicken to thin it, so that was a new experience. Thank you Chef John, I love your videos, and thanks to all you reviewers for the great suggestions. It's helped me be a much better cook.

I made this yesterday and my family loved it!!! You don't have to follow it exactly and it still is awesome. I used 2 cups of regular breadcrumbs and was still left with some to throw out. I also didn't have basil and it was great!

I've made chicken parm before but it wasn't flavorful. I tried this recipe and it was great. I didn't season the chicken my first time because I thought there would be enough in the breading and the sauce. I was wrong as the chef pointed out. Putting salt and pepper on the chicken really made a difference. My children loved loved loved it. Thank you.

This was soooooooo good! I used 1/2 panko crumbs and 1/2 garlic seasoned crumbs. I also added the cheese in the last few minutes just to melt. Such a simple, flavorful recipe. I may try to omit some of the fat next time, as my guilt showed when blotting the cutlets after frying with a paper towel over and over! :) Best chicken parm I have ever made.

Best chicken parm I have ever eaten.  Made better with making my own bread crumbs though instead of the Panko crumbs.

This is a winner.  I tried to double this and messed it up a little (user error!), and it STILL came out fantastic.  My family loved it and declared it the best chicken parm they've ever had, even better than restaurants. I love that it doesn't use a ton of red sauce, because you can really taste the flavors in the chicken which is how it should be.  The breaded chicken part of the recipe is a great staple to have in your repertoire that would also be delicious with a lemon butter sauce and capers for kind of a spin-off of Chicken Piccata.

My family was very impressed! I used the fresh mozzarella in the ball form and sliced and I also used a slice provolone. I also put portabella mushroom on the chicken.

This is hands down the best chicken Parmesan I have ever had!  I made it with chicken strips so I only baked it long enough to melt the cheese and fried the chicken longer as well. Absolutely delish!!!

Oh my goodness! How did I get to this age and NOT have this before? It was amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly, with a few minor changes based on what was in my kitchen. I was using 4 huge chicken breasts so I had to add some flour to my panko. I also added about 3 tablespoons of spicy spaghetti seasoning to the bread crumbs. I used jarred spaghetti sauce because I had it on hand. 
This was one of the yummiest things I have ever made. My boyfriend said it was the best he had ever had. Thank you for another hit, Chef John! You never disappoint.

So delicious but decrease 4 cups panko bread crumbs to 2 cups. TOO MUCH panko and I had to throw it away. Wasteful....Increase 1/3 cup tomato sauce to 1 cup tomato sauce. Not enough sauce on it and little dry. Otherwise chicken was so perfectly crisp! we love it and I will make it again.

I followed the recipe except that I fully baked the chicken.  
The chicken itself was quite bland - next time I will stick to my seasonings.  Also, it calls for 1 cup panko/parm for each breast.  That is entirely too much as I expected!  I had half a bowl of the breading left.  

Otherwise, it was very crunchy and the left overs were just as good.  Definitely adding this to the rotation.

This was PERFECT, I never thought to put provolone cheese onto chicken parm or to use panko bread crumbs. The combo was great. My husband complimented me on this dish 4 times while eating it.

This was fantastic--the panko bread crumbs were delicious.  The only differences I made were using dried basil since I didn't have fresh, and marinara sauce instead of tomato.  I served it with whole wheat pasta topped with more of the sauce, and a green salad.  My husband raved, and he's pretty hard to please.  This recipe went in my "make often" file.

You KNOW this is great when the husband says that you can make it for him every day. I haven't had panko or bread crumbs, so I used half the amount of ritz crackers crumbled up, instead. The only problem with this recipe is all the dirty dishes I make, but it is worth it!

My family loved this recipe. I used less bread crumbs, cheese and just enough oil to brown both sides of the chicken.( it took a little longer to brown) I used TraderJoe's Marinara Sauce, and I mixed up the leftover sauce with angel hair pasta.

Probably the best chicken parmesan recipe we ever tried!! Kids and hubby loved it, panko really makes a huge difference in how crispy the chicken comes out, I followed the recipe exactly the same although I did add italian seasoned breadcrumbs to the panko for more flavour, make sure to season your chicken well with salt and pepper on both sides before dipping in the mixtures.  Next time I would half the amount of bread crumbs, I ended up with a lot leftover after I was done and I had to throw it all out.  Will make again.

Terrific recipe for chicken parm. I used panko bread crumbs and a mixture of extra virgin olive oil and vegetable oil to fry them. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and the outcome was super delish!

This chicken melted in our mouths!!  It is our next dish we fix for company.  We substituted Italian Panko bread crumbs for regular and it was very flavorful.

First time making this dish and I knocked it out of the park! Instead of Panko, I used Italian bread crumbs. I used a half of cup more of marinara sauce. It turned out delicious!

I doubled the recipe. For the breading mix though I will not double. There is plenty to coat a double recipe. It was yummy!

My husband is a big "sauce" guy, and after reading this recipe only used 1/3 cup on each chicken piece, I still decided to make it exactly as written.  It's unfair to truly rate a recipe when you do substitutes and change ups.  That said, I also feared the cheese would be too well cooked.  NOT!  Everything came out perfectly and was enjoyed and raved over! This is definitely a keeper!!

This was the third course for a Mother's Day dinner, and it was a hands down home run! Please watch the gentleman's video, and not just for tips on this recipe. You may just learn a trick or two for the future. I know I'll never fill a pie tin with flour and seasonings again. Those dredging days are behind me. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! I can't see ever changing a thing.

Awesome recipe!  Made it exactly as written & it was great. Restaurant style in my opinion.
I did cook a 1lb pkg of thin spaghetti noodles, added about 8 oz of plain tomato sauce, a little garlic powder and some parsley flakes.  Toss it to mix & served it with the chicken breast.
Delicious!

I had to make a few substitutions due to the grocery store not having some of the ingredients I needed (Substituted dried spices for fresh, and sliced provolone for freshly grated etc.).  That being said, I don't believe that it took took too much away from the intent of this recipe and I must say it was a hit in our house!  Absolutely loved it and it will be a go to recipe from now on.  Not all that difficult to make all things considered.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely delicious. Didn't have provolone on hand so I used a little more mozzarella, but otherwise I didn't change a thing.

Made this, but did make changes. Only used Mozz. cheese as that is all I had on hand. Had and used frozen pizza/marinara sauce from different places (call me thrifty) and added more seasonings, which is the norm.No fresh herbs today. Pretty much followed the directions and served with cheese ravioli and salad. Will probably make again as the family really liked it. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing!!! I made it exactly as is and the whole time I was cooking my 18 year old kept telling me he hates chicken parmigiana. Ok - so he's OFTEN wrong and I'm often right, but this win was especially awesome. HE LOVED IT!!! He said it was restaurant quality. My husband went back for seconds. This is a fantastic recipe that will win you a lot of fans.

I used the parmesan grated into seasoned breadcrumbs since that is all I had at home. It was dark golden brown, finished in oven, used pesto on 2 of the breasts,and my quick homemade sauce with crushed tomatoes, onions, garlic, thyme, oregano, salt and pepper. The sauce was simple but flavorful enough, added the cheese and pesto, and more freshly grated provolone and parmegiano reggiano on top. baked at 450 degrees for about 10 mins, until the cheese was slightly golden. the chicken was juicy, moist and crust was crunchy. my husband loved it. we did not serve any sides as the breast was very large to begin with. would make again with more changes/tweaks next time. but nothing beats a homemade sauce! i think that and the fresh italian cheeses are what make the difference. oh and not to waste the leftover breadcrumbs i just added one egg to it and made a large flat patty and fried it like my grandmother used to because i was so hungry so i'd have something to eat while waiting for the chicken to cook. it's a tradition in my family and new for my husband and he absolutely loved it!try it you'll love it too!

Delicious recipe! Used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of Panko and didn't need nearly as much. Only used about a cup or so. Big hit in this house, will definitely make again.

So lucky I found this recipe. So easy and delicious. This was my first attempt at Chicken Parmesan and it turned out excellent. My family could'nt get enought of it. I used regular bread crumbs that i seasoned and it still was great.

It was a little bland but cooked perfectly. I felt like it just needed a little kick to it but I'm not sure what spice or herb would be good to add.

Really excellent recipe! My bf loves chicken parm and said that this was one of the best he's had -- kept saying how good it was even hours after we ate!  Chicken stayed relatively crispy (spots where sauce/cheese baked on were softened a bit of course). I used an Italian cheese blend instead of separate mozz and prov. because that's what I had on hand, but other than that I followed the directions and it came out perfect. We'll be having the leftovers tonight.

Tried this the other night when friends came over, it was a great recipe. Followed it directly, but a little time consuming. The leftovers tasted great too! It was my first try at chicken parm, and it did not disappoint. I also love any recipe chef john makes - his videos are great and easy to follow and his voice is soothing.

We did not have the provolone cheese or the fresh basil and it was still Amazing!!!!! Great easy recipe. My husband is extremely picky and he has not stopped talking about this and saying how great dinner was. Thank you for this! We will definitely be using again.

Loved it ...loved it!  Did everything as the recipe said. Except I couldn't find any provolone cheese. So just used mozzarella and parmesan. It still turned out great. Used tomato and garlic pasta sauce and didn't put too much on each chicken breast so the breasts stay really crispy. It was my first time making it and My boyfriend and loved it so it was a success :)

My first attempt at chicken parm. Wow! Chef john rocks. Loved the idea of using a sifter with the flour. Suitable for company!! I actually cut each breast in half and then pounded each half.

This was incredibly delicious!  I followed other reviewer's comments about using less bread crumbs so nothing is wasted, and I left out the additional olive oil during the baking as it wasn't necessary. It turned out perfectly!  Chef John, wow!  Now to try your other recipes!

I followed the recipe exactly as is (although I lacked both the parmesan cheese and fresh basil at that time) and I thought it was flavorful and scrumptious. Like one reviewer said, one egg could have sufficed as I had enough left over and the same could be said for the cups of panko provided you were only cooking 4 chicken breasts. I did like the tip with the strainer and the flouring and will use that in the future when flouring my fish.  All in all, this will be my go to recipe for chicken parmesan.  Thanks Chef John!

Rich decadent and top shelf. Would also add versatile the photo I submitted is this recipe with pork cutlets. Lots of compliments the kitchen smelled wonderful and the food taste could not be better. I like the refrained use of the tomato sauce.

this was the best Chicken Parmesan recipe I have tried.  I think the panko breading is definitely the key.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  I like to use extra spices so I added about a Tablespoon of Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs before dipping the chicken in.

This is pretty awesome.  I used an organic marinara instead of tomato sauce, and I didn't end up needing 4 cups of panko bread crumbs. Otherwise I followed this recipe as written.  This ends up super crispy and the provolone is a nice addition.  I will definitely make this one again.

Very tasty.The video with tips was very helpful. I followed other reviewer's recommendation to add the cheese for the last five minutes of baking. I omitted the olive oil on top with the cheese; it was not needed. I made 6 chicken breasts with the two eggs and still had leftover egg, so probably could get away with one egg for 4 breasts. Also I used whole wheat bread crumbs.
Next time I will try healthy methods...1) use egg beaters and 2) maybe broil the chicken with a bit of olive oil rather than fry in excess oil 3) also will consider an alternate breading.

Amazing Chicken Parm, my family absolutely loved this recipe!  Followed recipe exactly, for such a great result, was extremely quick and easy.  The crispiness of the chicken was delish, with the combo of the cheeses on top, a must try recipe!

I followed the receipt exactly as written (minus the fresh basil and I changed the amount of cheese and sauce to 'our' taste),my very picky husband enjoyed the meal.  We will use this recipe time and time again.  The only regret was I did not take a photo.

Fabulous!!! The only thing I would change next time is to reduce the amount of bread crumb/parmesan cheese mixture as I had a TON leftover. Otherwise, it was perfect and everyone raved about it. Another home run for our beloved Chef John.  ;-)

Extreamely delicious and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was putting a bit of tomato sauce in the bottom of the pan instead of using olive oil.

Very, very good. Made as written and it was awesome! Even my wife who "claims" she hates chicken and Panko bread crumbs loved it. Used Barilla "Roasted Garlic" sauce,  fresh cheeses and fresh basil. Will definitely be making again and again...

This recipe was phenomenal! My fiancé absolutely loved it. I added some panko to the breadcrumb mixture and used italian seasoned breadcrumbs. Also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper. Yumm!

I just made this tonight and it was AWESOME!  I don't usually substitute ingredients; but had no choice in this cold & snowy weather. I crushed up ritz crackers instead of the panko bread crumbs and used Prego Spicy Sausage Spaghetti Sauce. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was sooooo good! I will definitely be making this often. Thank you, Chef John.

Oh Mercy this was wonderful. I watched the video, follow instructions and voila.. the only changes I had to made was I did not have fresh basil and used dried, and substituted spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce.. I also used mozzarella that was pre shredded instead of fresh... My Husband was speechless! I did cook about 4 minutes each side in the Olive Oil because of high altitude. Better than anything I have ever ordered in a restaurant.

Love recipes from men.  I always do well with their techniques.
This is the recipe I have been looking for for many years.
Now I can serve this to family and know it will be delish.

Best Chicken Parm...and I'm Italian!!  The only thing I did differently was not to pound the chicken.. wasn't necessary as I already had a package of thin sliced chicken cutlets.. everything was prepared exactly as described.

Great recipe.  Super easy to make and my guests LOVED it.  I forgot the provolone so I used mild cheddar.... turned out perfect.  I don't think i'll ever try another chicken parm recipe again!!

I added Italian seasoning to the panko and skipped the provolone because I didn't have any. This was very good.

This is the best chicken parmesan I've ever made. My boyfriend is INSISTING we have this at least once a month. I served it over angel hair pasta tossed in olive oil. I hate a soggy chicken parm and this recipe definitely fixed that problem. The mix of cheeses is divine! The only 'change' I made was I used half Italian breadcrumbs, half panko, but that was only because I ran out of panko. I think it added a bit more flavor anyway and will probably continue to do so in the future. Chef John, you rock! :)

I made this as written with the exception of using already prepared spaghetti sauce. We loved this dish and my husband wanted two whole pieces of chicken! I did take a little longer than an hour from start to finish, but was totally worth it!

This is now my go to recipe for chicken parmesan! I used the sauce recipe that goes with the recipe for worlds best lasagna (it's great) and is on this site. I used Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs just for a little added flavor. I didn't change anything else. I loved it and my kids devoured it! Even my autistic son who is very, very picky and eats a limited variation of food loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! 

It took me closer to 1 1/2 hours to make this.

I put the cheese on the chicken towards the end of the cooking cycle as suggested by other reviewers. 

My husband said it was so good, it was more like eating steak than chicken.

Made this last night and it was delicious! I'll admit it was more ambitious than I had planned for the night, but I'm so glad I went through with it. I ended up using pizza sauce I had on hand and it was great. Definitely would make this again.

This was excellent!  My son loves chicken parmesan and I've haven't been able to find a recipe he loves until know.  The chicken was so moist, it was great  I didn't have any provolone cheese.  I'll definately be making this again.

Delicious. I halved everything for 2 chicken breasts, but instead of Panko, I used 2/3 cup of regular bread crumbs. However, even that was more than enough for 2 chicken breasts (about 1/3 cup should suffice). I didn't have provolone on hand, so I substituted shredded mozzarella. Will make again.

This dish was delish! My family loved it. I served the chicken with thin linguine and a container of cheese pasta sauce. I used chicken tenders instead. My kids are all under the age 8. It's easier for them to eat that instead of chicken breast. I also used parsley instead of basil. I didn't have any fresh basil on hand. I used seasoned panko bread crumbs and followed the directions as described. Thanks for this recipe. This will be a regular in our family.

Love it!!!  We didn't change a thing!  My husband and I worked together on the meal and I couldn't have been happier with results!  Used the leftovers (as I accidentally used tenders instead of breasts) to make sandwiches on french bread.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful dish!  
I followed the directions exactly, but substituted my husbands delicious spaghetti sauce for the tomato sauce (also used the spaghetti sauce on pasta for a side). The chicken was moist and tender, the cheese and sauce made it extra rich and tasty. It's a perfect family dinner.

I switched it up a bit and used chilli sauce under the cheese rather than the tomato sauce.  Very good switch up ......  Awesome! - Jen

If I could give this a 10 I would. We have had this recipe twice now and I am about to make it for company. Thank you Chef John for this wonderful recipe. I don't believe I've ever had one this good! Keep up the great work.

I just tried this recipe tonight for dinner.  I had veal cutlets in the fridge and wanted to make a Parmesan dish.  I'm so glad I watched Chef Johns video, because I wanted to make it the correct way.  I follwed it as the Chef demonstrated and it was wonderful! Next time I will use chicken breasts as I always have them on hand.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was amazing. I will never make this any other way. The only thing I would change is the amount of panko. It made way too much so next time I will cut in half. I would not change anything else. Yum!

Excellent. Beautiful presentation. Has anyone made it to the point of pan browning and then let it sit for an hour or so,before popping in the oven?

I have to say - this is the best chicken parm I've ever made! I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of panko, because that's all I had, and it was still amazing. I've struggled for a long time with other recipes because they left such a mushy coating.  This one was perfectly crispy, and my husband kept commenting on how moist the chicken was. I'll only use this recipe from now on!

I wound up running out of Panko, so I substituted 3 cups of crushed cornflakes, and mixed it in with the cup of Panko. I still only used half of the 4 cups, even with double breading them. I baked them instead of frying, mostly to cut a few calories. I baked it in the pre-heated 450 oven for 15-20 minutes and then proceeded with the recipe as written. I did wind up with four humongous fillets, and would do like another reviewer and cut them in half next time.

This was my first attempt and it turned out wonderful! I used a bit more cheese than called for and seasoned my bread crumbs with some salt, garlic and Italian herbs.   This recipe was easy to follow and turned out great! :)

My family absolutely loved this.  By using a large amount of Olive Oil to fry the cutlets in made all the difference.  I added chopped fresh basil before serving.

My husband requested that I find a recipe for Chicken Parmigiana - found this and he raved about it.  Would add seasonings to flour coating next time.  Loved the panko and fresh mozzarella.  Might try with a smoked cheese next time.

WOW! This was easy to make, but a little time consuming. The recipe made a LOT more food than my family was able to eat in one night, but I took the leftovers and chopped up the chicken, pan warmed it, and mixed in some penne. Delicious even the second time around. Next time I make it will definitely be a weekend meal rather than a weeknight meal, but I definitely will make it again!

This was such a hit at my house!  I was out of shredded mascarpone but had the spreadable version in my fridge, i simply spread it on before putting the tomato sauce and used fresh chopped parsley instead of basil.   Sooo happy to have stumbled upon your videos... Keep them coming, i rediscovered the joy of cooking!

Absolutely fantastic!  Another stellar recipe from Chef John!  The first time I made it, it never got to the oven stage, as the fried chicken looked way to inviting on it's own.  The second time around, I had to keep the hubby out of the kitchen, or once again, it wouldn't have made it to the oven stage.  It was equally fantastic with the cheese and tomatoe sauce.  Highly recommend this easy recipe to all!

How good was it? It was my turn to cook and my wife says I'm hired for the rest of the month. Even my usually fussy daughter cleaned her plate. I've made this twice now and I thought Italian seasoned panko was better than plain. Learned to take it easy on the cheese...it's better that way. This one's now a family favorite.

This is definitely a five star recipe. My family was so impressed and my daughter ate some the next day reheated. She loved it!!   I didn't have panko crumbs so I used Italian breadcrumbs and the store didn't have fresh basil so I used a basil pesto. Fixed some spaghetti and a spicy spaghetti sauce. This was as good if not better than some of the finest Italian restaurants chicken parm   Will definitely make again.

Tried this 2 times but it never came out crunchy but rather soggy. Second time I tried to increase the heat - same. Perhaps someone can tell me what I am doing wrong because to me a crunchy outer crust adds so much to a parmesan. The taste was great though.

I have made this very similar, just that I season the panko with freeze dried basil and Italian herbs. I put the chicken on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.  The oil gives them a nice crisp without frying.  I have my marinara sauce already hot so when I transfer to a baking dish I top with the sauce and mozzarella(I like to slice mine little thick) and when it's melted it's ready to serve. Delicious every time.

Used Prego tomato and basil pasta sauce and sprayed the bottom of the baking pan with oil before cooking the chicken. Was really good but a bit too salty. Might have just been my seasoning though.

I love chicken Parmesan! This recipe did not disappoint. I did not use a whole cup of olive oil and I used my oil sprayer to spray on the top before baking. My cheese was all sliced. My Parmesan cheese that I put on top was the new shaved one that Kraft sells in a small tub in the refrigerated section. I didn't have fresh basil, so next time I am sure it will be even better. I used Classico spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce, and I probably used more than half a cup, more like a whole cup. So good! There were no leftovers.

My family loved it!   We had the left overs as grinders the next day.  I cut my chicken breast in 1/2 and pounded them down to less than 1/2 because I like my chicken thin.

This recipe was a big hit! Since I was only fixing it for my kids I used grated mozzarella and not fresh and cut out the provelone. Turned out great!! I highly recommend this recipe!!

The recipe does not differ from what I do, using a good quality jarred spaghetti sauce or homemade from the freezer if I have it, do but I think Chef John needs a little ARITHMETIC review.  An 8 ounce can of tomato sauce is just barely a cup.  4 breasts times 1/3 cup sauce = 4/3 or 1 1/3 cup sauce.  Chef John, did you possibly mean 1/4 cup (about 2 tablespoons) of sauce per breast?

I was in a "yellow" mood.  I tried the recipe using my homemade yellow tomato sauce.  It was outstanding.  Served it with yellow squash and also with yellow and green homegrown beans. Summer is wonderful - thank you for this easy and yummy recipe.

I used 1/8 cup of sauce and that seems like to little, maybe not....  Over all, the end result is a great tasting crispy chicken parm.

This is one of my new favorite recipes.  A tad labor intensive, but well worth it.  I use 3 cups of Panko and 1 cup Italian Seasoned bread crumbs.  I also use my homemade marinara sauce for an unforgettable dinner.  Served with a side of spaghetti, salad, garlic bread and a glass of wine.  A little piece of heaven at home. :)

I don't cook often, so I'm not very good at it. But with this dish, my family said I scored big with this one! It was easy and I agree with the others - the recipe as is provides great flavor. I love the Panko breading idea...and the fact that it's not swimming in sauce. Will definitely make it again!

I think mine tasted just like the Chicken Parmesan in the restaurants.  The GIFE  enjoyed it.  I gave some to our 2 year old son, he frowned but when I put some more in front of him he took it and demanded more!  I guess that means he enjoyed it as well.  Thanks again Chef John!!  this is the 3rd or 4th recipe I made from you and it came out perfect!!! Thanks again..

This recipe is wonderful.  You do not need 4 cups of panko crumbs.  I had to throw away about 2 cups.  The only thing different that I did was I only used 3 large chicken breast which I pounded out and then cut in half so it made 6 good size portions.  I used 3 cups of panko and one of seasoned bread crumbs (which I will reduce to a total of two cups next time).  I did not use 1 cup of olive oil to brown chicken breast.  I only used about 1/2 cup.  I will make this again.

I've made this twice now, and my family loves it!  It's very flavorful and crispy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except the 2nd time just put parmesan on top, instead of mixed with the Panko  bread crumbs.  Either way was equally delicious!

This is a great recipe and the kids love it. It is not a quick recipe to make! Between the prep, cook time and pasta I get it done within an hour. Dont put oven on 450º and cook 20 minutes or it will burn the cheese. I do 400º for 8 -10 minutes. Very delicious.

Absolutely fabulous!!!  I should have wrote a review sooner.  I have made this recipe four times now and the family loves it and it's easy to make.  The Panko bread crumbs makes all the difference in the dish.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Easy enough my husband made it! It was super good. We both loved how crispy the chicken was, We altered the recipe a little though. We like our food a little spicy so instead of mozzarella we used pepper jack cheese. It was perfect!

I used mozzarella cheese on top and used the best marinara sauce from here.  Maybe next time I will pound the chicken a little thinner.

In 12 and made this for my mom and it was amazing! It tasted just like Olive Garden. I just tweaked the recipe a little by adding Italian seasoning to the Alfredo and tomato sauce while it was simmering. Overall it was very good!

Other than using a bit more tomato sauce than called for and only half of the panko crumbs, I followed the recipe as written.  It was delicious!

This is delicious and so easy! The chicken comes out moist :) I added red chili flakes, garlic powder, and italian seasoning to the bread crumb/parmesan. I also poured prepared pasta sauce all over the chicken before baking (I like a lot of sauce). I served with salad and rosemary olive oil bread...will add this to my monthly menus!

Made this recipe tonight and it was the consensus of the group that it rocked!  The amount of bread crumbs stated in the recipe is way overstated and we wound up tossing out over half of them which we really hated to waste.  Other than this, we all agree that the recipe was a hit and we will make it again!

This is a great and easy way to create a totally different meal from left-over spaghetti sauce.  Purchased four pre-thinned chicken breasts to make it even easier; used a mix of Italian bread crumbs and lemon pepper panko and mixed in some granulated onion and garlic; used Wondra flour, as it has a built-in sifter-type spout; only used one egg, which was barely enough but didn't want to waste the large part of a second one; did not measure the olive oil for browning; only used shredded mozzarella, which was on hand, in place of the cubed and provolone and Parmesan mix; placed left over penne in bottom of casserole, placed breasts on top, covered with spaghetti sauce, then shredded cheese, and covered for entire baking time of about 25 minutes.  Do not understand the instructions of covering each of 4 breasts with 1/3 cup sauce, when ingredients only call for a total of 1/2 cup sauce, but had much more spaghetti sauce on hand anyway, so it was not a problem for me - others should be aware.  Am really making this review so tedious to remember how I did it, as it turned out quite tasty and even picky meat eater hubby liked it quite a bit.  Thanks for sharing this tasty meal

Delicious! I seasoned the chicken with my own spice mix and added italian seasoning to the bread crumbs. The chicken turned out really tender it it was perfect. The recommended portion of crumbs turned out to be way too much next time I will cut it in half so it doesn't go to waste.

Made this earlier in the week with the following mods: 1) Did not fry in olive oil, instead, placed prepared chicken on rack on top of cookie sheet, misted each with olive oil, baked for 20 minutes at 350, then turned over and baked at 450 until browned (only took a few minutes); 2) topped only with homemade sauce and mozzarella, continued to bake until cheese was bubbly and began to brown; 3) served with spaghetti in sauce topped with a drizzle of olive oil and fresh grated pecorino romano.  Compliments on this dish - The best dish I've ever made; Better than Olive Garden. It was delicious!  Will make again.

I am Italian and this was the best Chicken Parmesan I ever prepared.  I followed the recipe except I used chicken cutlets instead of pounding breasts.  Browned for just a couple of minutes and baked for about 20.  My guests both asked for the recipe.  Panko made all the difference.

This is, without a doubt, THEE BEST CHICKEN PARMESAN I've ever made according to my husband and sons!  I used my homemade sauce in place of the tomato sauce and it was fabulous!  I cannot wait to make this again soon!

Absolutely scrumptious! We are DEFINITELY putting this one in our family favorites cookbook to make again and again!  We didn't change a thing and it was perfect. We did add angel hair pasta and a little pasta sauce for noodles and garlic bread with side salad to make the meal complete.  The table full of family was silent...which means it was divine and needed no conversation because we were stuffin' our faces!!! lol :)

Very good dish. I added many more herbs instead of the fresh basil since I had none and it came out well. I thought that 1 cup of olive oil would be too much so I used less than 1/2 cup. Also, I did not drizzle the breasts with oil before baking; I added a little more mozzarella than what was indicated and served the dish with a good-quality marinara on the side. My husband told me that this was the best Chicken Parmigiana he's ever had. Reason enough for a replay later.

Very good recipe, and will make this again soon. My very picky guy unfortunately prefers regular bread crumbs to the panko, so we're going to try this with plain bread crumbs next time around. I personally loved the panko for the extra crisp. 

The only difficulty that I had was that it's very cumbersome to grate provolone, since it's so soft (or is it just me?). I also had way too much of the panko mixture leftover. I would make only about 2/3 of the original recipe's panko-parmesan mixture for next time.

This was easy and excellent.  Used all mozzarella because that is what I had.  Served with spaghetti noodles so had extra sauce for the noodles as well.  Want to try it with eggplant.  Yum!  Plus served 3 people (2 were teenage boys) with 2 pieces leftover (started w 6 pieces of chicken) for less than $10.  I love low budget meals that taste great and are filling,

This is fantastic.  Quick easy and very flavourful.  Remember the key to great tasting chicken is seasoning it before breading it.  A little seasoning inthe breading does not hurt but it should just be crispy.

Loved it - I'll be making this again for sure! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I left out the basil-we don't like basil. Also, you shouldn't need 4 cups of bread crumbs, I only needed about 2 1/2. Great recipe!!!

Followed the instructions except I used less panko and more parmesan for the coating. Better than any chicken parmesan from a restaurant!

This Chicken Parmesan is perfect!!! We used the Buttoli fresh marinara with fresh basil added and it was so good:) I also served it atop to "die for fetticini alfredo" and wouldn't change a thing!

GREAT recipe!!! Juicy and tasty.  I added some seasoning to the breading...onion powder, basil, thyme.  Otherwise followed recipe and it came out amazing.  I'm learning to cook and my husband was astonished I made something so amazing.  It was so easy!

Absolutely excellent. Made as written with my homemade tomato sauce and dried basil.  Served it over linguine with tossed salad.  Will you could 'spice it up' for more adult tastes, we thought it was perfectly seasoned for a comfort food.

I made this recipe last night, and thought it was just ok.  Maybe I should have marinated the chicken breasts first, because I felt they lacked flavor and were a little dry.  I read the reviews and added seasonings to both the flour mixture and the panko mixture.  The sauce and cheese combination was good but the breasts themselves just missed the mark for me.

Delicious...I have made it twice now.  My wife loves it and asked me to make it the second time.  She orders it all the time when we go out and she said this is the best she ever had.  She compliments me a lot but I actually think she meant it this time. Easy to make as is

This recipe was so good! I am just starting to learn how to cook and this recipe was very easy to follow, had very exact proportions and was not very difficult. A little messy on your first try, but this is perfect if you need to cook a bigger meal because you can prepare almost everything ahead of time. I could never find shredded provolone, so I had the circular ones and chopped them up everything and it still tastes wonderful. I also couldn't really use fresh basil or fresh mozzarella every time, and it was never an issue. This dish is also good to eat as leftovers, it doesn't have any weird taste after being in the fridge for an hour or two and it a great lunch for work or late night snack. I personally prefer the chicken to be thickly coated with the Hunt's tomato sauce so I use a little bit more, but that's a personal choice. I feel like this recipe is hard to mess up and has a large margin for error if you don't have you proportions exactly correct. Love Chef John!

First time making Chicken Parm, it was to die for! We loved it! I drizzled olive oil in pan when I pan seared the breasts to save on fat calories and they still came out wonderfully. We had leftovers and they stayed nice and moist in the frig for days. Will definitely be adding this to my usual rotation of meals!

This is a little bit of work for a weeknight but the end product was well worth it. I did use thin chicken breast filets which saved time with the pounding thin. I also used 1/2 the amount of bread crumbs and parm. for coating, still had more than enough. Next time I will put the cheese on for the last 5 mins. of baking. I do like browned cheese just not on my chicken parm.

Used a Spicy Chipotle Panko.  Was Amazing!  Crisp outside and super juicy and full of flavor on the inside.  Perfect.  Maybe the best chicken parm I've ever had, and I made it myself! First time doing chicken parm.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.  Only comment is that you don't need 4 cups of panko.  Maybe just 2 or 3.

Made my house smell like a fine italian restautant.  Loved this recipe.  It is so simple and can be modified to add your own personal flavors if needed.  I did not change a thing and I will make this for years to come, I am sure.

This is great and easy, if not light. It was a great special meal with angel hair pasta, a salad, and garlic bread. We used half panko and have seasoned breadcrumbs. Note that the Chef John video is not for this recipe.

Use this recipe all the time. Found there was too much bread crumbs the first time but just adjusted from then on. Highly recommend. Making it as we speak.

Delicious!  I didn't need to use the whole cup of olive oil to saute the chicken.  I just drizzled olive oil in the pan and added more as needed.

Drier than normal Chicken Parmesan, but easy and more sauce can be added if serving with pasta. Otherwise not necessary

I used pre-made chicken cutlets to cut out a step.  You don't need near 4 cups of Panko, and I used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Frying is messy, but yummy!

Delicious chicken - very crispy and juicy.  As others have suggested I will use more seasoning in the breading next time.  The fresh mozzarella is a must.  Great recipe!

The fresh mozzarella makes this amazing! I used plain panko bread crumbs and added celery salt, garlic and onion powder, grated romano, and Italian seasonings. I bought presliced provalone and melted that right on top of the mozzarella. I also didn't have fresh basil so I just sprinkled a little jarred basil over top. DELICIOUS!

Well, it was more work than I usually put into dinner. And I should have remembered what the other reviewer said who cut the number of panko crumbs in half; 4 cups was too many and I hate to waste them. I added garlic powder and a little sage to the breading; everything tasted great, it was just all more work and more fat than I'm usually looking for in a recipe.
