For all those who said this is way to salty, you need to rinse the beef in cold water, before you chip it!

This will eliminate the "too salty" taste!

I can see right away the reason this recipe is rated too salty---celery salt. Beau Monde seasoning CONTAINS celery salt so by adding more separately you're overdoing it. Beau Monde can be found at Giant Eagle in Pennsylvania....I make a WONDERFUL dill dip with sour cream, mayo, dill weed, Beau Monde, CORNED BEEF, parsley flakes, and onion which is divine served with pumpernickel bread cubes. Try that out!

Don't make the same mistake that I did. I made it for a party at work before trying it and boy did I regret it. Too salty & way too dilly. Cut the celery salt to one tsp and the dill weed to one tbs for a much better tasting dip.

This is close to the same recipe our family has been making for years! I use parsly flakes instead of the celery salt and usually 2 TBSP of dill weed. It's easy and delicious. I'll be making it for a teachers luncheon. The best part is when most of the dip is gone and you get to eat the bread that has soaked up the dip, yum!!

I added some chopped onion instead of the celery salt.  It was less salty and added more flavor. This recipe is always a request when invited to gatherings!

1st time I made it: Omitted the celery salt.  Cut the Beau Monde and dill weed in half because I was afraid it would sit over night and then taste too over powering.  I was right, half the dill week was perfect. I also added chopped onion.
2nd time I made it 12/31/10: I used the 3 tbl spoons of dill weed this time, and 1 tbl spoon of Beau Monde, NO celery salt, soaked the chipped beef in water and drained off the salt like someone had recommended.  Added the onion again. It turned out great and my family wants me to make it again.

This is very good, and I make it several times a year.  There are a lot of different variations to this recipe that are equally as good, so don't be afraid to experiment and adjust to your taste.  This variation was good, but I usually will omit the Beau Monde and reduce the celery salt to 1 tsp, and Dill to 2 tbsp.  I like a little tang, so usually add 2-3 oz of soft cream cheese.
NOTE ON DRIED BEEF: If your unfamiliar with this ingredient, or any ingredient for that matter, taste it! Understand the flavor and texture before adding it in.  Anyone who's tasted dried beef straight out of the package or jar knows immediately it's cured in salt and should be rinsed...and they probably won't do it a second time.  Rinse the dried beef off, slice by slice, then taste it again.  If it's still too salty, rince and repeat.
I tried another reviewer's suggestion and added about 1 tbsp of very finely diced onion, another keeper!  I bet stirring in a little roasted garlic paste would be good too....next time I roast garlic I'm gonna try it. :)

I agree with the reviewer who said to eliminate the celery salt - the Beaumonde seasoning will take care of that.  I also add 1.5-2 tablespoons minced onion, and 1.5-2 tablespoons parsley.

I have been making a similar recipe since the mid 80's. Be sure to rinse the chipped beef and delete the celery salt unless you like really salty food.

Served this at a Super Bowl party and then at St. Patrick's day.  Gobbled up both times!  I added some dried onion flakes and it added a nice onion flavor.

I have received mixed reviews on this recipe.  My parents think it is too salty but I love it.  I couldn't find the Beau seasoning so I replaced it with 1 Tbsp. minced dried onion flakes and 1 Tbsp. parsley.  I also decreased the dill to 1 teaspoon.  I prefer salty foods over sweets so I love it and usually triple the recipe so I can have leftovers.  I usually let the chipped beef season the dip overnight but you can enjoy it in only a few hours.

My mom used to make this for just about every party and family picnic It's always one of the first things to go so I made more than the recipe called for. This was good with the changes I made: Doubled the sour cream, kept the mayo the same, added 1 tbs of dried dill weed (3 tbs sounded like way too much), 1 heaping tbs Beau Monde and 1 tbs celery salt. I had a 2.5 oz jar of dried beef and I chopped it fine. There was enough saltiness without having to add any extra Beau Monde or celery salt. Glad I made the changes but this is a good basic recipe. This is great to make a day ahead to let the flavors meld. Always a hit!

I have made this for years, but I use black pastrami since it is leaner.  Not the healthiest dish, but if you want something that tastes good, this is it.  It is better than any spinach dip I have ever had.  The beau monde seasoning together with the pastrami is heaven.  I also use a rye bread bowl and use fresh pumpernickel bread and the rye from the bowl together.  I guess it would be good with veggies, but I love it with the bread.  I could eat the whole bowl and I am a tiny person.  Messy, but outstanding.

I used freshly cooked corned beef and made my own Beau Monde seasoning. I omitted the celery salt because I thought the beau monde had enough. This tasted delicious. I placed a tbsp of dip on each cut out cookie cutter piece of  bread I used. Lovely for finger food apptzs.

making this you might want to reconsider the amount of dill weed it appears to be quite a bit more than any other recipe says others say teaspoons is a tablespoon

For some reason I could not  find any round rye in Kentucky!  I even checked with the Panera Bread company here.  So I improvised by using the Italian bread (oval unsliced) and it was fine.  Had I the time I would have made my own rye bread.  And I also cut the celery salt by half and rinsed the dried beef.

One of my favorite recipes. However celery seed works better than celery salt for flavor. Otherwise it's perfection.!

This was very strong. I think you could get away with using half the seasonings.
