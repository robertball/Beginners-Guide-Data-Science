I really enjoyed these cookies.  I made a few changes to make them a little healthier.  I substituted the oil with applesauce and used a combination of whole wheat and all-purpose flour.  I also added more spices (ground cloves, ginger, and nutmeg).  Really yummy.

These cookies are delicious and cake-like!  Every fall - it never fails - when the leaves start turning and the weather gets crisp I start getting requests for these cookies - it's crazy!  
I make a few slight changes and these cookies turn out PERFECTLY!  First of all, I add 3 drops of red food coloring to the 'wet ingredient' mixture (to liven up the pumpkin's orange color).  Second, I bake the cookies at 365 degrees for 12 minutes instead of 350 degrees for 10 minutes (which, like others have said is not NEAR enough time to allow the cookies to cook through). And thirdly I place the cookies with a medium sized scoop on a greased cookie sheet, then I slam the cookie sheet down on the table a few times to get them to spread out a little (I find the cook more evenly and also look a lot more attractive).
These cookies are served best warm straight from the oven or cold straight from the refridgerator - I wouldn't recommend letting them sit on your counter, even if they are in a covered conatainer - the time I did that they got soggy and melted a little from the heat of our wood stove.  =)

This was very tastey cookie.  However is you really  like the pumkin taste as much as my family does, I would recemend putting in 1/4 less cinamin, it tends to cover the pumpkin flavor.  The other thing is, don't forget to add the vanilla.  It does not say when or where to put it in.  If making this for children I suggest adding 3 or 4 drops of red food coloring for the orange pumpkin look, the cookies are not orange after baking.

These were the best pumpkin cookies I've ever tried.  I did change a few things though: I used fresh not canned pumpkin that I baked and pureed.  I also added some ginger, nutmeg, and cloves to the spices.  These cookies didn't make it 12 hours in our house and I already have requests for more.

Just so everyone knows, these are SUPPOSE to be more cake-like cookie.  These cookies are extra special in my opinion, these are by far the best. I was using a similar recipe until I found this one and I like this one much more.  I added a bit more nutmeg, clove, allspice. I highly recommend these, I can't wait to bake them this fall for potlucks. You can also add a drop or two of orange coloring to get a deeper color of cookie. I like to refrigerate mine and eat them cold.

I love these cookies! Just as the submitter states - these are like a combination of pumpkin pie and chocolate.  They have a cake like consistency which is great for these cookies.  I used milk chocolate chips and took the advice of others and added 4 drops of red food dye to the wet ingredients to give it that rich pumpkin color.  I also used 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  I'll be sure to make these every fall season.

This is the best cookie I have ever tasted in my life.  I baked these cookies for a bake sale I am having for Breast cancer and in 10 days I have made 10 batches of these cookies they are the most popular.  I double the recipe and The only thing I changed is that I added 1 TSP of Nutmeg.

Great recipe.....I did use 100% whole wheat flour in place of white flour and I used 1/2c. homemade applesauce in place of the oil. They were perfect, love the pumpkin flavor with the chocolate chips. My daughters loved them!

These were just okay for us.  They had a cake-like consistency, and weren't attractive.  If I make them again, I will use mini muffin tins & pass them off as muffins.

I really love this recipe, but if you're making this for a lot of people, don't rely on the "servings calculator". for about 60 servings use this adaption, because the calculator for the ingredients makes the pumpkin dough very wet and almost soupy. here's the adaption for a bigger batch:
    * 1 large can (3 1/2  cups) of canned pumpkin
    * 3 cups of white sugar
    * 1tablespoon of vegetable oil
    * 3-eggs
    * 4-cups of self rising flour
    * 1 tablespoons of baking powder
    * 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon
    * 1 teaspoons salt
    * 1 tablespoon of baking soda 
    * 1 tablespoon of milk
    * 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract 
    * 1 bag of semisweet chocolate chips

wonderful but i replaced the oil with applesauce, added 4 drops of red food coloring, added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, omitted the nuts. add the vanilla and milk/baking soda mixture to the wet ingredients before stirring in the flour mixture. then i used a large scoop that i use for cupcakes to scoop onto cookie sheets. (they barely change shape when baked)  baked at 365 for 12 min. store in the frig for 10 days or freeze for one month.

YUM! Doubled batch and made 1/2 with choc. chips and pecans, other 1/2 with macadamia nuts and white choc. chips. Cook a bit longer if using baking stone. Gave this recipe out several times and EVERYONE loved them. My favorite version was the white chocolate with macadamia nuts which is what I'll be making again and again.

I made these cookies for a cook out yesterday and everyone LOVED them. People couldn't stop talking about them. I love the cake-like consistency. It adds a richness to them. Thanks so much for the recipe! It will be a regular. :)

OK I give!  I haven't been able to find a pumpkin cookie recipe that isn't cake-like so I'm just going to have to deal with it.  That said, these cookies are amazing!  I tried the "Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cookies" recipe on this site and I thought they were good, but I think these are better.  I did, however, make a few changes to this recipe.  I used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of Spice Islands' pumpkin pie spice (they're all a little different), 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp nutmeg & 1/8 tsp cloves.  I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and I used about 1 cup of chocolate chips.  The other recipe I used had twice as much batter and half as much chocolate chips and there was STILL too much chocolate in those cookies - you couldn't taste the pumpkin at all.  I'm telling you if you like the taste of pumpkin go VERY easy on the chocolate chips - the chocolate can really mask the pumpkin flavor.  If you love chocolate that much just make chocolate chip cookies and throw some pumpkin pie spice in the mix.  I too had to crank the oven to 375 and bake for 15 minutes, but my oven temp is kind of lame.  Other than that, this recipe is fantastic!!

I modified the recipe to make it healthy yet delish. Used 2 cups whole wheat flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup canned pumpkin, 1/2 cup brown sugar( don't pack it), 8 packets of Splenda, 1 egg, 1 tbs skim milk (not necessary to be skim but what I had on hand), 1 tbs vanilla, 1/4 cup non fat yogurt + 1/4 cup smart balance margarine for the oil, decreased the chocolate chips (dark chocolate chips) to 3/4 cup to allow the pumpkin flavor to be pronounced. I didn't add any salt to the dough because there is already salt in the margarine and I decreased the sugar so I want to avoid a salty cookie. I'm not a huge fan of nuts in my cookies so I eliminated them but you can add them if you like.If you want a more orange colored cookie, add a few drops of food coloring as well. I cooked them as directed.( 350 degrees for 10 minutes) Before putting them in the oven, I flattened them out a bit so they look prettier. Be careful not to over bake them or you'll end up with a drier cookie. Bake them just so they lose their sheen and soft in the middle. The cookies continue to cook as they cool. I loved them cold and fresh out of the oven. It tastes much more moist straight from the oven and chewier from the fridge. Definitely try them this way. It's lower in calories and yummy. Hope my review helped! =D

I made these for a party I went to around Halloween--in the season for pumpkin.  They were so good!  I love chocolate chips and they were plentiful in these cookies.  My house still smells like cinnamon and pumpkin two days later.

I made the following adjustment:
I cooked at 375 for more like 7-8 minutes.  I've made a recipe like this before with pumpkin and it tends to get cakelike and spongy when you cook it longer at the lower temp...which I didn't care for.  Just a personal preference.

Loved it!  I made the following changes:
Substituted 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce for the oil.
Cut the chocolate chips down to 1 cup.
Omit the nuts.
Even with these healthier changes, these cookies are to die for.  Perfect texture (cakey) and taste.  With these changes, the cookies are about 80 calories a pop.  Not too shabby!

These are horrible!! I'm sorry, but I do not know what these other reviews are talking about! I am an experienced baker and I followed the recipe exactly and seriously, they did not turn out for me. Other reviews changed a thing or 2 and perhaps that is what made the cookies good for them, if you plan to follow this recipe exactly, dont't bother!!

These are the best cookies I've ever had! I can't imagine just eating them around the holidays. The ingredients don't need to be altered, but I did play with the cinnamon a bit. I used 1/2 tsp less cinnamon and replaced that with 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. These cookies are so moist and cakey-- I love soft cookies and these are like fluffy clouds. I had to alter the temp and cooking time a bit, but that may be because of my oven. I baked on 360 for 18 minutes and just kept checking them. I didn't feel like they could cook all the way through on the recommended temp/time.

Enjoy!

I never write reviews but these cookies just blew me away.  Absolutely fantastic! So easy to make.  I didn't have chocolate chips so I used raisins instead... YUM!!! This was the most delicious cookie I could ever ask for.  Thank you so much for giving me a recipe to last a lifetime.

I'm a newbie baker. Here are some tips I found out by my own mistakes: 1) The smallest can of pumpkin puree is 15oz, so I doubled the recipe. DO NOT make the mistake I did, and think that doubling the 2cups of Chocolate chip morsels will be okay. One cup is enough if you want to still taste the pumpkin.  2) Add nutmeg, cloves, and ginger to the spices. I added about 1 tsp each additional spice. Could not imagine what they would have been like if not added.  3) Took the advice of 365 degrees for 12 minutes, and the morsels did not even melt. If I had to do it over, i would melt the morsels first for a more even spread of chocolate. 4) make sure to chop the walnuts, but not a big deal.  I had LOTS of leftover cookie dough, so I put it in a cake pan. I think it turned out better than the cookies.

Very good, except as many reviewers mentioned it needs more spice.  I used 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp. cloves.  The recipe made 3 1/2 dozen cookies.  They are very much like those at our local bakery where you pay an arm and a leg for a dozen.

I was very disappointed in these "cookies".  They are NOT cookies, this is cake or muffin batter...NOT cookies! 

Also, the recipe calls for entirely too many choc chips; they overpower any hint of pumpkin flavor you might have tasted.  

All the reviews suggest such variations in the recipe that it changes the original completely, but their suggestions are dead on....

These cookies are delicious. No major changes (like some on here have suggested) are needed. All I did was increase the flour one half cup and added a little ground clove and nutmeg. These are the best cookies I have ever had. They were done in exactly 9 min

these came out very cake-like. i did 3 things differently: used applesauce instead of oil, didn't dissolve the baking soda in milk (just added both separately) and used 1.5 cups chocolate chips instead of 2 cups. i think 2 cups would have been too many.

Let me start by saying I'm not a baker.  At all.  I made these to take to a cookie exchange and they were soooo delicious!  I will definitely make them again!

These cookies are exceptional. They are very cakey & have a much different texture than a traditional chocolate chip cookie. I use about 1 & 1/3 cup of pumpkin. I also add in 1/2 or 1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, cloves, ginger & allspice. My family gobbles them up!

These were good. I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown. Instead of the cinnamon, I put 1 tbsp and 1 tsp of the pumpkin spice also from this site. For half the batch I also added caramel chips. These cookies took about 30 minutes to bake instead of 10 and made about 20 medium-sized cookies for me. It was very cake-like just as other reviewers had said. A mistake on my side, but I felt like the spice over-powered the pumpkin taste. Personally, I would have preferred a little more sweetness.  Perhaps I probably would have liked milk chocolate more than semi-sweet because the spice and semi-sweetness resulted in a touch of bitterness. *UPDATE* I originally gave this a 4, but after leaving it for a few hours in the fridge, I had them again and they were delicious! :D I definitely taste that pumpkin taste I was looking for and the chocolate/spice was hardly noticable anymore. So definitely keep them chilled!!!

SUPER DELICIOUS! Best pumpkin cookies I have ever had. Followed the recipe exactly except that I used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 white chocolate chips.

These are so yummy, but I made a few adjustments.  As others before me have said, I doubled the pumpkin (and the chocolate chips), used pumpkin pie spice along with the cinammon, baking Splenda instead of sugar, and unsweetened applesauce instead of the fat.  The result is something no one can stay away from.  I am making these again ASAP!  DELICIOUS!

Instead of measuring out a cup, I used a whole 15 oz. can of Libby's pumpkin, because... what in the world would I do with the leftovers? :) They turned out great. I had no problem with color or with taste/consistency. I would suggest adding a pinch of ground nutmeg and ground cloves. I also added some pumpkin pie spice. Very delicious and moist. My family loved them!

Loved these cookies! I made the changes others had suggested, added a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Came out great! Made these quite a bit for different occasions and they were always a hit. They are very cake-like, but very soft and fluffy.

I would give these cookies 35 stars if I could! They are absolutely the best pumpkin cookies I've ever tasted. Those who are hesitant to try them, do not fear! The subtle spice and pumpkin flavor mixes in perfectly with the chocolate, and they have a soft, cake-like texture. I did a 1.5 batch and it made about 42 pretty big cookies. When baked 10 minutes on a greased cookie sheet, they had lightly browned bottoms. When baked on parchment paper, they were finished after about 12 minutes, minus the crunchier bottom- but I do think they rose a bit less too. They ended up perfectly orange colored, so I don't know  what happened to some other reviewers. Everyone loved them, thanks so much for the awesome cookies!!

Good cookie and pretty easy to make.  I used real pumpkin that my sister put up and let me have.  I agree that these are best out of the fridge.  They are very light and cake-like.

OMG, made these several times in the last 6 months and have never been disappointed. Originally made the recipe to use up extra pumpkin puree, now I make them just to have them. Never tried them with walnuts since the people I share them with have allergies, but they are excellent without them.

Yum!  I accidentally discovered that they turn out just fine, even if you forget to dissolve the baking soda in the milk and just dump them in separately. :)

Just made these and they were delish with a couple of the changes suggested. I used pumpkin pie spice and used about 2/3 of the amount of cinnamon called for and the pumpkin flavor didn't get masked by the spices. I spread the cookies on the sheet by hand a little and they weren't too "lumpy bumpy homemade," but a bit more so than I'd have liked. Also, I couldn't decide whether to use the chocolate chips or to substitute raisins instead, so I did 1/2 and 1/2 and I have to say the raisins really stand up plump and proud in this recipe. Next time I'll make them "flatter" and will use only raisins.

I don't think I'll ever go back to normal chocolate chip cookies again.  I've made this recipe twice and both times have been excellent, just needs several minutes than suggested.  Recently I did a flour mix: 1/3 all purpose, 1/3 wheat, 1/3 wheat germ and no one could tell the difference (not even the 5 kids that ate them).  Thanks for the recipe, will make regularly.

I'm not a big fan of pumpkin but I decided to make these for my son who loves pumpkin pie.  First of all, I used more than a cup of pumpkin- I used the whole can (because what am I going to do with the rest of it?).  Then I just added another egg and about 1 1/2 the amount of everything else.  The result?  A lot of really good cookies!  They were cake-like and soft and not overpowering on the pumpkin- definitely a keeper!

I call these Sneak Attack Cookies lol.  Twice I've made these and each time people take a bite and think nothing of it, but then find themselves parked in front of them unable to put them down!  They even surprise me! They are so good.  I add a little nutmeg & allspice to bring out the pumpkin a bit more, but all in all- great recipe!

Outstanding! I added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp of cloves. Would also use just 1 to 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chips. 2 cups was too much. Upped the oven temp to 365 and baked for 12 minutes as per other reviewers.

This was very yummy!  I took it to work and everyone gobbled it up.  I have it 4 stars only because the mixture was a little soft so I added a tablespoon more flour and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup because 2 cups of chocolate chips is a lot of sugar.  Wonderful and I will make this again!

First of all, AWESOME proportions (for the most part) in this recipe.  However, I made some essential changes for flavor.  I used half butter/half oil to add some richness (I know it's not as healthy) ;).  I added nutmeg, allspice, ginger, cloves, and about 1/2 cup more pumpkin for a much improved flavor.  I prefer hazelnuts to walnuts, but either is great.
Some other reviews suggest adding red food-coloring.  WHY?  I wouldn't unnecessarily give kids red food coloring (especially kids like my 7-year-old brother)!   The extra pumpkin I added improves color as well as taste.  You could also use a little red beat juice.
I also made these gluten-free by using 1 cup brown rice flour, 1 cup potato starch (could also use tapioca or corn starch), and 1 tsp guar gum in the place of the all-purpose flour.  
BEST pumpkin chocolate-chip cookies I've ever tasted!!  They really are best right out of the oven, and also very good refrigerated.  Don't store them on the counter, they're not as good.

I was really happy with the way my cookies turned out. I pretty much stayed true to the recipe with the exception of the cinnamon. Instead of 2 teaspoons of cinnamon I opted to use 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as to not over power the pumpkin taste. I am used to a more dense but still "cake" like texture and that would be my only complaint and which is why I didn't give it the full 5 stars. I can make well over a dozen for less than it costs to buy a dozen from Ralphs which is the only place I've found in San Diego that sells these babies year around. Thank you Jennifer for a great recipe that I will be using as a foundation for my pursuit of the denser textured Ralphs version.

I have to confess that I am not too thrilled with these cookies.  However, my kids love them, and the playgroup gang loved them as well.  This definitely is a healthier way to satisfy the sweet tooth.  

I used 1 smaller can of pumpkin and doubled all ingredients.  I only used 1 1/2 cups suger. I also used 1/4 cup veg oil and subbed no sugar applesauce for the remainder oil.  Also used whole wheat pastry flour and omitted the baking soda.  

These cookies did not spread, possibly b/c of the pastry flour.  

Will make again!

These are quite good and yes very cake/muffin like.  I used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice but should have used maybe a in 1/2 tsp more. I used a combo of 1/2 c semi-sweet and 1/2 c white chocolate chips and baked in mini muffin top pan for approx 8 mins.  Will make again with a bit of tweeking in the flavor.  Would be nice topped with a cream cheese icing drizzle

While these pumpkin chocolate chip cookies aren't very mich like cookies in texture (or any others I've tried), they are still awesome! They are almost like pumpkin chocolate chip muffin tops - how can that be bad? My toddler also loved them. The only changes I made were due to what I had available in the house - I used cake flour (its all I had) and 1/3 cup brown sugar and 2/3 cup raw sugar (turbinado) and one tsp of cinnamon instead of two (as per reviews). I also forgot the milk and baking soda step and just added the baking soda right to the dry ingredients. With those errors/changes, it still came out delicious. I used a large cookie scoop so I had to bake them longer (about 14 min). Overall, good recipe and I will make them again and again.

Loved!!! I followed a mixture of reviews: I baked at 360 degrees for 12 min. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I only used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and it was the perfect amount of chocolate. I added fresh nutmeg. Also added red food coloring. They turned out great! Some reviewers said they were too cakey... but that's what made them different from other cookies and they were excellent!

Didn't think I would like these as much as I did.  My husband and picky son gobbled them up!  They are a nice soft cookie that keeps well...not that mine lasted very long!  Going to make another batch and substituting pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon.

These were great- made as is.  They make monster-sized cookies if you get 24 of them.  I also had a little trouble figuring out how long to cook them.  I went with 350 for 15 mins.  They still don't seem 100% done, but I think they're cooked enough.  I would smoosh them and make them flatter next time (perhaps cook in 2 batches- mine were quite thick due to space on the cookie sheet).

These were delicious! Soft and moist, but still held together well. (You know, they don't break into pieces when you try to pick them up.) I do recommend dropping them onto the sheet by the SMALL spoonful. But either way you get good cookies! Oh and I also baked them at 365 and it was more than 12 minutes... maybe 14 or 15 minutes. Still delicious!

This is the BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe ever!! The cookies are so soft and delicious! I didn't bother with the red food coloring that others recommended, and my cookies look fine. I also used half all-purpose flour and half whole grain whole wheat flour. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. I made a double batch yesterday and am making another double batch today to take to Thanksgiving festivities this weekend!

These were incredible cookies!  Very cake-like, but couldn't be better.  I substituted the oil for applesauce to cut the fat content and they still turned out great.  They smell great and taste even better!  Great fall recipe.  Will definitely make again.

These cookies are amazing!!! They are cake-like, but that makes them kind of special.  I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and exchanged the oil for applesauce and added nutmeg and cloves.  Such a great fall treat!

To make it healthier I used: freshly baked pie pumpkin instead of canned, organic applesauce instead of oil, ground flax seed instead of eggs, one cup white wheat and one cup whole wheat flour, and I used one teaspoon cinnamon and one teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, instead of two tsp cin.  I baked at 350 for 11-12 minutes and they turned out moist, cakey, and absolutely delicious.  This is my favorite new cookie recipe!

Wow! This is such a delicious recipe. I have never made a pumpkin cookie and decided to when I had left over pumpkin. And may I say I think I've made the best decision. They are full of flavor and are as soft as cake! The cookies were a great hit at my holiday party. Though I did use pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon.

These are absolutely perfect as is. My Cub Scout and I made these together on Thanksgiving to fulfill a requirement for the Bear Badge he's trying to earn. I had to resist the urge to add nutmeg, ginger, and allspice to these because I love those spices in anything pumpkin. But I felt it was important for my son to learn how to read and follow a recipe, so we stuck with it as is. The only change we did make was to use pecans in place of walnuts because of an allergy. They were perfect just as is. We brought them as a surprise to our Thanksgiving get together and everyone loved them. The last one was gobbled up within the last hour so they lasted just over a day! We got more than 12 cookies, though, we got 3 dozen, plus 4 more cookies. Maybe we just make ours smaller or something? And we also had to add 2 minutes to the baking time. We will definitely be making these again. They were so yummy and my Cub Scout was very proud of them! :)

Overall a yummy cookie that my kids really liked. Just a few changes and suggestions:  *Decrease sugar to 3/4 cup *Use 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup applesauce instead of the oil *Up the flour to 2 1/4 cup *Use 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of all cinnamon *Decrease chocolate ships to 1 1/2 or even 1 cup--it was too chocolaty for me and that's saying something!

These are perfect. I've made them twice in the past week. These are cake-like cookies (imagine they'd make great muffins). I vary the recipe by throwing in a few dashes of cloves and nutmeg along w/cinnamon. Also, I up the chocolate chips :) They remind me of less greasy, more fluffy chocolate chip version of Starbuck's pumkin loaf. Everyone I know (even pumpkin haters) adores them!

I've been looking for and tried many reipces for  pumpkin chocolate chip cookie for a year now.  I usually spend 5.00/dozen in a local bakery for these.  I read all the reviews and decided to make the following changes -- added 2 tsp of pumpkin spice (kept the 2 tsp of cinnamon) and reduced the chocolate chips to 1/2 cup.  My family and friends really enjoyed this cake-like cookie.  I do think the chocolate chips could be reduced down to 1/4 cup.

They were amazing!!!!! Followed the recipe almost to a T...I used suggestions to make it a bit healthier by using Applesauce in lieu of oil & Whole Wheat Flour. Came out awesome!!! Could use a little less chocolate chips but still came out delicious.

My entire family (even the in-laws) love pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. :-) I found this recipe and made a batch... they haven't stopped pestering me to make more since! I, of course, did things a little differently: I tripled the recipe so I could use an entire 1 lb. can of Libby's pumpkin, I cut the recommended amount of chocolate chips in half (any more REALLY overpowers the pumpkin!), I don't like nuts so I omitted those, and I increased the baking time to 15 minutes per batch. They were wonderful!

I brought these to Thanksgiving dinner this past year and my family kept going back for more! Very chocolatey, and the nuts added a nice crunch. I baked them a little longer than recommended because I like a nice, crisp cookie. Excellent recipe!

Excellent! To make it even easier, I omitted the 1 tsp milk and added the baking soda along with the other dry ingredients. Also, it's better to overbake than underbake these, they'll still be soft and chewy. Delish!!

I made these with mini chocolate chips (same amount), replaced the egg with egg beater, no nuts and replaced the oil with half oil and half unsweetened apple sauce. This made a lot!  I used a small/medium cookie scoop and got 22 nice sized medium cookies (cooked fine in 11 minutes at 350) and 14 mini muffins (filled with the same amount of dough as each cookie).  They also cooked fine in about 13 minutes.  I wish I had added more food coloring as my cookies don't really look like pumpkin.  But the taste is out of this world.  I am sure the original recipe would have been fantastic, but I always try to lighten things up when I can.  Next time I want to try some wheat flour.  Hot from the oven I had to smack hands to make sure we have enough for the recipe tasting tonight.  These definitely will go into our holiday rotation.

I was not impressed with these "cookies."  Yes, I read the reviews that say they are cake-like, so I thought I knew what to expect.  Really, they are more like unattractive muffin tops.  They were not sweet, and had a bit of an off-putting taste to them.  I substituted some of the white sugar for brown, threw in a little nutmeg, omitted the nuts, and used mostly applesauce and just a bit of oil instead of the 1/2 cup.  I'm going to try them cold from the refrigerator, since other reviewers mention that is when they are at their best.  I will update this review if this changes my opinion.  There are much better recipes out there for pumpkin chocolate chip cookies, but that's just my perspective...

I love the texture of these cookies. I did eat one right out of the oven,and it taste okay to me. I did put them in the refig and I bet I am going to like them even more. I did use less chips. 2 cups is way to much. I added 1/2 tsp ginger. and did add walnuts, but next time I will add more..

I used a little less sugar, but otherwise didn't change a thing and they turned out very soggy. I would have liked a cakier, fluffier cookie, but it might have been the slight reduction of the sugar. next time I would use less sugar and less oil.

These were delicious. I did add a few things: a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of pumpkin pie spice. Although, I didn't really taste the pumpkin flavor as much as I would have liked to. But other than that, delicious and I loved the texture.

These are quite good.  I like the light cake-like texture! I cut the sugar down to 2/3 of a cup, used chopped almonds, and added some nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and allspice.

Overall I like these very much. I don't love, however, as they're a little too cake-y but the flavor is great and the recipe is heavy on chips, which I like.  However, I set the servings calculator to 36. Well I'm up to 72 cookies now and could probably get another 36 out of the remaining batter.  I'm using a small spoon and the cookies are about 2.5" in diameter. This is insane!

These were good but I must not be a fan of the pumpkin - chocolate mix. I wish they were raisins instead of chocolate chips. I did enjoy the cake-like texture and my friends seemed to enjoy them.

The pumpkin flavor was just not there.  The dough was not a dough consistency either; it was more like a batter. Overall, the cookie was not too bad once I added some oatmeal to stiffen up the dough.  I think it needs more pumpkin and maybe even less sugar.

I made them according to the recipe and thought they were on the bland side. Next time i'll do 1 1/2 times the spice mixture and go w/ pumpkin pie spice instead. I also thought there were too many chocolate chips, and that it took away from the pumpkin flavor of the cookie. I think with a little more spice and a little less chocolate chips it would be a great balance (for mine and my family's taste anyways). Thanks for submitting the recipe.

The cookies have potential. I feel the more I bake them the better they will come out. From my first batch, I can tell that the dough should be placed in small balls in order to come out the right size and bake thoroughly. I, also, recommend walnuts to add a crunch to the otherwise very soft cookies. One alteration I did try was to add brown sugar instead of white and it went well with the cinnamon, which should definitely be halved.

The cake quality people complain about doesn't bother me. The extremely sticky consistency does. They seem raw to me. If I would make again, I would definitely bake longer than recommend.

I made a "healthier" version of these cookies by using fewer chocolate chips and substituting apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil and whole wheat flour for 1/2 of the flour. I really liked them. They are really more cake-like than your average cookie, but there's no butter in them so it's to be expected. They don't spread at all so be sure to flatten out the dough or you'll get mini scones:). I have to agree with another reviewer in saying that they are best fresh or cold - not sitting on the counter. Enjoy!

These weren't that good at all, neither warmed up or cold. Is it really 1 tsp milk and 1 T vanilla or is it supposed to be 1 T milk and 1 tsp vanilla??? There are WAY too many chocolate chips. I only put in 1 c and still had way too many. And surely the nutrition facts are incorrect...400 cal per serving...is a serving 4 cookies? Not impressed sorry.

Yum... these are really tasty & easy.  Like other reviewers said, more like cake than a cookie.  I did smash them down flat on the baking sheet - baked for about 15 mins total.  Very moist.  Used apple sauce instead of oil; and dark chocolate chips.  Thanks for sharing!

These were good but lacked a little in pumpkin flavor for us. The spice amount is pleasant, not overpowering, but there just isn't a lot of pumpkin flavor. Followed the recipe, leaving out the optional walnuts and used Ghirardelli Semisweet Chips. This is the only time I can remember thinking that next time I will use a milder chocolate and less of it. The amount (2 cups) and more intense chocolate flavor of these chips overpowered the other flavors and just added to the want of more pumpkin. We did enjoy the soft, cake like consistancy and would love to try these again with some small tweaks. Thanks for sharing!

I used whole wheat flour and they came out fabulously (even though most cookies need some adjusting, as I'm baking at high altitude). Direct quote from my brother: "I think these are the best thing I've ever tasted."

Excellent! I took the others advice and increased the bake time and temp to 12 mins at 365degrees. I substituted applesauce for oil, and 50% whole wheat flour/50% all purpose flour. Finally I substituted raisins for the chocolate chips because I had them on hand. I will definitely make these again!

Oh my lord, these are the best cookies you will ever taste or even dream of. Some may say that they aren't very pretty, others may say that they are too cake-like, but in my house, as soon as they come out of the oven they are GONE.I am 13 years old, so obviously, they are  easy to make. The only thing I changed, was that I used white chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate chips. This makes them even more incredibly delicious.5 stars all the way.

After all the good reviews, I was expecting a phenomenal cookie...these were just ok.  As others have said, they need to be cooked much longer.  I did 365 degrees for 12 minutes and they were still a little underdone.  Also, this is way WAY too many chocolate chips for my taste...I would cut it in as least half.  This recipe has good potential, and I'll probably make them again, but with fewer chips and a longer baking time.

I am one of the few that did not like this recipe at all. I wanted to use up some leftover pumpkin, and ended up not finishing the cookies. They were too soft and mushy to be enjoyable. If you still want to try this recipe, I recommend making them as bars with cream cheese frosting.

I used apple sauce instead of oil, and 1 tsp of pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon. They turned out fluffy, soft, and SOOO yummy!

Best pumpkin chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found so far. I doubled the recipe and my family and kids friends devoured them! Delicious!

I made them for my husband who fell in love with them! He loves muffins and thought they tasted just like mini pumpkin muffins with chocolate. Very moist. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon which added to the flavor.

The cookies came out cake like and very moist. My FUSSY boys loved them.  I'm making 7 dozen for a Christmas cookie swap and I'm sure they'll be a hit.
Thanks for the great recipe.

I really liked these cookies hot out of the oven and a day later.  They were easy to make too.  However, I think that there were too many chocolate chips.  You couldn't really taste the pumpkin flavor because the chocolate was a little overpowering.  I think that I would maybe add some nutmeg or something to give it more of that pumkin spice flavor.  I also accidently added the baking powder to the flour with out dissolving it in milk but they seemed to turn out okay anyway.  I like bigger cookies too so they took longer than 10 minutes to bake.

These are excellent.  2 changes to make your life easier:  Use the entire 15 oz. can of pumpkin and add an extra 1/2 cup of flour.  That way, if you're like me,  you don't have a little container of leftover pumpkin puree in your fridge that you eventually throw out.  I hate wasting food.  With this change, I get about 5 dozen cookies, making each one a generous tablespoon size.  They do not spread so feel free to load up your sheets.  I am able to get the entire load in my oven on 3 sheets at one time.  Convect bake for 20 minutes and you're DONE in under an hour!  I make these constantly in the fall for my kids' school sports teams and they are a huge hit.  Enjoy!!

I would prefer to have this recipe as a cupcake rather than a cookie due to it texture and consistency. I would also have a less chocolate chip and add more spices like cloves and nutmeg.

The recipe is bang on, and you get what you bargain for. 

Mine were like mini-cakes than cookies. Very dense with no crunch!  

I'd also reduce the amount of chocolate chips the recipe calls for. It kind of overpowers the pumpkin taste of the cookie a bit.

I didn't realize until after I told my little one we were making cookies that I didn't have chocolate chips!  I substituted white chocolate chips and followed the rest of the recipe. Holy cow - I could not stop eating these!  Moist and flavorful!

These cookies are delicious!! Definitely more cake-like as some reviewers said, but still really good.  Also, I got about 40 cookies from this recipe, not 2 dozen (used a teaspoon to scoop dough onto cookie sheet).  I made some changes based on what other people had written: 1) Cooked at 360 degrees Farenheit in a convection oven for 11 minutes, instead of 350 degrees for 10 minutes; 2) I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg; 3) I added lots of red and a little yellow food coloring to keep the orange color; 4) I flattened out the dough a bit when I put it on the tray so that they bake a little flatter instead of a heaping mound; 5) I smacked the tray down a few times and shook it a bit to try and get the dough to settle down before sticking in the oven; 6) I only used 15oz of pumpkin instead of 16oz because the grocery store only sold 15oz cans.

These cookies turned out really good. I made it two ways. The first way was as written and they turned out and were really soft. The second way was with 1 whole can of pumpkin and they had an awesome pumpkin/cake taste to them. Plus I added more chocolate chips they required but that's because I love chocolate.

They taste fine. I agree the chips overpowered them a bit and the texture is more cake than cookie. Also during storage in a tupperware container they got a little moist. I'm still searching for a real pumpkin cookie.

I subst the oil for applesauce and did half wheat flour and half white as another review suggested and only used a cup of chocolate chips which actually turned out to be plenty. They are definately cake like cookies and they are great!! The pumpkin taste is not very strong.

Soooo addicting!  I make these every year for an event at school and I have requests.  Sub out applesauce for the oil and add pumpkin pie spice, 1 cup of choco chips (Ghiradelli are the best, you will never go back to Hershey, secret ingredient, shhh!) and the rest as written.  Seriously a favorite.

Delicious!  I used brown sugar instead of molasses. I think I will cut the vanilla down a bit next time, as they were almost too sweet.  I think I may actually prefer just a little more pumpkin flavor as well.  It's very subtle.

Great seasonal favorite.  We make it gluten-free by substituting Pamela's Gluten-Free Baking and Pancake Mix (instead of the flour).  Soft and delicious decadence.

I love these cookies! By accident I read the recipe as 1 can of pumpkin instead of one cup which I thought was weird, but I just tried it.  Turns out I was wrong, but using a whole can makes them so moist and really brings out the pumpkin flavor. They came out great!  I use a whole can every time now :)

We liked these cookies, but they were kind of like flat muffins. We changed out oil for applesauce, and we used whole wheat and flaxseed flour for part of all-purpose flour. We used 3/8 of the chocolate, and it was plenty. The last thing we did was use half the sugar, but we used agave nectar for 1/4 of it. The cookies were delicious! I would make them again.

Delicious!  These are soft and cake-like cookies. Followed the recipe exactly as written, added ground nutmeg and ground cloves so it'll taste more like pumpkin pie.  Was a hit with my boyfriend and his family.  Made an extra batch for myself and they kept fine for a week at room temperature. Any longer, I would recommend refrigerating them to prevent molding. If refrigerated, I nuke it in the microwave for 15 secs. I like my cookies warm and soft with melty chocolate chips.

These were delicious! A friend who doesn't eat many sweets managed to scarf down three of them - and then say that the only thing stopping him from eating more was that he was so full. My changes were minor: I used all whole wheat flour (the pastry kind), I used olive oil instead of vegetable, I used part white and part brown sugar, and I used a little less cinnamon and added some allspice and nutmeg to make up the difference. I used fewer chips, some dark and some milk, due to my own preference. (So maybe that sounds like a lot of changes, but they didn't seem that big at the time!) Like others, I flattened them a bit before baking, and I took them out when they looked set but not browned. They were perfect fluffy cookies bursting with bits of chocolate (but not too many!) with a lovely color. I didn't add food coloring because most are artificial, and why ruin a good cookie with something fake? Try these - they're delicious!

These taste amazing, but they need to cook longer. I took other reviewers suggestion of bumping the temp up to 365 degrees and baked them for 13 minutes, and reduced the amount of chocolate chips by half and they were perfect :)

These cookies are perfect for my lactose intolerant boyfriend because it only calls for 1 teaspoon of milk. I used the Blue Diamond Almond Milk he drinks and it tastes just the same as when I use regular milk. You just have to be careful that you don't use to much pumpkin because then they get to mushy. These are the perfect fall cookie!

very yummy cookie! so far my family has loved them! we're in the south and using propane so we had to adjust the baking time to 375 for 8-9 minutes and i forgot to buy the food coloring but they really didnt look that bad, i used my finger (greased) to smooth them out a bit. i would like more of a pumpkin taste, i tried adding less cinnamon as suggested by another reviewer but ill need keep tweaking it a bit but still a definite win/win in my family and a new holiday fave! thank you and thanks for the tips everyone!

We enjoyed these. I definitely prefer them cold! The best way to eat them is to put a spoonful of Cool Whip on the cookie. Yum!

These were really good. The pumpkin taste was not over-powering and they were awesome warm out of the oven. Almost bread like. I followed the recipe exactly and I'm not sure if/what I would change next time. Maybe play with the ingredients a bit to make it more cookie like and less cake like.

These cookies were excellent as is but I made a few changes-   I used 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead of the 2 tsp. cinnamon.  I also used whole wheat flour and bittersweet chocolate chips.    I did add the half cup of walnuts but will increase that to 3/4 cup the next time I make these.

I didn't care for the cookies but this recipe makes really good muffins.  Like a lot of reviewers I used brown sugar instead of white because brown sugar and pumpkin just go so well together.  I used 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips but that was still too much.  1 1/3 cups might be better.  I used only 1 tsp of cinnamon and added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.

I just made these and had to alter them to accommodate food allergies to wheat, egg and nut, and they still came out great!  I made them with a gluten-free flour blend and added xanthan gum to compensate for the lack of gluten, used a flax meal/water gel as an egg replacer, and left out the nuts, and they are still fantastic!

Used this recipe as my base for the cookie itself, I added white chocolate chips and heath crumbs instead of cc & walnut. These cookies are on the cakey side, so I was able to bake  them in mini muffins pans. I kept them room temp in my cake dome with a teaspoon as a stopper of sort so the cover won't go all the way coz I find that if I cover them fully it sticks to each other (coz they are cakey).  We finished this batch over 3 days, giving half to the neighbors, and it stayed good given the way I stored it.  Recipe yielded 2 doz cookies and 14 mini muffins.  My family says KEEPER!

Awesome. Everyone loves these pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I doubled the recipe, cut the chocolate in half, and substituted the other 1/2 with crushed walnuts. Added a little nutmeg too.

Great flavor combo, moist, and super sweet. Had to add more salt after tasting the batter, almost 1/2 tsp more. The outside of the cookies get sticky after storing, but I noticed pumpkin bread does that too so it must be a pumpkin trait.

I made these last night, exactly as the recipe is written (no walnuts) and I am super impressed! They came together in a snap and taste great. Definitely more cake-like than cookie-like, but the texture works well with the flavors. A perfect fall cookie.

Overall, an excellent recipe. Next time I will cut the cinnamon back to 1.5 or 1.75 teaspoons, and add .25 teaspoons of ground nutmeg. Also, I baked these at 365F for 12 minutes (per another commenter).

Good cookies, made them smaller, teaspoon size, in order to get them down to 60 calories per cookie. They didn't have as prominent a pumpkin flavor as other cookies I've made, not sure why. If I make them again I will use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. They hold their shape very well so it's easy to make lots per cookie sheet because they do not spread! I made these after visiting the Pumpkin Patch with my son, daughter-in-law and new 7 month old grandson! Fun times! UPDATE: Made them again, over 4 yrs later. I used pumpkin pie spice, 3 tsp, instead of cinnamon and that was an improvement. I also followed another bakers advice and cooked them for 12 minutes at 365, perfect! This recipe made 36 good size cookies.

Great cookies! I've added 1/4tsp. each of nutmeg and cloves, and 1/4 heaping tsp. of ginger. But will change things around to get the taste right that best suits me. Overall, great recipe!!
Update: I was making these cookies while I reviewed this and discovered something after baking them all. My very last cookie only had few chocolate chips in it, since I was planning on giving it out to some friends, I didn't want them to get THAT one so I ate thinking it won't taste as good. I was WRONG!! It was the BEST one!!  The taste of the pumpkin was phenomenal! I'll be sure to make these again with just 1cup of chocolate chips or less.

These are delicious!  I left out the egg since I am allergic, and they came out beautifully - I am not sure why they need an egg really.  Very fluffy and flavorful.  I did add some dried cherries, and tried a few with butterscotch chips instead of the chocolate, but the chocolate ones were really better.  A lovely cookie year-round - I wouldn't just save this one for Autumn.

These are PHENOMENAL and are now my favorites.  I agree with the other reviewers who say that they taste best out of the fridge.

I did tweak the recipe a bit.  I only used 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also added some pumpkin pie spice to it as well.  And finally, the cook time is more like 12-14 minutes at 350 degrees.

These are amazing!  You really need to try them!

great cookies, I healthified the recipe by changing the oil to applesauce and the flour to whole wheat flour. Makes me feel better giving cookies to my kids.

Very good.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and didn't miss the oil at all.  I also had to bake for close to 5 minutes longer than directed, so I would recommend using the "until lightly brown and firm" to gauge the baking.

Delicious recipe!  I will definitely make this one again.  Instead of 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I also added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  These cookies were soft and cake-like, which is what I was looking for :)

YUMMY!!!  Followed most of the recipe, just added a few pinches of Pumpkin Pie Spice from Trader Joe's and used only 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Used a small cookie scoop, and 2 of the 3 dozen I made today are gone in less than 8 hours- even the crunchy ones that were accidentally overbaked!!  I'll definitely be making these again.

Delicious! Doubled recipe so I could use a full can of pumpkin.  Did 1/2 c. canola oil and 1/2 c. applesauce.  Also added some pumpkin pie spice and cloves and nutmeg.  Only used 2 c. of chocolate chips for all of it.  Did use some walnuts for half of the cookies.  Got many compliments and people compared to cake. :)

Yum!  I love Pumpkin Choc. Chip cookies & have been looking for a good recipe for a while... this nailed it for me!  I subbed applesauce for 1/2 the oil and did a combo white/whole wheat flour, left out the walnuts, cut back on the choc. chips (& used the minis) & they were so delish!  Definitely keep refrigerated or eat hot out of the oven.

4 Star- As long as you make them into MUFFINS!!! 1 Star as cookies. The dough was very runny and the cookies' texture and flavor was unappealing. I used real pumpkin which might have contributed to the runnyness.  I made the rest into mini muffins and they were great!!   I also added extra spices as recommended by other reviewers.  I will add even more for next time.

WOW.  I mean WOW.  I've baked and enjoyed many a chocolate chip cookie in my life, and let me tell you these are outrageously good.  The 8 year old in the house refers to them as "the really good ones."  Simply a must try for any pumpkin and chocolate chip cookie fan.

Really Good! These are one of the best cookies I have ever tasted. I suggest to put in some nutmeg, or any other spice, because as some other people have said, they need something else to put some sort of "kick" in them. Other than that, these cookies are the best! Although the first two batches I made were burnt, they still tasted exraordinary! My mother and father could not get enough of them, and one of my cousins (who lives in San Franscisco) drove all the way down to southern California to taste them, from such great reviews. I did substitute the oil, with shortening. They tasted even better! All my nieghbors and co- workers, wanted this recipe, pratically attacked me for it! Everyone loved them! I recommend these cookies for holiday parties, their such a hit! I loved them!

I only got the idea of pumpkin chocolate chip cookies from when I went to a meeting and she had bought some from the store. I was obsessed. They were soft and perfect! But she ripped off the casing, so I didn't know where it was from and I had to go bake my own. I tried this recipe and it is way too cakey and fluffy. The cookie I want is soft but has substance and is chewy with goodness in it. This was almost eating air and it still felt weird after the next day. I still liked it, and I think I'll try it again, but I wish I could go back to those store bought ones. Haha

I made these thinking they might be like the ones you get at the Fred Myer stores--kind of cakey with chocolate chips.  I think because my box of baking soda was too old, they didn't turn out like they should have, though they were very good.  They were not cakey, but pretty firm.  Since they had lots of chocolate chips, though, they were actually delicious.  (I like chocolate)  Next time, I'll use my new box of baking soda and see what difference that might make.  Wish me luck.  Update:  Used new baking powder and, yes, they were very different!!  Just like I had wanted--cakey, soft and like the ones at the grocery store.  What a difference a fresh can of baking powder can make!

This is a great recipe but, like others, I made some changes:  I used 1 1/4 cup freshly roasted pumpkin; I used 4 TBSP + 1 tsp Truvia (equals 2/3 cup white sugar) and 1/3 cup brown sugar in place of the 1 cup white sugar; 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of the AP flour; 1/2 cup no sugar added apple sauce instead of the veggie oil; 1/4 tsp salt instead of 1/2 tsp salt; 1 tsp Almond Breeze instead of whole/regular milk (I no longer use cow's milk because of the sugar content); added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cinnamon; 1 cup chocolate chips instead of 2 cups.  All other ingredients were as posted in the original recipe.  I baked at 365 for 12 minutes and they were perfectly done!  ~~ My husband recently learned he has type 2 diabetes (diet controlled/no meds at this time) and I changed the recipe to make it have a lower glycemic value.  I will make these again in less than three weeks to take along to our family Thanksgiving dinner.  Yummy!!

Very soft and cake-like cookie recipe for pumpkin spice lovers!  I added extra spices such as ground ginger and all spice.  The cake-like texture and shape of the cookies reminded me of muffin tops :)

I added 1/2 cup extra pumpkin, used applesauce instead of oil, and added 1 teaspoon nutmeg. They were all gone before I could even get them off the baking sheets! Huge hit! Great cake texture, I would definantly make sure you have milk around to drink and some frosting on top never hurts!

This was a very good recipe. I gave it 4 instead of 5 because I thought there was too many chocolate chips and they overpowered the pumpkin.

soooo good. I thought I had a can of pure pumpkin. Turns out all I had was pumpkin pie mix. Ah well, I still made them and boy was I pleased! my version of the recipe turned out a soft cookie and by using mini semi-sweet choc chips, every bite was melt in your mouth good! I LOVE pumpkin. Who says you have to wait 'til Autumn???

These were very good until I wrecked them and added more pumpkin, don't be tempted like I was. I found these to be very tasty but not so cookie like even though I was expecting a cake like cookie.  I used 1/4 cup melted butter and 4 ounces of apple sauce in place of the oil which made these almost donut like. I only had 1/2 cup of chips and that was enough considering I would probably serve these more for a brunch than as a cookie.  They were yummy and I will make these "pumpkin puffs" again.

I thought these cookies were okay, not as good as I was expecting due to the ratings. They are an interesting airy texture, which I enjoyed but they have far too much baking powder and baking soda which I think spoils the taste. Could have used more  cinnamon or vanilla or both.

These are awesome! I added a 1/4 cup more flour which helped keep them firm(er).  Then I changed the spices. 1 tsp Cinammon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves, to give it more of the same pumpkin pie spice. They were so delicious.

These are a yummy Fall treat!  I wanted to "healthify" them, so I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all purpose, and then I grounded old-fashioned oatmeal to a powder in the Magic Blender and used that for the remaining 1/2 cup.  I used brown sugar and I cut it to 1/2 cup.  Everything else I kept the same, and I just love the texture!  They're soft, yet not doughy, and hearty but not heavy.  Mine didn't spread much at all in the oven, so I'd suggest flattening them a little bit if you don't want rounded cookies.  Oh, and I added about 1/2 tsp of fresh ground nutmeg!  I enjoyed the big dose of vanilla in these, and if you are like me and don't like overly-sweet desserts, the 1/2 cup of sugar was plenty.. and allowed for the chocolate chips to provide the subtle sweetness.  Another plus: No need for an electric mixer.. less dishes. :)  Next time, I'll sub half the oil for unsweetened applesauce (I was out of that, this time).  Thank you for an easy, quick, and delicious recipe!

These were really good!  I used applesauce instead of oil and fresh pumpkin instead of canned.  I also used a nutmeg, clove, cinnamon mix I had, too and left out the nuts.  These are cakey, not dense like cookies, but healthy and delicious!

Love this recipe, just made a double batch, one with semi-sweet chocolate chips and the other with butterscotch morsels.   I have to say, the butterscotch are far superior to their semi-sweet competitors. I also only used 1 cup of morsels as I think they should be accent and leave the emphasis on this delicious soft pumpkin cookie!   And instead of 2 tsp ground cinnamon I used 2 tsp pumpkin spice.   Definitely keeping this recipe around!

I love these cookies! This is the best pumpkin cookie I have made. I really like soft cookies, and these are soft and cake-like. I live at high altitude and the only change I had to make (like other people) was increasing the baking time to 12 minutes. I also added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the mixture, but I bet they still taste great with cinnamon alone. A great cookie to give as a holiday gift or take to holiday parties!

I hate to review since I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but my cookies turned out delicious. I knew I would LOVE these cookies so I decided why not double it. As I was doubling it, I realized I didn't have enough sugar! Not even close. I ended up using the 1/2 cup or so I had of white, and used brown sugar for the rest. I didn't have enough oil, so I used half oil and half apple sauce (with a few tablespoons of berry applesauce because I ran out of apple sauce!) I also used a bit less cinnamon because I ran out (why did I think I could double these???) so I added some ginger, and nutmeg. I was so worried how these would turn out, but they are SO GOOD! I usually hate when people say what they do different, because then I want to follow them and not the recipe and end up wishing I had just followed the recipe! In this case though, it worked. :) Next time I will make sure I have all the needed ingredients.

wow! I have fallen in love with these cookies. These are now one of my fave cookies. They are sooo soft and cakelike.  I made some healthier substitutions: Used 1 cup splenda, 1/2 c. applesauce instead of oil, 1 cup wheat and 1 cup white flour, also used 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.  Threw in about a cup of big ghirardelli dark cacao chips and a handful of mini semi-sweet chips as well as 1/2 c raisins.  They are so chocolately and absolutely delicious. Highly recommended if you like the taste of wholesome, cake-like cookies :-) 5 stars in my book!

Very tasty, and easy to boot.  These intentionally have a soft, cake-like texture, but I recommend baking at least 13 to 15 minutes - especially if you have a heavier pan.  Mine were a bit underbaked even after adding time: they did not "firm up" enough after cooling.

I needed cookies for a bake sale tomorrow at work and wanted pumpkin for fall.  I tried this divine recipe and feel so good about displaying these beauties at the bake sale. Holy Moly, I will keep this recipe for the rest of my life. I let my husband have one out of the batch, and now he's begging for more.  "Best cookie in the world!" he said.  My only change was to cut back on cinnamon by 1 tsp, and I added 1/2 tsp  allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  NOTE: Make sure your oven is hot enough.  If it isn't, your cookies will come out flat, not plump the way they should be. I concur with another reviewer who suggested a 375-degree oven, and it took longer than 10 min.  My batch yielded close to 3 dozen.  Thanks for saving the day Jennifer.

It's a very cakey cookie, like some have mentioned "muffin tops" but tasty.I did add 1 tsp nutmeg,half tsp ginger and 2 tblp molasses. I don't know if it was the extra moisture from the molasses, but i did have to add a third of a cup more flour.

It was okay.  Too many chocolate chips overpowered the pumpkin.  Also, the cookie texture was great the day I made them but after being in a container overnight they got very doughy.  I think it's a good base for a cookie.  I am going to try to add more flour next time and also skip the chocolate chips and replace them with cream cheese frosting on top.

These are the most popular cookies that i make! definitely best chilled in the fridge and iced with a simple icing of powdered sugar, vanilla, and milk. It makes them look prettier too. These are very soft cookies, but i think they are best slightly under-baked rather than over-baked. Take them out of the oven as soon as they lose their sheen, and as they cool they will become firmer but still stay soft. over-baking makes them too cakey.

I don't like pumpkin, so I didn't try any myself... but everybody else seemed to like them (or maybe they were just being polite!)

I thought the consistency was pretty gross.  I know they're supposed to be cake-like, but mine came out almost mushy.  *yikes*

Always always a hit.  Do NOT substitute applesauce or wheat flour as suggested - sounds fine but the cookies simply do not taste good.  As suggested before, bake at a slightly higher temp for around 12 min and feel free to add tastes of nutmeg, allspice, etc.

I REALLY like these!! They are like little pumpkin cakes--the texture is awesome and they are not too sweet; the choc chips give just the right amount of sweet-tooth satisfaction. Yummy!! I followed the suggestions and added more spices & a whole can of pumpkin, I also used 1 c @ whole wheat & reg flours and half oil/half applesauce. Since I cooked these on baking stones, I increased the cook time to 14 min (at 365 deg). Now that we are FINALLY having Fall-like weather here in San Diego (I think it dropped to 68 deg today), I wanted to get myself in the mood for Thanksgiving next week--these smelled so terrific while cooking that I'm starting to "get in the spirit" :-D Between me, the kids & their friends, over a dozen of them are already gone and I haven't even finished cooking the last batches yet! Can't wait to try them cold, too--I will be making these again, soon!

This is probably the best cookie recipe I have tried in a long time.  I did make a few changes after reading several other reviews.  I used a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin puree, I only used 1 tsp of cinnamon and I added a tsp of both nutmeg and pumpkin spice.  I also baked the cookies at 365 for 12-14 minutes.  The true test is whether the cookie is firm enough.  They were a wonderful golden orange color and diet be darned cause I think I have eaten a dozen of them myself in the last 18 hours.

FABULOUS!!! These are sooo yummy! I made these on halloween and brought them to work. They were gone in minutes. They were so soft. I ran out of vanilla without realizing beofre I started and you couldn't even tell I didn't add it. I am making another batch today to take to the inlaws they will love them. I did take one piece of advice form another person they are definetly better chilled they are good warm and room temp but the flavor enhances somehow when chilled slightly.

Great cookie! As others have said, if you're expecting a full pumpkin flavor, this isn't the cookie for you. The does seem to be a tad too much chocolate chip in it but it ends up being ok if you also add walnuts. If you're not putting in walnuts, i would say put slightly less choc chip. I also added a bit more pumpkin for pumpkin flavor. I did use 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and added 4 drops of red and 1 yellow for pumpkin color. MAKE SURE TO USE PARCHMENT PAPER!! The first time I made it, the cookies started to smoke (YIKES) and burn before it was fully cooked on the inside.  The chocolate chips on the bottom of the cookie melted, spread, and burned the bottom of the cookie, even though I greased the cookie sheet and it sat in the middle rack. Brought it to work and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Someone said it was a "holiday explosion in your mouth" =)

I made a few substitutions to make it fit with my diet.  I substituted Extra Virgin Coconut Oil for the oil (I will try applesauce next time.) and used organic whole wheat flour.  I also used organic cane sugar instead of white sugar.  I plopped the whole mix into a greased stoneware cookie sheet and baked for about 20 min. and cut into squares.

Wow.  I was impressed.  They were easy to make and SO soft.  They don't get hard like most cookies and they don't spread while baking.  I took others advice and used less cinnamon so the pumpkin could really come through.  VERY GOOD recipe.  I'll make more!

These cookies were a success.  I took them to my children's school and one of the children discribed them as "heavenly".  I modified the recipe though.  I doubled the recipe, I used the whole can of pumpkin, 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar, then 1 c. of honey. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and 1/2 c. egg whites for eggs.  I used all white whole wheat flour.  Then put in pumpkin pie spice. I would put in just 2 cups of chocolate chips for myself but the kids thought there wasn't enough...of course.  I will make them again.

I was intrigued by this recipe when I came across it- pumpkin and chocolate.  I made these today and I am so glad I gave it a try.  These cookies are delicious!  My boyfriend has said multiple times today how much he likes them!  I will definitely be making these cookies again!

These make good cookies. I altered the recipe a bit to make them more healthy. I used half whole wheat flour, half unsweetned applesauce in place of the oil, and ground flaxseed in water in place of the egg. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips, and that was plenty!

These are Fabulous!  I used whole wheat flour, substituted cinnamon for 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and used only 1 c. of milk chocolate chips.  Even my hubby who doesn't like pumpkin cookies, said how good they smelled and ate at least 3 right out of the oven.  He loves them and i'm sure everyone else will too.  I was going to use applesauce instead of oil, but forgot. I'll try it next time.

These are a great fall cookie.  I have used another recipe for years, and decided to try this one.   I had to add 1/2 cup more flour to the batter because it was too runny.  After that change they came out perfect.  Very soft and moist.

We all liked these, but they're not your typical cookie.  They are sort of like muffin tops as others have said.  We only used 1.5 cups of chocolate chips and that was plenty.  We also added slightly more than a cup of pumpkin since we love it.  I think it could have used even more, but didn't want to ruin the recipe.

These are really easy and really tasty - although I found they were better if cooled/refrigerated overnight before eating, otherwise the soft chocolate chips overpowers the pumpkin and makes the texture really gooey.

I really liked this recipe! Really good! I just changed the 1/2 cup of vegetable oil for 1/2 cup of applesauce because I didn't had any veg.oil. 
I baked them between 12-14 min. maybe because my oven is old. 
But besides thos minor details, great recipe! easy to follow!!!! :)

this is a wonderful recipe that i recommend to anyone looking for pumpkin cookies. i used chocolate bits and found that it produced a more interesting, uniform flavor, but that is merely a preference. also, i took the refrigerator suggestion one step further and froze the cookies.

These cookies were a hit with my kids and their friends.  While they don't top a traditional chocolate chip cookie, they certainly are a little more nutritious.  I made mine with 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 Splenda for the sugar.  I have found that they can be cooked in a jelly roll pan as cookie bars with good results.

Very good, but way to many chocolate chips.  Overwhelms the pumpkin flavor.  Suggest cutting the amount of chocolate chips in half for best flavor.

I loved these cookies!  They are very moist and cake-like...a complete delight.  My advice would be to DEFINITELY add the walnuts...I even doubled the walnuts and it was just wonderful.  These cookies are a BIG HIT!!!

These cookies are delicious and cake-like.  I really recommend adding the walnuts - they really pull the seemingly incompatible flavors of pumpkin and chocolate together and add the perfect amount of crunch!  As a pumpkin aficionado, I can confidently say that this is one of my favorite pumpkin recipes yet!

These cookies definitely couldn't win a beauty contest but they are taste good and have a great soft texture.  This was my first time making them and I followed the recipe except for replacing one teaspoon of cinnamon for Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus which also has a bit of nutmeg and all spice.  I will definitely try these cookies again but I will add a teaspoon or so of pumpkin pie spice.  The pumpkin flavor is a bit watered down and needs a little more kick.

EXCELLENT!  Don't even bother trying another recipe.

This cookie was moist and wonderful.  We've made them several times over.  It's the only cookie my kids want anymore.  There is a bit of a baking soda flavor after they've cooked so I cut back a bit on the soda and dissolve it in liquid before adding to the mix.  It made all the difference.

Good recipe.  Definately add 1 tsp nutmeg, double the pumpkin and the chocolate chips.  Also, my family much prefers milk chocolate chips for these...they add some sweetness that makes it hard to stop eating these cookies.

1. Used whole can of pumpkin instead of just the cup, plus  2 extra tablespoons of white sugar to sweeten the extra pumpkin. 2.  Added vanilla to the wet ingredients, since I don't think that is specifically stated in recipe directions.  3. Added baking soda directly to dry ingredients and omitted milk.  (I  always use a small, closely tined whisk to blend dry ingredients before combining with wet items.) Everything else was exactly as directed. These are scrumptious!

I've made these cookies since the mid 1970's.  Love 'em.  But one thing that never made sense to me is that it calls for 1 cup of canned pumpkin.  But you have pumpkin leftover.  I solved that issue by using the full can of pumpkin and doubling the other ingredients (except the chocolate chips).  A can of pumpkin is less than 2 cups, but the cookies turn out just fine and I do not have leftover pumpkin.  Works for me!  I also like using mini-chocolate chips.

I ALWAYS come back to this recipie! The cookies are so moist And flavorful And I love the texture. My favorite is when they first come out of the oven and they are warm! The dough is more of a batter, but don’t be concerned! I’m only 13 but I love to bake... these are my favorite cookies to make because they are so easy and delicious! The only thing I changed isn’t I added semi sweet AND milk chocolate chips but that’s not more of a personal preference ;) also my sister can’t eat gluten but even with gluten free flour substitute these are still phenomenal

The cookies were very good, and we are eating them non- stop. the only thing I would recommend is add just a hair more pumpkin because it lacks that taste a little bit. overall though. It is great.

These came out great. I did make a few small changes that others might consider. Went half white, half brown sugar. Also replaced about half the cinnamon with a mix of nutmeg and ginger. Otherwise kept everythign the same and came out with maybe the best cookies I've ever had.

PS: might be my oven, but I had to cook them for about 19 minutes at 350 instead of 10 minutes.

I have been making these cookies seasonally for a few years now.  I take them to work as my birthday treat (11/12).  I believe this was my third or fourth year, and a couple of weeks ago, people started asking about them. 
"When are you bringing in your Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies?  I want to make sure I'm at work when you do!"
They always get rave reviews and are gobbled up quickly.

So I made this recipe last year and felt they came out a tad too dry.  I thought maybe I just overbaked them and just needed to take them out sooner.  I recently revisited this recipe and decided to give it another go.  After I had already mixed up the cookie dough I realized instead of just 1 cup pumpkin as the recipe says, I misread and put in 1 whole CAN (15oz, = 1 3/4 cups).  The cookies came out perfect with the extra pumpkin!  I have baked a couple batches this way and they are excellent.  Bake them for 13 minutes exactly.  Also store them in a ziplock bag and they will stay perfectly moist the way pumpkin chocolate chip cookies should be. My 5 star rating is for the recipe with the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of just 1 cup.

We liked these cookies . . . not too sweet and a nice cake-like texture.   I had some pumpkin pie filling left over from another recipe so used that instead of the pumpkin the recipe asks for.  I appreciated the previous suggestions -  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips (otherwise, the chocolate over-powers the pumpkin flavour).   Also, the temp and time on this recipe are off . .. . I had to bake them at 365F for 13 minutes to bake them through.

Came out really well. Very cake-like.
Adjustments: Needed at least 20 minutes at 350F in my oven, and could possibly have gone to 30 mins. Replaced vegetable oil with a stick of butter, and half the cinnamon with ground ginger so it wouldn't overpower the taste. Used about 3/4 the chocolate chips, and cookies still very chocolaty. Skipped walnuts. Next time: increase the milk, and decrease the vanilla.

They are so amazing!!!!!! i made them for a bible study and they were gone within minutes. i love how cakey and soft they are, except i only added 1 cup of chocolate chips and no walnuts. I also used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 of a teaspoon for pumpkin pie spice and another for allspice. They are delicious!!!!!!!!!

I love cooking.  But cannot seem to  get the baking thing. However, I was under pressure for thanksgiving. Made these. They were brilliant. They look rustic, taste unique between a pie and a cookie and are sooooo easy for a farm girl without any fancy gadgets|! Like a good pair of cowboy boots, this recipe will be with me forever. Thank you for saving my baking nightmares and making me look as shiny as my boots!

I loved these, but I think (never thought I would say this) there might be too many chocolate chips. I might use only 1 cup next time. I also added 1 tsp. Pumpkin pie spice.

We really like these cookies.  The next time I make them, it will be a double batch and I will drop at least one tbl of the dough. I haven't made them since last year and forgot that they don't spread very much. We could eat them once a month.

These are my favorite cookies. I only give it 4 stars because I halve the amount of chocolate chips, two cups is too much. I also decrease the amount of sugar by about a 1/3rd but that’s personal preference. If you don’t like pumpkin, don’t worry you can barely taste it. Warning: these turn out with an almost cake-like consistency. I love it but it takes some people by surprise.

I always hesitate to use pumpkin or any recipe that has squash as my boyfriend hates it, but he really love these cookies and even ask for more - what a surprise for me! I use fresh pumpkin instead of canned, and taking advice from other reviews to add 1/4 tsp of ground cloves and nutmeg. As personal preference, I also reduce the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp and sugar to 2/3 cup (chocolate chips will give enough sweetness anyway) Will try to replace oil with applesauce next time.  Will definitely make these again!

I just made these cookies. We had left over canned pumpkin in the kitchen cupboard so I thought - why not? They are pretty good. I tried  both baking them as cookies on baking sheet/ and in muffin tin.  I like how they look as mini muffins. Both ways, the taste was great. I followed the recipe and just added pumpkin spice mix/ nutmeg to the flour.  I think they are best chilled in the fridge.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I tweaked it for gluten free and the result was wonderful.  I also had a can of sweet potato pie mix in the pantry so I substituted that for the pumpkin.  I did the same with using pecans instead of walnuts.  Then I used Krusteaz all-purpose gluten free flour.  I plan to use pumpkin and walnuts next time.

Very good flavor. Moist.  Taste more chocolate than pumpkin. They stay puffy rather than melt down like other chocolate chip cookies.  My husband loved them warm.  Didn't want to try them cold.  Just a note: didn't realize you were suppose to mix the milk and baking soda and add to the wet ingredients.  Will definitely make again.

Oh my heavens these cookies were good! I made them healthier and used whole whet flour and applesauce. They came out fantastic. I do agree with everyone about changing the oven temp. My oven tends to run hot, and the cookies still didn't cook all the way through after 10 min. I did 365 for 15 minutes, but I think everyone needs to adjust based on their particular oven. These cookies will bring you to your knees, they are so good!

I substituted apple sauce for the oil and cut the chocolate chips down to 1 cup. I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white and put in a touch of allspice and a touch of nutmeg. The cookies were great. They way surpassed my expectations.

These are so good! I made a few substitutions due to preference or what I had on hand, including adding an extra egg and using 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup maple syrup, using oat flour and oat bran, and using pumpkin pie spice rather than just cinnamon. I was a bit short on the flour so I also substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for vanilla protein powder (I used Bluebonnet, a grass-fed whey sweetened with stevia). The cookies did not come out overly sweet, which is exactly how I like them. Definitely a keeper!

LOVE THESE!! I have been making these cookies for over a year now and they are a family favorite!  Everyone that tries them wants the recipe. I have made it as the recipe states and it is excellent.  But now I always use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and cook 11-12 minutes - immediately remove from pan and cool.

I would pass on this one unless you like a vegetable oil taste.  I only make my pumpkin cookies with butter but I thought i would give it a try.  will NEVER make them again.

GOOD gracious me. 
I substitued coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. 
Added one extra egg white.
Used pumpkin pie mix instead of straight up pumpkin.
Substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour in place of white.
Added mini semi-sweet chips.
Chopped the walnuts in a food processor til they were small. They add the perfect texture and flavor.
Doubled the batch. 
They were gone within 3 days.:-) I'll definitely make these again and again.

Made these and they are great.  Takes a bit longer to bake through.   Also I added 1 tsp ground ginger 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.   Didn't do chocolate or nuts.  Added raisins instead.   Super yummy

As is, I give it 4 stars because it needs a little sprucing up with spices! I eyeballed 1T cinnamon, 1T pumpkin pie spice, 1/2t each allspice, ginger, and nutmeg. Tasted the batter and determined it amazing so didn't add anything else. Per recommendations, I baked at 365 for 12-14 mins depending on size of cookie. These are cakey and extremely good. Thanks!

These cookies have become a fall tradition for me. The first time I had anything like them, I was very young. My great Aunt made them for me. I started baking more as I got older and didn't have the exact recipe. After trying multiple recipes this is absolutely the winner. They taste almost exactly the same as the cookies I grew up with. Since I started making them, I have yet to find someone that doesn't LOVE these cookies. The only thing I change is using 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 a teaspoon cinnamon. I always double the recipe, too. It makes a lot of cookies but they go fast... Whatever is left after the first day, keeps very well... And the very last cookie is always just as good as the first!!!

These definitely have more of a cake consistency than cookie. Also, the amount of chocolate chips overwhelmed the pumpkin so that I really couldn't taste much pumpkin. I happen to love semi-sweet chocolate so these were still tasty for me, just not what I expected. One other thing- I made a double recipe and it came out to > 50 largish cookies, not 24.

These cookies were amazing! So soft and chewy and perfect for fall. Next time I am going to try substituting the sugar for honey for a slightly healthier version. Dark chocolate chips would also taste great in my opinion.

These cookies are great! The only changes I made were based on previous reviews so I added 3 drops red food dye, only used 1.5 cups chocolate chips, and changed the spices. I used 1.5 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. Also I cooked them 10-12 mins on 365. They're delicious!!!

Wanted an easy pumpkin recipe & wow this is it! I had slight modifications: used 1.5tsp cinnamon (ran out of because vacation home isn't stocked as well as my home kitchen), &  I used 1 C milk chocolate chips (I ALWAYS reduce amount of chocolate chips in any recipe, partly because I use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet), oh & 1/4C chopped walnuts (again because I wasnt in my home kitchen so I had to pay full price $1.99 for 1/2C package! ). Amazing, pillowy, &just sweet enough. Another person said higher temp & a bit longer, but maybe because I'm higher elevation (3-4000') 350@10min was perfect. You could easily make minis, &/or add frosting to flat side to make whoopy-pies. I've posted pics if you want to see my results.

My family loved this recipe. I was skeptical when making them the first time because I wasn't quite sure how they would taste. I did use a little less cinnamon but I stuck to the original recipe for everything else. They came out very cake like which I loved. Great for the fall because they are super festive. The only thing I would recommend is to store these in the refrigerator because they will become sticky if left out.

Fantastic!!! I don't know how anyone could not like these cookies. Soft, gooey, fluffy, light, rich, tasty- amazing. I will never make chocolate chip cookies again without pumpkin. Plus they didn't take much preparation time. Love them.

We LOVE this recipe! It freezes beautifully, so I usually make 3x's the original and just pull them out as necessary. I don't find them soggy at all, but I do store them with paper towel underneath.

I have to say...after reading the negative reviews, I was in a complete panic as I had prepared the batter the night before and kept it in the fridge. Tempted to throw it away the next day, I took a deep breath and was glad I didn't. The cookies came out truly delicious! I agree with a few though, that if you're making THAT many changes to a recipe, it's probably not the best recipe for you. Anyway, here are some notes for some of the less drastic changes I would make next time. 1)As a chocolate lover, this recipe definitely called for too much chocolate. I would limit the morsels to 1 cup or 1 1/4cup. 2)Keep the temperature at 350 for 10 minutes! It does not need to go higher. I burned the bottoms of the first batch just by going 5 minutes over. The lumps definitely don't go down like usual cookies, so they will look deformed but they ARE cooked! 3) In a last minute panic, I threw in a few dashes of pumpkin spice (just in case) the pumpkin flavor didn't shine. I doubt a few dashes made a difference, but the pumpkin flavor was there!      No, this isn't the BEST cookie recipe out there, but to me these are pretty darn good! I'm so glad I didn't make any of the other recommended changes. This recipe seems to have its quirks already worked out :) ENJOY!!

These were very good. I would definitely eat them cold from the fridge, better cold than warm. I might add some allspice, or nutmeg next time. My kids really enjoyed them also, asked for more. I like the cakey texture.

Really Tastey!  As one reviewer said, these are meant to be cake-like.  These are so much better than the ones they sell at Ralphs.  I used 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves to give it more of a pumpkin pie taste.  AWESOME!

These were yummy! The kids and hubby loved them too. I think I did less sugar and added nutmeg. I use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. All organic ingredients.

Great recipe! Love the consistency of the cookie. It stays nice and soft because it is cake-like. Didn't have enough white sugar so I substituted some granulated brown and it was great.

Taste like pumpkin bread in cookie form. First couple times, I made them exactly as said. Then, I added a little bit more pumpkin and it made it more dense. Perfect after sitting for a day.

I made this with the ingredients stated, except that I added the vanilla with the egg, pumpkin, et cetera. I used a small cookie scoop which produced small little button like cookies; these cookies do not spread much, if at all.  The texture of the dough is wet and is not suitable for pressing down with glass or fingers. I tried to refrigerate dough, hoping to firm it up, but to no avail.  When I made the recipe I thought the ratio of chocolate chips seemed high and I was correct.  After baking and sampling I thought there were way too many chocolate chips; next time I will halve the amount.  The chips seemed to distract away from the pumpkin flavor.  I do like the suggestion I read in one of the other reviews of slamming the baking sheet down on the counter a few times to spread them out a bit.  Next time I will use a larger scoop.  These definitely are more cake like in texture; I would store them with the lid off, or refrigerate, or they will turn to mush. This was my first attempt at a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie and it won't be my last.  These were good, maybe great, but not exactly what I was looking for.  I may even suggest adding some rolled oats to give a more substantial texture.

Followed the recipe exactly as printed but I sustituted white chocolate chips for the chocolate ones.  I would not bother to make this recipe again.  The cookies taste good but they are much too sticky  and fall apart easily.    They need to be stored in the refrigerator.  Not my idea of a good cookie - Sorry.

Just finished making these.  The only change I made was to use white (vanilla) chips instead of chocolate.  This is purely a personal preference.  I also used about 1 1/4 cups instead of 2.  The cookie itself turned out fantastic.  Yes, it is a cake-like cookie.  I'm not sure why anybody would complain about this.  I've never had a crunchy pumpkin cookie, as the pumpkin itself is going to make it cake-like. I used a cookie scoop and got about 3 dozen.  If you want to taste the pumpkin a little more, use a less cinnamon.  They do not have a strong pumpkin flavor, but it is definitely there.  Overall, no complaints about this cookie.  Good recipe.  I'll keep this one.

If I hadn't known this was a cake like cookie, I might have rated this 4 stars. I used homemade pumpkin purée and I was out of nutmeg, but will add the nutmeg next time. The cookies stay the same size you bake them, so make very small ones. I cooked them at 375 for 14 minutes but made Huge cookies. I took other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup of chocolate chips. Nuts would be great, sadly I am allergic.

Excellent soft cake-like Fall cookie! Need more like 11-12 minutes in the oven. I love the spice notes but they can tend to mask pumpkin flavor. These are simple to make and didn't last long in my house!

OMG!!  This was awesome.. first time having pumpkin choc chip cookies and kids love them!!  I ended up in a bit of a scrape as i did not have B soda or Vanilla, I replace my Bsoda with double the Bpwdr and my Vanilla extract with Butter extract..... I don't think I would change it a bit!!

Absolutely delicious! I made the recipe exactly as it says, except that I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips, and they turned out wonderfully! They are super soft and moist and don't taste too pumkiny which I loved! Definitely recommend this recipe!

I doubled the recipe, like I do with most recipes.  Not sure if this caused my problem but my cookies came out flat like a pancake and I had to bake them a lot longer than the recipe called for.  They taste good and won't go to waste...

This was my first time making pumpkin chocolate chip cookies as opposed to buying them at the store.. and these are miles above store bought! I did use milk chocolate chips because they were on sale so they were more sweet than usual, but I'm not complaining!

I exchanged melted butter for the oil(flavor, texture), I used brown sugar-(better flavor) and I also soaked raisens in hot water and added when I added the chocolate chips. I also added an additional 1/2 cup pumpkin, these are now more moist and a less cake and totally addictive!!
I find they are best served cold from the fridge with a glass of cold milk.
Enjoy!!

This is not a cookie you want to eat right out of the oven.  It is much, much better after being in the refrigerator.  

We made a batch with pumpkin puree and it turned out great.  Believe it or not, from a chocoholic, I will put in fewer chocolate chips next time and it was too overwhelming for the cookies as is.  GREAT RECIPE - husband approved!

Let's get a couple of things out of the way: 1) these are very much cake-like cookies.  Know this going in, so you don't get to come back later reviewing that these are too cake-y :).  Enjoy them for what they are.  My daughter called them muffies because they were like muffin-cookie hybrid.  2) This is really a chocolate chip recipe.  Let's face it, if you put a full bag of chocolate chips in a batch of rolled up play-doh, chocolate lovers will rejoice.  The pumpkin is NOT the feature here.  I put 5 drops of red food color in just so people would know that they weren't only chocolate chip.  We like them, but I wish pumpkin were more primary than a chocolate chip.  Edit add: Do what you can to help flatten a bit before cooking like bang the sheet on the counter to help them cook through.  Needed 12 minutes in my oven.  This is the first cookie I have ever preferred cold out of the fridge.

I made the cookies as suggested, but skipped the nuts and added 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. Also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and they came out delicious! Perfect for the holidays.

My family really likes these cookies. Like others, I switched the oil for applesauce, and for those that say there is not enough pumpkin, I ALWAYS add 1/2 cup to 1 cup extra. I like to add a bit of allspice too. 
Also, the first time we made these cookies they tasted a tiny bit weird, but we forgot to put in the vanilla the second time and they tasted a lot better.

Was in a hurry - looked easy for a festive treat. Took SOOO LONG to bake, and I threw in the full amount of chocolate chips, and it turned out to be more chocolate chip than cookie.

I did add 1 tsp each nutmeg, ginger and cloves, and made it more festive.

Next time - 375 degrees for 12-15 mins, and 1 c choc chips. Goes to show I need to read reviews before making recipes on this site!! Perfectly yummy if you adjust!!

I baked this recipe as written. The only difference I made was to set the oven at 365 degrees and bake for 12 minutes as another reviewer suggested. The cookies came out perfectly, and these are such a pretty cookie even without adding any extra food coloring. Next time I may try adding some pumpkin spice just because I think they could have used a tad more spice. However, they were gobbled up pretty fast. I am hoping that there may be one or two left for me to try tomorrow because I have a feeling they will be even better the next day when flavors have a chance to meld a bit more. They may not make it until tomorrow though. I took them to a gathering and both kids and adults liked them.

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!  Better yet, my husband loves these cookies.  He called them muffiny.  Like other reviewers suggested, I used applesauce instead of oil, only 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg and my own change I used honey instead of sugar.  SO GOOD.  I just made these for a church get together tomorrow.  If there are no leftovers (which I'm assuming there won't be) I will be making them very soon.

My review is overdue as I've been making this for quite a while.  My family loves these and in a attempt to save them for a family party, I hid them in the freezer.  Little did I know my family would find them and discover they are amazing straight out of the freezer!  They don't actually get very hard and they taste delicious!  Now my 2 year old pulls open the freezer looking for cookies. He asks for them first thing in the morning and I've made them for all kinds of events and have heard only wonderful reviews on them!  Worth making for sure!

I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil and added walnuts and oats. Pretty good flavor, but the texture was too cake-y for my tastes.

These are AMAZING. I gave some out to at least 10 different people, and the looks on their faces after taking their first bite were priceless. Half of those people immediately asked me to send them the recipe. This is definitely the recipe to follow for pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I've made them twice already, but have not tried them with the walnuts yet; however, I'm sure they are good that way as well! Pumpkin is always a great ingredient for cookies because it keeps them softer for longer, and if you like them extra soft the trick is to set the temp. 25 degrees lower. Also, these are really good on both extremes: cold or warmed up in the microwave.

The first time I made this recipe I accidentally used milk chocolate chip cookies and they were delicious. I only use the milk chocolate chips now.   I now make them for all of my kids fall activities and they get rave reviews.

Delicious!  I made some changes to the recipe: substituted Splenda in-place of sugar, used only one cup of chocolate chips (I can't imagine using 2 cups since 1 cup was plenty of chocolate), added 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice.

I didn't have the baking soda and other sites said it was okay to omit it, but something wasn't right. I am sure that was what was wrong, they kind of tasted flat. Other than that, I liked the fact that they wre very soft and moist.

I've been using this recipe for the last three years and as soon as November hits, everyone asks me if I'm making them! Everyone loves the cake-like consistency because they're not like other cookies. I sprinkle a bit of pumpkin spice in to add a bit of flavor. Also, they taste great with a bit of whipped cream!

Definitely a family tradition for years to come!

These cookies are phenomenal. A crowd pleaser for sure! I followed the recipe with a few changes: 
Bake at 365 for 9-10 minutes (if you like them more gooey than cakey!)
Cut sugar in half, or probably eve less
Substitute chocolate chips for butterscotch morsels!

These things are to die for... brought them to a party and they were gone within 10 minutes!

Loved these cookies. My day care kids kept asking for more. I did change a few things. 1) Added applesauce instead of oil. 2) Added 1 more egg yolk for a chewier texture. 3) Added about 1/2 more flour. For some reason my batter came out really runny. 4) Added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I will absolutely make these again!!

I made these without nuts and with white chocolate chips. (A friend used milk chocolate but I don't like them as much. The white chips are the way to go.) I took another reviewer's advice and cooked them at 365 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Awesome! And so good chilled in the fridge. I've shared them with friends and co-workers - the reaction is amazing. People LOVE these cookies! I'll try applesauce for oil next time. I also think you could reduce the chips by half and the sugar by 1/3 or 1/4 without losing anything from these. Great recipe!

these are sooo good... just whipped some up! they are cake-like cookies and just yummy! I did only use 1 tsp cinnamon with 1 tsp allspice and a dash of ginger (instead of 2 tsp cinnamon). I will change one thing next time: 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2, the chocolate overtakes the pumpkin, they are still great though.

Delicious! These were a hit. I did add nutmeg and allspice but used a little less cinnamon, as I love all of those flavors in my pumpkin dishes. They are amazingly melty out of the oven! These will be made again!

These had a cake-like consistency that made the cookies too moist and spongy. If you are looking for a crunchy cookie recipe or even a cookie with a moderately cakey consistency, this is not the cookie recipe for you.

Excellent recipe! I made a few modifications based on the other reviews and did a few of my own embellishments: used 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, used brown sugar instead of white, and replaced the milk with pumpkin pie liquor :). Baked for 10 mins at 375.

LOVED them!    I substituted chopped pecans and dried cranberries for the chocolate chips the 2nd time and liked them even more.   These cookies keep very well in the refrigerator with waxed paper separating the layers.

Very, very good! The only changes I made were using less cinnamon, added a bit of nutmeg, a couple drops of red food coloring, and baked at 265 for 11 minutes as another reviewer suggested. I'm in the middle of baking batches for a Halloween party this weekend and I'm positive they will be popular. I loved how they baked, as well –– perfect little round cake-like cookies (I just dropped spoonfuls), and no sticking to the cookie sheet!

I think the recipe was amazing! I followed another reviewer suggestion to bake the cookies for 12 minutes on 375. They turned out perfectly! The cookies were delicious!!! Next time I think I'll add a little less chocolate chips so that I can taste more of the pumpkin flavor.

Very delicious! I think they are missing something though...I think next time I'll add 1/8 or a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg...or maybe pumpkin pie spice instead. And yes they are cakey, as someone mentioned before: that's how I like 'em!

These taste almost exactly like the ones my grandmother makes and she is one of my favorite people ever! I used the suggestions other reviewers noted:  nutmeg, food coloring and applesauce. I'm am so happy with these and will be making them again. Oh, did I mention this is my first attempt at pumpkin choc chip? Success!

I made these and they don't taste like cookies at all. After the first batch I decided to form them into a bread pan, because they taste way more like a bread. However, it didn't taste very good that way either. I would not recommend these.

These cookies were great.  I did add/experiment with a few things.  I added some nutmeg and cloves like someone suggested to get that fall flavor a little better and I also did half my batch with chocolate chip like was suggested and I did half with butterscotch chips.  Personally I like the butterscotch ones better than the chocolate ones but they both came out tasting delicious.

These were by far THE BEST PUMPKIN COOKIES EVER! 
**I used Almond Milk and Coconut Oil**
So soft and the chocolate chips were soft and kinda melty even the next day..HUGE HIT!

Very good cookie, very cake-like. I used canned pumpkin pie mix I had and omitted the cinnamon and added applesauce instead of oil and they turned out very nice. I didn't add nuts and added m and m's for more color instead of chocolate chips.

These were pretty good, but a little more cake-like than I was expecting. Like others, I made them a little healthier by using 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, as well as 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and fewer chips. The flavor was good, not too sweet.

Incredible!! Outrageously good.  I made this one night, woke up the next morning and they were almost gone.  My parents and brother gobbled them up so quickly.  I've never ate a cookie so soft and moist, that truly falls into your mouth.  My favorite cookie ever.

This is a fall staple at home. Like others have mentioned, these cookies are very cakey but taste excellent. Because of the texture, they don't keep as well as other cookies, but they will be gone quicker too.

I nearly doubled the recipe so that I could use the whole can of pumpkin.  Ended up using two eggs, which made them real soft and cakey.  These were delicious!  We ate half the batch before we were done!  Omitted walnuts and used what little chopped pecans I had left.  Wonderful!  Thanks!

Wow!  Yummy cookies!!  I, like many, reduced the vanilla to 2 tsp.  I baked at 375 for 12-13 minutes and my little adjustment was to use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Used closer to 1 cup and the smaller size distributed the chocolate throughout the cookies.  YUM!

I've made these three times now, though I've doubled the recipe each time since I make big cookies using a ice cream scoop. They are definitely cake-like, but that's why we like them so much. I did use more pumpkin and less oil in my recipe because my dad loves pumpkin, and instead of just using cinnamon, I used quite a dash of pumpkin pie spice too. I cooked them at a higher temp of 370 and just watched for them to get "cracked" on top with some firmness in the center of the cookie. :D Just right, nom nom nom!

We just got done making these and they are the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookies we've ever had.  I used half the amount of chocolate chip and they were still a big hit.  They were moist like a cake but crunchy on the outside...go for it and make them!

Fantastic Cookies!  They come out "cakey" and baked for a bit longer than noted in this recipe...I added more chocolate chips and a bit more pumpkin than called for as well to give it a bit of a punch!  Enjoyed by all in my house :) Will make again!

This recipe is really good.  I made it last night and doubled the recipe.  I used half wheat flour and half all-purpose.  I also used half vegetable oil and half applesauce.  I used 3 1/2 t cinnamon and 1 t each of cloves, ginger and nutmeg (keep in mind that I doubled the recipe).  I also added some red food coloring as others suggested.  I cooked them at 365 for 12 1/2 minutes.  Next time I make this, I will use about the same amount of cinnamon, but will cut in half the amount of the other 3 spices.  The cookies are awesome, but the spices are a bit overwhelming.  I also think I will reduce the amount of chocolate chips I use by maybe one fourth.  Call me weird, but I think they are a bit too chocolatey.  I love the taste and texture of the pumpkin and think it would be a bit more enjoyable with a little less of the chocolate chips. Overall, though, fantastic recipe!

Delish. If you know what you are getting (cake like pumkinish cookies) then they are perfect. Added 4 drops red food coloring, some pumpkin pie spice, and subbed applesauce for the oil. I also used 1/2 white flour, and 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour. DELISH

These cookies are just ok.  I followed directions and ingredients exactly as written.  Maybe I am just not a fan of "cake" like cookies...  My husband also said they are just "ok".  I really don't understand how these got such high stars.  Oh well, better luck next time.

Delicious recipe!  I did add about 8 drops of red food coloring to give the cookies a more orangy appearance.  I also added 1 tsp. each allspice and nutmeg.  I omitted the nuts.  The texture is definitely cake-like, and they do get soggy when kept in a sealed container so I would recommend, as the other cooks do, to either serve them warm right from the oven or refrigerate them.  Thank you again for a great recipe that I shared with co-workers.

Love the cake-like texture of these cookies. I agree with all the reviewers: add 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of nutmeg for a slight hint of more spicyness. The recipe calls for one cup pumpkin...I bought a 12 ounce can and ended up just putting the whole thing in.  I think that it was about 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin, but it didn't change anything about the taste.  Also, 2 Cups of chocolate chips is a bit much...next time I will try just 1 cup and see if that brings out the flavor of the pumpkin a bit more.  These do cook better at 365 for 12 minutes. I plan on making these a regular cookie at my house...they are just fab!

THese are wonderful fall cookies! I did add a little bit of red food coloring to make them more festive. Also, to make them a little healthier, I used cinnamon applesause instead of oil and cut the sugar in half. Then just used a little over a tsp. of cinnamon.  Also added 1/4 tsp cloves and nutmeg. THis makes a big batch of cookies and I was afraid we would not be able to eat them all. Not a problem. They are really good refridgerated.

I was uncertain what a pumpkin cookie might taste like, but I was pleasantly surprised! These are very moist and the chocolate chip-pumpkin combination is wonderful! I did use milk chocolate chips and was happy with the results. I also will note the cookie batter was pretty sticky so I had to use a cookie scoop rather than my hands. I recommend flattening them down a bit a they don't spread out much. Other than that they came out perfect after 10 minutes. Only other change I would make would be to maybe add another teaspoon of cinnamon because I like that extra spice, but enough in it already to taste. Thanks for the recipe! Will make again some day.

My family LOVED these cookies.  I too tweeked the recipe just a bit.  I added more spices.....some nutmeg, ginger and all spice as well as the cinnamon.  I added white chocolate chips, along with the walnuts.  I baked them at 365 for 13 minutes. Delish!!!  I will be making more very soon.

Ive made these a few times.  First with recipe as written and we liked them a lot.  My favorite version is replacing the oil with applesauce, adding a few drops of red coloring, and using cinnamon chips instead of chocolate.

Well, it *is* cake-like.  I was somewhat disappointed because I was expecting this crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle chocolate chip cookie.  If this is the type of cooking you're wanting/expecting with pumpkin flavor, you might as well go with a traditional chocolate chip cookie and a slice of pumpkin pie on the side ;)  The only thing I did was use only a half cup of brown sugar instead of the full cup of white sugar.  Doing so deepened the cookie's color and didn't mask the actual pumpkin goodness.  The family liked them and DH's grandmother has requested more for Thanksgiving (pumpkin is her absolute favorite flavor ... of anything lol).

These are pretty tasty but I hate getting near the end of the batter and there are no chocolate chips left!  If/when I make these again, I will use 3 cups of chocolate chips and definitely make with the nuts.  Also, I will sandwich these with vanilla ice cream and freeze for a heartier treat!  Yum!

I thought they turned out amazing! I did change a few things; first of all I used 1.25 cups of FRESH pumpkin puree, 1tsp of allspice and 1tsp cinnamon, half semisweet chips and half caramel swirl chips, and cooked them about 13-14 minutes. Such a great fall treat, and made a believer out of someone who doesn't even like pumpkin!

Short review: Great cookies, but READ THE REVIEWS HERE FIRST!!!!  You'll pick up many tips which will make the cookies FABULOUS!    Long Review:   These cookies were AMAZING!  I, too, altered the recipe after reading all the other reviews.  I used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown (though next time I will use just brown sugar) in place of just white sugar, 1/2 cup of butter in place of the oil, just under 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon each of clove, nutmeg and ginger, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and about 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips.  We also added 4 drops of red food colouring.    I'm glad I made half of the batch without chocolate chips!  The ones without the chips were INSANELY AMAZING!  They didn't last more than 15 minutes.  We used mini chocolate chips and very few of them, but the chocolate still seemed to overpower all of the other flavours.  We actually still have a couple of the chocolate chip ones left.    I added the vanilla and food colouring to the wet mixture when I put the egg in, rather than put them in at the end.  I also baked them at 365 for 10-12 minutes and flattened them 2 minutes before taking them out, which made them more cookie-like.    Overall, very good cookies after you alter the recipe!  I will DEFINITELY be making these again for our big Halloween party, but without the chocolate chips.

My kids liked this cookie, but I prefer eating either pumpkin bread or chocolate chip cookies.  I thought that the flavor combination was strange.  I also was not used to a cookie being cakey.  The texture reminded me of the ricotta cookies I made before.  I agree with other reviewers that the amount of chocolate chips should be decreased.  I made this with 1/2 C white sugar, 1/2 C brown sugar.  I also used 1 C white flour and 1 C whole wheat flour.  I used 1.5 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/8 t clove, and 1/8 t ground ginger.

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years, since I was in middle school.  The only change I make is to use butter instead of the oil.  Moist, cake-like cookie with just the right amount of spice.  I used mini chocolate chips this time so there is a little bite of chocolate in every bite.

I reduce the sugar, used whole wheat flour, and subbed applesauce for the oil. I am still giving it a 5 because I do these things every time I bake, and the recipe is solid. I also add a bit of allspice and nutmeg. Yummy!

These are worth more then 5 stars. These are by far the best Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies I have ever had. So moist and soft and just the right amount of cakeness. I did tweek it to my liking by using all whole wheat flour, honey, and pumpkin pie spice. Oh sooooo good. I also used less chocolate chips just because I like less. These are my new favorite cookie. Thank you, thank you, thank you Jennifer!!!!!!!

These cookies tasted nice, but they baked up more like a muffin top than a cookie. They also didn't store well - they were very soft and floppy, and stuck together quite a bit. The choco chips also seemed a bit heavy for the cookie, which was airy and light. This is also not something you could pick up and eat with one hand, they would fall all to pieces. This gets 3 stars for flavor, but the consistency needs work in my opinion - either to be adapted to a muffin/cupcake or to a "proper" cookie.

These are 'okay' cookies.  They get 3 stars because after the first batch I had to add spices in myself, they were VERY bland before this and bordered on 1 star.  I was lucky to have pumpkin pie spice on hand so I didn't have to individually add in all the recommended ones.  This also says it yields 2 dozen but I'm wondering what size cookies the original poster was making, were they for bigfoot?  If you go by standard sizes and not super sizes our country is based on, this single recipe can yield up to 4 dozen cookies but if you are looking to follow exactly, your cookies will be huge.  Again saying it's an 'okay' recipe because it would make a better 'blondie brownie' type recipe than a 'cakie cookie'.  Cakie cookies aren't popular amongst children and the masses but put in the right setting (ie brownie-type) I can see them quickly gobbled up (again if you add spices so they can have flavor).  Another thing, ALWAYS add flour last regardless of what the recipe calls for, this is baker's knowledge.  Adding fluids to the flour batter prior to combining all ingredients together only gives you a rough batter and harder cookies (or cake, etc).

I used this recipe, but I used organic everything instead of regular. I made no changes to measurements, and they come out absolutely outstanding.  I make a triple batch at least twice a month!  This cookie has become a family favorite.  My kids love them, my boyfriend loves them, and his son absolutely loves them.

These were delicious! A host who wanted me to make desserts for a shared meal said she had loved the cookies and wanted me to make more, but didn't want chocolate. So instead of chips I sprinkled pumpkin spice into the mixture, making it taste a lot like pie.

These are so easy and good!  It's very easy to under-bake them, and really hard to tell if they're done - I usually don't know until they've been out of the oven for a few minutes.  We like them better a little under-baked, but I wouldn't really want to serve them to guests that way.  I also use mini semisweet chocolate chips, and only use about 1 1/2 cups.

This was really delicious, but I wished that the pumpkin came through a little stronger. Will make it again for sure.

This recipe is so good. Even when I adapt it for my dietary needs (egg replacer, flour replacer) it still works out so well!

THESE COOKIES ARE AWESOME, I EVEN HAVE MADE THEM SUGAR FREE & MY CO-WORKERS STILL LOVED THEM, THEY ARE REALLY GOOD IF YOU ALSO MIX HALF PUMPKIN PIE FILLING & HALF CANNED PUMPKIN GIVES THEM A SOFTER TEXTURE, BUT JUST COOK THEM A MIN OR SO LONGER.  YOU CAN ALSO MAKE THEM INTO MUFFINS TOO.  BUT THESE COOKIES ARE MY FAVORITE SO FAR

I took other reviewers' suggestions and added a little nutmeg and ginger. These were excellent cake-like cookies; very soft and moist. If I make these in the future, I will probably use mini chocolate chips because the regular sized morsels seemed to be a bit too big for some reason. Otherwise, this is a pretty good recipe.

The flavor was good (especially with some added spices) but these spread out a lot, and I didn't want to serve them to company.

These were super yummy!  I took the advice of someone else and replaced the oil with applesauce and they came out really moist and delicious!  I used mini chocolate chips and only used a single cup of them, two cups would have been a chocolate chip overload. :)  I also added some ginger, nutmeg, and cloves which gave them an extra nice taste.  This is worth making again!

Made these over the weekend to use up the last of my pumpkin, three-fourthed the recipe. I didn't add the extra two tablespoons of oil but followed the rest of the recipe pretty exact. Even with adding a dash of different spices, the pumpkiny flavor was barely there. "Tastes like a normal chocolate chip cookie but puffy an soft." Not what I was going for..But they all disapeared in the morning!! I'd put twenty or so away before bed an when I got up, GONE. Maybe they got better overnight. I think I'll keep trying PCCC recipes though. Thanks for posting!! They WERE good an clearly many love them. =) UPDATE:: Since making a different recipe an comparing, both my brothers preferred this one..so five stars it shall be!! I liked the other better..[[Pumpkin chip Cookies]]

Super good!  I made the cookies exactly as the recipe suggested, except that I baked them for 12-13 min. instead of 10 minutes.  They turned out perfect!  I would agree with a lot of the reviewers that the texture of the cookies are more of a cake texture than cookie texture.  The taste is still excellent though.  I actually enjoyed the cookies more after they sat through the night.  Very yummy!  I will have to bake them for thanksgiving or Christmas.  Thanks for the recipe and all the reviews, it was very helpful in me making my decision in making them or not!

***Just made these cookies again!  They still taste amazing!

I was so excited to make these cookies after reading all of the great reviews.  But unfortunately I'm underwhelmed.  I think they're okay, but nothing amazing like most of the reviews suggest.  Bummer.

Yep, theses cookies are by far the best of any pumpkin chip I've ever had. Truthfully, I think they're now my favorite cookie. I did make a few small tweaks. First, add a tsp or more of pumpkin spice, it really helps change it from good to amazing. Second, I've found this cookie is so great why just enjoy it one way? So, I separate my batter into three bowls. Into the largest portion I add a lot of white chocolate chips - once baked these are best eaten cold straight out of the refrigerator. The second portion of batter gets milk chocolate chips - this is my husband’s favorite and it also great straight out of the fridge or nuked in the microwave for like 20 seconds. The third batter gets semi-sweet chocolate and these are by far best when heated in the microwave (again for like 20 seconds) so that the chocolate is gooey. I do store all of them in a covered container in the refrigerator. Be generous when adding your chocolate chips, more definitely is better and I'm a person who usually uses less than recommended for traditional chocolate chip cookies, but the cookie consistency and pumpkin flavor really are best when paired with the chocolate. Enjoy!!

This is the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookie I have ever eaten.  After reading the reviews I did make some modifications.  I used 1/2 cup applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp allspice.  I also cut the cinnamon in half.  The are more cake like, but sooo yummy.

I would not really call this a cookie, much like the other reivews I agree about them tasting more like a cake. But I love them. I think next time I would bake this in a bread pan and put a light iceing ontop or a small muffin pan. I make pumkin Cookies every year for our pumkin carving party and they are a hit every time I look forward in useing this recipe again

These cookies are great.  Everyone loved them.  I did take the reviewers' advice and baked them at 365 degrees for about 12 minutes.  I did cook them on parchment paper. I doubled the recipe and it came out fine.  The only thing, and I'm glad it turned out that way, I didn't have enough chocoloate chips for 4 cups so I only used about 2-1/2 cups.  It was more than enough chocolate.  I can't imagine anymore chocolate in them.  They are a cake type cookie so don't expect any crunch.

These are amazing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked them longer than the recommended time (about 12-14 minutes). I also cut down on the cinnamon since others said it was overpowering, but I think the full amount would have added extra spice, which I think was needed. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, but will use the semi-sweet next time. And yes, these are much cakier than most cookies, so much so that I bet they'd also make great muffins.

Tasty and easy. I used pumpkin pie filling (the kind with all the spices added already) rather than canned pumpkin, just because that's what I had on hand. I followed all other ingredients exactly. Per other reviewer's recommendations, I cooked them at 375 rather than 350. They turned out great! Very flavorful and had a great color.

When making these I was concerned at first because the dough seemed to have a consistancy more like a brownie batter than a cookie dough. However it held it's shape very well on the baking sheet didn't spread at all while baking. My cookies turned out very fluffy and delicious. There are worth trying!

These were so-o-o-o YUMMY! I didn't have any applesauce or oil, so I ended up melting butter to substitute and I didn't notice any difference.  My oven bakes hot, so I kept the temperature of 350 and baked for 11 minutes and they turned out perfect. I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting to go on top for some added calories, and they were divine.

I really like the texture of these cookies, I just think they could use more spices than cinnamon.  Next time I will add some nutmeg and/or pumpkin pie spice to the 2 tsp cinnamon.

Fantastic! I altered the recipe to my taste and made cookie bars. I took these to my community group and they were gobbled up so quickly! Even my picky husband liked them. And here's the strange thing -- I liked them because I love pumpkin. DH liked them because he felt like they weren't too "pumpkin-y." Go figure. My Changes: Used a whole can of pumpkin (seemed silly to waste half the can, plus I like the taste of pumpkin); I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and this yielded a good flavor and color; doubled the cinnamon; also, I just added the baking soda to the dry ingredients, I didn't see any need to dissolve it in milk. Worked fine for me. I spread it in a greased 9x11 glass pan and baked at 350 degrees for twelve minutes. My oven runs hot, so ten minutes may be enough for most. They turned out great!

Very tasty!  A great balance of the pumpkin flavor and the chocolate.  I would recommend NOT waiting until they feel "firm" to take them out of the oven, because if you let them cool on the sheet they firm up.  But besides that, the recipe was great!

Since I became allergic to dairy and soy, I've been looking all over for cookie recipes that don't use any butter, margarine (contains milk products) or shortening (contains soy oil). I omitted the little bit of milk it called for, and it was still perfect. This recipe saved me! Thanks for sharing.

I have made these cookies over 20 times for family and friends. I can't tell you enough how much everyone has truly enjoyed these! They are moist -- and stay moist for up to 3 days! They are soft and chewy, definitely my most favorite cookie recipe of all time. I double this recipe nearly every time I make it and they come out great.

I love this recipe!!! It is a now a must have at company potlucks. I usually let my mixer run with the pumpkin, sugar, eggs, and oil while I mix all of the other ingredients together. It just makes them a little fluffier. Again, love this recipe!!!

These cookies are bland, UNLESS you substitute applesauce for the oil as several others have said. If the original recipe called for applesauce and not oil, I would give these a 5.

I made these with white chocolate chips instead, but I'm sure they were every bit as delicious as the regular chocolate chips! They definitely are best straight out of the fridge, and very fluffy and cakey. Delicious!

love, love, love.  My kids eat them up like crazy- and with a cup of pumpkin they aren't too unhealthly.  I substitute a 1/4 cup applesauce for half of the oil and you would never know the difference.  A keeper.

These were GREAT! After reading many of the reviews, I did cut the the cinnamon down to 1 tsp and then added 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I also added 3 drops of red food coloring, simply for a more "pumpkin" look.  Also, I baked these at 365 degrees for 12 minutes and they were PERFECT.  Husband gave them a 10 out of 10 which is a huge rating for him!

These were the hit of our bake sale at work.  They are definitely a different consistency - more like a pumpkin bread.  And I was afraid there was going to be too much chocolate, but a lot of chocolate really helps make them sweet.  Yummy!

This is a good recipe however, if you're a pumpkin freak like me and love everything pumpkin I would suggest adding less chocolate chips. The chocolate chips are a little too over powering.

I love them! I added homemade applesauce (boiled apples with water and cinnamin and lemon juice) instead of oil.  I replaced 1/2 cup of oil for the applesauce.  Next time I am going to try to make them gluten free.

These cookies are wonderful. I would reduce the chocolate chips by half when I make my next batch as they are too strong for the sponge texture and flavor of this cookie.

I just made these and ate about six when they came out of the oven. They are so good! The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Next time I will add ground cloves as well. They have a light fluffy consistency. The pumpkin flavor is not very strong. But, pumpkins don't taste that great anyway—it's the spices that go with them that make them good!

These cookies were a big hit with my family. Everyone loved them. these cookies are very unusual because of using oil instead of butter. the cookies come out more like muffins or bread texture then cookies. either way they were a big hit!! I cooked them on parchment paper so that they would not sick. thanks

A hit at the church Halloween party!  I used pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon to give it a more "pumpkiny" taste.  Also left the walnuts out due to allergies but no one seemed to miss them.  They will definitely be back on my table next fall!

With 2 small exceptions, followed the recipe exactly!  This cookie is my husband's new favorite and he's eaten 5 of them in the last hour!  Instead of the 2 c. of chocolate chips, I used 1 c. of white chocolate chips and 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  I also added 2 drops of red food coloring.  They're a nice cakey consistency and perfect for cool weather days.  I'll be making these many times to come!

These were SO deliciously addictive!  My only warning would be that by no stretch of the imagination could this recipe only make '12 servings'...I read that, and since I was making these for my 1st grader's Halloween party, I decided to double it (from other reviews I read, I didn't double the cinnamon, only put in slightly more than the single recipe called for, and I also followed another reviewer's advice and used chocolate mini-chips, both of which worked great).  Anyway, I ended up with probably 80 cookies of various sizes...some about tablespoon sized (for the kids party), some about twice that size, and some that were about as large as my palm...they all came out to the same cake-like consistency, which I loved!  My kids thought they were like a cross between a cookie and a muffin.  Oh, also, I did as another reviewer suggested and added a couple drops of red food coloring to make the cookie dough a little more orange.  Fantastic recipe, I'm sure these will be asked for a few more times before the end of the year!

These were ok.  They needed to cook a bit longer, about 15 minutes, and they are very dark looking, I assume because of the spices. They taste good, like pumpkin bread with chocolate chips.  They weren't very "pretty" cookies.

These are awesome! Like another reviewer I created more of a pumpkin pie spice mixture as opposed to just using cinnamon and baked at about 365 for 12 minutes.  As soon as the batter is mixed they're fine to bake but they came out much better after letting the batter sit in the fridge for a day. This made it easier to drop/mold into cookie shapes and to flatten them slightly. If they're cooked according to the recipe they would probably make decent muffins. The spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, allspice) really brought out the pumpkin flavor and went well with the chocolate chips and walnuts.

I read the reviews before I baked these and decided to bake it as a cake.  It is better if you use only 3/4 cup of chocolate chips, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves.  There is no way these would have turned out as cookies for me.  I'm glad I cooked it as a cake.  To me it's like pumpkin bread with chocolate mixed in.  I baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Very yummy.  Would make great holiday gifts for family and friends.

These tasted good, but I wouldn't call them cookies. They were too cake-like. They were more like cake-kies! I decreased the amount of chocolate chips because 2 cups was waaaay too much. Next time I'll probably put more pumpkin in because it hardly tasted like pumpkin.

Great recipe.  To keep the pumpkin flavor I just used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice plus to additional shakes for good measure.  :o)  I recommend that you bake them until they're nearly done, let them sit on the pan for a few minutes out of the oven to prevent them drying out (they'll continue to cook some), then cool and put in fridge.  yum yum.  If you like this type of soft, cake-like cookie BE SURE to try the Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip cookie recipe on this website.  Trust me you won't regret it!  :o)

This is a great "fall" cookie.  I did make a few modifications.  Instead of canned pumpkin I used fresh and substitued olive oil for the veg oil. I also added nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and used less cinn.  I used special dark chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts.  Before baking I used a glass dipped in sugar, a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg and GENTLY pressed the cookie (something my grandma used to do).  They look beautiful and tasted even better!  I turned the temp up on the oven as well.

I found these to be just okay (a 3) and my husband loved them so I averaged and gave it a 4.  I like my cookies to be like cookies, so these were just too muffiny for me, and the pumpkin/spice flavor in them wasn't strong enough for our taste.  If I make these again, I'll put in more of the spices, but my husband loves them just the way they are.  He ate about 20 of them.

My husband is diabetic and I’m on a right carb diet so I made these changes to meet our diet and enjoy with out any guilt. I used whole wheat, splenda, and applesauce in place of the original ingredients. I ran out of semi sweet choc. Chip so I used butterscotch morsels. Yummie. This is for sure worth saving and making again and sharing with family, friend and workplace

These were really good cookies!  Yes, they are very cake-like.  I did add 1/2 tsp of ginger and nutmeg to the dry mix.  I also baked them for 15 minutes at 365 degrees.  I used a cookie scoop, so they were not flat at all.  Oh, I also cut the cinnamon in half.

I made these according to the recipe, except I ran out of white flour and used half wheat flour. They did not taste right to me, maybe too much cinnamon or maybe it was the whole wheat flour.

We love these cookies in the fall - around Halloween, we like to put the dough on the baking sheet, spreading it slightly so it is round, and then add a little bit of dough to the side like the stem of a pumpkin.  When cool, we like to frost with cream cheese frosting, adding a little green food coloring when we frost the stem - and then we decorate the face:  Red Hots eyes, M&M mouth, and candy corn nose - so cute and absolutely delicious - very moist.

These were easy to make and taste wonderful! I used 1C white and 1C Whole wheat flour instead of 2C white flour.  Also used 1t cinnamon, 1/2t cloves, 1/2t nutmeg instead of 2t cinnamon. As another reviewer suggested, I also added 3 drops red food coloring. Great recipe!

I really liked these, and they were well recieved by others.  Very cakey, which I liked, with a nice flavor.  However, I did half the cinnamon and add nutmet, ginger and cloves.  Also, I had to add more flour because the first batch I cooked flattened out way too much.  But with those changes, very good. Will make again.

Yummy.  Definitely needs more than 10 minutes in the oven (I also did 365 for 15 minutes as suggested.)  Would make again.

Yes I like Pumpkin, and chocolate, and spice.... but these turned out like dense, wet lumps.  I was running out of time and ideas to take to work for Thanksgiving and ended up taking half this recipie....and they didn't touch them.  A few people said they were okay but they needed a hefty glass of water to swallow them down because they are so dense.  Never again.

These were a huge hit at my house!  My 4-year old helped me make them and the recipe was very easy for me to make with her.  They were very yummy, though I would add some extra spices next time.

These were tasty cookies, but I didn't like the cake like texture, also noted by previous reviewers.

I made twelve cookies before putting chocolate chips in, and those were much tastier than the cookies that had chips. I might use the recipe again, without the chocolate since they remind me of the chewy cookie texture that this recipe lacks.

I went to a pumpkin festival with my daughter on saturday. They were selling these cookies at a little booth. I was immediately hooked and i found this recipe the very next day. These are the best cookies i have ever had in my entire life. I now have everybody hooked. They are supposed to be soft and cake like. I will be making these on a regular basis or my family will disown me.

Through the years, these cookies have been an autumn favorite in my family.  This recipe is perfect. The texture of the cookie is soft, but not so soft as to be muffin-like.  They are still firm enough to be a good, packable cookie. Although I wouldn't change the recipe itself, I would change the baking temp to 365, as in a previous review.  10 minutes was perfect for me, with two cookie trays in a convection oven.  One bonus with this style of cookie- the cookies DO NOT spread that much at all, so you can bake more on one tray.  And with two large trays in the oven, I made the whole batch at once.

Excellent recipe. Easy to make and somewhat healthy too. I used 1/2 brown sugar and replaced one tsp of cinnamon with nutmeg. I tried raisins in some and chocolate chips in others and both raisins and chocolate chips in the final batch.  We enjoyed them all. They were moist and went well with a cup of tea. Thank you for the recipe.

I just made this recipe tonight, and I couldn't stop eating the cookies. The cookies were moist and flavorful.
I did make some alterations to the recipe though.  
I used 1/2 cup of clover honey instead of 1 cup white sugar.
I used 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of 1/2 cup oil.
I used 1 cup all purpose flour AND 1 cup whole wheat flour.
Also, I halved the batter. In one half, I only used the cinnamon to spice the batter.  In the other half, I used nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and ginger in addition to the cinnamon. 
I personally liked the addition of these other spices best.  Especially the cloves.
I think next time I will try to include cardamom or nuts.
Also, I would like to try molasses as a sweetner next time...or orange blossom honey (which actually tastes like oranges). 
This recipe is easy to make and delicious.

I agree these aren't really cookies but it's a nice change if you're up for a different texture. Actually I can't speak to the exact recipe because instead of using oil I used 1/2 cup of applesauce. The result is a cake-like, very moist, yet chewy kind of cookie. My 2 yr old and my husband loved it especially warm!  And since I used applesauce instead of oil it's not greasy at all.  I will probably make this again!

This is the first recipe I tried off this site. So delicious! Everyone loves them and asks for the recipe. Most people have never had a pumpkin cookie before but they love them. I brought them to a Halloween party and people thought I was a professional.

IF you reduce the amount of chocolate chips and IF one adds more spices (nutmeg, ginger, pumpkin pie spice etc.) these cookies might be good.  This recipe, as is, is pretty tasteless, and too much chocolate chips.  I don't understand why those that change the recipe then rate it 5 stars?

These Cookies are amazing. I followed the suggestion of others by adding only 1 c. chocolate chips. I didnt do much altering to the recipes other than adding only 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. pumpkin spice. These are by far the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookie I've had. I'll make them again.

I made these to take to church and everyone loved them!!  I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned and I added a little bit of nutmeg also.

These were the perfect pumpkin chocolate chip cookie! The only addition I made was to add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. I made them last night, and they are almost gone. Now I need to make another double batch...off to the store for some more pumpkin. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good if your looking for a muffin top type cookie. Not my favorite type of cookie but the recipe delivers. The pumpkin flavor isn't extremely strong but they are good. I added a bit of nutmeg and only used 1 cup of the chips. These are also much better after the chips have had a chance to harden.

I was disappointed in the lack of pumpkin flavor. I think they would be better with pumpkin pie spices as well.

Kind of cakey and very good.  They seem to taste better with age, but they get too moist and sticky after a while. so you can't wait too long.  The next day after baking these were amazing!

After reading other reviews, I was expecting the consistency, which certainly was a kind of cakey like texture.  I also put in the fridge and the next day they did taste better because the choc chips were solid (instead of melty). Second time I made these I added 1 tblsp pumpkin pie seasoning and that REALLY brought out the flavor of pumpkin.  Great recipe!! UPDATE: I made Cream Cheese Frosting II and put on top. HEAVENLY!

Very good cookie.  I used mini chocolate chips and whole wheat flour - but only because I had no white flour.  I think the flavor improves after they cool off and sit for a while.  The texture is almost like a very soft mini muffin (at least that's what I told myself after eating 3 for breakfast!)

A great moist cookie. Perfect right out of the fridge, with milk. I tried several different sizes and decided that I like the rounded half tablespoon size best. One 15 oz can of pumpkin is about 1 3/4 cups and I have a hard time using up extra pumpkin so I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 cup banana to make up the difference. Also, I drastically reduced the chocolate chips. I think substituting mini chocolate chips might improve the cookie a bit.

These were pretty good.  I should have cut down the chocolate chips to 1 cup, 2 cups is way to many.  I also added a little more vanilla and nutmeg.  I would have given it 5 had the chocolate chips not overwhelmed them.

These were definitely more like muffins than like cookies, but they were awesome.  They tasted just like the one I bought at Whole Foods that I was trying to recreate when I searched for the recipe. :)

they turned out really yummy. i used only 3/4 cup sugar, apple sauce instead of veg. oil, 2 egg whites, dash cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 3/4 cup white chocolate chips... this definitely will cut out some fats/unnecessary calories!!!

I love these cookies and so does everyone I've ever given them to.
They're soft, yummy and rich.  I add a pinch of nutmeg to the batter, but I've made them without it and they are still fantastic.

I love the Halloween-like contrast with the dark chocolate and the orange pumpkin! As someone else said, these cookies are amazing if you eat them cold right out of the fridge. I will make these again.

It's very different from regular chocolate chip cookies. They have a different kind of chewiness about them. I made an error of putting only half the chocolate chips in and it was definitely enough. I followed the advice of another review and added 3 drops of red food coloring. I think it could even use more (like 5 drops).

These cookies are heaven. I'm not normally a fan of cakey cookies, but I can't get enough of these. Made to recipe, with a dash of nutmeg. Turned out great! I also had to squish them down a little. Thanks for the great cookies!

This is the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookie that I've ever tasted, but I still wish it tasted just a little more pumpkin-y! I cut down the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons then used a few dashes of ground cloves and ground nutmeg. I also used 1/2 stick melted butter and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. I think my additional spices gave it a more pumpkin pie type flavor. Next time I may use the entire can of pumpkin with half white and half brown sugar and a packet of instant pudding mix to dry it out a little more.

Great cookie- very moist, soft in texture. Instead of white flour, I used 100% whole wheat. Kids and family loved it too. The pumpkin is not over-powering, very light. Only used 1.5 cups of chocolate chips.

This is an excellent cookie.  Although they are cakey & more like muffin tops they are great.  I have made them twice in the past week....to share of course.  My family and friends love them.  The second time I did subsitute applesauce for oil and they where just as yummy.  I followed the recipe and it made 24 good size cookies.  So I'm hoping the nutritional info is off since it's based on 12 servings or maybe a serving is two cookies.

These are very delicious.  However, they're more cake-like than I expected.  They stay orange and pumpkin colored and are really lovely.  I used just one cup of chips, half chocolate and half white chocolate.  A really tasty cookie - and you're getting some vegetables, too!

I replaced the oil with applesauce used extra pumpkin and omitted the chocolate chip cookies, and my diet conscious father and I absolutely loved these chewy babies! However, I only gave it four stars because a few days after I made these some weird liquid that resembled corn syrup was oozing out of the cookies ruining the remaining few. I had frozen this dough beforehand in a log shape, and just sliced it and baked it when ready, but I don't see how that could cause that to happen. If anyone knows what might have caused the oil separation or whatever it was, please tell me how to prevent it! I love these cookies too much to have to waste the last few. I suppose I could always just finish them faster :P

I agree with the other reviews they do have a cake like texture. I made minor changes to reduce calories, 406 a cookie OUCH! So I used Splenda and applesauce in place of oil. Very good!

I substituted half the oil with unsweetened applesauce (isn't that one of the best tricks ever?), decreased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and definitely added chopped walnuts. I decreased the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup, and glad I did -- the chocolate has a tendency to overpower the pumpkin and spices. As the original recipe notes, they are better cold -- helps the spice flavors come through. Next time, and there will be a next time, as these are yummy, I will use white chocolate instead of semi-sweet dark. I served these to my students (they are adults), and there were polite raves all around, but my husband and I loved them. A sophisticated cookie! Thanks so much! Update: made again and substituted white chocolate for semi-sweet, and over-baked them a bit -- we loved this version, as the white chocolate didn't compete with the spices as the chocolate had.

These are FANTASTIC!  We used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup ceresota flour.  We used applesauce instead of vegetable oil.  We also added some pumpkin pie spice and a bit extra cinnamon.  They were good out of the oven, but once they have cooled completely they are PHENOMINAL!  The pumpkin taste really stands out.  They are soft and a bit "cakey".  They far exceeded our expectations after reading a few disappointed reviewers.

(Adjust to 21 servings to use exactly one small can of pumpkin) I've probably made these at least 15 times over the past 3 years... all because my boyfriend keeps requesting them! They're soft, almost muffin-like, with a mild sweetness (also like a muffin)! I think they're great with walnuts too. They always get devoured. And I tried keeping them in the freezer as a deterrent to eating them... but they taste great frozen too!

Cake-like. The stars I give to this recipe are deceptive. I can't review without rating, which is not fair because I didn't follow it to the letter. I played around and added clove, nutmeg, raisins and pumpkin seeds. I punched up the flavor and the aroma. I didn't have as many choco- chips as called for either.
I used the measurements as stated for everything else. I like this recipe as a base for the cookies I ended up making and I will use this recipe as a guide again.

My family always looks forward to the Holidays b/c a supermarket will start to sell their pupmkin chocolate chip cookies. My family tasted these and we will never but them again. I had to make two more batches because the first disappeared so quickly not every one got to taste.
I did add a T. of Pumkpin Pie Spice and a tad bit more cinammon. I also used my Pampered Chef scooper and they came out looking like they came from a bakery.
Thanks for the recipe.

This is a great cookie - and I love that it uses heart-healthy vegetable oil. My only suggestion is that the recipe needs more spice. The second time, I added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg - a big improvement!  Using pumpkin pie spice might also be a good idea. I love the texture of these cookies, and how easy they are to make.

I made these at Christmas and they were a huge hit.  My favorite part is they stay moist and chewy, much longer than my traditional toll house cookies, which make them perfect for gift giving too!  My son's daycare teacher said this recipe was better than the ones her mother has made for years! Delicious!

My roommate and I went to a pot luck several weeks ago and brought these cookies with us.  *Luckily* we saved a few and left them at home because they were eaten in record time by our friends.  We made some slight modifications per other reviewers' suggestions.  We used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of two of the latter and we also used milk chocolate chips.  At first we were concerned that they were undercooked but the firm up when the cool.  They are fabulous cold with a glass of milk. Several people at the pot luck tried to recreate them (with other recipes) on their own but said ours were better. This recipe makes delicious cookies!

Yummy! They turned out as a soft round, fat, cake-like cookie.  I liked that they called for a liquid fat rather than a solid one-- more heart healthy.  The pumpkin also tosses in a good dose of Vitamin A-- a cookie with less guilt!    I did alter the recipe by using 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, added a little ginger and nutmeg, and used pecans instead of walnuts.  I used a small scoop (1 1/2 tb) and this recipe made about 5 dozen cookies. I think, with their more delicate texture, they would have been good with mini chips.  My kids loved them.   I had a hard time keeping their grubby little fingers out of them so I could take them to an event we were attending.

Very moist, but next time, I will reduce the chocolate chips and add some pumpkin pie spice to really bring out the pumpkin flavor. Otherwise, wonderful! I agree that they taste great eaten cold out of the fridge!

Wow! These are great! I just made them, got my last pan in the oven...I followed this exactly and got 32 pretty good sized cookies, but I didn't put in the nuts. It is very close to a recipe my friend gave me. They are so moist and fluffy, thanks for sharing! ;)

Yum yum.  I'm on the blood type diet for type O and this recipe fit perfectly.  I used both olive oil and canola oil and replaced flour with a mixture of spelt flour, buckwheat flour and rice flour.  I used a bit more walnuts and less chocolate chips than asked for.  Thanks, they turned out great.

I guess what I ended up with really isn't the same cookie but I thought I'd put what I did to give anyone interested some ideas. First I added nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon for a more spicey kind of cookie and I didn't have chocolate chips I used M&M minis that I had in my cabinet that my kids begged for then decided they didn't want.  These cookies were a huge hit.

These were very good, but tasted a little more like spice cake than pumpkin. I like how the texture is more like little cakes. I used white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts and people loved them!

This is a great recipe, each time I make it everyone wants more cookies and they want to know my secret.  I have found that people have to like pumpkin to like these cookies, and I added a little more spices than the recipe indicated.

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil like another reviewer suggested. It worked great. I didn’t want to use canola oil because I’ve never heard of a canola, so where does the oil come from. The cookies were really great. Others said they were cake like, and they were but not overly cake-y. They were still like a cookie texture. I added 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and an extra 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Also I added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I even substituted half the sugar for organic stevia leaf powder. I didn’t miss the sugar at all. Fantastic recipe.

I add a little bit of extra pumpkin and it makes the cookies more doughy. If you don't like your cookies like that then the normal recipe is great.

Made this using the exact recipe. I’ve never been a fan of the pumpkin flavor in general, but these are delightful! Very easy to make and a perfect dessert for the holidays. Mine took about 15-17 minutes to bake but I had almost all 24 in the oven.

Too many chocolate chips and NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR and I even added additional cinnamon and nutmeg.
The texture was good - but everything else  was lacking.

These cookies are awesome. I found that I needed to up the baking time from 10 minutes to more like 12-15 minutes, as the recipe says the cookies must be firm when baked. At 10 minutes, they are still very much unbaked. So Good and Gooey, even firm. Yummy!

Favorite pumpkin cookie recipe. I’ve been making them for years and everyone always asks me for the recipe or to bake them. I do half chocolate chips half white and I add pumpkin pie spices. The white chocolate chips is the game changer though.

The taste was good, however, the consistency was way too gooey!  I even tried to bake them longer than the suggested time.  I will not be using this recipe again.

I made two batches of these cookies. The first batch I made exactly as written, and they were good but not great- 4/5 stars. They fell flat and weren't cakey like typical pumpkin chocolate chip cookies are, and were slightly unappealing looking but tasted fine. The second batch I added a dash of nutmeg and cloves, and baked them at 365 for 14 minutes (bake time/temp could be my oven's issue) and they came out perfect. I did also add a couple drops of orange food coloring to keep the color vibrant

I made it, but like other comments, cut the cinnamon in half, and added 1tsp nutmeg and 1/2tsp each cloves and ginger.  I also cooked at around 365 for 12 minutes.  My daughter just asked me to make them for her hs anatomy class “thanksgiving.”

This recipe is my favorite - so far. I like the cake like texture. The finished product is too moist. I do not like this cookie drie, but not This moist. It must be a fine balance of the appropriate flour. I do not eat whole wheat flour it is so heavy and does not digest easily.   I would like someone to comment if they have used alternative flour all purpose or cake flour or whatever of the many types of flour are available. I love fall favorite cookies, and I want to recreate them JustRight!  Katie. Ktrwise@yahoo.com

These are excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, but changed the cooking time to 12 minutes at 365 degrees, following the advice in previous reviews. The texture definitely is cakey, but very good. Next time I will try applesauce instead of oil to make them a little healthier.

My fiance hasn't had pumpkin chocolate chip cookies before, he loves them! I've been craving them for a while and it was really nice making them with him on this Family Day.

I just made these cookies, but want to tell you they are very moist and have to chill overnight in order to roll into a ball for cookies and my grandchildren loved them!

My son loves pumpkin and chocolate chip cookies. This recipe combined his two loves and they came out great. I loved the moist, almost cake-like texture. Living at an elevation of over 3000 feet I made a few tweaks to get the consistency I desired; 1 tbsp more flour, 1 tbsp less sugar, and about 1/4th tsp less of the baking soda. My son also requested the addition a few pinches of both nutmeg and clove.  I’ll definitely make this recipe again.

I have made this recipe several times—once with pumpkin, the other times with mashed bananas! So tasty both ways. Make sure to not overbake...if you make these with banana they will not look done after 9 mins, but they keep baking on the pan after removal from the oven. Yum yum!!!

I used just one cup of mini chocolate chips, and there was plenty of chocolate flavor in each cookie.  This is a favorite with my friends and family.

I have been making these for about 5 years.  When I moved to Maine I looked and looked for the cookies all the bakeries in Utah made.  No bakeries here make ;them. Finally I found this one... love it. So does the whole family. I also used the whole small can of pumpkin puree and just added what the recipe called for of the other ingredients and then halved the rest of ingredients, yes including the chocolate. Yummy.

This is a great recipe. I don't use as many chocolate chips as the recipe calls for and I do what another reviewer recommended and cooked them for 12 minutes at 365. They turned out perfect!

I goofed and put the soda in the flour mixture. Also I used a 9x13 pan instead of dropping cookies. Dough was a little wet. Have yet to taste it.

This has been my go-to recipe for years! They're sooo good, I get requests to make them every fall. They're better a day or two after making so they can develop their sticky pumpkin deliciousness. I often turn them into whoopie pies with cream cheese filling (which has pretty much become my favorite food).

I made these this afternoon...Very easy to put together & it makes almost 5 DOZEN medium sized cookies...WOW!!  I baked them for 12 minutes, since some ovens differ,  then put them on a rack to cool... My Husband really liked them A LOT!!  The only change I made was ''fresh pumpkin'' that I had pureed last night!!  I think I'll make some for Christmas Gifts for my friends & neighbors... They're YUMMY!!

For me,,, a total waste of time and effort!  I made the mistake of following the directions,,,  I know Cra-Cra me on that one.  "Dissolve the baking soda with the milk and stir in".  I've never seen that before and I believe this is where my effort went off the tracks.  Discouraging,,,

I have been looking for a recipe like this for years. My aunt had always made these, they were my favorite. And she passed I never knew what happened to her recipes. They are almost identical to what she made. I did only put in 1 tsp of cinnamon and maybe 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. And I like pumpkin so I threw in a little more extra than the cup. Still came out great. I saw other reviews putting them in longer at a higher temp, I did not. I put them in at 350 for a minute longer and they were done. Thanks so much, it's been 14years since I have had these. Brings back a piece of my Aunt.

I had made pumpkin puree and had some leftover. Thought I would try this recipe out and I am SO glad I did. These cookies were a HIT! Made a batch and brought them to the office. They were devoured within minutes! Thank you for sharing this recipe. Will definitely be making more soon!

I think there were too many chocolate chips because it was all I could taste. It definitely overpowered the pumpkin. They are very cakelike, as other reviewers have mentioned. I probably won’t make them again, just because I simply think there are better recipes out there.

I have made dozens of varieties of cookies and these were my least favorite of them all.  I have been baking for over 35 years.  Maybe they would be better baked in mini cake cups... idk.  I made these exactly like written. These had too many chocolate chips.  I really don't understand so many good reviews.  They were caky and bland.  I didn't even bother baking the second batch after tasting the first:(

These cookies are delicious! I had to double the baking time to 20 minutes because mine were still raw after 10, possibly because of the elevation I am in.

Loved this receipe!!! I did switch it up a bit. Substituted the vegetable oil for coconut oil and did 1 and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. And refrigerated the dough for 1hr. It just made it easier to handle.  They are delicious! Also bake at 365 for 13 minutes.

I think next time I may add some nutmeg or pumpkin pie spice. They are good but think I could make them even better with some spices.

I made a few different pumpkin cookie recipes off this site at one time to do a side by side taste test....these are my absolute favorite!!  I prefer them chilled so I keep them in the fridge.  They are both cakey and dense plus pumpkin goodness!!

I doubled the recipe but did not double all of the ingredients. I thought that 1 TBS of vanilla extract too much for the normal recipe,  so I modified the vanilla to 2 tsp for the doubled recipe. I also substituted 1 cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour. I used 2 cups of chocolate chips for the double batch. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts. The cookies were a huge hit at party and disappeared quickly.

These are ok. Very messy to make. Helps to put the batter in the fridge btwn sheets. I do not really taste the pumpkin. And I think the chocolate chips could be reduced to taste more pumpkin. Not awful, just meh. Maybe I will change my mind after they sit for a day or 2.

Yummy! Very much cake like. I shunned someone else’s idea to do cupcakes but after making these myself I think mini cupcakes would be awesome! I used whole wheat flour, cut the sugar in half and used local honey instead, coconut oil, pecans and special dark chocolate chips ( plus all the good spices that add up to pumpkin pie spice mix!)

These cookies are so delicious! They have a cake-like consistency which is one of the reasons I love them so much! The recipe is so easy to follow and it doesn’t require a ton of ingredients or work. Clean up was super quick and easy too!

These are good, but not great. The cinnamon and pumpkin flavors are hard to pick out. This is definitely  not going to be my consistent pumpkin chocolate chip recipe.

These are out of world good! And yes, they are awesome when chilled in the refrigerator. And don’t skimp on the chocolate chips and nuts are not needed. A little pumpkin spice is nice addition and my oven needed 12 minutes at 350. I make these every October and share with family. So hard to eat just one, in fact I find it impossible!

Yep. Cakey and delicious. Vary chips for desired sweetness. I added some caramel chips to the second batch to satisfy my boyfriend's intense sweet tooth!

I made these almost exact to the recipe. The only change I made was switching out the semi-sweet chips for milk chocolate chips. I didn’t have any semi-sweet on hand. I loved these cookies. But next time will definitely use semi-sweet instead as I found them very sweet because of the milk chocolate chips.

MY COOKIES CAME OUT WONDERFUL BY MISTAKE TRUST ME WHEN I RECOMMEND THAT                                     #1...If you double the recipe you will end up with 123 cookies...lol and after awhile I stopped baking them and teaspooned them out and laid them on wax paper froze  them and made my own "Break & Bake" cookies for later                                                                                                      #2...I HIGHLY, recommend not only use the mini chocolate chips but to only use 1 CUP in the doubled recipe...otherwise you will get a blob of chocolate chip with an occasional cookie crumb!!!   Judge for your self. But be sure you add your chips to your batter slowly that way you can stop it when u think its enough.    BEWARE: THESE COOKIES ARE ADDICTING.....

These taste good, but there is WAY too much baking powder for the amount of cookies this recipe makes. I bake a lot of cookies and I thought the measurement didn't look right, but since it was my first time making this, I followed the recipe. What I ended up with was tasty muffin tops. They are so cakey, not cookie-like at all. In any case, I will make them again, but I may omit the baking powder entirely. The tsp of baking soda should be plenty.

The best pumpkin chocolate chips cookies I have ever made! I don’t add the nuts though in case people have allergies. They are a great crowd pleaser, always receive lots of compliments.

A really light and fluffy cookie. The recipe produces an almost spongy cookie--a texture I like--so don't expect crispy, crunchy. I like the spin on the traditional chocolate chip cookie for fall, and these have always gone over well with a crowd.

These cookies are REALLY tasty!  I was watching my friend's 2 sons while she was having surgery and asked them if they would like to bake some cookies.  The oldest told me yes, and asked for Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cookies "like my Mom makes."  My heart melted, and I said "Of course we can."

This was the first recipe I saw.  It looked simple enough, so I thought I'd give it a try.  The 4-year-old and 8-year-old were able to help, and we had the dough ready to put in the oven in about 10 minutes.  I baked mine for 9 minutes, and they were perfect.  We ate ours hot out of the oven; the chips were melty goodness, and the pumpkin cookie was soft, cakey, and scrumptious.  After 3 batches came out of the oven my children husband, myself and our 3 visitors had eaten all but 8 cookies.  This recipe is a keeper!

Hands down my favorite cookie recipe! If a muffin and cookie had a baby, this would be their child, Lol! Everyone loves this cookie and they always all get eaten at any potluck or party. It also can easily be converted to Vegan.

My family loves these cookies! As previous posts, went with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I? omitted the nuts (picky kids) and used dark chocolate chips. Yummy!

Very easy to make. Delicious too!  I left the
cookies in the oven for 18 minutes at 470 degrees. Also, added a teaspoon of ground ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.

I followed Crystal's suggestions on 3-4 drops of food coloring as well as bake time. 365 degrees for 12 minutes was the perfect baking time. These cookies were cake like and delicious. The whole family loved them. Will make again.

A hit for the fall season!  Mine needed a bit more spice, I lessened the cinnamon and added some clove and nutmeg, but next time I'll use the full amount of cinnamon in addition to to the other spices.  Definitely keep these in the fridge, not on the counter. Also, I cooked the first batch at 365 for 12 minutes and the bottoms were a little burnt.  Second batch I cooked at 350 for 13 minutes and that seemed to work better.  I used chocolate chips, no nuts.  Soft, fluffy, and delicious!

I love this recipe so much it is chewy and amazing. I did not have any semisweet chocolate chips so I used a Hershey's chocolate bar and that worked all you have to do is cut the bar into little bite sized chunks.

Very good, cakey cookies.  I normally make a recipe exactly as written, but I read the reviews and seemed to agree ahead of time, that this batter would need more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and cloves, possibly some ginger (which I did not add, but will the next time).  I doubled the recipe because this recipe says it makes enough for 12 servings.  I didn't know if that meant only 12 cookies?  Those would've been gone in no time, so I doubled it and ended up with a boat-load of cookies....approximately 48!  So, I believe the serving size is incorrect.  I used white choc chips because I didn't have choc chips on hand and they are delish!  So, with adding more cinnamon, a teaspoon of nutmeg and cloves (to my doubled recipe), this recipe was VERY good and my kids love them.  I would probably subtract some sugar, though.  A little too sweet if that's such a thing :).

I've been making these every fall for years now. They are my absolute favorite cookie and I always have people ask me for the recipe when I bring them to an event. The recipe is great as is, but sometimes I cut back on the sugar. I'm not a fabulous baker, but these are easy for me to make and they come out perfect every time!

This was great. I had a smaller pumpkin can that had close to 2 cups so I doubled the recipe and because of that, it lacked in pumpkin flavor a little bit. Still the cookie was very fluffy and yummy! I didn’t have walnut so I added crushed almonds and that gave a nice texture. I might add raisin to it next time with half the batch. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Everyone in my family hates pumpkin, but every fall, they request I make these cookies and they're gone within a day! These are by far my favorite cookies to make year round. Since we have egg allergies in my house, we used applesauce as a substitute, and it worked out just the same!

Made these for our annual soup day. A chewy cake-like cookie. For my altitude -- nearly 4,000 ft -- I baked them a few minutes longer. Don't need that many chocolate chips. I used 1 1/2 cups and that was plenty.

I enjoyed this recipe although they were very cakey. If you make them into cookies with a scoop, use a bigger scoop otherwise it will be more chocolate chips than actual pumpkin.

Yummy yummy yummy! These are like cake cookies and I did read some reviews and decided to alter/add(only slightly) the following: just 1+1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I love chocolate and always want more chocolate chips, however 1+1/2 C seemed like more than enough, so I stopped there. Since all ovens can vary, I did 11 mins a batch at 355 degrees. I did have a few issues towards the end with some of the cookies not firming up very well, but I am still a beginner. Everyone I shared these with loved them too!

I made these cookies and they were delicious.  I loved the idea of adding a few drops of red food coloring, came out great.  I read in another review to raise temp to 365, DO NOT DO THIS unless you like cookies with burned bottoms.  
In fact I lowered to 325 and that was perfect!

In the past I have made a different recipe (that I couldn't find) but I thought I'd try this one. It was OK. Not as moist as my previous recipe, but the taste is fine. I did not make any changes  from the published recipe.

Great recipe! Hopefully most people read and find that it is a cakey cookie because I was looking for a more spread out, crispy cookie. I added an extra 1/8c of pumpkin, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 2 1/2 tsp cinnamon, used melted butter, and Guittard dark chocolate chips. Yum!

Great flavor and cakey texture, but cook time varied. Found that 9-12mins is best. Let cool then refrigerate. Will make again!

Turned out very well, however I did cook them for 14 min, and I replace the vegetable oil with the same amount of softened butter.

I cut the recipe in half, and added a pinch of nutmeg. The house smells delicious, and these cookies are a tasty treat!

The cookies were fairly good after baking them about 20 to 25 minutes. I even went by video when I made them. Still a win just took longer took bake.

I think this is a good basic recipe as is. However, I prefer more texture and spice so I added a cup of rolled oats, a tsp. of allspice and an extra tsp. of cinnamon. As recommended by others, I reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1/2 cup and used dark chocolate because it is what I had on hand.

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes for Fall and winter! I add a little bit less sugar (3/4 cup instead of 1) and I always use Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips (semi-sweet are too sweet IMO). I also reserve some chips to put along the tops of each cookie, so there appearance is nicer.  I make the cookies bigger and bake for 14 minutes, they're perfection! I like to store mine in the fridge too, for some reason they just taste better that way!

Very excellent! Easy to make. I added one whole cup of chopped walmuts because we all like nuts and walnuts are good for you. I USUALLY add more choc chips than are called for in any recipe but this time I did not....I will try that the next time. These are excellent and perfect for a cold fall day.....or any day!!!!

I have made this several times and I add mini chocolate chip instead of regular chips. I follow the other recommendations and cut the cinnamon in half. I also have made them as muffins, bread and cookie. The muffins are a bigger hit than the cookies. Last batch I made with sweet potatoes and it tasted great.

I did up the oven temp as recommended by others to 375, and used a pumpkin pie spice mix instead of just cinnamon. For my own personal needs, I substituted coconut sugar for white sugar and rice milk for cow's milk, both of which work really well. This is a great recipe I find I use over and over again!

Excellent. Out of oil, so creamed butter and brown sugar, added to freshly puréed butternut squash, then per recipe.  Would use more nutmeg per other reviewers.  Calling them "cake in cookie form."  Easy handling for preschoolers.

I made this Pumpkin Cookie recipe pretty much as instructed, although I did replace the oil with applesauce instead.  Out of 1 batch of the pumpkin mixture, I made several different versions.  1 tray was chocolate chips, 1 tray consisted of cranberries, walnuts & chocolate chips, while the final trays - which I enjoyed the best - consisted of Cranberries, Walnuts & Blueberries - this combination, by far, was the best.

These turned out beautifully.  I did turn the temperature up a little as advised by another reviewer an added 2 minutes to the cooking time - 355 degrees for 12 minutes.  I also added two teaspoons of fresh ground nutmeg.  My husband gave it a big thumbs up as I do!

1/2 cup oil seemed like an awfully lot.  I couldn't make myself put that much in, so I used only 1/4 cup.  I added a little water to make up for the omitted oil.  The cookies turned out well.

The flavor of the cookie was okay, but the texture was all wrong. They were way too soft and oily. The day after I made them, the cookies were sticking together, and they easily broke apart when trying to separate. I definitely will not be making these again. The oil in this recipe ruined what may have been a really good cookie.

I made these cookies because I couldn't find my original recipe. I wasn't impressed really. They tasted good but were flat like pancakes and stuck to the cookie sheet. My kids liked them but not as much as the ones I usually make. I will try to find my recipe and make that next time.

These are a bit too sweet for me. I think I'll cut the amount of sugar in half next time. Great soft cookie otherwise.

Very moist and flavorful. Light pumpkin taste but mostly tastes like a denser chocolate chip cookie. Highly recommend. I used coconut oil instead of butter and rice milk to make them dairy free.

I don't think I will make these cookies again.  My cookies looked nothing like the picture since the cookies don't change shape or "melt" as they bake.  On subsequent batches I tried to shape them a bit to make them more attractive.  I eat gluten free so substituted GF flour.  Rather disappointing since I love pumpkin goodies.

LOVE this recipe! Use it every year! 

I don't use butter instead of oil and prefer this to help the texture be more fluffy.

Used 'Pamela's Baking Mix '(gluten-free)...in place of all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder & salt...and blend of Canola & Coconut oil (instead of vegetable oil); Used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips and pecans (instead of walnuts). SOOO good! My son-in-law said they're the best cookies he's ever had!

I love this recipe! I didn't make any changes (aside from adding just a bit more flour since I live at a high elevation). My husband couldn't get enough. Nor could his best friend, who doesn't usually eat sweets but ate four large cookies! I personally like them best warm, but they are great chilled too. So grateful for this recipe!!!

I LOVED IT!!! I used acorn squash because I had no pumpkin, and it tasted AMAZING!!! I also did 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 2 tsp. Other that those it was the exact same.

I plan to make these into tiny muffins next time. The cookies are very light and puffy. They really are delicious. My friend called them mini muffins, and asked me for more!

These cookies were good! They were not super amazing, but they were a great way to use leftover canned pumpkin. They are indeed cakey, which I didn't mind much. The batter was more like a cake batter than a cookie dough, so that made it a bit difficult to scoop the cookies. I ended up making 33 heaping tablespoon size cookies (and I even ate some of the batter ;). I would make this recipe again, my only change would be that I may use less chocolate or leave it out all together. I used semisweet chocolate chips and they really overpowered the subtle pumpkin flavor. I made one without chips and it was delicious!

I made these using the ingredients listed, except that I accidentally bought mini chocolate chips instead of regular, and I didn't use the optional walnuts. These were awesome!  Don't change the recipe until you've tried this original recipe first!  This recipe should be called "muffin tops", because these aren't so much cookies as they are little cakes. Really, really delicious. Everyone who tried them at a work party agreed, they're exactly like you made really good chocolate chip muffins and then cut the top off to get the good part. They even look like muffin tops after you bake them. 

***Important note, these take about 16 minutes to bake through at 350. Also beware that the batter tastes incredible before baking.......

These cookies have now become a staple during the holidays.  My family and friends ask for them every year.  I did change  one thing, I accidentally misread the ingredients and added a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of just a cup. It did not effect the taste, consistency or deliciousness.  The cookies have a cake consistency and have the perfect amount of cinnamon and pumpkin flavor. I have not tried it with nuts yet.

I've made this several times. I prefer to use the mini chocolate chips because they seem to mix more evenly, and I prefer to use just a little less than 1T of the vanilla (more like 3/4 T).  These cookies stay moist for days (but will likely be eaten up quickly).  The batter is  a little sticky, so I also use a small cookie dough scoop.

Recently, I made it for my son's class, and his teacher said this was one of those snacks that every kid liked (even the picky ones).

I used the whole can of pumpkin and added one extra tablespoon of flour.  My Granddaughter who is such a picky eater, ate 5 at one sitting....and I let her because it was a snow day.  We celebrated no school by eating cookies.  All of us thought the cookies were perfection.

Super quick and easy to make, you don't even need an electric mixer. These are definitely more like a muffin top than a cookie, but that isn't a bad thing in my book. I've made this recipe several times, and I am terrible at making consistently sized cookies, so the last time I made them I used a mini muffin pan, and that was by far my favorite batch.

I made this exactly the way the recipe is. They are delicious. The only thing I probably will change in the future is less chocolate chips. I'll use 1 1/2 c. Instead of 2 cups.

These turned out moist, perfectly flavored and beautiful (see my photo). Changes: instead of 1/2 c oil I used 1/4 c oil + 1/8 c apple sauce + 1/8 c cream and I increased to 1 1/3 c pumpkin.

These are wonderful! They are not overly sweet, and they have a great texture. It's almost like eating a muffin top. I doubled the recipe. I did about 2/3 chocolate chips and 1/3 white chocolate chips since that's what I had on hand and it was great! I also replaced about 1/3 of the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice. I doubled the recipe and used a whole 15oz can of pumpkin. Technically that's a little under what the recipe calls for, but not too much, and they turned out fine.

These cookies were so delicious! Very soft and light texture! I made the first batch with semi sweet chocolate chips and for the second batch I used white chocolate chips! These are now one of my all-time favourite cookie! I used a cookie scoop and baked them for 11 minutes. They turned out wonderful. I added in a bit more cinnamon in the second batch just for a bit more zing. Great, great recipe!!

These were delicious and a huge hit. They are cake-y, sort of like eating the top of a muffin. 
The dough seemed a little loose (compared to your normal cookie dough) so I added a little extra flour. Not sure if it was necessary but it didn't hurt either.
I will absolutely make these again!

Loved this recipe. Made it exactly as stated, but would use half the chocolate chips next time. It took away from the cookie flavor for me.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added an extra 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, halved the cinnamon, and added 1/8 tsp each of nutmeg, finger and cloves.  It smelled so delicious while it was baking in the oven.  I loved the cake-like texture, but the pumpkin flavor was very light.  Also the cookies did not look very presentable.   They did not flatten out.  I thought the cookies tasted good, but would hesitate to share with friends because the cookies do not look appetizing.   If you care only about how your cookie tastes and not what it looks like, then this recipe is for you.

I add a little nutmeg and cloves as well as the cinnamon.  I have been making this recipe for several Thanksgivings now and it's always a huge crowd pleaser.  They are meant to be more cake like!  One thing I do to try to cut down on the moisture slightly is that I squeeze the pumpkin with cheesecloth to get some of the excess water out.  When I do that, the cookies hold their shape nicely!

The only change I made was to add a bit of ginger, clove, and allspice. Turned out fantastic, just sweet enough with a wonderful cake/pumpkin bread texture. I will definitely be making these again and soon.

Very easy to make and everyone enjoyed them. I made variations of this recipe by adding oats, raisins, dried cranberries, and/or different flavored chips to the recipe. Adding an extra egg gave the cookies a lighter more cakelike consistency.

I didn't notice I had a can of pumpkin pie filling instead of pure pumpkin until after I'd opened it, so I used 1 1/2 cups of that with 1/2 cup sugar, and a bit less cinnamon, to try and follow the recipe the best I could with my ingredients.  They turned out very well; a fluffier version of a chocolate chip cookie, with a little bit of pumpkin and cinnamon flavor.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make for Halloween parties. I use fresh pumpkin and add clove, ginger, and nutmeg. I love how soft these cookies are. I make mini cookies for the little ones.

These were a big hit at my work as well with my family.  I did make them with the whole wheat All Purpose flour and applesauce instead of the oil as suggested by another user.  This is now added to my favourites.

So excited to find this recipe! I took many of the suggestions to accommodate the ingredients I have on hand as well as for healthy options. Here's what I did: 1 cup of whole wheat flour and one cup oat flour, 1 cup agave nectar, 1/4 cup nonfat Greek yogurt and 1/4 c smart balance for the fat. Added extra spices-nutmeg and cloves. Yumminess!

These cookies came out pretty good, however they barely taste like pumpkin since the chocolate chips are so overpowering (still enjoyable nonetheless, but they should be called "chocolate chip cookies with a hint of pumpkin and a different texture"). Next time I will use the entire can of pumpkin, less chocolate, and more pumpkin pie spice. I like their cake-like texture and how soft and moist they are.

Soooo good, I made the recipe healthier by substituting the oil for banana, used half a cup of brown sugar instead a full cup of white, and I used 1 cup of dark chocolate chips, cut the calories in half and they tasted amazing!

This is a great cookie! Easy to make and perfect for fall. 

Made just as listed and the cookie is very cake like. Almost spongy. After some other pumpkin cookie experiments I have found that this is a feature of using pumpkin - it makes cookies more dense and cakey. A simple substitution made the cookies a bit more cookie like. I subbed out vegetable oil and used butter instead - the exact same amount. And for a little more flavor I doubled the cinnamon and then added half as much ground ginger (so 4 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp ground ginger). The result is a yummy, moist, flavorful cookie with the perfect amount of fall flavor. With these adjustments this cookie is, for me, perfect and a permanent fixture in my recipe book!

I've made these cookies every Thanksgiving for at least 7 years. They do have cake like consistency so they are different from usual cookie. For the last 2 years I've made 2 batches, 1 gluten free and they taste good too! I follow recipe exactly except I replace applesauce for the milk because my son has a dairy allergy.

As written, I give these a 4. To elevate them to a 5+, here's what I did: 

*Used butter instead of oil (personal preference)
*used half brown, half white sugar
*used half cinnamon, half pumpkin pie spice 
*decreased chocolate chips to 1 to 1.5 cups (I know, I can't believe I'm saying that, either)

I creamed the softened butter, then added the wet ingredients and mixed well (in my kitchenaid). Combined the dry ingredients in a separate bowl and added them to the wet. Mixed well, then stirred in chocolate chips. 12 min at 350.

These were really yummy!! They are very soft and moist. Almost to much so for my taste, I will cook them a bit longer next time to try and get a crisp. Cooked for 12 mins. Only change i made was cutting back the cinnamon to 1tsp.

Delicious! One thing, the texture of the cookies isn't how I would describe a cookie's texture. But I would definitely make them again as they are very delicious. I did split my sugars half brown half white and for a healthier choice I substituted Applesauce instead of the vegetable oil. :)

Didn't make any changes.  The first time I try a recipe I like to do it as written.  These are very good, soft and not too sweet.  Definitely a cookie that I will now make all holiday season!

Great Recipe!  I make them as the recipe states.  I have made them with chocolate chips and also have made them with raisins (only)!  We love them!  This is our TRADITIONAL FIRST DAY OF FALL COOKIE!  We make loads of them the first day (and first week) of Fall and give them to friends!

Easily one of my fall favorites. I had some questioning looks over the pumpkin/chocolate combo, but those looks were replaced with rave reviews after a couple of bites!

Nom nom nom!! I made these and holy wow are they good!  I followed the recipe exactly, and found I needed to bake them at 360 for 13 minutes to get them done.  I like milk chocolate better than dark chocolate and so will probably make them with milk chocolate chips the next time, otherwise they are perfect as are.

My family loves this recipe for Pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. My husband doesn't like pumpkin but he'll eat the pumpkin cookies I make using this recipe.  Recipe is so simple all four of my girls make the cookies without my help. Daughters ages: 13, 12, 5 and 4 yrs old. And the cookies always come out perfect.

I will make these again, they were so good! Someone bought pumpkin pie mix, and I accidentally used it, but surprisingly they still turned out yummy. Next time I will use canned pumpkin as the recipe calls for. I made some changes, as others suggested, I baked at 350 degrees for 12 minutes. I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves. Can't wait to make these for the holidays, thanks for the recipe!

I have made this more times than I can count in the past few years.  Any time I want to make any sort of sweets, everyone says "Make Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies!"  These are criminally too easy to make, a huge hit, and can be varied up a bit.  I never use walnuts simply because they are just so expensive, but I have used caramel chips in them and they are good.  These are best after they have cooled down, so great to make the night before or sell at a bake sale.

These cookies are a fall favorite. They turn out more cake-like than crisp, as do most pumpkin cookies. They are very rich, but not over the top. I always add extra cinnamon, not bothering to measure the amount the recipe gives, as I love anything with cinnamon (so far, no complaints). The only other changes I make are to use all whole wheat flour and canola oil as opposed to vegetable oil. People actually beg me to make these cookies and former employees with whom I haven't worked for years still ask around for them. Quick and easy to make, and simply delicious.

I put butter in instead of oil, and I use brown sugar and usually cut it back to 3/4 cup or less, depending on the pumpkin I use. (I roast whole pumpkins and puree them and then freeze for later use.) I've made this recipe several times, and this last time, instead of cutting back the sugar, I added a very heaping tablespoon of good cocoa powder. They're pretty darn good and a consistent favorite at the office. The boss asks for them, even. I'd give the recipe 5 stars, but I think as written it's too sweet. I also don't use white flour. At most I'll do half white and half white whole wheat, but I usually just use all white whole wheat.

Deliciously soft and very cake-like texture. Highly recommend adding some tasty extras (ginger, nutmeg, extra cinnamon and whatever else you think may be delicious!)... Also I used half brown sugar and half white and used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup maple syrup. A little frosting wouldn't hurt either, or sprinkling the tops of the cookies with a bit of brown sugar. Yum!

We really enjoyed these. Very cake-like in texture. I took the advice of others and cooked them at 365 degrees for 12 minutes, added some pumpkin spice and omitted the nuts. I wasn't sure if we'd like chocolate and pumpkin but it was pretty good! My husband said he could put cream cheese icing on these (which was another nod that they are more cake-ish than cookie.)

These were light and fluffy and popular with the family. The first time I have used pumpkin in baking- I had to boil up and puree fresh pumpkin because tinned pumpkin is not available in Australia.

Made exactly as the recipe is written, it's good and I like the cake-like texture. Next time I will reduce the amount of chocolate chips as it was a little too much chocolate for our taste and add an extra sprinkle of cinnamon and a little nutmeg.

These were really moist and delicious- and a little different from the typical chocolate chip cookie! It's true what others have said- they are more of a "cakey" cookie. I followed the advice of some others and added red food coloring. I doubled the recipe and added 7 drops - could have used more to make them just a bit more orange. Some people thought they were regular chocolate chip. I also used a small cookie scooper (best invention ever) and the recipe made much more than stated that way. (Probably yielded about double.) I would definitely make these cookies again in the fall.

I made it exactly by the recipe but they were not good. They weren't like a cookie but rather like a little puff of cake. When I drop them on the cookie sheet to bake they were in a little ball shaped like most cookies. They were still in that shape when I took them out of the oven. They never flattened out like a cookie.

I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. My cookies were so moist that they fell apart very easily, so I'm assuming canned pumpkin isn't as moist. The flavor is fantastic, so I don't care that they fall apart!

I made these with my two year old for Halloween. They were very quick and easy to make. I used 1 cup of chocolate chips and that was a perfect amount since this doesn't make a huge batch of cookies. I enjoyed the spice flavor and would consider using pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon next time. Yes, these are cakey, but all pumpkin cookies are cake like, but delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

These cookies are the best! BUT if you cook them according to the serving size they are 400 calories! I would recommend making 24 cookies out of the batter and NOT 12 as recommended. I also cooked at higher temp 375 for longer time 15 min as other reviews suggested. They were very gooey when cooked as directed but still delish!

It's good. Best after being refrigerated. I add a little more than 1/4 tsp ground cloves. I disagree with the other commenters who say 10 mins at 350 isn't enough. I think any more done and they'd be very dry. Like most cookies they're better slightly underdone than over cooked.

Pumpkin flavor barely comes through even with additional nutmeg, ginger, and cloves spices. Not a bad cake-like cookie but just underwhelming. Choc chips are the stand-out flavor.

Too sweet. I will definitely use less sugar next time. Really good though. I used unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil too. Half  whole wheat, half white flour. Cooked for 11 min and they were perfect.

As written this is very good. I made a second based on reviewer suggestions, my hubby and I replaced the oil with Apple sauce, we used only 1 teaspoon of cin,we added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and reduced the chocolate chip to 1 cup these where amazing! The recipe as written at least for us had to many chocolate chips, it did overpower the pumpkin flavoring of the cookie. If your hesitating about substituting the oil for Apple sauce don't, both tasted great, you do not taste apple flavoring if your curious. We actually preferred it with apple sauce, seemed to bring out the pumpkin flavoring, and seemed lighter! Highly recommend!

This is a great recipe. I doubled everything except for the chocolate chips. It had the perfect amount of chocolate. We also didn't have any nuts on hand so we skipped that ingredient. We baked them for 11 minutes. Ten minutes wasn't quite long enough. Will definitely make again.

I followed another reviewer's advice and baked at 365 for 14 minutes, or until the cookies bounce back when touched.  

I also cut the cinnamon and chocolate chips in half and added 1/2 tsp each of ground cloves and ginger.

I love these cake-like cookies! They are the perfect combination of pumpkin & chocolate and have the best texture. I added two teaspoons of pumpkin spice (combination of nutmeg, cloves & ginger) for added flavor and I really think that's what took these cookies from good to great! Definitely best when served chilled.

I have been making this recipe for 3 years. I make it probably 10x/year. It's perfect. I suggest keeping the cookies in from 10-12 minutes. Did I mention this recipe is perfect?

I made these cookies on New Years Eve, thinking I could make plate or two for gifts, ummm no!!  They were gone before breakfast the next morning!!   My 14- year old said they are his new "favorite" cookie, and I make homemade cookies a couple times a week, so that is saying a lot!  I followed the recipe exactly except I  used half a cup  brown sugar,1/2 cup  white sugar.  I thought the baking time was perfect, had to turn my oven down maybe ten degrees or so.  Thanks for a great cookie recipe!!!

These cookies are freaking brilliant! The taste and texture are perfect! They don't really spread out in the oven and they're kind of spongy. I only used about a teaspoon of cinnamon and they taste doesn't overpower the pumpkin. Also, putting a few drops of red food colouring really makes them pop orange.

These cookies were so good that I made them twice during Thanksgiving, and once again for Christmas! Everyone loved them. 

The cookies will retain a spongy, somewhat cake-like texture when they're done. I assume this is from the pumpkin. The first time I made them I wasn't sure if they were done, but they were.

Tip: Make sure not to make them too big or else they won't cook fast enough. You should get 24 cookies with this recipe.

Cookies are good-- but the 2 cups of chocolate chips must be a mistake. Way too much, cut them down to 1 cup or less.

Delicious!! Moist and cakey just the way I like it. I substituted the vegetable oil with coconut oil and it turned out great. I followed the advice someone gave of only putting about 1 3/4 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 2 teaspoons and it turned out great.

I love the flavors of pumpkin and chocolate together, and they are paired perfectly in this recipe.  I used coconut oil instead of canola, only because it was what I had on hand, and they were a perfect cake-like cookie, filled with chocolate.  A perfect cookie for the fall season, thanks for sharing this recipe!

delicious, soft cookies...way to much chocolate chips!  I would make them again with 1/2 the chocolate chips.  I only used 3/4 sugar, and added a pinch of nutmeg.

Recipe was just okay.  Hubby enjoyed them but I thought that the cookies were too dense, almost cake like.  I took another review's opinion and made the rest of my batch into muffins instead which taste better.  Also I found that there is almost too much chocolate chips.  I also had to cook for about 14 minutes.

I mix these up and spread them in a greased 13X9 pan and bake for 25-30 minutes and they are great, very soft and tasty. My son-in-law that doesn't like pumpkin, likes these.

Solved the craving. I ran out of eggs so I used 1/4 cup applesauce and I used a can of sweet potato instead of pumpkin. Also it was closer to 1 t cinnamon which was plenty. Delicious! Made 28 good sized cookies. All my poky kids loved and I'm trying not to go to the kitchen and eat the last 20 now.

These were sooooooooooooooooo addictively yummy! I seriously cannot stop eating them! I hate the texture of pumpkin pie, but love the smell and taste of it, so these were excellent! I did add a bit of nutmeg and allspice to give it more kick, left out the walnuts (I don't like nuts), and they were delicious:)!

Absolutely love this recipe! Made them for my daughter's class pumpkin party. There were only 3 extra cookies left for myself & my husband to try. They were so soft & moist! I made another batch that night for us to enjoy. This will definitely be a go to recipe for kids fall parties. So fast & easy to make. I'll be making a few batches of these every year!

This cookie is ok but not great.  I would not make it again as it is written. There is way too much cinnamon and too many chocolate chips.  I'll keep looking for a pumpkin cookie recipe.

I had pumpkin chocolate chip cookies from a bakery in my hometown years ago and they have been my favorite dessert ever since. However, since I moved away from my hometown I haven't been able to find a recipe that was as good as the cookies I purchased from there. Atleast, until now. These were bakery worthy cookies and everyone who tried them fell in love. I give this recipe five stars and two thumbs up!

I thought the combination of pumpkin and chocolate was odd before I made these cookies and now it's confirmed. I think it would be a better cookie without the chocolate.  I'm sorry I wasted so many choc chips.

These cookies were delicious and simple to make!! The only thing I would change is maybe putting less chocolate chips in them. I love chocolate so it was fine for me but if you're not as big of a fan just put less in and I'm sure you will love it!

I substituted gluten free flour and honey for the regular flour and sugar, and also coconut oil for the vegetable oil, and they turned out wonderful. Cake like, but not dry at all.

I searched for a pumpkin cookie recipe and decided to try this one. I read some reviews and decided to add pumpkin pie spice, more cinnamon, and a little more nutmeg.Plus I added about 1-2 more tablespoons of flour because it seemed so wet after mixing. I was out of choc. chips so instead I made a chocolate ganache with some melting chocolate I had. I poured it over the cookies and let it run down sides--delicious. I liked the cake like texture and next  time I am planning to use this recipe to make pumpkin whoopie pies--the texture will be perfect and I will pour them out a little thinner, make the cream filling and sandwich between cookies...mmmmm, I can taste them now. So, yes-I enjoyed this recipe!

These cookies were so delicious!  I could not keep my 2 year old son out of them.  He loved them, as did the rest of the family.  I did make them a bit healthier by replacing the oil with applesauce.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. They are a dense cookie, more like cake.  They don't spread out much on the cookie sheet either. I would recommend refrigerating them as I think they would tend to spoil quickly.

This was an awesome recipe. these are super soft, very cakey, perfect for ice cream sandwiches. Put a spiced vanillain between. Also, I had a leftover pumpkin from halloween that we didnt get to carve.  I baked it and pureed it. Recommend if you do it this way to add a lot more of the spices. It could have just been my pumpkin, not super flavored. :) but great recipe I shall use it again!

My kids love this recipe. Of course, I don't tell them it has pumpkin in it. Been using fresh pumpkin for over a year and this recipe is always a hit! We have used multiple types of chocolate chips over the past year and find that white chocolate are our favorite. It has a higher melting point than milk chocolate, so the kids don't get all covered with chocolate while eating their new favorite cookies (which is a good thing when you have kids with special needs and "messy" means meltdowns). They are cake-like in texture and are great fresh from the oven or cold from the fridge. Great recipe! I've shared it with numerous friends and it's now a go-to recipe for cookies all year long (as long as I've got frozen pumpkin, we've got pumpkin cookies).

So yummy!  I doubled the batch and spread about 3/4 into a jellyroll pan.  Then I used a pumpkin shaped cookie cutter.  Adorable!  I baked the rest of the batter as "regular" cookies.  Great and easy recipe.  Thank you!

I made this recipe without any modifications and love them!!  I did under bake the first pan.  I've  since learned to bake one or two cookies first when I'm trying a new recipe to determine the right amount of baking time for my oven and pans.  The only change I'll make with my next batch is to add more nuts.  These will become an annual fall cookie in our home!

On accident, I used the whole can of pumpkin. Cookies came out great. Nice to have a different texture. I did cut back on the chocolate chips. I only used one cup thanks to another reviewer. They were right, the cookie still maintained the pumpkin flavor.

This is a really great recipe with amazing flavor. Definitely delicious, but it was more like cake than it was cookie. I, myself, am not a huge fan of the texture of cake, but I know my younger brother is gonna love these! :D

Great recipe, but I reduced the chocolate chips by nearly half and it was perfect.  Two cups is far too many chocolate chips for the original serving size.  I doubled the recipe but still put in only two cups and it was the perfect amount.  I replaced half the oil with applesauce and I used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon.  May try it with just cinnamon next time to compare, but it was quite good.

Well, I did make some changes, but what I really HAD to change was the bake time. My cookies came out just right at 17 minutes, which is much longer than the prescribed. At 10, they were still mush. I also did not find it necessary to grease the baking sheet.

My changes: substituted coconut oil for half the oil; substituted spelt flour for half the all purpose; I only used 1/2 the cinnamon for a more subtle flavor.

My suggestions: butterscotch chips with pecans; white chocolate chips with almonds.

I love pumpkin so I did this. Well I made them a bit healthier by using applesauce, stevia, and wholewheat flour instead of oil, white sugar, and reg flour. They turned out amazing. I have done the original recipe and mu version now and mine are a bit dry in comparison but thats because I ate them side by side to contrast. Give the healthier modifications a shot I was delighted and ...might have made them three times withing the past two weeks.... yes i give some away :)

I had to do something pumpkin to shake up the chocolate chip cookie.  I thought these were pretty good, nice and moist.  My sons ate them like crazy and even licked the plate.  It was an easy recipe and the best part was they were still just as moist the next day when I had the hidden two at work.  Bottom line was it passed the kid test and I will most definately make it again, double the recipe and without changing a thing!

My family loves these cookies!  
I have altered the original recipe some: I substitute no sugar added applesauce for the vegetable oil and use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour (using all whole wheat makes them pretty "grainy") instead of 2 cups white flour.  
Also, I use a whole bag of the mini-semisweet chocolate chips.  
I have found (by not following the directions as closely as I should have!) that if you go ahead and add the milk and vanilla to the pumpkin mixture and the baking soda to the flour mixture, that the cookies turn out the same as when you separate them out like the original recipe says to do.  
They are very cake-like cookies, nice, thick and hearty and I end up having to bake my at a higher temp. and longer than the original recipe: 375 for 12 minutes, although it may just be my oven...

I have to admit to drastically altering this recipe in hopes of lowering the calories.  It came out fantastic, anyway.  I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, subbed the oil for applesauce and the sugar for splenda. I also added some cinnamon chips and pecans. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I have been making these cookies for a couple of years now and always get a lot of compliments. I do add more chocolate to mine. I melt chocolate and spread it on the bottom and drizzle it on the top. Everyone loves them.

Really tasty cookie. I brought it to work, put it in the teacher's lounger, and they were gone in less than an hour...followed by many requests for the recipe. I did add some fresh ground nutmeg and just a bit of cayenne pepper (for depth). I didn't use walnuts, but thank I will the next time.

Absolutely delicious! I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and baked at 350 for 17 minutes (rotating pans 1/2 way through). It made a total of 20 cookies. These are my go-to cookies for the fall; I had no problem tasting the pumpkin.

Looks like a chocolate chip cookie, but when you bite into it, you get that surprise of pumpkin!! I added pumpkin pie spice and cloves and a few drops of food coloring to add a more orange color to it. Also I recommend only adding 1 cup of chocolate chips because for me the chocolate was just too much. Overall this tastes absolutely amazing and is super easy to make!! Definitely will be making these again

I made these exactly as the recipe suggested, except I forgot to mix the baking soda in the milk and added them separately. These were delicious, cake-like cookies! Next time I may try to add a little nutmeg and cloves for a little more spice! Also could do with less chocolate chips than suggested.

Delicious but WAY too many chocolate chips.  1 cup is more than enough.  Also needed to cook for 12 minutes with convection.  Also skipped the milk step (and milk).

These cookies are baking as I write this.  I decided to use the canned pumpkin pie filling instead of just the pureed pumpkin, hopefully to give it that little bit of flavor and I just cut the salt all together.  The batter tasted amazing going in, but I can't wait to taste the cookie coming out.

I Just Tried this Recipe And My Family Loves Them. I Also Took The Suggestions And Used Food Coloring.. Made Them A Nice Rich Color. Also Added Nutmeg And Used Half Of The Cinnamon Recommendation. Overall, Cookies Came Out Amazing. Will Defiantly Do Again.

These were really good! I used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves, and 1/8 tsp. of allspice. I wouldn't mind keeping that all the same but using the 2 tsp. of cinnamon as well. They do need to bake a little longer than ten minutes, especially if you make the cookies large. I added a few drops of red food coloring and that definitely helped the presentation!

Terrific cookie!  I liked the idea because my sister likes the taste of pumpkin but not the texture of pumpkin pie.  I also love chocolate, so that is great too.  However, I tried half the dough with chocolate chips and half with raisins.  I've got to tell you, I preferred the raisins.  Next time, I think I'll incorporate some oatmeal...  I'll have to try that soon.

These turned out as expected and delicious. The pumkpin flavor is subtle. As other reviews mentioned, they are cake-like cookies. They're more fluffy than chewy - almost a muffin top consistency. I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of oil, and I added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar for the cracked effect, but it didn't make a noticeable difference this time. I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate. And finally, I ended up leaving these in the oven a bit longer than suggested, but maybe that's just my oven (around 14-15 minutes based on when the edges were just golden brown and the top of cookies were spongy/firm).

Yum!  To make them a bit healthier I omitted the oil and added a banana (pumpkin is so strong, you couldn't taste the banana but they were still moist), replaced sugar with 1/2 C Splenda and 1/2 C brown sugar, and replaced half the flour with wheat.  Perfect!!

I love this recipe, I did add less chocolate chips.  I didn't want to open a big can of pumpkin so I pureed 1 1/2 cup raw ground up butternut squash in my vita mix.  We use alot of butternut and have the ends that we grind up for breads.  I added 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice (made from recipe here on all recipes) and cookies are wonderful.  Had to bake 10 minutes.  Making second batch now and put it in a 9 inch square brownie pan.  Looking forward to it as well.

These are delicious cookies! I took the suggestion of adding 1 tsp of nutmeg and cutting back to 1 cup of chocolate chips. I think this recipe turned out amazing. Everyone was raving about them and I've been asked to make them again and again!

I saw this recipe and thought "There are a few reviews saying these are 'too cake-like', so why not turn them into muffins?"

Instead of a spoonful on a cookie sheet, I roughly doubled the amount, halfway filling greased muffin tins or ungreased cupcake papers, and baked for around 14 minutes. 

Incredibly moist and fluffy, whether you keep them as cookies or convert them into cupcakes, and definitely a keeper!

I only gave four stars because I thought there was too much chocolate. The pumpkin wasn't as noticeable as I thought it should be. Next time I would only add 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. But they taste great :) I had to make a few changes due to lack of ingredients. Instead of all white sugar, I used half brown and half white. Instead of all oil, I used an applesauce cup and then added enough oil to make a half cup.

This recipe was fabulous!  Our local Ralph's bakery carries pumpkin chocolate chip and we love them, but they are a very decadent treat in our house.  When I saw this recipe, I had to try it and my husband raved and raved (I don't bake much, so I was happy he loved them) and declared them WAY BETTER than Ralph's!

As other reviewers suggested, I used more spices and more food coloring.  Can't wait to make them again but I'm wondering if anyone's tried freezing them and if so, were the results good (not that they'll last long enough to actually freeze).

My family loved these. Not wanting to keep half a can of pumpkin sitting around, I doubled the recipe. I only used three cups of chocolate chips instead of the required four and even my mother (whose philosophy is that the dough is just to hold the chips together) said that was plenty. I loved them warm from the oven and though the ones from the fridge took a while to grow on me, I loved them too. I'll definitely be making these again.

While I thought these were very moist the did lack the pumpkin flavor that I was looking for. It had a very cake like consistency and everyone that tasted it couldn't tell if it was raw or cooked all the way through. A few family members also thought it tasted like a muffin top. I think 2 cups of chocolate chips was a bit much as well. I think the next time I try these, I'll add more spices to it (nutmeg, all spice, etc.)

First batch from the oven were slightly burned on the bottom after 10 minutes.  Baked the second batch for 9 minutes and they turned out much better.  They are cake-like and very moist.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a little too sweet so I would use 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 next time. But other than that, great and easy recipe! Cookies were really nice and moist :)

I have been making these cookies for years now...and yes they do have a cake/muffin like texture to them,but that's one of the main reasons why we love them!! My husband and children can't keep their hands out of the cookie platter when they are done,they never last here because they are such a big hit and I have brought them to several holiday parties and had not one complaint about them :)

I'm not a baker and these cookies came out unbelievably soft, moist, and scrumptious! I used apple sauce instead of oil, 1 tsp of nutmeg, and baked at 365 for 12 minutes. They are cake-like and taste amazing both hot and cold. Thanks for the fun and easy recipe!

I LOVE these! I changed a few things from other suggestions though. I used dark chocolate chips, white whole wheat flour, applesauce for oil, and fresh pumpkin to make it a little healthier. I also used pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon to bring out the pumpkin taste more, and baked them at 365 for 16 minutes. Have made them twice now, they have come out great, and were very popular both times!

I happened to have mace on hand for my Thanksgiving recipes, so I substituted that for the cinnamon (used half the amount). YUMMY! Perfect fall cookie.

Just made these and they are so amazing! Just like my mom used to make. I doubled this recipe and got 62 cookies (and I make obscenely large cookies). I'm sharing them with everyone, I certainly have enough.

Truly delicious and a great way to use pumpkin!  I made these for a preschool Thanksgiving Feast because pumpkin pie is tricky for little ones to eat sometimes. This was like pumpkin pie in a cookie!  I took other reviewers' suggestions and added some red food coloring to make the cookies more orange.  Used half white flour/half whole wheat flour.

My grandchildren and I really enjoyed these cookies. These cookies are better than store bought any day. I put half chocolate and half white chips and added pumpkin spice in the batter. I will continue to make these for the fall holidays. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Yum!!!!

These are great. I made some substitutions to make them even healthier and they are still delicious. I did half brown sugar and half white sugar as well as half whole wheat and half all-purpose flour. I was out of milk so I did fat-free half and half. I also only used half the oil and did applesauce for the rest. I used a melon scoop so it did little balls of moist dough. I baked for 11 minutes and they are perfection - cooked all the way through yet the chocolate is gooey. My toddler even loves these!

Overall, they were good. They do have a "cake-like" consistency, and they are not very sweet (which I liked). It was a good addition to the pumpkin collection.

I just made these cookies, and I was a little nervous at first but they turned out fantastic! I followed the recipes exactly except I added more chocolate chips for preference and I used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I also made my own cream cheese frosting to put on them just because I thought it sounded delicious and it was. 2c. powdered sugar, 1/2 c softened butter, 4oz softened cream cheese 1tsp. vanilla and 1 tablespoon milk combine together and frost cooled cookies.  Other than that thanks for the recipe!

I made these yesterday for dessert with my family.They were a BIG hit... There's none  leftover! I modified it a bit for my dad who is diabetic- used Splenda for baking, semisweet chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup applesauce to omit the need for oil. I also wanted it to be spiced more similarly to pumpkin pie, so I added a shake of ginger and a shake or two of allspice in addition to two heaping teaspoons of cinnamon. There's no need to add food coloring as others suggest, just use high quality canned pumpkin.  They're so moist and flavorful! My neighbors were raving about them, my dad took the rest home, and my husband must have eaten 8 of them. To make them neater, I used a cookie scoop and placed them as rounded scoops on parchment paper. They're best, in my opinion, just out of the oven!!

These are very good, but I will admit, I've never had pumpkin cookies before.  They are cake-like and I can't even imagine a way to put pumpkin into cookies that would end up crispy.
I did add a few drops of red coloring and I think the color came out well.  They don't look abnormally orange, just more like you would expect.  I baked at 365 for 12 min which seemed perfect. I also cut down on the chocolate chips and added nutmeg and cloves and cut back on the cinnamon.  I ended up with too much cloves flavor even though I used a small pinch.  I also agree with the comment about either eating them warm or sticking them in the fridge to keep them from getting sticky.
I will probably make these again next year, but I also didn't think they were amazing.

Perfect pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. I have made these several times, and every where I take them they are a huge hit. I like to triple the recipe and just cook up a couple dozen when I need them. Batter stays good in the fridge for over a week.

I started with fresh pumpkin and had so much that I had to triple the recipe, so I decided to had less flour and make it into a cake batter.  Everyone loved it and there was nothing left over!  Very good!

I just made these cookies for the first time. I had to cook them 12 minutes instead of 10. I think I would use less chocolate chips next time and add pumpkin spice. I agree that the chocolate chips overpower the pumpkin taste but they were yummy.

These were definitely tasty. However, I made the mistake of making of balls of dough on the cookie sheet too large and they came out like soft scones, nonetheless, the flavor was amazing! I added pumpkin spice, some nutmeg and some cloves in addition to the cinnamon.  I also added a few tablespoons of maple syrup.  I also used 1/2 C white & 1/2 C brown sugar and 1 C white & 1 C wheat flour.    I don't think I used quite 2 C of chocolate chips, I just eye-balled it, then added 3 or 4 extra chocolate chips to each cookie as it was about to go into the oven.  I omitted the nuts. 

Everyone gave me rave reviews, aside from my husband who does not like cake, which these cookies resemble.

We love these delicious cookies! They were a little cake-y but they tasted delicious. We used half and half white chocolate and semi sweet milk chocolate chips. Simply lovely, will make them again.

These cookies are just alright, I was very disappointed last night when they were still warm but as one reviewer suggested, they taste better cold. A little better. Someone who dislikes pumpkin might like these as they have a very bland flavor and are not offensive in that regard. As for texture, while they are soft and fluffy but almost taste dry like there is too much of one of the dry ingredients. They are certainly not inedible but I wouldn't make them again.

These are pretty good. I halved the recipe due to the amount of the ingredients I had on hand, except then I added a whole egg instead of half for obvious reasons and added a bit more flour to balance the wet and dry ingredients. I realized halfway through mixing everything that the recipe called for baking soda, not just baking powder. So after searching a bit on the internet, I added approximately 3 times the baking powder as the recommended baking soda amount in addition to the baking powder already in the recipe. Despite the changes in chemistry, the cookies are actually really good. There's a bit much of the baking powder taste, but that's obviously my fault. I can tell if I had baked according to the actual recipe, the cookies would be even better. Great taste and texture. [update] I made another halved recipe with all of the correct ingredients and loved them!

I saw the photo and was VERY excited to try this recipe.  The flavor was good, but it was cake like, not cookie like. And I agree with a previous review that they are good right out of the freezer :)

YUMMY!!!  I doubled the recipe except for the chocolate chips, which were milk chocolate, and it turned out so good.  I put them in the cookie jar and they turned into one giant "cookie"  we still devoured them with a fork instead of our hands.  So yummy, I'm going to make them again this afternoon but find a different way to store them.  YUMMY!!!

Just made these and the house smells wonderful! I gave it four stars only because the cinnamon was a bit overpowering, otherwise, these cake-like cookies are scrumptious! I will cut the cinnamon down the next time I make them.

I absolutely love this recipe! I also used applesauce instead of oil and baked at 365 for 12 minutes. They came out perfectly and with a heavy pumpkin bread-like consistency. Most importantly (at least to me), I used probably twice the amount of chocolate chips than the recipe called for, as well as the tiny chips instead of regular sized. I am a HUGE chocolate lover, plus the tiny chips made them easier to bite into when chilled.

We loved this recipe. I didn't change much at all, except I baked them for 12-14 minutes, although I used a large cookie scoop to form them, so I'm sure that's why they took a couple of extra minutes. 

The recipe came together really quickly and the cookies turned out very moist and delicious. 

Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

These cookies are great once they've cooled a little. They aren't so good straight from the oven. I think they're best with dark chocolate chips.

WOW, perfect texture AND easy!  I like using the mini-semi-sweet chocolate chips. -By using Silpat, you don't need to grease your sheet.  -I also like that they poof up rather than spreading, so I was able to put more on each sheet.-Doubling yielded me 6.5 dz. 2.5"+ perfect, poofie cookies.

These are okay, but I ad to cook them A LOT longer than ten minutes. I think the chocolate overpowers the pumpkin and I only used 1 and 1/2 cups.

This recipe was great! I used brown sugar instead of white, and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Also, I didn't add the milk.  I baked them for 10 minutes as suggested in the recipe, and they tuned out delicious.  Next time i will flatten them before putting them in the oven (because of their cakey texture, they did not flatten at all).

YUM!  Used all whole wheat flour and half a cup of applesauce instead of oil.  So delicious and easy.  Will be making these again...probably soon since I'll be devouring them quickly.

I've made these for years (recipes like this, but now this is my staple) and to my friends they are LEGENDARY.  Make them every Fall.  They're so soft and cake-y!  Also easy to make vegan, just add more pumpkin and omit the egg.  I want to try substituting the oil with pumpkin as well!  With lots of semisweet chocolate chips, one tsp pumpkin pie spice, and chopped pecans, they are better than ever.

Absolutely delicious, didn't change a thing. I didn't use walnuts, but I'm sure they would be equally delicious with them.

These cookies are definitely more like little muffins than cookies. They are extremely soft and moist and were a huge hit when I made them for my coworkers at both of my jobs. I even had to email links to the recipe. I didn't use nuts last year, but may try them this year.

Amazing... Every recipe I've tried for this type of cookie has been a disappointment. These are just right! Not hard and brownie like, not too soft. I had to bake them about 12 minutes. Left overs are delicious stored in the fridge! Printed recipe card and it said "12 servings". This makes about 28 large cookies!

They were wonderful! Had to tell my husband to stop eating them so I had enough to send in a care package. I cooked mine at 375 for 15 minutes and they were perfect. My oven tends to run a little cool though, so just tested the first batch with the recommended cook time and temp and adjusted. Made a batch without chocolate chips for my 1 year old and she loved them too! Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were great.  I was using pumpkin leftover from another recipe so I used slightly more than called for in the recipe.  I added a bit of extra flour to get the right dough consistency.  I also adjusted the spices after reading other reviews so I used 1 tsp of  cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I have a convection oven and the cookies were perfectly done after 10min @ 350F.

These were a huge hit, made first with my grandaughter who took the batch home with her.  Next day I made another batch for my husband to take to work.  His entire crew gave them a 5 star review.  Definitely a keeper!

Well, I substituted applesauce for the oil and splenda for the sugar and this recipe is much lower in calories.  I had doubled the recipe, but it called for 4 cups of choc. chips.  It was too many chips for me, but cookies are still pretty good!  I recommend!

These cookis are soooo good!! I made em 3 times in a row. They have a great texture & flavor. I used 1 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of 2 tsps cinnamon.  I also used milk choc chips instead of semi-sweet. I added some red food coloring to give them a nice pumpkiny color. My fiance & my kids loved them.

Delicious, and easy to make. They taste like a fresher version of the store-bought variety, which is what I was looking for. Be forewarned, they are homely little cookies, with a sort of sickly color and a puffy shape, but they are delightfully moist. They are reminiscent of the tops of pumpkin muffins. Cake-ier than cookielike, but just what I wanted.

these cookies were delicious!! I made them last night and didn't change a thing.. my morsels didn't melt all the way at first either, like some other reviewers, but after they set for an hour or so, they were gooey and perfect. Very fluffy, and the pumpkin was not overpowering. Definitely a keeper!

Sooo good!  Was looking for a way to use up some leftover pumpkin and this way wonderful.  Very light and fluffy, like a muffin top.  I did reduce the amount of chocolate chips per my preference.  Also I used a medium cookie scoop and got 24 cookies out of one batch.

I double this to make for my daughter's Thanksgiving party at school and they were a hit! I went with two container full of cookies and came home with half of one.   They started out a little big so I made my scoops a little smaller and everyone loved them still. They have a great thickness to them and are great warm with a glass of milk or coffee.

I used leftover pumpkin pie filling in addition to what's in this recipe. So probably another 1/2 cup of pumpkin, extra spice and some more egg/evap. milk and then I had to add another 1/2 cup of flour to be able to spoon it easily. Turned out wonderful! What a great recipe. :)

I made these cookies using the modifications some of the other users mentioned, applesauce instead of oil and added nutmeg and ginger. I doubled the recipe because I didn't think 12 cookies were enough and I ended up with 70! I find most cookie recipes are pretty true to their servings but this made way more. They were delicious though so I am not complaining!

There is too much cinnamon in this recipe.  The cookies look great but taste like spice- not pumpkin.  these are going to my husband's work, and now I have to find a new recipe.

I love these cookies!  They come out so soft and moist, and have less fat then a regular chocolate chip cookies!  I have made them several times, but yesterday I used white whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  The added spices gave them a stronger "fall" flavor.    I do normally have to cook them for around 13 minutes on 350.  The pumpkin makes them really moist so you do not have to under-cook them to get a soft cookie!

I have made these a few times.  They get good ratings from my work mates who eat them.  The most recent time I used butter instead of oil.  They came out fine, maybe a tad denser.  I only used 1 cup of chips and added 1 cup of dried cranberries.  I think next time I will add less baking powder and/or add an egg.  I don't like how these are so cake-like.  I rather they had a chewy texture.

These were fabulous. My hubby (who is really picky) loved them and so did my co-workers. They did come out cake-like, but it was nice to have a different type of chocolate chip cookie.

Cakey and delicious. I didn't have chocolate chips or nuts, so I just added raisins, and they were still good. (Although I am sure they would have been even better with chocolate.)

These cookies came out perfect!  They were so delicious, my whole family loved them, they were gone within 24 hours.  As long as you preheat the oven for 10 or 15 minutes, then these bake fine in 10 minutes.

We loved them!!! My husband gets weird about chocolate chip cookies, "Pumpkin? why mess up a perfectly good cookie!"  but he really liked them.  I made a small addition, a little pumpkin pie spice, and baked at 365 for 12 minutes!  Yummy!

FANTASTIC! Soft, chewy cookie that holds together well.  Flavor was perfect. I used to make these all the time for my family and lost the recipe. Just tried this one because it looked like a close match. Everyone said they were the BEST ever! Only change was to use part brown sugar, part white whole wheat & chopped pecans.

These are amazing. I have had problems with flat cookies, but not at all with these. I used a cup of fresh pumpkin that I had carved for Halloween. Then I added some nutmeg, ginger, and a little clove to the pumpkin. They turned out really good!

These is the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookie recipe! Because they are cake-like to begin with, I have easily substituted 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 applesauce, and egg beaters.

I was grateful for all the tips. I decreased the sugar about 1/4. I only used one cup of choc chips and I toasted pecans and added those. I added the food coloring and applesauce instead of oil. I added 2 TBLS of flax. I did the slam- the- cookie sheet tip. I added some nutmeg and cloves. I finally have pumpkin cookies that are fantastic!

I love this recipe. I make this every year for work and friends. The only thing that I do is use 2-3 drops of red food coloring. So when they end up looking like little pumpkins! I've share this with so many friends! Just plain yummy!

Fantastic cookies, so easy to make!  As a note to go here, I didn't have veggie oil and substituted butter but a little more than half of what it calls for and the cookies taste great!  I also cut back the sugar and used milk chocolate chips.  I am taking these to a post-halloween birthday event and anticipate 100% success.

I love how easy these were to prepare and that they held their shape.  I think the only thing these could use is a bit more spice- allspice and nutmeg will be added next time.

Next time I'll cut back on the chocolate chips, which overwhelmed the pumpkin flavor.  Otherwise, they were good.

These cookies are amazingly good!  I follow the recipe exactly as it reads.  The batter is a bit goopy, but don't worry about them spreading as they cook -- they tend to hold their shape extremely well.  The texture is almost cake-like.

So amazing!  I replaced half the oil with applesauce and used half whole wheat flour and half AP flour.  Really moist and tasty.  I also added some allspice, a little ginger, and little nutmeg.  I love these in the fall!!  I used fresh pumpkin puree, but I am sure the canned stuff would be great as well

These are very good. If you don't like choc chips use walnuts. Easy to make and made exactly as stated. Also, I agree that they taste better when put in the refrigerator, otherwise they get too soft and mushy. Will make again! Thanks!

I made these with fresh butternut squash and half whole wheat flour, half white, and it was very good. I will use fewer 
chocolate chips and less cinnamon next time. Edit to add: made a second time just as written, except that I forgot to dissolve the baking powder. They turned out perfect! Love them. They would still be fine with fewer chocolate chips though.

I will definitely be making these cookies again.  The only problem I had was the baking time - it took my cookies about 13 minutes to bake.  I liked the rustic, lumpy look to the cookies and they were amazing straight out of the fridge!

These are good, but not as good as the George Duran recipe. Of course that recipe has a lot more sugar and fat, but they are more moist and have a better texture. These were slightly more biscuit-like. I also like to add more of the pumpkin pie spices, like ginger, ground clove and nutmeg.

we made these cookies last night at midnight! they were fantastic! they are sooo soft and moist :) like everyone says, they are cakelike. so we put a little cream cheese frosting on top! the pumpkin flavor is pretty subtle (we even added some pumpkin spice) but these are very good :) they went great with my coffee this morning!

LOVED these cookies!  This is my favorite cookie and this recipe was perfect.  I did change one thing.  I added one teaspoon of nutmeg as one reviewer suggested.  PERFECT!!

Made a double batch for my kids last week.  They didn't last more than a couple days.  I made another double batch for my co-workers and they loved them.

This was a very wet batter, it was hard to form the cookies but after letting it sit out for a bit the dough became manageable. The cookies are very cakey, not dense like a chocolate chip cookie. They were delicious, just not what I expected!

I should have been more thorough in reading the reviews.  This was way too cake-like, but the flavors are good.  I added ginger and nutmeg.

with only a couple changes. I used white chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and used less like others suggested and I used my version of a homemade pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon. Great flavor.

These cookies are AMAZING! I used half whole wheat and half white flour to make it a drop healthier, and bakes about 12 minutes.  They came out perfect! LOVE them and will make again for holidays.

AWESOME cookies! I had another recipe for these cookies that included brown sugar and oats, and these are way better (my husband agrees with me on this). I too added a teaspoon of nutmeg, and found that it added a perfect amount of spice. And, like a previous rater, I baked this for 12 minutes at 365 --- perfect.

I knew that these cookies were going to be cake-like, but after I made the first batch I thought the consistency was a bit too weird for a cookie.  So, I baked the 2nd half of the batter in a small pan - baked for about 20 minutes.  This made the recipe seem better to me for some reason.  Not sure I will make this again.

These cookies are cake like but very delicious.  I altered the recipe to make it a bit healthier and use 1/2 cup applesauce instead of vegetable oil and 1/4 cup of egg beaters instead of eggs.  I also used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of other spices.  I do WW and these came out to 1 pts each! delicious and nutritious!

Awesome!  My husband, who swares he hates pumpkin, even liked this recepie!  I used fresh pumpkin that I had frozen from last season and because after thawing it is more runny, I had to add a little more flour to the batter to make the cookies hold shape and not turn into pancackes.  I also added pumpkin pie spice in addition to the cinnamon...yummmmmmmy!

The first time I had a cookie like this, it was from the Ralph's bakery. I LOVED them! This recipe is JUST like it. I won't have to buy them anymore. I can make my own! Delicious and moist. I substitute with wheat flour, but thes are so good!

Loved  these!  Secret to pumpkin flavor is using organic canned pumpkin.  The pumpkin is richer and tastier than regular libby brands

I don't even like pumpkin pie or most pumpkin-flavored food, but my sister made these tonight, and they are amazing. The pumpkin flavor is very light. The texture is soft and cake-like.  She made these exactly as directed with the exception of the walnuts, and I can honestly say that these are the first pumpkin-flavored baked goods I'd even go near. They are just wonderful!

I thought these were just okay in my opinion. Too cakey for my liking in a cookie, not enough pumpkin flavor, and were more savory than sweet. I think in the future (if I were going to make them again), I would add more spices to try and liven up the cookie. My mom really liked them though; said they were something she'd eat with tea. Hope this helps!

It is around 2 months after I made these and I just wanted to add that I froze a couple.. they are AWESOME right out of the freezer! I may make them again just to freeze and eat! :-)

I love them!  My husband came home asking if I could make pumpkin cookies like the ones he just ate at work.  For the first time they where better then the ones he ate at work!  Very cake like but oh so soft and yummy.  I do suggest a pinch of nutmeg and a bit less chocolate chips. Thank you for sharing.

These are AMAZING!  They are so soft, sticky, and cakey.  Absolute magic.  My roommates and I would eat probably 3 or 4 a day (starting with breakfast).

Years later, I am still making these.  I add pumpkin pie spice (a few sprinkles) and usually make them in a mini muffin tin.  They have a bit more structural integrity that way.

This recipe is tasty! I made with the following adjustments; 3/4 cup sugar, around 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1.5 tsp of cinnamon. They were fabulous; however, they weren't a cookie per se. I would describe them as muffin bites. I gave it four stars because of the fact this recipe doesn't really give you cookies.

very moist, most everyone approved. I thought the chocolate chips did not complement the pumpkin flavor, and that the pumpkin flavor was less than spectacular.

This is an awesome recipe. I will make it everytime I have pumpkin around. I grow my own pumpkins and look for recipes to use them up. This recipe will certainly be at the top of the list. I did find I made 35 cookies out of the batch and I had to cook them about 5 minutes longer to get the nice brown tops. They certainly don't last long around here.

I think I can honestly say these are the best cookies in the world! They are so soft and fluffy and they never burn! And did I mention they are SO delicious! These are the only cookies I make any more and I am always getting compliments!

These cookies are delicious and they were a hit at my office party and in my class. I didn't use the walnuts because of my allergies, but other than that, I made it exactly the way the recipe states.  The recipe was simple, an inexpensive. Great recipe. They are much better than regular chocolate chip cookies!

I subtitue half of the pumpkin puree with half a cup of pumpkin pie mix.  They don't bake up as fluffy but they are more flavorful.  I also use chopped almonds for some crunch.

Yum! There were very good and easy to make. I made half with and half without chocolate chips and they were both very good. The only change I made was replacing the oil with applesauce. ***Made these later as muffins with oatmeal, less sugar and more cinnamon and they were great!

This cookie is fair at best.  I followed the directions to a T.  You can't even taste the pumpkin at all in this cookie.  I dont understand all of the rave reviews considering how mediocre this is.  I am very disappointed.

I LOVED these cookies.  Various members of my family liked them more than others did, but some members of my family are pretty picky, and others just do not like sweets very much at all.  I, however, thought these cookies were amazing.  I prefer them fresh out of the oven, but they were also good after being refrigerated, and they held up pretty well just setting out in a ziploc bag, as well.  I did follow some tips from other reviewers and used extra pumpkin pie seasonings and also used brown sugar instead of white.  Excellent holiday treat!

I made these a couple weeks ago - and was blown away on how amazing they were! A definite hit with my friends & my family! they were all gone before I could fully enjoy them myself!  The moist cake-like texture was amazing! Next time I make these, I'm going to try adding more pumpkin for a stronger flavor!

These just came out of my oven and I'm not too impressed. They are overly cake-like, and are not especially pretty to look at. Most importantly, the chocolate chips just don't work (and I LOVE chocolate) with the pumpkin flavor. I just compared this recipe with my grandma's, and notice two glaring differences; instead of the oil, she used 1/2 C butter. And the baking powder appears to be completely superfluous. If you're going to use this recipe, I highly suggest doing those two things differently. Bon appetite. :)

AMAZING...! I just made these cookies for the very first time. I followed another reviewers recommendation and added a few drops of red food coloring to keep them that extra "pumpkin" orange. I followed all directions to a "T" but baked at 360 for 15 minutes. The cookies came out perfectly baked and delicious.

I changed flour to 1 1/3 all purpose plus 2/3 cup bean flour.  1tsp cinnamon 1 1/2 pumpkin pie spice and baked at 360 for 14 minutes.  I immediately moved them to cooling racks and let the cookie sheet cool before next batch.  I live at about 5400 feet and they came out just perfect.  They have a light cake texture and hold together well.  Next time I may try reducing the oil a little and see what happens.  The bean flour adds fiber and protein and does not change the flavor.

I prefer these with butterscotch chips and pecans, but my husband loves them with chocolate chips so I split the batch and do both. I also use 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice plus 1/2-1tsp cinnamon. It my oven 360 degrees for 12 minutes works best, but that will be different for everyone. Just make sure you take them out when they are nice and soft still!

This is the best recipe!! Very easy to make. They stay soft and moist. I have made them several times in the past couple of weeks as everyone who's tried one asks me to bake them. I love eating them too, by far my favorite cookie.

DELICIOUS!!! These were absolutely amazing!!! I only made a couple tiny alterations - used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and omitted the walnuts (don't need no nuts getting in the way of my chocolate!) :) My yield was more like 3.5 dozen rather than 2...

Followed this recipe closely, but turned out more like cookie-shaped pumpkin bread - not my favorite.  I used chocolate chunks, which were good.  Had to bake for about 14 minutes per tray.

Really fun cookies - almost exactly chocolate chip standard except with pumpkin instead of shortening and butter. The chocolate and nuts were very welcome surprises every few bites. :)  They took almost 4 minutes longer to cook and next time I will add more flour for a cookie you can actually hold. They also bled orange which was to be expected since that was most of their fabric. But the gooey consistency and orange greasiness made them hard to present.   My husband really loves them and we'll make them again for his work Thanksgiving. Great seasonal twist!

I followed the recipe exactly other than cooking them longer (12-14 minutes) and simply doubling the recipe. We shared them with the entire neighborhood and EVERYONE loved them and asked for the recipe. I've been looking for a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie that didn't taste like crisco or flour and this is definitely it.   These are super moist, thick, cakey cookies. I can't say enough about these, thank you SO MUCH for sharing! EXCELLENT!

These were pretty good!  I used fresh pumpkin puree, so the color was lighter than if I had used the canned solid pack.  Also, I found I only had milk chocolate chips on hand so I used those and omitted the nuts from the first sheet.  The cookies were very cake-like, but I really thought they lacked flavor at first - I figured maybe it was the combination of my using fresh pumpkin and milk chocolate, which I'm really not a fan of.  So, I added chopped walnuts and the second sheet came out better, but still not great.  I added some cinnamon chips to the rest and THOSE - with the milk chocolate chips, walnuts and cinnamon chips - were by far the best.  I think for my tastes I'll definitely use semi-sweet chocolate chips next time, but I think I'll also still add in cinnamon chips for some oomph!  Ended up enjoying this cookie very much - Thanks for sharing!

These were great and made the house smell wonderful!  I added 1 tsp of nutmeg, used applesauce instead of oil, pecans instead of walnuts and baked at 365 for 13 minutes.  I found that the smaller the spoonfuls I made on the cookie sheet the more we liked them!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are fantastic! I used 1.5 cups of fresh pumpkin instead of the pumpkin puree, and like other reviewers I added a tsp. nutmeg for a bit more spice. Delicous!! Thanks for sharing.

good, but mine did not come out looking like the picture, maybe because I didn't use nuts, so they came out smooth vs. chunky looking

These came out really moist and soft, which was wonderful and my kids loved them. I really like a stronger pumpkin flavor and I feel like the choc chips were all I could taste. I'm going to try making them again with more pumpkin and less choc chips.

These were really good. My only issue was they didn't have enough flavor for me and I don't necessarily like puffy cookies. Next time I'd add more spices. Plus I didn't have chocolate chips so I used M&Ms. Still good though!

Very good!  My family and co-workers love them!  I read some reviews first...very helpful.  I used whole wheat flour and added nutmeg and all spice.  I think they'd be really good with raisins, too. I had to bake them a little longer and the idea about smacking the cookie sheet onto the counter before putting them in the oven worked well.  I slammed 1 bunch but not the other and you can tell that they look different.

These were pretty good cookies. I made them with canola oil, 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 white, & 1/2 cup packed brown sugar.  The pumpkin part was very yummy but seemed overshadowed by the chocolate chips.  I think next time I will use only 1 cup of chocolate chips or substitute raisins instead.

These turned out great! I was a little hesitant because they had chocolate and pumpkin, but I was pleasantly surprised!  Instead of food coloring to make them "oranger", you can use brown sugar for the white sugar and it helps keep them a darker color. Happy Baking!

We LOVE this recipe.  I was out of the baking soda so I subbed with an extra egg and they turned out great.  I did cook at a higher temp.  about 265 for 12 mins.

These are delicious and foolproof! The only change I made was fewer chocolate chips, --> 1 1/4 C. not two. I also added rough chopped, toasted walnuts. They are not overly sweet or too pumpkin-y, just right. I am very careful to not over mix and they come out nice and 'cake-like'. Also, they really do seem to taste better chilled. I might add a dab of molasses and other suggested spices, but excellent as is.

This is a nice recipe. Tasted great (I added a bit of nutmeg, as suggested by other users). The only reason I didn't give this a five was the slightly odd texture (mine turned out so light that they were almost un-cookielike), and I also needed to add another half cup of flour because the dough seemed a bit too runny to mold into balls.

These are sooo good! They are soft -- the texture is like a cross between cake and cookies. And I do agree with putting them in the fridge -- they are delicious cold!

These were delicious. We made them for a bake sale, and ended up eating half ourselves. Made a second batch where we substituted banana for the pumpkin and they were just as good.

These cookies were well received, but I don't know if I'll make them again.  The pumpkin flavor is vague and the texture reminds me of a muffin top rather than a solid cookie.  They aren't bad, but I'm sure that better cookies exist.

Out of all the pumpkin chocolate chip cookies I've tried, these are by far the best.  My boyfriend loves the ones from a local bakery and I've been searching for a recipe that is similar.  This is the closest so far.

Our family LOVES these cookies.  I've made them 5 different times, and each time they turn out perfectly!  They are fluffy, cake-like, and full of flavor.  I add twice the cinnamon, 2 tsp nutmeg, and replace the oil with applesauce.  Sometimes I pour the batter into a muffin pan and bake a couple minutes longer.  My husband likes the muffins for breakfast!

These cookies are AWESOME! We have a natural foods store in my town that make pumpkin cookies that are very similar to these and I have always wanted the recipe.  These, by far, blow them out of the water.  I've made these cookies twice now and actually left out one cup of chocolate chips the second time.  I also use the 60% cacao choc. chips by Ghiardelli.  They add an extra zing to the cookie.  Thanks for the great recipe!

awesome!  I made some substitutions to make them a little healthier.  I did half oil (canola) and half applesauce.  I also did half whole wheat and half white whole wheat.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of two.  I only used the white of the egg also. Definitely will make again.

very good flavor but not enough to get over the texture after they have cooled.  if you eat them IMMEDIATELY out of the oven they are delicious, but just not very practical for cookies.  i made these for my son's daycare Christmas party and the kids took one bite and spit them out.  :(

I thought this recipe was going to turn out great, but it did not.  The "cookies" turned out kind of bland and by the second day, they were moist & more like fruit bars.  Very messy, not worth the $$ or the time & effort.

Wonderful cookie! I add nearly 1 more cup of flour to make them more cake-like. I'm not sure if it's a high altitude thing or what, but it perfects this recipe (for us).

Everyone who has eaten these cookies has loved them, and then asked for the recipe!
A few tips:
1. don't use applesauce instead of oil, the cookies come out more like bread and are too tough.
2. substitute mini reeses pieces, or peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips. Sounds weird, but tastes delicious.
3. as you take cookies out of the oven, or a minute before, flatten cookies with a spatula. This way they look more like cookies than little puffs. Also, I think they taste better.
All around a great recipe and I love that it doesn't have butter in it!

Really delicious. Made the recipe without the walnuts, and didn't put in the full two cups of chocolate chips. The pumpkin is pretty subtle and I think if I had the chocolate would just be overwhelming. Very soft, cake-like cookies. The only thing they lack is a little bit of crustiness to make them perfect. The recipe could easily be adapted to make some mighty fine scones.

I used pumpkin spice instead of the other spices, it tasted just like pumpkin pie! My only complaint is that they are too soft, I ended up calling them "cakesters" instead of cookies. The flavor was excellent though!

Yummy! Nice cake-like output as many similar recipes indicated.  A great way to get soft cookies.  Per other reviews I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (1 tsp of nutmeg would have provided a similar outcome if you don't have pumpkin pie spice onhand).  Turned out perfect when cooked on parchment paper.  I dropped smaller spoonfuls (size of half dollar) to stretch recipe and took about 10-11 min at 350 for perfect, golden cookies.  Delicious!

I loved these cookies!  I did make a few modifications...

1/4 cup brown sugar to replace white sugar
 and I added
1/4 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp clove
1/4 tsp ginger

They turned out spicy and decadent.  I thought they were better at room temp rather than warm because the pumpkin and spice flavors were more prominent.

I make another Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe on a regular basis for my family.  

Yesterday I decided to try a different one for a change.  I too added a dash of nutmeg.

I will make this recipe again however, I will likely reduce the cinnamon to maybe 2 tsp rather than the called for 1 tbsp.  

Thanks for sharing with us.

This recipe was great! I made it at the request of a coworker, who wanted it for her b-day instead of cake. I did make one change (not sure if someone else already suggested this), but I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and cut it back to 1 T for 24 sevings.

I was looking for a great recipe like this for Thanksgiving.  A local grocery store bakes these and I wanted to make them myself.  My husband and daughter loved these!  So did our family at Thanksgiving.  They all want the recipe.  I followed the recipe step by step and didn't add anything.  The only thing I would add would be to make sure you grease the cookie sheet each time since this batter tends to stick - Delicious!

I tried something weird with this recipe and attempted to make chocolate pumpkin cookies (no chips).  I added 2/3 cup cocoa powder to the batter; no addition liquid needed.  They were interesting cookies but not a wow-cookie I was hoping for.  I'll be leaving the recipe alone for now except I did add extra vanilla and spice (used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon).  The consistency and the ease of the actual cookie were great.

Exactly what I was looking for!!  I had some from a store bakery and said I have to find a recipe, and this was it!  These are soft, cake-like cookies with a mild pumpkin flavor.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  In my second batch I only put half the amount of chocolate chips.  I made the mistake of storing in a ziploc bag...they are too soft and slightly sticky.  Thank you---great fall cookie!!!

I have found what I have been missing in chocolate chip cookies.  This cookie is soft and cakelike with a hint of cinnamon and awesome chocolate flavor.  It was so easy and fast to make, I was able to make it and bake it after work before friends came over.  Definitely a hit with me, my husband, and everyone that has had them.  LOVE THESE COOKIES!!!

These were good the first day but were fantastic the second day!!   I would definitely recommend making these a day or two ahead.

Very delicious!  Because I have food allergies in my family, I had to substitute 1T flaxmeal+3T water for the egg - it worked great!  I also only used whole wheat pastry flour.  The texture of the cookies was soft and moist.  They have a wonderful flavor and were quickly gobbled up by my children.

This review is compared to all cookies, not pumpkin cc cookies since I have never made or even had them before. So compared to all the cookies I could possibly have these were so so. 

I did like the light cakey texture of this cookie and they made my house smell divine.  I thought they tasted good, I would just rather spend the calories on a plain chocolate chip cookie.  I will probably not make them again but I am glad I tried them.    I may try with white chocolate..

I substituted honey for sugar and dark choc. chunks (I use both of these subs quite often which gives a healthier result).  Thank you for sharing these the pumpkin made it so moist!

These cookies are awesome!  I got so many compliments, and was told by several people that they tasted just like the ones that at the health food store! Of course, they use organic everything in theirs, and drizzle chocolate on top.  I plan to make these gems for our school's band tour bake sale - they'll be a big hit, I'm sure!

I didn't really like it. It was very airy and cakey...not really the "cookie" texture that I like. If you like substituting applesauce for oil in your baked goods then you'll love this. I HATE that weird airy-spongie texture that pureed fruit (or veggies) give baked goods. The pumpkin taste is completely hidden, even though I took other people's suggestions and used less cinnamon and added more of a pumpkin pie spice. It tastes like a bad, spicey, chocolate chip cookie. Will NOT be using THIS recipe again.

These are good.  I followed some other reviewer's suggestions to add more pumpkin, and use less cinnamon, supplementing nutmeg and allspice.  Next time I made these, though, I'll do them as bars (the consistency is kind of like brownie), and add cream cheese frosting.

Was a good cake cookie, but I was expecting more of a pumpkin flavor.

I would have given this 4 stars but the cookies I brought to a party went fast and several people told me howmuch they liked them so I gave it 5. I used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet. I read the reviews and was prepared for the cake-like texture- now that I have tried it - it is not my preference for pumpkin cookies. Good solid pumpkin choc chip cookie recipe.

These are fantastic!  I made some changes as per other reviewers recommendations, such as using 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, and also slamming the cookie sheets down to spread out the dough.  I know these will be a hit tonight!

my hubby and i LOVE this recipe! i did tweak a few things though. Since i use whole wheat flour, the first batch was a little dry-so the next batch i added more pumpkin and some brown sugar. they came out perfect! this recipe is a keeper! thanks for sharing it..

not quite pumpkin-y enough for me. i suggest less chocolate chips, to simply enhance the flavor instead of overpowering it. these are very cake-like, and get almost mushy after a day or two. but still a yummy fall treat -- i took some to school with me and everyone enjoyed them!

The first batch I overcooked, they did not look done after 10 minutes. But the second batch I let them cool after about 11 or 12 minutes of baking and they were perfect. I loved them.

This is the first recipe I made using homemade pumpkin puree and they are great!  My only change was to leave out the walnuts.  One bit of advice:  If you let the dough get cold, adjust the cooking time.  The ones that were room temperature cooked perfectly at 10 minutes.  The ones I had put in the fridge were doughy and dense when cooked for 10 minutes.

Great, simple recipe.  I did have to cook longer than 10 minutes, and as other reviews suggested, I put 1/2 the cinnamon amount and the other 1/2 was a combination of nutmeg, allspice and cloves.  I also used more pumpkin than the recipe called for - maybe another 1/3 c.  Got rave reviews and were gone in a flash.  Thanks.

Not a pretty cookie, but very soft and tasty. I think next time I might add some cream cheese frosting.

I gave this a 5 because it was really good but not necessarily as cookies! I decided to replace the oil with applesauce and I dont know if that what did it, but the first couple cookies I made were not cookie texture they were definately loaf texture. So with the rest of the batter I put it in a loaf pan and the pumpkin choc chip loaf tasted so good! It is VERY chocolatey so if u like lots of chocolate leave the 2 cups in. If not use 1 cup :)

I made just a couple of changes to this great cookie recipe. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. I also added a few drops of red food coloring too. The batter was very thin and I added about 3/4 cup flour. The recipe easily makes two dozen cookies by using a small cookie dough scoop. The time specified was exactly right in my oven. 350 degrees for 10 minutes.

Perfect! I was looking for a cake-like pumpkin cookie after having one from a store bakery.  And this is it! I had to take them to work to stop myself from eating them. I did add a couple of minutes to the baking time.

I liked the texture of these cookies but they were very bland. I first made these with half the sugar and just cinnamon, very bland.  I then added some ginger and nutmeg to these and the rest of the sugar.  they were a little better. I will not be making these again.

I can best describe these as a muffin top!  They really aren't a cookie.  It's more like a pumpkin bread in the shape of a cookie.  The taste was pretty good.  Very moist so that's a plus.  I'm a huge chocolate fan but to me, 2 cups of chocolate chips was a little excessive.  I have to agree with the reviewer that said it wasn't an attractive cookie.  LOL  Back to regular chocolate chip for us!

I expected the cake-like texture, but I wasn't too pleased with my results. I didn't taste much of the pumpkin, and the texture was a weird cake texture, not like the other cake-like cookies I've made.

Love, love, LOVE this wonderful little cookie! I started making them last year and they have quickly become a favorite that I make from October all the way through Christmas! They are great right out of the oven, but they also taste great out of the fridge. I strongly recommend keeping these cookies refrigerated, as they are more cake-like.

These were very tasty. I would recommend adding a few drops of red food coloring to the batter because the cookies come out a pale orange, so they'll look more presentable if they are a brighter orange.  I also added a few extra spices (nutmeg and allspice). Overall, VERY yummy!! :D

Well I did use whole wheat flour, applesauce and 1/2 splenda and even with the added pumpkin spice that other reviewers suggested I found them lacking something maybe some brown sugar..def. moist and cake-like..not like a cookie at all but will make these again with a tad more spice and sugar...thanks for sharing =)

this was a pretty good recipe easy to follow but needed a few adjustments, I was doing it for a retreat and used the red and yellow food coloring to make them more orange. Also I read other reviews and agree that it definitely needed a little more spice so I found in my cupboard a can of pumpkin pie spice that had it all and was so delicious in the cookies.

Very good. I used all whole wheat flour, half splenda and half sugar, and half applesauce and half oil. 5 stars when they are straight from the oven. Not as good the next day, but still yummy enough to eat.

These are sooooo good and turned out really soft (almost too soft to carry, but that doesn't bother me!). Super-easy to make with fairly common ingredients. Great recipe!

These are great fall cookies! Easy to make and very yummy. I did not add food coloring as other reviewers suggested; the cookies have a nice orangish color without the coloring. I did do about 1/4 less cinnamon as I wanted the cookies to have a stronger pumpkin taste. Next time I think I will 1/2 the cinnamon and maybe even add a bit more pumpkin. Try these, you'll be glad you did!

This recipe was outstanding!  The cookies turned out super moist and not too sweet, I added a little more spices such as nutmeg and ground ginger.  Couldn't have turned out better. I loved the texture of this cookie.

This recipe was yummy, but all I could taste was the chocolate! When I make them again, I will double the spices and use less chocolate chips. Other than that, this recipe was great!

Delicious!!!! I made a few minor changes such as half white and half wheat flour,only about a cup of chocolate chips, i substituted applesauce for the oil as well as adding nutmeg and ginger!  They didn't taste as pumpkiny as i had hoped, so next time im going to add more pumpkin! These cookies are definitely a keeper!

I like this recipe. It was the first time I had ever made pumpkin anything. It turned out great. 
I took the advice of another review and cut the amount of spices to 1 3/4 teaspoon. For the spices, I used about 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. 
The mix itself was extremely easy to drop onto the cookie sheets. As another review warns, the shape the dough is in when it enters the oven is the shape it comes out in. I just used to small spoons to round off the cookies and they came out fine. 
I will definitely be baking these again near the holidays. Thank you!

These cookies are great, and a constant request for holiday parties!  I did replace the oil for shortening, as it kept the moist cake-like texture without the greasy look.  I also added a little pumpkin spice (about 1 tsp) to enhance the pumpkin yumminess!

These are so good. Better than my favorites from the bakery. I used more pumpkin, some nutmeg and cloves, and a few less chocolate chips. The cake like texture is great, and they are good cold. Easy and delicious!!

A very good recipe for this cookie! My only thing would have to be the amount of chocolate chips used. Next time I make them, I'm going to use about 1/2 cup less of chocolate chips. It's almost drowning the whole cookie part. Other than that, very good.

SO GOOD!!  These cookies are so easy to make and are very delicious!  I followed other user's advice on puting in less cinnamon than called for.  Also, 10 minutes wasn't long enough to bake the cookies, so I left it in for an extra 6-8 minutes.  I will definitey make these cookies again!

These were the best pumpkin chocolate chip cookies I have had.  The only problem I had was that 10 minutes was nowhere near enough time to bake them through.  My first batch was completely raw in the top/middle.  (I made more cookies than the recipe said, so I assume my cookies were smaller too...) In the end, it looks like 15-16 minutes is a better baking time.  With the time adjusted, I would recommend giving this cookie a try - even if you are not a huge pumpkin fan. (I hate pumpkin pie!)  :-)

These cake-like cookies are delicious. They'd be improved by a bit less cinnamon and a bit more pumpkin.

These are a family favorite.  I did make a few minor changes though, I only use half the oil and substitute the rest with applesauce, used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose and only used 1 teaspoon cinnamon and added half a teaspoon ground ginger and a fourth a teaspoon cloves to make it taste more like pumpkin pie.

first time i baked i used a cookies scooper and the cookies didnt spread at all during baking so i was stuck with bon-bon shapped cookies that looked very unappeaitizing. next time i spread the cookies outs which made them look more cookies shaped but as mentioned before, these are not the most eye-pleasing cookies. four stars thought because they ARE delicous and very easy.

I made this many times last year for holiday parties and they were a hit! I have and will continue to make these again,, in some batches I used regualr chocolate chips and in some I used white chocolate chips and both were good, the white chocolate was a bit sweeter though. Also, I never used nuts in the recipes and I have had them with nuts and preferrably I feel it's better without them! I hope you enjoy these as much as I did!!!

These were decent but disappointing after reading the raving praises from other reviewers.  I followed the suggestions of 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice, and only 1 cup of chocolate chips (which was still almost too much).  But the cookies ended up like a kind of dry pumpkin bread.  Something needs to be altered to make them moister.

these were so much better than i expected.  my 7yo son helped make the batter and kept saying how gross the pumpkin smelled.  but once they came out of the oven and he tried them he said he couldn't understand how a cookie with that 'nasty pumpkin' in it could taste so great!  i did add a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to mine.  the first batch i made using white choc/semi-sweet choc swirled chips.  (that batch is my favorite)  the second batch i used just semi-sweet choc chips.  passed them out in the neighborhood and they were a huge hit!  even got requests for the recipe!

These cookies are awesome and so easy to make.  I did add 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. Kudos Jennifer!

I actually used pureed Kobacha squash (a sweet winter sqaush) instead of pumpkin and the cookies turned out delicious.

I made them to spec - but would change them in the future.  As other reviewers suggested, I would definitely decrease the number of chocolate chips - I found them to be overwhelming... I really like pumpkin so I may even try them without the chocolate in the future.

This is a great cakey-cokie recipe! I reduced the cinnamon, and the chocolate chips (way too many). Also, I would recommend that when spooning the mixture onto the cookie, sheet, flatten the balls a bit, too guarantee a more even baking.

I made these with whole wheat flour and dark chocolate chips--they spread out a lot on the pan and were really soft.  I think next time I might use mini chocolate chips?

I only thought they were okay... more like a muffin top than a cookie. But, I took them to a game watch and the guys couldn't stop eating/raving about them.

These pumpkin chocolate chip cookies weren't as fabulous as other cookies I've had. Good, but didn't stand out as much! I'm hoping they're better the next day like most cookies are. :)

These cookies were so moist and delicious!  They are a nice mixture of chocolate and pumpkin which gives your taste buds a nice treat.  These cookies traveled well as I shipped them overseas to a friend in the military who commented on how soft they still were!

These hit the spot!  I did do a couple of things slightly different.  I only did about 1 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I also forgot to mix the baking soda in the milk before adding it.  I don't think it really changed anything.  I didn't add nuts, either, since my kids don't really like them.  These were such a perfect fall treat!

I may have made the cookies too big, but what I made were very soft, thick and not much like a cookie.  They needed more pumpkin spices to bring out the pumpkin more.

I didn't really like these.  Not much pumpkin flavor, and I thought the amount of chocolate chips contributed to this. I made the recipe to the T, so I doubt I will try them again.

delicious when cold. added chocolate chunks instead of chips (i like chunks better). substituted apple sauce for the oil. halved the recipe and came out with about 12 thick cookies (didn't spread out when baked, used about 1.5-2 tablespoons per cookie). mmm so filling with milk.

Very good recipe.  I often combine semisweet and milk chocolate chips.  Perhaps I make the cookie dough mounds too big on the cookie sheet, but I do find that the cookies need to bake for about 15 minutes to get all the way done.

These were such a hit over Thanksgiving that I'm making them again for my annual holiday cookie exchange.  They are wonderfully soft and chewy.  I had to cook them for about 12 minutes rather than 10, and found that the yield was over 3 dozen rather than 2 dzn.

This is one of the BEST cookie recipies.  The cookies were moist, and got better and better each day (I think they made it two).  They did not dry out.  The only thing I did differently was to add one large box of vanilla pudding mix and increase the amount of spice I used (I like the kick).  Absolutely perfect! It's hard to find a bonafied good recipie.  This is it.

This is by far my family's favorite cookie. This recipe comes out perfect every time I make it, and it has become a Fall staple in our home. I also agree that they are best cold, and I enjoy mine with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

Great taste.  Everyone loved them.  I was looking for a recipe that would taste like the cookies I buy at a local bakery and these were pretty close and a lot cheaper to make than buying the ones at the bakery!

This recipe produced fantastic, moist, soft  yummy cookies! I modified it by using freshly ground whole wheat flour (hard white wheat)instead of the white flour and added a tbsp of gluten and they were really great. My husband and 3 yr old daughter loved them! I will make these over and over again. I highly recommend these.
