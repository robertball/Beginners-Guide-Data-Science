WOW !!!  I made this cake at Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws and it was such a success I think this may be my staple contribution each year. I took someone's suggestion on toasting the pecans in butter before adding it to the cake and instead of margarine, I used unsalted butter (since one person said the cake was somewhat salty).  Instead of using whipped cream - I made crumb cake crumbs and baked them on during the last 15 minutes of baking (to make crumbs: use 2 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp cinnamon 1 1/2 stick unsalted butter melted - I mixed them all together with my hands and put them on top of the pecan/pumpkin/cake mixture).  The crumbs, buttery pecans, cake mix & pumpkin mixture was so unbelievable (although filling) everyone raved about it !!!!  I think next year though I will cut back on the sugar and butter as it is such a sweet cake and rich cake having one sliver is almost too much to eat and there's no room for other desserts !  Thank you for this superb recipe !!!  YUMMMM !

I made this for an office party and it got rave reviews.  However, when I make it again for Christmas, I will cut the cake mix in half.  The crumb top was so thick it had to be eaten upside down to get through it.  Also, I will use unsalted butter.  Instead of whipped topping, I melted a can of cream cheese frosting in the microwave and drizzled it over the finished cake.  Yum.

Awesome!  Very nice fall dessert.  I even adjusted it a bit and it was still marvelous.  I decreased the sugar to 1 cup and decreased the butter to 1/2 cup.  I mixed 1/3 cup of flaxseed meal into the cake mix to make up for the missing butter--a sneaky way to make up some much needed omega-3s.  Everyone loved this dessert, even my 5 year old.

Tip: It doesn't mention in the recipe, but I line the pan with parchment paper (greased and floured), and when the dessert is baked and cooled, lift and  turn it over onto a serving platter so that the crumb mixture becomes the crust and the pumpkin is on top. The paper should peel off smoothly. For the topping, mix one tub of whipped topping, one block cream cheese (room temp.), and 1/2 cup powdered sugar until smooth. Spread over top of dessert. I also only use 3 eggs instead of 4 for the pumpkin mixture, 1 cup sugar, and toast the pecans. I hope this is helpful!

Way too runny, had to cook almost two hours covered so as not to burn the nuts.  2 cans of 15 oz. pumpkin puree is needed!!!!  I found another recipe online that is exactly the same as this one but with 29 oz. can pumpkin puree.  That seems right.  Used unsalted butter because I don't like margarine.  I will try this recipe again with the modifications.

I shouldn't rate this so high since I changed the recipe up so much but since it was the basis I think it deserves 5 stars.  Most of my changes came from other reviews: liberal with the amount of pumpkin; reduce eggs to only 3; reduce sugar to under 1 cup; use spice cake mix; blend cake mix, nuts & melted butter all together in crumb mixture and then crumble over pumpkin mix; cover with foil for 45 min. then remove foil for last 20-25.
Phew! That's a lot of changes! But totally worth it. I'm already looking forward to sneaking some for breakfast.

This absolutely is a favorite dessert of our family. I use my own homemade pumpkin pie spice, add a pinch of salt instead of a whole teaspoon and butter instead of margerine. Excellent as is but over the top yummy with whipped topping or french vanilla ice cream. This dosen't last any longer than past dessert at family gatherings--two days if I've made it for the four of us.

This recipe is WONDERFUL!!  I am not a big pumpkin pie fan, but this is great!  Make sure you cook it long enough, so the pumpkin layer sets up and the top layer gets cooked through so it has some "crunch"  (I baked mine in a Pampered Chef 9x13 stoneware baker for 70 minutes: perfect!)  The pecans are a MUST, they add a needed taste!  I have made this for the last 3 years for Thanksgiving and Christmas, rather than pie.  It's much easier, and much better than plain old pumpkin pie.  I always have people asking for the recipe!  Thank you!

This is very good and a quick recipe.  My family really liked this one.  I did use a white cake mix when I was out of the yellow and it worked just as good. I have frozen part of it before and when it was thawed we both thought the flavor was even better than when first made. Personally it seems to have a better taste at room temp. or from the fridge.

Excellent dessert. Very tasty. I love pumpkin and this one is definitely a keeper! It is best served warm with real whipped cream!

Wonderful recipe! I have made it with homemade butternut squash puree as well as sweetpotato puree as well and both could easily be passed off as pumpkin! I upped the quantity of puree (no matter what I used) to two cans (30 oz. total) and bumped the sugar down to 1 c. Rather than top with the whipped topping, I thouroughly coated the top with about 2 c. finely chopped pecans (my grampa grows pecans so I have endless access to them). Another favorite recipe that I will be making again and again...

Its time for the fall line-up of desserts! This one will be on our fav list. We served it warm with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. For more flavor, be sure to toast your pecans. Thanks for a great pumpkin pie alternative, Nora!

I hate pumpkin pie, can't stand it - but this cake is AWESOME!! I have officially declared I will never made another pumpkin pie but will make this from here on out. I didn't use this recipe but used one out of a Betty Crocker Cookbook - everything was the same except the cookbook called for Betty Crocker brand Golden Vanilla cake mix.  I highly recommend anyone trying this recipe for the first time use this cake mix instead of plain yellow cake mix as the Golden Vanilla has a wonderful vanilla flavor that I think will take an already exceptional recipe and take it out of this world. 

Friends have asked me to make another one but use sweet potato instead of pumpkin.  Another friend suggest drizzling the Smuckers Caramel ice cream topping on top with whip cream.

A whole 18.25 oz. of cake mix was much too much. I reccomend using less. Also, it is important to note that the recipe says to drizzle butter on top, but it never notes that the entire surface needs to be covered in order for there not to be dry mix left on top. So make sure that after drizzling, you spread the butter completely over the surface or else you'll have some very chalky, dry pieces. Even though I encountered these issues, the cake tasted great. The recipe just needs a few tweeks...

Sorry but I'll have to be in the minority here and rate it low.  I made it to the T and baked for 1 hr. exactly.  There are so many eggs in this that the pumpkin part had the texture of pumpkin scrambled eggs and was a bit watery.  Not smooth and creamy at all and would NOT be a good substitute for a good pumpkin pie.  The cake topping was dry and too thick.  I say 2/3 a box would have been fine.  And this cake was tooth aching sweet.  1 cup sugar would've been plenty, especially since the cake mix is already too sweet.  1 hr. gave me a very brown cake topping, on the verge of dark brown at the corners.  I'd say reduce this to 3 eggs at most, use 2/3 of cake mix and reduce the sugar!  But for me, I will not be making this again.  Definitely had 'from the box' taste.

This is very addictive! It's the cake and butter topping I think. I used a 30 oz can of pumpkin pie filling because I didn't have all the spices so I just didn't add any spices or salt. I used a cup of sugar but probably could have used even less. I used better than butter baking sticks. I also took the advice of some reviews and didn't put the entire cake mix on top because it is sweet enough without it all. I put some fat free whip topping on the side and I tried it right out of the oven and after it's been in the fridge and I prefer it cold but still good warm.

This really is delicious. And REALLY forgiving. I made two batches: ladled one into 9x13 dish and divided the other into 7 (# of dinner guests) pot-pie pans. 30 min into cooking I realized I forgot the melted butter step! Doh! Melted and poured and put back into the oven for another 30min or so. Guests were none the wiser. I had no idea how to decide it was done... left the little ones in as long as the big one, and pulled them out when the topping was browned and the toothpick came out clean. It was delicious. I sent each person home with their own mini pie.

I am sure this dessert is the reason my fiance fell in love with me. He asks for it all the time, even for his birthday "cake" even though it's in the dead of summer. Now I've introduced it to his family. They're begging for me to bring it to this year's Thanksgiving gathering, my first time meeting the whole family. Really, this stuff is incredible. If I make any tweaks at all, it is to use the canned pumpkin pie mix with the spices already added, add a few more pecans, MAYBE reduce the butter to 3/4 cup, and usually I need to cover the dish with foil partway through baking so it doesn't burn. It DOES burn very easily, so watch for that. But it's incredible & decadent just the way it's written. Enjoy!

Really good and pretty darn easy! I tossed the pecans in 1 Tablespoon of butter and pre-toasted them in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.

I made this the other day because I thought it mimicked a recipe I have and couldn't find. When I got the first layer all mixed up I thought it seemed way too runny to press anything into it, and I couldn't picture it baking in an hour either. So, I mixed the cake mix right into the pumpkin mix. I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I used 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg. I also didn't have pecans, so I decided to add a cup of chocolate chips. It baked in the time suggested to a really moist cake with a wonderful flavor. I will definitely make this my way again, and give that 5 stars. I feel the recipe as written, however, is only a 3.

This is one of my favorite desserts!  It keeps for months in the freezer, and is especially good if you take a frozen piece of it and reheat in the microwave.

This was a great recipe!  It is very easy to make.  I did not have pumpkin pie spice on hand, so used 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and a dash of allspice and it turned out great.  I actually prefer this to pumpkin pie!

This was great. Only used 3/4c of sugar and it was plenty sweet for our taste, only half the box of cake mix and I really think anymore would have been way too much, and about 1/3c of butter instead of 1c once it was cooked the butter had spread over the surface so there weren't any dry cake mix spots that some other reviewers have noted. Thanks for a new fall treat.

This was super easy and pretty good.  I definitely liked this better cold than warm.  I will say that I made it with margarine as called for, and although it was very rich that way, I think it would be better using butter. I plan on trying it that way next time!

I remember making this recipe way back when this site was Thanksgivingrecipe.com but I never had a chance to evaluate until now. It’s an easy recipe with delicious and rich results! For the pumpkin puree, I used one whole 30 ounce can, more than 2 cups. I patted down a whole 18.25 oz. box of yellow cake mix over the top of the pumpkin mixture. I used all butter instead of margarine thou I didn’t think that there was enough to cover the pecans and cake mix.  I just loved the sweet smell of pecans, pumpkin and butter filling up my house- oh my goodness! I noticed in 55 minutes baking time that the edges were turning dark brown so I covered the entire cake with foil and let it finish baking. The cake was done in one hour and 15 minutes. I let cool it for a while before putting it in the fridge to set. I made a whipped topping, “Whipped Cream,” also from this site, and dolloped it on the cake. The pumpkin filling was very good, moist, spiced just right and tasty. The crumb topping (pecans and cake mix) had a nice crunch and was buttery and sweet. I do think that it was a bit too heavy on the butter, sugar and cake mix for my tastes. Next time I may just cut back on the amount of cake mix, butter and sugar. However, this was a huge hit with my family; and hubs and his coworkers devoured it-happily wiping it out in mere minutes. All I heard was, "Mmm..MMmm." Considering that I had to give this a 5 stars- turned out good for a “cake mix”.

Funny experience on this one: We had a couple changes - I used double the amount of pumpkin puree which made it a bit too mushy. Will try it again following the suggested amount. My husband set it on the hood of our car and it fell onto the road upside down! the cover kept it mostly intact but it didn't look too pretty when we arrived to the party. After sharing what happened with the guests (who gave it a thumbs up on taste) it is forever more renamed Pumpkin Roadkill. Lol!

This came out really great, even though I forgot to drizzle the butter until 20 min. before the cake was done. I also only used 2/3 c. butter, and also shorted the sugar. To top this, we melted half a can of cream cheese frosting and drizzled it on top of the slightly cooled cake (as one reviewer suggested -- thanks!). We also didn't use nuts because some people are picky. So, basically, you can forget stuff and short ingredients and it's still delicious!

This is the best idea if you hate soggy piecrust! The crust is on the top and stays CRUNCHY! But the recipe needed tweaked...for this size pan you need the LARGE CAN of pumpkin, and since the cake mix has sugar...use ONLY 1 CUP sugar, and NO SALT needed. And reduce eggs to 3. I also use my own pumpkin pie spice mix. Pecans are a nice touch.
I have also halved the recipe in a square pan and it comes out great.

This recipe is super easy and is a good, quick fall dessert. I am basing my star rating on whether I would serve this on Thanksgiving or not. I too think the recipe calls for too much cake mix. I found mounds of dusty cake mix after it came out of the oven. So that someone wouldnt take a bite and choke themselves, I solved the problem by melting Kraft caramel squares and drizziling on top. Overall, the cake was a hit for Sunday dinner. I would make it again for small family dinners but not for my big Thanksgiving "to impress" dessert. One last note: I felt it was best at room temp or cold.

Wonderful dessert!  I made this over the weekend when my son came home from college.  This is one of his absolute favorite desserts (and he eats very few desserts).  Everyone enjoyed this recipe - I did make 1 change.  When instructed to add the melted margarine (1 cup) to the top, I only added a 1/2 cup of butter instead.  I just drizzled it very slowly over the top and didn't worry about covering the entire top.  I made half a pan with the pecans (for us) and the other half without (for son).  It was easy to please everyone with this recipe.  Thanks Nora for sharing.

SOOO GOOD!  The only change I made was subbed the cup of margarine for 1/2 cup of butter because 1) I didn't have margarine and 2) 1 cup seemed like a little bit of overkill.  This was so rich, delicious & easy to make.  Everyone at the church function I took it to really enjoyed it.  THANK YOU for sharing!  :)

One of the best, if not the best, dessert I've ever made.  I didn't alter it in anyway.

Delicious!  I didn't change any ingredients at all.  I will definitely make this again.  The only change that I made was that I put foil on for the first 45 min. then took it off and cooked it an additional 15 min.  Thank you for sharing!

My friend made this for thanksgiving and i finally found the recipe!  SOOOO good with walnuts!  A good use for leftover pumpkin!  If you serve this when people are over they will demolish it after some coaxing.

I've made this 2 times.  The only ingredients I changed were:  I used 3 eggs, no salt & no pumpkin pie spice. Also I used chopped walnuts and butter instead of margarine. I bake it 45 minutes covered in foil then removed the foil and baked 15 minutes uncovered. Everyone loved it at a potluck that I brought it to.

This was FABULOUS!  Cut sugar to 1 1/3 cups with the 1/3 cup being Splenda and used 2 eggs and 1/2 cup egg beaters, instead of 4 eggs.  Only thing I never saw mentioned was that with 20 minutes left, I had to cover with foil as the top was getting way too brown.   Cooked it for 65 minutes.  Will definitely make again!

Easy yes, and tasty, but didn't bake as well as I hoped.  I tried this recipe twice and both times it came out too runny on the bottom.  Pumpkin on bottom needs to be more firm.

I made this mostly as written, with a few minor changes.  I used only cinnamon in place of the pumpkin pie spice.  My cake mix was butter yellow instead of regular yellow and was only 15.5 oz (but I would use a larger box next time if I have one).  In place of margarine I used unsalted butter.  Mine only took the minimum 60 minutes to bake and it was perfectly cooked.  I served at room temperature with cool whip, and I think ice cream could work well also.

This was a big hit!
This is my first time I make a desert recipe with pumpkin.
I made it for a friends gathering. Everyone was astonished with the taste and asked me for the recipe, so I had to post on our group wall on Facebook :)

I am not the best cook by any stretch of the imagination. But even I couldn't mess this up!! I absolutely loved it! Was a big hit a both my work gathering and extended family gathering. Because there was so much food at the family gathering I did have left overs, and I am so sick of pumpkin now becasue I gorged myself on the cake until it was gone. Delish!!

I've been making this for years and forgot to review it... This is the easiest and tastiest way to serve a pumpkin dessert! It's a little like pumpkin pie, a little like cake, and always gets rave reviews at Thanksgiving. It's on the sweet side, so probably not great for those that like more mellow desserts. Instead of just patting the cake mix down on top of the pumpkin mixture, I sprinkle a little of the cake mix on top, then combine it with the pumpkin mix before sprinkling the rest of the cake mix on top. This gives it a more even transition from the cake-like part to the pumpkin pie-like part. Enjoy!

Yum!  I modified the recipe a bit...used only three eggs and about 3/4 of the cake mix.  I found that it only took about one hour to bake.  For the topping, I went all out and used 8 oz of cream cheese (softened), a cup of heavy whipping cream, 1/2 c confectioners sugar and about 4 oz of Cool Whip.  Just beat the cream cheese and cream until it starts to thicken, then add the sugar and Cool Whip gradually.

I discovered this recipe a few years back. I didn't have time to make traditional pumpkin pies the first Thanksgiving after my Mom passed away.  I made this for our family dinner and felt guilty that I didn't make Mom's pies for my Dad.  To my delight my snooty Dad loved it and we have it for every Thanksgiving now.

I followed some other reviewers advice, and used unsalted butter.  I followed everything else exactly, and it was a big hit at Thanksgiving!

What a hit for Thanksgiving!!  I wasn't sure what it was going to turn out like but it was really like a pumpkin cobbler.  Much tastier than pumpkin pie.  I only used one cup of sugar and I toasted the pecans in butter before putting them on.  Cooked for exactly 60 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I am sorry, but my family and I HATED this recipe.  It was so sugary sweet that it actually made us feel sick to eat it.  Also, I was expecting something more cake like, but instead it was was like an over the top pumpkin pie.  I won't be having seconds, and I will never make this again.  I am extremely disappointed & truly don't understand why this recipe got such good reviews.

I've made this quite a few years now and it's delicious and requested by a few of my relatives.  I actually add crumb topping on top of the cake(from a crumbcake recipe I have) and call it Pumpkin Crumb Crunch Cake.

I have made variations of the "pumpkin cake" recipe for years, but this is by far THE BEST pumpkin recipe I have ever come across!  I will NEVER go back to that other version again! I wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you.

I was a little afraid to make this because I was actually looking for a "cake" and since this has no flour in it the consistency is much more like a pumpkin pie with a crumb topping.  I'm glad I did make it because it's really good!  I made a few changes as follows: used only 3 eggs, cut salt to 1/2 tsp., used only 1/2 package of cake mix, and reduced margarine to 3/4 c.   I followed directions as written with my measurements and after baking 77 minutes it was golden brown and pretty well set.  I served it warm with cool whip that evening and then chilled it for the next day.  It was really good both ways.  It would be an excellent pot luck dessert and is a nice alternative to pumpkin pie.

This is very good. I did make a few changes like some of the other people suggested.  I only added half of the cake mix on top, and added one tsp. of nutmeg and cinnamon.( I didn't have the pumpkin pie spice)   I did add a dash of vanilla too.  I toasted the pecans, and used one stick of melted butter.  I made it for a pumpkin baking contest and won 1st prize! It was very moist and really yummy.

I also cut the topping in half, and next time I will try cutting the butter into the cake mix to get more of a crumble topping.  This is like a pumpkin pie with a crunchy top.  It was much better the second day and after - so make it ahead!

I made this for Christmas.  Don't make the mistake I did.  I prepped this the night before to save time Christmas day but this kind of cake is best made and baked the same day.  It was extremely moist (mushy) and the taste was great!  Next time I will prepare it and bake it the same day.  Good recipe.

This is an amazing cake. I did make minimal changes, used a spice cake instead of yellow, salted butter instead of margarine and used roasted and salted pecans. Everyone that has tasted it has asked for the recipe. Even people who say they don't like anything pumpkin. We don't top this with whip cream as it just doesn't need it. This will be a staple desert in my house.

My family LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe, but when I made it the last time, I screwed up at the end and I couldn't believe that it tasted even better.  I forgot to add the pumpkin pie spice to the pumpkin!  So I ended up stirring it into the butter and pouring it on top.  I also had only 3 eggs, so I figured, oh well, it'll either taste good or it won't.  It was AMAZING.  Everyone at the Thanksgiving table wanted the recipe.  We totally served it warm with vanilla ice cream.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and have made it for years.  I have made a short cut. I use Pumpkin Pie Mix and just add the wet ingredients: eggs, evaporated milk, instead then follow rest of recipe.  Turns out great, I carry copy of recipe every time I share it !!!

Made this the day before and was worried how it would taste cold - it wasn't the prettiest creation ever, either - but it was out of this world yummy!  Very popular and most of the family went back for seconds.  Made as directed, but would like to try the 1/2 brown sugar as recommended by other reviewers. Served with Cool Whip.  I think other cake mixes like Butter Pecan, Spice and maybe even Carrot would be equally good.

I used a large can of the pumpkin pie mix (all you have to do is add 2 eggs & a small can of evaporated milk).  I did not want it to sweet so only put on 1/2 of yellow cake mix and 1/2 cup of melted butter.  It was perfect!  My 95 year old mother could not stop eating it.

This is a very odd cake. The flavor was great but the consistency was a little off and out of 6 people I was the only who really liked it. I would test it out on friends and family before actually doing it as a Thanksgiving dessert like I did.

I thought this was easy to make and pretty good.  I didn't have pumpkin so I used sweet potatoes which were a good substitute.  My husband loved this a lot more than I did.  I give this four stars because I enjoy the classic pumpkin pie better, but the topping on this  dessert is nice for a twist on old classic.  I am not sure that I like it enough to make it again this year.

It is a decadent, over the top, dessert with little time or effort.  It takes more time to assemble the ingredients than it does to make this truly scrumptious cake.  It is simple in appearance but mouth-watering in taste. I was one of those people who had to go into work today after hosting a Thanksgiving dinner of 20 + people.  My reward - a piece of this cake for breakfast. Nora, this is truly a keeper.  Thank you so much!

Awesome recipe! To make it just a little different instead of pumpkin pie spice mix I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of 5 spice mix the aroma is heaven! I also used pumpkin seeds for the nuts. I hadn't even finished plating pieces for a luncheon and guests were taking the cake first!

Made this recipe just as it is written. Was a big hit with everyone. I was testing it out before Thanksgiving to be sure we liked it before we served it to everyone. Needless to say, I will be making one to take with us on Thanksgiving.

This is my new favorite pumpkin recipe.  Perfect just as written.  Mine took 60 minutes to bake.  Thanks for sharing!

It was easy to make and pretty good taste but not for everyone. I loved the bottom part but the top part was a little much. Probably wouldn't make again with so many other pumpkin recipes out there

This cake was a challenge for me because I am new to baking but the results were good. I pretty much followed the recipe except that I forgot to drizzle the melted butter. I did this at the end and baked it for an extra 5 minutes or so. The texture was a little funky for a cake but all the flavor was there. I will bake this cake again with a few minor changes but all in all a very good recipe.

There are a number of variations of this recipe on this website.  This one is FIVE stars!!  So easy to whip up.  I made this for Hubs to take to his fishing club and share with the guys and one of them even asked for the recipe!  The only negative I found with this recipe is the baking time.  I’d say 45-50 minutes max!  I baked mine for about 55 minutes, which was too long and the edges of the cake were a bit hard.  Regardless the fishing guys polished off the whole thing!

I thought this was pretty good, except my pecans got really brown and I only cooked for about 55 minutes.  Maybe it tastes better cold, not sure because mine is still warm from the oven.  I think it has potential to be better, but as is, I'm having a hard time getting past the burnt nut topping :(  If I made again, I think I'd add them about 20 minutes before taking it from the oven, maybe that would help?

We thought this was a great change from pumpkin pie.  Things I changed because of other reviews was substituting 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg for the spice.  The cake is twice as good the next day after being chilled in the refrigerator.  Make sure the cake is completely cooled before topping it with the CoolWhip.

Sooo very good. This is by far better than Pumpkin Pie. I also used only 1/2 C. butter.  Used salted butter and omitted salt in the recipe.  Also added a bit of nutmeg and a handful toffee chips along with the pecans Perfect every time.

The pumpkin pie part tasted great. My pecans burnt, but the pie would have been mushy if I didn't let it cook longer. I might try to experiment putting the pecans below and between the layer of cake. w/o pecans, this recipe works just as well. And it is very delicious.

Very easy and tasty. The topping is a little sweet and I am a big sweet eater, I will probably try using less of the cake mix on top. It is better chilled and even tastier on day 2.

Made this for my girl friends and they flipped over it.  Everyone wanted this recipe.  My husband really liked it too.  When pressing down the cake batter, make sure to really press hard into the bottom mixture.  I found that this way helped tone down some of the crunchiness.  Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe, however, I also made a couple of adjustments. Instead of using the puree and spice, I used 2 cups of the pumpkin pie mix which already has all the spices in it.

I love pumpkin, but I was not thrilled with this cake.  I cut back the sugar to 1 cup but it was still overly sweet.  It was easy to put together but the taste was just OK.

This was a pretty good recipe, but I tweaked it a bit.  As suggested by another reviewer, I used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree.  I used 3 eggs, 1/4 cup of evap milk, and omitted the sugar.  As I was using a spring form pan, I felt this would need a crust of some sort, so I mixed the box of cake mix with 1/3 cup melted butter.  I then used half this mixture to create a crust, which I baked blind at 350F for about 10 minutes, until it began to brown.  I then added the pumpkin mixture, and over this the remaining cake/butter mixture.  I left the pecans out until the last 20 minutes of baking to prevent them from burning.  I baked the cake for 80 minutes at 350.  Note:  if you use a spring form pan, with the bottom crust as I did, I suggest placing a foil lined baking sheet underneath it during baking.  Some melted butter melted out of the seam of my pan, and could have been a messy cleanup if I didn't have the baking sheet there.  The finished cake was served with vanilla ice cream.  I will be making this again.  Good recipe!

I love this dump cake!  I've been making it since I was 18.  Instead of using pumpkin puree and pumpkin spices separately, I use the canned pumpkin pie mix.  It's a nice change to pumpkin pie, everyone expects this for Thanksgiving!

Not sure what I did wrong. I was unsure of the 'sprinkle cake mix and pat  down'. I wish I would have mixed the cake mix in thoroughly as the cake came out soggy on the bottom. I only used 1/2 cup margarine too, I can't imagine what 1 cup would have tasted like. I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe is amazing!  I did top it with a spiced glaze: melted butter, powdered sugar, milk, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon.  Sooo yummy!  We ate it when it was still slightly warm.   Will definitely make again!

This was wonderful!!  I made it for a Bible study and everyone that tried it liked it.   Some even said that it is better than pumpkin pie.   It's good leftover, cold and hot.  The only thing I did differently was I only used half the butter it called for.  It still turned out great!

WOW! I tried this recipe because I was looking for something easy and tasty and this was it!  This was so easy and very adaptable.  I didn't have a large can of the milk so I used 2 small cans and it turned out great.  I doubled the nuts like others had suggested and cut back on the butter.  Instead of melting the butter and pouring it on the cake, I just sliced a half of a stick of butter in thin slices and then let it melt in the oven.  This turned out really well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!  Just made this recipe for my Book Club, and EVERYONE loved it!  Many requests for the recipe.  My husband, who is not a fan of pumpkin pie, raved about it and requested I make it for Thanksgiving.  So I am doing so in a few weeks!
*quick tip - don't forget to add the whipped cream on top.  Tastes much better with it!

YUM!  I served this tonight to my Bible study group and everyone devoured it and even the guys wanted the recipe!  I accidentally bake it 30 minutes too long and it still turned out great.  A definite keeper for my fall recipe collection.

Made this for Thanksgiving ( naturally ) I thought it was pretty good. I was scared when I read to sprinkle the dry cake mix over the top. I couldn't imagine how this could turn out right but I was wrong. The pumpkin soaked into it and came out fine.  If you're looking for a dessert made with pumpkin and are sick of pie, check this one out.

I have a different recipe that uses 1 can of pumpkin (instead of puree) and adds 4 eggs along with thinly slicing the butter over pecans instead of melting it. Turned out wonderful!! Good alternative to pumpkin pie.

Absolutely Superb! It's a hit at every gathering.  I like to add my personal recipe for whipped vanilla cream cheese frosting for the topping and then sprinkle a dash of cinnamon!  Also very easy to make this recipe ahead of time and then frost the day of the event!  Once again DELICIOUS!  Thanks Nora you are a Fabulous Baker!

I don't normally like dishes/recipes with pumpkin in it, but I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving (so I wouldn't have to eat Mom's pumpkin pie - but don't tell her!) and it was VERY delicious!  Even my boyfriend liked it and he's the pickiest eater I know!

I have made this recipe many times over the last four years. and  I always get asked for the recipe . The only changes I made were  3 eggs instead of 4  and 1 TBSP of pumpkin pie spice.  Always use butter and I cut that to 3/4 stick.  I have made this using white, yellow  and spice cake mixes.  When placed next to a pumpkin pie  this will go first

I followed the recipe exactly but felt I should make some slight modifications in the future, however the recipe itself was a 5 star in my house. As suggested in the recipe you pat down the cake mixture into the pumpkin mixture which is very literal; rather than scattering it over the top and lightly pressing it in I would suggest firmly pressing it so that the pumpkin mixture actually starts to come thru a little, then I would add the melted butter and nuts. The cook time for me was about 1 hour and 20 minutes but I think had I made the slight changes it would have finished in one hour. Will certainly be making this again!

Great recipe. As per other reviews I reduced the number of eggs to 3, made my own pumpkin spice mix with cinnamon, ginger, fresh nutmeg and cloves and used a large 30 oz. can of pumpkin.  

I also toasted the pecans before I combined them with the cake mix and butter and added some light brown sugar. Next time I may even reduce the amount of butter. Too much makes it more like batter and not a crumble topping.  
Top the cool whip with salted Carmel sauce, serve the cake cold (holds together better) and you have a keeper for sure!!

This is our favorite dessert not only for Thanksgiving, but "just beacuase it's fall!" My husband has me make this for his birthday cake every November. It is so easy to make and it gives just a little extra to a plain, old pumpkin pie. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

I've been making this recipe for years and LOVE it.  This is a great alternative to pumpkin pie.  After reading these reviews, I will try using butter instead of margrine and less salt.  Otherwise, it's great as written.

This was so addictive. I had this at a Baby Shower today and everyone, and I mean everyone, was raving about it. The sweet (but not too sweet) and salty crunch is a great combo. I will be adding this to my Thanksgiving dessert table for sure.

I tried this recipe and while it is good, I felt there were way too many pecans on top.  It tasted a bit salty and like something was missing.  My husband suggested a cream cheese frosting instead of whipped cream. It made a world of difference! Next time - less pecans and add the cream cheese frosting! (made with 8oz cream cheese 1/4 c butter - tsp vanilla - mix together till soft and blended - add 1/2c to 1 cup (to taste) confectioner's sugar.

This is very good!  I used a large can of pumpkin because that's what i had.  I also used real butter.  It was perfect.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  Some small changes I made are to use pecan cake mix instead of yellow, and I added a gingersnap crust on the bottom to make it easier to hold and eat.  Additionally, I added butterscotch chips on top with the pecans!  Yum!

YUMMY!!!! I was afraid it "didn't look right" when I put it in the oven but it was fantastic when it came out. I love this because it tastes like pumpkin pie but without the crust, which I don't like.

This cake is soooo yummy!  I have been making it for 20 years now.  The only thing I do different is that after the baking time of 1 hr, I turn the oven off and leave the cake in there for another hr.  The top gets really crunchy that way.  HEAVENLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

O my Goodness... this cake was amazing!!!! It's pretty much just a jazzed up pumpkin pie.  I took it to a friends house for dinner and impressed everyone.  It was very simple to put together... they only thing I did differently was use unsalted butter.  Perfect dessert for a cold fall evening.

This recipe is awesome! The only thing I changed was I used sweetened condensed milk and didn't use as much sugar b/c I didn't have evaporated milk on hand. This was so yummy I had a hard time not eating it all. I can't wait to bring it to my next holiday party. Thank you!!!

Great recipe!  I made it pretty much as written except I used walnuts instead of pecans and I made my own pumpkin spice mix instead of buying a jar from the grocery store.  I served for friends and family and it was a huge hit.  I even overcooked it so the top was slightly burned.  So I had to scrape that off, but still, no complaints here!  Next time I'll cook it for 1:10 instead of 1:20.

This is wonderful.  I didn't have any pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.  I let it sit for a couple of hours but it still fell apart when I tried to serve it, we all still at it though!!  But once I put it in the fridge it set up just like pumpkin pie texture.  I will definately be making this more often.  Just beware, this is very addictive.  Make it when there are a bunch of people to help you eat it.  :)

Very simple recipe that gets rave reviews from everyone I have served it to!  I am asked for the recipe every time.  It may seem like the 1c melted butter is a lot - but it makes it taste sinfully good! Thank you for the great recipe.

Considering I'm not much of a baker, this was very well received at Thanksgiving dinner!  So easy to make, too.  Next time, I would not use the entire box of yellow cake mix (maybe 3/4rds).  Mine only took 60 minutes in the oven - - any longer and make sure that your pecans do not burn. What a nice change from the same old pumpkin pie.

Fabulous and easy!  I used fresh pumpkin puree...used another reviewer's (VickiW) recipe for spices and it was so good!  Warm or cold, this was eaten so quickly!  If you want something different from the traditional pumpkin pie, try this!

This is absolutely wonderful! I don't really care for pumpkin pie, but this dessert is fabulous! I make it exactly as the recipe says, except I'm not a big nut person so I leave out the nuts. Everywhere I take this everyone loves it and asks for the recipe!

Super easy to do and I like the fact that you can make this any time of year because the ingredients are canned or boxed.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and it turned out delicious!

This is the best pie/cake!  I have made this 3 times and will be making it again for Thanksgiving.  Everyone that has tried it just loves it.  Two of the times I used walnuts instead of pecans and I think the walnuts taste better.  The pecans make it too salty.  Yummy, Yummy!

I didn't change a thing on this recipe and it was absolutely delicious.  The nuts didn't really need toasting in advance as they seemed to toast quite well in the oven as the cake cooked.

This "cake"/pie, is delicious! More like a pumpkin crunch souffle would be the better description of this dish. Travels well, and delicious served with whipped cream, either hot or cold!

This "cake"/pie, is delicious! More like a pumpkin crunch souffle would be the better description of this dish. Travels well, and delicious served with whipped cream, either hot or cold!

Not bad, easy to make - not something you want to make if you are trying to impress people.  Just your average run- of-the-mill dump cake.

I was looking for something to take to my son's preschool Thanksgiving potluck.  I was hoping this would be the ticket since there were quite a few positive reviews.  However, I found it was actually quite tasteless and mushy.  I was disappointed and felt it was a waste of money.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! When I seen this recipe, It just sounded good and I've never really been big on pumpkin pie but, I knew most of my family members loved pumpkin pie so, I just decided to try it and take it to thanksgiving dinner and everybody loved it! Including myself! It just has that taste that keeps you coming back for more!

This looked delicious but unfortunately mine didn’t really look like the pictures. After mixing the ingredients, it says to “spread” in the baking dish. My mixture was super runny so I poured it into the dish. Only one reviewer mentioned this and used 2 cans of pumpkin, but I didn’t have an extra can so just went with what I had. The end result was cake-y with pecans mixed in, not the layered effect I was expecting. It tasted very good and I liked it much more than pumpkin pie. Husband said he loved it. I will probably try it again with 2 cans of pumpkin next season.

 The only thing I did differently was make a cream cheese frosting. Then I sprinkled with both crushed and whole nuts.  Yummmmy!

I’ve been making a version of this for a while now ... I always line the pan with parchment and after it cools invert it so the top becomes the bottom.  This makes for a deliciously crunchy crust to the bite.

this was very very good and a nice switch up from making crust for pies.  I used butter.  I had a butter pecan mix, and used walnuts in place of the pecans.  It set up beautifully overnight and was easily able to cut it into bars.  60 minutes was perfect in my oven.  No fuss dessert with great results.  thanks for this nice recipe with lots of versatility.

Making again for two Thanksgiving Celebrations...so maybe I’ll actually get to taste it!

One of my go-to Fall desserts.  I follow the recipe but substitute spice or butter pecan cake mix.  It gives it a bit more Fall flavor.

This was so yummy, I had to change this to a gluten free recipe because I have a severe allergy to gluten. Baking is always a challenge when baking GF. I followed the recipe ingredients except I added 1/4 cup more pumpkin and 1 cup brown sugar. I used butter and a gluten free yellow cake mix. It was really good. Even my company who are not GF loved it. Thank you!

I made this with no changes, and I served it with Cool Whip.  I took it to my Men's Circle, and everyone RAVED about it!!!
I found it to be fairly light, and very tasty.  I had my first serving while it was still warm and it was good, but I liked it much better the next day when it was fully cooled.  I'll definitely be making this again - in fact the guys already asked me to!!!

Love this cake.  easy to adapt to make sugar free.  Replace the Sugar with stevia in the raw (one for one substitution) and use a sugar free cake mix.

This is delicious!  My only suggestions:  don't use margarine, use unsalted butter.  Emphasis on the UNsalted.  I accidentally used salted one time and it wasn't good.  Also, mine came out best on the lower side of the cook time.  My oven cooks it to ultimate deliciousness at about 65 minutes.  All ovens are different, but definitely start checking at 60 minutes.  The crunch topping is SO GOOD, my family gives it rave reviews!!

Had it for Thxgiving.  Very easy.  The nuts got a little over brown even at 60 min. bake time.  Next time I'll cover with foil to try and prevent that.  Other than that, made exactly as recipe specified.

MUST use margarine (not butter ) & NOT over-cook for top to be right. It is also best to cut into servings while still warm.  I also decreased the sugar in half.  With the cake mix on top, it only needs at the most 1 cup.  (This is pumpkin pie recipe with double eggs and sugar.)  I have made this recipe multiple times and made the top too tough by using butter instead of margarine. Even our biggest sweet-tooth says it is too sweet at the amount of sugar in recipe.  It really needs the topping or whip cream  to complete.

It was very tasty but didn't hold together. 'Cake' is a stretch: 'bar' maybe.  Kind of over-the-top-sweet for us - I would dial down the sugar considerably  and possibly eliminate an egg.  I skipped the whipped cream like substance too.

Easy to make cake, I was out of pumpkin pie spice.  BI used cinnamon instead.  I also screwed up will making the cake.  I added the butter with the pumpkin, milk etc.  
It turned out great!  My hubby said I could make that kind of screw up any time.  It is a very rich cake.  Cool whip tops it off nicely.

Made this for a function at our church. I can honestly it was a success. Will definitely be making this again. I did sauté the chopped pecans in butter that someone suggested and for  my topping instead of cool whip I used the suggestion of another reviewer: container of cool whip, 8oz cream cheese softened and 1/2 cup powdered sugar mixed well. It’s a keeper in our family.

I made this exactly by  this recipe for my mother's October birthday.  She is 74 and states it is the best cake she has ever had -- and she is a 5 star baker.  An absolutely delicious recipe for the pumpkin-pecan lover.

Delicious. I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c lt brown. Next time I will add another can of pumpkin and unsalted butter. It is wonderful the way it is but I think it will be even more wonderful with these changes. Serve with a dollup of Cool Whip, cream cheese, powdered sugar topping.

Made as directed, but halved the ingredients to make a smaller pan. Husband likes everything pumpkin, but the rest of us thought it was nothing special. Probably won’t make it again.

So far, I'm only giving this cake a 3 because I thought I had a can of pumpkin but when I went to make it, I couldn't find it so I went to my local corner grocery and all they had was the pumpkin pie filling (already spiced) which a reviewer said worked out well.   It didn't in my case.  There was no flavor to the pumpkin at all.  I was sorely disappointed as I love the cinnamon, cloves, etc., taste and this had none.  The topping was good.  So I am going to remake it one of these days, using regular canned pumpkin but I will add my own spices.  If it works like I hope it does, I will update my review.

I was craving this pumpkin crunch and got right to it... and then I didn’t have evaporated milk and only had 3 eggs... ugh. I did a quick google search and found an article that said I could use coconut milk instead. So that’s what I did. Chaokoh canned coconut milk and the only 3 eggs I had. I like pumpkin spice so I used 1 tablespoon. I also used butter, not margarine.

This is an awesome dessert, which I was introduced to this month at our card club.  I made it for my son and I two days later and he loved it!  I used 3 egss and the equivalent of 4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  This recipe is so easy and tastes so good with Cool Whip.  I imagine that it would be extraordinary with vanilla ice cream!  My new favorite dessert.

Giving it a 3 for now... I accidentally put the butter in the pumpkin mix  ARRRGH, so I melted a little more, to drizzle on top, I'll let you know if it passes or if it fails!!!  hopefully I'm not the only hurried chef to ever do this!!! Too much butter never hurt anything did it?? I'll re-rate after it bakes   I need to tell you This is a 5 star recipe, I made it before without the goof up and reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, I DO NOT like pumpkin pie and this stuff is amazing...  Just hoping it turns out ok with my goof up!!!

Used three eggs and 2/3 large can of pumpkin purée. Fresh ginger about 1tsp - had to make my own pp spice. Used spice cake mix and walnuts in pre made pie shells. Smells good. Have salted Carmel for a drizzle. Fingers crossed.

Making another one for a friendsgiving party tomorrow! Too good not to enjoy again!  This will become a tradition going Forward!

I decreased sugar to 1 cup and used 1 stick of butter instead of the cup of margarine. It was very good but still too sweet.  Next time I will cut sugar to 1/2 cup.

I only made one change- I used butter instead of margarine. I have made a cake similar to this in the past. The addition of the pecans really kicks this recipe up a notch! We loved it and will make it again!

I think it is VERY important that this dessert be refrigerated for several hours (or overnight) before serving.  I was disappointed when I served it last night... mostly because the pumpkin was room temp! I sampled the leftovers this morning, and it was MUCH better!! Maybe I should have known to refrigerate  it before serving, but it always try to follow directions the first time, and then make changes as I want. In this case, I loved it after refrigeration over night.

Moist and delicious! I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to reduce the sweetness a bit and I used spice cake mix and walnuts since it's what I had on hand. My co workers loved it.

Everyone loves this dessert! And it's even better next day with vanilla ice cream on top. Only change I make is I only use half a cake mix since we all found the original recipe too sweet. Much better that way. Yummy pumpkin flavor really comes through.

It is very good a little salty & the top burnt some before it was done baking so may need to cover with foil when close to being done, otherwise very good.

I cooked it longer than stated because one reviewer said the crust was mushy the next day. It was great last night but the top was way too soft this morning.  I will read more reviews to see if anyone has suggestions. And as a personal note, I love that people post their changes with the reviews. I'm looking for ideas not just a score on the original recipe.

This is one of my son's favorite desserts.  It is so easy to put together and tastes wonderful.  I make half the pan with the pecans and the other half without the pecans.  I keep cans of pumpkin on-hand to make this treat throughout the year.

Made the cake yesterday delicious. Took the cake to work and was devoured.  Will make again. The only thing I omitted I didn't have any pecans.

EXTREMELY sweet and rich. Much too sweet in my opinion. I don't think it needs the full amount of sugar or butter. If you drizzle a full cup of butter or margarine on top the entire pan has a layer of butter over it.

This is delicious!!! I did stir the cake mix into the pumpkin mixture a bit to moisten it up, then poured the melted butter on top. Will be making this again!

I made this  for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit!  The only changes I made  based on other reviews, were to use 1/2C white sugar and 1/2C brown sugar in place of the 1 1/2C white sugar the recipe called for. I also used a sugar-free yellow cake mix. I patted the cake mix down until the pumpkin mixture ALMOST started to peak through. I sprinkled pecan pieces over that and then covered the whole thing with the melted butter. The trick is to make sure the cake mix is patted down really well and the whole thing is covered completely with the melted butter. I covered with foil for 55 minutes, then removed the foil and baked for another 15 minutes, checking for doneness every five minutes or so. 

My husband and I are both bariatric patients so I am always looking for recipes that I can make with lower sugar. This one is a keeper!

I love the flavor of pumpkin but this was way to sweet for my liking. Too much sugar and butter. Made one half with pecans and one half without and most liked it better without. Would try a different recipe next time.

This is yummy!  I used two cans of pumpkin, 1 & 1/2 cups of sugar  and a little maple syrup.  I left out the nuts because some in my family don't like them.

This was easy and was good but I've had better.  It could have used more pumpkin pie spice.  I may try it again to see if I did something wrong and add more spice.

I made this instead of the usual pumpkin pie & I'm glad I did.  It was great! To make it lower in calories, I used ff evap. milk, Splenda, & lite Cool Whip & it still came out very good.  This makes way more than 6 servings so, since I'm the only one in my family that likes pumpkin, next time I will half the recipe.

this cake is amazing. the crunch is great and the flavor of the cake makes it taste like a pumpkin upside down cake mixed with a pecan pie. I only gave it 4 stars because if you want more of a pumpkin pie consistency you will want to refrigerate it for a couple hours. all in all great cake i just think it tastes so much better cold.

A co-worker brought this to work and it was absolutely delicious.  I only ate 4 pieces as I wanted to give others a chance to taste it.  She says she covers with foil about half way through so as not to over-brown the pecan topping.  Yummy!

Awesome!!  Moist, crunchy, seasoned perfectly! Wonder how a carrot or a spice cake mix would taste.  I may try that next. Also wonder how it would turn out as cupcakes.  Oh my, I have a lot of baking to do!!!

I have made this recipe several times and it is wonderful!  I have never been a huge fan of pumpkin pie but love this version.  Perfect for family holiday get-togethers or pot-luck dinners!

This is very tasty - even better cold the next day with REAL whip cream, too!
I used a smaller pan (11x8) and it was way too thick on the crust.  One stick of butter was definitely enough.  It did seem salty though, and the crust was very thick.  I think I'd work with this to get it right.  It's worth it!

This is the best new dessert recipe I've found in many years. It must be served warm to be appreciated, with a whipped topping. The blend of pecans and pumpkin is decadent.
Servings says 6, however I think 15 is a lot closer to the truth. This would change the calorie content to around 400.

This is my family's all time favorite! Use only real butter not margerine. Also skip the cool whip--only real whip cream adds class to this delight!

Oh soooo good!!!!!  Followed recipe exactly except used walnuts instead of pecans.  My husband hates pumpkin but devoured this cake.  Served with whip cream and sprinkled a little cinnamon on top. Yum!!!

This was very very good!  I even lost my internet connection and ended up making it incorrectly and it STILL came out wonderful! (I put the melted margerine in with the pumpkin filling instead of drizzling it on top) The result was very much like a pumpkin cobbler.  I don't recommend doing it the way I did, as I think the top of it will come out much more crunchy with the margerine drizzled. A very nice pumpkin pie taste in a non-traditional presentation.  This is a must try for the holidays.

This was really good. It kind of reminded me of bread pudding. I used pecan halves instead of chopped pecans because I thought it looked better. Also, I didn't use the whipped topping because I liked it so much on it's own. I'll definitely be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe. I've made it 3 times since finding it. I gave it 5 stars, but I think in the future I will cut down on the sugar somehow. It's VERY sweet.

Excellent recipe.  I'd never made anything with 'fresh pumpkin'.  Preparation of the pumpkin was simple.  I don't like pumpkin, but truly enjoyed this cake.  It is delicious warm!  It's very easy & very rich!

Very Very good, but VERY rich!!! If you are ever in the mood for something sweet for breakfast this will hit the spot. My husband took it to his work and everyone enjoyed it.  I made mine in a stoneware dish, so the bottom was a bit harder than probably normal. If you use stoneware I would suggest decreasing the temp or the time cooked.

Incredible!  Wow... I was skeptical about sprinkling the dry cake mix on top, it just didn't seem right- but it turned out fabulous! I also used my own roasted pumpkin puree.  We will be making this EVERY halloween.

Yummy dessert but definitely better refrigerated!  I also found the topping a bit salty and greasy so I would probably cut back on the butter to 3/4c next time.  I also used a 29oz. can of pumpkin to make the pumpkin part thicker.  I left everything else the same and it turned out great! Would certainly make this again!

Very easy and a HUGE hit at work. I get up early and make it in the morming so it is still warm when I get there. Serve it will real whipped cream-it cuts the sweetness.

This cake was very tasty! It honestly was a bit too rich for my personal taste- but everyone else seemed to really enjoy it- I have made it twice now! I added a graham cracker crust to mine and it was perfect- 
Thanks so much!

Easy and delicious!
I think that maybe the topping was a tad too thick. Next time I will reduce the cake mix to 1/2 or 3/4. So as not to waste the cake mix I may pour a can of cherry pie filling in an 8x8 and use the remaining cake mix on that. I bet it is yummy :)

This is such a great recipe.  My father is a great cook, so I've been practicing some in hopes of following in his footsteps.  This is my second time baking something, and it is absolutely fantastic.  The difference in textures is amazing, and the flavor is simply wonderful.  My father was the first to try it, and he was really surprised.  If I can make this, anyone can, and it is really, really good.

I had a party the other night and wanted to fix some "fall recipes".  Tried this one, seemed so easy, and let me tell you, it's EASY!!!!  FAST too!  Everyone loved it, and it was gone in no time.  Several recipe requests, it was a huge hit!  Try it!  Even if you don't care for pumpkin, this will change your mind!

This was sooooo good. I only changed the walnuts to pecans because thats what I prefer. It was sooo easy and had "no dessert" people asking for seconds!
