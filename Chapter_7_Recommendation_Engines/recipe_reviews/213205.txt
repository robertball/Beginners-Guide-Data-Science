Fantastic!  I cut the peppers in half lengthwise, roasted for about 20 min. before stuffing then cooked at recommended temp for about 20-25 min.  Flavor is amazing---best stuffed jalapenos I've ever made!

These were SUPER!  We cooked them on our new primo grill. It really helped to have the jalapeno stand to keep them standing upright as pictured in my photo. Thanks Lance-- I will be making these again soon!

These were great, although I will be making some changes the next time I make them. I was surprised at how crunchy the jalapenos were--not necessarily a bad thing, but I think next time I will cook them for longer or precook the jalapenos. The filling seemed a little thick and I couldn't taste the pineapple as much as I was hoping to, so next time I will add more than 1/2 a cup.   We used small jalapenos and ended up making a T-cut along the side (where the top of the T is at the base of the stem) because we didn't think we could get all the seeds out just by slicing off the top. I think it worked well--we could hold the jalapenos by the stem to eat them.

This recipe was a little bit time consuming but well worth it. Instead of adding bacon bits to the cheese mixture I wrapped a lean piece of bacon around the top half of the pepper and secured it with a toothpick. I used my fingers to stuff the peppers, using a spoon would have taken even longer. To bake them I put a double layer of foil across the deep pan and poked small holes in the foil then pushed the pepper through just to where the bacon was. The tooth pick helped to keep the pepper upright.  They were a big hit on "Game Night"

Wow, how to review these weird but wonderful appetizers!? The taste was great. I pretty much followed the recipe, but added a bit of chili powder. The wow factor was good too, with my guests lovong the little treats and asking for the recipe.  That's the wonderful part. The weird part was the time it took, and my own failure to use the inverted aluminum cooking pan set up properly, I guess. It takes a very long time to core out each individual pepper, and get them stuffed. Then I put them in the inverted pan, with little x-shaped holes cut out so they could stand up. Looked great. Unfortunately, as they cook, they soften and shrink (duh) and 6-8 of them slid right off onto the bottom of the oven, which caused a nice amount of smoke, as you can imagine.   Definitely make sure they are very snug in their little holes, and I would put the inverted aluminum holder on top of a cookie sheet if I ever make them again. They were definitely more work then I expected, but the taste and wow factor were great.

We made these last night and everyone loved them. The only thing we did different was to exclude the pineapple & add about a TSP of chipotle chili pepper seasoning to the mix. Very good & we wil be making these again...I did make a little extra and it's very good with crackers!!!

I made this for my husband's 40th birthday party. 4 dozen of these puppies came out of the oven and were gone within minutes. Everyone loved them and they all wanted the recipe. This will be a regular in our house.

AWESOME! some were spicy, some were not. We cut the peppers in half lengthwise and stuffed 18 of them (36 halves)  with the same amount of cheese. Delicious and nutritious. I will definitely make these again! a big hit with non-spic likers too.

This was a nice change from my regular stuffed jalapenos. jalapenos made a double batch but I split them in half and laid a 1/3 of a slice of bacon on each one. I also added red pepper to the cream cheese mix in case my jalapenos weren't hot. I used the whole can of pineapple. My uncle who hates pineapple loved them. It just gives it a sweet taste doesn't really taste like pineapple. Next time I will use more gouda bc I couldn't really taste it. Everyone loved them. Definitely a keeper!

I used bacos instead of bacon (to make them vegetarian) and sharp cheddar instead of gouda and it was great.

I cut the tops off the jalape√±os and halved them. I roasted them for 20 minutes while making the filling. For the filling, I left out the bacon and used fat free cream cheese. I also added some pickled diced jalapeno for a little extra kick to the sweetness. After the peppers roasted for 20 minutes, I filled them and baked them for another 20 minutes. These were delicious. Takes time but a great appetizer!

I first made these last summer.  They have become a staple at the lake, my dad liked them so much he bought 2 jalapeno racks for the grill.  Sometimes I leave out the bacon.

These were great.  The flavor was perfect and they were a hit at the birthday party. My only suggestion would be that if you want heat you need to add it back in or leave some seeds/membrane.
