These bars are fabulous! Moist, peanut buttery, with a hint of chocolate and delicious!! The icing is perfect as well. Be sure not to overmix the dough becuase your bars will fall when you take them out of the oven.

Excellent.  I did add chocolate chips in the batter and more (1 1/2 cup total) quick cooking oats as I remember them being more "oaty" from my childhood.  Came out very yummy!!!

These are super delicious and gooey.  I'm embarassed about how much I've already eaten!  I didn't have a whole cup of choc. chips so I added some toffee chips to the recipe.  It's worth every calorie.  Pour yourself a big glass of milk to go along with it!

I thought these were delicious. Everyone liked them. I followed the recipe as is, just baked them in a 9x9 pan for about 10 extra minutes. Very good. Will definately make again!

Everyone really enjoyed these bars the few times I've made them.   I chose to use butterscotch chips instead and that was a big hit!   I made extra icing because the family loves icing of any kind.   I put it in a zip loc bag and cut the corner off and used that

While these are quick to make (4*), they're WAY way sweet (3*).  I did choose to make in my cool little brownie pan thing, so a) they were thicker than would normally be and b) smaller quantity - so maybe my rating isn't fair, but I tried (sorry). Mine turned out nice and moist on the bottom, but there is a crumbly tenture there as well (weird) similar to what other AR members noted.  I probably won't make for DH & myself, but grandids may absolutely love, so we'll see.  Definately serve with a large glass of milk.  Thanks so much for recipe.

I have made these 3 or 4 times and can't keep them in the house. I made a booboo and misread the recipe and added choc chips and pb chips to the batter, turned out great. I didn't use the icing, I just melted some pb chips and semi sweet chips and tbsp of crisco and drizzled it over the top, yummy

These have great flavor but they are kind of dry and crumbly.  I didn't read any reviews ahead of time so maybe someone has a suggestion for making them more moist???  I also left off the glaze.  I only had reduced fat peanut butter and it wouldn't incorporate right with the confectioner's sugar and milk.  I will make them again but with some tweaks.

Very good!  A tad dry textured, but the peanut butter icing makes up for it.  The taste is addicting, however.

Meh. These were like mediocre peanut butter cookies with chocolate chips on top. Granted, I left out the icing, but I am not convinced that that would have taken this over the top for me. Next time I will just make a regular pb cookie.

These were good but not great.  I am never a person to pass up a chocolate and PB combo but these just weren't as appealing.  I will have to look for a different staple recipe.

Really good without icing.  I didn't think there was enough batter for 9x13 but they turned out great.  They did need a few minutes more cooking time since mine came out gooey in the middle.

Great bar. I did not have any issue with the bar being crumbly and I was even a bit short on the butter. Followed recipe, but did not frost. Didn't need it. I did not have chocolate chips so I chopped up some Riesen candies ( chocolate covered caramels) and pushed the caramel bits into the batter slightly. That put is over the top! They do get even better the next day.

I doubled the recipe and uses a Pampered Chef large bar stone to bake. My husband and the neighbors loved them! The only thing I did different was to double the peanut butter in the icing, as written I thought it tasted too much like confectioner's sugar.

This is one of my "go to" recipes.  Everyone loves them.  Definitely make the icing; it is not a step to skip.  I have tried with a variety of chips and even mixtures of several kinds and you can't go wrong.  Don't pass this recipe up.

Very delicious and even better the next day. In my opinion, the glaze is very important. I think the bars would be too dry without it. I only made one change and that was replacing the ap flour with whole wheat. Next time I make these I will add some of the chocolate chips right in the batter as suggested by other reviewers.

These bars have a delicious peanutty flavor.  I used a smaller pan (7" x 11"), as I thought the 13" would result in bars that are too thin for our tastes.   We baked a little longer than the recipe called for.  The frosting definitely adds another layer of peanutty goodness!  I recommend it.

Very good recipe! My daughter and niece couldn't get enough of them! I didn't change the recipe, but when I put the icing on, I put it all in a small ziploc bag and cut a small hole in the corner. Makes it easier to "drizzle" on the icing! Yum!

These were pretty good.  Don't make them if you're looking for a dense, chewy peanut butter bar because they are a bit cakey.  I'd say they're more like peanut butter cookies baked in the form of peanut butter bars.  So, they taste fine, but I don't think I'll make them again because I personally felt they were too cakey and didn't have enough peanut butter flavor.

I lIked these, but, I think they would be better with more chocolate.  I think next time I'll top them with chocolate frosting.

I love making these bars! They are the best peanut butter bars I have EVER eaten! They are fast and easy to make. I absolutly love making them. My husband eats almost the whole pan by himself. My friends love them too! These are the #1 dessert choice for me!

It may have been my fault since I baked this in an 8x8 rather than a 9x 13, but I found these quite dry. The flavor was great though, and the icing was perfect!

Did not bother with the icing. My 6 year old loves making it and the rest of the house can't stop eating it!

I made these bars following the recipe exactly and they tasted great. However, I wasn't thrilled with the texture; too crumbly. I made them again and added another egg and that held them together better. It's a great recipe though because it mixes up quickly and most people have these ingredients on hand.

I thought it would be more of a granola bar but it turned out to be more like a cookie.

These are excellent!  We love chocolate and peanut butter so a pan of these doesn't last much more than a day in our house.  Be sure to mix the chocolate chips into the dough-much better this way.  I also double the icing recipe because we like our frosting too!

These are fantastic!  They are super easy - my 9 year old daughter made them.  Make sure you use real butter and a high quality peanut butter that has lots of PB flavor.

These were awesome!  I made them for a cub scout meeting and they were gone.  Several people asked me for the recipe.

Delish! Instead of topping with chocolate chips, I mixed in the chips instead and used a mixture of white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, semisweet chocolate chips and some peanut butter chips. I also used two cups of chips total. I did top with the drizzle. They turned out VERY GOOD.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise. I was looking for a simple way to make a treat with the creamy peanut butter I had sitting in the cabinet. This was so quick and delicious. It was a little rich, but I wasn't complaining.

Great flavor with on hand ingredients! These bars turned out great with the exception of cooking a little too long on the sides. The texture wasn't exactly what I was looking for but they definitely taste better than they look. Also, I forgot to grease the pan but had no problems. I omitted the icing and don't think i'm missing anything. Would definitely make again because if I wanted a quick treat without a trip to the store.
