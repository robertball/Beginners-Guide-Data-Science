Quick and easy fix.  I mixed in crushed corn flakes with my bread crumbs. Delicious and crunchy.  A nice way to get the crunch without having to fry.

The only thing I did differently was half the breasts instead of pounding them flat. Chicken came out moist and delicious. Big hit with picky eaters.

It really doesn't get much easier than this...  I used light Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and panko breadcrumbs that I seasoned with a little grated Parmesan cheese and dried parsley, The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful.  Great recipe if you're short on time or just love ranch dressing.

I've made this recipe a couple times now and it is delicious as is, but this time I mixed some Mexican style shredded cheese in with the breadcrumbs. The cheese really kicked up the flavor. I also do not use any oil. I've found that spraying my glass baking dish and the tops of the chicken, they brown up nicely without the extra greasiness. I usually use thin cut chicken breasts or breast tenderloins so no need for pounding them out. Definitely a staple at my house. Even the picky hubby loves this chicken.

If you want easy and good! This is it. I did not use the oil it called for, instead I sprayed the baking dish with canola cooking spray. Same effect with less use of oil and I found it keeps the bottom of the chicken from being oilly. My family said this is a do again dish!

used on chicken breasts (not pounded) cooked 360 for 40mins and was perfect, stupidly to keep them warm while waiting for hubby to get home i left in the warm oven and that over cooked so dried them out. BUT i ate one right out of the oven myself before they got dried out and it was so good. (used ranch + a little mayonnaise as didn't have enough ranch and a little milk to thin the mixture out)

Really good and really easy! For a little juicier, crunchier chicken, bake at 400 for 20 minutes.

This recipe is awesome.  Just made it for supper and the boyfriend loved it as well.  Too add just a little something, once it was finished I added a little mozzarella on top then put in the warm oven to melt.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! Sooo easy to put together for picky eaters! I did tweak it a little bit by adding a half packet of ranch dressing seasoning to the mixture, along with substituting olive oil for the veggie oil. Super moist and no additional sauce needed (I'm a big sauce person). :)

Great recipe!  I tripled it for 7 people and most of it was eaten.  I took another reviews suggestion and marinated the chicken in the ranch for a few hours before cooking (mostly because it was easy to do that during nap time) and I added season salt, creole seasoning, pepper, and garlic to the chicken after the dressing and before the bread crumbs.  I sprayed the pan with pam instead of oil and had no problem with sticking.  My husband says this is a keeper recipe :-)

This was easy, fast, and delicious. I took one reviewer's suggestion and added crushed cornflakes in with the bread crumbs. Also, I served it with buffalo wing sauce on the side. The ranch and buffalo flavors complimented each other perfectly. I'll be making this again soon!

Love it love it love it i made it for my husband and son and they are asking when will we have it again.  I made a change because we are spicy eaters i put a little hot sauce in the ranch that i let the chicken marinate and instead of bread crumbs i crunched up some spicy gold fish to give it that cheesey kick.  I will be doing this again!

I used to always make this as a quick dinner, the only difference is that the recipe I used had me pan-fry the chicken. Not only is this way of cooking it healthier, but it also keeps the breading almost completely in-tact. Frying it always takes the topping off, which is the best part! I sliced the chicken instead of pounding it, way easier and more quiet with little babies in the house. It's a wonderful and quick week night dinner!

I am not a bigger cooker but my kids loved this dish. It was truly simple to do. I served with baby buttered potatoes and a veggie.

Tried this last night and family all ate it.  I like the idea from a reviewer of marinating in the ranch for awhile, I will try that next time.  Also, I had to increase the cooking time.

Copied from a reviewer and added shredded mozzarella about 10 mins before the chicken was finished and decided to use some townhouse light and buttery crackers and mine turned out amazing! My family raved about how great the chicken turned out. The crust was beautiful!

I quite enjoyed this.  I ran out of ranch, so skipped on the oil and added in some greek dressing to the mix.  I used Panko, and served it with a kale and quinoa side, eith some roasted red peppers.  

An all around win, for something so simplistic.   Thank you!

I made this recipe.  The chicken came out tender. I used Panko bread crumbs and saltine crackers.  I used two chicken thighs, bone in.  Cooking was at 400 for 30 minutes.  However, mine came out soggy.  Also, I marinated in Bob's Big Boy Ranch Dressing and Louisiana hot sauce.

It was an easy, breaded baked chicken recipe. Wasn’t very ranchy, kids had to dip in ketchup. 

But 3 stars because it was a good breaded chicken base that could incorporated into a great chicken pasta bake or something

This recipe was the bomb! (Which means,  really,  really good!) I used three plump chicken breasts that were defrosted, halved them and tenderized then into cutlets.  Hence, since I was short one breast, I cut back a bit on the other ingredients.

The chicken was beyond moist and tender.  

My changes were only that I thinned down the thick Kraft ranch dressing a bit with water and baked the chicken on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.   So, so good!!

I used three bone-in, skin-on large chicken breasts dipped in bottled ranch dressing and sprinkled liberally with bread crumbs placed in a foil lined 9x13 glass baking dish cooked at 360 degrees for one hour twenty minutes until the thickest piece had an internal temperature of 165. Foil made clean-up easy and three large breasts made three meals for two.

Amazing, juicy chicken breast baked with the tasty tang of ranch under a crisp coating of Italian bread crumbs with grated  marble cheese on top of it! Yum! I’ve never made ranch chicken in my life and decided to try it. My three kids (11,10 and 7) and my hubby LOVED this recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was outstanding. So glad I made this. Recipe is definitely a keeper and it’ll be a regular item on the menu for sure! So quick and easy to make and most of all delicious

made it as recommended. Cooked 25 min longer, since I did not pound the chicken breasts or cut them small. I only cut them in half, so they were still thick

I was pleased with the ease to prepare this dish. I cut my chicken into strips, as I was taking it to a potluck and wanted more of a "finger food". These did not crisp up as I would have liked, but that could be because I put two half sheet pans in my oven and they may not have gotten a good airflow. 
Yes. I will make this again. but maybe try to do a smaller batch. 
Everyone like them anyways.

This was so tasty and moist!  The only thing I did differently is marinated the chicken in the dressing for about 45 minutes.  I will definitely make it again and try a bit of Parmesan in with the breading.  Another plus, it's still moist when the leftovers are microwaved.  I find that chicken can be a bit dry when reheated but these were great.

Very Good! In Germany we lose it.
If the baking sheet is in the oven, while it is preheating, you will get a nice cross underside of the chicken.

I made 2 changes, first I added shredded Monterey Jack cheese to the bread crumb mixture, and second, I put the chicken on a higher rack and broiled it for about ten minutes.  The chicken still came out juicy and the top crust was just a little more crispy.  I also used bacon ranch dressing, because, well, Bacon!

So simple and so good.  I also took other reviews into consideration and marinated the chicken for 30 min first and used cooking spray instead of oil.  I also seasoned my breadcrumbs to my liking and added the parmesan cheese to them. But I can see it being good the original way.  I just added my preferences to it.

My family loved it. It is great along with some chicken flavored rice. The only thing I would add is maybe some red pepper flakes for a a kick.

I used crushed up Ritz crackers for the breading & this by far is my family's favorite dish! Use Ritz crackers.... I promise you'll fall in love.

It is healthier, because it is baked. That was the first star. My children and I love Ranch Dressing which gives you 2nd and 3rd stars. My hubby liked it (4th star), Nobody complained!!!! 5 stars in my book. :) --- Didn't have the breadcrumbs, so I had to crush StoveTop Stuffing Mix instead.

I made this tonight and it was okay tasting. If I make it again I will add more seasonings to the mix and bake the chicken longer.
