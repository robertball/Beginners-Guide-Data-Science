These were excellent! Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, I will make these often and experiment with different herbs.

Delicious!  

Funny thing, if you like potato latkes but don't like the hassle of grating, draining, frying.....you can actually leave the rosemary out, just salt and pepper them with olive oil, bake as directed then serve with grated cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, whatever you like on the side. They taste just like potato latkes like that.
