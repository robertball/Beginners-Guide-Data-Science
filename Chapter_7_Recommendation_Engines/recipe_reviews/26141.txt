Really great cookie!  A nice addition to my Christmas tray this year, and something that would be nice anytime with tea.  A little time consuming compared to a drop cookie, but not bad, and worth it for something not sooooo sugary sweet.  Got more comments on this one than on any of the other dozen types of cookies on the tray!

Maybe because I'm not German I wasn't able to appreciate these cookies like the rest of the reviewers did. I found that these are very time consuming to make. I made only half the recipe, cutting the cookies into 2 1/2" circles. I wound up with 23 cookies instead of 12. Visually they are very pale. An egg wash or even a sprinkle of sugar before baking would brown them nicely. If I ever make these again I will roll them out and cut into 4" circles, place filling and fold over, empanada style. Easier and not as time consuming.
