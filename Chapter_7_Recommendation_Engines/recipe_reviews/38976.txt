This is a great recipe! The kids loved it! I added cool whip to the top and sprinkled chocolate chips over it. It made alot so I froze the leftovers they can pop them in the toaster on school mornings.

They tasted wonderful :)) We had them topped with Chocolate Chip ice cream, which helped coz they came out a little dry. My waffles tend to do that. Anyone with tips on preventing dryness?

I have been making these waffles now and then for a couple of years now. Every single time they turn out delicious. I change it around to add some variation sometimes. For example, sometimes I'll make it exactly like the recipe says and other times I won't melt the chips I'll just add them to the batter. Sometimes I'll add chopped banana as well. Every time they turn out equally tasty. I use maple syrup, fruit syrups and/or whip cream for toppings.

My daughter gave this recipe 5 stars.  She and my son really liked them.  I thought they needed a little something, but I am not quite sure what.  My daughter ate them with syrup and my son and I ate them plain so maybe they are better with fruit and/or whipped cream.  I will try that the next time I make them.

I have now made this recipe several times, and my children love it. They eat them plain (no powdered sugar, no syrup, etc.) and have yet to complain about the lack of a topping. The adults who have eaten these have also raved about the taste. 
     I am unsure what to say about those who have had "soggy" issues. I followed the recipe exactly, used a Belgian waffle maker, preheated till the light went out, and cooked them until the steam stopped escaping. Perfection!

I was very dissapointed in the outcome of this recipe. No matter how long I cooked the waffle they were almost soggy - not crisp like they should be as a dessert waffle. Also the flavor was very bland - almost floury. I wouldn't make these again.

Yummy!
My husband had snitched most of the chocolate chips :), so I used about 1/3 cup chocolate chips, 1 Tbsp. chocolate syrup, and 1/2 cup cocoa for the chocolate. To add some depth of flavor, I replaced 1/2 cup of the milk with coffee. The first were a little soft, but I put them in the oven at 350 for a few minutes to crisp them. Ate with Cool Whip and strawberries. Next I'm going to try them spread with chunky peanut butter!

Did I make a different recipe?  These waffles came out tasting decent but SOGGY AS CAN BE!  Never Eat Soggy Waffles!

If you disregard this warning and choose to make these soggy, soggy waffles anyway, you should also know:

After you melt the chocolate and the butter and let it come to room temperature, when you add the milk, the chocolate/butter mixture will seize up, forcing you to replace the entire concoction in the microwave to remelt.  Lucky I added the milk before the eggs, so this was an option.

I dunno if there is a way to avoid the seizing; possibly I let the mixture cool too much (or not enough?)

MMMMMMM! These are sooooo good, like brownies ... I use self rising flour + 3/4 tbls scant baking powder and buttermilk; and added (personal pref) mini chocolate chips to batter; 1st time I made 1 batch but 2nd time I had to make double the batch, my family love having it plain (as I do) or with whipped cream and/or icecream. Oh I lessened the flour a bit to avoid dryness (it worked), and let the mixture sit awhile (15 minutes or more if you can stand it) to thicken. *19th Apr. 04: Changing this to 5 stars, the taste is sooo exquisite and when my waffle iron went on the blink, made the rest into pancakes/pikelets, and those were great too.

My seven-year-old said, "They should expand teh rating system to ten stars for this recipe!"  These were a lot more moist than standard waffles, which normally turn out a little crispy for me.  Also, when I mixed the milk and eggs with the chocolate sauce,  The cold ingredients caused the chocolate to lump up a bit.  I think this could have been prevented by allowing ALL of the ingredients to come to room temperature.  This goes great with the  "Chocolate Gravy II," also found on this site.
