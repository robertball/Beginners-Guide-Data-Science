I pretty much made this tonight, without having seen this recipe. Being a casserole, you can change things as you see fit. I used cumin instead of oregano/basil, canned diced tomatoes, canned tomato sauce, no zucchini nor beans, and folded in spinach at the very end. I was awesome! I also used some of it to stuff those mini bell peppers (see photos). They were delicious!

I left out the kidney beans because we aren't bean people and I didn't have any but otherwise this was delicious. Warm and hearty and perfect for a cool evening.

Awesome way to use a bunch of garden veggies! Substituted quinoa for barley, and it really doesn't need the cheese, in my opinion. Wonderful! Thank you!

absolutely loved this!  I didn't have kidney beans, so I used canned lentils.  Wasn't sure how it would be with the lentils, but it was actually very good!

Great recipe! We really enjoyed this, and liked that the meat/veggie mixture was paired with barley. I added about four more cloves of crushed garlic and put a little shredded parmesan cheese/chives on the top instead of cheddar. Definitely a keeper!

This was a pretty yummy recipe.  I used quinoa instead of barley and added more veggies than it called for.  The instructions said to bring it to a boil however there was no liquid to boil once all the ingredients were put together so I added some water, maybe a cup or so.  I thought the flavors were pretty good, my husband added a little taco sauce for extra flavor/spice and ate it with chips (he needs something crunchy with his food).  I would make this again.

This meal was very good! I would recommend adding a little salt to the water for the barley. I was tempted to add more zucchini than the recipe called for but I felt for the first time I should make the recipe exactly as directed. The amount of zucchini was just perfect so I'm glad I didn't add more. Like another reviewer said, the cheese is good but you don't really need it. Beause I have a cholesterol problem, I put a little cheese on part of my meal, then left it off the rest of it. As good as it was I felt it was missing a little something but ketchup took care of that! I will make this again.

Great Supper!! Not too difficult and lots of healthy tasty flavors.  I made it vegetarian by using veggie burger crumbles instead of beef. Super yummy!!

Made this the other night and substituted all ingredients to organic and used fire roasted chopped tomatoes in BPA free can with no salt vs. hand cut.  In a hurry and like the flavor.  I also used Grass Fed Ground Sirloin vs regular ground beef.  We loved it.  Had enough for left overs which we are having tonight.  Should be much more flavorful with the extra day of being in the refrigerator.  Served it with small organic green salad with veggies etc.  Perfect meal.

Easy dinner.  Used cauliflower (only veg I had) and salsa. Terrific. Served it on nacho chips for kids, on a cooked potatoe for healthy option. Really good.

Pretty tasty.  I thought it was heavy on the barley so I'll cut that next time.

Changed a couple of things.  Substituted a cup and a half of low sodium beef broth for half of the water when cooking the barley.  Added a little water along with the peppers because mixture was getting too dry.  We liked the meal, but it lacked a little spice for our taste, or we would give it a five.  Next time I'll either double the spices or add a little cumin and chili powder (maybe both).
