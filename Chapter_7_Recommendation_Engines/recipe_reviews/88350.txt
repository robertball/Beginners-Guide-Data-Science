This was very good, with the following modifications: I used oil packed tuna, because it has more flavor, and reduced the olive oil. I also added some chopped kalamata olives instead of salt, and threw in some green beans and about a tbsp of oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes. I served it at room temperature, but it would also be delicious chilled or hot. This recipe is really a great starting point for many variations. One thing to note, though is that angel hair pasta should not be cooked as long as the recipe directs. Check the label on your box--it's 3 minutes for dry at most and about a minute for fresh.

I love this recipe!  The capers are a delicious twist.  I doubled everything except the oil to cut back the fat and calories, and didn't miss it a bit.  I also added chopped celery and red onion.  (I can't wait to try this with smoked salmon in place of the tuna!) I will definitely be making this tuna salad on a regular basis.  
Edit: Tried this with smoked salmon and lots of red onion....Fantastic!!  If you can splurge on the salmon, I highly recommend trying this.

This recipe will likely become a quick/cheap staple for my house. As many do, there are a few mods: Used elbow macaroni and when it was done cooking and drained, I added a bag of frozen peas. I let that sit while I put together the sauce and then mixed it up. It makes a great standard tuna salad recipe alternative -- not too much mayonnaise and no dang hard-boiled eggs!

This is really good--and I'm a picky pasta salad person.  I do, however, LOVE capers so I had to try this when I saw it.  I didn't have angel hair so I used spaghetti.  I think, however, that I'd prefer using rotini or penne--spaghetti and angel hair are just too hard for me to mix!  I also added more capers--2 teaspons is just not enough for me, but then again I really like them.  Otherwise, I think this is great.  it's very quick and easy too, and as other's have said, very light and fresh.  A perfect pasta salad for my tastes.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was great. I decided to add hard boiled eggs and celery and it gave it a great flavor.

I had a little bit of wheat pasta and some tuna and wanted to make a light lunch.  This was fantastic!  I didn't have the capers, but will add next time.  I also added onion so I could have some crunch.  Love this and will make it again and again - good hot or cold!

My family really enjoys this recipe!  I make it without the mayonnaise because of my kids' egg allergies and it's great!  I prefer it with egg noodles if I'm only making it for me & my hubby, but usually make it with various kinds of non-egg wheat pasta so the whole family can eat it.  I typically double the recipe and use a pound of pasta, and then I'll use one can of tuna packed in oil and one can of white albacore.  I leave the ratios of everything as stated in the recipe, but do add extra capers.

My mayo was past its prime so I ended up with a non creamy sauce over water packed tuna and whole wheat pasta. I cut the olive oil back to 4 tbsp and used 12 oz of tuna...doubled the capers...a decent subsitute, and worth making again the right way!

This was pretty good. We don't like capers so I substituted green olives, and I cut the oil in half, because we don't like oily pasta.

This is a great recipe to start from and build a dish specific to your taste. I used cavatappi pasta, added celery, red onion, sun dried tomatoes, extra capers, hard boiled egg. I left out the mayo. I know this sounds like too much of diversion from the original for my rating to mean much, but I can tell from how mine tasted that the original is worth 5 stars. And it gets 5 for its versatility.

Followed the directions exactly and it turned out delicious! I've only tried it warm so far, but will have it cold for lunch tomorrow. I'm sure it will be just as tasty, if not better. A winner for tuna lovers!!

This is really easy to make. I use whole grain rotini, so it becomes great energy food. Super quick to make at night to take for lunch at work the next day!

I tried this because I had most of the ingredients.  I wasn't sure what to expect, whether I would like it or not, but I did like it after all.  Since I didn't have Dijon mustard, I used regular mustard and added some honey to sweeten it.  It all tasted pretty good after all.  My family said they liked it!

Definitely a keeper!  I use tri-color rotini for the pasta and reduce the oil a bit just to try to cut back on calories.  I love it topped with some slivered almonds - yum!!

Both my flatmate and I enjoyed this, but I made it as a hot dish - not a cold salad. I didn't have capers, so I fried up some onions to go in (and also added mixed veg, boiled up with the spaghetti).--If I had thought to I would have pan-fried the tuna a bit with the onion to get a more-cooked less-fishy taste. I also didn't have dijon mustard, which is one of my favorites, and I'm sure adds to the flavor. I've got Mrs. Dash Chipotle seasoning which I combined with a few other flavors to bring out the best in this dish.

So good.  So simple and fast.  No changes recommended.  I think that quality ingredients (i.e. tuna, pasta, oil) really make it.

This is a healthy, economical, tasty dish with lots of zip and versatility.  It's great as is or as the other reviewers suggest, you can use this as a base and add whatever you like.  I added white beans for  fiber, corn for color and tofu cutlets for even more protein.  It all worked nicely.  Just make sure to make more sauce if you add more igredients.

Delicious and simple.  The only change I made was a reduction in olive oil to 4 tbsp, and I used chunk white tuna.  I will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful as a sandwich filling (without the pasta) and works with canned salmon as well. I sometimes substitute half the mayo for low fat sour cream to save on calories and it still tastes great. This recipe is a staple for me now. Thanks!

This was really easy to make. Good way to get rid of some extra pasta and a small filet of tuna. Plus since it's cold I can bring it to work and not have to worry about stinking up the microwave.

Everyone in the house loved it. Will definitely make again. Made a few changes: didn't have capers, though I know they'd be delicious, so I used extra Dijon. Also added veg. That I had in the fridge, red peppers, shredded some carrots, spinach and halved grape tomatoes. This was really good.

I didn't have enough olive oil so I didn't drain the oil that the tuna was packed in and I added an extra tablespoon of mayo.  The capers made it for me!

Really good!   I made with rotini.  Personally added a little more mayo and a hit of olive oil  to juice it up because I also added some fresh finely diced peppers and red onion. Love that it doesn't kill the tuna flavor like some super creamy  dishes.  LOVE capers so increased a bit.  I think black olives would be great here, or some feta cheese.  GREAT recipe.  Can easily adapt to taste and pantry/fridge ingredients.  Tarragon was a nice hit, too.   Had a craving but couldn't create a dish until I read this.  Great lunch!

This is AMAZING as is!  And very versatile.  The second time I made it with bow tie pasta and added minced garlic and sun-dried tomatoes --it was even better!  This recipe is surely a keeper, yay!

This is a good recipe, but it didn't go over too well with my kids. Either they didn't like the dijon in it, or maybe the taste of my extra virgin olive oil was overpowering. I was also a little bit put off, but I would still make this again.

Very tasty! I used bowtie pasta and about 6 oz of seared yellow-fin tuna, broken up. Also I used only about half the oil. Next time I'm going to add some peas, I think. It was a big hit at the barbeque pitch-in. I think I'll use the sauce on hot pasta too.

This was really good...the only changes I made were that I used only about 1/2 of the oil, I added 1 teaspoon of garlic, used a 13 oz can of chicken because I was out of tuna, and I added about 1/2 of a can of great northern beans. I know it sounds like a lot of changes, but not really. I will definitely be trying this with the tuna as stated :) A quick,easy, and cheap meal.

This was pretty good!  I added a touch more dijon and used regular spaghetti (I was out of angel hair).  I had it warm for dinner, but the cold leftovers were much better.  Thanks, Kelly!

I made this with shell pasta, some chopped red onion and some chopped red bell pepper. It was great!
The family decided we like this best served cool. Not just out of the fridge, and not warm.
I will make this again.

I used leftover homemade tartar sauce instead of mayo. I also used garlic salt and a little paprika

This is outstanding!  I made it like the recipe said with the exception that I doubled the mayo, mustard, lemon juice mixture instead of adding oil.  Fabulous!

It was ok. I wouldn't personally tell people about it. I didn't like it. It is ok for like you don't have any money and it's good enough ahhaha. That's me at the moment. I'm low on cash and it will do. It's ok but not great. I don't give it 1 star though because that would be I would never make it again. I'm not really a picky eater I was like my dad ahah. I'll try and eat anything (well just about). I like everything in the ingredients. I guess it's the mustard that gives it a swangy taste to it I don't care for, but I will still eat it. It that makes at all sense.

Very tasty! I was looking for a simple clean-out-your-pantry and use-what-you-have kind of dish and this wins hands down. All ingredients are readily available. Followed the dressing except I didn’t have capers so I substituted red onion. Used rotini out of preference and added some greens - fresh spinach, peas and frozen green beans. I’m very pleased with how it turned out!

I never rate but this is awesome! I had accidentally bought tuna in oil and needed to get rid of it. I loosely drained the tuna and omitted the oil and added the whole small jar of capers. Everything else was exact. I will definitely make it again and again...

This dish has a subtle, delicious flavor. I only used four tablespoons of olive oil, and I used bow-tie pasta. My family loved it. It's a winner!

As others have said, it's an excellent base. Made it tonight... kind of. Didn't have capers or Dijon mustard, and I like my food to have a bit of kick to it, so I adjusted!

I added diced jalapeños instead of capers, added about 1/2 teaspoon of jalapeño juice, a dash or two of garlic powder, and replaced the Dijon mustard with honey mustard (which offset the heat quite nicely). Turned out great in my book!

Next time, I'll have to try the actual recipe!

This was a really good recipe. I used egg noodles, for a shorter noodle, 2 pouches of tuna, increased mayo and decrease olive oil for a creamier, less oily mix. I flaked my tuna and tossed in some lemon pepper before adding it to the sauce mixture. DH doesn't like capers, so I substituted sliced pickles instead. I omitted the salt, as there was plenty in boiling the water, and added a bit of extra lemon pepper to the sauce. I also added a few hard boiled eggs for extra protein. It was a big hit.

Getting my daughter protein is not easy, and she loves tuna, so this works great.   I've tried to just "wing it" at times making it, but I need to stick to the recipe closely for best results.  Thank you!

I used penne and added diced tomatoes and a touch of relish. Mmmmm
