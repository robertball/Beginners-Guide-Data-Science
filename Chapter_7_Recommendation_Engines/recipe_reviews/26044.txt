Fabulous cake! Looks really impressive and tastes as good as it looks! I serve with Butter pecan ice cream and I never have any left when we have people to dinner! Excellent and not terribly hard to do!

I was really excited about making this cake. What a disappointment! A lot of work for just a mediocre cake. It didn't taste like a pecan pie to me and it wasn't as moist as it needed to be. The best thing about it was the frosting. I hate to give bad reviews but will not make this cake again!

This I would have to give five stars and my husband moved this up to his top 10 list. I have to say With 9 eggs total 3 c. pecans and all the cream and corn syrup this is very rich and not too cheap either. BUT my company loved it even though neither of them like pecan pie. Might save this for holidays or special occasions. Note: I saved enough filling to spread some on top of cake with a few whole pecans for decoration.

I made this cake because I am not a big fan of pecan pie; reason being that pecan pie has no definitive flavor other than intensely sweet. The cake is the same; very sweet and no definitive flavor. If you are a pecan pie fan then you may like this cake but I won't make it again unless it's for family or friends.

This cake is yummy!!! It is also very attractive. I made it for Christmas last year (2006) and there was no leftovers. (Iwas dissapointed because I more the next day) I am so glad I found this recipe again. Thanks Tanya
