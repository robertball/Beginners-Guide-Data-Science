Quick and easy. I added some parmesian cheese,salt,vermouth and shrimp and served it over linguini. If you are looking for something to serve in a hurry, this is a good recipe

I is a very good base recipe for this sauce.  I added paprika, ground ginger, cayenne pepper, and sugar.  Those added ingredients really kicked up the flavor.

Great recipe--used cream of mushroom soup, couldn't find cream of shrimp.  But it was still wonderful over rice.  Also added a little velveeta and turned out great.

I followed the list of ingredients exactly, save for adding a few dashes each of cayenne pepper and paprika to add a little something to an otherwise kind of bland sauce. Very simple to make, but wayyy too thick and FAR too cheesy for my taste when putting on top of shrimp.... which I was. Basically tastes like a cheese sauce. Would probably be good on a pasta and chicken dish, but to call it a shrimp sauce... no. Just no.

Great starter sauce. I added 2 teaspoons homemade Cajun seasoning" commercial ones are too salty" zest of a small lemon. Excellent with blackened salmon,roasted vegetables and pasta.

This was a quick, easy sauce for shrimp, asparagus and noodles. Wish it were just a tad spicier.
