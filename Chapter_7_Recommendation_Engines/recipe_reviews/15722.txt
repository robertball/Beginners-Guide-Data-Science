I wasn't sure what to make of this recipe before I made it (all I could picture is whoopie pies, which is two small cakes with filling inside).  This is not whoopie pie!  The texture of the cookies is not really cookies, more like brownies.

A few things;  1)  The "cookie batter" is really hard to stir.   I mixed this with my hands, like a meatloaf.  2) Make sure you use parchment paper on the pans.  I made my first batch on a regular cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick spray and those babies were hard to get off without deforming them. 3)  I used a number 40 scoop to make sure I had an even amount of batter so I would get the same sized cookie but you could use a Tbls x 2.

I changed up the filling a bit by adding 1/2 stick of butter, 1tsp vanilla, and a Tbls of milk.  Popped it in a zip lock bag, cut off the end and "piped" the filling on a cookie and topped with the second cookie.

These were wonderful!  Very tasty and different

This recipe was really easy to make.  We found we liked it better when the cookies were not cooked as long (maybe 9 min) so they were a little softer.

I love this recipe!  I actually got it from a friend of mine, but she uses my absolute favorite cake mix, RED VELVET!  The Red Velvet cookies are awesome, as are Carrot Cake and Butter Pecan. The Butter Pecan are very sweet though...I want to try it with just a yellow or white cake mix and see how they taste...Here are some changes/things I do: first, I don't roll them into balls, I just use the Pampered Chef small scoop and they turn out the perfect size.  Also, my icing is a bit different.  It won't taste so cream cheesey this way - I use 1 block cream cheese softened, 1 stick butter softened, 4 cups powdered sugar (which is one box), and 1 teaspoon vanilla....SO YUMMY!!!  I keep these in the fridge also!  Try the Red Velvet if it is available in your area... YUM-O!!

Outstanding! I loved these because they are so unique and taste like little chocolate cheesecakes without the plate and fork to serve to a crowd. I was skeptical about the cake mix but I used two packages of devil's food cake mix and the cookies were extra chocolatey like ice cream sandwich cookies. 
I made the balls to flatten about half the size though so they turned out the size of a normal cookie rather than a giant one. Much more attractive this way. Also, I would cut the icing sugar in half next time. There was so much confectioners sugar that you could barely taste the cream cheese. I'll start with one cup and add to taste if necessary. I'm sure that way, it would have earned a 5-star rating from me. A keeper recipe for sure! I brought them to work and people actually came and found me after having one, usually with an "OMG" comment :) Enjoy! dee

Update:2/2011- This has been such a go to recipe for me for a quick dessert. But today I out did myself. I made the cookies with red velvet cake mix and I filled them with cream cheese frosting with mini chocolate chips.Then for Valentines I stenciled a powdered sugar heart on the top cookies. They looked amazing and they tasted so good!
WOW!! Great recipe. My husband came in late tonight but wanted a dessert. I threw these together and we had a great tasting snack in time for our favorite program. The only substitution was canned icing and it worked great!
Update: I have since made this recipe with butter cake mix adding in a tsp of almond liquer and 1/2 cup finely chopped almonds. I put them togather with orange marmelade and they were fantastic.

I got this recipe long ago from a camp cook and when I found I lost the recipe I went looking...so glad I found it! Although I don't make these often, everytime I do I wonder why I don't. 
Try them frozen - they taste like an amazing ice cream sandwich.

I just made these great cookies for our bake sale. They were the first thing to leave. I did use a different cake mix. I used triple fudge cake mix{BETTY Cr} and I used Devils food Cake mix{Pislbury}, I was concern over the cookies being hard. I felt as though the fudge mix would bring in softness. let me tell you it did, and did not have a fudgy softness, but just perrrrrfect, and it had mini chips in it, next time i might add WHITE chips to them. For the cream, i followed another person recommendation here, and added the 1TBLSP milk, teaspoon vanilla, and 1/2 stick butter. I made my butter room temp. I then scooped it all up after mix it, placed it in a ziplock bag,cutt the end and used it as a pastery bag. Be careful not to over fill because the crem is not thick, and don't press the cookie down to hard, Just fill them and let them sit.This was really great that way. I am keeping this recipe. My kids loved it, and the parents raved over them, Not to mention SUPER QUICK!!!.. Thank you

I made this and it was soooo easy! Tastes really good too! I used two random chocolate cake mixes that i found sitting in the pantry and one had mini chocolate chips in it which was kind of a nice touch to th cookie...I might have to make more though because I'm taking them to a party tonight and I can't stop eating them!

Very good cookies!  For those who are concerned about the calories I replaced the oil with apple sauce.  It didn't taste any different and makes it a lot healthier.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OMG, these were amazing! With some modifications in the frosting...since everyone said how gross & non-complementing the frosting was, I took some advice from other raters-->Filling: Beat with mixer 4 ounces cream cheese softened, 1 T Vanilla extract, 1 T milk, 1/2 stick butter (4T)softened, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar. As fr the cookies, they were perfect as is! I put them all in an air-tight container....and they are amazing the next day. Very chewy and delic.

Such a simple recipe with so MANY possibilities! I made awesome spider cookies for Halloween with dark chocolate cake mixes.  I added orange to the cream filling, licorice for legs and decorator's frosting for eyes - orange, green and black.  These are cookies best made on the small size because they are VERY rich and delicious but hard to eat the whole cookie if too large.  Be sure to use parchment paper and they will come right up without any damage to the cookie.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

These are very good.  They are very rich, almost too sweet, so I gave them a rating of 4. I recommend making small cookies if you don't want to get overwhelmed.

Fabulous! I tripled the recipe for a party and used 3 boxes dark cake mix, 2 boxes devils food and 1 box yellow cake mix. I also used powdered eggs because I hadnt made it to the store. EVERYONE loved them and they were so moist and chewy. I added butter to the filling and found it to be just right. Even had some filling leftover so I will be making more today. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Delicious.  I suggest adding a teaspoon of vanilla extract to your cream cheese/sugar blend.  Use a piper or put the cream in a ziploc and cut the corner.  Much easier and cleaner! When putting the top cookie over the cream, twist it like an oreo to get the filling evenly smoothed out.  I also suggest you make smaller cookies.  Just use your hands to mix the batter (it's very stiff) and roll it into balls.  Use parchment paper on your cookie sheet and use your hand to flatten the cookie.  What a yummy treat. Highly recommend.

Made the recipe as-is, and am rating it as such.  I dislike it when people rate their own variations of the recipe instead of the recipe AS WRITTEN.  That being said (steps off the soap box, lol), I did follow a few things the second time around that were in the review boxes: 1. I mixed the dough with my hands.  Probably not the best idea, since the chocolate got EVERYWHERE.  That stuff is STICKY. Mix with a wooden spoon and 'fold' the dough instead of mixing it with your hands.  2. Timing of the cookies is perfect, I cooked them for 11 minutes (I fit about 12 cookies per cookie sheet with parchment paper).  The only thing I changed the second time around was I really smashed the cookies down with the heel of my hand, made the cookies look more like the picture when they came out!  3. Using my hands, I scooped out 2 tablespoons of cookie dough per cookie (I didn't have an appropriate scooper), and it made the cookies nice and even-looking. 4. Let the cookies dry COMPLETELY before icing them.  The first time I put icing and I ended up with mushy cookie all over my hands.  This time I covered the cookies with a clean towel and let them sit on the cooling racks for 1.5 hours before icing them with a spoon.  One big dollop of icing per cookie (about a tablespoon) and it worked good.    Best of luck! :)

Simple, fast and delicious. I used two regular chocolate mixes and added chocolate chips. I didn't have an opportunity to make the frosting because my husband and kids came home and the cookies went straight from the cooling rack into them. They all gave the cookies 5 stars as well. Definitely a new favorite in our house. Thanks Anne.

Very easy and very tasty!  I made one batch with two boxes of dark chocolate cake mix, and another batch with two boxes of vanilla cake mix.  Both turned out great.  I was making these for people whose taste I don't know very well, and I wasn't sure they would like cream cheese filling.  So, I opted for regular cake icing in the middle.  This made for an extremely sweet and filling but yummy cookie.  I will try again with cream cheese, because I love cream cheese. My cookies weren't firm in 12 minutes--more like 18-19 minutes.

I only gave this 3 stars because the cream cheese filling kind of ruined it for me.  I think it would work better with a peanut butter filling instead.  The cookies alone were amazing - I couldn't find low calorie cake mix so I used two boxes of Duncan Hinz Devils Food cake mix instead and it was delicious!  I will make it with peanut butter next time and let you all know how it came out!

Great recipe! I made the cookies chewey to my taste (7 minutes). Also I changed the recipe a little and added wip cream! I made this recipe twice today once red velvet flavored and one chocolate. With the red velvet I used cream cheese frosting. But with the chocolate I made them into a cylinder shape and instead of using frosting I made wipcream! So good!

These were so delicious!  However I did find the dough a bit tough so I added about 1/3 cup apple sauce.  I actually add or substitue apple sauce for some of the butter is recipes.  It makes it that much more healthier and also adds more moisture and so much more yummier!!

Made a half batch as a test for an upcoming cookie exchange. I'll definitely be taking these with a few modifications. The cookie itself is awesome and oh so easy. It's soft and gooey, but holds up well to being handled. The reason only 4 stars for this recipe is the filling leaves something to be desired. As is, it's not nearly thick enough. I doubled the cream cheese and added some butter. It still oozed when I ate it, but I'll bet they'll set up in the fridge and be really good by tomorrow. I also think that these would make awesome icecream sandwiches.

***SO GOOD***You will not be disappointed if you try this.  I used two boxes of Devils Food cake mix because that's all I had on hand.  For the filling I used 4oz softened cream cheese and 1/2 stick of butter (4T), creamed those together and then added approx 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 T milk, and 1 T vanilla.  Before I added the powdered sugar I only poured 2 cups and slowly added more to get the right consistency I was looking for.
The cookie itself is like a Oreo Cakester.  They were a big hit and will definitely make again.  Thanks Anne!

These were amazing! They were easy to make and were a hit for Easter. I did add to the filling as suggested in someone else's review, I add 1/2 stick butter and tsp of vanilla to the filling, they had just enough sweetness to them. I did make them small then the2" it called for because they were hugh so I cut it down to about 1" balls. Thank you for the quick and easy cookies, I had added this to my family desserts. I will try it will Red Velvet cake next. Awesome!

They were pretty good, nothing too special. However they were very fast and easy with only 3 ingredients and store-bought frosting. I strongly recommend undercooking them otherwise they do end up hard and not nearly as good.  I made them smaller than in the instructions and only baked them for 7-8 minutes but I should have done even less still.

Great Recipe! I used this for a Christmas cookie exchange & added red/green food coloring to the icing. Very cute, but they didn't travel well. Tasted great! I made 1 inch balls & cooked them 7 minutes for a smaller cookie. For the filling I used 1/2 stick butter & creamed it with the cream cheese, then vanilla, & powdered sugar. They are delicious! Taste even better out of the fridge. I agree with another writer that peppermint would be good too!

Yummo! I like these a lot. I used a normal calorie mix, and I cut back on the confectioners sugar by half also. I made two batches of the filling just to see what the difference was and I believe that using 2 cups of confection sugar makes it sweeter but drowneds out the flavor of the cream cheese. If you like it more of a tangy cheese flavor, only use 1 cup. My opinion. With 2 cups the texture seems more silky though like a frosting.

These were really good and so easy my 11-year-old daughter made them by herself! I gave them 4 stars because we weren't crazy about the filling. We are definitely going to make them again, but might incorporate some of the suggested changes for the filling. My daughter would like a filling more like a whoopie pie.

We looooved these!  The taste is a more sophisticated version of the old sandwich cookie which appeals to both kids and adults and so easy to make!  I really liked the suggestion to put the icing in a ziplock baggie, snip the corner and pipe the icing onto one cookie.  This made filling the sandwich very fast, tidy and the cookie looks better too! I will make these again and again!

This recipe was really good. I cooked the cookies for about 10 minutes and at first they were a little harder than I would like, but I put them in an airtight container and the next morning they were soft. I gave it 4 stars because of the frosting. I added a lot more sugar, vanilla extract, and some milk. It was far to cream cheesey for my taste, but with a few small changes...the whole sandwich cookie was delicious. My kids love them!!

These were good and easy. My family ate them up in less than two days! I made my own cake mix from scratch cuz I didn't have any of the box but they still turned out great! Our store had a sale on the cake box mixes for a dollar a piece and I bought a bunch just to make this recipe! Thanks!!!!

Very easy.  I had only 1 devil's food cake mix, so I cut the recipe in half.  We also liked the softer cookie so opted for less baking time.  Filling is very sweet.  I will likely experiment with marshmallow creme filling or buttercream & cool whip filling for next time.

I agree with previous posts... they're more like a cookie/brownie than a cookie or cake. definitely NOT a whoopie pie. But mine were a lot flatter than the photo makes them appear. Although now that I look at other photos, maybe I just expected the unrealistic. They're fine flat - soft and chewy. I halved the size of the cookies, made 1'' or smaller balls, and baked them for 6 minutes. I tried baking some in a shaped cookie pan - hearts for valentines day. But they didn't work well... the centers sink. So I ended up with heart shaped mini cookie bowls... I gave up on the shapes and made the rest round - they're great :)

Gave this 3 stars for ease. But it was way too rich. I could only eat 1/2 a cookie. I followed one reviewers suggestions but I think the vanilla should have been cut in half. The cookie minus the filling would have been better.Very chocolaty cookie. I think the combination of the filling and cookie made it too much of a good thing.

FABULOUS!!  I used 2 boxes of dark chocolate cake mix. I have used this frosting recipe, but I've also added mint extract and green food coloring for a mint cookie - supurb.  My next try, I will use the creamy peanut butter frosting from this site - it will be great.

Very good.  I halved the recipe( I only had one box of chocolate cake mix on hand).  I used 4 oz of oil and two eggs and the consistency was perfect.  Cream cheese was very rich and I added just a tablespoon of butter and it gave it just enough buttery flavor.  It made 20 sandwich cookies and one extra half for taste testing.  I used the small pampered chef scoop and that worked very well.

Baked 8min, 10 sec. Used a watermelon baller so they cookies were all the same size. Don't over-fill the cookies or you won't have enough filling. We loved these!!

I didn't think these were that great. They also have a TON of fat and calories- 620 cal., 28 g. fat!! If I eat a cookie, I don't want to feel like I have to work it off with a long workout! I would rather make less fattening cookies, and be able to have more than one! And...if it is going to be loaded with fat, it better be amazing!!

I made these using devil's food cake mix and they were delicious. I used a standard buttercream frosting as the filling instead just as a personal preference. I made a double batch (yes, 4 boxes of cake mix!) for a church potluck and they were gone before any other dessert!

i thought these were just average....the cookies were pretty good, but I wasn't a big fan of the cream center. Kind of bland in my opinion, but my kids really liked them.

This are my favorite holiday cookies I could eat all of them! I split the frosting in half and add green food coloring to one mix and red food coloring to the other and then have very pretty christmas cookies to display.

My daughter loves these and they look impressive for a bake sale but they are not to my taste.  actualy she likes them best without the filling and I  think that is my objection too.  Some kind of healthy fruit or nut spread might be better.

I only gave this recipe 4 stars because I did not follow it exactly, but it was FANTASTIC!!  I had spice cake mix, so that is what I used, and my own recipe for cream cheese frosting for the filling.  But I followed the cake mix + eggs and oil (but I used olive oil) and it made a fantastic cookie!  So soft and not too sweet!  The batter was really sticky, but I just oiled my hands and it rolled into balls just fine!  10 minutes in the oven was perfect for mine!  Will definitely make these again!

these were way to sweet for my family, so I made a second batch and filled them with ice cream instead.  They were an instant hit! My neighbors were coming back days later for more!

I'm giving it 5 stars despite the fact that the filling was a bit gross to me.  I had planned on making these for a bake sale at school but didn't give myself enough time & the filling didn't turn out.  So I was left with A LOT of chocolate cookies.  But they were AWESOME!  Soooo soft and chewy even after almost a week!  So I halved the recipe the other night, using one box of yellow cake mix and added chocolate chips.  Sooooo GOOD! Yellow cake with chocolate frosting is my favorite but I feel like a pig when I make a cake.  So doing it cookie style works perfectly for me!

EDIT: Just used spice box cake and added cinnamon & nutmeg to the filling.... YYYYUUUUUUMMMMMMM!!

Very good cookies.  I made them for a bunch of teenagers and they said they were the best homemade oreos they have ever had.  My only complaint is the suggested size of the cookie. I made the first batch with a 2" cookie scoop and I thought they came out WAY too big.  So I made the rest using teaspoon size balls and they came out the perfect size for a sandwich cookie.

I did use egg substitute and also used non fat vanilla yogurt in place of the oil.  (just a caution, if you use the yogurt, the mixture is way too moist to roll, even after refrigerating.  I molded it between two spoons and dropped on a parchment covered cookie sheet)  I made chocolate with a canned vanilla frosting that I dyed yellow for the Steelers.  I also used white cake and a canned cherry frosting for the Cardinals.  These were a huge hit a the Super Bowl party I attended both with the kids and the adults.  I will be making again and experimenting with different flavors.  Thanks for the recipe!

Out of 5 kids, only one thought that this was good. I must say, I didn't care for these either. One didn't like the cookie. The others didn't like the filling with the cookie. I'll give it three stars because I can use the filling for another recipe. By the reviews, I do think this is a good recipe, just not for my famliy.

Sooooo good! Can't believe such a simple recipe makes such a great dessert. I made the cookies smaller than the recipe called for just because I prefer smaller sized cookies. I'm glad I did because they are very rich and I doubt I could eat a whole one otherwise. Wonderful!

These cookies were simple and amazing!  They took only a few minutes to make, but still produced a perfect cookie - you'd never guess they were so easy!!! A total keeper!  They were perfectly chewy, which was what I was looking for - I cooked them for 10 minutes.  They also came off the tray very easily, I didn't need the parchment paper that other reviewers mentioned needing.  These will be fun to experiment with too...mint frosting sounds extra good, as does putting a scoop of ice cream in the middle and making some amazing ice cream sandwiches!!!  Can't wait to make them again!!!

There is a reason this recipe has so many 5-star ratings. It is SOOOO simple and delicious! I am going to make sure to keep chocolate cake mix on hand so I can whip these up any time. These take 3 minutes to make and 9 to cook. How easy is that? And the chocolate cookie tastes so good you can eat it alone or experiment with dozens of fillings.

I made this recipe yesterday, I followed it exactly except I used one chocolate fudge cake mix and one german chocolate cake mix.  These are so good!  I did make one-inch cookies because I felt the two-inch were too big as they are very sweet!  A good fast recipe!

These cookies are fast, easy, and good.  Make sure to use quality cake mixes.  The chocolate taste in cheaper brands isn't strong enough to come through.

Very quick and easy recipe. I only had a yellow cake mix so I added cocoa powder to it. I also listened to the other reviews and added butter, vanilla, and milk to the icing, and then piped it from a plastic baggie. I made some large and some cookies and they were very good!

Very easy to make and they should really be called Brownie Sandwich Cookies because they are so moist!!!  If you're not a fan of cream cheese use vanilla frosting or even peanut butter frosting - yum!  
Going to make these with a spice cake mix next time!

I liked the recipe as is but I made some with fluffier filling (1 pint of whipping cream, 1.5 tsp vanilla, 1 cup powdered sugar) and that filling was fluffier.

These were horrible!  The texture was way off.  I tried baking them less, tried baking them longer, but the cookies either fell apart or were gooey and raw.  The cookies alone were edible at best.  Making sandwiches with these things were impossible.

Insanely amazing!! I make these cookies all the time for special occasions....or whenever I have a craving :P. The only thing I would say is to add 1 and 1/2 or 2 packages of cream cheese and confectioners sugar because I like them very creamy!

I used applesauce instead of oil, and I think I added a bit too much. The dough was so hard to work with--so sticky.  I added some powdered sugar to it to dry it out a bit but it got tough, and was still sticky! Also, I had to keep mine in for closer to 18 minutes to get them firm enough. I used the other reviewers' suggestion to use 1/2 stick butter and less cream cheese, 1 T milk and 1 T vanilla, and I ended up using nearly 3 cups of powdered sugar to get it to a less-oozy consistency. The cookies are really cake-like--I was hoping they'd be crispier. Next time I will try using some oil and making the cookies a bit smaller. I plan to freeze these.

OK, all you gluten free folks out there.  I tried this with Bette Crocker GF vanilla cake mix.  I added 1/3 cup soft butter and 2 eggs.  Mixed well and added white chocolate chips (all I had) and M & M's.  Kind of sweet, but tasty.  I used a 1 inch level cookie scoop and didn't press them down, but they spread just a tiny bit and became a not-to-rounded 2" cookie.  They baked for about 13 minutes.  Oh, I would add a bit more spray to the pan.  They do tend to stick with a light spray.  :)

So delicious! I have used a variety of cake mixes and the chocolate always seems to work best. When I did 2 yellow cake mixes it was very wet and hard to form into balls. I just stuck the dough in the fridge and that seemed to help. I normally fill them with homemade buttercream frosting. Love these!!!

These were really good! The first ones I made were made of normal cake mix, so those got really hard. However, when I used "super moist" cake mix, these were really chewy! Also, I cooked for 15 minutes.

These are awesome! I just used 2 boxes of regular chocolate cake mix instead of the dark and low calorie.   They're also great with a peanut butter frosting filling.

Delicious! I prefer more cream cheese in my cream cheese frosting so I used 16 oz cream cheese as well as a small amount of whipping cream to lighten it up. It was phenomenal and all of my co-workers were begging for the recipe!

I made these cookies using Butter Recipe Fudge cake mixes as that was my only option.  Ended up dropping them onto the cookie sheets as the batter was too soft to roll.  I made the mistake of flattening them slightly and the first two batches were paper thin and unusable.  Switched to a mini scoop with no flattening and they baked perfectly in about 10 minutes.  I made Faux-reo filling, my favorite, and the cookies are cute and delicious.  The frosting does overpower the chocolate cookie a bit, so next time I hope to find the dark chocolate cake mix called for in the recipe.  Fun and yummy to make with my son!

I make these all the time for my husband's work(which is all family relation) and they all like these. I use different chocoalte cake mixes and some times switch the filling in the middle. I have used the one with the recipes, a peant butter one, and a cream one. No matter what these turn out wonderful! I will continue making these as they are not costly to make.

Great recipe. I brought them to a company picnic and they won me the cookie competition. Only changes I made was to make the cookie smaller, using a melon baller, baked for 8 minutes and used pre-made cream cheese frosting. Everyone loved them. They were the first thing gone.

These were a big hit everybody LOVED them. + they r really easy to make. Be warned once u eat one you'll keep going back for more that's how good they r. I did half w/ the icing center + half w/ marshmallow fluff center to change it up. Also try different cake mixes, like yellow or red velvet for a bit of variety (you may want to half the recipe to 6 servings it only calls for 1 cake mix instead of 2).

My kids love these they ask me to make them again and again. I don't mind at all because they are very easy to make and require little ingredients so even the clean-up is easy. As for adults, I would say just a tad too rich and sugary but still very good.

Yum, yum.  And super easy.  The dough has a pretty stiff yet pliable consistency.  The cookies come out very soft and hold together very well.  I have tried other recipes for this type of cookie, but the cookie always fell apart, but none of these cookies broke (by accident at least...:)).  Make sure to let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before removing them to the cooling racks.  I doubled the batch and it made a ton.  We had leftovers for 3 days, but no one complained.  I used a different cream cheese recipe that I found on this site titled "cream cheese frosting II."

These are really good! So easy to make. They talk a lot like Oreos only BETTER. Make sure not to overbake them though. They go from being a soft oreo to a crunch mess of crumbs on your shirt.

These were AWESOME.  I made them with buttercream frosting I already had and they were great!  I made these several times over the holidays with one cake mix and 1/2 of the other ingredients.  I'm going to try these with red velvet cake and white or chocolate frosting for Valentine's Day.  Maybe with a lemon cake mix for a birthday party.  Awesome recipe.

These cookies were great, by themselves or as a pair.  I used a different icing, part vanilla and part peanut butter mixed together that created a lovely combination.  People loved them and I will definitely make them again.

Minus the little bit of muscle it takes to stir the batter, these are the easiest cookies in the world to make!  Unbelievably versatile, a thousand combinations. Very rich - I'd stick with small versions of the quick-baking cookie.  Great!

Took it to office bake sale, overheard them being described as "sinful". Enough said! I would make them smaller next time, but otherwise they were wonderful.

I gave this a 3 because my guests really seemed to enjoy these.  I didn't care for them - I found them very bland and though the interior filling didn't quite go with the cookies.  However, they are pretty and look impressive.

These went over great at my nephew's h.s. graduation party. It was like a shark week feeding frenzy when I put them out. I found it easier to roll by hand (small/medium meatball size) and then press them slightly flat on the cookie sheet. This is also great to make ice cream sandwiches with. Thank you so much for the recipe! C:

I thought this was just ok. I did not find them to be anything special. I mixed them by hand because it was not possible to do with a spoon and baked them on a cookie sheet sprayed with pam. They came out great. I also changed the filling by adding 1/2 cup of butter along with the cream cheese. I think if I added some vanilla extract it would have been yummier. I just put them in the oven and hope they come out better tasting this way. They taste good and choclatey but it was just ok. Thank you!

I was looking for a recipe for whoopie pies; this came close, but definitely isn't whoopie pies. The cookies are more brownie-like. I put them in the freezer once they'd been made and they're really delicious. I only baked mine for about 7 mins cuz I like mine chewy. Super easy and delicious.

Like another reviewer I ended up mixing the dough with my hands because of the thickness of the dough.   These are delicious and easy to make.  Next time I might make them a little smaller because they are rich.

Wonderful!!  The mixture was a little hard to stir so I had to add a little bit of water other than that PERFECT!

I was skeptical with this recipe but I am SO glad I went through with trying it! These were SO delicious. If you want more filling between the cookies I would suggest doubling the filling recipe because the two cake mixes provide lots of cookies but you are limited on the filling. These are even better the next day. Extra moist and chewy. Yum!!

The 1st time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly, the second time, I subbed the oil with 1 stick softened butter. I like them better with the butter, they seem softer somehow?!  I use home-made marshmallow cream (on one side) for the filling and spread Nutella, on the other side...Yummmmmeeeee....goes great w/ milk or coffee for a late nite dessert!

Mmmmmmmmm....I made these with chocolate mix and then with strawberry cake mix. Both were eaten up quick. These are pretty sweet so I would suggest making them smaller or cutting back on the powdered sugar. I am going to try this with white cake and with carrot cake this weekend...and I am really looking forward to them.

It's weird, I thought this would make more, but I guess not.  Instead of 2 cups of powdered sugar I just put in one, I didn't want it super sweet. Good recipe over all though!

This was my first time making cookies from cake mix. I am not much of a fan apparently but the boys in my family loved them so I rated them with 3 stars instead of the 2 I would have given this recipe. The cookie had a gritty texture from the cake mix. They were so soft they seemed unbaked. I would call these snack cakes not cookies. Sort of like the cheap little Debbie things you can buy at the store. I added peanut butter to the filling and it was super yummy. These are a cool treat to pack in the kids lunches. If you like snack cakes make this reipe.

I got so many compliments on this recipe - everyone just loved them. I think next time I'll make them smaller - mini versions because they're rather filling. I didn't have to alter the recipe at all, went exactly as written and they were absolutely delicious. Better than a moon pie that I had gotten at a sweet shop a few months ago by far!

I love this recipe. Everyone who tried these cookies loved them. For the cake mixes I used German Chocolate and Milk Chocolate. And I had to double the frosting. I will make these again and experiment with different cake mixes. A must for everyone's recipe collection.

These didn't do it for me. I used two boxes of german chocolate cake and per the advice of others trimmed down the powdered suger to about 1 1/2 cups. I thought these lacked taste and there wasn't enough cream cheese frosting. My husband really like them so I will probably experiment with different cake flavors to see if that makes a difference.

These were pretty good for some easy chocolate cookies, but the texture and flavor was pretty much the same as boxed brownies.  I couldn't really taste the cream cheese in them so I would definitely suggest adding more.

I have made these cookies twice now, and they were a big hit both times.  My 5 year old is able to help out and he loves that I don't have to get the big mixer out to mix the cookie dough.  Tastes good even after freezing.  Thanks for this!

Yummy. Yummy, Yummy. Made these cookies on a whim one night and they are our new favorites. Made 1/2 batch according to recipe Then added crushed candy canes the cream cheese mixture for the second 1/2. Too Good.
