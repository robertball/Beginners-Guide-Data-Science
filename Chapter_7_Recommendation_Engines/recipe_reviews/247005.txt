The filling was WAY too sweet & I had a ton leftover.  The cookies were really good & the recipe is simple.

Made exactly as recipe called for & they turned out so good. Much better after they were in the fridge overnight!

These were delicious. Not overly sweet which was delicious with the sweet frosting. I made them gluten free with Bobâ€™s red mill 1 to 1 flour.
