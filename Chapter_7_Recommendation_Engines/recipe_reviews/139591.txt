I wanted an iced coffee so what I did was brew the coffee, then cool it in the fridge. I then threw everything in the blender and let it go for about a minute, then poured it over ice. I did use Truvia instead of Splenda, that was the only change I made. Not bad. Next time I'd add more milk but with a recipe like this, it's easily bendable to your own tastes.

No flavor.  It tastes like a slightly sweet (and I mean slightly) warm cup of water.

I'm pretty basic when it comes to coffee, generally preferring just a regular old cup o' joe.  But I liked this!  It won't replace my traditional favorite, but it was fun and interesting to try for a cup after supper.  I also normally stay away from drinks like this when Hubs and I travel, as I'm very aware of how high in calories they can be.  I appreciated that this called for Splenda and unsweetened cocoa, so I enjoyed this without guilt.

I do not like chocolate but made this for my husband. I made the coffee a little stronger than usual. Although this isn't something he would want every day, it is a nice treat from time to time. Thanks!

I am partial to the Mocha recipe on here. I thought I would give another one a try. This just didn't work for me. It tasted like a cup of bland hot chocolate with some coffee dumped in it. The mocha recipe is made with mainly milk and is creamy. Maybe, subtituting milk and adding vanilla or something similar may have made it as equally as flavorful of a Mocha.

This was ok. The cocoa powder was the dominant flavor. I couldn't taste the coffee, Splenda, or milk.

I used a bold keurig coffee pod, and added about a tsp of international delight brand "hot for cookie"flavored cream with also half and half instead of milk. Still not too sweet! It's good!! Really reminiscent of Starbucks mocha!! Mmmm oh ya, went awesome with Chocolate and Almond Biscotti from this site too!!:)

The 2 tablespoons of milk wasn't enough for me, so I then added some International Delight Cinnabon flavored creamer. Oh my! A delicious afternoon pick-me-up!
