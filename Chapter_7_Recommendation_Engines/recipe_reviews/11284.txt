I made these for the daughter of my best friend and I was surprised how good they were.  Delicious and a very nice looking cookie as well.  I did make changes.  I omitted the milk and rum extract and instead used 2 Tablespoons of strong Jamaican rum and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  This made the rum flavor more pronounced and I was very pleased.

The flavor is great with this recipe, but because it begins with a cake mix, the end result has a consistancy of cake, not a cookie.  I had to give it only three stars because it doesn't have any cookie crunch.

very moist/cakey texture (which is how I like my cookies!)  I used spiced rum and the mix of pineapple/coconut/rum was great!

Unique cookie.  At first I thought they were just ok.  I don't think they are too sweet, but it does mostly taste like pineapple.  After these cookies sat in a tin for a week with other cookies, when we opened it my son, husband, and I grabbed out a pina colada cookie over all the others, so we must have liked them alot.

While the taste is good, it really is not low carb.  When there's 9 gms of carb in 1 cookie, that is too much to be considered low carb imo.  I agree that it is more cake like than cookie.

Delicious! I love coconut so I added a TSP of coconut flavoring. The texture is really unique because of the cake mix; crunchy on the edges, more cake-like in the center. Really good! I also drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over the top once they'd cooled just to make 'em a little prettier. These are always a hit at parties!

4.16.19  These really are more like mini cakes rather than cookies, but there’s nothing wrong with that.  I could only find one pineapple cake mix (Pillsbury®) at the store, and it weighed only 15.25 oz, so I did add 3 oz of King Arthur® cake flour to bring it up to the 18.25 oz in the recipe.  Instead of cutting the butter into the dry cake mix, I just put it in the food processor, then transferred to a bowl, and completed the recipe.  I followed suit with another reviewer and did add 1 tsp of coconut extract and would do that again.   Not knowing how these would bake up but knowing that I didn’t want really small cookies, I used a tablespoon cookie scoop instead of a teaspoon and ended up with 36 cookies.  Since the cookies were larger,  they did take more time to bake.  They really didn’t spread out very much, so you can place them fairly close to each other on the baking sheet.  Super easy,  we liked them, so I’d make this one again.
