This has to be one of my favorite soups on the site! I am a huge potato soup lover and look for ways to incorporate more veggies into what I am eating. I used to hate cauliflower until I realized the versatile ways you can liven it up. The fact that cauliflower can take on a flavor reminiscent of potatoes makes me never look back on eating just potato soup again. If you like "loaded baked potato" soup, I highly recommend giving this alternative a try! For a little bit lighter option, you can lessen the amount of heavy cream.

This is seriously delicious soup. What makes it so good is the gremolata, especially the lemon zest. I made a half-recipe but added a whole onion and a whole rib of celery, as well as 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of half broth and half water, I added a whole carton of low sodium chicken broth and a bit of vegetable broth I had in the fridge. I didn't have any parsley but thought it tasted fine without it. I might add fresh dill next time. Thanks for the recipe!

If you make the soup, you must also make the topping! I didn't have parmigiano on hand, so I threw in some blue cheese crumbles instead. Do yourself a favor and try it with the blue cheese!

Sorry Chef John--you are my favorite chef and this soup sounded and looked awesome but unlike many of your other recipes this one did not deliver. Company was polite but no one was able to finish it. Compared to your homemade make your own stock, chicken noodle soup which is my favorite this soup would not even place any were near it.

Chef John has done it again! This recipe is so easy and fast.  Perfect for a cold winter night.  I added 3 cloves of garlic just to give it a little extra kick.  I plan on using the same basic method soon but adding broccoli instead of cauliflower.

This is a very good soup.  But you absolutely must make the gremolata to go with it.  Without the gremolata, it is rather bland, and I am thinking that most of unfavorable reviews resulted because people did not make the garnish.  You won't be sorry--take that little bit of time and make it!

This soup is delicious!! They only change I made was tossing the cauliflower in 1 tablespoon of olive oil and roasted it in 425 degree oven for 35 min. Did everything else per recipe.

This is the best  cauliflower soup I have ever tasted! I followed the instructions carefully, which I always do when I make something for the first time. Then the next time, I adjust a recipe to my taste. But this soup won't need any changes, it's perfect as-is!
My taste buds were surprised how delicious the lemon zest combined with the soup, the freshness of the zest and parsley combined with the heat of the cayenne....  amazing!

This soup had very good flavor and body! The things I did differently were that I used 2 peeled, red potatoes because I didn't have russets, I used more celery then called for and whole milk instead of heavy cream, I used dried parsley that I added to the soup after it was finished  cooking instead of fresh and I used Better Then Bouillon-Chicken with 8 Cups of water instead of chicken stock and I left out the pepper... I prefer to add that at the table since not everyone in my family can eat pepper.  I'm REALLY excited that it  is so delicious and fairly easy to make!

Yum!  This is a wonderful creamy soup and the Bacon Gemolata is a must.  I made it exactly as written and I sauteed some Mushrooms to go on top (see my pic!).  It was most fabulous!  :-)

This soup had nice flavor.  I will next time only puree half the soup and leave a few chunks in it for texture.  I also loved the gremolata, but didn't care for the texture of the tiny breadcrumbs.  It kind of made me feel like I was eating grit, if that makes sense.  So next time I will make chunkier bread crumb cubes with a little more bacon.  I think with those modifications this would be a 5 star recipe for me.  As always, thanks for your great recipes!

I got everything out to make this and realized I didn't have a single onion. Time constrained so I went with onion powder and to fill in I added some chopped yellow squash. Used only 1 cauli and 4 cups water with BTB chicken base, but full amts of everything else .  Used turkey bacon which I chopped  in mini chopper after frying with a little evoo. Used panko (only 1/2 cup) for the bread crumbs and only a splash  of half and half at the end. The base was good, much better than I though it might be.  The gremolata pushed it over the edge.

First, Chef John, you're the best.  I love your sense of humor when it comes to cooking, it makes me more relaxed.  Of course, that's a double-edged sword, as I discovered with this recipe.

So I completely misread the directions and couldn't figure out where the quart of water went.  Worse than that I thought, "Why dirty another pan?", and cooked the bacon in the same pan as the onions, celery, garlic, and cauliflower. 

So my Gremolata is sans bacon. Sigh.  I think I"m going to give the rest of it a go using olive oil and all the other ingredients, but for us less enlighted recipe readers, can you please clearly separate the soup from the ah, garnish? 

I have to say that adding the bacon to the soup is not a terrible idea except for my vegetarian friends and that the results are seriously delicious. This is going into my soup rotation.

This was SOOO good!  The gremolata is key in this recipe otherwise it's a bit ho-hum.  Also, I made this for just my husband and myself.  It makes a LOT, so next time I'll half the recipe.

I just used more garlic since I hate onion, and kept out the cayenne since I don't do spicy.  The gremolata is what makes this soup extraordinary!  You get that saltiness of the bacon with the hint of lemon, and it goes so well with the creamy soup!

1st so easy to prep and make, no excuses to not do this recipe. Added extra an potato and cooked both a potato and part of the cauliflower aside to be diced and added for texture. Used few day old sourdough bread I made for the gremolata and thick bacon. Going to savour this bowl.

I didn't have celery (gasp!), so used celery salt.  Nothing to compare it to, so I don't know the impact, but it is delicious, and it was very easy to make.

This was delicious! I used half and half instead of cream. And rye bread in the bacon gremolata. Perfect on a cold night with Mac and cheese on the side.

Soup was very good and the gremolata was the only thing that added some taste to an otherwise plain soup. I personally like a little more flavor in my soups. I added a little "Garlic Hot Sauce" to just give it a little zing.

I made this without the Bacon Gremalata. Two things I changed in the recipe: Instead of the Olive Oil I used  Bacon Fat and instead of Heavy Cream I used Half and Half.  Tasted delicious.

Absolutely divine! Great satisfying meal for not only a rainy day. Also finishing sprinkle of smoked paprika makes it perfection.

this was no9t a "hit" with m6y family --- maybe try roasted the cauliflower with more garlic next time for flavor.

This was extremely bland.  After adding shredded parmesan and chicken bouillon it tasted pretty good.

The soup was Wonderful! But I threw out the extra bacon grease and just made the bacon gremolata as a dry mix with the Parm, the crushed bacon, and crushed fat-free croutons. This sprinkled on top was great! I have to save the calories where I can.  I will definitly make this again!
