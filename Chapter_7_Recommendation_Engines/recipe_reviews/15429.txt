This pie was very tasty.  I love to cook so I had to change a few things since some prior reviewers found it bland.  I spiced my beef with salt and pepper before browing it in the lard. Also I brown the veggies a little in the left over lard to give them more flavor. As a final addition I deglazed the pan I used to brown the beef and vegetables with the ale and water mixture and spiced it with a little montreal steak seasoning to give the sauce some extra punch.

My husband loved this recipe.  I used Guiness Draft instead of the ale and I added 1 pkg dry mushroom gravy and 1 tsp worchestershire sauce.  It had a good flavor.

I was very impressed with the results of this recipe! Absolutely delicious! Thanks Pie Man! I boiled the diced potatoes, turnips and carrots before I baked the pie to ensure that they would be soft. It came out perfect.

Mmmmm - never before have I tasted such
a tasty pie.  I sure was glad that
Mary-Beth took the time to bake such a treat
that all generations can enjoy.  I now 
have another foodstuff to make me more
obese, like all good American's, and
the extra protein will help my mullet
growth - thank you Kevin Miller, or 
should I say 'pie-man'.

I usually chose my recipes and cook with my family in mind, but this time I made this recipe just for me (I had a craving for beef stew meat). I browned my meat in butter and olive oil rather than lard, parboiled the vegetables in beef stock before adding them to my "stew", and baked up a container of refrigerated sourdough biscuits. I add garlic to just about everything, and so I added some chopped garlic to this; I also added a couple of cilantro leaves and some dried thyme. I did not bake it as a pie, but rather served myself the prepared meat/vegetable mixture/gravy mixture with 2 of my biscuits (which I buttered) on the side. TOTALLY DELICIOUS. A phenominal COMFORT 
FOOD experience; an absolutely "guilty pleasure" that I will definitely make again (and keep to myself).

This pie was indeed VERY tasty. I made it for my boyfriend and i as he is always talking about steak and ale pie. i substituted the turnip with gently fried mushrooms and boiled all the fresh vegetables before baking so that they were as soft as possible. However, when i was making the ale/water for the juice, it just wouldnt thicken, i had to end up adding  some gravy granules to thicken it. This was the only "problem" i came across and all in all this was probably the tastiest steak and ale pie ive ever had. Regards to the pie man =)

My English husband loved this, we used puff pastry from the freezer, skipped the turnip and did sliced mushrooms. Also, used the worchestershire sauce and diced curly parsley with brown gravy baked for 1 hr. after having an egg comb over the puff pastry. Fantastic....thank you pie man.

This pie as is is ok.  I think if you used beef broth instead of water to give it more flavor it would be better.  The gravy needs to be a bit thicker, too.  I might also add a dash of garlic and spices to the broth before I make it into gravy.

This tasted great and my parents raved about how good it was, but I found it bland compared to the pies I've had in the UK and the one I made from some British website. If you're making something as delicious and luxurious as a steak and ale pie, it's worth it to find a recipe that has mushrooms and uses a flour roux instead of cornstarch. (If you do follow this recipe, I couldn't get it to thicken until I put in several more cornstarch slurries. When it's had enough it'll start to thicken as soon as it boils.) I couldn't exactly taste the cornstarch but it left little angular globs on my plate that looked like they would be more at home on some General Tso's chicken. I didn't mind, but with a roux you'd sneak some delicious butter in there and get a chance to use the maillard reaction. However you make it, peas on the side are a must!

This recipe was pretty good, although the "gravy" was more like broth. I couldn't get it to thicken no matter what I did. Came out more like stew. Might try it again though and see if it was just an isolated thing.

Overall, this recipe sounds good in concept but the bitter ale did not give it enough flavor.  In the future I'd say add some seasonings, especially salt.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and my son and my English boyfriend loved it as did I. There were a couple of changes: no turnips, no ale, and I used oil instead of lard. (Didn't have these ingredients is why.) I also made three smaller pies using small corningware baking ramekins, and I used OXO beef bouillion cubes as the ale substitute with water and cornstarch. They were amazingly good, thanks so much for sharing this recipe! Next time I will try it as written, I've been looking for a good beef pie to make for the boyfriend who misses having them in England.

Oh so bland! This recipe as written has very little flavour. I used Guinness instead of ale and have also tried cooking the meat and vegetables in beef stock  first to try and improve the flavour. I love meat pies but this is just not a great pie recipe. Sorry!

I've done this twice. Once as written and once with changes. Both times, I used Guinness and no turnips. As written, I think this recipe is probably a 3-star at best. I had difficulty getting the "gravy" to thicken, the potatoes and carrots weren't all cooked through even after over an hour in the oven and it ended up much more like a broth. It was also kind of bland. Here are the changes I made, I cooked the vegetables and onions in about a cup and a half of beef broth until they were soft and then scooped them out with a slotted spoon. I used the reserved liquid in place of the water for the ale mixture and added both a gravy packet and a packet of my go-to garlic and herb dry soup mix. I made sure the gravy was thick before spooning it over the beef and veggies. Done this way, this recipe was EXCELLENT, 5-star definitely and one my picky-eater husband has requested again. So it averages out to a 4-star...not exceptional as written but pretty easy to adjust to your own taste/family.

Fairly easy to make; common ingredients; cleanup is minimal; about 75 minutes from start to finish, including cooking.  The cornstarch didn't work for me as a thickening agent. Will try flour next time.  Increase veggies by about 1/4 to fill a 9" pie plate and parboil them beforehand to ensure they're really done at the end of 45-50 minutes in the oven.  I'm thinking you could also top it with biscuits like a turkey or chicken pot pie, instead of the puff pastry.  Otherwise, very tasty with just salt and pepper.

This is a good recipe for a classic 'footie' food.  Add a little more beef, cut back slightly on some of the veggies and add some more corn starch to the sauce and this becomes a perfect main course.

This pie turned out picture perfect. It looked delicious, and my DH and I could hardly wait to dig in. However, it looked far more tasty than it actually was.  had added beef boullion to the water for more flavor. Even this did no good. It literally had no flavor at all.   will not make this ever again.

I made a number of changes to this recipe... The biggest being that I used tofu instead of steak and made my own crust. It turned out great though, I really like the addition off the ale for the gravy.

I had such high hopes for this recipe - but found the pie to be unimaginative and boring at best.  Husband and kids ate it, but only because they were hungry, their only comment was "good try - better luck next time".

I would probably cook it without the pastry for a bit so that the meat gets really tender. Then put it in as long as the recipe calls for to get the pastry done. Also probably use a stout next time.

I'd recommend cooking the veggies half way before cooking the pie. Also needs some extra spice to take it up a bit.

Make sure you boil the carrots, potatoes and onions in a spiced up beef broth or they will not be cooked thru.  Use the beef broth instead of water in the 2 places it calls for water.  We added mushroom and not the turnips. If you want a thicker sauce add a dry packet of beef gravy mix, cooked to package directions.  I know this is a lot of changes, but for us they were necessary.  We have since made this with pork cubes and chicken cubes, using 3/4 lbs.

The only difference I made was a little (not a whole) stock cube to the water. Beyond tasty!
