Really like this easy, quick recipe. I did opted out of the pinto beans and used black beans instead. Additionally, I made my own taco seasoning from an allrecipe.com recipe. I also used a sweet onion, which gave it a sweet and spicy taste. Will do again :)

These were excellent as written. No changes needed. I served these as a side dish to my meat as I am not vegan. The flavors all combine nicely and this was super simple. I plan on trying this with corn tortillas next time due to personal preference but that is the only thing I would change. Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!
