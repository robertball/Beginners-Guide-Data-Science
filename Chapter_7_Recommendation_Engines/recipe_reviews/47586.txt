I made this last night and it was deliciously different. The ham seemed an unusual ingredient (besides the cola of course), but the two together gave it a bacon-y flavor. Excellent! I agree that it needed to be thickened a bit, even after letting it reduce down, so I added a flour/water slurry and it was perfect. Served it over egg noodles, but over rice would probably be even better. Actually, we loved the sauce so much, I'd double it the next time. Make certain you pound the chicken like the recipe states...it makes them so much more tender. This one I'll make again!

Well, we like the chicken but the "gravy" didn't go over so well.  First, it was a little watery for our taste and secondly, it had too much of a "winey" flavor. I even used a little more sour cream to thicken the sauce and reduce the wine taste but the kids passed and the adults found it edible but were not thrilled.  Maybe something other than sherry? The idea sounds good but I'm not sure what I could substitute to make it worthwhile making again. Thanks anyways!

This was an excellent recipe!  I was a little skeptical at first, but the chicken was very tender and the sauce was delicious.  It was a little hard to tell when the sauce had reduced by half, so that may be the reason that the sherry could come across a little strong.

Sauce was good up to the point of adding the sour cream.  I didn't like the flavor the sour cream made.  Family loved it though.

My husband and I loved this recipe! He said it was the best chicken he had ever had. I thought it was really simple to make since I am not the best cook. The only thing I would suggest is to double the sauce portion of the recipe, you will want to have extra of this great stuff!!

This really turned out great! I did add some chopped onions to the chicken for an extra kick. And I think that next time I will add some corn starch to the sauce to thicken. It was wnderful served over egg noodles. Kids and Hubby loved it!

Served this on top of mashed potatoes!  My husband said this is something I could make "regularly".

Lunchbag letdown! Love chicken, love ham, LOVE Coca-Cola--and yet, pumped as I was about the concept, neither of us could finish the actual dish.  We found it too sweet and just...well, odd tasting. Adding onions (as suggested in another review) might have helped but I don't think I'll bother with it again.

My family loved this recipe! I did find I needed more than the 1 tablespoon of butter to cook the chicken breasts. My husband, who hates mushrooms, loved it anyhow, the overall flavor was amazing!

My family didn't really care for this recipe.  It is very sweet first of all.  And the mushrooms take on a very strange taste.  Also, the recipe says to put the chicken back into the sauce after it is finished cooking, and we found that the chicken just got way too soggy.  Will not make again.

Everything that came out of this sauce tasted delicious, I didn't cook the sauce down long enough so it was a bit thin. I will definitely be making this again.

This was so different tasting and easy to make. I added about a TBS of olive oil in addition to the butter and sliced the ham in strips.  Next time I'll use either diced or chunky diced ham that you can buy packaged in the supermarket because the strips sort of disappeared into the sauce and the ham is such a nice touch. I love mushrooms so added more from the packaged already sliced mushrooms.  One other thing I did was to add the leftover bread crumb mixture (from the bag I breaded the chicken in) to the sauce when I added the ham, etc. that ultimately required that I add the rest of the can of cola as well. This was made in my long, oval electric frying pan. This recipe will definitely be in my "chicken" rotation. Had the leftovers for lunch the next day. Even more delicious on day two.  Great recipe Benjamin.  Thanks

I did 3 things differently, but only changed one ingredient, because it was what I had on hand. I used flour instead of bread crumbs, I fried the chicken longer, and finished it off in the oven. Reading that the sauce didn't thicken, I added 2 TBS of flour to the sour cream . The sauce thickened right up. I never added the chicken back into the sauce to keep it crisp, I simply plated the meat and topped with the sauce. The Chicken was perfect, tender juicy and full of flavor, the sauce is just to sweet for my family's taste. Not a bad sauce at all , and it looks impressive on the plate, just too sweet for us.

THis dish was excellent; very unusual but even my fussy hubby liked it. A combination of flavors I would never have believed would work together but they did!
