Yummy!!  I used halibut steaks (3 steaks about 1.75 lbs total) and marinated them for a couple of hours.  I changed the marinade just a little - first of all I doubled it, and I used olive oil instead of butter.  I also used honey instead of brown sugar and added a couple of extra garlic cloves.  I used the garlic press instead of a knife for the garlic because I like the way pressed garlic works in a marinade.  I grilled my halibut on a stovetop grill, 5 minutes on the first side and 4 on the second, and I boiled the leftover marinade to drizzle over the fish on the plate.  We loved it and I will make it again.  I'll probably use this marinade on a slightly less expensive fish - here in NY the halibut cost $15.99 lb, so, it was a bit pricey.  But what a gorgeous fish steak!  Thanks.

Tried this recipe for the first time last night and I must say it was fantastic!  I marinated the Halibut for several hours before grilling.  I think the butter flavor is essential so rather than substituting oil for butter I just melted the butter and allowed it to sit in the marinade before adding the Halibut.  Of course it thickened up again, but once the Halibut was on the grill, it just melted into the fish.  My whole family enjoyed this recipe.  Thank you!

How could I go wrong making this dish after all the excellent reviews?  It was delicious!  I marinated the halibut for about 4 hours, then baked it at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes.  It was awesome!  I also doubed the sauce for extra marinade and dipping sauce.  I can't wait to try the fish/marinade on the grill this Spring and Summer.

Absolutely fantastic!  I used this on Halibut and Mahi Mahi and the crowd went wild.  60-90 minutes to marinate in an 8 x 8 glass pan, then onto the grill.  This is definately a keeper.

GREAT recipe, great marinade. I used this with Tilapia, and it was fantastic, and so easy! I will definitely use this again with other fish, chicken, pork and it would be great on grilled veggies. I, too, doubled the marinade, and it was more than enough. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this one...although I did substitute the brown sugar for pure maple syrup (which I always do) and I grilled it on the BBQ on a bed of lemons cut about 1/4 inch. Great recpe. 
Thanks!

Delicious!  Not as sweet as I'd expected (but that was a good thing).  Even less sweet than teriaki sauce.  I broiled them in the oven and kept basting with the sauce.  Other than broiling instead of BBQing, I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great as-is.  I served with rice and broccoli stir-fried with oyster sauce & soy sauce.

This is one of my all time favorite seafood BBQ recipes. I use Swordfish, cut slits into the tops and marinate them in some of the sauce for about 1/2 hour before grilling (not in the fridge though, the sauce will gel). I make extra sauce for dipping. I made two fish steaks the other day for DH and me and my 3 year old granddaughter arrived and ate my WHOLE piece of fish . I serve this with sauteed zucchini & onions and spiced couscous..Yummm

This was really good, the flavor was excellent!  I didn't have butter so I used 2 Tbsp of olive oil which was a bit much, I would only use 1 Tbsp next time.  I also ran out of propane on the BBQ, so just baked it in the oven and it turned out great.  I basted the fish with the sauce when I put it in the oven and again halfway through.  I can't wait to try making it with butter, because everything is better with butter!

We've been using this recipe for several years now.  It is THE best marinade/topping for halibut.  In fact, it made me a halibut believer - this was no small feat, as I was not a dedicated fish lover.  We don't marinate them for a long time, just whip it up and baste the halibut, albeit generously.  We only use this recipe on the barbecue.  Delicious!!

This was good but I think when I make again I will cut down on the lemon or simply serve it on the side.  I also feel the fish needs to be marinated for at least 45 minutes coupled with doubling the sauce to have enough to boil and serve as a dipping sauce.

Very unusual flavor.  It was edible, but not exactly enjoyable.  My boyfriend thought it tasted like sweet and sour fish.  I followed the recipe closely, only variation was to marinate the fish in the sauce for appx. 15 min.  Won't make again, sorry

Have made this several times.  I don't marinate the fish as some have, but just brushed the sauce on the halibut as it was being grilled. Great recipe and didn't overpower the fish.  Would use on other types of fish as well.

Super yummy! This was my first time preparing halibut, and it worked great! I doubled the sauce and used 2 halibut steaks. I would suggest poking holes in the fish and marinating in the sauce for about an hour before grilling. I then prepared another batch of the sauce to use for dipping the grilled halibut in after...which I would highly recommend! Thanks for the recipe.

This marinade/sauce has an excellent flavor.  I actually enjoy baking this recipe--especially in the winter when we cannot grill.  Try about 350 degrees for 35 minutes or until fish is flaky.

I made this with tilapia and it turned out great.  I followed previous recommendations and doubled the sauce - used half as a marinade for a few hours, and then while grilling the tilapia (on foil to prevent sticking/falling through) I reduced the other half of the sauce to use as a dipping sauce.  Served with grilled vegetables, a tasty and pretty healthy meal.

Really easy and tasted great.  Used tamari instead of regular soy, and added some of the zest from the lemon.

Saved the marinade and boiled it and reduced it to make a great sauce for the fish!

Made this tonight as written and let me say it was fantastic!  I loved the crunch bit where the grill marks were.  Will make again and may marinade for a bit before hand to get the flavors throughout,especially with the thick halibut we had.
Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous! I had no halibut left, and there were only two people that were eating fish! I brushed the sauce on the halibut before and throughout cooking. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This was wonderful! I used Cod instead of Halibut. I made one batch of the sauce, sub olive oil for butter, to marinate the fish in for two hours. Then I made another batch of the sauce using the butter, letting it thicken to a glaze like consistency. Served the fish over a pile of fried rice and poured the sauce over the top. Served stir-fried veggies on the side. DELICIOUS!

A fine and simple recipe.  The combination of ingredients helps to properly “brand” the fish when cooked on a gas grill at medium heat.  I’ve made this several times and recently added a couple of tablespoons of horseradish sauce to the sauce for another variation.

We loved this!  I can see that marinating the fish for a while before would be beneficial, so I'll do that next time.  I did use a Costco halibut fillet rather than a steak, but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. It really wasn't as sweet as you'd think.  This will be a repeat!  Thanks!  It's exactly what we needed tonight!

This was amazing.  I only marinated the fish in it for 30-40 minutes or so, and basted during grilling like the recipe suggests.  The flavor was mild and sweet and tasted great with a  little bit of char from the grill.  I also liked that you could still mostly just taste the fish, but had a little of the marinade to make it something special.
Everyone thought it was fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was awesome!  I made for the first time tonight.  I dredged fish in flour and browned in skillet, basted with sauce on both sides then placed in 400 degree oven for 5-7 minutes. Served atop buttermilk mashed potatoes using Yukon golds and parmesan cheese. I drizzled remaining sauce over fish and around mashed potatoes.  Served green beans on the side.  I will definately make again!

I baked this in convection and covered by foil at 425 for ~30 minutes in addition to the rice dish I made.  My kiddos annihilated this and my 9-year-old took enthusiastic seconds.  I doubled the sauce to cover a Costco-sized cut of halibut.  Unlike other reviewers, I actually DON'T recommend marinating this, as it was pretty sweet and by baking it unmarinated the sauce complimented the natural fish flavor rather than overwhelming it.

This is great, and the easiest thing in the world to do! I followed the recipe as written. We loved the combination of flavors with the butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, lemon juice and garlic. I had two small filets of halibut, so I baked mine in the oven at 350 degrees for about 12 minutes. Served with sweet and spicy green beans (from this site). My husband wouldn't stop raving about how good this turned out. I'm eager to try it on the grill next time. Thanks for such a flavorful, fast and easy recipe.

I mixed up the ingredients into a paste vs. put on the stove to melt and spread it on the fish then cooked it on a plank on my bbq.  Turned out great!

I followed other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce.  Marinated for about an hour, then cooked as directed, basting with remainging sauce. The end result was just"ok", I won't use this recipe again though.

This was very tasty and definetly a regular recipe in our weekly menu.  I did alter it a bit; I used Tilapia instead of Halibut and I also used Teriyaki Sauce instead of soy..I cooked it on a stovetop grill and there wasn't a crumb left!

This was so YUMMY!!  I used 1.5 lbs of snapper, so adjusted the ratio of ingredients accordingly.  I made a couple of changes, used sesame oil instead of butter, used lime juice instead of lemon (it's what I had on hand) and added 1 tsp of sesame seeds and 1 dried tobasco pepper (from our garden).  The dried pepper would probably equal about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flake.  As others suggested, I also made a 2nd batch of sauce, cooked on the stove top until it was a nice glaxze and drizzeled on the top of the fish after it was plated.  This was SOOO YUMMY!  My family was licking their plates (literally) and asking if there was more.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I've eaten a lot of halibut and this is hands down the best way!  My wife, who doesn't really like fish all that much, loved it.  Marinate the fish for about 10 minutes for more flavor.  The fish reminded me of really tender steak.  Awesome.

Yummy.  I used 1 tbsp. honey instead of 2 T. Brown sugar.  Otherwise I followed the recipe - did not have time to marinate and it still turned out great.  I like that it was not too sweet.  Very simple and the grilling made it taste even better.

I made this last night for me and my fiance.  We both loved it.  I used paiche which was on sale at Whole foods.  I made one little change to the glaze, I added about a tbsp of minced ginger.  We will definitely be having this again soon.

Wish I could give it 6 stars, and wish I had taken a photo of this dish, but my boys ate it before I could grab a camera! Easy quick prep and cook, perfect for any working wife just wanting to put a healthy meal out for her family. I might try a bit of marination, but otherwise would not change a thing! Totally disagree with the negative comment. Maybe she had bad halibut?

Has good potential, but need some tweaks.  I made this recipe exactly as stated, but the flavor was weak, and the flavor that WAS there was overly sweet (did not pack the brown sugar, btw).  Next time will try with double soy sauce to see if that helps cut the sweet and make it more savory.

I put all the ingredients (except fish of course) into a microwave safe dish and microwaved until butter melted. I stirred it up real well dumped in a zip loc bag along with my fish and let it marinate for a couple hours. I baked the fish in oven and it turned out great. I am not a big fan of fish but I really liked this. I used it on Ahi Tuna and Yellowfin. The fish was just in frozen section at the grocery store -- nothing fancy. I will also use this on chicken and pork.

OH, MY!  Why did it take me so long to try this recipe?  I bet I printed this off years ago, but never tried it until last night.  I did increase the sauce by half and set some aside for drizzling over the fish when serving.   I used tilapia, although I would have loved this with halibut as well.  This was sooooo easy, and sooooo delicious!!  My grill man grilled this perfectly!!  Guess I’ll keep him around, along with this recipe!!  Thank you!!

This tasted great.  We love halibut and are always looking for a new twist to cook it.  The flavors were just right.  You do need to make sure the grill is sprayed so the fish won't stick to it.

WOW!!!  This is by far some of the best fish I have ever made and I cook a lot of fish!  I used Cod on this recipe.  I have a skillet that has holes all over it that is made for the grill and that is what I used.  I marinated it for about an hour then made another batch of the sauce and basted during grilling.  My hubby said that this is by far his favorite fish recipe.  I think it would be really good with shrimp as well....I will try that next. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!! ***UPDATE** I JUST REVIEWED THIS LAST NIGHT. MY HUBBY AND I LOVED THIS SO MUCH WE DID IT WITH SHRIMP TODAY AND IT WAS FAB.!!!  I WILL USE THIS SAUCE OFTEN ON LOTS OF SEAFOOD

This was amazingly delicious and easy to make. I made this recipe with cod one day and then with salmon a few days later and served both with rice pilaf and broccoli. I doubled the sauce recipe so that I could drizzle  it over the fish and broccoli. I baked the fish in the oven at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes for 1.4 lbs of cod and 1 lb of salmon. This sauce is like crack...I'm putting it on everything! I love the way the sauce tastes with rice pilaf. This recipe will definitely show up regularly on our table. Thanks!

This recipe has become a standard in our house, as we are fortunate to be able to get fresh halibut year around - it is easy to prepare, and the resulting dish is delicious. Make just as written. Thanks for the recipe, Duane.

Fabulous! Works with any kind of fish.  The basting method works well, as does marinating for a hour or so. All 4 kids love it, even the one who 'doesn't eat fish'!

This dish was a winner at our house!  My husband is not a fan of fish, and my kids never like the same things, but this marinated halibut made every one happy at dinner last night!  I used olive oil in place of the butter, and doubled the recipe for 1.5 lbs of fish...which was all gone by the end of dinner!  Success!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I was feeding six people, so I had two pounds of fish.  I made a double batch of the sauce and marinated the fish four about five hours before cooking it on the grill.  I also made another double batch of the sauce for dipping.  Everyone wants the recipe.

This was exactly as delicious as everyone has been claiming!  Fantastic!  I marinated the halibut for about an hour before grilling.  Excellent!

This was an excellent recipe.  I thought that it was just going to taste like plain old honey garlic sauce, but it didn't.  The barbeque really added great flavor.  I doubled the sauce, but didn't enjoy dipping.  I used quite a bit of sauce to baste the fish while cooking and I felt that the extra sauce took away from the tase of the fish.  I would definetly would make this again.

Okay, I have to admit, I was skeptical.  Brown sugar and fish?  But believe me, it works.  Got my anti-fish little girl to chow down on halibut!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very good recipe. I was a little doubtful at first, but it surprisingly satisfied myself and the wife. Did'nt have halibut though, so I used tuna steak. Definetely make extra marinade and use it for dipping when eating.

This was very good.  My husband and I both liked it.  As suggested by others I doubled the marinade and would highly recommend it.  In fact next time I may triple to have enough to drizzle on after putting it on the plate.

I thought it smelled great while it cooked yet for some reason the sauce didn't soak into the fish enough so next time I will make slices in the halibut steak. Overall it was great and I would make this again.

This was delicious! I did marinate it for about 2.5 hr - not sure if that made and difference or not - and basted while on the BBQ. Best halibut I have made.

This was the first time we had halibut.  We're hoping to take a fishing trip in Alaska; so thought we'd try the fish first.  The halibut is amazing.  This recipe is amazing.  Looking forward to a future trip.

I used the baste, as prescribed,  on grilled halibut fillets.  The flavor was outstanding and the fish melted in our mouths.  We enjoyed it so much, it may be on the menu again tonight.

Very tasty.  I left it on the grill an extra 2 1/2 min each side as my Haibut was 1 1/2 lbs.  Looked like a lot of fish, but 3 people ate every little bit.

My neighbor caught a 100 pound halibut in Puget Sound (WA) last weekend and gave me a four pound steak the same day.  I cut it into fillets and grilled half of it immediately using this recipe.  Absolutely outstanding.  I had never cooked fish on a grill without cedar planks and could not beleive how great it turned out.  Everyone raved.  I am cooking the rest today, but I am doubling the recipe for dipping sauce.

It was... ok. Granted it was not sweet and that was a good thing, but ... not enough punch or zest to the Halibut.  Halibut is a very meaty fish and this really needs something more.  Next time perhaps add a bit of Balsamic Vinegar.. and... hmmmm dunno.. will try again in a few weeks and let you know!  Cheers and ... "Keep yer stick on the ice".

great recipe!  This prepares really easily and I added a twist.  My wife and I like things spicier so I omitted the black pepper and added crushed red pepper instead.  Depending on how spicy you like it, let the sauce simmer for longer to pull more spice out.  We also subbed Tilapia for Halibut.  Good but had a fishier taste than the halibut would have.

I must have done something wrong because neither my husband or I liked these. I thought the sauce was boring and the fish was odd. I usually like white fish, first time I tried Halibut and not sure what I did wrong. I grilled it and basted and just wasn't happy with it. I didn't even finish eating it.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe to the tee and even added some sea scallops and jumbo shrimp and landed up having to marinate it overnight because something came up that night and cooked them the next day on a small grill used for grilling on a gas grill and the fish, scallops and shrimp came out with the most perfect flavor. This goes with anything even cole slaw.

First of all I hate fish, but when my husbands aunt from Alaska brought home 20 lbs of Halibut I had to man up and eat it.  My husband found this recipe and I have to say, it was the best fish I've ever had!  I actually enjoyed it, and would love to have it again.  I also have used this mariande one chicken and beef kabobs.  Two thumbs WAY UP

I made this last night exactly as the recipe states, and it turned out amazing.  I wasn't sure if it would be too sweet, but all the flavors blend well together.  I did reserve some of the sauce aside to pour over the top after the fish had cooked.  I will make this again and again.

We followed this recipe as written and it was incredible!  We just bought Alaskan Halibut fresh today, grilled on the Traeger grill with a light coating and did NOT marinade it.  If you have to freeze your halibut (or bought it frozen), you might consider marinading it, but definitely not necessary with fresh.  Light, sweet and tangy while allowing the fish to shine through.  This will be a staple in our home now.

The sauce gave this mild-tasting fish a nice flavor.  And it's not too sweet (even my bf, who only likes spicy, loved this dish).  I marinated the fish for an hour, and then dumped it all into a baking dish and baked for 40 min at 350 (didn't feel like messing with the grill).  Excellent recipe.

Since it's in the high 70s this december in florida, I decided to take advantage of my grill while I can. I used this fantastic marinade to go with grouper and added some fresh herbs and let it sit for an hour before popping on the grill. Served with grilled beets and leeks, it was fantastic!!

This recipe was given to me by a friend who also gave us some halibut caught in Alaska.  It is amazing!  We like it so much that we use it on mahi, tuna and filet mignons.  We always make extra for dipping.  Try this, you will be surprised at how good the taste is from so few ingredients! We do not change anything about the recipe.

Baked it as per other reviewers since I don't own a BBQ. Let the fish sit in the marinade for 4hrs or so - the flavour penetrated well into the flesh. Added some mushrooms to the mix as well! Served with rice, it made a nice, light dinner - simple to make and healthy (go easy on the butter, though)

OMG! I have made it twice loved it even more the second time!  I changed it a bit the second time around and not only doubled the sauce ingredients, but added way more garlic (5 minced cloves). I marinated it for a few hours and added a sprinkle of extra brown sugar over the top after pouring the warm sauce over the steaks.   I used aluminum foil instead of putting it directly on the grill. (I curled the edges up so the juice would not drip out) I did not waste any of the delicious sauce and added every drop to the foil. I also added some capers once it was on the grill (which added another WOW factor!) The steaks and capers cooked in the sizzling juices ~ the flavor was absolutely amazing. There was no fish taste and the garlic was subtle.  I served the halibut steaks over a bed of fresh spinach leaves along with some saffron rice and a side of crab legs. The halibut was even better than the crab!!! I am in Alaska and friends are always bringing me fresh halibut, so I will make this recipe again and again!

DEEEEEEEEEEEELISH!  I had to try this after a friend dropped off some fresh halibut he just caught yesterday.  Another cook made some reference to the sauce being as addictive as "crack"...lol We all know "crack" is not funny, but the comment sure IS and we ALL need a little humor in this day and age. I followed more good advice and doubled the sauce (next time I'll make even MORE SAUCE) and I brushed the fish with the sauce and also poured some over it.  Then, I oven baked the fish for 375° for 35 min.  We had about a 30 mph wind howling out on our deck so firing up the BBQ seemed like a bad idea.  Some of the cooking time will depend on the thickness of your fish fillets.  Served with rice (drenched in the sauce), and a tossed green salad.    IT WAS JUST DIVINE! The flavor in this sauce rivals any professional sauce I've ever tasted!  It would be DYNAMITE for dipping sauce for ANYTHING!  I do use all fresh ingredients (even my lemon juice is juiced from fresh lemons and frozen. This is a KEEPER for sure!

Edited 9-27-2010
We now use this sauce for rice dishes often.  IT IS JUST SOOO DEEEELISH!

wanted this to be crazy delish but it wasn't, it was just good delish...i used olive oil rather than butter so i could marinade instead of brushing and b/c the ingredients are fairly subtle you could marinade for several hours and still be alright. all in all i'd make again knowing what i know and be happy.

This is one of the best recipes for Halibut I have ever tried. I cut all of the ingredents in half.Is was perfect. The flavor was wonderful and it was so moist. I soaked the Halibut in all the sauce for about 30 minutes. I then put it on the grill. I poured some of the sauce on it while cooking. I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you

I only read through the reviews after trying this recipe two times . . . wished I'd read it first.  I totally agree . . . the fish needs a long time to marinade first before cooking it.  The first time I tried this recipe I followed the instructions and prepared the marinade just before actually cooking the fish (in total ignorance thinking the flavour would get through!).  The end result . . . the texture of the fish was fabulous and it looked and smelled fabulous just like the one I love eating at the restaurant but was disappointed that the marinade had hardly penetrated into the fish and it tasted a bit fishy.  The second time I tried out this recipe, I marinated the fish for only about 45 mins, but doubled the marinade thinking it would be give it enough flavour.  The end result was about the same - still a bit fishy even though I put tons of garlic. I will still definitely try this recipe out again but will marinade the fish longer as suggested by others.

We love this recipe! I use fresh squeezed lemon juice, pack the brown sugar firm and marinate it for at least an hour (longer is better). I brush the marinade heavily on the fish while grilling. Awesome flavor on fresh halibut!

i love this recipe. we usally dont have halibut in the house but we had it given to us. when i made it pretty much quadrupled the recipe because i looked at the recipe and i knew that it wouldn't work for even 1 pound of halibut when i was useing 2. even after doing extra on everything i put in some more suger but not more then another 2 tablespoons and a whole stick of butter total. plus i added a lot more garlic, some onions(i love both), and sesame seeds (they go good with anything). my grill ran out of propane but i didn't realize that until after i had already made the dish so i decided to broil it at 500 degrees. i had a shallow broiling pan with a grill slited lid. i put a thin grill thats supposed to be used for cooling cookies on top and i had a grill. for the sauce i did use the sauce pan but i didn't have a basting brush so i stuck the halibut in the pan for about 30 seconds each side before broiling. then before broiling i ran all the sauce over the halibut and scooped the onions, crushed garlic, and sesame seeds on top. it worked out really well because the broil cooked all sides at once and made the onions, garlic, and sesame seeds crispy and carmelized. also the brown suger crystalized on top and all over the halibut slices that is had cut the filet into (roughly 2"x 2"x 6"). overall i love the recipe with my adjustments,  and i encourage others to modify recipes and experiment with things you like because eventually you will make it better.

This was a very good dish.  I made the sauce and marinated the fish for about 2 hours.  Then I made another batch of the sauce to use to baste it while grilling.  That worked very well and really helped capture the taste.

Very good marinade.  I used Talapia instead of halibut, canola oil instead of butter, and I was out of soy sauce, so I used 1/2 teriaki and 1/2 worchestershire to replace.  I pan seared 1/2 the fish and grilled the other on foil.  The grilled was much better than the pan-seared.  I put in a salad of romaine, green olives, and champaigne vingrette.  Delicious.

I only used 1 Tbsp. butter but added another 1 Tbsp. of garlic.  I used George to grill the steaks for about 10 minutes and it was very good!  If I let it sit longer in the sauce it would've been a little better.

We loved it.  I used it with salmon as a marinade.  Put two 1 1/2 inch salmon steaks in a baggy with the sauce in the morning before work and at 7PM broiled for 15 min total and they were awesome. I used olive oil instead of butter in the marinade and then put a small pat of butter on the fish while in the broiler.  I also used dried minced garlic instead of fresh.  Served with ceaser salad and white sticky rice.

This recipe gets raves every time I make it and it will become a permanent recipe in my kitchen.  Most of the time I only cook for two, so there is plenty of sauce for two halibut steaks or filets.  When the weather is not good for grilling, I preheat the oven to 400 with the broiling pan inside.  Once heated, I throw the fish on the hot pan and cook until flakey.  Good stuff!

Wow.  This was terrific.  I had a lot of halibut so I quadrupled the recipe.  I poured a little sauce on the filets and let them marinate for 10-15 before grilling.  Then I put 1/3 the sauce aside to baste the fish while it was cooking and had the rest to pour over the cooked filets.  Delicious.  My two boys ages 5 & 7, who usually only eat fish if it's fish sticks, ate this and loved it.

This was a great recipe - it added a very pleasant flavor to the halibut steaks that I grilled, and was unlike any other halibut that I've eaten.  I served my halibut steaks topped with red bell pepper and sweet onion slivers sauted in butter and olive oil - it was a nice combination of flavors.

This recipe was excellent.  It worked really well with the halibut steaks.

Only recommendation I have is to double the sauce, as others have suggested.  I only prepared to steaks, and it soaked up all the sauce.  Next time I make ths, I will double the sauce, and reserve a little bit to serve as a dipping sauce, or to spoon over the fish once it's cooked and plated.

Thanks for the submission.

This is excellent on any type of fish such as swordfish, tuna, marlin, salmon, shark steak, etc..  I add green onions and double the recipe for extra sauce.  It's deeelicious!!

Used a swordfish steak and doubled the sauce as recommended. I cooked this indoors in the broiler on a cold, snowy February day. A delicious change of pace.

OMG!  My husband and I couldn't get enough of this.  The sauce was addicting.  Definitely make enough for drizzling over the fish after it's done cooking.  I broiled the halibut and it was wonderful!  Thanks for this recipe!

This was amazing!!!  The hardest part of making it is not grabbing everyone else's!  As others suggested, I doubled the marinade and kept half for pouring/dipping - the more, the better.  I also marinated the steaks for most of the day - at least 5 hours, and they ended up as moist and tender as anyone could ask for.  Thanks!!

this was so simple and delicious. my husband, who never likes sauces or marinades on fish, loved it. i marinated the fish for about 45 minutes before cooking which added a nice flavor and kept the fish very moist during cooking.

Great marinade, but it did not seem to penetrate the fish too much.  Need to cut some slits into the fish so that the sauce will be fully absorbed.

Excellent recipe. I couldn't find halibut at our fish market, so I used tilapia... a very different fish from halibut, but the results were wonderful. My kids who aren't that crazy about fish loved it this way. Thanks, Duane for a "keeper"!      Diana S.

Loved it!  Used the sauce as a marinade for about 2 hours. Took it out of the fridge and allowed butter to almost return to liquid, then grilled, and basted,  about 5 min each side for an approx 1 lb.  fillet. Delicious!!!!!!!

I had to change things a bit since I didn't have fresh tomatoes or zucchini so I used sun-dried tomatoes & spinach and marinated in Italian dressing like some reviewers suggested. Loved it! My husband said it was the best halibut he had ever had! I think "incredible" and "awesome" we're the words he used. Will definitely make this one again!

Delicious and easy!  I doubled the recipe and used 3 tablespoons of lemon juice.  Brushed some of the maringade on 30 minutes before cooking. Grilled it on hardwood charcoal with a few applewood chips.  Even my husband who doesn't like fish liked it.

Did NOT change a single ingredient! As a matter of fact, it's not necessary to marinate the fish as spooning the sauce frequently over the fish while grilling does the trick. I've used swordfish and tilapia since I couldn't find halibut and it is terrific!! This is my go-to for fish marinade on the grill!!!!!

I thought it was okay...not fantastic, but not bad.  I made the recipe as written, except I used Halibut fillets instead of steaks.

My husband and I really like this marinade for sturdy fish.  I think you can use about half as much marinade for the suggested amount of fish.  Works well with baked/broiled fish also.

This was great! I did let it marinate for 4 hours and doubled the marinade recipe since I wanted more flavor. I was pleasantly surprised.

I have never written a review but had to on this recipe. It was soooo good! I left out the butter and marinated the fish in the remaining ingredients for a few hours. Made a delicious crust on the fish and made it 2 days in a row, once to eat in fish tacos instead of the fried version. Can't wait to make again.

Pretty good! I am particular when it comes to fish and I was surprised at the really good flavour of this recipe. It doesn't overwhelm the fish, but it gives a really nice mellow flavour.

I love making halibut this way... except with lots of soy sauce and lots of honey simmered then marinated for about 20 minutes. Great with jasmine rice and seasoned seaweed.

Wonderful!  Since Halibut is so mild in flavor, and I didn't want to overpower it, I used the sauce as intended rather than marinate.  It was very good.

The fish tasted good, but there was no other flavour other than the fish.  Will keep looking for another basting sauce that adds the flavour I'm looking for to my fish.

Delicious!!! We all licked our plates clean. I made one batch of the sauce for a marinade, and boiled down another to drizzle on the grilled tuna (our fishmonger didn't have halibut today). We all agreed it's one of the very best fish recipes we've ever tasted! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was able to get my Fiance who does not eat fish, to eat this and love it. We made it exactly per the recipe with the exception of Splenda Brown Sugar blend in place of the Brown Sugar. Also goes great with chicken.

delicious.! foolproof!for a quickie I just added the sauce ingredients in a little ramiken (and didnt even have to measure exactly) and heated up in microwave for a minute  and mixed together and  it came out great. The butter really adds an amazing compliment to  the br, sugar so I would use less if calorie fat concious but it really is better tasting than oil in this recipe. I also sauteed shrimp in this sauce great!

OMG! I'm not a big fish eater, but this recipe has changed my mind!  This was wonderful.  I didn't even marinate the fish steaks and it was such a different and wonderful taste.  We followed advice to bake and then broil, but tonight we are going to use the grill.  I didn't vary from the original recipe and don't think I will much.  I prefer more garlic, so I will add a clove more, but this is absolutely delicious.  Thanks for sharing Duane!

This is my favorite way to eat halibut by far. My husband and I live on Kodiak Island and have A LOT of halibut, so we were glad when we found this recipe. We also broil the halibut if weather doesn't permit grilling outside, and found out that my brother uses the same sauce mixture for cooking venison, so later on this fall we'll try that as well!

My boyfriend and I LOVED this. I only marinated in sauce for about an 1/2 hour before hand turning over and basting every 5 min. Next time I will try longer. My only regret is that I didn't make more!

Made this for my two teenaged boys and my husband.  This is a keeper!  Very quick and simple to make and can be done at the last moment.. no need for hours or overnight marinade.  We found the taste to be perfect...not too sweet.  Expected it to taste more like a teriyaki but it didn't at all which was a pleasant change.  Will definitely use this again.

So delicious! Used frozen halibut that you put straight on the grill and turned out delicious, stuck to the recipe and did not marinate as some others did, but still turned out great! Even my 2 year old liked it.

This recipe was just what we were looking for! I followed the recipe exactly, although we used Haddock instead of Halibut. The marinate leaves you wanting more and I can never make enough to satisfy everyone. This recipe has become one of our favorites.

I rate 5 beacuse this is the only way my husband will eat Halibut now, but I am not a huge fan of any fish, but it was really good and doesn't require the recipie to be followed exactly.

Very easy to put together, but marinating must be the key.  I cooked the fresh halibut on the grill but didn't marinade it and it was tasteless.    I would only repeat this recipe if I had a few hours to marinade the halibut first.

This is very delicious and so easy. I added 1/2 teaspoon fresh minced ginger (or so) and the flavor was even better. If you're thinking about doing this on the stove top intead, I wouldn't. It does not do it justice as does the real charcoal grill :-)

I am not to fond of halibut, but was given some and thought this would work out well.  The sauce was amazing.  Still, not a fan of halibut, but I went on to try this on beef and chicken and it is the best basting sauce I have tasted.  Everyone of my picky eaters loved it, except on the halibut.

I went with a recommendation from another review to bake it instead of grilling it because it was easier for me at the time.  It turned out nice however I think the flavor would have been more intense by grilling it which I will definitely do the next time.

This is a wonderful recipe...wish I could give it more than five stars.  Not only is it easy, the flavor and presentation is "company-meal" worthy.  Instead of grilling, I covered the halibut with sliced onions, and baked in oven (with sauce) for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  Turned out fabulous... Thanks for the fine recipe Duane!

Wonderful!  Double the marinade sauce and if you have the time let halibut marinate in fridge for 5 - 10 minutes.  Really good!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful.  I have made this recipe several times for family and friends and they rave about how flavorful the grilled halibut was. Be sure to add the remaining marinade to the fish while grilling several times so the fish does not dry out.

This was tasty, but didn't really soak into the fish very well. Maybe it would be better to let it sit in the sauce for about 10 minutes before grilling. I'll try that next time. The flavor was excellent, just not strong enough! I made it with Halibut for my hubbie, and tuna for me. Maybe since I had the tuna and it's so dense, that's why I didn't taste it much. Either way, we both really enjoyed it and will definitely make again.

Incredible!  This sauce lets the fresh taste of the halibut shine through without masking it.  I wish I would have bought more halibut because everyone inhaled theirs and wanted more. :)

My husband and I really weren't too impressed by this one.  Halibut is such a mild-flavored fish, it really needs an assertive sauce/marinade and this was just too mild/bland for our taste.  Maybe if we had added some really spicy chili sauce...

This is the best recipe.  I grew up in Alaska on Fresh Halibut and I had never tasted such a great halibut steak as the ones marinated in this sauce.  This recipe would be great for those who even dislike fish becuase the sauce is so delicious.  Ann Marie

Maybe part of the problem was my fish substitute..i used orange roughy...this was definately not our cup of tea.  My 10 yo son, who loves to eat, decided to go on a diet after trying this.

My husband really liked this.  The halibut was very expensive.  It was a nice treat for my husband and I think he felt a bit spoiled that night.  This isn't something we could afford on a regular basis.

Very tasty.  Instead of steaks, I had cheeks, but they seemed to work.  Easy to make.  I used 2 tbsp of soy sauce rather than tsps.  I didn't want to take out my indoor grill, so I pan-grilled them.  I poured whatever sauce I had left over the halibut and let it cook in it.  Savoury.

I used this on fresh salmon and it turned out very good!  I was leary to use this on salmon, but it was perfect, not to sweet, just right!  I did double the sauce as recommended by others.  I can't wait to try this on halibut!  Thanks Duane for sharing!

Excellent recipe.  We loved it.  Would also taste good on chicken.  Next time I would make a double batch of the sauce so there would be extra for dipping or pouring over the fish when it is done as halibut tends to get dry. Nummy!

Awesome. This was the first time I had made halibut, wish I had made twice as much. My five year old grandson begged for more, he ate half of mine and some of grandpa's, too. Great dish, quick and easy. I think I will marinate the fish longer the next time.

I thought this was OK.  I don't think I'll make it again, however.  It was lacking something but I just don't know what.  I couldn't believe that my kids really liked it.  I prefer halibut fillets and I like them baked or deep fried.

Very tender, mild and delicious.  My husband usually only likes fried fish but he
loved this.  I used halibut fillet instead of steaks (my fish store doesn't carry the steaks)
and it was great.  With the fillet, you don't turn over -- the less you fuss with it
the better.  Will definately make this again and again!  Thanks!

Excellent!  This was the BEST Halibut I have ever had on the grill!  This sauce was extremely easy to prepare and the flavor is just perfect. No leftovers - not even a crumb!  This will be a keeper in my house because even my fish hating young daughther loved it!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

The sauce is also great on grilled pork chops!

Very good: I was skeptical about the marinade but to my surprise my wife and I loved it !!!
I smoked mine at 400f and pulled it off at 129f. It took about 20 minutes. Will definitely make it again.

Followed the enhanced process in “rainstripe”’s review below and also added cayenne and fresh ginger.  Big hit with even the non-fish lovers in my family.

I made this recipe for my wife. She said it was her new favorite way to have Halibut. 

I tried it, as well, and it was very good. The marinade kind of caramelized, and gave the fish a sweet glazed outer layer. The Halibut was skinless, so I was able to coat the entire fillet (2lbs). 

My wife will make sure I make the recipe again!

I love fish but until now have not found an easy and delicious recipe. I only had time to  marinade the halibut for 30 minuets so next time I will plan ahead better and allow at least one hour. Also, next time I will turn and continue cooking after 4 minutes. The fish was just a bit dry after 5 minutes per side. This recipe is a keeper??!

Some of these Reviews made me laugh. ‘I followed the instructions exactly the way they was written... I marinated for 1000 hours and then......’ lol.   I followed the instructions and it came out good. No marinade needed.

Very good, did not marinate just basted with sauce.  We were able to pick up halibut on a great sale so it was all the better. Will definitely make this again.

D E L I C I O U S !!!!! We will be trying this again soon, but with a cheaper fish.  I made double the sauce marinaded it, basted it, and then rubbed some more on while eating it. Wow! So good! The halibut is a little rich for my blood, and I misread the tag at the big box grocery store.  When I got home I just about had a stroke over the price.  Oh! well guess we have to eat it, but so glad we did.  No take out this week because of the splurge, but again so worth it.  All you Alaska people need to try this recipe if You have some halibut available.  Enjoy! We did:)

Delicious! I doubled the recipe for 1.25 lbs of fresh Halibut. I used half to marinade for an hour or so and saved the remaining for basting. I grilled each side for about 4-minutes on medium-high and served immediately. I'll definitely make this again.

I changed nothing except the manner of cooking. Cooked it in an iron skillet on the stove. The sauced crisped the outside of the fish. Was delicious.

I made this recipe, and made it with honey instead of brown sugar. I also added fresh ginger, minced and err on the side of more garlic. I marinated it for 30 minutes, it tastes a bit like a Teriyaki marinate.  I started with a very hot pan and seared each side one minute to score each side. I then put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 more minutes. Delicious!!! I will make this again. Thank you!

Delicious!!! However, next time we're going to double the sauce and maybe even marinade it for a little bit.  It just wasn't as strong of a flavor as we like; but still yummy.

My kids (who don't usually go for fish) loved this! I doubled the recipe, swapped olive oil for the butter, and decided to bake it at 350 for 15min as mentioned in other reviews. I also decided to bake it in the marinade and it came out great even though I only marinaded it for a few minutes before baking it. Delicious!

Incredible! The caramelization on the fish from the sauce was insane delicious. I marinated my halibut in the sauce for more than 4 hours then popped it in my fish grill basket and cooked over charcoal. Seriously, this was the best halibut I've ever eaten. I WILL keep this recipe handy for future uses...like every use. Thanks a gazillion for sharing it!

After reading the other reviews, I doubled the sauce and was glad I did.  Wouldn't change a thing.  It was light and flavorful and did not overpower the Halibut. I would definitely make this again.

AMAZING!!! I did this with a salmon filet and the fresh garlic cloves. Sooo unbelievably good! Good sweet and sour. It was easy and packed quite a zippy punch! I baked it uncovered in my oven on 400 for 13 min after brushing the filet with the sauce and then pouring the remaining sauce in the Pyrex.  I served it over rice that I drizzled with some of the sauce after it came out of the oven. This was better than anything I've had at a restaurant for a long time!!! New favorite!!

My friend brought back fresh halibut from Alasks & I used this recipe.  It was fantastic! I used extra lemon juice after they came off the grill.  Will definately use recipe again!

Seriously, you can't buy a meal this good in a restaurant. I rarely eat fish because I don't care for it but this dish everyone loves. My husband who loves fish says this is his favorite.....hands down.

Marinated the fish for about an hour. Cooked the marinade to serve with the fish but accidentally poured it over my broccoli. It worked really well there too! The fish was nice and moist so it really didn't need any extra sauce anyways
Update: made this again and put it on the bbq in a veggie basket. It didn't stay nearly as moist even though it marinated for a good hour.  Cooked only 3 to 4 min on each side and it was nearly overcooked

Just made this and it was fantastic!  Made exactly as written except marinated for 30 minutes and made extra and reserved to pour over after it was done.  Cooked on grill on medium and cooked on aluminum foil.  Next time will cook for 4 minutes per side but was still awesome.

Substituted lemon for lime, otherwise as-is. Brushed olive oil on halibut steaks before grilling, using this sauce for basting. Came out perfect - nice and flaky, with the brown sugar caramelizing as a thin crust. Will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely the best recipe I've ever used on a piece of Halibut!  So glad I found this recipe! I always double the recipe so I have a little left over to dunk the fish in after grilling it in tinfoil.  Thank you!

WOW! So yummy and so simple!! Didn't have brown sugar, so I used honey.  I also marinated overnight, which did make the marinade a lil chunky, but still tasted de-li-cious!!!

The sauce is absolutely awesome!  I did it exactly the way they said and my husband loved it.  We're just married and don't own a grill (as yet...) so I broiled it on low and just kept basting it with the sauce.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce and had just enough to cover the filets.  It was perfect, but I can't wait to try it on the grill.

Tasty, light and easy.  I used the mixture as a marinade rather than basting it.  The flavor was light but perfect for a good fish like halibut.

Absolutely phenomenal. As I was eating, I asked my husband "Where has halibut been all of my life?". Following suggestions of others, I doubled the sauce for dipping. The grill ran out of propane just as I put the fish on, so I ended up baking it--so good. But don't get me wrong, I will be making this one on the grill next time because I am sure it will make this recipe ten star!

Amazing, although I did follow the suggestions of reviews and used olive oil rather than butter, honey rather brown sugar, and doubled the garlic.

My husband couldn't get enough of the sauce. The only change we made was substituted half of the brown sugar for honey, and we cooked it all up in the pan we had just fried bacon in.  Delicious!

Great! This is a keeper, followed recipe and added honey as one review mentioned and it was great. It was not to sweet and it was just perfect. It would probably go good on chicken too. Thanks for a great recipe

Absolutely excellent halibut recipe!  They came out succulently moist, flavorful, and provided for a beautiful presentation.  I marinated the halibut in the sauce for about 4 hours, and I also made some extra (that had not touched the raw fish!) to spoon over it once done.  I used a grill pan, which seemed to work out just fine.  I recommend freshly ground pepper on each side of the filet, after brushing with the marinade, for extra punch.  I served this with steamed veggies and mashed yams.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good recipe - plain, but kept the taste of the halibut.  Good weeknight recipe.  Marinated it for 45 minutes but might try a little longer next time.

I wasn't sure about this at 1st. The marinade did not smell good to me but after basting and grilling the fish the flavors all worked well together. Halibut is expensive and hard to find around here but any meaty white fish could work.

I don't eat fish, but my husband loved this.  I did marinate the fish for 3 hours and I also used Talipia instead of Halibut.  He said this was the best fish I have made.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out really tasty, and we used the 2 inch thick halibut steaks w/ the skin still on.  Once done grilling, removed the skin and bone, and enjoyed.  Very tasty marinade. Thank you.

Great flavors with the basting sauce.  It works great with the fish.  The key to this is the quality of the fish.  Will definitely use again.

Very good!  We used it on halibut and tried to marinate it, but the butter got hard.  Next time I won't marinate it, I'll just baste it like the recipe says.  Great flavor though.

I almost never eat fish, but since I caught a lot of halibut, I was looking for a recipe to make it with. This recipe ROCKS.. and I am definitely not a fish fan.  I quadrupled the recipe and added a few splashes of sesame oil and it is the bomb!!!  Definitely marinate for at least 3-4 hours for best results.

Wonderful recipe for fresh halibut steaks.  I made enough marinade for 3 steaks even though I was only grilling two and it was all used up.  Only change I made was using extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. Will make again..soon!!

Very delicious on the grill.  Make sure you use a non-stick spray on the grill to keep the fillets from sticking.  Love the recipe.

What an awesome taste! this is by far the best fish I've made! i used nile perch, used 1 garlic clove and baked it uncovered until all the juices ran clear and the top was grilled. served it with roasted sweet potato and the family was licking their fingers! 
thanks for a great recipe!

Easy dish!  I didn't marinade the steaks prior to grilling and it still had great flavor!  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is a good one... the only thing about it is, instead of using butter, i used Extra-Virgin Olive oil, and i reduced the amount of soy sauce by a teaspoon, and added a bit of honey to the mix.I also marinated the fish for about an hour or so b4 baking as it was too cold to grill outside, and i didnt feel like using my indoor on-stove grill. Needless to say there was nothing left and even my 7 yr old(the pickiest eater) liked it! Delicious! WIll use it again, and with other fish!

My husband loved this simple recipe.  I think he made it his new favorite for fish.  (I generally make tilapia, because it's cheaper and easier to find where we live.)

I marinated it all day.  It had more flavor than I like, over powered the fish I thought.  Also, too sweet for me.  My 9 year old really liked it though.  I didn't grill it though, I baked it. Perhaps that would have made a difference.

Me, I thought this was "very good" but my husband said it was the best meal he's had.  Period.  Served it with cous cous and Tofu Creamed Spinach.  I do have to say it was SUPER easy and quick.

Very good.  I would recommend spooning the basting sauce over the fish before serving rather than discarding it - otherwise the fish would be too bland (for my taste.)  Next time I will try marinating it.

Excellent and easy...had to use cod instead and marinated for 8 hrs; accented the fish well, not overpowering.

When I first made the sauce, and added the brown sugar to the heat, and it crumbled really fast, and the sugar and garlic just turned into one huge black glob. Instead, I made the sauce again, minus the garlic and sugar, and then pured it over the fish. (I used salmon). I also added seasme oil and sub the black pepper for cayenne pepper. After pouring the hot sauce onto the fish, i then smothered fresh garlic and a little of the sugar onto the fish. Let marinade for an hour, then gerilled on the Gerorge Forman. After that it was great!!

SO freakin' tasty!!  Used cod instead of halibut steaks since it's a little less expensive, but it still turned out wonderful.  My husband asks me to make at least once a week.

I wasn't a huge fan of this recipe.  It was pretty good, but it was also a little bit weird-tassting.  Plus, the entire house smelled like garlic afterward. :)

Absolutely delicious!  So easy to make and the flavor was tasty without being overpowering.  I did let the fish sit in a while in the sauce before grilling and it helped soak in the flavor.

I recommend marinating the fish for at least 15 minutes.  The sauce recipe is so good you want to taste it.  Thanks Duane!  We made it with the Tomato Cucumber Dill weed salad!  So fresh and summery!

Since I didn't have halibut, I used this on salmon filet strips threaded onto skewers and it was really good! To add some color, I sprinkled fish with parsley before grilling.

I'm not a fish lover, but WOW!! This is a great griiling recipe. My tip would be to marinate fish in brine for about 6 hours,get that wonderful flavour into the meat!

So good!  I used a thawed highliner boston bluefish fillet instead of halibut.  I trimed the dark meat of the fillet and cut it in three and cooked it the same as the recipe called for.

this was delicious!  I used it on halibut and sturgeon and both were super.  I made double the recipe as suggested and think that is the way to go.  I'm wondering if this would be good to try on chicken?  Anyhow, we are strictly white fish eaters and fairly new at that so I'm always looking for a good and easy way to prepare it, thanks!

I don't know how you people "grilled" this halibut steak, but I used a stovetop grill.  Unfortunately "medium" heat on this unit was insufficient to cook it well enough so I resorted to the microwave.  I will say that the sauce was very very tasty though.  It's a good balance of everything!

This is a wonderful sauce--and it uses ingredients I almost always have on hand!  I've even begun leaving out the lemon juice and using it as a marinade, then making a small batch with the lemon juice to use as directed.  Great with chicken, too.

This is the recipe that has encouraged my husband and me to eat more fish. I always use lite soy sauce as the regular is much too salty for us and used the ginger instead of pepper. I doubled the sauce for extra dipping. Thank you for an excellent recipe!

I have to say that this was the best recipe.  I am not a fish lover and this was great.  I really liked the kick that the pepper and the soy sauce added.  I added a little more soy sauce because I like it.  This a recipe that I am going to use over and over again.

This is a great recipe. My husband loves fish and he even said he thought it was the best Halibut he has ever had.  I did constantly brush the fish with the sauce to make sure it pentrated and I think marinating it would make it easier.  I do not eat fish but I love this particular one. Thanks for the great sauce recipe!

This was a real hit.  I would recommend using a little bit more soy sauce though, as I basted my halibut with what turned out to be a paste more than a sauce.  And if you don't have lemons, try using lime instead.  i did and it turned out fantastic.  The lime complements the soy sauce superbly.

It was good tasting but the fish was soft. We are used to halibut being a firm fish not a soft fleshed fish. The taste was good though. Just not what we are used to in the Pacific NW. I'm not sure if we will serve it again. But I'm not saying it wasn't good either.

Used this recipe on swordfish last night.  Absolutely delicious - a great blend/balance of flavors.  Will try it on chicken and pork also.  The person who said it was lacking in flavor must have left something out.

This was awesome.  I have never made halibut before and would do it again in a heartbeat.  I thought the sweetness of the brown sugar sounded kind of unapealing, but after reading the other reviews I gave it a try.  Yeah for me!!! I really liked it can you tell?  Thank you

I made this as the recipe called for, except I turned every two minutes and basted with the sauce.  I personally like the flavor of the sauce or marinade,  and If I make it again,  I would definately  marinade it several hours.

One of the best things about this recipe is that all of the ingredients (except the halibut) are staples in my home so everything was here!  My picky 5 year old daughter and 11 year old son asked for seconds!  I would definately make this for company and they'd think I'd worked on it for hours!
Thanks for the recipe!

This was super fast and really tasty...a perfect last minute dinner. On the advice of previous reviewers, I doubled the marinade and basted several times while it cooked. I had to broil instead of grill...it was still wonderful!

Really good!  I forgot to pierce the fish before hand, next time I will so that this yummy marinade will penetrate the fish more.  My 2 year old ate this up!

This was great! Easy, fast, and really, really tasty. I made it a second time and added grated ginger instead of the pepper - it tasted wonderful either way. Try this if you're in a pinch for time. Thanks for posting it!

Even I liked this and I don't care for fish!!!  I used ahi and broiled it instead of BBQ (although grilling would taste better, or course) and it was a big hit at my house.  This is a super fast dinner to make- fast to cook AND fast to prep and clean up.  GREAT RECIPE! I will definately be making this again!

Simply fantastic and so easy and fast to do! It really enhances not overpowers delicate fish flavor! We used it on striped bass, but I'm sure it would be wonderful on tuna, blackfish, fluke or even chicken.

This was my first attempt at cooking fish that turned out well! Every time I've fixed fish before it never tasted as good as eating it in a resturant so, I finally gave up trying. My dinner guests requested I grill fish so I turned to recipe finder and Duane, you saved me! THANK YOU!!

Pretty good for the adults but its almost to much garlic for kids.  Really enjoyed it on the grill.
