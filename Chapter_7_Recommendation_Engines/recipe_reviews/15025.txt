My husband and I loved this!  I made it with cream of chicken soup and used less sour cream and butter.  I used 50% reduced fat sour cream and butter. I also mixed the cheese throughout and added a little on top.  I left it in the oven about ten minutes longer so the cheese could brown on top. Finally, there is no need to thaw hashbrowns as you could break the frozen potatoes down with the hot soup mixture when mixing.

This recipe is always a big hit at picnics/family gatherings, etc.  I use O'Brian hash browns (they have red and green peppers and onions)and I don't use green onions.  They make the casserole much better and more flavorful. I use cream of celery soup instead of Cr. of potato. Great recipe!

We loved this recipe.  I know it is a vegetarian recipe and is good as is as a side dish, however, for this to be an easy and complete meal, we added a cup or so of cooked, cubed ham.  We also added a can of cream of chicken soup.  The result was a creamy and tasty dinner.  Good amount of everything and will make again.  i must also add that it is really easy.  Worth a try with meat or not.  Thanks Linda!! My family appreciates it!!

This was the best potato dish I've made so far....It was very creamy with lots of flavor. I did'nt have green onions but added chopped onions in the mix.Need to brown the onions to soften them before baking. Thanks for the recipe!

Very hearty dish, but a little too greasy (I recommend omitting the butter).  As other reviewers suggested, I used light sour cream, light cheddar cheese, and light margarine to lessen the fat and also used cream of chicken and mushroom soup.  Also added more onions and some garlic to spice up the otherwise somewhat bland sauce.  Also added some cooked crumbled turkey bacon.  My boyfriend, a meat and potatoes kind of guy, loved it, served with steamed broccoli.

I've tried to get this recipe from my sister-in-law for years.  Finally got smart enough to look on allrecipes.com. Thanks, it is great. A note about thawing potatoes first. I had it recently at someone's and they did not thaw them. It was not good as the potatoes were not done.  Thawing was a great hint.  Again, great easy recipe.

My husband thought this was a store bought dish!  It's quick, easy, and so very tasty.  The next time I make this casserole, I am going to sprinkle the top with some crispy bacon, since it tastes so much like a baked potato!

I am sorry to say this, but this was horrible.  I made it for dinner and it was pretty bad, we ended up dumping it.  Maybe I did something wrong, but my husband and I found it unedible.  Sorry :-(

I believe the reason the potatos are not cooking is they should be defrosted before cooking.  This will also enable some of the water to leave making the seasoning more pronounced.  Great recipe

Fabulous, but I do have a suggestion.  I had to serve this to people I did not know and thought that perhaps not everyone would like the green onions. Some of the people said that it was a little bland too, so... I used the cream of celery soup as people had suggested.
I did not use chopped green onions BUT the last 10 minutes of baking I covered the casserole in Durkee fried onion rings as you would in a greenbean casserole.
I figured that anyone who didn't like onion could just scrape it off.  IT WAS WONDERFUL.  Oh, I did warm up the potatoes to completely defrost and I did cook it longer that the suggested time.  I tried it at the recommended time and it was still a little too firm, so I kept cooking until the potatoes were thoroughly cooked.  Different ovens, right???

We made this last night but added beef (browned and drained) and cream of onion as suggested by someone else. We were unable to use the green onion because the store had one package left, and once I got home, I saw that it was too bad off to eat. How frustrating! I have to stress that the green onion is a MUST. The final product tasted good, but was definitely lacking something even though we spiced it heavily. It's not something I'd feel comfortable serving to other people (at least not without the onion), but it was good for a rainy day. I'm impressed that the sour cream wasn't too over-powering, but we used light sour cream and a 1/2 cup less of cheese.

Delicious!  I made a few changes after reading other reviews:  parboiled potatoes for 5 minutes; used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of potato; cut back on the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups.  For the cheese, I used 1/2 cup shredded swiss cheese and 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack.  For the topping I substituted a thin layer of Peppridge Farm Stuffing mix, topped with a drizzle of butter.  I served this with my holiday meal and received rave reviews even from the pickiest eater.  It's a keeper.

This was YUMMY!!! Instead of cream of potato soup, I used cheddar cheese and cream of chicken soup.  Other than that I left the recipe as is and it was a hit!  It was the perfect side dish with our ham!  I will make this again and again!

Very good. I reduced the sour cream to one cup and the butter to 2 Tbs based on the other reviews. I also thawed the O'brien potatoes in a colander under running water. I used reduced fat Cream of Celery soup & added garlic powder. I did not heat the soup, butter & cream prior to mixing in; I just mixed everything in a large bowl(stir the soup smooth first) and turned it into a casserole dish to bake. Sprinkled with paprika for color. It turned out very good and I did not have the mess of another saucepan to clean. Good recipe.

I am rating this with the changes I made. I used 6 oz lowfat greek yogurt and added a can of cheddar cheese soup along with the potato soup. I omitted the 2 cups of cheese and just sprinkled about 1/2 c. over the top and sprinkled panko crumbs over all. It was very creamy and nice!

Good! I used 1\2 cup chopped onions, red pepper, one can of mushroom soup and diced ham. I baked it for 30 minutes at 350. I added 1 cup of cheese on top and cooked it for 10 minutes. I did not add butter. All gone!

DE-LISH!!!  I mixed part mild and part sharp cheese to make this dish (based on another review).  We also found that the potatoes need to cook for a good 60 minutes in order for them to soften.  Dish was devoured at our event!  Everyone loved it.  We ended up adding 4 c. cornflakes (crushed) combined with 2/3 stick of butter to make a crunchy topping.  Yum!!

It was good, but not excellent.  I even fried the hashbrowns first with the green onions, but still it needed more flavour.  Not really worth the calories!

I modified this recipie also. I only used 1 lb. potatoes. 1/4 chopped onion, 1 whole can cream of celery soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup of sharp cheese mixed in and 1/2 cup on top. I put about a half of tsp. of red pepper and 1 tbl. butter in the soup mixture. It was great! I think I will make it with cream of mushroom next time and maybe swiss cheese?

I use regular yellow or white onion and omit the butter. I incorporate all of the cheese in the mixture. I put crushed potato chips on top. Oh, I usually use cream of chicken soup since I keep it on hand. Mmmm mmmm good.

This is the first time I made this and everyone loved it!  The hash browns to use are the Southern Style that are actually cut in small cubes.  The potatoes should also be thawed before making this.  Otherwise I am sure the cooking time would be double.  The ease of preparation is also another thing that makes this recipe great!

Absolutely delicious!! This is deffinately a dish that is going to be made quite often.  Like some suggestions, I too used a regular yellow onion as opposed to the green onions.  This is a simple and scrumptious dish! Highly recommended!

I got this recipe from here about a year ago. I make it quite a bit. I change it a little each time. I like to omit the green onion and just chop a white or yellow onion and throw that in. I think the original recipe needs a little crunch, so I alternate between putting buttered cornflakes on top or dicing and lightly frying some bacon to put on before baking. I also love how easy it is. I can mix it up while my son is napping then pop it in the oven later on. Great recipe!

My husband said that this was "killer", so we definitely loved it!  As someone else suggested, I used hasbrown potato chunks and really like the texture.  I also added some broccoli.  We will definitely eat this a lot!

Excellent! The sour cream really gives this one a nice tang. I'd recommend this recipe to everyone that's looking for a simple, economic and tasty way to make a potato side dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe Linda!

Very easy recipe to make. Not only is the flavor and texture wonderful, you get an extra benefit of a wonderful smell in the house while you're baking this dish. I increased the green onion but other than that, the proportions were great!

I used 2 cups of sour cream...way too overwhelming...I would cut down on the sour cream next time.  I used cream of mushroom instead and it turned out fine.  Tastes like baked potatoes...not bad.  Quick & easy.  May be better as a side dish though.  Use bigger chunks of potatoes if possible.

This was great!! I made it low fat by deleting the butter, using low-fat sour cream, and a mixture of low-fat and fat-free cheddar.  It was great!!!  Only one tip for making it low fat--mix all the cheese in.  It only melts great that way.  If you don't mix it in, the stuff on top forms a sort of crust.

Excellent! I went ahead and sauted the onions with some garlic - used cream of chicken soup that was on hand, mixed the cheese throughout and instead of topping with cheese, used crushed cornflakes with drizzled butter over all, to add some texture. Also used a smidgen of habenero hot pepper sauce. Superb with a Roast, and will be on our Christmas dinner menu. Thank-you!

I took this to a church potluck and it vanished! I added broccoli and canadian bacon and used reduced fat sour cream and reduced fat cheese.. Very good. Will keep this recipe as one to make again.

Would have loved to give this recipe a 5, however, after making it exactly to the recipe posted, the prominent flavor was sour cream. That's really all I tasted. I would make again, however, I would definitely reduce the sour cream to 1 cup and add spices like garlic or onion powder (it was pretty bland). Personal preference would be to add a different flavor soup, such as cream of mushroom or cream of celery so that you have a flavor other than potato (this preference did not count towards rating).

Loved this! I did use some suggestions and added a few of mine. I defrosted the shredded hash browns and  I used 2 cups of soups instead of one.   I sprinkled panko crumbs on top of the shredded cheese and baked at 400 for 10 minutes to brown crumbs then 350 for another 30 minutes. It came out fantastic.

This is a great recipe.  I give it four stars because it needs an extra can of soup to be creamy enough.  I like to use one can of cream of potato and one can of cream of chicken.  I have also used this recipe in the slow cooker on low for eight hours and it turns out great.

I used O'Brien style hash browns and I think because they are in cubes (not shredded), the cooking time should have been longer.  They were a bit raw tasting.  Other than that, pretty good.

Usually, I use cream of chicken soup for my potato casserole-- but I think I like cream of potato soup better as this recipe calls for.  One step that I don't think is necessary-- just so you don't have to dirty an extra pan-- is heating the cream of potato/butter up on the stove.  It is a little tougher to mix but it still works if you just melt the butter in the microwave.  I also added a little milk to get a creamier consistancy.

It really doesn't get any easier or tastier.  I used frozen hash browns that had peppers and onions already in it and I didn't have any green onions but it still game out really great.  I will definetly make this again.

Yummy, yummy!  I tried something like this at a potluck and wanted the recipe but never got it.  This was quite the same.  A great hearty side dish (my husband who hates sour cream loved it and was none the wiser!)  I'll be adding this to the rotation for sure.  Barb in BC Canada

I really liked the idea of this recipe, I changed it a little bit.  Instead of hash browns I used "real" potatoes.  I couldn't find cream of potato soup so I used a can of condensed potato and leek soup.  I used a little bit less sour cream than the recipe calls for.  Instead of the cheddar cheese on the top I used mozarella and waited until about half way through the cooking time to add it.  It took a lot longer to cook than 45 minutes.  More like an hour and a half.  But it was very yummy when it was finally finished.

I used Cream of Mushroom soup to give it a little more taste.  It wasn't nearly as creamy as I thought it would be but my children (18 mths and 2 1/2 years) pigged out on it.  This made a very large portion so there were a lot of leftovers but my children gobbled it down then too!  I didn't like it much but it will definently be made over and over again for the kiddos!

I changed the recipe a little by using cream of chicken soup for more flavor, because I have tried other dishes like this that seemed to taste like paste.  I also added a smidge more cheese to the mixture, it can't hurt, right? And I used 1 1/2 c. sour cream.  It was deeee-lish!

Good. Used cream of chicken soup & half the sour cream, also threw in some real bacon bits. Also used cubed potatoes that had been thawed in fridge. As with others, added time to cooking. After adding 20 minutes in oven, taters still weren't done. Finally stuck dish in microwave for 5 minutes to finish. Will pre-cook taters next time. Kinda greasy (sopped some up w/paper towel) but good flavor. Seasoned w/Tony Chacheri's Creole seasoning-that stuff is great for anything that's slightly bland.

The taste was great but the potatoes did not cook in 45 min. Not even close. I ended up having to cook it a lot longer and it got really dry. Next time I will use real potatoes and I will cook them first. I just know it will be great!

My family has been making a variation of this recipe for years.  I use hashbrown patties and Cream of Chicken soup.  We also crush corn flakes and sprinkle over the top, the more you use, the more crust you have.  Then butter to make the flakes crispy...and voila.  Delicious!

Made exactly as directed but it really lacked something.  It was good but just ok.  In order for me to justify the calories, it needed to be great.  Thanks anyway.

Everyone loved this at a recent picnic we had.  I used light sour cream, and you could probably use 2% cheese, also.  It was great!  I loved the onions.  We'll see this again for parties.

Similar to one that my family has made for holidays for as long as I can remember! Instead of green onions, we use half a cup of regular onions and we also use cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom. Oh yeah, and top it off with either butter crackers or corn flakes mixed with melted butter. Yum!

The taste wasn't bad, but the texture was awful.  After an hour in the oven the potatoes still tasted raw and the sour cream made the dish spongey, rather than creamy.

This recipe was simple to put together and included several items you would probably have in the house. I enjoyed it. my kids choked it down but they are in a non-eating phase... my husband enjoyed it as did my dad.  My mom does not like sour cream so it was not her favorite but it was good. I enjoyed it alot but I like food! heheh! Give it a shot! I might use cream of celery next time and toss in some bacon or ham

This was delicious but very slightly bland.  Next time I am going to add cooked, crumbled bacon to the potatoes and I'll probably use cream of celery soup instead!  Very good recipe, a definite keeper.

I tried this recipe but didn't have sour cream. I combined instead 2 cans of soup, 2 eggs, half stick of butter and about two cups of cheese in a pot to make a basic cheese sauce (along with a sprinkle here and there of seasonings to taste.) Folded the mix into the potatoes, poured in a baking dish and topped with cheese. My hubby litterally said he could eat it every night.

Waaaaaay too rich, and seemed to be lacking in something. I used fat free sour cream, sweet onion instead of green and used the cubed frozen potatoes as another reviewer suggested. We ate small side dish portions of this, but were none too thrilled. Ended up tossing the rest of it. It wasn't inedible or anything, we just weren't fans of it at all.

My roommates loved this dish. It is so good and cheesy. I decided not to put in the green onions and it tasted way good with out them. I also didn't ad salt and pepper to it...I let them put it on themselves, it tastes good that way.

This was okay, had to force myself to eat the leftovers. Also I messed it up a tad and used formed hashbrowns-the type like McDonalds uses, and put this in layers.

Definite Comfort Food--Great for a Rainy Day!! I substituted the cream of potato with cream of chicken soup. Also, I added 1 cup of diced ham--made it a great main dish! This will be a regular in our house!

I didn't have any frozen potato's so I used fresh grated potato's and I rinsed them after I grated them.  I didn't have as much sour cream as the recipe called for either but it turned out good anyway.  Also, next time I will probably cut the amount of cheese in half, it was too cheesy.  I used a little bit of monterey jack cheese because I didn't have as much cheddar as the recipe called for.  The ham I added gave it a good flavor and I made hash browns with the leftovers the next morning.

was okay.  should have lowered temp a little as it browned on top but hash browns were not cooked completely.  good for a "throw-together" side dish.

I made this for our work Christmas party, I wasn't sure if it would go over big, but boy I was wrong everyone loved it. I covered it with foil for the first 30 min, then for the last 10 min, cooked it uncovered, till it browned. Also I used the light sour cream, to cut out some of the fat.

This is a little heavy on the sour cream.  Next time I make it I'll cut that down to 1-1 1/2 cups.  It's a great recipie to experiment with, I'm going to add bacon, brocolli, etc.

Hands down, best creamy potato casserole ever!  I did make a few adjustments.  I seasoned the potatoes with garlic powder & put all the cheese in the casserole. Then I topped with 1 cup of crushed corn flakes mixed with 1/4 cup melted butter.  Also, 5 minutes before it was finished, I also sprinkled on a handful of crushed fried onions.

Absolute comfort food heaven! I used cream of broccoli soup, added a handful of crumbled bacon, and used half a pound of ground pork, fried up with some garlic. 
This recipe has so much room for adding your own touch, but is the basis for an amazing family meal :) 
Thank you!!

Did not add green onion or potato soup. Added a can of Campbell’s half cream of chicken/cream of mushroom also added a can of cream of celery. Everyone loved it and it was so easy. This is a must have for any good Baptist.

suggest cooking the frozen potatoes before adding to the casserole - the potatoes were hard and raw, but the taste of the sauce was good.  I will use shredded hash browns rather than the cubed potatoes the next time.

I have always put in  fresh mushrooms, sliced and made the soup, can of mushroom. Makes it even better. Didn't use bacon or any meat, it doesn't really need it. And it is a wonderful hit at parties, luncheon, or buffets. I'd suggest this recipe to everyone and anyone. I already have over the years. One of my families favorites.
I too reduced sour cream and butter, neither are that necessary in those amounts. Fresh red onion and garlic improves the taste too. I don't care much for green onions, so this is personal option.

I make this all the time only using left over baked potatoes. Just peel and shred the potatoes. Yes a little more work but so worth it.

This is an awesome dish but I don't use the onions.  I don't care a lot for onions and don't really think they add much in this case anyways.

This dish is not creamy.  I followed the directions but the hash browns never really cooked.  I cooked for about an hour.  I couldn't cook any longer because the cheese was starting to burn.  I just don't see what happened to the cream soup and sour cream.  I thought with those two combined it would make the recipe really creamy.  It was also very bland.  I added extra salt and spices, but it was still bland.  Thanks for the recipe, but I will not try this again.

Too saucy and rich for our tastes.  If I made it again, I'd add more potatoes and cut butter.  Low rating because 2 of my kids absolutely hated it, (but one loved it). Husband gave it 4 stars.

This is a really good recipe. I use diced red skinned potatoes instead of frozen hash brown potatoes. I also suggest cooking it at a higher temp (400 degreees) because the cheese on top takes too long to brown at 350 degrees.

I added some chopped up bacon and it was really good. Mine did turn out a bit dry though. I think I will double the creamy sauce mixture next time.

This recipe was a hit at work my functions! Everyone was asking, who made it. The only thing I do differently is instead of canned potatoe soup, I get the packaged mix. I probably use almost double the amount suggested. I will def be using this again!

Absolutely delicious! To make this five stars, all you have to do is use fresh potatoes. But it will be a crowd pleaser either way.  I've been making this recipe for over 15 years now and it is always very well received. Thank you, Linda!

I always do a Brunch for New Years, my husband is allergic to eggs, so typical Brunch casseroles are off limits.  I add cubed ham, change nothing else and he and everyone else love it.  I would suggest cooking the hash browns on the stove atleast half done, to ensure they are not mushy.

Excellent casserole! The only thing I did different was to add more cheese. (You can never have too much cheese in our family.) I made this for seven adults and two small children and could have made another half a pan. After dinner only one serving was left - and I bet the leftovers from this would be wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this for a potluck at my school.  The teachers loved it.  It is not that cheesy by is quite good with a slight tang.  You may have to cook it a bit longer to get the hashbrowns done.

My family loves anything with potatoes, and this recipe did not disappoint!  The only thing I changed was using cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of potato.  It was a good, flavorful casserole that I'm going to use at a Christmas brunch.

We liked this as a side with low-fat things served too.  It was just too rich and saucy to stand alone.  None of us (six) could eat more than one serving because of that.  I made it a second time with fruit salad in vinaigrette and that helped to cut the richness, but still, it was sort of over-the-top as far as the heaviness goes.

This was delicious!  I omitted the butter like many people have suggested, and it turned out fine.  I didn't really like the onion in it, so next time I will omit that as well.  Other than that, it was rich, cheesy, and very hearty.

This is wonderful. I could just eat this for a meal! I omitted the onion and used 3 cups of cheese. I also used cream of broccoli soup because the only cream of potato soup I could find had MSG. Campbell's Healthy Request does not.

My husband suggested this might make a better side dish rather than the whole dinner. It really tasted great, but I think next time I make it I will decrease the onions and sour cream, only because it was a bit much for my stomach! Still will make this again, definitley!

Every year at Christmas my aunt makes a potato casserole similar to this. I love it so much that I could probably eat the whole thing!!! It is SO yummy but if I ate it more than once a year I'd probably gain 50 pounds! Instead of putting crushed up crackers on top, she puts on crushed up potato chips, which complements the whole potato theme. Yummy!

I thought this recipe was wonderful, it tasted just like a baked potato smothered with sourcream and cheese. Very good.

Add corn flakes with butter on them and it adds a nice twist to this great recipe.

Extremely easy and tasty recipe.  My husband thinks that it would taste better with a little more cheese, but each to their own!
