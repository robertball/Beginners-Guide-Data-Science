Great recipe, I used black beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans.   Also added a small can of tomato sauce because it seemed too thick.  The whole family loved it...  a definite addition to our rotation.

This was really good for such an easy recipe.  I did alter slightly by omitting the corn and adding some green pepper and chopped garlic.  I feel foolish that it never occurred to me to use salsa as a chili base, thanks for sharing!

This is a very easy to pull together slow-cooker recipe, and the finished chili is tasty, hearty as its name implies, and a hit with my husband.  I used a combination of chili beans and black beans which came out so delicious.  Also a dollop of sour cream on top with the cheese added a creamy delightfulness!

Incredibly plain and boring.  The cheese brand is one of the worst available.

I have learned that I am not a big fan of having salsa in chili, so that is definitely what affected my rating.  I ended up adding a little each Worcestershire sauce, garlic, paprika,  cumin.   My family did like the final result.  :)

I am not a big fan of chili in the slow cooker.  I have always been the kind of person that enjoys cooking over a stove.  I found this recipe though and all my preconceived notions of chili and how to cook it.  This recipe is a rave with my family and friends and has become a staple of my menus and I love it.  Thank you for giving us this recipe!!

I really love this chili!  It is not hard to make and the ingredient list is not 12 feet long! I am not a really spicy type person, so I like that this chili is not to spicy, just right. It has a great flavor and my hubby loved it too.  We are having leftovers tonight!!

This was a good chili.  I used a medium salsa, as my husband likes it spicy.  Would try a mild salsa next time to see if it is as good.

I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand for this, but I made it as close as I could.  Like another reviewer, I am not a fan of salsa in my chili so I left it out.  In it's place I used 2 cans,undrained  diced, fire-roasted tomatoes.  I did use just kidney beans 2 cans, drained because that's what I had in my pantry.  When it looked like it needed to be thicker in consistency for my taste, I didn't have any tomato paste like I would normally turn to, instead, I used 1/2 a can of pumpkin(not Pumpkin pie) to it.  It was awesome and worked like a charm :-)  I actually got the idea from the SPICY PUMKIN RECIPE from my ALLRECIPES magazine!!!!  Until that recipe, I had never even considered pumpkin as an option!  I would definitely make this again.  In fact, I put some of the leftovers into the freeze for later!   yummm

I tripled this recipe. I made it for a large group of people and everyone loved it. I used garbanzo beans, kidney beans, and chili beans (included garlic and pepper mixture). I also used more chili powder then it asked for to give it more spice. As I was browning the hamburger I was also adding garlic salt to the hamburger. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Delicious and easy, however I prefer to eliminate the tomato sauce and use one 28 oz can of peeled crushed tomatoes, and one 15 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I also used two pounds of ground beef, and elected to use one can of black beans and one can of white beans, eliminating the corn.  The next time I will also increase the chili powder a bit, as it was not spicey enough to be classified as a chili for me.  Very easy to adapt to one's personal tastes.  Hubby loved it, too.  Thanks for sharing!

Reminded me of the chili I had growing up. I've made this recipe many times since finding it. I only made two changes to mine. 1) I did without the corn. 2) I added roughly about 1/3 cup of hot sauce for a lil extra something. Of course if you aren't crazy about heat, you can start by adding a few drops here and there and let it simmer for an hour, taste-test it, and go from there to your personal liking. A little heat is nice for this. Enjoy.

This is one of my absolute favorites and is always a big hit with the family or guests. Everyone always mentions the corn in, but loves the variation. Very little left over when serving 4-5 people.

My husband & I really liked the meal. I used kidney, pinto & black beans. Instead of the tomato sauce I used a 28 oz can of plum tomatoes, which I squeezed by hand to mix up & a can of diced tomatoes. I also added garlic salt to the hamburger as I browned it. Yummy!
