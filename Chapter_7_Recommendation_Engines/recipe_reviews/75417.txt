These dates are served at a downtown tapas restaurant in Atlanta; a friend of mine who raved about them taled me into trying one although I have never particularly cared for dates.  I am so happy I did.  These are wonderful, easy to make and your guests will be coming back for more - that is if you want to serve them to guests - I might be inclined to keep them all for myself.  A good glass of red wine and you have a real treat!

Note: the restaurant mentioned grills theirs to the point where the bacon becomes blackened on the top. Either way, if you grill or bake them, I suggest doing so on a rack so that they don't sit any grease that comes from the bacon.

I read all of the reviews before making this recipe and decided to try all recommended variations because it is such an easy recipe. I have to say, either way you go, any variation is delicious: blue cheese, ricotta, gorgonzola, adding brown sugar, wine reduction and almonds. BUT...I think my favorite is the bacon rolled in brown sugar, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese with a wine reduction. It is much tastier with the brown sugar, believe me! I think my second favoriate was the dates stuffed with ricotta. But regardless of the cheese you use - you can't go wrong, I would definitely add almonds to the mix, as the crunch is very nice. Enjoy!

These are absolutely heavenly! I did a test-run before the party... my guess is they'll be gorgeous with a champagne cocktail or a nice white wine (even a Chardonnay might be good). I tried some with Old Amsterdam cheese (like Gouda) and some with almonds - both turned out great! I used Medjool dates, which are very plump and rich. Also, I found that there was no real need to use a toothpick - the bacon stayed wrapped by itself. Lastly, I baked them on a broil pan so the bacon grease had a place to drip into. I can't wait to serve these to my guests! :)

I did make modifications to mine since I don't like blue cheese, so my rating doesn't apply to that part.

It's a great base recipe to try different stuffing in the dates. I used feta and slivered almonds and they fit perfectly in the dates.

The cooking and the directions worked great.  The cheese stayed put and the dates were delicious.

I used skewers and put 5-6 dates on one skewer to save toothpicks and the amount of time I had to flip each date.  I just had to flip the skewers and it was easy to pop the dates off and put them in a dish.

Putting them on a skewer also helped keep the bacon stay put.  

So tasty!  Thanks for sharing!

These were good, but the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds were by far the bigger hit at the party ... even the blue cheese fanatics prefered the "crunch" of the almond stuffed version. Good, but will stick to the other (which were easier to work with as well).

I've always ordered these at one of my favorite tapas restaurants here in Chicago. So this past weekend I decided to make some for a cocktail party I was hosting. Instead of blue cheese, I filled the dates with slivered almonds and baked them for 20 minutes in a 450 degree oven. They turned out crispy and delicious. A HUGE hit with my guests.

I stuffed the dates with smoked almonds and blue cheese, then drizzled a red wine reduction over them just before serving. Sooooo yummy!!

I make these for any occasion, and they are always a hit.  However, I would suggest pre-cooking the bacon at 400F for about 8-10 minutes, just to partially cook it so its pliable.  I'm not a huge fan of grease so I pat dry the bacon, then wrap around the dates stuffed with blue cheese (pick a soft mild blue cheese, St. Agur is always a good choice), then bake for another 10-12 minutes at 400F.  This prevents burning of the dates and cheese, but ensures the bacon is cooked.  Make a lot, people will congregate and eat many.

This is a great basic stuffed date recipe.  The blue cheese married with the sweetness of the dates and the salty bacon is delicious.  For a wonderful variation, try mixing half cream cheese and half goat cheese instead of the blue cheese.  Even picky kids will eat these sweet treasures!

I made these for my Super Bowl party and all I can say is WOW! This was a huge hit with everyone! I have to admit, I don't care too much for blue cheese, but I still made this per the recipe. The flavors were wonderful. The blue cheese is not overly pungent and the sweet flavor of the dates mixed perfectly with the salty flavor of the bacon. This all worked together to create an extremely rich and complex flavor, sweet enough that you could almost serve it as a dessert instead of an appetizer. This is definately going to become a party favorite at my house!

Another variation: stuffed with (1/3 the fat) cream cheese and diced dried cherries or dried cranberries.  Always a hit!!!  Weâ€™ll be trying with Bleu Cheese for Thanksgiving! I typically slice the date down one side and pipe the cream cheese mixture into the middle, start with the end of the bacon, roll the date until covered once, cut, then seal with a water soaked toothpick. Enjoy!!!

Outstandingly amazing with Manchego Cheese! Use Medjool dates! I stuffed mine with Manchego cheese and sliced almonds... wrapped them up in bacon and sprinkled brown sugar ALL over them. The Manchego cheese, almonds and brown sugar made ALL the difference in the taste with these!  
Gourmet entertaining appetizer!

Made this exactly as instructed. AWESOME. Only recommendation: DO NOT USE CHEAP BLUE CHEESE!!! Don't use "Treasure Cave" or any other kind of blue cheese that looks dry or made for crumbling into a salad (I've done this recipe a number of times with different blue cheeses). You want moist blue cheese that can easily be shoved into a date. Something with a little stickiness to it. Otherwise, the cheese just crumbles everywhere and is difficult to stuff. The moister cheese melts a little bit more, so if you can't get the bacon entirely around the date, you lose some of it, but don't worry...it still tastes great...and most of the cheese stays in there. I don't bother with the toothpicks usually (I wrap the bacon so the ends are on the bottom) but tastes great either way.

Amazing! I put brown sugar on bacon after wrapping and let them sit overnight in the fridge before baking- divine. Put one half marcona almond in each date (along with the blue cheese). Bacon held them together fine- no toothpicks needed. Cooked 20/10.  Also served the chevre figs (which were much quicker to make- these took 1 hour total to make & bake- the figs took 6 minutes total)- both were equally adored. You can make both for the same event and daze & amaze people- TWICE!
If you get the fancy nitrate free etc... bacon, it will only make about 20-24 appetizers. So you will have lots of leftover dates. I used my extra dates to test this recipe out with turkey bacon (note: nowhere near as good as with regular bacon, but still tasty) and the turkey bacon made a lot more appetizers. But I still have leftover dates. So maybe adjust recipe to say 1/2 pound dates. Final note: definitely use a 2 tier system to bake (I used  cooling racks over a baking sheet), and definitely put aluminum foil on the bottom tray, as otherwise it will take forever to clean the bottom pan. And be prepared for a giant huff of smoke when you open the oven at the end. It's pretty wild. Have windows open and/or fans on. :-) Amazing recipe! Really sensational! Thank you!

I made these this past Christmas and am pulling it up again for the recipe, so thought I would review.  I used Mejdool (spelling?) dates and stuffed with a mix of chopped smoked almonds and blue cheese.  I let the bacon soak up some brown sugar before I wrapped the dates.  I used thin bacon and had no problem with it cooking in 30 minutes, 15 minutes per side.  I used skewers and put several on a skewer on a broiling pan to let them drip.  TO DIE FOR!

Delicious, beautiful & impressive!  A must try! Just for fun I brushed them with some apricot jam that I added a dash of cayenne pepper to first (brushed it on during the last 10 min. of baking) and it raised these beauties to a whole new level of fabulousity!  With or without the glaze, they are awesome!  Enjoy!  :-)

AMAZING!!!  I used Gorgonzola cheese and I had super thick bacon so I could get away with using only 1/3 piece of bacon for each stuffed date.  My husband who isn't a huge fan of either dates or Gorgonzola loves these tasty bites!  I think adding a slivered almond would be a lovely addition and I will have to try that next time.  If you can, bake on a broiler as another reviewer mentioned - my tin foil lined cookie sheets was okay but I burned my fingers twice on the bacon grease when flipping half way through.

Just served these at a very fancy musical event. Big hit. Easy to make in advance but I baked just prior. No matter how people are dressed, the smell of bacon brings them running.

I turned the dates at 20 minutes and took them out after 10 more minutes and the bacon was almost burnt and most of the cheese melted out.  Next time I will not cook them as long and/or lower the oven temp to 350.  Glad I wasn't making them for guests.

I did this one stuffed with feta and an almond and wrapped in the bacon.  They were excellent.  Several people said they were unsure if they would like it but were glad they tried them because they were so good.  I used precooked bacon so it was crispy and not greasy.

YUM!!! very easy and VERY tasty! i made these for an appetizer on thanksgiving. i cut the bacon into 4ths because my dates were kind of small and i didnt want it to wrap around more than once. i also baked them by placing them on a cooling rack, then placed the cooling rack on a foil covered cookie sheet. that way they wernt soaking in bacon grease and the bacon was crispy all the way around. cant wait to make them again!

Made 2 full bags of dates and they were gone within 20 minutes at a relatively small party with LOTS of other foods. The sweet date coupled with the savory blue cheese and then wrapped in bacon..... AMAZING!! I bake them for 20 minutes on one side and 10 on the other...if you allow them to brown a bit more they sort of carmalize and taste really good too!

I was really excited to try these, but they ended up being just okay. I had problems with the cooking time. After 40 mins the bacon was not cooked, but the cheese had started to spill out a bit. The cheese ended up with a hard, overcooked texture instead of the creamy, melted texture I was hoping for. It might have been better if the meat was was thinner so the cook time could be reduced - pancetta might be better. I do agree with others that the smokiness of bacon adds to the flavour. Probably won't make again, but if I did, would do some experimenting.

Whether you stuff them or not, these are delicious! Being Canadian, I think they are even better when served with maple syrup for dipping!

These are awesome! I used feta chesse instead since I'm personally not a big bleu cheese fan. I only wish I had made a double batch, maybe even more than that! They went fast and no one at my party could get enough of them!

These were great! Everyone loved them. We also tried them with almonds instead of blue cheese and blue cheese with almonds and everyone liked the plain almond ones the best. I will definitely make them again!

These are amazing. They take a bit of time to prepare, but the nice thing is that you can always stuff the dates, wrap them in bacon and then stick them in the fridge for a bit before baking and serving. Serve these and you will get rave reviews!

I made these as an appetizer @ Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit! I am not a big fan of too much Blue Cheese so I mixed it with cream cheese and the blue cheese wasnt so strong. SOme reviews said the toothpicks werent needed but it sure makes it easier to flip them over half-way through cooking. The review that said to use a pan so that the grease has somewhere to go was a great tip. I think I may try this the next time using a different kind of cheese and maybe some brown sugar. Thanks!

This was a great appetizer and none were left by the time we had dinner. I basically used the same recipe but substituted cream cheese for the blue cheese and also  baked another batch  without the cheese. I prefer the pitted Deglet Noor dates  because of the great combination of flavors. I tried the Medjool dates but they needed to be pitted and they were a little too meaty. To me, the combination of flavors with the Medjools didn't come through. It's a very quick recipe so try it at least once.

Everyone loved these, I will definately make again and again.  I used a thin slice maple bacon, for faster cooking, had it in my head that  goat cheese was req'd when shopping and the goat cheese was wonderful.  What an explosion of flavour.  This reciped is quick and easy - make ahead and have ready to pop into oven.

These were very good!  I couldn't find pitted dates, so bought some nice Medjool (?) dates, sliced them open, removed the pit, and stuffed with goat cheese (I don't care for blue cheese).  I wrapped them with applewood smoked bacon, secured with a toothpick, and then put them on a rack in a pan and baked.  Mine took longer than the 40 minutes...more like 45 I think, but ovens vary, so watch them carefully.  I did not have any problem with cheese leaking out like some others mentioned.  I tried one soon after removing them from the oven, but I actually liked them better after they had cooled.  I even tried one straight out of the fridge this morning, and it was good!  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

I really don't want to give this recipe one star, as the idea of blue cheese, bacon and dates just sounds absolutely scrumptious -- I am, however, forced to give it one star, as I have tried this recipe twice now, and both times the blue cheese falls out of the dates during cooking!  I have tried ensuring that the date is completely closed and rolled tight with bacon and a toothpick, but the blue cheese still seeps out during cooking and burns up on the bottom of the pan.  :(  So sad because I would love to have this recipe work for me -- any advice as to how to improve the methodology of date wrapping would be very much appreciated!

These are awesome-i only wish they looked more appetizing.  I cooked them on a roasting rack so they didn't taste greasy, and rolled them lightly in brown sugar.  I made the mistake of not stuffing them fully enough with the blue cheese-- some of it melts out.

Bacon wrapped dates are the best "wrapped" appetizer there its....we did Little Smoke's, and marinated waterchestnuts. Will say the cheese oozed out, but they tasted Great!

I just stuffed mine with cream cheese. I also used the pitted dates from Sun Maid, by the grapes and prunes in the grocery store. I made one bag and that made a pretty good amount, I also made another bag the next day. I prefer using the toothpicks because it was easy for my guests to pick up and eat.

I made these as a Thanksgiving appetizer, they were gone within minutes! The textures blend well together (cripsy/soft), and the flavors (salty/sweet) also go well. I forgot to turn them around in the oven so they came out a little burnt looking, but still tasted good. Will definitely make again. I also used goat cheese and gorgonzola. Any soft crumbled cheese will do.

Delightful! My guests all loved it! Be sure to get larger dates that will hold up when cooked. I used proscuttio instead of bacon. And I also made a reduced balsamic vinegar sauce over the top. Great combo of flavors!

These didn't work in any way for me.  If you make this recipe make sure to get small dates (our grocery store only had large ones and they overwhelmed the whole thing).  Also get regular bacon (my fiance picked up some sort of smoked bacon and it didn't work with the rest of the ingredients).  I don't think we would have loved these even with perfect ingredients, but I think they would have been better.

This gets 4 stars because we ended up burning our dates. We even lowered the oven 50 degrees at 40 minutes, next time we will lower it again 50 degrees, but flip after 15 minutes and keep a close eye between 20-30 minutes, then i think they will be perfect. Adding the roughly chopped almonds makes all the textural difference in the world, do not skip!

You may think you don't like blue cheese or dates but you should still try this recipe.  They are addictive; salty bacon, sweet dates, sharp blue cheese. Yummy. If there was a way to fit more cheese into each date it would be a 5 star recipe.

My husband and I couldn't get enough of these on our Honeymoon in Spain...but they just did the simpler versions with just dates and bacon (they sometimes put a whole almond inside for crunch). I was so excited to try these!  We did 4 kinds to see which we would like best:  With Blue Cheese, With Goat Cheese, With Blue Cheese and Almond, and With Goat Cheese and Almond.  The results were:  Just Goat Cheese!  We couldn't taste the almond, nor did it give us the "crunch" we were looking for. The Goat cheese stands out more than the blue cheese, which tends to blend in to the sweetness of the date.  Can't wait to make these again---but next time I'll be keeping a closer eye on my oven, because the cooking time was a little off!

I really like these....a lot.  Used maple bacon and stuffed with the blue cheese and a whole salted almond.  Not too much trouble to make and worth the effort.  No issues with the cheese leaking out and turned halfway through cooking.  Will try some with blue cheese and some with goat cheese next time.  Very rich...2-3 per person is plenty.

Fantastic!  I made these for a potluck today and they went fast!  I made 1/2 with blue cheese and 1/2 with goat cheese - and both were loved!    Thank you!    Oh!  And my husband (aka Mr "I'll die before I let a nasty date pass my lips") was woofing them down last night before he had any idea what they were!!

Wow.

I made a test batch of ten of these tonight, and like the other reviewer, they are all gone. I sliced the blue cheese from a block, and used cheaper, thin bacon. I had thick cut bacon on hand but the thin stuff was perfect.

Do bake on a rack and monitor their progress.

Remove the toothpicks before presenting.

The perfect combination of salty, tangy and sweet!

I followed the directions exactly, using a broiler pan.  I turned them over after 15 minutes and thought to myself, "these look done now".  I should have trusted my instincts.  After 15 more minutes they were blackened to the point of being unedible.  Did anyone else have this problem?

Stuffed them with both blue cheese and almonds.  Used kitchen shears to cut open the dates and cut the bacon into thirds instead of half.  Everyone at the tailgate loved them even after they were not hot any more.

I prefer to make this recipe with some variety of hard cheese, such as Asiago or aged Gouda, because then the cheese won't melt out of the dates. I also like to roll the bacon out more thinly with a rolling pin so they cook faster (12-15 mins), or if I really feel like splurging I get Italian bacon at the deli. Nevertheless, I think it will probably be very good with blue cheese as well, and I'll definitely give that a try one of these days.

A huge hit at a party today! I have nothing to add to these reviews, other than I used ricotta and slivered almonds instead of bleu cheese. I'm sure this would be delicious whatever cheese/nut combo you choose to stuff with!

I used goat's cheese instead of blue and they were phenomenal! I have a few dates left out - I will try the blue this time - can't wait. I already know they're a 5!

DELICIOUS! Although I may have not used enough blue cheese because I couldn't really taste it. However, they were still so good and totally killed at the holiday party. Make double or triple what you expect people to eat.... mine were all gone in 10 minutes!

I have used proscuitto instead of regular bacon and I much preferred that.  The regular bacon is just too greasy for my preference and it really overwhelmed the other flavors.  Even though it was more expensive, I'd use proscuitto again in the future.

A party favorite!  A little time consuming, but unique and yummy.  I used 1/3 slice of bacon to wrap each date, and didn't find the need for a toothpick.  I tried broiling them, but the bacon curled up - baking them was perfect.

I made these last night for a party, and they were a huge hit.  I thought blue cheese would be too potent with the other flavors, so I substituted goat cheese.  I also followed recommendations to add toasted almond slivers, but they were completely lost in all the other big flavors - I'll skip this next time.  I cooked mine on a grate over a baking sheet, which was fantastic for allowing the fat to drip down and keep the bacon crispy.  I didn't need toothpicks because the dates were so sticky.  One pound of bacon was perfect for a 10 oz container of dates.  I didn't know what to expect with this recipe and tried it on a whim, and even as I was assembling the dates, I wasn't convinced that they'd be any good, but I will *definitely* make these again.

We had these at a Christmas party, so I had to try them at home.  Delicious!  I did find that cooking time, in my oven at least, needed to be about 10 minutes longer.  Use a broiler pan so that all the grease from the bacon is drained away.  Gorgonzola cheese is great in these!

Yummy.
NOTE:  make sure you add TOOTH PICKS to your ingredients list. Some cool Gold-flake ended, EDIBLE ones make at a small store in Toronto were amazing and took this recipe over the top. (plus, just in case you get them all prepped and don't have enough on hand at home, or don't keep stocked with them regularly...LIKE ME!! :)  )These were a hit! I did with almonds AND blue cheese and the red-wine reduction not he plate for dipping. thanks for posting!!

This is the perfect blend of salty sweet flavor and it is very easy. It just takes a bit of time to construct them. I actually replaced the bleu cheese with Gorgonzola cheese since my husband doesn't like the strong flavor of bleu cheese. It worked out great! I did try it with Parmesan flakes once, but didn't turn out well. It seems better with the softer cheeses. When you make them, expect them to disappear fast.

I can always count on bringing my plate home empty when I take these to any event.  I use blue cheese crumbles, add an almond, and to cut down on the fat and mess of the bacon grease and to shorten the cooking time, I partially cook the bacon in the microwave, then top or stuff the date with a small piece of bacon.  This preserves the saltiness and chewiness of the bacon, decreases the cooking time, and the dates are warmed instead of cooked to a somewhat hard consistency.

Very good, but definitely will cook for less time.  The blue cheese was non existent when it was complete.  Might try cooking the bacon partially or just cooking less time.

These were the first to disappear at the super bowl party. I thought I might have over-cooked them a bit but everyone LOVED them. I personally couldn't taste the bluecheese flavor (maybe because my cheese melted out and burnt itself...), but the savory/salty crispy bacon with the sweet date- AWESOME. Next time, I'll try not cooking quite so long...

I was so excited to try this recipe, but unfortunately was disappointed with it.  I used blue cheese, almonds (per other reviewers), and then wrapped with bacon before cooking.  They actually looked terrific when they were done, but I didn't like the flavors at all.  Maybe I am just not enough of a date fan to enjoy this, but the date was overwhelming in my opinion.  I noticed that it did taste better once cooled to room temperature, though.  Thank you for letting me try this recipe though.  I'm glad I finally gave it a try!

My mom made these for New Year's Eve, and they were delicious! Very simple to make and very well received. I LOVED the sweetness of the date with the sharpness of the blue cheese and the smokiness of the bacon-flavors that complinented each other VERY well. These will definately be made again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Nice concept, but something went wrong with mine--all the blue cheese melted out of the dates and made a smokey mess on the pan. We still tried them, and what blue cheese flavor was left over did taste good. I'm just not sure how you are supposed to keep all the cheese in there and bake it long enough for the bacon to cook. Will not make again.

Tasty! I had a problem with the cheese melting out while they were being cooked.  Next time I will cut more of a "pocket" into the side of the date rather than cutting it in half, then making sure the cut is facing upwards during cooking.  Didn't need to toothpick mine together either.  The bacon wrapped onto it and stayed fine during cooking.

Tried them with MAPLE bacon, OMG! Thank you for the tip on placing them on a rack so they're not sitting in oil, very helpful! I filled mine with crumbled gorganzola and some with cream cheese, some with both. Incredible! Thank You!

Wonderful! Complex flavor from a simple recipe; I especially liked how the bacon aquired a candied chewiness during cooking. I added almonds for a little extra crunch. Bacon slices can easily be cut into thirds rather than halved. Cooked 20 min, turned and cooked add'l 15; they came out perfect!

I made these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner. They received rave reviews and I think the entire platter was gone in about 15 minutes! I used the crumbled bleu cheese from Trader Joe's (which made stuffing much easier) and added the slivered almond to some of them. I also used Boursin cheese in some of them (you can also use Rondele or Alouette). Mmmm.

Excellent appetizer!  I made this for Thanksgiving and people loved it.  Instead of putting 4 ounces of blue cheese, I put 2 ounces of goat cheese and 2 ounces of Mascarpone cheese - taking it from Giada de Laurentiis' recipe.  The goat cheese and Mascarpone gives an expensive taste to the appetizer.  A true winner!

You must use a broiler pan to let the grease run off otherwise you have a real mess.  I added slivered almonds to the blue cheese and coated the bacon with a layer of brown sugar prior to cooking.  The brown sugar cuts down the salty flavor of the bacon.   Guests had lots of "mmmm's" while chewing them up! Good cocktail party munchie.

Served these at Girls Night out last night and the consensus was that they were awesome! I only had chunks of dates as opposed to whole ones but just wrapped the gorgonzola in the date pieces and wrapped in 1/2 slice bacon. I will do again and use whole dates! Yummy!

Delicious! The only reason I'm rating it 4 stars is because some thought the blue cheese was too strong. I didn't think so. Also, a third of a bacon slice is enough to wrap the dates. I used Point Reyes blue cheese and thought it was devine!

These are good, but substitute the blue cheese pecans. They add a creaminess that cheese somehow never gets. YUM!!! Just stuff 2 or 3 in there and you're golden.

I made these exactly as written and thought they were quite good. They went over well with everyone. The blue cheese is subtle, and the combination of the sweet date and salty bacon is delicious. I think I would try some of the suggested modifications next time, especially the brown sugar on the bacon. I think that would put it over the top. But as is, it is an excellent, classy appetizer. Thanks!

Wonderful appetizer; even if you don't like dates - you will! I only used about half the blue cheese this recipe called for but WILL NOT do that again. We didn't get the full blue cheese flavor so it was just a tease ;). These were the first things finished off (very quickly) for my party.

This recipe is fantastic! I tried something similar while eating out at Cheesecake Factory, and wanted to duplicate what they had served, so I used gorgonzola cheese. My advice is to use the bacon you wrap around the date to plug up the ends and get the dates completely covered, because a lot of cheese melts out, and that flavor can get lost. I also baked them on broiling pan to drain the bacon grease away, and that worked out really well.  Thanks for helping me recreate a restaurant favorite!

I made these for Christmas..I was not able to find whole dates so i got the chopped dates. I added those and the blue cheese in my food processor to get it to stick together then rolled the mixture with the bacon...EVERYONE loved them!!!

I'm SO GLAD I found this recipe! My first time hosting "a holiday" and these were a huge hit! I took 2  reviewer's advice and used medjool dates, and used gouda for the cheese. I will be making this often!

Fantastic recipe though I had to tweak it. Might be because I'm in Australia, ingredients are a bit different. Modifications:     Use fatty bacon. I tried using bacon with fat removed and it turned out dry and crispy. The taste is phenomenal with fatty bacon opposed to fat removed. If you have leftover non-fat bacon, add with it strips of leftover fat, this way still pretty good.    Half the dates. Maybe the dates here are massive (though I think they are imported from USA). Too much dates you can't taste the cheese and bacon combination with date.    Unimportantly, I baked them using satay sticks instead of toothpicks for cost and ease. I also didn't turn them. Don't think they made any difference.

I had these as an appetizer at a restaurant stuffed with parmesean cheese and I loved them! I decided to make my own batch, and since I don't personally care for blue cheese I decided to go with what I knew and used small chunks of good quality parmesean. I cut the bacon in thirds as recommended and placed a rack in a baking pan to keep the dates crisp and they turned out perfect! I will make these any chance I get

This is so easy to make and very tasty. I went to happy hour at a local restaurant and had bacon wrapped dates and thought...I can make these myself, so I found them on this website! They are even better than what I had at the restaurant..plus happy hour price was $5 for two and I just made 32 for $12

These were very delicious with a couple of adjustments. Blue cheese is too bitter in our opinion so we used Capricho De Cabra, which is a nice creamy Goat Chesse, almost like cream cheese.  We also only cooked them for 25 minutes and our bacon was a nice crispy texture. Next time we think we will try using a hickory smoked bacon to complement the other sweet flavors.

I followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out very well.  The blue cheese melts well, the tang blends with the sweet of the date and the crisp salt of the bacon is heavenly.  This is a very unusual appetizer and will definately get your guests talking!  Everyone at the party liked the appetizer, however it seemed to me "missing" something.  In the future, I will add a toasted almond with the blue cheese to give it a crunch (overall the consistency is too smooth).    I also made a small batch with the same sauce from the bacon wrapped waterchest nut III recipe (available from this site).  It was loved just as well.    The only reason this recipe didn't get 5 stars is it is more difficult to make than most appetizers, but very much worth the little bit of extra trouble!

Delicious! Both savory and sweet! Using a pastry bag or baggie clipped at the end is best for stuffing the dates with cheese. Be sure not to over cook these little babies, they burn up rather quick!

These were really delicious!! I made them as my first official appetizer for a party and was suprised how good they tasted. I did however make the mistake of baking them on a flat cookie sheet which made a greasy mess at the bottom of my oven, and I did over cook them just a little; so I recommend keeping a good eye on them in the oven and using a pan that will catch the bacon grease. They are also a little time consuming to stuff and wrap if you're in a hurry so I also recommend planning ahead when making them. Overall one of the tastiest app's I've ever eaten.

These are sooo good! 1 pound of bacon cut in half gave me 24 strips so therefore only made 24 servings versus the 32 listed. I stuffed them with goat cheese instead of blue and they were yummy.

These are good, but try inserting small pieces of parmesan cheese instead. A local wine bar does them this way and they are the most popular appetizer on the menu. Much better and they will FLY off the platter.

These are great, but instead of blue cheese I put ricotta cheese.  I put it in a zip lock bag and then cut a tiny corner off and use it like a piping bag. This is like the one served at our favorite tapas spot.

Fantastic. I use precooked bacon-1/2 strip per date. I use the toaster oven. Much less fat. Also feta cheese is good as well. For those who do not eat meat you can omit the bacon and add an almond or pecan.

I've had them at a greek restaurant (Neo's) in the Seattle area. They stuff them with a slice of Serano Pepper and drizzel with Balsimic. I have since made them with no stuffing, and with Serano stuffing. I think the Serano stuffing is best as you get the smokey bacon, the sweet date and mild heat at the end from the Serano. Drizzling with a little Hickory Smoked Balsimic just made them better.

12-24-13 Yum and eaten in a flash! We didn't add any extra sweetness beyond the date and only used goat cheese for the stuffing. We also used about a third if a slice of bacon to wrap them. These are now a Christmas staple.

This recipe is awesome. I used goat cheese and the second batch and it was just as wonderful. I didn't need to bake mine for quite as long as the recipe says, so I would suggest keeping an eye on them. Yum!

These turned out great! Even the people who were hesitant because of the the blue cheese LOVED them. By mistake I only used half a date, but I was able to make more and the size was perfect.

One of my favorite things to make for parties.  They are always a big hit, even with my friends that don't expect to like them.  Just be careful not to over cook them because if the dates burn they have that bitter burnt-sugar taste, which just ruins the whole thing.

I make these every year for our 4th of July party, and everyone loves them! I use goat cheese and add in a smoked almond. They are very rich, but so very delicious. They cook very well on a bbq, too!

Yum yum yum! And can I just say...YUM.

I used goat cheese instead of blue, and cooked for 30 minutes. I also used thick-cut bacon and it was quite a bit bacon-y, but that was fine with me (although next time I will use "regular" sliced bacon).

They were delicious, and such a "wow" factor too! Everyone was so impressed. Directions were easy to follow. I will certainly make again.

I made these for my family at Christmas. They are a bit time consuming but worth it in the end. The sweetness of the dates, the saltly bacon and the rich taste of the blue cheese make your mouth water. This is definitely an appetizer that I will serve over and over during the holidays.

Fantastic!  I actually didn't use bleu cheese as I didn't have any, but these were great none-the-less.  I cooked a little longer until the bacon was crispy, but I think you have to be careful not to let them get too hard.

What a great appetizer! I wasn't sure how these would go at my party but I was SHOCKED by the response- Warning- don't try to reheat them in a hurry- they will shall we say caramelize..These are a sure hit!  I cut my bacon into thirds too!

YUM! I made these for a potluck Christmas party and they were gone immediately.  I personally wasn't as pleased with them at room temp as I was when they were hot and gooey, but no one else seemed to mind.  A little labor intensive, but will probably make again.

Watch these, they will burn easy. Also, try goat cheese instead. It's a little sweeter. The blue cheese was a little bitter for me.

I've tried this stuffed with chunks of great parmesan cheese.  I too could eat them all by myself.  I'm sure any cheese would work well.  It's the sweet, salty, caramelized chewy goodness that is soooo addicting. YUMMY!!

Can it have 5 stars times a million??? These were AMAZING! I used gorgonzola and cut the bacon in thirds (rather than half). They baked on a broil pan for maximum grease drainage for 25 minutes. I served them with one cup of balsalmic vinegar and a clove of garlic which I reduced. They were so delicious that the dipping sauce wasn't needed at all.

The play on salty and sweet just can't be beat.  Delicious!  I cut my bacon in thirds and that seemed like the right size to wrap the dates in.  I did half a batch with regular bacon and half with Morning Star vegetarian bacon.  I cut the vegetarian bacon in half and that was the perfect size to wrap the dates in.  Don't precook this stuff because it will get too crisp when it cools, and it will be impossible to roll the dates up. Not as tasty IMO as the bacon, but a nice treat for vegetarians who might be missing that smoky salty flavor that comes from bacon.  Mine got too black because I followed the directions for the first 20 minutes. Next time I'll do a shorter initial time to bake.

Delicious!  I think 1/2 a slice of bacon for each date is too much, though. Next time I'll only use enough bacon to circle the date once.  I tried with blue cheese in the inside and with almonds on the inside.  I liked the blue cheese better but both were good.

I made 3 kinds - blue cheese, almond, blue cheese & almond.  I am a huge nut fan, love the crunch they deliver to any dish, but I preferred the blue cheese version best, followed by the combo, and last just the almond.  I do wish I had been more generous with the blue cheese, though.  I sprinkled VERY little brown sugar across the top, but would've preferred without - the date provided enough sweetness.  These were ok, but I don't think I'll ever make these again.

Very easy, simple ingredients, and yummy, yummy, yummy!!!  I used the black label bacon and cut each slice in half. Feta or Manchega cheese would be good if you don't like blue.  I ate them cold out of the fridge the next day- even better!!!! I didn't use any other ingredients like vinegar or sugar; it was perfect just like this!  The only caveat: Make sure you have plenty people to eat them, or otherwise you WILL eat them all by yourself.

These are all the rage - the smokey flavor of bacon with the sweet date and the tangy blue cheese just can't be beat!

Great party treat!!  I served these at my SuperBowl party- everyone asked for the recipe.  I used feta since my crowd wasn't a blue cheese fan and I also put an almond in each date.  I wrapped the dates in bacon and then sprinkled some brown sugar on each one prior to putting them in the over.  It also might have helped that I asembled them the night before so they had time to marinate in the bacon and brown sugar.  I will definately make them again!

I put almonds in the middle instead of the blue cheese and this was a great app.  Everyone RAVED about it.  I would probably roll the bacon in a little brown sugar to give it a nice glaze.  This is was a popular one!

I had bacon wrapped dates at an appetizer & wine party 2 years ago and loved them!  I was so pleased to find this recipe so I could recreate them!   I did try to skimp on the bacon to make it go farther.... only used 1/4 a piece for each date but that was a mistake. You definitely need the savory flavor of the bacon to counter the sweetness of the dates!  Also very good even without a filling...  This is such an easy thing to make ahead, freeze or refrigerate, and cook when you need them.... Definitely a keeper- Thanks!

Wow...fantastic!  And so easy too.  I went the optional route and added almonds.  Next time I may crumble the bleu cheese and the almonds so I can mix them together before stuffing the dates..may save some time.  I also tried parma ham, but it was too time consuming since the pieces are extremely thin and hard to work with...switched to bacon and assembly went much quicker.  Absolutely delicious..I'm going to bring them a Christmas party!

This is a beautiful, tasty and sophisticated appetizer.  You can also add an almond inside the date (along with the blue cheese) and it creates a nice texture contrast to the creamy date/cheese.  This is an unusual and gourmet addition to any party.

This is one of those "why didn't I think of that?" recipes!  So simple, delicious and different!  I love them with cheese (the gorgonzola idea is great); when I do them with almonds, I roll the bacon in dark brown sugar before baking. Thank you!  I am always on the hunt for something a little different in appetizers!!

These tasty bites were such a hit the first time I made them....I am making them again for New Years.  The combination of sweet, tangy and salty is the best.  They took a little longer in the  oven to get the bacon toasty brown.

Stuffed the dates as full as possible with the Blue Cheese,  After they baked, you could not even taste the Blue Cheese, they were good anyway.

I love dates! Lots of people, however, have never tried dates or only had them in a dried/diced form. I had trouble getting people to try them, if it wasnâ€™t for the bacon I think more folks would have turned done having one. They were a hit though!

I agree with some that you should pre-cook the bacon to about 2/3 done. It helps avoid overcooking the dates and cheese. Try baking the bacon (400 for 10 min) as it keeps it flat and easy to roll - then maybe another 10-12 mins at 375 after assembling... I like using Gorgonzola

These went over very well at a dinner party we attended.  They did take longer to bake than the 30-40 minutes to get the bacon browned.  I also made another batch with parmesan cheese stuffed with prosciutto.  They were just as good!

These are my new go-to app. to bring to parties. They hold up well if you make them ahead of time. The salty bacon paired with the sweet date and tang of blue cheese is so yummy.  I've made them with goat cheese as well, just as good.

These were so easy to make and my guests devoured them in minutes.
I used Goat Cheese instead of bleu cheese.  One of my guests said she uses an Almond instead of cheese and they are delicious, too.
I made a huge batch ahead of time, freezing 1/2 of them for another day (or when I want them all to myself!)

This is my go-to appetizer for events.  It takes a little time to stuff and wrap the dates, but itâ€™s not complicated.  I spoon in blue cheese crumbles and press slightly before wrapping each date.

I made the recipe as is, but the blue cheese gets overpowered by the date and bacon. You cannot really taste the blue cheese at all. I will try almonds next, and then I want to try this again with a stronger cheese that might go toe-to-toe with the other ingredients.

This was a solid appetizer on new years eve that was the first to go amongst the dishes I brought. My only change next time I do it would be to be more aggressive stuffing the dates with blue cheese. Also, get more bacon because you'll have plenty of dates and blue cheese to still go around by the time you run out of that first.

These are delicious and rich!!! I had them in a restaurant and this recipe would be just as delicious but I made a couple of errors.   I used deglet (smaller) dates - need to get mejhools instead.  Also need to check so they don't get over done and the bleu bakes out - again probably because I used too small dates and over cooked.  The only thing I would add is to cook on a sheet where the grease can drain.  Odd combination that many people think they won't like but they're deiliciois!!!!

I've made this at least five times over the last two years, and it's one of my "signature dishes" for any big event or family get-together. I recently gave the recipe to my aunt who has also started making it for special occasions! I personally like to use gorgonzola cheese (the milder taste is more harmonious with the other ingredients) and sprinkle them with brown sugar for a nice, sweet glaze!

I made half of these one evening and was disappointed.   The next day I made the rest of them and they were fabulous!  The difference?  Make sure you cook them long enough!  Yes, your oven will get smoky but that's okay.  You want the bacon to be nice and crispy.  I also agree with the previous suggestions of covering your baking sheet with aluminum foil and using a cooling rack to bake them on.  I also didn't feel the need to use an entire half a strip of bacon per date.  One third is plenty.  I also did not use toothpicks and, for the most part, they stayed together just fine!  Will definitely make again!

Can some one tell me why my blue cheese melted OUT of the dates can caused a brunt mess in my baking get sheet?!?!? the bacon and dates cooked perfectly only the cheese, even after sealing, leached out of.the dates and burnt in the pan causing a hollow hole in the dates. very frustrated!  made before going to a party and so upset they came.out this way. Any help as to what I did wrong would be most appreciated.

These were killer. Definitely shoot for closer to 30 mins than 40 though. At 40, mine were a little too browned.

I added smoked almonds and roasted them on a rack over a sheet pan as several people recommended. The blue cheese all melted and dripped out, so you couldn't taste that at all. Not sure what I did wrong. Also, I think the dates I had were quite large. The result was that they were tasty but overwhelmingly sweet and rich with not enough salty to balance it out. They were also a bit dry.  I love the idea but it didn't come out perfectly for me.

I must say the dates looked beautiful!  My tasters were polite and said they were good, but they preferred my other offerings more.  Seemed to me like the blue cheese and bacon were fighting each to be the dominant taste, but neither won.  I must say I pre-fried the bacon before assembling the dates and baked on a raised wire rack.  Based on public reaction, I would not make these again.

I stuffed the dates with gorgonzola cheese and almond pieces.  Unfortunately I  overcooked them and much of the cheese oozed out but the bacon was crisp.  We tasted a sample and it passed so we took to Thanksgiving dinner as an appetizer. They disappeared before anyone else arrived.   Teens and adults loved them.  I will make this again but time it better.

Wow, this recipe was ON POINT but didn't specify how much cheese. I followed the recipe as stated, pitted the dates with ease with a crab pick, sliced in half, used my thumb to create a vessel for the cheese, filled each date all the way with cheese (will pour out a little) or I recommend filling it 2/3 of the way so it doesn't all just melt out.

If you want to make it even easier, pick a hard cheese (e.g. Parmesan), slice into rectangles, and just insert into the pitted dates.

Forgot to turn the over at the halfway point, served for apps during thanksgiving. Easy and delicious!!

Made this with hardwood smoked center cut bacon, medjool dates and blue cheese. Absolutely perfect and so simple to make. Cooked it at 400 degrees for about 20min (made 10). Each person can really only eat about 3 or so because it's so rich in flavor. There's no need to cut the dates in half--just slice  on one side and cut out the seed, then stuff the cheese in the hole with your fingers, wha~la!

These are super easy to make. However, I had to cook them for 30 minutes, turn them over and cook for only an additional 10 minutes. I have a brand new oven, so maybe it cooks faster than others? Other than that, no changes.

Dates or figs, it doesn't matter. You stuff it with good cheese and wrap it in bacon and you are bound to get good results. I did dates stuffed with goat cheese andwrapped in bacon with a balsamic reduction drizzle.

 Tip: Par fried the bacon and drain very well before wrapping. It will reduce the time in the oven by half.

Guests ate them all! Added almonds and brown sugar like one reviewer said. Would suggest baking on a baking rack so they don't burn cooking in their own grease.

I made them (not cooked) the night before and then cooked just before serving.  Easy and delicious!

Tip--if you have long nails, wear gloves.  I ended up with so much bleu cheese under my nails my fingers smelled for hours.  lol

I enjoyed it although I don't usually like bacon or dates I found this to be a good blend of the two. I did not use the blue cheese but I did not feel like I was missing anything so if you don't like blue cheese or can't have dairy don't worry this recipe is still worth making. I am not sure if i would make this again unless I was going to a potluck or party but in all pretty good.

These are deadly - in the best way possible. Make them. You will be glad. My husband loves them and they are always a hit when I share them with friends. I make them just as the recipe states. Definitely put foil down in the pan first. Makes cleanup much easier.

I used the Deglet Noor dates, used a half and half mix of blue cheese (yes, the cheap crumbles) and wasabi almonds.  I cut the raw beef bacon into 3 pieces, "painted" each bacon section with garlic paste, sprinkled with onion powder and cayenne.  Rolled up the stuffed date, used a tooth pick to hold it together and baked in an aerated meatloaf pan.  It was great and everyone loved them.  I've already made them 3 times!

40 minutes was too long, I bet 30 minutes would have been better.  I made this with different kind of cheese too.  I made them with jalapeno cream cheese, brie and plain.  They were all great! I wish there was a sauce to go with them...

As always, I was running late to a family party and had to bring an appetizer. So I made this recipe but, because I had no time to grill, I used prosciutto instead of bacon and didn't cook the dates at all (prosciutto is already cooked). Nevertheless, they were the first thing gone at the party. I can't wait to try it with the bacon. Delish!

I made these for Christmas Eve appetizers with family over, and I made some with goat cheese, some with blue cheese, and others with no cheese.  All were delicious, and they do well for reheated leftovers for a quick snack.  Very tasty---they went quicker than other appetizers that we had out.  A keeper!

After the rave reviews on how good these were I had to try them. However I was disappointed. I stuffed half of the dates with blue cheese and half with almonds. We really couldn't taste the blue cheese. Couldn't really taste the date. I didn't find the need to secure them with a toothpick. Bacon at room temp wraps nicely around the date. I placed the appetizers on a cooling rack inside of a jelly roll pan for even baking. The oven got smoky so I covered them loosely with aluminum foil. Everyone liked them, but I wouldn't make them again.

Yummy!!! We are not big Blue cheese fans so we made 1/2 with feta & 1/2 with goat cheese. They turned out great!!! I also made a few with veggie bacon (since I don't eat bacon) & they also turned out good.

I make it with Almonds and omit the blue cheese. The almonds make it excellent tasting; crunchy, sweet salty! Well loved by everyone I make it for. They are gone in minutes.

Delicious!  You have to really watch these toward the end of the baking time, I let mine go a minute or two too long and they were a bit burnt on the bottom.  Still tasted good though!

This is an amazing simple recipe.  However,  I used Parmesan cheese which i think is a better flavor combo then Bleu Cheese. Also watch the bacon closely because i think that it tastes a little better with the bacon softer than crispier.

A family introduced me to the dates wrapped in bacon close to 10 years ago - How unique I thought it was!  I have never seen it at any restaurants here in Mass.  It is such a Huge hit everytime I make them (and I get requests to make them at every holiday!)  I cant wait to make them with various cheeses and almonds.  I have used the Maple flavored bacon at times but will definitely try plain bacon with brown sugar! Thank You!

I made these for a party and they went quickly. The blue cheese was good, but I had them with almonds before and they were slightly better.
