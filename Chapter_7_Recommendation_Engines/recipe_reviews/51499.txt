I live in Maryland and crab dip is ever present...this is a classic.  I prepared exactly as written with the exception of adding more Old Bay and it needed to stay in the oven a bit longer than 20 minutes to warm completely through.  Served it with hot pretzel sticks we picked up from the local hot pretzel bakery.  Looking forward to the left overs - would work well over grilled chicken (Chicken Chesapeake)!

Ingredients say creamy salad dressing. Instructions say mayo. Are we talking miracle whip or actual salad dressing. Or is it a typo and just mayo?

This crab dip is a winner. Used canned lump crab meat from Costco, about 2-1/2 cups. Also added 1 jalapeno pepper, deseeded & diced and 1 teaspoon paprika. Served over warm Italian Salt & Pepper Pita Chips & crackers. Youâ€™ll luv this and so will your guests if looking for a special occasion appetizer.

Yum! Looking for more flavor? I added 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, doubled the old bay, 3 tablespoons chopped green onion and mixed the cheddar cheese in so it wouldn't harden on top as others suggested. Super tasty!

I'm born and raised just south of Baltimore so I think I know a thing or two about crabs. I made this dip for opening day Ravens game and everyone loved it. They went through that pan like it was their last meal and asked for more. I liked that it was very easy to make.

Awesome recipe. And - guess what? Throw all that stuff in the crockpot for a party and watch it disappear. People were fighting over licking the bowl! Marylanders: Double the Old Bay

Just loved this one.  I added Asiago cheese with the crab and cream cheese and put the cheddar on top.  I added sherry to it just because sherry and crab are so simpatico.  Also, taste this one as you go along.  I like it with a bit more spice to it than the recipe calls for.  This is every bit as good as the crab dip I used to get in Annapolis Maryland and that's saying something.

Yummy! I made it with "krab" -- I know it's a sin but I like it -- and otherwise used the other ingredients called for.  I'm eating a half batch for dinner with water crackers.. Mmm diet food.

This is a very good spread for entertaining. Worried about it getting cold before guests can eat them? Don't! They taste even better at room temperature.

Awesome, simple crab dip recipe. Changes I made: added 1 jalapeno, extra old bay and some paprika as other reviewers suggested. Also used canned crab, drained SUPER well, and used regular mayo instead of miracle whip or creamy salad dressing or whatever (I have used regular mayo in a lot of dips and it always works fine). Great flavor and the cheddar cheese crust was delicious! If you serve it at room temperature, I recommend mixing the cheddar cheese in because it hardens if it's on top and makes it hard to dip. Served with Hawaiian Luau chips. Awesome!

I am born and raised minutes from the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and I am a crab dip fanatic. This recipe is good, but I suggest using about 6 oz of the cheddar and mixing it in, as well on top. Also, about triple the old bay seasoning is more on point with a true Maryland crab dip.  I also added a dash of italian seasoning.  I used eggless mayo, as well. Unfortunately,  I had to use canned lump crab meat, because I now live in a land locked area that doesn't even sell the fresh stuff. Anywho, it's delicious and reminds me of home. This is a good base recipe to go off of, it's versatile,  and easy to tweak. Next time, I may even add some artichoke hearts to the mix.

Next time I would double the old bay and Worchestire sauce...I think I'd add some of the cheese to the crab mixture as well.... Very good but needed a little kick...a shot of tobassco or two may do the trick... Needs played with more but all in all a definite winner

This crab dip was a big hit at our house, especially with my son-in-law who is from Maryland. I was happy to find a dip recipe that wasn't dominated by the taste of mayonnaise. I tripled the Old Bay seasoning, added a pinch of kosher salt and added half the cheddar cheese to the dip. I forgot to put the other half of the cheddar on top, but we didn't miss it. My family has already asked to have this again over the holidays!

It tasted delicious, but was a little bit "oily" - perhaps from the cheese on top, but was enjoyed by everyone.

Having lived in Baltimore, there's no such thing as too much Old Bay so be generous!!  I also added garlic, splash of lemon juice, splash of white wine, salt, pepper, and skipped the cheddar cheese.  Next time I will also add scallions.  This is actually best made the day before so the flavors have a chance to mesh.  It can be reheated so it is warm for serving, but cold with tortilla chips is just as good.

This is the perfect family gathering appetizer. Such a fantastic, well-received dish and it's pretty! You can make it in a loaf pan or you can cut up a baguette and once you've mixed it, put it directly on baguettes and top with cheese. I sprinkle with parsley and cook 20 minutes in the oven and it's perfect.  I made a double batch for our Christmas gathering and it made a LOT of appetizers but they went quick.

Hey everyone I'm new at cooking, I always say I'm trying to domesticate myself :) my dip was a hit the only thing I noticed that didn't seem to bother anyone else was it was just slightly watery. Not so much the dip itself but after taking a spoon full there would be a little pocket of water left behind... Is this normal? I followed the directions pretty well and didn't deviate...Any ideas? I'd love to try this again!

I needed to bake the dip for longer than 20 minutes listed in the recipe. I wouldnt do anything less than 30 minutes. The creamy dressing refers to mayonnaise in the recipe itself. This was extremely overrated at 4.9 at the current moment. I probably wouldn't use this recipe again.

This was a very good Maryland-style crab dip.  I cut the recipe in half because it was just my husband and I.  I used mayo instead of the "creamy dressing".  I also doubled the Old Bay like others suggested, then sprinkled just a bit on top.  I threw in some leftover corn that was freshly cut off the cob (for crunch and a touch of sweetness).  Lastly, I stirred the cheddar cheese into the mixture like others suggested, then put a little tiny bit extra on top.  I think the corn was a really really good addition, I'll definitely do that again.  Even after doubling the Old Bay, I still think it could have used more, so we'll increase it next time (personal preference).  I served it with soft pretzel pieces, and that turned out to be really really yummy!  I'll definitely be making this again with my tweaks.

I thought it was pretty good, but next time I will double the seasoning, as some people suggested, and maybe add some paprika.

Excellent recipe. I made it for a pot luck luncheon at work and everyone loved it. I will make this again. The only thing I did different was to add 3 teaspoons of Old Bay instead of 1. Great recipe

I made the dip for Thanksgiving and changed the following: added 1/4 cup of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing and doubled the Old Bay seasoning. It was a huge hit, with everyone  requesting the recipe.

I wasn't sure about the creamy salad dressing i used a mixture of light mayo  & Ranch dressing the result was excellent.  It makes a party size appetizer

Made as directed, but did drain the crab first as another reviewer pointed out. I think that was really key to getting a good (non-watery / gloopy) dip. This was fantastic!

Thought I'd need to double it for a large crowd - no need! It's so rich that one batch was plenty for 15.

This was really watery. I expected it to be a little more firm. I even baked it longer. I thought it needed more flavor too. Sorry, won't be making again.
