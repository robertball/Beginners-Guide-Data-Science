The base flavour was good, but it was way too spicy for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and 4 of my kids were in tears from the spice.  Even after we added sour cream to their bowls, it was still a struggle to get them to eat it.  I'm giving 3 stars because it's a good starting point.  Next time I make it, I will cut the spices in half.

Not a lot of taste considering how many strong ingredients are in it. Easy to make though (and I am a serious novice) and there are lots of leftovers. Good for a random Wednesday dinner, but I wouldn't bust out this recipe for company.
