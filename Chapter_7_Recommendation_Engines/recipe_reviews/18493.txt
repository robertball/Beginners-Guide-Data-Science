Making ornaments with this dough is a lot of fun and the result smells delightful! 1 1/2 cups applesauce to 2 cups cinnamon works for me to get a clay-like consistency. Dust hands with cinnamon for handling. You can add a teaspoon of cloves, ginger and allspice to round out the fragrance. To get them dry quicker, bake on an ungreased cookie sheet at 150 degrees for one hour. Remove from the cookie sheets and bake on the oven racks for another hour and a half. (Don't roll thinner than 1/4 inch if you're using this method.)

I made 200 of these ornaments as placeholders for my company xmas party, and they were a big hit.  I bake mine in a slow oven (175 degrees C) for 2 to 3 hours, and it definitely makes your home smell delicious!

My family made these this year for our Christmas tree and to give out to friends and family.  It was fairly easy to work with and kid friendly (I have a two year old and a one year old.)  We put the dough between two pieces of wax paper to roll it out.  We used a straw to make a hole for the ribbon and we also baked them in the oven as was suggested by the other reviews.  I did have a problem getting them off of the cookie sheet- because they weren't completely dry, so be patient, eventually they do dry!  We made about 60 ornaments and the only suggestion I can think us is to make sure you don't roll the dough too thin.  At least a forth of an inch or so.  We bought our cinnamon at Walmart- it was only .50 a bottle and we used 5 bottles.

This is a terrific recipe, my kids and I have made it for years and years. One variation that we tried this year was to melt hard candy in the center of the cookie cut outs. We just cut out the middle of ceratin cookie forms (simple shapes work best) put some crushed hard candies in the center and melted them in the oven. Make sure you spray the cookie sheet so they dont stick. They look like stained glass!! Lots of fun and they look and smell great!!

This recipe is good but I add a bit of white glue to mine to give it a little added strength.

This has quickly become our Christmas tradition.  The kids first made these at school and for the last several years we have made them at home.  We poke holes in them for hanging on the tree or gift tags.  When they are dry we spread the dining room table with newspaper and paint them.  T-shirt paints with the fine line tips are great for kids to handle and make small details with.  These ornaments will give your home and tree a wonderful scent.  Friends and family love to receive them on their packages as tags, you can paint on the name of the recipient! Tip: Shop the "dollar" stores for cinnamon.

as stated, this is easy and fun as a family project, gift tags, or car scent.  There is a cinnamon flavoring sold in Walmart in the crafts section of the store called LorrAnn sold in dram bottles for $1.97.  A drop of this cinnamon oil (on the ornament) will refresh these ornaments with a big BURST of cinnamon smell that will last, and last and last...

We made these when my son was in the 3rd grade.  He is a senior this year and they still smell great.  I store in a ziploc after the holidays.  We hang a garland in the doorway and the ornaments from it.  When you walk through you just feel good from the homey aroma.

This was a fun project.  Definately use something larger than a toothpick for the hole - (we ended up needing to drill a larger hole through all of ours) - a straw would probably work better.  Got the cinnamon at Sam's Club for a little over $3 (exactly 3 c.).  Took about 3 days to dry if not baked.  I would cut them at LEAST 1/4" - probably a bit thicker.  We used fabric paint to decorate and craft paint.  They turned out really cute!  My 5 yr old and 3 yr old had a blast.  Also, after paint dried I used spray polyurithane on both sides to preserve.  I was worried it would interfere with the smell, but it didn't.  All the relatives loved receiving these from the kids this year!

Made 100's of these as package tie-ons, tree ornaments and even hung them in our cars on the door knobs as air fresheners.  Great recipe.

I used this same recipe to make gingerbread garland families.  After each piece was made, I cut a paper clip in half and inserted the end into each hand.  After drying and decorating, the hands then got tied together with raffia.  I used "puff paint" to decorate and each "person" had their name printed down the front.  I found that laying them out to dry was the only way to go.  They dried flat as opposed to bubbling in the oven.  This year I added a dog to one of the families.   One year I had a garland family with an egg that eventually got replaced with a little girl.  There is so much you can do.  Each garland has a heart cookie in the middle.  You can add a year or a last name.  They make wonderful presents for teachers etc.  Kids with hard-to-find names are thrilled.

I used my stand mixer to make this dough and let me just say, be prepared for a mess if you mix it this way...clouds of cinnamon deposited everywhere, but it was lots of fun.  This recipe makes A LOT of ornaments, could have halved the recipe and still had plenty.  The only alterations I made to this was to add 2-3Tbsp of white glue for strength and approx 3 tsp copper colored ultra fine glitter to the dough.  It just added a bit of sparkle to the dull cinnamon.

I loved the idea of these ornaments, but how do you keep the dough from being too sticky to handle? I had trouble getting the ornaments up and on the cooling rack once I cut them. It proved to be too much for the kids to handle and allow the cutouts to keep their shape. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

This is indeed a wonderful tradition.  3 things...you should definitely strain the applesauce a little and eliminate the extra juice.  I also always use a little white glue.  Last but not least, Instead of a toothpick to do the hole, I always use a straw.  It makes a perfect hole, like a mini cookie cutter, plus the stuff goes up in the straw and you don't have to worry about warping the figure.

Great project to do with my two-year old for Christmas.  Very messy for mommy, but lots of fun!  It made my kitchen smell like cinnamon for days...many, many days.  Once the ornaments dried, I used rough-grit sandpaper and sanded down the edges.  The ornaments turned out great.

After cutting out the shapes, I baked them in the oven at 200 degrees for 45 minutes. Afterwards, they were about 90% dry, which was more than enough to paint them and lay them out to finish the process. All in all, it all worked out perfectly!

We've made these a few times and they're always big hits.  We've put holes in them, prior to baking, and given them as car air fresheners.  We've decorated the baked ornaments with squeeze paint to look like gingerbread men.  The scent lasts a good long time and as long as the dough is a good 1/4 inch thick they are pretty sturdy.  One warning- the cinnamon is very drying so either wear gloves or kneed in a mixer.  Great scout project, or wonderful alternative to flour dough ornaments for those with wheat allergies.

I've been making these for years and this is the recipe I have always followed    The only addition I have is that sometimes, depending on the consistency of the applesauce you may need to add more 'dry' to it so that it becomes dough like.  I tend to put in just a smigeon of flour to thicken it and make it easier to roll out and cut!  The thicker you cut the ornaments, the longer they take to dry.  I put mine in the oven on parchment paper on the lowest heat possible for an hour twenty, then flip them over and let the air dry for the rest.  It takes a couple of days for them to be rock hard but it's such a wonderful gift!  These make amazing gift accessories for that perfect present!  Use them in wreaths or even on your Christmas tree.

These turned out very well! Well, most of them did. The ones that were at least 1/4 inch thick did great, but anything thinner than that and they cracked and split apart during drying. They were also really hard to cut because the dough was SO wet. I tried baking them at a low temperature, but the cinnamon smell was so overwhelming I had to give up on that after about an hour. I let them air dry, and it took about SIX DAYS for them all to dry and release from the cookie sheets. I'll definitely use parchment paper next time, and maybe a little glue to make them less brittle. I painted them with t-shirt paint (found at Wal-Mart in the craft section) and they turned out very cute. Will be using as gift tags for my nieces and nephews' Christmas presents. Thank you!

Wonderful! I agree with Tanaquil, I always use glue with my recipe. People love receiving these! I usually just do hearts and use a gingham ribbon through the hole. Thank you.

Oh, making these was too fun!!  I felt like a kid again.  I followed the 1-1 ratio shown here and used 1 cup applesauce and 1 cup cinnamon for mine, and got about 34 small ornaments/package tie-ons.  I used a small chopstick to poke a hole in each one, and will hang them on my tree and one in my car when they finish drying!  I decided not to bake them, so I will air dry them for a few days, turning them every day (as others on the Internet have suggested).  They smell great!  'course, my son came home from school, smelled them and took a big ol' bite out of one!  Ewww.  Do not eat ~wink~.  Thanks, Valerie!

Made these and sold them during a fundraiser.  Everyone asked if they were edible.  Couple of hints- "flour" your board and rolling pin with extra cinnamon so it doesn't stick.  I used glitter glue and a flat head tooth pick to make the holes for the mini ornaments.  A skinny stirring straw could work too. I ended up baking at 220 degrees with my oven because 200 took too long.  It will come off the pan when it is dry enough, if you try to scrape it off, it will crack.  The middle will appear dark on the underside if it is not completely dry.  Fun to do.

while this was a fun project with the kids, i was pretty disappointed with the final product.  unless you put it to your nose, you can't smell anything, and they're very weak.  you have to roll them out pretty thick for them to be sturdy enough to be tied with ribbon and hung.  i will look for another recipe to try next year.

We made these yesterday. They turned out beautifully. I only used 1c applesauce and slightly more than 1c cinnamon. Actually, I gave each of my kids an individual applesauce cup and there own mixing bowl and spoon and measured a heaping 1/2c cinnamon for them and set them loose mixing and kneading the dough. They loved making these. We, too, used straws to make the hole for the ribbon.

I'm going to say, this as so so for me. The end result for the 6 ornaments I got out of the batch did great. However equal parts didn't match up for me. I ended up having to use more and more and more cinnamon to get it to a ball like stage. Then the dough stuck to the counter top, so I put on wax paper..that was a mistake because then it didn't come off the wax paper. So then I used parchment. That seem to help but by this time I was getting flustered. So I decided to shake cinnamon on the countertop like flour and that helped a lot. But after one small portion and 6 tree cut outs. I gave up. Something is a miss here. I did see someone mentioning glue. And maybe that's it.  So I'll try again at a later time. And they did have a scent.

My son and I made these in heart shapes for Valentine's Day. We added some glue and some fine red glitter. Great gifts for Grandma, teachers, etc. They are still drying, but so far so good!

They turned out great and the kids enjoyed making them!  Also, once they are fully dried, they can be coloured on with crayons which was great for the little ones!

We dry ours in a dehydrator for a few hours and we buy our cinn at Winco in the bulk section. a pound cost us about $2.oo. Drying them this way makes your house smeill soooo good. The smells lingers for days.

This recipe was very easy. It makes a little more than 15 ornamements. I ended up with 45 and I still had dough left over. They were about 2 1/2 inches long and about 1/4 in. thick-a pretty good size. When I used the cookie cutters I ended up with that annoying "edge" around the cookie, so I moved the cookie cutter around in all directions and used a small straw for the hole and they turned out PERFECT! Thanks!

These smelled so great, I added a tablespoon each of nutmeg, ginger, and allspice. My husband was very dissapointed to find out that they don't taste as good as they smell! I also stuck them in a 200 degree oven for about 2 hours. I burned the batch that was on the bottom rack, so keep an eye on them if you dry them in the oven.

Great smelling-I added a little glue and extra cinnamon. Makes a wet paste that I smushed on my counter and cut out with cookie cutters. Took 3-4 days to dry and I did turn them once a day.

I made these for the Christmas tree at work with all my coworkers names on them.  Next time I will roll the dough a LOT thicker so they look like cookies more.  Mine were thin and when they dried they kind of curled up.  I loved making them, though!

These were amazing. Taking the reviews into account, I used 1 cup applesauce and 1 cup cinnamon and was prepared to use more cinnamon if the consistency wasn't right. Surprisingly, the ratio was perfect! I did bake mine, as suggested, and decorated them with glue and glitter or paint. I poked the holes with a straw. Thank you for a fun project! I am not sure if the scent holds, but we'll have to wait and see.

I have made these ornaments with my children, 9, 7 and 4 every year! I mixed 1cup apple sauce to 1 cup cinnamon until all incorporated, then add the 1/2 cup cinnamon. Use your hands to mix everything. Once mixed it will form ball and knead. I double the batch, use a straw to make hole before I bake. I am able to make 35 ornaments. I do not add glue or flour. When rolling out, I sprinkle cinnamon on table and rolling pin.  My kids decorate with beads and glitter. We add ribbon and done . Great tradition and family time!

This is the best recipe ever. It made a ton of ornaments too; more than the instructions say. I love how the ingredients are so simple and all natural. (I didn't make any substitutions) I let them dry on a wire rack and they took about 4 days to dry completely. (about 1/4 inch think)

I did as another reviewer suggested and used 1-1/2 cups of applesauce and 2 cups of cinnamon and it was the perfect clay-like consistency and I didn't have any fall apart.  Use a straw or toothpick to make holes.  I added a little allspice and nutmeg to the mix and baked at 150 degrees for 1 hour on a cookie sheet.  I went ahead and strung ribbon through the holes after they cooled and they dried the rest of the way hanging from my tree.

I believe you need WAY more cinnamon than applesauce for the right consistency.  I wanted to make these with my 4 yr old son for teacher gifts and that was maybe a mistake.  He was very difficult to work with. : )  They're in the oven right now but I'm sure they will be very nice when they're dry.

This were so cute on the tree last year.  My kids and I enjoyed making them and the house smelled wonderful for days!  My only complaint with them is that they are so fragile that there wasn't any use trying to save them for this year.  That's ok though.  They were easy to do, cheap, and beautiful.  They'll be a yearly tradition for us.

We added some glue to make them stiffer.  They are so easy to make!! This project was very kid friendly.  We used various cookie cutters and decorated them like ginger cookies to put on our candy themed tree.  They smell great but do take a loooong time to dry.

This was so much fun to make.  My daughter and I rolled them out and cut them with Christmas cookie cutters (making sure that the rolling pin was floured)and used a straw to make holes. After 3 days drying time we decorated them with puffy paint (icing) and strung festive ribbon on them.  They smell so good.  We will hang them on our tree and use them for gift tags.  We got a lot of ornaments from this batch.  One more tip we dried them on waxed paper to prevent sticking.

I have made these every Christmas since a friend of mine told me you can make them at home. They smell up the house so beautiful!  I love to make them just before our holiday parties or before guests come to warm the home.

I had to work a lot more cinnamon into the mix to get the dough to hold. Not sure how much because I made 1/3 of the recipe and just kept shaking more cinnamon into the bowl till I got a dough that was dry enough to work with. I also found that adding some white glue into the mix helped to keep it together. It smells amazing and 1/3 of the recipe yielded 8 (4") snowflake cutouts at 1/4 " thick.

Just did this.  So easy (for me).  My kids pretty much just had pick out the ornament shape they'll later get to decorate....I didn't have the time to really let them help as I have finals week coming up.  Boo hoo.  I placed just a bit of dough at a time between wax paper, just enough to make one ornament.  I patted the dough to about 1/3".  Lift the top layer of wax paper, then push the ornament-shape into the dough.  Scrape the excess from around the ornament-shape, slide hand under the bottom wax paper and gently flip ornament into other hand.  Lay onto cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  I used parchment paper on cookie sheet in case I have a hot oven and want to pop them in there for a bit to dry faster.

I made these with my two older boys when they were 6&7 (now 26&25), stored them in ziplock bag each year and they lasted till about 8 yrs ago. They talk about them so much that their 15yr old brother wants me to make them again. Definitely going to keep the cinnamon oil in mind this time. Funny how they're not so crazy about the expensive collectible ornaments I spent so much money on over the years and wanted to hand over to them for their own trees this year.....I guess those are my memories...I guess it's the old gift vs the box thing.  So I will pass on the recipe!!

Made these w my 4-year-old daughter today as a teacher gift tag/tree ornament!  Used to make these w/ my Kindergarten students and they were always a huge success! You have to roll them out thick, at least 1/2 inch thick and use a straw to poke a hole into them before you let them either air dry 2-4 days or oven-bake at 200 degrees for a couple of hours. Such a nice holiday tradition and a great recipe that you can scale as needed with a 1:1 ratio of cinnamon to applesauce, opting to use more cinnamon to applesauce as it can be a bit runny or pasty/sticky if you don't use enough cinnamon.  I used 1 cup sauce to 1 cup cinnamon!

I think the ornaments turned out nice, but the amount of cinnamon it took to make them filled the air like dust and made me sick to my stomach. Maybe I'm just really sensitive but the quantity of such an aroma was too much for me.

I have made these with my preschool class and also my grandchildren.  I found using a straw to make the hole for hanging, instead of a toothpick, worked better for me.  It was easier for the children to control to make the hole.

Just made these with the kids last night! They were too soft to use cookie cutters on and transfer to a pan, even after adding glue, so I added flour.  I did this before reading that people add more cinnamon to make them easier to handle. But the flour did the trick!  They look beautiful and easy for my 4 and 7 year old to paint with acrylics.  Such an EASY project. As for prep time..hardly any at all.  We will make this an annual project.

Very easy to make.  I scaled mine to 2 cups cinnamon and two cups applesauce since I didn't want to make that many.  This amount filled a large cookie sheet.  Rolled between 2 wax papers using a jar of spaghetti sauce because I couldn't find my rolling pin.  Made them a bit thicker to almost 1/2".  Used a straw to punch hole.  Baked on parchment paper at 200 for 2 hours.  Wish I had turned them over midway since the tops were dry but the bottoms still had damp spots but it wasn't a big deal.  Next time I will take another reviewers suggestion and bake on parchment lined cookie sheet for an hour then transfer directly to the oven rack itself for another hour to an hour and a half.  Will make again next year for sure!

This recipe was easy, accurate, and the ornaments turned out so beautifully!  They were old-fashioned and easy to paint with acrylics.  I baked them at 250 degrees for 2 1/2 hours and they came out perfectly.  Thanks!

These are so much fun to make and very easy to work with.  I use a bit less applesauce and I bake mine at 250 degrees for about 2 hours.  They certainly make your house smell delightful while baking and I hang them on our kitchen tree so that we can continue to enjoy the aroma there.

I made these for gifts for friends and they were a big hit - even with my friend who teaches a "Christmas Food Gifts" course at the local school. They will be a standard for me at Christmas.

What a fun recipe! Made these for all my co-workers and they were delighted. I took the suggestion of MBUENZLI and baked them instead of letting them air dry. They came out great and will definitely be making more of these in the future! Thanks for a great idea!

I love making these ornaments. There are so many different ways to incorporate them into your holiday decorating: 
hang from the tree, glue to a wreath, tuck into a cornucopia, etc.  Cinnamon can be expensive; but if you live near a Dollar Tree store, it's usually stocked year round.  And you can even find cookie cutters there, sometimes.  These are fun to make, preserve nicely, and make the house smell festive.

Thank You so much. The kids had a great time making these. I ran out of wax paper so I used a clean garbage bag; rolled the dough inside, cut the sides open and it worked great.

Overall very easy and great-smelling.  I had a little trouble rolling it out in the beginning, but the more I worked with it the easier it was.  I think next time I will add some glue as others have suggested to make them a little less brittle (the only reason I didn't give 5 stars).

I just received this recipe as an email from the McCormick site and they have that you can bake them at 200F for about 2 1/2 hours. They harden up nicely and you don't have to wait days to decorate them. Good recipe though :)
2008/12/6: I just tried to take them off the cookie sheet and they all stuck and broke :(  gonna make them again but this time I'll put them on parchment paper

Just made these today. Very easy to make, very sticky though. I just put them on a cookie sheet and there stuck so once there cooled I'll have to see what I can do to take then off. The only thing I didn't like about making this was the overwhelming sent of cinnamon in my house, at first it was nice but after baking for 2hrs WOW very strong. Still though the kids are looking forward to painting them tomorrow.
Dec 5,2009: Just took them out today and they still smell nice :)

These smelled good while baking and for a short time afterwards, but not as long as I had hoped.  A bit too much prep and work for the payoff.

These were so easy to make.  Rolled mine about 1/4" thick and got lots of ornaments out of this batch.  Baked for a few hours in a 180 degree oven, but still weren't completely dry for a day or two.  Made the house and oven smell great for days.

I'd like to make a correction.  I baked mine on gas mark 1 for 20 mins on one side and then 20 mins on the other side.  Then I air dried them for the rest of the day.

I made these ornaments with my girls (Age 4, 1 1/2), trying to start some family traditions of our own.   The smell in the house was heavenly.   The girls just could not understand why they could not eat the cookie.  All in all we had fun doing this together and I look forward to doing this through the years with them.

I use this recipe at holiday time to use in my classroom.  I prepare the cinnamon and applesauce dough at home to speed things up and this allows the students to be more creative.  We don't use cookie cutters, keeping it a hands-on activity (great for OT skills).  Letting the ornaments air dry over several days (students observing drying process), our classroom smells heavenly!!!!    Even after several years, my ornaments when given a little scratch, still smells so good.     Makes great homemade gifts that smell  so good!!!

Perfect Recipe. I added ground cloves but not sure it made any difference. It did feel wet when done, so i let it sit in the bowl for an hour and that helped let it dry up...then i moved it to a silicone mat and spread it out to dry further. After an hour of that, it was in a much better position to be used like normal dough. generously use cinnamon on the mat and also on top to get it to not stick to roller. when drying shapes, stars start to curl, so check on them after 8 hours and flip them upside down to dry. What is everyone using for the 'frosting'? Puffy paint? Any other options?

A group of  45 to 65 Elementary school aged Children or just your children either way this is a great activity an easy to do while creating something that will last as a keep sake year after year! I work for the Boys  and Girls Club of Cecil County an making these ornaments every year has become a tradition the kids absolutely love it. The kids who have been with us for years love to compare how much better there ornaments get every year ...... Just make sure no matter how yummy they smell the kids don't eat them!!!

This was too gooey and not roll-able.  I should have followed the proportion on McCormick's website, which calls for 3/4 cup applesauce to 1 cup plus 2 Tablespoons cinnamon.  This worked well when I added a bunch more cinnamon, though, and rolled it out with more yet.  The house smelled wonderful as they dried on a low temp in the oven.
