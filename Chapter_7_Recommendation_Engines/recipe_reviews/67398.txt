It tasted very fat free- not good! I make MUCH better- try this if you want almost carb free, with fat: 3 (8oz) blocks cream cheese- softened
      1/4 cup sour cream
      whip until fluffy and add any artificial      sweetener to taste.
      Beat 1 minute then add 2 eggs and continue beating til mixed. Add 2 tsp vanilla.
     Pour/scoop into (lined) muffin cups and bake 25 minutes at 350. Chill thoroughly before eating.

Excellent!  I made the following adjustments: I doubled the recipe and omitted the flour and vanilla.  I also used lower fat cream cheese instead of fat free and used "Egg Beaters" for the egg. (I think fat free cream cheese would negatively effect the consistency too much. It helps to beat the ingredients very thouroughly! This is a riccotta recipe, it is a "grainy" cheese which will show up in the texture of the final product.) I also added 1/4 cup lime juice and the jest of two limes to the batter. As we are low carb people, I used sugar free wafer cookies, pecans and Splenda to make the crust. Will definitely make this again and again. Highly recommended!

This can be a very satisfying desert for low carb eaters if made with a few adjustments.  I never use fat free dairy except milk because the flavor is bad.  So I used lowfat cream cheese and sour cream for this, same amount.  I added a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice and lemon zest of one lemon.  You MUST I repeat MUST put all ingredients into a blender or food processor and pulse for a few seconds to smooth the ricotta.  I let all the ingredients set in the refrigerator for a few ours as well to get more flavor and I followed the advice of one reviewer and made a crust of sugarless nilla cookies crushed and splenda and crushed almonds for the crust, I mixed with melted trans fat free margarine and packed into the bottom of the pie plate before pouring in filling.  Very good!!  Try it!!

I made this cheesecake as dessert option for both the southbeach diet, and the atkins diet.  Even after denying myself carbs for weeks this cheesecake tasted horrible. I recommend for people on low carb diets, the ricotta cheese desserts that require no baking.

This is a perfect "fix" for dieters and low-carb eaters/  I made a different version not using ricotta, and the texture is wonderful.  Instead of ricotta AND fat free cream cheese, I used 16 oz of fat free cream cheese and 1/2C fat free sour cream. The rest of the ingredients exactly the same. And 1/2 C graham cracker crumbs for crust, but that's probably not low carb. YUM!

I recommend  a change in formula.  Why use ricotta?  In the 1960's it was possible to get a "smooth" cottage cheese, and I used to make a very simlar cake with that, which everybody loved.  I've discovered that you can smooth out cottage cheese with curds if you have a good, strong blender.  So I recommend this: use a quart container of cottage cheese, 1 cup of low fat sour cream or Greek yoghurt, 3 egg whites, 1/2 cup granulated Splenda, and either lemon zest or vanilla to flavor it. You can add the tablespoon of flour or not, as you prefer.  It does help the cake stiffen a bit better. Blend all the ingredients thoroughly in a blender and pour the batter into a deep pie plate and bake. When the cake is close to being done, at about 45 minutes, you can add a topping of 1 cup of sour cream stirred up with 2T Splenda which you spread carefully over the semi-soft cake with a spatula, returning the cake to the oven for another 15 - 20 minutes. The sour cream topping is very nice, and some people might want to double the layer and bake it an extra half hour.  Personally I prefer cheesecake without a crust, so I haven't experimented with how to make one without carbs. We would rate our own low fat, low carb cheesecake as five stars.

My fiance and I are both on low-carb diets and we absolutely loved this cheesecake. I baked it in my toaster oven and it only took 45 minutes. I tried pouring a little kahlua on a piece and the cheesecake soaked up the delicious coffee flavor. It would be good with fruit on it, too. I am serving it for Easter dessert this year, and no one will know they are eating low-carb!

I used full fat EVERYTHING in the recipe, as I am only concerned about carbs-it was still almost unfit to eat.

Rarely do I post a very negative review, but (1)this isn't a good recipe, & (2) it's a horrible choice for people eating LC. To start, a cheesecake is, by definition, mostly cream cheese--one package doesn't cut it. Some have ricotta, but in a smaller proportion to the cream cheese. Why flour? I've never seen flour in a cheesecake recipe (except some crusts, but that isn't the case here). The addition of APF, even in a small amount, while calling this "low carb" is laughable. I just have to ask: why bother making any recipe if it doesn't taste good? Good news! You can have your cheesecake, and eat it too while sticking to LC. Anyone serious about LC should know that it works best when aim for low carb, high fat (yes, that's right), and moderate protein. The basic tenet of LC is that dietary fat doesn't make us fat (or unhealthy). Yes, some fats are worse than others, but attempting to reduce/eliminate fat is counter productive. Furthermore, low fat products are generally higher in carbs than the full fat versions. There are many LC cheesecake recipes online that are outstanding (look beyond this site). I'm proud to say that I made an LC lemon cheesecake (nut crust, sour cream topping, and lemon curd on top of that) and I've lost a couple of pounds in the 3 days since. Bottom line: There's no need to deprive yourself on LC, but cheesecake shouldn't be a staple your diet either.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year.  I thought it was pretty good concidering it was low carb, no sugar, and low fat.  Yes, the texture was a tad unusual for cheesecake but I will trade that for the guilty feeling of eating a real cheesecake any day! We added a can of cherry pie filling to the top.

I modified this recipe; used "regular" everything (Carbs are my thing) except the sugar, used the Splenda "sugar blend".  Also, I made a crust using 4-graham crackers & 2 T melted butter; added 1-T lemon juice and lemon zest (per another review).  I also used another suggestion and blended it in a blender.  It turned out delicious, creamy texture, light and fluffy...per my diabetic tong! :-)

Yes, I agree with some of the other viewers that the texture isn't smooth like regular cheese cake. If you can get over the idea of the ricotta texture this is really not bad. It doesn't have any flavor so next time I will add some lemon or other flavor. I was happy with it and it certainly did help with my craving for something sweet.

Excellent - but I changed it, and I apologize to start with, but here's what I did. 2 8oz. packs neufchatel cream cheese, 1/2 full fat sour cream, 2 whole eggs, 1/4 - 1/3 c. stevia that measures like sugar, 1/4 c. white sugar. 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. lemon juice. Baked at 325 in a regular pie crust until a bit brown and jiggly, but firm. Knife in the middle came out clean. 100% fantastic!

I found this recipe when I was looking for a dessert to use up a carton of ricotta. I did not use fat-free sour cream or cream cheese and I mixed the filling in my food processor. The texture came out pretty good but don't expect it to taste like cheesecake. Overall, a good "everyday" dessert.

Not good. I was expecting a different texture and could have dealt with that, but the taste did it in. It lacked the creamy bite of cheesecake, instead tasting like a bite of baked ricotta cheese, with a prominent, and unpleasant, stevia aftertaste. I made therecipe as written with the only difference being lower-fat cream cheese instead of fat free. I really wanted this to be good, but will need to keep looking. Sorry.

My low carb version based on this recipe was basically cutting the ricotta in half and replacing the other half with greek yogurt. For a crust at the bottom I used whole wheat flour mixed with cinnamon, nutmeg, splenda, and melted butter. I also replaced the all purpose flour with sugar free pancake mix. (worked very well and cut carbs)

not much flavor and the texture is weird. I used low fat ingredients instead of fat free, but is still a little bland and you can really taste the egg.

I really like this cheesecake. It is a lower carb version of an Italian Cream Cheesecake. FYI - Those that don't like the texture - it isn't because it is a bad recipe - that is how Italian Cream Cheesecakes are textured. It is because of the ricotta cheese in them! The second time around, I made this cheesecake with full fat ingredients to make it even lower carb. It turned out great. I plan on making this often as a part of my low carb meal plan!

I used full fat ingredients to make this a low carb dessert . The other way was way too high carb for me to enjoy. I also made simple sugar free lemon curd for topping. Also used almond meal instead of flour. Add it's written it's not low carb it's lower than real cheesecake but it's ok I modified. Just want people to know so they don't think they will lose weight as it's written.

Love this option as a low carb dessert. You MUST use a food processor to mix all ingredients. Any other method will leave a slightly gritty texture. My husband loves this recipe. For a true restaurant style cheesecake double recipe and use spring pan. Our favorite low carb topping is cutting up sugar free strawberry jello and mixing in with the creamy cheesecake. Not a great photo as someone ate a few pieces too soon ;)

I made this for a surprise My girlfriend is dieting and she is working so hard to change her eating habits I thought I would make her a treat It had to be sugar free. This is not the best cheese cake on the planet  but REALLY GOOD using the original ingredients
Thank You LBR8    PS If there others out there that aren't experts like some.. I found an old fashioned potato masher works well for mixing

Had this for my birthday, last month ( my sweety made it for me ), and I was very pleasantly surprised with it tasting so close to how my moms used to! Thanks for posting!
