Didn't have garlic or ginger paste so I used minced fresh garlic & shredded fresh ginger + fresh squeezed lime juice, etc.  Good flavor, moist and delicious, will make again.

Excellent!  Everyone loved this.  Went great with sides of "Grilled Sweet Potatoes with Apples" and "Grilled Portobello Mushrooms."  I couldn't find Garam Masala in our area, so went on the internet and found a "recipe" for it; Luckily I had all of the ingredients to make this "India Spice Blend" in my spice cabinet.

This is an excellent marinade recipe - my chops were tender & delicious - my whole family loved them!  I can't wait to try it on pork tenderloin, too.

So good! I was intrigued by the blend of flavors when I saw this recipe, but I wasn't it expecting it to be so delicious. I even messed up by adding the garam masala to the marinade and it still came out great. I marinated for about 6 hours. Really good served with steamed veggies and brown rice. I will make this again, thank you :)

The chops turned out tender and juicy, I marinated them for about 3 hours.  I was not thrilled with the garam masala, the cloves seemed to be a bit much for us, next time I will use less.  Good recipe, a keeper!

These were different and good.  Next time I'd probably add a little olive oil to the marinade as pork chops dry out so easily.

Very good pork chops!  We buy pork chops at Costco, and they are generally extremely thick, so I cut them in half.  I guess I cut these a little too thin bc bf complained they were a bit too done.  But that would be our fault, not the fault of the recipe. I marinated this overnight, then flipped so the other side could be in the marinade.  Bf grilled these when he got home tonight.  I made a couple of changes:  I used minced garlic (didn't feel like making garlic paste) and I don't have ginger paste, so I used dried ginger.  I also added some garam masala to the marinade itself, mostly bc I thought I might forget to sprinkle it on the chops.  I didn't grill them; bf did while I walked the dog, so they didn't get sprinkled with the garam masala.  So, I'm glad I added that to the marinade.  Very nice flavor, and it's enough marinade if you flip the chops but not too much so you have to throw out a lot of liquid.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've had this in my recipe box for quite a while, but wasn't too sure about the combination of ingredients. I have to admit that this was way better than I thought it would be! I followed the recipe exactly, and thought the flavors blended well together. I did the chops on the Foreman grill - they cam out moist and flavorful. Thanks!

This was a GREAT recipe! The pork chops were absolutely succulent! The only other pork chop recipe that I've liked better was one that was baked with apples.
I accidentally marinated the pork for three days so it was a little salty, but very tender and juicy. I also don't have a grill so I broiled it on low for about fifteen minutes and it turned out perfectly. Definitely a recipe that I'll use again!

Very good chops.  I like it because it's easily modified to what you have and how you can cook the dish.  Using fresh ginger and garlic, chopped finely, works just as well as the pastes the recipe calls for.  Even using dried and granulated garlic and ginger works well.  I use ponzu soy sauce, for even more citrus flavor.  I've grilled and broiled using this recipe and it works well both ways, but I prefer the char of the grill.  Good recipe!

So good! I loved the combination. I added chili sauce for a bit more heat but other than that I followed to a T which is very hard for me. A very good pork grilling dish - thanks!!

This turned out GREAT!! I actually made the sauce up beforehand and put with the chops in a freezer bag and just froze them. Then when I was ready, I just let the meat thaw in the marinade. I cooked them on my George Foreman and they were fabulous. Very flavorful and still very juicy...which can be hard with chops on the GF grill. Thanks...we will use this lots!!

Very tasty. Good blend of flavors. Next time I will follow advice from another user to add olive oil to the marinade. What kept it from getting 5 stars for me was that many kitchens will not have all the ingredients, specifically the garlic/ginger paste and the garam masala. We went with what we had and got close. And as I said the results were great.

I shortchanged myself and only had time to let the pork marinade for 30 minutes. Nevertheless, the marinade was very easy to make, and as long as you like ginger (I do), I really enjoyed it. I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli (which was good when drug through the flavored juices off the pork).

This was excellent. Very flavourful but not too spicy. Living in a small town I didn't think I would find the spice required, but was pleasntly surprised that they stocked it. We had it with BBQ aspargus and mashed potatoes. It was delicious.

Love this recipe!!!  My pork chops were so tasty.  I didn't have garlic or ginger paste, so I just added a tsbp of fresh garlic and ginger.  Also, added the garam masala right to the marinade, so that flavour would be throughout the meat, not just on the outside.  I can't wait to try this out on beef.

Absolutely delicious, & I'd have given this 5 stars were there no need to urge caution, as follows: 

Grilling 10 minutes per side may result in miserably dry chops. *Timing's dictated by the thickness of the chops combined with your grill's temperature.* Check every 4 minutes, preparing to turn & also to baste if necessary.

Am I really limited to 5 stars?? This was fantastic! I had to use ground ginger, because I didn't have any ginger paste. It gave the impression of sweetness, but wasn't sweet at all. . .I love both Asian and Indian food, and this blended them beautifully with the ginger and the Garam Masala. So yummy!!

Delicious! First time I had any luck grilling pork chops. Usually they're dry, but these were moist with crunchy grilled 'crust' and great flavor.

Very easy.  I made a mistake and added the garam masala to the maranade - in any event we liked the taste and I would make this again.  Served it with Aloo Phujia (Indian style potatoes and onions).  Forgot how great those potatoes are! Thanks submitter.

We loved these too! I used a jarred ginger/garlic combo and added some cinnamon infused olive oil I had on hand.  Also topped it with a sauce made by blending chopped mango, lime juice and some garlic chili sauce. Served with curried rice and some grilled zuchinni -YUM!

Wasn't too sure of the combo with pork, but the chops were delicious! The marinade kept them moist and tender (tip: buy the thickest chops you can find...mine were over an inch)  Must try, a nice flavor different from the usual BBQ or baked pork chops. Will make these again, for company!

Super-easy and super-tasty. A welcome addition to our regular rotation. I made my own garam masala a few months ago (I like Indian recipes a lot) and put it to good use here.

This was EXTREMELY GOOD!!!!! Especially since there were few ingredients and was relativley no work to marinate.  Mine did end up marinating 7 hours or so, since I could not get to them but it was all the better! Very Very Flovorful Chops.

These were by far the best pork chops I have ever had, not usually a fan of pork chops as i always find them a bit dry.  I marinated these for over 24 hours and they were extremely moist. Forgot to sprinkle them in the end with the masala, but still were full of flavor.

Loved the flavors, very unexpected for bbq pork chops.  I liked the spices from the Garam Masala mix but it ended up being too spicy for our kids, we'll just leave the Garam Masala off their chops next time.

I thought that the recipe was wonderful but i did add about 1/4 of balsamic vinegar to the marinate... everyone loved it...tasted better the second day as leftovers in my lunch.  Big hit with the inlaws!

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I didn't have time to go the Indian grocer to pick up ginger or garlic paste, so I combine equal parts of ginger and garlic and made my own paste.  I sauteed the chops as we've had a cold snap here for the past week and the highest temp was -9F (not including the wind chill) so grilling was not an option.  Perhaps I will try broiling them next time.

Everyone agreed that these are good pork chops.  I didn't use the full TBSP of garam masala - just sprinkled a little over the top.    I broiled them on Low for about 15 min.  Grilled Sweet Potatoes with Apples were a nice contrast to the spiciness of the pork chops.

I highly recommned this recipe! They are soooo easy, and have a wonderful fresh, lively flavour. My husband say this is the best pork chop recipe he has EVER tasted! We last served these with homemade fried rice, which complimented this dish beautifully!

Ok flavor, but way too much garam masala...did you mean 1 teaspoon and not 1 tablespoon? I used the "Spice Islands" brand garam masala and it was way too salty. Wonder if I would have gotten better results with a different brand?

FANTASTIC! And easy...what more could you want? I used a homemade ginger garlic paste (from this site) & I used key lime juice from a bottle because I need to use it up. I was only able to marinade for an hour & a half or so but the flavor still came through pretty good....loved the garam masala! I served dinner on the patio w/ the firepit blazing .... Brazilian Lemonade, this recipe, Savory Grilled Onions & steamed broccoli w/ butter. Somemore's for dessert. :o) Thanks for a wonderful recipe, INDIGOKING.

I thought I would give this a try as I always make my mother's reciepe, Southern style with lots of gravy and so delicious. But I wanted a change up. I found masala seasoning in my cabinet which must have found its way in the spice cabinet through my husbands travel to India. I followed the reciepe and marinated it over night. I did bake in a covered baking dish at 350 in the marinade. The masala seasoning is quite unique and very strong. The pork chop came out dry. Im asian, I am big on huge robust flavor and I like Indian food. But this was not for my palette. Sorry to say this is a thumbs down.

Tender and moist, these were good. The first time I did it was with garam masala and that was a lttle too much, I felt. So the next time I used less and it was better. I make my own Masalas, and actually I found the nicest to my taste to be a hot Parsi Dhansak Masala

I didn't have time to marinate as long as recipe suggested, but these chops turned out moist and delicious with a great sweetish flavor.  I served them with grilled vegetable kabobs that were prepared in an orangey-spice marinade.  Great meal!

I used 3 limes and 1 lemon to make double the marinade (for double the chops). I did not use garam masala as I didn't have it on hand. I used fresh minced garlic and ginger, and we grilled them. These were hands-down the juiciest and most tender chops I have ever eaten. They practically melted in your mouth. This is a definite keeper!

This was the best grilled pork chops recipe I have ever made! It was super tender and juicy. I only made a few minor adjustments to it. I added McCormick's seasonings to it and also a couple table spoons of brown sugar to carmelize a bit. I made it with steamed rice and carrots. Excellent! Will definately make again!

We loved this recipe!  I made changes for what I had on hand- lemon juice instead of lime and fresh ginger and garlic, and we broiled it since it was snowing too hard to grill outside.  We ate it with some curry apple chutney a friend made for us, and it was amazingly good!  It was also fast and easy to make, so bonus points there.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good (my boyfriend rated it 4.5 out of 5)...but not exactly what I expected.  I was somewhat skeptical of the amount of soy sauce, and concerned about the resulting flavor from the mixture of ingredients.  For my taste, it was too salty, and I will reduce the amount of soy sauce next time I try it. I served it with grilled asparagus and pasta/grains mixture from Trader Joe's.

Easy and quick to assemble.  I used jarred minced garlic instead of garlic paste and lemons instead of limes -- because that is what was in the fridge.  Grilled up nice, quick and was very tasty.  I served it with curry couscous and a salad making it totally easy and really fast to prepare.

Tasty!  Made these for dinner last night, marinaded for about 4 hours.  Pork chops came out moist and juicy, the lime juice adds a nice tang against the 'spice' of the garam masala!  Thanks for sharing.

I marinated 1 1/4 in. tenderloin chops for about 5 hours. It was too windy outside to BBQ so I put them in a pan along with the marinade and cooked them until they reached a temperature of around 130 F. I took them out of the pan and after cleaning out the pan and adding oil I seasoned the chops and finished cooking them with the Garam Masala sprinkled on them. They were pretty good but think I'll marinate them overnight next time. Looking forward to cooking them on the grill!!

These were great! I marinated mine overnight (the timing worked better for me) and seared them on the stove top for 5 min/side and finished them in the oven for like 15 minutes. Big bold flavors and super fast dinner prep. I'm a big fan.

Very good!  I used minced garlic and minced ginger made into a paste by smashing it with the back of my knife, fresh lime juice and soy sauce as written.  I, too, added some of the garam masala (recipe from this site) to the marinade as other reviewers did.  These turned out some very flavorful pork chops that we will look forward to experiencing again and again.

I made this recipe just as written.  My pork chops were not thick so I watched them very carefully on the grill so they would not overcook and  dry out.    MY DH raved about the flavor.  I will definitely make again.  The fusion of Asian and Indian was brilliant.  Thanks for submitting!

I had neither paste, but I did have garlic and powdered ginger. I squeezed 1/2 lime into about a teaspoon of each, added maybe 1/4 tsp of olive oil and stirred. Then I added the soy sauce. I had only an hour before grill time to marinate; therefore, I left it out on the counter (covered) to marinate a bit faster. Grilled each side 10 minutes (steaks were about 1 or 1-1/4" thick. Perfection. Paired it with roasted butternut squash, peppers & mushrooms as well as some semi-fried rice. Thanks for the delicious recipe.

This was super easy to make.  I did not have any ready made garam masala so I looked up a quick recipe and put it together to add to this recipe.  I also added some cayenne pepper for heat to the seasoning. I like it spicy.  Marinated the pork chops for about three hours. Don't have a George forman at home so I just pan cooked them adding some onions and peppers  for color. The flavors of this dish are amazing savory , tangy, spicy, Yum!!!

Only used one chop for my husband, it marinated 24 hrs. I broiled cause don't have a grill, they came out really tender and the seasonings were just right.  Thanks for the post!

Made this twice. First time I used recipe as instructed (except used grill pan inside), and it was very tasty and tender. Second time, I added some oil to the marinade, double the marinade quantity, removed the chops when done and used the marinade to make additional sauce. I deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth, then brought the marinade to a boil, and simmered for ten minutes. Wonderful! This is now on the "dinner rotation", served with rice and roasted garlic broccoli.

Super simple and tasty! Made a stir fry fusion version.
I didn't have garam masala but had curry masala. I used a pork shoulder and cut up bite sized. Marinaded mixture for 30 minutes and stir-fried in skillet. Added quarter of onion and mixture of red and green bell peppers. Covered on low for an hour. Once good and browned serve over rice. Meat becomes super tender.

Easy!  Instead of purchasing garlic and ginger pastes, I made pastes from fresh ginger and garlic.  The flavor was wonderful although I think 10 minutes on each side would have overcooked  my chops.

Used lemon instead of line because its what I had. Marinated overnight to infuse the flavors well! Super yummy!
