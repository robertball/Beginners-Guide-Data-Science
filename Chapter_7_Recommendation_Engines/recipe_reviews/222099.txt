This recipe was excellent, almost authentic northern bavarian,(German) thicker layer of bread crumbs on top yielded very moist and juicy chicken breasts  underneath. No Leftovers

Super easy, simple and tasty. 
I used low-fat Italian cheese and deli ham with Panko crumbs.
Just a lighter fare. Still came out juicy, pretty and very tasty

This was tasty and easy to make. My family enjoyed it and I will make it again. I used a combo of Jarlsberg and Swiss (I didnâ€™t have enough of either - thus combining!).
