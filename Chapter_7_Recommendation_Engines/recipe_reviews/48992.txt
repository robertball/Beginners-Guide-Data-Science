I made this today and it received thumbs up.  It's delicious but very rich, so I skipped the whipped cream and cherries.

This is a good recipe, and pretty easy to make. I did add a teaspoon of vinegar to the batter and I think that helped to make it a little more moist.

I found this cake a little on the dry side, which was disappointing after all the work it took to make it.  I did use fresh brewed coffee instead of instant, since I had a pot going...it saved some hassle.  I added a little rum to the cherries for the topping, which jazzed them up and emphasized the rum flavor in the cake.

Rich and delicious! Made it for my friend's birthday with a rum-flavoured whipped icing. Huge success!

Taste was great! very mocha... The cake came out a little dry but when I divided each round cake into half, doubled the icing recipe, and layered into four layers, the extra icing made up for the little bit of dryness.  I also added a small amount of ganche to top and let drip down for extra chocolate flavor.  Cake was a big hit!

After reading all the "too dry" comments, I added 2 TBSP of chocolate pudding mix to the dry ingredients and two heaping spoonfuls of sour cream. It was PERFECT!!!

I made mini cup cakes with the batter...baked it for 15 minutes at 350
I replaced butter with 1/3 cup of oil.
Added a total of 1/4 cup rum.
Substituted only 1/2 cup water instead of 3/4 cup
Replace  1/2 cup cocoa with 1/3 cup cocoa
Reduced flour by 1/4 th cup
Increased sugar by 1/4 cup

Very tasty! My customers loved them! I did take the advice of a previous poster and add a couple heaping spoons of sour cream and two T of chocolate pudding mix. I made cupcakes out of this and they turned out well. I wonder if the dry remarks could be due to over baking. They only needed 20 min in the oven, rather than the 35, it calls for. The frosting was far too fudgy and thick, so I added about 1/4 more butter and a splash of milk. It thinned it into a buttercream. Piped on great. I topped with half of a Ferrero Rocher ball, instead of cherries and cream. Thanks for the recipe! Yields about 2 doz cupcakes. Frosting makes enough for about 1 1/2 doz. To make your own cake flour: for each one cup of all purpose, subtract 2 T and replace with corn starch. Sift at least 5 times. Voila!
