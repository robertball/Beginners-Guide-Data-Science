I made this with snowshoe hare. It was real good. Nothing left over my teen boys cleaned it up.

It turned out well but I made some adjustments: no wine, added  onion, garlic, olives, mushrooms and mustard leaf.

I used a Silver Coast Seyval Blanc wine to make this recipe and my husband ate until he couldn't eat anymore, and even I enjoyed the rich flavors of the succulent morsels. It paired well with the asparagus drizzled with white balsamic vinegar, and some royal rice cooked in chicken stock.
