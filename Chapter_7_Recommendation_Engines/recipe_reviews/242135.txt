Loved it! This is a great way to convince your kids to drink more water. No sugar, no chemicals and they get to choose their flavours and the amounts of each. Thank you for the recipe.

Very refreshing on a hot day! I find these infused waters that have citrus in them to be slightly on the bitter side, which we don't mind at all. My husband LOVED this, and asked me to keep a pitcher of this in the fridge all summer.

Made for Recipe Group. I liked it, but a little too much mint for me. Love the lemon, lime, and cucumbers though. Thanks for the recipe!

Three to four days was way too long to infuse this. It was so bitter we couldn’t drink it at all. I read that you should cut off the lemon and lime rinds if infusing it for that long. This was my first time infusing water and wish I had known about the rinds before I wasted all those ingredients.

Made as listed and loved it.  Taste just like the water you get at the spa! Very refreshing. Have been making it regularly and will continue to do so throughout the summer

I really like this, I left the mint out personally. Great alternative than sugary drinks, when making this recipe try letting it sit for a couple hours. This ensures a little more flavor. I for one used two lemons. All in all, wonderful recipe that can be mixed and matched.

This is a refreshing and healthy detox water.  I followed this recipe as written and using the optional cucumber.  Normally, I will also add an orange.  This was the Buzz Recipe Group selection for July 25, 2015.
