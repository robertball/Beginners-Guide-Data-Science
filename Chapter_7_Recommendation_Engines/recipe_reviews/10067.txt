WOW!  My mom and I made this cookie tonight, as we were looking for a raisin oatmeal cookie that wasn't so...bland.  This recipe is FABULOUS!!  Soaking the raisins makes them plump and soft (and not so raisin-like) and the cinnamon adds a great kick.  We also added half a bag of Hershey's Cinnamon Chips to the mix and oh my goodness.  You MUST try it.  I think we have a new favorite cookie.  :)

This cookie reminded me of some my mother made called Oatmeal Rocks. They stay in a mounded shape and don't get real brown. They are softer than the ones my mother made and I like a soft cookie. I would make them again!

My entire family loved these cookies.  The only change I made was to omit the nuts.  They are soft, chewy and full of flavor due to the cloves.  This will certainly be a favorite cookie for years to come.  My father-in-law instantly requested the recipe when he bit into one.  Thank you for sharing Martha.

Mine, too, came out as balls. I made the recipe exactly as written. They are not soft and chewy as I was hoping for, more like soft, a litttle fluffy and sort of dry (even though they were baked to just golden brown on the edges and bottom. To it's credit, the plumpled raisins were much better than firm raisins.

With all the thousands of cookie recipes out there, I will try a different recipe next time I want cookies.

these are excellent. so soft and cnewy with the plumpest raisins i've ever tasted. it's the boiling of the raisins that gets them this way. I added nutmeg as well and in place of cloves.

These are nice, soft, delicious cookies. If you're looking for a crispy cookie, look elsewhere. This dough keeps well in the refrigerator. When I baked another try a few days later, my cookies were much thicker.

Next time I would use less clove, less raisins and more nuts. They are really good except after making them I decided I wanted crispy cookies this time, but that of course has nothing to do with the recipe, and I didnâ€™t like the strong taste of clove. Oh, I also added some white chocolate chips. Will definitely try again!

Not bad! Used applesauce for shortening, egg sub + egg whites for eggs, omitted pecans. Compared to other cookie recipes I've tried, this one was a lot of hassle for a taste that was good, but not great. I didn't have any ground cloves, so I had to mash whole cloves myself. I only used about 1/2 tsp of cloves, and I personally thought they were a little overpowering. I think the raisin juice was a good idea, and improved the flavor. I think the next time I make oatmeal raisin cookies I'll use part of this recipe and part of another. If you have time and you don't mind cleaning up the kitchen, and you liek chewy, sweet-spicy cookies, then these are definitely for you.

These are by far the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. They remain thick, chewy, and super-soft even a week after baking.

Very, very good !  I made it without nuts this time.  Next time, and that will be soon, I will add walnuts.
This recipe ended up making over 6 dozen.  They are "Gems" !!  Crispy outside, soft inside.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This had to be the best oatmeal cookie recipe I found yet. I made this for my family and my husband took about 2 dz to work and I guess they were gone by break time. I've had many requests for this now. Thank you so much for sharing!

I've made this recipe for more than 35 years. The recipe I have is called "Old Fashioned Oatmeal Cookies" from Betty Crocker. They really are the best Oatmeal Raisin cookies. I always make them exactly by the recipe, no changes necessary.
