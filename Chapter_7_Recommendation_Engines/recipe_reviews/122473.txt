While this can’t compete with a “home-cooked” minestrone with homemade broth and a variety of vegetables, cooked to perfection during a long, slow simmer, this is still very good for what it is – a darned fine soup that you can put together in less time than it takes to make your Sunday omelet.  I added a little white wine, tossed in some zucchini instead of the carrots, and used fresh spinach rather than frozen.  Because it cooks quickly it has a very fresh taste about it.  Once it stood awhile I had to add more chicken broth, but that’s not unusual at all.  I topped mine with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano – I seriously could not eat my soup without it.

Since I'm a Vegetarian I used organic vegetable stock instead of the chicken broth.  Two other things I changed which I don't think changed the recipe much, if at all.  I used fresh spinach and whole wheat rigatoni. Very hearty soup that eats like a meal.  I'll be making this again.

We loved this after I followed others' advice and used more seasoning!  Added extra oregano and Italian seasoning and just tasted it until it was right for us.  Very good basic recipe!

Delicious!! I let the vegetables and broth simmer for about 30 min before adding the noodles, and added a dash of garlic salt and basil. Great, simple recipe that tastes even better with more cooking time or the next day.

Very good. I cooked up some bacon and sauteed the onion and garlic in that for a light smokey flavor. No macaroni so I used rigatoni and fresh spinach instead of frozen. I'll omit the kidney beans next time.

This was great soup and very easy to throw together. I only changed things to use up what was on hand. I had garbanzo beans and fresh spinach and mini ziti so that's what I used. I used water and it was still good without the chicken broth.

Perfect for a cold winter night! Made a few changes:
-Added sweet Italian sausage & Chili Powder (my husband has to have the meat and spice).
-Used Diced Tomatoes with Green Chili Peppers (medium), because couldn't find no salt canned tomatoes.  
-Used 3 cans no salt and low fat chicken broth.
-Added fresh chopped basil.

I made this for dinner tonight but tweaked it a bit to put my own twist on it. I sauteed onion, garlic, carrots and one diced potatoe in olive oil and seasoned with a pinch of kosher salt, pinch of black pepper, tablespoon italian seasoning and a pinch of red pepper flakes plus two tablespoons of tomatoe paste. I replaced the kidney beans with a can of great northern beans that were rinsed and drained. Added my spinach to the mixture and then added the chicken broth once it all began boiling I added my small pasta shells. Overall, I think this is a wonderful recipe that one can build up from and it is very hearty. A great side was sourdough bread.

This recipe was delicious and so hearty! Better than any minestrone I've had in a restaurant. I added some other veggies I had on hand and some of my favorite hot sauce, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.

This was delicious! I did not use reduced-sodium ingredients and subbed a bag of fresh spinach for the frozen. I also used tiny shell pasta because that's what I had on hand and added an extra can of broth for more 'juiciness'. Very simple to make and tasted great! I will definately be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Good basic recipe!  I felt it needed more flavor so I added more garlic (4 cloves crushed).  I also ended up adding some water as it became too thick once the pasta cooked.

This was pretty good but could have used a bit more flavor. I ended up freezing it and later adding Rotel to it when warming and loved that addition!

I've made this a few times as written but lately I've been doubling the pasta and it comes out less like a soup and more like a stew. I prefer it that way. I do think it needs more flavoring but I haven't yet figured out what it is lacking. However, it's a great base recipe and I love making it for ease and nutrition!

I'm going to give this soup the benefit of the doubt because I used low-sodium instead of reduced-sodium chicken broth.  Having said that, I thought it needed salt, though on principle I would never add any myself.  Freezes and reheats very well.

I am giving it four stars because I changed it some.  I used regular chicken broth, not low sodium.  I also used an enitre cup of macaroni noodles and 2 cans of kidney beans to make it more hardy.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of basil as well.  I added spinach to individual bowl, because my husband does not like spinach.  Pretty tasty though.
