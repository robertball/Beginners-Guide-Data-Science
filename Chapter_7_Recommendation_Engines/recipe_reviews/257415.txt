This is delicious. Not too sweet and just the right consistency. Be sure to microwave or bake the flour first to remove possible bacteria. My daughters added sprinkles and mini chocolate chips.

I roll the dough into balls then freeze them and whenever I want one I take it out and pop it into my moth and since it thaws quickly it’s easier o eat, and since it’s frozen it’s less messy.

THIS WAS AMAZING!!! I am a huge fan of cookie dough, (eggs or no eggs) and my while family loved it. I used Nestle semisweet chocolate chips, and it kept in a PYREX in the fridge for about 2 weeks. (It might have been able to stay good longer, but nobody can keep their hands off cookie dough for very long)??

Delicious. the recipe works well and it doesn't take long. I use it as desert for my sibilings and a spoonful is enough.  Sometimes I will add more chocolate chips. Fantastic recipe.

This is very good and very similar to a recipe that I make. The ingredients are the same but the amounts are a bit different. This one calls for walnuts and the other recipe calls for pecans, which I much more prefer.

So delicious!  My brother and I both love cookie dough and we couldn't stop eating it.  Great to freeze too, and I'll definitely make this again.

This dough was absolutely perfect!  I’ve made a few recipes that are a bit grainy from sugar or you can taste the flour in them. This one was the perfect balance of ingredients. My whole family and a bunch of neighbor kids couldn’t stop eating it. I don’t love chocolate so I went easy on that but I’ll probably add the full amount next time for everyone else’s sake. Adding this to my recipe book for sure!

It was really great! I would recommend adding a tiny bit less vanilla because it comes through a bit strong, but otherwise it was delicious!

I made about "10 servings" but it is small enough for a half dozen cookies.

Mine turned out pretty good! I did cut the butter in half and switched out the milk for almond milk, which didn’t effect the consistency,

Didn't have chocolate chips but added peanut butter tasted so much better . I also added a splash of milk made it creamier.

Great flavor. I did use salted butter, and I have to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk as it was much too dry.

A good basic dough for eating or truffles etc. I would prefer more brown sugar.
