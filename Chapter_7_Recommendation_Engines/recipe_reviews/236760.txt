Hi everyone!  Thanks for looking at my recipe and thanks to those that made and enjoyed.  A couple of things lost in the editing process...definitely put a rough chop to the  veggies, and make cubes smaller than you would for say, a cheese plate.  Will melt and spread better.  And they forgot Tabasco sauce in the list of ingredients....a few shakes or more depending  on how spicy you like .  Or just have a bottle on the side so your guests can drizzle.  Hope you enjoy your Mardi Gras celebrations! And other celebrations throughout the year that bring food, friends, and family together!  Saveur.

I can't even describe how good this is.  Cheesy, briney, meaty goodness. ! I doubled a batch for a Mardi-Gras themed birthday party, and I don't think there will be a drop left. The only change I made was using garlic powder instead of chopping garlic, purely out of laziness. Thinking I'll have to make another batch just for me tomorrow! Thank you Saveur for a great recipe that will be a favorite of ours for years to come.

Wow!  It was love at first bite for us and this dip which now has a permanent home in my recipe box.  I actually ended up making it twice in one week.  Only a couple changes mostly for personal tastes.  I found a hot giardiniera relish at the store and figuring that it already had been chopped into nice sized bits I reduced the amount to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup each green and black olives, roughly chopped them to match the relish.  The first batch I used salami and the second time I used mortadella and served with bread both were amazing!

This is excellent! I made this for Fat Tuesday last night and I can't say enough good things about this. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and was a little concerned it might be too salty, but it is so delicious and not at all too salty. Very savory and cheesy--yum! My husband loved it and said it was one of the best things I have ever made. Absolutely a keeper!

Great recipe for using up the half-full jars of olives, giardiniera, and roasted peppers that always seem to accumulate in the fridge door! This recipe can be made beforehand and re-heated; the taste may even be better the next day, after the flavors have melded. Just be patient and reheat slowly and thoroughly.

Baked a double batch in a cast iron skillet and served in the skillet with chunks of French bread on the side. Guests loved it! Lots of flavor without any specific ingredient overpowering the taste.

This was addictively briney and creamy! It definitely brought to mind the flavors of a muffuletta. Paired perfectly with toasted slices of italian style crusty bread. The crunchy/creamy contrast was a perfect texture combo.

So darn good! I chopped everything really fine and added some jalape√±os and hot sauce too. The folks at the Mardi Gras party kept asking who made it.  They loved it! Thank you!!!

I doubled the recipe for a Mardi Gras event and it turned out well! My only complaint is that I feel like it's a bit too chunky to make a very good dip, and I don't know how it will be when its cold. I'm serving it with butter crackers. Very flavorful! I'd suggest slicing the ingredients into smaller pieces next time.

This dip is so good. I have made it several times. That's for submitting it.  When I take it to a function I serve it from a small crock pot to keep it warm.

Awesome!! I used 8 ounces provolone because it didn't seem like enough cheese when I mixed it together before adding cream cheese. Also added a little cayenne pepper because most of our friends prefer a little heat & served it with French bread baked in oven about 20 minutes in aluminum foil so outside was crispy but inside still a bit soft. Some were almost too full from this dip to eat dinner. Definitely a "do again" for future gatherings!!

Wow, did we enjoy this recipe!  We ate it hot the first night and cold the following day with the leftovers.  Not caring for olives, I used extra giardiniera in their place.  My store carried regular giardiniera and hot.  I opted to use the hot as we like spicy/hot items.  DH is not a cream cheese eater, but he sure enjoyed this dip.  Thanks Savy, for a delicious appy that will be sure to be made again.  It is really different and that was a huge part of its appeal.

I made for our Couples Supper Club which was a Cajun theme and served with French bread. It was delicious. I will make again. I plan to add hot sauce, either Frank's or Tabasco and maybe a bit of parmesan cheese.

this is so good!  i made this for a Mardi Gras party at work and everyone loved it.  I do wash off my olives before adding to remove some of the salty brine and that it was not too salty at all with the addition of the salami and cheeses, which can add a lot of saltiness to a dish.  I used both green and black Kalamata olives for added color, and added a bit more giardelli.  I served with crusty french bread.  I like this just as well cold as I do hot and could easily be made into muffalata sandwiches by cutting up a loaf of crusty french bread and slathering it all on cold then slicing it up.  thanks for this super recipe.

We invited family, leery of trying new food experiences,  to our Fat Tuesday party...and they LOVED this dip.  I agree with another reviewer, make the cubes small for easier spreading.  Will definitely make again!
