I made this tonight with some Chum fillets that were in my freezer.  I made a few changes to the recipe though.  I didn't have a shallot on hand so I minced two garlic cloves instead.  I only used 2 tablespoons of butter in total rather than the 10 tablespoons called for.  After sauting the garlic I did not add any more butter.  I did not use cream.  Instead I used 1 cup of 1% milk.  I thickened the sauce with 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with 1 tablespoon of milk.  I also baked the salmon in the oven rather than in a skillet.  I lined a baking pan with aluminum foil, placed the salmon in the pan and poured the sauce overtop.  I then baked the salmon for 15 minutes at 400F.  (A good rule of thumb for baking fish fillets is 10 minutes per inch of thickness at 400F).  This was excellent and I would definitely make this again.

Delicious.  This is one of the best salmon recipes I have tried.  I used garlic instead of shallot (didn't have any) and it turned out great.  I cooked the entire time in the oven and it was so moist and flavorful.  I will make sure that this goes in the permanent file.  Thanks for the post.

This was my first attempt with making fish ever.  It was delicious.  I did make some changes in order to add flavor and cut fat.  I used fresh dill and thyme (double the dry amounts) per reviewers suggestion.  I substituted milk for cream (so I used 1 cup of 2% milk instead of 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk).  I think I only used about 4 tbsp of butter.  I don't think I added more butter to the sauce once it was thick (if I did, it wasn't 1/4 cup) and used about 1/8 tbsp when cooking the salmon first.
Once the salmon was finished cooking in the sauce, I decided to thin the sauce a bit with more milk, lemon juice, and wine so that I could pour the sauce over some wheat pasta.  It was excellent!  It didn't need any more herbs since it was flavorful enough.

This is so good!  I did like some of the other reviewers and baked the salmon the whole time.  I made the sauce separately and served over the salmon.  I used the 2 TBS. of butter with the shallots, but then only stirred in another 1/2 TBS. of butter at the end.  I think all of the other butter is unnecessary.  It tasted great without it!  I did use the cream and used 1% milk.  I used chicken broth in place of the wine, and didn't add any extra salt.  This was pretty easy to put together, and the sauce went well with steamed broccoli and new potatoes.  I really, really liked the sauce, and salmon is always yummy!

This was AWESOME.  I revised slightly - I used milk in place of the cream and garlic in place of the shallots - due to not having these ingredients available.  I also added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to the sauce to help thicken it.  In the last few minutes of making the sauce, I added about 3 T of capers.  YUM!  I also baked the salmon (375 for 25 min) and then spooned the sauce over top.  Delicious!!!

I just finished my plate and WOW. It was great! I did use only about half the amount of butter. The taste was very much like the sauce you get with the herb crusted salmon at Cheesecake Factory. I will be making this again and again!

I see how this sauce would be fantastic, but dear lord, what's with all the butter?! I started with one small onion and one clove of garlic then proceeded with the sauce as suggested. It was terrific after the milk/cream has thickened, I loved the wine and the vinegar in there for depth of taste and the herbs were lovely. (I doubled the dill and halved the thyme to make it a DILL sauce.) Then there was the 1/4 cup of butter to be added. I was suspicious of it but wanted to make the recipe as written first so I went along with it. At this stage it was still ok. But another 1/4 cup of butter for frying the fish? Then that to be mixed with the rest of the sauce? Very odd. I did end up taking at least half of that butter off the fish before mixing because it just looked wrong, and yet, it came out way to fatty. So sad as what I could taste of the sauce was great. I am a great fan of making rich food but with this I have to wonder if there was a type-o in the recipe. But I have certainly learnt from this. I plan to make this sauce for fish again and again and again - minus all the butter. Thanks for the recipe, I'm sure it will be a fabulous 5 star one next time!

My family loved this salmon.  The sauce is absolutely delicious and would be nice with any kind of fish.  I did use FRESH dill and thyme (double the amounts).  This is the best -light and fresh tasting!

It is was great and very easy to prepare recipe. I would recommend using less butter as Salmon is already a fatty fish.
I also did not have white wine and cooked it entirely without it, and it came out great. Also I substituted the lemon pepper with regular white pepper because I already felt it had enough of lemon taste and did not want it the sauce to turn bitter.

This sauce is fantastic! It is flavorful but not overpowering, and brings out the taste of the salmon quite well. I doubled the recipe and instead of cooking the salmon in a saute pan, put it in a baking dish in the oven. Every one of my guests raved!

This recipe almost worked.  We will try it again, but with these variations.   

First, hold the sauce until plating.  In step 2, I had a perfect sauce that was ready to serve.    Sauteing the fish took approx 15 minutes for one inch thick pieces.  Step 3 said to cook fish in the sauce.  This extra time and heat destroyed the sauce- curdled and separated it.   Next time, ladle the sauce on after the fish has been plated.

Second, I used butter where called for, but only half the amount.  No problems.

Last, I substituted 1 cup of 2% milk for the 1/2 c cream and 1/2 c milk.   Sauce still thickened up while whisking- looked great.

I eat salmon because it is good for me but it isn't my favorite.  I have one way that I "like" it but that can get boring so I tried this recipe.  It was wonderful!  Since I am aware that our body needs plenty of GOOD fat, my butter is from grass fed cows and I do use raw milk and raw cream.  I gloried in the fat amount called for as I know that it is so good for a healthy body.  I do know that the cooking would have changed the cream to not being healthy so I used coconut cream.  The whole thing was wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe.
And just in case anyone is curious.... I don't gain an ounce from eating freely of the high fats because they are not "ruined" with grains, hormones & antibiotics being fed to the cattle etc.  Also, I am not one who has a "thin" metabolism.  I have fought weight all my life until I learned about eating whole, real foods..... including butter, bacon, lard, etc.  :-)

The only reason this doesn't get five stars is because there's WAY too much butter. I used 2 tablespoons to saute the garlic (I didn't have shallots on hand), and that was it. I seasoned the fish as described, but my boyfriend and I decided to grill it instead of cooking it in the oven. I also used chicken broth instead of white wine because I live in a dry county. It was creamy, flavorful, and will definitely become a staple in our recipe box. Yum!

I made this the other night for my family and it was delicious.  I made a few minor changes - I used garlic instead of the shallots, only used the first 2 tablespoons of butter and baked the salmon brushed with olive oil and salt and pepper.  I doubled the sauce and served the salmon over snow peas and pasta.  I found the sauce to be very lemony when I tasted it, and didn't think it would be a hit - but the flavor evened out when I served it and everyone loved it!

Great Recipe!! I cooked this for my wife and I and it was very tasty, the salmon wasn't overcooked, and it really gave it a lemony, capers sort of taste. the only I  changed was the cooking time on the Salmon from 8 minutes to about 10 to 12 minutes to get it really cooked without over drying it.  Also, I was suggest lowering the heat on the sauce to let it really simmer and thicken.

Delicious! Had to use a cornstarch/milk mix to thicken sauce, but have made this several times and love it over white rice with a salad!

I also cut back on the butter (by about 7 tbsp)and used Haddock instead of Salmon- baked the haddock in lemon juice and used the sauce as a drizzle. I also traded the shallot for minced garlic fried up in a little cooking spray. Aside from the minor changes, everything was PERFECT. My husband raves about this meal. It tastes like something you'd order at a good restaraunt

This is an awesome recipe. I only made a few changes to try and cut out some calories: I used almost all milk with just a splash of cream and used only half the butter. I did add more spice for flavor, and added some capers as well. I also used some corn starch to help thicken, and will use more next time. The biggest change was I baked the fish for 10 minutes at 350, added the sauce to the pan and upped the temp to 375, and baked for another 20-25 minutes. It turned out wonderful!

My husband and I thought that this was VERY sour and borderline bitter.  And I didn't even use all of the 5 tablespoons lemon juice!  We were just glad that we didn't have white wine vinegar to add to the sour taste of the sauce.  Disappointing.

Excellant recipe!  I just finished eating and it was fantastic.  I served the dish with a side of falafel and tzatziki, which complimented it well.  It takes a bit longer than 45 minutes if you want a nice thick sauce, but it's well worth the effort.

We tried this tonight and it was very good. I used only 2 tblsp butter to saute the garlic (no shallots) and used fat free evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream/milk. I then used corn starch to thicken as mentioned. I used this over tilapia and baked it. It was very good. Next time I will either add capers or dijon to give it a little zing. The evaporated milk sweetens it up quite a bit. I loved it though and can't wait to make it again!

This is a great recipe! The only thing I would change is use less butter (the butter was pooling in the sauce by the time the fish was cooked) and use milk in place of the heavy cream and cornstarch to thicken (to make the recipe a little healthier).

Perfect sauce!  I added a bit more lemon, just because I like the tartness.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I added a full cup of half & half and then some cream cheese to thicken it up and add some "fat" flavor.  DELICIOUS!

I made this but did lots of the changes.  Probably only did about 3 Tbsp of butter total and did the shallots in olive oil.  Also used whole milk and cornstarch.  It was good and the kids liked it.

Made it again 7/7/16  Probably 3 stars as I did it as posted.  Just not our favorite way to eat salmon.  Definitely way too much butter!

This was sooo yummy! I did change a few things.... I skipped the butter and used Pam to sautee the shallots, I used fat free half and half and milk instead of the cream and a little flour to thicken it up.  I also used fresh dill because I had it. I also skipped the thyme and parsley in the sauce just used the dill. Served it with steamed broccoli and cucumber and avodado salad from this site. Very good! Thanks for the post!

This recipe was pretty good and would have been better poured over noodles.  I may have not made the sauce correctly but it left something to be desired...too much butter maybe?  Some garlic and mushrooms might help.

Very tasty.  I used light cream for this recipe-- will likely use milk and a little less butter than what is specified for next time as salmon tends to be an oily fish anyway.

My family LOVES this recipe! My mother-in-law had never used wine for cooking so when she wasn't sure the sauce would be good, but when she tried it she absolutely loved it! This has become our family fav for salmon and I cook it almost every time we have company. The only this I do different is use a little less butter and I also bake the salmon with lemon pepper, dill, butter, and a fresh squeeze of lemon juice. We enjoy it served with steamed asparagus or sauted veggies and rice pilaf.

The lemon-dill sauce was excellent,however,I did use fresh herbs in place of dried.

I made this recipe a few days ago.  At first, I hit some trouble because when I added the milk to the sauce, it completely curdled.  I'm wondering if it was because the lemon juice and vinegar were already in there?  I know the pan wasn't too hot, and the milk was not expired.  So, I had to start again, but instead of milk I added some sour cream.  Yogurt would have been my alternative of choice, but I did not have any.  Second of all, this sauce could have used a lot less of the other seasonings, like the thyme.  Thyme was very strong and it almost killed the dill flavor I love.  Overall, it was good.  I am a fan of sour dishes, but not bitter.  So, next time, I will heat the milk in the sauce up slowly before I add the lemon juice.  My husband absolutely loved it.

A cavalcade of cuisine delight! The flavors are heavenly!
I used 1 cup of Alfredo sauce instead of milk and cream and I used scallions instead of a shallot.  I added one diced  garlic clove to the scallions. After returning the salmon back to the iron skillet, I baked it 15 minutes at 400 in the oven. (My stove boils on low!)

I made this last night and  couldn't eat mine.  I thought the thyme (tsp) was way too strong with the dill.  I think it would have been really delicious with maybe 1/4 tsp. or none, because everything else up to the point of all of that thyme was good, but it became  overpowering and too complex. I didn't use all of the butter and the consistency and look was beautiful.  This is the first recipe with so many raves that I didn't care for.

This sauce is really lovely.  I used it with fish ravioli and it blended really well.  I only used 1 tablespoon of butter to saute the shallots and instead of double cream I used a lighter option, some light cooking cream and instead of milk I used skimmed milk, it still came thick and its much healtier.  Next time I will try and use garlic as suggested in other reviews cos I will surely do this sauce again!

I really liked the taste of this, but the sauce turned out very oily.  I think next time I will cut down on the butter.  I tried to add more milk like another reviewer did when her sauce was oily, but the sauce just separated on me after doing that.  I will try again with a dramatic decrease in the amount of butter and see if I get better results.

Mm-mm!  I had to give four stars though because I thought there was a bit too much butter (and I love butter!).  We don't usually have cream or white wine so I substituted sour cream and vodka.  I will definitely make this recipe again as it was delicious!   In summer, I'll try fresh dill and thyme.

I made this sauce for a dinner party and put it on Halibut. It was a hit! Everyone raved about the dill sauce. It was a little to lemony, so I added a bit more whipping cream and butter, then thickened it with a butter flour roux. I used garlic instead of shallots. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Very tasty recipe.  It's not the healtiest way to prepare salmon with all of the butter and cream, but it would probably be a nice treat every once in a while.  I substituted red onion for the shallot since it was what I had on hand.  I also did not have lemon pepper, so I used some lemon zest and black pepper.  Next time I will be more careful with the heat after adding the cream and butter because the sauce broke on me.  I might also try adding some cornstarch slurry since that is also supposed to help.

One of the kids does not like salmon, so I made this when she was at camp for the rest of us.  After the first mouthful, I got a big thumbs up from the 7yr old.  The recipe looks complicated, but it goes pretty quickly. Absolutely delicous!

I made this for our 6 month anniversary dinner, even though my husband isn't so into salmon because I had some salmon i needed to use and I wanted to make something light. Let's just say he finished his plate! We both loved it! I baked the salmon and then served it over pasta with the sauce. I followed recipe to a T besides for using garlic and a only a Tbls of butter added at the end. The sauce was VERY oily so I added some more milk and it ended up fine! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

This recipe was delicious and very restaurant quality.  Used chopped leeks instead and found this to be a nice addition.   The flavor was rich and flavorful.  The recipe seemed a little confusing but if followed step by step was easy. Definitely one to try.

OMG this was such an amazing sauce. We omitted the lemon pepper, and just used pepper instead because we didn't have any, and it was still very very rich. I put this over whitefish instead of salmon, and I'm glad I did because if it had been salmon, it might have been too rich. Definitely will make again.

I was able to get some very fresh salmon and decided to give this recipe a try.  My salmon turned out great! The sauce alone is fantastic, and combined with the salmon made for a very rich, tasty treat.  I would probably save this recipe for special and/or company dinners as it is very rich and I don't even want to guess at the calories!  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

This was my first time cooking any kind of fish!  I thought the sauce for it was awesome!  I would eat it again but with a different kind of fish.  I was not too thrilled with salmon.  It has a very strong taste.

My husband was not fond of this.  He said he prefers the traditional way we make salmon, topped with hollandaise sauce....once he likes a food prepared a certain way, it takes a lot to change his opinion, that being said, he's a good critic because when he likes something different, I know its a good recipe!  I actually thought this sauce tasted similar to hollandaise, but I was expecting a bit more punch due to the fresh lemon juice and the amount of dill.  I also like other reviewers made the sauce separately and after seasoning the salmon, poured the sauce over the salmon and baked it at 400 for 20 min.  Don't think I'll make this again, but I look forward to testing out other salmon recipes on this site and see if any of them win my hubby over.

My husband says this is the best salmon recipe I've ever made! And I think I agree! The fish was so tender and cream sauce was delicious. I ran out of milk so I used all cream with made it a very rich sauce but I didn't change anything else. Probably not the healthiest but definately delicious! Will make again.

I absolutely love this recipe! I've made this dozens of times over the years, and my family still requests it. It doesn't really need any changes if you are paying attention closely as you go - I'm guilty of breaking the sauce a few times after adding it to the fish, but no one complains, because it's still that good. I will often reserve some of the sauce, not adding all of it to the cooking salmon. Then I will either pour it on top of the finished dish, or leave it on the side. Just a side note - I, like others, often cut down the butter, but it turns out great no matter how much butter you add. This recipe is so flavorful!

The salmon was delicious, however the sauce was extremely sour and bitter.  I will definitely be preparing the salmon this way again but I will not be making the sauce again.

I thought the sauce was amazing on the salmon. The only thing
I was a little worried about is all the butter use in this dish. But
I guess you would call this a Paula Dean kind of entree. I liked the fact also that I did not have to use fresh herbs which can be expensive. If you want to impress someone make this dish.

Finger-licking so good sauce. Made it with seared scallops & added 1 clove of garlic to sauce and omitted milk.

Way too much butter, my sauce ended up separating when I added it in with the salmon because of all the butter

Hubby made this recipe for us last night, it was amazing!  We, too, used garlic in place of scallions and milk in place of cream.  It was light, flavorful and quick to make on the stove.  We served it with small whole potatoes and asparagus.  Definitely restaurant-quality and perfect for special guests too!

This recipe is fantastic. I used one cup of sour cream instead of the milk/cream combo, and I used fresh dill, parsley, and thyme. Also didn't have any lemon pepper, so I used fresh lemon zest and black pepper at approximately the same amount. Next time I might cut back just a little bit on the vinegar, but that is really just nitpicking. Excellent!

My sauce split...  :(  ...but it still tasted great. 
I also added some garlic and baked the fish seperately from the sauce.  I will try it again, it WAS yummy!  :)

This recipe was delicious! I made it for my roommates and myself and they all loved it. I did follow the advice of the other reviews and cut down on the butter. Will definitely be making this again!

Our favorite salmon dish for 3 years now. We renamed it Grilled Salmon w/Heavenly Cloud Sauce. We grill the salmon first and make sauce separate. Reduced the butter to 6 tbl, 1/4 cup cream and 3/4 cup of milk, increased wine by 1oz, added fresh Lemon Zest, and mixed in a roux at the end to compensate for thickness.  Enjoy!

This recipe was DELICIOUS! Full of flavor and filling. I substituted about 2 Tbsp of the butter with Olive Oil to saute the onions and fish in.  I also used Wild Salmon that was skinless so I seasoned it and sauteed it on both sides.  I also used 1% milk in place of the heavy cream to cut down on the fat. The sauce was a little thin but the flavor was great.  This was also great served the next day cold on a salad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for an intimate dinner for two.  I had to use frozen salmon fillets but it still turned out fantastic!  The fresh dill was superb.  I also lightened with fat free half and half and light butter. Will definitely make again!

I let the salmon marinade all day, and also made the sauce a little bit ahead of time so that the flavors would have a chance to develop and meld. The only other thing I did differently was to use fresh dill instead of dried. It turned out great. Thanks, Steve B.!

Thought this was good for a change.  It was a bit rich and actually covered up the taste of the fish (I used Steelhead) which i don't mind but I think I prefer a more simple preparation for fish.  I didn't use all the butter called for maybe a few tablespoons less and everything else I kept the same.  The sauce would be good on other things as well since it has really good flavor.  Thanks

My very first time cooking (or even eating!) salmon.  It was quite good.  Hubby is a salmon connoisseur and absolutely LOVED it.
