Very good with the following changes. I used brown sugar and cinamon to saute the bananas, saved a little shaved chocolate for garnish on whipped cream. Sprinkled some toasted slivered almonds on top. A definte hit.

This recipe is great, however following the recipe made the banana's too mushed.  I will try cooking the rum with the butter and sugar first, until the alcohol cooks off, then put the bananas in for about 2-3 minutes.  I would agree about using 1/2 cup for whipped cream.  I added 1/2 tbsp sugar to the whipped cream just for taste.  THANKS THIS WAS GREAT!!!!

Great recipe!  I served this for my family recently and everyone raved.  (And they're not a disingenuous bunch.)  One quibble: 1/4 cup of whipping cream isn't adequate.  I used 1/2 cup and it was just enough.

This was SO GOOD!!!!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used light cream for the chocolate mixure and used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I then topped it off with canned whipped cream.  The recipe was a total hit with my husband, I will be making it often!  THANKS FOR SHARING IT!

I made a modified version of this (ice cream instead of whipped cream, chocolate syrup instead of the from-scratch mix here), but found the bananas in simple syrup to be very bland. I think it would be better with brown sugar instead of white, and it needed some cinnamon, too.

I made this dessert for my girlfriend as a end to a anniversary dinner.  It was quite easy to prepare, and quite delicious.  I found that presentation was the key with this dish. Use your imagination, and this is an excellant dessert.

Good recipe, but I changed it up quite a bit, used chocolate syrup instead of sauce, left out the rum added vanilla to the simple syrup, used whipped cream and garnished with cherries and more chocolate syrup.  Did not cook bananas long just until slightly golden.

Sorry, but no one in my family cared for this.  The bananas and whipped cream were ok, but the rum was too strong and my chocolate sauce turned out kind of gritty and bitter.  I might try it again with a caramel sauce.

This was wonderful!  Even my sister thought so (and she would have said something if she didn't like it). The only thing I changed to the recipe was that I didn't top it with whipped cream.  Definitely will make again and soon!
