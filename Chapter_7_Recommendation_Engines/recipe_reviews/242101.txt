Yes, I made changes. Yes, I will make it again.
I used "Slap Ya Mama" cajun season salt mix  from Ville Platte, LA. (it's what we have i.l.o. reg. season salt mix). And dark brown sugar i.l.o. reg. brown sugar. I think it has a better flavor during cooking.
Since I only had 1 rack, I halved the recipe, which was just more than enough. I did overnight them.
Cooking instruction was not quite followed. I did the 5 minute or so on the grill to sear the meat side, but then wrapped in heavy duty alum. foil 3 times, alternating the wrap. Slow cooked on the grill over indirect heat at about 250 for 3 hours. This just wasn't enough cooking time. I did the finish on the grill with some sauce for about an hour. These could have stayed in the foil for at least 1 more hour.
I know the recipe says "5" hours and that is probably what I'll spend next time.
However, the flavor was outstanding with a little spice kick and sweetness to back it up. 
So, flavors are excellent and just make sure you cook them correctly. And if you want them with a bit more kick add some heat to your mop sauce or up the cayenne by 1/4 tsp.
I like the flavor. Our sauce mix is from a Marlboro Cookbook.

Enjoy

oh my my my.. loved the fact you don't have to set forever.. my husband wanted ribs for dinner, it was already 2 in the afternoon and local market had them on sale for 1.98 lbs.. by the time I got home from store it was 4 pm. ddnt have time to rub and leave on overnight or set for hrs. I came across this and made extra rub as I always do for future and zip-locked it.. I rubbed them set aside to get Charco Grill going nice and hot, seared them for a bit, wrapped them in Tinfoil, cooked for a few hrs (2/3), took foil off, cut up ribs, whipped up BBQ sauce, cooked for a 1/2-1hr while glazing with sauce, to get that crispy crust.. my family went silent with happiness.. so much ohhhh and mmmmm is all we heard around the table.. hubby said "the best ribs I've ever had" my picky 6 yr old girl had 3ribs alone.. make that extra rub and store it for those short on time work days.. throw in crockpot then oven for a crispy crust! will not be disappointed either way!! thank so much for sharing!!!!!
