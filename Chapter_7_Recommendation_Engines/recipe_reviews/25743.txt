This is a recipe I grew up with. My Grandmother made it all the time.  She did do a couple of thing differently though.  She chopped up a large onion and put it in the pasta water allowing it to boil about 10 min. before adding the pasta to the pot, when the pasta was cooked she left about a 1/4 of the cooking water and the onions in the pot. The tomatoes were then added to the pasta with about 3/4 tsp. of baking soda then the milk, butter, salt & pepper were added and heated gentley.  This still remains one of my familys favorite comfort food.

I NEVER thought I'd write this but I honestly think the canned tomato soup is better.  We don't think this is horrible or anything but we just couldn't get passed our prior expectations of what tomato soup should taste & feel like.  I used the petite diced tomatoes and did add a small can of tomato sauce. I think it could use a little more spices but I can't off-hand think of which ones. Ofcourse, I served with grilled cheese sandwiches but I'm not sure if I'd make this again.  Thanks anyways!

Easy, and a good idea for familys on the go. I used butter instead of margerine to make it richer, and added a bit more tomatoe! Thanx for the recipe!

I made this for myself tonight, and was very happy with the results. I did add a few extra ingredients. I had some sun-dried tomato pesto in the pantry, and added about a teaspoon. I added a bit of half & half to make the soup a bit richer and creamy. I also added some dried basil, onion powder, a handful of fresh minced parsley, a couple of shakes of dried chives and chili powder too. I loved the slight garlic taste the pesto gave the soup. I had my bowl of soup with some fresh buttermilk bread. The whole meal really hit the spot and was a real tummy-warmer. Thanks for the great, and so easy, recipe Norma!

This was a good quick lunch.  My son loved it!  I used diced tomatoes and blended them in the end to make it smoother.  Can't wait to use fresh.

I used non dairy creamer instead of milk, so it wouldn't scorch. Otherwise left everything else the same was very good for a cold night.

Sorry to say, we didn't like this very much -- the acidity of the tomatoes clashed with the milk, the ingredients didn't seem to "marry" very well. If I made it again I might add some sugar to cut the tomatoes' acidity.

It was good but not outstanding. After simmering for a few minutes I tasted it and quickly decided it needed something more, so I added a little garlic powder. I'm not keen on the macaroni in there either so if I make it again I will not add the macaroni. Also added a little cornstarch to thicken it a bit. As someone else said it's a good starter base.

Kind of boring  by itself, but a good starting point.  I added chopped onion and basil (Italian seasoning would be good, but my kids don't like it) and a can of crushed tomatoes.  Sliced celery would have been good, too, as would have many other veggies (but then again, my kids would not have eaten it).  We also sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top of each serving.

I will make this again.  I did make some changes only because I had to use what I had in my pantry as it was a last minute add on to dinner.  I took another cook's idea and added onion to the pasta while cooking. I only had canned tomatoes with herbs, no Rotel with chilies, and had to use Carnation canned whole milk and topped it up with water to make 3 cups. Afterwards when I tasted I realized it needed more oomph so I added 1 tsp of parmesan to each bowl I served and gave the option for everyone to add some liquid hot pepper sauce.  Everyone loved it .  I had some leftovers the next day and it was still good.  I don't really like changing a recipe until after I have followed the directions the first time but I really wanted something easy/quick and this caught my eye.
