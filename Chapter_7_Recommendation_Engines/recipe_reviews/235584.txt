Loved this recipe.  I used both pinto and black beans in mine.  The only thing I might do different next time is not add the chips.  I will serve them uncooked on top of the cooked casserole or just directly in my bowl. We had a ton of left overs and the chips get really soggy when the dish is reheated. Overall the recipe was very easy and a big hit with both myself and my husband. I am sending this one to several of my friends. It's just too good to keep to myself!

The first time I made this casserole, I used half a 12-oz. jar of chicken gravy in place of the second can of cream of chicken soup, because that's what was on hand. Yesterday, I made the recipe with the two cans of soup -- and it wasn't as good! The gravy seems to impart more chicken flavor than does that second can of soup. So four stars as written. (P.S. I don't add any beans because my son, Mr. Pickypants, doesn't like them.) That said, this recipe is awfully good and awfully easy; you should definitely try it!

Very easy recipe.  Best idea would be to make the chicken a day before hand though.  I did change a couple of things:  I only used 1 can of condensed cream of chicken soup (2 would've been way too much), used about a 1/4 cup of taco sauce (medium heat) didn't crush chips at all but just layered them whole and chopped up a couple of pickled jalapenos I had left over from another recipe.  So good!! I will definitely be making this again!

My family loves this recipe.  We add corn as well, and a layer of rice on the bottom to make it complete.  Rarely are there any leftovers, but when there are, every one fights over them LOL!

I wish half stars could be given, because this recipe is more like 4.5 stars.  It's a really great, flavorful and EASY recipe.  The only thing I will do different next time is use less soup as it was too soupy.  And instead of tortilla chips, wrap the mixture in soft tacos with cheese on top to make an enchilada casserole dish!

This is my third time making this delicious dish.  I do just a few things differently.  I use a cup of plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and nobody in the family was the wiser, two cans of black beans (they're healthy, so why not), and I add a 4 oz can of green chilis.  It's a great recipe, so yummy. And thanks to a pintrest idea I saw shredding chicken is easier than ever.  Place HOT chicken breast into a bowl, get your hand mixer, set on low speed and shred away.  I place aluminum foil on the bowl and make a hole big enough for the mixer so as not to have shredded chicken all over the kitchen.  Works great!  :)

I put all the ingredients in my crockpot, on low, to cook. I added cream cheese instead of sour cream. Also I added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin and red pepper, for a little added spice. I layered the mixture, chips, and cheese as instructed by the recipe and put it in the oven for 10 minutes. Turned out delicious, everyone loves it!

This was good, but I totally winged.  Halved the recipe and still had more than I needed.  Instead of the tomatoes with green chilis, I used a 16 ounce jar of salsa.  And instead of tortilla chips, I used fritos since that was all I had.  Instead of black beans, I used kidney beans since I was also out of that.  Served over rice with the green onions and tomatoes (mine was kind of saucy from using so much salsa for only 2 cups of chicken).  Oh, I also sprinkled in some ground chipotle chile pepper.

Yummy!  My husband almost ate the entire dish.  Not spicy (unless you add some kind of hot sauce), but very tasty.  Great meal for a weekday.

This was exceptionally good.... Everyone loved it.  I too omited the beans, only did a thin layer of chips in between layers of chicken mixture and substituted salsa for the tomatoes.  Used my hand mixture to shred the chicken that I had cooked with water in a pan on the stove top.  We had this as a meal with homemade Pita Toasts and a salad but I would also make this anytime I needed a quick and easy appetizer!

My family really loves this dish and in the summertime it is nice because it makes so much the kids can just re-heat left overs and go!!  Awesome meal to make for a mom on the go!!!  I usually add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup and I also add the green onions to the mixture to give it more flavor.  Love the recipe and so does the family!!

I made this for my family the other night with great success and feedback. it was very easy to prepare and even easier to devour. My mother has a gluten allergie so I made a substitute for the cream of chicken by mixing chicken broth, melted butter, buttermilk and an all-purpose gluten free flour in a small saucepan at low heat prior to making this dish. Either way this came out absolutely delicious and will be made again.

Made this tonight for dinner. Three adult men had large seconds along with myself (mom) and my 16 year old grandson finished it off on his 3rd big helping! Used 16 (so more like 6 cups tortillas) Ortega yellow corn taco shells in the blue box (had them on hand), left them on the big side instead of crushing. Did add 1 cup more cheese on top, but used some Mexican 4 cheese blend too. Served with salad and Kraft Mac & Cheese. Everyone was VERY satisfied. Will make again and again. Thanks for sharing :-)

Very good and simple to make. Following other reviews, I kept chips out and served casserole over the chips. I will fix this again!

This is one of my husband's favorites. Not complicated but very tasty. Not too spicy but easily adjustable to your tastes.  For more spice I also tried mixing one of those small cans of pickled jalapeños. Or put a dish of that on the side, people can spoon in the extra heat if they wish.

This was really tasty and even the kids enjoyed it (rare).  To make it healthier, I made my own cream of chicken soup and only used the equivalent to one can.  I also made my own taco seasoning and used whole grain tortilla chips.  For the chicken, I just used a store bought rotisserie chicken that I had bought and shredded a couple days before.

I thought there were too many chips in this. It ended up being a little overwhelming. The general taste was good and I'll probably try again, but next time I'll probably go with 3 cups of chips, or less, or maybe try it with corn tortillas for the layering instead.

Delicious! A must try in the kitchen. I love the fresh Cilantro! Plus, It's even good leftover.. Although the three of us have eaten half the pan the last couple times.

I really enjoyed this dish! So easy to make. I did use whole chips instead of crunching them up. I think it tasted better this way. I will def make this dish again.

I have to give this 5 stars because this is the first time my 4 1/2 year old son did not complain about dinner and he actually ate it! Made this for 4 servings and accidentally used a whole can of tomatoes and chilies, but still everything tasted great! Considering omitting the chips and rolling up into tortillas to bake in the oven next time. Thanks for this recipe!

Easy and my wife loved it. Not like some of the other things I have tried. One can Cream of Chicken and one can of Cream of Celery only because I only had one of each. I'll follow the recipe next time and see if I can give it 6 stars

This turned out great. Didn't use as much cheese and added a few chopped fresh jalapenos. Next time I may try adding a can of mexicorn for texture. Served with tostito chips. Will make again.

I did half pulled pork and a little chicken. It was wonderful. I made our own taco seasoning though. Our kids gobbled it up. This is wonderful!

i have made this recipe so many times and everyone in my family loves it, including me! I have followed the recipe exact several times and a couple times I have improvised when I have not had all the ingredients on hand. This recipe to me, is perfect as written. I am one of those people that usually only leaves a review for the exact recipe as written. There have been plenty of times I start reading some of the reviews on recipes and by the time the reviewer adds this, switches that, doesn't add this ect...it ends up being a review of something completely different....with that being said, this is one of those recipes a person could easily make their own by adding corn or rice ect..the one little simple thing I have done and will always do to make this even simpler to make, as if it even needed to be made easier, is buying frozen bags of the Tyson grilled chicken chunks. Being a busy mom with 3 kids involved in time consuming sports this is at the very top of my go to recipes. Hats off to the original poster for sharing this gem! Oh, another side note- this recipe is simple enough that on days when I don't feel like cooking, even my 10 year old can throw this one together! Also perfect for doubling for big family Mexican fiesta nights, potlucks, large reunions, etc..This recipe as written does make a lot. Feeds my family of 5 just fine but I do double it most of the time because we all love the leftovers so much and eating it the next day!

This is embarrassing, but I'll tell you anyway.  I was making this in honor of Cinco de Mayo, and followed the recipe exactly.  I had just put it in the oven when I realized that I had forgotten to add the packet of taco seasoning.  It was too late to fix it, so I just continued anyway, assuming that the final result would be bland.  Surprise -- it actually turned out great!  The tomatoes with green chiles gave it a small but noticeable kick, and the salt in the tortilla chips helped too.  Everyone loved it!  Imagine how much they'd have raved if I had actually done it right!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I had a few bags of tortilla chips that were almost gone and down to pretty much broken up chips but I didn't want them to go to waste so I went in search of something that allowed me to use them up and this is what I found!
It was good!  I tried to lighten it up a little and skipped one of the cans of soup and while my husband thought it was delightful, I personally felt it needed it to make it more creamy.  I thought it was a little dry.  I will make this again though because it was my mistake plus it was quite yummy and made a good amount that fed us for at least 2 meals.  I topped it off with more sour cream (helped with the dry issue), green onions, chopped cilantro and tomatoes.  Yummmmmm!

I didn't have any sour cream so I made it without.  I also only had one can of soup, but it still turned out well.  My three kids loved it, which is a huge win in my book.

I've made this twice. The first time, I made it as the directions stated. It was okay but the chips were soggy. The second time, I only used one can of soup, used black beans with jalapeños to give it even more of a kick for my tastebuds, I cut the amount of chips down crumbled between layers and mixed regular corn chips with Doritos. I served with extra chips on the side. Family went back for more! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good. My kids complained a bit about it, but everything was eaten up at the end of the day. I did use a homemade version of chicken soup, and the equivalent of 1 can; two cans would have been definitely too much. I used a can of corn in place of tomatoes for preference reasons, and I added a splash of medium salsa. I added a layer of corn tortillas on the bottom for a bit more substance. Thank you :)

I made this on a whim the other day. I only had one can of cream of chicken soup, so I added a small tub of onion and chive cream cheese to add flavor and more creaminess (also didn't have any green onions or cilantro), I subbed one can of green chilies and one can of diced tomatoes for the mixed can and used a packet of mild taco  seasoning. Turned out delicious and my husband brought leftovers for lunch the next day.

I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend is not.  I made half of the recipe as written for him.   For me, I substituted tomato soup for the chicken soup and veggie crumbles for the chicken.   Both were very tasty!

I made this exactly as written. It was delicious, but I think the serving size to ingredient ratios are a little bit off. I reduced mine to make 4 servings, but it still filled the entire 9 by 13, with two full layers, & I had a lot left over. If I had known I would have so much leftover, I would have opted to serve it over chips, rather than putting the chips inside it, to avoid soggy chips upon reheating.

We really liked this.  I only had a small bag of Doritos though so I ended up cooking about 2 cups of noodles and made a noodle casserole out of it, topping it with cheese and crushed Doritos.

This was very good! It was a tad soupy, but that could be because I didn’t have the full 4 cups of chicken. It definitely had a lot of flavor. It’s pretty heavy, so it won’t be in our regular dinner rotation, but I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent if you omit adding tortillas to the recipe and add them after the casserole is cooked. I put the tortillas in a bowl and spoon the casserole mixture over the top. I then squeeze a little fresh lime juice over it and it is absolutely amazing! Don't omit the cilantro on top it adds a whole other level of flavor that puts this dish over the top.

This was so good! Instead of adding crushed tortilla chips though, I omitted that from the recipe and cooked the rest of it as is. Then I served it layered over tortilla chips and ate it as nachos instead of a casserole. It was a big hit in my house!

I didn't use Cream of Chicken Soup.  Instead I had bought a jar of green chili and used that.  Also didn't have black beans but I did have homemade pinto beans so used that.  Also, didn't have sour cream so omitted that.  I also used tortilla chips to top off the casserole.  Came out delish!

So good! I always make recipes the first time just as stated. This is one of those very few times that I don't wish I had added/omitted something. Perfect just the way it is!

I made this today.  It was very good.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used only one can of soup.  I also added a layer of whole kernel corn and a layer of pinto beans.  My husband liked it too so that makes the recipe that much more impressive!

Delicious and easy! Cook times accurate. I made the chicken in my instant pot in the afternoon and made this for dinner. I used 1 can of soup, no beans, and hot and spicy taco mix to give it a kick. I used the mexican mix of cheese too, not just cheddar. I didn’t cook it with tortilla chips. We crumbled them on top afterwards and added a dollop of sour cream to our bowls. Everyone loved it!

Excellent! I didn't change anything on the recipe and this is delicious. The cilantro, chopped tomato and green onion on top give it so much flavor. I plan to make this for our next guests. Thanks!

I made this with a few suggestions... I only used one can of soup, added rice (cooked with chicken stock) as a layer on the bottom, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I put crushed chips only on top. Yummm!

My family loves this casserole. I leave out the chips and serve them separately. I also use half the amount of cream of chicken soup. It was too soupy with two cans per batch. I pour mine over a bed of Scoops and top with salsa. It's delicious and this is very easy to make.

very good. Used soft tortillas in between the chicken mixture. Also, I  only used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and it was creamy enough. Lastly, I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream to make it healthier. no one could tell the difference.

Very good. I wasn't quite sure what to expect but everyone here really enjoyed it. Simple to put together. I did not have tomatoes with green chilies so i used regular tomatoes and just a couple shakes of cayenne. I will be making this again. Thank you for the great recipe.

Easy and as just as you’d imagine given the recipe items. Instead of shredding chicken, I cut three chicken breasts into cubes and sautéed in olive oil, then added to the mix. Wonderful!

This is the second time I’ve made this   Very tasty but it needs more liquid —. Like some chicken broth abt a cup. I made two 8 x8 casseroles and found it needs more than the 30 min. Next time I would try 40 then the cheese for 10 min

This recipe is so yummy. I didn’t add the tortilla chips in the casserole. It ended up being more of a dip. We always have leftovers and I didn’t want soggy chips the next day.

I made according to the directions and it was a hit with my guests. To spice it up a bit I drizzled Mrs. Renfro’s Jalapeño Green Salsa on my serving and my guest did to after seeing the look on my face.

I can’t give this lower than two stars because I deviated from the recipe. It was still good... I used canned chicken, added black beans and corn to the recipe and used “hint of lime” tortilla chips. Also put a few dashes of tapatia :) I put the chips on top and covered with cheese and also put chips in the bottom of the bowl when serving. This did come out a little soupy but it could be because I used canned chicken. Over all this is delicious and SUPER quick and easy to make. Whipped it up in 20 minutes!

Love this recipe.  I only used 1 can of chicken soup and only had pinto beans so I drained 2 cans and used them.  Next time I will not put chips in the middle and only what I think we will eat at one sitting.  Then add chips as I reheat.  I think I will also put in 2 smaller dishes and freeze one.  Although, I could eat the big dish if I didn’t use self control.  This is my new favorite!

I have made this multiple times. I usually cook the chicken in a crockpot, or if I am rushed I use part of a rotisserie chicken (make enchiladas the next night with the rest of the chicken). I read the reviews first and have only ever made it with one can of soup, less cheese and no chips. I serve it as a taco dip with chips on the side. This is always a hit with zero leftovers.

I made this in a pinch, had leftover grilled chicken I wanted to use. It was a huge hit. My family loved it. We didn't even have leftovers.

This was super easy as I had leftover chicken already in the fridge. I made it exactly as the recipe said and it was a huge hit!  Next time I may spice it up a bit with some jalapeños.

This was quick and easy to make and turned out delicious! I made it according to the recipe. It was moist but not runny and the perfect amount of flavor for my taste. I was worried because I used Nacho flavored Doritos but it was not too much at all! I imagine this recipe would be very forgiving, so I'll try adding corn next time because I love it in Mexican dishes.

Family favorite. Started to put it in the oven when I realized I Forgot to add the taco seasoning, duh! So I dumped it all back in a bowl and mixed it in. Back into the casserole dish it went. No layering? No problem. Won't waste my time since no one noticed.

Loved it!  I added a layer of mexican rice on bottom, added 1/4 tsp cumin and a sprinkle of ground red pepper to the chicken mixture, left out the beans and added a drained can of corn.  Followed the recipe after that.  It turned out very good.  Oh, and used a bit more cheese.  We loved it !

I made this and followed the recipe.  I think it was not as cheesy as I wanted it to be.  Next time I will try the cheese soup instead of the cream of chicken.   Great base to start from.  Thank for sharing.

Read other reviews and left out the chips and it turned out really good, but more like a dip/appetizer. Next time, I will only use 1 can of the soup to make it thicker

Really delicious. I adjusted to our higher spice level by adding sautéed onions, spicy black beans, diced green peppers , and as others advised, only one can of soup, and fewer tortilla chips, only put between layers, none on top, but broken into smaller pieces. And added corn. Will make again for sure.

This was really good!  I only used 1 can cream of chicken soup, 1/2 can corn, 1/2 jar salsa and a little more sour cream than what the recipe calls for.   Will be making this again.

I love this recipe.  I made it for the first time tonight and my husband and I loved it .  I understand the point of view of others who feel recipes should be judged based on the original only but the notes of changes in recipes have been invaluable to me.  So,  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and did the following:  I used 1 can of cream of chicken and it was nice and creamy,  instead of tomatoes with chilies, I used the same amount of salsa.  I added a teaspoon of smoked paprika and a sprinkle of onion powder. When layering I used the cheese only and reserved the chips for a topping under the final layer of cheese which I changed to a 4 cheese Mexican blend.  The next time I make it, I will add a drained can of corn and about a quarter cup of chopped black olives.

This was a huge hit. I didn't add the chips in while it baked. I added those to the plate and the piled the goodness on top. I highly recommend this for a week day meal as it is super simple. ??

I made this recipe for my brother and he loved it! He raved for days about how good it was. I didn't have any tortilla chips so I substituted with pasta. No tomatoes either. Pace Picante sauce took the tomatoes place. Super good! Thanks!

This was amazing. I used rotisserie chicken, 99% fat free cream of chicken and added corn. Like other people said I serve chips on the side instead of baking it in the dish. Will definitely be making this again!

I decided to make half this recipe for the two of us.  Based on some reviews that said this had too much soup in it, I used half a can of the soup and froze the other half.  I also used half a can of black beans and froze the rest of those as well.  I drained a full can of Rotel and used all the tomatoes and added back a little more than half of the liquid, which in hindsight was a little too much liquid.  I didn’t layer anything; I just mixed everything together except the tortilla chips, and put it in a casserole.  I made it early in the afternoon, covered and refrigerated it and then, leaving it covered, baked it for about 40 minutes.  I did think after heating that mine was a little too “loose,” but I think cutting back on the Rotel liquid will solve that.  Next time I may also add the full can of black beans to my half recipe version.  I served this over rice, garnished with green onions and served tortilla chips on the side.  Hubs liked it so much he ate all the leftovers for lunch the next day.  If you have cooked chicken on hand, this is a snap to put together, and I’ll be making it again for something quick and easy and tasty.

This is a very good recipe that was a cinch to put together. I made it exactly as written, and the whole family enjoyed it; all thumbs up around this family's table. It was served with tortillas, pinto beans and Mexican rice. I'm adding this to the meal rotation. It'll be made again soon.

Super easy, great flavor. My husband loved it, definitely wants it again. I had to sub a few ingredients based on what was in my pantry (cheddar Bugles for tortilla chips & kidney beans for black beans.), Still really good, I feel like you cannot mess up this recipe.

Made this for a club potluck & won 2nd place in the contest. It was very easy & they almost licked the dish clean. Beautiful presentation with the fresh chopped tomatoes & cilantro on top. This will be one of my all time favorites & I did not change a thing!

It took 45 minutes to cook. Unless you are serving immediately, don't put cilantro on top as it looks dried out within fifteen minutes. It was delicious.

A keeper!! Good taste .. I did half the recipe ... used "tomatoes and green chilies" from ROTEL  (for the spiciness)  ... and thin layers of tostito chips ... they get soft .. but that adds flavor ... then we ate it with tostitos and sour cream.

This is wonderful! I have made this several times but I used pinto beans and do not add the chips as they go soggy. I put on top of rice and and crumble the chips on top of that it is lovely :)

We loved this!  I added mexicorn to the mix.  It does lack a "kick".   I'll add a litle heat to it next time.  I suspect the leftovers will be even better.

I did this in a crock pot & chopped the chicken first.  Used salsa instead of  canned tomatoes. Layered it twice with taco chips & cheese on each layer. Used less taco chips. Was very good

This was very good and easy! I used only 1 can of cream of chicken soup as someone else suggested and left the chips out. We put chips on our plates and put this yummy, filling "dip" on them.  We drizzled enchilada sauce on top. Extra sour cream would be good, too! Even my picky 3 and 6 year old enjoyed it.

This was really good.  As another reviewer suggested,  I used a can of chicken gravy in place of one of the soups.  Also used lightly salted chips. Good with sour cream as a garnish too.

my son is on a specialized diet that requires us to boil a whole chicken to make bone broth for him every 3-4 days, as you can imagine my husband and I have had chicken in every possible way known to man! this casserole is definitely in the top three of our chicken casserole recipe book. The flavors are strong enough to mask the chicken and make yet another boiled chicken casserole palatable without being over powering and it has just the right amount of heat to it. I certainly recommend giving it a try.

This was delicious as written. I cut the recipe in half but cooked as directed. I liked the way the chips softened up, it added extra flavor . I didn't have any cilantro but wish I would have.
I will definitely make this again!

I decided to substitute a layer of tortillas in the center instead of chips after reading several reviews, and it turned out pretty runny - more like chip dip (or it could be good filling for enchiladas, which is what I'll do with left overs).  Maybe I just needed more tortillas.  Or I should have used half the soup as some others suggested.
I did put a layer of crunched chips over the top after it was done though.   Probably will not make again but gave it 3 stars because the flavor was good.

Very good!  I just made some minor additions, one small can of chopped green chilies, a little extra taco seasoning and sliced black olives.  This was a perfect weeknight "oven slammer" dinner for a busy working mom : )

this recipe is easy and delicious, but the sodium content is through the roof!

The 2nd time I made it I used fresh corn tortillas and cut them into triangles-less salt than chips. I also used the light cream of chicken soup and reduced it to one can.

The next time I make it I might eliminate the taco seasoning packet. If you buy black beans with cumin & jalapenos added you don't need it.

I've made this a couple of times and my family loves it.  I used cream of mushroom soup because I didn't have the chicken soup.  I also added chiles which added an extra zip to the flavour.  So delicious!

So I made this as more of a dip than a casserole and it was fabulous. I also made a few changes based on what I had on hand and what I like. I only had 2 cups shredded chicken, but didn't feel like it was lacking. I like my Mexican food spicy so I used the hot Rotel and hot and spicy taco seasoning. I also added jalapeños because I like them. Instead of using two cans of cream of chicken soup, I used one can cream of chicken and one can fiesta nacho cheese. I did not have any cheddar cheese on hand so I used Mexican shredded cheese instead. I served it as dip with the chips on the side. It was a hit! I brought it into work and all the girls asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again! Next time I may add onions because, well, I just love them.

I made this tonight using left over fried chicken from last nights dinner. I will be making this again. I had to use cream of mushroom soup because that is all I had but I added a teaspoon of chicken bullion to it. I will use more cheese and less corn chips next time. Other then that will make as is.

I would give 5 stars but I changed quite a bit. Instead of layering it like lasagna, I served the chicken taco mixture over rice with the cheese, green onions and cilantro on the side. Everyone loved it.

I can't believe my kids and husband liked this, only because it rarely happens that the entire family likes the same food! I did just crumble the nacho chips over the casserole by guessing and not measuring. I put less cheese on it, my husband does not care for cheese. I would suggest putting taco sauce over it when eating it, that made it even better! I will make this dish again!

My family and friends loved this dish. It is tasty, inexpensive and easy to make . I purchased a 5.00 precooked chicken to save time. This is the perfect dish to have at a party or to feed a hungry family.

We love this recipe!  The only changes I make is that I use cubed chicken rather than shredded and I also add a bag of frozen corn. This is a staple recipe in our house.

This recipe was awseome and can double-task the next day, since it seems to make quite a bit! I don't normally measure, but I think I followed the recipe pretty closely. I made a few changes, I didn't add the tortillas when it cooked, I didn't use them at all until the next day in fact! I didn't cover the dish either, just added some cheese on top and let it melt to perfection in the oven, I used slightly drained stewed tomatoes versus diced, and tossed the fresh tomatoes with fresh cilantro before topping. It seemed a bit much for one casserole dish, so I used two and didnt bother layering. The best part is usingthe lefovers the next day though! I chopped the dish in a processor a bit, added some siracha, as much cream cheese as I thought was needed, baked it in the oven a bit and TA DA! A beautiful dip for the tortilla chips!! Was a hit!

My boyfriend and I loved this meal!! Thank you so much for the recipe, it was delicious! I did add a bag of frozen, microwaved corn to it which enhanced the texture of the meal! I forgot to take a pic before we dug in, so unfortunately cannot post this time! I will be making it again and will post a pic next time!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe.  my husband and daughter are both particular. ..I like to call them food connoisseurs. lol. 

the fact that I was able to make this recipe as is with the exception of adding sour cream at the end...speaks volumes for my household.  As a matter of fact...I'm making it again tonight,  which is was promoted me to do the review.  you've definitely gotta try it. :)

I didn't use onions and only used sour cream on the top half of the chicken mixture. This was amazing.. We ate it like a dip for the most part.

Instead of using 2 cans of soup I also used 1 can soup with 1 jar chicken gravy and used the seasoning from Mccormick's quesadilla casserole . It was wonderful.
