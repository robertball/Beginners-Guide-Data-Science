Absolutely wonderful!!!  I used the traditional method, without the bread maker.  I dissolved the tbs. sugar (I used brown) in the water, along with the butter.  If you use cold butter, just boil the water, and pour it over the butter while stirring.  By that time the temp is quickly brought to the ideal temp for adding the yeast.  Cover with plastic wrap, and fix the pudding while the yeast foams.  I add the egg, pudding mix and milk together and stir.  Then, I measure out the flour, adding 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten to all purpose flour, (I had no bread flour).  By that time, the yeast is ready for mixing.
I add the pudding mixture, mixing well, followed by the flour.  I knead the dough until it forms a ball-all done in same bowl.  After I remove the ball, I pour a bit of oil in, and replace the dough and roll it in the oil.  The rest is pretty self-explanitory.  After rising for about 1 hr. I roll out, spread filling, cut, and rise again.  I cook for my boyfriend and the mechanics at his shop and they wont stop raving about them!  My boyfriend says that it's the only time the ENTIRE SHOP just sits in silence, awing over how good they are!!  A++++ recipe! Thanks Miss Alix!

I made Christmas Eve a.m. using bread machine, cut (15 rolls fit great), put in pan, covered with plastic wrap sprayed with Pam and refrigerated.  Christmas a.m. I removed from fridge and let rise about 40-45 minutes.  Baked 325 (Convection oven setting) for 20 minutes and they came out great.  I used the whole box of pudding and increased the butter (for filling)to 1/2 C., increased the cinnamon to 2 T. and ommited the nuts.  I also used the "Clone" icing recipe from this site.  They were absolutely WONDERFUL! My Mother in law asked for the recipe and said that she would never cook GRANDS again!  I made again and froze; place on parchment papered cookie sheet and freeze. Once frozen place in freezer bag.  Remove rolls the night before and put in a buttered pan and refrigerate overnight as described above.  Next morning let rise, bake and ENJOY!

I followed this recipe exactly. I made 2 batches of rolls (48 all together).  Instead of raising and baking again, I put the cut rolls on a greased tin foil covered cookie sheet and froze.  After the rolls were frozen, I placed them in a freezer bag so I could take out however many I wanted.  I took the rolls out of the freezer the night before serving.  I made caramel topping for one pan, the other pan I greased and placed the rolls in to be frosted after baking and placed the pans in the refrigerator.  The next morning, I took them out of the fridge, let them raise for about 30-40 minutes, then baked at 375 for about 20 minutes.  I turned both pans over and frosted one pan.  The rolls were excellent and I still have 1 dozen of frozen rolls left to use.  You can have fresh baked cinnamon rolls any time!

I didn't use my bread machine, and  they still turned out great!  Just let
the dough rise for about an hour. Then make the rolls and let the rolls 
rise for another 45 minutes or so.  These are really good.  I will definately 
make these again.

I'm a very experienced baker and love a great, gooey cinnamon roll.. but these were not my favorites.  I think it was the addition of the vanilla pudding mix as it gave them an "off" flavor.  Not sure why it was an ingredient, but I always make a recipe exactly as written here first before reviewing.. nothing worse than making a ton of changes and then commenting that the recipe wasn't good.  Not sure how it might be without the pudding mix or with all purpose flour, but I felt the bread flour made them far too dense and heavy.  I didn't even bother putting the icing on them.. they just weren't that good, sorry.  Also, I'm a traditional baker and I can convert any bread recipe that uses a bread machine, but as a traditionalist.. I wish these recipes gave stand mixer variations.. Bread machines just don't cut the mustard for this baker.  I like to control the look and feel of my dough and can tell by touch and site whether a dough will work or not.. in a bread machine, you're baking blind.

These cinnamon rolls were really, really good. I used regular granulated sugar instead of brown sugar for the filling. Plus to make them extra rich and gooey, I made a delicious caramel sauce for the bottom by melting 1/3 cup butter. Then I stirred in 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of vanilla ice cream and cooked the mixture, stirring frequently, just until thickened and bubbly. Then I poured it into the bottom of my pan. Like several others, I didn't use my bread machine. I dissolved the yeast in the warm water, added the rest of the ingredients and needed the dough just until smooth and elastic. Then, I placed the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning once to coat both surfaces, covered it with plastic wrap, and sat it on top of my warm stove to rise for about an hour. After that, I formed the rolls and put them in the pan on top of the caramel mixture, covered them once more and let them rise for 45 minutes until they doubled. Then, I baked them for 15 minutes, as directed in the recipe. EXCELLENT!

Excellent! I've made these three times in the past week because they're so good! I add in the full box of vanilla pudding, as others have suggested, and that makes them even more wonderful. I also made them and baked them immediately, after the 45 minute rise, and I made them and put them into two 8x8 foil pans and covered with foil and popped in the fridge to bake later. They turned out just as good and didn't need to rise before putting into the oven. 

I ALSO made a reduced-sugar version for the diabetics in my family. I tried it with sugar-free vanilla pudding and it turned out horrible, but then used half a box of regular instant vanilla pudding and the dough was wonderful. I substituted Splenda for the brown sugar and used Splenda instead of confectioner's sugar in the frosting and my diabetic guests were thrilled with the result.

For the regular sugar-filled rolls I made I did a combo of this frosting recipe and the clone of a cinnabon frosting recipe. I used 8 oz of cream cheese, two cups of confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 2 tsp of milk and one stick of softened butter. Yummy and perfect!

I have made this recipe twice. I use raisins instead of nuts. I make them the night before , put them in the fridge and then set them out to rise and bake in the morning. Wonderful.

I had never made cinnamon rolls from scratch before this weekend when I tried this recipe.  These are great and easy even for a beginner like me! I don't have a bread machine so I used another reviewers suggestion and kneeded the dough and let it rise an hour before rolling it out.  Worked great.  The icing is quite rich so I may omit the cream cheese next time.  My husband loved these!  Thanks.

It has been over 8 years since I have had a Cinnabon. We don't have them where I live now. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I have never made Cinnimon rolls. All I can say is WOW!!! Not only are they easy to make. But they taste Wonderful!!This will be my one and only Cinnimon Roll recipe! Thank You Miss Alix. I doubled the butter/brown sugar mixture to make them extra gooey the 2nd time I made them. I froze half of the rolls from the last batch, before cooking, to see how they do, I will let you know.

Beyond fantastic. I'm pretty new to yeast so I was a bit scared. Also, my oven isn't the greatest so I think next time I'll leave these in for about 25 min. 
Since I don’t have a bread machine here is what I did:
1.Sift flower into bowl and set aside.
2.Proof the yeast with the water and sugar and let sit for 10 minutes until frothy. 
3.Combine the butter, pudding mix, milk, egg, and salt. Mix with a mixer. 
4.Mix in the yeast mixture to the mixture in #2. 
5.Start to add the flour slowly. I added it about a half a cup at a time sifting it again. (I found that no matter what I make, it always seems to come out better when I double sift the flour.) I used the mixer until the dough got too dense to mix anymore. 6.Knead dough for about 8-10 min until it forms a ball.
7.Place ball in lightly greased bowl and roll to make sure the entire ball is lightly greased. This keeps the top part from becoming dry. Cover lightly and let rise for about an hour. I let my rise on the stove having the oven on a low setting.
8.After the dough rises, roll out into rectangle (mine was a little bigger then 17X10) For the inside part of the rolls, instead of using the given instructions I took the tips of some other reviews and did the following: I mixed together one stick of butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and 2 Tablespoons of cinnamon. (I didn’t use the pecans). I mixed all together with a mixer until it formed a paste-like material. I then just spread it as evenly as I coul

Do yourself a favor, make these cinnamon rolls! In a word: DELICIOUS!!! This was the first time I have ever made cinammon rolls and they turned out perfectly. My two daughters (and myself) loved them. These really are what you would call a gourmet cinnamon roll. The only thing I did differently was to  omit the nuts because my daughter doesn't care for them and I did cook them for only the 15 minutes in a glass 9 X 13 inch pan. They were really easy to make too because my bread machine did the hard part: the kneading. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Miss Alix!!

Fantastic!! I made a few changes based on reviews and my own likings. I added the whole box of pudding, so I omitted the sugar. I also added...let's say 1/8 tspn of cinnamon and 1/2 tspn of vanilla to the dough. Bumped up the salt to 1 tspn. I mixed it in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer. I allowed the dough to rest for 1 hour before i started rolling it out. Wow, the dough had a great feel to it...you just knew then this was going to be a great cinnamon roll!

These are great! I've made them twice in just over a month, and both times they turned out excellent. I don't have a bread machine, so I bloomed the yeast in the warm water (I also stirred the first amount of sugar into the water) for five or ten minutes until it was thick and sort of frothy. I melted the butter and mixed the milk in, then nuked it for maybe 45 seconds until it was just warm. I combined the salt, flour, and pudding mix, setting aside ½ cup or so. Then I used my stand mixer, with the dough hooks, to combine the dry mixture, the milk mixture, the yeast mixture, and the egg (beaten) until it was well-mixed and perfect dough. I kneaded in the set-aside amount of flour mixture, then put the dough in a greased bowl in the warm (NOT HOT) oven, to avoid drafts, to double in size for 45 minutes. I then rolled it out to about 20"x10". I cut it so one side was about 15"x10" and the other was 5"x10". I followed the rest of step 2, and then rolled the larger dough so the roll was 15" long and the smaller dough so the roll was tiny and 10" or so long. I cut the longer roll into 15 one-inch pieces and I cut the little roll into 16 3/4" or so pieces. I put the larger roll's pieces into a buttered 9x13 pan, and I put the tiny roll's pieces into a buttered 9x9 pan. I let them rise again in the warm oven for 45 minutes, then baked both pans for 20 minutes or so. This was an excellent technique for making this recipe work perfectly without the bread machine. Thanks, Miss Alix!

I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and the sugar for ten minutes, then added the butter, egg, warm milk, (I used the last of the buttermilk I had on hand), pudding mix, flour and salt. I did need a little more flour than what was called for in the recipe....about a quarter cup. I kneaded the dough with the bread hook for about five minutes, then set the dough to rise for an hour or so in a large greased bowl on a warm heating pad. I rolled out the dough and mixed the softened butter (I upped the butter to a full half cup as I read through the reviews before I made this--there was plenty of filling, IMO) together with the brown sugar and cinnamon before I spread it on the dough. I sliced them up and set them in a baking pan, covered them with foil and set them in the fridge overnight. In the morning, I set the cold rolls back on the warm heating pad to rise again for another hour or so. 400 degrees for about.....14 minutes and they were perfect. I made the icing and used a spoon to glob it on the top and as the icing warmed, I spread it with a knife. Very good. I'm not a big fan of cinnamon rolls and even I thought these were one of the best I've had. My family LOVED them. Thanks, Miss Alix for another winner! NOTE: I did not get 16 rolls out of this recipe--I actually got eleven regular sized rolls.

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever.  After I cut the rolls, I did not let them rise but just stuck them in the fridge until the next day.  I then let them sit for 30 minutes before baking and they came out great.  So light and fluffy!!!

Meant to include this tip: these freeze really well. I "dry freeze" them on a cookie sheet and then put them in freezer bags so I can bake what I need and not the whole batch. Just thaw and allow to rise to double before baking.

Amazing. I don't have a bread machine so I just threw all of the ingrediants up to the flour in my electric stand mixer. After the yeast started frothing I added the flour 1 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition and using the bread hook. After the last cup of flour I used the bread hook to kneed the dough for about 5 minutes. Then I put the dough on a lightly floured surface and kneeded it by hand for a few minutes before letting it rise in a greased bowl. These rolls and the frosting taste and look just like the ones you find at restaurants. YUM!!!

These are absolutely wonderful! They stay moist for at least 2 days after baking...that is, if there's any left!

Ok- I tried the "clone" recipe and it never turned out very good AT ALL.  They were very dry.  So i was leary when searching for a new CR recipe to try.  But oh my gosh, thank goodness i talked myself into trying this one!!! It is soooo good.  I had to hand some out to family so they could ENJOY the heck outta these.  We thought the icing would be too "cream cheesy" but it wasnt.  I also added a BIT more cinnamon and B-sugar to the filling.  Oh- go ahead and add the whole package of pudding.  I used 3/4 and threw out the rest, which was a waste; i should have just dumped it in, it wouldnt have hurt them a bit.  Maybe add a touch more milk to compensate for the added dry ingredients.  Anyhow, this one is a KEEPER says the hubby.  And the dough rose beautifully. (check out my pics of them)  So easy and so good.  A recipe to be proud of.

These came out wonderful!I made in a bread machine. I customized it some though in the following ways:  Instead of 1/2 teaspoon of salt I used a whole teaspoon. I also used all purpose presifted flour because I had no bread flour at the time. I also added more brown sugar, butter and cinnamon to the filling 1 1/2 cup of brown sugar, a whole stick of butter and six teaspoons of cinnamon. Instead of 3/4 cup of pecans I used a whole cup. I also used a cup of brown sugar, half stick of butter and 3 teaspoons of cinnamon in the bottom of the pan and placed to rolls on top so they would be extra gooey. For the frosting I used a 1/4 stick of butter 8 ounces of cream cheese 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, two teaspoons of milk and 2 cups of powered sugar. They came out great! Love this recipe!!!

This dough is easy to make and great to work with but I was expecting them to taste like Cinnebons and they did not.  I would try another recipe next time.

This recipe is SIMPLE and delicious!!! If you don't have a bread machine, you can use a mixer w/ a bread hook, and takes about 15 min. Just add a second rising time of about 45 min. I usually make them the night before, and then let rise for 45 min. the next morning before baking! For an extra treat, add a tablespoon of Bailey's Irish Creme to the icing. YUM!!!

The breadmaker aspect makes this recipe super easy and the pickiest person I know absolutely loves these.  I have to admit, though, that I DID double the icing, because I hold a firm belief that cinnamon rolls should be absolutely slathered with frosting.  :o)

I just made these - WOW!!! These turned out amazing!!! I do not have a bread machine so I worked the dough by hand: mixed yeast with warm milk, let stand 10 min. In bowl of electric mixer, mixed flour, pudding, sugar, salt. Added water to yeast mixture then added yeast mixture to dr ingredients and mixed on low speed until relatively uniform. Added butter and continued mixing on higher speed. Finally, I turned out the dough onto an unfloured surface and kneaded for ~10 min by hand. I then proceeded to follow the recipe: let it rise, roll, rise. I  substituted whole wheat flour for the bread flour -  even though this gave the buns a whole wheat flavour, which I am not sure I prefer, I  STILL love them!!! Just so fluffly, light, and tasty!!!! Simply DEVINE!!! I will DEFINITELY try these again, perhaps with all purpose flour. YUM!

These really were the best cinnamon rolls ever.  I made them for the guys at work and they were gone in minutes.  One person ate six of them!  I thought they were very easy to make using the bread machine.  I love this recipe and I love this website!

OK! Soooo I made the 'Clone' recipe here on this site and thought they were really really good (the dough was a bit tough but very good still) THIS recipe is PERFECTION! I think the pudding in the dough has made it very light and fluffy. I added about another tbsp of butter and brown sugar in the middle as that's all the sugar I had left but found it to be enough anyways..more may have been overkill...I'm ditching the 'clone' recipe and keeping this one. I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe because I found it to be the best I've tried. These rolls are NOT dry and like one of the reviews said , take care in rolling them kind of tight. I'm not in an area where I can get the mall version anymore and have missed them sooo much, not now! Oh and they are still nice and moist the next day...Thanks so much for this recipe!

Great Recipe! I don't have a bread machine, so I made the dough by hand and kneaded it a few times. Like another reviewer mentioned, I let it rise for about one hour before forming the rolls and then again afterward like the recipe calls for. Used walnuts instead of pecans. Don't really taste like the mall chain, but very good. It would be a lot easier with a bread machine—I may have to buy one.

I have made this twice and used the entire package of vanilla pudding mix. Also thankful that I doubled the filling because any less wouldn't be enough. We don't use packaged yeast so I substituted 2 tsps of bread machine yeast. My preference is to bake them in a 9 by 13 inch pan so they are attached and soft. No kidding that everyone says that they are the best cinnamon rolls they have ever had.

I really am unsure if 5 is an appropriate rating, not that these cinnamon rolls are bad, but I'm bordering on a rating of 3.5 
Prior to making these cinnamon rolls, I read the reviews and to be honest I was impressed by the many 5 star ratings this recipe was given.  Having seen the many reviews, I determined that the recipe would probably exceed my expectations.  The brown sugar filling  wasn't super sweet like many others proclaimed -at least not for me.  The frosting was great, but something in this recipe was missing...After following the directions exactly as stated and using the exact amount of the ingredients, I wish I could give at least a 4 star rating, but am having to give a 3.5 - I did take a picture of the cinnamon rolls, and they looked great, they are still soft...they just didn't have the right quantity of "gooey" cinnamon filling.  I'm guessing if I were to work w/ this recipe I could eventually give it a 5 star rating though.

This is a great recipe. I have tried many recipes for cinnamon rolls and these are by far the best. 
I left out the nuts and cut the rolls slighter bigger. They were great!!!

I hate to give these cinnamon rolls a 4, because the rolls are GREAT, but our family thought the cream cheese taste in the frosting was too strong.  If you prefer a sweeter frosting, this is our family favorite....1 stick butter, 1 egg yolk, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbs vanilla, and a little milk if too thick. I will definitely use this cinnamon roll recipe again!!

If you are buying those yummy cinnamon rolls from the famous nat'l chain, a bread machine will pay for itself if you don't have one!!! Absolutely wunderful!! Everyone will scramble to be on time for dessert!! If you try them once, you'll make them again and again....

The first time I made the buns they came out perfect!  Everyone loved them.  The 2nd time I let the buns sit for a few hours (instead of the suggested 45 minutes) and the buns were HUGE!!!  My family loves this recipe.  Thank you.

My son is a cinnamon roll fanatic and he absolutely loves these rolls.  I make them at least once a month for a Sunday morning treat.  After the dough cycle I make as stated.   Then I put them in the fridge overnight.  I then take them out an hour before baking.  They are just as good as if I were to make them on the same day.  A definite winner in my book!!!

These are absolutely awesome.  Made these with no deviations in my Kitchenaid mixer using the dough hook for about 5 mins on #2 setting.  Then I proofed dough in the oven for an hour.  Then after assembling the rolls, another hour in the oven on the proof setting.  then bake for 20 mins.  I frosted these while still warm and everyone thought these were delicious.  Thanks for this great recipe, will be making again for holiday gatherings...maybe this weekend!  Happy Easter!!!

These are the best cinnamon rolls!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using the whole box of pudding and all purpose flour.  It yielded a beautiful, silky dough that was easy to work with.  I don't use a bread machine.  I simply kneaded the dough for about 6 minutes, let it rise for 2 hours.  After that I made the rolls, put them in the refrigerator over night and baked them off the next morning.  They were outstanding.

This is a 10 Star Recipe!  They are absolutely sinful!  I baked as per the recipe except I did use the entire package of vanilla pudding.  I don't think that made a big difference either way.  I don't have a breadmaker so I just proofed the yeast in the warm milk, water and sugar for 10 minutes.  I blended in my stand mixer by adding the yeast mixture, butter and egg slowly to the dry ingredients.

I used anothers reviewer's tip (possibly from another recipe) to cut into rolls.  USE DENTAL FLOSS!  Cut off about a 10" string of floss.  Slide it under the roll, pull up the ends and criss cross as if you're tieing your shoes.  This will slice the rolls without "squishing" the dough!  Nifty trick!  

I found the cream cheese icing to be just the perfect amount.  I got 12 nice sized rolls into my 9x13 pan.  Some people might prefer a bit more icing but I think it would be overkill.  

These are almost TOO good!

YUMMY! I made these for my boyfriend who doesn't really like cinnamon rolls, and he was hooked! I didn't have a bread maching either so I kneaded them by hand. I used a trick that I watched my mom doing growing up: I took a piece of string and put it under the "log" and pulled the string together to make perfect cuts that don't squish the rolls. I also used the entire package of pudding mix. The hardest part is waiting for them to rise!

I love this recipe - it really makes ya look good.  I don't have a bread machine, so I just mix up the dough and let it rise for an hour and then follow the instructions from there.  More often than not, I have dumped in the entire package of vanilla pudding and don't notice anything at all wrong with the rolls when they come out.  These are excellent and addictive.

These really do taste like the mall food court brand. But better because they are made in your home. Super simple for this first-time bread maker too. My entire family gobbled them up the first time I made them and they are picky.

My husband is sometimes hard to please, but he LOVED these.  They have the taste and texture of the famous mall/airport chain, are just as yummy, and a lot cheaper.  The bread machine makes them very easy to make.  It takes a while to get the finished product, but you don't have to slave over them the whole time.  I probably had only 20 minutes of labor involved in them.  The rest of the time you can do other things.  This is only my second attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls, but since they tasted so good and were so fun and easy to make, I'll never need another recipe.

this is just as tasty as the restaurant cinnamon buns, but 16 buns do not bake properly in a 9X13 pan. I cut these into 12 buns and cook in 2 9X13 pans or large cookie sheet. These rise nice and fluffy and the pudding adds a nice texture to the bun.

Should name these SIN-amon rolls!They were the perfect choice for our Valentine breakfast. I have made home made cinnamon rolls for years but these are the best I have ever made or eaten! To make them look like the mall Cinnabon rolls I cut them larger, 2 inches thick. They not only looked like the real thing, but with a good cup of hot coffee they were 'breakfast in bed' nirvana. My husband thought he had the best wife on Earth.I used the frosting recipe from Clone of Cinnabon. I don't own a bread machine so I put them together the old fashioned way. I proofed the yeast, then added the rest. Note: For people who don't have a lot of time, try doing the first rise in a warm oven. (110 degrees then turn it off and pop the bowl in the oven) This cuts the rise time in half and doesn't hurt the dough at all. Just put plastic wrap that's been sprayed with oil on the bowl to keep the dough moist. You can also do the second rise this way. Omit the plastic wrap. I will never use another cinnamon roll recipe besides this one! I thank you- my husband thanks you!

These are just like the rolls you get in the mall, only better!  I added pecans and went a little easy on the icing and they were great!  The bread machine makes it so easy.  Definitely a keeper!

So delicious, so easy-- and almost foolproof. I accidentally omitted the second rising before baking, and it didn't affect the rolls at all (as far as I or anyone else noticed).

What more can I say that hasn't been said?  This is so GOOD! This is the first time for me making this and I have to admit that I was a little nervous about 'messing' them up, but they are so simple to make and they are so good!  Thanks

Merry Christmas...I converted this recipe to be done without a bread machine...they turned out a perfect 10.  Light, fluffy, and finally, a recipe that is a keeper.  I am currently experimenting with having them from the freezer already risen, so, we can have fresh and warm on Christmas morn.

I reckon that this's the best cinnamon roll i ever ate! Not as buttery as those commercially-made ones but it meant tt its less oily and fewer in calories, nevertheless, its huge on taste. It was absolutely moist and light! I made it without a bread machine. Firstly, i placed made a well in the middle of the flour. Place tsb of sugar and yeast in the well. Add warm water. Then waited for 5 mins for the yeast to be activated. After tt, I placed the rest of the wet ingredients into the well and 3/4 pudding surrounding the flour. And beat using the dough hook. Knead the dough a little on a floured surface then place into bowl covered with a damp warm towel for an hr. When the roll was done, I cut it up using a thread placed at the bottom then intercrossed on top. Okay, this's the step which i think made it extra moist and wonderful. I used the same method (from 'Easy Foccacia' from this site) of placing the rolls into a warm oven for all my breads and it yields great results all the time. Fill a tray with boiling water and place it on the lowest rack of the oven (make sure the oven is cool) Then place the ready rolls on the rack at top of it for 1 hr to let rise. Remove the rolls and tray of water. Preheat oven and bake. Oh, I didnt use any frosting on top. It definitely can do without the frosting! I'll never buy cinnamon rolls from the store ever :)

THESE ARE INCREDIBLE! THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD! THEY ARE LIGHT, SOFT, MOIST,& NOT TOO SWEET, AND THE FROSTING IS...FORGIVE THE PUN..THE ICING ON THE CAKE! AND WITH THE DOUGH BEING MADE IN THE BREAD MACHINE, THEY GIVE YOU OPTIMAL RESULTS WITH MINIMAL EFFORT! MIGHT WANNA MAKE TWO BATCHES CAUSE THESE THINGS WON'T LAST!!!

These were absolutely delicious!!! I couldn't believe I actually made them myself! Not having a bread machine, I did as suggested by another user: dissolved the yeast in the warm water and sugar while I mixed the butter, pudding MIX (don't actually make the pudding...), warm milk, egg, and salt in another bowl. Mixed it all together and added flour. I kneeded it in my bowl for 8 minutes and covered tightly to let rise for an hour. After that I followed the recipe from step 2. Oh, one other thing I did was make that caramel sauce suggested by another poster. 1/3 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup vanilla ice cream, melt it all together, bring just to a boil, let cool til warm and pour it in the bottom of the pan before putting the rolls in for their last rising. I did halve the cream cheese in the icing and I thought it turned out just perfect. Great recipe!!! I thought they tasted just as good (prehaps even better) than the ones at the mall!!!

These are delicious.  They took me about three hours to make though.  I had a terrible mess afterwards, too.  (They rose up bigger than my bread machine and dough went everywhere.)    I'll only be making them for special occasions.

It is an excellent recipe. I did not have vanilla pudding mix so I used 1/4 cup of plain yogurt. I also did not want to use much sugar with the walnuts, so I mixed 2 bananas with walnuts and 2 tablesspoons of canolla oil instead of the butter and spred it on the dough. the Cinammon rolls came up perfect. thanks for the recipe

These are simply amazing! Just amazing....
I followed the recipe pretty much how it was written except I don't have a bread machine, so my stand mixer with the dough hook attachment worked great. Once dough was mixed, I let the mixer have at it for about 5 minutes, and then kneaded the dough for another 5 by hand. I doubled the filling recipe because I like ooey, gooey cinnamon rolls! Rolled out the dough, filled it up with the filling and raisins (didn't have any nuts), and then let the rolls raise for about 45 minutes. Baked as recipe stated, used the recipe icing, which was perfect. I'm going to have to freeze some of these bad boys because I could seriously eat the whole pan! BY MYSELF! These take awhile to finally get your end product, but having the stand mixer doesn't make them tedious to make. Will definitely be making these again..and again..and again....thanks for sharing!

Excellent!! Being that this is my first attempt at making cinnamon rolls, I completely relied on the suggestions of others. I didn't have a bread maker, so I used my KitchenAid with the dough hook. I let the yeast sit for a few minutes in warm water before continuing with other ingredients & used the full box of pudding. While yeast & water sit, heated oven to 175 degrees then turned off. Lightly oiled dough ball (in bowl) & the plastic wrap that I covered the bowl with. Placed bowl in oven to rise for about 75 minutes. While rising, I buttered a glass baking dish (using extra butter on the bottom of pan with a little brown sugar mixture sprinkled on top). Using dental floss(non-mint!), cut into 15 rolls (since it does fit in the pan better). Let rise again for about 75 minutes & baked. Spread the frosting recipe for Cinnabon Clone on to hot rolls. Really liked this frosting recipe & found extra was not needed. They came out perfect! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe and thanks to everyone else for the wonderful suggestions!!
One last warning! Do not eat rolls before trying to go to bed. You get a huge sugar buzz! Worst night of sleep I've had in a long time, but well worth it!

WOW! I printed this recipe last weekend, and since then I have made 1 single batch and 2 double batches and have plans to make it Christmas eve for our x-mas breakfast. I had planned on baking other items to hand out for x-mas, and decided this was much better! I do not own a bread machine but it is really easy to make without one. The dough is easy to roll out and I had not problems making a double batch. I too used a whole package of pudding mix and I doubled the icing recipe per batch. Very tasty, has a different consistency than a regular cinnamon roll. Everyone I gave them too loved them! Next time I might try adding raisins. Very good! Thanks for the recipe Miss Alix!

These were not anything to write home about.  Took too long to make, and didn't even come close to the ones they were compared to.  Save yourself the time and energy, quit being a cheap skate and go buy a box of the Entemann's Ultimate Cinnamon Rolls. Much better, much easier.

I printed out 3 different Cinnamon Bun recipes and made them at the same time to see which was my favorite.  This one was the hands down winner and I've made it many times in the past few years.  I really appreciate the dough, it's soft, elastic and extreemly easy to work with.  If your dough is too dry, as some have mentioned before, make sure you are measuring the flour using the correct method.  First aireate the flour by stirring it with a spoon, then SPOON the flour into a measuring cup until it's overflowing WITHOUT tamping down or shaking the measuring cup.  Next level it off with a straight edge, like a knife.  Using too much flour is common when you spoon the flour out of the container with your measuring cup because it is too firmly packed.  Too much flour will lead to heavy, dry dough that is difficult to work with and a dry /crumbly roll after it is cooked.  Just a suggestion.

This is a great recipe. i didn't have a bread maker so i let the yeast bloom in the 1/4 cup water and sugar. i used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook. i knead it by hand a little bit and did the rest as you instructed. i got rave reviews, even from my mom. she said they were better than hers

Great Recipe....great cinnamon rolls!  My rolls did not rise as much as they should have...I made then the night before as other's suggested and maybe that had something to do with it.  I will definitely get new yeast and try again!  My Hubby and 6yr old daughter definitely did NOT complain about how they did not rise completely....instead, they asked when I was going to make them again! Thanks for submitting this recipe

These are amazing. And really not hard to make at all. After I slice them, I place them in a buttered pan and place them in the fridge and then take them out the next morning...letting them sit for about 45 minutes before baking. It's just easier for me to make this in the evenings. Thank you for such a great recipe!!!

These are so good! I used my Kichen Aid mixer to knead the dough since i don't have a bread machine. I let the dough rise for about an hour, made the rolls and let it rise for another 45 minutes. I used all purpose flour because that's what I had, and I didn't add pecans becuse my husband doesn't like nuts - other than that I followed the recipe and they turned out perfect. The icing was just right for us - not too sweet. I can't wait to make these again. Thanks for a great recipe.

These are great!!  Since I did not have a bread machine, I first dissolved the sugar, yeast with the warm milk and water.  I then let it proof for about 10 minutes.  I then added the salt, egg and melted butter and gave that a quick mixing.  And finally I added the vanilla pudding and bread flour.  Mixed and then kneaded until smooth and elastic.  I returned the dough to a greased bowl (turned to coat dough) and let it rise for an hour.  They came out perfectly!!!  Oh....substituted raisins for pecans!  Thanks for sharing.

What beautiful rolls!  I do not have a bread machine, so instead I just mixed all of the ingredients in my stand mixer and then kneaded the dough on a floured surface until it was nice and smooth.  I allowed to rise in a greased bowl for about an hour and then followed the rest of the recipe.  Wonderful flavor, texture, and appearance.  I will surely be making these again!

Fantastic recipe - I've made thm 5 times now!!! I took the other reviewers advice and used the whole package of pudding mix.  I also add about 1 cup of raisins. 
Instead of covering the cinnamon roll pan with plastic wrap, I put the baking pan with the formed rolls inside a large clear garbage bag, tied a knot to lock in the moisture and then put it in the fridge overnight. Instead of a rich icing like the recipe called for, I just put a thin glaze of butter, milk and powdered sugar and apply this right after they come out of the oven to keep them from drying out.

Good with a cream cheese frosting on top.  I was surprised they came out so well.  I made them by hand since I don't have a bread machine (45 minute first rise, punch down, 45 minute second rise, roll out, 1.5-2 hour rise in pan), and the recipe worked wonderfully!

I adapted these cinnamon rolls for my daughter, who has food allergies.  I do not have a bread maker, but instead kneaded the dough by hand. I was also able to omit the egg completely; adding vanilla soy milk for moisture. I then let it rise for about an hour and rolled it and put it in the fridge overnight. They stored well and were ready to pop in the oven in the morning! I used the *better than cream cheese* for the frosting and my family loved them for Christmas breakfast! My daughter was so excited to be able to have *real* cinnamon rolls!

This is a very moist cinnamon roll.  As always, in a roll recipe, I find that if you keep the dough as sticky as you can and still work it, it will turn out softer.  And especially with a cinnamon roll recipe, softer is better.

I've tried to make cinnamon rolls before and failed.  I was so excited when I found this recipe and read all the wonderful reviews!  It was sooo easy and turned out great!  I did not have bread flour or the pudding.  I used regular flour and added a tsp. of vanilla and an extra T of sugar.  They were delicious and my family loved them.  I can't wait to make them again with the bread flour and pudding to see if they are better.

These rolls are great! I make them for my youth group on retreat and they are a hit every time.
I roll them out in advance and stick them in the freezer.  The night before, I set them in a pan in the fridge and they are ready to bake in the morning. 
If need be, you can sub 1 tsp. vanilla for the pudding.

I did as other reviewers noted and this recipe turned out wonderfully!  (I used my stand mixer instead of a bread machine.)  I was on a hunt for a great cinnamon roll recipe for years and this one finally ended it!  Thanks!  ** Notes from other reviewers that I followed:  Use a whole box of pudding mix.  Combine water, milk, & butter and heat till butter is melted. Add egg. Meanwhile, combine dry ingredients, reserving 1/2 cup flour for kneading. Add liquids to dry ingredients. Turn onto floured surface & knead in remaining 1/2 cup flour. Put in greased bowl & let rise about 45 minutes. Then continue with recipe instructions. Use frosting from Clone of a Cinnabon recipe instead.

great recipe! I increased the butter in the filling to 1 cup. I also cut an apple into small chunks and added that to the filling. To reheat the rolls take a sheet of paper towel, wet it, ring out excess water, wrap roll in it, put it on a plate, and microwave for 15-30 seconds. Tastes like fresh out of the oven.

These are WONDERFUL!!!  I've made them twice in 4 days.  They turned out fine using regular flour and bread machine yeast which was all I had on hand.  The icing was a little too strong cream cheese taste for my kids, so the second time I beat the cream cheese and butter until fluffy first and added at least another 1/3 icing sugar.  These will be made often at our house!

After I made these rolls, I quickly shared the recipe with many friends. A friend got up at 7:30am to make them! I made them for my sister's boyfriend, and he LOVED them so much that he sat at the kitchen table with his arm around the pan gaurding it from intruders, and threatened to hide the rolls in his room so his roomates could not find them.  

This is the ONLY Cinnomon Roll recipe you will ever need.  If you don't have a bread machine, the price of one alone is worth it to make these rolls. I never knew a recipe could so positively touch so many people. Thanks Miss Alex!!

Followed the recipe, except for making them the night before and putting in the fridge before letting them rise and baking. I took them out of the fridge in the morning and let them rise for about 30 minutes then baked.  Came out great!

This is my first review, I felt inclined after making this recipe.  My experience with making bread is nil.  Some reviewers were meticulous in how the ingredients were placed in the bread machine and what temperature the water and/or milk was.  Whatever!  I don't have the patience for that however I did follow the recipe to a T, using all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  I'm not a fresh baked bread connoisseur, I don't have an arsenal of different flours on hand.  I'm an all purpose girl.
That being said, would someone please come over and take these wonderfully gooey, deliciously cinnamony (not a word - I know) rolls away from me?  They are AWESOME!  The bread is soft with just the right amount of 'chew'.  The brown sugar, cinnamon and pecan filling is divine.  The cream cheese frosting is insane.  I've recently lost over 60 pounds, these rolls remind me of how and why I became so heavy to begin with.
Luckily I have a husband who I'd rather not find me sitting in a corner like a rabid dog, foaming at the mouth, with a tray of these in my lap.  To avoid that embarrassment I cut the smallest corner of one roll (I made 12 LARGE rolls) and enjoyed.  That was over 18 hours ago.  I'm still thinking of that one small(ish) bite.
I did not change the recipe at all except for the all purpose flour substitute.  Very easy recipe to make.  Fool proof.  And trust me, when it comes to baking homemade bread, I've made a fool of myself 100% of the time.  These came out perfect!

These cinnamon rolls are AWESOME! Since I don't have a bread machine I use my kitchen aid stand mixer instead. In the warmed mixer bowl I proof the yeast in the water and T of sugar. When that is ready I mix in the egg and vanilla pudding mix. Meanwhile I melt the butter in a saucepan, add the milk and salt and just warm it. Add to the yeast mixture and add the flour. Mix with the dough hook for 2 min and then knead on speed 2 for 2 min more. Turn into a greased bowl and let rise about an hour. Finish the rolls per the recipe. I will never use another recipe again!

Instead of dumping the first nine ingredients in a bread machine, I don't have one so I proofed the yeast first with the warm water and sugar for 10 minutes.   I used the full 3.4 oz vanilla pudding (didn't use sugar free as a reviewer said it did not taste good), not half of that.  I had the dough rise twice instead of once, the first after mixing in my food processor and the second after cutting into rolls with a sharp knife.  I also made the filling (used 1 stick of butter, 1 cup brown sugar, and 2 Tablespoon cinnamon, no pecans since my son doesn't like nuts) into a paste so that it doesn't fall off when rolling.  I froze some of the rolls for baking later in the week.  I saved some frosting for that time.  It sure is a long process, but worth it!

First time I used my garage-sale-find bread maker and they came out great!  I only had a small package of sugar-free vanilla pudding so I put that in and put in another tablespoon of sugar and my family raved about them!!  Just like the mall and a lot less expensive!

Amazing!  I followed the popular reviews and used the whole package of pudding mix (which means I needed a bit more water in the dough).  I also left out the nuts, but followed the rest of the recipe as described.  They were delicious!  I've made this recipe three times so far (once was an orange version), and all three were a hit.

I had a little trouble with the yeast (made them the traditional way) so these came out kind of hard and crusty as opposed to moist and chewy. Overall though, a great recipe. One point of clarification could be useful: is the cup of milk in addition to the milk required by the instant pudding recipe, or is it the same thing?
Anyways, still turned out great- especially love the filling, not too much and not too heavy :)

Awesome cinnamon rolls and the icing is just right! Only a few adjustments, used AP flour and since I don't have a bread machine, I used a hand held mixer on med speed until ingredients combined fully then turned into greased bowl, covered with plastic wrap and placed in warmed microwave for 1 hour.  After that then I followed the recipes.  Will definitely make these again!

Let me the 891st person to review and join the countless others who rave about these.  They are yummy.  My fault I didn't use the entire filling because I thought what I put in was plenty.  Wrong, put entire filling amount if not more.  I like many other used entire packet of pudding. I used Kithcen Aid with hook to mix until it couldn't handle anymore then I flopped dough onto counter and hand kneeded to get all flour incoporated.  Sprayed pot with pam, placed dough in there, covered with pot lid and put in my oven (turned off).  Rose beautfully.  Also, in baking pan I melted butter about 1/4 cup and added brown sugar/cinnamon mixture to bottom.  Sort of like a pineapple upsided down cake. Then place cut rolls on top of that, let rise for another 45 min and bake.  My baked in 19 min to perfection.  After baking I flipped my cinnamon rolls into a platter letting the brown sugar goodness drip all over buns.  Wonderful.  Will be making again. Update: Made a second time but this time with evaporated milk because I didn't have reg milk and didnt turn out as good as the first time.  Don't know why, but I won't be doing that again. My dough didn't rise as nice as the first time and evaporated milk was teh only thing I did different.

I don't know what to say,but I'm extremely disappointed. As soon as I saw the bread flour I should have known,but I wanted to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt. These came out tasting like bread with cheesecake frosting. They were very bland even though I put cinnamon and vanilla in the bread machine as they were mixing. These are nothing like cinnabon.  I'm upset that I wasted my time and ingredients. I guess I'll keep searching.

Just made these today and thought they were fantastic! My family thought they were better than Cinnabon and that is a lot coming from them. My 13x9 pan was great but the middle rolls were more doughy than the outside ones...

Fantastic recipe.  I've made these twice and they've been a hit each time.  They are tender and moist and taste great.  The only modification I made the second time was to add the full box of pudding as some folks had suggested - it added just a little extra tenderness.  I made them the day before and refrigerated them in the pan.  The next day, I took them out an hour before baking, then cooked them up.  I put some of the frosting on as soon as they came out of the oven so it could sink into the rolls.  Don't do what I did the first time and forget to lightly flour your work surface before rolling them out or you're going to have a difficult time forming your rolls.  Also, if you do cut them with a knife, use a bread knife and, after making your first cut, lightly dust your kinfe with flour between each cut - your cuts will be much smoother and cleaner.  Awesome recipe, thanks Alix!

What could be better than soft, chewy, tasteful, cinnamon rolls made from scratch. I made these with my mixer as I don't own a bread machine and personally I couldn't taste the difference, my husband is in awe that they are better than the store bought and retail chains. I also used active rapid rising yeast, and I proofed twice (once when the dough was made and then a second time when I cut the log into the rolls)....Other than that followed the recipe to a "t". This is a must recipe to have in any box.

My family are stark raving mad for these cinnamon rolls. Many say this recipe is the best they have ever had.

Miss Alix - you ahve made me famous in Thomaston, GA.

I have had to limit the number of times I will make these cinnamon rolls. I usually double the recipe (in a mixer) and invite a huge group of friends for breakfast.

These are really yummy and I've made at least 5 batches this week for a church sale, & friends.  

My only changes are that I wanted more cinnamon so I've upped that quantity a little.  I also needed a lot more than 45 minutes for the rolls to rise.  Even in front of the oven where it is warm, they take a long time to rise.  I did one batch overnight, having it in the fridge first and those took a good 2 hours to do any rising once I pulled them out.

I also needed more baking time, so it was closer to 20-30 minutes in the oven.

The cream cheese frosting is good, but a little too strong for me, so I would only put 2 or 3 oz. of cream cheese in, and/or add more powdered sugar & milk.

Gave four stars b/c I had to tweak the recipe the second time around to get "perfection".  I used a whole package of cheesecake flavored pudding, 2 1/2 t. yeast, and I didn't use bread flour so I did 4 c. all purpose and 2 T. gluten.  I also added more cinnamon to the inside mixture.  I ate FOUR out of the oven, so I feel sick and I am ashamed but  are they good!!!!!!!!!

Every bit as good as I expected! Not cakey like usual cinnamon rolls, but light and fluffy. And the icing! Wow, definitely perfect for the roll. If you like the mall cinnamon rolls, this is the recipe for you.

Look no further for an awesome recipe for cinnamon rolls!  I doubled the frosting recipe but even 1 1/2 times would be fine. I made everything else by-the-book and my company raved about them. I put my refrigerated egg in a cup of warm tap water for a few minutes to hurry up to "room temperature".  Also, a trick I learned in school (maybe someone else has already mentioned this?) is to use unflavored dental floss to "cut" the cinnamon roll into pieces.  Place the floss under the roll where you want to cut it, then cross the floss and pull firmly.  The floss will make an even "cut" and will not squish your roll like a knife tends to do.  Hope this helps - enjoy!!

Where do I begin......this recipe produced the most amazing rolls. Absolutely delicious!!!  The rolls were light and flavorful. I used the entire box of pudding as others have suggested and doubled the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon for the filling and omitted the nuts. My husband, who does not like anything “sweet and gluey”, proclaimed these to be the best rolls he has ever eaten. He said these were better than any roll you can buy at the local mall.  Reheat them for 20 seconds in the microwave and they taste like they just came out of the oven. Thanks Miss Alix for sharing this recipe.

I thougth these were SO MUCH BETTER then Cinnabun. Much lighter in texture! I generiously buttered the pan and sprinkled it with a little of the brown sugar mixture so the bottoms would be gooey- next time I think I will add a little more. I followed other's recommendations and made the Clone of Cinnabun frosting (basiclly the frosting from this recipe without the milk added). And not being a big fan of nuts in my cinnamon buns, I left them out. 
I don't own a breadmaker but was able to make this anyway- I used my KitchenAid stand mixer but I'm sure you could knead it by hand. I added all the ingredents and used the dough hook to mix it for about 5-7 mins then let it rise until doubled and followed the rest of the directions from there.
One hint for anyone who finds that their dough does not rise- when you make them again- put the yeast in then add the warm milk and the warm water (not hot), let it sit for a moment then add the remaining ingredents.
These were so easy (just time consumming- like anything made with yeast) and so good- I will be using this recipe A LOT! Thanks for sharing.

These are to die for!!  I've made them twice in the last week; I tried mixing the butter, brown surgar (dark) and cinnamon together and then spread it on the dough, and it was a lot easier.  I also used a whole box of pudding mix and added golden raisins.  The clone cinnabon frosting from this site is delicious, but I'll use less this time; there was too much frosting for us the first time...but I've never had a real "Cinnabon", so I can't really compare...but then, my family thinks these are incomparible, anyway!!  Try them!!

Very yummy!  I also didn't use a bread machine, just prepared the dough the "old fashioned way".  I also made a sauce of butter, brown sugar, vanilla and milk like another poster, and poured on the bottom of the pan.  I also sprinkled some extra cinnamon and brown sugar over the top of the rolls before baking.  This recipie is time consuming, but easy to do and well worth the effort.  Thanks for a new family weekend treat!

This recipe is fantastic! My husband does not like sweets and he even raved about these.  I made them two days ago and have had numerous requests to make them again.  The vanilla pudding makes these soft and moist.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these rolls for the first time to take on our July 4th camping trip! They were a huge hit, everyone loved them! I baked them ahead of time and just saved them in the fridge until I left (about a day and a half later) and apparently they still tasted just as good! I am making them again (today) so that I can taste them when they're fresh out of the oven!!

These are wonderful. I've tried a couple of other recipes, and they never turned out as well as these. I don't own a bread machine yet, but I let the dough rise for an hour, and then punched it down several times over the course of another hour, and then followed the recipe like normal. Excellent! Your delicious recipe is going to make me fat Miss Alix, Thanks! :)

This makes a lot of cinnamon rolls so when we finished we had to share.  Our neighbors thought they were the luckiest people!!  Now, when we're invited over we're asked to bring cinnamon rolls.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Best cinnamon rolls I've ever baked. I've always made stiff, over-baked cinnamon rolls with other recipes, but after some research I created something SPECIAL and I want to share it with you. I made my cinnamon rolls using a kitchen aid mixer with the hook attachment and it came out fine. Just put all of the ingredients into the bowl and mix it. 

My secret to making soft, tender, moist cinnamon rolls is to ONLY USE 3- 3 1/4 cups of bread flour for the ENTIRE batch. Start with 2 cups of bread flour and mix everything with the paddle attachment. Then switch the attachment to the hook and add 1/4 cup at a time until the dough barely leaves the sides of the bowl. The dough should be very soft and slightly sticky. Let the dough knead for 5 minutes on medium low. Turn the dough onto a floured surface and let it rest for about 10 minutes. Even though the dough may feel sticky, just sprinkle some flour on top of it, the rolling pin and on your hands. It won't stick once you roll it out. I like to roll mine thinner and I use floss to cut them into 12 pieces instead of 16, that way they fit my 9x13 pan and are bigger cinnamon rolls.  

I hope it works out for you as it did for me.

I wanted these cinnamon rolls to be as good or near as good as Cinnabon's rolls.  Well, they're better than that.  Everything from the flavor to the texture of the crumb (moist, gooey, melt in your mouth delicious) was superior.  Based upon other reviews, I added the entire box of instant pudding and I increased the amount of cinnamon/brown sugar filling by 50%.  I made the right call on both counts because they couldn't be any better and if they could be better, I couldn't tell you how!  I got rid of my bread machine years ago because it was rarely used, but no matter because my KitchenAid mixed everything and kneaded the dough expertly.  I kneaded them at half speed for 10 minutes, and I think next time, I'll knead them for 5 minutes in the mixer and a few minutes by hand because the dough is so pleasing to touch; elastic, soft and silky.  I can't think of anything else to add.  You will be delighted with this recipe!

These are fantastic!!! Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Brought them into work and they disappeared in no time at all. To quote a colleague: “they are a warm gooey bliss”. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again.

I had a great Cinnamon roll recipe but lost it a while back. I was looking for a new one ever since and i was never truly happy with them. 
But those rolls are just delicious. 
I always make double the recipe and freeze the ones that we won't be eating. 
Great recipe.

Yes, you can make these without the pudding mix. I left it out, since I didn't have any. The only other minor changes I made were that I also decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the white sugar in the dough from 1 tbsp to 1/4 cup. I also added raisins liberally to the filling. I baked them for 25 minutes. They were delicious, and the frosting was outstanding. Great recipe!

Yummy! Very close to the actual Cinnabon! The only thing I would change is putting 12 rolls in the baking pan instead of 16. Mine were really scrunched up.

These rolls are to die for!  This was my first time making cinnamon rolls and they were super easy to do with my bread machine.  I used dental floss to cut the rolls which is way easier than trying to slice, so I highly recommend that.  I added the pudding mix as written.  I found these were sweet enough without needing to ice them, but did make the cream cheese frosting for my girls.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow - delicious!  But must confess that I did modify the recipe to try to duplicate a local bakery's version.  The only change was to use 2 1/2 cups of all purpose flour and 1/1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, plus subbed the nuts for raisins.  No icing for us, but I did invert the pan after baking so the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture ran back down.  Will be making again in the very near future, like tomorrow as requested by the family.  Thanks, Miss Alix ... fantastic recipe.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I added an additional 2tsp of  cinnamon, 1tsp of nutmeg, all purpose flour, and used store bought cream cheese frosting as well. (having the extra frosting was actually why I decided to make cinnamon rolls). I also did not use a bread machine. I cut mine extra large (about 2inches, instead of one) So I had half as many extra large cinnamon rolls. They were incredible. I will never go to the mall for ridiculously expensive (though delicious) rolls again. After we had them this morning my boyfriend looked at me sweetly and said "I love you", when I laughed, he said "oh, not just because of the cinnamon rolls, either" haha. They say the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, I guess they're right. ;) Thanks again.

GREAT RECIPE..  I didn't use the pudding mix, because I didn't have any, so I added approx 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract to the dough, and used a rapid rise yeast instead of the regular active dry yeast. Also I mixed the dough in a stand mixer not in a bread machine.   I put the dough in a lightly greased bowl to rise and once it had doubled in size I rolled and cut the rolls as the recipe directed. I then placed them in a buttered 9x13 dish and put it in the fridge over night.    The next morning I simply put them straight from the fridge into the oven and THEN turned the oven on.  That way they warmed up as the oven warmed up.  Once the oven reached 350 I let them cook for about 20-25 minutes.  They came out perfect!    I can't wait to try these again with the pudding mix included.  So YUMMY!!

This dough was like air! I've never made such a light dough before, it must be the pudding? They were delicious and we didn't even have time to make the icing they were already eaten. I used my bread machine and it was so easy. Didn't have bread flour, just used all purpose, tasted great.

These are the best cinnamon rolls ever! I made these in my kitchen aid and they turned out great.If your like me and don't like the bread machine,put all the ingredients in the mixer bowl and mix on stir setting for 2 min. then speed 2 for 10 min. Put the dough in a greased bowl and cover and let rise for 1-2 hours. Very easy. Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I love these cinnamon rolls. I have been making them for years. Like others, I do not use a bread machine; just combine the ingredients in a bowl and mix until combined, then turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic.  
They come out delicious everytime!

Loved this recipe.  As another reviewer suggested, it is very forgiving.  I didn't use an egg, I just added 2 - 3 tablespoons extra milk.  I also made it by hand as I didn't have dough hooks or a breadmaker big enough. I sprinkled yeast over the water with sugar dissolved in it, added wet ingredients to dry, kneaded for about 4 mins, let rise, rolled out etc. I used 8 oz c/cheese in the frosting and this was too much for me, so next time I will try only 3 oz. It is very easy to make, the rolls are light and fluffy.  Next time I will separate the rolls before frosting them as they had squished together in the pan.  Delicious.

I've made this recipe several times, for family and friends. They are delicious! One mistake that I made the first time I made them was using an insulated pan - the rolls on the edges were done before the ones in the middle. They were eaten anyway! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Just got these out of the oven, and these are great!! I did make some substitutions to lessen the sugar(dietary reasons)--used 1/2 pkg. sugar free vanilla pudding, 1 Tbl. Splenda sugar blend in the dough. Subbed 3/4 C. Splenda brown sugar blend w/ the cinnamon and omitted the pecans (didn't have any) for the filling. Instead of the cream cheese frosting, I used a glaze of 1 C. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. lemon juice and 3 Tbl. milk. Thanks for the great recipe!! Hopefully there's some left when the hubby gets home ;)

I've never made cinnamon rolls before so I followed the recipe exactly and the turned out great.  I did arrange them in the glass pan and refrigerated them overnight - then took them out and let them sit for about an hour before putting them in the oven the next morning.  They turned out great.  :)

i used the whole package of pudding mix, mostly because i didn't want to have it left over, but now these rolls are SOO sweet they're almost sickening. also, there's a lot of cream cheese flavour in the topping. i'd probably look for a different recipe for the top if i do these ones again. also, i don't have bread machine, so i followed the steps another reader suggested to do it by hand. I put the water, milk and butter in a saucepan and warmed it until the butter melted, then beat in the egg. Let that cool for a minute while mixing together the dry ingredients, then add the liquid to dry, knead it a little, put it in a greased bowl and let it rise for 45 min. I covered my bowl with a damp towel as well. But when i did this, i found the yeast didn't react well and still felt a litte...grainy. they baked okay though...but i'll probably just stick the old recipe....

Delicious!!! This is THE cinnamon roll recipe in our house. I don't have a bread machine, so I made a few changes: Combine water, milk, & butter- heat till butter is melted. Add egg. Meanwhile, combine dry ingredients- reserving 1/2 cup flour for kneading. Add liquids to dry ingredients. Turn onto floured surface & knead in remaining 1/2 cup flour. Put in greased bowl & let rise about 45 minutes. Then continue with recipe instructions. I get these ready the night before- stick in the fridge overnight & bake in the morning. Yumm!

If there were more stars I would give them!! This was wonderful. I made a couple of faux pas while loading the bread machine, and they still turned out wonderful!! I added the whole amount of the pudding mix, I forgot the yeast untill after has mixed awhile, and didn't put in all the flour initially. I fixed things, and they were great! I put mine in a bigger pan amd let them spread out more when rising.

Outstanding!!  And soooo easy!!  I've never used the "dough cycle" on my bread machine like this before and, wow, how awesome that feature is!! I've made these twice over the Christmas holidays already -- me, the non-bread maker... I've served these to guests both times and they were HUGE hits.  I do plan on trying another similar Allrecipes.com recipe to compare, but this one is a sure winner.  I used French Vanilla pudding mix in the second batch since that's what I had on-hand and there was no difference.  I also cooked them a shorter time (the minimum) the second time and they were better -- more moist and gooey like the Cinnabon ones.  This one will be used again and again!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

UPDATED 1/5/05:  I've made this recipe so many times!  It's still our favorite cinnamon roll recipe.  One thing I discovered this year that was VERY helpful (so that I don't have to be up at the crack of dawn to do this...) is that I did these the night before, rolled them out and all, then covered them with a towel and allowed them to sit overnight.  I popped them into the oven in the morning and they were perfect!  I made another batch in the morning (lots of company) and I couldn't tell the difference between the "fresh" batch and the one prepared the night before.  Now we can have our rolls first thing in the morning instead of around noon!  LOL

These were just plain fabulous. First time attempting cinnamon rolls, and they were so easy! I made mine up the day before and put them in the fridge before the 2nd rise, then just set them on the counter to let them warm up before baking.  I used the whole pudding packet like others did.  I also made a gooey bottom layer of dark corn syrup, brown sugar and cinnamon, then placed the rolls on top of that to bake.  With only 2 of us eating these, the recipe made way too much so next time I will make a half batch-but I will definitely make them again, thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I used 1 pkg of pudding too, also I mixed the butter,sugar,cinn,then spread on dough.
I also used 1/2sugar&1/2cup of brown, instead of 1 cup of brown, it carmelized much less on the bottom of pan. I used a maple glaze for these
3 TBS. Good maple syrup, 1cup powdered sugar, about 1 TBS Cream,(I used flavored coffee cream Intern'l Southern Pecan). You must try this recipe, I will definately be adding this to my absolute favorite list. Thanks Miss Alix!!

This were wonderful!  I was wanting to find the perfect breakfst for Christmas morning and I found it.  I used a whole box of pudding as a few others suggested and my mom and HD said they were the best they ever had.  I made them up the night before and then pulled them out in the morning and let them rise and then baked.  Wonderful!

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and they turned out wonderful. I have since made them a few times and I prefer the icing recipe from Clone of a Cinnabon a little better than this one. However, this is still the best recipe I've ever found for the dough and filling. There simply aren't enough stars for this recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. It tasted terrific. My only complaint is the amount of time listed for prep. My bread machine takes 2.5 hours to make dough (this was my first time making dough with it), then the dough has to rise for 45 additional minutes after you roll and cut it. Add in the original mixing of the ingredients, prep time took 3.5 hours vs. the approx. 2 hours stated in the recipe. What was supposed to be for breakfast, turned out to be a snack for lunch. Other than that, I highly recommend this recipe and will make many more times (I will just have to get up extra early :))

It was my first time ever making Cinnamon Rolls and they turned out ok.. They cooked in half the time so they came out just a little to dry! 
I would make them again, but watch them to see how fast they cook.  It is also a large recipie and over flowed in my bread machine! but it was still great!

Wonderful rolls!  Exactly like Cinnabon.  I put one whole package of the vanilla instant pudding.  You may also use french vanilla pudding.  For a better roll, double the frosting recipe!

This is a really great, simple recipe. I too have been a fan of the 'Clone' recipe from this site, but after the first few times making those and loving them, I can't get them to come out right anymore. I have tried a few other recipes, wanting to get a nice moist cinnamon roll (not necessarily a clone of the mall cinnamon rolls) and this recipe DELIVERED! I used the whole package of pudding mix (why try to measure out half?) Used cheesecake flavored because I didn't know I was out of vanilla, had to add a little melted butter because of the extra pudding. For the filling, I followed other reviews and creamed the softened butter, cinnamon and brown sugar (with a dash of nutmeg) with the mixer and then spread it with a spatula - having made cinnamon rolls many times before, I think this is the only way to do the filling! I baked them as suggested and pulled them right after the tops started to brown. We skipped the frosting because why add the extra fat and calories? 3 days later the last roll was still pretty darn moist (the 'Clone' buns are hard as a rock a few hours after making them). This is my new keeper recipe. Yay!

Wow! I would dare to say that these turned out ever better than the ones at the mall!  The only changes I made was that I put the whole package of vanilla pudding mix (102g), and I used all-purpose flour. I was so impressed! I expected them to be good from the ratings, but not THAT good!

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!  I do not use a bread maker, and have made the recipe with and without the pudding mix.  It turned out fantastic both ways. I don't use the full four cups, more like 3 and the 4th cup goes on the counter to roll out the dough. I also use walnuts instead of pecans.  My family demands these every Saturday.  They are great.  Thank you for sharing it!!!

These were the best cinnamon rolls I've ever made! I don't have a bread machine and I used all-purpose flour, and they still turned out wonderfully! Without a bread machine, here are the only changes I made: I added the yeast and sugar to the warm water and milk and stirred until it was dissolved, then added the rest of the ingredients and kneaded. The dough wasn't sticky, and kneaded very well in about 5 minutes. Even without the bread flour or extra gluten,it turned out great!

This is a good recipe the only thing is that I used two extra cups of warm milk and I am pretty sure that the two cups of milk was only to be used to make the instant pudding... So I used too much milk and had to add more flour to the dough. Very frustrating

I made the dough the night before the traditional way, and put it in the fridge. Next morning, I took it out to finish rising, which it did just fine. They turned out perfect! I want to eat more, but I get sick on too much sweets. Coffee and bacon just add the icing on the cake, so to speak.

Awesome does not describe these rolls!  These are the new family breakfast favorite.  I don't have a bread machine, but I just use my mixer with the dough hook and exactly follow the recipe instructions from there.  No need to tweak this recipe - sheer perfection!!

This recipe is awesome!  I made them the traditional way (no bread machine) the evening of Christmas eve and put the rolls in the refrigerator over night so they would be ready Christmas morning.  In the morning I put the pan in a warm water bath to rise while we opened presents.  They came out beautifully!  So chewy and gooey. I made a double batch and froze half of them before the second rising.  My whole family is looking forward to enjoying them again!

Followed the recipe exactly but did not use pecans and did this the old fashioned way as I do not have a bread maker.  The buns were delicious!  Can't wait to make it again for my boys.....

These were fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using the WHOLE packet of vanilla pudding instead of just half. I've got to say, vanilla pudding is not something I eat, keep in the house or have ever used in a recipe....I will make it a point to grab a couple of boxes next time I'm in the store, so that when I want to make these on a whim I have all the materials I need. EXCELLENT. 

Oh, also, let them rise for longer than 45 minutes. At the 45 minutes mark, mine were not as large as I would have liked. Closer to 1 hour 15 or so minutes...they were giant. Just like the ones in the mall! These were a knock-out HIT in my house!

If I could give this 6 stars I would. My boyfriend and teenager daughter fought over these. Only thing I was disappointed in, was the size after rising. I was hoping for the BIG rolls like at the mall. But, that is ok. My neighbor traded me a couple of them for a side of fresh salmon!!!

Very good.  I used the entire pkg of pudding as others suggested and used less pecans because my kids arent a fan.  The frosting needed a pinch of salt to balance the flavor.

AMAZING! This was the first batch of cinnamon rolls that I've made and I don't think I need to look any further for a recipe. I kept the actual cinnamon roll recipe the same but I changed the frosting. I used the Cinnabon recipe and added 2 tsp of milk to that, and honestly it may have been the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had! We will be making these often, thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I was a little unsure because of the pudding in the dough, but was pleasantly please, the dough had a great taste instead of the bread dough taste that usually comes with cinnamon rolls. I also did not want a heavy icing on it so I just drizzled it on the whole pan of rolls and it had the perfect amount of sweetness!

I have never bought any in the mall, so I can not compare them!

I have posted before that I have a day care, and I try to cook homemade for my kids(buggers I call them) feel better making good food instead of processed store bought junk! And I made a pan this afternoon and I could not believe how the kids loved them! I only had 4 left!

This will be a keeper and will pass it around so all can enjoy! Thanks for a wonderful recipe! I love this site!

Made these yesterday after reading reviews for Clone of a Cinnabon and this recipe. Dough rose beautifully in bread machine up to top of pan and almost to viewing window.  I am an experienced cook but have less experinece baking bread. Had a little trouble rolling dough evenly and it kept springing back. After reading tips elsewhere I think if I had let dough rest for a few minutes it would have rolled out easier. Tried the advise of other reviewers and mixed butter, sugar and cinnamon together and then spead. This method was too difficult to spread evenly, I will do it next time the traditional way. Great recipe, really a keeper. I would welcome any other tips from expert bread makers on rolling out the dough!

I had been looking for the perfect Cinnamon Bun recipe for my Honey. This is IT!  I makes quite a few... so I tried freezing 1/2 the rolls before they were doubled in size .. but they didn't turn out as nice as freshly baked.  Then I tried freezing just the dough and rolling out and adding the filling .. still not as successful.. I will now try fully baking all of them and then flash freeze them and take out as we need them .. I am sure that should work out fine

My first attempt at cinnamon rolls with a yeast dough was a huge success with this recipe!  I have had very little experience making yeast doughs - usually stick to the quick breads - but since it was Easter yesterday, and I wanted to do something extra-special for my family, I put my fears aside and gave it a shot.  These turned out so yummy, and everyone raved!  Not having a bread machine, I followed the instructions by Marianne (thank you, Marianne!) and it was quite easy.  Next time, I think I will try making extra and freezing for baking at a later time, as suggested by marypat.  They are really best right after baking, while they are warm and gooey with icing....but no one's complaining about the leftovers next day!  Thank you, Miss Alix!

I made these over the weekend for an Easter brunch. They were fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. They were soft and flavorful - perfect with a large cup of fresh brewed coffee. Thanks!

Made these for Easter breakfast and they were a big hit. I don't have a bread machine, so I started the yeast with the 1/4 c warm water and 1 Tbsp of sugar. I placed all dry ingredients in the mixer making a well and added all the wet ingredients. I mixed all ingredients with a dough hook until dough was sticky and pulling away from the bowl. I turned dough onto a floured surface and kneaded 2 - 3 mins. placed it into a greased bowl and let it rise for 1 hour. Then followed steps 2 - 4. This is a wonderful recipe.

I gave these 1 star for taste (very commercial & chemically - didn't taste like a yeast roll or homemade), and 2 stars for appearance and workability (the dough pulled together like a gem and the rolls came out of the oven perfectly beautiful).  I am certain it is the pudding that gives it the commercial flavor (I use Jello brand pudding and only the best products of butter, flour, etc).  If I make these again I would just add 1-2 TBS wheat gluten, a little more sugar, and some vanilla in place of pudding mix, which should give me the same beautiful rolls without the chemical flavor.  Honestly, the flavor was a big downer - reminded me of something you'd get from a gas station. Way too many calories to not enjoy it.  Sorry.

I was somewhat disappointed in my results.  Mine were a cross between buns and pastry dough rolled up.  They are still good and they will definitely get eaten but I was expecting the rolls to come out light and fluffy.  Also mine seem to expand only sideways.  Next recipe I try, I will make them wider and roll shorted strip.  Perhaps that may give me a closer result to what I am hoping for.

Excellent!!!! I accidently added the pudding to the flour mixture on top the liquids but it turned out wonderfully! I also made a bit of a sticky sauce on the bottom of the pan with butter, brown suagr & cream before placing the rolls on top. I aslo iced the rolls when still warm so the icing melted a bit into the rolls.

Save you Cinnabon money and make these at home.  My changes were as follows.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat and 3 cups of bread flour.  Added 1/2 teaspoon each cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough. Doubled the filling using 7 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.(Although I didn't use all of it) And then dotted the tops of the rolls with 2 tablespoons of butter.

By far the best cinnamon roll recipe I came across. My dad said these are the best cinnamon rolls he had ever tasted. Trust me, I have some stiff competition in the family. One time I ran out of vanilla pudding and substituted with butterscotch and added heath almond crunchy topping. It was every bit as good as the original recipe!

Easy and delicious!  Followed the recipe, but used currants instead of nuts for the filling.  Baked some the night I made the dough & then stuck the rest in the fridge for the next morning (cooked up just as well after being in the fridge all night).  Will make this again, soon.

First time making homemade rolls and these babies were so good! Followed it exactly. I wished that I had a 10x14 pan because I felt it needed more room to expand. It all worked out though but I think I will use the icing from the clone of the cinnabon recipe.

So soft and sweet!  I added raisins and omitted the nuts.  I do not have a bread maker but used my dough hooks on my mixer to mix the dough.  Also, I did not have bread flour so I added 2 tsp of baking powder.  If I make these again I may cut down on the brown sugar because the icing is so sweet and rich.

Amazing is all I can say!  I used half a package of cheesecake pudding because it was all I had and doubled the topping. They were absolutely incredible!  The bread machine raised the dough so I put the oven on 100 degrees f, left the oven door opened and let them raise again for about 15 min.  I needed two pans since I it was noted they would double in size.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were AMAZING!  I used a full package of pudding.  These freeze great too!  Take them out to thaw in the frig the day before, then the day of let rise for 1hr.  IF you do big rolls you will want to bake it longer.

This was a really good recipe.  I followed the tip from others of using the whole pudding package.  I also didn't have any pecans, so I used 2 Tbsp of cinnamon for the center; it sounds like a lot, but after they were cooked, it really made up for the flavor lost from the pecans without overpowering. I also used about 1/3-1/2 cup butter for the filling.  *A tip for the icing: I read a few complaints about the icing, and I think what it really needed was a pinch (like 1/8 tsp) of salt.  Also, the milk makes it more of a glaze than a creamy icing, so mix up the icing without the milk and add it tsp by tsp until you get the consistency you like!

OH MY GOSH!!! These were to die for! I followed the advice of Deb, and these came out fluffy and delish. It took a long time to make (which is what I wanted- stress reliever) and the flavor and texture were spot on. Thanks SOO much for the recipe, a definite keeper!

Wow, what a great recipe. They were so delicious. I don't have a bread machine, so I just made it with a little elbow grease. I proofed the yeast in the warm water & sugar until foamy (about 10mins), then added the other ingredients. But try not to use a small handheld mixer to mix. I almost had half the batter plastered on my wall. It works fine when worked through w/ a large spoon, then your hands. I turned the dough out onto a lightly floured board and kneaded for 10 mins. Then I let the dough rise for an hour in slightly oiled bowel covered by a moistened cloth. Did the rest per recipe. It was alot of fun to make. Pretty easy.

These are wonderful!  I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and they came out fine.  I usually make the "Best Cinnamon Buns" on this site but these are so much easier and they only difference I can tell are the other are cakier.  For ease, these take the cake!
I also make a sticky caramel mixture that I put on the bottom of the pan and then turn them out of the pan.  This is for sticky buns!  I do not use the frosting part when I do this. 
You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

Love this recipe. My boyfriend begs for them all the time. I use a full tablespoon of yeast and take out about 4-5 tablespoons of flour to give them a very light airy texture. EXCELLENT. I also double the cinn. brown sugar and butter mixture for the filling because we like them gooey! Excellent recipe

I made these because the recipe said they were comparable to the ones you buy at the mall.  They taste nothing like them.  The vanilla pudding made the dough really dense and the cream cheese icing tasted horrible.  My kids wouldn't even eat these.

I had high hopes for this recipe based on previous reviews.  However, I was a bit disappointed.  The rolls were definitely the prettiest I have ever made.  The dough itself is fantastic--flavorful, delicate, and easy to work with.  But other than appearance and the dough, I would make several changes.  The recipe calls for way too much cinnamon and not enough sugar.  I would NOT use a cream cheese frosting with these at all!  These rolls cannot stand up to the flavor of cream cheese.  A plain vanilla frosting would be much better suited.  Actually, the dough would make much better sticky buns or dinner rolls than cinnamon rolls.    Overall, a strange combination of flavors that just don't work together.  Stick with a more traditional recipe.

I have made this recipe at least 5 times, and it always turns out great. Frosting Tip:  I put the frosting into a baggie and snip a tiny hole in the end, then pipe it in circles (or however) onto the rolls....it seems less "goopy" that way.  yum yum.  :)

I love this recipe! It turned out perfect.  I   used less of the brown sugar/cinnamon filling than the recipe called for, but they were delicious and by far the best cinnamon roll recipe I have ever used.  I will be making these over and over again.

Absolutely delicious!!!!!!  The only thing I did differently was to add the entire box of instant pudding to the dough mix (it's not that big of a box, anyway!).  

I've made cinnamon rolls for years and years...this is, by far, the BEST recipe I've come across.  Next time I make it, I'm going to make the ice cream sauce another poster mentioned and try it that way, too.   :-)

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. They went over great with everyone i gave them to. The only thing I changed the second time I made them is I only used about 6 ounces of cream cheese for the frosting. I thought the cream cheese kind of over powered the frosting and when I didn't use as much I could enjoy the other flavors in the frosting.

This recipe was very easy and very tasty. I didn't have any instant vanilla pudding on hand, so I substituted with white chocolate pudding. It turned out great. My husband loved them. I will make again!!!Thanks for the great recipe.



I have made these cinnamon rolls several times since my first review. I have used the vanilla pudding as called for too. They always come out great and I get lots of compliments on them. I like to double the frosting though. Oh so yummy!

UPDATE!!  My husband prefers these to any others I have made.. Guess he was wrong when he originally felt these were nothing special.  Good thing to note is that you can use butterscotch pudding mix if you do not have vanilla.  Also note that it is 1/3 cup of pudding mix, in case you have bought the 6 serving size of pudding mix.  I have to agree with the other reviews, if you want a softer bun, cook only to the 15 minute mark.

Wunnerful, wunnerful!  I made these rolls to thank some neighbors for digging us out of the snowstorm (I'm in Denver).  They were very easy to make, especially using the bread machine, and absolutely delicious.  Be sure to roll them somewhat tight to keep the filling inside and then pinch end after cutting to keep them from unraveling.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I like to add a couple handfuls of raisins to the filling.  I'll make them the night before and let them rise in the fridge, covered, overnight and the next morning take them out while I preheat the oven.  I find twenty minutes baking works in my oven, but I do need to put a layer of foil over the top in the last five minutes or so to keep them from overbrowning.  I usually only put a thin layer of frosting on the rolls and serve the rest in a bowl alongside, so folks can put on extra if they want...but they're plenty sweet already!

The BEST cinnamon rolls ever.  Have made these twice now.  First time, exactly as called for.  Rolls were a little on the thick/dense side and not as gooey and sweet as the mall rolls, but fantastic!  Second time, I made mini cinnamon rolls by rolling the dough thinner to yield two batches.  I doubled the cinnamon/pecan mixture and doubled the cream cheese topping (one full portion of each for each half of the dough).  The end result was twice as many, but smaller, rolls with tons of cinnamon and pecans.  REALLY REALLY good!!

Wonderful recipe!  This makes pillow-soft dough.  I would recommend the following changes, however.  First, it will take lots more flour than recommended or the dough will be too sticky to work with.  Make sure you use a high quality bread flour.  In the midwest, Dakota Maid flour it the best.  Second, I'd add an entire box of vanilla pudding mix because it improves the flavor.  Third, although the filling makes the rolls taste like the famous version, it's way too sweet for my family.  I'd halve all the filling ingredients except the pecans.  Thanks for the terrific recipe!!

Of the many recipes of cinnamon rolls I have made in the past, these are by far the best.  I, also, used the entire pudding mix and used regular flour, in place of bread flour. Using less cream cheese in the icing is good advice, too. They turned out fabulous doing it like that.  My son called them "heaven on a plate", and that they are.

These are INCREDIBLE!  Move aside Cinnabon!  They turned out big...soft..gooey.  It made so many of them.  I plan on sending them to work with my husband one of these days.  ALOT cheaper than going to the mall.

Oh my goodness, this is the best. My college son and my senior son all agreed that this is the closest to Cinnabon you can get. Thanks so much for the recipe and will love making them again and passing them out. Would love to make and freeze them and give them out in a tin foil pan as gifts. Not sure if this could be done??

These were extremely easy and very, very delicious. We just had a big, bad snowstorm here on Long Island, so eating these on a snowy, Sunday morning was perfect. They really are much better than store-bought. And if you don't have a bread machine, make them by hand - you will not be disappointed. As another reviwer said, if you had trouble with this recipe, it must have been your house temperature or something, or maybe inexperience, but these were divine.

This was so easy for me!!!  I followed the suggestion of another review and used the whole pkg of instant pudding.  They turned out GREAT!!!  Even my husband liked them and he usually doesn't eat sweet stuff.  Personally I think they taste BETTER than Cinnabons.  This recipe should be in the hall of fame.

OH MY GOODNESS, were these good!  Rich in taste, soft yet chewy texture.  I've been making my grandmother's recipe for cinnamon rolls for 25 years, and this one I must admit is equal to hers.  (Note, I can't say better, because lightening would strike me!)

Just like Cinnabon rolls, and so easily made in the bread machine.  You really don't need the icing, because the rolls themselves are so delicious.

I have never written a review on any recipe before but had to on this one. I would give it more than five stars if I could! I followed the recipe exactly, omitting the pecans, and they were delicious!!! Several people tried them and  couldn't say enough about how yummy they were. A friend of mine has even requested I make a batch for her to take on family vacation. I will definitely be making these again and again!

This is my absolute favorite cinnamon roll recipe; the ingredient list is perfect as written. I do skip the first rise and shape the dough straight after kneeding and it's just as fantastic. If you're having problems with the middles of the rolls popping up and out during baking, you need to let the shaped rolls rise longer. Let the rolls rise until at least doubled to prevent malformation from baking.

I just made these for breakfast-dinner and they were  hit!! I followed the suggestions from ~Marianne~ (9-25-06), and they turned out great. Not heavy or dense at all!! Light texture and wonderful flavor. I just mixed powdered sugar and vanilla creamer for the icing since I was in a hurry. I'm definitely going to make these again!! My batch made around 24. The pudding mix I had was sugar free. Next time I'll use the regular stuff. Wonder if it makes a difference?

Delicious.  Very rich.  First cinnamon buns I've ever made and they were a hit!  I used raisins instead of pecans - would use again, but with fewer raisins and less topping to cut the sweetness.  Had to substitute in butterscotch pudding - didn't have vanilla; don't think it mattered.  Will definitely make again.

Not bad, pretty good, but not my favorite. The vanilla pudding gave it a cake-like texture, and somewhat off flavor. I probably won't make it again, as I like a more traditional roll with almost chewy dough.

These are the absolute best cinnamon rolls I've ever tasted. I didn't have any cream cheese in the house so I just made glaze. We could have eaten every one of them but instead I passed them to my neighbors and they loved them too. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent and easy recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I only have a couple very minor changes.  I cut them a little thicker to make a dozen rolls and I cut the frosting recipe in half which is plenty for me.  Also I put the milk in a saucepan with the butter and heat until the butter just starts to melt.  I add the water  then the milk and butter and then top off with the rest of ingredients for the dough.

My husband LOVES these. Said they were the best Cinnamon rolls he has ever had. I have made them several times now. Once I was out of vanilla so I used butterscotch pudding... still just as amazing!

I've made this recipe both in the machine and in the big mixer, and either way is good. The pudding mix adds sugar, cornstarch and makes the rolls softer and the flake finer. My family love them. Oh I used unbleached regular flour and I use a mixture of brown and white sugar, about 2 to 1 which makes the rolls have a gooey filling but also a little crunch around the edges. Thank you Miss Alix :)

These are so awesome and so easy to make! I follow the recipe exactly but use the full box of pudding, makes them super sweet. My family likes the "goop" on the bottom and for that I use: 

1 stick butter, 1 1/4 c brown sugar, 2 T water (melt butter and sugar together, dilute with water),bury rolls in mixture on bottom of pan. 

I have made these at least 20 times and the best I found is to bake for 28 min @ 335 on middle rack - but maybe that's just my oven.

I have been using this recipe for years and follow it exactly. But now I have made it a little GUILT free.  I found whole wheat BREAD flour at my local Winco Grocery store and made it exactly as measured (4 cups). It doesn't rise as much but it was AMAZING.  If you are use to eating WW items this will be a a dream come true.  I found a slightly healthy pleasure.  You won't have to mix white and wheat, just use all wheat as long as it is WW BREAD flour.

Hmmm, not sure how one can consider themselves an expert and 1) complain about the time it takes to bake any type of bread, and 2) say that tube cinnamon rolls taste the same as fresh baked. That being said these were delicious! I made them by hand and also added the whole box of pudding like others suggested. Great cinnamon roll for sure!

Fantastic! Only wanted to make 12 so scaled the recipe but added entire box of vanilla pudding and whole egg. Did not change anything else and they were so good. Used some vanilla buttercream icing I had in the fridge and it made the rolls. Thanks!

Absolutely fabulous! I was a little nervous at first because I have never made cinnamon buns before. But my goodness, this recipe is worth the work and wait.

I did use the bread maker ,dough mixing, method and I did use a complete package of cream cheese. The rest is the same.

Try it, you won't be sorry! Thank you for the recipe (^_^)

Yum. Yum. Yum.  I also put them in the fridge overnight after putting them in the greased pan.  Left them out the next morning for about 30 min on the counter before backing.

I was expecting these to be moist because of the addition of the pudding, but they weren't.  They were very dry.  I should have added more filling, and maybe I baked them too long.  I just couldn't risk having unbaked dough, so I let them go a little bit longer.  The dough, however, was some of the best dough I have made with respect to rolling it out.  It was so soft and silky, but it went downhill from there.  I think I will try another recipe next time.

I've made cinnamon rolls for years, and my family went nuts for these on Christmas morning! I'm not a big fan of cinnamon rolls, but even I like them. They're flaky, full of flavor, and worth the time and effort. Guess I'll be making THESE from now on! =)

Best bread machine recipe ever.  I used all purpose flour. The dough was a little sticky and so I just added flour as I rolle it out.  Baked lovely and tasted great.

Wow, these were so delicious!  I made for my daughter's sleepover.  They were easy to make the night before, then I popped in the fridge.   The next morning I heated water in the microwave to warm it up, then put the cold rolls in the microwave to warm up while the baking oven came up to temp.   Not sure I needed to do that step, but I did.  They baked up great and we loved them.  I will definitely make these again.

Awesome!  I tried using whole-wheat flour for half the flour to make it more healthy, but it didn't compare to the doughy-ness of the rolls when I used unbleached white bread flour.  Our family also likes ours heavy with cinnamon, so I upped it to a couple of tablespoons.

The Rolls where fabulous! It was my first time to make cinnamon rolls and I found that it was moderately difficult to roll out the dough evenly enough to divvy into equal parts but, because they taste so scrumptious the aesthetics of my bake creation didn't seem so important.

Absolutely. AMAZING.  No need to change a thing! Even my husband, who has almost no sweet tooth at all, ate them up AND took some to his ship the next day to share with his division. This has now become my go-to recipe for cinnamon rolls.

I would stress that the yeast should be dissolved in hot water first, then add other liquids; and err on the side of very warm liquids (truly room temp egg) in order to preserve the overall warm temp in prep for dough rising.

This recipe was really really good.  The store I get my cinna rolls from had a really sweet icing and the icing wasn't as sweet as I expected to be and I had to add more icing sugar.
I made 8 cinnamon rolls and they were all finished today. I was initially going to freeze 3 because I thought my family members weren't going to eat them. My mom said they were really good and my dad after he woke up from his nap asked if there were more cinnamon buns left! I love it when my family loves my cooking, it makes spending the money for the ingredients worthwhile.
Thanks for a great recipe :) !

EDIT - My mom loved these sooo much that she ordered me to make these again 2 days after I first made them. She has been raving to all her friends about how good the cinnamon rolls were! LOL she has like gone crazy for 'em :P. Thanks again for the amazing recipe :).

Followed instructions almost exactly as written, and they came out perfectly - the only difference was that I added three more minutes to the maximum cooking time.  Don't be afraid to try this one without the bread machine, it helps but isn't mandatory.  A lot of work, but definitely worth it if you're not rushed.

These weren't horrible, but very tough. They didn't taste good the next day and I ended up throwing up the leftovers. I'm still looking for a good recipie

These buns are AWSOME!!! I made a double batch to take to camp for the weekend and everyone thought they where scrumptious. My son-in-law told my daughter she should definitely get the recipe for them....I will most certainly make them again.

Made these for Easter dinner--what a hit!! So good!! I do not have a bread machine so I used my kitchen aid mixer and just let them rise right in the bowl. It worked great! Fabulous!!

Excellent cinnamon rolls. The only change I made was to use Baileys French Vanilla coffee cream in place of the milk in the icing- best icing ever!

Uber-yummy.  These were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made....or eaten!  Beware, though, as they are highly addictive.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added some cinnamon to the flour and used part whole wheat and part all purpose (not quite half and half) along with some vital wheat gluten, as I don't keep bread flour on hand.  I also decreased the amount of butter in the dough by about half.  I did not use the frosting recipe, though I will next time...I just happened to have some left over frosting to use up.  This made about a pan and a half for me....12 in the 9x13 and another 5.  Awesome!  My new cinnamon roll recipe "fer sher".

These are the best cinnamon rolls!! I used the whole package of instant pudding mix, added a couple more tsp of cinnamon, and decreased the amount of pecans to 1/3 cup since we don't care for them as much. It took about 25 minutes to bake in my oven. They turned out great! The frosting was delicious as well.

OH MY WORD! Can I give these 10 stars? These are by far the BEST cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I added a little less than 3/4 cups pecans though, I'm not a huge nut person. Other than that, I made exactly as written. I've made them twice and I just found the recipe a week ago. :)

I've never had too much success with cinnamon rolls until today! I made these and they were wonderful. I used candied pecans and I added raisins too! This is my new cinnamon bun recipe. For the record...I only had rapid-rise yeast and it worked fine. I delivered some to my neighbor's family....otherwise my husband and I would have eaten too many! Thanks for the recipe.

Love this recipe. I didn't have bread Flour so if you If you want to make your own add 1 teaspoons (7.5 grams) baking powder and 0.738  teaspoon /3.5 grams salt per cup (140 grams) of all-purpose flour.  I wasn't sure about the instuctions on this recipe. It didn't specifie weather to let the dough rise in the bread maker or take it out on the first beep and start working with it. So I let it rise for an hour, Well it didn't rise, so I rolled it out anyway and cut it and let it rise for 30 min in a warm oven, STILL DIDN'T RISE. I was worried. Once it baked it finally did rise and baked beautifully. I did double the filling, I only added half or so to the inside of the cinnamon roll and then I put the rest of it on top of the cinnamon rolls and baked it. The cream cheese icing is Fantastic, It made the rolls. I used chopped walnuts and everything turned out great. These rolls, even though it took a long time to make, was worth the wait.

Love this recipe. Great flavor and easy to make using my bread machine. I did make 1 1/2 batches of the filling recipe because I felt it needed more. Thank you for the great recipe.

Just wondering what kind of yeast everyone is using in this recipe. Regular? Quick Rise? Yeast for bread machines?  What do you suggest?
Ok...I used one packet of regular yeast.  This recipe is perfect.  I also tried "Clone of a Cinnabon" and prefer this one.

These are very good cinnamon buns, which I made for a brunch  my husband and I hosted for my parents on Mother's Day. The recipe was easy to make, and the resulting buns were tasty. I have made the 'Clone of a Cinnabon' recipe (also on this site) a few times, and think the latter are just a tad better (and you don't need the pudding mix). That being said, both have won rave reviews from tasters!

Absolutely the best!  These rolls have a very tender, pillowy crumb and a delicate crust.  I've made these at least 6 times in the past year and always attained the best results.

These were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had!  I used half whole wheat flour, the whole package of pudding, and doubled the filling mixture.  Adding whole wheat flour really adds more flavor.  My coworkers loved them!

These were AWESOME! I put these together the night before, and they took a couple hours once I took them out of the fridge to rise. Well worth the time and effort these are the best!

It is my new Cinnamon Roll recipe! I only had all purpose flour, but it worked fine.  Using the bread machine for the dough was a great timesaver. And all the compliments on them was nice to hear too! Thanks Miss Alix!

Wow this recipe is the best cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried!!  I used raisins instead of pecans and it was delicious.  My husband is VERY picky and he wants me to make these every weekend.  A+++++++++

Five stars for the cinnamon rolls themselves--these are the real deal(I use a different icing recipe, however--the texture of this one is all wrong). They're not difficult to make (although they're a little time consuming) and they do taste just like the ones you buy in the mall.  Following other reviewers' advice, I've made these up to the 2nd rise, then placed them in the refrigerator overnight, then allowed them to rise and baked them the next morning. Time consuming, but worth the effort. These are always a hit whenever I make them. Thanks!

These are the BEST cinnamon rolls i have ever tasted.  I even made the 'cinnabon clone'  and enjoyed these much more.  The only change i made was adding a whole package of pudding mix.

Great recipe.  You can use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3 cups all purpose flour for a slightly healthy version.  Tastes just as good.  I also made a butter whip for the filling - 3/4 cup softened butter, 1 cup brown sugar and cinnamon, whipped together and then spread on the rolled out dough.
Turns out gooey and great each time.

I followed the recipe exactly, but these were WAY too sweet. These were also more cake-like than a traditional cinnamon roll. I think I will pass on trying these again.

This does taste just like the mall cinnamon rolls.  Don't double the frosting recipe.  1 recipe of frosting is perfect.  If you double it then it becomes too rich.  I needed to bake mine longer because they were still doughy and uncooked in the center.

Oh my.  I've been making cinnamon rolls since I was a new bride 30 years ago and I thought I tried every recipe combination there was. 
 But today I made these for a sick friend and they are the best. They're moist and unlike most recipes, they don't have an over abundance of dough.  Since it was my first time of making this recipe, I followed it exactly as written--except I didn't use a bread machine.

This is well worth the effort.

This recipe is outstanding!  I follow it with all the ingredients as written.  I have made them with the overnight directions provided in an earlier review, as well as the morning of way as is directed in the original recipe - both ways are a total hit!  If I could give this more stars, I would - they are really THAT good as so worth the effort!!  The only thing I do differently is to cut the rolled dough into 15 pieces because it fits better in a 9x13 pan to do three rows of five.

What I really like about these besides the great taste is that you only have to let them rise once.  Just stick them into an oven that you have pre-heated to 200 degrees and have turned off. 
My husband just told me again how much he liked them.

This is a great recipe! Very easy to make in a bread machine. I used a whole box of pudding mix as recommended by others. I think without doing that it would have been fine as well. They didn't last long at my house and by the next day I was getting requests to make it again! A true keeper!

My family can gobble these up quick as I can dish em out! I have made this several times now, and have always used the full package of pudding, usually use French vanilla, but do try butterscotch pudding for a change, very nice! After my second make of these I took another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon mixture, the results are DELISH!! UPDATE: I now double the recipe and since we have different tastes for icing, I set out bowls of cream cheese, orange, and maple icing. We can spread our favorite icing on the warm rolls. When doubled I use two boxes of pudding mix.

Okay, I've been a bread making fool for years and they always turn out perfect, but for some reason I couldn't bake a good pan of cinnamon rolls to save my life!!!!  I finally got online and looked for a recipe with a five star rating to try.  After reading all the reviews, I was convinced this was the "right one" for me.  I stayed up past midnight determined to make them and boy oh boy was I glad I did!!!!  FINALLY - CINNAMON ROLL SUCCESS!!!!!  They were delicious!!!  They did take a little longer than 45 minutes to rise, but they were definitely worth the wait.  After reading the reviews, I also used the entire box of pudding and added a tad more milk and I only used a 3oz. pkg. cream cheese and added a little more milk to the icing because it was a little too thick.  Thanks for such a fantastic recipe!!!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was very easy with the bread machine, and the dough rolled out very easy too. My cut rolls took 2 hours to rise, instead of 45 minutes,though. The recipe didn't say to cover: so I didn't for the first hour, but decided to for the second hour. I set in a warm spot on my ceramic stove-top. ?? Using the 9x13, the rolls in the middle weren't done but they were getting dark brown on top. Next time (Oh yeah.. there will be a next time!) I will make (2)8x8's, instead. Also,none of my family liked the cream cheese frosting (and I used a little less cream cheese, as other reviews said) so I will look for another frosting recipe. The rolls that were done, were definitrly 5 star delicious though.

Another interesting aside to this recipe is that the cinnamon that leaks out all over the pan, carmelizes beautifully. You can then neatly lift with a spatula, break into pieces and service as either little cinnamon toffees, or as ice cream topping. Very good!

This is the best recipe i have found for cinnamon buns. I made a few alterations though.. used 3/4 pkg of vanilla pudding, omitted the nuts, and made an extra 1/2 recipe of the filling(to make them extra gooey!) They came out moist, fluffy and delicious. A big hit!

Love it! These were moist and yummy. Just be sure to read the directions for the icing. It calls for 1/2 of a 8 oz package of cream cheese... not the whole thing. I think that's why other readers had bad luck with it. 

The only thing I really have to add is that if you're making the dough my hand, and not in a bread machine, but sure to allow plenty of time for the dough to rise.  I made 3 batches and I didn't let the 1st two rise long enough.  The 3rd pan did and they were AWESOME!

I am addicted to these!  Each batch I make gets better.  And they are very close to Cinnabon.  Plus, they are sooo easy with a bread making machine.  One thing: I didn't like the cream cheese taste of the frosting so I reduced the amount of cream cheese by half and added 1-2 tsp. of lemon juice plus a little more powdered sugar.  Both the frosting recipe and the dough are very forgiving - no need for perfection.  My family and I highly recommend these.

I'm glad that I found this recipe, very easy to follow and rolls turned out moist & tasty.  I do't have a bread machine so made by hand; mixed all wet & dry ingredients separately and added wet into dry.  Kneaded for 20 min, let rise for 2 hours.  Found out don't have any ground cinnamon and I used instant coffee(3 tsp) + 1 tsp of mike power instead of 4 cinnamon.  Rolls turned out light, fluffy and with a wonderful coffee taste.  I will try to make a real cinnamon rolls next time but extremely happy with those coffee rolls this time.  Thanks a lot for sharing the recipe!!!

These were incredible and SO easy!  I also put in the entire box of pudding and doubled the butter I spread on the dough.  I made two different batches, one cooking for 20 minutes and one for 15 minutes--I definitely liked the softer texture from only 15 minutes.  I'm making them again tonight for my husband's office, after rave reviews!

I've got RAVE reviews from everyone that sampled these rolls. My husband loves them, and so do my kids. I really like the idea of using the brown sugar with the Cinnamon. They're the right amount of gooey - not too much and not too little.

I give the recipe straight four stars. They're just a tiny bit too dry and it calls for too little cinnamon filling.
I suggest adding a touch more milk to the dough and at least doubling the call-for amount of brown sugar and cinnamon- they taste almost exactly like Cinnabuns! The frosting is the best I've ever had.

Exceptional. One word to describe these. I let them rise for an hour until they doubled, but didn't want to bake them all at the same time. I took a few off and baked them and they were perfect. I refidgerated the rest until I was ready to bake, let them sit out for a bit, then baked. Still tasted great, but better if you bake them at the same time. This'll be the only recipe I'll use for cinnamon rolls.

Wow, so soft and delicious. Not too sweet. LOVE IT. I used the entire box of vanilla pudding.  Increase the  butter for filling to 1/2 cup and spread on the dough then sprinkle on the sugar and cinnamon mixture on top. Bake at 325 for 20 minutes. Maybe next time I will add a few drops of orange flavor to the frosting to give it a nice taste.

Someone I know used to work at the cinnamon roll place at the mall, and they add a drop of lemon extract to the frosting as well. Try it, it will taste even more authentic!

"....The best recipe ever."  My son exclaimed as he bit into one of these things.  He and my husband ate them all within a few hours.  I'll have to make these only for special occasions because otherwise I fear for everyone's figures.

These are amazing, I made them in my stand mixer.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I made these for Easter breakfast and they were finished off in a hurry.  I do not have a bread machine so I dissolved the yeast in warm water with sugar then added the rest of the ingredients.  I also used the whole box of pudding mix.  They turned out wonderful.  I will make these many more times!!!

I wish, I could give it more stars, they are so easy to make.I made some changes like, 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg, splenda instead of regular sugar, margarine instead of butter, fat free instant pudding, light cream cheese and reduced some of the other sugars. Even with all those changes they were picture perfect and soft, yummy, just like the ones in the mall. I put in the freezer half of them to bake Sunday morning. You should give it a try. I used the bread machine in the dough setting. I even took pictures and send it to my sisters to show off!!

I used the basic recipe then changed these to sticky cinnamon rolls.  This is the best basic recipe that I have found and I will stick (no pun intended) with this one now!  I rolled it out, brushed butter over the dough, sprinkled brown sugar & cinnamon. rolled them up, dipped them in melted butter & brown sugar then pour the remaining butter & brown sugar over the top. (total 1/2 c butter $ 1/2 cup brown sugar melted together) Raised and baked.  Awesome!

Just made these & there were wonderful.  We are not big sweet eaters so I left out the frosting & pecans, topped warm rolls with butter & it was a perfect treat.  I prepared the cinnamon rolls as directed but put the uncooked rolls in the fridge last night.  Let them sit at room temp. this morning for 30 minutes then baked as directed.  They turned out great.  This will forever be my recipe for cinnamon rolls.

These turned out wonderful!! I used my KitchenAid instead of my bread machine, and omitted the nuts. They had just the right amount of sweetness making them as written: using only half the pudding mix and one recipe of frosting. Prepared them the night before and the next morning after letting them sit out for about 45 mins baked @ 325 for 22 mins.

This dough is fabulous!  I did add the entire package of pudding mis as other reviewers suggested.  After slicing into rolls, I let them rise for the 45 minutes and then put them in the refridgerator to bake the next morning.  When I pulled them out to bake they had risen A LOT more. . . which made them even better.  After 15 minutes of baking, the tops were begining to brown so I took them out of the oven.  The bottoms of the rolls were still a little too doughy for me (but I think it's because the oven rack was too high.)  My husband has requested that I make them again and again. . . which I will. . .but I'll bake them closer to the bottom of the oven.  Thanks for a recipe that gets rave reviews for a beginning baker!

Oh my gosh!  You have got to try this recipe!  This is the first time I have ever made cinnamon rolls and I can't believe how good these are.  I want everyone to try these!  You will love them.  I think that these are better than cinnabon cinnamon rolls.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!:)

These were a really yummy treat but don't try to put all 16 into one 9x 13 pan...I made 15 in one pan.....too crowded! I used raisins instead of pecans and found there was an aweful lot of icing.....still, they were wonderful and froze well individually wrapped for lunches.

Great recipe. I used a simple butter/vannila/powdered sugar frosting, and ommitted the rise after they're all rolled up -came out wonderful! Soft and gooey, I'll be sure to keep making this!

Oh my, these were REALLY good!  The only thing I did differently was use the whole box of instant pudding and leave out the pecans (due to a nut allergy in the family).  The dough was really good and the filling was yummy, too.  I may use just a little more butter next time to make it more gooey.  (If you watch at Cinnabon, they use half a pound!)  I did use the frosting from the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe on this site as suggested by a bunch of reviewers and because it didn't have as high of a cream cheese concentration.  Mmm... good!  My husband liked these but said he'd only give them four stars.  I agree that they aren't quite Cinnabon, but they are still excellent and pretty close so five stars from me!  I also gave four rolls to a friend for her and her husband - she ate them all and he got none, so I guess that speaks for itself!  Just a note, if you cut them into 15 instead of 16, they fit better in the pan (3x5).  Also, butter the pan well, this keeps the outside edges from drying out.  Finally, I used quick rise yeast and it worked fine.  Enjoy!

All I can say is "YUMMMMM". They do take a while to make, but this was my first ever made from scratch cinnamon roll recipe. Not too hard for a beginner! They do taste just like the cinnabon rolls in the stores, and I ran several over to my neighbors when they were done, and they raved!

This was an amazingly good recipe. I've never had great success making cinnamon rolls - until now. The usual problems - not gooey enough inside, too carmelized in pan, bread too course - were NOT issues at all. These were rated as far superior to Cinnabons at our house. I did use the icing from the "clone of a Cinnabon" recipe as someone else suggested. Excellent!

These cinnamon rolls are fabulous!!!!  I used regular flour since I was out of bread flour.  I also used a full box of pudding as indicated by others on this board.  Adding raisins after the dough has mixed is an excellent addition.  I look forward to making them again and again.  Thanks a million for this recipe!!!!!  I rate you a 10+!  Oh yeah,,, they are better than Cinnabuns  :)

I have made these 3 times now and every time they have been luscious. Everyone RAVES about them. I follow the recipe exactly except use cinnabon clone frosting recipe from this site. I thought I made pretty good cinnamon rolls, but never got the oohs and ahs like I do when I make these.

Delicious!  I used the whole box of pudding as suggested by others and the rolls were so moist!  If you like your roll with a lot of frosting on top, then double the recipe for the frosting.  I did and my family loved it!  Thanks Miss Alix!

Everybody LOVED these cinnamon rolls.  They were incredible.  Took them to my staff meeting and they were devoured.  My husband thought they were the best thing I've ever made!!!  The only change I made was to use the topping for the rolls from "Clone of a Cinnabon".  That made these rolls just superb.  Thanks Miss Alix...

My family absoulutely loves this recipe.  I will not use any other.  I do use dark brown sugar.  It makes the center a little more gooey (YUM!)I make this all the time for my church and they are always devoured.  AT our bake sales one pan will sell for $20 or more.  They are always a hit at pie auctions even though they are not a pie.

Very good.  Very easy with bread machine.  Rolls were light and delicious.  I also make them into sticks and those go even quicker.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I did different was to add a stick and a half of butter for the filling. I also mixed the brown sugar and cinnamon together into the softened butter with a hand mixer. I thought these were too yeasty when I test tasted one while still hot, but when I had one in the morning, the overly yeast taste was gone and it was soooo gooood!! They heat up well in the microwave too! Just zap those bad boys for about 20 seconds and they are perfect! Oh, and this was the second time I have attempted cinnamon rolls since culinary school and these are even better than the recipe the school had taught me!

Lovely dough -- sticky in the beginning but keep working with it.  It ends up being light and raises so well.  The pudding mix gives it a little different taste - however I did add the whole package as some others had suggested.  Next time I think I'll just add half as original recipe states.  As soon as I shaped and sliced them into rolls,   I put 6 of the rolls into a round cake pan and popped in the fridge for a quick bake in the morning.  The remaining were laid onto a cookie sheet, covered with pam sprayed plastic and placed in the freezer.  Once they were firm, I put them in a freezer bag, separated by wax paper.  Will make a great treat for another day!

I am not experienced with making rolls or bread and found this recipe easy.  I used the dough hook on the Kitchen-Aide mixer and followed the instructions per the mixer for making dough.  The cinnamon rolls were delicious and comparable to the mall brand.  My family enjoyed them on Christmas morning.  It will be a family tradition.

I am so frustrated with this recipe and I need some help. I have made this several times. The first time was perfection. Anytime after that, not so much. The top of the rolls cook while the bottom of the rolls remain doughy and soggy. I've tried different size pans, reducing the butter in the filling, nothing works. Please help. This really is a great recipe.

The best cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted in my entire life...so good that I  get compliments every time I make these.  

Suggestion,  the dough can get really tough and thick after you bake it...make sure you roll the dough as flat as you can before you add the sugar mixture on top and once it is baked you have a perfect consistently of sugar and cinnamon mixture and dough.

Made these for Easter Brunch and they were a big hit.  I don't have a bread machine anymore, so I read some of the reviews that mentioned using their KitchenAid mixers, and it worked perfectly.  Made the dough, let it rise and rolled/cut the buns last night, covered the pan with foil and put it in the fridge overnight.  Took it out before church this morning, baked them about 2 hours later when we got home.  I did have to bake them for closer to 30 minutes to get them golden brown.

Made these for Easter brunch.  Based on 2 pans (GONE as quick as the Easter Bunny) of these rolls, and the amount of requests for this recipe, I'm giving it 5 stars!  I used my Kitchenaid mixer.  Worked great! Love the cream cheese topping.  These were VERY well received.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These weren't as good as I expected with the high reviews. I've made cinnamon rolls before but was curious about this recipe since it has pudding mix added to the dough. I made the recipe as written- no changes. When I took the first bite, I was met with disappointment. Something was lacking and when my husband exclaimed that he liked them because they tasted like cheese danishes, I knew I was right. The cream cheese frosting is the overpowering flavor. But, these are supposed to be be cinnamon rolls, so maybe adding more cinnamon and/or cinnamon sugar mixture would fix that. I will probably give it one more try and add extra cinnamon filling since I have half a packet of pudding to use up. But, after that, I'll stick to pudding free recipes.

These cinnamon rolls were fantastic. I love cinnamon rolls, and these were the best that I can remember ever having. They were really dense, and I personally liked that. The frosting was great, but even I'll admit that they have a bit too much cream cheese. I would suggest adding more powdered sugar and reducing the amount of cream cheese. Other than that, it was fantastic.

I have made these a few times for potluck breakfasts at work. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, while they were good they were not amazing. So I changed it up a bit. When I did, everyone said the entire cinnamon roll tasted like the middle of a cinnamon roll. They said how amazingly yummy they were and now I have to make them every time we have a potluck! LOL

Dough
2 cups bread flour
2 cups all-purpose flour

When spreading the butter on the dough for the sugar mixture, I used the butter sparely, not anywhere close to 1/2 cup of butter. I did however, grease the pan with butter instead of a non-stick spray. Makes all the difference.

Icing
I used 1/8 cup of butter instead of 1/4 cup. It didn't taste as good with so much butter.

I let the rolls rise in the pan like suggested but did it over night and put a cover on the pan. They expanded to fill every space... so yummy!

This is my first time to review, but I wanted to add the same sentiments the majority of the reviewers have given...I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! The only thing I did different was to add the whole box of pudding...I thought if half was good the whole should be better!  My first cinnamon rolls and there is NO need for me to try any other!  I have made them the traditional way and with the breadmaker and they come out perfect every time!!   I am not sure how anyone can give these a negative review, but I am aware we all like different things.  Thanks so much Miss Alix for sharing this amazing recipe.

The bread flour is to heavy and dense and the bread machine is not appropriate to use in this recipe, using bread machine will over mixed the dough and the finish product will turn hard when it get cold. I'd tried it twice using bread machine and the result is the same. Sorry.

PERFECT!  I made these rolls two days before Christmas morning and refrigerated until baking.  They turned out perfect and with the bread machine, SO EASY!  I took leftovers to work the day after Christmas and everyone said they were the best they had ever had.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It's a new family favorite!

These were the perfect cinnamon rolls that I have been looking for. I used all of the pudding as suggested by another reviewer and they were WONDERFUL. I did leave out the nuts as my grandchildren do not care for nuts but I think next time I may use raisins instead.  Loved the frosting, but it made just a tad too much so plan to use less on rolls next time, and there WILL be a next time. Thanks for this wonderful post.

I prepare recipe up to baking part the night before. I place the rolls/pan loosely covered into fridge the night before (they do rise a bit). In the morning, set out to "warm" up to room temp and bake. Yum!

WOW! I've be been using this site for recipes for a few years now, and never really comment on recipes... but this was amazing. Definitely the best thing I've ever made before. I also used the entire packet of instant pudding, but didn't make any other changes. I let them raise about 45 minutes, and took them out after 15. I was worried they weren't done but they were perfectly soft and stretchy and wonderful.

These were good, but not great. They took a really long time, even when using the bread maker.  Sorry, it just took way too much time to go through the dough cycle, rise, and then rise again after slicing and before baking. If I really want homemade, maybe I'll try making the night before as some others suggested, but the cinnamon rolls in a tube are SO much faster, and taste about the same.

These cinnamon rolls were absolutely AMAZING. Easy to make (I used my bread maker for the dough), and the cream cheese topping is perfect. Tasted like they were straight from the bakery. This was my first time every making cinnamon rolls and I was pleasantly surprised. Thanks Miss Alex!

I just tried these this weekend.  I had to make a few tweaks based on limited supplies in my kitchen, so I cut the recipe in half and used frozen white bread dough, but it was still a huge hit.  Delicious!

I've never made cinnamon rolls before, but I made this recipe tonight. It was a very simple and fun recipe and they turned out SOO good. I will absolutely make this recipe again. My picky 4-year old loves them too.   I chose to use the entire box of pudding and I did and extra half portion of the cinnamon/brown sugar filling. Mouth watering!

I did not find the flavor of the dough to be as good as other cinnamon rolls I made.  I tend to think the Pudding Mixture being added is what turned me off.

These are easy to make with a bread maker and delicious, too.  BUT, the icing is WAY to sweet for my family.  I think next time I make them, it will be a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze.  I would rather taste the cinnamon roll than the frosting!

These are FANTASTIC!! I had a 1.85oz package of vanilla pudding mix (so I put the whole box in) I left out the pecans (I didn't want them in my cinnamon rolls), and I cooked mine about 20 to 25 minutes, but other than that I followed this recipe to the T. They came out perfect, and the topping is so good too. It was nice to be able to use my bread machine (that usually collects dust). I will definitely be making these again, my family LOVED them, said they are better than the ones you get at the mall. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I'm giving 4 stars because of the easiness of the recipe and the taste of the rolls were really good.  The only issue I had was that after I cut the rolls I put them in the fridge overnight to be baked xmas morning.  I pulled them out and let rise for about an hour but they didn't double in size.  I actually waitied a little longer thinking that would work but then they overproofed.   And when I baked them  they did not have the big fluffy appearance and consitency that I was expecting.  But this is probably not an issue with the recipe I must have made a mistake somewhere along the way.  Will definately try again and cut the rolls thicker and see if I have a different result.  Adding a full package of the vanilla pudding to the dough mixture is key, it gave the bread a wonderful vanilla flavor and was really easy.  Also added a little more powder sugar to the icing recipe.

Cinnabons are good, but I like these better!  I used my bread machine on dough setting for the first time.  The dough was EASY to work with, light and fluffy when baked.  I will add a bit more cinnamon next time, that's what WE like!  Also, next time, I'll only use half the box of pudding, as the recipe stated.  I've made lots of cinnamon roll recipes, and none have turned out like these did!  Thanks for this recipe!

My daughter & I tried this recipe.. we added 1 box of  instant vanilla puding, 1/2 cup butter in the  batter & 2 tbs of cinnamon filling used the clone icing recipe. We brushed a little more butter on the rolls & baked.  Awesome easy to make my family enjoyed it & they requested the cinnamon Rolls for breakfast on Christmas day.

I have made this recipe now three times. Co-workers and the boyfriend couldn't say enough good things about them. My boyfriend ate three of them the first time he try them. I am wondering how they would do if I froze them. My neighbor let me borrow her bread maker to make them. I believe I am getting a bread maker for Christmas. Thanks for sharing!

Tried the dough multiple times and with brand new, fresh yeast.  The dough never rose enough.  Liked the taste but ended up chewy both times and not as they should have been.

I made these for Easter brunch and they were very good!  I halved the recipe since it is just the two of us and it still made about 14 rolls. I used my bread machine for the dough, assembled them the day before, refridgerated them overnight and took them out a few hours before baking; they turned out beautifully. The dough is so tender and fluffy. I skipped the cream cheese frosting part and instead served butter for the hot rolls. Yummy!  A keeper!

Exactly what my husband and I have been looking for.  This recipe is perfect as is and what a delight.  Not having a bread machine I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer.  Easy peasy with beautiful dough.  Yahoo, thanks Miss Alix.  LemongrassSandia

Cinnamon rolls were fantastic!! i cant really say much about the frosting because i read the ingredients wrong and used a all 8 oz of cream cheese in stead of 4 oz. . so they were very cream cheesey... but other wise fantastic rolls.

WOW are these fantastic! The dough got huge over sides and to top window of machine, but boy did they turn out wonderfully. Perfect taste and texture, not overly sweet. So glad to have found this recipe. Now making a second time in as many days, per request from the family.

My kids are a HUGE fan of these. They turned out great. We put the dough in the fridge before we baked them. The cooking time is longer. It probably took us about 30 minutes before they were baked through, but they were worth the wait! YUM!

These are wonderful and very easy to make.  I made these a week before Christmas and put them in the freezer.  Christmas Eve, I took them out to thaw, and they were ready to pop in the oven the next morning.  My family luuurved these!  I am getting ready to make some more today.  I think we like the taste of these better than Cinnabon's rolls.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are excellent! I was afraid to try cinnamon rolls because I thought they would be too complicated to make, but the bread machine did the hard work for me and they were really very easy. My family loves them. We will definitly be having these again.

YUM!  I made these Christmas Eve and put them in the refrigerator overnight.  I put 8 in each 9x13 pan.  I put one pan in the cold oven as it preheated...leaving it in for about 30 minutes.  The other batch went right into the hot oven and were done in about 25 minutes.  Both turned out wonderful!

I rated this a 4 because I found what in my opinion is a big improvement, otherwise it would be a five. I had bought some orange extract that I had never used and decided to substitute it for the vanilla extract. WOW was it good. I won first price with the orange version at a bake sale. The orange goes surprisingly well with the cinnamon and cream cheese. I used one teaspoon of orange extract for the recipe shown and left out the vanilla.

OMG... these cinnamon rolls are amazing!  I have been looking for a more cake like roll then a bread like roll and this is it! All the other recipes I have tried yielded a denser bread like consistency. I used the entire box of vanilla pudding mix and only mixed the dough enough to form a ball then let it rise for about 1 1/2 hours before rolling the dough out, and filling with the cinnamon mixture. After cutting into pieces I let them rise another 1 1/2 hours in the pans before baking. My oven runs hot so I set the temp to 340 degrees and baked for only 14 minutes and they turned out perfectly.

Soooo good!  I didn't make with a bread machine, I kneaded by hand.  I also don't like nuts in my cinnamon rolls, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I baked for 17 minutes and the insides were a little bit doughy (although some people mentioned that they liked them doughy).  Next time I will try baking for 18 minutes and see what happens

Excellant cinnamon rolls, I used the Saigon Cinnamon it has a far superior taste than the regular cinnamon.

My boyfriend and I tried this about 2 weeks ago and it was wonderful and it tasted even better the next day but just put in the microwave for about 30 seconds. And I don't like Cinnamon rolls because I find it too sweet but this was just perfect. I didn't have any cream cheese so we just did a regular  white glaze and drizzled it on top. I think ate like 2 od them and had to give away the rest or else I would have eaten all. DELICIOUS !

followed exactly except used the whole box of pudding mix. Also used 2/3 cup white sugar & 1/3 cup brown for filling. Used clone of a cinnabon frosting.  AMAZING!!

I thought these were very good. I think I will experiment with a different type of icing. Possibly one that is more of a glaze. The cream cheese icing was good, but a little too rich for my taste.

Just finished baking a batch of these rolls and it is very good.  I think they taste better than "that place" we all see in the mall.  Definitely a keeper and will make again.

This is an awesome recipe.  We've made it a couple of times now!  I do not have a bread machine and made the dough in my kitchen aid mixer and it turned out fine.  We doubled the filling...a bit much. 1 1/2 times would be fine.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used the entire package of pudding mix.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!

I made these Cinnamon Rolls for my little siblings before school this morning and they devoured them all. One of my sisters made the comment that they tasted a whole lot like the Cinnabun cinnamon rolls. I didn't have a bread machine so I followed ~Marianne's~ traditional method. A few changes that I made was that I used sugar free vanilla pudding (the dough still tasted delicious), I also used reduce fat cream cheese for the frosting and I omitted the pecans for the cinnamon roll filling since my sisters hate nuts. Instead I used 1/2 cup margarinne and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar for the filling. I also added about 2 tsp of vanilla into my dough and filling. I also followed MsTish's recipe for her caramel sauce that she included in her review. The sauce itself was delicious and it did indeed make the rolls extra gooey but it was just a little too sweet for me. I think that if I make these cinnamon rolls in the future that I'll omit the sauce. Great recipe though MsTish!

Made by hand (took about 2 hours)...only change was adding 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the frosting as it was not quite thick enough. Totally amazing taste- rich and wonderful.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Super Delicious! I used all purpose flour and banana pudding mix (that's all I had) and it still turned out great! I didn't put any nuts because my son doesn't like them. Next time I will use the pecans! I had leftover cream cheese frosting and used that on the rolls after I pulled them out of the oven. Worth the time! Tastes great. I'll be making more this weekend to share. Just excellent!!!

These are a favorite of my friends and family. Wonderful, gooey cinnamon rolls. I sometimes add raisins in the filling. Otherwise, leave them just as they are!

These are great! I used almonds instead of pecans and almond extract instead of vanilla. I recommend cooking for the full 20 minutes- they were still a little gooey after 15.

These cinnamon rolls were just ok. They were easy enough to make and I followed the recipe exactly, but just fine' wouldn't get 5 stars from me. There are a lot of other recipes I'll try to find THE ONE.

These were just OK.  They were good; however, I was expecting them to really wow me and was quite disappointed when they didn't.  I will say the dough was easy to work with and the filling was plenty, although I did add extra cinnamon as suggested by other reviews.

they were so delicious and they raised up to make good sized rolls. All I did was add the 'cook and serve' vanilla pudding because I didn't have the quick serve. It still tastes good to me!

This was my first attempt at making anything with yeast and all I can is WOW. I don't have a bread machine so the whole process took about three to three and a half hours. I am only cooking for my husband and I so I cooked four rolls at a time freezing the remaining. Some things to note, it took about 20 min at 400 with the frozen rolls, also as someone mentioned earlier using dental floss really makes cutting easy, and lastly doubling the cinnamon filling would really give it the a Cinnabon effect.

Fantastic cinnamon flavor and very easy to prepare.  I did not make them in a bread machine and they still came out delish!  I made them the night before and put them in the fridge after I rolled them out.  About 2 hours before I wanted to serve them, I took them out and let them rise (double in size).  Baked them as directed and they came out great!

My husband has a Granny that makes LEGENDARY cinnamon rolls, for years they have been the BEST.   Well move over granny, THESE are the best now!! (so says my husband, lol) Thanks Miss Alix!  And thank God for bread machines!! I did use a different frosting, posted by someone else on here. It was 1 stick butter, 1 egg yolk, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tbs vanilla, and a little milk if too thick. (I didnt need the milk) Awesome. (I also put 1/4 cup melted butter and brown sugar on the bottom of the dish before the rolls.)

I made a sugar-free version of these for my husband. I used sugar-free instant pudding in place of regular. Where white or brown sugar was called for, I used Splenda granulated or brown. To my surprise, the sugar-free version turned out excellent! Will make again.

Amazing recipe, and so simple! Dough was so easy to work with. I used 2 tsp of bread machine yeast, and the dough expanded a lot, so I ended up getting about 20 rolls out of it. I could probably get away with 1-1/2 next time. I just used a simple icing b/c my husband doesn't like cream cheese (unfortunately). Will definately make this again!

This cinnamon roll recipe is great! I do not use the recipe for the icing, but use a caramel icing recipe instead. That makes these the best cinnamon rolls ever! Has become my family's favorite.

This was the first time I ever tried making cinnamon rolls and these turned out perfectly. I also used the recipe for the caramel mixture provided by Ms. Tish - only I did add an extra 1/8 tsp of vanilla extract to the mixture for slightly more flavor. My family LOVED them. They give Cinnabon a run for its money!

Oh Wow!! These are the Best!! I didn't have a bread maker and they still turned out fantastic! I didn't have any vanilla pudding on hand so I used cheese cake flavor and wow! yummy. Also I mixed 1/2 tsp vanilla into butter for spreading on dough..fantastic flavor! Make these!!!!

Best homemade cinnamon rolls out there!  I like to make mine the night before and allow to rise.  Then put in the fridge overnight and bake in the morning.  Try to let them come to room temperature first though.

YUMMY, I MADE THEM WITHOUT A BREAD MACHINE BUT THEY TURNED OUT GREAT,  LET THE DOUGH REST THE FIRST TIME FOR ABOUT AND HOUR AND THEN ROLLED THEM OUT AND LET THEM RAISE FOR ANOTHER 45 MIN.  I DIDN'T HAVE POWDERED SUGAR BUT I HAD A CAN OF WHITE ICING.  JUST ZAPPED IT IN THE MICROWAVE FOR ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND DRIZZLED THAT OVER THEM - WONDERFUL.

I followed the directions exactly, but the dough came out very gooey, and they were overly sweet, I could only eat half of one.  I also tested them at work, and everyone there said too sweet.  I liked the frosting, and the filling, but all together with the gooey sweet pastry, it was just too much.  I thought they would be flaky-er.  Based on other reviews, it may be something I did, so I may give them another go.

I've made this for my family and for overnight guests as a special treat and every time they disappear in minutes.  If I'm short on time I skip making the dough and I unthaw and roll out a loaf frozen bread dough.  Easy to make and everyone will enjoy.

This recipe is flawless. I hope you'll follow it to the tee! If you have any people that don't like nuts, omit the pecans like I did for half the recipe. I have made this 6 times and everyone acts like they are better than Cinnabon! My only suggestion, double the recipe for frosting because people like to add on more :o)

I carefully reviewed the many recipes for Cinnamon Rolls before choosing this one.  What made up my mind was all the rave reviews this recipe has received.  I'm happy to say that they came out unbelievably fantastic and moist!!!

Like other reviewers, I also used my stand mixer instead of a bread machine, and proofed the yeast first.

Having a kosher kitchen, I only made a couple of slight modifications, making the recipe "pareve."  I substituted 1/2 cup warm water mixed with 1/2 non-dairy creamer for the one cup of milk this recipe calls for.  I also used margarine instead of the butter.

For a creamy pareve glaze, combine 1 cup powdered sugar, 1 TBSP softened margarine, and 5 teaspoons non-dairy creamer.  Mix together, adding a few more drops of creamer until of spreading consistency, but thick.  While warm, spread the white glaze over the cinnamon rolls.

Let's just say that these Cinnamon Rolls hardly made it to Shabbos!!

WOW - YUM!! If you put a cinnabun next to it I probably wouldn't know the difference. I didn't have a bread machine and this was the first time making cinnamon rolls so I followed the instructions from ChicagoCookie84 from her Sept 20 2007 entry and they turned out wonderful!

Fantastic & really quite easy. Although time consuming to prepare, it's worth every minute.  I threw my dough ingredients in the bread machine dough cycle, then went & did other things for the 1 hr., 20 min. cycle.  During that time, I also prepared the cinnamon mixture and the cream cheese frosting.  Once the dough is done, the rest is easy.  I prepared these at night & baked them in the morning before work (for a potluck breakfast at the office).  Everyone raved & raved about these, and could not believe I made them from scratch.  The only changes I made, were that I used French Vanilla pudding mix as that's what I had in my pantry, and I omitted the pecans because I wasn't sure if anyone had nut allergies at the office.  Excellent...just excellent.

These are THE best cinnamon rolls I've ever made or tasted.  I, like many others, make these by hand and use the whole package of instant pudding.  I just can't say enough about this recipe.  Even if you already have a favorite recipe give this one a try.  You might just find a new favorite!

WONDERFUL!! My oven has a bread proofer so I put them in to rise for about an hour.  Also, used a 3 oz. pkg. of cream cheese instead of the 8 oz. and the icing was perfect.  This made a little less icing but was plenty.

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and they were wonderful! I followed the instructions given to make the day before and refrigerate overnight. I let them rise about 2 1/2 hours before baking and they were fluffy and perfect. I brought them to work and everyone raved about them - this is definitely a recipe to keep and use often!

I LOVE these rolls.  They are easy to make and are so delicious.  They do take some time to make though - since my bread machine dought cycle is an hour and a half.  But they are worth it.  Instead of cinnamon for the filling, I'll use orange zest (along with the butter) and white sugar instead of brown.  Add with a glaze of milk and orange juice and powered sugar and you have the most delicious Orange Rolls you have ever tasted!  Thanks for this recipe.  It's a family favorite.

I love how fast the bread maker made this for me!  I enjoyed the flavor and the texture (didn't try the frosting tho).  I brought it in to work and didn't get any feedback which is unusual...  I don't know if people didn't like the nuts?   Will make again with raisins instead!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I should have listened to what others were saying about the frosting. It had way too much cream cheese in the frosting and that is why I gave it 4 stars. I did also increase the yeast to 4 tsp and proofed it in the warm milk, water, and sugar. I mixed this in my new stand mixer (my ultimate Christmas present) with the other dry ingredients. I will definitely be making this again. I think that I will try to use 3 oz of cream cheese to see how that works. Oh, I made these for Christmas morning (made them the day before and put them in the fridge over night) and they are already gone. They are just the right amount of sweet. This was a big hit with the family. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Christmas Morning breakfast and my girlfriend's husband could not stop eatting them.  Everyone loved them, even the kids who normall want the ones in the tube.  I made them the night before and put them in the fridge and in the morning they sat out for about 3 hrs before I cooked them and they came out perfect.  Can't wait to make them and bring them to work.

This was my second time attempting Cinnamon Rolls and my first success!  They turned out great, and I will definitely be making these again.

I didn't have a bread machine, so I just used my Kitchen Aid.  I put the yeast and warm water in the bowl and let it get thick.  Then I added all of the dough ingredients except for 1 cup of the flour and mixed with the dough hook.  When the dough started to form, I added flour until dough was no longer sticking to the sides, and a nice (semi-sticky) dough ball was formed.  I then just took out the dough, rinsed the bowl out, greased with oil, and put the dough back in the bowl, covering with cling wrap to rise in warm oven.  Turned out great!

Also, I just used all-purpose flour and it worked fine.

Now that I've made these several times, I've decided to revise my review...I make these with rapid rise yeast - Red Star - and French vanilla pudding - there's just something about that rich flavor that brings out the best in these cinnamon rolls.  I always fill with a mixture of brown and white sugar, cinnamon, raisins and walnuts.  I've tried many cinnamon roll recipes, but this one is by far the best!  Thanks for sharing!

Did not like these at all, tasted nothing like the ones at the mall and very time consuming.  I make one with frozen bread dough and whipping cream that is extremely easy and much better tasting!

Absolutely no complaints- these cinnamon rolls are phenomenal.  I've always been too afraid to try making them but have made them twice now, and both times it came out perfectly.  Perfectly risen, excellent texture and sweetness, and picture perfect.  I used regular all-purpose flour and added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten.  I also used a bit less cream cheese (and it was light) since that was all I had, and the icing turned out great.  Anyone complaining about the dough being too dense or tough is doing something wrong.  Make sure your yeast is fresh and that it rises properly.  I placed a big bowl of hot water in the (cold) oven with the rolls like someone suggested and it rose perfectly without drying the tops- and no need to cover them.  Always get rave reviews over these.

I cannot count how many times I have made these. Each time they get rave reviews from fellow staff and family. I have even added an entire package of pudding mix, and they still came out great.

I don't know what I did wrong,but mine wouldn't rise. I even tried it again the same day (I was trying to make some to take camping) and it didn't turn out then either?! All of my ingredients are fresh so it wasn't that. I went back to my tried and true recipe from my Kitchen Aid mixer book and used the cinnamon mix from this recipe. That was really good! I might try again another time when I have the patience.

Oh....my....gosh, these rolls are awesome!!  I could make myself sick by overeating these, it's so hard to stop!  The only "complaint" is that the middle rolls don't cook as well in the pan as the outside rolls do, so they are quite gooey.  Almost a bit too much for me, but still good.  I'm afraid to cook the rolls longer for fear of drying out the others.  Next time I'll add the entire box of pudding, but that's the only change I'd make.  These rolls are going on day three- and they're still super soft and delicious, especially after about 20 seconds in the microwave.  Thank you thank you THANK YOU for such a delicious recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I did use the bread machine and the dough came out perfect!  I baked mine for around 20 minutes and they came out perfect.  I also used another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of powdered sugar in the icing to take away the strong cream cheese flavor.  This also helped thicken it up a bit. My whole family loved them and I will make these again!

This is the first time I made cinnamon rolls from scratch! I loved how they came out (I didnt use a bread machine), but they were not the best I ever tasted. Great recipe though! The icing is not quite to my liking. I'd put less cream cheese next time.

My husband and I loved these.  The only thing about them was that it took longer than 15 minutes to cook.  We weren't sure when they were finished and so after putting on the frosting and trying to eat them we discovered that it was still doughy. In spite of that we are planning on making them again really soon knowing what to watch for this time.  Absolutely wonderful.

My husband loves cinnamon rolls and I never once thought that I could make them myself.  This recipe was very easy to follow and enabled me to make my very own pan of cinnamon rolls that taste delicious.  My husband loved them!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  They are wonderful!  I used ground pecans and added a little more butter to the top of the rolled out dough as well as a little more brown sugar than it called for.  Thanks, I will be making these again.

A word of caution... if you make these, be prepared to become addicted to them!  WOW!  This is the best recipe I have ever tried, and it is now my standard.  I added just a tiny bit more brown sugar and cinnamon to the spread.  I think this dough would also make great dinner rolls, as it's not too sweet.

WONDERFUL! I have never made cinnamon rolls before but the breadmaker made it so easy.  I actually made 18 rolls, and put 12 in the 9 X 13 pan and the other 6 in a pie plate (I don't think they would have all fit in one pan).  I also made them the night before, then just put them in the fridge covered in plastic wrap sprayed with cooking spray like others suggested.  I took them out for 45 minutes in the morning before baking and they were a hit!

These are absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used both a 9 x 13 pan AND an 8 x 8 pan.  There just didn't seem to be enough room in the 9 x 13 pan for expansion.  Also, I doubled the icing to spread on both pans.  For some reason, the dough didn't work in my bread maker (it's probably my machine's fault), so I made it in my Kitchenaid mixer instead.  I'll definitely be making these again and again.  Thanks!

Superb!  I always have to make a double batch for my family.  I heat the milk, water, butter, sugar & salt until the butter is melted.  Then I wait until the liquid is luke warm.  I add it  to the rest of the dry ingredients.

I am never very good with yeast rolls. But the kids and I were just home today and I felt like baking. I picked a great recipe to try! I used my kitchen aid like others had and the dough turned out wonderfully. The only changed I made was to do a little more brown sugar -cinnamon mix. I also have difficulty rolling out the dough, it just doesn't want to stretch into shape. Anyway the family loved them, Thanks!!

the dough was a dream to roll out!  I made a second batch and omitted the frosting.  We like ours with extra syrup so I melted butter and brown sugar and put that on the bottom of the pan before I put the 
unbaked ones in it. The second batch was  better!

Best cinnamon rolls ever! I used 1 whole package of pudding and the dough is perfect. I also used the icing recipie from "Cinnimon rolls 2" (roman numeral 2) These never last more than a day. My neighbor came over and ate 3! People have actually harrassed me for this recipie. This is perfection people!

I made these exactly as described, using French Vanilla flavored pudding mix.  I made the dough in the bread machine in the evening, and rolled it up, cut and put in the pan.  I covered the pan with some plastic wrap that I sprayed with some cooking spray (so that if it rose it wouldn't stick).  Then I put it overnight in the fridge.  I took them out about 45 minutes before I baked them....they were incredible.  The entire family loved them, and they made a great start to Thanksgiving breakfast!  I think next time I will do what some previous posters did and freeze individual portions so that I can make 4-6 at a time...this is a lot for me LOL!

AMAZING!!! These taste exactly like cinnabuns! I used the whole pudding packet like the other reviewers suggested. However... DO NOT double the frosting recipie. It was just too much frosting. Also, this is the most perfect dough I have ever made. It alomsot brought a tear to my eye! Definately a keeper. Also, very easy.

I have made these twice and they have turned out wonderful both times. I followed the advice of some other reviewers that really helped.  I added the entire box of instant pudding and made a carmel mixture out of heavy cream, butter, and brown sugar for the bottom of the pan.  I also lowered the temp to 325 and cooked them a bit longer to avoid too-gooey rolls in the middle. I found that they browned quickly on the top, so tented them with foil the second time I made them and they turned out great. Everyone in our house loves these cinnamon rolls!

I love to make things in my bread machine. I have made cinnamin rolls before in my bread machine, but none like this.  These were the best yet and would have stayed nice for several days if they would have lasted that long.

Absolutely Fabulous! Thank you! I made them for brunch 2 weeks ago, and not only did everyone fight over the last one, my husband has requested them every weekend since. Cinnabon was an addiction for me, and now I can have them at home, every day! Wouldnt change a thing about the recipe.

THESE ARE DELICIOUS! I don't care about comparing them to Cinnabon (which I consider generic tasting) the dough, the icing, the filling - all in perfect harmony. I used the entire box of vanilla pudding.

These are *very good* cinnamon rolls.  I have a similar recipe that dries out the next day, but
these remained moist and soft the day after.  I thought they could have used a little more icing, though.  I used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour and they turned out great.

WOW! What a great recipe! The rolls yielded 20 for me.  I was suprised at how moist they remained.  I was out out nuts so I used minced apple instead.  Very Yummy!  Will definitely make again (and again....).

Incredibly good.  Very light.  I made the following changes - partly b/c I didn't have everything on hand, partly b/c I wanted the machine to make the dough overnight.  I used dry buttermilk powder, adding the required water w/the wet ingred., and the powder with the dry ingred., so I didn't have milk sitting out all night.  I used a custard mix, rather than pudding (NOT instant), because I just didn't have any instant vanilla.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla and only made 1/2 the frosting (so the rolls wouldn't be swimming in it), it was tight, but each roll got frosting - and it's pretty potent stuff.  I was worried the dough wouldn't work b/c of the changes - but I had no problems.  I can't imagine they could have turned out any better.

These were excellent!  I substituted lemon pudding for the vanilla pudding since I didn't have any available though.  And I used the recipe from the "clone of cinnabon" recipe instead of this one since it had less cream cheese and another reviewer had suggested it.  Overall, I am impressed with these rolls.  Excellent taste and good size.  Yum.  :)

These cinnamon rolls were very delicious and so easy to make.  I did change the icing recipe the second time I made them to the cinnabon clone icing.  It was thicker and had less cream cheese.  You've gotta try this one!

This was ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! Very easy, very delicious.  Everyone went crazy for them.  I also used the whole packet of vanilla pudding and let the dough rest about 15 minutes before rolling it out.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!

It was very good! I already  had a wonderful reicpe that I found at BHG site several years ago ,but we really liked this one's flavor( must be the pudding) I accidently used a whole box  of pudding but it came out okay?? I  will make again-defintely a 5 star plus!   update - I  make this  traditional way and   it still comes out  great and I use   a pan of  warm water under first rising--

I loved this recipe.  I did make a mistake and 
added the whole pkg of pudding mix the first time
I made them and I actually liked them better with
the whole pkg.  I also added a few raisins in a
batch and they were wonderful!!!!

These were fantastic.  The people at work loved them!  I didn't have vanilla pudding so I used instant cheesecake pudding instead.  It still worked.  The egg wasn't at room temperature so I just ran it under warm water for a few minutes.  Apparantly this recipe is very forgiving.

My mom used to make cinnamon rolls when I was a little girl and I wanted to try to make them. So, I set out to find a good recipe. Well, the bucks stopped here-no need to look any further. This recipe is wonderful!! I love "cinnabons" and now I can have a taste of them without the expense. The second time I made them I added a few nuts into the frosting also--just because I love nuts!
Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

I would echo all the rave reviews for this recipe -- incredibly easy to make and they disappear as soon as they come out of the oven. For the pudding mix, I tried the cheesecake flavor and it gave them an interesting twang.

First time I ever made cinnamon rolls, they turned out wonderful!  Made them for easter and took 16 of them to an 8 person gathering.  I didn't leave with single one.  I got emails the next day saying that these rolls are my new item to bring to the family events.  I did wonder about the pudding though.  It says 1/2 package (3.4 oz) but pudding comes in 0.25 oz packages right?

Give this recipe 20 stars!  We had these Easter morning and the crowd went wild!  I usually don't enjoy my own cooking to much (after all the work and taste testing...), but I ate two of these!  Thank you for this recipe we will be making these over and over!

The description on these doesn't lie - they are just as good, if not BETTER than the "Cinnabon" Cinnamon Rolls.  My husband loves those yummy gooey ones from the mall, and now I can make them for him at home.  This recipe is perfect!!

This recipe turned out wonderful.  The first time around I accidentally added a whole cup of warm water and just about threw it all out because the dough was so sticky.  I finished with the process though and it came out incredible, but was more like a cinnamon roll "cake".  I put the glaze over the top and then people could cut out the size that they wanted! Moral of the story:  stick with it, sometimes mistakes can turn out yummy too!  Second time around I added some raisins (and with the right amount of water) they came out PERFECT!

These are the BEST cinnamon rolls ever! I have earned a reputation as an expert baker, at work and with family, just because of these rolls! The only problem is...now everyone expects me to make them ALL THE TIME! I use a bit more butter and cinnamon in the fillng than the recipe calls for, because we like them extra gooey! My grandma would be so proud of me..her cinnamon rolls were the family standard for years. Thanks!

Excelent recipe. Dough was easy to make and handle, and the rolls were nice and moist. The frosting (which needed quite a bit more milk than specified) was wonderful, like melted ice cream! Very rich.

I guess I am old fashioned enough to wonder why anyone wants to add pudding mix and/or cream cheese to a cinnamon  roll recipe. Why add superfulous stuff when one can have fabulous rolls with the basic ingredients. The additions add costs, make more work and  don't seem to add flavor. Is it a cinnamon roll or not?

Very good. I don't have a bread machine, so I made the dough by hand. I first mixed the yeast and warm water, then added the other ingredients. I used the whole package of vanilla pudding. I kneaded the dough for about 8 minutes, then let it rise for an hour. Then I created the rolls and let them rise again for about 45 minutes. I cooked the rolls for about 17 minutes, but should have cooked them a few minutes longer, as the ones in the middles weren't totally done.

This was my first time making cinnamon rolls.  I tried out the recipe on Thursday before the Easter brunch on Sunday just to make sure they would be awesome like all of the reviewers said.  They were good, but definitely not great.  I agree with another reviewer who said they thought the vanilla pudding added a weird taste.  And my first rise went fine, but the second one took FOREVER and the rolls were still dense and hard when they were finished. I will not be making these again.

Delicious! This recipe made my day. I did not expect it to be that good.I used the bread-maker for the dough. I had to add a little bit of extra flour though cause mine felt too loose to me. It was an absolute hit.  Thank you so much for sharing it. Great recipe! :)

OMG these are so good they are addictive. I followed the recipe exactly except I used all purpose flour (didn't have any bread machine flour) and I used fast acting bread machine yeast plus 1 cup of chopped pecans instead of the 3/4 cup listed in the recipe. I made my dough in my bread machine because it's so much easier then having to knead it by hand. I'm no spring chicken anymore so my bread machine gets the workout rather then my hands these days and it does a great job. We could hardly wait for them to come out of the oven so we could try them and they made my kitchen smell so good. They were delicious right out of the oven but even better warmed up in the microwave the next morning if that's even possible. We'll both be lucky if we don't gain 10 lbs. by Springtime but boy we're sure going to enjoy putting those pounds on. This will be my go to cinnamon roll recipe from now on. Thank you so much Miss Alix for sharing your wonderful cinnamon role recipe with the rest of the world.

Absolutely the best recipe for cinnamon rolls.  My sons devour these.  The pudding in the mix makes them extra soft.  I have even used butterscotch pudding and it was great, too!  This is the only recipe we use for rolls!

I bake a lot of bread and rolls and this one was amazing!  This is my new go to recipe for any type of roll and even for a delicious loaf of bread.  The cinnamon rolls were TO DIE for - I used both the cream cheese frosting that is published here - (very good) but my family loves icing so I made my go to icing recipe and they liked it even better with that.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

The is the best Cinnamon roll recipe ever. The bread machine makes these so easy I can make several batches a day. I have been using this recipe for a few years now. I give these as gifts for my neighbors, family and friends. The only change I made was to use 2 eggs. I found the dough was much easier to roll out but was not sticky. They turn out so soft and delicious. Just like eating the expensive ones from the mall. You won't be disappointed.

Loved the icing and will use it in the future on my cinnamon rolls.  Not crazy though about dough using pudding in the mix.  I have made this twice and prefer just a basic cinnamon roll dough with the cream cheese icing mix provided.

LOVED the rolls HATED the icing...made the mistake of dumping it all on at once, and we all thought it had a weird "tangy" taste...not like the mall ones at all...Making it again this morning for easter, sans icing....My suggestion, let people add their own icing before ruining the whole batch! 

On the Rolls side of things...the best I've ever made, for sure my go to recipie. I don't have a bread machine, so I knead it the old school way and let it rise twice (once the night before, form the rolls then pop them in the fridge and the second the morning of before I put them in the oven)

Amazingly delicious and easy.  The batch made enough for 3 round disposable tins, so cook 1 and freeze the other 2., along with frosting packages for each. Easy to just thaw them and throw in the oven, and frost when nearly cool. So good!

We really liked these and I love using my bread machine for making doughs. I had to bake the cinnamon rolls for 30 minutes, covered halfway through with foil to prevent excess browning. I added the whole box of pudding mix as I didn't want a half box laying around and I was too lazy to measure it as well. I omitted the nuts and doubled the cinnamon.

I followed the recipe exactly. This household loves them. Much better than store bought and using the bread maching made it seem too easy. Very good recipe.

This recipe is the best cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried. Delicious, but dangerous as you can't stop eating them! My kids and husband loved them! I will make again.

Fabulous, but had to bake 10 minutes more - still doughy after recommended baking time.

Delicious! We're cooking for two so the bake some now and freeze some for later works best for us.  I even froze the icing by dropping onto wax paper and freezing until firm solid.  About a tablespoon per roll works out well.

OMG!!! just had one of these babies..I added a small hand full of Dark chocolate chips to some butter to make a syrup to drizzle over the brown sugar . and added a double dose of cinnamon to the sugar....This was soooo good... I will never use another recipe again. The dark chocolate really gave it that extra kick of heaven. The recipe is still perfect without the chocolate, That's If you don't want a sweeter mix. Thank you, Thank you, YUMMY !!!

They looked pretty, they rose OK, but I've had better. Not sure what the fuss is all about over this recipe. I've made cinnamon rolls many times and these were nothing special.

Caution when making.....you could very well end up eating the whole batch.  These were amazing! Best cinnamon rolls I have ever made. I use one box of sugar free, fat free instant vanilla pudding, 2.1 ounce. Made them last night for a dinner party, made them again. today!

these turned out really good! i am just learning how to cook, and this was my first time making cinnamon rolls, so I wasn't sure how they would turn out, but we all loved them! 
I used all purpose flour...not sure how it differs from bread flour, but my dough was kind of not very stretchy or elastic. I had to work at getting it to roll out to the right size, but other than that, I had no problems and enjoyed making these.
oh and I misread the recipe and used a full pack of vanilla pudding instead of half, lol. they still tasted amazing, though.

My niece made these one weekend. Fabulous. I've made them and shared them with family and friends. Easy, wonderful and everyone LOVES them. Thanks to Miss Alix for sharing it originally. Update: I'm still making these and everyone loves them! I like to pipe the frosting on warm rolls (not hot) and let it spread naturally as the rolls cool.

I have made these rolls twice.  They are great.  I mix the dough in my bread machine and like to make half raisin and half pecan, slicing each half into 9 rolls and baking in 2 8" square pans.  I baked the first batch right away, but the second batch I made the night before, covered with a linen and put in the fridge overnight.  I let them rise about 45 minutes before baking them the next day.  Both batches turned out great.  I made my own frosting, so I can't vouch for that, but the dough is yummy.

So good! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as written, except I just made a powdered sugar glaze (without the cream cheese). They were really great rolls! Sweet and tasty without being overpoweringly sweet. I'll definitely make them again. I might even try adding pumpkin or something!

I made these today... They were good, just not great. The cinnamon filling wasn't very gooey to me-- I was thinking about making a butter cinnamon spread instead of putting on the dough. Overall good, but more bread like than expected.

I have made this recipe 4-5 times now and it comes out great every time.  I leave out the nuts because my family doesn't care for them, otherwise I make it exactly as written.  They are delicious and everyone has always loved them!

The best cinnamon rolls ever.  I used sugar free pudding.  I did not add the pecans and reduced the amount of cinnamon due to preference.

This is the first time I've ever written a review. I have to say this is by far the worst cinnamon roll ever. Followed the recipe exactly, the dough was stiff and heavy. I can say the icing was good though. Looking for a new recipe.

I like the fact the bread maker does all the "hard" work.  I didn't have milk so I switched the milk for 1/2 c evaporated milk mixed with 1/2 c of water, and also I only had cook and serve pudding mix. I used half of the mix as in the recipe.  An hour and half later I had perfect dough for rolling. The rest I did as called for in a 9x13 pan. I didn't make creamed cheese frosting though, I used some leftover vanilla glaze in a squirt bottle I had leftover in the fridge. I mic'd it and squirted it all over the tops while hot.  Very Good!!! This recipe takes awhile to make but it is worth the wait! Oh, and I used all purpose flour too

This is hands down the best cinnamon roll recipe on this website!  I have made it twice, making the dough in the bread machine.  It comes out perfectly.  They have the perfect amount of cinnamon, and the frosting is really good.  The second time, I added a tsp. of maple syrup to the frosting.  It makes it have a really good flavor.

Great taste! This was the first time I made cinnamon rolls, loved the easy recipe and the taste was great. I made half less dry, with less butter and other half more buttery to see which one my family will like more. they both turned out great! thanks for the recipe.
I tried keeping few rolls for about 3-4 days to see how they hold on and they didn't taste that good. Better roll them and freeze , tow and bake once you need them!

I had a hard time deciding if I should give it 3 or 4 stars. These are good...the taste of the dough is great and is really light and fluffy. What I didn't like is that there wasn't enough sugar and cinnamon filling! And that is one of the best parts of the Cinnabon rolls. Also, I didn't like the cream cheese icing, I like cinnamon rolls better with a regular icing without the cream cheese. Next time I make these I will double and maybe even triple the filling and make a different type of icing. Other than those two preferences, it is a good recipe.

These have become a Christmas morning tradition at my house!  I make a big breakfast, so I prefer smaller cinnamon rolls that don't fill up the whole plate - so I make mine smaller and get 24 or so out of the recipe.  Also, unlike most, I don't like when they are really gooey.  I like to spread them out on a large baking sheet so the rolls get golden and more done on the outside.  
These make wonderful Christmas presents - especially for friends and neighbors who don't bake!  They definitely impress!  They freeze well, so you can make ahead with instructions to:  freeze, transfer to refrigerator Christmas Eve, let rise 45 min in the morning and bake.

With a new recipe, I usually turn to my husband to see his reaction while tasting a dish, and use that as my barometer. These were so good that I did not even need his feedback! I took the suggestions from other users, increase butter and cinn in filling, and I also added 1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg for a holiday touch! STUPENDOUS! Now I am making 4 batches to freeze for the holiday. Genius!

BEST cinnamon roll recipe I have found. I did as others had suggested and added a whole package of vanilla pudding mix. I also made a bit more icing. Huge hit!

This recipe is a 100 on a scale of 1 to 10!!! I simplified it, and it worked just fine. I warmed the water, milk and butter together in a glass 2-cup measuring cup in the microwave to 120 degrees (about 1-1/2 minutes). Meanwhile, I mixed all the dry ingredients together (including the yeast; I buy yeast in the jar and use a level tablespoon) in a large bowl. I put the warm liquids in the bread machine, then the egg, then the dry ingredients, and set the machine for dough. When it finished, for the filling, I mixed the melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together (left out the nuts) and pressed them gently by hand into the rolled out dough before I rolled it up.  I have made them numerous times and they turn out wonderfully! This is such a great recipe! I don't think you could mess it up unless your yeast was bad.

I try this very good cinnamon roll III and it was very good  they would melt in your mouth. I will give this recipe a 10.
Diane Day  Tazewell, Tn.     I'm going to use sugar free pudding next time. Just to see if they are as good.

I forgot to add in my review that I prepared them the night before, wrapped them tightly in press-and-seal and put them in the fridge. Then I baked them the next morning and they were perfect.

These were good, but definitely not what I would consider Cinnabon dupes. The flavor of the dough was really nice, but the frosting wasn't rich or sweet enough, and there definitely wasn't enough richness in the filling either. These would be an ok option for a special breakfast/brunch, but weren't the decadent, once-a-year dessert I hoped they would be (made them instead of birthday cake)

Wonderful recipe. The rolls are not heavy like others I've tried. I think they are better than  Cinnabonbecause they are not dense but light and fluffy. The only thing I would do different is to use clear vanilla so the icing comes out white. Will definately make these again.

5 stars all the way!  I decided to try this recipe when we had friends over for bbq and didn't have any dessert to serve.  I was a little nervous that
 It wouldn't turn out right but I followed the exact recipe and it was perfect when it came out of the oven.  The whole pan was gone in a matter of minutes.  Thank you, Miss Alix!

OMG these are amazing!  My son and his friend sat down and ate a whole pan right out of the oven.  These just melt in your mouth.  Try this recipe before you try any other cinnamon roll receipt - you won't be disappointed!  You don't need a bread machine, works fine without.  Thanks Miss Alix for this wonderful recipe!

These were absolutely delicious.  It's the best cinnamon roll recipe I've come across so far.  The only thing I did differently was mix the bread by hand (according to how one of the other reviewers suggested), added the whole package of pudding, omitted the pecans and doubled the frosting.

This is the most amazing cinnamon rolls!  I have tried many other recipes but none of them even compare!  The only thing I do different is, I add the whole pkg of pudding. Why have 1/2 sitting around waiting to spill?  I have done the butter/sugar/cinnamon combo 2 different ways. Spread butter then sprinkle brown brown sugar/cinnamon on & mix all three together in a small bowl & then spread on. I felt there was no difference in outcome. Both amazing!  This dough is actually a pleasure to work with!  Enjoy!  For ease I usually just use a boughten can of frosting. :)

Absolutely the best homemade cinnamon roll recipe I've ever tried. They were over the top moist and extremely fluffy when you follow directions to allow full rising of dough. I did add a bit more cinnamon for my husbands rolls, but recipe was perfect!!!

This is a decent recipe. (I don't like adding "pudding" to any recipe. To me, it obscures true flavors and textures. It's a fake additive....) In the case of this recipe, my wife thought the final product was a bit denser than my current favorite cinnamon bun recipe, the "Clone of a Cinnabon." Check that one out as an alternative. I don't do the breadmaker version, but do the dough myself. Really nice.

These are the best rolls I've ever made and my boys would have had them gone last night if I had let them!  The dough has a better flavour than lost, probably because of the vanilla pudding which adds a subtle but flavourful difference.  Great recipe!  Don't change a thing!

This was an amazing recipe.  We were a Secret Santa  to a family this year and I made these for their Sat. night gift so they'd have breakfast Sunday morning.  They ended up telling me how much they loved these, without them knowing it was us.  She raved about these being betters than her Mom's and she thought those were the best.  I can't wait to make them for my own family this weekend!

Just made these for a party.  Followed another reviewers directions to making them 100% by hand (no bread machine), and it was the most delicious dessert by leaps and bounds!!!!!  I won't need to look for another cinnamon roll recipe again!  Thank-you, thank-you, from a non-baker!!!

wow- I loved these rolls! I actually made mine with Orange filling for a change-  but the rolls were so soft and tender.  Absolutely wonderful.  (I did bake them in a 9x13- I like inside pieces best, for 20 minutes)

Theres a lot of diabetics in my family, So i used sugar free vanilla pudding, sugar free vanilla frosting and a mix of splenda brown sugar and splenda with the cinnamon for the inside and they turned out fantastic!    Thanks for the recipe Miss Alix!   First time ive ever used the bread machine just for dough ;)

GREAT RECIPE! First time I made it, it was already perfect! My family finished it until it's last crumb! I did not have a dough machine so I just used the traditional method--by hand. I followed ~Marianne~ 's  directions on how to get the dough ready by hand & she is awesome! The dough was perfect and ahhh. I'm going to make some again soon! :)

Absolutely the best cinnamon rolls! I have used the recipes for a few years now. My family and friends are always telling me that these are the best cinnamon rolls they've ever had. Very soft and delicious! I am going to make another batch tomorrow. The only different thing I do was to use the entire bag of the vanilla pudding 3.4 oz all the way in :)) thank you for the recipe. It's the keeper.

This recipe was a HUGE success!!!  Hadn't had cinnamon rolls turn out since 2002 and my fam absolutely loved this version!  I did make a couple alterations however.  Instead of vanilla pudding mix I used "cheesecake" pudding mix which made the flavor even more rich.  I also used canned milk instead of warm milk because I was too lazy :)   When I iced the finished product ALMOST the entire pan was eaten in one night!  I am making them again tonight :)  Thank you for an awesome recipe...it turned out PERFECT!

The texture of these rolls is excellent, but I miss the bite that my sourdough cinnamon rolls have. These seemed rather bland. I'm going to try to adapt this recipe to my sourdough one. I very much appreciated Marianne's instructions for non-bread machine dough. BTW, I use 2 teaspoons of orange juice concentrate in my icing rather than vanilla, for extra taste.

I made these the night before and took the suggestion of many to put them in the fridge overnight and then set out and bake in the morning.  My rolls did not rise like I expected them to. Not sure if this was because I had used regular baking flour and not bread flour.  I will try again and use bread flour to see if that was the culprit.  I used my own recipe for the cream cheese frosting and the rolls were great!!  Will definitely try again!

As an ex-pat American living in New Zealand this is a fantastic taste of home. We've made it several times and the whole family love it. As rookies at making dough it took us a couple of times to get it right, but the wait was well worth it.

This recipe is awesome. I doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon and raised the butter up to 1/2 cup for the filling. I didn't have any bread flour so I used all purpose flour and it rose great! I also used a store bought can of cream cheese frosting and it melted great when I put it on the hot rolls. I also used the whole package of vanilla pudding and it gave it a great flavor. I will definitely be making this again. My kids love it!

THE BEST EVER !!!!I made the dough in my breadmaker on the dough cycle.....WoW, the only thing I changed was to put more of the brown suger/cinnamon mix in the center before I rolled them up...( I like them with more goo)..I made extra and froze them ..then I vacuum sealed them (after they were frozen) Now when I need a roll fix ..I just take out one...nuke it and pour me a cup of coffee....I will make these forever!

This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls. I've made other types of breads before. Had no problem with the dough but the outcome was less than thrilling. Not bad but won't be making these again. I didn't feel that there was enough filling and unlike other reviews, not enough cinnamon for me. I actually added an extra tsp. and I still was underwhelmed with the cinnamon taste. Overall just okay.

Yum! I think the pudding in the dough makes these wonderful.  I'll use the whole package of pudding next time. I also made 1 1/2 times the filling and it was just enough; I softened the butter and mixed the cinnamon, brown sugar, and pecans with the butter and spread the mixture on the dough. Finally, I used the icing from Cinnamon Rolls II on this site.  Family loved these!

It's been years since I have tried making these. I was a litted hesitant, because I haven't had much success with working with yeast. So I dusted off my breadmaker, followed the recipe as written and they were a big hit!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these for Easter brunch and they were a hit! And so easy!  I used a bread maker to kneed to dough and followed the recipe exactly (except used 1 cup of pecans instead of 3/4). I had three that wouldn't fit in the pan so I put them in the freezer for later (we will see how that goes).  I will definitely make them again.

I had wanted to learn how to make Cinnamon Rolls for a long time, and decided to try this recipe yesterday.  AMAZINGLY EASY. I hate kneading dough and this recipe puts that to rest.  Perfect dough, with a great taste.  I made the recipe exactly as written only to the exclusion of the cream cheese.  I just used a simple powdered sugar, milk and vanilla icing.  Easy to roll out and cut. BRAVO ALLRECIPES! This is a winner!

These were so good! My family absolutely LOVED them! I changed the frosting a bit and instead of using 1 cup powdered sugar I used a little less than half. The frosting came out delicious and I figured it would keep the kids from bouncing off the walls!

By far some of the best cinnamon rolls we've ever had! I used a little more milk to thin out the icing. Also, I would turn down the oven temp just a shade next time, because the bottoms got quite brown.

I thought these were ok, but not great.  They did not taste like a Cinnabon, which in our house is a good thing as we're not fans.  I did omit the nuts this time.  The rolls themselves had a nice texture, and a decent, not-too-sweet flavor, but to my surprise, I really did not like the cream cheese frosting at all.   I think if I were to make these again I would go with just a plain icing instead of the cream cheese one.

I have had so many compliments on these! They are better than any other - and I've tried many! I have made these so many times that I have made a few changes. I make the dough in the bread machine (liquid first, dry, then yeast on top) then bake in the oven. For the icing: I use the whipped cream cheese (just for ease),  1 1/2 cup conf sugar, and add 1 tbsp vanilla and a dash of salt. UPDATE: I have since made these and cooked the second pan for 1/2 the time written for then put them in the freezer. When ready to use again, thaw and cook. May have compromised a small amount of "fluffyness" but were just as delicious on a day we wouldn't have had time to make them otherwise.

This is my new favorite cinnamon roll recipe! I've used clone of a cinnabon forever, but decided to try something different. These are even better. Super soft and moist. I'm glad I came across this recipe.

I have made these cinnamon rolls several times.  I have found it essential to brush the tops of the rolls with a generous amount of butter before popping them in the oven, to keep them nice and moist.  I've also tried doubling the cinnamon mixture and the icing, but in the end felt that the recipe came out best as-is.

Yum!  I added homemade caramel sauce to the bottom and everyone commented on how good these rolls were.  I will definitely be making these again! I cut the dough into 8 rolls instead of 16 and assembled these in a bundt pan, pushing them down gently .  I refrigerated them overnight, pulled them out in the morning to let them rise for about an hour before baking.  I did need about 5 extra minutes of baking time using this method.  This is a winner.

These were pretty good. I only modified the recipe because I didn't have certain ingredients. I used all purpose flour instead and would probably need about 4 1/2 cups next time. Also I didn't have vanilla inst pudding, but I had the seasonal pumpkin pie kind so I used that. These were delicious.

Loved these! They are super easy and the best by far that I've tried and I have been trying several looking for this recipe. The only thing I would suggest is to use more butter and brown sugar on the filling part it does seem to be more dry than I prefer. I didn't use a bread machine either and these were great!

OMG! These are  sooo good! For neighbor gifts this Christmas, I'm baking them in tree-shaped aluminum cake pans from the dollar store. I'm sure they'll be appreciated. (Young teens didn't like pecans. I'll remember to make some w/o nuts next time.)

Very good! I made the dough by hand, and took longer to rise than stated. (because I didn't have a warm place to put the dough). I also added 2tsp of vital wheat gluten to the bread flour for the heck of it. Also, I used 6tbs of butter instead of 4tbs for the inside of the rolls, and a sheet pan instead of a 9x13in pan. I found that they look nicer that way. over all, this is a wonderful recipe! :)

These were absolutely out of this world.  I made them the traditional method the night before and refrigerated them.  They rose in spite of the refrigeration.  I took them out the next morning and let them sit for 45 minutes.  They didn't rise much more than they already had risen.  My Mother said these were the best she'd ever eaten.  I've always wanted to make homemade cinnamon rolls and I'm glad this is the recipe I selected to make - they turned out great.  Thanks for sharing!

These were excellent. I made them old fashioned (no breadmaker). I just incorporated the warm water and yeast and let set 10 minutes. Mixed all other ingredients except 3 cups of flour and then added yeast. The dough didn't rise as much as I thought. I actually throughout the first batch of dough because I thought my water had been to hot and killed the yeast. However, when I made the second batch it was the same reaction. I went on and finished them and they turned out wonderful. They baked up big, flaky, and delicious. Perfect.

Wow, these are so good!!!  Easy to make and the basic recipe allows for so many ways to be creative.  It is easy to  make caramel pecan rolls with a caramel icing, or using raisins and white sugar instead of nuts and brown sugar in the filling for yummy cinnamon raisin rolls.  This is a wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

These were PERFECT! and I love that they use vanilla pudding mix!  I think that made all the difference.  I think I overcooked them a little bit (burnt the tops, but as soon as they got out of the oven I drenched them with a confectioners sugar and milk mix, this soaked right in and didn't let the buns get crispy (since they were a bit brown on top).  They are perfect.  I also used the Sauteed Apples recipe from this site and spread those on the inside of half of the cinnamon buns before rolling them up (and after adding the butter, cinnamon, and sugar).  This was AWESOME! Like an apple turnover. TRY IT!

FABULOUS!!!   No wonder there are already 650 reviews!  It's been a life long challengee to find a perfect cinnamon roll.  Most don't rise properly, are too dry, etc etc.  I randomly came across this recipe and the picture intreged me because they do look like the cinnamon rolls at the mall, which I am partial to except I find them "too greasy" and "too sweet".  This recipe had all the main features of the mall recipe, rose really well, great frosting and nice cinnamon flavors without the over butter flavor.  This will be my all time keeper (and trust me I am a really good cook and have tried MANY cinnamon roll recipes!).

Tried this 3 times. Dough really sticky and wet. 2nd time added half the water, it held together better but wouldn't rise. Made bread from same yeast & flour so ingredients were good. 3rd time tried to compromise on the water, still heavy like rocks after baking.

I didn't realize how easy it was to make my own cinnamon rolls from scratch! it tastes so good fresh from the oven. recipe was easy to follow. do note that it is important that you proof the yeast otherwise dough will not rise.  ps. i took another reviewer's suggestion and made a gooey icing using ice cream. scrumptiously delicious!

I was really nervous about making this since I have never made any sort of dough before, I dont have a bread machine and had no idea what people meant when they kept talking about proofing yeast.  How I ended up proofing was adding warm water...115-120 degrees, to the yeast and lightly (and by lightly i mean I just laid it over the bowl and didnt secure to edges) covering the bowl with plastic wrap and leaving it for several minutes 5-10..itll start to smell really strong.  i think i meant to leave it for 5 but it ended up being closer to ten.  I kept to the recipe but like others I did the whole package of pudding.  This took me 4 hours to make and my kitchen and my clothes looked like a warzone after I was done, but i cant even tell you how worth it was!!! I dont normally like cinnamon rolls that much, but wow!!!! amazing! i used the icing that miss alix provided and I thought it was great.  not too sweet or thick.  seriously, probably the best thing I have ever had.

These are amazing.  I've made them twice.  I did them exactly the way the recipe said the first time and they were so good.  Very sweet.  The second time I made them, I didn't put the frosting on right away, so they turned out a little dry, but still good.

In a word -- sinful.  These were so good that between three of us, we finished a third of the rolls in one morning.  Eeks!  Took some to my neighbors who were still raving about them a week later!  Thanks for the wonderful and EASY recipe!

I've made this numerous times.  It is a family favorite.  The only thing I do different is to add the whole box of pudding and leave out the sugar.  We do a simple powdered sugar glaze, as my family prefers that on cinnamon rolls instead of the cream cheese.  A++

It took a lot of time to make these rolls, and no one in my home liked them, but ate them to make me happy. :(  These rolls looked great, but were very bready, not flaky or tender at all. Disappointing! The frosting was not that great, and was actually quite sour, due to the cream cheese.  My suggestion would be to leave out the cream cheese in the frosting recipe, maybe that would make it better.

Oh my these are amazing! I have made cinnamon rolls before but they do not even come close to these! I loved the bread and the filling and the icing! These will be my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls from now on. I only ended up with 11 rolls because I cut mine thicker than I was supposed to. I made them in the evening up to the second rise then covered them and put them in the fridge in the morning I took them out and set them on the counter while the oven was preheating and then baked. So I didn't have to get up at 3 am to make them. Also when I pulled them out of the oven I thought they were done so I iced them when I went to serve them I realized the middle was raw still. So even though I had iced them I put them back into the oven and baked for another 15 minutes and they were fine. The icing firmed up a little bit but nothing bad happened to it. So if this happens to anyone else don't throw them away! Just bake a little longer with the icing on.

Big hit in the neighborhood!  Every Christmas our family does something we call "spreading holiday cheer" where we take something to each of our neighbors.  I've been doing these cinnamon rolls for them for about 4 years.  They now crave them and ask me to make more!

These were unbelievable.  My kids could not get enough of them.  I used the entire box of pudding and used my break maker. They were easy and delicious.  I put mine in 2 round cake pans with 8 rolls in each. I froze them after cooking and they thawed beautifully  and were just as good after being frozen. This is a real keeper.

Pretty good recipe; I made these on Christmas Eve.  For the dough, Bread maker on Dough cycle all the way!  For the inside, I had some left over apples so skinned, cored, blended, and then created an apple cinnamon syrup.  Cut the roll with thread. I put them in the refrigerator overnight.  Pulled them out Christmas morning to get them to room temperature and baked them. For the icing, I creamed the butter with the sugar first then adding the whipped cream cheese, since I whipped it by hand. I halved the icing into two sandwich bag and added red and green food coloring, cut a small corner of the sandwich bad and piped the icing over the rolls.  Very good.  Now taking orders from my family.  One family suggestion was  a peach syrup for the next ones.

The rolls turned out very good, light and fuffy.  I did double the cinnamon mixture like suggested in previous recipes.  Was not in love with the frosting, not that it wasn't tasty, just not exactly perfect.

Absolutely fabulous recipe! The rolls came out delicious. I made the dough without the bread maker and still had great results. I also made a caramel sauce for the bottom of the pan. The cream cheese frosting is great for these rolls - I wouldn't have thought of using cream cheese. A must try!

This recipe is incredibly good! I make the dough ahead and refrigerate it overnight. I bake an extra 5-10 minutes to make sure the rolls don't come out doughy. I also include some crushed red hots in the filling with the brown sugar to add a little "extra". Very popular with my family and co-workers, and not too labor intensive.

I had high hopes for these but was disappointed.  They were dry and not very flavorful....needed more sugar and cinnamon inside.  I did use a different frosting, but the dough just wasn't my favorite.  I much prefer the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe.  But thanks for the post.

YUM! i did it a little different though. Instead of regular bread flour i used whole wheat, and in place of the sugars i used splenda! Basicly where ever you could use light products i did like the cream cheese. Still turned out fabulous! My husband who refuses to eat whole wheat, really likes these!

I can't believe I finally found the ultimate recipe for cinnamon rolls, these are wonderful!  I added just a little more butter and cinnamon to the filling as we like it a little more gooey.

We need the option for 10 stars on this one! These were AMAZING! I made the rolls just like the recipe calls for but I made a different icing for them - Hubby is not a cream cheese fan. But let me tell you....these are MONEY! Hubby said they were "professional". Gotta love that! =)

This recipe is wonderful!  I've had rave reviews from everyone who has tasted them.  I did substitute - didn't have pecans, so used walnuts, and made my own brown sugar with white sugar and molasses.  I may try adding raisins the next time I make them, and I will use pecans when I have them.

These rolls were fantastic!  The first time I made them, I didn't have vanilla pudding, so I hesitantly substituted a couple Tbsp. of lemon pudding.  We loved it!  I carried them to Sunday School for breakfast and got rave reviews!  I think I'll be making them with lemon pudding all the time. :)

Absolutely wonderful!!  I did not use a bread machine but followed the recomdations of viewers and used my Ktichenaid mixer.  I fit 15 in my 9x13 and baked the extra one in a small dish (15 just fit better in the pan) I baked for 20 minutes. I also omitted the milk from the icing recipe.  These are perhaps the best cinnamons rolls I've had.  Everyone LOVED them!  This is a keeper!  Thank you.

Made these by hand. The texture was perfectly light and fluffy, very different from the usual. They baked in exactly 20mins for me. The frosting was delicious, though I didn't need to use the milk. Wonderful recipe, will use this over and over again! This is THE recipe for cinnamon buns!

This recipe was the easiest I have ever used for making sweet and gooey cinnamon rolls. I did add more filling to the rolls for the extra gooey I like. I also added maple extract to the frosting for delicious results.

UNBELIEVABLE!  I didn't need all 16 rolls at once so after allowing to rise I stored most of the cinnamon rolls in the refridgerator. They were good for about 4 days - and gone within 4 days.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

I don't think they are like cinnabun... but everyone has their own opinion.  Easy to make.  I put the dough in a bowl, covered it with plastic wrap, filled my sink with a few inches of warm water, then placed the bowl in the sink and covered with a towel.. dough rose well.. then after rolling up buns, I put in 9x13 dish.. turned my dishwasher to the very end of the dry cycle, and put the dish in there.. it got warm, but not TOO warm.. and they fluffed up again nicely.  had to bake an extra 10 minutes though..  not sure why.. my oven is usually hotter than  everyone elses.

These were really good.  There's too much, though, to put in a 9 x 13.  I would recommend 6 each in 2 8 x 8 pans or 7 x 11 pans. You can stick one in the fridge for next morning if you want. The icing is good, but very rich.  Since my husband's not crazy about cream cheese, we just put the powdered sugar glaze drizzled on top and it was delicious.  The first thing he said was that they reminded him of the bakery style ones we used to eat at our college's coffee shop.  That's what I was hoping!  Thanks for the recipe!

Ok, so I was kinda nervous tring this recipe, not because it looked hard, just because it was my first time.. And let me tell you, I will never buy Cinnabon's again!!! I followed everything exactly, I did do as other suggested and made the day before and baked the following morning. I did make them a little bigger so it only came out to 12 rolls, but did fit perfect in my 9X13 pan, I made double the icing, which I would recommend if you have a sweet tooth, and I also think that made it taste even more like the store cinnabon's. My kids and I loved it, even my 3 yr old ate 1 whole one! I hope I don't regret liking this recipe so much, can't imagine were those extra 10 pounds are going to come from!!! LOL THANKS for a wonderful addition to our baking recipes will keep handy probably for generations to come!!

My neighbor died. I wanted to make GREAT comfort food for the family. I tried 2 times to make a basic sticky buns recipe; both times failed. Badly. Desperate, I looked up "cinnamon rolls recipe" and found this SAFE HAVEN and REFUGE.  I was seriously pleased. Although easy to impress after two bombed attempts at cinnamon rolls, I still consider myself a connoisseur.  This recipe is detailed and GOOD. I successfully made a kick-butt at-least-cheer-up-your-mouth-bereavement- batch of cinnamon rolls. They were SO good my boyfriend insisted the widower would assume they were store bought. So, I let him know "Made with love for your family, from scratch." These are quite similar to Cinnabons except that you need to triple the topping to make it like a Cinnabon. I doubled mine and it was "just" enough - but if you've had a Cinnabon you know they are swimming in that luscious creamy sauce.  If you're a minnamalist - just keep it as is. If you're decadent but not excessive, double the sauce and if you are a Cinnabon addict, triple it.

I changed the servings to 13 used the dough cycle in my bread maker. My husband couldn't believe I made them...he thought they were store bought and my oldest son said they go into my best recipe file. The only thing I did diffently was use the cream cheese frosting from the clone of cinnabon recipe on this site.

Absolutely Amazing.  I used a whole box of vanilla pudding instead of half, which made them even better!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I thought the dough was great to work with and the rolls were really soft when they came out of the oven - which they always are.  I didn't think that they were still soft the next day, however.
They're just ok for me.

A very good one! Left in the fridge overnight, baked in the morning, was a big hit at my office straight from the oven! Only, I would say the icing is way too much (you have lots of sugar inside the rolls, after all) and the cheese is DEFINITELY too much (I put around 3 oz).

Thanks so much for this recipe. These are the best cinnamon rolls ever. What I especially like about them is that they stay soft. Well at least I know that they do for about 48 hours. They have never lasted longer than that in our house.

Great recipe! I did double the filling just because we like lots of cinnamon-buttery taste. As for the negative reviews, people you can't expect to not follow the recipe and get good results. Try reading the recipe and following the steps before you blame the recipe. Most of the time unles it is a poorly written recipe it is the cook who is to blame. I think you can use different flavors of pudding and still get great results, I have used cheesecake flavor pudding and plan to try butterscotch next.

There isn't much to say beyond these being spectacular!  I followed others' suggestions and used the whole box of pudding and added a little extra filling.  I like the icing on the Clone recipe but even that I tweak a tad.  My whole family enjoys these.  Shame what they do to your waistline tho ;)

Never had cinnabons, (Im english!) but these were nice. So much better than other recipe "Clone of cinnabons".
I halved the measurements, made exactly as it says however, dough was so sticky, couldnt roll it out exactly, and overall I prefer not so obviously home-baked bread, it has a very thick, hard-ish crust!
Nothing special but I am addicted.

I don't have a bread machine either, so I mixed everything by hand and turned out onto board to knead by hand for a few minutes. I let it rise for about 30-45 minutes,kneaded again, and let it rise again. Then I followed the directions on original recipe. I used spelt flour and they came out wonderful. Much better than the expensive ones at the mall!! I had to make another batch the next day!

This was good, but not the very best I have made.  I recommend upping the cinnamon and sugar mixture and adding nuts was very good. Chopped pecans really added a gourmet touch.

These are the BEST Cinnamon Rolls ever!  My husband has been making them for awhile as a special treat for birthday and holiday breakfasts.  He made them yesterday and I decided I would finally write a review.  He does not change anything (except he leaves out the nuts -- much to my dismay). They always come out PERFECT!  YUMMY!

Heavenly! These are so light and airy! I also did not make them in a bread machine and just followd the directions other reviewers gave (thanks). I also did not have bread flour but subbed 3 C white flour and 1 C wheat. I also used granulated sugar/cinnamon mixture in the middle and just sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top. The dough is fantastic- sweet w/o being too much. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe certainly wasn't bad, I just had really high hopes for it.   It was really good but DID NOT taste like Cinnabon (the famous rolls in the mall) Maybe I just assumed that's what they were suppose to taste like.  I thought the recipe might have called for a little more cream cheese than needed but all in all it was pretty good, again just higher hopes.

WoW! I never thought that these would actually came out sooo good. Honestly. Me and hubby just devoured them and they tasted so similar to Cinnabon. For a home baked cinnamon rolls, this is darn good! I used the "Clone of a Cinnabon" frosting coz' it's da bomb diggity, and also put most of the vanilla pudding mix but not all of it. Thank you so much for the recipe. I am sooo happy with these rolls, thinking how much money we can actually save rather than buying those famous rolls at the mall.

Just made these for my daughters slumber party breakfast - they are gone!  I've been making cinnamon rolls for years, but these are by far the best.  Few changes:  used regular pudding instead of instant and omitted the nuts and added raisins instead.  Truly outstanding!  So much for my diet!!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!  These cinnamon rolls were soooooo good.  I made them for Easter brunch and they were a hit.  They were very easy to make.  The dough was perfect when it came out of the bread machine, and they were very easy to assemble.  I used dental floss to cut them.

Wonderful!  I used the full package of pudding mix and frosted my cinnamon rolls (while still warm from the oven) with a store bought cream cheese cake frosting.  I'm such a cheater...  Everyone loves these, especially my husband's coworkers (I send a pan to work with him every once in awhile).  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

These were the best cinnamon rolls I have ever tasted! My friends and boyfriend raved about these and now I am requested to make them every week. I used magarine spread for the inside of the rolls, which spread easier than stick butter.

These turned out great.  I used a good deal more than half a stick of butter on the rolled out dough and I think that made a big difference (although not a healthy one).  Oh, and I made the icing with an ounce less of cream cheese.  Wonderful!

These were wonderful. Wasn't sure if they were gonig to turn out, seeing as I wasn't sure weather or not to let the dough rise in the bread machine or not. I opted "not", but they didn't rise for me anyway. Luckly when I baked them, that is when the magic happend. Great recipe. Thanks

chalk up another 5 star rating for these!  Amazing good flavor and I feel like a baker which I know I'm not but these will make anybody think you are.  I used my kitchen aid mixer to make dough, then needed for about 8 minutes, put in fridge overnight, in the morning let them sit out for a few hours while I was gone, came back, made and baked to amazing results.  These will not last long with 5 of us.  Icing is good too, not too sweet, just right.  Just as good as the "mall" ones!

Wow, these are amazingly good.  The first time I made them I thought "I can't possibly eat all these" and brought some over to my neighbours.  After trying them I had regrets, and was given some grief from my husband, as these were so loved that he (and I) wanted the leftovers for breakfast (but there were none!).  Needless to say, I had to make them again a few days later.  Our neighbours knocked on our door about 30 minutes later RAVING about how good these are  and they thought these were AT LEAST as good as Cinnabon if not better(their son used to work for Cinnabon so they knew their stuff).  

Thanks again!

These were delicious!  I couldn't tell the difference between these and also highly rated clone of a cinnabon from this site. The pudding mix must have made the dough sweeter; I just couldn't tell when all was said and done!  Cream cheese frosting a must!

What can I say that hasn't already been raved about these cinnamon rolls???  I've never made anything so terrific in all my life, and it was SOOO easy with my bread machine.  The bread in the rolls came out moist and a bit chewy and substantial after baking (perfect for cinnamon rolls), the filling was wonderful yet simple (I left out the nuts because my Hubby doesn't like them, but it was terrific without) and the frosting was heavenly and not too sweet. Even as day-olds they were impeccable! (The recipe makes 12 LARGE rolls, and our family of 5 couldn't eat them all the first morning!) This is a definite "keeper" and probably one of those special "tradition" recipes that my family will savor time and again for years to come.  Thank you soooo much for the terrific recipe!

These rolls are wonderful!  They have an old-fashioned, comfort food sort of appeal.  I love to knead things by hand, so didn't use my bread machine, and they turned out perfect.  The icing was very nice, also.  I usually make little twitches to recipes, but would recommend making this recipe just as it appears.  I will definitely be making these rolls for years to come.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I discovered it a couple of years ago, and I apologize for not writing a review sooner.  These rolls are EXCELLENT and EASY.  I had never even considered making sweet rolls prior to finding this recipe.  Preparing the dough in the bread machine works wonderfully well and makes preparation so easy.  I have served these to many people and taken them to various places, and they have always been a hit. I think the recipe is perfect "as is."  Thanks!

Yum - soo good!  The dough was so light and simple to make with the bread machine.  I loved the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe but tried this because it's healthier for you.  Mmm - I think this is my new recipe for cinnabon!!  Deeeelish!

These were such a hit with my family.  They beg me to make them over and over again.  The frosting is truly perfect!!!  I like to bake and find these easy to do.  I usually make the dough the night before, let it rise, put in the fridge covered and then take out in the a.m. to bake when I'm good and ready!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!!!  Thank you Miss Alix for submitting it.  I have tried all kinds of doughs, and this is the only one that turns out perfect everytime.  I prefer a lighter roll, so I add 3 1/2 cups of flour instead of 4. They are also great with the caramel bottom that other reviewers submitted.  They are so easy with the bread machine and are even great the next day when you warm them for a few seconds in the microwave.

This is a great recipe.  Delicious and doesn't tire you out in the kitchen.  I even used the dough recipe (minus the pudding and a little less yeast) and added some powdered garlic to make bread machine pizza dough.

THIS IS THE BEST CINNAMON ROLLS RECIPE!  I can't believe how great these turned out!  I didn't change a thing, this recipe is perfect AS IS.  I even went back to the "clone" recipe, and tried using it's icing as others did, but I thought it was too sweet.  I enjoyed the icing for this recipe.  I also tried putting extra pudding mix as others did, and it came out too soft and mushy.  DON'T SKIP THIS RECIPE!  IF IT TURNED OUT BAD, YOU MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG!

I shouldn't give credit to this roll alone, since I combined it with the Cinnamon Roll I recipe! After trying both recipes I decided that it was better to use the recipe III, but then I added the delicious gooey sauce from recipe I to layer the bottom of the pan, flipped it, then swirled the cream cheese topping (I only used half the topping recipe) over it. I loved the sweet topping but I was afraid it would be too sweet, so I decreased the amount of brown sugar used in the filling to 3/4 cups. And I didn't use the peacan... But it was just FABULOUS!!! It does get a bit dry the next day, but I just steam it a bit and they're OK again :)

These were fantastic! This was my first attempt at making homemade cinnamon rolls, and they came out beautifully. I used nearly all of the instant pudding, and put walnuts inside instead of pecans. That's the only thing I did differently. Delicious recipe that I will definitely use again. Thanks very much!

My kids ask for cinnamon rolls every weekend and I am always trying new recipes when I'm not buying the frozen rise-and-bake ones from the grocery. I decided to try these last weekend and the were an instant hit!!  They were easy to make and better than any I've tried before. Like many others, I do not have a breadmaker, and so made the dough in my KitchenAid stand mixer. I used almost the whole box of pudding mix, I used about 2 tsps of it to add to the filling since I was a little short on the brown sugar. I also used the "Clone" icing recipe. YUMMMMM!

Took a chance and tried this recipe for the first time at a family brunch.  These disappeared fast!  I, too, used the entire box of vanilla pudding.  Made two batches.  For the first batch, melted butter in baking pan and sprinkled brown sugar/pecan mixture over melted butter before adding rolls.  This made a nice pecan topping when inverted after baking. For the second batch, just made a quick powdered sugar/milk/vanilla icing and spread liberally over the tops of rolls while warm.  (Omitted pecans from filling on this batch for those who prefer no nuts.)  Baked batches a bit longer to avoid doughy middle, but covered with foil for first 15 minutes so they would not become too brown. Very easy in the bread machine.  About to begin another batch, by popular request, for tonight!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is amazing.  I made these cinnamon rolls for our Christmas morning brunch.  They were an instant hit!  I loved how easy they were to make - I just threw all of the ingredients in the bread machine and then the family sat down to open presents.  When we were almost done I went in the kitchen to prepare them and within an hour (had to wait for them to rise) we were eating delicious rolls.  My family concurs that this recipe actually tops Cinnabon!  I used the Cinnabon Makara cinnamon, which always adds an excellent flavor - and my batch actually yielded 18 scrumptious rolls.  This is definitely going to join my recipe treasury.

Fabulous and oh so gooey.  Eat them all ASAP as they dry out quickly.  I also lower the temperature to 325 degrees and bake a bit longer (22 minutes) or the middle ones are very doughy.  My hubby loves them.

Wow...I only had butterscotch pudding mix, so used that. And omitted the frosting. These were so good even with the changes. Will definitely make again following the original recipe.

These are DELICIOUS and decadent (NOT for calorie counters).  The dough is sweet and soft, the cinnamon filling is perfect, and the icing is wonderful.  People I (reluctantly) shared these with (I wanted to eat them all myself) LOVED them and now often ask me "when are you making those cinnamon rolls again?".  These are easily equal to (if not better than) expensive Cinnabons (THIS is the closest Cinnabon recipe I've found, and I've tried a lot of cinnamon roll recipes).  One tip is to make sure you roll out the dough evenly and NOT too thick (maybe 1/4").  I will definitely make these again and again.

Real easy to make and the taste is better then store bought.  I don't have a bread machine, so I worked the dough by hand.  I prepared the dough at night and let it rise in the fridge.  In the morning, I let the dough come to room temperature and then baked it.
This recipe is really out of this world.

This is the best cinnamon roll recipe that I have ever come accross.  I used a whole box of sugar free pudding and added some rasins to the filling.  Everyone loved these.  Easy and good.  Thanks.

This recipe was off the hook!!!!! Was Soooooooo good, and easy to make. I took the brown sugar down a notch and used half as much in the middle.Like someone eles said.....I used all the pudding mix instead of half. I cheated and used store bought cream cheese frosting-which was yummy and saved me a step. Also if you don't have a bread machine-it is worth getting one now!!I used regular flour instead of bread flour and it was just as good.Was a big hit with my family! No leftovers on this one! They came out light and fluffy--not hard like I have made in the past.finally a recipe that anyone can make. These rolls are so good they will give you real rolls!  haha

Wonderful, fantastic, incredible – my first “from scratch” cinnamon roll attempt- VERY MUCH worth the work and wait. My husband isn’t a sweet lover so I went light on a few in one corner with the icing – which left the perfect amount for us icing lovers. I usually add a dash of this or that to most recipes – but this one was fabulous as is- THANK YOU!!!

My family most definitely gave this recipe a 5.9 and a half. we been making cinnamon rolls every sunday since the begining of time. For my birthday they gave me, but mostly them, the best  bread machine that that man can by. It made this a dough easy and without a problem. The rolls were made by me and my mom with the same love and labour as the old rolls, but better dough makes for a better roll

These were okay.  I don't have a bread machine and that's probably where I went wrong.  They didn't rise very well.  Then, I thought I had way too much of the brown sugar mixture so I omitted some of it, but afterwards decided I should have left it in because it kind of evaporated in baking.  They don't really taste at all like Cinnabon, even though they look nice and my family seemed to enjoy them.  I was a little disappointed.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

This was pretty good. Farily easy.. thugh I didn't read the recipe through the first time and didn't see that this required a bread machine.  I made do and guessed on how long to knead the dough with my mixer's dough hooks.  Need more of the brown sugar stuff though and a little less sugar in the frosting.. at least to my taste.

Wonderful recipe!  It's my new favorite food!  Don't have a bread machine, but used the suggestions of other reviewers.  Found the rise time was more than suggested, but it was still an AWESOME recipe.  Thanks!

Boy am I glad I don't have to hunt up a mall with a cinnamon roll shop in it anymore!  These were everything I'd hoped they'd be and everyone loved them.  Since cinnamon rolls require rise time, they were as quick as could be hoped for with a bread machine.  Thanks for coming up with and sharing this delicious recipe, Miss Alix!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!! This was so good I can't even start to describe it.  The dough came out so nice from the bread machine- I was stunned.  That I will admit took a long time and so did the 45 minutes of rise time-  but it is so WORTH IT!!!  My hubby loved it and so did my kids.  My daughter always picks at breakfast- she didn't want me to take the plate on this one.  This gets an A+.  I wish it wouldn't take so long- but it is worth it!!!!!!  JEssD

I have made this recipe a dozen times and these are hands-down the best cinnamon buns ever! To my surprise, I recently discovered that these can be made even better! I only had 2 cups of bread flour, so I added 2 cups all-purpose. These are even softer and better when I made them this way. I will continue to mix the types of flour, but as it is written, this is most definitely a 5 star recipe!

I have never writtten a review on this site before, but I feel like I need to for these cinnamon rolls. I have been making these rolls for 19 years! They are a Christmas morning tradition in our house. They do take some time, so planning ahead is key. For those of you that are worried about the time these rolls may take, here's what I do. I make these a day ahead and store them in the fridge, unbaked. The next morning, I put them in a warm oven to rise at about 200 degrees. After the rolls have risen, I bake and frost as directed. They are divine!! My family expects these every year. It wouldn't be Christmas without them!

My son is crazy about this recipe, I liked it, but was a bit to much vanilla tasting. I will tweak it to 1/4 pk of the vanilla pudding . The texture is very good and is simple to make. Will be my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls.

I do not own a bread maker so I used the dough hook on on my mixer and then followed the recipe exactly. The first time I made this recipe I put the dough in the fridge overnight before proofing it, they did not rise as much as subsequent times when I mixed, proofed, and baked them the same morning. Tasted very good, they are a go to treat for myself.

These cinnamon rolls where amazing and so delicious!  I didn't have regular instant  pudding mix so I just used sugar free instant pudding mix and it tasted fine. I also wanted to triple the batch but it didn't fit in my bread machine so I just used my mixer and then let it rise until the dough looked bigger and then I made the cinnamon rolls and then let them rise for 45 min and popped them in the oven. As for the icing i only had fat free cream cheese so i just used that, it was a little chunky but not super bad. Over all the cinnamon rolls where amazing! I even took them camping lol :)!

First time making cinnamon rolls and they came out perfect!! The only things I did differently was adding extra cinnamon and brown sugar and I used Paula Deen’s frosting recipe which is 2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 4 tablespoons of butter, and 3-6 table spoons of hot water (I only needed 2).

My first time making these and they were amazing! I brought them to work and they got devoured! The only thing I did different was double the cinnamon mixture and mixed the butter right in with the filling. Going to make them again today for Easter morning

This is my new cinnamon roll recipe. The whole time I kept thinking that my dough did not turn out well. But in reality, the Dough was beautiful and the rolls turned out gorgeous and tasted like a little piece of heaven. Everyone in my household loved them, even the baby.

These are without a doubt AMAZING! I followed the advice of other reviewers because I do not have a bread machine. I also used a whole box of pudding. AND I used all purpose flour. Thank you to all the reviewers who posted reviews with ways to make all this possible. I used another recipe for the icing, but the cinnamon rolls are definitely the best!

These turned out fantastic! My family loved them. I left out the pecans because my family doesn’t like nuts, but it didn’t matter. These are the bomb! I made the dough in my bread machine and got the cinnamon rolls all cut and ready to go on a cookie sheet, then covered and placed in the refrigerator overnight. Pulled them out in the morning and let them rise while the oven preheated. Took about 20 minutes to bake. I whipped up the icing and placed in a ziplock bag and just snipped the corner for easy spreading onto the rolls. Will be making these again! Thank you!

Really delicious recipe.  Turned out perfect my first attempt.  My only deviation was to add 2 eggs because the eggs I had on hand were a bit small.  The other adjustment was to the frosting.  I used less powdered sugar than the recipe called for.  I would suggest adding half a cup of sugar and then adding a little at a time until you find your perfect level of sweetness.

It was very tasty, but not soft like my family likes them.  The bread flour makes them sense.   Layer that day, they became hard. just substituted all purpose flour the second time I made them, and were  soft and delicious.

So delish! I added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the cinnamon as someone had suggested and they are amazing! Soft but not “undone” tasting. Struggled a little with closing once rolled up but I just went with it and didn’t worry, as this is my first attempt with cinnamon rolls ever.

These were a big hit in our house.  My hubby, who eats very healthy and doesn't even care for cinnamon rolls, had 2 or 3. It made about 16 large rolls. Requires a bit of planning, but totally worth it.  Rolled them the night before, covered with plastic in the fridge, and let them thaw and rise about an hour before baking. Will definitely make again.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! These cinnamon rolls were delicious! I was always afraid to even try making cinnamon rolls but I wanted something special to make for my wife and daughter on Christmas morning. I’m so glad I manned up and took the leap of faith. These cinnamon rolls were really easy to make. I actually made them three days ahead and froze them before giving them the opportunity to raise in the pan. I pulled them back out of the freezer after my family went to bed on Christmas Eve and let them thaw and rise at room temperature over night. I woke up early to baked and glazed them before they woke up. What a surprise! They LOVED them! I followed this recipe exactly except for the nuts, we don’t like them in baked recipes. Thanks again. You really gave this family such Joy on Christmas morning.

They did taste a lot  like Cinnabon’s! I used the whole package of pudding & left out the 1 tbsp. sugar, used 1/3 c. dry milk powder & water for the fresh milk, increased the salt to 1 tsp. and added a couple Tablespoons of dry potato flakes to make them similar to the bread machine kolaches on this site, one of my favorite recipes. I added just a tsp. or 2 more cinnamon to the filling, too. 
Thanks for the recipe!

It is absolutely delicious!! The bread itself has a nice vanilla taste that’s really quaint but scrumptious. Of course using the bread machine makes this that much easier. I would suggest making the cinnamon and brown sugar into a paste before spreading it. Just mix it all in with your softened butter, it makes less mess when rolling and helps to make sure everything doesn’t slide to the bottom of the pan while doing the second rise and baking. I’ve already made this recipe twice and it is not my staple. My family has been requesting it like crazy! Thanks for sharing

These rolls are great, but I'm not giving credit to the person who posted it here, she copied and halved the recipe from another website which was posted years before this one.

I don't have a bread maker, so.... I mixed and I knead the dough by hand and they turned out really well. Also, I made the cream icing with. Yummy.

Made it using my mixer to knead the dough. Made the suggested cream cheese frosting and it was a perfect compliment. So easy my daughter made most of it with supervision from me. Everyone loved them!

I made this recipe with no changes and it is incredible! The dough came out perfectly in my breadmaker and they rose and baked beautifully! The pudding mix kept them moist and the cinnamon ratio is perfect. My husband loved them and I will definitely make these again soon.

So easy and so fabulous!  I made a pan and then cut them into individual rolls so I could freeze and enjoy at my leisure.  Fantastic w/cream cheese frosting! Freezes quite well; reheat in microwave.

I came looking for instructions on how long to cook the cinnamon rolls that I bought in the store for. (The were frozen homemade cinnamon rolls, and there were no instructions.) I chose this recipe because it said it had the instrcutions to make the icing as well. The only problem is, the ingredients for the icing are mixed in with the ingredients for the cinnamon buns, which is very inconvenient. If there is a way to list them separately that would be much better. I will have to search for a recipe that’s just for the icing.

Tried and true. These cinnamon rolls are better than any mall cinnamon roll I’ve ever had. I accidentally bought cook and serve pudding mix instead of instant and these still came out fantastic as always.

I made this almost sugar free. My substitutes:
Sugar Free Vanilla Pudding
Splenda Brown Sugar 
and Splenda Confectioners sugar. (take Splenda, put in food processer for a few min and you have confectioners sugar.)

You will use less Splenda than regular sugar so taste testing is required. 

Great flavor, light and fluffy buns.

I’ve made the clone recipe a dozen or more times and it was good but not great. I thought it was my fault because of the 5 star rating. This recipe deserves the 5 stars!! I did add the whole box of pudding by mistake but they’re delicious so I’ll probably continue to add the whole box when I make them again and again and again.

Really good texture, I use more butter and brown sugar. Plus more butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the pan for the good gooeyness, just like Grandma taught me. She made them at least 2wicea month and usually mad e bread on Wednesdays(?) Don't know why she just did.

I'm an experienced bread baker and followed this recipe exactly.  It's easy, inexpensive and turns out big, beautiful, tender rolls every time.  My family and friends agree they are delicious and the best I've ever made.  Sometimes we ice them, but they are so good plain.

I didn't make any changes, until it wasn't seting up. Then I cranked the oven to 375 F and watched it for the next 15 minutes.  I can't recommend the low temp/freezer method since it didn't work for me. And no, I didn't put the hot cake in the freezer.  I can appreciate that it might work for this cake but it's certainly not working for everything else I have in the freezer.  In the end, the cake was pretty good (unfrosted), and it did what it was supposed to do, which was use up the bananas. There may be other recipes that are better. I can't recommend this one.

This is the best recipe ever...so moist and delicious. The pudding mix makes all the difference.  I made the dough in my bread machine.  Try making the dough in the evening, roll them out, then cover and refrigerate overnight. Take them out in the morning, allow some time to rise, then bake. Hot and yummy!

The recipe was easy enough to follow. I used my stand mixer as I don’t have the equipment the recipe calls for. I don’t have a lot of experience making cinnamon rolls so this could just be me. But my husband and I were so disappointed with this rolls. It seemed like there wasn’t enough of the sticky yummy goodness inside. I checked my recipe and I don’t see what I missed. It has to be me though because this recipe has so many good reviews.

The cinnamon roll part was really good. To let the dough rise I turned my oven to 350 degrees for ten minutes, turned it off, waited five minutes and covered the bowl with the dough in with  a dampness cotton cloth and put it in the warmed oven to let it rise for an hour.  Adding a tiny bit of oil to the bowl will keep it from sticking. Maybe I just don't like cream cheese icing, but this icing was too thick. I like it to be more thin like pillsbury cinnamon rolls' icing. I agree with other reviews.. the cream cheese is overpowering. I didn't have vanilla pudding mix, but it didn't need it. LOVE the cinnamon roll, just will keep looking for another icing recipe. One without cream cheese, or just try omitting the cream cheese from the recipe.

Greatest recipe on here. I've been making these for awhile, but this was the first time I changed recipes. Don't get turned off by the bread machine because I don't have one. I kneaded for about 45 minutes and added flour to as I went to help the rolling process. I also used a sugar icing glaze and an orange sugar glaze VS cream cheese icing. This recipe will cause you to never eat another cinnamon roll from anywhere so good luck. The rolls also took about 22-25 minutes to ensure the dough was completely cooked on the inside. This recipe is for beginners and advanced chefs!

EVERYONE loves these!  The glaze can taste a little sour due to the cream cheese but just cut back on the cream cheese and you're good to go!

I made this recipe as listed. Didn't change anything as I'm not very good at baking so I wanted to follow them exactly before making changes. My boyfriend absolutely loved these and said they're better than cinnabon. (Prob because they were made with love lol) but either way I will be making these again! Rolling out the dough and rolling it back up once filled is the hardest part (besides waiting for them to bake) I do believe you could probably slice these and freeze them before hand too! Love this recipe!

What Beautiful bread!! I don't know what the pudding does, but it Works. 
Two small tweaks: I used buttermilk and I increased the brown sugar by 1/2 cup. 
Wonderful and easy recipe

I made these a couple of months ago and my husband loved them, and he's not a cinnamon roll fan. They were delicious! I've been busy but I've been craving them so am making them again today, just waiting for them to rise the second time to pop them in oven. I use rapid rise yeast so they don't take as long, I don't have a bread machine but I have no problems using my mixer. I always get 18 rolls out of them but I probably cut them thinner than most. Am going to share them with our new neighbors that just moved in. My next batch I'm planning on making them into mini size and freezing some!

Super awesome dough, cooking didn't go as well as expected, the top browned quickly while middle was a little raw even at 325 degrees for 20 minutes. I would change temp to 300 and place tin foil on top to keep top from browning too fast.

These are absolutely the best cinnamon rolls ever! I make the dough in my bread machine and it's so easy! I do use the entire package of pudding mix, and I double the frosting recipe just to have extra if someone wants it! The icing also makes a wonderful fruit dip!!

Awesome recipe. Changes were minimal- use the whole package of instant vanilla pudding, and double the brown sugar/cinnamon filling. Also it's very helpful to use the rolling pin to push filling into dough before rolling up the dough. And use thread to cut the dough rather than a knife, results are much prettier!

Unfortunately for us, all we could taste was the chemicals in the pudding - it overwhelmed the cinnamon roll completely. They were also flatter than my regular recipe - perhaps my fault? I would not make again, sorry.

Very Good Cinnamon Rolls. 
 I dumped all of the ingredients into a mixer  like you would for a bread machine. I layered the yeast on top of the flour , then started the mixer. Let it knead the dough for like 8-10 min. then let it rise in a warmed oven for 30-40 min. Rolled them into rolls and let them rise, like the recipe says for 45 min.  

Really good.

We LOVE this recipe. The teenager in our house who eats nothing I make went back for seconds. I made these exactly as directed and it took me about 3 hours with my bread machine but it was sooooo worth the wait.

ive been using this recipe for years.  They are the bomb ! seriously.  My family loves them....they come out so soft and huge and full of flavor.  Cannot go wrong with this recipe.  Takes some patience....a lot of work......but so worth it .  Have some in the oven now.....this time I added banana cream pudding.........amazing   To those who give it a bad rating?  Learn how to cook is all I can say .  These turn out absolutely PERFECT everytime....... if their being sold at the mall..... they are the best and people who have seen and tasted these RAVE about it.......... absolutely scrumptious ! If I could give it 10 stars I would ! stop complaining people and follow the recipe.... theres always a complainer in the bunch somewhere

The recipe was easy to follow. I made the dough in my bread maker, and it came out perfect.   I actually combined the soft butter, cinnamon & brown sugar together and spread on the dough rather than sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the butter. 
The rolls were a huge hit with my family. I will definitely be making them again!!

These cinnamon rolls were fantastic.  I made them one day and put them in the refrigerator overnight  and took them out to raise the next day.  I did no nuts and they received rave reviews. They can rival any store bought ones.  Will definitely make them again.

We used quick rising  yeast and added the yeast to the melted butter,milk and sugar. Ingredients were lukewarm. Once the ingredients were mixed we followed the recipe. We didn't have a bread machine. We used the trusty Kitchen aid to mix everything. Turned out great. Rolls rose to double and baked. Will keep this recipe and use again.

Not much to add to all of these wonderful reviews!  I made two different kinds of cinnamon rolls for Christmas this year, and these were better than the other Alton Brown recipe.  I had no pudding on hand, other than a box of sugar free, and several people commented that that had an "artificial" flavor, so I didn't really want to use that.  Someone else suggested adding vanilla, but that didn't really seem like a logical substitution.  I opted to leave it out altogether, and didn't miss it - these were light and fluffy and delicious!  I might try including it the next time, just to see if I notice a difference, but if you don't have pudding mix on hand, don't worry about leaving it out completely!

My husband's family owned a diner 'back in the day' where they made their own cinnamon rolls.  After making this recipe, he couldn't believe how close these came to the good, old fashioned, cinnamon rolls.  I tested them out and will be making them for Christmas morning.  I think the icing recipe is sufficient for 2 batches -- just my opinion as we aren't into drenching our rolls in the icing.  I'd rather save the calories for another roll!!!

Excellllent.  I too, have stuck to the same recipe for over 20 years.  This one is better.  While I personally prefer my cinnamon rolls with butter dripping Down the sides  rather than a thick, cream cheese icing, my family and friends loved these, and I just left some without the icing for me.  Our next-door neighbor kid said that he could live off of them alone.  Fabulous.

I love the filling and icing it does indeed taste like cinnamon buns but only when they are still warm. When they cool they still taste good.  I did not make the dough since it requires a bread machine. The machine definitely would have made making this recipe faster.

I think I have found my "go-to" cinnamon roll recipe!  These were absolutely fantastic!  I used my bread machine's dough cycle and when I dumped the dough out of the machine -- I knew right then and there these were going to be perfect.  The dough was so easy to work with and had the perfect air bubbles in it.  I only made one small change, and it was due to personal preference, but I did not use 4 oz. of cream cheese in my icing.  I chose to only use 2 oz. as I did not want a strong cream cheese flavor to my icing.  These were wonderful.  Thank you so much!

These were pretty good. Quite good if you omit the vanilla pudding mix. I made them with and without it and without was way better. More moist and not as dry with the vanilla mix. I also added pecan meal to the cinnamon/brown sugar mix instead of any other kind of pecans. yum!

The review is on the "bread" part alone. It was OK, but we didn't care for the texture or the flavor. It was more dense than some rolls, but not as yeast-y as the more dense rolls. Not as flavorful as other recipes on this site.

The changes I made didn't impact the basic rolls. I added chopped apples the the center and caramel flavoring the the icing. That was a hit here. We also refrigerated the rolls overnight and baked in the morning. That worked wonderfully.

Followed the recipe step by step and it came out great! Instead of spreading ground cinnamon on the entire dough, I divided the dough in half and added shredded coconut on one half. And the other half with cinnamon. All the rolls came out wonderful. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I did the same as ~Marianne~ and used the traditional method.  I don't have a bread maker.  I also used chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla pudding.  They got rave reviews from my workmates and I'm excited to make them again.

I used 1 tsp salt instead of .5.  Perfect!  We've had these so many times!  Try replacing the milk in the frosting with the juice of an orange plus some zest!  Even better!

I was nervous since this was my first attempt and the yeast took a while to kick in but they turned out great! I also put half in the freezer and they bake off like a dream. This is my go-to "fancy breakfast" recipe for family and friends.

Best I've ever had! My only change was doubling the filling. I'll be making these again very soon and follow some others' advice to freeze some for later!

I have made this cinnamon roll recipe more times than I can count.  It is a favorite among my children and their friends.  One reviewer  spoke about being an experienced baker and that this recipe doesn't work.  That's just not true.  The bread machine is a tool and should be used like any other baking tool, not relied on completely to do all of the work.  I made absolutely no changes to the recipe other than time differences due to forgetting about the dough in the bread machine or making them the night before ( make sure to have a tight cover for the container).  Both of my indiscretions allowed for more rising time for the dough which just made them even fluffier.

They turned out perfect, however I agree that I prefer the recipe without the vanilla pudding in it (personal taste).

Made this delicious recipe but modified the initial method since I too, don't have a bread machine. Heck I don't even have a stand mixer! Was still relatively easy although it sounded a bit tedious when reading other tips. So I adapted the method in the beginning and then the only other changes I made were to cream the butter with the sugars and spread on the rolled dough. I also let it rise the last time on a warm stove top (oven below was 250) for approximately 2 hours! Also..I lessened the amount of cream cheese by 1 oz. In my opinion it came out just as good as Cinnabon!! The only thing is I wish they were a bit more uniform in size and round. I'm also going to try and roll the dough slightly wider (as opposed to longer) in order to get more ribbons of dough to unravel...since that's how I like to eat them!

Really Good!!!!  Made them the night before and refrigerated overnight. I set on the counter for about an hr before cooking. I'm guessing they would have rose more had I let them rise the night I mixed them?  I also had a little problem with the filling falling out when I cut them. I think maybe I didn't roll tight enough?  
I will definitely be trying them again.

Loved it so much, made it three times in a row! Will try it without the vanilla pudding next time, because it has unnatural colorants that I don't like in my food. I will try to substitute it with vanilla extract and some dry milk and see how it goes.

Great recipe. I have subbed half the bread flour for whole wheat flour and it still turns out good. Next time I will try cutting the filling in half though as they are very rich/a little too sweet for my taste.

Delicious. I've had my bread machine for over 13 years, and have been looking for the perfect cinnamon roll recipe. These are delicious. I mostly did the recipe exactly as it called for, with a couple of changes. I used the whole box of pudding. In the filling, I added 1/2 teaspoon of double strength vanilla and more cinnamon than the recipe suggested. When making the frosting, I used more butter, and 6 ounces of cream cheese. I used 1 1/4th cup of powdered sugar. I mixed the frosting until it was perfectly mixed, (about 7 minutes) in my Kitchenaide. They were fantastic, and I'm positive the y will be requested again and again.  This is the recipe I will be using.

As another person mentioned, I put in the whole packet of Jello instant pudding mix, and added 1/2tsp of powdered cloves. The whole house was full of delicious aroma of fresh baking Cinnamon rolls, good enough to wake sleeping people turned out light and airy. This recipe clearly states bread maker, not stand mixer. Everyone who tasted the rolls said this was hands down equal or even better, since it was lighter in texture.

made this yesterday! wow! only thing i added was a tsp of cornstarch to the brown sugar cinnamon mixture.. I've read online it helps keep everything from running out while baking.. seemed to work fine.. the recipe is incredible.. you wont need another one.  the vanilla pudding trick has been around for a very long time, supposedly started by a cruise ship.. they used custard powder, but vanilla or french vanilla pudding is what is easier to find.  The pudding not only helps with flavor, but helps to keep the rolls from getting stale too quickly.. ours never last long enough to try that theory out ;)

Super easy!  Christmas Morning perfection. Made them then night before warmed up easy tastes great.  I made a few adjustments. To cut the richness I went 50/50 pecans and walnuts. And doubled the cinnamon brown sugar mixture. It gave a better ratio of bread to sugary richness.     I iced it with the perfect cinnamon roll icing recipe which was perfect. It did not add to the sweetness but increased the complexity of favors. This is a new tradition at the Fiske home.

I have made these every Christmas for the past several years and have had no trouble and would rate it a SOLID FIVE STARS!! However, this year I have failed 3 times!! I am attempting the fourth try thinking I did something wrong and started reading other recipes that required more liquid than this one. After being so frustrated and perplexed, I finally realized that my computer had the recipe accurate but for whatever reason, my phone has the milk as 1 1/2 t for the dough as opposed to 1 cup of milk!! It is not the fault of the original submitter of this great recipe. It must be some really whacky glitch?? Anyway, phew! I will have yummy cinnamon rolls that we all look forward to this Christmas morning. Sorry to rate only 1 star but I want to grab the attention of anyone that might see the same error on their mobile device.

I made exactly as written. I think it would be a lot better without the vanilla pudding. It takes away from its pure, fresh baked taste. The texture of the bread was good, even though I forgot to rise the first pan the second time. The icing was okay, but the recipe needed to be doubled. I might make again but I will omit the vanilla pudding, add more cinnamon, and tweak the icing. This recipe is a good place to start but not a perfect, keeper recipe.

No vanilla pudding so I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 3/4 tsp vanilla, and an extra egg yolk.  They turned out great.

Yesterday, my daughter and I watched the genuine article being made. I have spent my life searching for the Holy Grail of cinnamon roll recipes. Okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the picture.
This recipe nails it, with one exception: upon closer inspection of the actual process, the brand name unicorn rolls use... wait for it.... margarine!  Yes, without a doubt what we saw being spread on the real McCoy was not butter, it was margarine. Also, I'd say they use at least one half cup. 
I have passed this recipe onto this households production department(my daughter). We will make it and I will update my review at that time. :-)

The bread of the roll is very good.  They were a little dry on the inside for our liking.  I will definitely try again and either double the sugar or try white sugar.

Initially, I was concerned that my grandmother and I would have trouble finishing the whole batch, but we ended up struggling to pace ourselves. I taste-tested this recipe's cream cheese topping against the Clone of a Cinnabon topping, and the latter won by a nose. Definitely make extra of the brown sugar filling. This recipe was worth it just for the way it made the house smell. So good.

I made this and everyone loved it classic cinnamon rolls. I even changed the flour to whole wheat bread flour and did not use the bread maker and it came out amazing.

In order to not use the bread maker just make sure you use the yeast as directed on the package and then give it enough time to rise.

Also put them in the oven for only 15 minutes, I put the first batch I made in for 20 minutes but 15 minutes was 10x better! Doughier and softer.

The bread portion itself is not too sweet or doughy. This recipe is absolutely defined by the frosting. I sliced them thin, put them in a 9x13 pan in the fridge overnight. Cooking in the morning they rose beautifully and completely filled the pan. The frosting is absolutely fantastic and truly defines the recipe itself.

Omg it is by far the easiest, tastiest cinnamon roll recipe I have ever made. I used ground pecans (picky kids)  that I mixed with raw organic cane sugar and cinnamon. I made small batch of frosting for kids. Hubby and I had ours without. Delicious! Thank you for posting this recipe

These were by far the best rolls I've made yet. I used an easier icing: 2cups powdered sugar, 2T soft butter, 1tsp vanilla, 1Tmilk. Made these for my daughters birthday and poured birthday sprinkles over the icing

I don't have a bread machine so I used my bread paddles on a hand mixer and though it took longer, they still came out terrific!

Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly as written except for using regular 'ol AP flour since that's what I had. Excellent rolls. I had one 9 x 13 pan of 12 good sized rolls which barely lasted a day. So simple and it easily doubles for easy prep in a kitchen aid mixer instead of bread machine.

Deserves its 5 stars. Perfect rolls. I couldn't find any vanilla pudding mix so I omitted that along with the pecans and it still came out perfect. Will definitely make again.

These where great ! Didn't need the bread machine, just kneaded by hand and let sit for 1 hour. I just let the yeast form in 110 degree water with the sugar and butter, and made the pudding, egg, milk separate, added wet into dry and it was good to go.  Great recipie will use again.

This is my go to cinnamon roll recipe.  I've been using it for years.  For the cinnamon filling I increase the butter to 1/2 cup.  Then I mix it with the brown sugar, cinnamon, and, nuts if I'm using them.  I spread this mixture on the rolled out dough.  I find it easier and less messy that spreading the butter, and then sprinkling on the other ingredients.

This is an exceptional recipe!  I did increase the butter spread to 1/2 cup and I chose to sprinkle the pecans on top of half of the baked rolls in lieu of mixing them in with the sugar.  These rolls are really, really good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, MISS ALIX!

I wanted to make this recipe right away but I only had pistachio pudding, so I tried it!  We had family visiting and you would not believe the response. Everyone loved them. They were gone so fast I only got one!  My son has bugged me to make these again, so tomorrow for the Super bowl we're having them, with pistachio pudding.  They would be really great for St. Patrick's day, they're a very pale shade of green. But the flavor, mmm. I used a whole box of the pudding and no sugar and doubled the filling. If you want to be adventurous I suppose you could try any flavor of pudding. HMMM. (I used my bread machine, so easy!)

It's easy enough to get all the other hints from the other reviews but I will say the following
*Followed this recipe to a "t" except for the whole box of pudding.
*Don't have bread machine so did all that by hand per suggestions from others
*Tried once with AP flour....FAIL!  USE BREAD FLOUR!!!!!!!  It makes all the difference.

came out pretty awesome. I'm not very good making dough by hand and I hope to get better at it as time goes by, but until then they are a hit with everyone I share them with.  Thanks :)

Delicious!  I've been looking for a cinnamon roll recipe and I've found it.  I made the dough exactly per the recipe but I did make extra filling and used my own icing recipe.  The rolls turned out perfect.  Other doughs I've tried have seemed dry or too heavy - this was perfect!  We didn't need 16 rolls so I split it into 2 pans of 8 and froze the other pan.

Super easy and super yummy.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I made my own frosting, but the base of this was great as is.  I would NOT double the filling, as it's quite enough as it is.

A KEEPER! I have made this recipe several times and each time it seem like the rolls get better and better.  The last time I made them I use more pudding mix than the receipe call for. I also divide my dough in half.  Half I made cinnamon rolls, the other half I made cresent rolls.

I don't know what happened, but these turned out very heavy for me. The rolls were almost glue-y and the cinnamon mixture hardened way too much. I've made the 'Clone of a Cinnabon' many times and thought I'd try this one (I liked the idea of the vanilla pudding mix lightening the dough a bit) but it seems I'll go back to that recipe now. Don't get me wrong, even a 'bad' cinnamon roll is still a cinnamon roll....so we will certainly finish these!  ;-)  There's just not the level of enjoyment as with the 'Clone' version. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more positive about this!

The whole family loved them. I have also made them with whole wheat flour, and they turned out well. I have tried chocolate pudding also, and they were good, but I won't do that again. I'd like to try this recipe with a butterscotch pudding!

This is the first time I have made cinnamon rolls. They were amazing! I wanted something for my children, who were home for the weekend with friends.  Everyone loved them.  I did use the whole package of pudding and omitted the nuts. I put the pan in the refrigerator overnight and set out the next morning about 45 minutes before baking. We fought over the last cinnamon roll.

As I didn't have milk in the house I decided to do something I don't often do.....try to make a recipe with a substitution BEFORE I made it according to the original directions.

So...I substituted vanilla yogurt for the milk and the pudding and hoped for the best.

dough raised perfectly!  I was shocked.  so I soldiered on thinking...okay something is going to go wrong with them in baking.   Nope!  Nothing went wrong in the baking.  The texture of them was very soft and chewy which I imagine may have something to do with the yogurt, although not sure because there are many reviews that complain about the texture who did not substitute as I did.  Either way...I prefer it this way.  I don't like dry cinnamon rolls and these definitely did not turn out dry at all...and the dough itself was not overly sweet as other reviewers have mentioned.

The only reason I am not giving it a total five stars is I think the cinnamon mixture for the inside could use some tweaking...maybe less sugar as the current ratio makes for a very sweet filling, especially since it calls for brown sugar..maybe take that down to 1/2 cup and increase the cinnamon by one more teaspoon.  

I did not add the icing to them as the filling made them sweet to begin with..and the roll itself was such a lovely softness....I did not think it was needed.

These cinnamon rolls are amazing...I put the whole package of the vanilla pudding into it...only because I don't know what I would do with half a package of pudding.  Besides that I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family love them...thank you

THis was Great! Keep in mind this is time consuming. The icing was good, but only if you like cream cheese. Next time I will use classic icing, but that is just personal preference. The flavors were very good and complex enough. Sweet, but not so overpowering so you still want to eat every bite.

These are great!  I used white chocolate pudding because I didn't have any vanilla and they were still wonderful!

Wow!! Best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. The only thing I do differently to the dough is to add the entire box of pudding so that there is no waste.  I use the icing from the "Clone of a Cinnabon" recipe on this site. I don't think there's any way a cinnamon roll could be better than this one!!

I really like this recipe, I have made it twice now. This time I used French vanilla pudding and mixed up the butter, brown sugar and cinnamon together before smearing it on the dough. I  put some of the frosting on the rolls when they came out of the oven and then the rest after they cooled.

I make this recipe frequently and share it all the time.  It is likely my favorite recipe ever and the compliments are never ending when I share the rolls.  They truly taste just like cinnabon! Per another raters suggestion, I make caramel sauce out of vanilla ice cream (the best consistency and taste for these rolls) which makes the rolls unbelievably good! These rolls are just delicious!

Amazing recipe!  I would make another half batch of the frosting to go as far as I would like and let the cut rolls sit in the fridge for at least a few hours before allowing to rise a second time, but other than that, REALLY good!

These were very nice rolls.  But there was something off about the icing.  I don't what it was, but will use another icing recipe for the future.

These were super easy! I had never made cinnamon rolls before and I was able to do it with ease. I didn't change a thing and made the recipe as written.  However I didn't care for the icing.  The cream cheese was too strong for my taste but my husband really liked it.  I will be making these again.

Good solid cinnamon roll recipes.  I would prefer more cream cheese, but, that isn't a "mall" cinnamon roll.  So...good job.

They were very tastey. Mine did not rise enough to my liking. but will add more yeast next time and more water. I also needed to bake for longer than the 15-20 min.

These were very good.  I usually make my own dough and use the Cinnabon recipe from this site for the filling.  It could just be that I made these last night and then we ate them this morning, but they didn't have any gooeyness to them, and we look forward to the gooey part.  The dough was extremely easy to work with and roll out, which I really liked.  They rose perfectly and looked amazing.  I think that next time I will let them rise overnight in the fridge and then bake them in the morning.  Will definitely try again- Thanks!

Outstanding! The only complaint I have is that I only have a few left, 3 sets of neighbors smelt them cooking!!  I subed in butterscotch pudding, I didn't have vanilla on hand.  They are very tasty, light and fluffy.  Will definitly make again.

These were good, but for some reason my cinnamon rolls weren't that sweet.  Maybe I used too much flour rolling them out.  Next time I might use powdered sugar to roll them out instead and see if that helps.  The frosting was heavenly!  These also froze well.

I have never worked with yeast before.  So I didn't prepare the yeast correctly.  Therefor mine were a little hard, but my husband liked them anyway.  I will try to prepare my yeast next time and hopefully they will be fluffier and softer.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly because I have never made anything like this before.  I am so glad this was the one I chose!  It was wonderful and easier than I thought it would be.  The only problem I had was keeping the shape...  Hopefully that will change with practice and this is the recipe i will make over and over for practice!  Thanks for sharing it with us.  This is something I hope to make my family for years.

I am only giving this 4 stars because I was expecting after all the great reviews, for it to be super great.  I love the dough and the ease of use with the bread machine, however, there wasn't enough cinnamon sugar mixtures inside.  I wanted super gooey cinnamon goodness inside. But I did love the cream cheese frosting.

OMG!!  These are sooooo good.  I made them for my husband and son on Valentines Day for a special breakfast and they were absolutely wonderful.  Not sure if it is the pudding or not, but these were so moist.  Thank you much for sharing this recipe.  Can't wait to make again  :)

I usually make carmel rolls but my family asked me if I could make Cinnamon Rolls with a cream cheese frosting. I found this recipe and tried it out. WOW the family loves them. If it were up to them I would be making them every Saturday morning, but they are not weight watchers friendly. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were so delicious and gooey!  This was one of my first forays into the world of baking with yeast and I was surprised at how good these came out.  I used others' tips from the comments on how to make these without a bread machine.

I just made these today and had to hide them from myself.  I can't believe how good they are and that I actually made something this good.  I also added the whole box of pudding. Will make again.

We love these cinnamon rolls very easy to make! My kids are not to much into the cream cheese so I used 1/3 less fat and used 6oz. instead of the 8oz. it calls for and kept everything else the same. Great on the weekends!

These were very good and easy.  I made them and put them in the fridge and then brought them out and baked them Christmas morn.  Didn't think they tasted like the mall ones, but still very good.  I got lots of compliments on them.

Hands down an excellent recipe!!  I just doubled the amount of filling.  I also didn't have a bread maker so just mixed the yeast and warm water with pinch of sugar.  Let the yeast become active and then mixed all ingredients together.  Then followed the recipie.  Thanks for this excellent recipe Ms. Alix

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  You made me look like a baking goddess.  This was my first time ever making cinnamon rolls from scratch and they were easy enough (thanks to the bread maker making the dough) and they turned out great!  The only variation I did was made one batch with and one batch without Pecans.  Thank you again!

My whole family loved this recipe. Instead of using this frosting I made a cream cheese frosting which made it taste just like the mall cinnamon rolls. They do not keep very long so make just as many as you need becuase the dough will dry out a little.

This is by far the easiest recipe and to top it off a hit. I make it about once a month. I bring it to potlucks, or make them for the kids as a treat. Anytime I bring them to anyone they want the recipe. Make these and you won't be disappointed!

I made the dough last night and put it in the refrigerator over night.  When it came to the spice in the brown sugar mix I used 2 tsp Pumpkin Pie Spice and 2 tsp Cinnamon, WOW these are without a doubt the best Cinnamon Rolls I have ever made!

I made this yesterday, it was absolutely delicious, and awesome. I followed everything as directed expected for the icing because it seemed to rich and adjusted the sugar to be on the safe side.  I used half cup of brown sugar insted of 1 cup. So i used vanilla icing from this site. I made two batches at home one with walnuts and another with raisians my parents and grandparents loved it. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe. I am going to make it for Thanksgiving.

This was pretty easy to make and I don't have a bread machine. The dough was nice to work with, I did add about 1 cup of flour as I was kneading the dough. The taste is a little bland to me but that may be because I used buttersotch pudding mix because that is all I had. I put choc. buttercream frosting on the top and they taste great like that but without any icing they are bland.

We're Canadians living in the Uk and sometimes miss food that we grew up with so to find this recipe was so nice!! There is a Cinnabon and a Cinnzeo here but not anywhere near us. I don't have a bread machine but made them in my Artisan mixer. The first time I made this I didn't adjust any amounts which you have to do here. (My recipes from Canada are from Alberta which is above sea level,  here we are below) So, it didn't rise properly as I didn't use enough yeast.  The second time they turned out fantastic - I put in 10 grams of yeast.  I'm going to try 12 next time just to experiment.  The cream cheese icing was just as good as Cinnzeo.  Friends from here love them too!!

This recipe turned out absolutely great!  I just dumped everything into my stand mixer.  I used instant yeast and put it in last.  Turned it on and when it was finished mixing, I just let the dough rise and then do your thing with them.  The more brown sugar you add with your filling the better.  I have made these three times now since finding this recipe and they have never once failed!  I always cook mine in a buttered glass dish for 20 minutes and they are always perfectly done!  This is a keeper!

these are delicious...We've made them 3 times now.  We were camping last week in the Black Hills and my husband made the dough and let them sit in teh cooler with ice for 24 hours before we made them in the camp stove and they were even perfect then too!  Great Recipe.

Just made these this morning and they are wonderful.  Mixing in the bread machine is the way to go!  I melted the butter for the filling and mixed it all together before spreading it on.  Very, very good cinnamon rolls!

Wonderful flavor, I just can't seem to get the hang of making breads!  Water is too hot, water is too cold, takes forever to rise...you name it I did it ha.  When I get the hang of they will be much prettier. Only problem was time.  Be sure you set plenty of time aside to make these yummy treats

Excellent roll.  The bread is moist and very good.  I added the other half of the pudding mix to my frosting just to use it up.  It really added flavor and help to thicken it.  I will definately keep this recipe and use it again and again and again...

These were great! My husband couldn't stop eating them. Instead of just using one 9x13 pan, I used two of them and they fluffed out to fill the glass pans. I didn't add all of the brown sugar and cinnamon because it seemed like a lot but noticed that once cooked the sugar  blended in and could have used all of it afterall. I didn't add the pecans and they still came out delicious! I made the savory cinnamon rolls recipe from this site a couple of weeks ago and this recipe was by far better. The dough wasn't as sticky like the other recipe. I'm glad I've found a Great cinnamon roll recipe finally!

Hard to say enough about this recipe! I have to stop myself from making them every week, lest I gain 300lbs. The last time I made this, I put a glaze on them rather than the cream cheese frosting, and they were equally delicious if nor more so. Thank you SO much for this great recipe!

These would have been fabulous if they didn't burn! I cooked them for the 20 min. the recipe said & they totally got burned. I cooked the second batch for 10 min. & they were perfect. I am a little frustrated since I spent all morning making these & now I only have about 6 cinnamon rolls that even taste good. Oh well...lesson learned. The dough was easy to make & everything & they taste good but mine didn't rise huge like I expected so I'm wondering if something went wrong with the yeast foaming up to begin with. Hopefully next time will be much more successful.

Very good.  I made them three times within one week.  One for our house, once for church and once for my parents.  Everyone loved them.  If you do have a bread maker, it makes the process so easy.  The hard part is just waiting during the rising time.

These cinnamon rolls were fabulous! The only thing I did different was use French Vanilla pudding mix since it was what I found in the cupboard.   This was the first time I had ever made cinnamon rolls from scratch. We have cinnamon rolls every year for Christmas breakfast, and I usually buy the canned ones. Not this year though. We've been reading labels for the last 6 months or so and the canned ones have corn syrup, so they dropped off our list. But we still had to have the cinnamon rolls and this recipe proved to be a 1000 times better than the canned. I will be making these for Christmas breakfast from now on.

Wow i'm surprised nobody had any queries abt this recipe but all praises!I dont really understand the part about kneading into a ball. My mixture forever stays gooey!  Also, my yeast packet says knead for 15 mins, but some recipe doesnt say knead at all! just mix.. this so confusing. And my third try making cinnamon rolls now.

Super Duper easy.  Made them twice in a week, for company.  I got lots and lots of compliments on my super cooking talents. People were even "fighting over them" and "stealing them".  Thank you for making me famous with my extended family!

OMG! I cannot believe I made these delicious cinnamon rolls! I have personally never had a Cinnabon, but these taste like something straight from a high-end coffee shop or bakery. I was so proud to serve these. My family cannot stay out of them. I followed the recipe to a "T" and they came out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was only my second time making cinnamon buns and these ones turned out way better than the others. I think they were good but not something to be amazed by. I've tasted way better. Also, the dental floss thing didn't work for me (maybe it wasn't sharp enough :P) but a knife worked perfectly

The cinnamon rolls were really good. Loved them!  The cheese taste in the frosting was a little strong, although I normally like cream cheese frosting.  I am going to make it again with a little less cream cheese.  Otherwise, great recipe.

I have been making bread by hand for years but the dough setting on my wifes machine works fine for this recipe.
After 2 times the only thing that SHOULD be changed is the 9x13 pan,as stated after 2 times the center needs more room to expand. Put 12 in 9x13 4 separete or arrange with room to expand

Yum.  Everyone loved these.  I don't have a bread machine so I made these by hand.  I made them the night before and refridgerated the made rolls.  I though they might take 2 hours or so to rise on a heated oven before baking from the fridge but they took more like 3 and I might give them a little more next time.

Fabulous recipe!!  I was able to make this sugar free (except for the 1 Tbsp sugar) for my boyfriend who doesn't eat sugar.  I replaced the pudding with sugar-free and used stevia in place of brown sugar for the filling.  For the frosting I used cream cheese, some milk and more sugar-free vanilla pudding.  I loved the cinnamon rolls, but had mixed feelings about the frosting.  He loved it all!  Yum!

This recipe was easy and yummy. The dough was easy to work with and raised perfectly. I added a 1/4 cup less sugar and 1 T less cinnamon for the filling. Everyone in the house loved them even Spanky our Jack Russell who stole some from our daughter Chelle!

I thought these were good, but mine also turned out dry. They were actually better  the next day.  That could be from the high altitude (6000 ft) though.  The frosting is really good.  I didn't use the bread machine, and these were easy.  I don't know what the extra "work" is people are talking about - these are homemade, and pretty simple at that! Update: Go buy the book "Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day" and make this recipe using the (no knead) challah dough from the book!  AMAZING!!

This recipe was awesome. I added to tablespoons of baking cocoa to the brown sugar-nut mixture and it turned out great. They didn't last the night, they went so fast... Thanks for the great recipe!

The icing is definitely spot on, but the roll itself is just okay.  The texture of the cinnamon roll is really different; Not like bread really at all, like cinnamon rolls are supposed to be, but more like a bread/cake mixture. 
I will stick to my mother's recipe, and maybe make this glaze to go with them when a "Cinnabon" is sounding good.  (It's the icing is what makes Cinnabon stand out from others anyway.)

Very easy and tasty cinnamon rolls.  I was very worried about the filling, it was a different way of doing it for me, I usually brush with butter than sprinkle sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I had tons of the filling ooze out everywhere.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 18 minutes in two 9" round pans instead of the muffin tins due to the size, I must've cut them too large.  The dough rolled out beautifully, very easy and smooth.  Thanks for the recipe!

TEN STARS!!  These rolls are really good.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and made a "butter whip" by mixing the butter, sugar and cinnamon and put it ontop of the rolls.  Thanks!

I have made this recipe many times. I usually make them around the Christmas holidays, for my kids teachers and my wife's boss. They are are big hit. I have even tried using cooked apples the middle. The only difference in the way I make them is that I leave them in the rolled form and slice them. I grew up having rolls made that way, so that is the way I like them. Another thing that makes these rolls different is using the cream cheese in the icing. Everyone I have made them for said they really like the icing because its not to sweet.

These are TO DIE FOR!! I even made them with whole wheat flour trying to make them a little healthier and they turned out great.  I also don't have a bread maker (got rid of it after all my loafs came out miniature) so I just made it in my KitchenAid and let them double in size.  If summer wasn't coming I would probably make these once a week (our pan disappears in one day) but for now I have banded them as we are trying to lose our winter fat storage.

A good roll that my family enjoyed overall.  I used butterscotch pudding in place of the vanilla, which worked out well.  I have made various different recipes for cinnamon rolls, and have to say that the dough was VERY easy to work with out of the bread machine!

Yummy!  Loved them.  My first time doing cinnamon rolls and they turned out great.  I would undercook them just a little next time.  We like ours gooy.  I did double the frosting and the filling.  Didn't use all the filling but it was nice to put in a little extra!

Wonderful and perfect cinnamon rolls.  I didn't know that homemade cinnamon rolls could be so easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  My wife made them several times during Christmas.  I do believe they are responsible for about 5 of the 10 lbs I gained.

THE BEST!  We love this recipe.  Do not forget the pudding, it is what keeps the dough soft long after it's been baked.  I even made some for Farmer's Market and customers came back to tell me it was one of the best rolls they have ever bought at a market before.  I love the ease of the breadmachine and while I was skeptical over all the cinnamon (I am not a cinnabon fan!) I felt it was a great amount for the recipe... not too much to leave the flavor rather bitey, but enough to give it a good flavor.  Dh loves the recipe and everyone we share it with... loves it as well.

I made this for our Christmas morning breakfast and my entire family loved it.  I took other reviewers advice and used the entire box of pudding.  I don't have a bread machine but it was easy enough to mix up in the KA.  I also made these the day before and let sit in the refrigerator for the night.  They came out heavenly!

I made these for Christmas morning.  Overall, they were very good!  But, I made some changes.  I followed some of the other tips:  I used a whole box of pudding and I increased the filling. The dough was so easy to work with!!!  I loved that!!   Also, I made the night before and put in the fridge.  I had a hard time getting the rolls to rise the next morning.  But, I finally just went ahead and baked them because my family was starving!!  I will allow more rise time next time!  Also, I baked at 325 for 20 minutes.    I gave this recipe 4 stars because my family DID NOT like the frosting!  I made the cream cheese frosting and I made a vanilla frosting.  I put both out so everyone could choose their own.  Nobody ate the cream cheese.  I ended up throwing it all away.  But, my family is not into cream cheese.  If you love cream cheese it would be okay.     Actually, after I made 2 frostings.......my family's favorite was to just drizzle melted butter over the top of them!  Next time I won't go to the work to make the frosting!! Go into this recipe knowing that these are very time consuming to make, though!!  But, in my experience ALL good cinnamon rolls are time cosuming!  But it is worth the extra effort for special occasions!  This is a great base recipe.  I am going to stick with it and continue to tweak it to make it the perfect recipe for my family's taste buds!

These were the best cinnamon rolls i have ever had in my life.  they came out perfect in all ways.  the only thing i might do differently is not cook them the full 20 minutes, just a dash less, maybe 18.  They did not last 15 hours at my house

LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! I don't think you ever love this recipe more than the very first time you make it. People think I am a baking guru now. Very delicious and the dough is  joy to work with and smell. If they could bottle this scent they could make millions.

Oh My Gosh!  These are heavenly!  And, they couldn't be any easier to make.  Take it from me, a first time cinnamon roll maker!   Until now, I've always had major anxiety about working with a yeast dough and having to roll it out. This recipe made it all so simple. It came together beautifully. These received rave reviews, so they're definitely on the list to be made again.  Thank you so much for posting the recipe!

made this for the first time last night. bread flour had a bit of too much bread taste.  I think I will stick to all purpose next time and add glutin.  The frosting was a bit bitter from the cream cheese...next time I will leave the cheese out .

The freaking beast ever!!  I made these while company was over this weekend and with in 30min of taking them out of the oven they were gone.  I got one bite of 1 of the rolls.  I have already gotten requests for 5 dozen of them.  I have not told anyone where I got the recipe I think I am going to keep it secret for a while!

If you follow it exactly, it'll turn out perfect. Everyone has been asking for this recipe. I am so glad i came across this recipe when i was younger. The only change I made is putting abit more sugar and a teaspoon Vanilla Extract instead of Vanilla pudding mix, i didn't have it.

The dough for these rolls, I make in the bread machine and turns out perfect everytime and is the easiest bread dough I have ever worked with.  Sometimes instead of making the cinnamon rolls, I use the dough to make sticky buns.  Delicious!

YUM!  These are great, super simple to make and the taste is wonderful.  I made these the day before for our cub scout family camp and we brought them for breakfast the next morning, needless to say there were none left.  One taste and we devoured them all.  I did double the amount of filling as some reviews suggested and they turned out great.  These have become a new family favorite!

If I could give 10 Stars on this I would! I just had some cinnamon rolls from Shipshewanna and these are just as good - if not better. I can't rave enough about them. I took a chance and made them for vacation with some friends. They loved them and so did we. There were no leftovers to bring home. I bought more ingredients to make them again. Is there any way to lessen the calories(!) in these things?

Really easy to make. These are by far the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had. That includes cinnabon from the mall.  I eat them warm right out of the oven. I didn't change a thing from the recipe except that I used the dough setting on my bread machine to make the the dough.  Everyone that eats these rolls will absolutely love them.

I made these for Easter brunch and they were quick and easy. I too made them the night before, and then popped them in the oven while making the frosting the next morning.

While following the recipe exactly, I found them to be on the dry side. But aside from that minor detraction, these were a hit and I will be making them again.

This was surprisingly a lot easier to make than I thought it would be.  The dough was easy to work with, and they taste really yummy!  A definate keeper.

I made this recipe exactly as it said and it turned out great. I ended up with 3 rows of 5 rolls in my pan. I did not use a bread machine either. It was fabulous. I will be putting this one in my recipe book.

This is excellent!  Definitely a smaller version of my "guilty pleasure" cinnamon roll treats that I indulge in when I fly.  Dare I say - better than my mom's!  Thanks!

These cinnamon rolls were excellent.  The dough was perfection and I will likely use it from now on when I make cinnamon rolls.  However, as several other reviewers noted, the insides of the rolls were just not quite right.  They were good, but I like mine sweeter and gooier.  I followed the directions exactly and just didn't achieve perfection with this recipe.  It's still excellent and I'll use the dough portion again, though.

As per Christmas tradition, I made cinnamon rolls for breakfast. These were super easy and tasted awesome. They were soft and chewy and had the right amount of cinnamon and brown sugar and nuts (I used pecans). The frosting was more than enough to cover the rolls, and I had about 1/2 cup left over. What else can I say? These were super.

This recipe is fantastic. I didn't use the bread machine idea and they were fantastic. The frosting is good and adds the "goo" I need in cinnamon rolls. I wish I could rate this a 10-star recipe... Miss Alix, you have really outdone all the other rolls I have tried!

These are fabulous rolls!  I just wish they were more gooey inside the roll layers, like Cinnabon.  I tried adding a more brown sugar and butter and put more sugar-butter mix on the roll, and I think it helped a bit, but not as gooey as I wanted them to be.  Vanilla pudding in this recipe is the trick!

Oh wow.  Soft, tender, HUGE.  The icing is lovely.   I made a few substitutions--white sugar for some of the brown sugar, no nuts--but it would be hard to ruin this recipe!  Enjoy!

My first time ever making cinnamon rolls.  WOW!  They were awesome. I did not use the nuts because my hubby doesn't like them.  I also did not pour the icing all over the cinnamon rolls.  I only put it on each individual cinnamon roll when it was time to eat them so it didn't make them soggy.  I stuck them in a freezer bag when I was done and they stayed fresh all week!  My husband asked me to make them again this weekend. Looks like I have a new chore...luckily it is a YUMMY one!

I've never worked with dough before.  I used the bread machine and put it on the pizza dough setting.  Not sure if I should have used the plain dough setting.  Then I would have had to specify 1,1.5,2 lbs. ??  I used all the pudding mix.  I know I goofed up, they a little goey.  I asked my husband to rate it on a 10 scale and he gave it a 10.  He thought they were AWESOME.   Thanks!

I didn't have any vanilla pudding, so I used Orange Creme Instant pudding.  It was absolutely wonderful!  My family of 6 loved them coming out of the oven, but after they cooled off, the icing didn't appeal to them.  The bread and filling were awesome, but I'll be looking for another topping.  Great recipe!

These cinnamon rolls as good or better (because you can make them for less than half the cost of the mall rolls). Everytime I make them I blink and they are gone.  My mother who is a baker absolutely loves them.

This is AWESOME!!! The only thing was my rolls did not rise, but it was still very good. My family wants them all the time now. I did use the whole pkg. of pudding and add the vanilla and cinnamon like the others did.

This is THE MOST AWESOME cinnamon roll recipe ever!  I brought them to a new years day brunch and everyone raved about them!  I took the advice of others and used the whole box of pudding mix.  I thought one recipe of the frosting was plenty, I had lots left over.  Thanks, this recipe ROCKS!

I wanted to save time so I used frozen bread dough; however, I forgot that after the bread dough thaws, it needs another 4 hours to rise. Needless to say, we ate cinnamon rolls a day and 1/2 later than intended. The filling and frosting DO really taste exactly like the rolls at the mall though! I will definately make these again (note: very, very sweet) using the bread recipe provided.  These will impress your guests!!

OMG!! Yum!! I made these on Christmas morning and they were a huge hit!  My picky two year old ate them up and asked for more. I did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup of butter and the entire box of pudding. I will definitely be saving this one. Thanks Miss Alix, these are THE BEST!!

These were fantastic!!! I, like many others, made the dough by hand, and I doubled the recipe. They were gone before I knew it ! It was an instant favorite and immediately got filed away as such. Thank you for sharing it!

This is a GREAT recipie!!! I used my bread machine and it made it sooo easy.  They were all gone in about 5 minutes, everybody in my family loved them so much.  They taste just like the ones in the mall but I made them smaller and got 24 rolls out of this recipie.

The dough barely rose and the bread was "heavy" and dry-tasting.  The frosting didn't taste bad, but there was a bit too much.  Definitely not a recipe we'll attempt to make again.

I've used a lot of different recipes for cinnamon rolls, but this is by far the best one yet.  The bread is slightly sweetened and flavored nicely by the pudding.  The rolls in general are moist and delicious.  We were generous when putting the frosting on, and still had some left, so I think the frosting recipe could easily be halved.

These were ok, definitely not the best ever.  I have a sweet tooth, so it needed more cinnamon and sugar, and they were a bit dry.  Easy enough to make though.

Oh my goodness!  My family are raving about these cinnamon rolls.  I took others advice and added all the vanilla pudding with a half cup of butter instead of the 1/4 cup.  Then I used the frosting from the clone of the cinnabon recipe.  Very excellent.  I will use this recipe for years to come.

These were a big hit.  Very easy with the bread machine, and an easy dough to work with.  I am not not really fond of the cream cheese icing, I prefer just a simple glaze. Thank you.

These were horribly sweet. Even my 10 yr old son told me they were too sweet, and he loves sweets! So for him to say that, and I did agree that they were way too sweet as well. I followed the recipe completely.

My sister and I have a tradition of making cinnamon rolls.  We have tried so many recipes with good results.  We recently got together and made this recipe and couldn't believe how awesome these rolls are!  They are so good and the dough is so soft and bakes up wonderfully! We added all the instand pudding to the mix.  Our families loved them and the pan was gone in no time.  We will NEVER try another recipe again!

Pretty good.  I accidentally grabbed a box of banana flavored pudding and didn't realize it.  They had an interesting and subtle banana flavor.  Next time I'll make sure I add vanilla!

This recipe is a total sugar shock.  It was too rich to enjoy...one bite is more than enough. I was a bit disappointed with these, especially after all the reviews! They were not that spectacular. And DEFINITELY not good reheated! I made them twice...the bread machine did most of the work. They didn't rise as big as I thought and the bottoms where mushy. For me, it wasn't worth it. I'll stick to the supermarket canned rolls.

I don't see what the "hoop-la" is about this recipie.  I thought the dough was a bit dry, and pretty bland.  They looked good, but were extremely heavy and hard on the stomach and way way too overpowering sweet-wise.  I've had better, and next time I'll resort to the pop-n-bake in the butter section of my grocer.

Very good and easy, my 3yr old helped (eat the sugar!) and they turned out well.  I will try it with some whole wheat flour so I don't feel quite so guilty eating four in a row!

Perfection! My boyfriend and I decided to make these together, since we both love Cinnabons but not high price tag. We had no bread machine, so we had to improvise by kneading the dough ourselves. We used the icing from Cinnabon clone, and the result was amazing. Both agreed it was BETTER than Cinnabon, especially since we're more generous with the icing. Although the project took us a lot of time, the result was worth all the work.

Wow this was awesome, I would have to say this is almost as good as cinnabon at the mall.  I cook mine for 17 min and they were a little crispy so next time I'll cook them for 15 min.  But great recipe Thanks!!

These were really good.  I used almond flavoring in the icing which was a nice surprise.  Very good, will use again and again.

Loved It!  I wanted to lighten the recipe so I used Land O Lakes Light butter (the first time I've ever tried this product) & egg beaters with great success.  I also used the cinnabon clone frosting and considered using light cream cheese but decided since the frosting is such a big flavor element and only 3 oz. was needed, the fat & calorie savings weren't worth the sacrifice.

Amazing good! These rolls are a real treat. The only thing I will change in the future is to reduce the amount of cinnamon to the half. Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

My husband had been out of work for several weeks and I wanted to make him a special treat to lift his spirits.  While he was away for a few hours helping a neighbor, I made these incredibly mouth watering rolls.  When he returned home I had one in hand and held it for him to take a bite.  After he tried it, he closed his eyes and savored the flavors and delicateness of the bread, when suddenly his eyes flew wide open and with a look of total panic he blurted out "Vickie!  We can't afford luxories like this right now.  I know you wanted to do something nice for me,  but until I'm working again please don't go to the mall and buy these.  I'll be satisfied with homemade ones for now".  It took about 3 minutes to truelly convince him that these were NOT made by that famous mall cinnamon roll store!  That was the "proof in the pudding" as they say of how perfect this recipe is!

One word..... YUMMY!  These are sooooo good.  So far I am the only one to try them, and I am not sure if I want to let my family in on them or save them all for me ;)

Excellent!!  This is the first time I have made cinnamon rolls and they turned out great.  Not to mention that they were simple to make.  The only change I made was using the full box of pudding as was suggested in other reviews.  I made them last night and they are just as moist and delecious this morning.  The recipe is a keepter.

I liked using my bread machine to make the dough part of the recipe but I found the rolls to be very dry tasting.  I did not like the frosting. It was too sweet.

Delicious.  I don't have a bread machine so I mixed these in a food processor and let the dough rise for an hour and a half.  I used traditional yeast, used warm water in place of milk (we were out) and left out the nuts.  I used more sugar in the icing to thicken it up a bit.

These are incredible!  They are so good and very easy to make.  They are even good the next day.  I left out the pecans because we don't care for nuts.  At first it looked like there wouldn't be enough icing but there was plenty.  I will never use store bought again.  Wonderful!

These were very easy and very good.  I made them the night before for Sunday breakfast and everyone liked them.  I would probably add a little more filling but all in all, they taste great.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

These were excellent!! I used the whole package of vanilla pudding like others suggested and I used the cinnabon clone recipe for the icing. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks!

I was so excited to find this recipe and try cinnamon roll with a pudding mix, but I tried the whole thing twice and the outcome was dry cinnamon rolls both times. The first time I thought I had overcooked them so the next time a barely browned them, and still dry.  I'll probably try it one more time, because I really want those mall cinnamon rolls!

These were pretty good...I don't have a bread machine and I think that's where I may have partially gone wrong - the dough didn't rise too well.  Unlike some others, I really loved the cream cheese icing - I doubled that so each roll would have plenty!  The rolls still tasted great, just not how I expected.

i thought i already had an awesome cin. roll recipe.  i tried this one for fun becuase it has less butter.  These are amazing.  dough is so tender and good. i can eat the whole pan myself.
