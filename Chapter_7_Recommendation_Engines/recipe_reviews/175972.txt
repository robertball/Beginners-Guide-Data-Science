Living in the Northwest and both my boyfriend and I being avid salmon fishermen we have it a couple times a week.  This dish is a new addition to our small list of go to recipes.  It's wonderfully light and filling!  Added a layer of spinach as well which created a bit of juice so it almost poached but it was still incredible.  Looking forward to experimenting with this one....  Thank you!

Very good flavor-nice and simple recipe.  I used skinless salmon filets and they were very good.  I served this with the Elegant Orzo and Wilted Spinach recipe from this site, which made for a nice meal.

This was an awesome salmon recipe.  I just wish I could get the olives for cheaper, they really made the dish but were too expensive.

My husband made this for me last week.  Absolutely fabulous and so easy!  We'll make this often. It is far better than most salmon entres I've had at high end restaurants.

Very easy to make salmon bursting with flavor. I generally increase the amounts used for the topping, as I like my salmon fairly loaded. I also put extra feta cheese as that's what adds some salt to the dish, making the flavors stand out better.

This was rather bland and the flavors did not meld together very well.  A good idea but not as flavorful as we would have preferred.

Fantastic recipe! My only additions were garlic and onion powders and black pepper. Between the evoo and the juices from the fish and the tomatoes, a nice little sauce formed that kept the fish really moist and flavorful. Thank you Cathappy!

So easy and elegant, too!  Delicious smell while cooking, serves up nice over rice with a side of spinach.  Definitely will make again!  Even my 7-year old liked it!

This was great.  I left out the red onion and diced yellow onion and green pepper.  I found I had to cook it about 30 minutes.

This was very good.  I did sprinkle the salmon with some Greek Seasoning before topping with the vegetables.  I also added some leftover asparagus to the vegetable mixture.  Will definitely make this again.

I love dishes that are easy to prepare and this one definitely fits the bill. Overall, I thought it was good, but didn't think the flavors were integrated very well.. maybe I did something wrong, but to me I felt like I had two separate dishes -- some Greek style toppings and some baked salmon. Both of which tasted good, but not special together.  However, I did have a leftover piece of salmon with toppings which I used in a salad the next day and I thought that was really delicious -- so I will be making this again for the leftovers!  To the reviewer who mentioned the cost of Kalmata olives, you may want to see if you have supermarket with an olive bar nearby so you can just buy the few olives you needed and not a huge jar.

Made this last night and my husband said to make sure I make it again!  Lots of mmming going on at the table.  I didn't have any red onion or the olives but I did have sun-dried tomato and basil feta cheese.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled Greek seasoning on to the salmon before adding the tomatoes.  Next time I'll try it with all the ingredients.

Excellent. I had some black olives that needed to be used up, so I used those instead of Kalamatas. I did lightly season the salmon before topping. This was light and delicious. Thank you :)

Thanks you cathappy for posting your recipe,... Yum!
...following others suggestions and my own...1. Added an extra small can of diced tomatoes (28 oz would save time cutting up a fresh tomato) 2. Some garlic 3. Spinach. While waiting for it to cook... For plate presentation and for the shear fact I love spinach, I made a bed of lettuce.  When cooked I took off the icky back side of the fish then  I scooped up  the other ingredients on top, using a measuring cup.     ( and to control the amount of liquid to be served)... Added a fresh sprinkling of feta cheese, because I love that too....it became more of a lovely yummy Greek - style baked salad. I definitely saved this in my all recipes box.

Very good recipe.  We had large salmon fillets, so 20 minutes was not enough time to cook all the way through, but overall it was yummy.

Thanks for a lovely take on salmon.  Have used this recipe for halibut and haddock but it is just as great with salmon.  Thanks for adding another recipe for salmon to my files.

THIS WAS AWESOME - soooo good - but put parchment paper down in you glass dish otherwisie you have to do a lot of soaking and scubbing - use small vine tomatoes and go to the olive bar at the grocery store to save money on the olives - Delish Delish and the leftovers on a salad to take to work for lunch even better

This was a surprisingly great combo and the salmon came out perfect.  It was not overcooked which I was fearful about.  I did not use fresh basil bc didn't have but dried seemed ok.  All else was according to the recipe.  What we enjoy doing is taking this once it's baked, breaking it up and adding it to a premixed caesar salad.   Great this time of year - light and cool and easy.

OK I was very skeptical about Greek salad salmon... This proved me SO wrong. Totally delicious. Every bit a "company" dish. Very easy and so tasty.  Thanks for a great addition to our healthy eating plan. We will have this often and I plan to serve to friends as well.

Whenever I cook with salmon, I am always looking for something different. I always think that salmon on its own can be boring, so when I saw this recipe I was instantly taken by it. It has all the ingredients of a classic Greek salad and when baked together, they blend perfectly to create a very interesting and flavourful dish. I served this over reggae rice, which is white rice cooked, rinsed, drained and combined with diced mixed sweet peppers and onion which have been quickly sautéed for 3 to 4 minutes. It’s a wonderful dish and healthy too with all the benefits derived from Omega 3 fatty acids in the salmon. This will be one of my regular go to dishes.

This was a fabulous dish!  I made it just as written but like the others' ideas of adding spinach or orzo.  Quick, easy, and tastes like you are eating in a fine restaurant!  I served it with brown rice.  We will definitely have this again!!

Very good recipe. It took a bit longer to cook then 20 minutes, but not much. Great Greek style salmon - the basil, tomato, feta cheese and olives added a lot. Highly recommended for a relatively quick meal.

Absolutely delicious! I added salt and pepper, extra lemon juice, and needed to cook it for about 20 minutes longer. I put it over fresh spinach as a salad and it was perfect!

This recipe is worth the effort and definitely one I would serve to company.  Use fresh topping ingredients, especially basil and ripe tomatoes because all of the flavor comes from the topping.  We will definitely have again.

So easy even I couldnt mess it up.  I did have to cook it longer than 20 min.  Maybe my salmon was thick or my oven cool but it was no problem.  Delicious!!

I will make this again. So moist. I usually don't like red onions, but they were perfect here. Since other people said it was bland I sprinkled a PINCH of William Sonoma Potlatch seasoning right on the Salmon added a tablespoonful of my favorite Mrs Dash to the oil mixture. 40 minutes at 350.

Delicious!  A different taste for salmon, but it works really well.  If possible get olives from an olive bar.  The jarred ones are just not the same!

This recipe was ok.  Like my husband said, it tastes like salmon with a bunch of stuff on top.  It might have been better if the toppings were sauteed together before putting on the salmon.  All of the flavors were good, they just didn't meld together very well.  Another tip is to sprinkle salt and pepper on the salmon before the other toppings.  I do have to give this recipe points for being healthy though!

Loved it, the only thing I added was a sprinkle of greek spice (pampered chef) to each piece of salmon. We will definitely repeat this one!

Awesome recipe!! Even my roommate who refuses to eat anything salmon loved this. All the strong Greek flavors did a good job keeping the sometimes fishy salmon in check. I will definitly use again!
