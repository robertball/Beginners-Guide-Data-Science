As I added the sugar I found four cups worked for me so I stopped right there and only added enough milk to get it to the proper consistency for piping onto cupcakes.   I wanted a true butter tasting frosting that wasn't too sweet - six cups would have defeated that.  With four cups I got a beautiful, light, fluffy, not-too-sweet butter cream frosting.

hate to break the chain of enthusiastic reviews, but this was just not so top-notch for me.  I have quite the sweet tooth and even I found this too be a bit too sweet.  those who ate the cake along with ice cream (I used this for my boyfriend's bday cake) finished, but those who didn't want ice cream barely made it halfway through their slices.

This is a really delicious frosting, and spreads really well on cakes and cookies.  The only thing I do differently is to use unsalted butter, or leave out the salt in the recipe.

I used this recipe for my twins' first birthday cakes.  I did cut the recipe in half and added more red food coloring for a pinker color.  Really liked the flavor.  Had to keep it in the fridge or the icing started to run.  Will definitely use again.

I cut recipe amount by 1/3 and still had enough for  2 one layer cakes and a dozen cupcakes!  I found the taste very sweet, so I added extra vanilla extract and some almond extract.  Good for plain white or not too sweet cakes.

I was wanting a recipe that I could tint several different colors for my daughter's b-day cake.  This was perfect.  When I went to make it, I realized I only had about 5 cups of powdered sugar.  It turned out great and I didn't need to add the extra few Tablespoons of milk at the end.  If I had added one more cup of powdered sugar, i can't imagine it turning out though.  It was very yummy too!

I bake a lot of cakes and finally found the perfect frosting.  Not only is it delicious and perfect!  It made a nice size amount so I could frost a 2 layer cake.  This will be a staple in my house from now on.  Thanks!

Great recipe. Very, very, very sweet, though -- and this is coming from someone who likes sweet things. Also, you may need to add a little more milk than the recipe calls for to get it "spreadable."

very easy to make. i have been looking for a simple recipes and decided to try this i cut the servings to 1 to do a taste test. i have a sweet tooth and it was a bit sweet but still good. this recipe is very easy to change the flavor. i made peanut butter and chocolate. the peanut butter reminds me of reese's peices and the chocolate took away the 2-sweet flavor.  so over all very good recipe!  p.s. to change the flavor u gotta experiment start with small servings and keep adding till u get the right flavor for you

Oh yum! I used non-dairy butter and almond milk. It turned out really good. Maybe I didn't have the butter soft enough when I started, but it took awhile and some extra heat to get it to "whip".

This is the best frosting I've ever had! Definitely only use 4 cups of sugar - it's plenty sweet enough at 4 cups! And I didn't use food coloring. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it came out extremely tasty. Thank you!

It makes a nice consistency.  The frosting itself is bland and powdery.  I wish I would have know before I delivered it to a class full of kinder age kids.

I made this frosting for cupcakes I served at my daughter's 2nd birthday. It was easy to make and was delicious! My cupcakes were not very sweet so this frosting was a perfect match. It also tastes great paired with small pretzel twists!

This is by far the BEST frosting I've ever made or eaten.  I was looking for something quick that didn't require cooking and this one exceeded my expectations.  I will be making this quite often.  My family loves it too.

A great recipe for cupcakes, or when you need a "smooth" icing.  Not the best flavor though. I did half pink & half purple cupcakes, the purple required more food coloring and the taste changed.  Make sure you refrigerate you cake/cupcakes once the icing is on, otherwise it will run.

I made this frosting with a nine-year-old and we both thought it was easy and delicious. It is sweet and light, definitely not overpowering, and we had fun separating the white frosting into separate containers and making a rainbow of sweet topping for our cake!

I only used 4 cups of powdered sugar. I did not add salt but used salted butter. It was a big hit! Tasted delicious and was easy to spread.

I did the recipe as directed BUT added a little more vanilla extract and added the salt and about a capful of lemon juice to the milk before adding it to the butter/sugar mix.. my 9 yr old daughter had fun mixing it to desolve the salt.. finished product?? A beautiful smooth not overly sweet butter cream frosting that was to die for. Thank u for the recipe.

It was way too sweet and I only used 4 cups of sugar as suggested by another reviewer. Will never try this again.

I would not serve artificial colors to children, especially red which is know to be linked to ADD.  But it is good to find a recipe that does not include RAW eggs.  Thanks for the recipe, I did not add any dye.

I'm not a frosting person, but this one was great! I had to put water in the bowl so I wouldn't keep licking it. I cut the recipe down to 5 servings and it did great decorating a sheet cake.

This icing was very easy to work with but I found it way too sweet, even my 13 year old thought so.  I don't think I will use this recipe again.

Perfect every time. I like to add to it as well. I put in some coconut and turned it green. Great for spring!

I have to say that this was an excellent frosting for cupcakes.  Nice and smooth.  I would certainly make it again.

This is a great, versitile frosting for any cookie.  I made the whole batch plain and seperated it into smaller bowls and made rainbow frosting for a birthday party.  I definatly suggest using a food processor - otherwise it's some major elbow grease!

Just okay. I had to add extra milk to make icing more spreadable. Used on cookies instead of cake. Probaly will stick to powdered sugar frosting next time.

Excellent frosting.  I tried a different buttercream recipe from here last month and thought it was a bit "heavy".  This icing is just the right blend of sweetness and lightness... but not too light like whipped cream frosting.  Hubby and kids wouldn't let me frost from all their licking!
