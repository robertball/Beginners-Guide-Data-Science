Five stars for the recipe instructions! Amanda, you are a great instructor. You've put all the best tips here. Everyone could benefit from bookmarking this recipe and using its techniques for tender cakes. The texture of this cake was phenomenal, not as dense as typical pound cake. I would call this a "cocoa cake", though, because the ONLY change I made was to add twice the amount of cocoa, and it still wasn't very chocolatey. Chocolate ganache from this site topped it well. I wonder what substituting melted bittersweet chocolate for cocoa (2-4 squares) and cream cheese for sour cream would do. At least, DO add more chocolate chips!- 2 cups if you really like chocolate; just don't refrigerate it, or the chips will be hard. I'm savin' this recipe =)

This cake is awesome!  I do quite a lot of baking and this is one of my favorite cakes ever.  The texture is velvety smooth.  Really perfect with a cup of tea or coffee.  It has a really nice subtle chocolate flavor that was just right for me.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I have made it twice.  I'm normally one to take shortcuts and rush through a recipe (as I have two young children) but I really took my time both times I made this cake...following every step.  I will definitely keep this one on file and make it again and again!

I made this today for my church community group and it turned out wonderful. I think it may be the softest cake I have ever made...even tasted. I agree too that the directions were fabulous. Great job Amanda and thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I made this for my son's birthday, he wanted a train cake so I needed to cut loaves up to make the engine, stack, and cars. It cut up so nicely and held together so I could shape the cake perfectly! There wasn't so much as a crumb left, it was delicious. Thank you.

This cake is so good!  It is moist and light.  I made it in a Bundt pan.  Short on time, I baked it for 1 hour on 350.  I doubled the salt based on another review and didn't include cream of tarter (didn't have any), and it turned out fine.

Super good!  Since we don't like too much sweetness, I cut down (a little less than 1/4 cup) on the sugar.  The cake is very pretty with a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar over the top.  Serve with lightly sweetened whipped cream and you've got a marvelous dessert for family or dinner parties.

I decided to do a test run of this cake tonight before I serve it at Thanksgiving dinner.  It is absolutely FANTASTIC!  Altho time consuming, it for sure beats out any pound cake I've ever had...and that makes up for it!  I will be making another one tomorrow night because I cut into the one i made tonight.  I did however double the cocoa.  Immediately it has a very light cocoa flavor, at the end, a buttery flavor.  AMAZING!!!

Mmm, yum yum! I agree that the recipe directions were clear and easy to follow. I had been looking for a yummy chocolate chip cake to satisfy my craving for choco chips without resorting to cookies. Most cakes I found used ingredients like packaged jell-o pudding. I always prefer to take things from more basic ingredients- so I know exactly what is going in my food, and so I feel like I am actually baking! So this recipe was great! We have a large oven, and a smaller oven for side dishes and rolls and such. I used my smaller oven, so the result was shorter cooking time and a crust that was not too hard, but a little crispy. The inside is still moist and creamy, melt-in-your-mouth good. It is just great! Thanks for this recipe, I will be using it again!

Very nice cake.  I doubled the salt, and cocoa and my family all agreed that it was even better.

I don't know what to say.  It is definitely not what I consider to be a pound cake. I won't make it again.  It is definitely not what I'm looking for.  This is also fairly complicated, but the steps are spelled out.  Don't do this if you are an experienced cook.

LOVED IT !!!! This is the second time i made this cake. I would recomend reading and understanding the drections in advance. Take your time, and follow step-by-step. I did add more chocolate chips, 1 cup of chopped wallnuts. I mixed 1 of a cup powdered sugar, 1 Tbsp. milk, and 1 tsp. vanilla, and poured it in a design over the cake after the cake was at room tempature.

5 stars for instructions and 5 for the cake - congratulations. If you plan on making a cake like this, be prepared to spend the time and also no substitutes when it comes to ingredients.  Having everything at room temperature is imperative. Pound type cakes requires a lot of beating and the results are wonderful - moist and delicious.

for me this was a complete waste of ingredients. thick, dense ( not in a good pound cake way ) and tasteless. Needs way more cocoa powder and I think too much butter per egg ratio?

This is an excellent recipe the instruction are easy to understand.The ingredients are things that you would have on hand and the cake has the perfect texture for a pound cake. I would give it more stars if I could. The taste is right on.I baked it in my convection oven and baked it about 10 minutes longer. I tested it before taking it out of oven.

This cake was delicious.  I would definitely recommend trying it, being sure to follow the excellent instructions.  

I was looking for a cake recipe to bake in my Wilton Wonder Mold (you know, the one you use to create a ballgown shape, to make a princess cake). This recipe was the perfect choice - it came out of the pan easily, held its shape well, and didn't fall apart when sliced. 

I had to bake it for an extra 5 minutes, and then I turned the oven off and left it in there for another 10 before my tester came out clean, but I suspect that may have been necessary only due to the deep bowl shape of the mold.  Other than that, I made only minor changes (doubled the cocoa powder, and used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet), so I feel confident giving this recipe 5 stars, as written. 

Just a note - this is quite a heavy cake, moist & dense.  If you're looking for a light, airy cake - this is not it.  But for a molded cake, like a bundt, or a loaf, or the Wonder Mold, it's a great choice. 

One more thing - full disclosure - I am NOT a chocoholic - this cake was chocolaty enough for me (like chocolate milk).  It does not have a "dark" bittersweet chocolate flavor.

This cake turned out fantastic.  The moistness was about level 4 on a 5 level mark.  I used a cup of my wheat/barley whole wheat flour that I grind and 1 3/4c. all purpose.  Everything else was the same.  It had the most beautiful texture of any cake I have ever made!! This one I will make again for sure.  I served it plain but it would have been even better with a chocolate glaze or whipped cream/ice cream.  Make sure to follow measurements close and DON'T open the oven for at least the first 60min or until you are sure it is very near done otherwise it will sink.  I baked it about 7 min over an hour.  LOVELY cake!!!

I made this with extra cocoa powder (doubled), and it came out great. Probably the best cake I've ever made.  Well worth the extra time.  I will definitely make it again, and soon!!

Thank you, thank you!  Finally a chocolate pound cake that tastes good without icing and is moist.  I tripled the cocoa powder because I love chocolate so I took out a few tablespoons of flour to compensate.  I used mini chocolate chips.  Yes it does take longer to separate the eggs and beating the egg whites but that's the key to make this recipe fluffy and lighter than other pound cakes.  I also liked that it wasn't overly sweet and used 2.5 cups sugar instead of 3 cups as most pound cakes do.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe. Thanks!

It was not moist and not chocolaty  I had to make an icing for it and serve it with ice cream to even enjoy it somewhat.  Seeing that chocolate was listed twice in the title, you'd think it was really chocolatey.  Not so... 2 Tbsps. of chocolate does not chocolate make!  I printed this recipe out and it is going into the round file right now

Overall, a very good cake and recipe.  I missed that it was chocolate chocolate.  In my opinion, 2T Cocoa was not nearly enough.  If you want chocolate batter, double that.  Also, add 1-1.5 c chips.  I used about 3/4 c and it could have used some more.  I would make this again w that add, but no cocoa.
