These were delicious!  I didn't tell my boys they were gluten-free and they couldn't tell the difference.  I made just as stated. The only difference was that I used a pre-blend of gluten-free flour (Pamela's- really good and easy to use).  I was curious about no baking soda, but I did not add it and the brownies came out thick and fudgy. The batter looked exactly the same when it came out of the oven as it did when it went in!  I will definitely make these again and might add baking soda just to satisfy my curiosity...  UPDATE-  I did add baking soda the second time I made these.  They puffed way up and then fell when they came out of the oven.  This time the brownies were much darker and not as dense, much more the texture and color of a box brownie mix.  Thanks, Lindsay these are delicious either way!!

Thank you for this family recipe, Lindsay. My son wanted brownies (& ice cream) for his 10th birthday celebration. We are a gluten-free family and even though I love baking and do it quite often, I've never made GF brownies. So I searched online and found your recipe. It came out great! I made a few small changes: 
-I used a combination of coconut sugar and xylitol (birch bark sugar) and used about 1/8-1/4 cup less than the recipe called for.
-I added about 1/4 cup buttermilk (this always makes baked goods really moist)
-used sprouted brown rice flour instead of sorghum flour since that's what I had on hand. Sorghum flour is a sweeter rice flour and sprouted brown rice flour is more of a standard flour flavor. 
-I used a combo of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate chips since I didn't have enough semi-sweet.

Using less sugar and less sweet chocolate chips still made for plenty sweet brownies. They are so moist, fudgy and delicious. I will definitely make them again. I've already been asked to share the recipe with a friend and I already emailed it to her. Thanks again. Love this recipe.

Pretty good!... nice and fudge-like.  I'm not an experienced gluten-free baker, so I was worried when I saw how sticky and difficult to spread the batter was, but I guess that's typical, because it came out well.  I didn't have teff flour but I used brown rice flour instead, and that didn't ruin it, thankfully.

I might try it again with some baking soda. Not worth baking as is.

Boy, Lindsay is not kidding when she called these brownies 'the best ever'!!  I bake gluten-free for my mother who has celiac, but this is the recipe I'm going to use whenever I bake brownies.  I followed the recipe except that I used 3/4 cup of 'Cup4Cup' gluten-free flour in place of the three different flours and eliminated the xanthan gum.  They were simply DELICIOUS!!  Props to Lindsay L.!!

I baked these brownies for my daughter who follows a gluten free diet.  The only change was to substitute the Cup 4 Cup in place of the flours and xanthan gum.  My other non-gluten free children didn't even know the difference.  They all said that these brownies were the best ones that I've ever made.  Thanks Lindsay!

This is a great recipe! I just used it to make my first batch of brownies ever and it came out better than I ever expected. The only addition was a little bit of baking powder and replaced xanthan gum with milled flax seeds (mix with 2 tsp of boiling water to form a gummy substance before adding it to the batter).

I tried this recipe using 3/4 cup of GF flour blend - without any gums added - and enjoyed the brownies very much.  I don't care for the use of xanthan gum and by reading the other reviews mentioning that the batter seemed "glob-like" or "sticky" felt this was because of the gum and chose to omit it altogether.  I used an 8X8 square baking dish (approx. 2 inches high) and they cooked evenly throughout in approximately 30 minutes.  The end product was crumbly.  I imagine this was due to the lack of any binders.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  The taste is in fact delicious just like a traditional brownie.  Perhaps the next time I'll use some arrowroot or sweet rice flour to help bind more.  Thank you Lindsay for sharing this recipe.

I've made these brownies twice now, and wow!  Forget about them being gluten free, these were delicious all on their own!  The last time I made these I threw in some gluten free rolled oats, for my own amusement.  I really liked the texture of oats vs. nuts, but to each their own.

I eat gluten free and this was the perfect dessert. These are the best gluten free brownies I've ever had. The middle was really chewy and the brownies were a little too chocolatey for my taste, but that's just me. Other than that, the brownies were delicious!

This recipe ROCKS. Only changes I made were that I used 3/4th cup of a gluten free APF blend, and I added 1 tsp of baking soda. You have to use a binder for this recipe. I prefer xanthan gum, but any other binding agent you prefer should work. You just have to use one if you want the brownies to be thick and fudgy instead of crumbly.

We love this.  It has turned out every time!  I use Vitacost  baking flour ( blend with xanthan gum in it, and then add the teff.  I also add cinnamon.  I mix up 2 batches.  One batch to bake now, and the second one is ready with all the dry ingredients in it for later.

I honestly believe that these were some of the best brownies. My family finished them off before they even cooled down. I substituted the different flours for 3/4 of a cup of gluten free flour, exactly what the recipe says and they turned out perfect. However, I only lessened the amount of sugar that I added simply because that is how I prefer them. The reviews were correct, these brownies  were amazing.

I was hoping for something more gooey and chewy. Part of the problem could have been I replaced the teff flour with coconut flour.

This recipe is a keeper. I substituted brown rice flour for teff flour and it wasn't affected. I also substituted coconut spread by Earth Balance for lactose allergy and it was good.

Just starting my gluten free lifestyle due to health reasons I was so happy to stumble on this site! These are truly amazing and even my kids enjoyed them! So grateful to find recipes that actually don't taste like they are gluten free and this is definitely one I will keep!! Thank you... I also am not much of a cook so these were made by my 16 year old daughter... Grateful to have such a kitchen savvy daughter! ??

These were great! I used white rice flour for teff flour.  These were delicious despite the substitution.

I was skeptical about this recipe once I had everything mixed together because it was like a solid gooey mass, almost impossible to spread out in the baking pan, but WOW they came out amazing!!  They took an extra 15 minutes to cook, but that's somewhat typical for my oven.  I placed a few peanut butter cups throughout because my boyfriend was craving them but with or without them, we both agreed these brownies taste incredible... you can't tell they're gluten free at all and they're much better than the gf pre-mixes.  Can't wait to make them again, highly recommended!
