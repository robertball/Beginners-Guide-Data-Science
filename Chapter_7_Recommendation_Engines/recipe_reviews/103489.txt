A tasty recipe that makes great leftovers.  I used milk instead of the heavy cream to lighten it up a bit.  Nice flavor and easy to make.

FYI: Chorizo has an interesting taste if you have never eaten it. I cooked mine up the night before making this recipe. I actually made it, and then wasn't sure what to do with it. Yay for All Recipes! 
This was great! I changed it up just a little bit: I used milk instead of the cream, red AND green pepper, shrimp instead of chicken, and one 6oz can of tomato paste mixed with 1/2 cup water, then added just a little spaghetti sauce with the milk and the red pepper flakes. YUM! We will definitely have this again. I loved it with shrimp and will throw in more next time. Husband liked it too.

This was a good pasta dish.   I would cook the chicken a little less than instructed because we thought the chicken was dry.

I did this recipe kind of ma way lol So i used Italian sausage cuz that's what i had, also replace cream for milk and instead of tomatoes puree i used marinara sauce and cherry tomatoes and a hint of merlot which was the kick of my sauce, while cooking chicken added the bell peppers plus a little cilantro&Garlic and only used provolone cheese and Pecorino Romano..It came out Delicious!!

It was a tasty meal, I might make it again, but would probably tweak it more.  Definitely was not a spicy dish (and I added a lot more red pepper flakes).  I also seasoned it was Spanish Paprika and Cilantro.  I used shrimp instead of chicken.  I added an entire onion, an additional green bell pepper, used heavy cream because that's what I had on hand, and mixed in cheese before layering the top with the cheese.

I thought this was pretty good.  I think next time I will use less chicken and more chorizo.  It wasn't really spicy and I felt the chicken was pretty bland.  All in all not a bad dish.

This was much better than I expected it to be!  I had never eaten chorizo before and I discovered we really like it.  I think this dish could use a little something extra, a few more ingredients with more flavor.  I added sauteed onion and used roasted red pepper because it's what I had on hand.  Also used milk instead of cream.  I might just throw in a few spices next time when the chicken is cooking.

When I made this I used shrimp and chorizo. The only chorizo I could find was the little "sausage" like rolled ones in a small package. A very different flavor then the kind that I am used to. I think next time I make this I will use chicken and shrimp. It would be way better that way.

I bought 2 lbs of ground chorizo sausage and adapted this recipe to use it. Used 2 lbs pasta to stretch the recipe to feed 10. I used milk instead of cream, red curry powder instead of the red pepper flakes, green pepper instead of red because that's what I had in the fridge and added an onion and some mushrooms because it sounded good. As I was getting the shredded cheese out of the fridge I found some riccotta cheese and added a cup of that to the sauce. Was quite spicey but the kiddies still came back for seconds, then thirds, and fourths for a few! Have wanted to try chorizo for a while we are all glad I did!

I had left over chicken and chorizo in the freezer and was trying to find something quick to make with it; this recipe fit the bill.  The only thing I did differently was to cook the tomato sauce and cream in the same pot with the chicken and chorizo, in an effort to have one less pot to clean.  I also used less cheese than the recipe called for.  It worked out great.  This was a unique tasting dish.

This is a great busy day recipe. Much of it can be done beforehand without compromising flavor. I added cilantro, cut the amount of tomato puree in half (because I don't like tomato), added more milk (instead of cream), and just used cheddar cheese to simplify things. I have made it several times this way and it is definitely a favorite with me and my husband.

My family & I loved the recipe.  I used Turkey Sausage instead of the chorizo b/c they didn't have any chorizo at the store when I wemt.  And I used Carnation Cream/Milk rather than heavy cream b/c that is what I had in the cabiet. It turned out awesome! Everyone was in the clean plate club! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

My husband loves chorizo so I am always trying new recipes to satisfy his craving. This was really good and we both enjoyed it.  I didn't feed it to my toddler because I thought it might be too spicy, but it was very flavorful and not too spicy at all.  The only thing that I changed was adding mushrooms and a little more cheese to the top.  Looking forward to the leftovers :)

I HAVE NEVER TRIED CHORIZO BEFORE, I WONT TRY IT AGAIN, WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE TASTE. MAKE SURE YOU LIKE CHORIZO SAUSAGE BEFORE MAKING IT.  THE RECIPE WAS GOOD OTHER THAN THAT.  MAY TRY AGAIN WITH A DIFFERENT SAUSAGE

This dish was a big winner with my family and my new husband. Serves large groups easily and the leftovers are great. Also nice because it can easily be made into two dishes (meat and vegetarian).

Good, but we found it to be very chicken-heavy and a bit bland.  Next time we'll double the chorizo, halve the chicken and possibly add some garlic salt and Italian seasoning.  (Due to ingredient availability I substituted the cream with equal parts evaporated and skim milk, and green chilies for the pepper.  )

Didn't have any peppers so I used onions. I also used 1lb  ground chorizo, and prego chunky garden sauce, the whole jar, just for ease.  It was delicious.  My kids ate it all and my husband went back for seconds.

I was just looking for a way to use Chorizo.  It was tastey. But I don't think I am a huge fan of Chorizo.  This was a hearty and easy recipe, but the left-overs didn't get eaten in our house.

Really yummy! Added extra mozzarella and extra Parmesan (doubled both) and mixed those plus the cheddar into the dish before baking, putting extra Parmesan for the top. Only used two chicken breasts and increased Chorizo to 1-1/2 # ground Chorizo (Spanish style, not Mexican). Was careful not to overcook the chicken (used 1 inch chunks instead of 1/2 inch). Added smoked paprika to the Chorizo while cooking. And added smoked paprika to entire dish at the end. Added salt and pepper to chicken while cooking. Included 1 chopped medium onion along with the chopped red pepper. Used 1/2 cup heavy cream and half cup of whole milk. Added a 14oz can of roasted diced tomatoes to the puree. Thickened the sauce with a tablespoon of flour and water. Included the optional 1/2 t. pepper flakes. Froze half of the mixture for another time. Definitely will make again.

An easy bake, although without chilli flakes a little bland. Will definitely make it again but with extra flavourings.

Very easy to make! A favorite in my household as my fiancé is Puerto Rican, he loves the chorizo. I normally can’t eat it normally like, with eggs, but the chorizo in this casserole is subtle and not overpowering. I think the first time I made this, I only used half a tube of the chorizo. And always buy authentic. It makes a difference.

My wife compared it to lasagna and enchiladas, so of course this goes in our favorites file. We used tomato sauce rather than puree, heavy rather than light cream, and held out the red pepper flakes.

I MADE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES., that's why I give it 5 stars

I used Rotel tomatoes w/chillies
half and half (guessed)
1/2 cup of Green Salsa
1/2 cup of cream cheese
Chopped Onions


I cooked the Chorizo first, and then cooked the chicken in the Chorizo juice, adding Sazon Goya seasoning (can be found in any aisle where there's hispanic food).

I followed the recipe pretty closely. I used pork Chorizo , and added half of an onion, chopped, with the red bell pepper.  Will definitely make it again.

I misread this recipe and added a pound of chorizo sausage instead of (1).  I added 1/2 a large sweet onion chopped and cooked until translucent and  2 cloves minced garlic.  Was very good.  I would make this again...different take on a casserole type meal.

I used bulk beef chorizo and chicken breast, did not use any bell peppers, didnt have any on hand.  My 3 children would not eat it.  Perhaps it would be better with the rope sausage.  Only the wife liked it. Not a child friendly dish,  in my opinion.

I'm giving it a 4 because my picky daughter, who doesn't like even mildly spicy food, ate a ton of this.  I added onion and garlic, and next time I'll do ground chorizo vs a chorizo sausage, just my preference.

Was cleaning out the freezer and this was a good way to use up some stuff.  I used gluten free penne which ended up overcooking while I baked it.  It still tasted good, but the consistency was off.  Just a note for those using GF pasta.  My rating did not reflect the GF pasta.  Great recipe!

My whole family just loved this recipe! Just enough spice to be interesting but not so much that my little one couldn't eat it. I added an onion, a handful of mushrooms and some peas and used leftover chicken from yesterday's roast, and it was just lush. Thank you!

Yay, we all liked it. I didn't have all of the ingredients but, this was a great starting point. I used spaghetti sauce and dry milk. I chopped up an onion but had no green pepper. I used egg noodles because that's all I had. I must say that I added a small can of chipotle pepper sauce and it made all the difference. Dash of cumin and smoked paprika, too. Kids ate it up. We definitely make again.

I loved this, I used soy cherizo and chicken thighs. Used diced tomatoes that I ran through the food processor with red pepper flakes, pepper, garlic and onion powder. I also added onion and celery to the red pepper, cooked that all seperate from the meat. YUMMY! I used the onion and garlic powder and salt and pepper to the chicken before I cooked it. I had made sweet potato gniccoi last month so I boiled them then fried them and used that rather then penne. Loved this.

Not one of my favorites.  Sauce was thin and kind of tastless. I love chorizo, but I think I will do something different next time.
