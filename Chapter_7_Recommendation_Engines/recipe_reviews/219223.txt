Be aware the ingredents do not list pasta but the directions and title do so make sure you have some on hand. It was pretty good needed to add some herbs I added some Italian Seasoning to give it some flavor.

Pretty Tasty, quick and easy. I changed a little since I didn't have hunt products but I did use roasted garlic pasta sauce, yellow and orange bellpeppers (cause they are sweeter to taste). And I diced up fresh small tomatos. I added rotini pasta (its what I had). It was pretty good. I will definitley try again for a quick weeknight dish.

Made this last night and I added some cayenne pepper to give it some heat also extra tomato sauce; I used a large can of 20oz of sauce, rather than the suggested 8oz.  The recipe was delicious though.  I used a whole wheat spiral pasta so that it would hold the pasta.

This recipe, as listed, is not very flavorful. The tomatoes are excellent, but they did not provide enough spice. So, I replaced half of the ground beef with spicy Italian sausage, added 2 cloves of garlic, and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. It made all the difference. Picky Hubby even asked me to make it again.
