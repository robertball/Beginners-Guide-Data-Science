This was good. I did think it needed more cheese on the top and I didn't have any more mozzarella left so I used  some cheddar I had on hand. I think mushrooms would be a good addition if you like them.  I cannot imagine anyone who likes pepperoni pizza not liking this. It doesn't sit good for very long periods of time. Once it starts cooling down the texture gets a little weird so keep that in mind. This would be a big hit for a SuperBowl party.

This is definitely a an easy recipe that pays off.  I separated the mixture into two oven-safe 16 ounce bowls and added 5 minutes to the bake time, they could of used 10 since they were deeper than the 9 inch pan recommended at the 30 minutes.  I have to tell you I never did find the Herb and Garlic soup mix despite looking in multiple stores so I substituted by looking at some suggestions.  Thank you!
