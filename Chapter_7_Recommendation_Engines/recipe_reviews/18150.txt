I made this cake for Christmas and it was a hit.  On top of that, it was easy to make.  I have already filed it away and plan to make it again.

This cake was wonderful, very chocolatey. The glaze was the best tasting I have used.  Usually I make a 2 layer cake & end up throwing half of it away (its just me and my husband). This is the perfect size. I know, who would throw away chocolate? Thanks for the great recipe.   Karen

I made this cake for a family gathering and everyone loved it! I did not use any pecans or nuts. It still tasted great! I am planning on making it again!
Thanks for this recipe!!!

This is a delicious, moist cake.  Perfect for fudge-lovers.  I left the coffee out, since we do not drink it and didn't have any in the house.  It tastes great warm and fresh too, if you don't have time to chill it before serving.

This cake was fantastic! I make it over and over again and everyone still loves it! It still tastes good without the pecans, if that isn't a favorite in your family. Enjoy!

The cake recipe is wonderful!  I've made it a half dozen times for various functions and every time people love it.  I always bake it in a bundt pan.  I haven't used the provided icing recipe.  I do a cream cheese icing with cranberries and orange extract.  Pulse the dried cranberries in a food processor, add them plus 4-5 drops of orange extract to your favorite cream cheese icing recipe and you've got a wonderful icing that pairs with this cake in a spectacular way.

I so wanted to love this cake.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  The consistency is good, the glaze is good, and the cake is moist.  Unfortunatley, I just didn't like the flavor of the cake.  The rest of my family are die-hard chocolate lovers, and they didn't care for it either.  Sorry.

I made this cake for my brother and his family. I left out the nuts since one of his kids has an allergy. I made a fudge frosting instead of the glaze. Unfortunately I didn't taste it but my brother and his family loved it.

I love this recipe. I'm not a fan of nuts in my chocolate, but I followed everything else about this recipe to the T, and it's an amazing cake. :)
Thanks for sharing!
