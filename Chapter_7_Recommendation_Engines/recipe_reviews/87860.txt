This is absolutely amazing mac and cheese and I am picky when it comes to my mac and cheese! Here are my thoughts:
1. For those who think its too saucy or grainy, it may be because it wasn't whisked long enough in the part where you whisk the flour/butter and milk mixture. The recipe said 3-4 mins, but it took me almost 12 minutes to get it thick and bubbly like it asked for. I know in making things like this before, if you don't do it long enough, it won't be quite right. So put in the extra elbow grease and stir! : )
2. I am a cheese lover. I used fresh grated parmesan and also added 1 cup of mozzarella in addition to the sharp cheddar. I also find adding other cheeses to sharp cheese sauces helps to cut out any graininess.
3. I omitted the step of pouring the noodles onto a cookie sheet. I simply added a teaspoon of oil into the water when cooking the noodles, drained them and left them in a strainer with a plate on top. I had no problems with sticking and it was easy.
4. This makes a TON and I mean a ton! I will probably 1/2 the recipe next time since there are only 2 of us but we already are looking forward to eating leftovers!
5. I omitted the salt, took out 1 T of butter, used 2% milkfat cheese and low fat evaporated milk and there was no difference in taste.
6. This will be a hit at potlucks, baby dinners, etc..and we will make it often!
7. My picky 4 year old ate two bowls!

This macaroni and cheese is awesome!  I also used Alton Brown's recipe until I found this one.  Its easier and just as good if not better!  If you really like Kraft or Velveeta brands of mac/chs, you probably won't like this.  If you like real homemade Mac&chs, you will love this!  I changed the servings to 4 and it still made a ton! The only changes I made was to use ground mustard instead of Dijon (too strong) and only 1/2 of a tsp (for 4 servings) or 1 tsp for the full 10 servings.  Too much is overwhelming.  I also substituted heavy cream instead of evaporated milk and that made it unbelieveably creamy. In fact I tried the evaporated milk when I made it a second time and I will NEVER make it that way again.  It did not compare to the cream.  I would recommend half and half or cream. And I also used a few slices of velveeta to make it creamier and not grainy but if you cook the butter and flour well, you won't get the grainyness anyways.  Very very delicious.  My new favorite!

Superb.  The best homemade mac and cheese.  Huge hit hit the kids. I excluded the parmesan cheese, mustard, and pepper and it still came out great.  It didn't stir for 30 minutes as other raters did, although I did stir for 10 minutes which is longer than the recipe said.  Left overs heat up excellent without the cheese getting clumpy.  Excellent for school lunches.
Will definately make again.
Update:
When I made the second time I found that heating the broth mixture for five minutes in the microwave reduced the amount of time needed for stirring to five minutes.  Also, if you stir too long before adding the cheese then it comes out too clumpy.

This was really, really good, and so much easier than the mac & cheese recipe I've been using (Alton Brown's).  It was a bit thick, though, so next time I think I'll add an additional can of evaporated milk.  Also, to suit my family's tastes, I added a bit of garlic and onion powder to the roux before adding the liquids.  Also used dry mustard powder (maybe 1/2 a teaspoon?) instead of the dijon.  I also used a third each of sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and monterey jack.  The "grittiness" several previous reviewers noticed is due to using only sharp cheddar-- I just read about that somewhere and using milder cheeses definitely results in a smoother, creamier texture.  Finally, I did pour this into a casserole and baked it for about 30 minutes until it started to brown on top.  My picky 11 year old loved this, as did my husband (and I!) so this is now going to me my new mac & cheese recipe!

I would give this zero stars if I could. The dijon mustard overpowered the dish, and I'm pretty sure the parmesan also played a part in that. The sauce is way thick, and the sauce to pasta ratio is way off. I would never recommend this.

Fantastic Mac & Cheese!! Only thing I did different was use 1/4 tsp Dry Mustard instead of Dijon and one can of milk. Only bad thing about this recipe was everyone ate all of it and I had none for a late night snack. Boo Hoo. This one is a definite keeper!! Thank you for sharing. I am now the official Mac & Cheese maker for all family functions.

Although this was the creamiest mac and cheese I ever had, it was WAY to saucy for us!  Also, I didn't care for the Dijon in the sauce (I even cut back a little on the Dijon) and it overpowered it.  We had to throw the whole batch out :(

This is perfect..except for the amount of time needed to stir & thicken sauce (on medium heat)it took me 30 minutes of constant stirring, which is the right way to do it if you want to avoid graininess. I only had one can of evap. milk,so i just refilled the can (to measure)with 2% milk. I didnt have dijon, and liked it better anyway with dry mustard. I added the salt & pepper periodically, and think i used less than a tablespoon of salt.I didn't want the sauce too thick, so i added the rest of the 14 oz can of chicken broth i opened.I also added just a dash of tumeric(its yellow & good for you). This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

This was really good homemade mac and cheese.  I omitted the parm cheese and baked it for 20 min.  Very yummy.  I do like the Dijon mustard but if you don't the base works without it and you can jazz it up with your own custom flavors (garlic, onion, etc.).

I was so nervous to make this recipe, but I don't know why....it was HIT @ my house!!!!  I actually added 1 (10.75oz) of cheddar cheese soup to thicken up the sauce & make it cheesier!  I pour the mix into a casserole dish, topped w/cheddar cheese & baked in the oven for 40min.  It was absolutely delicious.  This is definitely a KEEPER!!!

This is the creamiest mac and cheese. It has a real nice sharp cheese bite at the end and my husband didn't care for that so the next day I added about 1 1/2 c. of mozz and topped it with seasoned bread crumbs, heated it in the oven and it was awesome. We all loved it. I won't be looking for another recipe. This is it !!!

I made 2 batches.  The first batch (org recipe no changes) gets 3.5 stars, The dijon is TOO much, in fact it shouldn't even be in this recipe!  The only "mustard" that should even make an appearance in this recipe is the dry stuff -found in the seasonings/herb area of your local grocer.  It was creamy, but just lacked any type of "wow" factor. Second batch gets 5 stars -quantity listed is for FIVE servings...changes made: replace the dijon w/ 1/4 tsp dry mustard, use 1/2 tsp worchestershire sauce, instead of all cheddar, use a combination.  I used 5 ounces cheddar cheese, 1 oz EACH extra sharp white cheddar, muenster, and 5 cheese italian blend.  Yummy, and creamy - this made an awesome mac & cheese - plus it made a wonderful base for my chili mac!    I also changed the method of prep.  Melt the butter first, then whisk in the flour to where it's smooth, slowly add your chicken broth, and continue to whisk, then add the evap milk (I used 2% evap milk) and continue to whisk over a med-high heat until slightly thickened.  Then proceed to add in the cheese, and remaining ingredients.  This method keeps you from having to nuke the milk & broth.

This is great. Cut out the dijon, however, and instead add a dash of ground mustard. I like a tiny dash of cayenne in it as well, it seems to "wake up" the flavor of the cheddar.

I recalculated this to yield 5 servings which meant I halved the ingredients with the exception of the Dijon mustard.  Since so many reviewers had said the Dijon mustard was a bit overpowering, I  added 1/2 teaspoon and that amount was just enough to give it a nice zip.  When this is first removed from the heat, it appears to be rather soupy but as it cools, the cheese and milk mixture are absorbed.  I will be making this again!

WAAAAY too much milk in the original recipe for me.  I cut it down to about 2 cups and used whole milk instead.  it turned perfectly creamy and if there were any more it would have been too runny. I also didn't particularly like the Dijon flavor so when I make this again (and I will) I'll either omit it or seriously reduce it.   And just for kicks, to add some personal flavor, I wanted it spicy.  So I added cayenne, red pepper flakes and pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  Would highly recommend it this way to anyone who enjoys a little heat!

We liked this recipe but it is lacking something in the way of flavor.  Next time we will try adding red pepper flakes and a stronger type of cheese.  Otherwise, it was nice and creamy and not all that expensive to make.

this is a great recipe. i used shredded cheddar and monteray jack instead of all cheddar and 1 can lowfat and 1 can regular evaporated milk and dry mustard not dijon and  i splashed in a tbls. or two of worchester sauce too just because it rounds everything out.  i also added a chopped up onion cooked in the butter.  it might look like i channged alot  but i didn't.  if you use a whole pound of elbows it's not as loose as people think and really very good. i made it for a block party and everybody loved it.  kids included!

This was very very good! I added some chopped onion and ham to the mixture, which offset the mustard taste very well. I think this will be my new mac and cheese recipe from now on.

I don't know why this recipe doesn't have 5 full stars. I wouldn't make anything else now that I've found it. I'm not a fan of the eggy, baked dry macaroni that other recipes make. Thank you for this wonderful, creamy mac & cheese!

Skip the dijon altogether. I was a little unsure about adding it due to all the negative reviews so I reserved a small bit of the finished recipe and added a small dab of dijion to that and it was awful. Otherwise, without the dijion, this mac and cheese was just okay. Nothing special and nothing I'd ever make again, but it was a good try. I prefer baked mac and cheese over this one.

Very good.  One of my children will not readily eat Mac and Cheese, except the boxed kind or Boston Market's.  I'm not crazy about boxed or Boston Market's, but the entire family loves Mac and Cheese.  So to find one that suits all our tastes, would be a sure miracle.  This one still isn't it, but it has come the closest so far.  :)  I attribute it to adding the chicken broth and possibly the evaporated milk.  Everyone ate it, including the pickiest one.  Personally, I don't see the point of any Mac and Cheese recipe with cornstarch or flour, so I never use that anymore.  Roux's are good for other dishes, but not Mac and Cheese.  I can get my desired texture from milk and cheese just fine.  Next time, no mustard!  I only put in a squirt and still found it to be too much, so I imagine a full 1.5 TBSP would be excessive.  A good base recipe to tweak around to your liking and add extra yummy ingredients to (i.e. bacon, onion, ect...).  :)

I agree with some of the other posters, the dijon is too much for this recipe.  Next time I will use dry mustard or Nance's Sharp and Creamy mustard.  I will reduce the amount to 1 tablespoon.  I ended up using heavy cream w/ milk because that is what I had on hand and ended up adding 3/4 cup of mozzarella because I needed to use it up.  Add a bit of cayenne pepper and worceshire sauce to give it a little kick.  It made a very creamy mac and cheese that will (with minor changes) be made again and again.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  I make it all the time.  I changed a couple of things.. I do the 1pound of elbow noodles, but I half everything in the sauce recipe.  It comes out perfect.  I also don't put in the dijon mustard.  Its a great recipe! XD

I was looking for a homemade mac-n-cheese recipe like my grandma used to make. I found this recipe to have the consistency of school paste. I followed the directions but between the sharp cheddar, strong Parmesan and the mustard, it was SO sour! I have no problems cooking a rue so I know that wasn't the problem with the consistency but for some reason it was too thick and way way too sour. Neither my 3 teens nor my husband and I could even eat it. Disappointed it was such a waste of good ingredients (and money).

I am sure this would have been even better with canned milk and chicken broth.  I used just regular milk for all the wet ingrediants.. Easy quick and good.  I can not wait to try it with the regular ingredients.  My son says no mustard next time, he likes it says that is all he can taste.. haha.. he must have a strong pallette today.

Made for the family they loved it!! But I only used 1 can of evaporated milk instead of 2. It was more creamy & less "soupy"

This was good, but next time I'll leave out the mustard.  It leaves a very obvious mustard taste to the sauce.  I might try adding a bit of mustard powder as another person suggested here, instead.  I think it could also have used a bit of salt.  Otherwise, this makes a really nice, creamy cheesy macaroni and cheese.

I had no problems with it being grainy at all, and it thickened up in the 3-4 minutes as directed, in fact mine got too thick, and I needed to thin it out some.  I think the key is to make sure you heat the milk and broth together, as directed, before whisking it into the roux.

We LOVED this!  I am not even a fan of mac n cheese, and I had a second helping...and I NEVER have second helpings of anything!  This recipe makes a ton.  I could have easily halved it and everyone (4 were eating this) could have had seconds plus some left over. (we are looking forward to all of the leftovers though:) I cut the mustard down to half, but will cut it down even further or just omit altogether next time.  I added onion and garlic powders to the roux, and a little season salt.  I was totally out of parmesan, so I added another 2/3 cup of mild cheddar.  I used all mild cheddar, but next time will definately use the parmesan and half sharp cheddar, half mild cheddar.  Thank you for the recipe Pam!  This will be the only mac and cheese I make from now on :)

This is a really great mac and cheese recipe.  Soooo creamy!  I actually saved some of the cheese sauce on the side cause it made so much.  I'll put it on veggies for dinner one night this week.  I substituted a teaspoon of ground mustard in place of dijon due to the reviews that it was too overwhelming.  I also used 8 oz. sharp cheddar, 8 oz. colby jack and about 4 oz. mozzarella cheese.  I thought it needed a little extra salt at the end as well.

This recipe is true to it's name and it turned out o.k. and creamy it is just not to my taste.  I guess I like a more sophisticated taste.  It taste like something you would get at a buffet or a cafeteria.  I know that sounds snobby, sorry.  If you are looking for a creamy, kid friendly recipe you will love this.  If you are used to something a little sharper and sophisticated (I like Cooking Lights "Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese, for example) then you should move along.

Not the best mac recipe. Too powdery and I think it's because of the amount of the flour and maybe the cheese.  I think we will stick to baked mac recipes in the future.

This was probably the worst mac and cheese recipe I have tried. The mustard wound up being the main flavor and I don't know anyone who likes to eat mustard pasta. I was thoroughly disappointed!

Ok...so comparing to my Mom's simple M&C recipe as I grew up as kid...this is pretty darn good. I tend to adjust recipes to my preference from the "git go"...I used 8 oz 2% cheese and 8 oz full fat cheese. Also added a at least a Tablespoon garlic, about a cup of zucchini I grew and had available.  I used one can of fat free evaporated milk and one can of 2% fat can.  The cheese was fatty enough to make this a non issue. POC...Pasta of Choice is indicated here also. This is a nice version of our childhood version...a decent alternative.

Just what I was looking for! I love macaroni and cheese, but I don't make it homemade often because of the fat content of it. The chicken broth helps to cut down on the fat and adds wonderful flavor and creaminess. I halved the recipe, except for the chicken broth (I used l cup), and substituted the 2 cups of cheddar cheese for l cup of cubed velveeta cheese and 2 Tablespoons of asiago cheese spread (Sams Club). Very flavorful! This gets very thick when refrigerated, just add some half and half and put it in the microwave to bring back the creamy texture(stirring occasionally). You may need to add a little bit more cheese. Sprinkled top with grated cheddar cheese and placed under broiler to brown.

I made this recipe with acouple of differences. Didn't have evaporated milk, so I used lactose free 2% fat milk. Aloso I like dishes with a little heat, so shook a couple of Tabasco sauce into the sauce. After making the sauce, I greased a 1 1/2 quart Pyrex dish, put the macaroni in first, then added the sauce. Also grated more sharp cheddar to put on the top. Then stuck it into a 375 degree oven for til the cheese on top melted...it was still creamy and de-lic-ious!!

This is the best I have ever made. I fixed it twice and both times I topped it with a mixture of bread crumbs, garlic and parm cheese then baked it in the oven till bubbly and brown. I also add more chicken stock if it seems too thick.

This is a good recipe, but the extra sharp cheddar was a bit too rich for us. If we make this again I will try a mild cheddar or maybe even a colby-jack combo.

This was my first time making homemade macaroni and cheese and I thought it turned out good!  I followed the recipe, except for taking someone's advice to add a little oil to the macaroni water and then just leave it in the strainer, and someone else's advice to whisk for around 10 minutes instead of 3 or 4.  It was VERY creamy and VERY cheesy.  I think maybe even a little too much cheese for the macaroni (I halved the recipe, so next time I will use a little more than half the macaroni.)  I will probably make this again.

I had to double the ingredient of elbow only, because it was too creammmmy.  The end of the result, it was delicous.  I sugest if you don't like it tooo creammmy, you can either cut half the recipe called for of sharp cheddar cheese or make double of elbow or other bite size pasta.  Next time, I will use medium cheddar cheese and pepper jack cheese.  Oh and one more thing, the it takes about 10-12 minutes to thicken the sauce, not 3-4min.  I advice to use nonstick pot to prevent turning brown on the bottom pan, but keep stirring the sauce until thicken.

I wish I could give this six stars!  Fantastic recipe, and perfect for picky eaters like my kids.  I experimented with the cheeses, and tried a colby jack and medium cheddar combo (1/2 # of each).  Also omitted the mustard for my children.  Since I was low on butter I only used 2 Tb without losing any taste.  It was a little heavy for a main course, but it would be an excellent side dish.  PERFECT!  Will definitely make again!

I have made this according to the recipe exactly. I don't care for the Dijon mustard, but I love it with ground dry mustard. The flavor is there but does not overpower. I also found that putting it in the oven for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees thickens it up a bit more. This stays creamy even after the oven. Lots of cheese sauce. The chicken broth camouflages the flour taste. A pet peeve of mine. I hate tasting flour from the roux in my sauces. My go-to from now on for mac and cheese.

We're in between 3-4 stars. This was the creamiest mac I've ever had, but I can see how some reviewers said the Dijon overpowers the mac. It does throw it off a little, but it's still delicious. Next time I would just leave the Dijon out.

My family is funny about homemade macaroni and cheese.  They have one version that they really, really like and they compare every other one that I make to their favorite.  Well, I’m happy to announce that they loved this “no baked” version of mac n’cheese.  I made this as written using spiral shaped pasta and found it very creamy, just like the title says.  I like that this can be made pretty quickly and would work for a quick week night meal.  You could even make the sauce up ahead of time and reheat before adding to the cooked pasta. We had friends over for dinner the night I made this and they enjoyed it also and even had seconds.  That always makes the cook feel good.  :o) We really did like everything about this recipe.

Very good.  This is my first attempt ever to make a mac n cheese.  I did not add the dijon mustard as I don't care for it and I thought having the parm cheese might be a bit much.
I used it here:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/macaroni-and-cheese-with-bacon-and-onions/detail.aspx
So those extra flavorings would not be missed.

This is by far the BEST Mac & Cheese recipe I have made to date. I have made it multiple times and it is to die for. I get multitudes of compliments when I make this dish, I will never look for another mac and cheese recipe again, this is the one! If you're looking to make the perfect creamy mac and cheese, you've found it!

Creamy and not grainy.First time I have made mac and cheese that is not grainy without using Velveeta, and the flavor and texture is so much better without the processed cheese! Made with half & half, 1 1/2 tsp regular mustard powder instead of dijon, cayenne pepper instead of black (did not measure but a fair amount). Added a little (small pinch?) salt and 1-2 tsp onion powder. Used half sharp cheddar and half Mexican blend since other reviews to prevent graininess. Did not have excess sauce as some reported. Did take about ten minutes to thicken. Filled a 9X13 Pyrex dish nicely. Keeper.

The only change I made the first time was I left the Dijon mustard since I don't like it. The second time I made it was just the sauce to put on nachos. I think I'll add some green chile's next time. This time I mixed some salsa into it. I used the leftover sauce the next time over broccoli. LOVE this sauce.

Okay, so my dad and I tried this out and we went straight head-over-heels for this dish. We loved it so much, we went to the "lab" to find different ways to do this dish. For the cheeses, we combine half a triangle of asiago and two full blocks of sharp cheddar and sharp provolone. Instead of using actual mustard, we use 2 tsp of mustard powder, 2 tsp of wasabi powder (Penzey's Spices!!) and 2 tsp of white pepper (also at Penzey's!!) When throwing in the cheese, do it all at once and take an immersion blender to it (if you got one, not very expensive). Aside from these alterations, we followed the recipe to the teeth, and the LORD SAID IT WAS GOOD. Enjoy!

Modified based on other reviews (thanks!).  I wanted to make a mac n cheese that would definitely be kid and picky-eater friendly.  I whisked half a stick of butter and ww flour first.  Then whisked 1 cup warm broth in, then only 1 can of evaporated milk (also warmed) until bubbly.  Then stir in 1/2 cup parmesan, 1 can cheddar cheese soup, and about 1 lb fresh shredded cheddar stir until blended.  Add 1/2 & 1/2 to adjust thickness, if needed, and S&P to taste.  Excellent!  I have made 2x and wouldnt change a thing.  Big time cheese lover here and LOVE IT!  Also, the second time more comfy with recipe and  in a hurry - couldn't believe how quickly I pulled it together.  I always thought mac n cheese homemade took a long time to make, (thinking of baked mac) but it really doesn't on the stovetop.

i have made this multiple times for different events from BBQs to office parties and always a hit. But I make as directed then place in a large baking dish (350F) and sprinkle bread crumbs on top with a little parmasean cheese for 25 minutes.

I found this recipe to be just ok.  my husband thought it was fine.  but "fine" to me when i'm cooking just isnt what i'm wanting.  To be fair - I did not have sharp cheddar, i used what cheese i had on hand which was colby jack.  so i will try it again with the sharp cheddar and i'm sure that will change the flavor and spunk this recipe up.  if it does - i will change my rating.  and as some reviews state, it is almost too much sauch for the pasta.  i used med. shells - i will use elbow next time and make a bit more pasta.  PLEASE NOTE:  i do not like mustard, but it was only 1 1/2 tablespoons in all that cheese sauce (this does make a LOT), I found the tang it added a nice addition and had no problem with the mustard being overwhelming and I didnt even use sharp cheese so with my milder version, i did not find the mustard "too much".  try it!

I NEVER write reviews, but this macaroni and cheese is the most fantastic I've ever had. I followed the recipe to a t, except that I found it easier to make the sauce first and keep it warm while I made the pasta. And I used gluten-free pasta. Let me be clear, I am a macaroni and cheese snob. But this wins first prize hands down!

Very Very tasty!  Also very rich so it was better as a side dish as opposed to a main dish.  I made a half recipe of this dish because it's just me, my husband, and a little one and there was plenty with leftovers.  I'm not sure how anyone thought the dijon was overpowering, we could hardly taste it.  Anyway...a great mac and cheese and my husband said it was the best I've ever made!

This was great. It will replace my old mac n chese recipe. made it for Christmas and the whole family loved it.  Make sure you add salt to the water you use to boil the noodles. Did not have 2 cans of evaporated milk so used one can of evaporated milk and 12 oz of heavy cream, which i think I will continue to do

Creamy, tasty, quick and made with ingredients on hand, what more could you ask for!  I cut the recipe in half, with 7oz cheddar and 1 oz asiago in addition to the parmigiano cheese, and used small cylinder pastas for my young children.  The dijon is quite a strong flavor, so if you don't like it, cut back or omit.  I also used homemade turkey broth I'd frozen from Thanksgiving.  Served with peas and carrots, this is a keeper.

This came out pretty good. As far as taste, I thought there was plenty. I used one 8 oz package of shredded sharp cheddar and 1 8 oz of three different shredded cheddars. I also used 1/2 tsp of dry mustard instead of dijon. My husband tasted the sharpness right away. This was pretty good! Just make sure you serve immediately. I tried to reheat mine and it came out nothing like it did when I first made it, as is the case with most macaroni and cheeses.

I've been looking for a creamy mac-n-cheese recipe for ever! I FINALLY found it. This was GREAT!!! I just made it as a trial run and I love it. I did'nt put the mustard in (yuck) not in mac-n-cheese, and I think I'll use some mexican cheese along with the cheddar for a little more flavor. I also saved some cheese for the top and threw it under the broiler for a few minutes.....hubby loves a crust on top. This is definately a keeper.......so easy to make too! Gonna be a big hit for Thanksgiving!!!!

Yae!  One of the bests I have tried in awhile.  This tasted great and was very creamy.  It was good reheated and never dried out. The only thing I would prefer to do differently, would be to bake it and add some of the cheese for a topping.  Its a keeper!!!

I love this! I make a full batch on Sunday, and then portion it out and eat it on weekdays for a quick (unhealthy) lunch. I add ham and garlic powder, and skip the mustard. I also opt for whole grain pasta. if you skip the mustard i suggest putting something in to replace it because the sharp cheese needs to be cut with something or else it's overpowering. I think if you think the sauce to macaroni ratio is off, you're probably not boiling it down far enough.

Wow, this is a fantastic recipe! Not the best I've ever had, but this earns my five stars for ease of preparation, short time it takes to make, and taste. I like baked mac & cheese best but sometimes there just isn't time to make it and I really wanted a good go-to quick recipe that I could whip up at any time. This recipe fit the bill perfectly! It was creamy, rich, and wonderfully cheesey; everything macaroni and cheese should be. The Dijon mustard is a nice touch but I don't always have it on hand and you don't miss it. I actually like it better without. As for the evaporated milk, I'm not a big fan of using it so I used light cream (half n' half).   You should serve this as soon as the cheese has melted and the pasta has been stirred in. If you heat it for too long and keep stirring and stirring it the cheese will curdle. Not cool.  This recipe does make a ton and even though I halved it I still got a lot. Even so it didn't last long! Next time I'll add a bit more pasta since it was a little saucy but other then that it was perfect!

Ok recipe.  Increase the amount of noodles, decrease the amount of mustard to 1 tsp, whisk roux for at least 10 minutes, and add a little of the pasta cooking water to the sauce to make this a 5 star recipe.

I agree with the other posters that there would've been too much dijon mustard--I cut the amount down almost by half based on the reviews, and it was still fairly strong.  It did satisfy a quick mac & cheese craving though, and I'll make it again because my daughter enjoyed it.

This really is the best mac-n-cheese I have ever made.  Last night I made it for a pot luck and I overheard someone say that it was the best mac-n-cheese he has ever had in his life (he didn't know who made it when he said it).  This is a keeper for me!

Can't tell you how great this recipe is! A must for anyone who likes the "velveeta shells and cheese" texture. Super creamy, unlike any homemade mac & cheese I've tried.  I was a little intimidated by all of the changes people suggested in their reviews, but came up with a recipe that turned out great! I substituted veggie broth (for vegetarian friends) used one can of evaporated milk and 12 oz. of half & half, then added some garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and turmeric (about 1/2 tsp. each). Only used about 1 tsp. of mustard and it was fine. Used 8 oz. monterey jack cheese and 8oz. mild cheddar. It was still a little tangy, but that might have been from the parmesan. I may try an even milder cheese combo next time. I cooked the sauce for about 10-15 minutes and it turned out a bit thick, especially after adding the cheeses, so I would suggest maybe a shorter cooking time.

ok so granted I'm not the best cook, this recipie tasted pretty bad.  I'm almost positive it was the dijon mustard in it and I think would be 100x better without it.  I made this for my boyfriend (he LOVES homemade macaroni and cheese), and I only took one bite.  My boyfriend wanted to be polite and even then could only eat it if he doused it in salt.  If you make this, leave the dijon mustard OUT!!! I even put in less than recommended and it seemed to ruin the whole thing.:-(

First, I must say that my family just isn't big into mac and cheese.  However, this is an excellent mac n cheese recipe.  I have tried for years to find a good, CREAMY recipe that they would like and this is it!  I did make two changes that another reviewer suggested - I used half and half instead of evaporated milk, and I substituted 1 teaspoon of dry mustard for the Dijon mustard. It was perfect. It even passed the test for my picky 11 year old son! This really makes a lot, but I'm glad to have the leftovers.

I can't figure out why this didn't work for us when it was so highly rated. My boys are mac & cheese lovers (homemade and boxed), but they just couldn't eat this one. Seemed like way too much sauce for the amount of pasta, so it was far too cheesy, like eating straight fondue.

This was a very good recipe and would def. make it again.  The reason why I wouldn't give it a 5 star is that it lacked I believe sauted onions at the beginning.  I think that would add "omph" to this recipe.  I'll try and let ya know.

Not that this needs another good rating, but this was incredibly yummy.  The only changes I made were to add a can of cheddar cheese soup for a bit of extra cheesy flavor.  My dinner guests devoured it up and then begged for the leftovers.

I would like to rate this a 4 and a half!
Great instructions all the way to the end, but then I tasted it and it needed more cheese... use whatever type you like, but you will definitely need to add some more. (I added some Velveeta chunks and some nice creamy muenster!) Also, I used cavatappi pasta for a change of pace and it was a good choice
as all the corkscrew turns of the noodle
acted as nooks and crannies for the cheese to stick to! Good texture and creaminess... Will add this one to the archives, for sure!

Grainy?  Mine was almost chunky!  My toddler wouldn't touch it and he loves mac and cheese.  I even used about 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 sharp cheddar.  I didn't have evap. milk so I used skim.  I'm not sure if that made a difference as people were talking about how they used 1/2 evap. and 1/2 skim. 
  After reading other reviews, maybe it's because I thought I'd skip a step to make lunch faster, so I didn't bother heating the milk.  It heated up pretty fast in the pot though, and I made sure to whisk awhile.  It looked smooth and creamy, until I added the cheese.  Then it just started chunking up on me no matter how much whisking I did.  What a disappointment... I will probably have to throw it out if I can't find a way to save it.  Any ideas?

Holy Cow this was yummy.  I had leftover cheese cubes from a party platter, so I used a combo of cheddar, jalapeno jack, and colby cheddar along with the prescribed parmesan. I added tuna and broccoli to make it a main dish casserole and I think my husband is about to buy me a new car for my efforts!

This was good but with several modifications/additions. The sauce I think is best with a more substantial pasta - curly cavatappi is great. For a main dish, I added chopped ham and frozen peas and cooked at 350 for 15 minutes. Tuna fish might also work well for kids. As other reviewers have mentioned, without any additional ingredients it would be fine as a side but you wouldn't want to eat a whole plate full for dinner.

This is a good recipe, but I found the sauce to be too thick.  I used rotini because I was out of elbows. There was probably enough sauce for two boxes of pasta.  Maybe this is best as a side dish (I was just making it for a lunch).

This recipe is just what I've been looking for. I need to try it again though, with more than just colby-jack cheese on hand. It was certainly creamy, just had a bit too much monterey jack taste to it. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I followed everything to a T (though I did use un-chicken broth), but the texture was all wrong.  Instead of creamy it was sort of grainy.  Like the cheese didn't melt properly. I baked it for about 30 min.  The cheese wasn't creamy or stringy but it tasted really good.  The broth gave it a more earthy and complex flavor.  Yummy.

Boxed mac and cheese will no longer be found in this house!  Really good and easy to make.  A definite hit with the kids.  My only complaint is that it makes a whole lot more than lunch for mom and two kids.  We have LOTS of leftovers.

I've been making this for years.  My kids love it.  In fact, my visiting college student begged for this for dinner.  The key is to cook the roux (flour and butter mixture) long enough.  You've got to get the flour browned and toasty-smelling before adding the milk/broth mixture.    If you add the milk before getting the flour cooked, it will be grainy.

I've made this recipe a few times, and generally find it comes out with twice as much sauce as you need if you follow the directions (and I LIKE) a saucy mac & cheese. I tend to use half again or double the amount of pasta, and that seems to work out okay. I make it with veggie broth and a little onion salt replacing half of the dijon, which itself is replaced by dry mustard. I also usually leave out the parmesan. Usually turns out great!

Fantastic.  Made this for a party & it was a big hit.  I believe the secret to any Mac & cheese is the quality of the cheese.  I cut the mustard to 1Tbsp and split the 1lb of cheddar into 3 different types.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's a hit every time. This recipe is fantastic as it is but it is also versatile. I have added any number of combinations of spices, meats and vegetables to make it a complete meal. My family's favourite though, is made with old cheddar (nearly doubled) and a little extra pasta for the resulting extra sauce.

I love this website, but am guilty of not taking the time to rate recipes.  However, I had to make an exception for his one. It was excellent.  My husband, who does not even like mac & cheese, raved about it.  He ate three helpings and asked me to make it again. I did add a little more cheese and I only had one can of evaporated milk so that is what I used, but it turned out awesome.

Followed the recipe exactly. Consistency was great, not grainy at all. Taste is terrible. Served it at a family BBQ. Not one person liked it.

Very good base. With some adjustments to elevate flavors excellent. I get compliments and requests for the recipe frequently, and it's a hit with both kids and adults. This is not diet food, but if you're going for an awesome mac n cheese try this!

-Substitute whole milk for evaporated. 
-Use dry mustard instead to taste.
-Add onion (1/4-1/3 c) chopped fine and lightly sautéed. 
-Really heap the cheeses and add mozzarella for extra creaminess. It rounds the sharpness of the cheddar and parmesan.  Or add Gruyere for a different flavor layer.

-Option: add a few dashes of hot sauce if you're serving adults
-Option: add 1 tsp "Better Than Bullion" chicken to the broth (and decrease salt as needed)

Reheats well, can add a bit of skim milk to get creaminess back if it's dry.

I've made a lot of mac n cheese (kids!) and have found the best is made on the stovetop. When you start baking pasta all that cheesy goodness gets absorbed into the macaroni resulting in dry tasteless mac n cheese. Nothing dry or tasteless about this recipe.Yum!

Tadaaaa!!!!!!!!!!  I absolutely enjoyed this!  I have been making macaronia & cheese for many years.  This was the best I've ever made.  So creamy & delicious!  Panara Bread makes a creamy, delicious macaroni & cheese JUST like this; except they charge you $5.00 for about 4 ounces!  I must admit that I too ommited the mustard (that scared me).  Still it was total perfection.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this macaroni and cheese twice now and it was loved by all both times!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe verbatim with the exception of the Dijon mustard.  It's not really a taste that I associate with classic macaroni and cheese, so I opted to leave it out and it turned out great.  The second time I made it, I included dustings of garlic powder and Cajun seasoning to give it some kick and it was even better than before.  To those who have remarked that it was too saucy, simply make it ahead of whatever else you're preparing for the meal and let it sit on a warm burner for a while; it'll thicken up very nicely.  Also, who complains about having to stir too much?  This has like four cups of cheese AND flour in it.  What do you expect!?  Overall, this is an easy, delicious side dish that has a lot of potential for customization.

Very good.  I used one cup of chicken broth and one can of evaporated milk because several reviews mentioned too much liquid that had to be cooked down. I added 1/2 tsp ground mustard instead of the 1 1/2 T mustard.  I also added a pound of frozen broccoli (cooked with the pasta for the last five minutes) and a cooked, cubed chicken breast.  I had planned on putting this in a casserole to bake, but the sauce was thick enough that it didn't need to be cooked down and the mixture was hot enough to serve.  I added 1/2 cup of water to leftovers to thin the sauce, thinking the passta will absorb additional fluid.  Next time I'll try 1 tsp dry mustard and plan on 2 cups of chicken broth  with one can of evaporated milk.  Leftovers are in the freezer for DH to take to work; I warned him it might separate but he's looking forward to leftovers for work.

This is the best Mac'n'cheese recipe I have had yet.  The only way it could be creamier is if you used the Velveeta plasticheese, and then it would not taste good.  I leave out the mustard because, to me, macaroni and cheese should be mellow, not "zingy."

Husband said "It was all right."  I agreed.  It took a lot of whisking.  We decided we liked my own version better which is baked.

GREAT recipe! I followed it exactly as stated and made sure to whisk for 20 minutes to ensure that the sauce was not gritty. I could not be happier with this dish. I did not bake it because I served it as a side dish and put toppings out for people to customize their own servings with bacon, jalapenos, diced ham, breadcrumbs, shrimp, and hot sauce.

I halved the recipe because I have a small family and added a 1/2 tsp of sea salt and left out the Dijon and used lower fat cheddar.  It was GREAT!  It is very similar (but better) than the mac and cheese my toddlers love at Jason's Deli.  Yum!  I would have added the Dijon and pepper, but I thought the kids would like it better plain.

This is my first ever recipe rating but I had to weigh in on this dish.  This was the best homemade mac and cheese that I've ever made.  My picky family devoured it.  The next day I used the leftovers to make fried mac & cheese balls - scoop and roll into balls and place on a sheet pan, freeze for about 2 hours.  Dip into egg wash then italian breadcrumbs.  Let sit for a few minutes and repeat this step.  Thaw on a sheet for about 90 minutes then fry at 350 for 2 - 3 minutes.  Time consuming but easy and as close to fried food heaven as I can imagine.  
Thanks again for the great recipe!!!

While I like the recipe, I still wanted it to be more flavorful and creamy. Instead, I suspect from parmesan cheese, it was still grainy in texture. It needs some more salt, has a slightly sweet taste (evaporated milk, or dijon mustard?) , and maybeq more pepper. One pan cooking was good. Though, I did pour it into an aluminum pan at 350 for 15-20 min to let it set and keep warm while I fried chicken. This made it more solid than a creamy noodles dish. Thus, the creaminess mentioned above may be my own fault.

I scaled this down to 4 servings but used about 9oz of whole wheat macaroni shells. Even still, there was way too much sauce! I skipped the step of dumping the noodles on a cookie sheet and I only added a bit of dijon mustard. I found that the sauce was a little too rich for our liking. Next time, I will try this recipe with skim milk in place of the evaporated milk and either scale the recipe down to 3 or add even more macaroni noodles.

This is a very good recipe. I read other reviews and was worried about it resulting grainy... So I whisked it from beginning to end and ended up with a really good creamy sauce. This recipe cooks really fast, so I would recommend having the ingredients pre-measured and just ready to pour into the saucepan. I would give it 5 stars, except that eating more than a half cup serving felt like too much good stuff. OH, and another thing.. I cooked sliced hot dog wieners on the side and added it to the finished dish. Very good! My husband said that was the best part of the dish.

Okay I didn't use the Dijon mustard because of other reviewers.  I did use 1/2 tsp of mustard powder in its place.  I followed everything else and did throw in a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  The taste was fine but the grainy texture was really annoying.  I took the advice and boiled the flour mixture for at least 10 minutes but it still didn't help.  I'm going to give this another run but with just 2 tbsp of flour... I'll comment back when I do...

I would rate this zero stars.  If you like the bixed mac & cheese then this might be the right recipe for you.  I found the cheese and dijon overwhelming in this recipe and I love both.  There is more cheese sauce than there is pasta.  In my opinion, this was a goop of melted cheese.

Tasted pretty good, but something was missing..not sure what. I have to say this recipe gets 5 stars for ease of preparation. My search for the perfect Mac N Cheese recipe continues. 
Also, the instructions never told me what temperature to melt the cheese mixture on. It made it seem like the burner should be off....? So I just did it on med/low.

Very tasty recipe! It was a little too thick but yummy! We used half & half instead of condensed milk, but I think next time we will try half Velveeta and half shredded cheese and half and half. Either way , we will definitely be making this again! :) Thanks!

Not terrible but not what I expected.  The sauce was way to thick and gritty.  Not what I call creamy.  Read the reviews and just not up to my 3 & 5 years standards.  If you love mac & cheese, this one is not for you.

This was really a great recipe! Everyone loved it especially me because not only was it delicious, it was quick and easy and you only dirty up one pot! I did change one thing though I used dry mustard instead of the dijon. This is just a taste preference for me since I had tried it in other mac and cheese recipes. I will keep this recipe! Bravo!

This is SIMPLE and fabulous!  I used 1 and 3/4 cans of evaporated milk.  You can always add more in to thin if you so desire.  As well, you can use just about any cheese in place of the parmesan.  I use 1/2 cup of velveeta cheese.  For a toddler version, omit all the spices.    You can go crazy with this recipe as a base for an adult version (add taco meat to it, add chicken and peas to it, add crab meat to it etc, etc)

I loved this recipe - it was so creamy and delicious - to die for!  After reading many of the reviews, I decided to omit the mustard.  Other that that, I followed the recipe to a T.

I followed the recipe exactly for lunch today.  My husband and middle son thought it was the best mac and cheese they had ever had(BY FAR!).  My daughter and I prefer baked mac with crunchy breadcrumbs so we just thought it was okay.  Not this recipes fault, though! While I love dijon mustard, my daughter and I didn't like it in this...even though it's a small amount.  Also, this serves 10 as a side dish not a main course.

This is the PERFECT mac and cheese!! My husband is a huge mac and cheese lover and he loved it. This definitely replaces the old recipes I have been using. I did change a few things based off others reviews. 1. I used 12oz of evaporated milk and 12oz of cream. 2. I did use 1/4 tsp of dried mustard. 3. I also cooked it for 10 minutes. 4. I used 2 cups of mild cheddar, 1cup of mozzarella, and 1 cup of sharp cheddar. 5. I also baked it for 30 minutes topped with bread crumbs. Will probably be making it a few times a month now. Thanks for all the helpful reviews from everyone.

The sauce was very thick and bland -- the taste of the mustard overwhelmed it.  Next time I'd ditch the evaporated milk and the mustard, substitute 1% milk for the evaporated and reduce by half.

Okay, but not great. I like both creamy and baked mac & cheese, but this one didn't turn out as creamy as I hoped from the picture. I used regular milk, but I don't think that was the problem since other reviewers did as well. The sauce turned out very stringy and grainy. I know some people said to use Velveeta to combat that, but to me the whole point of making home made mac & cheese is to use real cheese.

this was super creamy and fairly easy to make.  I followed the recipe but instead of all sharp cheddar I did half sharp cheddar and half jack cheese.  Everyone ate it up.

My family loved it. Next time, I think I will cut back on the mustard, or use the regular yellow because the flavor came through a little strong for my taste. Otherwise, it worked for what I was trying to accomplish.

This has a good, strong flavor, depending upon your choice of cheese.  I ended up cooking mine much longer than suggested.  The adults really liked it, the kids, not so much.

OMG I am a good cook and pride myself on my baked Mac and Cheese..but this took the cake.  My niece 5 and I made this together.  She is a child who eats nothing.  It was easy, unique and we had to pull the spoon away from her at dinner before she got sick.  I asked my niece while cooking it did she think it was missing anything,  and she said it needs a lil cinnamon:)  Thank goodness we just followed the DELICIOUS recipe.  New family favorite.

This recipe makes a rich sauce, however, it only makes enough for 3/4 pound of pasta.  Also, when I made it I didn't have evaporated milk so I substituted whole milk instead; it turned out fine.  Also, cut the amount of dijon mustard in half , use 1 tsp. pepper and omit the salt as there is enough in the cheese.  Using all sharp cheddar makes a very strong sauce so next time I make it I will use part regular cheddar or colby instead. You may have to thin the sauce out with a little milk as well.

I am sad.  I am usually known for bringing great food to the office for potlucks.  I even read "Cheese Sauce Made Easy" in the AllRecipes Top Related Articles to insure mine wouldn't turn out grainy.  Although the texture is fine, the taste just seems "off".  I am in the process of trying deciding whether or not to add Cheese soup as some have suggested just to try to salvage this dish.  As of right now, I won't be taking this dish to the office.  I don't want to lose my reigning potluck crown, if you know what I mean.  This carries the lowest rating I have left on a recipe on this site.

I am the queen of giving recipes 5 stars, but this one just did not taste good to us. My husband is a mac and cheese FREAK and loves anything with cheese, but not this one. I am an experienced cook, and had no problems with the look of the dish...my husband and I just didn't care for the taste of cheddar and parmesan together with the milk/chicken broth mixture (and dijon). Even the consistency of the flour/butter/broth mixture was perfect.

This is the ONLY mac and cheese I eat :)  We added it to our traditional Christmas dinner and it is always a hit.  I have found it great to prepare this a few hours early and then transfer it to my crockpot on the keep warm setting. It doesn't dry out and is still as delish as when I first made it.

I needed a stove top mac & cheese recipe and this was excellent. A couple of changes I made...left out the mustard (personal preference) and used skim milk in place of evaporated (didn't have any on hand). I stirred constantly and it took about 10 minutes for sauce to thicken. Also...I used a combination of sharp cheddar, colby, and mont.jack cheeses. Kids loved it.

I usually love ANY kind of homemade mac and cheese but this was just ok. It was WAY too cheesey for my family. I actually didn't even use all the cheese sauce either. I put the noodles in a big bowl and started adding the cheese sauce and I'm glad I stopped putting all of it in cause it was just way too much! I did leave out the mustard for lack of not having any and maybe thats why we thought it was lacking in flavor. I guess a good base recipe but I'll stick with my original recipe

I thought this macaroni and cheese was really yummy! William liked it as well. It does make ALOT of macaroni and cheese but leftovers are always good. I only had 1 can of evaporated milk so for the other can i just used regular milk which seemed to be fine. Also i didnt use the dijon mustard i used the mustard powder ( i dont think that is the right name but i am having a moment when i cant think of what it is called) i only used about a 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of that. I do recommend this recipe and it was very easy to make!! Also i had to stir for about 10-15 minutes.

This is a huge family favorite, and the base of a recipe that I make that is frequently requested for birthday dinners in my family.  I make it as described, but use 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 Pepper jack cheese.  I also add in 1 T of cajun spices (I have my own blend.  I suppose a commercial one might work).    Then, on the side, I make a jambalya mix.  Saute a couple of cubed chicken breasts in olive oil, then add sliced peppers, chopped onion, chopped tomato, sliced cajun sausage, and 2 T cajun spice blend till cooked through, then throw in 1/2 lb of shrimp and cook till the shrimp is done.  You can mix both pots together, or serve them separately so that people can choose their own proportion of meat.  It's totally awesome.

I would give this 10 stars if I could! This is the absolute best mac and cheese recipe. I love that you don't have to bake it, too.  It's creamy, rich, and sooooo yum! Total comfort food. I made it as stated, except I used colby cheese and subbed a few shakes of ground mustard in place of the dijon. This is the only homemade mac and cheese recipe for us. It's our absolute favorite, and I've been searching for along time! Thank you sooo much for posting this recipe!

I live for great mac and cheese, and this recipe is AWESOME. It makes a LOT of sauce so i recommend adding a cup and a half more pasta to keep the cheese from being overwhelming. I also did not add the dijon. This recipe is good fresh, but its EVEN better reheated the next day.

I made this w/ a few changes.  Used half & half instead of milk, dry mustard & added fontina cheese.  I did bake it in the oven for about 30 min & added a breadcrumb topping.  It was a big hit.

I made this recipe several times throughout my pregnancy; it really took care of all the cravings I had for "comfort food."  I prefer to use mustard powder which gives a little bit of zip.  This recipe makes a lot of sauce, so I use about 2/3 and save the rest for when it is reheated in the microwave.  It keeps it nice and creamy every time.

AWESOME recipe; I tried this after getting tired of struggling to make Alton Brown's baked mac n' cheese recipe come out right. I did make a few alterations: I substituted 1 pint of half and half instead of all the evaporated milk, I used 1 t dry mustard instead of the Dijon, I omitted the Parmesan entirely, and I added a few chunks of Velveeta. I also used mild cheddar instead of sharp because my brother doesn't like sharp, but I bet the sharp would be great (or even half mild and half sharp).

This is fantastic, the first creamy mac n cheese recipe I've made and it is, in fact, 'so easy!' I used gluten-free flour and only 1 can evaporated milk.
And I realized I didn't have a whisk (new house) but it was ok! I just added a very small amt of hot milk/broth to the butter/flour, stirred till doughy, added another small amt milk/broth, stirred again, etc until it was all gradually stirred in. Also topped with finely chopped sauteed ham and onion, added a bit of extra cheese, and put it under the grill/broiler.  THANKS for a great recipe!

I loved the creaminess of this Mac and Cheese Recipe!  The only complaint I had from my family was the mustardy taste!  Next time I will leave the mustard out but that is the beauty of cooking!  You can change and create to make your own "family recipe"!

I didn't love this, I agree with some of the others, kinda grainy.  I also didn't love the mustardy taste.  I think next time I'll do it with about half the mustard.

This recipe was made as part of a search for a mac and cheese that my daughter loves from a local store. She said this one was "okay" but not the same taste as the store one. I followed the recipe as written and it did not become grainy at all. It did not reheat well the next day.

This mac and cheese is de-lish! I did change a couple things though. I used half evaporated milk and half regular milk and I used 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder instead of the dijon. It was perfect. Thick and creamy. (Add more milk in the end if you like the sauce thinner.)

This turned out to be okay because it had a bit different flavor than your typical mac and cheese.  However, we found that the chicken broth flavor was too strong and made it a bit too salty.  I may try again using half as much chicken broth.

Delicious! I'm not a big fan of the cakey mac n' cheese with a big crust of cheddar on top...I like it creamy, so this was perfect. I did change a few things: I cut the evap milk down to just one can and substituted skim for the rest, to avoid the heavy evap-milk flavor. I also only put a couple of squeezes of the mustard, and only a pinch of salt. It turned out fantastic! It does make a ton, so cut it in half if you're only cooking for one or two. I made the full version and ate it for 3 days (with my husband's help). Will definitely make this again.

I liked it quite a bit, very creamy. I halved the recipe and used a mix of sharp cheddar and regular cheddar and jack cheese so it wouldn't be grainy.  I also used fat free evaporated milk.  

My daughter, the real mac and cheese lover, didn't care for it "too mustardy tasting" I would agree that it was pretty obvious that there was dijon in there, so although I enjoyed it, I'd cut back to 1/2 the mustard.  
Overall,very creamy, tasty, and not difficult to make

Definately for cheese lovers!
After reading the reviews I did make some minor changes:
I didnt use evaporated milk. I dont like it. So I used just regular 2%.
I used 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/2 colby/montery jack, and a nice chunk of velveeta.
I did put oil and sea salt in the water to boil the noodles. I did also leave out the mustard all together. 
I just added a few personal spices. Pepper, garlic, etc.
It was the best mac & cheese & creamy. Yumm-o. I absolutely love it. Everybody else that ate it loved it, and wanted the recipe.
Thanks for sharing

Loved this recipe!!  I did add a couple of teaspoons of hot sauce for a little kick and used dry mustard instead of the Dijon.  Very creamy - great Christmas Eve side served with a honey baked ham for a large family.  I did increase the recipe to accommodate 15 servings which fits nicely into  a 13" x 9" cassarole for table service.  Thanks very much for this awesome recipe!

I am giving this 4 stars with the changes I made. First, I used Barilla Plus multigrain elbow pasta (with all sorts of good stuff in them!) I used a combo of Mont Jack and extra sharp chedder cheese. I only used one small dash of mustard (thanks to other reviewers suggestions.) It's a good thing I didn't add more since I could taste the mustard with even a dash. Next time I will omit the mustard. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a kick. It took a LONG time on the stove, but came out super creamy and made a ton! We will be eating this for a while.
Thanks!

Very good recipe!! My family loved it. I did add 1/4 C moz. cheese and a 1/4 C of parm cheese along with the regular amount of cheddar. Also, I took some wheat bread slices and broke them into tiny pieces, toated them with the broiler and sprinkled them on top of the mac and cheese. Adds great flavor to an already amazing dish!!

I was looking for a recipe that the kids could eat instead of Kraft Dinner. I think this recipe foots the bill, however, when making this for kids I would omit the Dijon mustard.

Not a huge hit with the teenage crowd at my house, but then again, they prefer the stuff that comes out of the blue box and that is a lot less involved. They'll stick with that, I'll go back to my baked version.

This truly is a terrific recipe. The sharp chedder cheese flavor is tangy and omnipresent.The noodle melt in your mouth and everyone loved it. It also freezes well. I reheted in waterproof air tight bag in boiling water and added a little milk to make oit more creamy.

Very easy and good!  Took this to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone ate it up!  I used mild cheddar and a little less dijon (my kids don't like that sharp/tangy taste) and it came out perfect!
Thanks for such an easy recipe!

Pro's: super creamy and saucy, pretty pale yellow color, great blend of cheeses used  
Con's: flavors did not meld well together, the chicken broth taste was overwhelming. 

I will use a variation of this recipe in the future but will probably use all milk instead of evaporated milk and chicken broth.

Added paprika, needs a bit more flavor (salt & pepper).  Used heavy cream insgtead of milk as other reviewers suggested.  Very good, very creamy.   Just seems to be missing a certain something to punch it over the edge.

Made this on Sunday exactly as directed except I spread Panko breadcrumbs soaked in butter over top and baked it for 30 minutes before serving. I loved it!  Hubby not so much but he never gets very enthused about macaroni and cheese dishes so I'm going to ignore his apathy.  This recipe makes a ton so next time I will cut it in half.  There will definitely be a next time. Very cheesy, easy to prepare and the leftovers make great lunches. Thanks for posting.

This was a great recipe. Great for shindigs. I wont use as much flour next time...it just kept getting thicker and thicker and eventually it was a very dry dish in my opinion, but I am very picky. I had no complains from others, only praise. I just added more milk thoughout the evening and that kept it creamy. 
Spiced it up with some horseradish sauce and jalapenos. Double batch was all gone by the end of the night.

I made this for my kids and myself as my husband hates Mac and Cheese, plus I had pretty much everything on hand.  I more or less halved the recipe.  I used the rest of the box of Macaroni, 2 tbs of butter (only because that was what was left in the stick), and a block of extra sharp cheddar which I shredded.  It did make a TON of sauce, I needed about a cup more noodles.  

My son who's three said he loved it better than the box, my daughter said that she liked it but liked the box better.  I put extra cheese in the box mix as it is so it was similar in taste but creamier.  I'll have the leftovers soon so I hope it heats up nicely.

This was fine. It did come out super creamy but I thought the chicken broth flavor a bit much. I wonder if vegetable broth would improve it. Will try that next time.

Okay, so I have tried literally 10 different recipes and for some reason I always fail. This is as close to what my kids get from the box mac and cheese. I hit a home run with this recipe! Love it! One thing I would change is a 1/4 cup less liquid. I use heavy cream instead of the condensed milk, it made this mac and cheese really creamy.

This is my first review here, and I just needed to say that this mac and cheese is unbelievable!  I don't like dijon mustard, but my girlfriend is a fan, so I just used 1/2 tsp, and it was enough to give the recipe that dijon taste without being over powering.  Next time I would probably leave it out all together, and then she can spoon some on top afterwards if she wants.  Other than that, extremely creamy and cheesy.  I used Tillamook extra sharp (black label), and it was just boarding on too sharp.  Next time I think Im going to use 1/2 pound of sharp and 1/2 pound of medium.  This makes mac n cheese that is very comparable to "Amy's" mac n cheese that you can find in the frozen health food departments.  Except for fresh of course.

Excellent recipe.  My family did not care for the mustard, however, I did.  Great recipe for someone who has never made mac & cheese from scratch before.

Mac and Cheese is my favorite food ever, but this was just plain nasty. It was very gritty, and I even followed the other users ideas. I don't know what I could even do to this to make it better. :(

Soooo delicious!!! The best thing about this recipe is the fact that it doesn't get too dry. When I'm making homemade Mac and chees I'm going to a party so it will inevitably sit for a bit. This recipe is so moist that it doesn't dry out. I changed a few things. I followed Carsonmacmommy's advice and whisked away to prevent graininess.  I used 1 can of evaporated milk but substituted sourcream and heavy cream for the rest of the milk. After it was ready I put it in a 13x9 casserole and sprinkled ritz crackers on top.  Broil for just a few mins. Yummy"!!!!  You could use any cheese in this recipe. Next time I'm trying pepper jack for a spicy Mac and cheese

I really loved this mac and cheese.  I did not have dijon mustard and used a tiny bit of yellow mustard in it's place.  Also, did not have Parmesan cheese, but next time will definitely make sure I try it will all ingredients.  I added some buttered bread crumbs bc that is one of my favorites with mac n cheese.
Thanks for a easy quick recipe that tastes awesome.

I am glad I read it wrong and only added 1 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard. I added two eggs and only used one can of evaporated milk. I my husband and I thought it was really good this way.

This is awesome!  The only adjustment I made to the recipe is adding a little vegetable or olive oil to the boiling water before you add your noodles, to keep them from sticking.  Then when you strain them you can just leave them in the strainer til you need them again, and save on dishes!

This is one of my all time favorite things to make. It's also one of my most requested dishes from friends and family for holidays, or any occasion. 

Of course I substitute a few things: I use Heavy Cream (instead of evaporated milk) and 1 TBSP Ground Mustard (instead of dijon). And I think the more cheeses you mix in, the better so I'll use a lbs of shredded cheese as directed, but a mix of cheeses (gouda, mozzerella, cheddar, colby, etc... anything I have on hand works nicely).

At the end, I'll add already cooked pieces of bacon in mine as well. Then I top with More shredded cheese and buttered Panko Bread crumbs and broil until the top is browned. Everyone I serve this to loves this!

I did not care for this at all. After spending a long time reading all reviews and taking notes i made this to suggestions. I will have to say all of the reviews failed to mention that the Parmesan cheese is way too much. i wouldn't make this unless you like tangy mac and cheese. I think i will stay will Velveeta & shells .

Bacon makes this dish perfect. I also like to add a panko breading on top and broil it to finish. I've also added lobster to this mac and cheese with different varieties of cheeses for Valentine's day. It was amazing!

It does make a lot of sauce... a little more than the noodles can handle.

Very tasty recipe! I substituted many items but kept the basic steps and ingredients. First I changed out the evaporated milk with half and half and also added 1/2 cup wine to the ingredients. I did not included the dijon mustard and also added 6 cloves of garlic. Instead of sharp cheddar we substituted Monterrey Jack, mozzarella and Gruyere all mixed together. It was delicious!!!

I'm embarrassed to say that I used my grandmother's mac & cheese recipe for 10 years, and now this is my go-to recipe! I LOVE it! I have made it both with evaporated milk and with regular fresh milk, both equally good. I use all sharp cheddar cheese and haven't had a problem with the grittiness that other reviewers describe.

absolutely fantastic! I don't include the dijon mustard, I didn't have it the first time I made it and never bothered to add it. I've made this so much that I don't measure any part of it anymore. It's so quick and so easy! It never lasts long, and if I take it to someone's house for dinner it is always a big hit!

This mac and cheese was I guess just a little to creamy for my crew.  It has a lot of sauce that it seems like the noodles just swim in. It was hard to get the kids to eat it and I ended up with a lot of leftovers.  this recipe makes a lot of mac and cheese so make sure you either scale it down or have a hungry crowd.

I have had a lot of mac and cheese recipes but this is the best, although I did not add the dijon mustard. It was simply the best yet.

I made this without the mustard and paremesan cheese (I had neither) and it came out great. Also did the milk/broth mixture on the stove. Leftovers turned out pretty good as well. Next time I'll use more variety of cheese : )

I didn't have 2 cans of evaporated milk, so I used 1 can and 12 oz of regular milk. I also added some cooked ham and green beans to round out the meal. All in all, it turned out very nicely. Tasty!

Wow! So delicious, and the simplest scratch mac and cheese I've tried! I love how canned milk is used (we don't always have milk in the house) and only one burner/pot is taken up on the stove. I also loved the Parmesan cheese, I didn't think I'd taste the difference but it really rounds out the sharp cheddar. Mine wasn't grainy at all with sharp cheddar as written but I made sure to melt the butter/whisk in the flour on low heat so as not to scald the roux. Once I added the broth/milk I cranked it up to medium and had a bubbly sauce in 5 minutes or so. The only changes I made were to sub garlic powder, ground mustard and a tiny bit of cayenne for the Dijon because I hate jarred mustard. Will make this my standard mac for the flavor and super convenience of the recipe, thank you so much for sharing :)

very good and creamy. I used what I had on hand and everyone loved it. Used ground mustard instead, and 1% milk instead of the evaporated milk.The cheese I had only mexican shreddered style,it tasted great to us. The next time I will try it with evaporated milk to see the difference.

fab-u-lous!  I always read the reviews before trying a recipe and I'm glad I did.  I used dry mustard instead of dijon, 8 oz of sharp cheddar & 8 oz of mont/jack cheese and added a can of cheddar cheese soup mixed with the rest of the can of chicken broth.  The result was fantastic!!  Next time I may bake it abit with a crumb topping....a fav of my husband.

I've made this twice and it gets rave reviews. Some changes I make. Melt the butter. I use 1/2 stick. Add the flour. I use 1/4 cup. I mix that and add Mirin Rice Wine (not vinegar). I probably use 1/4 cup. I then add the mustard and rest of the ingredients. I use 3 tsp of the Dijon mustard. I use 1.5 bags of 5-cheese Italian mix and 2 bags of sharp cheddar. I used 2 bags of mac.

This was good.  I didn't bother putting the cooked noodles on a cookie sheet.  I cut this recipe in half and my fam was wishing for more.  The texture is different from the usual baked mac and cheese recipes i make.  I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time and finally did.  Evap. milk makes it ultra-creamy; you could probably get away with using evap skim milk and it would still be good.

I have always loved Mac & Cheese.  However, I have grown tired of the powdered cheese in the Mac & Cheese box.  This cheese, was absolutely PERFECT!  The cheese is thick!  That is exactly what I was looking for.  I am also one that opted out the Dijon Mustard.  With just a splash of garlic instead, this dish turned out amazing.  And Wow... it is filling!

Thank you for this recipe.. My family and I absolutely love it. It makes enough for 5 hungry people and is the perfect 'comfort' food. It tastes amazingly like stouffers, but my family likes it even better.  The only change I make is leaving out the mustard. Just a personal preference.  Again, thank you! :o)

This was quite good.  I also used milk and added some garlic powder.  The suggestion of a tsp of dry mustard worked well, too.  I had some pre-wrapped cheese slices on hand, so added about 6 slices. I would make this again.

This was pretty yummy.  My BF and I both enjoyed it.  He said it was "like Swanson's, only better."  My one year old wouldn't eat it, but since he won't eat anything that shouldn't negatively reflect on the recipe.  I halved the recipe and still had a ton leftover.  I wasn't too sure how it would reheat in the microwave, but I poured a little milk on it before reheating, and then stirred it up good once it was hot.  It was delicious the second time around and not at all dried out. I also used dry mustard powder instead of the dijon.  I will make again, although only occasionally as it is a little sinful.

this was good and has potential, but it's way too thick.  Next time I will try regular milk instead of evapo milk.  I think it may help add more water.   I also added bacon and it was really good that way.  I used jumbo macaroni, next time I will buy smaller macaronis.

This was just okay.  My daughter, who is a mac and cheese NUT, loving ANY variety, said "eh."  I think less Dijon, and a mild cheddar (we prefer sweet cheese to piquant in macaroni dishes) would have made it preferable.   The ratio of sauce to pasta, though, was way to high!  Who wants to eat mac and cheese soup? (okay, my girl, but she's the exception!)

I loved this. My husband wasn't so wild about it, but for me, the creamier and cheesier my mac & cheese is, the better. I used half & half instead of evaporated milk due to availability - still delicious though. I'm looking forward to trying it as written though as I'm sure, somehow, it'll be even better!

If I could give it zero stars, I would. It had no flavor at all, was very grainy. I love homemade mac 'n cheese normally - going back to my other recipe.

I came on here looking for a recipe for a bunch of things. I tried this out tonight not expecting to like it (i'm a very picky eater) but i was pleasantly surprised.   I used one cup of Mozzarella. Didn't even use extra-sharp chedder (i picked up the wrong kind - but it would have been TOO much cheese) but it came out great.  I loved it. Was definitely more creamy than i'd ever had before.

Made with chicken base and 2 cans skimmed evaporated milk; also used dry mustard per other reviews. I made this twice before submitting my review, and like others, I found that after adding the cheese, I still needed to thin-out the mixture by adding about 1-1/2 cups regular milk. This is a wonderful recipe and I give it rave reviews!

I think this would have been a little bland w/o changes. My changes were as follows: 1/2 sharp cheddar, 1/4 velveeta & 1/4 romano; added 2 C. broth; used dry mustard instead of dijon; added 1 Tbls paprika, 1 Tbls white pepper and a little garlic salt - no other salt needed. I mixed cheese sauce & noodles together and poured all into a butter-lined 9x13 pan and baked for 40 min. at 350. With these changes it was fabulous - bubbly and creamy!

I halved the evap. milk and used dry mustard per the remarks here and was left with a dry mess.  I also used kraft parmesean and it ended up very gritty.  I give it 3 stars because it might be good if I followed the recipe instead of comments on this webpage.

I was looking for a Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese recipe that would satisfy my craving for my favorite dish at a local restaurant. I used this recipe as a base and matched it PERFECTLY! I used heavy cream instead of condensed, 'Light n Fluffy' noodles instead of traditional macaroni, I cut the amount of broth from 1 cup to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of Frank's Red Hot. I eliminated the dijon mustard and substituted it with 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, and finally I used Gorgonzola crumbles instead of Parmasean cheese (1/2 cup). I also threw in some cooked chicken (thin sliced 1 inch pieces that I bought -Tyson's refrigerated grilled chicken). I added the chicken and Gorgonzola at the end after I mixed the noodles and sauce together. Awesome dish. Not too spicy at all.

I am a bit mixed on this recipe.  My husband and I liked it, the kids hated it.  The parmesan flavor was rather strong probably why the kids did not enjoy.  There was too much liquid in this one with the 24 oz of milk and cup on broth because I had enough sauce for two pounds of pasta.  I would cut that down if I try again this would also bring out more of the cheddar.  It was very cream as the name says, but not much flavor.

I was soooo disappointed in this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1 pound of ground beef.  It was very bland, and even with the noodles al dente, was pastey.  My family, who is normally easy to cook for and likes most things, threw their helping out.

This was way to creamy for me, almost soupy and the mustard was just too overpowering.

This was the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had! I made it for Thanksgiving, and my children devoured it. It was so easy too. I threw it together after the turkey was done. I did omit the mustard because my kids would not have liked it, but, otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. This will be a dish on our Thanksgiving table for years to come.

Loved it!  I used 1/4 tsp dry mustard instead of dijon and only 1/4 cup parmesean cuz that's all I had.  It did take about 15 min for the milk mix to thicken and boil.  Not too saucy for my taste, will make again.

This was a great recipe.  I used 8 oz. Velveeta and 8 oz. mild cheddar.
I also used 1 can evaporated milk and 1 can regular milk, it makes it not so sticky.
This is even better as leftovers - if I need to, I just add a little milk in as I microwave it.  Delicious!

Very creamy. 

I used both white cheddar and extra sharp along with the parmesan. I added a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce and a large spoonful of sour cream. I didn't use both cans of evaporated milk, the sauce was the right consistancy for me with just the chicken broth and the one can of milk. I took another cook's suggestion and only used one tsp. of dijon mustard, as I didn't want it to overpower the whole dish. I used this recipe for Macaroni and Cheese with Bacon and Onions as suggested.

I'd make this again.

Made this tonight for dinner. Every body loaded up on it! It was great. Went well with a loaf of home made bread.I did change the Dijon mustard out for ground mustard.
Next time I make this, I'll add broccoli florets.

I just made this tonight for my Husband and I and it was fantastic.  I took the suggestion of reducing the mustard but also took the liberty of adding a bit of Cayenne and Paprika.  I have also had a hard time making homemade mac n cheese just like mom used to, but this recipe definately measures up!  Fantastic recipe!!!

Very creamy and easy to make. However my family wanted more spices and next time I think I will only do half sharp and half mild. It was a bit too sharp for my taste. We added some garlic salt at the table and that helped. I may make it next time with the half mild and add some garlic. Thanks for the recipe. Linda

My children will not eat mac & cheese any other way. I have a 6 year old that I can't pay to eat (literally) and he begs for this. Its really not that much more involved then a box.

This recipe is really good although I made a few changes.  I used 2% cheese (8 oz of mild cheddar and 8 oz of sharp), only 1 can of evap milk, and left out the mustard as I'm allergic to it.

I was a bit worried when I added all the cheese as it got really stringy in the pan but now that it has cooled it's just creamy and yummy and not stringy at all.  Next time I would use the 2nd can of evap milk as it turns out 1 was not enough for me so I ended up adding about a half cup of milk after all the cheese was melted into the broth/milk mixture.  This made a TON of mac n cheese so I hope that it heats up well and doesn't get greasy or separate.  If it does not, I will definitely make this again.

Make a novice cook like me feel like a chef.  Very easy to prepare.  Fairly quick for homemade mac n cheese.  Rich Rich Rich tasting and so enjoyable.  I have also mixed in some homemade chili to change it up.

This is ssoooo good!!  I only used about half the cheese sauce, I used a combination of sharp cheddar, mild cheddar and mozzarella.  The Dijon Mustard is only noticeable if you know it's in there.  You could omit it and it'd still taste great.  I had no issues with a "gritty" or "chunky" texture - it was smooth and oh so gooey!!  I did have to cook the milk/broth a while to get it bubbly, but it was still a piece of cake.  If you like cafeteria style mac-n-chz then you'll love this!

This recipe is YUMMY!  I cooked this for a Christmas party and everyone loved it.  I must agree with the others that this recipe makes a lot of sauce so I would use 1 less can of evaporated milk.  It does take a while for the sauce to thicken. It was grainy but next time I know to use good parmesan cheese and not the processed grated one.  I cooked the sauce in high heat and stirred it occasionally until it was thick.  I will definitely make this again...

This is definitely THE recipe for a good, "All-American" mac 'n cheese.  This was my first attempt at mac 'n cheese and it was a total success! Rich and creamy, gooey and thick -- it was perfect!  I halved the recipe and omitted the Dijon and extra Parm and it came out fab.  I don't know why it took people so long to stir/thicken -- mine took only like 10-12 min!  Thanks for the perfect mac 'n cheese recipe!!!

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and made half the sauce. That was a good move, although a *little* more would be ok. I had to improvise a bit. I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I reconstituted some skim milk powder with only 40% of the water. I used edam and mild cheddar because of the graininess problems with mature cheddar. Worked great! I like the stringiness the edam adds - a bit like mozzarella (but *much* cheaper where I live).

My family did not care for this at all. It was a thick glue like paste of a sauce, and way too much of it for the pasta. The color was terrible too - it was a light orange goop that didn't even look homemade.

This was ok... used sharp and mild cheddar with Jack cheese as recommended by other reviewers, but it still came out grainy. Everyone still loved it and had 2nds as well, so I'm probably just more picky than most.  Will probably make again.

The jury's still out on this recipe, but I can see the potential, so I'm giving it 4 stars.

I used 2% milk instead of the evaporated milk, and started with half of the recommended amount.  After I started the recipe, I realized that I didn't have any flour!  The milk, chicken stock and butter was simmering on the stove while I ran from neighbour to neighbour, asking for a bit of flour.  Once I had found some, the mixture had probably been warming (and my son whisking) for about 5-7 minutes.  As soon as I whisked in the flour, it thickened instantly.  Perhaps that's the secret.  I added more 2% milk afterwards to thin it out a bit.

We added shredded cheddar and mozzarella mix.  Some parmesan too.  I would recommend adding some sort of cheese that has a bit of kick to it - i.e. pepper jack or sharp cheddar as the recipe recommends.  I can see why the recipe calls for mustard, as it seems the real cheese (as opposed to the Kraft powdered variety) seems a bit bland.  How sad but true.  Next time I'll experiment with new sources of flavour to add to this recipe.

Other than that, it was nice and creamy.  Lots of sauce to go with the amount of pasta - you might want to make more pasta than the recipe calls for.  I also should mention I cut this recipe in half.

For mac & cheese lovers, this is a fabulous dish.  It makes a LOT, so the first time I made it, leftovers were handed out to the family....and the rave reviews began.  "Best mac & cheese EVER"..."my roommate and I ate it 3 nights in a row"..."when are you making it again?"  It's easy and very good.  I even put it in a crock pot on the Keep Warm setting to travel.  It's a keeper!

Wonderful!!! I am a Kraft Delux Mac and Cheese lover, so I didn't think I'd liek this recipe as per another viewers suggestion-I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT! The recipe does make a ton, so if it is only the two of you, I would cut it down to 1/2 cup of chicken broth, and 5 oz. of evaporated milk. But if you want a good, non grainy recipe, this is it!

As for this recipe i wasnt to fond of it. My husband and four year old did like it though. Maybe not creamy enough or not cheesy enough for me but it lacked something. Toward the end i put it in a baking dish with bread crumbs on top but it still didnt do anything for the flavor of it. Maybe i'd skip the evaporated milk and use real milk next time and maybe use a different cheese.

Made this dish after searching for the right homemade Mac and Cheese.Still looking. The dijon mustard after reducing it to just a 1/2 tsp. was still overpowering and I like dijon. Just not in this dish. I also added sour cream, a dash of garlic powder and only 1 can of the evaporated milk after reading the other reviews. It is a good base to work with but still felt it was missing something.

Yummy- we only put in 10ml of dijion mustard and the next time probablly only about 5ml because may have been a bit strong. A real treat!  Brought me right back to my childhood.

I was looking for a really creamy recipe and this is it! We added a few bread crumbs to the top and finished it off under the broiler, just because we wanted a crispy top. But the recipe is excellent as is and I'm happy to find a truly creamy recipe without having to add processed cheese. Excellent!

The sauce was cheesy, but not creamy - a bit grainy and i whisked and whisked it.  i'm hoping to find a recipe that mimics a home cooked mac and cheese like you would find at a bar-b-que joint in the south - and this recipe was so not it.

This was awesome! It turned out better than I expected. The only thing I would change is to make half as much because it makes A LOT. Great recipe!

This recipe grew on me.  I'm not a big mac and cheese fan and at first I thought the mustard in it was too much.  But if you let it sit for while, it is good.  Especially make sure you add pepper and I sprinkled a little paprika on top too.  Maybe next time I'll bake it too.

Oh my gosh this was good!  And so easy!  I like to make Mac and Cheese that isn't so processed (like from a box or using "fake" cheese) and this recipe was perfect.  Very Creamy!

This was excellent. I used a whole grain mustard as I didn't have any dijon. The sauce was just right, thick & cheesy. Will use this recipe from now on!

This was by far, the creamiest mac & cheese I have ever made.  I would like to say I followed everything exactly, but I didn't.  I did do everything exactly except for the cheese.  I cut the cheddar down and added equal amounts of other cheeses so that the overall measurements were the same, just different cheeses.  My nephew said it was the best he has ever eaten.

Great mac and cheese recipe!  The only changes I made was to use ground mustard instead of Dijon mustard and mild cheddar cheese.  My 2 year old son loves it and I do too.

I should have thinned it out more and reduced the amount of dijon even more than I did, because all I could taste was mustard.   It was quite bland except for the overpowering taste of mustard.   If I give it another shot, I will be adding some herbs or spices to enhance the flavour and eliminating or reducing the dijon to a tsp.

Really good and extra cheesy. I would do half the cheddar cheese and make the other half a mozzarella to offset the sharpness. I added 1tsp of pepper and it was about the right amount. Will make this again.

I didn't make it exactly like the recipe, as per the reviews about Dijon mustard, so I doctored it! I used 1 cup of each Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese (Or more...you know. Because cheese!) , and 2 cups milk. I took the 3 T butter and cooked 2 T garlic, THEN added the flour! After I made the rue (butter and flour) I add in the chicken stock and whisk. It'll become thick almost instantly. I used whole milk instead of canned. THEN I added in mustard powder, SOME salt (you can salt it to taste later), some pepper, and then? NUTMEG. You heard me! Don't be afraid of it! The taste will blow your mind! Add about 2 TSP (or to taste) of it. Add in cheese, adjust taste, and then add in the pasta! I gave it to some VERY picky teens who ate it and said it was the best thing they'd ever tasted. TEENS SAID THAT. So. Hope this help!

I am sure that it is a good recipe just not a do-over for my family.  The sauce never really "thickened" and it came out slightly chalky.

This is a wonderful macaroni and cheese recipe with REAL ingredients!  I left out the mustard to make this more kid-friendly.  Also, halving the recipe made the perfect amount for my family of three.

I made this with  asiago cheese because I didn't have any chedder in the house at the time also I use whole-wheat elbow macaroni .  I also substituted dry mustard for the  Dijon, and heavy cream instead of canned milk. 
When putting the cheese into milk mixture I put it in a little at a time while stirring continuously to keep from sticking. 
Very yummy. 
When warming up the next day I added sun dried tomatoes and hot pepper sauce.

I love this recipe.  It's very moist and sweet compared to other recipes.  With the sweetness, it goes well with adding something salty like ham or bacon in it.  I'll make this again sometime.

Warning, I did have to make changes for dietary concerns. Instead of evaporated milk I used Trader Joe's thick and creamy coconut cream (salted to reduce the coconut flavor), I used gluten free noodles and used corn starch or other gluten free thickener in place of flour.   It comes out well just the same and I always come back for more. ??

I made this on Easter and got RAVE reviews from family and friends. I did NOT add parm, though, and added gouda for additional creaminess.
I also added a dash of mustard powder, beacuse I always add that to my mac and cheese.

AMAZING!

I did not find this grainy at all, and I was able to put it in the crock pot instead of baking it and it stayed creamy and wonderful

I think the cheddar cheese sauce is just too grainy, although it could be the quality of the cheese that causes the graininess.  Or it could be that I baked it for 30 minutes, but I don't think so.   It turned out well enough to serve to my family.

This is pretty good! I changed it up a little bit though! I added 1.5 C chicken broth, minced garlic and onion powder, I also used less park(only because I only had about 1/4 C ) and I added 1 slice of american cheese. It is very good. It came out a little thicker but that's okay because that's how I like my Mac & cheese! lol

I'm not going to lie. Visually, the mac and cheese looks great, and that's as far as I'm going to praise this recipe. The taste was off putting due to the mustard. I took one bite to know this wasn't going to be a pleasant experience. It might be for some, but if you prefer traditional mac and cheese then do not make this version. Trust me on this one.

Yummy!!! This was my first attempt at homemade mac and cheese and I don't think I'll ever go back to the box! SO easy and SOOOOO good! I used half and half instead of evaporated milk and mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan (because that's what I had on hand). I also used about a teaspoon of dry mustard instead of Dijon. 

My 5 year old and 2 year old devoured it and my husband said it needs to become a regular for us. It was a total hit!

Like other reviewers, I modified the mustard.  I used a little over half a teaspoon of ground mustard.  I also used 5 slices of Velveeta cheese and slightly more parm than the recipe required.  I used one 16 oz container of heavy cream and one 12 oz can of the milk.  Next time, I would use 2 of the cream.  The mix seems very soupy initially, but it will thicken.  Overall, delicious and easy.

I made this for dinner tonight and it went over great! I did make a few changes though. I don't really like parm cheese that much, so I eliminated it and substituted 1 brick of cr ch. I also put only 1 tbl of dry mustard. I took the idea of another cook and used milk and half/half instead of evaporated milk. I suppose I made a lot of changes but the proportions and results were delicious!

I used sharp cheddar and low sodium chicken broth. Not a good combination. The cheese was too tangy and I ended up adding quite a bit of salt to make up for the lack luster broth. I will try again but with tweaks. I like the texture. It was the creaminess I was hoping for.

This mac n cheese is exactly how I like it—creamy and gooey! Sometimes I leave out the mustard, sometimes I do a combo of different cheeses; it's easy to modify to your particular palate. I think the key is the evaporated milk (for creaminess) and the grated Parmesan (for a base of umami to build from).

So sad that I didn't like this - was surprised to see Dijon in it, but since I love all kinds of mustard, I figured this could ensure a knock-out dish. Might just be us, but this was not our favorite : (

I have been trying for years to find a really good, creamy mac and cheese recipe, I think I found it!! Very good. I had to use Velveeta b/c that's all I had on hand but it still turned out great!! Evaporated milk is the key!!!

Just finished eating a bowl. It was easy and delicious! I didn't have dijon so just substituted the nice spicy brown that I have. I also added just a little less than called for because I am not a big fan of mustard in my mac and cheese.

When it was really warm it was ok.  When it started to cool just a bit it was thick and hard to swallow.  It also had a gritty chalky taste that got worse the longer it sat.

This is the best homemade macaroni and cheese I've found! I'm very picky because I cannot stand dry mac and cheese but this is far from it. The only change I made is added some garlic powder and a little less Dijon mustard.

Made this for baby brother who can't get enough Mac and cheese. He wants me to give the recipe to our mother so she can make it for him (he is 8 yes old). I made it just like the recipe instructed EXCEPT I did take advice regarding the mustard. I used 1tsp ground mustard instead. So yummy

Substitute 1 tsp ground mustard for the dijon, and everything else is great. Dinner was delayed because of an interruption, and the sauce thickened up a lot! So, don't worry if it seems soupy at first, it cools to a thicker sauce.  The parm added more saltiness than I expected, but that may have been the brand.  I suggest tasting while adding small amounts of it.

I found this mac and cheese to come out way to thick when following the directions to use the evaporated milk.  I used half regular milk and half evaporated and it was still way to thick.  Within a half hour of making this, it literally became one thick blob of food.  The taste was good but I had to cut it apart to serve it. I would consider making this again but using all milk and less roux (flour/butter mixture).

Great recipe.   I made this a couple times already, following the exact directions the first time and changing it up a bit as suggested by others the second time.    Both turned out good.   FYI, this is not like Kraft Mac and cheese, so if that is what you are going for you probably don't want to use this recipe.

The Dijon mustard made it inedible for both my husband and I.  I didn't have any trouble preparing the recipe after I looked through a few of the reviews and added mozzarella along with the cheddar and shredded parmesan.  The overall flavor of the cheeses was too bland and the mustard overwhelmed.

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  This time I made it almost exactly as written, just only used 1 T. dijon, because it's not my favorite (last time i left it out).  Turns out it's not that great with the dijon. :(  I also made two pounds of elbows, because last time with one was waaay too much sauce.  I think it was about the right amount of pasta, but if you're not big on dijon mustard, leave it out completely.  I may try with a teaspoon of spicy brown next time.  Still rating it 4 stars, but for the version I made tonight, I honestly rate it a 2.

I liked this recipe-I tried it because it was creamy and it was! I did not use the Dijon mustard. Next time I probably will not use the Parmesan cheese and extra sharp cheddar but colby/jack.

I scaled down this recipe to make for 2 children (age 2&4). I was skeptical about making Mac & cheese from scratch because these kids only like velveta shells and cheese! I used small shells and I also didn't have the exact cheeses so I used pecorino Romano,  sharp white cheddar and 1 little stick of mozzarella string cheese. I only used a tiny drop of mustard (about 1/16 of a teaspoon ) and followed the prep directions. This still came out to about 4 kid sized portions. The pickiest (the 4 year old) said to me when she tasted it "you make good Mac and cheese"  that is the best I could have heard! She said it tasted cheesy like her favorite popcorn (Smartfood)! I will be hanging on to this recipe for sure! Thanks so much for this easy and quick recipe!

This was soooo good! Cheese sauce was creamy and smooth!

I made it as directed and have also made it with some small tweaks to fit my personal tastes.

I read reviews prior to making this and took the suggestion of other reviewers and use dry mustard instead of dijon mustard (which I'm not a fan of anyway).  I met the butter over medium heat, then whisk in flour slowly to keep it from clumping and to ensure it cooked thoroughly.  I added minced garlic, minced onion, dry mustard, and a little salt and pepper to the butter and flour while cooking.  I used half and half instead of evaporated milk and chicken stock instead of chicken broth.  Add the parmesean cheese first, a little at a time, stirring constantly until smooth.  Do not add more cheese until what is already in the pot has melted.  Then I added sharp cheddar, also a little bit at a time.  I REALLY like cheese so I used  more than the recipe called for, and just added a bit of 2% milk when it got too thick.  I used about 1 and 1/4 cups of parm cheese and 2.5-3cups of cheddar.

I also, after mixing in the pasta, threw it uncovered in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes while my meat finished cooking.  

My entire family loved it, and I can't wait to make it again!

I really loved this recipe. I used this recipe for Thanksgiving, I changed a few things. Instead of making the chicken broth and milk in the microwave I cooked it on the stove and slowly added the cheddar cheese mixing it in on a high to medium flame. I didn't use any mustard, or parm cheese. After I put in in the oven for about 20-25 minutes. I didn't think the measurements were correct so I added more pasta and more cheese.  I loved this recipe I will use it in my home very frequently

I have never found a homemade mac n cheese I loved this much. I did not have everything I need for the recipe, unfortunately. I had no parmesan cheese, so I omitted that. The cheddar cheese I had was only mild cheddar cheese. I also used ground and plain mustard instead of dijon. I am dying to try this recipe as written next time. I can't believe I changed it so much and it was still delicious! This is my kind of mac n cheese!

Out of our family of 5 only 1 child loved it. Hubby & 2 kids thought it was way too cheesy & I liked it. I used extra old cheddar (about 200 grams)and mixed in some Kraft Tex Mex shredded cheese mix & the parmesean. Will make again but will cut back on the old cheddar next time.

This was great!  I halved the recipe and used a combination of extra sharp cheddar, muenster, and pepper jack.  I ended up needing about 3/4 c. more water (used the rinse water from the evaporated milk can).  I too needed to stir the butter/milk mixture for close to 10 minutes.  After I mixed in the pasta, I transferred it to a greased baking dish, sprinkled with parley and thyme and baked at 350 covered for about 20 minutes while I got the rest of dinner ready.  The last 5 minutes, I uncovered, topped with crushed saltines and broiled on high to get a nice crust.  Hands down the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  The dijon really puts it over the top, and I will continue to play with other spice combinations.

This turned out soooo good!! I used fresh parm from Trader Joe's and cheese from the deli and it was a huge hit with the family.  I did make it again at my parents house and didn't have the same ingredients and it wasn't as good:( I will continue to make it at home

I reduced the size to 4 servings. It was on ther chicken-y side due to the broth which I will substitute with water in the future, either that or I may have used too much broth being that my measurements were pre frozen in half cups, and I didn’t bother paying attention to the measurement. The sauce was incredible! Very cheesy, although I did add very little shredded Mozzarella and American. I love cheese so I am not complaining! :) I used heavy cream since I didn’t have the evaporated milk on hand, which I used less of since I figured I went over on the broth. Lastly I subbed the mustard for a quite a bit less nutmeg. Altogether this Mac n’ Cheese was just what it says it’ll be – creamy and delicious (not to mention cheesy!!).  I will definitely be making again and experimenting more with this recipe. Thanks much! :)

I love this! I halved the recipe and simplified it by only using regular milk instead of evaporated and omitting the mustard, parmesan and pepper. I use whatever cheese I have on hand and omit the salt if I'm using chicken broth with sodium in it. I added some garlic powder to the milk mixture before adding the cheese and it was delish! This is my go-to mac 'n cheese!

This is delicious if eaten immediately.  It did not reheat well.  It got clumpy and lost the smooth texture.

Way too much sauce and not enough kinds of cheese. After tasting the outcome, I added a can of tomato soup, placed in baking dish, sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top, and baked for 25 minutes at 425 degrees.  Better

My husband and I loved this! I had a couple of changes. I left out the mustard. I used whole milk instead of evaporated milk. I did half sharp cheddar and half velveeta. The sauce was tangy and smooth and delicious! There is almost too much sauce for the amount of pasta, so next time I will add more pasta.
I am giving this 4 stars because neither of my kids (ages 2 and 5) would eat it. My 5 year old said she didn't like the flavor because it was too tangy. I am making this again tonight, but I will leave out the Parmesan and do a combination of medium cheddar, velveeta and italian blend cheese. Hopefully the kids will like this combo better!

This recipe is awesome! Granted I did make some alterations based on the other reviews. I used cream, rather than evaporated milk, 1/2 cup velveeta rathere than Parmesan, and I omitted the dijon mustard altogether, as it seemed like it would be overwhelming. It was unbelievably creamy, SO good. There was actually almost too much sauce for the amount of pasta, but I put it in the oven for about an hour to keep it warm while other food cooked and it ended up being absolutely perfect! Fantastic, I'll be making this again and again. The only thing I'd consider doing differently is possibly adding onion or garlic to give a tad more flavor. Next time!

Made this (without the mustard) and everyone loved it!  I make this everytime we want mac & cheese!  Better and easier then my old traditional recipe!  I used to make my old recipe for reunions and ended up taking half of it home.  Now all I take home is an empty dish!!  If you like mac & cheese, try this recipe!

This is my most favorite mac n cheese recipe ever! Ive looked all over the internet for a mac n cheese recipe that didnt require Velveeta, and this recipe is definitely the best Ive found! I have made it so many times and its always a big hit! I make this recipe exactly as is only minus the Dijon, just because its a personal preference. So delicious. If you love super cheesy mac n cheese, this is the recipe for you! YUM! :o)

I followed this concept but, melted butter in large skillet and added warm chicken broth/milk combo; then added a corn starch slurry; bubbled and added  about a Tablespoon of the dijon mustard, salt, pepper, and Franks Red hot Sauce then cheese.. melted cheese; thickened and added noodles.. turned out very well..  needed some more s and p at the end.

My daughter has been searching for a good macaroni and cheese to make from scratch.  We used fat free evaporated milk and 2% sharp cheese.  To her, the mustard was overpowering, so next time we will try with no mustard.  She also wants to try a medium cheddar instead of the sharp, which had too much sharpness for her.  She did add a bit of milk at the end and a little salt - I enjoyed the flavor, but we will experiment more next time.

This is one of the best macaroni and cheese recipes that I have ever made. If you don't like extra sharp cheddar cheese, use a cheese that you like better. My two kids are picky and they loved it. It comes out very creamy and delicious. I followed the recipe except that I used 1 tspn of regular mustard because I didn't have dijon mustard. Eveything else was the same.

This was really good for a creamy macaroni and cheese.  I wanted to try a recipe that would make a soupy like sauce, and this one did fit the bill.  There were heaps left over, and the left overs are good heated in the microwave.

A hit!  The kids like this even better than the boxed, and I love it because I KNOW what's in it.  I use only 1 can of evaported milk (and in the future I'm going to try the fat free) and then extra broth + a little bit of regular milk.  I use a combination of mozzerella, sharp cheddar, and mexican blend cheese.  This makes for a wonderful flavor and texture!

Very good, not too saucy. It tasted even better the next day as a leftover. I added some bread crumbs on top for a little extra flavor.

We love mac & cheese and this is creamy, cheesy, and delicious.  Hubby & I both liked it and will add it to my new personal cookbook.  Thanks.

This was very good.  Was especially creamy when piping hot but after cooling on the plate a little, it thickened and got a bit gritty.  I did follow other's advice and used a softer cheese (monterrey jack) for half of the cheese, but it still got a bit gritty.  I think next time I will use only softer cheeses.  I will make again.

I love to cook but have never made mac-n-cheese aside from the "blue box". I read the reviews before making and tweaked it a bit---it came out absolutely amazing and reheats perfectly.  It was extra creamy and not too saucy. I used: -about 1/4 cup flour -used half and half instead of evap. milk -heated the milk/broth mixture on the stove until warm -stirred the milk/broth with the roux for about 10 mins -used 1/3 mild, 1/3 sharp cheddar, and 1/3 monterey jack -added a can of cheddar cheese soup after mixing in the shredded cheese -used 1/4 tsp dry mustard -dash garlic powder. I also put a little texas pete hot sauce on the top of mine Perfect!

Good and safe for a party. Nothing too exciting but that was perfect for a 2 yr old birthday!  Had lots of letovers... put hot dogs in the next night. And everyone was right... make extra noodles! :) Kept warm in crockpot for the party and it worked well.

Great creamy mac.  Was almost exactly what I was looking for in a homemade mac...was a bit thick for my liking, so added some milk.  My personal preference would be to stick with a milder cheddar, as well.  Thanks for the recipe! Went over well.

This recipe was just "ok."  It seems to need some tweeking because there was soooo much sauce compared to pasta.  However, cutting the sauce recipe in half might lead to a Mac n' Not-so-Cheesy.  I would maybe recommend only using 1 can of evaporated milk if I were to make the recipe again, but unfortunately I probably will not make it again.  I also excluded the dijon mustard because I thought that 1.5 TBS would be too overpowering, and I personally do not like mustard.  For my taste the Parmesan was fine, but some people may not like it because it has a very distinguished taste to it, and almost overpowers the cheddar flavor.

Once the sauce started to thicken, it thickened a lot faster than 2% milk.  I didn't like the addition of parmesan cheese to the sauce.  Other than that, it was good.  I liked the tip of pouring oil over the pasta in the strainer.  I like it when I don't have to dirty another dish.

I think this was an easy and awesome recipe. I substituted cream for milk and baked the finish product for 15 mins. But even without my adjustments this recipe was a winner.

My whole family loved this.  The only thing I did different was I used a cheddar/jack blend of cheese because I knew a full sharp cheddar would be a bit "tangy" for my 2 young kids.  They just loved this.

Unfortunately this wasn't a hit at my house. I have 4 little girls who adore mac and cheese, but this one not so much. It wasn't all eaten by our family of six! I think the sauce is more reminiscent of a tetrazzini and was too bland. It was also too sharp. Maybe using more and milder cheeses and adding some cayenne would help.

Definitely creamy, creamy, creamy, maybe a little too creamy.  I did not like the mustard at all and not real crazy about the parm cheese.  I will try again and use more noodles, no mustard and no parm.

I love this recipe, and developed a low carb version to fit our lifestyle.    I have been trying different recipes for years, searching for one that recreates the creamy mac n cheese I used to eat in my elementary school cafeteria as a child (the absolute best I ever tasted in my entire life).  This is the closest I have ever gotten!    I made a few changes to accomodate our low carb life style, so using this recipe as a springboard, I changed it to the following: omitted the mustard, changed the serving size to 3 servings, increased the butter to 2 1/2 TBSP, used about 3 TBSP Carbquik low carb flour in place of white flour in the roux, as well as a pinch of xanthan gum as a thickener. Used 1/2 C cream plus water in place of milk, and finally used dreamfields low carb elbows instead of traditional high carb pasta.   It was FANTASTIC!  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe!!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband thinks it's the best mac & cheese he's ever had. It was too rich for me, and my 22 month old didn't eat much of it. Next time I will use only 1/2 evaporated milk and 1/2 skim milk. I also used about half the amount of mustard called for, which was fine. I followed the suggestion of another review to melt the butter and whisk in the flour, broth & milk and that worked well.

This was a very good macaroni and cheese, so I had to write my first review on this site.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and melted the butter first then whisked in the flour.  Added the broth and milk and whisked until thickened. Next, I added cheese then cooked macaroni.  Very easy. I used dry mustard in place of the Dijon. Husband raved about this recipe.

Very good just as is. I did use some white pepper instead of black, and, when all mixed together at the end, stirred in some grated "5-cheese" (Italian) grated cheese. Very good!

This mac and cheese is awesome!  I reduced the dijon to two teaspoons.  I used a mix of evaporated milk and fat free half and half for the dairy.  I used a mix of sharp cheddar, muenster, colby jack and mild cheddar.  I used radiatore pasta and found the amount of sauce to be just right!  This satisfied my macaroni and cheese craving!

My new mac-n-cheese recipe! So creamy. I made half the sauce, which was the perfect balance to pasta for me, used fat-free evaporated milk, and no mustard due to personal aversion to mustard in mac-n-cheese. The flavor is wonderful! This recipe will be a regular. My 18 month old loves it!

I gave 5 stars for my DH who is a huge mac/chs fan and LOVED it--he likes his creamy, but did think it could have been baked a little to thicken. Modified according to what I had/didn't have on hand: substituted for evaporated milk--full can of broth, 1 C of heavy whipping cream and later added 1/4 C of sour cream; cheeses--8 oz extra sharp, 8 oz sharp, 1/2 C mozzarella & parmesan. Leary about mustard, so reduced to 1 T, and I added a pinch of white sugar. Changes based on other reviews: Whisked closer to 10 minutes, used oil in pot while noodles boiled and drained regularly rather than on baking sheet.

It was creamy as advertised, but it was way too thick for my tastes.  Also, I halved the recipe and it still made enough for an army.  It would have been at least 5 huge main dish servings, plus leftovers.

After searching today for a Mac & Cheese Recipe I decided to give this a try!! Boy am I glad I did… It is awesome!! I did change a bit because of what I had on hand I used Swiss and a med cheddar cheese! And I too only used 1 cup of Half and Half but I did end up using more of the chicken broth to keep it from being to thick.  I had so much of this I took half of it and used our left over ham from Easter and ¾ of a bag of frozen peas stuck it in a casserole dish to freeze for a quick dinner when needed… Thanks for the great recipe ?

This is definitely a very creamy mac & cheese - my two older boys (6 & 4) devoured it.  While it doesn't have a ton of flavour, it's yummy and better  than your boxed KD with all of the extra sodium and stuff you don't need.  I didn't measure my pasta, just cooked a bunch as I knew leftovers wouldn't go to waste.  I cut the sauce mixture in half and used 1 tsp dry mustard in place of the dijon (my normal mac and cheese uses dry mustard anyway and many reviewers commented on the overpowering taste of dijon).  I only had old (light) cheddar and used some of the parm, but I know this would be great using different cheese blends...yum!

it was the BEST MAC AND CHEESE I HAVE EVER TASTED. i did change a few things. i only had on can of evaparated milk so i added one can of 1% milk and a blend of parm and swiss cheese, and no mustard and 1/2 cup of velveeta cheese and 1-1/2lb of noodles, i did mild cheese.  it turned out GREAT IT MAKES ALOT BUT IT'S WORTH IT

This is a Great Creamy Mac & Cheese Recipe! I Loved it & it was easy to cut calories & make it a little healthier! I used Whole Grain Pasta, 2% cheese (which is a bit rubbery but still works, ha ha) & some Fat Free half & half (eye ball it) instead of the milk! Still Super Yummy, but with less guilt!! :)

This was pretty good - not my favorite though. I did make some changes based on others' reviews. I used one can of milk, and used fontina and sharp cheddar. I topped this with chopped tomatoes and crumbled turkey bacon. It seems like there is something missing with the sauce's flavor.

Very good!  Almost perfect.  Just need to tweak the cheese a little.  Too sharp tasting, but overall delicious and perfectly creamy!

I have only made mac n cheese once before and it wasn't very good. I decided to try this because it seemed more like a Kraft type than a gourmet mac n cheese. I was right, my family liked it very much and I will use this recipe again. The only thing that suprised me was that after it was complete it was way too thick. During the end when you are just stirring everything together and heating through I had to keep adding milk to thin it. Probably a cup in all. Other things I changed were I cut the recipe in 1/2 and used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk, a pinch of dry mustard per other reviews and that's about it. Thanks for this recipe.

I’ve been looking for a creamy Macaroni & Cheese and this is a great consistency.  It really is very creamy.  My only problem was that the taste of the parmesan cheese overpowered the dish. I will definitely make this again but I will cut the parmesan cheese way back to maybe 2-3 tablespoons.

I tried this for the first time on Thanksgiving because I didn't want to have to wait for it to bake...Turned out exactly as I expected... Very creamy and delicious.  My husband must have this for Thanksgiving Dinner and he was quite pleased with it.  The only change I would make is to leave out the parmesan cheese.  It was a little too pungent for me....

WOW!  This was so creamy.  My family loved it.  I made it for the kids to have on Christmas dinner and I had many compliments.  I have had touble with other homemade macaroni recipes being too dry but this one was very creamy.  Definitely a hit!

I give this recipe 3 stars because I love the consistency, but the taste is too sharp!  You have to really LOVE Sharp Cheddar Cheese—it is so overpowering!  I made it and gave it to my 6 & 8 year olds and they said is gross.  Honestly I will probably follow this recipe again because it is very creamy which I love, but I will delete the sharp cheddar cheese altogether and use some other combination of cheeses.

This was sooo easy and fun to make, I had my girls (age 12 & 14) prepare most of it and to thier surprise - it turned out yummy!! The extra sharp cheddar cheese really makes a difference and we've experimented with several noodles - "Barilla Mini Bow Tie" is our favorite!

a little too creamy for me...i only used 1 can of evaporated milk and then refilled that can with regular milk...for some reason i could really taste the chicken broth, which was weird. it does make a TON of macaroni though!

The best mac and cheese I have ever tasted!  I didn't add the mustard, used some extra butter, and added lots of pepper.  I couldn't stop eating it!  Now is that a good thing or a bad thing? :)

I'm giving this 5 stars because the texture and taste is super! I have been searching for a macNcheese recipe that tastes like the stuff in the freezer section that I can make at home with out all the preservatives and this is very close. We made some adjustments to the recipe, I believe cooking leaves room for personal preference, and a recipe isn't less of a recipe because it calls for mustard and I personally don't like it.
We also found that there WAS too much cheese...I couldn't believe it! I didn't think there was such a thing. We did make some substitutions for the cheese..used 8oz velveeta, 8oz Cheddar
and I used 12 ounces of whole milk and 1 can of evaporated milk. We still thought it could use some more milk because it set up really thick on our plate before we were able to finish eating the serving. We plan to play around with the recipe a bit to help make it a cheaper dish. With the substitutions I made, it cost about $8 to make 10 servings, which is a little pricey for a side dish for our family. I figured that the recipe as stated costs aproximately $10 for 10 servings.

This was incredibly creamy, but a bit too much sauce for my taste, so I added some more macaroni.  I also left out the dijon mustard (not a fan) and added about a teaspoon of hot sauce instead.  With some spicy chicken sausage added, this makes a nice rainy-day dinner with plenty of leftovers for the week.

We loved this recipe. My girls don't usually eat Macaroni and Cheese unless it is from a box. But they loved this. I added peas and ham to theirs. In mine I added ham, green beans, red and green peppers and some hot red pepper flakes to add some heat. I also added a little paprika to the sauce. It was delicious!

Delicious. I didn't have sharp cheddar, so I used American processed instead. Otherwise followed recipe and turned out fantastic. The stirring time to thicken the milk/butter/flour/broth combo is more than 3 or 4 minutes, but not much more...maybe 10 tops. I added original breakfast sausage to make it a complete meal. Makes a lot, so I would maybe cut in half if only cooking for two or three people.

We made this tonight. I used extra cheddar instead of the Parmesan and added ground beef spiced with garlic powder. It was very good and turned out reasonably well, considering I can never seem to make good mac and cheese. Next time I would omit the mustard, add the Parmesan, and try it with cream and homemade broth or other liquid.

very good recipe! In order to cut down on the graininess, I used 1/2 lb Medium Chedder, 1/4 Munster, and 1/4 lb Sharp Cheddar. It was perfect! I also didn't add the mustard, but added a bit of garlic powder and cayenne instead. Yum.

I had to make a few changes as I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  I didn't have any evaporated milk so I substituted powdered milk that I mixed double strength.  I used 1 tsp mustard powder instead of the Dijon.  I was a little short on the cheese and didn't have extra-sharp so I used about 3/4 lb of medium cheddar, although I bet extra-sharp would have been even better.  To cut calories you could easily get away with 1/2 pound of extra sharp.  I added 1 lb of ground pork.  My family loved it!  Will make again!

This was really good.  I only had one can of evaporated milk, so after dumping out the can of milk, I poured skim milk into the can to take the place of the other can of milk.  I boiled my macaroni for only 6 minutes, and that was long enough.  I only had 8 oz. of sharp cheddar, so I used some mozerella cheese along with that.  Also, I used about a tsp. of dry ground mustard instead of prepared mustard, and it gave it a little too much of a mustardy flavor (my fault).  At the end, I felt like this dish was a little too bland (probably because I used mozerella) so I stirred in a little cayenne pepper, which added a little something to it.  Next time I need to try it with the whole amount of cheddar and it would probably be better.

This is a pretty good recipe for mac and cheese.  I added mozzerella cheese and stirred constantly for about 15 minutes but the sauce still became grainy when I added the cheeses (but it still tasted really good).  I used whole wheat pasta, whole wheat flour, and replaced on can of evaporated milk with 1% milk and I thought it tasted great even with the "healthy" modifications.  Will probably make again.

Pretty good, thanks for the recipe!  I used a variety of cheeses as it was all I had on hand and added a few shakes each of worchestershire sauce hot chili sauce.  Made a very rich but satisfying side dish.

This tasted a little like an alfredo sauce. I guess b/c of the parmesean. I used a 16 oz bag of spiral noodles and there was still plenty of sauce. Basically a white sauce with cheese. I only added a drop of mustard but I sauteed onion in the butter and added garlic powder. This is a nice no-bake recipe for mac n cheese.

Great recipe! It was creamy and cheesy; just what I wanted. I used Velveeta cheese instead of cheddar cheese and it was perfect. Needs for salt though.

The final dish was good, but ran into a problem when trying to whisk until thick and bubbly. I ended up burning some on the bottom of my pan. So if you make this dish whisk like crazy!

I am a big fan of homemade mac n cheese, and I absolutely love my own recipe, and so I thought id step outside the box and try a new one. This recipe I have to say is ok/good but not great. It made WAY TOO MUCH sauce which I could have used for another pound of pasta or so. In fact, there was so much sauce it drenched and drowned my bow-tie pasta that it wasnt really that appetizing after the first couple of bites. It was very very rich and creamy, almost too heavy for my liking. The chicken broth gave it an interesting zing, dont know if I liked that or not. Also I used half colby jack and have cheddar. I didnt have any extra sharp cheese which would have made it taste better. Overall, its a good base recipe. I dont know if id make it again, the consistancy was like fondue, a little too thick and sticky. I have a huge pot that i made and I think it will go to waste b/c neither my husband or I will eat it...oh well....

This recipe was pretty good. I browned some chopped onions in the butter, then did the roux. It added just a bit more to the dish. I also used "hot" dijon mustard and it worked well. Would taste great with fresth tomatoes mixed in too.

Merely OK, won't be making this again I'm afraid.  The box is better IMO, this was too bland and the texture was kind of grainy, and I agree with other's who posted it was too cheesy.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I actually got a little sick after trying to eat a second bowl.

Pretty good recipes. Nice and creamy, the consistency was nice but I felt it was lacking flavor! The dijon mustard overpowered it way too much and only added 1 tablespoon. When I first read people's complaints about the dijon mustard I thought they were crazy, but I agree. Next time I will try it without the dijon mustard and do half sharp cheddar, half medium cheddar.

I tried this for supper. I didn't care for it but I also did not use the exact type of cheese the recipe called for and maybe that was the problem although it still tasted okay. It was very creamy.  My family really enjoyed it and even had seconds.

I have been married 27 yrs. In all that time my husband has only refused to eat 2 things that I made for dinner. This is the 2nd one.  Ithiught it was ok and my 15 yr old daughter liked it but if my husband doesn't like it its out of the dinner rotation. I had the computer redo the recipe for 5 servings and  followed it exactly with the exception of dry mustard instead of jarred. I gave it 2 stars since my child did like it.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  I have searched for years for a homemake mac and cheese.  I used cheddar cheese and velveeta cheese.  The cheese sauce was always curdled.  This sauce is extremely creamy. I do not know if it is the canned milk that helps or what.  Anyone who makes this might want to dilute the finished product with a little regular milk.  Like the recipe says, it might be a little too thick for your liking.  Excellent, Excellent.  My family loves it!!!

Not pleasing to me at all but the guests thought it was good. Not cheesy enough for me. I took a previous reviewers suggestion and added (1) can cheddar cheese soup and baked in oven. I am still in search of a great mac & cheese recipe. Or I'll just create my own!

I wasn't as happy with this recipe as I thought I would be.  I made half, which was plenty for 4 people.  It came out too thick even though I tried thinning it with water as suggested and even though I cut back on the dijon my kids still didn't care for the flavor. I think I will keep searching for a homemade mac and cheese recipe.

I made this the other night and it was a big hit.  The only thing I did differently other than scaling it in half, was to add a cup of frozen peas and baked it for 20 minutes. This is my mac and cheese recipe of choice from now on!  Loved the Dijon!

My daughter loves macaroni and cheese.  Unfortunately, my daughter thought this was totally nasty.  The flavor was tolerable but the texture?  Too fluffy?  We would rather have the coating on the macaroni more "firm."  More firm would give the macaroni more cheesy flavor.  Looks like the blue box will be bought next time.

This was indeed a quick and easy recipe... and it made for very creamy mac & cheese. As usual for me, i added my own touches, replacing a portion of the liquid with half a can of cream of mushroom soup and adding garlic/onion powder liberally. The end result was too bland for me... so i will continue my search for mac & cheese with a kick!

This is the best "from scratch" macaroni and cheese I have ever tasted. It is very creamy and has a rich cheese flavor. I have made it several times and it is always gobbled up. I add only 1 tbsp of dijon, otherwise it has too much 'bite' for me.

This was very creamy, but so sharp and almost too cheesy (I can't believe I'd ever say that) I'm not sure if it was the Dijon that did it, or the extra sharp cheese. It was so rich and sharp I felt full/nauseated after about 6 bites. I LOVE sharp cheese so I don't know what went wrong. I didn't have 1/2 c. parmesan so I added 1/2 c. reg. cheddar.  I'll try once more using colby/longhorn cheese and a drop of mustard after I recover from my cheese attack. I'm taking the rest of it to work tomorrow, my dept. will eat anything, and I won't feel like I'm wasting it.LOL

This was delicious!  I will be making it again!  I would not, although, compare it to "boxed" as far as ease!  A box is definitely easier, but this is tasty and way more nutritious.  I use fortified Barilla pasta, it claims lots of protein!
