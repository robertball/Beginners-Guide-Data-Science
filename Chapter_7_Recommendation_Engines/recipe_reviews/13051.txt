I tweaked this recipe a bit after reading its reviews, and LOVED it. I used only one can of tomato soup and added four fresh tomatoes that I chopped and blended. Based on others' recommendations I added fresh garlic and grated cheese, along with some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. It turned out delicious!

I made this one twice, the second time adding cheese and butter to the recipe before reheating. That added a lot of flavor!

This was very yummy, but I did tweak it a bit as some of the other reviewers did. I sliced the eggplant in 1/2 and coated both sides w/EVOO, S&P, and baked as directed. I then took out the insides and mashed them in a pot so it was chunky. In addition to the tomato soup, I added dried basil, oregano, onion powder, a touch of salt, and freshly minced garlic. I needed to add a lot more chicken broth than directed, because it was very thick. Once it was to my desired consistency, it was fantastic! We served it w/Big Y snowflake rolls- super yummy and great for dipping. We will be making it again, but will need to make a larger amount because it was such a hit w/my family, kids included (3 & 7).

This was a good recipe.  I added green pepper to the final boil until it was soft, that added a lot of flavor

I just made this soup and followed the recipe adding nothing. I wasn't sure about adding milk to the tomato soup but did add just one can of milk. Enjoyed it very much.

After adding some extra ingredients suggested by others this soup turned out great. I used 2 small eggplants, one fresh tomato, 1 can of soup, some fresh basil, some garlic, grated italian cheese blend, italian seasoning, some butter and topped with a dollup of sour cream.

I like eggplant, but I have to agree with some of the other comments.  It's a bland soup, but it could be a good base soup.  I had to add onion powder, garlic powder, garlic salt, basil, Italian seasoning, and some crumbles of feta cheese to make it something I wanted to eat.

Super easy!  I only had 1 eggplant handy, so I only used 1 can soup.  But, I did add in a can of crushed tomatoes and a chopped green pepper.  Love it!

I made this with crushed tomatoes instead of soup and added some garlic. Served it with cheese over the top and a touch of sour cream. Teste was excellent but texture was a little off.

I love eggplant, but this was the worst tasting soup I've ever made.  I added salt and basil and I still ended up not being able to stomach it.  Will not make again.

I found this soup to be very bland. It needs seasoning.  Also I thought it was too thick and added the entire can of chicken broth.

Really, I just took the general concepts of this recipe but ended up with something fabulous!
I sauteed the eggplant with onions and garlic until tender and then added a can of tomato soup, along with a can of water.  The addition of a generous amount of basil completed this lovely, simple meal.

I didn't think the flavor was great, even after I added my own spices.  I added roasted garlic, S&P, and basil, but it still needs more "pizzaz".  Good, no doubt, but not great.  It was fine for dipping grilled cheese into.  Just to note: I also ended up adding more chicken broth than called for to thin it out, and the eggplants I used weighed about 1lb each.

very easy. i added butter sauted onions, a tablespoon of minced garlic and a tablespoon of ginger paste to give it some spicy depth. served with some bread on a cool november evening it was delicous. with less broth it could be a great pasta sauce, i think.  i served it to the husband as a low calorie but high fiber meal for his new low carb diet and he really liked it.  thanks for sharing, its a keeper!
