This recipe needs more sugar in the mix. They weren't sweet enough at all, and tasted quite bland. The Simple Scones recipe on this site is much better.

Really yummy.  My son helped me mix up the dough and we had them in the oven in no time.  Next time I will double the recipe because these went fast.

Pretty good.  I probably tripled the cinnamon overall - doubling what went on top as well as adding a lot to the dough itself.  
I spread cream over the scone tops before sprinkling on the cinnamon/sugar mixture so it would stick better.  I think next time I'll increase the dates by 50% or more

We liked these scones. My less picky child was not put off by the dates and ate them and the older one was having no problem until she spotted a bigger bite of date.
 I didn't have milk in the house, but I saw another review noting that they had used buttermilk, so I decided to use that instead. I added a little ground cinnamon to the flour mixture. 
Prep time listed is accurate. 
I wasn't sure how many dates go into 2/3 cups, but I packed them in and ended up using 12 dates. I chopped them all together (by hand) and found that they became a sweet mushy mess, which ended up as one big clump in the flour mixture. I used my hands to incorporate evenly, but wonder if cutting the dates individually would save this step (in any case, both ways get you the same result). I used less than half of the final cinnamon/sugar for the tops, and found that that was more than enough. The dough is VERY wet, use care when turning out.
The inside was soft, but the tops felt a little dry to me, might try an egg wash or melted butter before baking next time. 
Sign of a successful recipe: hubby says as he gets up from table: The scones were good!

This was my first ever attempt at scones.  I made this recipe as written and they turned out well.  Great texture, nice taste.  I can also see replacing the dates with cranberries or other dried fruits.  This is a very good basic scone recipe and I will be using it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This are really good. My rolling mat has 1" squares marked so it was very easy to make. I used a puzza cutter to cut it. It only makes 12 but they are nice size. My daughter even ate them and admitted you cant taste the dates. Dates are healthy, add a nice texture but dont have a distinct flavor.  I normally get scones at Starbucks but they are normally dry and hard. These are nice and moist. Yum!!

Fantastic and adaptable!  These scones weren't too dry, and were absolutely delicious.

These were excellent!  I took someone's advice and added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the dry ingredients and 1/2 cup cinnamon chips at the end, plus I substituted 2 T of applesauce for 2 T butter and the texture and taste was amazing.  I might even do a 3T substitute next time.

Lovely recipe, thanks for posting!  I substituted half wholewheat flour because I didn't have enough AP flour.  I added about 1/3 cup of chopped pecans, substituted the entire sugar for 2 tablespoons of agave nectar mixed into the dough and also just mixed the cinnamon in the dough because I'm lazy.  Tasty tasty!

These are very good!  I used raisins instead of dates and my 7 year loved them!  I also added 2/3 cup cinnamon chips.

I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers and substituted buttermilk for the milk and used half whole wheat flour. I didn't mean to, but I forgot to add the cinnamon and the sugar when I baked the scones. The results were amazing! The scones turned out not-to-sweet and yet with a delicious date flavor. They were a lot more like British scones than the sweet American scones which is what I prefer.
