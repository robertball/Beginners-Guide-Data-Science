I think this was fantastic. in Denmark we eat a lot of celery root. One of our national dishes is meat balls in Celeri Root sause, Made from the cooking water of the Celeri root, thickened with a butter flour mix to gravy consistency. Bread is served on the side and is  something we eat often when Celery root is in season. That Celeri mix in sause tastes heavenly in Puff Pastry tarts too. We don't slice it for these resepies we cube it. YUM ;0)

Delicious as is! We got a celeriac in our CSA basket and had no idea what to do with it until we found this recipe. We made it exactly following the recipe and really enjoyed it. I think next time we might replace the nutmeg with something else like chili powder or garlic for variety.

I was a bit skeptical but it turned out really good. I didn’t have nutmeg, substitute it with cinnamon. It’s a keeper!
