Great recipe!  I added chopped pecans for a nice crunch.  The batter was quite wet, so it baked a little longer than 1 hour.  I'll make this one again.

Very good! I didn't have cranberries or buttermilk so i used dried cherries and  evaporated milk.

Really tasty--spicy and moist, but not soggy wet. I made 12 muffins instead of a loaf, and I baked them for 21 minutes. I didn't have any cranberries, but if I had added them, this recipe would have made about 14 muffins I think.

Loved this recipe for mini loaves.  I added walnuts and zest from one orange.  I did not have cornmeal, but had blue cornmeal.  Will keep this recipe for future showers!

A very nutritious loaf. I did not have molasses so I substituted corn syrup and added almonds.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that the loaf was dry, and I was careful not to overmix the batter. My family really liked the flavour though.
