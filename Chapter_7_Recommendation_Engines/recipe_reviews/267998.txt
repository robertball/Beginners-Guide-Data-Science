By following the recipe, I would not consider these nachos but a cheesy steak dip. I don't think it would work as nachos because when the cheese sauce starts to cool it begins to clump. I did have to double the salsa because the cheese mixture was too thick. If you are craving something different rather than nachos this is the recipe to make.
