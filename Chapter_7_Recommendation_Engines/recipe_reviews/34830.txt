Delicious!  My husband thought so too!  I used green onion instead of scallions. I used about 1/2 cup of prepared instant mashed potatoes in place of the red potato.  I also made an aioli sauce with about 3 parts mayo, 1 part mustard and fresh minced garlic to taste. This will be a favorite!

This is wonderful!  Used italian bread crumbs in place of cornflakes.  Both my 18 month old and 28 year old ate 'em up.

Very easy to make and so good!  I found that I didn't need all the cornflake crumbs it called for.  I made the burger mixture the day before and rolled them the following day.  I used an ice cream scooper to get them consistent - the last patty may come out a bit small (or not at all).  I didn't use olive oil but did spray my pan with Pam Olive Oil cooking spray.  
I served them on wheat buns with romaine lettuce and mayo that I doctored up with lemon juice and basil.  
A definite make again!

Excellent! I made some changes to suit our tastes & my boyfriend - who loathes fish as though it were covered in plague - couldn't stop raving about them. Traded the potato for extra bread crumbs, added some Thai chilli sauce, garlic & finely chopped peppers. Put it on the BBQ & had a fantastic meal in less then 20 mins.

This is my favorite salmon patty recipe.  Sometimes if I'm in a hurry, I will skip the potato and just throw in some dry instant mashed potato flakes.  thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were many, many times better than ready-made fish cakes. I used tinned salmon, added dijon mustard, used crushed crackers and I baked the patties, but otherwise followed the method. They tasted fantastic, though a dipping sause wouldn't be a wasteful addition. I'm planning to make these for a get-together, which my boyfriend and I are hosting soon. Thank you for posting!

They weren't quite as quick to prepare as the recipe said but the extra time was well worth it.  Next time I'll cruch the corn cakes a finer and have much more than the suggested amount on hand.  All in all they were filling and delicious without being heavy- definetly one to make again.

These are really good and versatile.  You can have them with vegetable and other side dishes or you can eat them with eggs and biscuits or something-that's what we did tonight!  I use two 6 oz cans of salmon instead to save time and all.  I've made these a couple times and will make them again.

These were awesome.  I doubled the recipe since I had extra salmon.  My friend came over for dinner with her 2 toddlers - they ALL loved it - and my friend initially said no thanks, I don't like fish.  Quick and easy to make, too.  I also skipped the corn flakes & just used breadcrumbs.

These are so delicious - real, fresh, healthy food that my family loves. Seriously, this is the only way my 3-year-old will eat salmon! They are easy to make and really worth the extra time it takes to prepare the fresh ingredients. The only changes I made were substituting a couple of green onions for the shallot and cooking the salmon for quite a bit less time than the recipe suggests - probably depends on the thickness of the fillet but less is more when cooking fish! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were delicious. I substituted flounder for the salmon and bread crumbs for the corn flakes because it was what I had on hand. The patties had good texture and flavor, although I'll use Old Bay seasoning next time instead of Italian seasoning. It's a sneaky way to get kids to eat fish.

This is an absolutely wonderful dish. I received incredible raves from my dinner party of twelve. I served this as my entree. I am the first one to criticize reviews here by folks that change a recipe to the extent that they've created a whole different recipe, and then they complain about how bad it was, though it's still under the name of the original recipe. It isn't fair. If you mess this one up, I would suggest you don't belong in a kitchen.. I added fresh minced garlic and a tablespoon of old bay to the mix. One reviewer here had a fabulous and simple suggestion for a dip. Three parts mayo, to one part Dijon, and a finely minced garlic clove. End of story. This will be one of your all-time favorites.

this recipe was pretty good. i changed it up a bit, based on what i had on hand. first, i used canned salmon and mashed a leftover roasted potato instead of boiling one. i needed one extra egg and about a 1/4 cup more breadcrumbs to hold everything together. also, i skipped the cornflake crumbs (didn't have any), and added 1/4 cup of diced orange pepper i needed to use up. i love the flexibility of this recipe. thanks for sharing!

Very good! You can really alter any of these salmon patty recipes as you like.  For me I used one can of pink salmon, about 4-5 red potatoes, egg, bread crumbs, chopped onions and I threw in a few handfuls of shredded cheese.  Mashed everything together & fry until brown on both sides and semi-firm.  These are delicious & there was tons of leftover to fry up the next night.  This is a simple, easy dish and inexpensive and feeds 3-4 easy! If you don't like salmon I would recommend shredded chicken would work well also.

I can't wait to offer this on our next Lenten Friday! I "made up" a recipe VERY similar to this. The cornflake crumbs make all the difference in the world! Perhaps a little fresh sage.....

I grew up on salmon croquettes but did not care for the Italian seasoning in these.  My children thought salmon out of a can was repulsive, so this will not be a repeat at my house.

Hubby loves these.  I do not especially like to cook so recipes that are easy really appeal to me--and this one fit the bill. The changes I made were to use instant red skinned potatoes instead of cooking and mashing a potato and I substituted Panko bread crumbs and french fried onions for the cornflakes as that is what I had on hand. Delicious! Next time I may add a bit of crab meat too.

I really like this recipe as written. I do not buy shallot. I do not make it very often because i do not have a 1/2 pound salmon. It is very good though.

These were tasty. I think the next time I make them I will leave out the potato because it kinda took away from how good they were. But other than that they were awesome.

I thought this tasted really good! I actually used canned pink salmon, seasoned it well with salt, pepper and oriental seasonings, and followed the rest of the recipe.  I also used Panko breadcrumbs and the rest is history.  I also made my own tartar sauce to dip them in.  I will be making these again.

PERFECT RECIPE TO ADD TO AS WELL.   Instead of cornflakes, use Panko crumbs-they're japanese breadcrumbs and super crispy. These can be baked. Season according to taste LIKE ANY RECIPE! If you use the italian seasonings and Italiain breadcrumbs have it should have enough flavor.

My whole family loved this.  My young children even had seconds.  It was easy and tasty!  I didn't have shallots , and I used a tsp of Old Bay instead of the italian seasoning.  I will definitely make this again!

The Italian seasoning was way too overpowering and the mashed potatoes gave it a weird texture. The only thing was they sure looked good.  My husband found them okay but I would never make them again.

This is very much as my mother made these over the years.  If you have a meal a few days before you make these Salmon Patties and have mashed potatoes...save some to add to this.  It makes the recipe a little faster to prepare.  Also I add some crushed French Fried Onion Rings (the kind in the can) to the coating crumbs.....really good!!!

Tasty and fairly healthy. I saved time by shredding a small potato and squeezing out the excess moisture and adding that to the salmon mix. Worked out great.

In a hurry? Use prepared instant potatoes,canned salmon and dehydrated onions (added to boiled potatoe liquid) and proceed as directed.

I've been making Salmon Patties similar to these for years but with a few changes.  I mashed the potatoes and whip them before I add them to the salmon, and I use a mixture of flour and yellow corn meal instead of bread crumbs.  Whipping the potatoes and then folding them into the other ingredients makes them have an amazing crust.

I made these tonight with a few modifications and they were wonderful.  I doubled the recipe.  I had left over mashed potatoes so I used those.   I didn't have shallots so I used regular white onions, but I sauteed them in garlic and salt and pepper so they wouldn't taste so strong.  I also did not have cornflake crumbs so I used Panko Bread Crumbs instead.  I topped them with a sauce I made, combining goat cheese, chicken broth, dill, and a little corn starch.  Sounds weird, but it was heavenly.  Thanks for the great recipe!

We really like these patties, I had better luck using 2 eggs - helped hold them together better.

I added some dill and lemon juice.  Pretty good.  It could be really quick with some canned or pouch salmon and instant potatoes, but that might make it lose a star.

This was a toss up in my house - husband loved it, but I wasn't a huge fan.  I "winged" the recipe a bit, based on leftovers I had from this weekend.  I used salmon that had been slightly marinated in a garlic/thyme paste and garlic-mashed potatoes.  Not sure if my salmon and pototoe ratio was exact.  Didn't use any Italian seasoning as my salmon and potato already had garlic, thyme and salt/pepper.  Cornflakes are a terrific addition and really compliment the soft/flaky inside.  Super fast if you use leftovers.  I made an herb-mayo sauce that my husband loves... that saved it for me.  (Mayo, basil, parsley, lemon juice, djion mustard, cayenne pepper, green onion... sooo good!) Will try again.

Really yummy.  A great way to get rid of leftover salmon that also tastes great!  I almost like it better than a regular salmon filet.

Great salmon patty recipe!  I substituted herbed stuffing for the bread crumbs, but otherwise made it exactly the same.  Served it with a creamy dill sauce, texmati rice, and fresh fruit.  My husband, who doesn't care for salmon, enjoyed the meal!  Will definitely make again, next time with Old Bay instead of the italian seasonings.

I modified this recipe significantly and found it very flexible.  Instead of salmon, I used tilapia leftover from a recipe my family didn't like.  I think I probably used too much fish because the patties didn't stick together well, but I will know better next time.  I also substituted chopped onion for the shallot, and since I didn't feel like boiling and mashing one potato, I substituted a few baked tator tots.  Overall, a delicious way to get fish into my husband and kids!

Used leftover salmon filets and baked potato, which I mushed with my fingers, which worked just great in this recipe. Substituted crushed club crackers for breadcrumbs. Skipped the crushed cereal coating, and just kept the cakes frying until they were deep brown. These were perfect little cakes which my toddler and I enjoyed (to my joy because she usually refuses to eat salmon). 5 stars :)

As other reviews suggested, I used approx. 1/8c potato flakes vs. the red potato.  I also added 1/4tsp. dried dill & 1 garlic clove. Instead of salt – used about 1/2tsp. of Old Bay seasoning & a good shake of LA Gold (hot sauce).  We used an ice-cream scoop to form consistent-sized balls, which made pan-frying easy.  Very good!

I love that this recipe calls for fresh salmon as I think it makes for much tastier patties, but where is the seasoning?  I tried this and used some thawed hash browns and added dijon mustard, salt, pepper, minced garlic, and steak seasoning.  I think this is a good recipe that just needs a little tweaking.

Tried this last night.  It came amazing.  I used breadcrumb in place of cornflakes, but other than that, followed it to the T.  Also made a nice sauce with mayo, mustard and garlic and cooked up some asparagus in oil and garlic with a dash of balsamic vinegar.  Great meal and my fiance loved it, and she doesn't eat fish!  Thank you for the recipe!

I hate to be the voice of dissent, but I did not care for these.  I found them bland and dry.  Some type of dipping sauce for accompaniment is a must.  ETA: I'm changing my rating to give this an additional star because I found a creamy dill dressing for dipping that improves the flavour immensely.

These were very good, but I think next time they definitely need a little more kick.  I'm thinking of adding a touch of paprika and an Aoili.  They are tasty on their own but could use just a little extra.

I followed the recipe word for word, but it was okay. I'll probably take some other suggestions I saw out there. It didn't take me too long to make it, which is a miracle! I will make again, but with some tweaks.

I followed the recipe exactly and was actually not very impressed with this dish. If I make it again, I will definitely make a dipping sauce because without one, it was bland.

This was pretty good overall.  My fiance and I had fun making it together, but both agreed it would have been much faster and easier if it was made from leftover salmon and mashed potatoes.  We had it with pasta salad and made a simple mayonnaise-dill sauce to put on top of the patties.  Next time I think we'll grill them for added flare.

This was a good supper, but it wasn't outstanding. I will make it again because it was tasty, easy and something out of the ordinary.
