Incredibly simple and delicious!  Use a mild or hot salsa, along with 1 cup shredded mexican cheese (or whatever is in the fridge).  Don't bother using a mixer - just a wooden spoon will do the trick as long as the cream cheese is soft.  No one could guess what the ingredients were!

I've been making these for while and they're always a big hit. I add shredded cheddar cheese and a little garlic powder to taste. Don't use a mixer, you want it to have some texture.I go with a medium salsa since the cream cheese tones it down a bit. They don't look that appetizing, but once people taste them, they're addictive.

This was really easy, and they tasted okay, but really needed a little more to it - some zing or other flavor in there.

I'm horrible at cutting tortilla rollups, but I had some tortillas that I didn't want hanging around the fridge forever, so I thought I'd give this a try.  I probably shouldve listened to the reviewers who said NOT to put in the blender, but I did put it in the blender anyway--which makes it all runny and wierd, although it still tastes good.  Added some orange bell pepper and to one of them added salami for the bf.  I sliced with a pizza cutter, and, true to form, made a mess of them, but I guess since I'm not feeding them to company it doesn't matter.  Bf liked them--said they reminded him of buffalo dip.  Thanks for the recipe!

These do taste great. Why not just mix as a dip and eat with a chip rather than all this mess?

excellent! I used a container of whipped cream cheese and that helped with the mixing prcoess. I also used hot salsa because I thought it would become way too bland if I mixed mild salsa and cream cheese.  This is a great appetizer for a party or a great snack for a lazy saturday afternoon :)

Very good and easy !   We made these for my daughter's birthday party and they were a hit !   I did not use the full jar of salsa since it seemed to be getting thin as I added more.  Thank you for sharing !

This is so easy and the little rollups are addictive.  They're also pretty filling, so if you're only serving appetizers this is a good recipe to include so that people don't go hungry.

This was quick and easy. Because I read the other reviews I used hot salsa which gave all the flavor my group would need and used caution when adding the salsa into the mix.  Turned out perfect. Thank you!

Great appetizers.  Best to hand stir ingredients.  Use room temp flour tortillas.  Add shredded cheese and a half packet of taco seasoning (chopped black olives, chopped green chilies...the possibilities are endless).  Best to roll your tortillas up with the ingredients inside and refriderate them until firm prior to cutting them.  Delish!!!

ive been searching for a good recipe for these and this is the first ive tried that wasnt just someone telling me how to make them. these are ok. theyre pretty plain and i expected more from the salsa. i just made 2 tortillas using hot salsa for my dh and i to have on a snacky lunch plate we shared. i think this is the base of all of these rolled tortilla recipes. if i make this again ill add shredded cheese and maybe some rooster sauce. good if you like bland but probably not so if you like something more spicy.

They do taste good..and easy! I did add Chipolti seasoning and shredded mexican cheese..I found out if you spread too much on the tortilla..it mushes out when you cut it! I sprinkled with paprika for a 4th July party! Thanks for idea! Like others I mixed by hand for texture.

I had always wondered how these were made...
VERY easy. Don't have to use blender; I just used spoon and added some shredded cheddar cheese. The combinations are endless depending on type/flavor of salsa, cheese (or no extra), and extra seasonings you could put in.

I was VERY disappointed that a recipe that got 4.5 stars turned out as poorly as it did.  The consistency was horrible, in that it was way too runny and the filling oozed out.  The taste was ok, but there was not enough filling in the rolls.  Will stick to my old recipe.

I love it.  I added green chilis, black olives, and cheddar cheese to it along with a dash of taco seasoning.   I only made half a batch.  I also put them in the freezer to harden a bit.  I then cut them in the middle and worked my way to the ends.  It allows for the filling to spread out a bit so you can use the ends.

These were delish! I used 1/4 of the recipe just for me and hubby and used half the cream cheese and about half cup sharp cheddar and a dash of garlic salt. Also I used smaller tortillas I think 8 inch. They turned out tiny, very cute and better than I expected. I recommend to just add what you like to the filling to suit your needs, and freeze for a few mins if its too soft. I love this and will make again for sure!

This is so much easier than how I used to make them with ground meat. You need way more then 1 pkg. of cream cheese though. I used 12 oz. cream cheese to about 16 oz. salsa (mine was homemade and also a whole bag of shredded cheddar cheese.

Good, but I felt like a lot was wasted on the ends of the tortillas.  I only got about 6 roll-ups out of each one.  Not bad for such a simple recipe, though!

The base of these were good, but needed some extras to make it 5 star. I added chopped jalapeños and minced onion, it helped with the texture. Plus some shredded cheddar cheese and then they were fabulous!

This recipe is a solid foundation, but a bit bland on its own.  I used jalapeno cheddar wraps, and for the filling I only used about 1/2 cup salsa.  I added 1/2 block of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 2 tbsp sour cream.  The modified ones were awesome!

This was easy and well-received!  I made a double batch, and I used one jar of medium chunky salsa and one jar of corn/black bean chunky salsa.  I also added shredded cheese.  Yum!

I've made these often and i find it much easier to slice if you refrigerate after rolling for an hour or so. It also makes a much nicer presentation, easier to handle and less messy. Also at times added guac, refied beans, etc.

Mine were very messy/runny, but also very delicious. Will probably put them in the freezer next time so they aren't so soft. Great filling snack that requires very little prep time.

These were good just heavy for my taste.  I added diced red and orange peppers and some cayenne to spice them up.

Made this for a small gathering at my house.  The ladies were impressed, could not guess the ingredients.  I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and a little shredded cheese, yummy and quick!

Maybe just me, but the salsa was really strong against the cream cheese. Had leftovers when served @ a graduation party.  You can eat only a few of these so guess it is a good choice for an "appetizer". I have found the roll-ups with deli meats being more fulfilling and worth preparing/serving. Sorry won't make again.

I was really disappointed in this. I have had these before but did not know the ratio of salsa to cream cheese in order to make them.  This was obviously not it.  It was way to thin/soupy to spread and roll.  I did fix it by adding another 8 oz. cream cheese and 1 cup shredded cheese.  However, I feel I have to rate the original recipe.  Taste was really good.  Also, you have to refrigerate several hours before slicing.

This was very tasty as a dip, but for taquitos, were messy and unattractive. I added cilantro and green onions.
