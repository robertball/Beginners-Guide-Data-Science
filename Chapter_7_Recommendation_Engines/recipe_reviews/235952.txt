I am not typically a big fan of coffee cakes, but, my husband is and also loves cranberries,so, this seemed a win win.   I was pleasantly surprised that both my husband and I loved it!   The batter is thick, but, velvety which does make it somewhat difficult to spread into a floured pan, so, I probably didn't do it justice trying to layer with the cranberry sauce.  It still tasted wonderful though.   I think that the glaze is supposed to have 1 tsp. and not 1 tbsp. of almond flavoring.   I added about 1/2 tbsp. of flavoring before I realized and it was almost overwhelming.  Luckily I stopped at 1/2 tbsp! I also used butter instead of margarine.   The cake also took about 48 minutes in my oven to cook, but, ovens do vary so just be sure to test yours to be sure it is cooked.   I test mine with a long wooden skewer.   The cake was perfectly moist and the cranberry flavor was a nice touch.  I will definitely make again.

I didn’t have any white sugar so I used brown sugar and jellied cranberry sauce. I didn’t have confectioners sugar so I just iced the cake with regular icing I had in the pantry. My husband was sad at first because we didn’t have anything sweet in the house and everything is closed being that today is Christmas. He was super happy after I made this!!! I will definitely make it again.

Substituted 1/4 tsp orange extract for the almond, and dusted with powered sugar instead of glaze. Turned out perfect!

10.16.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/235952/sandys-cranberry-coffee-cake/ ...  Since the berries sank,  they stuck to the pan; not their fault.  ;D  Maybe my pan is large - don't think so  - but having two layers of filling for a not-much-higher-than-usual sheet cake doesn't make sense.  They'd be quite close - were quite close  -  together.  I'm thinking for the berries to be filling - in, not almost on - to place the sauce on after putting all the cake batter in the pan.  That way as it bakes, sinks, it'll end up closer to the middle.   I was so surprised that canned cranberry sauce was so good with this.   Almost stunned really.  The cake part reminded me of something - maybe just yellow cake.  Haha.  It was good, but I think I'll try this trick with another recipe.  'Was out of confec sugar so put 1/4t almond extract in 1/4c granulated sugar & stirred.  No liquid.  It looked like snow!  :)  I only sprinkled on a little & it disappeared by day two; the snow, not the cake.

This was so good and moist!  I substituted with gluten-free flour blend because my daughter is celiac. The whole family loved it!

I made this for Christmas morning. Everyone loved it and it will be a tradition for us. The only thing I noted was I put too much batter down the first round and so my layers of cranberry sauce were too close together. It should be less than 1/3 the batter since the pan is curved at the top and doesn't take as much to make the first layer.

I followed the directions exactly except used 1 tsp. of Almond extract in the glaze.  It was wonderful.  I brought to work for a pot luck and everyone loved it.  I was asked for the recipe and she has already made it as well.
