I just made this recipe using my own brownie recipe. It come out outstanding! My neighbors couldn't believe that it was butter/margarine free. Thanks for the great idea and recipe.

These were very good, just make sure you don't put too much brownie mix in...they explode. The kids liked that though, gave them more brownie.

I think people were more impressed with the idea than the execution. I wasn't crazy about the dough with the brownie texture. Also, if I made these again, I would use a different dough recipe. The brownie expands during baking and the dough had a lot of trouble staying closed - even with pinching overload. A great idea to spice up regular old Hamentashen!

Great dough.  I put chocolate chips instead of brownie mix and tasted great.
