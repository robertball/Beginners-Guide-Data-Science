I made this last night for the first time - absolutely delicious!  I didn't change a thing and it was awesome.  I think the most important thing is to make sure you salt the water before you put the grits in - otherwise it's almost impossible to get your grits salty enough and it will be very bland.

Perfect recipe. First time to  try grits and everyone loved it! The only thing I suggest is after 30 minutes of baking in oven, then top with cheese. Mine browned too early.

Very tasty and filling.  I added 2 more eggs and cooked a small onion with the sausage.  Instead of messing up a baking dish, I just put everything back in the skillet and popped it in the oven.  Next time, I think I'll try mixing some parmesan cheese in as well.

Made a low-fat and vegetarian version of this last week and was thrilled with how well it turned out. I often make a breakfast casserole at the beginning of the week and just heat up a serving before work so that I can have a  healthy meal in just a couple of minutes. I used Morningstar Farms soy sausage crumbles in place of the pork sausage, and sauteed it with an onion in a splash of olive oil. Made it VERY low-fat by using Eggbeaters, a blend of fat-free and reduced-fat cheddar, almond milk, and low-fat butter. It was still absolutely delicious, and only had about 4-5 grams of fat and less than 250 calories per serving. My boyfriend says this is his favorite breakfast casserole I have made. Planning to make it again this week.

This is wonderful! I was raised on the West Coast and never tasted grits until about six months ago. I had no idea what I was missing! Great recipe, thank you.

Fantastic!  Added 2 more eggs per other suggestions, and waited until the last 5-10 minutes to put the top cheese on.  I want to try this with bacon or ham, and maybe add some mushrooms!  Yummy!

Edit - 4/17/12 - How wild is this, I made this the other day and had totally forgotten that I'd made it before until I went to review it this morning!  I made it last week with bacon, and it was fantastic!!  I had a large pot-luck brunch (130 women) and I tripled it, and baked it in 2 9x13 pans (it did need a little extra cooking time).  I had NO leftovers! I'm making again right now with sausage for another pot-luck brunch.  I know it will be a hit!  I won't forget about this one again! :-)

I'm not sure I baked it long enough as it was not as firm as I would have liked. Husband loved it though

Yummo!! Added 2 extra eggs and used hot sausage (because that's all I had) - even my picky son who doesn't eat grits managed to eat it!!  Grits is a staple around this house for the rest of us, so hubby and daughter loved it!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Very good, but more of a breakfast item than a dinner item as others had suggested.  Serve with tabasco.  A very simple basic meal.  I think it would be good to make the night before and just pop in the oven when you have over night guests.

I used Italian pork, which gave it a lot of zing.  In the future I will add two more eggs and more cheese.

This is a very nice casserole.  I used eggbeaters, turkey sausage, and lowfat cheddar to cut the calories and cholesterol, and it was still delicious.  My husband, who's rarely a fan of low-cal foods, went back for seconds!  I didn't tell him it was a "skinny" version -- and he never guessed.

Love it.  My husband & I had something simular to this years ago & I searched for the recipe for years.  We add bacon to ours and extra cheese and serve over hash browns.

This was a huge hit with my family! I made it as-is. (Just used Egg Beaters instead of real eggs because it's all I had on hand.)

I made a mistake and oversalted the water for the grits as stated in another review. But if had thought about it there is salt in the cheese and in the cut up sausage links I used and there was no need for xtra. But it turned out great  other than that. I did add garlic powder....Cheese grits and garlic powder go together like pb n j.  Got to luv it.  Hubby said that this was a keep. I am learning that make the recipe as is and then the next time make changes if needed..Im out for now...Do and cook gr8 things!

I have to admitt that I wasn't 100% sold on this recipe. Now that I have cooked it and ate it...SOLD! This recipe will definitely be going into my cookbook for future use. I'm not big on leftovers and I took some leftovers with me for lunch for 2 days.

I had to up this one to 5 stars because the more I had it the more it grew on me.  And I kept having to eat it because people kept asking for it. I use turkey sausage and  1 cup pepper jack with 1/2 cup cheddar on top.  I really think the pepper jack makes it even better.  Have given out numerous copies of this one already - even had people call me for it because they heard how good it was (and they hadn't even tasted it.)  And to top it off, my picky 8 yr old who HATES grits, loved this.

My favorite part of this recipe was stirring everything together in the saucepan. The casserole cut into attractive portions. The one I used to make was layered and didn't have a nice presentation. I make it the night before and my kids reheat what they need before school. They eat it after school, too!

This casserole makes me want to move to the South!  I at first thought this was a breakfast dish, but it was perfect for dinner.  I also couldn't believe that it was good cold too.  So versatile.  I did not think it was too salty.  I did put the final cheese on at 30 mins to prevent over browning.  You won't be dissapointed!

Delicious! It reminds me of when I was a child visiting my grandmother and she would make me grits, bacon, and fried eggs.  My favorite was to mix it all up together! I did add an extra egg and knowing how bland grits can be I used 2-3 tsps of kosher salt instead of 1 tsp.  My kids couldn't get enough of it and neither could I!  I will definitely be making this many more times in the future. Thank you for this ultimate comfort food!

This has become a household favorite! It can be a meal in itself or can be a side dish. We sauted Maple flavored sausage and also added onions and mushrooms. Very good and highly recommend!!!

I made this for church and I had people asking me what it was because it was so good.  Multiple people mentioned that they didn't eat grits, but they loved the casserole.  Thanks for the recipe.

my husband, who does NOT like breakfast foods, actually ate the leftovers from this meal too! I thought it made quite a bit of food.

I love grits. I love sausage. I love cheese grits. I do not love this dish.  It was very dry and not one person liked it.  I won't be making this recipe again, sorry.

This was pretty good tasting but we had to eat a little extra to feel full. We didn't get quite 8 servings, maybe more like 4. Also, I added more meat as well as onions and mushrooms. If I had it for breakfast I'd consider drizzling a litle maple syrup over it all.

This was very good.  My family just finished dinner and everyone ate it up. I added onions and green peppers to the sausage while it was browning and mixed velveeta cheese into the grits.

Delicious!  I even cooked it for 30 minutes too long (didn't hear the timer) and it was still good.

You can't go wrong with this recipe! I've eaten grits for 50 years and my wife hates them. But she will eat these cold out of the pan on the stove! Drain your sausage well and don't attempt to use any extra cheese for the best results. We love trying it with different sausages and smokehouse breakfast sausage is our favorite. It also halves wonderfully for 3 - 4 people. I always have a 1/2 lb of bulk sausage and shredded cheese in the fridge for when we want to make a 1/2 recipe for Sunday brunch!

Instead of melting the cheese on top I mix mine with the grits. The taste can't be beat.

I actually make this dish a lot. I love it. I will often replace the sausage with shrimp. I've also used Cajun sausage and a bit of Cajun seasonings for an extra bite. So good. I've tried other recipes but this one is the best.

I really like this recipe.  It was easy to make and my 15 month old son and all his buddies at daycare loved it! (I had so many leftovers I knew I would never be able to eat, I sent breakfast to daycare the next day).  I have to say it is a bit bland so you can spice it up with Franks Red Hot prior to chowing down or do what others have suggested and add in spicy sausage *like chorizo* or add garlic, cook the meat with onion and/or other veggies.  It was a good solid dish and did make a lot of food.

This was just okay. I may try it again, but I will definitely try "hot" sausage, and maybe some garlic powder. It needs something added to it.

This is a really good breakfast casserole. Some recipes for this type of casserole don't call for eggs, but I really like their inclusion, and also the way they're added in this recipe. Okay, for my changes: I just sprinkled about a teaspoon of garlic powder on the sausage. I also cooked mine in the skillet; I used a cast iron skillet. It was beautiful, and lightly brown all over. The family loved it and wants it again!
