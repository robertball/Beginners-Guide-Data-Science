I used this recipe as a base, but I made significant changes. I roasted the tomatillos after cutting them in half and putting them face down on a baking pan. I cooked them until the tops were brown and they were soft. I combined them with a ripe avocado, half a bunch of cilantro, salt, lime, and 1/4 of a white onion in the blender. I omitted garlic because I find garlic to overpower the other flavors, even though I usually love garlic. The resulting salsa is amazing!!

WOW! I followed this to a tee. It is much better than those good mexican resturants serve with their chips.  It is a keeper.  No changes needed. A+

Instead of using water, try sour cream.  It makes it a little richer but also a little thicker.  I left out the garlic too as a personal thing.  Very good though.  And I agree...It's meant to be consumed with chips!

A squeeze of lime juice really does the trick to keeping the avocado a nice green color!

I'm giving this a 4 because my boyfriend really liked it. I didn't like it so well, however. I wish I had used more avocado, because, as is, I could barely taste it. I added a little cumin to improve the flavor. The ingredients don't need to be minced, since they're going into the food processor, anyway. Save yourself some time and just roughly chop them.

This recipe was really good. I added an extra avocado as one other reviewer suggested, and I'm glad I did. Next time will add juice of lime as well. This was too thick for my blender, and my food processor was too small, so had to do it in 2 batches. It was gone in 2 days!

I really like this recipe. The avocado adds a creaminess that's unexpected and the heat isn't too hot. I didn't put in as much cilantro and added lemon juice in hopes it'll keep the avocado from browning in the fridge. Next time I'll add lime if I remember to pick some up.

This is the best salsa I have ever made! I tried putting it on a salad, which was a complete waste. It wasn't very good on lettuce, and I really wish I had saved some to try with chips because the salsa was so good.

This salsa is AMAZING!  I make some at least twice a week for my husband and myself.  Sometimes I leave half the Jalapeno seeds for extra spice.

This recipe really was great! As others had suggested, I felt it needed some salt and a little more acidity. I would suggest lime juice, but for those feeling adventurous, try what I did - about 2 tbsp of tequila! It added the perfect kick, especially after heating up as a sauce to dress some chicken with. Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

Great recipe but I thought it needed a little fresh lime juice and salt in the end.  Will definitely make it again!

Very easy and VERY tasty!  We have a local restaurant that serves a dip similar to this.  I roasted the tomatillos before I blended everything together and then squeezed the juice of one lime into the mix. It was fantastic!  My Latina mother-in-law gave it her stamp of approval.  This recipe is a keeper.
