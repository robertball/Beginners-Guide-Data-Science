I have made this recipe before and really enjoyed it but tonight I added in a few things that made it phenomenal!  First:  I added in cinnamon to the flour/sugar/butter mixture (1/2 tsp and could have done more).  Second:  I used buttermilk.  Third:  I added in almond extract to the cake batter part (about 1/2 tsp).  Fourth:  I used more blueberries than called for.  It was divine!  I did have to cook it a touch longer, could have been due to more blueberries, but I don't mind.  It's SO good!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This one is headed for the Allrecipes Hall of Fame!!! This was so good. It was easy, didn't have any complicated ingredients (I had everything in my kitchen and it's not even that well stocked at the moment), and tasted so good. We had it with coffee this morning. I made it for Father's Day breakfast. It had a simple, old-fashioned very slight sweetness, not the sickening sweetness of store-bought blueberry muffins, for example. I did as someone suggested and added a little cinnamon to the topping, but I suspect this would have been just as terrific without that addition. This is one of those recipes I'll grab when I need a tasty dessert for a party, potluck, housewarming, or whatever! Infact, my new neighbor is 9 monthes pregnant and I can't wait until she has the baby so I can rush over with some Blueberry Boy Bait and say Congratulations :) :) :) Thanks so much!

This was excellent.  Next time I will try a little cinnamon in the 3/4C. saved topping. Maybe a few more berries.

You would think it's too hot to be running the oven in Phoenix in July, but for this recipe it was worth it.  Take advantage of the short blueberry season for this, no matter how hot it is outside, and use an entire pint box of blueberries.  Really good "coffee cake" style product, I only added some Mexican vanilla to the liquid ingredients.  I'm sure this would be good with raspberries or blackberries also.  It was excellent served warm with a scoop of homemade blueberry ice cream, too, but can stand alone just fine.  Thank you, Hannah!  PS:  Best recipe name I've seen!

This recipe is fabulous!  I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the cake and cinnamon to the topping.  As suggested by others, I increased the blueberries to 2 cups.  I used frozen blueberries that were thawed.  I mixed the blueberries in some flour and sugar before putting them on the batter and had no problem with sinking or bleeding.    The cake was so light and just sweet enough!

This was great!! It was very moist & delicious. The only problem I had was that the topping was absorbed when the cake puffed up. But it was still great though. Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!  I used a whole 8oz bag of frozen blueberries (defrosted, of course) and added a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar on top and it was just soooooo good!  Definitely a crowd-pleaser!  :)  (p.s. my hubby kept saying that it wasn't cooked all the way, but it's just the egg whites -- they're *supposed* to be kinda gooey) --

UPDATE: 7/24/06 -- I just made this again for my extended family (twice)... the first time I used fresh (dry) blueberries and they didn't sink but I came to the conclusion that I actually liked them to sink.  The second time I used fresh (wet) blueberries and it was perfect... er... except for my mistaking the oregano for cinnamon!  Yep, that's right, I sprinkled oregano on top.  When I realized my mistake (after banging my head on the pantry door a few times) I doubled up on the cinnamon and added a sprinkling of sugar.  It was still yummy :)

OH BOY!  This is wonderful.  Just took it to church for after service and it is gone.  Instead of using a 9X13, I used a greased and floured bundt pan and baked it for 55 minutes which is perfect.  Also used 2 cups of frozen blueberries that were thawed, rinsed, drained well, sprinkled and tossed with a little sugar.  This way they did not run into the batter.  Layered batter, blueberries, batter, blueberries, batter.  After baking, cooled for 8 minutes then turned out onto a cooling rack.  It came right out without sticking.  A dream of a recipe in all ways!

Top recipe that's easy to make.  Tip: If you're using frozen blueberries make sure you let them defrost first, mine sunk into the cake too much.

I thought this was yummy, but it didn't knock my socks off.  In fact, it is the only baked good I have ever taken into work that had leftovers at the end of the day.  I think there are similar recipes that are just as tasty and don't involve beating up egg whites

I just finished making this and cannot stop eating it.  It is sooo good. I made this a day earlier, which i should not have done, i may eat it all.  I did make some added suggestions, i added vanilla to the mix, cinnamon to the topping and used brown sugar instead of white for the topping and used 2 cups of fresh blueberries (they did not sink).

Excellent cake.  I followed the recipe pretty well as far as ingredients go - except that I had only one whole egg and not quite a cup of blueberries.  So, I put in the whole egg, and I added cut up strawberries with the blueberries for the topping.  Cake rose well - no problem.  Bit of a problem getting it out of the pan intact, though.  That's the reason for docking one star. Next time I'll line the pan with parchment paper to lift it out easily. I drizzled an icing sugar frosting over the cake while still warm.  Couldn't resist taking a small piece off before it's even cooled even though I'm taking it to a potluck dinner tonight.  Tastes great.  Will make again using same method (using only one egg and not separating it).

I made this years ago and didn't even realize I got it from on here! When I made it I put it in a well greased round cake pan and baked for 50 minutes. When it was done I inverted it onto a cake stand and cut into 8 triangles. It tasted like a nicely sweet blueberry coffee cake. Thanks for the reminder of what to make again when I have some leftover blueberries.

I highly recommend this recipe IF you use 2 cups of blueberries as recommended by other reviewers.  I used two heaping cups of blueberries and it was perfect.  Both my husband and I loved the buttery rich flavor of the batter.  Even though it is a 9x13 size cake instead of the usual 8x8 size that you usually see for blueberry cake recipes, it will go just as quickly.

I have been making this for 20 years or so and it's fabulous.  The original recipe came from a 1954 Pillsbury Bakeoff booklet. (yard sale find) It was 2nd place in the Junior Category.  The only change I make is add more blueberries.  I have even accidently forgotten to reserve the topping, and it's turned out fine.  Delicious and addictive.

Very good but my family thought it tasted a lot like coffee cake and they needed a glass of milk to wash it down. I followed the recipe except I added another 1/2 cup of blueberries and 1 teas. of vanilla and 1 teas. cinnamon for more flavor. Baked it for 45 min. and it was just right. Next time I am going to make a blueberry recipe that doesn't call for quite as much work. It took more than 20 min. of prep time.

There will be a line up for this delightful cake...I made it for my husband to take to work with him.  The new title of "Blueberry Crew Bait" has been adopted as they liked it so much they actually did their work in hopes for more!!!!  I also made it with fresh strawberries and it turned out great.

This was delicious. I made two small adjustments by adding a bit of cinnamon per the other reviews, and using an 8x8 pan. The cake took about 10 more minutes to finish. It's important to mix the egg whites as described to keep the cake light and moist. That may also be what helps keep the blueberries from sinking.

My family and I enjoyed this so much! I didn't put in quite as much sugar as was called for and we thought it was just as great. I don't think I would want it any sweeter. Just a note: the blueberries and strudel all fell to the bottom of the cake. I was using a bunt pan maybe that had something to do with it. One other suggestion, MAKE SURE TO GREASE THE PAN!!!
Thanks for the great recipe. Fresh blueberries were great in it. I will be making it again.

Very good.  It was almost all gobbled up by the time I left work yesterday, and that's good with our group--especially since we only had a few people in the office yesterday!  I liked it, but definitely think you can add more fruit.  I used two cups of mixed berries from the freezer and think I couldve used 4 cups just as easily.  I did mix the fruit with flour and sugar, and they sunk a little but into the middle so it was actually pretty perfect.  Very light, flavorful coffee cake without too much sweetness.  I did, however, discover the need for a new springform pan, which broke while I was baking this.  :(  Still, it baked at the amount of time given in the recipe even in a springform.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was awesome!  I did add about 1/2 cup more blueberries because we love blueberries.  Also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to topping.  Will definitely be making this again!

I held onto this recipe for a couple years before I pulled it out and made it....wish I would have made it earlier. It was wonderful! The best part is that it can be a snack, a breakfast pastry, served warm with ice cream, taken to a picnic, or just served alone like cake. I did add a bit more sugar with the crumble topping, you have to judge how sweet your berries are. Can't wait to try it with some fresh black berries.

This is great, have made it many times with no changes. Comes together easily and comes out tasting wonderful! Also have done it using peaches in place of blueberries and cherries in place of blueberries both came out very good. Thank you for sharing Hannah!

It took all of 16 hours for my family of 4 to devour this cake.  It was light when it came out of the oven but the next day it was much heavier and dense - just the way I like it!  I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, fat free half and half instead of milk, and 2 cups of berries. Next time I will probably use some whole wheat flour, Splenda and egg substitute to make it a bit healthier.  Excellent!!

This was pretty good!  I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I added a cup of oatmeal and cut the WWF to 1 1/2.  1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla.  I just put everything in my mixer and made 3 loaves.  So good!!!!  Everything was gone in 2 days.

This cake was delicious! Everybody loved it at the office. I took the advice of other readers and made the following changes: 1. Added 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and lemon zest (approx 3/4-1tsp), 2. Used approx 2 cups frozen blueberries that were almost completely thawed, 3. Mixed batter for 4 minutes, and 4. Added 1 tsp cinnamon to the topping mix. My blueberries did not sink because after thawing, I dried them with a paper towel and coated them lightly with flour. I then gently placed them on top of the cake batter. 

This cake was moist, light, and the tartness of the blueberries balanced very well with the sweetness of the cake. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad!! I liked how simple and not overly sweet this recipe is. I unfortunately experienced the same trouble as a few others with the blueberries sinking. DO NOT follow the reviewer who suggested coating them in sugar to prevent that--it only made the blueberries heavier and more apt to sink! I would, however, toss them in the flour IF they are fresh and dry. Any moisture will collect too much flour and defeat the purpose. Anyway, I will try these again and see with my new mixer if I can get those peaks stiffer to keep the blues from sinking. The rest of it was yummy though, a great breakfast option for my easily bored husband!

YUMMY!  I added 2 1/2 cups of Blueberries (we love blueberries!) and cut the sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  It was perfect!  Since I only have one electric mixer, I did the egg whites first and took them out and put them in a bowl, then I mixed the other ingredients together for 3 minutes.  Then I folded in the egg whites.  It seemed easier than transgering the batter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

04-15-16 ~ Made this for payday breakfast at school. It is very moist and loaded with flavor. It would be very simple to swap out different berries in this coffeecake. The edge cooks faster than the center, so I had to cover it with foil until the center was completely baked.

Great recipe! The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I took the advice of others & added flavoring & cinnamon. And I also used wheat flour & frozen blueberries. Turned out wonderfully...thanks!

I would actually give this 4 1/2 stars if I could... The flavour definitely improved over time but even after I added almond extract and cinnamon it was still nothing special, very good, just not amazing

The texture is fantastic 5 stars. The taste is about 4.5. I used about 1.5 cups of fresh blueberries and it wasn't enough and really couldn't taste them. Could be the blueberries.I will make this again.

This recipe is awsome. I double the berries, and do a blueberry raspberry combo. Other than that i following the recipe exactly. I find if i use fresh berries they stay on top. Frozen tend to sink. But it is great either way!

This recipe was AWESOME! It was very moist and not too sweet. I put the crumb topping on and then drizzled a sugar icing over the top of mine and cut it in narrow slices like a danish. It went over really well! Excellent recipe.

This cake was fantastic!  Very light and fluffy texture, and the blueberries and crumb mixture add great flavor.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used a bundt pan and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the reserved crumb mixture.  Mixing the batter for 3 minutes and the egg whites for about 2-3 will prevent the blueberries from sinking.  Next time I will put the blueberries and crumb mixture in the middle of the cake rather than on top.  I didn't think this one through and only realized after the cake came out of the oven that, because I used a bundt pan, what is supposed to be the top of the cake is now the bottom.  No matter, we still ate the whole thing!

This is a really good recipe.  The cake is moist & the topping is perfect. I used double the blueberries because I love them.  This would be great either for Sunday brunch or a dessert.

Pretty good. It's a little dry and I think it needs more blueberries, but that could be personal preference. I did add a 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and about a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon as some other reviews said too but overall it's pretty good.

I don't like blueberries.  Ever.  Loved this recipe.  1 cup of blueberries suited me just fine, but if I were to make it with another berry I would probably up it to 1 and 1/2 cups.  To me, cinnamon doesn't seem appropiate for this recipe.  Vanilla woulg go well, but i left it out anyway.  Cinnamon and vanilla seem a bit warm for a summer dessert.  Lastly, if you don't want the blueberries to sink, add a tablespoon of flour to them.  I accidentally left it in for 47 minutes and it was perfect.  Not 'jiggly' like i read in another review.  Delicious and easy!!

This recipe is delicious.  Classic taste and not hard to make.   Next time I will add extra blueberries, because I love blueberries.  I had no problem with the berries sinking, maybe because I beat the egg whites enough.  I will definately make this again

A very nice cake. My blueberries did not sink at all and the topping added some interest.  Everyone enjoyed this goodie. I will make again.

I've been making this recipe for years and have always had great success!  The recipe I use is a bit different, but I'm sure this one comes out as well.  As far as the blueberries sinking - who cares?! This cake is so good it doesn't matter where they are - just enjoy it!

Easy and delicious!!
I must admit I thought it was going to be a "crumble" style cake so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the oven :)
I used icing sugar and cinnamon instead of flour when I greased the bowl...very yummy :)

I got a bunch of blueberries on sale, planning to make blueberry pie, but I didn't want to make pie crust, so I chose this instead!  I'm SO glad I did because this was delicious.  It barely made it through the evening.  I had the last piece for breakfast.  My mom enjoyed it so much that she got a copy of the recipe from me.  Only thing I would change is that it could use more blueberries.  This is SO good!!

My family and friends love this recipe. It's the perfect cake for family dinners, Sunday brunch or just a quick snack. I add a tsp. of cinnamon to the topping as other reviewers suggested and used two cups of frozen blueberries. Well worth the effort to separate the eggs. This recipe is perfect everytime - just the right hint of sweetness and juicy fruit taste! I followed the posts for use in a bundt pan and it came out gorgeous - a little smaller than your usual bundt cake - but really pretty and super delicious.

I was looking for something to do with blueberries besides a crisp when I came across this recipe.  I had everything on hand so I gave it a try.  My 2 younger boys (9&11) think it's great. It would make an excellent brunch dish.  Not overly sweet.

Terrific!  I was a bit skeptical that this might be a little too much work with the egg separating, etc.  However, it looked so beautiful when I took it out of the oven (no sinking berries or streusel - fresh berries are the best!) that I knew it was worth the tiny bit of effort.  It turned out to be surprisingly easy to make and those who have tried it said it is "the best thing" they have ever eaten!  Can't ask for a better compliment!  I had to use buttermilk in place of regular milk because it was all I had.  Also, I used a pint (2 cups) of blueberries.  Apparently, it did nothing to harm the flavor!  I cannot wait to buy more blueberries in season and make it again!

Awesome recipe!  So buttery and delish, it was a perfect 4th of July dessert!  Per other reviewers' posts, I used a whole pint of blueberries.  I will make more crumble next time to sprinkle on top.

I give this one 5 stars easily. I have made some many of these now. I just joined so I didn't respond. But personally I cover the top with blueberries! So I couldn't tell you how many I put on! This is an excellent recipe and i HIGHLY recommend it!

My husband's mom used to make this when he was younger, and he has been begging me to make it for him.  It was easy to prepare and he loved it!  I accidently put the egg whites in when it says to put in the yolks, but the cake still turned out the way he remembers it.  I would add more blueberries that the recipe calls for - at least 1-1/2 cups.  Great recipe!

Tastey but a bit plain. Extra blueberries are a must and we added lemon zest and sprinkled with lemon juice instead of cinnamon. Really perked it up.

Had this once before (store-bought) when visiting friends. I had never heard of it before and with some vanilla ice cream, it was exquisite!! Looked up this recipe when I got home and have made it twice w/ friends. Hoping to make it a third time!!!! This recipe is so easy and delicious. And it's not incredibly unhealthy, either, so I can eat a lot of it without feeling guilty:) So amazing!! Definitely the best thing I have ever put in my mouth. Deserves way more than five stars!! I think 100000 would be good...

This  is a different "boy bait" than I have tried before. It's not as good because the crumb topping didn't get crisp and stay sugary. Good, not great.

Absolutely perfect. I lowered the oven temperature to 325°F and added an extra 15 minutes to the overall bake time and it came wonderfully moist and tender, not at all over done. I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and added some cinnamon to the topping and vanilla to the cake. Next time I will mix some extra blueberries into the cake batter. This cake was a hit at home and at work!

This is a good coffee cake recipe. I increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups and felt that it could have used more.

My husband made this cake for breakfast this morning.  It had a terrific flavor and was light and fluffy.  Since my husband made it, I can guarantee that the ingredients and directions were followed to a tee.  Yum!  **Update: I made this using frozen blueberries that were thawed and mixed with a small amount of flour and sugar.  It worked perfectly.  Still light and fluffy.  The sugary topping is wonderful.  I personally love that it does not have cinnamon in it.

This was pretty good and simple enough to make.  I used frozen blueberries and next time I will add more.  The topping is very good and "makes" the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This has been our go too holiday breakfast for years! We first had it when we visited friends and sad to say I ate a lot of it!  I got the recipe within days from her and I just love this!  Nothing to change, it's perfect!  My sons friends love having this when they come visit or they request it occasionally and make a batch for him to bring! I think the only thing I ever did differently was increase the blueberries!

I made this the first time for a neighborhood potluck and it was an absolute hit! The ratio of blueberries to cake is perfect, and it smells like heaven while baking. Perfect as a coffee cake or as a dessert served with ice cream. Definitely will be making this again!!

Very moist, dense and flavorful cake. I added cinnamon, vanilla extract and lemon extract.  I cooked it in a 8 inch springform pan and finished it with a lemon drizzle.

I used a 15x9x2" glass baking dish and increased the ingredients by 50%.  Since it's winter, I substituted three cans of sour cherries for the blueberries (I drained the cherries in a strainer for at least one hour before starting the recipe).  I also added two teaspoons of vanilla and a quarter teaspoon cinnamon with the wet ingredients.  As for the sour cherries, I add them along the side of the pan first to ensure every single piece of this coffeecake has plenty of fruit in it.  I also cook it approximately 10 minutes longer (60 minutes versus the 50 specified) and test it with a fork in the middle.  It comes out world class!!!

Great recipe. Better and lighter and less sweet than my Normal blueberry buckle.  And hubby liked it more.  Only change I made was adding more blueberries than it calls for.  Only downside is it dirties more bowls!

I've been making this recipe for close to 10 years and is loved by all who eat it! It's definitely worth taking the time to whip the egg whites to stiff peaks as it helps prevent the berries from sinking.

I did what the recipe said then did what Lindalou did then doubled the blueberries.  I then cooked it at the regular time but turned the convection on.  So I know that doesn't help everyone but that is what I was able to do. The blueberries were picked within 24 hours they were Concord and Earliblues types. There is so many recipes and I don't often repeat one but this one is a keeper.  I used olive oil spray in a can on my pan then put a half cup of flour in a sifter and used it to flour the pan.  Shake it around to get the sides then turn it upside down and start banking on it till the clumps come out.  

Thank you again Ms Lindalou2002

This is one of my most treasured recipes I got from my grandmother.  In the '50s, she was famous for making this blueberry cake, which she would frequently whip up for guests.  The simple but delicious flavors feel a little retro as compared to more aggressively flavored coffee cakes, but everyone always has seconds (and thirds and fourths) when they try it.

This recipe is great as a breakfast coffee cake when room temperature, or it makes for a decadent dessert when you serve it warm with whipped cream.  I personally prefer it as coffee cake.  It's light and not overly sweet but melts in your mouth.

I've seen variations with a little bit of sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top, but I personally love the buttery flavor of the original.

My copy of the recipe calls for a 12x8x2 pan, and I do think that size (if you can find it) makes for a slightly better height to the cake.

6.5.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/36829/blueberry-boy-bait/ ... Partial review (in the oven still :D):  I made changes, yes, so make your faces if ya want.  I don't think they're drastic, but, yes, guilty, I am... I only used 10T butter (that's about 1T less, is all), added 1/2t cinnamon.  I beat the eggs well & added those to the milk & then to the dry mixture.  With two (yes, two!) cups berries on top, I'm not seeing how whipping the egg whites would have much lightness.  :/  I added 4t flour to the berries - they're very juicy (& frozen).  I'm baking this at 375 in metal.  I floured the pan, too.  I figured it wouldn't hurt.  :D  It's competitor is Blueberry Crumb Bars, in glass.  They're both in.  :)... 'Done in 40 mins.  Results:  It's a half (although I gave it a full) star better than its competitor.  'Definitely not bad, but needs a little something to be a higher rating.  Maybe sub brown sugar?  The cake part is kind of spongy.  'Bet I could use 9T (or even 8T) & it would be notsospongy & still good.  The top's a little crisp.  I might make it again.  Two cups berries were not too much.  Three?  I'll try that next time, if there is one.  :D  ... One more thing: This isn't a beauty, it's not ugly, but it's not a "looker" either.  Mine looked like the fifth photo.  It doesn't fill the 9x13 high enough so maybe a 9x11 would be a better choice.  I wouldn't refer to this as a coffeecake as the description says.  It's a cake with blueberries in it.  :?  Huh?  :D

Made this for a church meeting and got rave reviews!  I took suggestions from the reviews and added almond flavoring and doubled the blueberries.  The blueberries were frozen from my garden last summer and I stirred about 1/4 c. flour to 2 c frozen blueberries.  Turned out perfect.  They didn't sink and they cooked up just fine.  (I always add my blueberries frozen and haven't had any problems).  I did add about 10 minutes to the cooking time.  My 'go to' recipe for blueberries used to be Blueberry Buckle, but I now have a new one!

Absolutely delicious!  I, too, added vanilla & cinnamon to mix, doubled the blueberries, and lined my pan with parchment paper for easy removal.  Drizzled top with simple white glaze.  Will definately make again.  Many many thanks for recipe!

Have made this for years and it's still one of my favorite blueberry desserts. Use up to 2 cups of blueberries. Not overly sweet-perfect!

This was good, but I think I'll add some baking soda next time because it was very flat.  I also only cooked it for 35 minutes and it was burnt on the edges and bottom.  1.5 cups blueberries would be better too I think.

This is a delicious, moist version of a blueberry coffeecake.  I used freshly-frozen blueberries and put in closer to 2 cups rather than the called-for 1-cup measurement.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.

This cake was really good.  I added cinnamon to the batter and the topping.  Substituted buttermilk for the milk.  This recipe should have more blueberries.

I realize I'm in the minority giving only three stars. It's definitely a tasty dessert, but it wasn't outstanding.  1-1/2 or 2 cups of blueberries would have been better. VERY buttery flavor. I might read all the reviews for tweaks and try again. Thanks

This is a very light and moist cake.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the top portion and I also used 2 cups of blueberries vs. one.  I lvoed this recipe and plan to make it again, this time trying raspberries. MMmmmmmmmm

Delicious coffee cake that's moist, and with light texture. I added 1 t. of vanilla extract to the batter, and 1/2 t. cinnamon to the crumb topping.  It is definitely not the quickest or least complicated to make, but I am happy with the results of all the labor I put into this, not to mention all the dirty dishes!  I would make this again when I get hold of fresh blueberries.

This was amazing.  I had a lot of blueberries left over from last season and this was perfect to use some of them up.  i probably used about 3 cups instead of the one and added some cinnamon  to the topping

Fabulous! I substituted soy milk and splenda blend and was too lazy to separate and beat eggs.  I added chopped walnuts and it came out great, no sinking of berries or topping.  My husband loved this and it's so easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe

I followed the recipe exactly as written and was disappointed. It did taste great, but all the berries and topping sunk in like alot of the other reviewers said.

This is better than Bluberry Buckle because there is no shortening in it. I purposefully coated the berries with flour so they would sink. This is moist and delicious. I had the same issue that another reviewer did, the cake puffed up and the topping became incorporated but it still tasted great. I love it just as it is but I may cut the sugar down next time to save some calories. Yum.

I coppied this recipe about two years ago and have made it over and over. Moist and yummy. Great with a meal or served as a snack. Sometimes I add just a few raspberries for a change in flavor.

Turned out perfectly and just like the photo,even though I used sour cream instead of milk. Thank you, for a very useful recipe, I'm going to try it out with other fruit too.  I did find it rather sweet for me, but everyone else liked it just as it is.

This is my husband's favorite cake from childhood.  He likes the berries doubled, which makes it too soggy for most people.  This is the perfect way to use up that extra cup of blueberries after you've divided up the others for pies and jams.

This was an amazing recipe!  I "tweaked" it a bit as well by adding 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of lemon extract.  Also, I made it in a springform pan instead of the 9x13 and it was perfect (added 10 minutes more baking time).  This recipe went over so well with my husband, mother-in-law, mom and guys from my husband's work.  VERY MUCH WORTH IT!

Awsome. --- the second time I made it I added extra blueberries, a few raspberries (less than 1/4 cup). 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. It turned out wonderfully. Very moist.

I followed others' advice and added more blueberries and made more crumbled topping as well. Turned out fabulous! I think it tasted better when the cake cools completely.

Excellent dessert, very light and high.  I added more blueberries (fresh, low bush).  A perfect dessert to bring to a pot luck.

This was very good, although if I make it again I will add more blueberries.

Very good snack cake - best when served slightly warm.  Used Splenda instead of sugar and sprinkled cinnamon on top.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes.  This cake has a very "scone-like" texture and is perfect - not too sweet.  We love it!  My girls beg me to make "BBB" as they call it.

This was pretty good.  Don't know if it's worth 5 stars w/out modification -- lemon zest with blueberries and cinnamon added to topping.  I've never made a "crust" with egg whites. 

Oh, when I started to make the crust, I accidentally switched salt with sugar!  Good thing I decided to taste it -- yikes!

Wow...This was a terrific recipe!  I didn't have any butter thawed, but I substituted butter flavored shortening and I also added another 3/4c. or so of blueberries.  My family loved this recipe and ate almost an entire 9x13 pan in one day!  Very easy recipe to follow and clean up is minimal.  My family and I thank you!

my goodness, what a delicate buttery treat! i'm also a member of the "my blueberries all sunk to the bottom" club. fresh blueberries were still overly expensive so i used frozen ones, drained & patted them dry. i guess fresh blueberries are more buoyant. thank you for this great recipe hannah!
i will make this recipe again. thanks

This wasn't what I was expecting, but it is SUPER!  Everyone in my house loves it!  Next time I will use a whole pint of blueberries instead of just 1 cup.  Outstanding recipe!

This is such a good 'coffee cake'.  I actually omit the blueberry's and either add extra topping, streusal topping, or just plain old frosting since my boyfriend is the 'fruity' type.  The cake is the best I've ever had - you gotta try it!

To those in "blueberries at the bottom" club: more than likely you're not beating the flour/milk/egg mixture long enough. If you use an electric mixer for 3 minutes like the recipe says the mixture will be thick enough the berries won't sink. If it isn't, keep mixing. This is soooo yummy, I could eat the whole pan.

Excellent!  I doubled the blueberries (and then some) because I had a huge bag in the freezer.  I also substituted buttermilk for milk and 1 tsp baking soda for 1 of the tsp of baking powder to account for the substitution.  So tasty that I'd eaten a good chunk of it before it was even cooled.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Was disappointed that when I took this out of the oven I could not see the topping or the blueberries. They had all sunk to the bottom. It was not very sweet which was nice and was very moist.

Wow!  This one's a keeper.  I used twice the amount of blueberries (I had a lot). Wonderful!  Not even a crumb left.

Recipes like this deserve SIX stars! I don't even like blueberries, and this was incredible! It disappeared in less than a day, and I've already had 2 more requests for it. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!
