Hadn't cooked kale before, and was looking for a way to make it that wouldn't be soundly rejected by the family (we've tried kale crisps and none of us like them very much). This was excellent! Made this recipe exactly as presented (which is why the 5 stars - I can't stand it when I see 5 star reviews, but only 'if' you do this, that, or the other thing). Absolutely no changes needed. I saw the reviews that said to cook longer, but I think that depends on how small you chop the kale, and of course remember to get rid of the stem, all the way up through the middle of the leaves, especially the big ones. If you do that, the 15 minutes of cook time (10 at simmer) should be plenty.

Great recipe had some fresh kale need to use this a tasty way. Kale was not as tender as I would have liked next time I will cook the kale longer. Used some of the left covers in an omelet for my son he loved it.

So so yummy!!  Used a little less butter and substituted olive oil, used half and half instead of heavy cream, added some fresh rosemary and Italian seasoning - then went wild and poured it over whole wheat elbow pasta!!  So good!  Definitely a keeper!!

This was absolutely excellent!!!!  True Italian way of eating kale and it made the house smell amazing!  Was looking for a different way to eat kale and this is it.  Will definitely make again.  I submitted a photo of how mine turned out too.  I did saute the kale longer as others suggested, instead of 5 minutes I did it about 8-9 minutes instead.  Love it!!!

My husband won't normally eat kale and he likes this recipe. My kids like kale and they LOVE this.   LOVE IT!  I cooked the kale a bit longer but we just prefer it soft. Otherwise we did not change a thing. Much better than creamed spinach. Thanks!

Great simple recipe!  I used baby kale so I didn't have to trim the stems off and it cooked perfectly!  I would recommend to all my friends.  I didn't use any salt and there was plenty of flavor.

I added about a quarter cup of sour cream since I didn’t have enough whipping cream. It added a bit of creaminess. Wonderful side dish with sautéed scallops.

This is an excellent recipe for kale. Quick and easy, plus it tastes great as is. Salt is an important factor in the flavor, so taste and season as you go. I made this for my bf who is very picky about green leafy veggies. He's actually eaten the same kale I used in the recipe before, but hated the taste of the kale. This time, he was smacking his lips and asking for more. I made this recipe exactly as is, except I eyeballed the measurements for the cream and cheese. You gotta try this, you will love it!
