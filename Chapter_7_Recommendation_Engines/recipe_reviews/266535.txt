These would have come out perfect had I remembered to add the sweetener to the custard. I added 1/2 of the sweetener (powdered swerve) to the toasted coconut and lime topping and... well... it made the topping super sweet and after mushing in my mouth with the custard and crust, it was perfect. Mine set up beautifully and was sweet and tart with a crispy crust... all compatible flavors - easily the best KETO desert I've made.

I loved the way this recipe turned out! Based on reviewers, I did reduce the lime juice to 3/4 cup, then followed the rest of the recipe as is. I did end up leaving them in the over quite a bit longer than specified (like 15-20 min more!) but they came out perfect then. I couldnâ€™t resist trying them when they were warm, and I was concerned that the crust totally fell apart and even seemed too wet, but once I put them in the fridge, the next morning the crust had firmed up and even had a nice little crunch. I kept them refrigerated for a week and they stayed fresh and  delicious! This is absolutely going in my favorites (keto or non!)

Incredibly tart. My husband loves tart, but this was too much.  We wound up sprinkling a bunch of regular powdered sugar on top to help balance it out. Once we did that, it was good.

Methinks the base needs more butter, or something to set it.   Totally crumbles when trying to bring out as a bar.
Also, possibly this recipe was written for key limes if they are sweeter than regular?    Definitely need to double the sweetener in the custard.
I will scoop mine out into a bowl, add some whipped cream to soften the bite, and doubt I will make it again.   Too much effort if it is not a winner.

Made this 4 times in the last month according to recipe and I enjoy it. The lime flavor is a little bit strong for me.

I made this yesterday and I ended up throwing the whole thing out. I doubled the Swerve in the recipe and it was still so sour that I couldn't eat it. It also didn't set up in either stage of cooking and ended up being like lime soup with a crust. Super disappointed.

Very good for a Keto dessert.  Mine had a touch of aftertaste because I used Stevia, but it was a great treat after going so long without desserts.  Thanks.

FYI:  I made the side crust pretty high, but the dish only ended up about a 1/2 inch high so no need for that.
