Great recipe!  I substituted bottled Honey Mustard dressing since I was unable to find the mix, but it just made the recipe quicker and easier to make! The raspberries did not hold up well in mixing and serving the salad (tended to break apart and "disappear"), so next time I'll just use a few extra blueberries and strawberries.
I used pre-packaged roasted chicken cuts, and so the recipe was speedy to prepare!

I really did like this recipe.  I could not find the mix, so I used the bottled dressing.  This was a good salad.  I almost didn't want to bring it to the picnic I made it for because I had started eating it & didn't want to share it!  I'm making it again next weekend for another function.  I'm sure it will be a hit.

Have prepared this for several group functions, and it is always a huge hit!  I also use the bottled honey mustard dressing because I am never able to find the mix.  But this just makes it easier!

My whole family loved this recipe.  Especially my husband!  I couldn't find the honey mustard salad dressing mix, so I used 1/2 cup of prepared bottled Honey mustard dressing instead.  I left out the pecans, and set the raspberries on the side so each person could "sprinkle" some on top of their salad.  I will be making this salad alot!

Fantastic! I actually made a glaze of the honey mustard dressing as well and used to baste the chicken during grilling!
My finicky husband loved it. I served it with wild rice and rosemary garlic bread.

This salad is awesome!  I made it for two social events and received compliments galore.

I was not able to find the salad dressing mix so I used Honey Mustard Salad dressing in the bottle and it was great.

The beauty of this recipe is that you CAN change things out. I had extra grilled chicken breasts that I had marinated in a combination of Italian and raspberry vinegrette dressings so adding strawberries, raspberries and dried cranberries was perfect. I also sprinkled feta cheese on top to balance the sweet flavors. Great recipe!

Very nice salad!  I made my own dressing using dijon mustard, a little honey, salt, pepper and some herbs with the cider vinegar and oj - used a bit less oil than what was called for.  I also did not have raspberries, so used about 3/4 cup each strawberries and blueberries, and had to sub walnuts for the pecans.  I  lightly blanched the sugar snap peas to make them extra sweet.  The only thing missing for me was a little chopped scallion to balance the sweetness of the fruit.  Great balance of flavors and a beautiful, colorful salad - one of my new favorites!

This is a delicious summer salad, and easy to modify.  I used fresh blueberries and dried cranberries, plus toasted pecans and mixed lettuce greens from the garden.  I had a bottle of lite honey dijon dressing on hand, so I mixed that with juice from half an orange, then added a little gourmet mustard to 'kick it up' as a certain TV chef would say.  2 chicken breasts were rubbed with additional mustard and done on the George Foreman grill, bringing the whole salad together in about 15-20 minutes, topped with a little freshly grated Romano.  The nice thing is, you can make it a heartier main course by adding more nuts and chicken, or a lighter salad course by cutting down the chicken:greens ratio.  Would be great with slightly wilted spinach!

This recipe is great. I toasted the pecans by putting 1/4 cup melted butter over 3 cups peacans.  I added a little brown sugar...maybe 1 tablespoon.  What really kicked the pecans was pouring maple syrup over them while cooking - baked the pecans in my little oven @ 350 for about 40 minutes.  yummm!!!  

I didn't have fresh peas or raspberries, so I used frozen and just let them sit for a while to defrost.

Fabulous!  If, like my husband, you don't like tomatoes, cucumbers, or other traditional salad veggies, this is a great way to get all those yummy nutrients in a fresh summery way.  I used light-done-right honey dijon dressing, left out the sugar snap peas, and subbed blackberries for raspberries.

Great as the main course for a summer meal.  I used blackberries and strawberries, and subsituted a lemon ginger dressing (Trader Joe's), which I also used as marinade.  I ground up half of the pecans, added flour, in which I dipped the chicken and cooked on the stove since I don't have a grill.  Thanks!

I had made this salad and didn't throw on the dressing (from the bottle), allowing everyone to put on at their discretion.  But most people didn't bother, and loved it without any dressing!

This was great. I could not find the honey mustard mix so I used a poppyseed dressing from one of the strawberry spinach salad recipes. I would love to try with the honey mustard though.  The toasted pecans were great!

Was not able to find "honey mustard mix" at the store, so substituted a sweet/sour poppyseed, which was excellent.  Easy to prepare, , my non salading loving kids enjoyed it too!

This was a really nice combination of flavors.  I also could not find powdered honey mustard dressing mix, so I used a bottle, which was fine.  It was too cold to grill outside, so I baked my chicken and shredded it.

This recipe was fantastic!!  I could eat it forever!  I'm doing WW, so I'm looking for really good salads. . .I have subbed ham for the chicken before.  I also just made the dressing from a low fat version from the Taste of Home site: "Honey Mustard Salad Dressing".  Having the berries in there was great way to add flavor and not calories.  Thank you!!

I really enjoyed this salad, but the rest of the family didn't.  My hubby said "my head think's it's strange that there's fruit in my salad". Huh?!?!?! The kids weren't very keen on it either...they just liked the strawberries.  But, I think it's a great summer salad, it had a nice flavor and it was light.  I too, couldn't find the honey mustard packet, so I just used bottled.  I prob won't make this again for the family, but I would if it were my gfriends coming over for lunch.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum, this is a wonderful summertime meal.  The dressing adds the right tangyness to compliment the sweet of the berries. This is a keeper.

Very delicious. I couldn't find dry honey mustard mix, so I used a bottled honey mustard and it was still yummy!

Good recipe.  I used Paul Newman's "light" Honey Mustard.  Remember that the proceeds from this brand go to PN's Hole in the Wall Charity for children w/cancer.

I'm going to rate this five stars, because my boyfriend LOVED it.  I guess I am just not a salad-for-dinner person.  It was good, just not as a meal for me.

My husband isnt always happy when I make salad for dinner. He LOVED this salad. We really enjoyed the berries in it. He even commented on how good it was the next day after eating it.

I left out the snow peas and raspberries and I used Texa Pete's Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce because I couldn't find dry mix anywhere. It was delicious!

All I can say is that this is the first time my family has scrapped a salad bowl clean and asked for more!
