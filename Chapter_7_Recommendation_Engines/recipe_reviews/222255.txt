You MUST make these!!  They are awesome and will impress everyone.  My picky in-laws (but I don't like goat cheese..) loved them, my 13 year-old son (mom, when can we have those grilled vegetables again?...).  Very easy to substitute depending on what veggies you have on hand.  Have made this 5 times, here are my suggestions: slice the onion THICK or they will get lost.  add zucchini (quartered lengthwise) and/or asparagus, eggplant is good also.  MOST IMPORTANT:  PUT SOME BALSAMIC IN YOUR MARINADE, THEN ADD GOOD/HIGH QUALITY BALSAMIC TO SOME OF THE REMAINING MARINADE TO DRIZZLE ON THE GRILLED VEGGIES.  The avacado is optional but the goat cheese and FRESH basil are a must.  Addistional suggestion:  on the chance that you have leftover veggies, cut them up and add to sauteed onion and garlic, throw in a can of diced tomatoes and some grilled, sliced chicken sausage.  Simmer to desired consistancy and serve over pasta with additional cheese.  I now make extra veggies every time, just so we can have the pasta.  Did I mention I like this receipe :)

Absolutely amazing! Like another said, I'm dreaming of the next time I have this! I made the recipe exactly as above except I mistakenly added the balsamic vinegar while marinating instead of after grilling - but it was so good I don't think I'd try it the original way. 
We used the suggested ingredients, plus zucchini (quartered lengthwise), yellow bell pepper, and eggplant sliced into 1/2" rounds, all good. The red onion is a must, it is a wonderful flavor complement to the other veggies. My suggestion, make a lot, especially if you're feeding more than 3 or 4 people - it'll be a hit.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could! This is BY FAR the best recipe for grilled veggies I have ever tried! Hubby agrees too! I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I used more cayenne (probably around 1/4 tsp - even that wasn't spicy). For the grill seasoning I used Montreal Steak Spice and used slightly less than called for. I'm already dreaming of the next time I can have this! I wouldn't change a thing! I love the sweetness of the peppers combined with the freshness from the basil and creamy goat cheese and avocado. This is the kind of recipe that will thoroughly impress guests.

I made this dish, and frankly, I believe it to be the best vegetable dish I have ever had....my wife thought so as well.  
I used 6 cloves of garlic...and more basil, After grilling, I put it in the oven on 300 for 5 minutes, just to make sure it was hot.  Paired it with a Grilled Flank Steak.....Bon Appetite....

We grill veggies a lot, but last night I wanted something different and a little more special--I was not disappointed with this recipe. I used 3 mushroom caps halved, two red bell peppers quartered about 3/4 of a medium red onion,  8 or so asparagus stalks and a large avocado. Just about perfect for 4 large helpings. I may have not used the full amount of goat's cheese, but rather sprinkled it over the platter of vegetables until I was satisfied with the presentation. Also, we grilled the veggies for about 15 minutes on the top shelf of the grill--they would have been underdone at 5 min.

This is an incredible recipe!  I used zucchini, yellow squash, green & red pepers, red onion and asparagus.  As some had suggested .. I used fresh basil and included the balsamic vinegar in the marinade.  Sooo yummy!

This was fabulous! Made it exactly as posted and wouldn't make it any other way.  We had leftovers that we refrigerated and my husband put on a salad the next day.  He said it tasted even better!  The fourth time we made it (yes, it's that good! I only found the recipe a month ago and we've had it 4 times already!), my step son had the leftovers in an omelet and he said it was delicious! Thank you for such an excellent recipe.

I usually only try recipes that have been rated, but I was looking for a grilled veggie recipe that was a little different, and this fit the bill.  Despite burning a few of the veggies, it turned out wonderfully and was even better for leftovers the next day.  Here are my changes:  I used a bag of sweet mixed (orange, yellow and red) peppers instead of bell, mostly because it was cheaper and I wanted more color.  I only used 3 mushroom caps which I quartered.  I used McCormick montreal steak seasoning for the grill seasoning because it was what I had on hand.  I eyed the balsalmic vinegar and probably added a little extra bc I love balsalmic, but probably added too much as it got a little too tart the longer it sat- so I'd say use as directed, if not less.  I also added asparagus as I needed to get rid of some and I skewered the vegetables for the grill.  Everything else was the same.  Will definitely make again!

A great side dish for grilled meats. We served it with grilled shrimp and it paired nicely. We didn't have a ripe avacado, so we left it out and we used feta instead of goat cheese. Delicious!

This was fabulous.  I made it for a cookout and everyone raved about it.  I used sweet onion and feta, since that's what I had.  Will be making this often over the grilling season.

This was so, so good!  I grilled the vegies for about 10 minutes because I wanted them a bit more done.  I only put a little bit of the remaining marinade on after they were grilled because I didn't want to mask the great natural taste of the vegies.  The onion and red pepper were slightly charred... just enough to bring out their natural sweetness.  The goat cheese was a perfect blend with the vegies.  I didn't have any avocado, but I will definitely add that next time.  I think that this, with some nice grilled garlic bread, would be a filling meal.  Thanks for posting it.

Absolutely loved these veggies. My husband is not a huge veggie lover, but even he had seconds. He refuses to eat asparagus, so I left it out, but otherwise a hit

Served this tonight and everyone simply LOVED IT. I substituted zucchini for the mushrooms since my kids won't eat mushrooms. My husband liked it so much he insists we serve it at our July 4th barbeque. The only note I would make is that I wouldn't call it smoky vegetables; there was no smoke flavor.

I am just learning to cook and have been trying to branch out and try new things.  I made this dish last night.  I used mixed bell peppers, onion, tomato and zucchini.  I added the goat cheese and avocado at the end.  It was very good, but definitely didn't look like the photo.  The avocado and goat cheese formed a green goo over the veggies.  I guess looks aren't everything because it was a delicious side dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Can you say party in my mouth?? Wonderful flavors that I thought were weird at first, but man did I love this. I thought the avacado didnt really fit into the mix, but I tried it anyway. I wont be adding it the next time, but surely will make this again. FYI I normally dont make any recipes that dont have at least 300+ reviews, but the picture captured me :)

This was very good. I'm vegan so I didn't include cheese . Used only one  red pepper and extra mushrooms.    I also added some asparagus, crumbled extra firm tofu, squash and extra cayenne.    Since I added so much, I doubled the dressing.   I would suggest keeping the  avocado separate so the vegetables keep  longer and can be reheated.

As soon as I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it. Love veggies, love grilling, love goat cheese, love avocado. I made this a few nights ago, and It. Was. Awesome!  Following reviewers' advice, I put about a tablespoon of the balsamic into the marinade.  I let it all sit for about 90 minutes, and I ended up grilling everything for about 10 min.  As another reviewer suggested, I then put the veggies into a 300-degree oven while I was finishing the main course.

Another reviewer described making extras and stirring them into a pasta meal with sauteed onions and garlic and chicken sausage.  I did exactly what she described and served with more goat cheese crumbles. (Parmesan would have been good, too, but I didn't have any.)  Again, fabulous. We have just enough veggies and sausage left to stir into scrambled eggs or omelettes this weekend!

I've made a lot of great recipes off this site, but this may be my favorite. It's pretty much foolproof, it's versatile, and it's delicious.  And I'm no great chef or anything.

I put these on the BBQ in a vegetable basket and they were truly smoky! I left them on longer than 5 minutes until tender and periodically stirred them.  Instead of the red pepper I used a green one and added asparagus, zucchini, and summer squash.

Such a versatile recipe! I used green, red and yellow bell peppers, sliced zucchini, sliced baby bella mushrooms, asparagus, red onion, and quartered roma tomatoes. I marinated everything in a large ziploc bag instead of a dish. That way I could easily mix it and flip it periodically. I skipped the avocado, and sprinkled a few little gobs of goat cheese at the end. I totally forgot using the basil, but will try next time even though it wasn't needing it. This is a keeper recipe for roasting or grilling veggies that I will use over and over. Thanks so much for sharing it. :-)

Because we opted to go vegetarian today, I had to convince my kids that the Portobello's were as good as steak and chicken (that's how I feel, anyway). Next time I will cube everything and skewer. We served these over hot soba noodles dressed with some extra basil and a quick toss into the marinade bowl. Delicioso!

I LOVE this! Especially the mushrooms and onions! I didn't have balsamic vinegar but I used a balsamic vinegar glaze and it worked wonderfully! I could eat this as a main course!

This was excellent - the only I thing I did different was to roast the vegetables in the oven rather than the grill.  It was a big hit!

I took others suggestions and also added asparagus and also sliced zucchini.  I also add the balsamic vinegar to the entire marinade instead of whisking it and adding it after grilling.  Every time I serve  this everyone loves it!  It is a summertime hit.

This was awesome!  Made as is except I used 2 red, 1 yellow & 1 orange pepper and white mushrooms instead of portobello, and feta instead of goat cheese, because these were what I had. Subs were irrelevant. Very attractive dish visually. Guests & family loved it and I can't wait to make again.

SO, so good! ANY vege will work with this recipe for grilling. We used a mix of bell peppers, red onion,  poblano, asparagus and mushrooms. The second shot of marinade is the key! It gives it lots more flavor. Subbed Feta for Goat cheese and it was amazing. Didn't have avocado but I'm sure that would have made it super amazing.

The best veggies! I too accidentally added the BV to the marinade and don’t regret it. Was too cold to grill so did these in the oven to perfection. The add ins of fresh basil and avocado really made it. And goat cheese. That’s the reason I chose this recipe!

FABULOUS!!!!! Will make it again and again! My whole family gobbled it up! I followed the recipe but also added zucchini. The goat cheese and avocado, along with the smokiness of the grilled veggies,  made it phenomenal!

I’ve made this dozens of times over the past few years - some times with all of the ingredients and some times not. I generally leave out the avacado and goat cheese because I rarely have them in the house. I especially like this marinade with portobello mushrooms.  When my wife is gone I kick up the cayenne to spice it up a bit. Delish!

This is one of my favourite veggie recipes. I love the addition of the grilling spice. It is quick and easy to put together. Always a favourite with my family and you can switch up the veg to whatever you have on hand.

I made it few times when we were hosting friends and everyone like it. I omitted grill seasoning (too salty for me) and added brussel sprouts just because I wanted my husband to start eating them. He did, and now it became a fixed ingredient in that dish. Eventually more veggies made it's way to this dish... i.e when I had some left over zucchini and didn't want to waste it, a potato after I peeled too many and decided to slice the excess to add to this dish.  I also mix the peppers, some red, some yellow or orange and green ones too. I did that for more colorful look of the dish, and because we like them all. You can use frozen peppers if you don't have fresh ones. We love this recipe, and the offshoot I created. If you decide to go with the extras, grill/bake potatoes and brussel sprouts for 10 minutes before adding other ingredients. They take longer to get soft.  This recipe +  steak + bottle of good vine is an official start of dining outside season. Thank you for sharing!!

I made this for a bbq and it was delicious. I am not a fan of mushrooms so I substituted zucchini.  The goat cheese melts and it forms this creamy flavorful sauce on the veggies.

Everyone LOVED these.  I made my own grill seasoning as I couldn't find it at the store, just google grill seasoning and get the recipe easy to make and a lot cheaper.

This is soooo good!  The marinade is flavorful, and the cheese and avocado add a nice creaminess ... don't leave those out.  I marinated for about 90 minutes and grilled for about 10 minutes, and served it with grilled chicken breasts.  Next time, I'll try adding some additional vegetables to the mix.  I think feta or bleu cheese would also be nice in place of the goat cheese.

A little salty for us, but very good otherwise.  Like others, I grilled my vegetables for longer than stated -- about 20 minutes.  The goat cheese just melts on the warm vegetables coming off the grill and tastes so good.  I love avocado, but warm avocado doesn't do much for me.  I put it on the side so others would have the option to add it to their vegetables.  I can't wait to make it again.  I'll definitely decrease the grill seasoning next time.  (I used Montreal Steak Seasoning.) Thanks for a great recipe!

What a great idea to add avocado and cheese after grilling! This was delicious and very modifiable. I didn't have grilling spice so I used "Cajun spice" plus pepper and liquid smoke and it was still great.

A neighbor made this amazing dish!  I couldn't get enough of it, so he kindly sent me home with a container of leftovers!  Better than a Christmas present!  This could easily be a main course for those who don't consume much meat or poultry.  Just simply delicious!

I broiled instead of grilling outside (it was raining), and I did add some additional veggies - brussel sprouts, asparagus, etc. Turned out great and was a big hit. The avocado and goat cheese really took it to the next level. Will definitely make again!

Added lime zest and the balsamic vinegar at the beginning, used only 1 tablespoon of EVOO, then marinated veggies and cut up chicken (in separate ziplock bags) for 6 hrs. Made my own all purpose seasoning as I didn't have grill seasoning. Followed rest of recipe. Grilled like kabobs for 10 mins, it was delicious.

A family favourite - I make it with whatever vegetables I have on hand. - especially good with brussel sprouts. Equally good when done in the oven.

This was amazing. I changed it only because I didn't have some ingredients. I basically used the vegetables I had on hand: squash, zucchini, half a red pepper, half a green pepper, two red potatoes, broccoli. I mixed up some all purpose seasoning mix. I then followed the recipe and afterwards added chopped avocado, tomato, and goat cheese. Yum! It tasted amazing the second day as well. I will make this again.

Will make again! Loved it as is, made about half the recipe cuz that's all the veggies I had, wish I had made more! Excluded the avocado because I didn't have any on hand, but just fine without

Delicious! The mixture of the marinade with balsamic vinegar, and goat cheese is perfect. Since I was making this as a main dish I borrowed another reviewer's suggestion and added canned tomatoes, pasta, and sausage to rhis dish (simmered tomatoes with sliced chicken sausage for about 20 minutes).  I left out the avocado because of the pasta but didn't change anything else.

This is the best grilled veggie recipe I have tasted - just love it!  The original recipe is great on its own - we made some tweaks for our own tastes.  We added asparagus and cut the grill seasoning to 1 TB, added alot more garlic (we love garlic), and like some other reviewers noted, we added the balsamic to the marinade up front.   We also grilled the veggies longer to get a bit of a scorch on them - again, our own personal preference and taste.  I will definitely be trying this with different veggies - thank you Carol for such a great grill recipe!  And thanks to other reviewers for your helpful hints.

These are pretty good (I used Montreal Steak seasoning from McCormick). But I never have time to put on extras after things come off the grill, I'm too busy socializing! So I had the avocado and goat cheese ready, but by the time I realized the veggies were done, they were half gone. Guests loved them, but when I tried them I though they needed more salt and I just wondered how they'd taste with the extras. So the recipe was good, but I probably won't use it again for a BBQ because of the extra work after the grill.

Just didn't care for it. I ended up blending it all, added Italian sausage, a can of tomatoes, sun dried tomatoes, and herbs. Put it on rigatoni.
