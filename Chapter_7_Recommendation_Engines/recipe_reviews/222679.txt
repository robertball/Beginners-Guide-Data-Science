Really delicious! I chopped everything up and mixed it all together, b/c my pieces of pork/beef were a little small, and I wanted a nice distribution of flavors. I also added to the mix some onion that I cooked in evoo, until tender, and that added a nice extra flavor. We make braciole a lot, but I've never had it w/ the salami...LOVED IT! I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'll be honest, the recipe itself sounds delicious but when I made it I wasn't impressed. (sorry)  I didn't like the boiled egg in it and to me it was pretty much flavorless.

Very tasty and very easy.  I changed a few things however.  I used chicken and made a home made rose sauce (personal preference) and added fresh basil to the filling.  Also i only cooked in the sauce about 20 minutes.  The rolls were very flavorful and looked very impressive when sliced.

This is exactly how my grand mother from Italy makes it.  It is fabulous.  The only change is that I make my own sauce  rather than a jar sauce.

This recipe requires a bit more skill than this cook has. The flattening of the cutlets and subsequent rolling with the filling are difficult.  Flavor was mediocre and I used very good ingredients. Perhaps the result of a floundering chef (me) but I wouldn't make this again.

Delicious. The Basil is a must. I Spread some basil paste on it and some onion powder. Pain to make, tough to roll.  Next time I will leave out the pork or make sure it's the outer later, because I ended up cooking meat too much to ensure the pork was done. Ideally would be even better with a medium, slightly pink, juicy meat.
