I have made this for co-workers and for the future inlawsâ€¦everyone loved it. I always get requests for it. One thing though--add the salt before boiling and make sure the vanilla is the last thing you add before putting in pan, otherwise you will ruin the fudge-trust me, I have done it. p.s. add some extra raisinettes--use the 12 oz bag-it makes the fudge creamier!!

The best fudge ever, everyone at Christmas thought it tasted like a chunky bar, I bet it really would if you added nuts! Thanks!

This was the best fudge I have ever tasted. It was so easy to make and everyone was so impressed. A+ in my book.

This was the most horrible fudge I have ever made. It was dry not creamy. Just horrible. Will not make again. Wasted the money on all the ingredients. Will stick to my other recipe.

Sadly, I need to agree with HAMPS. Lovely combination of raisins and nuts. Good taste and VERY dry, crumbly fudge. (I even added more chocolate covered raisins at another reader's suggestion.) LOVED Aunt Teen's Fudge (recipe on this site) and will add raisins to that.
