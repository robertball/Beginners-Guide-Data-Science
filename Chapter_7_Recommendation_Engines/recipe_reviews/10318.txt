I've made many a krumkake and this one is a favorite. I added 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg ... tasty! My mom's recipe, which contains butter, although delicious, are more fragile and a bit more difficult to transport for holiday gatherings. Try this version. You won't be disappointed.

This is the first time I have made krumkake (I thought it was too hard)  But I decided to try and absolutely love this recipe.  Easy dough and tastes like what I remember from my childhood.

This is the recipe you are looking for-- simple, basic-- Krumkake!

I found I got twice as many servings as the recipe suggests by using 1 tablespoon of batter per krumkake
