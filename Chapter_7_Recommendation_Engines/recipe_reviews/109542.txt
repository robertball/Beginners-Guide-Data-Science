Awesome with changes.  I use either a premade crust or homemade and precook for a few minutes with a little cheese.  I mix the entire can of beans with salsa - enough to make it easy to spread (we use HOT salsa so the pizza is hot).  I spread the beans on the all ready hot crust and top the beans with LOTS of sharp cheddar cheese.  I cook it in the oven until the cheese is melted and browned.  That's it!  I top slices with lettuce, onion, salsa, sour cream, black olives, etc.  It's the best taco pizza ever.

I actually used two canisters of reduced fat crescent roll dough that I baked, then cooled. I spread the refried beans first which I did add a little homemade taco seasoning, then homemade salsa and just topped with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and olives and the green onions, then the cheese. I then drizzled homemade ranch-mexican dressing over the top. I did not use the tortilla chips only because I don't keep them on hand. Really quick supper and quite enjoyed by my boys. This is great for a last minute dinner on a busy day.

Great, simple recipe. I actually used the pre-made pizza crust which made it even easier!

I made it for a get together and everyone couldn't stop talking about it and wanted the recipe! I'm sure you could add ground beef if you wanted, or seasoned chicken, but I loved it the way it was

I used a boxed crust mix and sprinkled taco seasoning on the dough before baking. We love this recipe!

DELICIOUS! I'm a poor college student, with not much time to cook--this was the perfect pizza, I loved the mixture of toppings (especially the beans) however I bought a pizza crust that was already cooked, in order to make it easier. highly recommended

I made the recipe almost exactly but I did add season taco hamburger.  easy and delicious.  I'll make it again. I also use a think crust so next time I will be sure and not bake for the full initial 10 minutes.

Nice change from regular tacos, I added ground beef to the pizza because we wouldn't eat a taco without meat.  It was good.  Just watch the pizza crust; even if it's not brown on top, it could be burning on the bottom.

This was great. I added some ground beef with taco seasoning to the pizza. I was able to make two pizzas by using the whole can of refried beans. Will def make again!

Maybe next time I'll spread out the ranch over the top of the pizza, or substitute the ranch dressing for sour cream
