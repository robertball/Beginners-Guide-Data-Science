Thanks for a great gluten free recipe! I'm having a brunch for someone who is allergic to gluten and hates eggs. Crepes is a perfect option. I made a practice batch today and they were so easy to make!  I am going to serve them with an apple filling. I did add a little bit of sugar and vanilla as suggested but they probably won't need it with the sweet filling. This recipe is a keeper.
