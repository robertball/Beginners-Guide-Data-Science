Made this with leftover thanksgiving turkey and we loved it! I followed the recipe to a T except left out the Ps (cause I hate 'em).

This was a wonderful recipe and I used frozen turkey from Thanksgiving.  The only change I made was to add a few ounces of leftover cream cheese to the sauce,  I will make this recipe again and of course it makes a large amount so we plan to enjoy it again  tomorrow night!

My hubby is 88 and has trouble eating many foods.  This worked out great.   Cutting the turkey into small bits and using the new inch long thin spaghetti were the only changes I made.  He loved the cheese and crumb crunchy crust.  I will make this  again.

This dish was very rich for our tastes. Too much butter and Parmesan cheese! If I was to make this again I would use olive oil to sauté the veggies and less butter to mix with the bread crumbs. I would use maybe 1 tablespoon of Parmesan cheese in the crumb mixture if any at all. I would also use milk instead of half and half.

Tastes really good.  I felt it was a little dry and would increase the liquid next time.  Also, the recipe calls for 1 package of spaghetti but says 8 ounces.  My regular sized package is 16 ounces but I followed the 8 ounce ingredient and ended up having to make more because it wasn't enough to make 2 layers.  It was still delicious though.

The only changes I made were and extra half cup of chicken broth, about 1/3 block of creamed cheese and a handful of Parmesan and cheddar both to the sauce. Reduced the flour to 4 tblsp and used linguini. 3 cups turkey was a little much I thought. Be forewarned, the prep time is long on this dish, but you could always make the sauce in advance or even freeze a batch for another meal with chicken, etc;

I’ve always wanted to make this dish. My granny made it when I was a young girl...and she let me ‘help’ her!  But, I’ve never tried making it on my own until now. This recipe was easy to follow, and super fun to create!  Yummy!

This was so good!  My only changes were to substitute fresh broccoli for the peas because that's what I had on hand and I added an extra 1/2 cup of broth since some of the reviews said it was a bit dry.  It came out perfect. Definitely will make again.

This is delicious.  The only change I made was to add frozen spinach instead of peas because its what I had on hand and a 1/2 t. of salt.  Because I added about a 1/4 cup of parm. to the sauce.  I will definitely make again.  Thank you.

Loved this!  Great use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  Only change added a diced red pepper for some extra color.  Also, added a handful of Parmesan to the sauce.  Definitely will make again.

Awesome dish.  Followed the recipe almost exactly except poured in a little more chicken broth to keep the consistency of the sauce a little less thick.

Great way to use up turkey leftovers. We added extra chicken broth based on the reviews.  Also we did not have poultry seasoning on hand so we used Chesapeake Bay Seasoning instead and it added a nice kick to the meal.

It was delicious.  I used Black Bean and Sesame Linguine and Lowfat Condensed Milk in place of the Half and Half.  Lowers the calories a bit and adds texture.

This is the third time i have used this recipe to make this.  The first time it was absolutely delicious.  The second time, I used a different noodle and it was sticky and gummy.  Today I made it  and felt it was too dry.   I think I will add some more broth tomorrow and let it "soak" in before  dinner.

Followed this recipe to a T. And it was bland. Needed more Parmesan cheese, garlic, and more veggies. Maybe another cheese to go w the Parmesan. I will try this again but w modifications.

The family loved it! Doubled the recipe; I had shiitake mushrooms, celery& Asparagus on hand so I used that instead of peas. I also didn’t have enough parmesan so had to use cheddar too. It was so good!

This was really good and we enjoyed it greatly.  If I'd make it again, I'd reduce the butter a bit, as the finished product was pretty rich.  However, after eating a good serving of this, I wasn't hungry again for another day!  Will make again.

This was my 1st attempt at Tetrazzini and I was surprised by how well it turned out (no disrespect to the person that submitted the recipe, it's that my cooking skills can vary, ha). I used an entire pkg of fresh sliced mushrooms and a whole sweet onion. I also omitted the peas simply because I was out. You'd never know my Thanksgiving turkey was somewhat dry! This was so good I will probably try it with rotisserie chicken. Yum!

This was so delicious. I omitted the mushroom since I dislike them and added extra onion and garlic for flavor. My boyfriend and I thought it was the best tetrazzini we’ve ever had. I used chicken but will definitely use my leftover turkey after thanksgiving!

This was very good.  I did saute celery with the onions and mushroom to give a litte crunchy texture. I also did not have any half & half so I used a subsitution of butter & milk. It was perfect!

I used ground turkey which I fried up in the frying pan. It is a good casserole to take out to an event. Check the salt in the bread crumbs. I didn't use Panko which I should have. A very big difference in salt amount. I will use Panko from now on.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added a can of cream of chicken soup and a few more spices! I also used no yolk egg noodles. My husband loved it.

I made this dish for my neighbor and he loved it!!  I followed the recipe with the following exception: I added 1/2 cup of whole milk because it looked on the dry side before I put it in the oven and I figured the spaghetti would soak up more moisture.  Came out perfect. Thanks for the recipe!!! The next time I will use a whole box (16 oz) of spaghetti so there is enough pasta.

Left out the peas, otherwise made as directed.  Husband loved it, even ate the leftovers (he doesn't usually care for leftovers) and asked for it again tonight but none left.  Will make it again soon.

Made this recipe exactly as written and probably won't make it again. It was just ok, a little bit dry, and not all that tasty. Not a big winner in my house.

Excellent tetrazzini.   I did omit the mushrooms because of family preferences, but the recipe is fantastic without it.   I would make again.

Excellent!  A great way to use up turkey leftovers. I used a cup of frozen veggies (corn, carrots, peas and lima beans combo), but otherwise followed the recipe as is.

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out delicious. I actually packaged some of it to freeze for meals later on. It was just as good because I thawed out and then added the buttered bread crumbs before baking.

This was a classic turkey tetrazzini recipe. Just enough creaminess and seasonings were just right. I didn’t layer the noodles sauce because of not reading the instructions. I’ll be making this again!

Surprised by how good this was.  Great use for leftover turkey or rotisserie chicken. I will likely make this again. Oh, and also left out peas cuz didn't have any and don't really care for them either.

Delicious. My husband gave it 5  stars. I made a few adjustemnets. Threw garlic in with the onion in my chopper, used organic unsalted chicken broth, organic frozen peas, unsalted organic butter, Chantrelle musrooms, organic halfnhalf, cut salt to1 /4 t., fresh parmesan, organic leftover smoked turkey. and whole wheat flour.

Prep time, and I'm fast, was 60 minutes. Used two cups turkey and it was plenty! Used only 4 T. of the flour, could have used only 3 T.  Used my own chicken broth. Made my own poultry seasoning too. My husband ate three helpings.

My family and I all loved this recipe, and will definitely make this again in the future! The only change I made to it was adding softened Cream Cheese (1 small brick) to the sauce. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

The entire family loved this meal. It was delicious! Didn't add peas, we had asparagus instead. I used stock made from the turkey carcass and it added a lot. I was making this dinner at my daughter -in-laws and sons house and I mistakenly used masa instead of flour ( that I couldn't find- lol) it still turned out great. NONE LEFT! Everyone had seconds and thirds!!

Thumbs up all the way around. Used baked turkey breast and broth. Instead of spaghetti, I used wide egg noodles. Next time I will delay cooking the noodles, as they sat longer than I would like. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it almost  like the recipe, but used gluten-free pasta and a Swiss-Gruyere cheese instead of Parmesan. It was a corn variety pasta and my dinner company raved! Only had a small amount left over.

Made this for my family this past week with left over grilled chicken and it was an instant hit!   There were no left overs after this meal and who needs to wait for the holidays to make it!
