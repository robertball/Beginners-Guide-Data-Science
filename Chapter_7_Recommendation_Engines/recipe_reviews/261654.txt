Very good and filling. If you think there is such a thing as too much chocolate (especially at breakfast) consider cutting the chocolate chips by thirty to 50%.

This was a great recipe. I have been looking for a great baked oatmeal for so long. I did make one change, though. I did not use as many chocolate chips. After mixing all of the other ingredients together, I just added as many mini chocolate chips as I wanted (about a half cup), stirred them together and dumped the mix into my baking dish. It turned out great. Next time I make it, and I will make it again, I am going to add blueberries. I shall let you know the results!
