I enjoyed this dressing.  I didn't have chipotle peppers, so I added a dash of Tobasco and left out capers per personal preference.  I halved the recipe and it made enough for 3-4 large salads.  I served it over romaine hearts, croutons, fresh shaved park, and anchovies; good stuff!  THANKS for the recipe!
