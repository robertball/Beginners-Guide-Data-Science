When I read the ingredients, I wasn't about to even taste this salad. But when I did, wow!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  I added a little more sugar and cinnamon to it but other than that.  It was awsome.

I made this to go with Christmas dinner.  It was wonderful.  What I really liked is that I could still eat the left overs two days later and it was not soggy at all.  I will definately make this again.

This recipe has become a Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition at our house.  The first time I made it, I used a food processor on the fresh cranberries and there was a lot of tart juice, which I didn't really like.  Now I freeze the berries first, then cut them into quarters.  It takes a lot longer, but it tastes sweeter, I think, because the juice isn't mixed into the yogurt.  Fabulous recipe!

Good salad for adults.  The fresh cranberries make the salad quite tart.  I tripled the sugar and it countered the tartness.  Overall hit with family during Thanksgiving.

This is a wonderful salad, but I thought the cranberry apple ratio should have been more apple, less cranberries. Also, I believe red grapes would add more flavor. This could also be used as a dessert!

This recipe was great.  Very quick and a healthy sweet treat.  I didn't have the green grapes and it still turned out delicious!  I know I'll be making it more.  Thanks Thea!

I made this tonight and it was absolutely wonderful with great texture and flavors. The cinammon makes it especially great. I didn't change a thing. My husband loved it too and we both had two huge helpings! It was also quick and easy to prepare. Thanks for a great recipe Thea!

This is a recipe that does well, however, none of the children would eat it. It also took more time than I was prepared to spend. (I chop by hand). My mother, who is a great cranberry fan, did ask for the recipe.

Several years ago, I was a health-conscious teen and budding cook when I discovered this recipe. To humor me, my mother let me make it for Christmas dinner. It was a surprise hit - everybody adored it! Just as the description predicts this will become a tradition, we've made it for Christmas every year since.  It definitely is a sweeter dish. We serve it with dinner, but we might save it for last on our plates as a sort of dessert. Also, we double the walnuts and cinnamon - I'm not sure why, but that's what we penciled over the recipe at some point.  One last note: a standard bag of cranberries is 3 cups, so we double the recipe (although it makes a lot that way).

I am not a cook and decided to cook New Year's Day Dinner for 9 people!!  I found this recipe and followed the directions to a "T" except I used red grapes instead of green.  It was a HUGE hit!  Thank you so much!  I can't wait to make it again!

This was really really good. I used dried cranberries (vs fresh), Braeburn apples and chopped pecans (vs walnuts). Refreshing and healthy!

This was perfect just exactly what I was looking for!  Quick for a fruit type salad, easy and Very good!!  Thank you Thea for sharing your wonderful festive salad with us.  it was a Huge hit! there was very little left.  we were going to a party with 10 guests, so I doubled the recipe, I didn't have enough yogurt (I bought cheap yogurt worked great) hubs is diabetic so I cut the sugar back to 2 teaspoons that coupled with the sugary yogurt was enough.  I cut the cranberries back just a little as per our tastes.  But this salad was such a hit everyone was saving it for last to eat as if saving the best for last!  Wonderful recipe and will be having this one again! and again!

I have served this for the last 3 years with my Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. It's a nice change from the canned fruit cocktail/marshmallow/sourcream salad I grew up with. It is a little on the sweet side with the added sugar and vanilla yogurt but I think it's a perfect blend of sweet and tart.

Wonderful! I took the recipe's advice and used a food processor on the cranberries. I also took a reviewer's advice and increased the sugar by about another 1/2 tablespoon but probably didn't need to. Everyone loved this! Cruncy and a refreshing change from the usual holiday dishes. This is so delicious I won't wait for another holiday to make it.  Thanks Thea, for a great recipe.

This recipe is great just the way it is!  The trick is to make sure you chill it for 2 hours.  The flavor really comes together then.  I was asked by quite a few for the recipe.

The chopping took some time but it was well worth it-my family loved it! We're not celery lovers so I used only half the celery and increased the walnuts by a third... 

It was great as a salad for Christmas dinner but would also be good as a light lunch salad or even a dessert!

Excellent.  The cranberries add a little zip to the waldorf salad.  And it also has a nice color.  I didn't add any sugar to mine though.  The other fruit and vanilla yogurt (I just used two single serving containers of low fat) made it sweet enough.

This was a hit last year at my Thanksgiving table.  A real departure from the usual.  I'll certainly make it again!

Delicious, different Waldorf salad - we loved it.  This recipe was highly recommended at holiday time, but I didn't get around to making it.  Using cranberries that I had froze, I threw them in the food processor and proceeded with the recipe.  The one thing I did differently is to add the nuts to individual servings, as DS doesn't like nuts in his food.  We really liked the yogurt dressing as opposed to the usual mayonnaise dressing.  A nice, refreshing salad with a bit of tartness from the cranberries.  A winner in our house.

Awesome recipe.   Really good alternative to your traditional cranberry recipe.  Nice mix of sweet and tart.  Only downfall is after it sits for a bit it doesnt look all that appealing.  But, one bite and you don't care.

The only change I made was to omit the grapes. I made this for Thanksgiving last year for BF as a trail, he loved it so I made it again for New Years when my daughter & husband were here, they loved it as well! This will be our new holiday traditional side dish. *Note* It did  turned pinker when using fresh cranberries that I had frozen.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the yogurt.  I think mayo would have been a better choice.  Really great combo of cranberrys/apples etc.

I'm so sorry to say I was very disappointed with this recipe. I made it for Christmas dinner at my huband's familie's house and was so displeased with it that I almost didn't take it. My husband talked me into taking it and only two people ate it, my husband and one other person! Nobody even commented. I thought the presentation was very unappealing as well as the taste.

My craving for cranberries and walnuts led me to make this for a dinner party and everyone thought it was absolutely delicious.  I don't make dinner very often and it was very easy and quick to make.   I had jotted the recipe down and then lost it and couldn't remember what site I found it on.  I found it and will not lose this again!   THANK YOU!!

This was a bit too sour for me. I think it may have been the yogurt. I did add a bit more sugar but this did not seem to help. But it was pretty!

It was too sweet for me.  I'd put this salad in the "Deserts" category - not "Salads"... It was not totally bad, but not something I'd make again.

Just made this tonight... It was super quick and super DELISH! The only change I made was leaving out the raisins (not a big fan) and added a tad more cinnamon for my own personal taste. 

This will definitely be something I make often!

Everyone at my Christmas Eve dinner LOVED this salad. It was my first time making it and I wasn't sure, but I trusted what I read in the reviews and I'm glad. It was a HIT!  Perfect combo of ingredients. I used half green and half red grapes. I recommend using a food processor for chopping the cranberries.

I made this recipe and followed the advice of a few others and did not put in the full amount of cranberries.  I was going to substitute red grapes for white, but realized that I had none.  I put in a few extra raisins, apples, and walnuts.  Overall I thought it was a geat recipe, but a little too sweet for us.  Next time I will cut down the amount of sugar.

This has become a Christmas tradition in our home, we love it very much, especially with chicken or turkey pot pie!  I dress it up in a bed of ruffle edged lettuce on a red & white plate, it's quite festive.

This is really good! I use a small tub of cool whip instead of yogurt!
I added small marshmellows and mandarin oranges! YUM!The texture of the raisins are wonderful so I had to add more before anyone noticed I swiped most of them!

This was delicious. We had it at my sister's bridal shower and everyone enjoyed it. I suggest using red grapes instead of green - loved the vanilla taste! This makes a great snack.

This salad was delicious!  Being a new cook, I was a little nervous bringing a recipe I'd never made before to a family holiday party.  But everyone loved it!  I received rave reviews all night.  We especially liked how the recipe called for vanilla yogurt instead of a mayo mixture.  Thanks so much for this amazing recipe! I will definitely make it again.

I didn't really care for this, it was much too tart for my taste, and the flavor was just not quite right. Maybe too many cranberrys???..or a different dressing....??? I won't make this again. Sorry....

This is one of my fave recipes from this site! Can change it/tweak it depending on the fruit u have on hand and it's always excellent! And SO healthier than the similar cool whip Waldorf fruit salads!

Third party and once again it had rave reviews - some have guests had allergies to walnuts so exchanged for slivered almonds.

My husband & I didn't agree - 4 for me & a 2 for him.  But he is not a Waldorf salad kind of guy.  The only thing I would do different is maybe  skip the cranberries.  They need time to sweeten in the sauce but they turned it a pink color the longer they sat.

No one but me likes celery, so I left it out. But fundamentally, this is a new holiday tradition in our home. I served the vanilla yogurt on the side so people could choose whether to have it or not. Many compliments.

Easy to make & used regular low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of others suggestion of Greek yogurt.  We like to try things as written if possible & then make adjustments to our taste. Will make again any time, not just for the Thanksgiving/Christmas time. Hubby did use more amounts than called for with some ingredients.

A very good fruit salad.  Love the new twists to a traditional Waldorf.  I made it for Thanksgiving and it went quickly.  I made it again a week later and used it as a topping on my waffle when we had "breakfast for dinner".  Yum!

This recipe was just ok for me.   I followed others suggestions and only used 1 cup of cranberries and used Greek plain yoghurt bc didn't have vanilla. I added another spoon of sugar and a bit of vanilla extract but it was just ok

I've made the salad seven years in a row. I always make it with nonfat vanilla yogurt, plus a dash of vanilla extract. Fresh ground cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and clove powder is beauriful here. I use plenty of green and red grapes and the like. I used to cut the cranberries into spiral slices but now throw whole fresh berries into a processer to chop roughly; faster.

A lot depends on the vanilla yogurt you use.  Mine was quite sweet so I left out the additional sugar.  I didn't chop the cranberries, but halved the smaller ones and quartered the larger ones.  If I made it again I'd probably use a little less cinnamon too.  I also wondered if a little mayonnaise would enhance it.

I thought this was only okay, but  several people at the pot luck I took it to said they thought it was delicious.

After making this, I have decided to buy several bags of cranberries to freeze and use throughout the year. I did not have grapes to use and it still was amazing. I did add extra apples. The recipe didn't say to peel apples, so I didn't.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt and traded the walnuts for pecans because I love pecans. The tartness was perfect. No extra sugar for me. This will be made again and brought to Christmas dinner. I'd better be proactive and bring the recipe with me.

Wonderful!  I omitted the sugar, and made this with vanilla flavored coconut milk yogurt, which was delicious!  I also used homemade maple glazed walnuts and extra large raisins, and both tasted great in it.

This "Cranberry Waldorf" is absolutely perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas! It reminds me of the super sweet salads that my family typically likes to have, but much more delicious because it is made with fresh fruit. I personally am delighted that this one is all natural (one I am actually willing to eat - no fake whip cream, artificial flavors and colors, or questionable preservatives). I strongly recommend freezing the cranberries for this salad. I ran a test with my fresh organic cranberries. I found they were much less tart and softer after they were frozen and defrosted than when they were fresh. I will definitely make this salad again and again. Thank you THEA for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is awesome.  It's tart and pleasantly sweet at the same time - very healthy and low-fat, so it's perfect for those of us watching calories.  

When I took it to a family function at Thanksgiving three different people asked for the recipe and everyone raved about it.

My family absolutely LOVES this for Thanksgiving, as we're not huge fans of cranberry sauce. I make this exactly as written, except with a bit more sugar. It's a nice contrast to some of the heavier Thanksgiving foods. Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This salad was delicious.  I didn't have to add any sugar because I used 1 1/2 c. of dried cranberries instead which have some sugar in it.  We make our own yogurt so I sweetened it with agave nectar and added that.  It was absolutely deeelliiiccciiioouuusss.  I think the key is a lot of fresh cinnamon!

Yum. Left out the sugar and it was still plenty sweet for me.

One of my favorites - found it a few years ago while making a Thanksgiving dinner (for 60 ppl) in Japan. Many of my students loved it and asked for the recipe. It's been a regular ever since.

Best waldorf salad I've ever had.  Omitted the raisins and extra sugar; substituted organic low fat vanilla yogurt; & threw in a few more walnuts than called for. Healthier & tastier substitute for the old fashioned waldorf salad & the kids loved it!

This recipe was wonderful, and will be a Christmas tradition from now on. My family doesn't normally like cranberries, but this was a hit.  The recipe was perfect as is and I did not change a thing.

This was a great change to traditional holiday fruit salads. I kept all of the leftovers for myself.

So, opposite to the Butternut Squash Soup reaction, while I enjoyed this Waldorf Salad a lot, I don't think too many others did.  I did think it was a little bland, and maybe should have heeded the advice of a previous review and added cool whip instead of plain yogurt.
