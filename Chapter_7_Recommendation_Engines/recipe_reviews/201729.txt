Because I did not have instant banana pudding on hand, I used instant chocolate pudding. I wanted a richer flavor so I used a can of evaporated milk and just added 2% milk up to the two cup mark. I took The Bunny Chef's tip and used two tablespoons peanut butter instead of two teaspoons. These froze up nicely, I just used dixie cups with popsicle sticks stuck into them. I think the peanut butter could even be doubled again to four tablespoons for next time. These turned out a very good cold treat.

I made this with sugar free pudding and did just what the recipe said with the peanut butter, I warmed it in the nuke for 15 seconds and it blended perfectly. My children fell over when they had this, they just loved it and so did Mom! Use name brand PB only!

My 4 year old loved these frozen pudding pops. I didn't have any issues with seperation of the mixture, used peter pan peanut butter, warmed it only slightly enough to stir easily into the pudding. Only thing different was I added a sliced of banana to the bottom of my cup to hold my stick in place. Thanks john

These are fabulous! I made them expecting my daughter to enjoy them, and she did...but my husband liked them even more! I had no problems with the peanut butter separating. I used Skippy and I used a heaping tablespoon because I knew we would want a stronger PB flavor. Maybe the separation occurs with the natural peanut butters but another thought is to only warm the PB just enough to blend into the pudding. This would be a fun recipe to experiment with different flavor combinations and I plan on trying sugar free pudding to see if that will work. Great fun, thanks John!

These tasted great- although I followed the exact recipe, when the pops were frozen, the peanut butter separated to the top and to the bottom. I kinda enjoyed it though. I was like the old fashioned creamsickles with the cream on the bottom!! Very tasty!

Made these today. I found them more icy than pudding-like. I mixed in the warm peanut butter as the pudding was setting. I poured it into the mold just before it thickened completely so I didn't have to spoon it in and make a mess.

John these rock!!!! My kids and my husband love them. I used small plastic cups like those you use when rinsing your mouth in the bathroom and popsicle sticks. I rinsed the cups after removing the popsicle and re-used to make more of these. Cheap and delish!!!  I did add an extra tblspoon of pnut butter per the previous reviews. I did not have banana pudding mix for the second batch so I pureed some banana and added it using vanilla pudding mix and they were wonderful!!!! I am going to use chocolate and pb next!!! Thank you John for a recipe with endless possibility!!!!!

Very good and easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the peanut butter (doubled it).

I really loved the subtle peanut butter taste and the texture of the popsicle.  I didn't like the artificial banana taste of the pudding mix, but that's not the fault of this recipe.  I may however make a reese's inspired pop and use the chocolate fudge pudding mix.  Thanks!!

Delish!!! Simple and easy. I didn't have one problem with the peanut butter separating in this recipe. I tasted mine and felt it needed a tad more peanut butter, so I added a total of a TBSP. My kids loved these!!! Will make again.

Tasty enough.  I'd never had a pudding pop before, so I was sort of surprised at the texture.  It's good!  It's just not like ice cream.  First it's frozen, and then it's exactly like... pudding.  Which shouldn't be a surprise, but always was.

Love this recipe!!  I made these today and they are so yummy!  Quick and easy to fix.  I made mine with cheescake flavor sugar-free pudding mix and used about two tablespoons of extra chunky peanut butter.  This is a good alternative to ice cream and with fewer calories.  Can't wait to make them again, maybe chocolate next time.

These were pretty good!  The texture was good- not icy and not drippy.  There were no issues with the PB separating.  I had to use sugar free pudding because it's all the store had.  Also I used 2 T peanut butter but would use more next time because I love it.  1 1/2 t would have been very hard for me to taste but it looks like it worked for other reviewers.  I'm going to try making chocolate PB popsicles!

Great recipe! I also added a little extra peanut butter (about a tbl spoon) but my taste buds aren't what they used to be :p. Thanks for the recipe.
