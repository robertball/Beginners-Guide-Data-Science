I make this for overnight guests and it never fails.  However, I usually bake it at 425 F for 25 minutes. 

We always serve it with powdered sugar and lemon or lime wedges squeezed over the top of the finished Baby.  Also, I add 1/4 tsp. vanilla to the batter and preheat the pan.  I melt the butter in the pan in the oven and pour the batter into the hot pan (after rolling the pan to spread the butter evenly).

My family loves these.  I bake them in one 13x9x2 pan at 400 until puffy and golden at the edges.  I also always liberally sprinkle the top with a cinnamon/sugar mixture before putting the pan in the oven to bake.  Sometimes I'll put a layer of thinly sliced granny smith apples on the bottom of the pan, and then pour the batter on top.  I also love to serve this with the sauteed apples that are on this site.  When I don't bake these with the apples, I always make sure that there's warm maple syrup on hand.

These are wonderful, my whole family loves them.  Thanks for a good recipe.  Be warned however, when working with this dutch babies (or popovers or yorkshire pudding) from time to time you may have to work with them to get them to puff up.  I always start with a hot oven 425 degrees and drop to 375 when they start to rise - always works.  Usually melt a little butter in the pan as well to start with a hot pan.

So I made this and followed the recipe.  NOT GOOD! Went to the Seattle Times Food Section on line and found where this goes wrong.  Use a cast iron pan, 10".  Heat oven to 425.  Mix ingreedients in blender.  Have Dutch Baby goodness.

Let me start by saying I had never had a Dutch Baby until I made this recipe.  I made it for the first time last week and followed the directions exactly, except that I had to nearly double the cooking time.  I came back to AR and looked at other reviews and decided to try again.  So, I made this recipe again last night and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of vanilla.  I also melted one Tbsp butter in a glass pie plate in the oven while the oven was heating up.  I then poured in the batter, added about 15 minutes to the cooking time, and wow!  They really puffed up this time and had a much better consistency and taste.  I just served with butter and a little powdered sugar.  I will definitely be making these again and again!

A great alternative to pancakes and eggs, because this tastes like a combination of the two.  Easy for small children to handle.  Much less messy than pouring pancakes and easier to cook.  Great texture.  I used a 9 inch cake pan, which worked well.  Tasted great with butter and syrup.  Perfect for a family of four, especially if served with fruit and a breakfast meat.  Will definitely become a breakfast staple.

I'm not sure if it was just my oven, but I had to bake it for longer.  The taste was good, although next time I will probably add some nutmeg and cloves for more spice.  Fresh berries on top were excellent, and the texture was like a rich custard.  I added a little vanilla to mine, which I thought gave it a nice ring.  :)

Yum!  This is the best version of this recipe--easily thrown together for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  It can be sweet or savory. I add chopped green onions and herbs to serve with thin sliced country ham.  Delish.

These were interesting.  I am familiar with popovers, but this was my first time eating a Seattle Dutch Baby.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor and you really need to pair it with something that has a strong taste like fresh berries.  I used apples and cinnabutter (also from this site), but it wasn't enough and really needed more.  I think it would be good with fresh berries and powdered sugar though.  I may try it again when berry season comes around.

This always makes me feel like a champ in the kitchen.  Her recipe is fail-safe.  I put it all in the food processor and whirl together for less than one minute, then do the rest exactly the same.  Be sure to do the additional 5 minutes at 325 - I skipped that twice and the third time did so, and it was MUCH better - the sides got crispy.  BRAVO WOMAN - 

UPDATE:  Did a pair of Dutch Babies in the small #4 cast irons, they came out magnificent with both of them riding the sides of pans.  We had two baby Dutch Babies!  YUMMMILLY

It looked interesting & puffed up nicely but tasted dull even with cinnamon sugar.

Kids and I love this.  It's very easy if you plan ahead to heat up oven and let it bake.  I use 4 eggs and 1 cup of the flour and milk in a 9x9 pan or a 10" skillet and there are 4 good-sized wedges. However, if we want more than that, I double ingredients and use a 9x13 pan.  Great with many toppings- spread on some jam for an easy, on-the-go breakfast!  11/10  powdered sugar and a sqeeze of lime is divine.  whole wheat flour doesnt puff.

I'm a Seattle girl, and this is basically the recipe I learned in high school (!) except I use 1/4 cup butter. Agree with the reviewers who stress that melting the butter in the pan in the oven is important to get the babies to puff up. I've made this as a savory dish, topped with cheese and green chile or salsa. But it's really best with fresh lemon lemon and powdered sugar. Definitely an easy Sunday brunch or quick weekday breakfast-for-dinner at our house.

Loved this! Fast and easy. My VERY picky grandson who never eats more than a few bites of anything, asked for and ate seconds! I served it with a Blueberry sauce made by adding 1 cup of Maple Syrup and 1 1/2 Cups of Frozen Blueberries and bringing it to a boil over med/low heat, and boiled it for a minute or two. It was a Hit!

Using the Magic Bullet, I added 1 T. sugar to the batter.  I preheated the oven to 450° and used a cast iron skillet, melting real butter (which is absolutely needed for taste).  I reduced the heat to 400° and cooked it a total of 20 minutes.  A basic Dutch pancake but nothing special.  I would make it again because it is very easy and fed 3 people adequately with apple pie filling on the side.

I had a Dutch Baby recipe that I made for my family for years. It was a true family favorite. Then I lost the recipe. I tried another gal's recipe, but it was definitely not the Dutch Baby Recipe my family has always known and loved. Then I tried your recipe. BINGO!!!! This is it...this is the one. Thank you, so much, for submitting it. I'm in heaven.  :-)

We used to eat these on special occasions when I was a kid.  They are SO delicious...my husband had never had them, and he was VERY impressed.  I serve them with lemon juice and powdered sugar.  5 stars with the correct oven temperature/timing.  I had to cook them for almost twice this amount of time.  10 mins on 375, then after 10 more at 325, I upped the temp. to 350 and gave them an additional 5 minutes.  I think if the temp started hotter (some reviewers said 425) it would have gone a bit faster.  Either way, you know they're done when they puff up and they are no longer liquidy in the center. Yum Yum, thanks for bringing me back to my childhood :-)

Fail. This was as heavy and dense as possible. I followed the directions to "stir until smooth" but this wasn't anything like a popover. I rarely have a recipe not turn out so I don't know if it was my technique or a bad recipe. I've never had a Dutch baby before but I'm sure my end result wasn't it. I took a picture, but yuck, this just didn't turn out. Sorry :(

So easy and yummy! I didn't change a thing and this recipe was just like the Dutch Babies we used to order at the restaurant. The pancake itself isn't supposed to be too flavorful, it's the toppings (in our case, fresh-squeezed lemon juice and lots of powdered sugar) that give it real zing! The trick is to bake the pancake long enough for it to puff up and brown slightly at the edges. We had to bake a bit longer than the recipe said, adjusting for our oven and the type of pie dish used.

I've never eaten one of these before, but it wasn't bad.  It tastes like french toast to me.  It puffed up like crazy...that was fun to see!  I'm at high altitude, and it was still puffy.  I wish I read the reviews beforehand...the pancake was in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes, then I read the reviews while I was waiting, and then cranked up the heat to 425 for another 10 minutes.  It was puffy and brown and beautiful.  Added powdered sugar and real maple syrup on top at the end, but overall, a little too egg-y for me.

This was awesome!  We made it this morning for breakfast exactly as stated.  We put chopped banana in the pan before pouring the batter in and served with warm maple syrup.  Then we listened to Jack Johnson while having breakfast. :)

this has been a staple for Christmas morning in our home for years.  While it is baking, we'd check out the stockings or open a special gift.  I have topped them with ligonberries (a compromise for my Swedish background) when available.  Or homemade raspberry jam or whatever homemade jam was in the pantry!!!  Powdered sugar a must! (just for the effect on a snowy holiday morning!)

Very good! Exactly how I remember them from my childhood. I added a spoonful of sugar and a capful of vanilla to the batter, then topped with powder sugar, butter and fresh lemon. My only complaint would be that it took longer to bake than the recipe said. But overall, this is definitely a keeper recipe!

These were great served with the cinnabutter recipe I found and drizzled with maple syrup.  However, I don't think mine turned out right, for they were more like custard than a popover.  We like them anyway.

This is so good and so easy! I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked it at 425 for 25 min. as well as melting the butter in my pan before adding the mix to it and it came out perfect. I did add a splash of vanilla for some extra taste. If I were to do anything different it would be maybe try making it in a 10 in. pan instead as it puffed up so much on the sides it collapsed in one spot.

Made this this morning. Exactly as directed, except added 1 t vanilla.
Too eggie for me, so I will try Dutch Babies II next time, adding 1 t of almond extract. This is so quick & easy.

This is one great recipe.  My grandma used to make Dutch Babies for me and my cousin in the summers when I was a kid.  I was just browsing through the Seattle recipes because I live about 30 miles away.  I found this recipe and it brought back so many great memories from childhood.  Thank you so much for sharing.  Next time I make I am going to probably add sausage and cheddar cheese.  YUMMY!

it was more like an inch thick pancake with a custard like texture. I think the oven temperature was way off. we made one last week that was cooked at 450 degrees and then reduced to 425. that one puffed up and was wonderful. don't know what happened with this.

I made this exactly as it was written but after the allotted cooking time it was still raw so after checking the reviews and the reviews on other similar recipes I upped the oven temp to 425 and cooked it another 15 minutes. It looked good but was still a little undercooked, I should have left it in for another 5 minutes

Most of the time I have to be careful not to overcook things in my oven, but with this recipe I had to keep it in much longer than the 15 minutes that was listed.  I'm not sure how much longer - I just kept baking it until it puffed and resembled a popover.  It didn't turn out to be quite the texture I was expecting, however the taste was good and I enjoyed it with extra butter and a cup of hot tea.

i don't know what went wrong, but mine didn't puff up AT ALL.  i started it at 425 then turned it down to 375, baked for 15 minutes...it came out like super dense scrambled eggs but tasted a bit like french toast with the butter and syrup.  but, i won't make it again, unless i can figure out how to make the texture come out right...

The first one I made, I followed the recipe to a T. And it took much longer to cook then suggested and it was much thicker then other dutch babies I have made. The second one I made, i used a square glass pan and preheated it with butter. I also turned up the heat to 425 like some suggested and it turned out much better the second time. I will try it again and find my perfect style.

My husband and I LOVE these dutch babies!  Make sure to pre-heat the pan in the oven.  I like to melt some butter in the pan just before adding the batter.  They are great with fresh berries or jam and powdered sugar. Yum!

Great recipe. So simple and so tasty. A nice change from pancakes and so much quicker. Like another reviewer suggested, I melt the butter in the pan and then swirl it around and add the batter. Simple! I normally don't turn the temp down, but just keep an eye on it.

I'm giving this a 4 only because it was easy and baked up nice (at a higher temp as suggested by others).  However, this was very eggy.  I've had Dutch Babies in restaurants before and it's always more like a big pancake/pastry.  This is like a sweet omelet.

ahhh, yes YUM!  From WA now in CA - I missed these so much.  I threw the ingredients into the magic bullet and then into the pan - and 30 minutes later, my babies appear!  

I didn't need to turn the temp down though - I like to have the edges curl up and get crispy.  Just like Dad made them.

This turned out well. I used Bisquick instead of flour, and no salt. I don't think it made enough for myself and my 2 daughters (ages 5 and 9) so I'll probably change the serving size to 6 next time.

This was quick and easy, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It needed a lot of lemon and powdered sugar to make it taste good. It would be better with lemon zest, cinnamon, vanilla, or a little sugar added to the batter. Will try a different recipe on this site next time.

I've made something similar but it was called an oven pancake. My recipe called for half cup flour, half cup milk a and 2 eggs... everything else is the same. I melt the butter in a pie plate while the oven preheats. I cook at 400 for 15 minutes and they come out perfect every time. Dust with some powdered sugar and serve with syrup or fruit. Delish! I make them at least once a week.

This is a nice change from the usual pancakes, but the baking time was off.  It needs higher heat in order to puff.

I've made dutch babies using this recipe 3 or 4 times now. The first time they puffed up well. The 2nd time, not so much. I think the pan you use makes a big difference. When I used a glass pan they tended not to puff up as much. I don't have a cast iron pan, so I used an Emile Henry baking dish this last time and they puffed up fantastically. I also followed recommendations to heat the oven higher (I went to 425). I lowered the temp back to 325 after about 15 minutes and cooked for 10 more minutes. The visual results are stunning with the big puffy crust. We usually eat these with a combination of powdered sugar plus lemon juice or brown sugar plus a little butter. Or, we top with berries and whip cream.

It was a nice tasty but a bit rubbery. I might make it again since my daughter and hunny liked it but I will try for a softer puffer taste. Also had to bake for an extra five or so minutes to get it cooked through. Maybe a higher temp will give me the results I am looking for

My son Loves these! I usually make something similar to this which I got out of a just for kids cookbook that I've had since I was 10 and it tasted pretty much the same. This was good but there is NEVER enough, which is the same issue I had with the other recipe. I will give these another try and hope for thicker and if not I will just go back to my kids cookbook.

My mom has a great recipe for these but I used this recipe instead of calling her, big mistake. These were super thick, even though I cooked them longer than the recommended time they were still doughy in the middle. It was also really bland, even with the lemon juice and powdered sugar on it.

For simplicity, 5 stars, for taste, four; was nice; but not soemthing (excepting my husband, lol); one would eat alone; must have some sort of topping or syrup with these; but with that; these certianally don't last long!

I remember eating dutch babies (always fun to say!) growing up, on cold mornings. I lost my recipe and this was the closest to the one I remember.All of my 4 boys loved it and begged for more.I love mine drowned in maple syrup! Great recipe!

When I made this I cooked this for about 20 minutes. I thought it was ok, but I'm sure it could be better. My daughter said she would prefer it to have less eggs. She said it would be better if it tasted more like a pancake. I'm really not sure how this should taste, because I never had a real Dutch Baby. I'm going to try it again with only two eggs and see what happens.

These turned out ok for my very first try. It definitely took longer to bake (about twice as long)and they were thicker than I had wanted them to be. I used a standard sized stoneware pie dish, so I will use a larger dish next time. I also added a little vanilla, as well as sliced apples with cinnamon and sugar. Very tasty! Will try it again.

Absurdly easy to make, and my wife loves them.  Minus one star because they're not quite as fluffy as I'd like them to be.

I increased my ingredients a bit and used:  5 tablespoons butter, 6 eggs, 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 teaspoons sugar.  I turned the oven on to preheat and then put the butter in the pan.  I put the pan in the oven while it was preheating until the butter was hot and sizzling, then I added the batter to the pan.  YUM!!!

I cut the butter down to 1 T and used soymilk... sprinkled sugar and cinnimon on top before baking. I warmed the eggs in a bowl of water and heated the milk in the microwave.  I also heated my pan in the oven for a few minutes. I baked at 425 for 15 minutes and then turned it down to 375 for the last 7. I like this recipe better than the recipe that came my "Oven Pancake Pan" which calls for 6 eggs, 1 c flour, 1 c milk, 2 T sugar and longer baking time.  This recipe is lighter and less eggy. Thanks, Anneliese.

Delicious breakfast treat! I follow the recipe except that I melt the butter in a 9" cake pan, sprinkle a little cinnamon in the butter, then pour the batter in the center and immediately return it to the oven. Mine always bakes at 375° for 19-20 minutes. I always eat it covered with lemon juice and powdered sugar, but some of my family like it better plain. It's delicious either way! :)

Time has to be changed on this recipe.  Double like other reviews said.  Obviously by looking at the ingredients, this is bland, but I think it's supposed to be.  It is a carrier for all the sweet toppings you choose to put on top of it.  A different breakfast item, but good for a change.

After reading several reviews and researching the recipe in a Seattle paper I adjusted the temp to 400F and cooked for 20 min.  in a 10 in. cast iron skilled. I also melted my butter in the skilled as the oven preheated. Next time I will add 1-2  tbsp. of sugar to the batter. It was good with syrup or fresh fruit.

I make this recipe quite often and because I’m at high altitude (7,500 ft) I always add 1/2 tsp. baking powder and it “puffs.” Definitely need this otherwise it turns out flat.

Only 4 stars cause I followed my gut and used a heated 12" cast iron pan at 425 for 15 and 375 for 10. I used the recipe to a tee. My 4 year old son loved this with my homemade berry sauce and whipped cream. Will continue to use this recipe but will do so in my trusty cast iron pan.

Love it!  But definitely change the temperature to  425°  And backs for 18 minutes.  Heat a cast iron skillet in the oven while you pre heat it with some melted butter then pour batter in.

This turned out great!  I put a little bit of butter in my glass pie plate in the oven, then poured the batter in.  I added 1/4 tsp. Cinnamon and 3/4 tsp. Vanilla extract into the batter.  I also added a few tbsp. Sugar and baked it for 25 minutes.  We put powdered sugar and chopped strawberries and bananas on it.  My family ate the whole thing!!!

The "popover" turned into a "pop-up"!! I got a good laugh watching it rise...I wondered when the sides would rise but they didn't. I'm not sure if I did anything incorrect or if this type of pastry is just fickle. Or maybe a gas oven?  I'm thinking a combination of all after reading other reviews.  I added vanilla extract, ground cardamom (cuz I'm weird like that) and cinnamon. The flavor was still bland but I actually preferred it. I cut out some and poured warm dark honey and powdered sugar. I   am going to keep trying this until I get it "right"....then I'll give it 5 stars!

Simple and tasty light breakfast.  Cooking time needed to be adjusted... in an 8" square pan, cooked at 375 for 20 minutes, and an additional 350 for 10 minutes.  Sides curl up as expected, bottom ends up about 1/4 inch thick.  Seems like everyone's cooking times vary on this one...
Also added a little vanilla and sugar to the mix, and a little baking soda to fluff it up.  Brushed on butter and lemon juice after cooking, sprinkled with powdered sugar.

This gets 5 stars because it was delicious! Creamy custard like texture that paired well with sautéed apples seasoned with sugar and cinnamon! I thickened a little apple juice with cornstarch and combined with the apples before pouring over the Dutch baby after it came out of the oven to make a nice sauce. I found the baking temperature to be way off! I had to crank the oven up to 400 and even after it started to look puffed I had to finish it with my convection oven setting still at 400 F. Even so, it is so good we will be having this again often!

Followed the recipe exactly the first time I made this and it was great but a little plain. This time I added a lot of fruit and had to raise the temp to 400 for it too rise and cook it for a minute longer.
