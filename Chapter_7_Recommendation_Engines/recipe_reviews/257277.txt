This recipe is worth the making if only for the dressing. The flavors of the dressing are great. I did make one big mistake and forgot to add the artichoke hearts. Nevertheless this was really good.

Came out very good. Used asparagus instead of artichoke hearts and added imported mozzarella cheese. Very delectable.
