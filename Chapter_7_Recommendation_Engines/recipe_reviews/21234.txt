I could not make this punch fast enough for my holiday guests!  I added Meyers Dark Rum and it was just the right touch.  Thank you for a wonderful beverage.

I served this punch at a Christmas party, and everyone loved it!  A few people even asked me for the recipe.  I made an ice ring with pinapple/cranberry juice and orange slices to keep it cold.

This is a very nice punch recipe, but I should have paid more attention to the number of servings it made; I had way too much. Next time I'll make half the recipe. Also, the cherries probably could be left out -- they weren't necessary.

I recently used this recipe for my daughter's baby shower.  Several men attended and raved about the punch!  They didn't even mind that it was non-alcoholic!!  I left out the marachino cherries because I forgot to buy them, but added some fresh mint. The mint added some extra color and an interesting flavor.

I used this punch for Christmas and the kids really enjoyed it.  Then last week my nephew called me up and asked if I could make the punch for his birthday party.  Now I truly know it was a success!

This punch was a big hit at a recent celebration and we received several requests for the recipe.  It was very easy to make and we will definitely make it again!

I used pink lemonade.  I lessened the amount of lemonade and added a bit more OJ.  In addition to the orange slices, we added some fresh orange peel strings with a zester. Rather than the ginger ale, we replaced it with 50/50 (sour soda) so it wouldn't be too sweet.
 
The fun part was adding some small ice molds using mini bundt pans and froze white cranberry juice, fresh cranberries, orange zest and an orange slice in each one.  

It was very festive and overall a great recipe to use!!

This was great! But man oh man did it make a lot of punch. I didn't even really consider the quantities before starting and I was having to jump back and forth between several containers to make it work. Overall it tastes great though!

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. It was perfect for the kids and the adults spiked it with their favorite alcohol. Instead of adding the fruit directly to the punch, i froze it in a bit of water and sprite and added the big ice chunk to the punch. It made a great visual and kept the punch cool all night.

Over all this was a great punch, I didn't pay enough attention to the portion size though and in the future I'd make it a half recipe. Thank goodness I have a large punch bowl. I also doubled the orange juice as I found it too gingerale-y for me. I floated sliced or oranges and frozen pineapple and strawberries in it to keep it cold instead of ice, keep your punch from getting watered down. Good punch recipe I'll use it again.

Very refreshing. Only change I made was using 100% Juice Cranberry juice instead of Carnberry juice cocktail gave it A more  "Refreshing" taste. Thanks for posting this.

I didn't like how tart the cranberry juice made it, so I added extra lemonade and orange juice and gingerale. It was pretty good, but I've made better.

This was pretty good.  I had almost none left.  It wasn't spectacular like I was expecting but it was a quick and easy recipe for a pleasing punch.  I would make this again.

Great punch for any party.  Instead of using ice I froze part of the punch in a ring and place orange slices and cherries.  As it melted it didn't dilute the punch.

Served it on Thanksgiving.  It makes a lot...thank goodness because no one wanted to drink anything else!  It is simply delicious.  At the end of the night, the punch bowl (the third batch) was dry.

I spiked it with rum and it was a huge it at a recent party-noone drank anything else-even the guys! I froze cranberries and oranges in lemonade as the other reviewers suggested and that too was a huge hit!  Just make sure you make enough!!

Made this for Thanksgiving Day with a group of 23 family members.  Went over very well, but nothing spectacular.  I liked it because it wasn't overly sweet.  I dropped in frozen cranberries instead of the marashino cherries, it was definitely a festive looking punch!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party. It was a hit. Very easy to make and very flavorful. It would be easy to make an alcoholic version if that would please the crowd, too.

I downloaded this recipe about 4 years ago (and only now submitting a review :) and have used it so many times I lost count! It is a staple in my cookbook. I like to use a cranberry ginger ale and cut the amount of lemonade back a bit, but wow, what a great punch! I always receive so many compliments from our guests!

Easy and quick to throw together!  A "not sweet" punch...very refreshing...got lots of compliments!  I sliced my oranges and put them in a bowl of water to freeze for the ice to keep it cold...a nice presentation.

I made this punch for our Thanksgiving, everyone loved it!!! I omitted the cherries and oranges, added fresh raspberries and blue berries.  Will use at Christmas.

I made this for my holiday party.  I used frozen cranberries instead of the cherries. Looked very festive floating in the bowl with orange slices, and they served as ice cubes keeping the punch cold.  It was all drank by the end of the night.  Fabulous!

Nice, fruity punch.  A great beverage to serve at a party.  Best of all, it can be made well in advance and kept refrigerated.

This was great. I made it with lemonade and with pineapple juice and I prefer the pineapple juice. When made with 100% juice pineapple, cranberry and orange juice it has much less sugar.  I floated cranberries instead of the cherries. Made an ice ring with cranberries and mint leave, it looked very festive and tasted wonderful!!

Big hit at my Chritmas gathering my friends couldn't get enough. I had some frozen whole cranberries on hand so I used these instead of the marachino cherries.

Served at our Christmas Dinner yesterday and was a hit!  Surprised by how much it made, punch bowl too small to hold full batch.  Mixed juices and added ginger ale to glass until enough room in bowl opened up.

I've made this for a few different events in a 2 gallon drink cooler with a spout.  It is refreshing and delicious and not overly sweet and the leftovers hold the sparkle for a few days in the fridge.

This tasted great, but the color was bland, so I added Cherry Kool-Aid and was glad that I didn't add sugar, or it would have been too sweet.  I also froze cubes of the punch (w/o the ginger ale) for the punch bowl so it would not dilute the punch.  My daughter liked the cubes so well that she wanted more punch cubes to have to snack on.  Very good!

I’ve made this twice and both groups really like it. I used pineapple juice instead of lemonade and ice cubes made out of white cranberry juice and cherries (which, when melted, added at least 1 cup to the punch). I froze the sliced oranges as well. I made half the recipe and it was enough for about 15 glasses. 

I put the juice mixture in a 2L pitcher and kept the ginger ale in its bottle and combined in individual glasses until there was room in the pitcher to add the soda. I left a bottle of spiced rum next to the pitcher for those who wanted a little "kick". 

I'd give this recipe 5 stars as alcoholic punch when adding rum and 4 as non-alcoholic punch. I will definitely make this again.

This was very good.  I liked the flavor a lot.  I do think it needed more carbonation so next time I will double the gingerale.

this is a great holiday punch recipe! i made some modifications... took out the lemonade and orange juice (mostly b/c it made the color of the punch a bit muddy and tasted a bit sour for me) and i replaced it with orangina.  i also switched out the cherries and added frozen raspberries instead.  keep a bottle of red wine on the side for guests to add an ounce or 2 to their drink.  excellent holiday drink!  thank you very much for the inspiration

Perfect Punch! Thanks very much for this recipe. I made this for a Holiday party and it turned out perfect and delicous. I appreciate that all the ingredients are basic and inexpensive. I added an ice ring as others suggested, which made for a very nice presentation. I reserved some of the punch for the ice ring and added orange slices and a few strawberries.

It was perfect for Thanksgiving. The orange slices look great on top, but cherries sink to the bottom. Maybe they aren't needed...tastes great regardless!

Made this for our family Christmas Gathering and everyone loved it.  We froze some orange and lemon slices and some cranberries and put them in the serving jar as a decoration.  We doubled the recipe but left out about a cup of cranberry juice.  Refreshing and delicious punch that was easy to make.

All ages loved this punch.  24 people and we drank 3 batches.  I used cranberry ginger ale instead of regular ginger ale.
Adults like it spike with a shot of vodka.

This was fantastic!!  I did make a couple changes, I used cranberry lemonade (Ocean Spray) 2 bottles, Orangina (orange/grapefruit punch) 1 bottle, Pineapple juice, 1 large can, and ginger ale 1, 2 liter bottle.  I cut up mandarin oranges (4), a fresh pineapple (1), and added 26 oz's of Rum and 13 oz's of Malibu Rum...believe it or not you can barely taste the alcohol.  Enjoy, we sure did...so convenient when you have a house full!!

I make this every holiday party. I add a pint of lemon sorbet to the punch bowl just when the guests arrive. Kids love it.

I added Captain Morgan rum to this punch for our Christmas party. It was a huge hit, had to make a second batch. I left out the cherries.

Fantastic punch! I was afraid it was too much punch.  I made a full batch for a christmas party- it was gone within 2 hours! I had to make a second batch.  Everyone loved it.  I left it as is and had rum on the side for those who wanted a kick.  This is a must have for a party! Next time when I make it I will prepare an ice ring with juice the day before.

This recipe was very easy and a hit with the my lady friends (make sure you adjust the serving number to your size party).  I used 1 cup bacardi gold rum per small punch bowl.  I also used wiskey soaked cherries which do not float so just add to the glass with the orange slice.  Truly delicious.  We drank several glass full which is tough with some other holiday coctails that call for egg nog or heavy cream. I got lucky with this one. If you buy your ingrediants cold (lemonade, gingerale) you can throw it together with ice in the glasses at your hosts place and skip the 2 hour refrig. time.

So good!  I tried this one for a baby shower and have used it ever since.  I always get asked for the recipe and it has become a family reunion favorite as well.

I was looking for something "different" from the 'ol Hawaiian Punch and 7up mixture when I came across this.  It was very easy and delicious and all my friends loved it.  I was expecting leftovers--there wasn't any!!!

Excellent recipe! I made this for our family christmas dinner - enough to have leftovers for at least a couple of days following, but it was all gone! Even the wine and beer drinkers helped themselves to a couple of glasses of this! Very nice, will definitely make again
