These are really delicious!  I used sugar-free apricot preserves and substituted nutmeg for the mace (since I didn't have any on hand).  Be sure to add the water only as needed (I didn't use the full 6 tablespoons).  The preserves oozed out a bit during baking so using parchment paper could make removing them from the cookie sheets a little easier.  YUM!

These were pretty good. I substituted apricot preserves with peach and used cinnamon instead of mace and sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and sugar on top after brushing on the milk. The secret is to keep the dough as cool as you can to make a stiff spiral.

Very good--definitely more pastry like than cookie like.  I really wasn't clear on the method of twisting, so I tried it a couple of ways.  I also used a couple of different types of preserves.  I don't have apricot, so I used a prune plum jam (not the best, since it had HUGE pieces of fruit in it) and a cherry raspberry jam I'd made earlier this year.  Although both tasted good, the cherry rasberry was the best for keeping in the jam itself.  I'd recommend a jelly or a jam with very tiny pieces of fruit or seeds--otherwise the fruit oozes out too.  Also, be careful with the amount.  You don't want it to ooze too much . . .I baked on alum foil bc I didn't want to scrub my pans for hours.  Thanks for the recipe!
