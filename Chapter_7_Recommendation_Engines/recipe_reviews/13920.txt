I made this to accompany strip steaks and Garden Stuffed Baked Potatoes (from this site). Like others suggested, I toasted the almond slices and used less lemon (no zest but I squeezed half a lemon). The end result was phenomenal. The almonds gave the broccoli a woodsy flavor and a nice crunch. Thank you!

Wonderful, I'll probably do this every time.  I toasted the almonds on a pan and crumbled them, omitted the lemon zest and used juice from 1/2 a lemon.  Thanks for sharing.

Lightly seasoned with lemon, the absence of garlic was a refreshing change, and I resisted the urge to add it. I measured nothing, just added butter, lemon juice and toasted sliced almonds to accomodate my taste - and skipped the lemon zest altogether. I think it would have been lemon overkill otherwise. To preserve their crunch I added the toasted almonds just before serving, which also proved to be a pretty garnish.

The theory's nice, but this one is way, WAY too lemony. It covered the rest of the flavors up completely. With a lot less lemon this would be excellent.

A good way to make steamed broccoli a little more than just steamed broccoli but I definitely agree with other reviewers in that the butter-lemon ratio was off. This was more like Broccoli with buttery lemon sauce.. I did add the almonds but come to think of it... didn't really notice them at all. It was a tad sour, but I did like it when it just lightly covered the broccoli, the rest of my family ate it, but didn't enjoy it.

A little less lemon juice, toast the almonds and it is 5 stars!  Don't overcook the broccoli.

Yay! Finally a way to prepare broccoli that makes me actually WANT to eat it! The lemon makes it taste so summery, it was great with seafood & rice. Thanks!

Although this made a change from plain, steamed broccoli, I don't think I'll try this recipe again. It had way too much lemon flavor (my sister wouldn't even eat it because she thought it was too sour) and not enough almond flavor. Maybe if you added less lemon and a tiny bit of almond extract it might taste better.

Quite good. The almonds (toasted) stole the show. It was a great pairing with baked chicken-in-sour-cream recipe from this site.

Cut the lemon juice in 1/2 & toasted the almonds.  Glad to try something new with broccoli but it didn't blow me away.

Easy, quick & yummy.  I substituted green beans. It was a nice twist on the usual veggie dish.  I will make again.

This was fine but nothing special for me. I am not sure if lemon is the right flavor to go with broccoli, I will probably won't make this again.

I used frozen green beans instead, and toasted the almonds and smashed them into crumbles so they wouldn't fall to the bottom. Very yummy, especially as the side dish to "Grilled Swordfish with Rosemary" on this site, which is also lemon-y.

I made this last night and served it with the Cola Pot Roast and garlic mashed potatoes, it was very good. I didn't have the almonds so just went with the lemon and butter and I put some garlic powder in it, everyone thought it was very good. I would differently make it again with that type of menue or even a BBQ item, get tired of the cheese or mayo on top of broccoli.

I made this for my roommates and they loved it. The only thing is, I don't think you need to go to all the trouble of making a "lemon butter sauce". The second time I made this, I just steamed the broccoli in the microwave w/some butter already in the bowl, and then added lemon juice on top. Same effect. It is a great flavor combination though!

This was a wonderful dish. Very quick and easy. It will go well with most entrees especially Asian dishes. Added on 4/16: I made this recipe again for Easter. It was a big hit with everyone.

Great change-of-pace way to serve broccoli.  I thought 2T seemed like a lot of lemon juice, so I only added 1T. My husband and I loved it, but our son didn't care for the lemon.  Hubby liked it so well, he now thinks this is the only way broccoli should be served.. next time, I'll set aside some for the kids before adding the lemon.

I thought this was awesome.  I am not sure what constitutes a "bunch" of broccoli but I think I doubled the broccoli and everything else but the butter and the lemon and it was very well balanced and tasty. I blanched the broccoli for 3.5 minutes.

I normally don't write reviews, but I LOVE this.  Great easy weekday dish.  Since we had double the broccoli than the recipe called for I switched it up a bit.  I used 1 Tbl butter and a 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 Tbl lemon juice, 1 Tbl zest and 1/2 cup of Almonds (I love crunch!).  It was so amazing.  This is without a doubt a new staple in our weekday menu.

Tried this last night with the modifications that others had mentioned - less lemon juice, no zest and toasted the almonds. It was very good and a great way to jazz up broccoli.

This was a nice change from the usual as far as cooked broccoli goes. I love it plain with maybe just a little pepper and garlic and a sprinkle of Parmesan, but I liked this recipe fairly well. I'll definitely make this again. I simplified it a bit though. I used three tablespoons of low-calorie butter spread, and about a tablespoon of lemon juice (I skipped the zest), and I toasted the almond slices. I just cooked the broccoli, then threw all my ingredients in and stirred. Very nice recipe!

I am really not big on broccoli because it has sort of a metallic or burnt taste. I can't really describe it but its just a normal broccoli taste, but this was great!! It did not have that taste at all, just a fresh broccoli taste. I think the lemon cut it or something but we will definitely eat this again and alot. Thanks so much. You have got a fan!!

Was a nice way to serve broccoli. I did toast my almonds (which I crushed) on a pan, then added 3 TBL butter and 1/2 lemon and then did the rest as originally state. Didn't get any accolades, but didn't get any complaints from the usual complainers either.

I only gave it 4 because I did a few things different.  First thing I did was I lightly roasted the almonds in a pan until fragrant.  And I used less lemon juice and a bit more lemon zest.  This was so good, light tasting, even with the butter and very refreshing.  Thank you for sharing.  I recommend toasting the almonds.

I made this for a large family gathering and it was delicious! However, I did as was recommended by other reviewers and cut the lemon juice to about 1/2 what the recipe calls for. Also, I put the butter and almonds in a pan and browned them a little. This is definitely a keeper for our family!

I followed the others' suggestions and halved the lemon juice and left out the lemon zest (which wasn't hard to do, considering I had no lemon zest and would have had to buy a lemon just for this purpose). 

This was WONDERFUL. Marvelous. Stupendous. A delight to the senses. Fantastic in every way. Will be making again and again, you can be sure. :-)

This was delicious and so easy. It was a great way to break up the monotony of regular green veggies, without to the heavy cheese & cream sauces so many other recipes call for!

I rated this 4 stars because I agree with some other reviewers that it is too lemony if fixed according to recipe, which is what I did.  I added some sea salt to help cut down the overpowering lemon taste.  Next time will cut the lemon juice down to 1 T. which should make this a 5 star recipe.  I did like it and will be fixing it again.  Thanks so much Sue for a quick, easy and tasty way to prepare broccoli.

Nice side dish.  Toasted the almonds, and used only 1 tbl lemon and no zest.  Added the almonds right before serving to keep them crunchy!

This is a good side dish.  The amount of butter recommended is a little scary; I made two bunches of broccoli and only used about 1 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil, and there was plenty of buttery taste and not as much fat.  Toasted almond slivers would have tasted much more robust than leaving them blanched - untoasted, they became lost.  I added probably double the amount of lemon and really enjoyed the lemon/butter combo.

Steaming is the best if you have a flavor essence area in your steamer you could put lemon zest or lemon juice in there to give it more of a lemon flavor.  
Nice change to Broccoli without all the calories of cheese sauces..

Very easy to prepare, but I found the lemon and butter overwhelming, and the almonds had a minimal effect on the flavor.  Might be better if the almonds simmered with the lemon and butter a bit longer.

Decent, like the almonds but I wont make it again.  THe butter adds to many calories w/ out making the flavor that much better and the lemon taste is to strong in the final product.

Ok, but too much lemon.  I recommend leaving out the zest and cutting lemon juice in half.  I used a bag of frozen broccoli florets.

Toasting the almonds in the butter brought out a more pronounced almond flavor.  I used far less lemon zest than the recipe called for and I was very happy with the butter to lemon ratio.  This is a very nice way to add a little zip to a healthy green veggie!

This was good but not great.  I thought it was a bit too lemon-y, even with less lemon juice, but my husband thought it was bland!  I might make it again, but it's not something I'll crave.

Quick, easy, and flavorful.  Neither the broccoli nor the lemon are overpowering.  The almonds sink to the bottom so you must make a point of scooping some out onto the broccoli.

I make this often.  Normally as the recipe calls for, but rarely measuring anything.  Sometimes will toast the almonds first.  Quick, easy and flavorful!

I was looking for an easy way to put some flavor into steamed broccoli, this was perfect. I had all the ingredients in the house, it was simple & delicious.  Now if only I could cook meat without the fire alarm going off!

I logged in for once to comment on how good this was. I cut the salt in half and it only needed 15 minutes. I took it out, tasted it without the lemon and it was so good I skipped that part. Amazingly delish. I will probably never steam broccoli again.

I made this salad for my sister while she came home on a holiday! This salad was an  instant hit. Just a simple addition was that I added tossed sesame seeds and the almonds were crushed to give it a nutty ending .

This is a really good way to make broccoli! Even my carnivore, carb-loading husband liked it. I don't have a way to zest a lemon so I just used the juice of half a lemon and I thought it was just lemony enough. And I could only find those salad almonds in the bag that are pre-roasted so I used them and it was fine. Seems like a no-brainer recipe!

The great thing about these recipes is that folks put them out there for critique and we get to tweak. 

I agree with reviewers. Half the lemon juice (I like the zest). Brown the almonds in 1 tsp. sugar in a saucepan then add the butter (you can reduce that, too, no more than half) and zest and toss with the cooked broccoli. Splash the lemon juice in at the end, bring quickly to temp., stirring, and serve.

Thank you for the recipe- pretty picture.

I brought this to an office potluck and although it was a little too lemony for my personal taste, others really liked it.  I used salad topper almonds that were already roasted and I think it added a nice flavor.  I think the next time I make it I will add the lemon seperately and make it more to my liking.

Simple and just the right amount of taste. (Not bland but not too flavorful) I followed other user's suggestions and did not include the zest and lessened the amount of lemon juice. It had just the right amount of lemon flavor, not too overpowering.

LOVE this side dish. What I did differently was cook the almonds with the butter to make them softer. I found it a little bit too lemon-y but I served it at a dinner party and several guests said they would prefer more lemon, I guess its all personal taste. Thanks for the recipe

This tasty recipe would be good with frozen peas or my family variation, frozen peas mixed with previously sauteed mushrooms and lightly toasted almonds.  Broccoli with Lemon Almond Butter would be an ideal easy side dish with a holiday turkey.  Thanks for this new recipe!

Thanks for posting this recipe, Sue.  I love broccoli and this recipe was something I had never tried before and really loved it.  The only things I did differently to the recipe was to cut back the butter to 1.5 tbsp and reduced the almonds to 2 tbsp.  Great with beef dishes.  This is going to be a staple for me.

I didn't think the sauce was too lemony as some previous reviewers have said, I thought it tasted just right. I did wish it had a little more body to it though. I'm not sure how it would be accomplished, but I wanted more on my broccoli instead of in the bottom of the dish.

Great flavor, very easy, will definitely make again and again!  I used frozen broccoli and steamed.  I toasted the almonds on a cookie sheet in the oven.  Instead of getting another pot dirty I just added the butter, lemon and almonds directly to the serving dish.  Delicious flavor!  And soo easy.  Thanks!

I thought this was awful.  Lemon flavor did nothing for the broccoli.  Maybe personal preference, but will not make again.  Thanks anyway....

My husband thought it was good...i might like it better with a little less lemon...the almonds (I used toasted) were a nice touch.

Such Great Flavour!  Our little family really enjoyed this.  I didn't have a fresh lemon on hand,so I used bottled lemon juice and decreased the amount to 1 1/4 tbsp, because bottled is much more tart then fresh.  I'm so thrilled to have a new way to prepare broccoli!! Thanks Sue.

I loooooved the lemon in this recipe!!  I think I actually put in more lemon juice than it said (I used the whole lemon).  For the butter, I made my own by pouring whipping cream into the food processer, then turned it on and let it spin for a few minutes until it was yellow and "chunky", then squeezed out the milk from it.  Tastes great!  Anyway, I agree with the others that something should be done with the almonds so that you can actually taste them.

What an easy and versatile recipe.  I wanted to serve a vegetable to compliment "Lemony Steamed Fish". Didn't have fresh broccoli. I used frozen California veggies (brocolli/cauliflower/carrots)as well as asparagus.  What a wonderfully light and fresh tasting vegetable!!  So Easy that children could help.

Very good.   On the amount of lemon juice, I think it depends on how large your broccoli is.  I mix the juice and butter together to get the taste right.  Then it will work out fine

I will make it again. The toasted almonds really makes the best finishing touch.

I was looking for a quick broccoli side last night and stumbled upon this. I didn’t have a lemon or almonds, only butter, lemon juice and frozen broccoli. But I figured... I’ll try it without it. Followed everything else in the recipe. Added salt & pepper to taste... pretty good. I’m sure it’ll be better with the zest & almonds.

i also cook my green beans this way!  Great and easy recipe!

This went great with pork chops and I can see this being a regular at the table.  It has a nice bright flavor with a nice crunch fro the almonds.

I feel that this was really a fun and quirky dish to make.  It pairs perfectly with 2 all beef franks.  I felt that a touch of "Tracy Steak Sauce"--the perfect compliment to any meal--really does the trick.  Thank you for the recommendation Fred Franzia!!

I also added some garlic powder, but I think this would've be delicious either way. A little sauce goes a long way... I prefer to still taste the vegetable, and this sauce adds a nice subtle lemon and a nice texture contrast with (toasted) almonds.

I really liked this dish, and while others have said it
was too lemony, I didn't think so at all. Followed the
recipe to a tee, other than adding 1/2 tsp. of garlic
salt and 1/4 tsp. of lemon pepper. This sauce goes
good with green beans too, but I think I like it better
with the broccoli. 5 stars and highly recommended!

I thought this tasted great! I toasted the almonds, squeezed in 1/2 of a fresh lemon and didn't use any lemon zest. I also added some fresh minced garlic. It was really good, I will definitely make this again.

Delicious, really perked up the broccoli.  I didn't bother with the lemon zest and I didn't have almonds, but it was still really good.  Even my picky 7 yr old cleaned his plate.

Good, fast and easy recipe for broccoli. I accidentaly doubled the butter, so had to double the lemon too.  Wasted a lot of the sauce this way, but I put some of it on pasta.  Went great with salmon.

I followed the recipe as is - and found the broccoli to be a little too tart for my taste. The lemon juice really overpowered the dish...it could do with a lot less. Perhaps just the zest. I also think the almonds would have been better toasted rather than blanched. A little on the tasteless/soggy side. I would not want to make this recipe again as written.

This was good.  The only changes I made were to leave out the zest and to toast my slivered almonds (I didn't measure, but it was a 2 oz bag of almonds)My two kids picked out the almonds and my husband said the almonds tasted like peanut butter, but I liked the toasted flavor with the broccoli.

The only way I can really describe this is good but forgettable.  I do like the almonds with the broccoli.  This is something I'd make if I were trying to be healthy but not if I were trying to impress company.

This was so easy and delicious!  I served it with Baked Soy Lemon Chops, also from allrecipes.

Thanks for sharing!

Easy way to dress-up a vegetable side dish. Almonds add a nice texture.

My husband and I loved the almonds, but the lemon was a little odd.  Went great with the pesto salmon and potato pouches.

I wouldn't make it again.  The lemon really added no flavor - the ratio of lemon to butter was off.  And the almonds just turned mushy though I didn't add them til right at the end.

I tried this recipe because I'm trying to eat healthier, but I hate the taste of broccoli. This did wonderfully for covering up that flavor, but like a few others have said, I found the lemon flavor a bit too much. The almonds, though, were a nice touch to what I see an otherwise boring veggie. I used frozen broccoli (steamed), but left out the lemon zest. I also took someone else's suggestion and toasted the almonds.

Good flavor, even though we didn't have the almonds!  Great if you like lemon, or enjoy a bit of tartness.

Yummy combo of flavors. I served it with Garlic Chicken which was a wonderful pairing. Definitely toast the almonds or brown them in the butter before mixing everything together.

The brocoli flavor was completely overpowered by the lemon flavoring. I would have liked it better with just the butter and almonds.  May try it again that way.

This is a very good recipe.  The combination on flavors is incredible.  It even converted my two "green-beans-are-the only-green-veggie-I'll-eat" kids!  I am impressed. Five stars plus.  Broccoli is a Super Food Rx.

Great way to do broccoli! I toasted the almonds first, which was a really important suggestion. And as for amount of lemon to use (other reviewers thought it was too lemony) I used 1/3 of a lemon, and it was just right. Will keep this recipe handy. Thanks!

This is a great side dish!  I toasted the almonds before adding them to the sauce - toasting really brings out the flavour of the almonds.  Next time I make this dish, I will only add one tablespoon of lemon juice though as we found the lemon flavour really overpowered all the other flavours.

I'm not a big fan of broccoli, but I loved this recipe.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, loves broccoli and thought it was too lemony.  So that averages out to 4 stars.  I will definitely make this again, maybe with a bit less lemon juice.

I have made this many times and continue to love it.  I add the juice from half of a fresh lemon in addition to the lemon juice to add an extra kick.  Otherwise it can be a little bland.

Something different. Don't know if I would prepare this again. Had to add seasoning salt and black pepper, otherwise it was too lemony.

I expected that much butter would stand out more, flavor-wise.  Instead all I seemed to taste was the lemon.  It was good but not great.

Very easy, pretty good.  Only needed half of the almonds noted.
