This is a wonderfully amazing pie!  A happy medium between pecan pie and pumpkin pie.  I used my own georgia candy roaster squash for the pumpkin and increased the amount to 1 1/2 cups because it isn't as compressed as canned pumpkin.  Could probably cut back a little on the sugar when using this.  I used white corn syrup instead and  added about 2 tablespoons of sorghum molasses. Used a deep dish pie and took much longer than 40 minutes to bake correctly.  Increase to about 50 minutes and then check with a knife.  Did not make the spiced whipping cream, but did use a little cool whip.  Everyone in my family that tried it loved it.  Especially great warm.

I'm giving this a 3 as of right now because I haven't tasted it yet, but this did not fit a 9 inch pie pan. Once I realized it, it was too little too late. It still looks amazing, and I can't wait to dig in!
