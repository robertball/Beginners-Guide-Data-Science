I have made this at least ten times now, it's one of our favorites at home. I add more vegetables though, like broccoli, corn, carrots, squash, and peas. I saute the chicken and brown the onion a little before adding it to the other ingredients.  I don't think I've ever had a tastier dumpling. The trick is to keep them small so that they cook all the way through. Warm fluffy goodness...mmmmm!

I made this recipe exactly as shown.  All the ingredients are items you would have on hand.  My husband and I both loved it. Definitely would make again and again.

This recipe was so yummy!!  Even my picky 1 1/2 year old loved it.  Only thing I did different was not to add the thyme and adding a little bit of garlic powder to the chicken/stock mixture and then also to the dumplings.  Will definately make again!

I've made this a few times with whole wheat flour dumplings. You can't even taste the carrots.  It turned out quite tasty, although I needed to use more liquid to make sure the dumplings were covered.

recipe is a little bland, and i found the dumpling directions a bit vague, though it was my first time making dumplings. my dumplings spread out all over the soup and came out to be un-dumplings. I think this is an ok recipe to be creative on top of.

It would have been better but don't add the flour until you are done with the dumplings because the flour will burn otherwise.

Very good! I didn't use the dumpling recipe here, I used one that didn't have carrots in the mixture, as well as I used a vary of different vegetables, but it was hearty and tasted great. I did however notice something another viewer said which was that the flour mixture in the sauce burned to the bottom when steaming the dumplings, I will take care to add that mixture in after the dumplings are finished cooking next time, thanks!

This is a dish that I have been making for years. The quickie version calls for canned condensed cream of chicken soup.  I like this old fashioned homemade version better. The only thing I do differently is I make the dumplings from bisquick (follow directions on box for bisquits and spoon-drop them in instead of baking).  I have added peas to this a couple of times and once I added asparagus tips which was very good, as well.  This is a nice family style recipe that you can be proud to serve.

This was good except the dumplings did not turn out very well for some reason. I will try again!

I used the dumplings from this recipe for a different stew, and man, were they great!  Really made the meal.
