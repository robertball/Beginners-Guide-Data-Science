I subbed quinoa for the rice (still used rice flour) and honey for the sugar. Added raisins and walnuts to mine and chocolate chips to my boys' once they were in the pan. They came out a bit too moist on the bottom, and stuck to the wrapper, so I need to work on adjusting the other ingredients (maybe less applesauce?) to get a more muffin-y texture. But the taste is DELICIOUS! I just went GF and was craving something "bready".

I used 1/4 cup honey instead of the sugar.  It took a while to get used to the rice flour taste, but these are good.  I love the smell of these!

Decent, but a bit dry.  I used brown rice flour, so I will likely try again with white rice flour to see if that makes a difference.
