Wow! Pleasantly surprised! Neither MrB or I are huge meringue fans (which explains why I'm not great at making it), but we both really loved this. No egginess! The crispy meringue blends beautifully with the soft, gooey caramel and bananas and the fluffy whipped cream. YUM. I served this a little differently because there were just 3 of us and I didn't want the leftover meringue to get soggy. I cut the meringue into pie slices, spooned the bananas and caramel on each slice, and then topped with whipped cream and chopped chocolate. Oh boy. Straight to my fanny. :) Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!!!  This was my first experience with pavlova, and before I tried it I thought that the meringue part would be just kind of tasteless, but to those of you who don't know like I didn't, it is a rich, warm, toasty, delicious flavor!  Combined with the caramel and bananas, it becomes something absolutely fabulous that is sure to impress all guests!  I just made this for my family today, but next time we have guests over, I am making this! Thanks Trish, love it!

Doubled the recipe and made a three-tier torte with whip cream and bananas spread between layers and on top. Topped with more whipped cream, and instead of the chocolate chips and caramel, I crushed up chocolate toffee Heath Bar and sprinkled it over the top of the torte. This was really delicious! This can also be made with strawberries, blueberries, or raspberries and chocolate.

This was very good, although not very pretty because mine collapsed, probably from cooling too quickly.  Next time I will let it cool for an hour with the oven door completely shut.

As with other reviewers, this was my first try at making a Pavlova! What a great recipe to pick! I made 6 indidividual servings for a dinner party and the only one to not eat the whole thing was my hubby (he hates merengue!) but he greedily ate the rest of it! ;) The merengues were a bit of a pain to mold (more than likely the operator here...) but they setup nicely, I did them 2 days before and with stric instructions from the creator, they kept well until I filled the day of my party...thanks Trishie for the awesome recipe! and sorry I have no pics.. ;(

I've made both pavlova, and banoffee pie many times b4, and the combination of both was a huuuge hit with my family! I was sooo worried abt getting an eggy taste which sometimes happens with meringues, and also because I tasted the pieces that I trimmed from the edges of this one to fit into the plate, and after an hour or so, started having that eggy smell to them. I don't know why that happens! However, The dessert itself was wonderful with no egginess whatsoever! I did cut down the sugar to 3/4 of a cup, because a whole cup seemed wayy to sweet. I am glad I did, it was perfect like that! Also, I used regular white vinegar, and worked just fine. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

This is my recipe and I need to correct the steps in this recipe as published by AR:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and trace an 8 inch circle onto the surface.

2. In a metal or glass bowl whip the egg whites and salt until soft peaks form. (The salt helps break down the “stickiness” of the egg whites)


3. Gradually by tablespoon add the sugar while continuing beating until the mixture is stiff and shiny

4. Sprinkle the cornstarch & cream of tartar over the mixture add the vanilla and white wine vinegar and mix in for a further minute.

5. Mound the mixture into the traced circle on the baking sheet. Flatten the top and smooth the sides using a spatula.

6. Place in the preheated oven, and immediately reduce the heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until a pale golden brown. Turn off the oven, and leave the door slightly ajar with the pavlova inside until completely cooled.

7. Just before serving time, invert the cooled pavlova onto a serving plate, and top with slices of banana. Cover banana with caramel sauce. Top that with whipped cream and sprinkle with grated chocolate.
 

It should also mention in the ingredient list that the eggs should be at room temperature (this maximises the eggs whites’ ability to whip up properly) 

Its also normal for the "meringue to crack" once cooled but when you have the toppings on you wont even notice!

Thanks for trying my recipe!

This was my first try at Pavlova.  My first meringue shell was o.k. I thought I could do better and I was right.  I followed the directions exactly, using room temp egg whites and they whipped to great volumes.  My problem was with forming the shell.  After doing a little research, I only spread the egg whites to within an inch of the circle lines and baked as directed.  This turned out great.  The first one I baked, I spread out the full diameter of the circle, upon baking it expanded and made a flatter shell that cracked alot.  Once you get this part done, it is so easy to complete.  This is fabulous!!  Very sweet but oh so good!!  It looked absolutley beautiful on the serving plate.  Next time I will add more bananas because we love bananas and they go so well with this.  There were no leftovers.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Without a doubt, the easiest, tastiest, most impressive dessert I've ever made. If there was an option for 10 stars, this would be the recipe that would be the most deserving. When speaking to the author of this recipe the other day, she encouraged me to follow these simple steps of, mixing the salt with ROOM TEMPERATURE egg whites prior to following the remaining steps. She knew what she was talking about. Only change I made was using regular white vinegar rather than the white wine vinegar. Didn't seem to make much difference. Highly recommend this for anything you need an impressive dessert for.

This was soooo good.  My coworkers are still talking about it 4 hours later.  I made the bottom the day before and just "dressed" it this morning before work.  I heard the words "Melt in your mouth" more than once.

I prefer pavlova with more fruit and less sugary adds like caramel from a jar and chocolate.  Next time I would leave off the caramel altogether, or make my own from scratch.. too sweet from a jar.  As a side note, regular white vinegar is just fine.. I've never used white wine vinegar and I've made dozens of Pavlova's.

I have prepared dozens of dessert/sweets recipes from this site. This is the ONE! This is definately one of our favorites!! I love Pavlova and this is the best I have ever had. The flavors and textures are perfect and if you follow Trishie's (recipe author) review, you will serve a perfect dessert to your family and friends. Hubby and kids were coming in at different times tonight so I cut each 
serving as needed and then topped with bananas, caramel sauce, whipped cream and shaved semi sweet chocolate. Everyone came back for  seconds. (Probably because I served small servings to begin with so there would be more left over for me! :) Trishie, thank you for sharing your perfect Banoffee Pavlova. We will enjoy it often.

Excellent!  Made this for an Easter dessert.  I doubled the recipe, kept it mounded in the center - it flattened nicely on its own.  It's a bit of a "messy" looking dessert, but scoops nicely with a spoon, and in a group of 14 there were no leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!

easy, tasty, 8 thumbs up from around the table. I set it in a large pie plate lined with foil, baked it 55 minutes and it was delicious. Also used room temperature eggs as they whip up better. The family is making many recommendations to alter the fillings for this. Looks like I will be buying alot of eggs-thanks Trishie-great recipe, going to try the Black Forest Pavlova next:)

I didn't make the pavlova part of this recipe because I started making a different pavlova recipe on this site.  But after it finished baking, and turned out the perfect light shade of brown with just the right texture, I changed my mind about doing the cream and berry topping like I had originally planned.  I came across this recipe and had perfectly ripe bananas in my pantry and caramel sauce in the fridge.  The only drawback - a daughter who hates bananas, but loves pavlova.  So, the family took a vote, and bananas beat berries.  I promised her that even she would like this with all of the caramel, cream and chocolate, she wouldn't even taste the bananas.  I served and she poked at it and then tasted it.  Not much later, I was finishing my piece when I noticed her at the counter cutting herself another piece - yeah - it's just that good that a banana hater will have seconds.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!

I'm sorry; I can't talk right now.  I'm still dreaming about how delicious and beautiful this was . . . in all seriousness, though, this was amazing--everyone loved it.  I made my own whipped cream because I hate Cool Whip, and I used milk chocolate because I prefer it.  I also couldn't find superfine sugar, so I used regular granulated.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly with no problems.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

I made this for today's dessert.  I used bananas and pears which was a nice contrast in tastes.  My sister said she wants this for her birthday but with strawberries and chocolate sauce.  I made my own caramel sauce (1 stick butter, 1 c. sugar and 1 1/4 cups evaporated milk) and it was really really good.  Very light after a meal of black eyed peas, turnip greens and cornbead.  Judy

I was very nervous about my first attempt making pavlova but it turned out beautifully!  This was a fabulous combination and my company raved about how beautiful and yummy it was.  I was nervous about the meringue because when it came out of the oven the outer part was rock hard and on the underside of the pavlova it had caved upwards, but somehow once I put everything together and served it it was perfect and delicious.  I wanted to mention that in case someone else has the same experience and gets nervous about how it will turn out like I did.  I will make this again, for sure.  Thank you Trishie for a wonderful and unique recipe!!!

I'm so glad I chanced upon this recipe. Baked it for our Christmas dinner and it was a hit. I didn't have caramel ice cream topping at the time and decided to make my own caramel syrup (sugar, butter and whipped cream) and liked it. Goes well with the sweetness of the meringue and the banana. Will be making this again!

Delicious, served this at a ladies luncheon.  It didn't cut well as I put the whipped cream on two hours before.  I would do this 4 or 5 hours before because that evening i cut perfectly. The taste was wonderful.

Wonderful!  I needed a recipe to take to a friends house but it had to be gluten and dairy free.  I used the base of this recipe and topped the Pavolva with fresh strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  It melts in your mouth!  Thanks Trishie:)

This was yummy! As my family does not like bananas,I topped it with a thin layer of whipped cream and summer berries instead. Will be made again, a keeper!

This has become a family favorite and is so easy.  Great to make for company because it looks like you slaved all day!  I have been making it for awhile with great success.  Today I did not have a clean glass bowl, so used a plastic bowl.  DO NOT TRY IT!  When it says use metal or glass, it is true!  So-I did have to switch over to a glass bowl to get my meringue stiff enough but it still turned out fine.

I forgot to turn the oven temperature down to 300 and I didn't realize it until it had been in the oven for an hour.  I turned the oven off immediately, cracked the door until cool, and it STILL came out great.  Perfect color, crispy outside and soft inside. I used regular granulated sugar and it was great.  Will definitely make again, but next time, I will make it when guests are over, this is way too much for just me and hub.   So I will over eat, and my diet will be out the door for today!!  I shall start again Monday morning!  Thank the Lord for making each day a new beginning : )

SWEET! A friend & I made this... tasty, definitely. We triple 'dashed' the vanilla (never too much vanilla), and did do room-temp whites (it does make a difference). We just blended regular sugar in a magic bullet - instantly superfine! The thicker of a round you mound, the better - next time I may make individual serving rounds...  As for the caramel... since we had 2 hours' free time, we made the caramel from scratch. I'm terrible with caramel, so I used a fairly fool-proof recipe. DELICIOUS and thick - you'll have leftover caramel too, use it on banana pancakes or french toast tomorrow. SO much better than a jar of artificial topping.  Not to sound hypocritical... but we overchurned the cream into butter so we used Cool Whip Light. It helped balance how heavy the caramel flavor was. It was indulgent, and hard to stop eating. Two thumbs up!

This is a delicious and easy recipe and a great way to use those leftover egg whites.  I love the mix of textures.  I made a fresh orange whipped cream and topped it with strawberries, mangos, peaches and pineapple. WOW! This will be a huge hit with anyone who tries it!

Absolutely fabulous.  Word of warning though - it's so light that it goes down extra easy and doesn't make you feel sickeningly full so you'll want to have a couple pieces!  Be sure to put the whip cream on top of the pavlova and then add the toppings - much prettier and won't collapse the meringue.    P.S.  I added toasted coconut to the top and it was fabulous.

Wow! Talk about impressive! This looks like something you'd buy from an upscale bakery.  And to think... I made it! The boyfriend went ga-ga over it - he loves banana and caramel together.  The only thing I may do differently next time would be to slightly cut back on the amount of caramel topping; I loved it, but I think I'd love it even more with less.  I made homemade whipped cream from this site, also for the first time and that made this so much better than Cool Whip.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  I'll definitely be making this again!

The pavlova tastes just like what my Irish aunt used to make when I was a kid! This was really unusual when I brought it to a party - got asked for the recipe a lot - I've made it twice in the last month already, and currently have eggs coming to room temp for another batch tonight!

This was beyond awesome! The textures of this dessert totlly intrigued me as well as my dinner party guests! The crispy outer shell was melt away (literally) good, with such a yummy marshmallow center! I found out after the party that a girl who does not like bananas, ate it and really liked it!

Tried this and loved the banoffee part but hate the meingue. The recipe worked wonderfully but no one in my family likes the meringue shell. Will probably try again with a puff pastry shell instead.

Made by 11 year old son. Kids LOVED It.  It was a bit too sweet for the adults, but that could be adjusted next time.  We made our own caramel sauce from another allrecipes post.  My daughter would rate it more stars if she could!

Awesome! It was my first pavlova and we devoured it! I used white vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar and it was fine. I also made homemade caramel rather than using jarred stuff. Yum!!! Will definitely make again!

Made it for the SuperBowl.  Super easy with a kitchenaid to do the majority of the work.  Mine actually sat for about 1.5 hours before being eaten and I liked how the flavors came together more at that point.

WOW...AWESOME...DELICIOUS.   That's just the beginning. I'd never tried Pavlova before and I was not disappointed in this recipe at all.  I made it for a holiday party and everyone raved over it.  It's unsual ...it's fun to make and scrumptious to eat. It's been saved and we'll enjoy it again!  Thanks Trish for sharing your recipe.

This is an exquisite dessert! It looks like huge work but is not. You can whip the cream, make the caramel sauce and the pavlova the day before serving.
 I used Chef John’s Caramel Sauce recipe (easy) because the commercial stuff is loaded with undesirable ingredients and omitted the chocolate. 
Be sure to use very very ripe bananas.

The best thing I have ever tasted. I left out the cream of tartar (it didn't need it) and I did make my own caramel sauce (instead of the store bought) to which I added some Kentucky bourbon, and I made my own whipped cream so I could keep that part of it less sweet, since the caramel and bananas under it are so sweet. I think it would be great just as written, too. Everyone LOVED it. Spectacular!

My first attempt at either a meringue or pavlova. I followed the directions. My husband loves meringue and was not disappointed!! The only change I made was I made individual pavlovas in 2.5" circles. I didn't realize that they retain their shape. Next time, I would flatten the tops, I couldn't bring myself to invert them, they were so pretty ( shaped like a Hershey's kiss). So good! Thanks for the recipie!

I made this for a dinner party. It was a huge hit! I used a can of sweetened condensed milk (boiled in water for 3 hours to make a caramel). I had never tried making any type of meringue before but it came out great. I didn't bother tracing a circle on the parchment paper, I just eye-balled it and it came out to be around 12" around. Also, I baked it at about 200 degrees not 300, which I think would have cooked it too quickly. I didn't have castor sugar so I just blended regular sugar in a food processor until fine. This came out super rich but my husband went back for seconds. Also, I tried making just a regular banoffee in a pie crust. It doesn't compare. The pavlova MAKES the recipe. I will be making the more traditional fruit pavlova in my next attempt.

After seeing this recommended on the recipe exchange here at AR several times, I finally decided to go ahead and try it.  Oh my goodness, this is SO good!!  I'm not a huge fan of meringue or caramel, but they just "work" in this recipe!  I didn't have any chocolate to shave, so I used mini chocolate chips instead.  I will absolutely make this again and again and again!  Thanks for a great dessert, Trish!!

This was my first time ever having Banoffee Pavlova and I have to say Wow! I loved the flavors of this. I think next time I make it I will cut the sugar though cause both me and my son are sugar wimps and we both wanted more and were a little sad we couldn't keep eating more like everyone else! Thank you for this recipe!
