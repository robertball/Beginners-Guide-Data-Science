I made a smoothie like this when I was pregnant with both my boys, to make sure that I got more fruits/veggies into my diet. I would add half a frozen banana and a handful of frozen berries, too. I never used sweetener in my smoothies, but I know there are people who like things a little sweeter. 

Super good. And, you totally can't tell it's got zucchini! Give it a try!

Very good! Couldn't taste the zucchini at all. Made a few changes tho': added one banana, used half mandarin/half orange juice, used honey instead of the other sweetener. I also used a bit of green powder(smoothie lacks protein & I didn't think regular protein powder would taste well), I wouldn't recommend it for people who are new to it--it's definitely an acquired taste. Also, I wouldn't add the vanilla extract next time--it wasn't a bad addition, I just felt it didn't need it. This smoothie is great, talk about getting at least 2 servings of veggies & 2 servings of fruit(if you add the banana). I'll definitely make this again.

This was such a strange concept I had to try it and actually, to my surprise, it wasn't bad at all! I even cut the Splenda by half.

This recipe is excellent. I put zucchini in my garden for the first time this year because I wanted zucchini bread, but I thought that was the only way I would eat zucchini because mom used to serve to to us kids plain (and we hated it). I have gotten so much zucchini from two plants, I've been looking for good ways to use it besides in the bread. These smoothies are a good way...My kids can't get enough of them! I've put frozen peach and frozen pineapple into the mix, and I've used regular sugar and honey because nobody in my house is  really dieting. I also took out the seeds from the zucchini and peeled it thoroughly. 4 stars for taste, and 5 stars for using the oft-unloved zucchini in a way that is delicious and nutritious.

Followed directions exactly, well mostly but i only have splenda packets and used 2 of those, not sure if its 2 tbsp or not though. Well anyways this recipe was VERY VERY DELICIOUS! it was a little thin but i just added a coup;e more ice cubes and it was fine. next time i will add 1/2 a banana like some reviews said and omit the sweetener. i think i may have added a little more zucchini than called for but it still tasted really delish!......  word of advice; when drank awhile after it is made it doesn't taste quite as good since the flavors tend to separate....but it hardly last that long so no worries!EDIT!!! tried without sweetener and still very very good. Also tried with 1/2 frozen banana and freezed the zucchini, my favorite way was with freezing the ingredients since it came out much more refreshing and more smoothie like in consistency! overall it was wonderful and i recommend for every1 to try.

Awesome.  Somebody else said they taste like Orange Julius and I totally agree.  They were a bit liquidy for my taste, but I just added in some vanilla yogurt to get the texture I wanted.  Fabulous recipe.

I even added half a banana, but still the zucchini taste was overpowering everything else... I didn't like it very much.

I like this recipe, but I feel that I made it taste better.  I did not use sugar or vanilla extract.  Instead I added a banana and 2 figs.  Delicious!  The fig just adds a bit of sweetness.

Quite good!  I left out the sweetner and it was sweet enough with the orange juice.

It tastes just like an orange julius!  But it's lactose free as well as a lot healthier.  I really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Good recipe.  If you're making something healthy, either leave out the sweetener and use a little extra sweet fruit or substitute stevia for the artificial sweetener.

This was really good. It was a bit watery though, next time I'm going to try adding some plain fat free yogurt to help thicken it up.

Tastes great. Yet I'd add more honey to make it richer.

Made it exactly as written with the exception of 6 ice cubes instead of 5. Loved it. I think tomorrow morning I'll try it with an apple in it and 1/2 the sweetener (I used agave). I might bump the ice cubes up to 8 and use the milkshake speed instead of the smoothy speed on my blendtec. Very versatile recipe. A great way to use up some of those zucchini that seem to take over this time of year.

Wow.  I wish I could give this 6 stars!!  I subbed the sweetener for agave syrup (personal choice) but followed as written otherwise.  The taste is fantastic and no overpowering zucchini taste.  It truly deserves the adjective "amazing" in the title.  Thanks Janie for such a healthy/yummy smoothie!

I threw in a banana, some supplements and left out the sugar. I was unsure if I would like it because it came out a weird color (LOL) but it turned out to be very good, and the perfect amount of sweet! I am very happy with it, and would make it again!

Yummy, I added Silken Tofu and made it just a touch creamier.
