A local restaurant makes a similar sandwhich that I crave often. It has Nutella, PB and marshmallow creme toasted between white bread. It's sort of like a s'mores without the campfire. Delicious!

Delicious! To make it healthier, I used 1 tbsp natural PB, 1 1/2 tsp mini choc chips (I know that's quite a cut in amount but I'm watching my calories & the choc flavor still came through nicely!) & sprayed whole wheat bread with butter spray so thereby omitted the margarine. I baked the sandwich at 375 for 5 min, then flipped it & baked for another 3-4 min. It was a great treat w/ some fiber & protein-plus a little chocolate for kicks! Thanks for sharing!

Oh Jill, Jill, Jill....do I like you or hate you for submitting this terrific little treat? I went all out and used butter in lieu of the margarine and even added some nutella to this already wonderful, rich and very satisfying sandwich. Anyone who loves peanut butter as much as I has to be O.K., therefore, I say thanks for this yummy recipe!

My hubby and I used to make a similar sandwich all the time!  We would make two pieces of toast (prefer whole-wheat) and when it was done, immdediately press half (or a whole) Hershey's milk chocolate bar onto one piece of toast (the kind you would use for S'mores).  On the other piece of toast, spread peanut butter, then immediately press the two pieces together.  The heat of the toast will melt the chocolate, and you don't have to mess with grilling it on the stove!

When I make these, I use honey roasted peanut butter and a good-quality dark chocolate bar. It's astounding--save it for a kitschy dessert. Sprinkle a little powdered sugar on top to add to the delicious mess factor.

A wonderful and easy to make treat! Instead of the margarine, I sprayed the bread with butter flavored cooking spray and cooked on low heat until it started to get brown.

Nice sandwich. I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. I was craving something sweet and this hit the spot. I would definately eat this again.

Oh Lordy! This recipe is delicious! I thought it might be too rich for my taste but as soon as I tasted the first bite, it was Heavenly!
The one and only difference I made was I used milk chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet because that was all I had on hand.
Thank you for sharing this gorgeous recipe!

My 3, 6, and 10 year old kids LOVED this!  One didn't like the marshmallows, but after removing them he devoured it.  I asked my 10 year old how many stars he'd give it and he said "5 million!"

This was very good!. I happened to find this in my e-mail notifications from Allrecipes and knew I had everything on hand to make it.
I did and it was very tasty and easy to prepare. Like others I also used milk chocolate chips. I might try a bananna as others sugggested next time because I am sure there will be a next time. 
I can't wait to make this for my nieces and nephews. It's great with a cold glass of milk!! Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but I prefer to use Nutella in place of the chocolate chips.  I think it's a better flavor.  We will often put PB and Nutella on english muffins for a quick breakfast.  The kids love to think they are eating peanut butter cups for breakfast :)

I didn't think these were overly fantastic but my daughter seemed to like them.  I think she even made them for breakfast one day.  It is a good way to get that chocolate fix when chips are the only thing you've got in the house.

Huge success! I made this for my children for a treat and followed the recipe with one exception: I used whole wheat bread instead of white. My kids loved it! We will definitely make this again!

I was naughty today & tried this (with 2 other pb sandwich recipes for lunch...I just made small ones or each); it was VERY good!  I made it on sourdough bread with milk chocolate chips, which was decent, but on the other half I added some cinnamon & it was great.

I did this on the George Foreman machine to make a good little panini. No need to even use the margarine when it is done this way. I did not have the chocolate chips, so I spread on some hot fudge instead. The kids loved it. All I got out of them was one bite. No one was willing to share!

So good! I took the advice of one review and used cooking spray instead of margarine, whole wheat bread, and natural peanut butter. I also used dark chocolate chips. It was still super sweet and delicious! I'll definitely be making it again! :)

I LOVE the combo of chocolate and peanut butter and thought this was gonna be perfect, but it just wasn't as I'd hoped. I mean, it was OK, but just not something I would have to have. I guess maybe I had higher hopes for it or something. The concept is great, I just wasn't wowed by it. Thanks for sharing though!

What a quick and easy sweet treat! But I am only giving it four stars because for some odd reason I wasn't totally pleased with the taste of the semi-sweet chocolate in this. I will use milk chocolate next time. Thanks for the great idea!

This is a great sweet treat! I used wheat bread because that's all I had on hand, but I definately think white would be better.

I wish I had never discovered this recipe. It is so easy, so delicious, and completely irresistable! Murder on my diet! Also good made with white chocolate chips, very rich. I actually think this tastes better with white chocolate chips.

This was delicious and creamy!  We used a flax seed/whole wheat bread, and it was just amazing.

For some reason, I did not care for this recipe at all. The chocolate chip flavor was too strong and I even used less than the recipe asked for. Usually I love peanut butter/honey toast, and anything to do with chocolate, but after 2 bites I threw this away. Maybe I'm just weird! :]

This recipe was so so.  I actually did make it over a campfire in a pie iron--maybe there is something else I was supposed to do?  Not sure how much more could've been done.  The kids didn't care much for it and my son is an avid peanut butter/chocolate eater.  Won't make this again!

A huge hit with the kids. Perfect for camping. I used mini-choc chips so you weren't overloaded with chocolate.

This was good, nothing spectacular. A nice little snack. I used milk choc. chips because thats what I had, plus thats more like a peanut butter cup.

I used Alpine whole grain bread, all natural peanut butter, and 1 bittersweet chocolate square. I spinkled confectioner's sugar ontop. Because my peanut butter wasn't sweetened a teaspoon of powder sugar should have been added to it, which I will do next time. Mini marshmallows would be a great addition instead of the confectioner's sugar.

Yum! Simple and delicious. I just used a tablespoon each of peanut butter and chips and it was good.  I love the melty creamy texture and it really does taste like a peanut butter cup when it's all hot and gooey.

Who would've thought you could make a grilled "sandwich" with PB and chocolate! This is deffinitely my new official 'need-a-sugar-fix' treat- I wish I had thought of this! And this recipe actually took me about 4 minutes to prepare, grill, and eat. AWESOME!!!

Made this for my little guys breakfast this morning and what a treat!  We're PB lovers too Lin.  I wonder if marshmallow cream would be good in place of the chocolate.  What a fun breakfast Jill.  Thanks for sharing.

I can't believe I actually ate this.  We were talking about it and I couldn't resist trying it.  It was okay, but I think the bottom line is that I don't like grilled peanut butter sandwiches whether they have chocolate, jelly or bananas in them.

I really like this! I have a feeling this is going to be a new favorite snack of mine. I pretty much wolfed it down, followed by a tall, cold glass of milk. Thanks for sharing, Jill!

Loved it!! I think it is better if you cut the crust off. I ate it while it was still warm and it was all gooey and yummy! Thank you for this recipe. My kids will love it. This is a keeper for fun snacks and maybe even desserts for kids.

This is such a cute idea!  I loved the taste of this; what a great twist on a grilled cheese sandwich.  Next time I will wait a little bit before eating so the chocolate/peanut butter isn't hot and liquidy...but I just couldn't resist trying it right away.  This is a special treat; more like a dessert.  Thanks for this inventive sandwich!

I didn't really care for this.  However, my 6 year old thought it was the coolest that he had chocolate chips on a sandwich, and loved it!!!  So had to give it a high rating for being very kid friendly.

Yummy snack.  I'll have to try the marshmellow creme next time.  I wouldn't think of eating it for breakfast though - too sweet.
