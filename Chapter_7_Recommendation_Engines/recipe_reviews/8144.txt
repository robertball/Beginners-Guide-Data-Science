Absolutely incredible.  I have made the cake twice and both times I cut the recipe in half.  I also substitute applesauce for the butter in the dough and add lots of raisins and prepare the dough using a bread maker (use extra milk instead of the water and just throw the ingredients in the bread maker according to its directions - I do liquids, then dry ingredients, and yeast last).  For the filling I also use applesauce instead of butter but add a little at a time to get a nice pasty filling that I can spread.  Before I bake the bread, I add an egg white wash so that it comes out golden brown.  I can not believe how delicious this cake is without using any butter.  No one believes me that it isn't full of oil and butter.  My favorite recipe!!!

I am from New Orleans and find this to be a very authentic tasting recipe. I use my bread machine on the dough cycle thru step 3 and find it makes the recipe even easier.  It can also be filled with ready made pie fillings ie. lemon,cherry,apple which is another thing that is being done in New Orleans. Plastic babies can be gotten from party stores in the baby shower area.  thanks Jo!

I made this for a Mardi Gras Party in French class, and everyone loved it!  If you leave out the plastic baby, it also makes a great breakfast bread!  I get requests for it all the time.  Tip:  If making it for breakfast, make most of the roll the night before, and let it rise the second time overnight.  Then simply pop it in the oven the next morning, glaze, and Voila!  A delicious breakfast bread.  :-)

Better than bakeries! Living and eating in New Orleans for my entire life I was a bit skeptical if I could actually pull off a king cake.  I wanted to make mine a tad more traditional so I made the following modifications: 1. NO RAISINS in the filling- I have never (in my 20-something years of eating king cake) seen raisins in one.  I did make 1 and 1/2 times the filling too. 2. To first rise the dough I placed a mug of boiled water in the back of the microwave.  I then placed my covered bowl of dough in the Micro and shut the door for 2 hours.  The dough came out so fluffy.  I think this technique played a part in the pillowy softness and tender layers of the finished cake. 3. I opted for a elegant braided look.  Instead of just rolling the filling in a spiral I divided each rolled dough sheet into three sections.  I then scattered the filling on top and rolled those long pieces into mini-spirals.  I was then able to roll each segment out longer and finally braid the three sections together.  It looks so nice on a cross-section when sliced too! 4. I placed a ramekin in the center while the cake was rising the second time to prevent the middle of the cake from rising together- I wanted to keep the ring shape of it all. 5. Baked at 350 degrees for 27 minutes- worked perfect for my oven.  My general advice would be to bake until the top is evenly golden. 6. I ended up using the entire icing recipe on one of my cakes and I had to thin it with a bit more water than called for.

As a native Louisianaian, this is a great recipe with the following changes: 1) Leave out the raisens, 2)double the filling, 3)REDUCE the temperature to 335, and REDUCE the bake time to 27 minutes - the published time/temp will overbake, 4) generously brush the outside of the pastry with olive oil just before baking, 5)for the icing use 1 block of cream cheese, 1/2 stick butter, 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1/4 cup  milk, and add powdered suger to the consistancy you like.  5) For best results use unbleached & unbrominated all purpose flour. 6)To leave a nice hole in the middle, use a 4" diameter baking ring in the center.

raisins in king cake???? yuck!  and for those who are interested, there is much more to the story of the baby in the cake.  although now many anticipate the the finder will host the next party, it was originally used to bestow the honor of royalty for the mardi gras balls.

I made this last night for 15 hungry people at our poker night. I used the bread machine method (liquids first, then solids, with the yeast on top) and it worked great. For the filling I left out the raisins, and for the frosting I used milk instead of water in the powdered sugar and just eyeballed it; it was more like 4-5 tbsp milk instead of 2, making the consistency easy to pour over the cake. I made my own purple sugar, about 1/3 c sugar, 3 drops red food coloring, and 3 drops blue. If you do this I suggest mixing the food coloring together before adding it to the sugar, and it takes quite a bit of stirring to break up the colored bits, but it worked great. Tip: pour the colored sugar on RIGHT AFTER

I was on a hunt to find a great King Cake recipe this past Mardi Gras.  I made a dozen of these and everyone absolutely LOVED them.  It is the easiest recipe (as far as King Cakes go) and the most authentic I found.  I had people originally from New Orleans saying it tasted just like home!  I shaped mine into a circle without the cuts and slathered the icing and stripes of yellow, purple, and green sugar - I also sat my babies on the top so that there wasn't an accidental choking!

I baked this for a French party, and it was quite good. I recommend making just one cake (use a 16 x 20 rectangle of dough), but whatever you do, double the filling - it's the best part! Once you've spread the filling on the rolled-out dough, cut off the edges to make a a neat rectangle and so you don't have large doughy parts in the cake. It was great without the raisins. Try making the frosting more interesting by adding butter, sour cream, and vanilla.

Great recipe!  I iced it with a mixture of powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla, and used red and green sugar to decorate it, since we served it at an Epiphany party (Three Kings' Day).  It was a big hit.  And it was HUGE - served 40 people (20 adults, 20 children), not 16!  I have a whole extra king cake left over because the recipe made such a large one.  But I don't mind!

I also substituted a filling of cream cheese sweetened with a little powdered sugar.  Yum!

Yummy!  Especially good still slightly warm. Much better than the mail order one we got from the bakery in New Orleans. Will definitely make this one again next year.

I made the batter, let it rise, and formed it into the rings the night before, then put it in the 'fridge.  The next morning, I let it come to room temperature, rise, then baked them for the normal time.

Excellent king cake!  After I moved away from Louisiana, I found that no grocery stores carried king cakes during mardi gras or if they did.. they weren't too appetizing..  This cake is just like what I would get at home. The dough is spot in flavor. The filling is also delicious, although I omitted the raisins and pecans because I've never had that in king cake. I also used the cream cheese filling another user posted, which turned out great. The first time I made this, the frosting tasted a little off, but the second time I used 2 c. powdered sugar, 1 T butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 T milk, and it came out great.

The filling and frosting needed a little modification, but the dough is excellent, and that's the most important part!

P.S. if you like fruit filled king cakes, canned pie filling works great. Strawberry is my fave, but blueberry is pretty good too.

Pleasantly surprised!!  I knew I was going to use my bread machine, so I halved the recipe, so that it would fit.  I didn't use raisins in the filling.  I love raisins, but they have NO place in a king cake.  :)  The filling was really good, but it was a bit much.  If you're from South Louisiana, like me, and want a traditional cinnamon king cake, I would suggest using a mix of 1/3 c white sugar and 1 T. cinnamon (or 2/3 c sugar and 2 T. cinnamon if you make the full recipe).  And to me, king cake icing is equally, if not MORE important than the dough, so I am SO thankful to the reviewers who suggested using lemon juice to hide that funky taste that you get in powdered sugar.  I loved this icing recipe from one reviewer:  2 c. powdered sugar, 1 T. butter melted, 1 t. clear vanilla, 1 t. lemon juice, 3 T. milk (plus add extra milk as needed to get to the right consistency.)  It was PERFECT king cake icing.  The full recipe, will make 2 regular-size king cakes, which could serve 20-30, depending on how you slice it.

I've made it several times now, it always turns out fantastic.  To make life easier I just warm the milk in the microwave, mix all the wet ingredients together, mix all the dry ingredients together, and then combine the two in my bread machine.  I find to make the cake look extra spectacular, I twist the two roles of dough together, join the ends so I have one twisted loop, and let it rise, it always comes out of the oven looking fantastic!  Also for the filling I like to use a cream cheese based one, I just mix some powdered sugar, cinnamon, and milk with 8oz of cream cheese and spread that on the dough before I role it up!

Gave this 4 stars because I changed the recipe so much.  Took other reviewers advice and cooked for about 25 mins on 335.  It came out perfect!  Also left out raisins and nuts.  I made a strawberry cream cheese filling instead.  I also made the icing with milk and vanilla instead of water.  The cakes got rave reviews from everyone!  Thanks Jo and all the previous reviewers!

Not being form New Orleans and having no idea what a Mardi Gras King Cake was I made it. After making it I decided it is basically a glorified cinnamon roll.

I lived in New Orleans my whole life until recently and desperately was in need of a king cake. I could have paid $40 to have one shipped so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. UNfortunately, this did not taste like a N.O. king cake AT ALL. I think it was the nutmeg and too much cinnamon.  The next day, the cake was rock hard. I used the bread machine which may have had something to do with it but I don't think so. Next time I'll spend the $40.

Awesome.  Made three times for church.  I used almond paste instead of pecans once (cut the sugar down 1/2) and made a filling of 1- 8oz. cream cheese softened and 1 sm box of instant vanilla pudding mix together for a cheese filling. They loved it so much needed to make it 3 times.

This was a pretty good king cake recipe! I made the dough in my bread machine. A friend has a nut allergy, so I made different fillings for the two cakes this recipe makes. On the first cake, I made as recipe stated, except I doubled the filling ingredients. On the second cake, I also doubled the filling ingredients (leaving out the pecans) stirred in one package of cream cheese, then I spread the mixture onto the dough. I also doubled the icing ingredients. I cut the bake time by 10 minutes, but I think it needed to be cut down a total of 15 minutes...it was pretty dark brown and dry on top. The cake with cream cheese filling was fine, but the original filling cake was very dry. I'd recommend letting the cakes sit to cool for a couple minutes after taking them from the oven before icing. Only ice a third of the cake at a time, and immediately put the colored sugar on that section - then move on to do the rest of the cake in the same fashion. The sugar won't stick if you try to ice the whole thing, then do the sugar afterwards. I didn't have the plastic babies when I made the cakes, so I put them in the next day. It was pretty tough to dig them in the bottom after it was already cooled, iced and sugared; next time I will have the babies ready when the cakes come out of the oven.

Simply amazing.  I could tell before I even got to the finished product that this was going to be exactly what I was looking for.  The cake turned out nice and airy and sweet. I used a cinnamon cream cheese filling instead of the one here, but I'd love to give that one a try as well.  I also added a splash of lemon juice and vanilla to get rid of the powdery taste you run into with just confectioners sugar and water.  I serve at a restaurant and made this cake as a mardi gras dessert special for us and so far have received rave reviews from all the customers.  Everyone's asking the owner who made it.  Anyways, thanks for an awesome recipe, I will definitely be making this again ;).  *Just wanted to add...I baked this cake at 335F for about 25-30 minutes and it came out perfectly golden brown...every oven's different it seems, but I shudder to think what 30 minutes on 375 would have done to my creation.

Great recipe.  I used my kitchenaid to knead it, and did the final rise in a bunt cake mold.  I used lemon juice instead of water in the frosting, and added a bit of vanilla extract for flavor.

This is a very good, easy to follow recipe. The only ingredient changes I made were omitting raisins (not an authentic king cake addition) and a slight reduction in the nutmeg (I used regular ground), which I am glad I did. I did bake it at a slightly lower temp (330) for 25 minutes, also. I'm a Louisiana girl, and this is the real deal.

I have rated this recipe before.  But, not reviewed . . . it is a very good recipe--best dough recipe that I've found.  Easy to half . . . as most won't need two cakes.  I have taken out the raisins and nuts to keep it more authentic.  I also used a different cream cheese and icing recipe.  I HIGHLY recommend using Rapid Rise yeast as it will cut out the FIRST proof of 2 hours.  Basically cutting recipe time in half!  Just follow direction on yeast pack -- it's a 10 minute rest after kneading instead of 2 hours . . . 
Will be making a few soon for friends and family!!! 
Happy Mardi Gras from BR.

Made this as written once and it was OK. 

Made it again with a few changes and it was the best king cake I've ever eaten! 
-The second time, I made half the recipe, only one cake. 
-I accidentally dropped about a tsp of nutmeg into the dough but it tasted better like that than the original amount. 
-I spread 8 oz. of cream cheese before the pecan filling, which I doubled (used the same amount as would be used for 2 cakes), and substituted dried cranberries for raisins. 
-I baked it at 340F for about 35 minutes. 
-I also made a cream cheese glaze with regular granulated sugar dissolved in a few tablespoons of water because I was out of confectioners sugar.

With these changes, it is a 5 star recipe. As written, it's a 3. The dough is quite good, just needs more filling. Careful! not to over-cook. It will dry it out and it won't be and good.

I've made this for several years now. The only things keeping this from being a 5 star recipe (in my opinion) are the baking time and the glaze. First, I checked my first cake when there were 14 minutes left on the timer. It already looked done, but I knew the filling wouldn't be. This is when I remembered having to watch it very closely the other times. I took it out after 23 minutes and it was actually a little darker than I wanted. My second cake was completely baked in 20 minutes. I do have an oven thermometer, so I know my temp is correct. Second, the glaze/frosting recipe is way off. You'll have to add way more than 1 TBSP of water to make this work, then there is only enough to cover one cake (unless you only want a tiny bit on each one.) I ended up almost doubling the frosting recipe in order tohave enough for both cakes. Filling is a matter of preference. I've used the included recipe with raisins and without. I've also used a cream cheese and cherry filling and a whipped chocolate filling. I generally do have to add a good bit of extra flour to make the dough "come together," but the dough is a dream to work with when it's finished.

This recipe was easy to make but I found the taste a little disappointing. The King Cakes I always had in Louisiana were very sweet and soft. This cake is very good but really not different from cinnamon rolls. If I make again I will add more filling and not bake as long.

Thank you for this lovely American ('cajun') recipe..I have been looking for the French style cake, but find this one to be a great alternative! If you are short on time and want a delicious filling (although it can be 'pricey') spread a tube of quality almond paste (there is a  high quality marzipan from Holland sold at Target!) and wow--it is yummy! (Use some melted butter still) Bonne Fete des Anniversaire Bebe Jesus!! He certainly deserves such a delight in his honor!!

I made a few changes to the recipe. I added 1 8oz package to the filling- blend the pecans, raisons etc. to the mix, just microwave the cream cheese for 2 minutes so it mixes easily. I also used a cream cheese icing and piped in 'mardi gras beading' to the cake. Also use a deep roasting pan to get the oval shape, it kept the shape and had the same consistancy as I was making 6 cakes for a catering function.

Save yourself some time like I did...Instead of making the pastry from scratch buy the seamless cresent rolls. I used 2 packages, unroll them and put the both sheets together to make a long sheet. Fill with the filling, I used the applesauce instead of butter as suggested by another reviewer and added 1/2  small tub of ff cream cheese.  I  used 1/2 tub of frosting and low fat cresent rolls .I cut the cooking time to 20 min at 350*F..It was wonderful and easy... serve on baking sheet after cooling.

The only reason its 4 stars instead of 5 is because 30min is much too long at 375.  The crust/top was rock hard but the inside was wonderful.  And I didn't put raisins in it, but cinnamon, sugar, brown sugar, flower and pecan.s

Hold the raisins and the nuts, please.  I like just a plain cinnamon filling.  Great recipe.  King cakes are  very time consuming to make, but worth it for a special occasion.

This was wonderful!  I used Smart Balance in place of the butter but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  I cut the recipe in half and it made just the right amount for our family.  Next time, I'll reduce baking time by about 5 minutes or so.  Thank you!!

I have made this king cake recipe twice now, and it comes out wonderfully. The only thing is I double the filling, omit the raisins and make 3 rolls, which are then braided. If you do a braid, the cross section of slices looks extra pretty. I also double the frosting and a brick of cream cheese (my DH, from Louisiana, insists on cream cheese frosting). Great recipe:)

This has to be the driest, most tasteless king cake I have ever tried. I found the dough to be very bread-like, but with a cardboard flavor. The filling was extremely dry and lacked flavor. The icing had to be one of the worst parts of the cake. It did not make enough to cover one king cake much less two not that I would have wanted more of this bland sugar paste. I would not recommend this recipe to my worst enemy. I have been born and reared in Louisiana and have tasted many different recipes for king cakes, but this is not among the better I have ever experienced. Can I give this recipe a minus five stars? Yuck is an understatement.

Close to authentic, but there are no raisins in a real King Cake here in Louisiana.  There may be other fillings, fruit or cream flavored, depending on how brave the cook wants to be.

The bread was perfect! This was my first try at a King Cake and it came out sooooo good. I let the dough rise in the microwave with a cup of hot water sitting to the side, idk if that really helped but this dough was so fluffy and soft, and even better the next day. On one cake I did the butter, cinnamon/brown sugar, and on the other I did half cream cheese, half strawberry pie filling mixed with cream cheese. The plain cinnamon/sugar was great and the strawberry cream cheese was rocking' too. I made the frosting like a few others posted: 2 1/2 C powdered sugar, 1 T butter, a little vanilla, and lemon juice and milk. I live in BR and this was my first king Cake of the season... it's gonna be tough to beat! So excited I know how to make a king cake :)

This recipe was amazing! I halved it for 8 servings since we are all giving up sweets for Lent and I didn't want extra for Ash Wednesday. Used applesauce in the dough instead of butter and applesauce in the filling instead of butter too. Can't beleive how moist and delish it turned out! Used skim milk for dough and glaze, too! Granted, it's alot of sugar but almost no fat! Didn't take the time to proof the yeast, just through all the indregients for the dough in my KitchenAid with the dough hook and whala! Beautiful! Thanks so much for a keeper recipe!

This was my first King Cake and I loved it. Perhaps not the most traditional, but yummy. I substituted oatmeal for the pecans (didn't have any on hand and didn't want to pay $10 lb to get any lol) and upped the butter a little bit to make up for it.

Everyone loved it

I made this cake last night and it's already half gone at work today!   I made the dough exactly as the recipe stated but made one ring with the cinnamon/brown sugar filling and then made a cream cheese filling for the other.    I only had regular crystal sugar for the colored sugar which worked fine but if you want a more solid color I would suggest using sanding sugar.

This was my first attempt at a King "Cake". I was scared because it came out very brown on the outside, but the next day it was soft. I will probably cut the time 5 minutes next round. I also doubled the filling, but thought it was a bit too much. I'd recommend making one and a half the recipe for the filling.  However, I tripled the frosting recipe. I also twisted the two rolls together to make one cake instead of making two rings.

My husband is from New Orleans and he loves this recipe. I used half bread flour and half AP flour so the dough really rose and was a little more fluffy, which is our personal preference. The dough itself is not too sweet so you can please those who like things sugary and those who don't by adjusting the amount of icing you drizzle on.

This would have been 4-star, but I had to knock one off because of the temperature. I had my cake on for 20 minutes at 330 degrees- if I had put it on for 30 minutes at 375, I don't know what it would have come out like.  Anyway, I used a cream cheese filling instead of the recommended one, but I kept everything else about the recipe the same. My cake turned out fabulously, better than any I've had from a bakery.

Having lived within 60 miles of New Orleans I know exactly what GOOD king cake is suppossed to taste like.  I'm not talking about the cardboard flavored want-a-bes in local grocery stores.  But the dedicated bakers who churn these babies out by the thousands during Mardi Gras season.  Here is my take on this recipe...

First of all I had to increase my flour by nearly a 1/2 cup.  Otherwise the dough was way too sticky.  I kneaded my dough in my kitchenaid mixer on stir for 10 minutes.  I then oiled the boil and flipped the dough ball to make sure it was covered.  I let it rise for the suggested 2 hours and the dough was literally perfection.  It was easy to roll.  The first time I made the recipe I made 2 king cakes.  The second time around I made 4 smaller ones.  

On to the filling...I have NEVER had a king cake in Louisiana that contained raisins...nor have I ever heard of one that had them.  So I omitted the raisins both times.  The first time I doubled the filling....BIG mistake.  It made the cake overly sickly sweet.  The second time I only did a normal amount and it was perfect.  

Baking....reduce the temperature to 335 as suggested by others.  Keep a close eye on baking.  I would check at 18 minutes.  Use a temperature probe to check for doneness.  Don't overbake or you risk a dry cake.  The temp should register at 195 degrees inside and will be perfect.  

Now on to the frosting.  Water and sugar is not like the frosting that tops the king cakes in Louisiana.  It is

I have been an allrecipes lurker for years and i really felt that i had to rate this recipe because it is AWESOME!. I make this all the time and vary the filling to suit the occasion. I even use this dough for cinnamon buns! Also, if you find that you don't have the time to do it all at once, you can let it do it's second rise in the fridge over night. The dough wont be as airy but its still delicious!

This was my first King Cake.  The recipe was great!  I took it to work and it was highly praised.  A long time New Orleans resident said that it looked and tasted authentic.  This is a definite repeater for me.  I did use too many eggs accidentally, but it was very good!

This cake was SO easy to make and it tastes BETTER than store bought King Cakes.  My changes were minimal, I left out the raisins (YUCK!) and then I thought the glaze needed something more so I made a Vanilla Bourbon Glaze - I'll post the recipe to my blog (thedailygourmet.blogspot.com)

Delish!  I made this festive treat for a little dinner party.  I cut the recipe in half to make one cake.  I made the dough in my KA, super easy!  Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh nutmeg so I upped the quantity a little using the pre-ground stuff.  I also beat a bar of softened cream cheese in with the filling ingredients and spread the entire mix on the dough and then rolled it up.  After 20 minutes, the cake was getting too brown so I covered it with foil for the rest of the baking time.  I did skip hiding the plastic toy.  Many of my guests had another piece of this tasty dessert!  Will make again!

Rating even before trying., Just made a King Cake yesterday adapting two recipes from allrecipes.com, loved it! Reason I am rating this is because I like the sound of the filling use here Jo. Already planning one with raisins...but going to put the raisins in my dough., But will def. use your filling idea. One note...folks these are SWEET coffee cakes...the glaze and sprinkles make it over the top...so you can go easy!

Excellent!  Made one ring as directed and one with apples instead of pecans, since my mother can't have the nuts.  Both were delicious.

First time I ever celebrated Mardi gras this way. I made this for my coworkers who absolutely loved this. I had to explain them the meaning behind the colors and all (we're French, that kind of king cake doesn't exist here) and they were delighted. A great success, thanks a lot!!

Half an hour was DEFINITELY too long to cook the cake in my oven, which is usually pretty accurate with temp and time.  Other than that, great!

I craved this desperately when I was pregnant but we live in upstate NY and nobody sells them not even around Mardi Gras and my husband said it was too hard to make. This recipe whipped up in a snap and would've been delicious if I hadn't subbed nature's blend butter stuff for the butter in the filling, totally ruined it by trying to be healthy. Cake tastes great to everyone but me though because I know what it's supposed to taste like!

I made this for a Mardi Gras party for a class.  Everyone said that it was traditional tasting, and complemented it.  I used my bread maker for the dough as well.  I think it would have been better with some other type of filling, but it was pretty good.

I made 2 cakes using the batter. 1 cake had 1/2 of the suggested filling while the second cake had 4 oz cream cheese, 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon of butter.

I have lived here in the south ALL my life. We are actually 45 minutes from New Orleans. Down here, we "stuff" our king cakes with srtawberry filling, pineapple, bavarian cream, cream cheese, caramel pecan or you can have it plain- it's your choice. Anyway, this was just OK. Not at all like what you get in the bakery. It so easy to just pick one up during the season than to go through the trouble to make this. If you don't live here, then maybe ignorance is bliss and you'll love it. Sorry- it's my opinion.

This is easy to make, but I needed less flour.  I used four and a half cups.  I also tried using lemon pie filling in one of the cakes and the kids loved it.

Absolutely the best I've every had, and that includes the ones in New Orleans.  Amazing.  We made one change, switched out the raisin filling for cream cheese filling.  But it the texture and taste of the bread that was so amazing.!!

Non-dairy, but fantastic!  I have never made anything that needed to rise before, so I was doubly impressed. I made a couple of changes because of food allergies but I believe that the recipe would be at least as good if not better without any modifications.  I had to make this non-dairy so I substituted frozen leftover dairy-free eggnog for the milk.  I figured that would be closer to real milk than rice milk would have been.  I reduced the sugar just a little bit to compensate for the sweetness of the eggnog.  I also used dairy-free butter. Oh, yeah, I didn't have pecans so I chopped up some almonds instead. Worked great. One more thing: I didn't have the right colors of sprinkles for Mardi Gras, so I made colored sugar using the recipe found under "Colored Sugar" on Allrecipes.

First time trying this recipe and it came out better than I expected. The video was very helpful, and good for referencing how to kneed the dough. I didn't like the frosting so I made a buttercream frosting instead.

Easy to follow instructions. If using a convection oven, rotate half ways through the baking time at 350. Also, if using a kitchen aid mixer, put the wet mix in the bowl and add the flour per directions at speed 2 for 3-4 min to develop gluten.  To make sprinkles buy colored gel at Michaels or other and toothpick some in a sandwich bag and mix sugar colors.  EVERYONE LOVED IT. "THANKS"

This ended up tasting okay, pretty authentic, but dried out quickly and was not worth the fuss.  I cut the recipe in half, because I only needed one cake!  The dough was much too sticky and very frustrating to work with.  It tore when I rolled it up with the filling, which I made with just butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  Even though I tried to patch it, some of the filling leaked out while baking.  I read other reviews first and knew the baking time was too long, but forgot to check the cake early, so it got too browned on top.  Also, the icing recipe made very little, so it was only drizzled on the cake.  I'll be going back to my old recipe next year.

I'm pretty disappointed. I made a great King Cake last year and hoped that this was the recipe I used. Sadly, I don't think it was. The flavor of the dough and filling were just okay. I left out the raisins in the filling, because I just don't associate raisins and King Cake. Then, I added the sugar frosting following the recipe as is...blech! I think it ruined the whole thing. I should have added a little lemon juice or maybe a touch of vanilla extract to brighten it up. I'm hoping it will pass as okay at my Fat Tuesday celebration tomorrow, but in the end I may not even bring it. If I were to use this recipe again I might add another tablespoon or two of butter to the dough and an extra 1/2 tsp of salt. I would also add either lemon juice or vanilla extract to the frosting for more depth of flavor.

I was in charge of supplying a king cake for Mardi Gras this year at work, and felt like trying to make one rather than drive across town to get one from the bakery (which I thought was nothing special). Normally the king cake stays around all day at my work, but this one was gone within a couple of hours, and people that normally wouldn't eat king cake ate some because it was homemade. They especially loved the rich flavor of the bread, and that it wasn't overly sugary (I went easy on the icing and did not double the filling). I made this twice. Both times I cut the recipe in half (works great if you don't need to feed an army), and used a bread machine for most of the initial work, and did the shaping and final rise as normal. Since it's cold in the winter where I live and room temperature was not enough to raise the bread, I preheated the oven to its lowest temperature, then turned it off, placed a mug of boiling water on the edge of the cookie sheet the bread dough was on, and let the bread rise inside the warm oven. (For me, rising is normally the most difficult part of making yeast bread, and it worked great!) I also brushed egg wash on top (just beat an egg with a tiny bit of milk or water) before baking to give it a nice golden color. This recipe was a great success, and I would even consider making it when it's not Mardi Gras because it's that tasty. Thank you for the awesome recipe.

This recipe was spot on for times, temps and measurements.  Really enjoyed the texture and flavor of the dough.  I did add 1 tsp each of lemon zest and orange zest to the dough for personal preference.  Really enjoyed the finished product.

I had never made a King Cake before.  I was surprised this recipe is so similar to my cinnamon roll recipe.  So, a King Cake is basically a giant cinnamon roll!  This really was a terrific recipe!

This was a delicious cake!  Thank you for sharing.  The one thing I have to change for next year is not to leave it in the oven for that long.  The cake only needed about 15-20 minutes in my oven.  I'm glad I was watching it or it would have burned.  Thank you so much for sharing!  It was a hit at my Mardi Gras party.

I halved the recipe and made it in the bread machine. I omitted raisins in the filling. The dough came out very sticky, but rolled out very thin. It was so thin that the filling broke through! I made so many mistakes:
1. Keep the rectangle of dough THICK when you roll it out.
2. Don't put filling for the last few inches on the dough, or else it will seep out while baking.
3. Don't let the cake rise before baking or it will flatten out.
4. Bake for 20 min at 335 degrees, and it should come out good.

It tasted very good, but I need to work on its appearnance. I forgot to cut slits in it, but if I did it would have been even messier. I also did not use a baby. Since we ate it for breakfast, I left off the icing. In the end, it wasn't really a king cake, but was still very yummy.

I have several different variations of this recipe, and while they are all great, I really like this one best. What you use for the filling is a matter of personal preference. I'm not particularly a raisin fan, but I did use golden raisins in the filling for this recipe, and everyone LOVED the cake (myself included). 
This is a wonderful recipe, and not at all difficult, it just takes a bit of time. This makes two large rings---one to serve and one to give. Do try this!

This was delicious! I added extra brown sugar and butter to the filling and did not add the nuts and raisins. I made my own sugars with regular granulated sugar and food coloring. Gotta get that sugar on there quick, cause the powdered sugar glaze dries fast! Not sure if I made the cuts the way they are supposed to be, but they ARE NECESSARY because first time around I forgot to do it; it was still edible but looked terrible. These two came out really good.

Followed the recipe to the letter and this worked wonderfully. It's rather like a coffee cake and was a great hit today at the office. People tend to forget about holidays when they're living in a cube. 
My only wish is that the pastry stayed soft after baking. Well, that's what a microwave is for I guess. 
It takes awhile, but for an annual tradition, it's worth it.

I made this recipe last year, and it was incredible. I used cinnamon apples as the filling, took the darn thing to work, and it was gone in an hour. Great recipe, and doubles well as a recipe for cinnamon rolls - just use a sharp knife to cut the roll. :)

Hmm...I followed this recipe exactly and came out with a dry, overcooked cake.  If you're going to make this...try 350 instead of 375.  I'd also double the filling ingredients, and roll the dough out in a much larger rectangle to facilitate more filling!  Not a 5 star king cake as is...sorry.

This king cake is amazing! Better than most bakeries. I made some changes: for the filling I left out the nuts and raisins, I never heard of a king cake with raisins and I'm from Louisiana! And I doubled the filling. I did the dough in the bread machine which helped a lot. For the frosting I put a pinch of vanilla in the sugar, a small amount of melted butter and enough milk to make smooth. I baked at 350 for about 15 minutes. This was my first time doing a king cake and using a bread machine and found it was easier than I thought it would be. If you follow directions, you won't be disappointed with this recipe!!

This is wonderful to eat and fun to make.  I used the cream cheese frosting as was suggested in another review and left out the colors.  I baked in my convection oven at 340 degrees for 22 minutes and I will cut down on the time to 20 minutes the next time we enjoy this wonderful cake (pastry).

I can't believe I made something so pretty!  I followed a few suggestions  1) I split each 1/2 into thirds and braided.  It looked beautiful. 2) Omitted the raisin because I don't like them. 3) Used walnuts because that's what iI had on hand. 4) Cooked at 350 for 27 minutes and even that seemed too long.  So, for the second one, I cooked it for 25minutes and it was still a little drier than I would have liked.  Next time I'll decrease the cooking time by another few minutes to see if that makes a difference. 5) I used a thinned out cream cheese frosting to ice the cake and it added a fantastic flavor.  This was a great recipe.  I cannot wait to make it again!  Thank you sooo much for posting it...my guests were thoroughly impressed.

This was really good but I would have liked more filling and glaze.  Next time I'll double those and I'll connect the two rolls to form one big oval instead of two small ones.

This is a very good recipe with one exception- the cooking temp. I am giving this a 4 because of that, but would like to say that the dough of this recipe is fantastic. I did leave the raisins out because that isn't traditional. And I added cream cheese and apple filling. I made my dough using the dough hook of my kitchenaid mixer.

I made this King Cake- my very first attempt at one- and it turned out beautifully! I only cooked it 25 minutes. It would have burned if I left it in for 30 so be sure to check it. It takes a lot of patience but it is well worth it! I also made one giant King Cake instead of two smaller ones like the recipe suggests. I left out the pecans and raisins in the filling and even used some whole wheat flour mixed in with the all purpose for the filling.

I make several of these every year. Everyone loves them. I add a little more flour to the dough than the recipe calls for. The icing I use is a basic powdered sugar, vanilla, butter and milk one.

review 1) We loved this King cake! I changed this recipe using JNFAGAN's review because I needed it to go in the bread-maker, and I am  lactose intolerant. I made a lot of changes so I only gave it 4 stars. I halved the recipe, used applesauce and rice milk in place of butter and milk, increased the filling amount, and I added fresh lemon juice to the glaze to make it brighter. Yummy! I put it in the bread-maker on the dough setting and then took it out, added the filling, and followed the directions from there. It baked up beautifully, but it was more of a bread texture than cake. I let my kids munch down most of it at snack time with peanut butter spread on top of each slice. My two toddlers LOVED it! My husband did too :).
review 2) Made this a couple more times in the bread maker and we still love it! I used all the ingredients listed, but put them in the bread maker on the dough setting then rolled, filled, and baked. I filled it with a mix of ground pecans, apple sauce, brown sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon. It was so good!

This recipe was very good, I made it for my family and took one to work and they were both big hits!  I grew up in New Orleans and it was delicious!  I used cream cheese frosting (like for carrot cake) in one and german chocolate frosting (evaporated milk, coconut, pecans, etc) in the other instead of the recommended filling.  I also spread the filling in the middle and folded the dough in half instead of rolling it over itself.  Definitley recommended!

I am from New Orleans and this one was pretty close.  Since we don't add the raisins to our King Cakes, I left that part out.  It was a great substitute for us now that we are far from home.  Thank you!

I've made this a few times and it's always come out pretty tasty. However, I do make changes to the recipe. I usually add about 1 tsp vanilla extract to the dough and sometimes cinnamon. For the filling I  remove the pecans and raisin (seriously, who puts raisins in king cake?) and add a pack of cream cheese instead, and usually a little nutmeg. Without the cream cheese it's come out a bit dry though. I'm dissatisfied with the icing. I've tried it with vanilla and almond extract but I want something less runny. However, it's a good base recipe if you live out of state and have a craving for King Cake. :)

Great for Mardi Gras themed book club!  Special thanks to Laur5270 from Feb 01, 2010 as I didn't know how I would get dough to rise in cold winter months, but the 2 hours in the microwave with a cup of boiled water worked great.   I made 1 cake (1/2 recipe) and put it in a bundt pan and it looked a little more elegant.  I  cut a little off the bottom to level it out.   Wilton has a 4 sprinkle package which had the perfect green, yellow and purple (plus pink) which made decorating easy.

I've  made this a couple  of times. followed the directions to the letter. First time the cake came out burnt on the bottom.
next time I used parchment paper and no burn, cake looked done in 20 minutes so I took it out and it was pretty dry. also the cake didn't  taste sweet enough for us and the filling wasn't enough. I will make it again but next time I'm adding one half again as much filling, adding twice the sugar to the cake and soaking the raisins in something, probably countries, overnight.

I did have to tweak as other readers did.  I tried 3x until I had it perfected. I did cut the recipe in half to put in my breadmaker.  To make one loaf, I reduced the filling to 75% of what the recipe called for.(in other words 1.5 of the half amount).  
BIG BIG key: I cooked at 330 degrees for about 25 minutes--it was way overdone at the original temperature.
I did use ramekin in the center and I have since read a small coffee can would work..probably better

I switched up the icing as recommended for a full recipe (or halved for one cake)2 c. powdered sugar, 1 T. butter melted, 1 t. clear vanilla, 1 t. lemon juice, 3 T. milk (plus add extra milk as needed to get to the right consistency.

This one turned out perfect and was devoured!

It's Mardi Gras today and this King Cake was a big hit.  First time for me...I'm a New Englander!!  No raisins, 1 1/2 times the filling and twice the glaze.  It's a keeper! Thanks Laur5270 for the great tips!

great recipe..  Cook at 350 degrees (per the video) and not 375 degrees as written above.  Much more bread-y than cake-y but very delicious.  also, a lot of fun to make with kids.  we used food coloring for the frosting as we didn't have colored granulated sugar and it looked amazing.   that is all.  enjoy.

Fabulous!  Like others, I cut the recipe in half.  Now I wish I hadn't because it disappeared so fast!  No changes or tweaking needed on this one.  Absolutely perfect.  Nothing more to say that hasn't been said already.  Definitely a keeper.

Huge hit at our home!  Made it with Cindy's Jambalaya for a perfect Fat Tuesday meal.  I made it in our bread machine till step 3. Yes it does make more than one.  In fact I made I large and 2 small choosing to give 2 away with a note "Laissez les bons temps rouler". I did forget to pick up a toy baby....and baby Jesus was tucked away in the attic. :)))
ps I added a bit of vanilla to the frosting.

OMG- So, we all hate those people who alter recipes to the point where they can't even be compared to the original... that being said... I halved this recipe, since I didn't want to make 2 cakes. I'm also glad I read the instructions all the way through, to see it does in fact make 2 cakes. I did NOT half the filling though... in fact I added a first cream cheese layer ( 1 block of room temp cream cheese w/ 1/2 cup powdered sugar, in stand mixer for maybe a bit too long... yummy!) Also, I have bread machine yeast... I did have the required 1 packet of active dry yeast on hand, but, have not had luck in the past, so I used 1 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast, let rise for 1 hour for the first go (did the dough in the stand mixer, wound up using close to 3 cups of all purpose flour) let it rise for another 45 minutes on the second go around, after rolling out and filling in an oven I had already heated to 200 degree F for the colored sugar... it rose beautifully... after maybe 30-45 minutes I had to pull it out of the oven at that point so I could pre-heat it to 375. Cooked it for 30 minutes... I did put an upside down custard cup in the center that I sprayed with PAM... good thing too... since I probably went a bit overboard with the yeast... still. So Good. The end result? I've had King Cake, during Mardi Gras, in Louisiana and this... is infinitely better. Of course I did basically quadruple fill it... I will try again with less filling, if only for the non nut lovers.

Bread machine users be careful! I have a 2 pound bread machine and thought I would use the dough cycle.
I should have watched it more carefully, as I ended up with a huge mess in my bread machine. I recommend cutting the recipe in half unless you plan to spend at least half an hour cleaning out the inside of your machine.

The king cake is absolutely delicious. This is the first time I have eve tried it. I will make it again, but will skip the machine and do it by hand.

Yummy! I did cherries instead of raisins because we don't like raisins. net time I would double the filling and possibly bake in a bundt pan.

This was my first time making a king cake and also my first time even trying one so I wasnt sure what to expect. It came out very good.  Kind of like a cross between a honey bun and cinnamon roll.  I did leave out the raisins and also cut the recipe in half to just make one cake. Very good!

I rarely give such a low rating, but after the amount of work that went into this, I was very disappointed when I checked the first cake with 5 minutes left to bake, and the outer surface was burned beyond being edible. I followed all other instructions to a tee, but something was clearly off. Guess I'll hope the second cake goes better- I'll certainly check it sooner!

Wow!  This was amazing.  I took some to a friend and she made me promise she didn't have to wait another year for mardi gras to come around before she got more.  My son doesn't like pecans so I had used almond meal in place of them, and it was incredible.  On one of them, I added almond extract to the icing.  The only thing odd was the cooking time.  I cooked one at a time rather than together as they wouldn't fit together in the oven, and the first one burned as it only took the second one 15 minutes to bake.  But I'll definitely be making this for special breakfasts as well as fat tuesday.

This is sensational! Wonderful flavors and authentic as you can get! Was a big hit with friends. One lady, who lived in New Orleans, says this brought back good memories of Mardi Gras. And yes, I did keep one cake for myself. :)

This was my first attempt at making a King Cake.  A coworker had mentioned this cake on numerous occasions so I decided to make this for him.  He grew up with this tradition so I was very pleased when he told me it was excellent and reminded him of years long gone.  Everyone at work rated this 4 1/2 to 5 stars....great recipe!

This was really good and just like I remember from living in NOLA.  Next time I will probably add a bit of vanilla to the frosting.  I also recommend using the golden raisins for this.  Final note: this makes a lot.  Easily serves 24+.

This was pretty good, but 30 minutes was too long for some reason and one of my cakes burned. I made the second cake with the leftover cinnamon sugar but added a bar of cream cheese. I liked this version much better than the first.

this was ok, but more bready than king cake should be. king cake is fluffier and more pastry like. the filling is fine.  if you are looking for authentic style king cake, i wouldn't go for this one. true, king cake recipes vary depending on region of Louisiana and family, but this one is not at all to my preference.

As a Louisiana native, I adore this recipe!  I omitted the raisins and nuts out of personal preference but added creolemama's cream cheese part on top of the brown sugar mix.  Perfect!  Thanks so much for posting!

I made this the first time according to the recipe except without nuts and soaking raisins in boiling water for 20 min prior to use.  The second time I turned it into cinnamon rolls.  It made 16 rolls.  Taking away the 4 end rolls, the remaining twelve fit perfectly into a greased 9x13 pan.  The other four fit into individual ramekins.  I baked it for 350 for about 30 minutes, until even the center rolls were golden brown.

This recipe made a beautiful king cake.  It was really delicious, but I'd probably use less nutmeg as I found it a bit strong, but that's just a personal taste - otherwise I loved it.

This recipe is wonderful! I did a couple of practice runs before the big day--Fat Tuesday--and tried several of the variations people suggested. One tip on adding a cream cheese mixture: this turns out much better if you contain the cream cheese in one band towards the beginning end of your rolling of the dough. I had some issues with it seeping out during baking when I tried spreading it over the entire dough rectangle. Also, don't snip the cakes with cream cheese filling (or at the most just give the dough some tiny slices with a sharp knife and don't cut in as far); it looks prettier without the seeping filling!

I cut this recipie in half (only had one egg in the house), kept the original amount of filling and added 1/2 a block of cream cheese. It came out DELICIOUS! Gone in about 15 minutes.

Really yummy! Not too sweet. I used a whole almond for the "baby." I will make this as a coffee cake through the year. I cut the recipe in half, as there are only 3 of us, and it's keeping nicely in my covered cake dish.

Just made this and it was delicious!  I made one with the cinamon and sugar filling but added the cream cheese filling that was suggested in another review.  In the other I put the cream cheese filling and a strawberry filling.  I also prepared the dough in my breadmaker and it turned out perfect.  I did let it rise in a bowl though cause I knew my breadmaker wouldn't be big enough.  In fact I had to help it mix a little bit since there was a lot of dough in there and it had trouble mixing the top portion, but it kneaded fine. I did not add the nuts and raisins because those are not typical king cake ingredients.  I'm a Louisianian so I am even more impressed with this recipe because I have had many, many king cakes and this is the best one I have had and my hubby agreed!  I also cooked it at 350 for about 20 minutes as well.

I made this for the first time and it came out amazing. This was my first attempt using yeast.
The "bread" cake is delicious and it makes a great presentation. It will definitely become a tradition in our home. I used raisins, dried cranberries, walnuts and apricot preserves to the filling. Amazing!

This was great even though I forgot to add the butter to the dough part. oops! Tasted like a less rich cinnamon roll and is definitely something I can see myself making again. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I made it as posted, except I left out the raisins b/c my daughter doesn't like them.  I wish I had seen the reviews about cooking it at a lower temp.  30 mins at 375 was definately too long.  Next time I will probably add some more filling since that was everyone's favorite part!

What a great presentation this made! Delicious too.  I followed several reviews and lowered oven temp. to 335 F.  I twisted the 2 rolls together and it came out the size of a sheet cake once it doubled. Definately needs more filling than called for.  5 stars if you double the filling, as is there were several areas that were just dry cake, no filling. Will definately make again! I hid the toy "baby"  with a whole nutmeg to be sure it was seen.  A huge hit with the kids!

This is my second time making this recipe and it is excellent. I leave out the raisins and nuts since I am serving it to kids at a playdate but everyone loves this recipe and last year I didn't even have enough leftovers to let my husband taste it!

My eight-year-old didn't want to share it, it was so good.  I have made this two times and today was my third.  I have had to knead this by hand, so it is about time to purchase a Kitchen Aid.  Great recipe.  Followed exactly as written.

Two cakes are done and look great.  I added cream cheese to the filling mixture and eliminated the butter. I substituted dried cherries for the raisins. So yummy.

This was a great recipe!  I made this with my 4 year old and she had a blast working with the dough.  I think I would add more filling though the next time we make this.

This was great. I made it for my class and they all loved it. , I subbed for whole wheat flour. My kids were eating whole grains and didn't even know it. I made it into one big huge cake and put it in a bundt pan to hold its shape while baking. I was a little too impatient, so I didn't let it rise enough before baking, but if fluffed right up during baking and it didn't seem heavy at all.

My kids and I thought this was very good! My oldest helped me roll out the dough, and fill it, then roll it back up.  I used milk instead of water in the frosting.  Made the colored sugar by mixing a drop of food coloring with about a TBSP of sugar.  A very festive looking cake!

This was the first time I have baked a King Cake, instead of ordering one. This was yummy.  Bread did seem a little dry even taking it out five minutes early.  Next time I want to double the filling or add cream cheese.

Absolutely amazing cake! The filling is too die for and I replicate it in cinnamon rolls. Made it for coworkers and the whole thing was gone that day! Wonderful way to celebrate Fat Tuesday.

Easy to make and is really good.  I doubled the filling as suggested in the reviews.  I baked the first cake 20 minutes instead of 30, it was a little hard.  I baked the second cake only 15 minutes, until it was golden brown.  It was soft like a cinnamon roll.  Both were good but I preferred the softness of the second cake.

I've never had King Cake before and i HATE baking but i made this and it came out really well.  I halved the dough recipe but kept the filling recipe the same and made two smaller cakes.  It was really good.  My family loved it and my daughter loved decorating it.  Next time i think i will just make one large cake.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this for my Bunco party. It was a very easy and good recipe. I did double the filling because I felt that 1/2 the called for amount was too little for both cakes. I also doubled the glaze. Note about the glaze. If you apply the glaze when the cake is hot you need to move fast and put the colored sugar on quickly or the glaze will make a crust and the sugar will not stick. I will make this again. I want to try it with a cream cheese filling.  Yum!!!

We had our annual pool theme party over the weekend, this year was Mardi Gras...the cake was a hit.  I had scaled it for 40..the cakes were huge, however great tasting...I omitted the raisins, and increased the Pecan a bit.  Everyone got right into finding the baby or NOT..it was a lot of fun, great for the theme party!

I have used this recipe now for 2 years, and it is wonderful.  One of the girls I work with was raised in New Orleans and said that this recipe is the best she has ever had.  She even asked me to make it for her this year to take to her families Mardi Gras party and they all agreed it was the best.  They said it is less dry than the ones they commenly see in New Orleans and had more filling.

I made 2 of these...one for my daughter to take to school and one for home.  As far as the dough goes...it was wonderful to work with.  It baked well too.  I thought that the finished product was a bit on the dry side though (perhaps spreading softened butter on the dough before sprinkling the sugar/nut mixture.  Also, I thought it was a bit "yeasty" in flavor and smell...perhaps it was the type of dry yeast I used though??  I would definitely make it again with just a few "tweaks" to take care of the areas dryness and over yeasty flavor.  Overall a good recipe though!

This king cake is incredible! I've made other king cake recipes and this is by far the easiest and tastiest. So light and fluffy. I'm giving a 4 out of 5 because I agree with other reviewers that the cook temp is too high.  I tried the 335 that other reviewers recommended and it worked well. I also agree that it works well with doubling the filling. I've had king cakes before with raisins so I'm not sure why that has been a complaint. If you don't like them,  leave them out. Definitely try leaving the dough to rise in the microwave with a cup of hot water! I tried that based on other reviews and it works very well.

Loved this! It was a lot of work, but well worth it in the end.  Like others, I omitted the raisins.  I doubled the filling and the icing, and I colored my own sugar yellow, purple and green.  My wife and I loved the flavor and texture.

This was my first king cake to make & it didn’t disappoint! It’s so soft & has great flavor. I read other reviewers tips & made a few small changes. I halved the recipe, but put extra filling (since others said it needed more). I don’t recommend that. That made it too sweet and it popped out the sides. I turned  my cook temp down to 335 degrees & cook time to 25 min. At the end I added fresh lemon juice and vanilla to the icing & it was absolutely delightful! This cake is a must try!

I will make it again although I left out the raisins and pecans. A traditional king cake does not use them. I about fell over. After all day in the kitchen my oldest son better be in love.

It was awesome and delicious. The only thing is, I was surprised when it turned out we were making two king cakes! I wish the recipe was only for one, or at least write in the description that it's two cakes, not just one.

Great recipe! I enjoyed making it and I changed the filling a bit! I added apple sauce instead of raisins, which tasted great!  But the liquid apple sauce caused the filling to run out of the cake during baking. The up side is the carmelized filling that ran out was divine!  So, I definitely recommend using apple chunks instead of apple sauce.  Should one chose to change the recipe.

I halved the recipe because I was baking for four and it worked well. Only change I would make would be to add more filling next time. Also, the outside bakes just a little faster than the inside and I had to cover the edges with foil for the last few minutes of baking.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. Watching the video was a HUGE help! I don’t typically make breads because I am intimidated by yeast. ?? This recipe was easy to follow and the end results are worth the wait!??
 I decorated one of them with the traditional Mardi Gras colors and the other one I drizzled with plain powdered sugar icing.

I've only been baking for a few years now, and king cakes can be difficult, but this recipe is amazing! It's delicious and fairly easy, it's a bit time consuming , but most of that time is letting it rise and cook so I can be cleaning up in that time. I'm not a huge fan of nuts or raisins, so I left those out of the fillings but I'm sure it would've been great either way! I would definitely recommend this  cake to a friend if they asked for something to make   :)

Great cake!  I made it for a Mardi Gras dinner party and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe to the letter except for the frosting which I doubled.  Next time I think I'll roll it a little smaller so the cinnamon filling covers it from end to end.

This seems to be a good basic recipe to make changes to suit your own taste.  Personally I liked it with the raisins.  (You might gauge this by, do you like cinnamon raisin bread or plain cinnamon bread, I like cinnamon raisin better so I included the raisins).  I did make 1 1/2 times the filling as suggested in other reviews and glad I did.  I thought confectioner sugar and water for the Icing seemed boring so I made a standard cream cheese icing and separated into 3 bowls and colored with cake coloring (Green, purple and yellow, as I am not a big fan of colored sugar sprinkles.)  I also rolled the dough to 1/ 8" thick instead of the 1/4", as I thought that seemed too thick and  I had about a 19" x 13" rectangle for one cake.  I also baked at 350 degrees for 25 min and still laid foil on top to keep it from getting too brown toward the end.  I would make this again and I would also like to try a fruit and cream cheese filling with this pastry sometime!

I tried the cream cheese filling someone suggested and I would suggest just sticking with the original recipe. You can double the amount of the filling if you want or not,  yeah.. stick to the cinnamon sugar. It’s way better. I don’t know if it’s traditional but who cares? It’s delicious.

I haven't made this but I intent to. I must say based on Jo's description the baby isn't baked in the cake. It's pushed in from underneath to keep the location concealed. Please don't bake a plastic baby in the cake! lol thank you for sharing the recipe with us!

Easy & great recipe! I make cinnamon rolls for the local farmers market each week & was always told by my friends that I should make king cakes, but the cakes intimidated me, for some reason. Upon looking at this recipe, I realized the steps were almost exactly like my cinnamon recipe. I braided my king cake for more  appeal.

I will keep this recipe.  It was easy in the machine.   I would add a little more salt.   Also be careful not to bring the cinnamon to the edges as it will spill out when baking.  It was difficult to get a true purple color for the sugar from a box of food color.  Overall as good as a bakery cake.

I made this recipe and it came out perfectly. I want to comment that I baked it at 5880 feet. It came out perfectly. I eliminated the pecans (allergy) and the raisins and it was delicious. I reduced the heat towards the end because it was getting quite brown and took it out 3 mins early. It was very fun to make. I enjoy waiting for yeast breads to rise.

The recipe turned out well. You should have some experience with making bread before trying this, but it turned out and tasted great. Needs to be served immediately or gets stale quick, but I’m only a rookie bread maker.

I've made this every year since I first printed it in 2012. It's easy and I've subbed currants and or craisins. I'm not a big fan of raisins any way.  Thankfully this website has that option to change the serving size so cutting it in half was much easy than me  writing in all the changes. Great stuff.

Great recipe and very authentic. I had to make mine dairy and egg free due to food allergies. No one could even tell. Used ener-g egg replacer, vegan margarine and vanilla flavored soy milk. This will become a tradition recipe for me.

So very delicious.  Had my first NOLA King cake just a few weeks ago. Came home with the tasty memory still on my lips, so I headed here for a good recipe.  This recipe is even better than the cake I had in the French quarter.  I will be making more of these tomorrow (the day before fat Tuesday) to share with friends and coworkers. I'm going to be Mr. Popular thanks to this thing!

I halved the recipe for this and made the frosting with confectioners sugar, rum, butter, and milk for a sort of buttercream glaze. Lots of compliments and second servings. Great recipe!

I really like how easy this recipe was, but as beautifully as the dough rose, the cook time and temp are way too high - this came out like a hard bread and every king cake I've had is soft and chewy,  Also, NO RAISINS in king cake. Ever.

I’ve lived in Louisiana my whole life & this recipe is pretty good! It’s an easy recipe to halve.  I find that one cake is plenty for a family or small get together (of for one person to eat off of for a few days :)) it taste great re-heated the next day! It’s 5 stars with a few alterations. 
1. Preheat oven to 350 & cook for 27-29 minutes 
2. Double the filling 
3. Omit raisins & walnuts (personal preference, but I’ve never had a king cake with raisins in it) 
4. For icing, mix together a pat or two of butter, vanilla, powdered sugar, & milk! I keep adjusting the powdered sugar & milk until i get the right amount, taste, and thickness that I want. 
**An easy cream cheese icing would also tase great on it! 
I will definitely be making it again!

Temperature is way too high, bottoms were BLACK. I bake bread daily, nothing wrong with my oven.  From the other reviews, I'm not the only one. Won't use this recipe again or any of  this persons.

This is pretty good.  I'm not too excited about the raisins, and my son doesn't like the pecans.  Is there a pecan (non-nut but crunchy) substitute?  BTW, to add to Little Bear's history of the baby, it goes a little further back than Mardi Gras.  "King" is from the Three Kings that visited baby Jesus in Bethlehem, and the baby was originally the baby Jesus.  The cake is to celebrate the Epiphany (aka, 12th day of Christmas), which happens to coincide with the start of Mardi Gras.

The King cake was good, but unfortunately I took the advice of one of the other reviewers and doubled the filling.   Bad move!!  The filling flowed like lava from the ring crystallizing into a layer of hard sugar around the rings on the bottom of the pan.  Luckily I was able to crack it off and it did not burn the bottom.  Though there was an uncomfortable mouthful of filling in the ring :( 

I would make this recipe again.  I did not add the raisins, and they weren't missed at all.  The dough was sweet and delicious.  The filling developed a buttery caramel flavor and if not for my mistake doubling would have been wonderful.

I omitted all purpose flour to bread flour. Added little more filling than it required. I made 4 cakes not 2 cakes. Most important thing is I reduced baking temp to 350 and baked for about 17 minutes. It came out perfect not over baked.

Wow, I thought this was delicious!  I'd never had nor made king cake, but I've done plenty of sweet rolls. A friend of mine from Louisiana thought it was great. For those with poor reviews I'd say know your oven: mine is fast and I only needed half the time. I also only needed 5 cups of flour; don't add it in all at once. I also doubled the frosting and used corn syrup and milk for moisture and added some drops of vanilla and almond flavoring. I'll definitely make it again, perhaps just for breakfast.

I read a lot of the comments.  I made doubled the filling recipe and the end results was a very sweet cake, to sweet for my tastes.   I used a very sharpe blade to slit the cake just through the first layer of dough.  This gives a very nice slit which you can cure for a sprial look.  The bake time seems to long for this temp, cake came out dry and over done. Next time I am going to bake at 350° and make sure it's not over baked.

I haven't made a king cake before but this is a great recipe. I read the recipe thourghly and watched the video. The video says to preheat the oven to 350 and the written recipe says 375.... So I'm not sure which it's supposed to be. I followed the written recipe and 30 minutes at 375 was way too long. I almost burned it! It was done at 20 minutes. So maybe 350 for 30 minutes or 375 for 20 minutes. I halved the cake and doubled the filling like other reviews suggested and halved the icing as well. I made colored sugar (check this site for recipe but basically a bit of sugar with a couple drops of food coloring as I didn't have any sprinkles in the decorative colors. You could always dye the icing instead of using sugar if you wanted too. But YUMM. This recipe is delicious. I did leave the raisins out of the filling also as I have never seen a king cake with them.

Ok everyone's pics of this cake look so good but mine did not rise like that. I know the yeast was good cause it rose the first time to double. Then when I made it into the ring shape, I let it sit for an hour or so and it just kinda spread out instead of up. Any ideas why? It tastes delish, just not pretty!

Great recipe, the only complaint is that the bake heat was too high (i baked mine at 340° (170C) based on prior reviews) for 30 minutes and a higher heat would have been too much as it was perfectly golden and done inside...Some of the pictures show a decidedly brown cake and that seems too much to me. Additionally, I added a bit of cream cheese to the frosting because I enjoy that but otherwise I followed the recipe to a T and it looks and tastes fabulous! I'm quite proud of myself as I thought something with so many steps would turn out a mess, though I am a somewhat experienced baker! Despite what others say about the filling not needing raisins (one famed King Cake bakery in New Orleans has over 60 different fillings, so I really wasn't bothered by needing a "traditional" filling comments) and desiring the "braiding" instead of the large roll with the scissor snips, I thought the result looked and tasted lovely. Though I will admit, this is basically a "glorified cinnamon roll" as someone else mentioned. But it's much more special due to the history and the decorations. I could not find a small plastic baby in my area but used a jelly belly baby (like a gummy bear) instead, historically people used coins or large dried beans so that's not super important. Also as a note: you don't need anything in the center to keep it from baking together or any special hot water (?!) when it rises....just treat it like the recipe says and it will be fine.

I doubled the filling, minus the raisins, as suggested, and made a cream cheese icing. It's a loaded cinnamon roll, sublime. 
Someone suggested lemon juice to the icing to take off the funky powdered sugar flavor. I did that, it helped, but was still off to me. American powdered sugar has additives to keep it from clumping, European powdered sugar does not. I think next time I'll go as far as throwing sugar into my Ninja and making my own powdered sugar. This fabulous cake deserves a perfect icing. 
The Mardi Gras party went nuts for it and I'm asked to bring 4 next year!

Delicious. I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose and it was a little chewy, but made me feel a little compensated health-wise for all that BUTTER.

This was very good. I made half of a recipe (just one cake instead of two) and as recommended by some of the top reviewers, did 2x the filling amount (or, to be clear, I made the filling as written, since I had cut the rest of the recipe in half).  It was deliciously sweet and gooey, but I think next time I would do it as written; the filling was just too much.  I was also low on butter so I subbed half applesauce for the filling.  It tasted great so I would do that again.  
I was worried when it came out of the oven because the top was pretty brown and hard, but the glaze softened it up quite a bit.

Very good, it rose very, very well. I will probably reduce the size. This one FILLED a 9x13 pan and about 4 inches high. Moist, I did add two blocks of cream cheese and did not add the butter to the filling (by mistake ). Still turned out great! Very forgiving recipe.

This is a great recipe! This was my first time making a King Cake and I am very happy with the results. I added an egg wash to the top before baking and was happy with the golden brown color. I also recommend baking at 350 instead of 375 -- I found that it browned too quickly at the higher temp. I also added some vanilla and lemon juice to the icing, which adds great flavor. But overall I love this recipe and would definitely make it again!

Easy recipe, with helpful video that I really appreciated. I subbed pistachios for the pecans and dried cranberries for the raisins. The finished pastry was much like a coffee cake, light and tasty. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for uploading this winner!

This was my first attempt at making a king cake.  I was very happy with the flavor of the cake even though I did leave the raisins out because of personal preference.  I pulled the cake out of the oven at 30 minutes even though my oven normally requires additional time on most recipes.  I would suggest paying close attention to the color of the top of the cake and the filling.  Once the top starts to turn light golden it's probably ready to pull.

Followed the dough part of this recipe to the T, and it came out perfect! I'm from Louisiana and the filling was not authentic, so I changed it. I melted 1/4 cup of butter and mixed it with about 1cup of brown sugar. I spread this on the dough, then I spread cream cheese mixed with powdered sugar. It came out great, and tasted like an authentic King cake. I made 3 King cakes in 2 days and my family are every bite of it! It is my new King cake recipe for the carnival season!!!

I made this because I was craving an amazing Bavarian cream king cake I got from Jennings, LA last year. My cakes came out wonderful!  I will be adding a cream cheese or Bavarian cream filling next time but they came out beautiful ! My personal opinion I doubled filling like others suggested and it's extremely sweet for my taste so if you add a cream filling I wouldn't double the cinnamon sugar filling.  Thank you for recipe.

My family and I love this recipe.  I omitted the raisins, nuked the milk in the microwave with the butter for about a minute on 70% power, and kneaded the dough in my kitchen aid instead of doing it by hand.

This recipe is BETTER than anything you can find in NOLA. I go there a lot and they are always too dry for my taste. This is the best King Cake I've ever had. I made adjustments, like the others: I halved the recipe, but kept the filling measurements the same, but NO raisins- yuck. I also mix a block and a half of softened cream cheese with 3 tbl flour, 2 tsp vanilla,  and 2 tbls milk, put this on before the filling. For the frosting, I used 2 cups of confectioner's sugar, mixed with 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp lemon juice, and 3 tbls milk. SO GOOD!!!

Took way more flour to get the dough to come together. Other than that it's good.

I have never heard of raisins in a king cake before. I did try this one leaving the raisins out. It was ok. Not traditional king cake, but it was good. And there is a ton more to king cake and Mardi Gras than the baby in the cake. I would make this again. But I would never put raisins in it!

Made this last year for my employees and they loved it! Making it again this week by request. After living in La. and having the real thing every year I wasn't sure it would be "as good" but this is a great recipe. (Making a few alterations to filling) VERY proud to serve this King Cake!!!

My family RAVED about this! I made as directed, with the exception of the filling. i candied some pecans and added them to the cinnamon sugar mixture listed in the recipe for one king cake, and for the second one i whipped up a cream cheese filling. I also added sour cream to the frosting to cut that weird powdered sugar taste/texture. I've lived in Louisiana all my life and have probably eaten hundreds of pieces of king cake in my lifetime, but we all agreed that this was the best we've ever had!

Great recipe!! Perfect every time! No raisins, no nuts. I bake it on a stone and don't need to oil the baking surface. When adding the colored sugars, I first use a water bottle spritzer to re-moisten the glaze. Since it's made of powdered sugar, it forms a shell almost instantly. I color my own sugars with Wilton color paste, scoop with a toothpick, and rub it into the sugar with a mortar and pestle.

I volunteered to make this cake for a Mardi Gras party I am attending and was disappointed.  The temperature indicated on the recipe is not that mentioned in the video.  In the recipe, 375 F. is the temperature, but in the video it is 350 F.   It would seem that experience is a pre-requisite when making this cake.

Well... its still in the rising stage but I wanted to make a note for the filling!  I have some cafe du monde coffee I was drinking from New Orleans and I decided to pour some in with the brown sugar.  Needed to add some more flour but... tasted oh so delicious!  I dont know why I havent done it before, but just cause you moved away from New Orleans doesn't mean you cant take the cooking with you!

This King Cake recipe is very authentic.    You can skip the cinnamon raisin filling and put cherry pie filling, lemon pie filling......whatever you can think to put in it......it's always great.  Just don't put too much.  Thin layer.   I use this recipe and it always is amazing!!

I was asked to make this for our Church School Epiphany party.  Never having made one before, and seeing MANY variations of opinions on the temperature of the oven as well as cooking time, I decided to do a "dry run" before the date of the party. I used the dough recipe exactly as printed, didn't change a thing. For the filling, I eliminated the nuts and raisins because of allergies.  So the filling was just a brown sugar cinnamon mixture with a little flour and butter  but it was very very good.   
I divided the dough in half as instructed and baked the first one at 335 as MANY people recommended, and set the timer on 15 minutes as a starting point.  It was not browned on top yet so I set it for 5 more minutes, then it needed 5 more. I took it out at that point, it was lightly browned and smelled wonderful.  However, after I cut into it, I found the inside dough to be just a little gooey.  It stayed that way even after it cooled completely. The second one I used 350 and started checking it at 20 minutes.  It needed almost 10 minutes more but the middle was cooked a lot better.  I guess you just have to know your oven, and keep a REALLY close watch on it.  The cake was amazing, tasted like a giant Cinnabon. Our local Cinnabon closed, so I have not had one in awhile.  YUM.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was my first time making a King Cake.  I did not use a bread maker and it was pretty simple to make and very delicious! I subsituted apple sauce for the butter in both the pastry and the filling. I would definitely recommend frosting while warm so that some of the icing soaks into the bread.

This is now my go to recipe for King Cake.  It was so pretty and it sure didn't last long.  I served it with gumbo at my Mardi Gras party.  Thanks for posting!

I made this according to recipe.  It was ok, but had a "yeasty" taste.  Looked great....but don't think I will go to the trouble again.

Made this for the first time this year, it was super easy and super tasty! It was gone in about 5 min! The only thing I did different (on accident) I forgot the raisins. and it was so perfect that way I probably wouldn't add them next time.

Fun and easy to make, although it made one BIG King Cake!  It did seem a tiny bit dry, but was perfect the next day.  I put a mixture of cream cheese, pecans brown sugar & cinnamon as the filling.  Also flung some rum into my icing, just for fun. Yum!

THIS IS GOOD. MAKE IT. Iv'e never made king cake... never made brioche... Needed enough to serve 75 at my nursing home. yikes? NOPE! ZOMG this is good! Iv'e always had store bought which I now understand is a DISGRACE! I'm quite pleased with myself! -- Be sure to wrap it well, or your filling will spill out..... but if you mess this up anyways, eat the brown sugar/raisin brittle creation on the pan... cause it's freakin good too!

This was awesome!  I've never had a traditional King Cake before, so I can't judge how authentic it tastes, but I CAN say that it's pretty darn delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception.  I didn't have any raisins or nuts on hand, so I left those out.  This baked through in about 18 minutes (no where near 30!), and the filling was wonderfully gooey and rich.  I agree with some of the other reviewers...this would make a great breakfast bread!  I can't wait to make this again for friends.

This recipe turned out beautifully and was well received by my children's classmates! A few notes of caution to those who rated it as "too dry" - that is operator error, not recipe error (sorry!) Follow the instructions PRECISELY. You must ensure that the yeast is dissolved in the right temperature of water for at least 10 minutes. You'll know that it's proper when it appears to be foamy on top. You also have to ensure that you scald the milk properly - don't let it boil and stir it constantly. These two factors will greatly decrease your chances of having a dry cake. Oil the dough as directed too and another tip - when you remove the cakes from the oven, ice them and immediately cover them with aluminum foil to keep in the moisture (unless you are serving it right away). Also - if you don't like raisins or nuts - this recipe allows for other fillings (though we love the raisins, cinnamon and brown sugar!) Now - no more nay sayers and bon appétit!

I cut nutmeg in half, made a bit more filling, and baked at 335 for 25 minutes. Used canned cream cheese frosting & colored sugar i bought. They were great. I also made some with a strawberry cream cheese filling: 1 brick cream cheese, 1/2 c powder sugar, and 1 cup diced fresh strawberry. Those were better!! But I'm not sure how many days those should stay at room temp. It seems the cheese would spoil so we ate those first. Tips, I cut off excess dough around edge before rolling. When making the ring, I sealed & made it prettier with a twisted ring of excess dough and put the baby there after baking. Oh and you can also divide dough in 4 and make smaller loaves if u like. Just bake 2 at a time.

I've actually made this once before and it was fantastic. Now I have a question: Can you make any of this ahead of time? I'd love to make the dough and chill, then let it rest the next day, fill and either bake then or bake the next day. Anyone have experience with this?

i had such high hopes for this with all the great reviews.   I'm from New Orleans, so I guess that was too much to expect.    FOund it to be bland and too "yeasty."

This was very good, although I left out the raisins. I would recommend decreasing the baking time or temperature, as mine turned out a little too well done & brown.

First my modifications (strictly for my taste preferences - it baked fine as written):  I cut the nutmeg in half,  I also cut the butter in the filling in half, and left out the raisins.  

Second a suggestion:  Leave off the icing, let it sit for a day or two (the hardest part) so it gets a little stale, then make french toast out of it.  Yummy!  If you are planning to do this I would recommend not forming it into a ring, it is easier to slice if straight.

This cake/bread was fantastic.  I just made it for Mardi Gras.  The whole family just loved it!  I would definitely make it again. I read the review about raisins not belonging in King Cake and left them out, but I'm going to add them next time as I like raisins. the frosting seems plain, but it was the perfect addition to the cake.  I highly recommend this King Cake.

Do NOT bake with the baby! Cut a small hole in side after it is cooled and frosted. I use root beer or sassafrass to flavor the frosting.

This tasted really good, great recipe.  I can't say if it's a true king cake or not, but it was delicious.  I do need to comment on other's comments...Rolling out this cake is not simple since it is bread dough.  Making one big braided bread results in too large a cake that doesn't cook through without modifying the baking time and temp.  The modified icing of milk, sugar, butter and vanilla was good, but use half the vanilla it calls for.  Otherwise, thanks to everyone for their useful comments!  Great recipe.

A little too sweet for my tastes, the dough was perfect though. Maybe the frosting + the colored sugar was just too much? Kind of tasted like a really sweet cinnamon roll. I used my bread machines dough setting to do the rising and the kneading.

Delicious cake/bread and yields sooo much more than 16 servings.  I turned the halves into one cake by baking it on a round baking stone.  Made a butter cream icing...would not advise it but the colors turned out wonderfully this way.  Used an old ring instead of a baby doll and hopefully no one will eat it!  Great instructions, thanks again!

i used this recipe last year and it was a big hit with my boys.  However i cut the dough in half and made two smaller cakes because i did not have a pan big enough to accomodate all that dough. Also, i topped mine with a cream cheese frosting dyed for mardi gras. I also seem to remember adding a coin to the cake as well for a prosperous year ahead.  Oh, i also did not add raisins. Here i am again geting ready to make my cakes for this year...great recipe!!!I recommend looking for a muffaletta recipe to go with this great dessert

I can't leave things alone.  I cut the recipe in half, didn't need 2.  Instead of butter in the filling, I used a block of cream cheese and 2 tbsp softened butter.  I would double it next time.  Super yummy!

Really like this cake, but I made the following alterations:     ~~~~~~ * I halved the pastry portion of the recipe because I only wanted to make one ring, but I left the measurements for the filling portion of the recipe as written because other reviewers said the recipe needed more filling. * I substituted cinnamon applesauce for butter (same amount) in both the pastry and filling. * I left out the raisins because I’m not a big fan. :) * I made the dough in my bread machine (omitting steps 1-3 of the recipe) using the ‘dough’ setting. * For the frosting I mixed 1/3 cup confectioners’ sugar with 1.5 tsp water and food coloring. I did three bowls of this so that I could have gold, green, and purple and it made just enough frosting.  ~~~~~~ I only gave this four stars because I'm not a fan of the frosting. I think a cream cheese frosting would be MUCH better.

Great recipe and relatively easy, especially with breadmaker on dough setting. I got rave reviews the two times I've made this recipe just this month. For the dough, I substituted whole wheat flour for 2 cups of the 5-1/2 c called for. I replaced all butter with applesauce and a bit of flaxseed meal.  I left out the raisins and made the filling thick and creamy, not crumbly.  I made the glaze with: 1 c. dry nonfat milk, 1/2 c. powdered sugar, and 1/4 c. BOILING water, then added some orange extract for flavor, blend until smooth. I made the colored sugar with about a 1/4c of plain sugar and just a couple of drops of food coloring (mix colors for purple before adding to sugar).

Basically, this tasted like a cinnamon roll.  The cake sure looked beautiful and was a big hit at our New Orleans Saints Super Bowl party!!  Having said that, it was really dry.  I did make it the day before and let it sit overnight, but covered in a cake dish.  So maybe that's how it got so dry.  I'm going to make another one, but fill it with cherry pie filling and see how that turns out.

Made it for a Mardi Gras party last night and this was a big hit.  Took longer to rise than I thought but was well worth the wait.  Omitted the raisins as others have suggested and used a small baby so put it under the slice.  Delicious!

Not as good as we had hoped. It didn't seem to raise very well.  We cooked the first half, and when it came out, we decided to let the second half raise longer...still very thin.  Not sure what went wrong. The filling was good, though, and the kids loved it.

I am a New Orleans native far from home in the frozen north, so needless to say I can't buy my own King Cake like we used to get from McKenzie's when I was growing up!  This king cake is AWESOME.  Much better than the overly-sweet filled ones that they make now.  Dough is moist and slightly heavy - perfect for a king cake.  I would like to try it without the filling to see how that would work, maybe braided too would be fun.  Thanks so much to the original poster for sharing so that I could have my King Cake in Idaho!

Mine definitly didnt turn out like a king cake but I still really liked it. It was more like a giant pin wheel.

This was labor intensive but excellent! It would make an ideal coffee cake, and it would be perfect for a brunch to feed a lot of people. I used baking raisins, so they were super plump.

This recipe was excellent.  I would not change a thing!  I just made 3 batches that made 6 king cakes and gave several to friends and family.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  I will definately share!!

I made this because my son can not have dye in his food.  His class was having a party at school and I wanted him to have a mardi gras cake also.  I skipped the sprinkles and used some dye free ones.   It was AWESOME!  The recipe was easy to make I was a little nervous after reading all the steps.  The house smelled wonderful as it was baking and this will definitely be a frequently used recipe in our home.  Great for a Sunday brunch too!  The dough was extremely easy to work with too!

Great Recipe!  I, too, skipped the raisins.  I needed a bit more water in the glaze to make it run.  I will use this dough as a base for breakfast breads in the future, too.

This turned out really well, but I didn't like the filling- I'll probably keep the dough and use a different filling next time.  By the way, its super easy to half this recipe (which I did) since it makes two cakes.

I had a Mardi Gras party last night and two of the guests were from New Orleans.  They loved this King Cake.  I did as a few other people suggested and used a different filling.  I found another recipe for King Cake on mardigras.com and used the filling part of that recipe.    It calls for cherry pie filling and a delicious cream cheese mixture.  Everyone at the party enjoyed the cake.  It is like bread--I felt like I was making cinnamon rolls.  If you want a more "cakey" texture, this is not your recipe.
