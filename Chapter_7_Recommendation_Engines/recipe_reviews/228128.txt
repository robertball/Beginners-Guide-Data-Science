Hubby and I both enjoyed this recipe. Very nice blend of spices. I used two cloves of garlic for added flavor. I didn't have raisins, so I used currants and they worked very well.  I suggest using a little less than 2 cups of broth. My quinoa was done and there was still quite a bit of liquid left which led to a bit of a mushy texture. The only change I would make is to use fresh cilantro. The 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro added no flavor. I loved the roasted red peppers mixed in and the crunch from the almonds.  This quinoa would also be good served cold the next day.

Outstanding flavors.  After the allotted time there was extra liquid as mentioned by another reviewer, I left the pot on med-low with the lid off and evaporated the extra, stirring a few times. Roasted my own peppers and a couple heads of garlic, then squeezed a few cloves into the dish since we love garlic.  The crunch of the nuts is necessary for some variation, so if you don't prefers nuts maybe add something else with some crunch. Served cold, this would be great with diced cucumber. I also thought it could be brightened up just a bit, so we served with crumbled feta atop. Will definitely make this again and look forward to having cold leftovers.

I really liked this recipe. My kids thought it was ok. Next time to make it more kid friendly I will use dried cherries and sunflower seeds instead of raisins and nuts. I also sauteed bell pepper with the onion (yellow) instead of using roasted pepper. Will definately make again.

This is so much better than I could have imagined. I used water because I didn't have broth, bottled roasted peppers and frozen cilantro. I also added a large sliced portabello mushroom to the onions in the beginning and you couldn't detect it later on. Its a great side dish and meal and I'm seriously considering adding it to the Thanksgiving table (the raisins remind me of stuffing for some reason!). I increased the seasonings slightly and I would add carrots next time. Thank you so much!

This was delicious! I didn't have a few ingredients like the cilantro, ginger, or almonds, but it was delicious either way!

This is the first dish with quinoa I've made.  Only change was to halve the recipe to 2 servings (these were generous, as a side could have been 3 to 4) add chopped mushrooms to saute,  used dried cranberries.  Ate a serving hot and felt like  the flavor was unremarkable, the cranberries and almond redeemed it and wished i had added more.  However, I couldn't put it down.  The next day I ate it cold, and wow.  The flavors had melded with just a touch of sweetness.  While eating quinoa left me picking birdseed from my teeth, the flavors in this dish served cold are  worth it.  Going on my summer meal rotation

Made it just like it says, and it turned out amazing! Think I might add a few more peppers and raisins next time.

With a couple of minor changes due to lack of certain ingredients, (ie: yellow roasted pepper instead of red, 3/4 cup quinoa and 1/4 cup pearl barley) I loved it. I think I overcooked the quinoa a little as this was my first time cooking it. All and all I will make it again!

Followed to a tee (minus cilantro) and came out OK. I suggest almost double the curry powder, use green onion, use 1/2 part fresh ginger & 1/2 part powder, and use chicken broth for added flavor (vegan does exist). Keeping on hand for sure!

It was weak - definitely needs more spices.  Also, the texture is a bit gloopy.  It has potential, I like the concept, but imo it's poorly executed.

Omitted Almonds as I had none.  Did not plan before  to make this, otherwise I would have purchased some. Used crushed red pepper as that was what I had.  Overall very good. A change from the curried quinoa from this site

This was great.  I thought I had curry powder in my cupboard, turns out I had paprika not curry. No worries I didn't use paprika. I used boil in a bag quinoa which worked great. I ate the living daylights out of this. Not gonna lie, I ate pretty much half in one sitting. Next time ( and oh yeah, there will be a next time) I will have curry powder!

Very easy to make and tasty! I would add even more of the spices next time; I think it could use more of a kick. The raisins add a nice sweetness to it.

Made this for Saturday night dinner. My husband and I both loved it! We ate it warm, not as a salad and used fresh cilantro. I had it for breakfast this morning with a fried egg on top. Also, I cooked dry chickpeas in my slow cooker. We will definitely make it again!

Loved it with the toasted almond slices, the fresh cilantro, and the chopped roasted red peppers.  Yum. Will make again. Had it with curry chicken.

very easy and tasty. subsituted pecans for almonds, and added a bit more quinoa and garbanzo beans to adjust for excess water that others talked about it and it came out perfect. house smelled great too.

Great quinoa side, will make again! I made the following changes: subbed chopped dates for raisins and subbed cashews for almonds. Eliminated garbonzos (none on hand) and added 2 large sauteed mushrooms. I increased all the spices by again half and added 1/4 tsp salt. Yummy!

This was another hit with my family.  The only change I made was to use black beans in place of garbanzos only because that's what I had.  I will definitely make this again and again.  I'm finding I very much love curry and have always loved ginger.  As a side note it is a good idea to rinse the quinoa well before adding it to any recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I have been trying recipes in an electric pressure cooker (Instant Pot) and this was a winner. I followed the recommended water for quinoa in a pressure cooker (1 1/2 cups) but otherwise I followed the recipe ingredients. Oh...I also used ground coriander instead of the cilantro.

Doubled the amount of raisins and hurry powder.  separately baked a couple chicken breasts dusted with curry.  Diced and added the baked chicken along with the quinoa .  
Mada a great one bowl meal.  
I have, in the past, also added diced zucchini and shrimp.

I made this as written with golden raisins and chicken broth. These changes did not alter the overall integrity of the recipe.

I love this. First time making anything with quinoa. I will definitely make this again.

This makes a very nice lunch dish! It is quick and easy to whip up. I used chicken broth since I had no vegetable broth. I also used kidney beans for the same reasons. Looking back, I probably would have added the kidney beans towards the end of the cooking to make them less mushy. I also would have used fresh red bell pepper instead of the roasted ones. I think it would have added some nice texture with the crunch.

I liked this recipe, but think it had too much curry powder.  We didn't have any so we used chili powder, and cut it way down because we don't like too much heat.  We could also have cut out the red peppers; I think that they are not necessary.  But the rest of the flavors are great.  We didn't have raisins, and didn't want so much sugar so we used slightly sweetened cranberries, and I forgot to toast the almonds, but it was still very good, thanks!

Great! I had everything except for cilantro. I love curry. I love quinoa. This is a no-fail side or main!

I recipe last night and it was really good. Very healthy and delicious.  Even my kids liked it. I made a mistake in using a real ginger because I didn't have the powder ones. it had some light bitter after taste from the ginger.

I just made this for the first time and slightly altered it (I already had the quinoa cooked, didn't saute onions and didn't have curry) but it was still delicious! It was even better the next day. I want to make it again but I want to follow the instructions. I'm sure it's even better. Very easy to make. Worthwhile recipe.

This was a great side dish!! I didn't have a fresh onion so I used onion powder. I added diced carrots and celery too.  We were also fresh out of almonds and raisins.  Orange flavored cranberries worked great.  I don't usually have vegetable stock so we used chicken instead and no added salt.  Even my pickiest eater gobbled it up.  This is a definite keeper!!!!

I doubled this recipe and it made quite a bit.  I ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and I still could eat more!  I did add more spices and salt to bring out the flavors.  Really delicious, thank you for this wonderful dish.

We liked this! Used a little more garlic than called for - just b/c we like garlic. I didn't have almonds so I used toasted pecans. Definitely liked the "crunch" that the nuts brought. Have only made a few quinoa recipes but this one is my favorite for sure!

So very tasty!  Took it to a friend's house for dinner and it was a big hit!  I omitted the cilantro -- otherwise made it as directed.

Tasty.  Lots of different flavors in there really give the quinoa a boost!
