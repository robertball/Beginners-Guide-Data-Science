In a pinch for a potluck, able to throw this together - used veggie meat (Morningstar breakfast patties) instead, and even layed pastry dough out flat on bottom and another layer on top of filling, pre-cut and baked!  Very Yummy!  Always have pastry dough handy in freezer :)

This was great. I read that a lot of reviewers had to increase the seasonings so i went ahead and used chorizo instead of plain sausage... there was no need to even think about messing with the seasonings. My husband loved it along with salsa!

really, really  good!  and very easy to make.  I only used half of the recipe though, as it was served as one of several appetizers for a party of 20.

Very tasty. I omitted the pork and added corn and kidney beans to the black beans. Also used pepperjack cheese and used salsa instead of tomato sauce. I had no problems with the puff pastry, just don't let it get too soft. Made 8 medium sized empanadas. Froze the leftovers. Will definitely make again!

I made these as part of a Halloween feast that was zombie themed. (they were made into "intestines", gross!) But despite their intentional gross appearance, they were a delicious hit that didn't last long! I've made them several times since then in a more conventional shape ;)

Fantastic recipe, we will make this often! My suggestion, double the recipe and freeze the extra for awesome easy meals later!

Only modifications were using of ground beef instead of pork and increasing the cumin, chili powder and crushed pepper by about 50%.  We also made our own dough; had more filling than dough so should have increased dough recipe by about 50% as well (recipe had 2.25 cups flour, so we should have increased to around 3.25).

Really good and easy to make. I did make some changes, starting with making 1/2 the recipe since I didn't need the full amount.  I'm vegetarian so I left out the pork and used a full can of black beans instead.  I had already starting making this when I realized that i didn't have tomato sauce so I used salsa instead, and it added fantastic flavor.  I really enjoyed this recipe, I ate it as a meal by adding a salad with margarita dressing (from this site) but I know these would make great appetizers for a party.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty. I used some left over pastry dough from a pie I made rather than the sheets. The stuffing was delicious. I wish I would have made the circles larger though, that way I could put more inside each empanada.

I didn't make them into circles, I just did squares to not waste the dough. These were fantastic. Flaky with just the right amount of stuffing. My boys loved them. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I followed this recipe closely but I instead filled 12 Goya Premade Empanada Disks (baked 400 for 15-20mins) - I only had a tablespoon of filling leftover so it was perfect. I also used about a cup of frozen mixed bell peppers instead of fresh. My husband, who just yesterday said he has only ever heard of dessert empanadas and was unsure of savory ones, ate 5! Will definitely make this again.

Only used one package of Puff Pastry and cut into 8 squares. Accidentally put the entire can of black beans in. Used ground chicken. And they STILL turned out great!

I made these for dinner and made 5 large empanadas instead of making small ones. I also used ground pork. It was incredible! I will make these for years to come!!

These were a complete HIT. I made then ahead and froze them. I used a Seal-a-meal to freeze them. They came out not as puffy as freshly baked, but I think better.

I added Morningstar Farms's Grillers crumbles into the bean mixture, as well as mexican-style cheese. The empanadas themselves were good, but I have no IDEA how this could make 40 empanadas out of two packages of the puff pastry. I could barely get 15. Needless to say I ended up with a lot of filling left over. Next time I think I'll cut that part of the recipe in half. Also, I found that working with the puff pastry when it's still partially frozen helps a lot. It's really hard to move without messing up the empanada when it's too soft.

Delicious!!! They were smaller than I expected so they took a little extra work, but they were worth it. These make a great appetizer for any party. I made some lager ones and we had them for dinner. The recipe is very versatile so you can easily substitute the meats or make them vegetarian. So yummy!!

Super tasty but also really time consuming to make.  I had about 15 guests and had a ton of these little guys left over  but no worries, my teenage boys ate them all after the party.  Super yummy with the guacamole and sourcream.  Also I didn't add the red pepper flakes because I had breast feeding moms in attendance and didn't want to make trouble for them lol.  Anyhoo, really yummy but give yourself pleanty of time to assemble these.

Yum! I used green bell pepper and pinto beans because they are what I had on hand but the filling is just great! I froze some in pie crust (trying to use up before it expires)... I think they will be great from frozen state too!

These were excellent, very time consuming but worth it.  Used 1 cup cheddar chesse and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese instead and doubled the green onions.  Made again but to save time instead of using the pastry shells we just put the meat-cheese mixture over white rice.

These were a major hit at a family gathering!  Next time I make them I will add more tomatoe sause and more cheese as they were a bit dry.  I also used the Empanada Dough recipe and followed the sugestions to add more water and shortening.  Serve hot.

I'm not sure what to make of all the positive reviews. The pastry sheets called for in this recipe were not very easy to work with. Too sticky. They also are not very fitting for the dish. They would be better for a dessert. The filling was okay, nothing special, but the pastry made it very odd and hardly worth eating.

I made and froze these three weeks in advance of my son's Rehearsal Dinner.  I must say that it took all of an hour plus.  I struggled with the puff pastry and was finally so frustrated that I stopped making the bite size empanada and made a big one for dinner from the rest.  I asked myself if  the empanadas were worth the effort.  I had the answer at the Rehearsal Dinner.  They disappeared so quickly that neither my husband or I even even had one.  People loved them! (Even my fussy son!)

I am guessing that these were great because they were gone before I even had one, and every one said they loved them. but my husband dousnt like spicy to much so I used a less hot pepper and no crushed red pepper and he said they were perfect.

I won't use as much cilantro as it calls for next time but it was a superb empanada besides that!

These were awesome!  Served them with chicken tortilla soup V from this site.  I substituted store bought pie dough instead of the puff pastry and they turned out great and saved me some time!

This is so delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and although laborious, totally worth it.  After I baked them, I stored them in the refrigerator.  When I wanted to reheat them, I microwaved for 30 seconds, popped them in the toaster oven, and the puff pastry puffed and crisped very nicely.  I have made a few times since and just put the filling in tortillas.  I have also substituted refried beans for the meat and it was quite tasty!  Thanks for the lovely recipe.  My husband was skeptical...but now says "I've never had a good empanada until now."

Super tasty! We used phyllo dough to make the wrapping easier and so the empanadas weren't overwhelmed by the breading.

These empanadas were so flavorful and delicious! After reading some reviews regarding the puff pastry, I used seamless Pillsbury dough sheets and turned out extremely well. I also added some Tobasco sauce for some more spice! I made some without pork and those were delicious as well! Besides a few tweaks to my own liking, this recipe was very delicious and surprisingly easy. The prep time was long, but it was not complicated at all. If you have the time, I highly recommend it!

I followed the recipe amount and it made 4 large square empanadas by cutting each sheet into 2 rectangles.  I filled each with about a 1/2 cup of the bean mixture.  Made a great dinner.

I used lean steak cut into cubes instead of ground pork and it was delicious.  Omitted the red pepper for less spice, but still very flavorful.

Delicious! Used turkey instead of pork and made a few with guacamole inside. Yummy.

These were delicious, but in an effort to prepare ahead, I made these several hours before my dinner party.  By the time they were ready to be served, the puff pastry had fallen a little and was greasy.  Next time I'll try rolling it a little thicker, and baking them at the last minute.

Amazing!  All three kids and hubby devoured them.  My 2 year old was eating the filling out of the bowl with a spoon almost faster than I could make the empanada.  Followed the recipe as written and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe.  I have made them twice and the labor seems to be loved by everyone.  I really don't get to eat many. 

I have not worked too much with puff pastry, but it was a little difficult to work with and may have taken me a little longer than normal to do.  I think after practice I would be able to make these very quickly.
