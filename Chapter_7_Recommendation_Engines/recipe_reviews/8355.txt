I tripled the recipe to bake in a full sheet pan for the homeless shelter where I volunteer. I used half butter and half margarine and half brown sugar and half white sugar in both parts of the recipe. I found the center a bit jiggly after 40 minutes so I turned off the heat and let it sit for another 10 minutes. it was perfect. These bars were well liked by everyone.

Love this recipe! The complaints I read could probably be eliminated by calling this Pecan Bars. It’s really in between a cake & bars. Yummy!

I made mine last night in a different size pan. I don’t really see the layer difference as in the first picture. I am not a pecan pie lover but found this pleasantly not too sweet. It had a texture of a coffee cake.

Its not bad, just a bit bland when it comes to taste and texture. Also, my “batter” was really hard, no way I could have poured it or something. I was wondering if there was some liquid ingredient missing.
