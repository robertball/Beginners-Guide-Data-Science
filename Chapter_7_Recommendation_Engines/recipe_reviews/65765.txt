Yummy!  I brought this to work one day for a luncheon and everyone loved it.  It re-heated very well.

This is amazing! Be sure to use the Gruyere cheese....it is what makes it beyond your typical Potato Gratin. The only thing I did different was add garlic, it added the perfect touch.

Very good.  I just used white potatoes.  Was a great leftover.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this did not turn out the way I thought it would have. (I omitted the black olives, but I'm sure that had nothing to do with it.) I will try it again and edit my review.

I served this for Easter and it was delicious.  I forgot to pick up the gruyere, so I used swiss in place of it.  It was good.  The gruyere would be even better
