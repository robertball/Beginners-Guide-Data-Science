I used the general idea in this recipe, but modified it because I baked it in the oven.  I boiled water first with the chicken boillon cube and a bay leaf.  Then added the sliced potatoes for 10 minutes.  I added the onion with about 5 minutes left.  I then placed these in a 2.8 quart corningware covered casserole (removed the bay leaf.)  I added about a cup of the water from bioling the potatoes to the casserole.  I then mixed the flour, milk, and a tablespoon of parsley in a small bowl.  Then added 3/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar.  I placed this in a saucepan and melted the mixture together on medium heat.  Once this was melted I poured this over the sliced potatoes.  I then put this in the pre-heated oven (350 degrees) for 20 minutes.  With about 5 minutes left, I stirred in 3/4 cup of sour cream and sprinkled an additional 1/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar and a dash of paprika.  This turned out absolutely wonderful.

I can't believe how good this turned out.  I did add more seasoning.  A lot more salt, garlic powder and pepper.  I am not one of the lucky ones with two ovens so a dish that turns out this good in the microwave is a total winner.  Don't slice the potatoes too thin or it will be really mushy.  Thanks for our new family favorite!

AWESOME recipe!  I followed this to the letter, but used real minced onions rather than the dried. I don't know if it's the garlic or the sour cream or probably both that sets this off, but this was much better than I had anticipated.  Kudos to you for sharing!

I used the oven to make this. I first boiled the potatoes with the chicken boullion and onions (I used real onion). I did not add garlic. I melted the cheese, milk, sour cream, etc in a pan and then poured over the potatoes, before placing in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes. I sprinkled more cheese and paprika on top as suggested by another reviewer. It tasted very good but was too watery. Next time I will use less milk/water =)

This recipe was great!  It was scalloped potatoes in a 1/2 hour.  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 an onion, a bit more garlic, pepper and finished off in oven to brown top.

Awesome.  So easy to make w/ cuisinart food processor and so fast.  Made w/ fresh onions.  Might even be better in the oven, next time if I have more time

GREAT!! My family loved these....Instead of dried minced onion, I thinly sliced a medium onion and cooked it with the potatoes from the beginning.  They were subtle, yet gave a tiny bit of crunch. My onion-phobic daughter never even knew they were there :) I must fess up that I used a full cup of cheese though -- 1/2 in with the sour cream and the other 1/2 on top.  I will skip the extra salt next time (but I liked it this wasy!).  Definitely a keeper!!

Oh my!  Who would have ever thought that it was this easy and fast to make delicious potatoes.  I made them for dinner in probably 20 minutes, since I cut the recipe in half.  Now, I wish I had made the full serving, because the leftovers would probably be out of this world.  This is definitely a keeper in my house and I'm now planning what meal I can make them with next.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

YUM!  I've been looking for a cheesy potato recipe for a long time.  If you like sour cream, this is the one for you.  My only suggestion is to add more cheese if you like cheese.  Thanks for sharing!

I too served these for a large family dinner party, but unlike the other reviewer, our family loved them.  These were the first to disappear from the buffet table.  I doubled the recipe and probably should have tripled it.  Thanks Jeannine for this wonderful recipe.

Good and quick! I scaled it down to 3 servings and they took about 15 minutes to cook from start to finish. After pouring in the flour sauce i layered the potatoes in 4 ramekins. So, a few slices of potatoes, shredded cheese & sour cream all layered together. Could have used more salt. Then cooked until cheese melted. I used a provolone with parmesan cheese blend since i had no cheddar.

Substituted a 30 oz bag of defrosted frozen hash browns. Since I was needing to make these gluten free I omitted the flour and instead added 4 T of cheese spread to the 3/4 cup of  milk (or half and half) with seasonings,  microwaved for 1 minute and mixed well.  Also omitted sour cream and increased cheese to 1 1/2 cups (1/2 c shredded cheddar, 1/2 c shredded velveeta cheese, and 1 cup of small cubed velveeta cheese). Mixed in milk and cheese spread mixture with potatoes and added the cubed velveeta cheese, mix. Placed in 2 buttered 8x8 casserole dishes and microwaved each for 10 minutes. Let sit for 10 minutes. Mix together shredded cheeses and on top of pototoes, place in microwave for an additional 5 minutes, covering dishes with plastic wrap, venting on one side. Or cover with foil and place in oven for 10-15 minutes at 350 degrees. Test for doneness, return to oven if neccessary, potatoes should be soft.  Potatoes were cheesy, creamy and YUMMY!

I loved this recipe! I have been looking for a cheesy potato recipe and this is it. It took about 20 minutes to cook because I was cooking other things also. I also added some bacon bits after I added the cheese. Best cheesy potatoes recipe ever!!

When I print recipes I often put on note on it Ryan likes.  Meaning my son liked it.  He ate these last night, looked at me and said "write down Ryan really likes!".    I added the bouillon granules in the milk, by mistake.  But it was great.  I used 1% milk and low fat sour cream. Fresh minced onion and one crushed garlic in the potates while cooking.  Then a little garlic salt in the milk with some pepper because we like garlic.

This was a great dish, even though I forgot to add the onion!  It wasn't quite cheesy enough for my personal taste, but that will be an easy fix.  My husband loved it and it was also very easy to make.

Sooo glad I found this recipe - will use this one again for sure!  Easy and fast way to make great tasting potatoes.  I scaled the recipe back to 6 servings for our fam & used a 2 qt dish and it made more than enough, but the leftovers will be great.  Next time I should peel the potatoes, though.  Could also get by with using a little less sour cream than the recipe calls for.

Made this Christmas Eve and it was good but could be better. I always prepare recipes exactly as suggested by submitter but I found a little room for improvement. You may want to add some butter, real bacon bits, some chopped green onions, fresh cracked pepper. I think it would add to the flavor and increase presentation appeal by adding color. I'll try it that way next time. Don't get me wrong..this recipe was good..but I think it could be better.=)

Great idea, and nice creamy texture at the end.  I only made a small amount for myself, cooked in the microwave for 8 minutes then baked in the oven for thirty.  I am sure I would've liked them just nuked though, but I really felt the microwaving first did not compromise the traditional scalloped potato flavor, and this cuts the normal hour plus baking time down to a reasonable 25-30 minutes to get a nice golden crust on top.  Thanks for the quick and easy way to make these kind of potatoes!

This potatoe casserole is fabulous.  I did add chives and bacon bits with the milk, flour salt and garlic powder.  My son and his family came for dinner, 10 year old loved it.  recipe is for 8, we had six people and the bowl was clean, not a piece for left overs, I will make this again and again. thank you Jeannine.

These were brain-dead easy to make and SO good!  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings as it was just my husband and I and our two small children.  I followed the recipe to a T with one exception...and it wasn't intentional.  I mis-read the recipe method and combined the sour cream with the milk and poured it all over the potatoes, topped with cheese and cooked for another 4 minutes.  The end result was very good...even the kids ate it and that's saying something!!

The flavor was great but I will have to tweak a few things next time I make the dish.  A few of my potato slices stuck together and didn't cook as well as others (they weren't crunchy but they weren't quite done). So make sure to hand spread the layers and be careful when stirring. Also if your potatoes are med sized I recommend cutting the slices into bite sizes before cooking. I used bouillion cubes and boiled them in the water before adding to the potatoes to microwave.  I also used fresh minced white onion and closer to 3/4 c sharp cheddar cheese.  Very creamy and tasty sauce!

I don't normally cook in the microwave but decided to give this a try.  I followed the recipe without any modifications and thought they were delicious.  I will definitely make again but next time will use real onions and garlic rather than the powder.  Just my personal taste.

Awesome! I made these for a block dinner party and they were great. I cooked it in the microwave as suggested, but then finished it off in the oven at 350 for about 25 minutes.
I added extra sour cream for a total of 1 1/2 cups, black pepper, garlic powder and a package of sharp wisconsin & vermont cheddar cheese with bacon.  The additional ingredients make it a little soupy until baked and then turns out nice and creamy and yummy!

These were great. I didn't measure my garlic powder and I used season salt instead of regular salt. Great flavor. Will make again. I think I may have cut my potatoes too thin cause most of them fell apart and were not in slices anymore, but we didn't care. Also may have used a little more cheese than called for. Just put enough so the whole top was covered and then microwaved 2 more minutes.

very very nice if you are watching your sodium check the amt in your fav brand of chick granules  some brands being very high in sodium    you can safley omit the 1/2 tsp of salt without any sacrifice in taste

My mother sent me this recipe and I loved it.  I took some to work and let my friend try it and she loved them too. My son who is a picky eater loved them too. I'm making a second batch tonight, I made them last night and they are gone. I used regular onions - not minced, everything else I did just like the recipe says.

I was NOT at all impressed.  I made these for a dinner party and was almost too embarressed to serve them, but had no other choice.  Don't waste your time!!

This came out awesome!  I doubled the amount of minced onions and added chives along with the sour cream.  Rather than microwaving it for 4 minutes at the end, I put it in the oven at 350.

super good potatoes.  I used red skin potatoes and left the skins on.  I also used colby cheese for the top.
