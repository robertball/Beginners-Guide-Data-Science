This is the first air fryer recipe that I have found that I really like!!  I recently purchased an Emeril Lagasse power air fryer, and generally speaking have found it lacking. Every time I followed one of their protein recipes, I found the protein to be undercooked and rubbery. That did not happen w this recipe. That being said I did make some adjustments. I lengthened the cooking time to 25 minutes. 15 mins side one and 10 mins for side two. Regarding the croutons I felt that a bit labor intensive so instead I used panko bread crumbs combined w a 1/4c of Parmesan and 1tsp of garlic powder. And I only needed one egg to coat 4 chops. The time may just be my Emeril air fryer but it worked perfectly. It also defaults to 400* for air fry setting so I left it at that. But the basics of this are great, and I will definitely do it again!

I just got an air fryer yesterday and needed to try it out (beyond just some frozen taquitos) :). This was quite easily the best pork chops I've made, super moist! I used panko bread crumbs with garlic salt and onion powder instead of the croutons and Cajun seasonings (didn't have those).

A simple, yet very tasty recipe!  I used thick cut chops (about 1.5 inches thick), and found that 11 minutes per side were necessary, to achieve an internal temp of 160 degrees.  Crisp on the outside & juicy on the inside.

Very good!  Next time I will add more Cajun seasoning.  We would have liked a bit more spice.  But the crust was crunchy and the pork chops tender and cooked through.

Washed and seasoned them. Then let them sit in the fridge until I was almost done fixing everything else. I used Panko seasoned breadcrumbs after the egg wash/flour dip. Came out juicy, tender and crunchy.

Pork chops were juicy and tasty.  I didn't have croutons so I made a breading with the cajun seasoning, Italian bread crumbs, garlic powder & Parmesan cheese.

I love this recipe! I made it for my husband's birthday dinner and he loved them too.  I did use smoked sweet paprika and added some basil.  They are tender, juicy, and bursting with flavor in every bite.

Tasted good but I had to cook them for 20 minutes For them to be done and tender. I followed directions carefully and my chops were only 1/2 inch thick.  Did I do something wrong?  Will make again.

I agree with the other comments.  These are then juiciest pork chops I ever had.  I had 1" think chops and I had to cook them 3 minutes longer per side to get the internal temp up to 170.
