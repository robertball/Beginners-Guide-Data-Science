I found a similar recipe like this one that also called for a small can of green chilies and a can of chopped black olives.I tweaked the recipe and everyone loves it.I took a package of chorizo,cooked it and drained as much grease out as possible with several paper towels.Allow it to cool completely before adding it to mixture.The chorizo will give a spicy bite to it.Not too much though.I also add some ground cumin maybe 2 teaspoons.However since I use the chorizo I do not put in a package of taco seasoning.I do put the cumin, tsp garlic powder,tsp salt.Tip:if I have time alloted I prepare the mixture the day before keeping it refrigerated and spread the tortillas the day of serving.Then chill them for at least 2 hours before cutting into 1 inch to 1 1/2inch bites.Just wanted to share my twist on a popular finger-food.

I have had a similar recipe for years, nice twist to add taco seasoning.  I also add thinly sliced deli hm (Black Forest), canned green chilis and sometimes black olives. -- Dan

used too much taco seasoning - not whole packet. Other would be good but add some peppers and green onions

With this recipe, instead of doing the taco seasoning, I put in diced ortega chilis and it is really yummy!   They are the hit at the party!

i add shredded colby or chedder cheese. sometimes i substitute salsa for the taco seasoning. however, i make them the night before and refrigerate them, so they are easier to cut. overall good snack at party and simple to make.

I have made these 3 times now, trying desperately to make them work since they got such great reviews. They taste good, but the presentation is unappealing. Every time I make them, they just lose all shape when I slice them and the filling just oozes out all over the place and they look so messy on the plate that no one ever gives them a chance. I think I'll have to write them off my list.

Nothing fancy here, just a quick little snack that takes minutes to make.  Used AR's Taco Seasoning 1 instead of the packaged taco seasoning.  Fun for kids and great for a buffet table.  Keep this one in mind for next year's Super Bowl pig-out!  If all adults, I'd add some chopped red jalape√±o peppers for a little color and a little kick.  Thanks FootballMom.

Made these for my work potluck.  They were easy to assemble and they went quick.  Next time I won't add black olives, they made them taste a little strange in my opinion.

I would use less taco mix as it turned out a little salty.

This was a hit at the appetizer party we went to last night and I'll be making them again! I didn't have any green onions, so added finely diced green pepper and then sprinkled the tortillas with a little bit of grated cheese before rolling up. The secret really is to chill these well before trying to cut them.
