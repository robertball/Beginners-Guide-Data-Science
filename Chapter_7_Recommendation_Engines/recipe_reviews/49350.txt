Very tasty!  I scaled back to 4 servings :-) and used peanut oil.  As I was heating the oil I tossed in about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it some more spice and I ended up omitting the black bean sauce because they looked so good as is I just plain forgot to add it.  Would be good with some toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on near the end, too.

I can't believe I was able to make this delicious asian dish! I've never tried making anything like this before, and it turned out marvelously! I scaled it back to 4 servings and, since I don't have a wok, used a great big fry pan--it worked great! I covered it for the last 10 minutes and let it 'steam' and it seemed like it cooked the string beans more thoroughly.

I have always love this dish when eating out at Chinese restaurants. It was really great to discover this recipe so that I could make it at home whenever I want. Sometimes I add cooked chicken breast or shrimp to this dish if I am craving some protein.

This recipe made a full meal when I added shrimp, snow peas, and shiitake mushrooms.  I divided all the ingredients by 4, it made 4 servings for my boyfriend and I.

I've made this twice as a side dish, scaling the recipe WAY back. I seem to have a problem with the ginger and garlic scorching before the black bean sauce is added, and then the black bean sauce doing the same. I'm not sure what the remedy is. The second time I tried tossing a bit of water in with the sauce, and it may have helped a little. Nevertheless, the recipe does taste great. I LOVE chinese-style green beans. I am still hoping to find a way to keep everything but the beans from scorching on me. Thanks!

After 30 minutes cooking, the beans were still crunchy! I can't even imagine how long it would take to make 40 servings! Could make this again but would definitely blanch or steam the beans prior to stir-frying them.

This recipe is terrific! I was having a craving for stir fry beans and this tastes very authentic to me. I scaled it to two servings since I only had 3/4 lbs of fresh green beans. It was so flavorful I sat and ate almost the whole bowl myself! Thanks for sharing this recipe Jackie.

This was superb.. even cold the beans were tasty. I served this with Szechaun Shrimp from this site and really enjoyed my dinner. Next time I think I might try this with a mix of black bean and hoisin sauce.

(As stated, this recipe makes 40 servings.) I usually omit the garlic because there is already plenty in the garlic & black bean sauce I use. This is a very quick, easy and tasty dish. Thanks!

This is an easy quick dish I serve with Chicken Teriyaki and rice. Not exactly the same as in a restaurant, but close enough.  My kids are picky, buy this is one of the few vegetable dishes they enjoy.  Definitely omit the salt and adjust seasoning to your own taste.

An excellent recipe! I used to calculator and cut it down to 4 servings. I did blanch the beans (4 minutes in boiling water then plunge them into ice water to stop the cooking) so they were cooked yet still crunchy. This way, I just had to warm them up once they got into the wok and I didn't have to worry about actually cooking them and scorching the garlic and ginger in the meantime.If you do blanch them first, make sure you roll them around in a towel and get them as dry as possible - otherwise they will spatter and spit once you add them to the wok with the hot oil. 
  I didn't have the black bean sauce so I added probably close to 1/4 c of soy sauce instead. I did add salt as well. It was kind of strange tasting them while cooking. To me, they didn't have much taste but once they got to the table, they were bursting with flavor! The famly gobbled them up and declared them delicious! That is good enough for me!

Quite good.  Really just like what you'd get at a Chinese restaurant.  Next time, though, I'll skip the salt.  The black bean sauce is salty enough; this dish doesn't need the additional salt.

I used a reduced recipe for this. I followed directions specifically. The seasoning became like tar in the pot. I ended up having to rinse the final product to avoid serious flavor issues. After I rinsed the beans, the seasoning was still quite strong. So what's the deal? Not sure if I could have done something differently as I followed directions to the letter.

It was kind of tangy and funky tasting but that may be because I used the wrong black bean sauce. I couldn't find it, and the guy at Trader Joe's directed me to black bean dip. This may have altered the dish too much.

My husband loved this! My daughter loves chinese green beans but these wasn't it. I also picked up the wrong black bean sauce and wanted the ones with chunky beans in them. I don't think the flavors will change but I just like it for texture and looks.

I thought these were quite good, but my only complaint is that they were slightly bland.  It may be because I had to make my own black bean sauce (I couldn't find it anywhere!).  I used a black bean sauce recipe from another site because I was desperate!  I will make this again when I am able to go to an Asian store to get the black bean sauce!

This is really easy to make and my husband loves it! I suggest steaming the green beans a bit before sauteing them in oil since they can still be a bit too al dente for my taste. Otherwise this is an impressive, yet simple dish!

This was OK. The kids didn't like it. Hubby and I ate it, but agreed it wasn't something we wanted again. The sauce was very clumpy which made some bites fairly pungent. The beans were too crunchy, even though I cooked them longer than called for. I'm glad I tried it though.

Very good recipe. I, too, didn't have the black bean sauce, but enjoyed these nevertheless. I also used fresh ground ginger with garlic. Will make again. Very quick. I used frozen long beans from Sams's Club.

Loved it!  Will for certain be making this again.  Scaled the recipe down to a serving of 5 and added 1/2tsp of red pepper flakes for some added zing and flavour.

I didn't have the fresh green beans.  I substituted  frozen and followed the recipe.  This recipe was better than the green beans that I usually get at the restaurant.  I will make it again, and again.

Quite good.  Since my friend who requested green beans made like they make it at our favorite Chinese buffet wanted it with a teriaki sauce, and we couldn't find a black bean sauce at our grocery, I made a homemade teriaki instead. (Soy sauce, vinegar, honey, peach syrup, combined to taste, about 2 tbsp of the first two and 1 tbsp of the last two).  I really love black bean sauce and think it would have been better as written, but it did turn out remarkably similar to our buffet's offering, so my friend was pleased.

This recipe was really good. I'm allergic to ginger so I left that out, I also left out the black bean sauce. I did add a little bit of chopped bacon though and... WOW! Super tasty!!
Also, I recommend steaming the beans for a little while before cooking them until they are just slightly tender, I found that they fried better.

I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more without the black bean sauce. The smell really bothered me and wasn't appetizing. I may have felt differently about this if someone else had cooked it far away from me, but as of now, I am traumatized and still trying to get this odor out of my apartment. 

I would give it another try and skip the black bean sauce next time.

Delicious!  I made this as a side dish to go with potstickers.  I couldn't find the black bean sauce so I finished the beans with a little bit of potsticker dipping sauce at the end.  They would have been great without it but the sauce did give them a nice tang.  Will make again!

Our local store didn't have black bean sauce, so we used a combination of soy sauce & oyster sauce; it was still very good, though!

I love Chinese green beans but these weren't quite what I was expecting.  The sauce seemed to be missing something.  I probably won't make these again.

I used Lee Kum Kee black bean sauce and as written this recipe is much much much too salty.  Inedible.  Perhaps another sauce would be better but I cannot recommend this recipe at all unless it is modified as some of the other reviewers have suggested by cutting the bean sauce with hoisen sauce.   Sorry.

These were all right.  Not exactly like what I've had in Chinese restaurants.  I'd probably just order out for Chinese than do this dish again.

Good basic flavor but will probably cut back on the black bean sauce next time and cook a bit longer.  I like mine crunchy so I pulled them off the heat a little sooner than I should have.  Might have cooked the bbs down a bit more.  Guess we'll see next time.  Served this with "Sesame Beef Bites" over "Quick Chinese-Style Vermicelli" from this site.

Everyone loved the green bean stir fry. I made my own black bean sauce, with a can of black beans I had in the closet. Guests who normally don't eat green beans loved it!

I add 1/4 more black bean sauce than called for and make sure the beans are REALLY tender (almost limp).  My husband can't stop eating them!  I made this with just 4 pounds of green beans, but even that amount was more than my modest wok could hold.  Next time I'll go with just 2 pounds - or get a bigger wok!

We scaled it down to 4 servings. We made it with frozen green beans and it was way too salty.  We did not care for this. I won't be making it again.

Excellent. I scaled this back to 8 servings and the results were wonderful. The black bean sauce is an unexpected but very, very good final touch and the mix of flavours combines beautifully to create a great side dish. I will certainly make this again.

At my Asian buffet restaurant, I always get two servings of these - so I'm glad to get a recipe that's close.  I am out of black bean sauce, so I used about a T. of soy sauce and cut the salt a bit.  Used a lid for a bit to soften the beans and added toasted sesame seeds at the end.  Yummy.

I agree with the last review: just ok.  Maybe fermented black beans would be better than black bean sauce.  But I doubt I will make this recipe again.
