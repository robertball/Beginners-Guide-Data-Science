I followed this recipe exactly and the dough barely rose at all.  Its like unlevened bread.  It still tastes ok, but something has got to be off in the ingredients- I dont know what.

These rolls taste really good, but I tried the recipe twice, and both times, it came out really heavy; it hardly rose at all. Maybe I need to go lighter on the flour?

Great recipe!! I changed the temperature to 350 degrees instead.
Use a non-stick sheet instead of using cooking spray, because the bottom will get burnt.  Other than that, excellent recipe...authentic filipino dinner rolls!

It's ok. Maybe I did not something wrong but it didn't taste like an authentic pandesal.

The first time I tried this, I overworked the bread and made MONAY rolls instead. I tried it a second time, taking care not to overwork the dough and increase the proofing time, but the bread still came out heavy. I'm going to hope the third time's the charm, but will have to increase the yeast for a lighter bread. I opted to give this a 4-star review because it made such good MONAY bread that I'll be using the original recipie again. Thanks Kim for the multi-purpose recipe.

These tasted really 'milky', even though I only had 1/2 cup milk and subbed the rest with water. i ended up making 24 smaller rolls, cuz my Filipino maid kept telling me to make them smaller when I was shaping them,even she said they were yummy!!XD

Homemade pan de sal is difficult to find and this came close.  It came out heavy the first time.  But the second time was better.  I've tried rolling out the dough and spreading ube (purple yam) in the middle and rolling it up and baking it.  Tastes just like bread from the filipino bakeries!  Thanks!

Thanksgiving morning I realized that I didn't quite have the 6 cups of all purpose flour required for this recipe, so I substituted bread flour to make up the difference (@ 1 1/2 cups).  These came out perfect.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy them, especially slathered with butter.  They were quite easy to prepare, yet made the holiday just that much more special.  Although the prep time stated is 2 hours, you only actually handle the dough for @ 20 - 30 minutes.  The remaining time the dough is rising.  Not much time invested for an end result so good.  You should definitely try this recipe!

This recipe would be a lot better I think if it were made with bread flour instead of all purpose. I make bread regularly, and this one came out way too dense, even after it rose in the oven. The flavor is wonderful, but it gets lost in the thickness of the bread. I will try this recipe again, but with the right flour.

I think the recipe should suggest to proof the yeast before using.  My dough would not rise the 1st or 2nd time, but it did in the oven!  I wish I would have known about proofing the yeast.  My boyfriend, who is filipino, did like them!  For my american taste, I put honey butter on top before and after baking.  That was yummy.  And cook on the highest rack in the oven between temp of 350-375.

Although I'm not Filipino, i grew up eating pan de sal, our neighbor owned a Filipino Bakery and we enjoyed many baked treats from her kitchen.  This is an excellent pandesal recipe.  I ommitted the baking powder (you don't need both).  It rose beautifully baked at 350 came very fluffy.  Family devoured the rolls.  Proof your yeast before using it.  I always by fresh active-dry and keep it refriderated to make it last longer.  Thanx for the recipe.

To everyone saying the bread came out dense. 

I had that trouble too the first 4 times I made it (-_-*) , but don't knead it on the counter. Knead it in the bowl. I found that when I kneaded it in the bowl, it didn't become dense from overflouring. 

Also, when I pulled it out of the oven, I slathered on the butter. Then I sprinkled it lovingly with some salt, sugar, and bread crumbs. You would be AMAZED how those 4 little things make a much more tasty roll! And the salt was less than a 1/4 tsp, so you don't have to be so scared about it being really high in sodium. 

:)

Great recipe!  I've never thought of making them before and they turned out just like the ones I've grown up with.  It's pretty scary that I can make these for the family when ever someone wants some!  They're so addicting.

I tried a different recipe of pan de sal and it came out a bit hard on the outside but soft and tasty on the inside. Then I tried this recipe and it came out so much better. Now I dont have to buy it from the Philippine Bread House anymore. Thanks so much.

ran out of all purpose flour and used cake flour instead.  also used butter to coat dough. and it came out great!  gone in no time.  i even stuffed the dough with ham and cheese (bite size) right before putting in the oven.  baked at 375 for 15-20 min until top was lightly golden brown.

Great bread that stales slowly (still soft 4 days later).  Went over well at a Mother's Day brunch - all ages enjoyed it.  Very rich and silky texture.

I have been wanting to make pan de sal for a long time. I scoured the internet for a pan de sal recipe that is similar to the pan de sal I grew up with back home. So I made a big batch of these and was very impressed! I gave some to a friend and she thought they were store-bought. She was very surprised when I told her that they were homemade!
