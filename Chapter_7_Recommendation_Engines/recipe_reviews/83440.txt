First of all I have to make a reference to those that said this recipe was bland.  Rice as most of us know doesn't have a lot of flavor to begin with and will also absorb flavor just like noodles will.  Cabbage also doesn't have a lot of flavor.  So if you are someone who likes things to have a lot of flavor and zip or zest this needs to have a few things added to it.  I always add my own blend of seasonings to any recipe I make.  Here is what I did to make the meal tasty.  I used everything in the recipe, but instead of canned tomatoes I diced up a fresh tomato.  I also added plenty of salt, some pepper, garlic, 1/2 cup of shredded pepper jack cheese and 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese.  I didn't use the olive oil.  Everyone in the family loved it.  Including my kids!

Wow!!!!! I was looking for a recipe today that contained cabbage. I thought this looked great and decided to make it. It is excellent. The only things I did different was use minute rice because that is all I had on hand and made double what I should have on accident. It still is very yummy with the extra rice and will be great for my vegetarian friend coming over for St. Patty's Day. She will not eat anything with meat. Thanks for helping me out. A+++

I made a few changes to this recipe and it was awesome! I used dices tomatoes with italian spices and rice a roni long grain and wild rice (cooked to package directions)  and added some hot itailian sausage and seasoned grilled chicken breast instead of using the jalapeneos. I also diced the cabbage instead of shredding it and cooked it 20 min longer. My husband as well 3 and 5 years old loved it and made it a main dish instead of a side. i will definatally make it again but next time i will try shrimp instead of the meat.

Awesome recipe!  I added some ground turkey to it to make it the meal instead of a side dish.  It's great either way.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I used 1.5 fresh medium tomatoes and diced one fresh jalepeno, and added salt to taste to make up for the salt that would have been in canned veggies. I also used brown rice, as I had some the right amount left over from a previous meal. It was quite tasty, in a simple sort of way, and the random jalepenos kind of made it fun. It wasn't too spicy, but just right for both the adults and the kids. I'll use this one again!

This was great!
I have been looking for something to do with that cabbage in my fridge! I didn't have tomatoes on hand, but I did have hot salsa. I was hesitant to add it, but I'm glad I did! I used more olive oil as well. Other reviews said they cooked this a lot longer. I had the whole meal done in less than 20 minutes. I diced the cabbage, and also flavored the rice with butter and salt before adding it to the mix. Will definitely make again!

I liked it a lot.  I used red cabbage and besides that I pretty much followed the instructions.  It was tasty and filling.

this did not work for me.  I have always cooked cabbage with sufficient liquid to cook down. Took total of 45 minutes and the cabbage was still crisp.I used a can of diced tomato with jalapenos already incorporated in place of the jalapenos rings.Would not try again.

No No No.  This just did not work.  It was very bland even with the jalapenos.  The rice turns to mush and it is a lot of work for something we threw in the trash.  Big waste of time and food

Love this recipe! I've been looking for a cabbage recipe & this is it.  I used brown rice instead of white but followed everything else the same. I am a jalapeno fanatic so this was great.  Fully enjoyed.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made this tonight and it was excellent. The only change I made was to cut the jalapenos down to 1/4 cup for the kids sake. I will be making this again. Thanks!

Loved this dish! Didn't have a problem with cabbage cooking down in 10 minutes, just finely shredded it and cooked on low heat in a large cast iron pot. Also used jalape単o rings from a jar and think fresh jalape単os may make the dish taste even better. I do not recommend using the can combination of the tomatoes and jalape単os. As for others who thought the dish was bland - I was raised on a low-salt diet and this dish was great. If you love salt this dish may not be for you.

Yum! I made this two ways. Once as directed, delicious. I also made a simplified version for the kids - no tomatoes or pepper rings. I thought theirs was bland, but they liked it.

I liked the kick this dish has from the jalape単o, I think the cabbage needs to be cooked longer though, it was a little to crisp for my liking, but overall not a bad low calorie dish, I will make again.

My husband loved this recipe! It was easy and flavorful. The jalapeno peppers definitely added to the dish (even though it seemed kind of weird to add them). I do not think you need to cook the cabbage a full 10 minutes. I used rice made in our rice cooker. My 3 and 2 year olds even ate this dish!

I made this recipe as is, and it definitely needs a little more flavor.  Next time I'm going to add more garlic, and some ground turkey.  It's worth making again with some additions.

2 teens, dad & I all really liked this dish.  Easy to prepare: I used left-over rice and had it simmering in no time.  I thought it would have been nice to serve quarters of fresh lime with it!  (Didn't have any on hand; next time!!)

Very good recipe for a tasty main dish in a short amount of time. I used half a cabbage (4 cups of shredded cabbage) for this recipe and 3 fresh tomatoes. I also added 1/4 cup of parmesan and 1/2 cup of cheddar/pepper jack cheese and the dish was quite good.  One confusing thing about the recipe is that cabbages can vary quite a bit in size. This week, the cabbages that I obtained from the store were rather large. In previous weeks, they can be pretty small. It is probably a good idea to state how many cups of shredded cabbage you are using for a recipe.

You can eat this dish just like it is and it's very good.  I also modified it to eat as a casserole/main dish.  I added 1# ground beef, 1 t. each oregano, garlic powder, and basil; 1 14 oz. can tomato sauce.  Stir all together until hot, spoon into casserole dish, top with cheese, and bake 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  My husband and chidren loved it.

I used brown rice and a can of rotel and 6 oz. of tomato paste.  Very good and a little spicy (with the rotel)  A nice way to use cabbage and sneak in brown rice

Made it, turned it into an Italian cabbage and rice. Added extra garlic, bell peppers, crushed red pepper flakes, a lot of salt, pepper, and italian spices. Added Rotel instead of regular canned tomatoes, and ever single kind of cheese I could imagine.

I used homemade salsa instead of tomatoes, red onions and only about 1/4 head of cabbage.  Served it over baked fish, it was perfect!

Had to get rid of some cabbage...found this one...very good and healthy feeling with salmon!  Made the rice with chicken stock for more flavor.

Turned out good! Used Ro-Tel instead of tomatoes and jalapenos, just because it was all I had. Great way to use up extra cabbage. Used leftover brown rice-held up well.

I used 1 10 oz can of diced tomatoes and chiles, instead of the tomatoes and jalapenos. Missing something but still good, I think alot has to do with some people are used to cabbage being cooked with ham or fatback.
