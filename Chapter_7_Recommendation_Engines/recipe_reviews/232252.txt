1-7-2016 ~Pretty darned good!  As I thought over it for purposes of this review, I considered maybe a little more dill might be in order, or maybe a tad more celery. Hubs captured it best, however, when he said that he enjoyed this because it was simple.  Exactly!  Because there are so few add-ins, the lovely (and expensive) crab takes center stage.  You KNOW you're eating CRAB salad.  I did add some green peas, but only because this was seriously in need of some color.  It would have looked pretty anemic if I hadn't.  I loved the addition of the chili sauce, which you can't identify but contributed  subtle flavor.  The dill is a fitting addition. I forgot to add the lemon juice, so I can't be certain if this pasta salad is better with or without.   In my view, skip the typical and possible additions of onion, cheddar cheese, green pepper, bacon, tomatoes... all good, but if you want CRAB salad, prepare this just as is.  One other thing - this salad will be as good as the quality of the crab you use.  Buy the best that fits your budget.

It is an excellent recipe.  I added a little more celery and some raw onion.  Strangely enough, my elbow macaroni didn't change into rotini like the picture!

I made this. It was pretty good. It was a bit salty. So I put about a 1/4 cup sour cream to cut salty taste. Much better. It also gave the salad a better taste also.

Did not like this at all, in fact threw it away.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The dressing overpowered the delicate (and expensive) crab - which was lost in too much pasta.  I've always trusted Allrecipes.com but this was so awful am going to be more careful from now on; it was truly that bad.

I doubled the recipe for everything except the dill. I was concerned it might dominate the delicate flavor of the crab, and in my opinion it did.  After 24 hours in the fridge, the flavor did mellow a bit, but I still found the dill overpowering.  I did add a cup of frozen peas; and then in an effort to make it more to my liking, added some Old Bay seasoning, red pepper flakes, lemon pepper, and some cubed cheddar cheese.  I've made other pasta salads with dill that I enjoyed;  however, in my opinion, dill just didn't fit here.  It probably only needed some Old Bay instead.  I will not make again.

Didn't care for it. The dressing was disappointing.
