Super yummy!!  One thing I found is if you bake the mushrooms for a few minutes first, set them on paper towel to drain.  Then when you bake them with the filling, the mushrooms will not get soggy.

I was hesitant to make these for a baby shower I was going to because there was only one review, but I went ahead and made them and they were a HUGE hit! Almost everyone there asked for the recipe. I had left some at home for my husband and he said they were the best appetizer he has ever had. He asked if I could make them every week! Hahaha!     I would add more jalepenos for my personal taste. There wasnt any heat to these at all.

OMG if I could give these a million stars I would!  These were absolutely the most delicious stuffed mushrooms I have ever had.  I love the creaminess of the cream cheese and the slight heat from the jalapeno paired with the bacon and cheddar.  Next time (and there will be many next times), I will double the recipe because me and my husband fought over the leftovers for lunch!  Thank you CookinBug for sharing your awesome recipe!

Seems a bit ignorant when someone rates recipes based on not using all of the ingredients!  This makes the overall rating of that recipe inaccurate and therefore affects the whole pupose of the rating in the first place.

Sooo good!  I used jarred jalapeños and upped the bacon a bit (because bacon is awesome) but followed the recipe otherwise and everyone loved them like crazy!  I had some leftover filling I heated up the next day and dipped chips in, it also makes a fantastic dip!

This is officially hubby's new favorite thing! These were absolutely delicious! I did use jarred diced jalapenos, and that worked out great and gave them a nice kick. Thanks, Bug, for sharing such a wonderful recipe that has quickly become a family favorite! :)

I made these for my mom,s birthday and everyone loved them.  By popular demand I am making them again for Christmas.  You can easily make these day ahead just let sit out an hour before you bake to get to room temperature.  I used light cream cheese and the whole bar and just increased other ingredients accordingly to basically triple the recipe.  I also topped with bread crumbs.

This is my first review...but these were so amazing that I had to share. My only suggestion is that you double the recipe as 8 mushrooms are not enough! They are just as good reheated! So much easier than making poppers and they have the mushroom as well. I store my extra jalapenos from the garden chopped and in the freezer so these are a perfect way of using up the extras after making salsa...Thanks CookinBug!

Made these tonight and they were sooo good!  I used 4 oz of cream cheese and I didn't have the jalapeno so I just added a couple dashes of tabasco sauce.  Wow, wow, very good!!!

Oh my goodness, these were SO good!! I used some of the bacon fat to sautee the mushroom stems, garlic etc, instead of olive oil. Really helped round out the flavour. Also used jalapeno slices in a jar, as I had none fresh. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and pre-baked the mushrooms stem side down in the oven for 5-10 minutes and then drained them on paper towels to get the excess moisture out, before filling. This helped quite a bit to maintain a wonderful texture to the mushrooms without them getting mushy. Make these.....NOW!!!

Wow!  These were so yummy and received rave reviews from my adult Halloween party guests.  Devoured in minutes!  I used 20 average sized crimini mushrooms.  I doubled the recipe and used a half of a 12oz tub of whipped cream cheese, about 2/3 of a 4oz can diced jalapenos, and I did use swiss cheese, as I needed to "use up". Wonderful & easy appy, I'll be doing them again for my Christmas Eve celebrations.  Sincere thanks for sharing your recipe!

I can't being to say how wonderful this tasted! It was perfect the first time I made it. I wouldn't change anything....except to maybe double the recipe because they went so fast. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I used seasoned salt and I also put the mushroom caps in the oven for maybe 15 minutes to let the water bake out of them before I stuffed them. These will be made again really soon because I am craving them again as I write this. lol

Didn't want to bother with cooking two strips of bacon , and I certainly don't need the fat either, so I used two slices of Canadian bacon. I actually chopped it up and mixed it in with the jalapeño mixture after the ten minutes of sautéing. I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. These are soooo good. I really like the flavor the Canadain bacon gives to the mixture.

All Gone!  I was lucky to get to taste one :)  I had at least 3 people ask me for this recipe.  This was a great appetizer and will definitely make it again.  I used the HOT jalapenos in a jar (just used my Pampered Chef hand chopper) and they were just right.  These would be a perfect app for a football gang and nice cold beers :)

This is a great recipe.  It is very easy to make.  I love how you use the stems of the mushrooms instead of discarding them.  This recipe is a real fine, and I will be making these tasty buttons many times in the future.  Kudos to you for posting this! (If it were my recipe, I don't know if I'd be kind enough to share it!)

Really easy!  Tasty but not the best stuffed mushroom ever.  However, I left out the bacon.  The mushrooms were kinda soggy.  I think some breadcrumbs mixed in would help absorb some of the liquid.

These are fabulous!!!  I doubled the recipe and glad I did!  I also used turkey bacon (since that was all I had!) and upped some of the ingredient amounts.  Since I like heat, next time I will use more jalapeno or maybe habanero!

Everyone Loved Them.  I will be making more, everytime we get together.  The only things I would do different is bake the mushroom first then add the filling for the remaining baking time.  The mushrooms release a lot of water, so draining them was a task that is not worth repeating.

So I have already put a review for this recipe but its ooooh so good that it deserved another! LOL. Today is New Years Eve and my sissy in law is having it at her house. And from all the ranting and raving they have heard about these hot little numbers, she asked me to make some for tonight! I was like "YUM! Ok!" My husband kept telling everyone how yummy they are. I actually had a few guests over a little over 2 weeks ago and they all seemed to really love them!! I love making these. They are super easy and fun. 

Tip: bake the mushrooms before adding the mixture, watch all the water that comes out of these little guys, pat them with a paper towel to dry them up and add mixture and pop back in the oven. They really will get soggy if you dont do this. YUM! Happy eating people!!!

These were really great. I made quite a bit, about 3 packages of mushrooms, so I was just kind of eyeballing the ingredients for the mixture. I also took a suggestion from one of the reviews that said to cook the mushrooms in the oven for about 10 mins after you remove the stems so that the excess moisture sweats out, then you drain them on a paper towel. Would never guess mushrooms have that much moisture. Highly recommend that step! These are just great!!

Yummy!  Oh, yes!  I baked the mushrooms alone before I stuffed them for about 8 minutes and turned them upside down on a paper towel for a while to let them sweat out some of the liquid that has bothered some here.  They still could have used a little more sweating.  The mixture is spot on right!  They were a hit at the Super Bowl party I took them to.  Thanks, Cookinbug!

This was wonderful, I didn't have Cheddar so I put Romano and a Mexican 4 cheese blend. I bought extra jalapenos, because I knew there would be left over mixture so I put the extra in halved jalapenos (2 Large), and those were great too!

Very good!  I think I used too much cream cheese, though, and next time I will add a little at a time until it's the right consistency.  I also like things hotter, so I'll add extra jalapenos.  Great recipe, thanks!

This combined my two favorite appetizers - bacon wrapped stuffed jalapenos and stuffed mushrooms... like most of us do I tweeked the recipe for my personal tastes - added more bacon and more jalapeno and a tbs of ranch dressing for added flavor... my hubby liked it but commented that he liked the traditional shrooms better so I might add bread crumbs next time to split the middle... great recipe will make again

Fantastic recipe ! Rated 4 stars because I think cooking then on the  stovetop brings out a better flavor in the cheese. my husband got some from the deli. We didn't know how to cook them so I guessed and put water in a sauce pan just enough to go about half way up the mushrooms cooked on med - med high heat covered for 15-20 minutes. And thet cheese was so good. Next time I made my own and bought some from the deli and cooked them in the oven. They tasted the same except in the oven it makes the cheese almost instantly disintegrate in your mouth but on the stove top it makes the cheese melt in your mouth!

Great recipe--super easy and a great starter to any dinner!  I did change a few things the second go-round:
I put bits of the "Baby Bell" cheese (any flavor) inside the  mushrooms and sprayed the mushrooms with Crisco butter flavor spray instead of using all the fatty ingredients listed in the original recipe.  Still delicious!

These turned out great!  But they are much better when served hot.  Not as good after they get cold.

I LOVE jalapeno poppers and stuffed mushrooms so when I saw this recipe I HAD to try it. ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEM! Complements were had at the dinner table +) Only thing I changed was the amount of jalapenos. I used 1 green and two red jalapenos, which added a nice festive feel since it is December +) DEFINITELY making these again and again and again etc etc

Loved it! After making it several times and following what other reviewers said about pre-baking the mushrooms so you can drain the water off, I tried poking a single smallish slit with a sharp knife in the bottom of the mushrooms. It worked well and the water flowed out, so that they could be cooked in just one step and not be soggy.

Restaurant quality - even me and my daughter (two people who really dont like mushrooms) thought these were fantastic and the mushroom lovers at the table agreed wholeheartedly - Next time I may add more pepper(I actually used a Serrano)because I would have liked a bit more kick for my taste buds - Oh and I added a layer of mozzarella cheese to the top of these before baking - It was a wonderful addition

These were easy to make and taste great. I did make one addition to give more of the popper quality to them. I rolled 1/2 of them in garlic & herb seasoned bread crumbs before baking to give them a little crunch.. just the cream cheese not the mushroom... but I might try all of the mushrooom next time. The ones with bread crumbs definitely were better. MIght try panko as well next time for even more crunch. Definitely will be a repeat!

Very tasty and easy. I added a little tiny bit of red Thai chili pepper to compliment the green jalapeño (made them at Xmas time). Only suggestion is too use small mushrooms. I used 2-3 inch diameter ones and they became a 3-4 bite better to use knife and fork than finger food. Will definitely make again.

I doubled the cream cheese and jalapenos and we ate the leftover cheese filling with ritz while waiting for the mushrooms to bake! I also omitted the bacon simply because I didn't have any onhand. It was delicious! Easy and really good flavor. I can't wait to make this again!

My daughter requested stuffed mushrooms for Thanksgiving.  I made another (the most popular) recipe and this one.  I made both exactly as written.  My daughter and I really loved this one, my husband liked the other one.  He said this was too spicy but I thought the other one was too spicy.  I'll definitely make these again!  I think next time I will (at least) double the recipe though so that I can use a full package of cream cheese.

These were good, but still don't hold a candle to the 'Mouthwatering stuffed mushroom' recipe on this site.  I think a combination of the two recipes might be good.

Very good.  I added sausage to the cream cheese mixture.  You could add just about anything.

I think I will pre cook the bacon, crumble it, and put it on top of the mixture next time.  I like my bacon a little more done.

These mushrooms are tasty, but milder than I expected. I would use more jalapeno next time.

I made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it! I just wanted to warn everyone this recipe fills well over 20 - 40 button mushrooms (about 1 tbsp each). I doubled this recipe for 30 mushrooms and unfortunately ended up with wasted ingredients :(. I followed some other tips and I let the mushrooms sweat for about 20 minutes before filling them. Overall great recipe!

These were really tasty! Rich, but good. I used Neufchatal (low fat cream cheese) and a serrano pepper - they were nicely spicy but not too hot. Definitely pre-bake the mushrooms as other users have suggested. These will be great on game day!

Great recipe. I baked them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet so they wouldn't get soggy, and so the bottom of the mushrooms will get the benefit of dry heat.  I also put the stuffing in a sandwich bag, clipped off a corner, and squeezed the stuffing into the mushrooms (much easier and less messy).  Next time I'm definitely leaving the ribs in, maybe even add another jalapeno or two.  And I would add lemon juice to the stuffing - it needed acid imho.  But they're also fantastic just the way they are.

Every time I make these everyone goes crazy for them.  I use canned jalapenos, packaged bacon pieces (the real stuff), and used baby portabellas last time.  Also sauteed the stems with butter, garlic, and a little onion.  You gotta try these!!

oooooo so yummy! I used the package jalapeno bacon bits, I also added crab meat and extra cheese,  and cayenne pepper. I mixed it with my blender. After doubling the recipe,  I had a little extra filling,  so I used the rest for jalapenos.  yummmmy!

I precooked the mushrooms as suggested to take some of the moisture out.  I like  jalapeno poppers stuffed with bacon, so I thought I would like this.  Maybe I took out to much of the ribs, or cooked the pepper too long, but there was no jalapeno "hot" to it.  I was disappointed. Next time I will add more jalapenos and only cook a little.

You can never go wrong with stuffed mushrooms in my book.  This was a nice variation with the jalapeno.  There is a little liquid left over from the mushrooms during baking, but that didn't detract from this yummy appetizer.

I made these for an Easter appetizer and everybody loved them! I followed the recipe but also took other reviewers advice and baked the mushrooms, allowing them to drain before filling. I made them again a few days later cuz my hubby loved them!!

I did not make any changes!  I was still cooking when I put these on the table.  I had to dive in to grab one before the boys ate them all.  They were extremely good.  Listened to other reviewers and cooked them in a little water and covered to cook then broiled to crisp up the top.

These are delicious! I've made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were good. My family likes things on the spicier side so I added extra jalapenos the second time and everyone really loved them.

This was a hit at the New Years Eve party! I should have brought copies of the recipe with me. 
I followed the other reviews to put just the mushrooms in oven for 10 minutes.  The well of the mushroom was full of moisture, so I drained it and let it sit for another 10-15 minutes and it filled up again.  Drained again, put in the filling and baked for 15 minutes.  They came out perfect. I used Cremini mushrooms.

I bring these to gatherings all the time and there's never any left, so I've learned to leave a few at home for the next day for us to enjoy. Didn't change the recipe at all except to pre-bake the mushrooms. Great to make a day ahead and just pop them in the oven! Yummy!

Full confession: I did not eat these. I dislike both mushrooms and jalapeños!  However, my sister loves mushrooms and it was her birthday. She and my mother and bro-in-law all like those jalapeño poppers you get at Sonic and other places, so I thought I’d try this recipe for them. It went over really well! I thought I would end up with leftovers, but they all came back for more! So I will try this recipe again sometime, even if I’d never eat them myself!

Very tasty! I made a couple of changes: Used Costco bacon bits instead of making my own, and as per other suggestions, pre-baked the mushrooms for 20 minutes (after removing the stems for the filling) and drained them before stuffing them, and also added a couple of shakes of cayenne pepper to the filling. Deelish and a definite party favorite; will make these again!

Delicious! I amped up the jalapeño just because I like the heat and didn't need to add any salt or pepper. I would absolutely make these again.

Super delish! Instead of bacon, I added a package of jimmy dean hot sausage.  And to spice it up, I used 2 jalapeños instead of one and sprinkled the cheddar cheese over the top when I baked them.

These were so popular for a get together than I rushed out to buy more mushrooms to make them again two days later. At a church function, they were the first item to be gobbled up!! There was quite a bit of filling left over...I might freeze some of the raw  mushroom stems to use in another recipe so that there was less filling!

Cream Cheese seems to cut down the spice level. I'll try the recipe again, next time  some taco spices will give more kick and flavor.

Yum! I baked them for about 10 min before filling to drain the water out of them.  I used diced summer sausage instead of bacon just for the ease of it.  That was very good, but I'm sure the bacon is good too. Topped with panko bread crumbs.

These turned out great! I didn't have fresh jalapeño so I used a jar of pickled jalapeño slices and just topped each mushroom with one.. also I also leftover cheese mixture so I mixed all the mushroom stems with it put it in a small baking dish and topped with some parm! Turns out awesome with no waste!

These were  soooo good!  I had a large package of baby bellas so I tripled the ingredients.  I baked the mushrooms for a few minutes before stuffing to reduce the liquid.  I also broiled them for a minute or so after stuffing and baking to toast them a little on top.  My husband loved them!  He likes spicy so I used four jalepenos with seeds which gave them a lot of heat.   They are low carb too so works with our diet.  I'm sure these will become a regular at our house.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I made it very similarly! It's soooo yummy! I did layers of cheddar and feta cheese. I included bacon bits at the top and bottom. In the middle were grilled vegetables (onions, sweet peppers, and small mushrooms) with sesame oil & olive oil! Everything else was the exact same! Took a little under 20 minutes. DELICIOUS!

Yes.  It turned out so amazingly good.  used the 4 person serving and it made 12 caps.  just modified it by making 4 strips of bacon and adding bacon to the recipe as well as crumbling some on top. i also topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese and baked for about 20 minutes!  so nummy will be making again.

Amazing! I used 6 large white mushrooms and cooked the mushrooms stems, garlic, and jalapeno in the bacon fat instead of olive oil. I will make this again and again. I love that it is low carb too! Thanks for a winning recipe, CookinBug!

These are bite sized nuggets of heaven. They're awesome, but they need more jalapeño. I would suggest doubling the peppers. Other than that, fabulous.

So delicious! But since it's kind of a pain to make a lot of them for parties, this time I'm trying it as a dip - 8 slices of bacon, two very large jalapenos, a 5-oz. container of sliced mushrooms that I dices, 2 8-oz. packages of cream cheese, and half a cup of cheese. Make as usual, but spread into an 8"x8" pan and sprinkled a little extra cheese on top, baked for 10-15 minutes. Much easier to make a crowd pleaser that way!

Wonderful recipe. Everyone loved these. I like a little heat so included the seeds. I don't like my mushrooms to have that ugly, dry look, so I brush them with a little oil before stuffing.  Mine took longer to cook than recipe states.

Loved it!  Spicy with all the jalapeno seeds though.  I made it with turkey bacon and low-fat cream cheese - and it was great.

Wow! So good!I doubled the bacon and used low-fat cream cheese. Baking the mushrooms for 5-7 minutes and then draining them upside down before adding the stuffing is key to preventing soggy 'shrooms!  My son even said that stuffing would be great as a dip... And he's right!

Great recipe!!! I don't even remember how many times I've made this recipe! But I do remember that each time I made it, it was a hit! It's a cross between two of the best appetizers in the WORLD! Bacon-wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cream cheese and stuffed mushrooms. You will have to double this recipe! Eight mushrooms won't be enough!!!

I rarely follow recipes to the letter, though this one provided an excellent base. My twist: I switched the Jalapenos out for Chipotles and added 2 oz. of crab meat to the filling. Also, a small sliver of red bell pepper on top of each really heightens the presentation.

Finally I found a stuffed mushroom that I like as much as the portobellas at Longhorn (and I love those!). One son said they are one of the best things I've ever made! They are easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe and used vegetarian bacon in 1/3 of it for myself, but the rest I used chemical free bacon I had baked in the oven. I used the food processor to chop up everything (bacon separately). I had enough filling for 12 medium sized portobellas and then about 4 regular mushrooms to use it all up. They weren't soggy, but next time I may bake the mushrooms first as others have suggested. They were not too hot. I may use another jalepeno next time. Thank you for this delicious recipe! You did a great job of creating it and I'll be making them on a regular basis!

These were amazing!!! I didn't have jalapeños so I followed the recipe without them. Full of flavour and deliciously creamy. These stuffed mushroom caps are a new favourite for my boyfriend and I.

Wow so good. These were the best stuffed mushrooms we have ever had. They were easy to make and I wish I had made more!

These are so incredibly tasty!  I only had cream cheese and parmesan, so I made do without the cheddar cheese and it still tasted great! I also wish I could rate this recipe with more than five stars, it was a HUGE success!

These are great!  And different from your standard stuffed mushroom.  The only change I made was to add a couple of tablespoons of panko breadcrumbs to the mixture just to absorb any extra water from the mushrooms and sprinkle a few panko on the top of each shroom.  It was easy and quick to make these.  Also, I made them a few hours in advance and popped the cookie sheet in the fridge until I was ready to make them and that worked out well.  I will definitely be making these again.  SO GOOD!  Oh, and I second the advice of another reviewer who suggested doubling the recipe because otherwise you WILL end up duking it out over who gets to eat the last one of these!

Made these for Thanksgiving and my family and guest's love them. Very good idea with the peppers for the poppers effect. Making again but will add some bread crumbs too.

These are AWESOME!  We had some friends over a few weekends ago, and these were a HUGE hit!  One of our friends even said these were the best stuffed mushrooms he'd ever had.  :) I quadrupled and followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the jalapeños...I used about 1/2 - 3/4 of a jar (drained), rather than fresh.   For the amount I was making, I used 4 packages of fresh mushrooms, and ended up with about 45 stuffed Jalapeño Mushroom Poppers. There were a few left over, and even warmed up the next day these were delish!

Really great crowd pleaser! Combines what folks love about jalapeno poppers and stuffed mushrooms. I added a fresh red chili for color and more kick.

Loved it... Followed the recipe to a tee. Only thing I will do differently next time is to double the hot pepper and bacon. They were gone in no time.
