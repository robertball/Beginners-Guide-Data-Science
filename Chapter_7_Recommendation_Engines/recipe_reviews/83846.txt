I am giving this recipe a 5 star even though I changed it. Both my children liked the salmon and that makes my life easier!! 

When I began the prep. I realized I was out of sage so I just used what I had:  thyme, paprika, and lemon pepper. I had cayenne but omitted due to the little ones. Then I added garlic, some ginger and a bit of dill.  Cooked the salmon with virgin olive oil in a skillet and towards the end of the process I threw in some sherry and put a lid on and simmered for about 5-10 minutes.  I did not add any salt.

Results: My 3 year old had thirds, and my 5 year old had seconds.

Really good recipe. I made this twice in one week since it was simple and elegant. I served this to company. I used olive on the bottom instead of spray. I added fresh garlic and rock salt to the herb mix. This is a keep.

TO THE PERSON WHO SAID COOKING WITH ALUMINUM WAS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH, YOU ARE BOTH RIGHT -AND- WRONG.  It is only dangerous to cook with aluminum IF you have ANYTHING acidic(wine, vinegar, tomato, etc).  ANYTHING NON-ACIDIC WILL NOT LEAD TO TOXIN LEAKAGE.  Made this last night. I left out the cayenne pepper(hubby can't eat spice) and threw in ginger instead.  I know, weird, but it gave it a nice bite.  I didn't wrap the fillets in aluminum foil...I ran out with only enough the cover the top...LOL.  I put them in a glass Pyrex casserole and then covered it with the last of my aluminum.

I've got 3 boys-12, 6 & 3-who not only ate their salmon, but wanted more. In the worlds of my 6 year old "it's the BOMB Mom!" Very easy to make, this is definitely a keeper!

Never cook with aluminum as it is unsafe to your health!  This will be good if it's cooked in a covered casserole dish (and a little liquid (wine or juice) is added.

I tried a slightly modified version of this tonight (with aluminum foil) and loved it!  My kids ate it right up, too!  Super easy!  I didn't have any sage, but it turned out great!  I just added a little lemon juice and a little salt.

I think the portion amounts in this recipe are way off - a serving of fish is supposed to be about 4 ounces, so there is no way that four servings would require 32 ounces (2 pounds) of salmon. When I made this, I used fresh sage, crushed red pepper, no paprika, added lemon juice both before and after cooking, and did not enclose in aluminum foil - turned out very delicious. I would have never thought to use sage or thyme with salmon and I am very glad I did!

Delicious! I'm quite the novice in the kitchen, and I had no trouble with this recipe. I used 2-3 fresh sage leaves on each fillet. The salmon took about 35 minutes to bake, I guess my fillets were more thick. My boyfriend loved this!

This is pretty good, altho it's hard to mess up a nice salmon.....nothing outstanding that I would hurry to make again...prefer a dill/lemon combo.  To solve the aluminum quandry use baking (parchment) paper instead.

This was a tasty way to prepare salmon. The only change I made was to use my pampered chef baking sheet and seal it with aluminum foil. I had a large salmon and it took longer than the stated time to cook. When it was done it was very moist and flavorful. I used fresh herbs from my garden and am glad I did! Thank you for a simple and delicious recipe.

It was a nice change but I prefer salmon with citrus.  Add lemon juice and fresh garlic - much better.  It was dry but maybe that was the fact our sockeye was flash frozen and not fresh?

I didn't have any fresh sage on hand so I used rubbed sage.  I also did ginger and the garlic salt.  Once I scrapped off the excess spices, it had a great flavor.

I tried this, though I didn't have any sage, I used my own herb combination, and baked it in the oven. It was quick, and easy, and overlapped perfectly with the asparagus I made. And, more importantly, it was DELICOUS. I had never cooked salmon before, and was shocked how simple it was. Try it, and it'll be something you add to your home menu.

So simple yet flavorful.  I followed the directions exactly, except for adding a little salt and pepper.  My whole family loved it.  My son, who originally did not even want to taste salmon, ended up having two pieces!   I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent!!!! So good and so easy! I drizzled just a little lemon juice over the salmon just before sprinkling the mixture of seasonings on top. I actually used ground sage because that's what I had, I also added some garlic salt because of another's suggestion. So, so good!

Nice with a thick salmon too.  Missing thyme, we went with added rosemary and a touch of Japanese shio-kosho (original salt & pepper) really brought it out.  Delish!

I did change it a little bit... but this was quick and yummy.  I added fresh garlic and some kosher salt, used barely a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  My 10 year old had seconds and was very excited to see leftovers so he could have more tonight!  It smelled great in the oven and tasted even better!  This is a must try!

A very light and delicious recipe. By using all fresh herbs, it's a taste of summer in mid-winter.  I had lots of sage, so I used 5 small leaves for each salmon filet, and I'll do the same in the future.

OMG! I haven't had salmon for years because I was so sick of it (I'm Canadian)...but ten years later I came across this recipe and - voila!  It was fast, easy and glorious tasting.  You can embellish with whatever strikes your fancy...Yum!

Surpisingly moist despite no added fat (must be that controversial tin foil). The combination of herbs was pleasant enough but could easily be adapted to incorporate your favorites.

Really good and easy recipe. Poured the drippings in sauce pan with butter and sauted with a little salt and pepper. Poured that over salmon and rice. Really good flavor.

Ehhh, just okay.  The cooking time might be partially to blame for my poor review.  20 minutes was WAY too long and the salmon was dried out.  Even if it wouldn't have been dried out it was pretty bland.  I had to add a lot of salt.  I won't be bothering with this recipe again.

So simple but adds so much flavor -- without extra carbs or cals! Works equally well (without foil) on a covered grill.

I am not a huge fish fan, so I am always looking for recipes that help improve the taste of fish. In my opinion, this recipe did very little for this.

I like salmon, but I find it very fatty.  This was a nice, healthy change.

Not bad, although I prefer lemon salmon or other salmon recipes.  Very quick, and easy to modify.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out great! My salmon only needed 10 min until cooked through.

Outside was only thing that had flavor. Will try again with spices melted and heated in a little butter. Score filet and pour over. let sit 1 hour and bake.

Pretty good, definitely herb flavored. It wasn't done after 20 minutes so I increased the baking temp to 375 and baked another 10 minutes and it was moist. This is a healthy, quick meal.

This was very good we only had a small piece left when we were done, so I made salmon sandwiches for lunch the next day.

Very good. Didn't change anything at all. Gourmet sea salt was sprinkled on individually after served. Thanks!

I added a little minced garlic and a sprinkle of dill.  The sage was the component that made it unique.

We just had this for dinner and it was really good.  Both of my boys had 2 pieces and my husband would have had more if there was any left.  We will definitely add this to our regular rotation.
