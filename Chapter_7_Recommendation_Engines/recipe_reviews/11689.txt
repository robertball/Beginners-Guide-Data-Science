I'm so glad I waited to review this until the day after I made it.  I tried it after chilling it for a couple of hours and wasn't too thrilled with it.  I just made a bowl now, after it being in the fridge overnight and wow!  It isn't dry at all and the flavors have really mingled and developed!  I followed other's suggestions and used half balsamic vinegar instead of all red wine vinegar.  I also used rotini pasta, regular tomatoes, portobello mushrooms, red and green bell peppers, and a small purple onion. I left out the pepperoni just because I didn't have any, but next time I'll definately add it. As good as it tastes, if you do use balsamic, be warned that the pasta and feta will look brownish.  I think someone else mentioned this, but if you're making for company, you might want to use white balsamic vinegar. This is soooo good, thank you for the great recipe!

This is the best pasta salad ever; however, the vinegar/oil ratio is a little strong for me.  I recommend that you start with approx. 1/4 cup of vinegar (you can adjust and add more if you like) using half red wine vinegar and half balsamic as suggested by other reviews.  I substitute 1 can artichoke hearts-not marinated-for the mushrooms.  I also used diced red and yellow peppers for extra color and sliced olives. I prefer red onions instead of green onions and use tomato basil feta cheese and bowtie pasta. Yummy and beautiful 5 star salad!

My sister-in-law made this for Mother's Day lunch and it was incredible!  I think she said she scaled the recipe for 16 servings, but it still went perfectly.  Some of the modifications she made was using a mix of yellow, red and green bell peppers for color.  She also added some artichokes and replaced the cherry tomatos with sun dried tomatoes.  And she cut the amount of mushrooms by half.  But the taste was amazing.  Note: if you don't like vinegrette type dressings, then you will not like this salad because the vinegar taste really comes through.  (Which is what gives this pasta a great kick and Greek flavor!)  I love it!  Recipe is a keeper!

I am updating my review!  I added sausage (didn't before) and YUM!  My changes were: 1) Halved the amount of dressing and used 2 vinegars:  so ... 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 tbsp red wine  vinegar and 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar; 2) Even though I halved the amount of oil and vinegar, I still used the listed amounts of spices; 3) Used rinsed marinated artichokes instead of mushrooms; 4) 1 1/2 roasted red peppers instead of raw; 5) 1 cup of crumbled feta; 6) Omitted the olives; 7) Added a small dash of salt and lemon juice. Wow...those seem like a lot of changes but I don't think it affected the overall essence of the dish. Definitely let it marinate overnight.  BTW:  This is an embellished version of Greek Pasta Salad III...stick with this one.

Great pasta salad! The first time I made it was for a block party, and after tasting it, my husband wanted me to make something else to take  so he could have this all for himself. I got quite a few raves at the party with it. I used rigatoni pasta, left out the pepperoni, and thought there was plenty enough dressing as it is. Make it a day ahead as called for, though.

I substituted sliced zucchini, cut in half, for the mushrooms & omitted the olives & pepperoni, due to family personal preferences.  I may serve the pepperoni on the side, next time for those who'd like to add it.  I also took the advice of some reviewers to save some of the dressing to add just before serving so the pasta wouldn't be too dry.  Another hint is to take the dish out ahead of time as the olive oil solidifies in the fridge.

Everyone loved this recipe.  Make sure to make the night ahead so the flavors have time to meld.  Using pepperoni isn't necessary--it almost seemed like too much meat and the vegetarians in our group couldn't enjoy it then.  Next time we may add some artichokes.

I really liked this pasta salad.  I left out the sausage and added red onions and parmasean cheese.  I used the absolutely fabulous dressing (from this site) and I think that it was the dressing that set this salad apart.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made it for a 4th of July BBQ, and it went fast!  I subsitituted the elbow pasta for rotini instead.  The only thing I would do different is leave a little dressing left over to toss right before serving. I would definitely make this again!

I modified this recipe to serve 8, and it would have served 12-14 easily.  It is a delicious recipe.  I thought the dressing was great,the basil and oregano, yum, yum.  I used presliced turkey pepperoni slices and cut them into thin strips.  Everyone, my neighbor, who popped over when I was making it, my husband, who managed to seek some too,and all of my co-workers, 12+, loved it.  It is definitely a keeper.

I used rotini pasta (as in the photo) and left out the mushrooms.  I used red, yellow, and orange bell peppers for added color.  I almost made myself sick, I couldn't stop eating it! My vegetarian daughter loved it...she just picked out the pepperoni.

A little trick for making pasta salad that doesn't soak up all the dressing.  After cooking your pasta, add olive oil and lemon juice and refrigerate overnight.  It  doesn't take much, just a tablespoon of each for a pound of pasta.  I think I learned that from this site.

Great, easy recipe that I whipped up in no time! I heated up the vinagrette in microwave for 30-60 seconds so that the sugar dissolved into the mixture. I also used Apple Cidar vinegar and regular White Vinegar instead of Red Wine Vinegar (I didn't have it) and it was delicious! Definitely have it sit in fridge for AT LEAST 2 hours for the flavours to really soak into the pasta. It gets better the longer it is kept in fridge (if you can make a day ahead, that would work, but I tend to like having crisp veg, not soggy, so it's really a toss up...

Yummy! Yummy!  I loved this dish!  I did make a few changes, however.  I roasted the red peppers, I replaced the mushrooms with chopped artichoke hearts and I replaced the pepperoni with cubed grilled chicken breasts.  I also made sure that I mixed the halved cherry tomatoes in, while the pasta and chicken were still hot.  It softened them just enough and really brought out their flavor.  I love vinegar and I found the amount used to be just right.  I will be making this again and again.

Wonderful! I added a splash of fresh lemon juice and it took away the edge of the red wine vinegar zing.
a note to RALWATTAR - you didn't make this recipe!! You omited things and used a completely different dressing! - Please people don't remark on recipes (good or bad) if you didn't follow it!

This was very well liked by everyone at our recent barbecue party.  I doubled the salad, but tripled the dressing because I expected to need to add more after chilling the salad overnight - and did use the remainder.  I sub'd salami for pepperoni, and used grape tomatoes.  Different pastas work well, too - try rotini or rigatoni.

The vinegar and oil ratio were not in proper balance and the mushrooms became mushy.

This was great yet had to make a few modifications. Added the balsamic as others suggested. Used Kalmata olives instead of just  black and a few green ones. I like black olives yet, thought this would go better. I also added a whole cup of feta with basil flavor just well cause I like cheese. Same reason I added some little pieces of swiss cheese too. I used rigatoni tri color. Did not use mushrooms. I kept feeling something was missing, so I added some fresh grated 3 cheese parmesean before serving. Delicious! Even people I didn't think would like it at the cookout where it was served asked to take home leftovers. This does make quite a bit for a small party. Thanks so much for the recipe and with a little adaptation really worked for me. I would definitely let it marinate for at least 24 hrs before all the flavors really come together.

---READ--- This recipe is great, it has a great flavor, however there are things you should do before making this Pasta Salad, keep in mind FRESH INGREDIENTS are ALWAYS best, so buy fresh Basil and oregano, add a good teaspoon of minced fresh garlic as well, and then add a lesser amount of garlic powder, it gives it a really fresh taste. I added less vinegar and less olive oil (Note, try Extra virgin Olive oil) and then mixed. When you buy the noodles for this rather than making them yourself, buy a better quality, the cheaper brands tend to break apart, stick and sometimes get mushy when you mix it together. Paying a little extra for better quality ingredients will pay off, I first made this with using the higher priced ingredients, then with the cheaper, and using better ingredients really paid off, so if you really want to wow people, pay a little extra. Also, I added a bit extra Feta cheese to mine, since I love lots of feta, but make it to your liking.

Fantastic!  I made this for my husbands birthday party (double batch) and it was gone well before the party was over and everyone was asking for more.  A couple of minor changes... I substituted cucumbers for the mushrooms, used a mix of green, red and yellow peppers, used rice vinegar and half red wine vinegar, left out the pepperoni and added more feta(I love it!).  Thanks for such a great recipe!  I am already getting the ingredients to make again.

I've made this salad several times and every time it has delivered.  I usually make more than 2.5 cups macaroni, but for a whole pound of pasta I've found that it's best to 1.5x the sauce and vegetables.

It's sitting in the fridge now marinating, tasted great before even getting it into the fridge. It makes a LOT! I didn't use mushrooms (fungus hater in the house)  used a 12oz jar of artichoke hearts & used a half balsamic half red wine mix as others suggested. Used the multi colored rotini noodles, very colorful. I used a 2 qt bowl and barely had room to stir so start out w/something bigger. Also put it in the fridge w/a tight fitting lid on it so I can go flip it over a few times today while it's marinating. Can't wait for dinner now :)

This is THE best pasta salad I have ever made or eaten!  I used baby bella mushrooms, grape tomatoes, and half balsamic/half red wine vinegars, and red onion instead of green.  It was outstanding.  I made double the recipe for six people and there was none left.  I was asked to make it again the following weekend for another party.  YUM!!!

I honestly can't say enough good things about this. I took this to a BBQ for 4th of July and there were 6 other pasta salads...I expected to take home a mostly full bowl of mine. It was gone within the hour before the others had hardly even been touched. Even my husband, who doesn't have a very adventurous palate, loved this. I did the oil/vinegar/spices/pasta in the exact recommended amounts. Everything else, I just kind of eyeballed...when it looked like I had added enough, I quit throwing it in the bowl. Very delicious and attractive pasta salad!

Loved this recipe. Did as the other reviewers suggested and cut down on the oil and did the balsamic vinegar/red wine mixture. It tasted great. I didn't let it sit overnight, since I was tired the night before, but I kept stirring it every few hours and so by dinner time, it was well saturated and full of flavour. I did use the MUSHROOMS and they tasted great. Only thing I omitted was the onion, since me and the boy don't care for them. Also added green olives along with the black. It added a nice twang to the taste. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I give this recipe 5 stars with a few changes... I use Tri-color rotini because it looks spectacular, feta cheese, Pepperoni, garbanzo beans, sliced olives, grape tomatoes and fresh brocolli. I omit the mushrooms, peppers and onions.   Second, I double the dressing, because the pasta soaks up so much of it!.  The vinegar has a very strong presence in this recipe.  I think I might try the recommendation of 1/2 red wine and 1/2 white balsamic vinegar to see if that tones it down just a bit. You definitely want to let it sit overnight- the flavors develop fantastically, otherwise this salad is sort of blah.

I don't like these kinds of salads, but I made it anyway because I was serving it at a party. Well, I'm a fan of this salad now. Everything went very well together, from the oils and the spices to the tomatoes and onions. I used the elbow macaroni and it was good. I also used red onion instead of green onion. Mine unfortunately didn't have a chance to cool down in the fridge so we ate it after about an hour of making it, but it tasted fine. Next time, with several hours to chill and have the flavors come together, it will be extra delicious.

Excellent flavor.  Here is how I altered it to make it an even bigger hit:
Replaced mushrooms with Sun Dried Tomato, Used Calamata Olives instead of regular black olives, used garlic and herb feta rather than plain feta.  My advice is to mix the cherry tomatoes last so that they don't bleed into the pasta salad and turn it pink.  I made mine in advance and just put the tomatoes on top, and when the guests arrived I gently mixed them in.

Our grocery store sells a Greek pasta salad that we love, but it's $5.99 a pound.  We were having a party and I wasn't eager to break the bank for a salad.  I found this recipe and it seemed similar to the one at the grocery store.  My husband kept telling me not to be disappointed if it didn't come out as good.  We were surprised that it came out even better than the one at the store!  I won't be buying it pre-made again!  I made a few little changes:  I used 1/4 cup of the vinegar, I used mini penne pasta, I omitted the mushrooms (we don't like them raw) and the pepperoni (just didn't want meat in it), I used a small jar of roasted peppers (it just seemed like a better fit) and I used sliced olives.  It seems like a lot of changes but I don't think any of them are so drastic that they changed the flavor of the original recipe.  I highly recommend this as a great alternative to the usual macaroni salad/potato salad/cole slaw choices.

Wonderful pasta salad!!  I also added some marinated artichoke hearts, used red onion instead of green, used both pepporoni and salami, 1/2 red wine vineagar and 1/2 balsamic vineagar.  We took this camping Memorial weekend, and it was excellent!  The longer it marinates, the better it gets!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did add a cucumber to empty out my frig.  I used jumbo olives, not so great.  I would used smaller olives or greek olive instead.  My husband and I liked it, however, the kids not so much.

As per other reviews, I only used 1/4 cup of vinegar (1/2 red wine, 1/2 balsamic).  I didn't have all of the veggies on hand so I just used what I had (mushrooms and grape tomatoes).  Substituted the black olives for a handful of kalamata olives.  Next time I would use red onion instead of green since it would compliment the other ingredients better.  Since I used whole-wheat pasta, the colour of the balsamic vinegar didn't have any affect and actually gave the mushrooms a nice deeper colour (as if they'd been cooked).

Make this at least 24 hours prior to when you plan to eat it or the flavours won't have had enough time to fully develop.

Like Rob, we're making this as our community cook-along on our forum. I used tri color corkscrew pasta, added English cucumber, red onion as well as the green, garlic and herb feta cheese and cider vinegar instead of the red. My girls gave this an immediate 5 stars, had it for lunch today and the whole pound I made is gone! That's quite the compliment and thank you so much for a delicious and very refreshing summer pasta salad recipe!

This was wonderful, and by using a fortified pasta w/ omega 3s I felt so good putting it on the table.  My husband avoided the pasta salad as predicted until I dropped the hint that it contained pepperoni. He was then interested because he loves anything with cholesterol, and after two bites announced he liked it... after two bowls I figured he loved it. I used kalamata olives for a truly mediterranean experience plus a good extra virgin oil, my feta cheese was the basil/sun dried tomato variety. Good stuff. Thanks a lot.

I thought this was very good. I made it for a family get together. Nice alternative to the standard pasta salad.  I saved some dressing to toss on right before serving as had been suggested.  I also added marinated artichoke hearts.

I made this exactly as written, no changes. It's a great pasta salad recipe, I've been looking for a great vinegar based salad forever now, and I am so glad I finally found one. I did not have a problem with the vinegar being too strong, I thought everything was just right. Don't leave out the feta, its a great touch.

I love this salad!! This is one of my favs that I try to make often. I added more feta and more vinegar and spices (probably because I never make ahead)! I also add tuna instead of the sausage! So yummy and can't wait to make tonight!!!

I have made this Greek pasta salad recipe for my parents once last month. They absolutely loved it a lot. I chose this Greek pasta salad as a healthier option and alternative to the mayonnaise based pasta salad that I made for them when I first started and began cooking. They are both Type 2 Diabetics and I did not want to make them a pasta salad that was super unhealthy at all. I do have plans to make this pasta salad again in the next few weeks. I absolutely loved and enjoyed making this Greek pasta salad recipe for my parents a lot. It is super simple and super fun to make. I absolutely love and enjoy this Greek pasta salad recipe.

I was excited to try the recipie based on the high reviews. I was a bit dissappointed. I made as indicated but cut down on the red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup  based on other reviews and  I figured I could add as needed to taste. Overall it made way too much dressing and the pasta seems to be swimming in oil and still has too strong of a vinegar taste. Next time I may make in a salad dressing bottle and add as needed. We prefer to taste more of the pasta and veggies not the dressing. The combination of veggies works great- the dressing a bit too much.

This was one of the best pasta salads I've had yet and I didn't even have all the required ingredients.  I used salad oil, balsamic vinegar, and no pepperoni.  I can't wait to try it with the exact ingredients.

This was absolutely fantastic- I will be making this weekly to take to work for lunch.  I pretty much followed the recipe, except I left out the mushrooms and just eye-balled the oil and vinegar.  Even better after a few days in the fridge.

This is delicious and I took it to a 4th of July get together and recieved many compliments. I will make this several times over the hot summer months for years to come. I made it for a crowd and here are the changes: dressing: 1 cup of olive oil, 1/4 c each of white balsamic and red wine vinegar, 1 1/2 t black pepper, 5 cloves of crushed garlic, 3 T each of fresh basil and oregano, 1 pkg splenda and blend in mini food processor.   16 oz good Itailian Fusuli 2 can of artichoke hearts cut in 4ths, omit the mushrooms 1 cup of chopped hot banana peppers 1 large package or 2 pints of grape tomatoes halved 1 green, yellow, and orange pepper sliced into bite sized peices 2 4 oz packages of feta cheese with sundried tomatoes and basil 1/2 cup chopped red onion instead of green onion 1/2 cup halved calamato olives 1/4 pound pepporoni and hard salami each  It takes almost 90 minutes to make it but is worth it and makes great leftovers.

SO yummy!!  I made this for a club get together and the ladies all loved it!  Even better the next day.  I used balsamic vinegar instead (because I LOVE balsamic :-) and garden tri-color rotini instead of the called-for noodles, because they are pretty and hold the sauce better.  Great recipe!  I will definitely make this again and again.

It's good, but the recipe calls for too much vinegar, I had to increase the sugar and definitely the salt to mellow out the strong vinegar taste.  Makes a large portion.

I used the Absolutely Fabulous Dressing others mentioned (from this site) but I used all fresh herbs, left out the mushrooms and tomatoes, and used tri-colored pasta (see photo), red onions, a yellow pepper and a jar of roasted red peppers.  It was good but next time I'll use more dressing and add cucumbers - it dried out after sitting a few hours since it all soaked into the pasta.  But overall it was very colorful and people really seemed to like it.

I made this for a 4th of July picnic, but made a few changes.  I used tri-color orzo (plain, spinach, and sundried tomato flavor) instead of macaroni.  I used roasted red pepper instead of raw.  I added quartered artichoke hearts and cucumber.  I also used the recipe for "Absolutely Fabulous Dressing" from this site as another reviewer mentioned.  The finished product was fantastic.  I made enough for about 25-30 people and every bite was eaten. Definitely will make again!

This recipe is awesome!  Don't let the taste when you first make it fool you.  It definitely needs to sit overnight...once you do that - magnifique!  I had a BBQ and made this...everyone was raving about it by nights end.  I cut back on the salami a tad....but that was my only change.  Thank you!

This was a pretty salad.  Great ingredients.  I tried to follow it exact, but did use a mix of balsamic vinegar & red wine vinegar as suggested by many.  The ratio of vinegar to oil was WAY off!  Way too much vinegar...and it ruined it!  It was sour.  I doubled the recipe for a group of about 10 people and nobody really ate it. I threw most of it out. If you make this - use the standard oil to vinegar ratio of 3(oil) to 1 (vinegar) and it will be fine.

I changed the amount of servings to 6; therefore, I am unable to review how the original recipe rates.  This version had too much feta cheese, possibly too much vinegar.  I made it to take to a tailgate; not sure I'm even going to take it.  Disappointed.

Wonderful recipe ! I used fresh basil and fresh garlic, as well as some Italian salami. I didn't have mushrooms, but the salad was so delicious. I am keeping it in my recipe box. Going to make it again.

I made six highly rated recipes from this website for a party I was hosting and this was the least-eaten item. I didn't see anyone go back for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of following other reviewer's advice and used half balsamic vinegar. I liked it and was happy to eat the leftovers but didn't love it.

I am in love with this pasta salad! I didn't add the olives because I forgot to buy some, and I think I added a little more sugar than the recipe called for (I needed to adjust the taste to my liking), I also didn't use elbow macaroni, instead I used organic gemelli. It came out fabulous! I got rave reviews at my son's birthday party. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you.

Yummmmmmm. Love this recipe! I did modify the vegetables, but followed the dressing recipe. Instead of the veggies listed, I used grated carrot, grated cucumber and red onion (what I had on hand) and it was so good. I let it sit overnight in the fridge, as recommended from a fellow reviewer, and it was delightful. I can't wait to make it again, and better yet share it the next gathering!

Really good when we added a ton more vegetables.  The vinegar got rather overpowering when it sat in the refrigerator for a few days, though.

I enjoyed this recipe, but changed a few things based on lack of ingredients and what others recommended.  I did not use the following: mushrooms, tomatoes or sausage.  I substituted the elbow macaroni for penne pasta.  I also used half red wine vinegar & half basalmic vinegar.  Next time, I would still do the same, but decrease amount.  Very nice looking salad!

I made this the day before as stated in the directions.  The noodles sucked up all the wet ingredients and I was left with a dried up noodle salad.  The flavour was tasty but I would suggest serving it same day as made.  I had to add some greek salad dressing to save it. Will not make this salad again.

Very good. I made this because I felt like a good quick pasta salad that I could make to compliment the Baked Honey Mustard Chicken Recipe that I found on this site. I wanted a pasta salad that allowed me to use ingredients I already had in the house. I found this and the recipe is awesome!!! I did make some modifications that are roth noting: I reduced the oil and vinegar and added more as needed to taste, I used a balsamic and apple cider vinegar mix instead of the red wine vinegar. I omitted the mushrooms and red peppers because I didn't have any.  Finally, I added a tsp of Emerils' salad seasoning and McCormick's Perfect Pinch Roasted Garlic and Bell Pepper Seasoning flakes. My family loved this recipe and I will definitely ake again. YUM!

This salad is delicious! I ended up making a few changes because of my family's tastes: I used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and a little less olive oil. I used tri-color corkscrew noodles rather than elbow macaroni. I left out the mushrooms, bell peppers, and pepperoni sausage. I also used thinly sliced red onions instead of green onions and sprinkled a little parmesan on the top before serving. As a side note, the dressing this is tossed in makes a great, slightly sweet dressing for green salads.

I made this pasta salad for the fourth time last night! My husband loves this recipe and asks for it all the time. I follow the recipe to a T except I add a little white balsamic to the red wine vinegar. This is a must try :) I hope you enjoy!

This pasta salad was OK.  I found it way too vinegar-y.  I felt that the dressing should have less vinegar, more sugar and a little salt (or maybe some Dijon mustard).  I also didn't care for the mushrooms in this salad.  I love mushrooms, but they got very mushy in this recipe.  I thought they were not texturally pleasing in the salad.  Still, I would definitely make this again - but with some significant tweaks.

Sorry, I was really disappointed. It was OK. My grandson liked it, but then he loves Suddenly Salad (which I should have made). I followed the directions exactly and left it in the fridge overnight. Won't make it again.

Really great.  I cut up pepperoni slices for the meat portion.  Good combination of ingredients.  You could probably go even lighter on the oil if you wanted to.

Excellent although I changed the ingredients a little. I used red onion, skipped the mushrooms, used red, orange and yellow peppers. I also used greek olives instead of black olives. The marinade is very good!

Loved it! The only changes I made were garden corkscrew pasta and green olives instead of black. I started with half of the vinegar and gradually added more to suit our tastes. Will definitely be making again!

Yum...I don't think you could mess this one up.  This was my first pasta salad and it turned out great.  I made a few substitutions to suite my own tastes.  I used about 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder (I'm a fan.)  I didn't have any oregano so I skipped that one.  I substituted shallots for the green onions just because we like them better as well as green olives for the black ones.  I omitted the pepperoni as I don't like it.  I didn't measure any of the veggies and it turned out great.  Thanks for helping make my first attempt at a pasta salad extremely successful.  I will make this one again often.

Greek salad to me is all about lemon.  So I substituted lemon juice and did not use the 50/50 ratio.  Instead I used 1 part oil and 1/3 lemon juice.  You can always add more lemon if you like but I think this is a good place to start.  Also people mentioned they did not like the color of the dressing and what it did to the pasta so this helps that too.  In addition I left out pepperoni because it does not seem like a greek salad then more like a pasta salad.

I wasn't overly impressed but my guests seemed to love it. The taste was good but I didn't like the weird color given by the vinegar. I would have given this recipe 3 stars if it wasn't for several friends who told me how good it was.

This was super!  I took another reviewer's advice and worked in the vinegar slowly.  I ended with a ratio of 3/4 vinegar to oil.  I never had Feta cheese before today.  After sampling it, I absolutely refused to use it in the salad!  I used some shaved parmesan instead, and in place of green onion (since I didn't have any), I used about a teaspoon of onion powder.  I served the whole pasta salad over fresh spinach leaves, and on the side, we had french bread brushed with butter and broiled.

YUMMMMMY!  This is a nice alternative to the typical Italian dressing pasta salads.  I substituted red onion for the green onion and it's great.  It gets better the longer it chills, so I'd suggest making it the day before for the best flavor.  I agree with other users who suggest putting the salad out for a while before serving to let the olive oil become liquid again.

It was so yummy!  I did use only 6oz of pepperoni, but I think I might try some salami next and maybe add some capers or artichokes.  I also made a little extra dressing.  It was GREAT though..my mom asked me for it for a pot luck dinner at the family reunion!

I just made this for lunch with friends, and it was a big hit.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using less pepperoni (I used about 1/2 pound, and I think even that was a bit much), and I used tri-color rotini pasta.  I don't think it needed any extra dressing--I just let it warm up a little before serving and it was fine.  It did seem to make an awful lot, though--I made the recipe for four servings, three people ate it, and then had seconds, and there was still quite a bit left (not that THAT's a problem!).  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a fabulous pasta salad!  I've made it for many BBQs and I am always asked for the recipe.  I do double the vinegrette as it tends to be too dry if I don't.  I also add an extra package of feta cheese.

This recipe is a different twist on the typical pasta salad.  I think it's the pepperoni that gives the salad its unique flavor.  Be prepared to add more vinegar/oil if you make this ahead of time, as the salad tends to dry out in the fridge.

I have made this many times over the years, albeit with very minor modifications to account for family tastes and everyone loves it.  One change that I recommend is the choice of pasta, go with a fusili as the grooves catch more of the dressing, spices and cheese.  Always best to make it the night before and keep stirring it every 30 minutes after making it so everything soaks up all the flavours.  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you so much!

Some alternate ideas to try: I added artichoke hearts. I also cooked the bell peppers with plenty of olive oil, adding salami for flavor (instead of pepperoni) and several minced cloves of garlic a few minutes before they're cooked. I let it cool and tossed them in the salad. (I didn't add as much olive oil in the dressing mix, as a result, because the garlic flavor in the olive oil from the pan is delicious). Didn't add the feta as I'm not a big fan. Didn't have green onions but I cut up 1/3 of a red onion. Forgot to get mushrooms so those were omitted as well, heh. Instead of sugar I used honey. I agree with everyone that it's better the next day--but I didn't have time the previous day and went for it anyway. It was still delicious. It just keeps getting better. :)

Everyone was really happy and overly complimentary! Thanks again for a great starting point!

I have made this recipe for gatherings and stick to the original version for the most part. I do reduce the amount of mushrooms and let it blend overnight. I add the cherry tomatoes just before serving . Everyone loves it! No leftovers !

A little trick for making pasta salad that doesn't soak up all the dressing. After cooking your pasta, add olive oil and lemon juice and refrigerate overnight. It doesn't take much, just a tablespoon of each for a pound of pasta. I think I learned that from this site.

Didn't change a thing.  Delicious addition to a pot-luck-picnic party.  Definitely feeds more than 4, though!  I'd say more like 6 or 8.  Agree with others that the taste is even better after a night in the fridge :)

So happy I found this recipe!  My husband and I eat this all the time!  It is a five star just the way it is.  Occasionally I sub some of the red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar, the balsamic turns the salad a brown colour but ooooohhh soo good!!

We LOVE this pasta salad! I have brought it to a few family gatherings in the summer and everyone raves about it. I make a few changes to it though. They are: I use rotini (usually tri-color), cucumber (quartered slices) instead of mushrooms, kalamata olives instead of black, sometimes stick pepperoni sliced thin and halved or quartered, and sometimes red onion instead of green. Also, I cool the pasta in a bowl in the fridge, and make up the dressing in a Good Seasons type jar, add the veggies and feta to the cooled pasta, then pour the dressing over it and mix well.

Super yummy. Did half the dressing at 1/4 cup oil to 2 tablespoons each red wine and balsamic vinegar.  Also added artichoke hearts and a little lemon.

we made this salad for 80 people last night and it was superb! Although the measurements are out a bit for that size a crowd. We halved the dressing and it was very good.

I thought pasta salad was too tingy for my taste. I rate this three stars because I had to add salt to ingredients to take away from the tingy taste, because I am not use to red wine vinegar in pasta salad. The next time I make this, I am going to halfen the amount of red wine vinegar. Overall, it is sight appealing, but can use some improvements flavor wide.

I took another reviewer's advice and used half the oil and vinegar for the dressing, same amount of spices as originally called for, and a roasted red pepper rather than raw. GREAT recipe that is easy to customize to personal (in my case, anti-mushroom) preferences!

Excellent! Definitely let sit overnight for the flavors to meld. Needs about a tsp. of salt and a dash of lemon juice to really bring out the flavors. Only made half the marinade and it was plenty. Added chicken instead of pepperoni.

Amazing!! I used seasoned kalamata olives instead of canned and cucumber instead of mushrooms, added artichokes and left out the sausage. I've never made greek pasta salad before but I always wanted to. This recipe is definitely a keeper - it's delicious!

Delicious recipe! I shared this with my co-workers and they loved it. Some reviewers mentioned it being a little strong with the vinegar flavor, but that was a big hit amongst everyone that tried it. Also, I substituted sun dried tomatoes in place of cherry tomatoes since I had them on hand and it tatsted great. Thank you, this was wonderful!

I made this pasta salad for a potluck party at work and it was a huge success! Instead of using the pepperoni sausage, I added a can of chick peas to put a vegetarian twist on it. Everyone was asking for the recipe =)

I made this salad for my daughter's wedding-160 servings.  Excellent reviews-several told me it was the best pasta salad they had ever eaten and requested the recipe. I used half red wine vinegar and half lemon juice in the dressing, omitted the pepperoni, added cucumber and artichoke hearts, kalamati olives, toasted pine nuts, used orange and yellow peppers and colored rotini, feta cheese, extra virgin olive oil replacing half of the oil with Bryanna Clark Grogan's oil substitute. (1 cup water, 1 TBS cornstarch, cooked until clear)
For those who dislike fresh mushroooms, try them anyway, when marinated overnight as others suggested, they are wonderful and suit the salad perfectly.  I do not care for feta, but the same thing happens to it, when marinated overnight, it blends wonderfully with everything else.

By far the best pasta salad I've ever had.  I've tried various additions/substitutions, including balsamic vinegar, salami instead of pepperoni, marinated artichoke hearts, various kinds of peppers, various squash, etc.  You really can't go far wrong with this base.

This was the best pasta salad I have ever made!  Only change I made was omitting the mushrooms (my family doesn't like them) and at the suggestion of other reviews, I also added about 1/4 c. of balsamic vinegar and some fresh basil to the liquid mixture.  Took it to a get-together and everyone wanted the recipe!  Will DEFINITELY make this again!

I have been asked to make this so many times since I first served it. It is a hit. I am actually bringing it to two different parties this weekend. 

Definately make the night before. I mixed the dressing in a dressing server and didn't put all of it on so I could freshen it up just before serving.

I also added kalamata olives and omited the mushrooms. I am going to try it with some fresh basil this weekend since I have it in abundance right now. the dressing is what makes it so you can easily adjust ingredients to personal taste. I have forgotten the pepperoni before and only one person noticed.

Like other reviewers said, I too went a little easy on the vinegar from the start.

It is so easy and turns out so professional looking.

Can you say YUM?  Made it as per the recipe as to ingredients but used "Absolutely Fabulous Greek-House, Dressing" from this site. Another reviewer suggested to add some mayonnaise as well.  Excellent suggestion!

Great! Could always use more veggies - I added cucumbers and double the tomatoes.  Skipped the onions (kids don't like) and used salami instead of pepperoni.  Very good!

I absolutely love this salad.  I love the bitterness of the feta cheese and the tangy dressing.  They really compliment each other.  I did only use about 1/2 cup feta cheese and red onion for the green.  I made this last night and tasted today.  Decided it needed a little bit more sugar.  A keeper for sure.

Awesome.  A HUGE hit with the family.  I sub'd salami for pepperoni and ended up eating the leftovers for breakfast, lunch and a snack the next day.  Definitely let this marinate overnight!

I used canned mushrooms. I soaked 1 can of them in the vinegar mix for a couple of hours. And then added the 2nd can straight to the mix. It was great and the marinated mushrooms give it a nice little touch.

For me to give this a rating of five stars is huge. Delicious and easy to make with lot's to share and keep for yourself. I get many request for this one and I am so pleased to make it. However, I use a hardier twisty pasta that looks more appealing and much tastier. Make the day before for best taste and to get it done ahead of time.

Excellent!  I made only a few changes.  I substituted cucumbers for peppers because of a food allergy and also because I think the cucumbers add a little "greek" to the mix.  I also used Kalmata instead of black olives  - just preference on my part.  Very good and different pasta salad.  As others have said, definitely let it sit overnight.  It takes a while for the flavors to come together.

Amazingly easy and fast to make and DELICIOUS. I used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp. basalmic vinegar just to change up the vinegars a little. Used about 4 cups of Barilla whole grain penne pasta. Also found a bag of "mini" pepperoni, about 1/2 inch in diameter, and a generous handful of those went perfectly in this dish. Because I also love artichokes, I added to this pasta dish a 6 oz. jar of marinated quartered artichoke hearts. I just drained the marinade and discarded it. Left the feta on the side due to hubby not liking feta. Sprinkled a generous portion of tomato basil feta on my serving (we had this for dinner after it sat in the fridge for four hours) and all was good! It truly tasted perfect, not a thing wrong with this dish. I love the combo of herbs and the addition of a little sugar. I just love this recipe. I could go on and on about it! :) What would be excellent in this dish, is some chopped up grilled chicken breast. Now that would be a perfect lunch or dinner, all in one dish!

I added 1/4 c extra vinegar for a bit more flavor.  This recipe makes a ton.... I have made a couple of times and I always think it won't make enough... although it states only 4 servings this recipe is more than enough salad for 8 if not more.

Broiling the pepper 'warms' the salad's flavor for winter use. Once pepper is charred and softened, enclose in a paper bag for easy peeling. Used already pitted Kalamata olives and fresh basil with the addition of onion powder. Combined white wine vinegar with balsamic plus a tad more sugar. This salad is superlative as it's totally customizable.

Every time I make this salad I'm asked for the recipe!  I like using penne or farfalle instead of macaroni.  I also use green olives instead of black, roasted red peppers instead of bell peppers and I add some sliced pepperoncinis.  It's always a hit!!!

I made this for a bbq with several of our friends and everyone raved about it!!  I love this pasta salad because you can play around with all sorts of different veggies (I added artichoke hearts - yum!) and the dressing is delicious!!  I do agree with other reviews that it needs to sit over night to let all of the flavors "meddle"...it's even better on the 2nd day!

Excellent salad! DH loves salad but I have never been one to make it. As other reviewer suggested I cut red wine vinegar to 1/4 c and added 1/4 c white balsamic vinegar (find at Trader Joes) along with 1/2 c olive oil. Doubled the garlic and tripled the basil. (Used the frozen "cubes" from Trader Joe's) Great taste!

Forgot to add the olives. Bought salami slices and sliced thinly. When you initially toss it almost looked like too much olive/vinegar sauce but after you let it sit overnight and the veggies soak it in it was perfect and excellent in taste. 

This is a keeper!

WOW! I have tried several pasta salads in the past, and this is by far the best! I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor, although I omitted the pepperoni and used rotini noodles instead of the prescribed macaroni noodles. Also, I let the dressing sit for a day before letting it melt with the salad for a few hours. I highly recommend this recipe!

I left out the basil (allergies) and the pepperoni (to lower the fat) and only had a few hours to marinate it, and it still went over very well at a cookout. I also doubled the garlic (minced) and topped it with shredded parmesan. I used sliced portabellas and whole wheat penne pasta too, which gave the dish a nice earthy look. Definitely a keeper.

Very good. Ok, here is what I changed. I added fresh basil, a diced zuchini, and some toasted pine nuts for extra flavor. Also, I used crumbled turkey bacon as a sub for the sausage. It was very good!

I made this  this week-end and everyone loved it.  I used Rotini instead of elbow macaroni, just because it looks pretty, and I added some marinated artichoke hearts( I put some of the marinate liquid in the salad also).  The dressing is very flavorful and every one enjoyed it.  My mother-in-law said it was the best she'd every had.

This is really good, I took it camping and my friends asked for the recipe!  I used balsamic vinegar b/c I didn't have the red wine vinegar, still a great taste.  You can add any veggies you want to this dish and so easy to prepare.  I cooked the noodles ahead of time and made the dressing and put in air tight container, brought along veggies, and put it all together at the campsite.  So easy and so tasty!

I LOVE IT!  I'm more of a "Simply Salad" type of person, so guests were shocked to find that I made this from scratch.  Easy recipe to follow.  I would definitley recommend the use of artichoke hearts and tri color pasta, though.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!  I am going to make it for the fourth again!  No more boxed salads for me!

My friend and I looked for a last-minute pasta salad recipe to serve for dinner. We both immediately pointed to this one and sent our husbands to the store with an ingredient list. Three hours later, this dish was the rave of our dinner! We only made a few changes due to a sparse market - we didn't include tomatoes or feta, used tri-color rotini and added shredded parmasan upon serving. Still great! Love this recipe and many thanks for posting it.

I get rave reviews every time I make this.  My family always ask me to bring this to gatherings.  I few changes I made is I use bowtie pasta, add chick peas, 1/2 a red and yellow bell pepper, and 1 container of marinated artichoke hearts.  I do not use mushrooms.  I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving so the flavors blend.

This recipe is delicious!  I didn't have enough oregano so I used maybe half the amount, I also only had garlic salt so I minced about 5 cloves fresh garlic.  And I also had some fresh basil leaves from another recipe and used that.  It came out great and there wasn't even a bite left!

Great recipe!  My family loved it!  I substituted artichoke hearts for the mushrooms and skipped the pepperoni.  I will definitely make this one again for get-togethers!

I love this recipe!  I usually add grilled chicken.  Marinate the chicken  in Italian or Greek Dressing overnight while the pasta melds together, then grill the chicken and toss altogether.  A little lemon juice is good too.  I think the more you add the better it is -- cucumber, peppers, pepperoncini, kalamata olives, feta, red onion.  People always ask for the recipe - guys too!

This was an excellent salad. It is extremely high in fat and calories, so if you do not mind that, it is well worth making.  As one person stated, it does make a lot, so if you are making it for 4 to 6 people I would half the recipe.  Very Good

This is a OK dish. Not a lot of flavor and I could really taste the oil in the dressing and nothing else. We ate it for a side one night and had lots of leftovers that I threw away. Will not make again.

I thought this was fantastic! I sent some home with a friend to Canada and his wife loved it too!! It's much better the next day when the tastes can meld together. I used a pound of tri-colored rotini so mine wasn't soggy at all, left out the mushrooms and onions and added artichoke hearts. This is a keeper!

I substituted kalamata olives for black olives because I thought that would be more "greek", and I took some other people's suggestion and used roasted red peppers instead of raw. I also took out the tomatoes and mushrooms because I don't like them, but used a pound of pasta and more of the other vegetables to make up for the loss of two ingredients. I thought it was a wonderful recipe with great flavor, just a tad too vinegary. Next time I will use less or maybe try to use a more mild vinegar. Everyone at the party loved it and some asked for the recipe. Thanks.

I loved this with the alterations I made (kind of swayed from the original recipe, however). Instead of red wine vin, I used balsamic vin. I used tri-color rotini pasta, and used fresh garlic instead of the powder. I also added a few dashes of salt, omitted the feta as well as the pepperoni (I served this with a cheesy chicken dish and thought it would be a better accompaniment without). Great pasta salad! Pretty colors, too.

I thought this pasta salad was pretty good, but my guests loved it.  I also omitted the mushrooms, but I included everything else and it did look nice and taste light and summery.  I think it might have been better without the red pepper (or with roasted red peppers instead of raw), but it was good nonetheless.

This recipe is the first pasta salad that I served which was a hit with guests.  A few changes:  I used 2 tsp. sugar, substituted grape tomatoes for cherry tomatoes, red onion for the green onion, and kalamata olives for the black olives, and omitted the mushrooms and pepperoni.   My guests took a doggy bag home and ate it for lunch the next day!

I am not a fan of pasta salads, but my husband is.  I made this recipe for him and he says that it tastes better than the kind you buy at the deli or get at a salad buffet!  He wants me to make it for the next potluck we go to!

I used real garlic, 1/2 the amount of red wine vinegar, tomato basil feta cheese, threw in some extra sundried tomatoes and omitted the onions and olives!  I know I will get a request at least twice a month from him for this recipe (he eats it over the course of a week because it makes so much!).

Great recipe, thanks! I didn't used the raw mushroom because i've read it is not healthy to eat them raw. 
I used half of the oil and vinegar like the others reviewers. Next time I will add more pepperoni for a stronger taste. 
Made this for a family party and it was gone in 5 minutes!!! Everybody liked it.

This recipe is far too acidic. My husband and I love this type of food, but my husband din't even finish his, not even to pick out the olives. I will try this again, but I will halve the vinegar, double the salt, add a peeled, cubed cucmber, and increase the amount of pasta by at least a third. I served some mild garlic bread on the side to temper it further, which helped, but I can feel the acid reflux coming on. I am a vinegar lover, but this was just too much!

This is such a refreshing salad. Great for bbq's or special dinners with friends or family. It took awhile to prepare but very worth it! I did make an alternation, and it was aswome. I grilled chicken tenders and placed them on top when finished.

I have made this salad twice in the past week.  Everyone loved it.  I made a few changes only because of what I had available in the house.  I used a green pepper instead of red, I used green olives instead of black and I cut up tomatoes instead of adding cherry tomatoes.  I didn't use the green onions because I didn't have any.  I also omitted the mushrooms because, although we like mushrooms, I didn't think they would fit well in this recipe.  I also used 3 color spiral pasta which gave it a great color variety.  I think this is an excellent recipe and very fast to put together.  I've already given the recipe to 2 other people and I've only had it for 2 weeks.  THANKS!

I used this recipe because I needed to use bell peppers and mushrooms. I didn't use some of the ingredients b/c I didn't have them. I made a lot of this salad and there was only a tiny bowl of leftovers!

Just made this for a family cookout.  Very good pasta salad--but not outstanding.  I made a whole box of pasta and just added veggies, black greek olives and feta cheese as I went.  You can add whatever you want to this--I am veggie so I left out meat.  I doubled the dressing and people really liked this dish.  I didn't have to add more dressing before serving--there is plenty! This is a simple pasta salad that will always be good.

I took this salad to a cookout yesterday... it was a huge hit! I did take the advice of several reviewers here and decreased the amount of mushrooms, omitted pepperoni and added artichokes. Next time I might add some chopped spinach instead of artichokes, use red onion instead of green onions... who knows. This salad is so versatile that you can alter the ingredients to your taste and still be confident that it will be delicious!

Excellent!  I did cook up a 1 lb. box of Ritoni pasta and cut back just alittle on the feta and pepperoni to make it more appealing for the family.  This is a keeper and great for company at the summer BBQ's!  Thanks.

This was very easy and tasty.  Be sure to allow it to soak in the flavors, and i would keep some liquid for to put on top at the end before serving.

This is an excellent recipe.  It is such a nice change from the usual pasta salad.  Even my husband liked this and he doesn't care much for pasta salads.  I will definitely make this at our next cookout!

Fabulous salad. The dressing was the most important part so I didn't feel bad about changing some of the vegies. I used cucumber instead of mushrooms, Kalamata olives instead of black olives and added some marinated artichokes. Threw in some fresh instead of dry basil. Delicious!

I made this for a BBQ and it was a hit. I had several people ask for the recipe. 
I doubled the recipe and followed the modifications that others had made. I excluded the mushrooms and instead included chopped artichoke hearts. I also used kalamata olives instead of black. Also used half balsamic and half red wine vinegar, added diced pepperoncinis, and squeezed the juice of half a lemon over top. It did taste best the next day  (vinegar flavors mellowed out and were absorbed nicely) so, if possible, prepare a day ahead of time.

A bit to vinegary for our taste. Used diced ham but it turned out delish.   Definitely best cold.

As is .....this recipe is good....substituting 1 cup of favorite Greek salad dressing in place of oil & vinegar creates the BEST Greek salad EVER!!  It is just as good made with or without pepperoni. I used turkey pepperoni and it was a hit.

You really do have to save some of the dressing to put on just before serving since the pasta drinks up much of it if made the day before. As written this salad is fine but a little tweaking can make it even better. I used a pinch of sugar, combined white balsamic and rice vinegars. Raw mushrooms don't go well since they get too soft, I added marinated mushrooms and artichoke hearts instead. Used Barilla mini penne pasta and added some cooked leftover string beans since I had them.

A very flavorful  basic pasta salad that one can modify with whatever is  on hand. It definitely needs at least 2 hours to allow the favors to work their magic.

The recipe is great just like it is!  
Everyone will want to tweek it to their tastes as we did..

Just dont skimp on the products you put into it, keep the herbs fresh and use Good (Real Feta) Cheese.

 We also used the Heirloom style of Cherry Tomatoes which did the salad justice

The salad came out exactly as I imagined and was what I was looking for.  I cut down on the oil slightly, but still did not use all of the dressing.  I added a pinch or two of sugar to the dressing.  Also, I topped the salad with pickled peppers.

We loved this salad.  I never follow a recipe exactly, but this time it was close.  I added a small jar of artichoke hearts along with the marinade to the salad.  Next time I will leave out the mushrooms. They didn't seem to add anything to the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great!! Only change was white instead of red wine vinegar. Made it for Father's Day and everyone loved it.  Will make again.

As it is...this recipe is just so-so. A little bland. I added pepperoncinis...banana peppers...pimento...GREEN OLIVES...and prosciuotto to zing it up. Also...1/4 cup of Italian dressing. And we leave out the sugar.

This was really good. I do think the vinegar was a little strong though and next time I'll probably cut that back to half a cup to start with. I'll drop the oil down to half too and then add some back as needed to figure out what the best quantity is. I love all the veggies though, makes it a nice summer pasta salad for grill nights.

I made this for Father's Day dinner and it was so yummy.  Even the picky eaters in the family liked it.  I followed the directions, but based on the reviews, I used 1/4 cup of white balsamic vinegar and 1/4 red wine vinegar and I made it the day before.  Next time, my hubby would like me to add artichoke hearts.  This will now be my signature dish that I take to summer parties. Thank you for the recipe.

Mouthwatering with a good "Greek" flavoring. I used no mushrooms, but added celery sliced thinly and a small jar of marinated artichokes. When I bring this to a party, I always get requests for the recipe! You can put this together in just a few minutes - just let it sit for a few hours.

I skipped the mushrooms, but added a big cucumber and a can of garbanzo beans.  Served without the salami (only for those that like it).  The dressing was a bit too sour for our taste (although I will see how it is on the second day).

I made this for a church gathering and it went fast.  I adjusted the recipe for 10 servings and it made a lot more.  It filled my biggest bowl!   My only change was to use red, yellow and orange bell peppers for the color.  I love this and will definitely make it again.

I loved this recipe, though I did elaborate upon it and tweak it a bit.  Like others I swapped the red onion for the green, I used parmesan cheese instead of feta, and used a different shaped pasta.  I also sauteed the mushrooms in butter and oven-roasted the cherry tomatoes (with basil, garlic, and thyme) before adding them.  I added sunflower seeds to spice up the texture a bit.  Because there would be vegetarians at the picnic I was bringing this to, I bought bags of mini-pepperoni and left them beside the salad for people to add themselves.  Easily the best pasta salad I've ever had.  The oven-roasted tomatoes made a huge difference in particular, and I think adding more of them would be a good idea.

Very good! huge hit for summer partys.  I grilled the peppers and zucchini and doubled the recipe.  I was able to take it to two different parties and I just added the dressing and feta right before we ate! Thanks for sharing

Too vinegary! Need to cut vinegar to 1/4c and adjust from there for taste. Used Salami. Maybe use 1/2+1/2 balsamic and red wine vinegars.

My favorite!  I serve this on many picnic occasions and never take home leftovers.  I use the colorful tortellini pasta instead of elbow macaroni which I think makes it look healthier.  The college boys love this when they visit too.  A big bowl if there is any left gets eaten for breakfast.

The best part of this is the dressing- would be good for a lot of different pasta salads (I left out the sugar, and didn't notice the absence)! I subbed extra olives, feta, and pepper for the mushrooms. I think next time I will use green, yellow, or orange pepper for some visual interest.

Turned out wonderful. Added another 1/4 cup aged balsalmic to go with the red vinegar. It just needed an extra kick. Added 1/2 tsp. of salt too.

This was a really great dish.  The one thing I would say about it is that it was very oily and very "wet".  Next time I make it, I will probably reduce the amount of olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Otherwise, it was very delicious!

Very good. Very easy. Lots of ingredients, but fast to assemble. I substituted shredded parmesan instead of feta and used red onion because I had no green ones. I also used artichoke hearts. I used rotini pasta. This is a keeper!

We loved this! Made it for our grandmother's 92nd birthday/family reunion and it was a family hit! We made it the morning of and it was great for lunch, although even better the next day.  We made "as is" with the exception we used mozarella cheese, cut into cubes (only because we didn't have feta in the frig).   We plan to serve this at our wedding reception! Thanks for sharing!

Just finished putting this salad together. I used bowtie pasta and left out the tomatoes and mushrooms. The smells of all the ingredients were teasing me so much that I couldn't wait until this salad chilled to have a taste. It was amazing warm and know it will be even better chilled. I was thinking that I'd need to tweek the dressing a little to suit my taste, but it was perfect just as the recipe suggested. Thanks for sharing. This is now my favorite summer pasta salad.

The Soldiers like the Antipasto Pasta Salad recipe more from this site. This one was very mild in flavor; Italian dressing would have been stronger. I won't make this again but it was good. We all like the other recipe more.

I just made this, it hasn't had time to marinate yet, but I'll be bringing it to work tomorrow. I can already tell this will be a crowd pleaser. Takes no time at all. I didn't follow the measurements exactly, just put a bit of this, a splash of that, and it turned out great! Yummy!

Awesome, I added artichokes. I loved the smooth taste with the dry bite of the feta cheese.

Easy and delicious! 
I used a whole box of whole wheat rotini pasta, rather than the mere 2.5 cups the recipe called for. The dressing was still enough for the additional pasta.
I left out the mushrooms and sausage. 
I used sliced red onion instead of green onions.
Next time, I will add artichoke hearts, and that will make it a five-star recipe!

My parents and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used apple cider vinegar instead; the vinegar stated would have been better.  I did not use the peppers, but added more tomatoes which worked well.  The feta really soaks up much of the vinegar taste and makes the salad creamier.

I was searching online for a greek pasta salad recipe, and fortunately I came across this one.  This recipe is outstanding! I did make a few changes/substitutions though: I used 1/4 red wine vinegar and 1/4 balsamic vinegar (instead of just 1/2 red wine vinegar); I used fresh basil, rotini pasta, and red onions.  Overall, a really great recipe!

I just made this and have declared it my new pot luck salad.  Tastes fantastic, and quick to make.  I used the tri-color rotini pasta & added a splash of balsamic.  It's in the fridge for supper, but have already had to "sampling's"!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.   Wendy

This was really yummy! It was beautifully colourful and really a hit with the friends! I added a bit more vinegar (I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar) and about 3-4 cloves of fresh garlic crushed.

I made this salad tonight with a few changes.  I used only half the oil and vinegaer, and I used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic.  I reduced the spices by 1/2 tsp.  I added zuchini and just used a small regular tomato chopped up.  I also omitted the mushrooms and used greek kalamata olives.  Obviously I made lots of changes, but it was really the sauce of this recipe that makes it so delicious.

Excellent recipe. I have made this twice in the past week for two different events and both times it was all eaten and everyone raved about it.
I do not put the mushrooms and pepperoni in because it doesn't seem to fit the greek salad appeal for me. I add extra feta and use red onion as others suggested and the second time I cut the vinegar back to 1/4 cup and it was perfect (half balsamic/half red wine vinegar). Definately make several hours before serving.

I'm new to cooking, so I'm just learning the basics. This recipe seemed easy and fun, because you get to make your own dressing. It was so worth it! My mom gobbled it right up and I was really pleased with how everything tasted together. Yum yum yum! I will definitely pull this one out again for parties.

This was delicious and so easy! I did cheat a little bit and bought Kraft Greek salad dressing from the store instead of making it from scratch to save time. I also added some mozarella pearls and substituted red onion for the green. I also used several different kinds of noodles, becuase elbow noodles are just boring. This went so fast I barely got a bite before it was gone! Delicious!

This recipe is delicious! I made this pasta salad for a Memorial Day cookout!  It went fast and everyone loved it! I did take other reviewers advice and use white balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and let it marinate in the fridge the night before.  I will definitely do this one again!

This salad was AWESOME! Next time, I would take other's suggestions and cut down on the vinegar some. I added 1/4 cup or so of red onion, as well as some cucumber to the salad, skipped the mushrooms and pepperoni. I will definately make again!

Very good!!  I made this with the pasta, olives, tomatoes and some olive oil and random spices.  I didn't have the other ingredients, but it still tasted great! It was a hit at my cookout and was nearly gone by the time everyone left.

I rate this a 5 giving it the benefit of the doubt.  On presentation alone it deserves a 10, very colorful and appetizing.  But on taste, there is something missing, I just can't put my finger on it.  I followed the recipe exactly except used a orange bell pepper instead of red but that would not have changed the flavor.  I agree that letting this set overnight enhances the medley of flavors.  I served this with cantelope wedges and some grapes, it makes a nice summertime meal.  I will definately make this again.  Thank you for offering this recipe.

Awesome salad! I left out the mushrooms, pepper and pepperoni, and used one whole English cucumber (diced) instead, and it was AWESOME! The portions are very generous; I daresay the original recipe would easily serve 8 as a side dish. This one is definitely going into my "better memorize this one" file ;-)

I love cold pasta salads when it gets hot out for dinner. This was a bit different with mushrooms, so I gave it a try. I used portabella mushrooms, fresh herbs, peppers and tomatoes from the garden. I was getting in a hurry and used a cup of Italian dressing instead of olive oil and vinegar, omitted the sugar since the dressing already has enough of that. I didn't have pepperoni so used Genoa salami instead. I let it sit in the refrigerator for a good six hours before serving and it was great, plenty of time for the flavors to marinade together. Everyone was in and out and ate when they could, but this morning my youngest son wanted some to take to work for lunch...unfortunately there was none left. This is a keeper.

I'd give this more stars if I could. My husband's friends have literally trapped me in a corner before asking when I would make my pasta salad next. It's that popular. I normally make a double batch (yes DOUBLE--two boxes of pasta!) and it will all be finished by the end of the football game! I made a few small changes: I use an entire box of penne pasta. I use a a can and a half of sliced mushrooms (not fresh, gross), I use the little pepperoni chunks instead of sliced, extra vegetables (all), and I also use Splenda instead of sugar and add a tad extra. Its delicious. You just need a really really really big bowl.

What a fabulous recipe- a real crowd pleaser!  I used penne pasta, and couldnt figure out the dry ratio to wet ratio. I found that 2 oz dry cup of pasta should yield 1 cooked cup. So i made half a cup to yield 2.  In my opinion, it really didnt.   I ended up using 3 cups of dry pasta, and made double the dressing.  I didnt toss all the pasta in the dressing. Instead I added a little dressing at a time and checked the flavor.    This turned out fabulous!  Instead of slices, I diced a small 'log' of pepperoni, and red bell pepper as well.  For the most part, I left the dressing the same, maybe added a little more wine vinegar and sugar, as it tasted a little too olive oil like.  But really it was a hit.  Got tons of compliments and didnt have any left by the end of the party.  Will definitely make this again!

This was a good pasta dish. The feta cheese and pepperoni really add flavor but instead of white sugar, I added brown.

I am one of those cooks that just uses what's on hand. So, I substitute frequently. This recipe was great, but be sure to let it sit and chill. I substituted balsamic vinegar for white vinegar with some lime juice and pepperoni for summer sausage.

I so love this recipe!! My favorite salad of all time. The only change I make is using 1/4 cup balsalmic and 1/4 of red wine vinegar, instead of all vinegar.

Best ever Greek salad.  I deleted the olives and basil and added additional feta and it was the best I have ever tasted.

This was a hit with our guests.  To make it a bit easier on grocery shopping this is what I found:  1 standard size container of mushrooms, 1 red pepper (slightly less), 1 standard size container of feta cheese & 2 bunches of green onions.  If you are a fan of one or more of the salad ingredients feel free to add a just bit more (but don't go crazy).  There is enough pasta to balance it out.

Excellent salad.  Adjusted for 50 people for a wedding, and the results were wonderful. Cut back slightly on the oil and vinegar as per other suggestions!

I just made this today and it was great! The only thing I HAD to change was the amount of vinegar, I'd say i used 1/4 cup vinegar and 2/3 cup oil otherwise it would have been way to acidic. I also thought of omitting the pepporoni but I didn't and I loved it! So did my dad. Great recipe!

This was the chosen recipe for the June Community Cook Along on our cooking forum.   I cut the recipe in half. Not being a fan of Feta cheese I used an equivalent amount of finely grated pepper jack cheese. When it comes to pepperoni I only like that very thinly sliced and well done on top of a pizza. So instead of the pepperoni, I used two cups of finely cubed Kielbasa, browned in a skillet.  I used a tad bit more basil as the recipe calls for as I love that stuff. The first ingredients I whisked together and let stand for about 45 minutes before incorporating and that made a huge difference. This is a keeper and a great go to dinner all by it's self on a nice hot day. Delish!  Thanks for sharing.

I did what everyone else seems to have done and used tricolour rotini instead of elbow macaroni.  IU also added cucumbers and artichoke hearts instead of mushrooms.  Delicious!

This was a great side dish for the Spinach and Greek Turkey Burgers on this site.   I kept the "dressing" ingredients as the recipe stated and it was perfect for us.  The vinegar taste definitely mellowed out after letting it sit for about 8 hours.  I did change a few of the vegetables in the pasta to suit our tastes.  I left out the mushrooms, black olives, and green onions and added red onion, cucumber, & artichoke hearts.  Very tasty!

This is a once or twice a week meal for us. Just add a side of french bread and you're good to go!  Also, since I am feeding a small family, I just go to the deli bar at our local grocery store and buy the greek olives with feta at the deli bar. Its the only shortcut I take deviating from this great recipe. It has both green and black olives, is already pre-mixed, and easy to use.

Loved this recipe!! I used it as a base I also added cucumber, peas, and celery. I didn't add mushroom and instead of green onion I used a white onion and instead of pepperoni I used Salami. I also used the absolutely Fabulous Greek Dressing from this site as someone suggested and it was great!!!!

Great recipe! Though I did opt to roast the tomatoes: tossed them in a bit of olive oil, oregano, basil, and freshly-ground pepper, then put them in the oven at 425 for about 15-20 minutes. Next time I'll roast the red peppers, too, because their crunchiness seemed a little out of place. Instead of elbow macaroni, I used rainbow fusilli noodles. I also used green olives, because I think they're superior to black. And, for simplicity, I had already mixed up some of the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" recipe on this site, and used that in place of some of the ingredients in this recipe. Thank you for a great pasta salad!

This recipe is fantastic, I've used it many times. I typically add a little less red wine vinegar, and add some balsamic vinegar. The most recent time I didn't use any meat, farfalle pasta, kalamata olives and red onion and it was still good. I agree with other reviewers that it definitely needs to be refrigerated overnight, as the flavors mix and it makes it that much better. Thanks for sharing!

Alright recipe, a little on the sweet side with the sugar though (makes it taste more like pre-made Deli salad with the sugar).  If you like your Greek Pasta Salad to be more sour than sweet, I'd recommend omitting the sugar and tomato, and adding pepperoncini's (to taste).  I also used Penne instead of macaroni; I think it made the pasta salad a little more adult and professional that way...  Overall, it was alright (at best).  People not used to the sourness of traditional Greek Pasta Salad should definitely start with this recipe.

This salad was well received at a recent birthday dinner I prepared it for to compliment grilled burgers & fresh fruit salad.  It made a very colorful presentation and was a fresh and healthy alternative to pasta salad with a mayonnaise dressing.  I used a pasta with added fiber and added some blanched broccoli for additional color, texture and flavor, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is a big hit with our family and I have brought it to pot lucks at work with many compliments. Sometimes we use green olives in place of black for a twist. Excellent side dish!

This was fantastic! Made it the day before going camping to take along with us. Used turkey sausage, which tasted great and was a bit healthier. Lots of flavour and great looking too!

This was, at best, average.  The leftovers sat in the fridge and were not eaten.  I probably won't make this again.

I tried this recipe and it came out great.  I used penne rigate instead of elbow macaroni, substituted the green onion for a red onion, sliced the olives and left out the black pepper & pepperoni.  I can't wait to see what it taste like after chilling over night.

Made this for my family, and they LOVED it! I added chopped artichoke and used a greek salad dressing with feta already mised into the dressing. It was VERY good. The salad NEEDS to sit for several hours before serving... The flavors are delicious!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Didn't change anything except to cut amount of mushrooms in half. Made this to go with grilled steak and everyone loved it and had second helpings. Next time though, I would probably add a little more feta and tomatoes. I would also like to try it with artichoke hearts like suggested by others, but my husband doesn't like them so I didn't do it this time.

This is a good recipe. It is just a basic Greek salad dressing using pasta. I used purple onion, and threw in some orange and yellow tomatoes for colour. It was a big hit and all my guests liked it, thanx for the insperation!

Very good recipe.  I made the following changes: added marinated artichoke hearts (quartered), a bit of fresh lemon juice to the olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing, used FRESH oregano and basil, extra feta (lemon, basil flavored) and tri-colored rotini pasta.  Made it the night before and allowed to blend over night.  Everyone at the picnic seemed to enjoy it.  Good basic recipe that you could easily adapt to taste and preference.

I followed the recipe except omitting olives and pepperoni because I didn't have them on hand. It was EXCELLENT! I am so proud of myself because the taste and presentation looked exactly like what you will find at a high end Italian cafe. Definately let the salad sit in the refridgerator for 6hrs and longer. A good dish to make ahead.

I didn't make this recipe exactly but used it more as a base for my own concoction. I used Absoloutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing because I had 1/2 gallon of it.   Omitted fresh mushrooms (didn't have any), black olives (didn't have any), pepperoni sausage (didn't have any). I know its not the recipe AT ALL but I just wanted to see what else to put in the pasta salad.

I love this!  It's got a lot more flavor than the traditional pasta salad.  People always rave about it when I bring it to a party.  It's strong, but that's what I love about it!

I love this salad, and make it every summer.  Usually I substitute spiral noodles for the elbows, and might also add artichokes, or substitute fresh mozz. instead of feta.

I thought this salad was great!!  I made it with the bow tie pasta, as that is what I had on hand.  Unlike the others, I did not find the vinegar too strong.  I did not change a thing except I used deli salami instead because my daughter does not like pepperoni.  Thaks fjor sharing.

I made this as is except for using turkey pepperoni instead of the real stuff and I used tri-color rotini. After this sits in the fridge for at least 4 hours it's absolutely wonderful. Definately make a day ahead if possible.

This is my favorite pasta salad recipe.  Everyone I have shared this dish with loves it.  I use multi colored rotini pasta for extra color and omit the mushrooms to better suit my family's likes. Thanks for sharing!

The ratio of ingredients was a little weak, and I have no clue why someone would put boring black olives into a greek dish, you need greek olives!  Overall, very good, thank you for ingredient ideas to add together for a dressing.  :)

This recipe was a hit! I skipped the fresh mushrooms, just because I thought they didn't fit the recipe. The pepperoni was a surprising delight in this salad. Definitely make ahead of time, it brings out the flavors so well! Yum!

This recipe is simply fantastic. I'm not a big fan of fresh mushrooms, and I almost left them out, but at the last minute I changed my mind and added them in.  The mushrooms really soaked up the dressing and I couldn't imagine the salad without them.  I used red onion (it's my favorite) and added canned, quartered artichokes as well.

I'm bringing the dish to a picinic in a few days, and can't wait for the compliments to start rolling in from my friends.

Thank you for sharing this stellar pasta salad recipe!

This salad is excellent. I made a few changes.  I used one package of bow ties. I didn't put mushrooms or meat because I made it for a picnic and not every one likes mushrooms or meat.  I used the same ingredients and same amount of oil,vinegar etc.  This way it wasn't over powering with vinegar and oil.  I will make this for every picnic I go to.  There was enough to keep a small bowl for my husband and myself and filled a large pan to bring to the picnic.  Thank you for submitting this great recipe.

I really liked the flavor of this salad, great as it. I chose to use kalamata  olives and probably used a bit more cheese & macaroni. Great summer salad!

We enjoyed this pasta salad. I did use less oil and vinegar and whole wheat pasta and it was still very good.

This was a very good recipe!!! It was definitely a big hit with my whole family as I served it with a feta stuffed chicken recipe I found that really bridged the gap with the feta taste.

I used less than half the oil and vinegar called for.  I omitted the pepperoni and mushrooms.  It was very good, especially because you can make it ahead of time.  I used Barilla's whole grain "Pasta Plus" and no one complained.

This was really tasty, but it definitely makes a lot.   I would definitely cut the recipe down.  I made this for 40 servings and I think I had at least 120.  Great recipe.  The dressing was awesome.

Pasta salad is made alot at our house.  This recipe is a base for me.  I use tri-colored cork screw pasta and just before I drain it I add to the boiling water about 4 cups of frozen broccoli florets, just to blanche, then drain the pasta and broccoli, then rinse with cold water.  I omit the mushrooms(my family is not crazy about mushrooms unless I can hide them in a sauce when they are finely chopped) and I omit red bell peppers and in its place add roasted sliced jarred roasted red peppers.  I also use sliced black olives.  It taste so much better if you allow it to marinate overnight.  If you don't have time for that its perfectly o.k. to use bottled dressings like greek or italian.  I sometimes use the fat free versions and omit the pepperoni.

This recipe is great and versatile to mix & match.  I used whole wheat rotini pasta, feta cheese plus quartered mozzerella balls, used roasted red pepper instead of regular, and next time will also try adding artichoke!

Absolutely wonderful!  I substituted macaroni elbows with tri-colored spiral pasta, and added green olives for a zesty kick.  Throw in some candles, your favorite bottle of red wine and a cheese tray for a Greek dish will satisfy your craving after a long day and definitely create a wonderful romantic evening!

Very, very good.  Makes alot and keeps well in the fridge for a quick munchy.  As per my own family's tastebuds, I cut back the Red Wine vinegar to just a 1/4 cup.  Also added an approx. cup of chopped fresh spinach, some seeded and chopped cucumber, and some minced garlic.  Usually only buy this kind of salad pre-made at the store... So it's nice to now know how to make it ourselves which makes it even better.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  A keeper for us for sure!

This was really good...I'll definitely be making it again.  I did tweak a little...I used fresh garlic, chopped a large tomato, onion powder, reduced the vinegar, added a little more olive oil, and omitted the sausage...used cucumbers and olives instead.  Oh, and a little more feta than what was called for...we like the feta.

Excellent!  Works as a side or as a whole meal.  The recipe makes a lot of salad, though, so next time I'm going to cut the servings in half.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought it was very good.  It was a little stronger (the red wine vinegar taste) then i would have normally like it, but none the less, I would make it again.  I added some cucumbers, left out the tomatoes.  I added also some red onions and substituted the black olives for calamata olives.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks!

This was really good. The flavors just melt together making it very flavorful & robust. I used Rotini in place of elbow macaroni. Served this with Moussaka from this site along with homemade pita chips with galic & olive oil hummus

Excellent.  I made this for my son's birthday party and everyone loved it and my sister in law even asked me to make it for her son's birthday party next week.  The only change I made after reading other reviews was to put less vinegar and I'm glad I did.  Will use this recipe againa and again.  Thanks!

I cut the vinegar to 1/3 cup and since I didn't have mushrooms and I like more pasta in my pasta salad used 5 cups whole grain pasta.  I rated the recipe based on the 1/2 cup of vinegar which would have been too much, in my opinion.

Great recipe; wonderful on a summer day.  The second time I made it I left out the tomatoes.  Without them, I think the salad tastes better.  I also added chopped cucumber.  Next time I mak this, I might try adding marinated sun-dried tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes. The salad definitely is best the next day.  The flavors really meld overnight.

By far the best pasta salad ever.  Always a hit.  I usually omit the mushrooms, halve the  amount of peppers, use mini penne pasta and add cucumbers.  I use two pakages of feta cheese, so it is about double what it calls for. Also I use the stick pepperoni, not slices and cut it up into little chunks.

this was a huge disappointment. if you follow the recipe exactly there is entirely too much oil and vinegar. definitely need more pasta than called for... thank goodness i made extra. i couldn't even pass this along to my sister-in-law who is not picky at all! i used fresh veggies and the best vinegar and olive oil, so that wasn't it. might try again with my own mixture of a sauce.

This pasta salad had a lot of flavor.  I used some of the suggestions that were given. I added green olives, rainbow rotini, seasoned feta cheese, fresh and roasted red peppers, and more pasta.. I did use balsamic vinegar (since that was all I had), and it did turn the pasta salad brown. My suggestion is if you decide to "add" to the salad, you may need more dressing. I enjoyed the recipe a lot, but it may be too vinegary for some people's liking (sorry if I just made up a word), I may decrease the amount of vinegar I use in the dressing next time.  It was a very HEARTY pasta salad. It does make more servings than you think..

I am a big fan of any pasta salad and this one just added to my favorites!  I loved how all the flavors came together.  I used tri-colored rotini instead of the elbows.

I like the sauce but I think it needs more salt.  Other than that the flavor is delicious.  I used both black and green olives.  I thought it needed more pasta so I used 16oz of Gemelli.  I also used the Mediteranian feta cheese.  Delicious!

I did not like this at all.  I followed the recipe except I only used half the amount of pepperoni.  I would also think this makes closer to 8 servings.

i decided i wanted to cook "greek" so i chose this salad, used the absolutely fabulous dressing and had mediterranian chicken.  WOW!  this was a great dinner and everyone loved it (except 1 who didn't care for feta cheese)!  this is fast, easy and a great switch from the regular ol' dinner salad.  will make again and again!

After all the rave reviews here, I made this last night. I did some thing differently: Calamata Olives (sub for black olives), sun dried tomatoes, strawberry tomatoes halved (so sweet and good), 1 bulb roasted garlic, no mushrooms or green onions. I also roasted red and yellow peppers and added them in. Instead of the dressing here, I made the "Absolutely Fabulous Dressing" on this site. It turned out so darn good, even my chef boyfriend loved it. Lots of people noted leaving out the pepperoni, I advise against that unless you are serving vegetarians. It really adds a good kick to it. LOVED IT!!! Thanks so much.

We loved this salad.  I used bowtie pasta and didn't have any fresh red peppers so used a jar of roasted ones instead.  The the mix of flavors was perfect and not so sour as store bought Greek salads.  My teenagers also gave it 5 stars and said it was a nice change to go with our salmon dinner.  Will make this one again!

I really like this recipe and will make it again, but I think there is enough sweetness to the peppers and tomatoes that I will leave the sugar out of the dressing.  I was going to add capers, (also very Greek) but decided not to because I put them in a browned butter sauce over the tilapia I threw on the grill (I use a perforated pizza pan that I have dedicated to the grill so that the fish won't fall through the grate... but I digress!)  Next time, I think I might throw in some fresh spinach or the capers... and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to brighten it up.  Very good as written, but like all good recipes, can stand up to some tweaking!

I made this pasta salad for a baby shower.  I had 30 people over, so I used a package of seashell pasta and served a large amount in a roasting pan.  It fed a crowd and looked elegant at the same time.  I would definitely make it again.  Thank you!

This was an amazing salad.  So wonderfully different.  I too found that it made more though.  I made a recipe for 6 for a pot luck and it made a huge bowl as I found it could take more pasta and veggies to the amount of dressing.  I also trippled the amount of cheese.  It was a rave.

Absolutely wonderful! Only thing to be cautious of, is that the serving size when changed to 12 actually filled 2 roaster pans full and fed 25 plus. no complaint but you get much more than the serving size indicates. I'll be eating leftovers for a week, yum.

It was easy to make and tasted pretty good, but could have used a bit more flavor. I used the full amount of red wine vinegar but it would probably taste better if I had used half balsamic like some other people did. Also, I [supposedly] made 2 servings, but it made much more than that - enough for about 4 people.

Yummy! I like that this pasta salad recipe that does not have the usual "italian dressing, carrot and broccoli pieces". I used 3/4 of the amount required for oil and vinegar, so that the vinegar wasn't too overpowering.

This is a really good greek salad that you can take for picnics or to group events. Not too greasy either. A little bland, but if you add more pepperoni it helps.

We love this recipe. The first time I made it by the recipe except I omitted the pepperoni, that just adds fat. The next time I used green olives and added a two Tbs. of the olive vinegar per 4 servings, omitted the ripe olives and the fetta cheese, reducing even more calories. I top with fresh grated romano at the table. This is a very good low fat salad we will enjoy over and over.
 Thank you and God bless you.

This was an excellent pasta salad!!  I made it for a bridal shower, and all the ladies raved about it!  I left out the pepperoni, since there were a few vegetarians in the group.. but it still tasted great. I also used rainbow rotini pasta for more color. I prepared it the evening before, and added 1/2 the dressing at night, and the rest right before the shower started.

I made this for Thanksgiving!  My dad was stationed in Greek once...he came back and made a greek salad.  It was so wonderful.  I searched and searched for a good recipe and found this one.  It was so wonderful, I made one the next day too.  Everyone just loved it!  I didn't put that much pepperoni in it.  I thought this was much.  I think that I only put maybe 3-4 ounces of pepperoni in it.  And I don't like olives...so on my second salad, I used green peppers.  Thanks so much

I have made this recipe 4 times so far. I love it. I use grape tomatoes instead, so people can pick them out easily if they don't like them.
Really you should try this at least once.

Took this to a picnic and it was a big hit! People have even asked me for the recipe. I changed somethings though, I did not use any of the seasonings and instead chopped and sliced all of my other ingredients. Then I poured Greek Salad Dressing on (it was cheaper) and it turned out great. It taste even better overnight.

I used a bottled dry seasoning called Salad Supreme, which had all the seasonings called for in the recipes, and then some.  It adds a nice "kick" to this great recipe.  I started out sprinkling a little at a time, then stirring and tasting, as the seasoning is very flavorful.

took this to a recent dinner get-together with friends, and they all LOVED it! i thought one of them was going to eat the whole bowl!

definitely a must-try!  you could also use other colors of bell pepper for a festive look. 

warning--this recipe makes much more than you think!

This is a wonderful summer salad and perfect as a side dish for a barbeque.  I added a touch more sugar to the dressing, roughly a half of a teaspoon, to sweeten it up just a bit more.  I also added yellow and orange peppers, along with the red.  It was beautiful!

I made this with the suggested modifications of cutting down the oil and adding 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar.  Letting it marinate overnight did dry it out. I should have tried the original recipe first before trying the modifications.

Really delicious and a great main dish. To keep it a dailry meal and lower the cholesterol a bit I substituted Vege pepperoni slices for the meat slices and used a 1/2 cup fat free Italian dressing, 1/4 cup redwine vinegar and 1/4 cup olive oil.

This was an excellent pasta salad. Made a double recipe a day ahead. Used rotini pasta and orange pepper. Added a half jar of leftover artichoke hearts.  Many of my guests only took a small portion at first asking a little skeptically "what is this?". They all went back for more, and several asked for the recipe!

Excellent basic recipe, easily adaptable to whatever veggies you want to add. I also use the brine from green (and/or Klamath) olives and oil from the artichoke hearts. I upped the garlic considerably and used mix of Italian Herbs.

Great recipe! Followed reviewers suggestions:
1) 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 club balsamic vinegar
2) chopped and cooked red peppers before adding
3) used sausage instead of pepperoni (personal preference)

I used the pepperoni that you buy for pizza; The round pepperoni slices. Instead of slicing the pepperoni in strips I left the circles alone and put them in the salad. I used a different kind of pasta because I didn't have enough of the elbow macaroni. I used Rigatoni pasta. Instead of red bell peppers I used a large green bell pepper. The salad was AMAZING!!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

I was looking for something to serve with a couple variations of greek inspired burgers and this was just perfect.  Simple, clean flavors.  I used a bit less oil and vinegar and left out the pepperoni just out of personal preference.

I used twice as much pasta (a whole box) so I had to dress it with a little extra EVOO before I served it.  I also did it as a bar, so people could add olives, feta, cucumber, celery, etc only if they wanted to.

Amazing pasta salad!  I made this for my daughter's graduation party.  Everyone loved it!  In fact I had a someone request this recipe from me, so I will definitely make this again.  I did, however, make some changes.  Instead of black olives I used Kalamata olives, I replaced the mushrooms with cucumbers, I added pepperoncini and left out the pepperoni.  I also used red, yellow and orange peppers to add color to the salad.   I do think that next time I may cut down the amount of the dressing, there was quite a bit in the bottom of the bowl.

The flavor was awesome!  I used sliced turkey sausage to help lower the fat and half of the vinegar.  This was great, thank you :)

Used combo of olive oil - acv & lemon juice and that did not give it flavor so I added to it the red wine and balsamic vinegar with sugar -- and BAM that's what it needed!-- Sauted  some mushrooms- used fresh basil- red & green peppers- quartered some cucumber- vidalia onion- lots of spinach- no meat -leave the tomato on top while marinating & put feta and parm in right before-- VERY TASTY

I didn't have black olives or feta cheese on hand, so this ended up being more of an Italian salad than a Greek salad, but my wife and son both loved it, as did I. I look forward to making this as the Greek salad for which it was written, but if you are missing  olives and/or feta cheese, don't sweat it. The salad is still excellent.

My first taste indicates yumminess.  I made this last using Rotini pasta and also made a few changes along the way.  Instead of 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar, I used 1/4 cup plus a 1/4 cup of White balsamic vinegar.  Make sure you use white balsamic vinegar if you don’t want the colour changing.  I did all the recommended spices plus I added 1.5 teaspoons of Greek Seasoning.  I substituted kalamata olives for black because in a Greek dish they should be.  I omitted both mushrooms and pepperoni.  While I love them both, I don’t want them in my pasta salad.  I did add artichoke hearts, diced long English cucumber and 1/2 of a sliced red onion.  I tasted it this morning and letting sit overnight so the flavours meld is a must.  I’m going camping tomorrow so it’s coming along for the trip.

I had to make some changes to meet dietary needs but it was a big hit!  I brought this to a dinner party and needed it to be  gluten free, cow milk free & vegetarian.  I used rice pasta, goat cheese & left out the meat.  I also left out the sugar.  Everyone loved it including the kids.

I made this salad using rye noodles (Spirelli style) and I omitted the sausage to make it vegetarian...DELICIOUS.   I found that the salad only needed a few hours to chill in the fridge before eating.  Thanks for this easy-to-make, fantastic recipe.

Another very good recipe! This compliments the Grilled Greek Chicken quarters ....... So Awesome, used Cavatappi Pasta and replaced the pepperoni with bacon, used only 2/3 of the dressing ingredients, next time will use mayo as opposed to the olive oil and red wine to see if it tastes just as good as a macaroni salad.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make, Ive been doing it for years with some mods. I cut the mushrooms and bell peppers completely because they’re not my favorite, and I cut the pepperoni because I have a sensitivity to processed meats. I do a full regular sized bag of elbow macaroni (which might be more than this calls for), a whole container of cherubs sliced in half, a bigger can of olives, a whole little container of feta, and a bundle of green onion tops then I make the dressing essentially to a T except I cut the sugar to 1/2 instead of 3/4 a teaspoon. I love the sour vinegar with the sweet juicy tomatoes

I made this last night and scaled it for 4 servings with some leftovers, I added a bit more sugar as we don't like it too vinigery and added mixed beans, black olives, diced red peppers and mushrooms. leave it in the fridge and keep some marinade separate to add once serving. make sure you mix the salad often.

This pasta salad is fantastic. I always feel pasta salad is sort of bland but this dressing is vinegar forward and I love it. I used half white balsamic in the vinegar as previously suggested.

Great salad that went over well at a recent potluck. I used a pound of pasta so doubled the dressing (ended up not using quite all of it). I subbed roasted red peppers instead of fresh and left out the mushrooms. Also added  artichoke hearts. We LOVE feta so added more of that .

Like many of the other reviewers suggested, I replaced half of the red wine vinegar with balsamic the first time I made it and followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I found the recipe made too much dressing, so I halved that and added more veggies and pasta, but kept the herbs and spices as it's written. It's delicious, my husband loves it and it is even better the next day!

Loved it as it is. The dressing is amazing and different, a great change from typical mayo based dressings. My family is of Greek heritage and I have been looking for Recipes such as this. I'll be making this again!!

Prepared salad according to recipe using  sauteed chicken breast that I marinated in Greek dressing for at least 1 hour.  I first made the dressing for this salad with the balsamic vinegar substituted for half the red wine vinegar. I tasted it and really disliked it. Please, taste your dressing before incorporating  into your pasta salad! I poured that dressing down the old drain and made another batch, as written in the original recipe, and it was perfect! Also added some fresh chopped zucchini.

I added a small jar of artichokes, only used 1/3 a cup of red wine vinager and only 2 cups chopped mushrooms.  I also used tricolor rigatoni.  It was very good!  Much better after it sat in the refrigerator over night.  Will make again for sure.  It was super easy to make!

Made this for a potluck and it was a hit!  Will def make it again.  The only change I would make is decrease the amount of red wine vinegar. I found it to be too strong. However, I was the only one that thought that. Lol.

I have to per-taste the basil and oregano when I make this.  My wife is very sensitive to bitter tastes, and these spices can be quite bitter.

I followed the recipe  except for the black olives.  I used calamari olives.  This recipe is excellent, it taste exactly like  a Greek salad.  I will definitely make this many more times!  I think it will be my new macaroni salad.  Hubby also loved it. This Greek zoodle salad was great!! Louisa

I made a couple changes per a couple of the other reviews.  I used the bow tie pasta, and all three bell peppers.  I added the artichoke hearts and left everything else about the same.  It was for a party and everyone loved it!  Thank you so much for sharing.

Update: May 28, 2019

I made this again for a Memorial BBQ, this time I followed the directions exactly as stated and did not like it as well.  So I think I will make a couple changes permanent.   No mushrooms and replace with the artichoke hearts.  Next time I will leave the pepperoni whole, attempting to slice them in batches, just made them stick together.  This time I used the multi colored pasta spirals and I think the bow ties work better.  And if I know me, the last time I made it I added more spices, my usual go to's so will use them next time also.  

A great starter recipe all around, please do not be offended that I make changes, I make changes to all my recipes to suit my tastes.

I made this recipe with the balsamic vinegar/cider vinegar combo suggested instead of the wine vinegar.  Took the recipe to my daughter's and used her fresh basil instead of the dried and it was delicious.  Her family loved it too.  It's been stifling hot-- this was a great option with a little cubed cooked chicken in it too.

I loved, loved, loved this pasta salad!!!!  I followed the basic recipe, and upon reading some of the other reviews, I decided to change a few things.  The changes I made were I added one cucumber, green olives, and chick peas (drained), I omitted the mushrooms in fear they may get mushy, or leave that dirt taste that mushrooms can sometimes leave behind. This was the kind of salad you can add everything including the kitchen sink .  Delish!!!!

5 Star, but did tweak. Did not make the recipe entirely as stated, so not sure it is fair to rank, but we really loved the salad with a few minor tweaks. We used rotini pasta as we thought it would be a nice change from the macaroni noodle and we added cucumber as a nice refreshing touch. We did not use pepperoni, as we preferred to keep it meatless. I made half of the dressing quantities with the oil and vinegar, but used the fully spice amounts and it was perfect for our tasting. I let it sit for the 2 hours mentioned and it was very delicious and a hit with the the buffet lunch we served it at. I have no doubt it would be even more delicious if left to sit and marinate a bit longer.

Awesome pasta salad! I used shredded fresh basil instead of dried basil, and about 4 cups of pasta instead of 2 1/2. I would add more basil and pepper next time though.

We enjoyed this recipe but boy the vinegar can cross your eyes if you're not used to sour. I may cut the oil and vinegar in half next time I make this. My son really wanted to add some red pepper flakes to the dressing so I let him. I decided it needed some salt and pepper and about double the sugar. None of those additions hurt it one bit. I added green pepper in addition to red because I had half of one sitting in my fridge in need of use. I also substituted green onion for red onion. We used veggie rotini pasta instead of macaroni and the mini pepperoni made especially for salads. I absolutely loved the mushrooms in it and the way they soaked up the dressing. Yummy!

Amazing recipe. It was my first time making this type of pasta salad and I'll make it again. I cut the red wine vinegar down to a 1/4 cup. I added an extra 1/2 cup of feta cheese, I added about 1 cup of raw spinach and substituted extra mushrooms and red and green peppers instead of olives. I also added more pasta Highly recommend this recipe. It easy, affordable and tastes amazing!

I made this as an app/side dish for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I did reduce the amount of vinegar and white wine by a 1/4 and it was the perfect amount. I also brought it to my boyfriend's families house and his mother's reaction to this dish was "you now have my approval to marry my son."

I recommend making this a day in advance. The flavor soaks into the noodles better and everything tastes great on the second day! This is one of the best and easiest greek pasta recipes I've ever tried.

Delicious! We make this every year for Christmas and remove the meat and feta for a vegan option. Still tastes delicious a couple days after too!

We make the dressing on the side so as not to soak the salad.  We've stopped using pasta because we find it tastes lighter and more fresh without it.

Our preferred veggies:
3 chopped bell peppers--red, green & yellow
1 carton cherry tomatoes, halved
1 whole cucumber, peeled and chopped
1/2 red onion, chopped
1/4 cup calamata olives, halved
1/4 cup green stuffed pimiento olives, halved
1/4 cup mild banana peppers, halved

Sometimes we buy the feta cheese block soaked in brine and cut 1/4 inch slices and place on top, not the crumbled feta is good too.

We also prefer eating the salad fresh instead of chilled as the olive oil conceals if chilled.

Followed recipe but the pasta soaked up all the dressing and was really dry.  I did make more dressing and added it right before serving but I would be aware that you could get caught at a crucial time with a too dry pasta salad.  BUT - guests loved it and all was consumed.

Very good pasta salad.  Been making this for years.  Daughter requested it for her wedding.  Don't  understand the addition of sugar, that doesn't belong in a salad.

I forgot that I was going to bring this to a picnic until 6 hours before I was to serve it. I had read the reviews saying it needed overnight chilling. Oh, well. After I cooked and drained the pasta, I put it back into the pot. I added 4 cups of ice cubes, a cup of half water and half white vinegar, and mixed it up. The ice cubes stops the pasta from cooking, chills the pasta quickly and keeps the pasta from clumping without using oil. I did NOT put it in the fridge, but left it sit on the counter. I mixed the dressing ingredients in a separate bowl. I chopped all of the vegetables and put them in a large bowl. I used hard salami instead of pepperoni (personal preference). I poured the dressing on the vegetables and mixed gently. I let that sit on the counter, too. About every 20 minutes, I stirred the pasta gently. I also stirred the vegetables. When the ice cubes were melted, I thoroughly drained the chilled pasta, added the vegetables and was able to refrigerate for 2 hours before serving. It was absolutely delicious. The crowd loved it!

Made it and changed it up by  using kielbasa sausage and followed the half amount of oil and vinegar suggestion.  I used white balsamic vinegar and the result was fantastic.  Also used artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers instead of the mushrooms and fresh red peppers.  Served it after letting it sit at room temp for two + hours and it was very tasty.

Loved every bite of this. I used orzo instead of macaroni and I used turkey pepperoni instead of sausage. This is so good! It's definitely a good one for potlucks.

It really annoys me when people rate a recipe without having made it and change significant ingredients, like olives in a Greek salad!  Olives are a prominent ingredient in Greek cooking. If you don't like them and omit them and other important ingredients, please call it anything but GREEK Pasta Salad! I agree with the reviewer that reduced the vinegar content in the salad. It was a bit too much vinegar. Otherwise, great and authentic!

Great recipe. REALLY didn't like the pepperoni notion, though not a veggie, and short of peppers but shoved in artichokes instead and a little extra feta, as advised by many cooks here. Fantastic!!!!

I make a pasta salad very much like this. Everyone always likes the pepperoni, but I use turkey pepperoni because in a cold dish regular pepperoni can be greasy.

Very good!

My adjustments: 1. Omit pepperoni. 2. Increase feta cheese to 1 C. 3. Use Kalamata olives instead of black olives.

Many reviewers say they love the strong vinegar taste of this salad. I normally like vinegar a lot, but this was a bit too much for me. There was a lot of dressing, and it puddled in the bottom of the bowl. Otherwise, it was a delicious burst of Greek flavor! There is a lot of room to improvise with this recipe, if you are so inclined.

Next time I'll decrease red wine vinegar to 1/4 C, increase sugar to 1 tsp, increase macaroni to 2 C dried (just because I love it), and leave everything else the same. Definitely leave it in the fridge overnight. Depending on how salty your olives are, you may or may not need to add salt to taste just before serving.

This is delicious as is but I did make some changes based upon what I had on hand for an impromptu dinner party. I used fresh basil and oregano which adds a whole new level of deliciousness! And I'm a fan of balsamic vinegar but I cut it back to 1/4cup.

This was so yummy! I don't like mushrooms or tomatoes so did not use any of those. I think next time I may put more noodles in to stretch it out. I also only had white balsalmic vinegar onhand and used it but it was a bit too strong. Maybe use a little less next time. Flavors blended well.

Great recipe.  Instead of 1/2 cup red wine vinegar, I used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar.  I also put the dressing ingredients into the Vitamix for a minute to blend the dressing, then stirred into the salad.

Had to tweek this recipe a little but it was still great!  And my husband loved it.  Instead of the Greek cheese I used mozzarella, no black olives and turkey pepperoni.  Loved the flavor.  Since my husband likes blue cheese, I'll try it that way and use real pepperoni.  Also used half red vinegar and half balsamic vinegar (pomegranate flavor). Great flavoring.  And chilling overnight is the key.

I love making the dressing, it's perfect (in my opinion) for a pasta salad or on an Italian sub. Everyone, who has eaten the pasta salad or Italian subs I've made with this recipe's dressing, raves about how delicious they are.

Excellent pasta salad.  I made it as a side for a picnic lunch at a natural spring with my girlfriend.  Be careful....since when we got home I was informed that packing a lunch was my job from now on.  It was that good.

my whole family lovewd it.. they liked it more than the italian pasta salad ive made before. I followed the recipe except i left out mushrooms for personal dislike, and i used egg noodles because we had them and they tasted fine. I also added a pinch of thyme and a little more basil to the sause because i wanted more flavor. overall this is a great recipe and i am going to make it again soon.

I modified this recipe, after trying it as described and hating it. I found the pepperoni greasy and overpowering.  I omitted the pepperoni the second time I made it and it received rave reviews at a barbeque we held.

I LOVE this salad! I have made it several times for family and parties and everyone loves it. I often make a big batch and we eat it throughout the week.
The 'dressing' mixture has the perfect flavor and I don't change a thing! And as others have said, it tastes even better the next day since the herbs have a chance to release their flavor. That's why I gave this recipe 5 stars.
When I make it, I mix together all the herbs and liquid and add the feta and very finely diced (I use the slap chop :) olives(usually green pimiento) and red onion(instead of the green). Then I add bell peppers, cucumber, cherry tomatoes and cooked rotini. That's it!
Try it and play with what you add :)

This was a hit when I served it at my friend's dinner party.  I added salami to it as well as garlic and herb feta cheese.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe.  I did refrigerate this overnight and prior to serving I added some Zesty Italian dressing and stirred it in the pasta salad mix.  I added a couple of shakes of garlic powder as well, but not too much because I added the Zesty Italian dressing as well.

This was truly the best pasta salad.  I substituted kalamata olives for black olives and omitted the mushrooms.  My family and guests loved it.   This will be my "go to" recipe anytime I need to make pasta salad.

This recipe was fantastic!  Definitely, the salad is best the day after it's made, but it was still quite good after a couple of hours in the refrigerator..  I used about a cup and a half of mushrooms (instead of three cups) and I added a half a can of garbanzo beans.  I loved the zing that the red wine vinegar added, so I would not change the vinegar/oil ratio at all.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you!

I made this the night before to let the flavors blend together and it turned out really good. The only difference I made was adding extra noodles and used turkey pepperoni instead. I will definitely be making this again.

I made a few substitutions, but it was very good. I did find the vinaigrette to be too vinegary. I will use less next time -- and there will be a next time.

We loved the salad, but next time I am going to use half the dressing with a 1/4 olive oil and 2 tbsp. red wine vinegar and 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar. My son thought the vinegar was too strong and I thought it had two much oil.

Really liked this recipe!  I scaled the recipe for "16" servings, added sliced black olives instead of whole, used 1/2 red wine and 1/2 balsamic vinegar, rotini noodles instead of macaroni, red & green peppers, fresh garlic instead of garlic powder (don't use) and added a seedless cucumber (because we love!!) everything else the same.  Next time I make this, I will use the noodles called for in the recipe as "Rotini" takes away from the other flavors (too much pasta).  I will use LESS VINEGAR, although we LOVE vinegar the amount listed was just TOO MUCH!!  Again, it took away from all the other flavors, especially Feta cheese which has a strong flavor as is and we could barely taste the cheese!  Everything else I would do the same except maybe add a little seasoned salt to the mix to balance out the flavors.  This is definitely a keeper and I'm making it again next week for a fourth of July party with the changes above.  My family from ages 8 to 54 really liked this recipe although my husband thought a little "TOO MUCH" vinegar as well.  All my boys had seconds! Served with Barbeque pulled pork sandwiches and corn on the cobb!  YUM YUM!  As to the Four (4) star rating, too much vinegar as written is all.  Everything else was perfect.  Thank you so much for a GREAT RECIPE!

This is by far the most delicious pasta salad EVER! The sauce is amazing, and very simple to make. I used small shells instead of elbow macaroni, and I had some broccoli on hand that I threw in. And to keep it meat-free, I eliminated the pepperoni. It's utterly divine and I'll be making it again and again - thank you!

this is delicious! i tried it right after making it and it tasted great to me :) will probably be even better tomorrow. i made a couple changes due to what i had. i used dried cheese tortellini that i had left over and cut the marinade in half. glad i did because I only had 2 cups of tortellini and the 1/2 amount was perfect. i also omitted the red peppers and green onions just cuz i didnt have it on hand. great base for adding and omitting

This is my absolute favorite pasta salad and my family requests it often! I am not a fan of mushrooms, so I add artichoke hearts instead. As others have suggested, I cut the oil in half and double the vinegar (I use balsamic). I also use fresh garlic! Awesome!

I used tricolor rotini instead of elbow macaroni and sliced olives instead of whole and it turned out wonderful!! It is absolutley delicious and everyone at the football party loved it! The tricolor rotini really makes for a nice presentation as well! Definitely will make again for my family and gatherings!

Delicious salad. I did have to change quantities on most of the items. More or less depending on what it was. Way too many mushrooms. Once I scaled everything to fit my taste, it tasted great. Would definitely make again.

I made this salad for a cookout at work and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as shown except that I used tri-colored rotini pasta.

Yum!  Fresh and tasty pasta salad.  It has the right amount of zing.  I replaced the tomatoes and added in english cucumber for a nice crunch.  Thanks for sharing!

I replaced the red wine vinegar with balsamic and a white reduced balsamic. You need less of the reduced balsamic, which can be bought already prepared.  It is a little thicker than regular balsamic and gave it a really nice flavor.  you just have to play with the amount you like.  It was a huge hit at the party.  No one could stop eating it.

Too much oil---I would change to 1/3 cup instead of 1/2 of oil.  Would match that with the red wine vinegar amount as well.  OR, you could add more pasta and other ingredients to make a bigger batch.  Wonderful flavor and awesome combo of ingredients.  Love it!

Great pasta salad! I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used roasted bell pepper strips. I also omitted the mushrooms and pepperoni. I added artichoke hearts as well. I substituted pitted kalamari olives instead of black olives as I prefer these in a Greek style salad. Finally, I used brown rice pasta to keep this gluten free! Yum!

This is a fantastic Greek pasta salad. I followed some reviews that other people had posted and only used half the amount of red wine vinegar and added balsamic instead. I used only about a cup of mushrooms, and added a cucumber as well. Leaving it in the fridge overnight is key! The flavors mesh together overnight and then it is wonderful! This would be a perfect make ahead dish to bring to work, or a cookout.

This was a hit for a smaller gathering at our home. I made a big batch. The nonpasta salad lovers enjoyed it, and everyone gladly took some home. 

I stayed true to the base recipe with minor changes. First, I used rotini pasta and fresh herbs instead of dried. I included a leaf of sage and a bit of rosemary with the listed herbs, chopping them all together finely. Replaced green onions with chopped red ones. Skipped the pepperoni. 

Thanks Behr. Pasta salads usually aren't a go-to dish for me, but I will definitely make this again.

Used 1 1/2 tablespoons each of fresh chopped basil and oregano instead of 1 1/2 tsp dried. Also, I used rotisserie chicken in place of the pepperoni and a few kalamata olives rather than a can of whole black olives. All-in-all, a solid pasta salad recipe.

A delicious and beautiful salad!  I didn't have mushrooms so I left those out and doubled up on the red bell peppers.  I didn't have green onions so I used red, and I think that was even better.  I'm vegetarian so I left out the sausage and added green pepper and artichokes instead.  Fantastic salad, thanks for the recipe!

All the ingredients are spot-on.  This is an incredibly fresh-tasting salad that's so easy to make but looks so complex and gourmet.  The oregano and basil vinegarette complement everything wonderfully, though I did accidentally use 1.5 tablespoons of each spice, not teaspoons, which ended up being the perfect amount for me and I will intentionally add more of each next time.

Used the House Greek dressing recipe from this site and otherwise substituted a can of quartered plain artichoke hearts for the mushrooms/ used green peppers instead of red in squares about the size of the bow tie pasta instead of elbow /red onion quarter rings instead of the green/halved greek olives instead of black.  I figured these replacements were the items I'd have used for a regular greek salad ... overnight really lets the flavors come together and love what that FETA does.  Yummy!!! My husband didn't want to share this dish to pass (like another reviewer).  I offered extra dressing when serving this with my one change to that recipe being 1:1 on the oil vinegar ratio and a bit of sugar.  Scaled that recipe down.

Fabulous! Of course it can be customized with whatever vegetables you like. The dressing is great. I would MAYBE add a little more sugar.

This pasta salad is delicious. I made a Greek inspired dinner and it went very well. It was perfect for people who were hungry before the entire dinner was ready. Everyone loved it here. I'm sure I will be making it again very soon.

Very colorful and appetizing...I added cucumbers, fresh basil and marinated artichoke hearts. Definitely a keeper...only change I would make would be to use only 1/3 cup vinegar. Delicious!

The dressing for this is really tasty, with the just the right amount of zing and very little added sugar.  I'm not a fan of adding pepperoni/salami to my pasta salads, so I skipped that.  Overall, pretty darn good!

Very nice salad with a few changes.  The dressing was very tangy so I added a bit more olive oil.  I also left out the mushrooms because of personal preference.  Since I didn't have any pepperoni or macaroni on hand, I substituted deli sliced smoked ham meat and rotini pasta.  The ham added the same saltiness as the sausage would.

Absolutely delicious! I used whole grape tomatoes instead of sliced cherry tomatoes, because that was what was at my local store. The sauce is divine. I suggested this recipe to a friend who is vegetarian to try without the pepperoni, and she loved it.

Very good! The only issue I had was the dressing was a little too heavy on the red wine vinegar. I added additional sugar (just to taste) and it balanced out the flavours.

this is delicious. It makes a lot which is great because the leftovers last for a long time and still taste amazing. I kept eating it for lunch for days to come. What I love is how you can customize it so easily to your own taste. I don't like peppers so I replaced them with more tomatoes and olives. It really is my favorite recipe here.

This is a good recipe! I used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (instead of 1/2 cup red wine vinegar) and everyone loved the flavor! I left out the mushrooms and feta cheese. Next time I will also leave out the green onions, it made some bites a little too bitter! Otherwise, a fantastic recipe and a real crowd pleaser.

I didn't have time to make ahead so I just rinsed the pasta for a very long time in very cold water.  I also sauteed the fresh mushrooms in canola oil before adding to the salad.  I added Antipasta green olives with peppercinis.  I used my own dressing which is balsamic/red wine/olive oil with pepper, seasoning salt, garlic salt, onion salt, oregano, basil and roasted garlic.  I just put the dressing in the claret and everybody added how much they wanted.  This salad is great with colored peppers, red onion, a little celery and tomatoes.  I also used a pizza grinder for more seasoning on top of the pasta.  I never put the dressing on the pasta salad because everyone in my house likes a different amount, or sometimes a different kind.  I used the basil and oregano from the jar, not the dry kind and mixed a little of each into the pasta salad as well as the dressing.  This was great the first day and on subsequent days and can be used as a main dish or a side dish.  I even packed some in lunches.  Great and versatile recipe.

This dish was EXCELLENT!!! I made it for a group of picky men and they were going back for thirds and fourths!  I did use a combo of Balsamic Vinegar and Red Wine Vinegar, and I threw in some quartered artichoke hearts because I really like them.  Super recipe!! This now has a top spot in my party dish rotation!  Thanks!

Delicious as it is!  I added grilled Chicken the second time to give it a little more protein, and quality pepperoni makes a difference.  The longer it sits the better it gets!

I made this for my parents' 50th birthday party recently.  I tripled all of the ingredients except I only doubled the red wine vinegar.  It came out great!  I made it a day ahead of time and left it in the fridge for a little over 24 hours.  Didn't add the onion or bell pepper (not a big fan of either) but did add onion powder.  I also added artichoke hearts.  The only thing I would change next time would be to substitute the cherry tomatoes for sliced sundried tomatoes.  I think I would like that better.  Over all - very good!

I ran out of red bell pepper, and it was still good. Try to eat it within a couple days, though, as I found the mushrooms got brown and mushy after a few days. If you make this for a group, though, this shouldn't be a problem.

delicious! I also used less oil/vinegar (and even then, the pasta on the bottom of the bowl was pretty vinegar-y,) and I substituted artichoke hearts for some of the mushrooms-people loved that! And I didn't put any meat in.

Oh my Greek goodness!  Nothing short of spectacular!  Don't forget the pepperoni, it adds a nice peppery zing.  I added 1 seeded and chopped cucumber and used EVOO in place of regular olive oil.  Everything else as is!  Perfecto!!

Tried this on a whim and EVERYONE loves it! I've made it for the school I work at and it was the most popular dish. Usually I increase the Feta and omit the bell peppers (simply don't have them in the house). Can't go wrong!

Wasn't a favorite of mine. The ingredients sounded so good, but was disapointed with final product.For me I think it was to many strong flavors trying to compete with each other. Although it was liked by my family I don't think I will make again.

I was looking for a Greek style vegetarian main dish and saw potential with this recipe.  With some modifications I made the perfect summer salad, high in protein and healthy!  Instead of pasta I used quinoa.  After reading quite a few reviews I did the following: omitted mushrooms, subbed in roasted red peppers, changed black olives for kalamatas, added cucumbers, used a combo of green and red peppers and completely left out the pepperoni.  I halfed the recipe for the dressing but kept original proportions, though instead using THREE cloves of garlic instead of dried.  I topped each serving with feta as opposed to mixing it with the dish in its entirety was glad I did so, it looked nice and then we could control the amounts.  Next time will definitely try the artichoke suggestion!  Thanks!

I am rating this on the sauce alone.  I didn't have all the veggies for the recipe so I just tossed some cooked pasta with the sauce, LOTS of feta and Kalamata olives.  I added balsamic vinegar and more red wine vinegar to it.  It was good last night and I am hoping it is even better today.

Excellent.  I followed the recipe using solely Red Wine Vinegar and am glad I did.  Taste was awesome.  I added some red onion and cucumber and omitted the olives.  One of these recipes that if you follow the base, you can't lose because adding your favorites will guarantee good results.  Will make again.

I made this for a potluck and got tons of compliments!  It was great.  I doubled the recipe.  Having made pasta salads before, I thought this one might not have enough dressing, but not so!  The proportions were perfect.  There was a even a little bit left over and my best friend came over the next day wanting to help me finish off the left overs.  I recommend this one highly!!

This is really good and easy.  I left out the pepperoni and served it with chicken skewers for a nice spring dinner.
Add artichokes, red onion & cucumber

Very good recipe.Fresh, lite and very easy. I didn't use any mushrooms and used light olive oil and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Turned out great. While making dressing i didn't change proportions and ended up with too much dressing, nearly enough for two salads,so next time i'll cut it half. Me and my husband enjoyed this salad very much. Thank a lot!

I made this the other night with my daughter and the whole family lived it. We tweeked a few things though like instead of black olives we used kalamata olives and the "colorful" macaroni. Overall this was a delicious meal and I will be making it again.

This just really didn't pop with me.  It was a little oily.  I made it the night before and let it sit in the fridge just like some reviews said and like I usually make pasta salad but it just wasn't good.  I like all of the "salad stuff" though.  One thing I thought would definately make it better was using fresh herbs.  If I ever make this again I will be cutting back on the oil just a little and deffinately using fresh herbs.

Very good.  My husband loved it.  The only change I made was using turkey pepperoni.  Even better after it sits overnight so the flavors can blend.

I'm giving this 5 stars as I am not a fan of pasta salad, but my guests all loved it.  I made the dressing exactly as written, and adjusted the ingrediants as follows: used rotini as that's what I had on hand, added artichokes, reduced the amount of mushrooms by half, used Kalamata olives, and omited the meat.  I let it marinade overnight, and then tossed it with a little extra dressing right before serving, as the pasta really absorbes it. Will definitely make again when I need to take a salad someplace.

This was spectacular! I thought the vinegar was just right but then I like mine tangy. What a great combo of flavors. I also subbed artichokes for mushrooms since we don't care for them. we'll make this one again!

Awesome pasta salad! This was my first time making it for my best friend's baby shower. My best friend didn't like it because she doesn't like "greek" tasting things, and also she is pregnant. But everyone else loved it! One girl even asked me if she could keep the rest. I left out the mushrooms and used salami instead of peperoni, and I used 3 parts olive oil and  about 1.5 parts red wine vinegar. I only used a tbsp of sugar. I loved it!

I've been looking for a great pasta recipe and this hit the mark. I left out the pepperoni for the vegetarians in the family, and added a few garlic stuffed green olives. It was super! A great addition to Easter dinner.

This was a typical yet good greek pasta salad to me. I used seashell pasta. I took a reviewers advice by only adding  1/4 evoo and vinegar. Added in some cucumber, yellow onion and green pepper, and no pepperoni. I served this with tossed romaine orange salad and chili lime kabobs from this site, made a very nice dinner.

Very good!  I made it the night before and by the next day it tasted just right.  I did add a bit of italian dressing in, simply because I love that flavor.  EDIT: Made this again today and thought I'd try the half balsamic vinegar/half white wine vinegar combo that many spoke of.  While I thought the flavor was good, I definitely felt like it was too overpowering.  I think next time I may either stick with the red wine or use mostly red wine with a bit of balsamic.

Absolutely yummy.  I love pasta salad!  I brought it to a cookout and found myself wishing no one would eat it so I could take it home for myself!  I have made it twice in 2wks!

I make this recipe frequently.  This is a wonderful salad to make for dinner at home, or for a pot luck.  I did modify the recipe a bit though.  I choose to omit the pepperoni and the pasta.  I added a cucumber (peeled, seeded and sliced).  Delicious!

This was great...especially the dressing!  I doubled it, and left out the basil, but it was fantastic.  I used rotini pasta, left out the pepperoni, and added fresh baby spinach for some extra color and vitamins.  Great light supper on a hot  summer night.  Delicious!!!

This was alright but instead of red wine vinegar, I used white, I also used chopped cucumber,green and red peppers, red onion and fresh chopped garlic. I also didn't use the mushrooms.

I followed this recipe exactly. It was just okay for me. I think it may have a bit too much vinegar, and it isnt very pretty the second day.

This is probably the best pasta salad I've made!  Takes a bit of time to cut the veggies but well worth it.  Only thing I did differently was use flavored (tomato-basil) feta cheese and cut up "whole" pepperoni.  Very good and filling.

This salad tastes GREAT and makes a very pretty presentation. It was perfect for a pot luck side dish. I substituted hard salami for pepperoni and used bow tie pasta instead of elbow. I did not measure the ingredients EXACTLY but added more or less to my taste. Also, a few pinches of salt for a finishing touch.  Thank you!

I made this for a women's group salad potluck. It was a colorful addition to the table. Very yummy and a nice complement for the usual array of tossed salads and creamy pasta salads at the potluck.

The great thing about this recipe is that you can customize it to your own personal tastes. We used rotini instead of elbow macaroni and also substituted grape tomatoes for cherry - just because I think they have more flavor. We left out the olives and pepperoni and used a feta flavored with Mediterranean herbs - really gave it an extra kick of flavor. We really liked it. When we make it again, I'm going to add grilled chicken to the recipe. Thanks for a great recipe that we will make again and again. It's the perfect thing for summer.

Great recipe, I am taking to a 4th of July picnic today.  I left out the mushrooms and olives, made w/tri-color pasta, and downscaled the dressing a little.  Tasted great, hope everyone else likes it!

This is a great pasta salad.  I made it for a cookout and it had nothing but raves.  I too left out the pepperoni sausage, didn't seem to need it.  Thanks I'll be making this again and again.

I got nothing but compliments on this salad, and I didn't take any home, so I think that speaks for itself.  We were a big group so I took another's advise, and used 12 oz pasta, increased the veggies a little and kept the dressing the same.  Make sure you refriderate overnight, it really needs to meld.  Thanks for a keeper!

Great recipe. I only had half the red wine vinegar, so I subbed Balsalmic for the other half- next time I will make an extra trip to the store if needed- the red wine vinegar would have been a little better. But, overall a very flavorful recipe. I recommend making at least the night before (it's even better the next day).

A definite keeper with a really great taste.  I put in a pound of pasta and it was fine.  Next time I'll add more veggies, maybe I'll try some roasted eggplant/zucchinni/red bell peppers.  Thanks!

This is an easy to make pasta salad!  Everytime I have to make a side dish for a party, my husband requests this.  I use green olives instead of black, but everything else I pretty much stick to.  It's definitely not your usual pasta salad - Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Easy to make and was a hit at my barbecue.  I had to add more pasta to compensate for the amount of marinade this makes.  One 16 oz. box of fusilli pasta did the trick!

My hubby wanted to eat the whole thing for himself and begged me to make something else for the potluck dinner.  I omitted the mushrooms and olives, personal preference, and used tri-colored spiral noodles instead of elbow, and red onion instead of green, to add more color.  I also doubled the sauce, which is delicious.

This was very tasty!  I had been using a different Greek pasta salad recipe that I liked, but this one is my new favorite.  Easy to make, but taste like you spent hours on it.

Yum -- a favorite.  I try to come up with excuses to make this.  I mixed it up last night and look forward to eating it for dinner with feta chicken.

Terrific pasta salad.  I make it without the pepperoni to eliminate some of the fat; and I use blue cheese because my husband does not care for feta.  It's still a great pasta salad.

First recipe I tried on this site.  I prepared it for a family get together.  Every bit was eaten.  It was fun trying something new.

I made this spur of the moment for a party and it was wonderful! I used colored pasta and did not have the pepperoni to add and it was still great! With this one you can change ingredients as desired because the dressing makes it!!

Excellent recipe.  The only problem with this recipe is that the vinegar seems to overpower it.  I would probably recommend using maybe 2/3 of the suggested amount.  Add more olives too.  Great recipe though.

This tasted nice.  The vinegar flavor was a little strong though.  I brought it to lunch the next day and a colleague noted that it looked good.  I used jumbo seashell pasta, left out the mushrooms and pepperoni, and used a larger can of olives.

Absolute delicious and different pasta salad. The only thing I did different was to sautee the onions first because I hate raw onions, and I diced the pepperoni and tomatoes. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

THE BEST...you'll never get a better greek salad recipe. Modify as you like, but the dressing makes the salad.  I left out mushrooms as everyone else did, and used sliced olives, but everyone loved it, and ate, more and more and more!  A signature salad. (Oh, I too used less pepperoni...7.5 oz. sliced package.)

I loved this. I used an italian herb vinegar and left out the spices, substituted kalamata olives for plain black, and didn't put in mushrooms (yuck) or red pepper (didn't have any). I LOVED this and will definitely make again. Also, I microwaved the pepperoni for 30 seconds and blotted with a paper towel to get rid of alot of the grease.

This is the best tasting pasta salad I have ever had. It's full of flavor and colors.  I used veggie pasta and wheat pasta to make it healthier

Served this as a side salad so omitted the pepperoni.  Made a day ahead and thought the mushrooms might wilt so left them out, too.  Used a green bell instead of red--still looked pretty and was a big hit.

Huge disappointment.  I doubled this for a barbeque I was having and ended up throwing out 95% of it.  The only thing I didn't follow was the pepperoni and am glad I didn't waste any more money on that.  I am not sure why this recipe got so many great reviews but I certainly can't agree on this one.  Sorry, but will not be using this one again.

Although my marks are low for this one, my husband did love this salad.  I did not care for it at all, but I just think it's a matter of personal taste.  The salad was colorful and the pepperoni, feta cheese and olives were wonderful, however, it was the dressing that I did not care for.  I just don't like the tast of an oil / vinegar dressing.  I may try this again, but with a different dressing.

This was awesome!  I added a roasted eggplant and didn't use mushrooms, also used orzo which ensured it wouldn't be too dry.  It was wonderful.  Hope I don't eat it all myself.

I Made this for our family Christmas party. I loved it so did everyone else! You get a fork full of pepperoni in every bite, and the olive oil, and feta cheese, make it really ethnic tasting! It's THE BEST!
