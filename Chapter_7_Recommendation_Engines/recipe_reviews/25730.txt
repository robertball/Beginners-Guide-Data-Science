I made this as written with two exceptions - I didn't have any nutmeg or onion powder so I left those out. Oh and I used less butter than called for. Anyway the soup was fantastic! Nice thick smooth texture. I used a bag of frozen California Blend veggies - broccoli cauliflower and carrots - and included the sliced celery also. I loved this and plan to make it many more times. I also froze about 1 and 1/2 portions so we'll see how well it freezes.

Very good. I will make this again. It is a different twist to the soup I usually make. I changed the veggies up based on what I had. I think this broth would work with almost any veggie combo.

I wasn't sure about this recipe but it turned out delicious! I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken and omitted the sherry. I also added more carrots and left out the green beans because I had some carrots I wanted to use up. I used shredded cheese instead of the processed stuff because that's what I had on hand. I think the texture would have been better if I had used the processed cheese but it was still an excellent soup. I will be making this one again.

My family isn' t all that fond of cauliflower and they liked this. Only real change is to cut the butter in half...really don't need that much fat. I was afraid to put 1 TB of garlic in at first....that is an awful lot...so tried half first and didn't taste it much and put the other half in. I did it in the crock pot and just put the dairy items (milk cheeses and corn starch water) in at the very end.

Surprisingly good...made 1/2 a batch. Used real onion didn't have onion pwder chopped (1/3c). Doubled the carrot & omiitted the sherry didn't have any. I think the cornstarch ration was a little too much b/c it make it took away from the chz taste a little so i added another ounce of cheese. I'll see how it is tates on day two. Day two: Made white rice and added to the soup. I think its even better like this.

Really good soup! i changed it a bit due to ingredients on hand. i started by halving the recipe using broccoli chopped carrots and cubed ham.(also cut up fresh onion and garlic) i used 3 chicken bullion cubes in 2cups of water. added one can of cheese soup and 1/2 c of milk. skipped the sherry. i used 1/6 c corn starch to 1/4c water. also added a sprinkling of real sharp cheese at the end. made with a loaf of homemade bread...DELICIOUS!!!!

Delicious and easy! I chopped all my veggies the night before so all I would have to do was dump everything in the pot. I also used skim milk to cut down on the fat content. This one is a keeper!

Fantastic soup- I imagine you could use any veggies we had a plethora of green beans so only used them and it was wonderful!

Yummy! I halved the recipe and subsituted frozen chopped onions rather than onion powder. I will use fresh garlic next time.

Yum! I left out the sherry & green beans(so upped the carrots & cauliflower) & reduced the garlic to 1 tsp due to personal preference. It was excellent & makes a ton!!

Okay but not a keeper. There was not a lot of flavor and the texture was a little gritty. Not sure if it would improve the recipe to use flour versus cornstarch or shredded cheddar cheese versus processed cheese. Don't care to try this again to find out but perhaps someone else might benefit.

This was perfect. I threw in all the veggies I had left in the fridge so not necessarily the same ones in your recipe but the base was perfect for a nice summer veggie soup!

I was scared of this recipe but it was actually pretty good. I wouldn't leave out the sherry like so many other reviewers are; it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I didn't like the diced celery or chopped carrots and it was more of a texture issue - I don't like crunchy soups! But the taste was great.

This was excellent. I cut the butter down to 2 tablespoons and found that it was still wonderful saved a bunch of calories too!

Excellent! I did not add the sherry or cauliflower because I did not have any. I used 4 cheese slices instead of all the cheese it called for. Very good. Will make again for sure!

Family rated from a 3.5 to a millimeter below a 5. Needed more cheese too much cheese not spicy enough... next time I'll have some grated cheese on the side and maybe add an additional vegetable like peppers which might give it the extra zest it needed. Definitely needed black pepper.

I just made this for lunch and it is delicious!! I used processed cheese slices instead of Velveeta and a bit over 1/2 pound which I think is plenty. I also cut down on the butter (maybe 2-3 tbsp) upped the celery skipped the green beans and just guessed on the cauliflower amount. I also used fresh onion and garlic instead of the powders. I was surprised by the amount of cornstarch but it is a perfect consistency. I've been standing at the stove 'tasting' for quite a while! so good!

Don't think I'm a fan of this one.  Easy enough but came out thinner than I thought it would and for some reason my cheese never completely melted, ( I used Cabot sharp cheddar).  Perhaps It should have been something like Velveeta?  The flavor  was lacking and a little to sweet for me.
Probably wont toss it out but won't make it again.
