This recipe was easy and very good!  I will definitely make this again.  I added beef broth and used italian seasoning instead of thyme.  This is one of our favorites!

I too am not a big fan of Thyme, so I used Italian Seasoning. I also coated the beef in flour before adding it to the rest of the ingredients, and used pearl onions. I would absolutely do this again.

A little runny - needs some cornstarch or something.  Otherwise very good!

Fantastic Beef stew.  I added in about 2+ cups of beef stock because 1/4 cup of water is not enough water for the amount of food in the slow cooker.  Turned out great.  This was the best stew we have made so far in our slow cooker.

Since I'm not a huge Thyme lover, I subbed my homemade Italian Seasoning. I also don't think just thyme & canned tomato products would make a very tasty sauce. I added beef broth, garlic and worcestshire (ms).

Not bad at all.  Pretty much followed the recipe, but added a packet of stew seasoning.  I think that was a mistake because it was awful salty.  I didn't add salt anywhere else.  I'm sure the broth added some though.  I also added Worcestershire, which added flavor, but probably salt as well.   Overall, it's a great "base" recipe that can be tweaked to your liking.

Oh man, this turned out so good.  i took some other's advice and didn't add thyme.  I put in italian seasoning.  Also added some potato flakes to thicken it up.  Will definitely do this one again.

Best beef stew recipe I've made.  You can't really taste the Thyme (which I'm not crazy for) and the leftovers are thickened perfectly.  I love beef stew and I'm sticking with this recipe.  I did use the no salt tomatoes and had to substitute tomato soup (15 oz, not condensed) for the paste.  I also used 2.5# of stew meat.

Disappointed in this stew. Way too much tomato taste. It tasted more like an italian dish with beef than an actual traditional beef stew. Maybe it needs beef broth or different seasonings... definitely needs less tomatoes.

didn't use thyme,  and did not use the tomato past.  I used 1 can of beef broth, and Italian seasoning.  Next time I would like to add some nice red wine to this.....I did add the canned diced tomatoes.  Also, at the very end added some leftover peas that we had from the night before for dinner.   I would make again,  and try the red wine.....so I did tweak it a bit....very good!

Very good and simple! Other recipes for beef stew are so complicated and require a fully loaded kitchen. This recipe has limited ingredients but creates a great stew. I added a half a pack of stew seasoning after reading other's reviews to tone down the tomato flavor but avoid the over salty taste. It was perfect.

The flavor was great.  I put in Italian seasoning as suggested to give it a more balanced flavor.  The only thing I didn't like was the aesthetics that were compromised by using a slow cooker 100% (that is that the meat gives off a foam and then leaves grayish little globs in the stew).

This was an amazing stew! I changed just a few things though. I added more water as suggested. I also used Italian seasoning and parsley,  a few cloves of garlic, beef bouillon cube and a squirt of ketchup instead of paste.  It was wonderful!!!

Great basic recipe if you are looking for a stew with red sauce rather than the brown gravy way.

This stew is just ok...don't think I would make it again bc I have another recipe that is much better. Thought I would try this one since it doesn't have many ingendents. Easy to make and taste fine but no big wow.

I was disappointed in this. I looked at the reviews and I made the recipe as directed, with the following changes based on what people had suggested: added a can of beef stock instead of water, seared the meat beforehand so it wouldn't make the stew bloody, and used Italian seasoning. I cooked it for 9 hours on low. The result was way too runny, I only taste tomatoes like everyone else has commented on, and the meat was horribly overdone and chewy. Now I have a huge pot of stew that I don't like. I won't be making this again.

I used this recipe yesterday, as it is written (I always start by using the recipe as the author wrote it)...It came out bland and watery. I feel like it needs something to thicken it and needs a lot more flavor, the Thyme alone isnâ€™t enough. I may try this again using the suggestions of others (flour the beef - maybe season it too - use beef broth in place of the water and Italian Seasoning in place of the Thyme) or just buy a packet of "slow cooker stew seasoning" at the market (although I prefer to use natural ingredients and spice things myself)...sorry, as is, this recipe is not what I'm looking for in a stew :(

I just made this last night and both my husband and I enjoyed it! I listened to others suggestions to sub Italian seasonings for the thyme and it was perfect! I might try adding just a little red wine next time to add a little flavor, but overall great and will make it again!

With some tweaks this is a very tasty stew! I used 1 cup beef broth (not water), Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, and added veggies (beans, corn, peas, etc...). I also spiced it up with thyme (as in the recipe), Italian seasoning, parsley, garlic, Montreal steak spice, and 2 tsp Worchestershire sauce. Hubby approved! :)

Love this stew. I make the stew a bit thicker by mixing flour with water then putting it in the stew.

It makes for a starter recipe. Agree with the others to add beef broth and other seasonings. Thyme alone and tomatoes just won't cut it. Will use it again but adding potato flakes sounds interesting to help thicken it up.

This will be my new go-to recipe for beef stew!  I added 2 cups beef broth as someone else suggested, italian seasoning instead of the thyme, and sprinkled in some paprika, garlic salt and black pepper.  The ratio of meat to veggies was perfect, and loved the tomato base flavor that the tomatoes and paste added.  Family loved it!

With the addition of another family to my home I was looking for something thrifty, easy and tasty.  This does the trick - set it up in the morning and forget it for 8 hrs. I made it per the recipie except that I added beef consume to it.  Love it and my grandchildren love it too.

Great recipe that always turns out well.  Instead of water, I put in a container of no salt added beef broth.  Gives just the right amount of liquid.

I made this with elk meat that I browned in flour before adding to crock pot. I used beef stew seasoning instead of thyme. It was really good-even hubbie who is a picky eater liked it. Next time I make it, though, I will omit or reduce amount of tomato paste. We thought it was a little too much tomato flavor.

the recipe said to cook on low i will cook on high the potatoes,carrots were hard but,the meat was good but, make sure you cook the meat first & add to the slow cooker so you dont get any of the blood in the pot !!
