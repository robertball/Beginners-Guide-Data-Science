I’m Honduran and I do this meal very often. It’s delicious however a little trick for keeping the corn tortillas from ripping is to microwave them for a few seconds so they’re easier to work with.

The flavor of these are good however I had a bit of trouble with the recipe. I prefer corn tortillas over flour but corn tortillas break so easily that it was impossible to put more than a pinch of filling in them to get them to roll without breaking. With that being said, the ratio is off. You get a whole lot of fried tortilla with one tiny bite of filling.  Even just sticking a toothpick through them made the corn tortilla tear. Even though it will alter the taste a great deal, I recommend using flour tortillas if you want a decent amount of filling in your tacos.
