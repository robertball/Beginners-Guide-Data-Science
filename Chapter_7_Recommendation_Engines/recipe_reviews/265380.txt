I made several different taco recipes for an event and this one was the hit of the party. That didn't surprise me though because this is how I typically make mine. It's our favorite. Don't let the bright orange of the sazon or the beer scare you. They work magic together!  You really can't go wrong with this recipe. These are the best tacos you will ever eat.

The arrachera was excellent for our tacos! Per the author's notes, I did add minced garlic and cilantro to the marinade. The only changes I made were: 1) used my own salt free sazon blend instead of store bought and ended up adding a little extra adobo, and 2) used gluten free beer (tested with Omission and Two Brothers) and had no issues with the recipe. This is our new go to recipe for skirt steak tacos and look forward to making it again!

I made it last night. The meat was exceptional tender. It made great tacos. Tonight I’m going to cut thin slices and but it on top of my salad.
