So good!  I used Jamaican Jerk seasoning and yellow summer squash.  A few red pepper flakes for heat and some brown sugar for sweetness.

We wanted to serve this as a main dish although, judging by the serving size, this would only make a small side dish. We used a whole onion, a whole green pepper, and half of an acorn squash and around a cup of dried white beans instead. With these adjustments, I would say this recipe makes around 4 servings, although they're still on the small side for a main dish.

excellent instead of the green pepper, onion, garlic, cilantro i used my home made sofrito (almost same thing).  i omited the bouillon and salt and added some diced ham and throw it into the sofrito when your simmering it in the beginning and a couple diced olives never hurt anything :)  but i dont use them all time.  great recipe!!

One of the best chilies ever. It had just the right amount of spices (and I do like spice!). Perfect for the fall weather. Serve with cornbread and pumpkin butter, or some coconut shrimp!

I found these a little too sweet with the squash.  It was a lot of work for a dish that tasted like sweet squash and little else.

For all the chopping and the amount of time, these were not worth it.  My 8 year old liked them more than the adults did.  On the plus side, it is pretty healthy.

I enjoyed this recipe.  However, I ommited that pumkin and cumin and substituted vegetable broth for the water and bullion.  I will make this again Maybe with the pumpkin next time.

This turned out real good!  My son couldn't get enough.  Very flavorful as the title says.  Good as a vegetarian dish.  I even ate it on top of salad.

I didn't have the pumpkin so made it without and it was really filling and tasty. Will definitely make this again ( I used butter beans/ kidney beans and borlotti). Served it with home made bread - lush.

I didn't have any sazon packet, so I used more cilantro, more garlic, and added paprika and more cumin to compensate.  I used butternut squash rather than calabaza.  It was sweet, but with the added cilantro (I used about 4 sprigs), and about 2 tsp of cumin and paprika each, it was a great combination of sweet and savory.  We ate it over white rice.  My kids loved it (always a plus), and I thought it was really yummy too.  Will definitely make again.  I'm always looking for recipes with strong flavor, but without heat, as my kids are more sensitive to heat.  This one was great.

With several changes, this recipe is a favorite.  I added 2 cups of butternut squash in place of the 1/4 cup of calabaza and I also used an entire bunch of cilantro instead of one sprig.  This was a hit at my families Christmas get-together.
