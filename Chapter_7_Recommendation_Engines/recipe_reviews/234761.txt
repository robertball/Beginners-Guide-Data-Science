Absolutely yummy! I used sugar free orange drink mix to cut the sugar a bit and it worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing zeebee!

I made this again recently and loved it! As the submitter of this recipe, I would like to note that I have also used Greek vanilla yogurt, and regular unstrained vanilla yogurt, too, just reducing the amount to 1 cup. I don't usually have actual half-n-half, and sub 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup 2% milk instead. So when it's hot outside just keep a can of sweetened condensed milk in the fridge, then everything is cold enough to whip this up on a whim, and it's great as soft-serve even before ripening in the freezer. I have not tried "sugar free" drink mix, I would expect that has an artificial sweetener? I have tried a few other (unsweetened) Kool-Aid flavors, black cherry is good, lemon is very tart, and we also liked strawberry, but orange is the best! :)

I used "Orange Crush" water enhancer (I couldn't find Kool-Aid) and the flavor was great! Tasted just like Orange Crush! Overall, the ice cream had a bit of a grainy texture but  it was good :-)

Made it as instructed.  Not much whey separated from the yogurt but it still turned out amazing.  Just like orange dreamsicle push-up pops from childhood.
