Oh, my, this is a delicious salad!  The dressing is just perfectly zingy for this interesting combination of ingredients.  I think I have found my next potluck dish, and I'm so happy!!!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just lovely--crunchy, sweet-tart, and good.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe to a "T" and it was a hit for two functions.  Received many kudos, requests for both the recipe and to take home leftovers!!  You and your guests will love it!

The dressing for this is really good. I didn't have grapes so I used blackberries and they were good, too. I plan on making it for the rest of my family.

This recipe definitely deserved 5 Stats. Made it for my Culinary Society and they all wanted the recipe.  I made the recipe as written.
