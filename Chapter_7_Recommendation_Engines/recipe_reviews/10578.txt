I suppose that this is what you might believe a 'sugar-free' cookies tasts like
but these are not sweet at all leaving 
it when more of a 'biscuit' taste. If you are looking
for a delicious sugar-free cookies recipe
I would recommend the Chocolate Chip Cookie
one that is also available on this site.

If there were a negative "1" star that is what I would give this recipe.  It is awful.  I just got through making 12 of the most tastless, poor consistancy cookie rocks ever.  There simple is not enough liquid for the amount of dry ingredients called for. 2 table spoons of water hmmp.  My poor mailman would boycott my house if I were to have given him these cookies. A word to the wise "PASS THIS ONE UP"

use a bit more water in the mix... Also when right out of oven dip into water than into splenda (or substitute) and will put glaze over. Also added walnuts and nutmeg into mix. more like a muffin,,, didnt shape as cookie more like a cake.
