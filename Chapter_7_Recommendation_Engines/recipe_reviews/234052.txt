I added some minced onion and garlic to the butter while I melted it and it was amazing. Had to use milk as hubby can't handle the cream and it still was rich in flavor. Also, I sprinkled some dried parsley flakes over the top at the end to give it some color. We ate it all! Thank you!

I used to work in a restaurant that made this, using almost the same recipe. They used flour as a thickener, but the corn starch in this recipe works better. Delicious!
