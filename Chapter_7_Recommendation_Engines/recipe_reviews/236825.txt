Mmmmm! I used what I had, but followed directions for timing.  Used green zucchini, red onion, yellow bell pepper, and fresh cherry tomatoes (didn't have eggplant).  Subbed greek vinaigrette and followed that theme by adding feta.  Feta won't melt, but it was SOOOOO sweet and savory!  YUMMM!

My wife and kids didn't like this at all.  This would have been better without the cream cheese.

I personally don't eat this kind of thing. But, I really enjoyed making it. I followed the directions almost to a tee, I added a couple mins of cooking time here and there. My husband loved it! His parents loved it as well! They all sat down with some crackers and ate it all. I recommend this to all the fresh produce lovers out there!
