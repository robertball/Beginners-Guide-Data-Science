This is a wonderful cake.  I made it for my dad's birthday and everyone loved it.  I frosted it with a caramel frosting (butter, brown sugar, conf. sugar)- the one listed didn't look very interesting to me.  It was a perfect combination.

This turned out great. I'm a wedding cake designer and I will use this recipe again and again. If overbaked the cake can be a lil dry otherwise I really recomend the cake. Thankyou for sharing this one.

I Looove this cake.  I make it a lot...I am a cake decorator and once someone samples this cake..it becomes their go to cake for anything!!

The only changes I suggest..for a lighter, more airy texture is to use self-rising flour and omit the backing powder...or use cake flour...i believe 1 cup AP flour = 1 cup + 1 TB of cake flour.

Anyways...great cake!!  I looove it with a caramel filling and butter frosting or caramel icing too...yummm~!

I made this cake for my parents birthdays, which are a week apart, because they both love butter pecan ice cream. It was a beautiful cake and it got lots of oh's and ah's at the party. Everyone said it was delicious. I, on the other hand, thought it was a little dry even though I only baked it for 20 minutes but the flavor was very good. Also I thought the frosting was way to sweet. I wish I listened to my gut and used my regular butter cream frosting which I think would have paired better with the cake. Next time I will and I'll add buttermilk to the cake to combat the dryness.

I tried this cake and it was absolutely fantastic. The cake has the flavor of my favorite ice cream, Buttered pecan. I got rave reviews from my family when I made this cake for my mom's birthday.

I am only rating the cake, as I used a different icing. I substituted vanilla soymilk for regular milk (since I was out), and added half the amount of vanilla extract. The cake layers were fluffy and light, and perfectly moist. Very nicely sweetened, maybe a little too sweet, and only because I used flavored soymilk. My mom raved, and everyone else loved it. So good.

This cake was splendid! With a few exceptions. I would suggest adding twice the butter because the cake came out a bit dry. I didn't make the traditional frosting but made one of my own (brown sugar, confectioners sugar, heavy cream, butter, and the remainder of the buttered pecans) It turned out magnificently, a rather sweet glaze. But it works much better when made as a bundt cake. Overall, the smell and taste of the buttered pecans was heavenly! Will be making this again!

To all the folks who thought the cake was on the dry side, how are you measuring your flour ? Do not dip your cup into the flour....always spoon lightly into the cup, then level the top. Too much flour can make a big difference, even several tablespoons. I adjusted this recipe slightly ....added 1/4 cup vegetable oil, added 1/2 t. baking soda and reduced baking powder to 11/2 teaspoons...and added 1/3 cup sour cream as part of the milk measurement.  The resulting cake was so moist, so light, so wonderful.  I also salted the pecans which I saut√©ed in a skillet with the butter. My guests love the salty sweet flavor profile. Huge huge hit at the restaurant where I work.

Lovely cake! I reduced the recipe to "ten servings" (to make it just two layers instead of three). Also, I used half walnuts and that was just fine. It was elegant yet simple and impressed my friends!

This was the best cake ever. When we made this for our teacher, she said it was the cake around since she has been down here. The rest of the fifth grade teachers said it was also good too.

This cake was great - easy to make, not too sweet and the exact right balance of moisture.  I can't comment on the icing because I made it for a class and had to use the Wilton icing, but I'll definitely make the cake again and again.

My friend loves butter pecan or praline everything, so I decided to make this for her. It turned out great, especially the batter! Straight out of the oven it smelled like IHOP pecan pancakes, and it had a texture like fluffy banana nut bread. I thought the icing was a nice complement to the cake, and altogether it's so sweet and rich I can only eat a piece or two a day, instead of marathon cake binges-- which is a good thing. :) Definitely will be making this again.

If cake is dry what I love to do when baking is fill a small pan with boiling water and place on top rack while the cake is on lower rack cooking..helps to keep the cake moist

Giving it 4 stars because it was a little dense with the AP Flour.  But when I tried it again with Cake Flour, it was perfect.  I layered it with a Maple Cream Cheese Frosting and it was wonderful :)

OMG, OMG, I just baked this cake and levelled off the tops. I sampled the pieces and I'm sold on this one-it is soooooo tasty, just like the ice cream...  I also am a cake decorator and will definitely use this as a go-to cake. One of my customers specifically asked me for a butter pecan cake for her father-in-law's birthday. I searched on here and found this recipe but had to double the recipe to accomodate the people, that was the only thing I changed and I used 2-12 inch round cake pans and baked them for 45 minutes. I am going to use the frosting recipe for the filling as I have made the cakes into 4 layers. Turned out a pretty golden brown and is super moist. Will use a butter cream frosting to decorate with as it will be a western themed cake.

The flavor was excellent but like others, i found it dry. It needed vanilla ice cream or a big glass of milk. My family liked that it was a change from chocolate cake.

This cake is tasty, but unfortunately it came out dry for me as well.  The only thing I did differently was, I used 3 cups + 6 tbls of sifted cake flour (hoping that would nix the dryness reported by others.  By the way, I spooned the cake flour into the measuring cup as recommended by a reviewer). I'm not knowledgeable  enough to know enough to know exactly how to "correct" this.  Also, I suggest at least 50% more frosting if making 3 layers.  I spread it on thin,  yet still had half of the perimeter to cover. I  ended up making 25% more frosting & just was able to cover cake thinly.  I will make it again, however, because it would be incredible if moist!

OK, I just made this cake today.  It tastes like 
flour-y pancakes and WAY too sweet.  I only put 1 1/2 cups of sugar thinking that would be less sweet.  I am a cake baker and decorator and this was VERY DISAPPOINTING!!  I wish I could give it NO STARS.

The flavor of this was good, although a bit dry. I topped it with a carmel frosting from a different site and it was amazing with this cake.

This cake was good, but I used wheat flour and it made it more dense and dry.  It wasn't as popular as the pies.  I would use regular flour next time and would make sure to buy a sifter to sift the flour first.

I used a cream cheese frosting instead, which I thought gave a nice counterbalance to the sweetness of the cake -- recipe came out great!

It looks wonderful. I have a question, the accompanying photo shows the cake as baked in a bundt pan rather than 3 9" pans. I would like to try that but don't know what the baking time would be.  Anyone have ideas?

To avoid dryness in the finished product, 
Use heavy whing cream instead of regular milk.

This cake has truly excellent flavor and is fairly simple. But mine come out dry. I measured properly, did not over mix, baked for 22 minutes, and even added a 1/4 cup oil. Still dry. The icing is very sweet and was not quite enough to frost a 3 layer cake - I made 1 1/2 batches and that was perfect. I might bake this again but with adjustments.

I used cake flour.  i added sour cream as part of the milk, I used real butter,  reduced baking powder,  added baking soda,  cooked about 25 min.  

It tasted so dry.

I followed the cake part recipie and instructions down to the letter and it was good but not great. The cake was a little dry and stiff. Next time I will cook it a little less time. Also, it was a bit too nutty for me. So I will either use less nuts on the cake or none on the icing.  I did not follow the icing recipe but instead found one that was just a plain buttercream.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this cake was very dry and had no taste.  I re-read the directions, and couldn't figure out what I did wrong.  I won't be making this again.  Sorry

I made this in a bundt pan it came out beautiful.  I entered this in my county  fair and it won 1st place!  I now have to make another because I didn't even get to taste the first one I made.  When I made it for the fair, that was the first time I had made it.

My family LOVED this cake, even though I over baked it. It was a tad dry but that was my fault. Even so, I was asked for the recipe by 2 people. Next time I will not overbake it it. I added a splash of vanilla extract to the frosting, Yum!

This cake and frosting was incredible! The flavor was great. I should have used a little oil in the batter to make it a little more moist, and I needed to crumble the pecans more. But everyone was going back for seconds.
