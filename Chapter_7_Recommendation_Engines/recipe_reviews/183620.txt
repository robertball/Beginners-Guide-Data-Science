I love the spices and the use of the dry white wine! (added some salt to taste). I used veggies I had on hand: sweet potato, red potato, carrots, onion, brussels sprouts. Everything was cooked perfectly. The onion was delicious! My husband isn't usually too excited about veggies I cook,but he LOVED these and couldn't stop complimenting!

Too good. Delicious! Only changed the white wine to 1 part white wine vinegar and 3 parts water. This is really really good, beet haters will also eat it with pleasure like my husband;-)

I make a similar dish adding sweet potatoes along with the regular. Also, I have tried balsamic vinegar which adds a little sweetness if you like that. Absolutely scrumptious!!

OMG!  How did you come up with this recipe?!  It is absolutely scrumptious!!  With these ingredients being harvested right now locally (I live in Tucson, AZ), I was able to use all organically grown fresh vegetables and it was simply divine.  Thank you so much for sharing this!

Wow!  I know it's just a bunch of root vegetables, but this was really good.  I am not a big fan of beets but the veggies just go so sweet, even the beets weren't well, "beety"... I made a huge batch and served it at Christmas diner and people loved it.  The color was beautiful!  The only change I made was to omit the chick peas and add parsnips. Thanks for this great recipe!

Fantastic!  Forgot the beans, but added celeriac (cubed), sunchokes & parsnips to the beets, onions, potatoes & carrots.  The wine, added at the end, mingles with the carmelized veggie flavors & adds a delicious punch.  If you didn't taste the wine, you didn't add enough.   I baked 15-20 min, added wine, stirred/turned, which caused the wine to sizzle & boil down almost immediately.   Back for 5-10 min & done.  Gorgeous.  My husband & sons, who don't love beets, loved this.

Just got back from the potluck that I brought this dish to. It was a HIT.  I was late, so the dish was actually served cold.  It was still wonderful.  I roasted the beets seperately and added them at the last minute, so all the vegetables still had thier own color.  

I used beets, rutabega, turnip, carrot, sweet potato, russet potato, greens (kale), red onion, chick peas (made my own, not canned).  I used the olive oil and italian seasoning (with thyme) and dry white wine (Kendal Jackson Chardonay to be excact).  It was wonderful. 
 
These vegetables are full of flavor; roasting enhances the flavor.

I followed the suggestion and added about a T. of balsamic vinegar and sweet potatoes. It was wonderful. I will also use this as a recipe for just beets.

Taking the advice of others, I also added a splash of good balsamic vinegar to the recipe. The recent heat had made my beet greens bitter, so I just harvested the beet and instead of greens, added some freshly picked peas during the last 5 minutes. Very tasty but would only work really well with very fresh peas. I added a small early red onion from the garden with a small Juane onion instead of just one big yellow onion. I would never have thought of this recipe for myself and it is a keeper. The chiogga beets give it a very pleasing visual appearance and mellow sweetness. Definitely will change your mind on what you think of beets!

This was my first experience cooking with beets, and I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  The colors are beautiful with the red beets and the wilted greens so this dish has lots of eye appeal plus the recipe is full of healthy ingredients.  I used the full amount of thyme and also added a large sprig of rosemary and a little garlic powder.

I took the advice of many other reviewers.  I did half sweet potato and half red potatoes.  I also did half wine and half balsamic vinegar and added 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning along with the 1 tablespoon of thyme.  I also added an extra clove of garlic.  In the end, it was very good, but I think next time, I will add some garlic salt, which I added to it when it was on my plate and was very good. And maybe even add more types of veggies, like green pepper and sugarsnap peas.  Would make a great Thanksgiving side!

YUM! I added some balsamic vinegar, as another reviewer suggested. Totally delicious. I might add cranberries and mushrooms, and maybe a red pepper next time, but I'll definitely make this again.

This is AMAZING! I only made very slight changes; I used onion powder (my kids won't eat onions) and doubled the amount of garbanzo beans. I also used kale in place of the torn beet greens. Fantastic! Thank you so much for this phenomenal recipe!

Very simple to make, and I love how it makes use of those pesky beet greens! I bought these beets without the greens because I was tired of throwing them away, but next time I'll keep them on just for this dish! The addition of chickpeas is great, I would even add more if you're a fan. I didn't have wine, so I just used water with a small splash of apple cider vinegar. Different herbs would also be great for this, like sage or rosemary.

For me this recipe was just OK. Next time I will omit the garlic for sure. I am a garlic lover but not a raw garlic lover and I find it doesn't cook enough. I might try this again with a few adjustments.

Good mix of veggies, but could use just a tad more seasoning. I'll make again and try using some italian seasoning. I also think sweet potatoes and parsips would be a good addition.

Love it! What an amazing array of flavor going on in this dish, though I love all these veggies. It's so simple and can be very versatile. I added sweet potato and extra garlic and kale toward the end...and some balsamic vinegar. This one is a keeper!

Served these Christmas day to people who don't eat foods that look like this.  They all sampled and loved it!  I used sweet potatoes instead of white.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was very good and my 20-month old son liked it, too.  I used a red onion and added a shallot and some spinach.  I'll definitely make it again!

I omitted the white potatoes, because it was for Thanksgiving dinner and there were already two kinds of potatoes on the menu, and substituted parsnips and sweet potatoes.  Also, I omitted the garbanzo beans, but only because m husband doesn't like them.  I imagine they would be an interesting addition.  This was a huge success at our family gathering.  I especially liked the colorful addition of the beet greens.  I considered adding some purple top turnips to the mix, but was afraid the strong flavor might not appeal to some at a large gathering.  I did cook some separately, though, and added them to the leftovers.  It was a delicious addition.

Excellent!  Couldn't believe that even my picky 6 year old said, "Mom, you can make this again!"  He liked everything but the greens.  I made recipe as stated, except for adding a little more potato and omitting the chickpeas.  Thank you for a great way to roast root vegetables!

LOVE this.  It could be easily modified for other ingredients. Not being a beet fan, I wasn't sure about it but the wine, garlic, onions and spices added a lot and balanced the dish.  I'll be making this often.

Very tasty.  Tried it as a main dish, and I don't think I would do that again, but it would work very well as a side dish.

simple, delicious, absolutely worth while. i added a little seasoned salt (just a dash) and some italian herbs because I didn't have just plain thyme. I threw a splash of balsamic vinegar on it at the end too, just for a little extra something. it was perfect!

This dish was beyond delicious, I can't wait to make it again.  It is particularly good for people who are members of CSAs or do frequent farmer's market shopping, as it combines a host of common, locally-grown vegetables.  The potatoes and chickpeas make it hardy so that it can be served as a meal, not just a side.  Try it!

Yummy - we loved this!  I left out the beet greens because mine were a little on the limp side - and I added about 1 tsp of dried rosemary in place of the thyme (thyme isn't a fave in our house). I didn't find the wine added very much flavor and the chick peas added a great flavor and texture.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

We love the mixture of vegetables. BUT we also found the vegetables not to be soft enough, so I will definitely improve the cooking process. Will cook them covered  first with foil for 20 - 25 min and then uncover and cook them for approx. 30 min more.

I was skeptical of this recipe but this will definitely be served again and again.  Like most others I did no follow the recipe to the letter, but the outcome was delicious.  Everyone raved about the piquant flavor that the white wine adds to the primarily sweet roots.  In my preparation I roasted for a longer time as I prefer a little more browning to concentrate those sugars on the perimeter of the vegetable.  This contrast was outstanding!  I was preparing a large quantity and I included parsnips and sweet potatoes. Garbanzos being precooked did not require the same cooking time so I decided to omit, however, if I were preparing this for a vegetarian or vegan I would have added them as a protein.  I added all the vegetables  into a large plastic container and poured olive oil  over them added the other ingredients, closed the container and shook till all were covered.   The beautifully colored array made a wonderful  presentation.

Amazing! Something I recommend though is not dicing the potatoes, but cutting them in sixths. This dish should not be served as a main dish, but as a side. This is going to be cooked every Friday from now on.

This recipe was a hit with my (steak and potatoes kind of) husband, Dad, 1-year old, 3-year old, 16-year old. We didn't have wine on hand so I used vermouth. For the veggies, I used parsnips, carrots, onions, turnips, beets and garlic.  I also made a regular similar dish that doesn't use the beets just in case I had some fussy ones about the beets.  Turns out I didn't need to. I think the kids were attracted to the bright color and then realized they liked it.  I did forget to use the salt and pepper in the end.  I will definitely try again.  I will also try a little higher temp next time too to get the veggies to brown and crisp a little.

This is a real winner!  The fact it's so versatile makes it even more appealing.  I cooked mine covered for almost an hour at 400 degrees, added the greens and cooked uncovered for about 15 more minutes.  Served it over steamed jasmine rice with a side of Thai cucumbers.  Perfect for Meatless Monday's, vegans or vegetarians.  Liked the addition of balsamic vinegar too!  Pink veggies are pretty unusual don't ya' know!!

This is a great way to make anyone love veggies, but I ran into problems with my batches both times I made it.  My veggies are never tender enough, and the flavor can get a bit monotonous after a big helping of it.  I'll definitely keep experimenting with it though, because I'm not a huge veggie lover, and I can eat quite a bit of this stuff.

I really liked this recipe, however, I felt like there was something missing.  Couldn't put my finger on it though. Maybe I will add balsamic vinegar as suggested.

I added a delicata squash that I had on hand in addition to the other recipe ingredients.  I didn't have wine so I mixed some apple cider vinegar, red wine vinegar and a touch of balsamic vinegar and a bit of cranberry juice.  It was a bit tart and pretty sweet because of the vinegars but very very yummy.  I can't wait to try it with wine - I think that would add a nice balance.  I ate it over barley with a bit of feta sprinkled in. So good and beautiful too.

Delicious.  Versital recipe change based on what ingredients you have in the house:  use red/green/white onions, sweet potatoes/yams, red/white potatoes, brussel sprouts/cauliflower, red or green cabbage, rutabaga/parsnips/turnips. red/yellow/green peppers. No beet greens?  I used chopped fresh spinach leaves. 

Use 1/8 cup balsamic AND 1/4 cup white wine mixture.  

 Perfect!!  I paired this meal with Rachael Rae's Braised Chicken Sausages.  It is a perfect pairing.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was so super great.  I used purple and orange beets that didn't have stems attached, added sweet potatoes and about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. I didn't have any white wine so I substituted it with chicken broth and a bit of lemon juice.  Good stuff!

Wow, the ingredients and seasonings are simple yet the flavor is fantastic! I used carrots, parsnips, shallots, beets and sweet potatoes. The flavor was lovely and I really liked using the beet greens in the end. I found this recipe just as the leaves are starting to turn...a perfect fall dish!

This was fantastic! Like other reviewers I adding a splash of balsamic vinegar. I also added a tablespoon of pepper flakes. I didn't have beet greens, so I topped it with a little bit of chapped fresh parsley. Served over a combination of white rice and quinoa this was a satisfying meal.

I did the beets with carrots in my West Bend slow cooker to avoid heating the oven on a hot summer day and it turned out great!  I also used my food chopper to do the onions and all the stems from the greens and sauteed them all with the garlic and some fresh ginger in coconut oil.  Definitely a keeper and I will plant more beets this week.  Even my hubby who doesn't like beets ate it with some balsamic vinegar and thought it "interesting" and would eat again as a side dish.

Excellent! I love the flavor of the wine with balsamic! A very wonderful way to eat your root vegetables. I had everything but the carrots on-hand from my CSA, and it was a great dish (and leftover) to make.

Very easy -- most time-consuming was preparing the veggies (I scrub, wash, and sanitize mine). I used carrot greens instead of beet, because the carrots I bought today had tops, and the beet didn't (they were sold out). Still tastes great -- a healthy dish that I can heat up as leftovers for my next two very busy days!

Delicious! I did omit the chickpeas and beet greens (mine were the bagged kind sold without the greens). I used the vegetables the recipe called for, but in different amounts. The dish was nicely seasoned. I've never had roasted beets before, just the pickled sort and they are way better than I imagined! My vegetables didn't turn too pink, just a light tinge. A keeper for sure!

Liked the combination of vegetables.  I used fresh thyme since that's what I had, but obviously didn't use enough as it really needed more seasoning.

This is a very good recipe, but I'm afraid it wasn't enough to convert my beet-hating husband.  Be sure to follow the recipe amounts very closely.  I made the mistake of adding too much diced beet into the dish, and it overwhelmed the potatoes and carrots a little.  However, if you already like beets (like my son and I) then you will really enjoy this dish.  I grated fresh mozzarella cheese and sprinkled it on top right before serving.  Very yummy!  I'll be sure to make it again - if my hubbie is out for the night.

Wonderful recipe!! The wine added so much flavor to the veggies. I used a Chardonnay and added potatoes, brussel sprouts and kale. I also used yellow beets to keep the vegetables from turning red from the red beets. Very easy to make. I also used an outdoor charcoal grill to roast them instead of the oven. Took a little longer but the vegetables were wonderful. Family favorite.

This was good and it easy to fix.  Only changes I made were tossing the veggies with olive oil in a bowl first, used a cookie sheet, chicken broth instead of wine and added a parsnip.   Will make again but cut it in half for just the two of us.

Made this for family and friends. My father in law who does not eat veggies had two servings and asked to take some home.  Most every thing came straight from my garden. I substituted swiss  chard for beet greens, I used blue and white potatoes,  and I substituted fresh oregano for thyme.  I topped it with cherry tomatoes during the last baking cycle. Perfect!!  Not only was this dish beautiful but was undeniably  delicious. I will make this again very soon.

Very good and easy to prepare.  Was looking for a recipe using both beets and the greens.  Omitted the beans and served with cut up bratwurst for my guys.  I baked it an extra 15  minutes after adding the greens.

Tasty. More of a technique for roasting, to me, than an actual recipe. I used potatoes, onions, beets, carrots,  cauliflower, and zucchini...adding the cauliflower and zucchini after the potatoes and carrots started to soften. Not visually appealing, to me: half-red potatoes and cauliflower.  I think in the future I will only roast beets with other dark veggies like carrots, sweet potatoes, or butternut or acorn squash. I also lowered the temp to 375* so the veggies wud cook thru ...but that was a bit low. Will try 400* next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good!  I've never made anything like this before!  I added balsamic vinegar, per suggestions from some of the reviewers, and we didn't love that so next time I'll leave it out.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hubby and I thought this was pretty good. I normally don't like to rate things if I didn't follow the recipe to the T, but hubby can't have potatoes right now. So I used carrots, parsnips, Brussel sprouts, onions, beans and a beet. It did take a while for this to cook, but it smelled wonderful the whole time it baked. This is our first go at eating parsnips and beets and were pleasantly surprised that we liked them so well. Definitely recommend this recipe and will be making it again, but possibly trying other veggies. Thanks for sharing.

I followed the instructions. I thought the taste was a bit bland. To get the beet greens to wilt I had to put the dish back in the oven. However, as a long time beet hater I discovered I do like them roasted. I would try this again with some adjustments to the spices & will give the addition of a splash of balsamic vinegar a try.

Delicious! I chose to use white grape juice instead of white wine, and I kept the dish baking (after I poured the white grape juice in) in the oven for 30 minutes versus 15 minutes.

I did a trial run on this dish prior to Christmas, because I want it to be part of our Christmas dinner. For my trial run I used only the root vegetables I had on hand, Brussel sprouts, a sweet potato and onions. It was delicious. I followed your recipe, except I added the garlic to the veggies in the beginning. I look forward to making this dish with the addition of beets and carrots! Thanks for a tasty recipe.

Made this recipe (with some modifications) for the first time for an office party and it was a hit!  I omitted the garbanzo beans and added in more beets, carrots, and potatoes (using half sweet potatoes and half Yukon gold). I cut the beets, carrots and sweet potatoes into 1/2" to 1" cubes and the gold potatoes 2".  Used less onion and garlic and added 1 T of balsamic vinegar to the dry cooking white wine (I didn't have regular wine).  I took another reviewer's advice and baked it covered in foil for the first 30 minutes, then stirred in the wine mixture and 1 T of rosemary and baked uncovered for the remaining 20-25 minutes.  I also used raw kale instead of the beet greens, mixing those right when removed from the oven so they could wilt into the mixture.  It was perfect!  I'll be making this one again!

I used what I had on hand, and what I found in the store (potatoes, carrots, turnips and parsnips).  I used a light sprinkling of garlic powder instead of garlic cloves.  Next time I'll leave the parsnips out.  They have too much fiber and didn't roast well even after an hour in the oven.  Loved the thyme and the white wine.  My company said it was very good.

We did like this although we did make it slightly different. We are not thyme fans so we used a vegetable mixed seasoning.  I left the 4 cloves in the skins and roasted them then mashed them and mixed them in just before serving. We left out Garbanzos and potatoes. Put in a lot more beets and carrots. My beet greens were too far gone so did not do that. We may have cooked slightly longer but you say 15m or till tender so that is no big deal. this is a good base and liked the addition of the wine. We have made roasted veggies many times and not seen that. And I had the epiphany this time to roast the garlic and that was much more palatable than minced or shaved garlic or even whole without the skin left on in the roasting process.

I make a variation of this all the time. I am vegetarian so this is a perfect meal by itself or to accompany a slice of bread or anything else on hand. I live in a house trailer so winter is the best time to use the oven and enjoy the two-fold pleasure of baked supper and warm place to sleep. Leftovers are a snap. use the foil and just wrap it up and store in fridge. Next day ready to travel with lunch to go - good cold, too. I like to add a dash of black pepper when it is cold.

This was an amazing side dish! The wife actually found the recipe to make something different for Thanksgiving, and I was amazed at how great it turned out. Told her it was definitely our new holiday tradition! The vegetables turned out cooked, but still crisp which is how I love them. I was skeptical trading my mashed potatoes for this, but there's no going back for me. And I make some  good mashed potatoes.

Loved it and so did my family of very picky eaters!!!  I made it with what I had on hand, beets, red potatoes, sweet potatoes carrots, garlic and onions.  I did not have a can of garbanzo beans.  Was a little skeptical of using the beat greens, but they were incredible and added a lot of flavor, one of our favorite parts of the dish.  Thank you for sharing.   Will make again and again.  I paired with the crispy baked chicken thighs and it was perfect.

Outstanding recipe. Of course I did not have all the ingredients so used tarragon instead of tyme and blush wine since my supply of dry white was depleated. I had a random assortment of root vegetables but they worked out great; beets, turnips, rutabaga, purple carrots and small potatos.

A delicious combination of vegetables and spices, but I omitted the garbanzo beans and instead included chopped parsnips, yams and fresh cilantro and basil.  Any vegetables you enjoy would probably work well with this method.

I thought it was great and plan to make it for Thanksgiving.  The only thing I'm going to change next time around is instead of regular potatoes, I'm going to use sweet potatoes since we're also having mashed for dinner.   Enjoy!

This was very good.  You can use whatever vegies you have on hand.  I made ours with beets, potatoes, turnips, and onion.  I used garlic salt rather than raw garlic.  Next time I will try it with raw garlic.  I think the beets are a must in this recipe.  This recipe gives these vegies an extra oomph!

I had to take everything but the beets out and let them cook till they were done 'cause they were still crunchy by the time everything else was finished.  Things got a little burnt and I thought it was ruined, and it tasted kinda ruined, but I froze it for the week, and somehow magically it was like amazing once reheated!  So I love it,  'cause what I need are things I can freeze.  lol

This was amazing!  I didn't have any white wine or olive oil so I used 3 parts water to one part balsamic vinegar and avocado oil. I also used the entire can of garbanzo beans instead of the 1/4 cup.  Ate it with some vegan sour cream and am super satisfied. It was a hit with everyone and will definitely become one of our staple meals.  Thank you so much!

Great base recipe. I threw in celery, zucchini, a leek and 3 tomatoes that needed to be used up, in addition to baby white potatoes, carrots, onions, garlic and of course beets. Used balsamic as well as white wine. Easy, delicious, loved by the whole family.

Fabulous and easy to adjust the vegetables to your liking. I add 2 turnips, use 2 1/2 cups of fresh spinich and add more garbanzos. Make with or without the wine as either way is great.

This was delicious. I prepared it exactly as the directions say, except I omitted dry white wine because I didn't have any. It was still fantastic. Next time I might add more garlic because we are garlic-fiends. This is the first time we have ever had beets. That being said, beware of beeturia. Look it up, or else you may be unpleasantly surprised the next day !

Excellent, and easy to modify. I doubled the beans, added more carrot and garlic. Will do white beans next. Cheers!

I forgot the garlic and it would have been better if I had remembered it but I found the flavor to be very one dimensional - thyme. It was just OK and I won't be making it again.

Loved it. I made it with no beets and added celery and a rutabaga. I had no white wine so made it with sherry cooking wine. Delicious and easy. Just chop and mix!

Good quick solution for beets. Also can be modified depending on the root veggies you have around. I prefer it without the beans.

I made these changes... I used 1 sweet potato, 1 regular white potato, skin on, I added 3/4 tablespoon of Italian spice as well. Instead of wine, I used white wine vinegar, red wine vinegar, a splash of balsamic vinegar and cranberry cocktail to a total measurement of about 2/3rds cup. I covered the dish for first 30 minutes with tin foil then removed and kept in the over for between 30-35 minutes... result?? I loved it! I had never liked beets either.. this changed me for sure. I definitely would keep beet pieces smaller than the rest of the veggies. Also, I think I might cook the chickpeas a little before adding to the mix. I love chickpeas but these were a little too firm for me. Overall? a big win in my books! Thanks!

Great way to make 1-pan pile of veggies that can be used for a good sized gathering and/or refrigerated for later use. I didn't follow to a T, but used all the ingredients as listed.

I made this recipe as a side dish during Christmas dinner. It turned out delicious and everyone asked for the recipe. The only changes I made after reading other reviews was adding in balsamic vinegar, and I substituted regular potatoes for sweet potatoes. This will definitely be a keeper!

Great recipe! Family loved it. I did add sweet potatoes to the mix of veggies and excluded onion as I am allergic.  Also added a sprinkle of brown sugar at the end.  I’ll definitly make it this way again in the future!

This was good but nothing amazing. I used sweet potato and parsnip along with turnip, beet and brussel sprouts. I should have followed my gut and added the quicker cooking ones after starting the others but I just didn't have the time. So, some were more done than others. I don't blame this on the recipe, that's my doing. But, I did find that the flavours all sort of seeped into one and other so that it kind of all tasted the same. I did add some balsamic which I highly recommend. Oh, and I did leave out the garlic,  not that I don't like it but it didn't seem appropriate for Thanksgiving dinner.

This was very good. Added a green pepper and a few mushrooms. After stirring at the end all the veggies were pinkish from the beets so I think next time I will leave it out.

We loved this recipe. I didn't use the potatoes or garbanzo beans. Added Peruvian turnips. This will be a regular at our home.

After reading through the reviews, I was excited to make it.  I didn't add chickpeas cause it's not well liked in our house.  Otherwise I followed the directions pretty closely.  We were disappointed because it was flavorless.  It required 1 hr+15 min of cooking because the veggies were still firm.  Won't make it again.
