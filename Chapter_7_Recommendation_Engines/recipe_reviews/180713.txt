This is great I haden't ever thought to do a turnover with pumpkin. My husband thought it was good but asked me to make some frosting for the rest and then he thought they were great. I agree with him juts a little powdered sugar forsting drizzled on was very good thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! My father and I made them yesterday to test them out for a possible Thanksgiving dessert. We gave some to our neighbors, some to my boyfriend's family, and kept some for ourselves. They were a hit with everyone! We did, however, use fresh pie pumpkin rather than canned pumpkin. And, as a little touch, we wet the tops of the turnovers and dipped them in some white sugar. They came out very little and cute. This recipe will definitely be made again.

These are very tasty and not difficult to make. There are some points that need clarified, however. Make sure you flour the work surface before rolling out the pastry. This will keep it from sticking. Start with a Tablespoon of filling in the center of each square. Some filling is likely to escaqpe during baking, but that's par for the course with turnovers. These are delicious "as is", but I decided to top mine with a spiced maple glaze drizzle.

The filing had a little too much cinnamon in it, and it felt like it was undercooked a bit and was missing something in texture.  I can't say they weren't good though, because my family devoured them.  :)  I sprinkled them with regular sugar before baking.  As a side note, don't use phyllo dough.  I tried some with it and it was good but just didn't have the same pizzaz as the pastry dough.  :)

Yum!  These were delicious!  I made them as the recipe said (except for using canned pumpkin) and they were perfectly spiced, perfect consistency...I can't wait to take some for a get together or something.  I used the Pepperidge Farms Puff Pastry, which made it easy to cut into nine squares and required no flour on the parchment paper--just thaw out, cut out, spoonful of the pumpkin mixture, and you're good.  None of my pumpkin mixture came out of the edges...but I used my fingernail to pinch them down good and I didn't overstuff them...for me, less than a Tablespoon worked better.  For the reviewer that wanted more details, the puff pastry in the grocery store actually says "Puff Pastry" on the packages, so I'm not sure where the confusion came in regarding Fillo Dough.  Also, the recipe just calls for 1 cup of pumpkin, so probably any of the can sizes at the store would work, as would using fresh pumpkin, which is what I used.  You just need one cup, not a whole can.  :)  Hope this helps.  Thank you for posting this scrumptious recipe--you helped me broaden my horizons as I've never used puff pastry before.  I sure will now!

Um...how do you get 9 out of a sheet? That's an odd number. Am I just dumb? (valid question).  I used Pepperidge Farms and could either get 4 or 16, so I chose 4. They turned out full size and with a few extra cooking minutes-just really nice. 
I also read the reviews and used an orange juice concentrate glaze on them.  I made apple pie filling ones with cinnamon glaze. It's important if you use a glaze though to not make it frosting thick because the pastry itself cools really fast and won't so much melt the glaze the way a sweet roll would. If your glaze is too thick, it will depress the top of the pastry. A slightly runny glaze works best. 
I think it would be really fun to try these with Lime Curd with some sort of pommegranate glaze for Christmas.

Easy, but very bland.  I didn't like the texture of the filling, and the dough overwhelmed it.  Maybe more sugar and spice would help.  Also, when I tried to reheat in the toaster oven the next day, they just got soggy and lost any buttery-cripness. Not good for leftovers.

My father in law really enjoyed these, I had to make 3 batches just to take to my in laws for the holidays! I also blended some blueberry preserves with cream cheese and a little dash of whipping cream for an alternate filling, both were a big hit!

Great tasting, easy recipe. I used a dollop of cream cheese in some and those were great as well. I only used cinnamon, no pumpkin spice, and added a splash of vanilla and a bit more pumpkin as it tasted like too much cinnamon. They were a hit!

The recipies for begginers should have been more DELTAILED. The pasty should have a brand name example I bought the wrong dough! (Fillo dough) The "CAN" of pumpkin? What size? In MY grocery stores I have 3 sizes of cans for pumkin filling. The family said it what still good but WAY too rich.I had to figure out how to use the fillo dough so I just layered it. I just try something different next year for Thanksgiving.

This is excellent. I made it using the ingredients as given. I did drizzle an icing made of confectioners sugar and water over the top. My husband could not believe how good these were. The only down side is puff pastry is kind of pricey and these things go fast! They are very, very good.

I thought these needed a little more sugar & spice. I did used fresh pureed pumpkin so that could have accounted for the blandness. Great easy idea!

I did this as the recipe stated, except doubled. It had a weird taste :( I cooked the pumpkin & spices, it gets rid of the weird texture and taste for the canned stuff. I added creamcheese and some more pumpkin. It helped a lot! I did an egg bath and sprinkled with raw coarse sugar on top before baking. Came out good with my changes, I'd give mine a 4 but as was i'll stick with 3 for this recipe

I took this recipe and added a twist. I made some pecans that I place on my sweet potato casserole. You take pecans add butter,brown sugar and some flour, let it bake for a couple a mins. Take out let set, it will become crumbly. Take this and crumble on top! yum it gives it needed texture. Great recipe! Easy too!

These are pretty good.  Better warm than room temperature.  I think the spices need to be turned up.  If I make it again, I might at ginger or orange zest.

I used puff pastry from Trader Joes, which came packaged as 2 9x9-inch sheets.  I rolled it out to 12x12, but cut it into 3-inch squares, so I yielded 16 mini turnovers out of one sheet... 32 total.

I really enjoyed making and serving these. Everyone loved them. My only caveat is that the Pilsbury puff pastry can only be cut into four pieces, not nine; plan accordingly.

These were very tasty and easy to make, although I would change the spices. I added what was asked and it was way too much. I would cut the spices down a bit. Otherwise it was pretty tasty!

This recipe was very easy to make.  I only put in half the cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.   I also added marshmellows to the batter. The turnovers had a really good taste.  I did have to bake them for about 25 minutes.

These are very simple and pretty.  They are a nice alternative to pie.  Dusted with sugar, as someone suggested and they taste yummy.  Not really exciting, but good for a change this time of year.

Yummy Yummy !! These turned out great and were impressive looking ! I made small squares/rectangels instead of the usual triangles, but there were equally delicious ! I also used pumpkin that I cubed and boiled until tender, and sweetened more to taste. I will definately be using this recipe around the holidays !

Simple, easy and quick recipe. Perfect after dinner treat. Next time I will cut the sheet into 4 pieces instead of 9 because I'd like to get more filling inside the turnover.
