I love sundried tomatoes and I love arugula. The only reason i am giving this four stars is because I think it the arugula should be in the pizza, not on top after the pizza is done, and I think it needed more seasoning. I would add oregano, garlic powder, and maybe some crushed red pepper flakes if you like some heat. Still a very good pizza and I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a good pizza but could use more seasoning.  I added crushed red pepper and grilled chicken.  I used homemade sauce and used half cup less cheese.
