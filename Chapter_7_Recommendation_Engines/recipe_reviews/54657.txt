Tried this tonight with some wonderful home grown tomatoes and it was delicious!  Didn't do they mayo though as I felt it was rich enough.  Just added some basil to a small portion of prepared mayo and used just a dollop on each piece.  We did have some left over so we'll have to see if it reheats OK.  There was quite a bit of juice left in the pan which I removed so leftovers won't be soggy.

Delicious recipe! Used a frozen deep dish pie crust as a timesaver. Also, used more than 1/2 pound of Italian sausage. My advice is to make this the day before you want to serve it so it will have a chance to become more solidified. I only had three small Roma tomatoes and wish that I had more. You definately need the tomatoes in this dish. Also, do not add any salt whatsoever. Didn't bother with making the fresh mayo though I think it would be terrific with this. Went wonderful with a Chianti.

I just made this for my tomato-loving son for dinner. He says it is awesome. It is a little juicy, even after I took reviewer's suggestion and juiced and drained the tomatoes. It's finally set up after sitting for 40 minutes, so I'll have to play with that next time I make it. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very yummy. The only thing I would do differently, is to blanch the tomatoes before and peel them. The skins don't bake so well in the oven.

DEFINITELY needs more egg.  I put in 3 eggs instead of just 1, and I think it would have fallen apart without them.  Eggs are like the glue that hold a quiche together!!  But, with the 3 eggs (and no other changes) it was DELICIOUS, both my husband and houseguest enjoyed it.

DEEE-LISH!  This was much more like a meal than the other tomato basil tart on the site.  I again used tons (maybe 3/4 cup?) chopped fresh basil (YUM!!) instead of dried, and used the ready-to-serve Hillshire farm sausage (8 oz of the 16 oz "U" link it comes in) to cut down on all the oil & grease cooked sausage would have created.  Also did not pre-cook the onions-- I don't think they need it.  Tossed 1/2 of a chopped green pepper, too, and layered each of the main ingredients.  Used LOTS of garden tomatoes - more than called for.  MAKE SURE you remove the seeds from the tomatoes first!!!  The first time I made this, it was way too watery.  The second time, with the seeded tomatoes, it came out perfectly!  I think allowing a full 30 minutes for it to cool before cutting is important, too.  DID NOT make the basil mayo "topping" for this - blecch!  Don't think it needs any sort of topping, but is nicely accompanied by a fresh cucumber-dill salad on the side!  :-)  THANKS!!!

Great recipe!!! I like others did not make the basil mayo but think it would have worked well. Made my own pie crust & used a smoked sausage instead of Italian. Added only 1 cup of cheese (1/2 on top, 1/2 on bottom). It set up perfectly well with only 1 egg & was much less sickly than a regular quiche. Will be making again :)

Definately would make again!  I added the spices to the egg mixture and doubled the garlic.  Didn't use the mayo - thought it was fine without. Also followed advice in other reviews - seeded the tomatoes and let sit for 20 -30 minutes before cutting.  Next time will try it with a 3rd egg.  Great way to use the garden tomatoes!

If you want to impress people, make this.  Very quick and easy, and so tasty.  I plan on substituting spinach for the tomatoes, or maybe in addition to them, next time. I didn't make the basil mayo as it's very rich on its own. Reheats very well.

Got two pounds of tomatoes from the store on sale and just when I was thinking I might turn them into marinara sauce, this recipe came along.  Boy am I glad I didn't make the marinara sauce because this pie rocks!  I usually don't like tomatoes but I'm on my second helping right now.  The recipe itself is so versatile, you can add and subtract ingredients to your liking.  I added green pepper, substituted soy sausage and used half cheddar and half mozzarella.  A definite 5-star recipe!

Very nice tart.  Couldn't bring myself to make the mayo.  Bc so many of the reviews mentioned this tart was juicy and I wanted to eat it the day after making it, I roasted the slices of tomato in the oven at 375 for about 20 minutes.  That seemed to work--there was some liquid (maybe a tbsp) that I drained off while still hot, but probably not enough to get soggy.  It was perfectly fine this evening when I pulled it out to heat it up.  I thought there were too many tomatoes, but bf disagreed.  I like the flavors but maybe I'd prefer to layer them instead.  Still, an excellent tart that we enjoyed for dinner tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for sharing, we really enjoyed this recipe.  Didn't have lt cream so I used sour cream instead, yum!  Next time I'll try ricotta to replace the lt cream.

Amazing. I used bulk breakfast sausage from the butcher instead because I wanted it more breakfasty, used 3 eggs and fresh basil instead since I didn't have the dried kind.  Roasted the tomato slices first for about 15 minutes and had no problem with it being watery at all. Didn't make the dip... but will next time!

didn't turn out at all. Too watery and just not a good taste. I used a pie shell the size that they called for and it didn't all fit there was too much filling. There are only two of us and used the amount of tomato's called for but will not use it again.

Super tasty! I even made the homemade mayonnaise sauce, but I agree with the other reviewers- the tart is rich enough and the sauce makes it almost too rich. The only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because as many reviewers stated, the result was a little too runny. I drained off as much of the tomato liquid and seeds as I could, but it still came out runny and I had to drain the liquid from the tart after I removed the first few pieces. I will definitely make this again, but next time, I will either use more eggs (as one reviewer suggested) and/or add a little corn starch to thicken the cream. But my husband loved it too, so I'll definitely make it again. I think it would be really good even without any meat.

The flavors are good, but the consistency is not.  It's very watery, even after sitting for 20 minutes.

I made this twice so far and both times it was really watery.  The last time I made it I put a ton of salt on my sliced tomatoes and let them sit for an hour or two to draw out the water.  I did that because people said that this tart was too "juicy" because of the tomatoes.  So that wasn't my problem.  I also let the tart sit for 40 minutes so it could solidify a little more.  I did use 3 eggs like some others suggested.  I think next time I will use 2 eggs and one cup of heavy cream as suggested by The Food Network's Good Eats "Refrigerator Pie".  Otherwise, it is a good recipe.

This was so good. I made it for a party and I'm sure it sprouted legs and walked off the table by itself it went so quick! I was asked for the recipe at least twice. I do have to confess I didn't make the mayonnaise either maybe next time. Apart from that I wouldn't change a thing and will make again soon. Many thanks

It was good. Reminded me of a quiche. The sausage I used wasn't savory enough.  If I make it again, I'd use a spicy sausage.

Made 3 of these for a bridal shower and everyone raved about it.  Has such a lovely taste.  After reading some of the reviews I decided to go with 2 eggs and used half heavy cream and half milk for liquid.  I baked them on the morning of the shower, let them cool and refrigerated then covered with foil placed them in oven at 200 Deg about 45 minutes before serving.  They were scrumptious and this is now my new favorite quiche recipe. I didn't make the basil mayo but may try it next time although the taste was so good I would be afraid it would deter.

2 lb of tomatoes definitely seems wildly out of proportion for a typical deep dish 9" crust (and may be why some people ended up with sogginess).  For me, about 4 plum tomatoes sliced thin did the trick just fine.

Not to either my hubby or my liking.  Just didn't make the grade.  Even pre-baked the crust, but still soggy.  Don't think I would even make it for a luncheon.  Sorry about that.

This was a very good pie/tart.  I accidentally made it with a full pound of sausage so it was a little sausage heavy, but it was still good.  I didn't make the mayonnaise either.  I will make this again when I have fresh tomatoes.

Good recipe.  I felt there was a little too much of a Dijon taste.  I might cut back on this a little next time.  Used at a Baby shower brunch.

I made my own pastry crust and used a tart pan with removeable bottom.  Was Delicious!  I didnt make the mayo and i dont think it needs it at all.  It is definately wise to seed your tomatoes before slicing and i used lots of fresh basil instead of dried.
