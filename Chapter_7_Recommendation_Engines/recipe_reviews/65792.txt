This cheese ball is wonderful.  I did double the cheddar cheese and used a few pimento-stuffed olives out of a jar instead of the can called for in the recipe.  I also had to refrigerate the mixture before it would roll into a ball.  Other than those changes, everything was perfect!

Great taste. I don't have a food processor. I just let all the cheeses get to room temperature then mixed them with a fork, or even easier, with my very clean hands.  I didn't have pecans. Used walnuts and it worked fine. Thanks.

This was the best cheeseball I've ever tasted including Hickory Farms. The flavor is strong and delicious. It holds it's shape great and can be made the night before and tastes just as good. Nice.

Caution: Don't think "I love blue cheese" and add more because that makes it too bluecheesy. (I tried it.) Made as is this is really good. Thanks for the recipie.

I just finieshed making this and I loved the flavor of this cheese ball. I did omit the olives though because  don't care for them. I also chilled it for about 2 hours and it was very easy to make into a ball after that. I can't wait to see how my family like it on Thanksgiving!Definitely a keeper!!!

This recipe seemed to make a better cheese "spread" than a "ball" but I wasn't put out by that at all.  It was delicious.  Although I hate when people review a recipe and then tell everyone all the substitutions they made, I did use feta (because I had it)instead of bleu cheese.  The results were great.  I will be making this one again before Christmas!

I don't have a food processor so made it in the mixer - the "wimps" said "too much blue cheese" - the real men and women said "not enough" I doubled it and the first disappeared right away and I had to protect my frozen one so it would last until Xmas!It wasn't ready to roll into a ball when done but did o.k. after sitting in the refrigerator overnite.

We didnt really like the flavor... too much olive.  Also it was too soft to make into a ball right away, had to let it sit in the fridge for a while.

This is a delicious cheese ball.  I made it exactly as the recipe said with only 3 exceptions.  I did not use a food processor, just softened the cream cheese and blended with my trusty wooden spoon.  I also only used about 1/4 cup of green olives that I measured whole and then sliced and chopped.  I let it set up overnight and formed into a ball without any problem.  I rolled the ball in chopped almonds.  Yum!

I have made this recipe every Thanksgiving for the past three years now and it is always a hit.  The best tasting cheeseball around.  I pretty much follow the recipe exactly.  Very easy and yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly as written. It was ok the day of but I served it the next day and it was not so good. My 35 guests barely touched it and close family members said it wasn't so good. So, as I liked it my guests did not. Will probably skip this for the next party.

Excellent flavor!  I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving get-together.  The guys gobbled it up while watching football.  We love blue cheese and the flavor was just enough to be bold without overpowering the entire thing.  We served it as a spread but it would have easily made a ball if I'd wanted to.  Will definitely be making this many more times!

I absolutely love this recipe.  It's so easy to make and really works well for a crowd.  I too omit the olives.  I also love to add crispy bacon to the ball--I think it gives it an added touch.

Thanks for the recipe!

The only drawback to this wonderful recipe is that they want to fill up on it prior to the meal, then can't eat seconds of turkey!  A definite keeper.

This was delicious! Definitely a keeper. We omitted the olives, as some in our family don’t like them and used slightly less onion. It was the first thing to disappear off of the table.

I have fixed this numerous times with great reviews.  The last time I made it I used the entire 4 ounce container of blue cheese and everyone seemed to like it even better.  This has become a staple of mine for Thanksgiving!

Okay, but not awesome. I like all the ingredients that go in it but somehow the combo wasn't right. 4 dashes of Worchestshire sauce might be too much, at least if your bottle has a slotted opening like mine. The sauce just poured out. One tip for forming the ball - if you spoon the mix onto plastic wrap, then wrap it up and roll, you'll get a ball with no messy hands!

I don't think I will make this one again :( I love all the ingredients, that's why I chose this recipe, but I guess I don't like them all together. Maybe if I left out the garlic and/or onion? I don't know!

Pretty good.  I liked the green olive and bleu cheese.  Still wasn't the perfect cheeseball that I've been searching for, though.

This is easy to make and good, but we found it a little strong.  I think next time I'll cut the blue cheese in half and not use the olives.

Excellent!  Everyone loved it and asked where I got the recipe.  The green olives give it a great flavor.

I omitted the bleu cheese (just because I didn't have any), but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Everyone absolutely LOVED it! I'll make this every year. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great cheese ball. I made the recipe as is and everyone liked it. I did let it chill before rolling in nuts, (I did use walnuts) and it turned out perfect. I much fresher taste that store bought cheese balls.

I used to receive a cheese ball from a family member years ago. It was amazing. I found this recipe & tried it, it's the same cheese ball. It is so good. I also did not use a food processor. I just used a fork and spatula. I did not put green olives, as I don't like them. I added one little touch, I used Trader Joe's candid pecans & it makes this unbelievable. I could eat this whole ball myself.

I have been making an almost identical cheese ball for many years. My recipe calls for no olives, and 4oz blue cheese, 4 oz cheddar cheese. the other ingredients in the same amounts. keeps well in the fridge.

This is my "go to" recipe for holiday gatherings.  I use garlic olives from the "olive bar" at local grocery store for a little extra flavor. I've found that with a little extra cheddar cheese the consistency is easier to roll, or you can just refrigerate the mixture prior to rolling into the ball.
