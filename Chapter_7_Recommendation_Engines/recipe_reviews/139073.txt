I didn't have a smoker, so I added 1 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke when cooking the carrots and onions. I was missing some ingredients so I used 1tsp smoked chipotle Tabasco sauce and 1/2tsp red pepper flakes instead of jalape√±o peppers and instead of the celery I added more onion and some celery salt. To lower the cholesterol, I used margarine and omitted the cream. It still turned out creamy even though it was 100% vegan! I would love to taste it with carrots from a smoker! The flavors are quite good.

WOW! WOW! WOW! I more or less cut this in half.  I used my stove top smoker, steamed the carrot coins first then smoked.  Not enough smoke flavor so I smoked again. (just learning)  I used 2 whole serranos and holy cow it was literally, hurt me good smoking hot. I blended twice but didn't strain.  As I reached into the fridge for the cream I  happened upon the goat milk/buttermilk combo from my failed chevere making experiment.  I took the notion to see how that would be in the soup.  My taste sample was crazy good so I used 2 cups of the combined milks, tasting as I added. It was plenty thick enough as it had reduced a good bit.  This was CRAZY GOOD. 5 stars for the taste before I added the goat milk and 5 stars with my changes.  The kiddo didn't care for it but she's funny with cooked carrots, plus it was a bit too hot for her. She can have raman when I indulge in this delight. THANK YOU PappaB.Mc!

LOVED IT!  I had lots of carrots to use, so looked up recipes until I found this one.  I did change things, just to use what I had on hand.  Here's what I did:
1 1/2 lbs of grated carrots,  1 onion, but added onion powder,  1 1/2 T EVOO, 4 cloves of garlic,  3 stalks of celery,  no tumeric, 2 t curry powder, 1 t cumin powder, no butter,  4 oz cream cheese,  1 t smoked,  paprika,  1/4-1/2 t South African smoked pepper,  kosher salt,  2 lg boxes of low sodium veggie broth.
I followed the recipe on prep, except the roasting part.  I used my immersion blender to puree carrots & blend in the cream cheese.  I will definately make this again.  Love the 'fall' color, the smoky flavor, with a curry kick.  Thanks for the recipe.

This sounded so good but was a big disappointment, especially with all the prep work you must do to put this soup together. It was a bland carrot bisque with too much smokey flavor and the jalapeno was to overbearing. There are much better bisques out there.
