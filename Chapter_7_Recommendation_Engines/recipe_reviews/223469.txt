This recipe as written doesn't work.  There's simply not enough liquid to cook 2/3 cup of oatmeal in the microwave, the texture ends up dry and chunky.  I knew it, but I followed the instructions anyway, ended up  adding another 5 Tbsp milk, and it still wasn't "creamy."  However.......it certainly has potential to be 5 stars.  I would add  one more step which wouldn't add much more time to preparation.  Add some boiling water to the oatmeal until you achieve the right consistency, then stir in the other ingredients and microwave just long enough for the peanut butter and the blueberries to soften.  It's certainly worth another try because the combination of ingredients really makes a tasty oatmeal.

I doubled this recipe to feed two. I upped the milk to 1 1/3 cups and omitted the two tablespoons of milk. The recipe as written would not have worked with that little amount of liquid. This was an okay recipe, my youngest thought it tasted like a peanut butter and blueberry jam sandwich. I think with a little tweaking, it could be much better. Three and a half stars.
