This is a tasty, quick dinner recipe that I've made twice now. We put it on the grill once and I would recommend cooking the sausage just until done before adding to pizza as the crust tends to brown more quickly on the grill. I also added a few italian spices.

Ridiculously simple, but I would suggest adding a little something extra... garlic, or maybe make your own pizza sauce. I also always cook the sausage a bit on the stove, first, just to be on the safe side. I love having thinly sliced black olives on my sausage pizza, too. Great base of a recipe, though!

Simple and delicious!  This was perfect for a Friday night meal.  I used store bought pizza dough and opted out of the green peppers (husband isn't a big fan of it on pizza).  I removed the sausage from its casing, crumbled it and pan fried it removing a lot of the grease.  Overall, very tasty!

Using the Quick and Easy Pizza crust recipe on AR, which only takes 8-10 minutes in my oven, I knew immediately I'd need to brown the sausage first before adding it to the pizza. I used Johnsonville's half pork/half chicken sausage to save a few calories and it was wonderful! Honestly, I didn't measure out any of the ingredients, but rather, topped according to amount/taste preference. My 4 year-old DD's half only had sausage and cheese, but the adult half contained green peppers and white onion, which sauteed briefly with the sausage; pepperoni, and thinly sliced mushrooms, which I also barely sauteed with our favorite seasonings. Husband came home from a guys' night out and quickly demolished a couple pieces. He even polished off the remaining cold slices for breakfast this morning, and he's already requested this AGAIN for dinner tonight!

Precooked the sausage and drained to remove some of the grease. Quick and easy for those busy nights.

I didn't make this the easy way.  I made my own pizza crust and sauce, halved the amount of sausage, and spread it out over two pizzas.  Then, I added sliced green and red peppers and onions.  The pizza was delicious, and can handle having veggies added to it with ease!  It was FABULOUS and didn't last long in our household.

I really liked this pizza, but made a few changes due to availability & preference. I made my own crust because our store doesn't have anything like that. I also added mushrooms, red onions, & pepperoni because we like it that way.Even if I hadn't of changed anything, it would have been wonderful.

Yuck. Very, very, very greasy. Made this for friends and we had to sop the grease off with a napkin. If I had looked further down the page at the "nutrition" information I never would have made it. One serving is almost an entire day's fat and sodium. This sausage is terrible and I won't use it again.  BTW this is the exact same recipe as the jonsonville easy sausage pizza so my review is the same.

I used Johnsonville HOT Italian sausage and it was delicious -- I highly recommend it for putting on your pizza. The only reason I am rating this recipe down is because it's not a good idea to put the uncooked sausage on your pizza. Although it came out fully cooked (which was one of my concerns), it also made the pizza very, very greasy. For better results, I definitely suggest browning the sausage lightly first and draining off the grease. I also think the whole package of sausage is a bit much for a 12-inch pizza, and I'm a meat lover. Overall, I will definitely add Johnsonville hot Italian sausage to pizza in the future, but this recipe needs some tweaking before it can be a five-star recipe.

Yum. I added mushrooms and cooked the veggies and sausage on the stove top first (because I can't read directions it seems)  Delicious!

Using a pre-made crust made this recipe extra quick and easy! I did decide to pre-cook my sausage but I don't think it would have needed it if the pieces were small enough. I also added other toppings to my preference - onions, peppers, fresh mushrooms. Yum!

Great tasting pizza and so easy to make! Easy weeknight dinner. I used the hot Italian sausage links. Three mini pizzas (6 inch) used one link total.

Definitely making again, followed recipe exactly except I made my own pizza crust from the quick and easy pizza crust recipe on this site.
Delicious and easy to make.  Cost about $10. Every bit as good as pizza from a delivery restaurant, except better because it is homemade.

Johnsonville sausage is amazing on pizza! I used Johnsonville HOT Italian sausage links. I also added onion, zucchini and tomatoes to our pizza because we love vegetables. Our friends said that the sausage was AMAZING on pizza. Thanks Johnsonville!

I like to make pizza on the grill to get the brick oven flavor, so I used the “Grill Dough” on this site.  Because the baking time would be less than if I baked it in the oven, I crumbled and browned the sausage before adding it to the pizza.  I also added sautéed sliced onion and sun-dried tomatoes.  Delicious.

Try mixing fennel seeds in the sausage and sprinkle some on the sauce. Also, add white onions as a topping.

as other have said, you absolutely need to precook the sausage. I made the small pieces and microwaved them 2 minutes before adding to the pizza.  I thought it was a little bland for pizza but living in Chicago for 31yrs may have made me a little critical.  Taste was just okay, it needs a little help in the spices and vegetables added.  Still, a great place to start.

This is just as the recipe states "easy sausage pizza."  Customize to your liking, but I do recommend preparing the sausage like this recipe suggests.  When the raw sausage cooks on the pizza it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.

This is a quick, yummy meal. Made this for a Sunday lunch with the kids. The Johnsonville Sausage was just spicy enough and added so much flavor. We prefer onions to peppers on our pizza, so that was the only change I made. Excellent.

This was so good! I made a different version using alfredo sauce, Asiago cheese, mozzarella cheese and Johnsonville smoked sausage. It was PERFECTLY delicious! Creamy alfredo sauce goes so well with smoked sausage! In NY we call this a 'white pizza' because of the white colored sauce! Instead of alfredo sauce you could just using ricotta seasoned with salt, pepper and grated parmesan to taste. Then use it as the sauce for the pizza and add your toppings plus mozzarella!

I used the Johnsonville All Natural Mild Italian Sausage pinched into little pieces and it cooked perfectly on pizza, in other words, NO need to precook. Nice balance of flavor, a little spice and very little grease. No complaints from anyone in house. Will be using Johnsonville for our homemade pizzas from now on.

Start with your favorite (Freschetta or DIGIORNO) pizza and add whatever you love plus more shredded cheese on top to hold your favorite toppings on .... I sauté fresh half a tomatoe after squeezing some of juice off  to reduce liquid along with bell, onion, mushrooms,  etc. and set aside on paper towel while doing meat toppings in the same pan. Pile it on and top it with cheese... Your favorite pizza parlor will be your own kitchen and a heck of a lot cheaper, better tasting too! Wrap leftover in foil to reheat  until hot,  rip the top of the foil off and broil a couple minutes to finish ... And it's killer easy!

Loved it with a couple of changes, because I had the time. Oven roasted sausage, red, green and yellow peppers and garlic glove in oven....mixed it well with  olive oil and a little salt and pepper. After roasting all for 45  minutes on 350 , placed all on homemade pizza crust, which I had poured a can of pizza sauce onto crust.  The crust can be thin or thick, either way, I dust my pizza pan, I use a stone pan, with cornmeal for a yummy professional crust. IF making a thick or pan crust....place just the unbanked crust in roaring hot oven, 450-500 , degrees for 5 minutes before adding sauce and other ingredients. After all is in place, top pie with shredded mozzarella cheese then bake at 350  for 20 to 40 minutes depending on crust type and individual ovens. VERY IMPORTANT step.....let pie rest for 5 minutes before cutting...also, kitchen shears great for pizza cutting! Enjoy!!!

For my pizza crust I used a product I got from a traveling show at Costco---Mediterranean Focaccias---that come in different flavors.  If you see that demonstration, be sure to pick some up because they were the perfect base for this!  They are 7" rounders that make for perfect individual pizzas!  I used a combo of Johnsonville All Natural Mild and Hot Ground Sausage for the meat and Trader Joe's Marinara Sauce for the base.  I did precook the sausage.  Yum!

I used tofuyan pita breads for the crust.  I also used Johnsonville's Hot ground Italian Sausage instead of mild and pre-cooked the sausage.   Was a quick and easy meal, would make again.

Used my homemade sauce, and made some homemade pizza crusts...It's so fun! I used Johnsonville Italian sausage, removed the casing and crumbled it....great sausage for a pizza! I like pre-baking small crusts and have everyone make their own pizza with all the ingredients all precut- like a taco bar! Everyone so enjoys it!

At first I was wary of using the raw sausage on the pizza, but it turned out excellent!  I used the "Bread Maker Pizza Dough" recipe from Allrecipes, and cooked it in the oven on the top shelf for about 20 minutes.  The edges were nice and dark and crispy, and the flavor of the pizza dough paired wonderfully with the sweet sausage pieces (I used only two of the Sweet Italian Sausages for my pizza, and pinched them into smaller pieces).  I added some chopped onion too.

This was a very simple pizza recipe, but, very flavorful using Johnsonville sausage!  The italian sausage really kicked it up a knotch.   I prefer fresh dough, so, I did use that compared to a precooked crust.  I go to my local pizza parlor and buy a roll of unbaked dough for around $ 3.00.  It is a great time saver like using a prebaked crust, but, more flavorful.  I prebake for 3-5 minutes before adding the toppings.   I was a little nervous about topping with fresh sausage, so, I precooked it about 50% of way through before adding it to the pizza.  It turned out perfect.

This was fabulous!  I did not prebake my crust; I just used a thin crust pizza and precooked the sausage, then sliced into rounds.  Added some mushrooms and onions just because they were there.  10 minutes on the middle rack and 2 on the bottom rack.  FABULOUS!

Sausage on pizza is great! I was leary of using raw sausage. So, I used some Johnsonville meatballs I made the other day that needed the spices and flavorings upped for my taste. I warmed them up and crumbled them in a bowl and added minced garlic, hot pepper flakes, Italian seasonings, garlic powder, sea salt, and olive oil. I sprinkled them on the pizza and followed through with the recipe. I baked it in my NuWave oven to save time. Only reason why I didn't post it as 5 stars, as I didn't care much for the pre-made crust. Definitely consider making homemade dough. I also made my own pizza sauce and probably used half the amount suggested and it was plenty. Quick meal anyhow! Thanks
