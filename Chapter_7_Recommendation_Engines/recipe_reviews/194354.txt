I made these to take to the teachers tomorrow for Teacher Appreciation Day :) They turned out great and are very pretty, too :) I followed the directions exactly. the only thing I would do differently next time is perhaps lessen the baking time. I baked mine for 21 minutes and I think I could have taken them out a few minutes before that. A nice light, lemony cupcake!

Awesome cake!! This is the best lemon cake. The cake is moist and just enough lemon flavor without overwhelming your tastebuds! I did add some lemon juice to the frosting but it was great!

I cheated a bit an used a boxed lemon cake mix since that is what I had so I only made the frosting, but wow was it good!  I also added a bit more lemon juice and added a few drops of yellow food coloring to make them look more lemony.  I made the cupcakes for my daughter's class for snack and she said the kids all loved them.  I really liked the frosting too, sweet and tangy like a glass of lemonade!

Holy guacamole these are good!!  About as close to cupcake perfection as I've ever encountered. I love the texture of these. I did add some lemon extract to the batter and a bit more lemon juice to the frosting.  Adorned these little beauties with some zest curls for a very nice presentation.  I do think you could cut the frosting in half and have enough unless you like 4" of frosting on your cupcake. Mine were done at 20 min. so you may want to watch the time.  My friends just raved about these and wanted the recipe. Thank you jello!!

The cupcakes are very dense. They only need to bake for 17 to 18 minutes. I tasted the batter before cooking them and I recommend adding about 4 tablespoons of lemon juice because they didn't have much flavor when made as directed. The frosting is tangy and good. I used 3 tablespoons of lemon juice in that as well.

We were having a "cupcake swap" at work - the lemon-cream cheese cupcakes were a BIG hit.  They were easy to make and the taste was great.  I used a pastry bag (i.e. ziplock with a tip) to pipe on the icing - not only was the taste fabulous but they looked pretty as well!

These cupcakes were delicious!  Based on the other reviews I only cooked them for 18 minutes and they came out perfect.  I also added some fresh lemon juice to the batter.  As for the icing, I used more powdered sugar, about a 1/4 cup more. I also added the rest of the juice from the lemon to make it extra tangy.  The frosting turned out nice and thick.

Made these several times, including for my daughter's 3rd birthday party.  Always a hit!  I usually do have leftover icing, but you can always dip some fresh fruit in it!  Making them again for Easter dessert this time around.

Delicious cupcakes! Although I'm not sure the benefit of using a white cake mix and lemon jello vs. just using a lemon cake mix. I made these for my dad's birthday because he LOVES lemon. I made the lemon flavor even more intense by adding the zest of one lemon and 1 Tbsp. lemon juice to the cake batter. I also added lemon zest to the frosting. Love the frosting, cream cheese and lemon go so well together!

These were so good! I can't get over how moist they were. I would highly suggest to anyone about to make this to get the white cake mix that has pudding in the mix. I think that really helped make my cupcakes so delicious. With the pudding already in the cake mix and the extra lemon pudding, how could it not? I also added extra lemon juice to the cake mix and icing. My only concern is that I think too much lemon juice in the icing will make it runny so be careful. If you like moist lemon cupcakes then you need to try this recipe. I always keep a really close eye while baking so I don't overbake. I am not sure exactly how long they cooked for, I just kept checking them with a toothpick. This is a great recipe and a keeper in my house!

I used only the frosting from this recipe, but did not like it at all.  I ended up starting over with a different cream cheese based lemon frosting.

AMAZING! I could not stop eating these! Instead of using the pudding mix (sorry Jello), I used lemon oil (used for making candy). I also added lemon oil to the frosting. I cannot get over how good these were! I will definitely make this again!

Oh my these are yummy! I made these as written except I used a yellow cake mix instead of a white cake mix because that is what I had on hand. The combo of the cake and the frosting is amazing. Will make again and again!

I wish I could give 2-1/2 because these cupcakes are that - right in the middle, take 'em or leave 'em, mediocrity at its best. I was going for "wow" and got "meh". You get the drift.   Anyway I took the recent comments into consideration and made some modifications, mostly with cooking time. Despite their being done in 18 minutes a few of them were still burned on the bottom! It may have been my pan, but still, really? I made a note that if I bake them again to do so at 325 instead of 350. Also I think the yield is off as I measured out each cupcake carefully with my 1/4 cup and only came up with 20 cupcakes. Not a problem for me, but if you're counting on getting more, you should be prepared.  The frosting was the best part of this cupcake. It was creamy and lemony - I added a few drops of yellow food coloring because otherwise the frosting is basically white. I piped the frosting on using the star tip - makes for pretty presentation and also much quicker than spreading with a knife. However if you plan to do this do not modify and make the frosting harder as one reviewer did or you will have a heck of a time.  I probably won't make these again just because of the disappointment - instead I'll continue my pursuit of the perfect cupcake recipe!

This recipe is very delicious.  The cupcakes are very moist and dense.  Per other reviews I added about a 1/4 cup more of powdered sugar and a little bit more lemon juice to the frosting.  It came out tasting way too much like cream cheese at first.  I did have a good amount of frosting left so I made sugar cookies and frosted those with the leftovers.  I will be making these again!!!

THese cupcakes were delicious and oh so easy to make.  Like others have suggested, I used lemon cake mix instead of white cake mix to bring out the lemony flavor.  Mine were not heavy as some suggested and the frosting is possibly the best I've ever tasted.  It isn't a stiff frosting, so make sure the cupcakes are completely cooled before you frost them.  Of course, you could add more powdered sugar if you like the frosting a little stiffer.

Very dense, rich cupcake, but the lemon flavor seems to lighten it up.  My husband is truly a cake snob and he can't stop raving about these cupcakes!  I followed the directions exactly and, in my oven, they took about 21 minutes to bake.  I filled the liners about 2/3 full and ended up with 21 cupcakes, all nicely-risen above the rim of the liner.  The icing was very simple to make and allowed plenty of icing on each cupcake, with maybe 4 or 5 tablespoons left over.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is a keeper.. The cupcakes were delicious!  I changed the recipe a little because I wanted to make vanilla cupcakes so I used vanilla pudding instead of lemon, and added 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, plus the seeds from one vanilla bean and the result was amazing!!  The cake was very light and fluffy, not dense or dry at all.  I followed the directions exactly, and kept an eye on the time as other reviews said to do and mine were ready in exactly 20 min.  I will definitely be keeping and using this recipe in the future, thanks for sharing!

These were good - but not mind-blowing which I guess I expected after reading the reviews.  I really liked them though and they had a great lemon flovor - and not too complicated.

These were SO good! I made them this way the first time, and the lemon flavor was great. The second time I made them, I used the 'coconut cream cheese' recipe from this site, and it made these EVEN better! The lemon-coconut combo was great. Definitely a refreshing 'summery' dessert.

I made these one of my husband's co-worker's birthdays and was specifically asked to make them again for the next birthday.  I made them for a bridal shower and everyone raved about how delicious they were.  These cupcakes are AWESOME.  I did make a few very minor changes.

1) I used a lemon cake mix instead of white. (still added the lemon pudding)
2) I doubled the amount of lemon juice in the frosting to 4 Tbsp. and added a touch of yellow food coloring.
3) I filled the cupcakes with lemon curd.  You can make your own, or if pressed for time, I buy Dickinson's (most any grocery store should carry this, Wal-mart does). 
4) I baked for only 18 minutes. 
Super moist, perfect amount of lemon flavor, and absolutely divine.  This recipe is a definite keeper!!

These are very dense like a pound cake.  I like my cupcakes to be lighter, especially lemon ones.  Also they didn't taste very lemony.

These cupcakes taste great!  I made two adjustments to the frosting recipe: I used 1 cup of powdered sugar for the frosting (the original recipe seemed to specify to use the whole bag of sugar) and I doubled the lemon juice (I used 1/4 cup total).

These were very easy to make and plated well.  I made them for a baby shower and everyone loved them!  The only criticism I would have is that the cupcakes were a little drier than I like.  No one mentioned it, but I noticed it.  The frosting is to die for!

These are my new favorite cupcakes. These cupcakes are moist and light and have a good lemon flavor.  I will be making these again.  I confess I did add a little lemon flavor to half the batter.  Either way they were delicious.

Wow!  With a few adjustments these turned out great!  I used a box of lemon cake mix.  I was so hesitant to use only egg whites and just 2 TB oil as the box called for 3 whole eggs and much more oil.  I was afraid it would turn out very hard but it was actually so moist!  I baked mine at 325 for about 23 minutes in 2 9X9 round cake pans.  I made a layer cake and had plenty of icing for the middle layer and to completely cover the cake.  I used 1/4 cup lemon juice in the icing and it still didn't seem very lemony so I added a couple dashes of lemon extract and a little extra powdered sugar (as it was very thin to start)- Perfection.  I made this for my daughter's 6th b'day- St. Paddy's Day- so I made it all green (cake and icing) with gel food coloring.  Everyone raved about the flavor.  Will definitely be making this again with the above mentioned adjustments as I don't think white cake mix would make it lemony enough.  Also, you really do need to add extra lemon flavor to the icing.

Everyone loves these!! I add a little fresh lemon juice and lemon zest to my batter AND frosting, Aslo i add yellow food coloring to give it a very pretty appearance.  I love how easy it is and I always keep ingredents in the house for the "just in case we need cup-cakes" kind of moment.  I also made these for my friends bridal shower and tinted the frosting in her wedding colors!! It was still a light a refreshing treat!

Awesome-tasting and very moist cupcakes!!  I substituted lemon cake mix for the white, but otherwise followed the cupcake recipe exactly as written.  (We love STRONG lemon flavors!)  I only used 1.5 TBS lemon juice in the frosting because it was already very creamy.  (I added the lemon juice 1/2 TBS at a time.)

I thought the frosting was delicious (I added 1/4 cup more sugar and only used 1/2 the cream cheese), but I wasn't impressed with the cupcake itself.  Like other reviewers indicated, the cupcakes were very dense and a little dry.  I probably won't repeat this recipe.

I made mini-cupcakes for work for a contest and WON!  I had several leftover and served them at a family function they were a hit there as well.   I doubled the recipe and added one box white and one box lemon cake mix.  For the frosting I put it in the freezer then re-whipped it right before serving so it wouldn't spread so thinly.  I'm a fan for life now!!!

the frosting was really good but like others say the cake part is a bit on the heavy side. i think if you were to use lemon jello instead of the pudding it would work alot better.

These cupcakes are delicious!  I've received a lot of wonderful compliments on them.  I did make some minor changes after reading through the reviews.  I added 4 tbsp of lemon juice to the batter, only used 6 oz of cream cheese in the icing so it wasn't so cheesy, and added an extra tbsp of lemon juice to the icing.  As an experiment, I piped raspberry jam into some of the cupcakes before icing them.  It added a wonderful flavor and made this cupcake one of my favorites!!

These were a great summer treat!  Per other reviews, I added about 1/4 C extra powdered sugar and much more lemon juice to the frosting, which still had a strong cream cheese flavor.  The lemon flavor really came through the cupcakes sat in the fridge overnight.  Will definitely be bringing these to the next picnic!

Fantastic! The cupcakes and the frosting are just bursting with lemon flavor. I will certainly be making these again. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Unlike others, I did not have any frosting left over at all, but that's probably because I piped rather than spread it on. Thanks! :)

These were so dry and dense, not even worth eating, tossed them all out. Followed recipe to the "T", but ended up being a big bust so made way better ones with different recipe.

I've made other pudding+cake mix recipes that were moist and fabulous, so I had high hopes. Turned out a little dry and dense, but still pretty good. Frosting was super, though.

I made this as a two layer cake vs. cupcakes.  I also added the whole eggs instead of egg whites and used fresh lemon juice for the frosting.  Oh my goodness.  This is my favorite summer cake from now on.  I got so many compliments on this!  The icing is incredible.  Next time I will try adding some raspberry preserves between the layers, for a different twist.  Not that it needs any improvements!  Try this cake, you will love it!

These were great and were a big hit with the kids...tasted better the next day!  Not as "lemony" as I thought they would be but lemon flavor really came through in the frosting after sitting over night.  Next time I might forget the cream cheese and just use a lemony glaze.

Very disappointing. I'm not sure what happened, as I followed the recipe exactly. The cupcakes were very chewy and hard to eat, and the icing was too runny. I live in a high altitude area, so maybe the recipe needed to be adjusted for that? I was sad, as I had high hopes for these cupcakes.

My 16 year old daughter had a cupcake wars party with her friends and this was one of the recipes they made. At the end of the evening we had a taste test and these were almost unanimously voted number one.  They were so easy to make and beat out some more complicated recipes. We're definitely making them again.

The frosting needed more lemon flavor.  I added the zest of two lemons and it was still not lemony enough for me.

These were easy to mix up and had good flavor, but I agree the timing was off.  I made 12 (if I had made 24 they would have been mini cupcakes) and they were burnt at the bottom after 21 minutes.  I can't imagine how burnt they would have been if I had made 24 of them as the recipe called for.

This recipe was delicious! I loved how it turned out. The lemon flavor was just right in my opinion. I did take some other reviewers' advice and added a splash of lemon juice into my batter, and I also did not use the entire 5 cups of sugar. I dont actually know how much i used... I just kept adding until I liked the flavor. It was maybe 3 cups? And then i added 3 drops of yellow coloring to give it a nice pastel yellow color. My sister and her friend enjoyed them as much as I did! Will definitely make these again.

I brought these to my father and they are dad approved. I used the spring time cake mix instead of the white cake mix. I did not change anything else. I will be adding this cupcake to my spring time mix. :)

These are the"best" cupcakes I have ever had! I used cake mix with pudding already in along with the lemon pudding, also added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and the lemon zest only because I like extra lemon flavor. The cupcake was so light and moist~icing delicious!

This was a really great recipe and they turned out pretty delicious!  I will make them again, but next time I would add a bit more lemon juice to the frosting.  And I'd also cut the frosting in half, because I put a ton on the cupcakes and still had a lot left over.  Other, yum!

These are COMPLETELY AWESOME!!! I made them for the first time on Mother's Day last year for my future mother-in-law. I wasn't sure how good they'd be, but she loves lemon and she loves cream cheese. This was a winner! She's had me make them multiple times! lol

These cupcakes were delicious. I could not find lemon pudding mix at my grocery store so I used lemon cake mix and vanilla pudding mix instead. The texture and moistness of the cupcake was wonderful. I made half of the icing and it was almost enough to cover the 20 cupcakes that the recipe yielded. I added some lemon zest and some extra lemon juice to the icing as well, on the suggestion of others. I also agree that they taste better the next day. I will definitely make this again and will experiment with different cake and pudding mixes.

I took other reviewers suggestions and added grated lemon rind or zest and I loved the extra little zing it gave. After icing the cake I topped it with fresh raspberries and then sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar over the raspberries. It looked very pretty but tasted even better!

Both cake and icing are very yummy!  For some reason my cupcakes didn't rise appropriately (could have do with being at higher altitude and making the wrong adjustments to recipe).  However, the taste was great anyway.  True, you make about double the frosting you need.  I threw my extra out and then regretted it later when I had fresh strawberries that were in need of a dip...  Next time I'll save the extra frosting!

The flavor is good but I thought the texture was too dense and dry. More oil would be good.

Very good cupcakes. Light lemon flavor. I didn't have lemon juice so I just left it out of the frosting. They still tasted yummy. Great for summer.

hmmmm good.  Cupcakes have the consistency of pound cake but are refreshing.  I cut the lemon juice in 1/2 and used a drop or two of yellow food coloring in the frosting.

Made these for guests and they were a big hit. The cake is moist and dense. The frosting was delicious!

These were very good.  Next time I will try these using 1 box of strawberry jello and crushed strawberries in the mix.

I made these cupcakes for a fish fry and they went over better than the fish! These are amazing and tasty cupcakes. The pudding mix makes them so moist!

I had trouble with the icing consistency, maybe because I used the Neufchatel cheese.  1 Tbsp lemon juice made it too thin to pipe & I had to add extra confectioner's sugar.

Mmmm, These are fantastic! I requested these be made for Mother's Day, and now I will ask for them every year! The only thing my husband changed was to double the amount of lemon juice in the frosting - it was divine!
