This was just ok, could be made better with a little tweaking.  If I ever did make it again, which I probably wouldn't because none of us cared for the consistency, I would add more sugar and cinnamon.

I thought this recipe was GREAT.  I had a bunch of apples and company over spur of the moment... Got on here and found this recipe really quickly, threw it together in just a couple minutes, and tossed it in the oven while I was fixing dinner.  Was ready just as we were finishing dinner... Took the suggestion of exchanging the sugar for 3/4 cup brown sugar just because I like brown sugar better as a rule.  Tasted awesome and the topping was REALLY yummy.  Offset the filling PERFECTLY.  Great recipe and I will DEFINITELY make it again.  The menfolk gobbled it up after a long day's work with some homemade vanilla ice cream.

We liked this recipe, but I also tweaked the recipe, too.
I used diced apples. They had been sitting in my fridge overnight soaked in some water, lemon juice, sugar, and cinnamon.
I also added to the apple mix 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I didnt use nutmeg because I didnt have any, just added extra cinnamon instead.
For the topping, I added some quick oats, and pummeled my walnuts untill they were almost powder. (My kids don't like big chunks of walnuts!)

All in all, it was good. I will probably make it again, but I am also going to keep looking for a recipe where the apples are a little saucier, almost just straight apples with a topping, instead of the way they are in this one. The apples are just to, I dont know. almost jelly-ish in this one with the baking mix and eggs.

Everyone who tried this absolutely loved it!  It was simple to put together and came out perfect.  I did use pecans rather than walnuts because of personal preference.  Delicious, and definitely a recipe I'll use often!

We loved this ! It's really not a pie more like cobbler. I did make a mistake while putting it together but it was a good mistake. I mixed up the baking powder amounts. So, the main apple part was supposed to be 1/2 cup but I put in 1 cup and so the other part I put in 1/2 cup. I will make it again just like this. It was SUPER !!

This is more like apple crisp than pie, but it was very good.  I halved the ingredients as I was the only one eating it, used Jonagold apples, and Splenda to sweeten the filling.  Forgot the butter but did not miss it.  Still very good warmed up with a scoop of healthy vanilla ice cream.

Delicious with some tweaking!  I subsituted 3/4 cups of brown sugar for 1 cup of white sugar, added 5 tbs of lemon juice and 1 tsp cloves to the filling.  Otherwise the filling would have been way to sweet and bland!  I also doubled the amount of walnuts in the topping, but think I could have tripled it and it would have been perfect!.  Definitely not a pie, but an easy and quick way to used up a lot of apples!

Really good! I made it for my work's pot-luck, and everyone was asking for more! Really good, but for a lighter taste you can try rasberrys or even blueberrys (Which is my boyfriends fav, by the way)

It worked out really well for me. Smelled wonderful out of the oven. I wouldn't call it a pie by any means, but it was very very good. The bisquick definitely adds a different texture to it, sort of like soggy bread, but not as gross. The crumb topping was excellent, and I am considering making my next REAL apple pie open with this crumb topping instead of closed. A guest who ate it at a gat together said it was better than his grandma's.  I consider that to be a very high compliment.

I just made this for my family for the first time and everyone loved it! I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side. This is definitely a keeper.

If you are expecting apple pie, this is not it.  It is not bad - just not what I was expecting or hoping for - I will look for another recipe to try next time.

This has been a big hit this fall. Easy to make and works great in a deep dish baking stone.

This was my first time baking an apple pie and it did not need a crust!  Two apples were cut up before I remembered that the suggestion was to peel them, so I peeled the rest.  The pie turned out delicious! I set a timer and let the pie cool down for 30 minutes before serving.  It was still warm and we topped each slice off with a scoop (or two) of vanilla ice cream.  This was a real easy recipe; I've seen apple pies made before and so glad this one was my first!  It's already in my recipe box!
