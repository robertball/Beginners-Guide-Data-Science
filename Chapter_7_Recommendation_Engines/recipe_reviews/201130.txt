I baked both the squash and the sweet potatoes. I think it's healthier, and it's much simpler to get them out of their jackets when they're cooked. I put the squash in at 350 for 30 minutes then added the potatoes for another 30 minutes. The result was delicious, and sweet enough that I didn't add any sweetener. I would definitely make it again using the same method.

Just made this tonight, and it was great! Very easy too. I added some butter, salt and pepper to the ingredients. I did a google search on how to skin a butternut squash. I highly recommend doing that if you don't know the secret.

Yummy! I baked the squash in the oven, rather than boiling it. I thought it may retain more vitamins this way. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious. Next time, I may add a little bit of butter, and make a breadcrumb topping for it and bake it. I'm thinking that it will be similar to the sweet potato bake that i love from boston market restaurant.

delicious!  I did add a little bit of butter and salt when I mixed in the syrup and spices.  This is a great comfort food for me.  I've made mashed sweet potatoes before, but found them to be a little thick and starchy.  The butternut squash lightens it up and makes it a little more fluffy.  I'll definitely make it again.

I cooked butternut squash for the first time! I had no idea what to do with it but this recipe gave me lots of direction. Thanks to everyone for their ideas.

Made as directed, and hate to say it, but I was disappointed. I love all the ingredients in this, but it tasted watery and bland. I had a helping, but even the baby wouldn't eat more than one bite....

This tastes just like pumpkin pie! I used a half of a large butternut squash to three medium large sweet potatoes. Also, I thought it could cook until tender (less than 20 minutes). Thanks for the great recipe!!

Yum. I used half of a large squash and 2 small potatoes. For syrup I used half ED Smith sugar free syrup and half regular pancake syrup.  Doesn't need butter, already very moist. Definitely better with salt.

Very good!  I added 1-2 T of butter with some splenda brown sugar blend.  I did not have any syrup so I used 1 T. of dark molasses.  Really good!

Everyone loved it!  It's better with some salt though--more of a side dish than a dessert that way.

Great recipe!  Tasted and smelled delicious.  It did turn out a little watery, but that could have been my fault?  Will for sure make this one again.

YUM!  Great for kids especially.  I added a couple tablespoons of butter and some salt and pepper to make these more like traditional mashed potatoes.  The addition of the squash made these light and fluffy.

I had never cooked with butternut squash before.  We love sweet potatoes and thought we'd like to try this recipe.  I'm so glad we did.  It was a very pleasant surprise.  I even enjoy this recipe cold!

Wow!! loved this healthy recipe and even better, my 3 year old and 1 year old loved it too.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  However, I boiled the potatoes and sliced the squash into easier more manageable pieces for skinning.  Once cooled, I peeled the squash.  Adds a little more time to prep, but saves the fingers while peeling skin off raw butternut squash.  Will be a part of weekly meals for sure !!! Thankss for the great recipe.

I was looking forward to eating this after I made it.  I baked the squash and sweet potato as some had said.  I mashed them together and added the nutmeg, cinnamon and maple syrup.  It was blah.  So I added a bit more maple syrup and brown sugar.  Still blah.  I just noticed some people added salt and butter.  Maybe I should have tried that.

Like Linda, I baked both the squash and sweet potato and hand mashed.  I also used Vermont maple syrup because it's all I had (rather than sugar free syrup) and the taste was really good.  Very close to the taste of pumpkin or sweet potato pie but without all the sugar/butter.  My husband and my kids (age 3 and 11 months) enjoyed it as well. Highly recommend.

This tasted wonderful and went over very well at a work potluck. To add a bit more taste, I put in a 1/4 cup sugar free syrup and 1/8 cup real maple syrup. I also put in a bit of salt before mashing it all together.
