Great simple recipe. I had to substitute peanut butter for almond butter because I didnâ€™t have almond butter. I love that it is quick and easy. I sprinkled monk fruit sweetener on top for a little sweetness.  Will definitely make again!

I purchased a silicone candy tray from Michael's and made these delights yesterday. (see in photos)
Slight modification: Added Splenda Naturals (stevia/erythritol blend) and Pink Himalayan Pink salt on top of each. 
Perfect treat any time of the day! Next time I will add vanilla extract. The only thing I would like to find out is what I can use other than "corn syrup" to make these shiny.
