I skipped the ice and used frozen raspberries and a frozen banana. I also used vanilla greek yogurt. One of the best smoothies I have ever had--my kids absolutely second this.

Wonderful smoothie! And, it's great for breakfast or anytime you want a cold refreshing treat bursting with fresh fruit flavor.  I opted to freeze my fruit and use fat free greek vanilla yogurt and a few ice cubes. Overall, very tasty!  Thanks for a great recipe lutzflcat!

If you like raspberries, this smoothie delivers great flavour.  I left out the honey and used frozen fruit and didn't need ice cubes… I could have this every day.  Excellent!

Awesome! Very raspberry-y.
I left out the honey because I like the tartness.

Simple but one of the most delicious smoothies I have made. I replaced the yogurt with strawberry yogurt as that is all I had and left out the honey as strawberry yogurt had more sugar in it  than the suggested vanilla. The hint of strawberry made it that much better. It is one of my favorites!

This is so good especially on a hot day!! I usually use frozen raspberries because they are more tart, but that's what I prefer!! 5 stars, delicious.

Delicious!  I used frozen raspberries and a frozen banana, so because of that, I cut down on the ice cubes.  I had vanilla Greek yogurt on hand and it worked great in this recipe.  Thanks lutzflcat for this recipe.  It makes a very good breakfast to take "on the road".

This is the best smoothie I have ever had. It was kind of thick and hard to blend but this was great. I should start making this every day!

Absolutely great, tasty and refreshing!!!
Just used frozen rasberries instead of ice cubes, dropped the honey and added a bit of water... I also used a slightly sweet yogurt.

Used frozen fruit instead of ice. Husband loved it. His favorite I've made so far, I thought it was interesting tasting. Not your typical smoothie.

No ice only  because I was rushed, but would have been better. I might add a little more yogurt or possibly milk of some kind to make it a bit thicker, otherwise delicious!
