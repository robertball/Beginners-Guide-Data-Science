Family loved it. I posted up a photo as well. But I did one thing different.

Instead of making a Cherry cake, I made a Strawberry cake. I know that goes against the whole point of the cake but I was willing to try out the exact same ingredients but replacing the amount of Cherries with the exact same amount of Strawberries. And it came out just as fine. Actually it came out great. Everyone in the house loved it and I am willing to make it again.

Excellent recipe!   I did make some minor changes by using butter instead of shortening, pecans instead of walnuts, and omitted the food coloring.  My husband couldn't stop eating it.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good.  I baked the cake in 8-inch pan (3 inches deep) and it turned out not very tall, so I suspect that it would have made a VERY flat 9-inch square cake.  I wish the recipe specified the weight of cherries rather than the volume.  I used an entire 16-oz package of frozen cherries, which measured one and a half cups after halving and thawing; seems like a lot of cherries since that package of frozen cherries measures almost three cups when frozen.  I might make this again.

this recipe is awesome and was a big hit with my family. i couldn't find the size pan it called for, so i made it into cupcakes and they turned out perfectly.

the only changes i made to the recipe were i used butter rather than shortening and i didn't add the walnuts or the red food colouring to the sauce.

i think this will become a new standard recipe in our family.

This cake recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I used Door County, WI, sour cherries, from frozen. It turned out perfect - with a moist, somewhat dense texture that shouts 'NOT CAKE MIX!' I made a cream cheese cherry frosting using the reserved juice, rather than the cherry sauce. Delish! Going in my permanent file.

This cake was a really yummy way to use our fresh sour cherries. I did add some extra sugar to the cherries. Next time I will also chop/blend the cherries for the kids.

I liked this a lot.  It's like a cherry muffin if you don't use the sauce but I like to put the sauce on and let it sit for about 10 mins to soak in and then eat it.  Soo good.

I made this twice, once for coworkers and once at home. I thought the cake itself tasted like baking powder and wasn't very exciting. There was nothing wrong with it but it wasn't very good either. Probably won't make thisagain, sorry.

Fabulous cake!  I made it one afternoon and by nighttime it was gone!  The cake without the sauce is great for snacking as well.  I'm about to make it again and add chocolate chips for something fun.  Thanks Brenda!

Absolutely delicious!  I substituted shaved chocolate for the nuts and served it warm.  Next time I think I'll add some chocolate whipped cream as well.  A cake of decadent contrasts!

This was amazing. I was a little doubtful while making it, but everybody loved it and my dad ate most of it. Everyone's asking me to make it again!

Good dough, but it was too heavy and I felt like the taste of the cherries was too hidden.

Good. I added frozen sweet cherries, which I chopped, bc that is what I had. I used cup cake papers and a muffin tin. No icing.
