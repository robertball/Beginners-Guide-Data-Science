I own a bar and do a lot of hor d'oeures.  One of my workers told me about using grape jelly and chili sause for sweet and sour meatballs and I thought she was crazy.
I found this recipe on this site and tried it.  However, I left out the sour cream and added red pepper flakes for a bit of kick.
They were incredible, a real hit.

I've made this for years..without the sour cream. The kids, especially, love them. Make small meatballs for buffets. I'm adding the red pepper flakes this time as suggested by someone else to see how it goes.

I served these meatballs at a holiday party and was skeptical about mixing hot sauce and grape jelly together, but it turned out fantastic.  I tripled the recipe and they were all gone within 2 hours.  Thank you for this recipe!

Found this to be just okay.  The sauce was very rich, but seemed to be lacking something.  I may try this again without adding the sour cream.  Served on white rice.

I make this with Salsa vs. chili sauce.  The onions and peppers give it an extra kick.  The family loves it!

I made this years ago, but lost the recipe. My recipe did not call for sour cream, other than that, the ingredients are the same. I use Bennett’s Chili sauce., which can be found in most grocery stores by the ketchup. It’s tangy, not hot. A few red pepper flakes add some spice if needed. I serve the meatballs in a crock pot. Guests use toothpicks to spear them on their plates. They always went over well as an appetizer.
