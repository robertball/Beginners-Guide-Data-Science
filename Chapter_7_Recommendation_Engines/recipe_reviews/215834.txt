This one is good.   I've made honey liqueur like this, using brandy vs rye, and this tastes a lot like mead (honey wine). Brandy would also go nicely with the maple syrup.  Warm the maple syrup a bit and it will mix in quicker.

Wow. For so simple, this is really good. I'm betting aging will make it even better! I used Jack Daniel's because I'm broke :)

This turned out great!  I needed Maple Liqueur for a cake recipe and could not find any locally, so decided to make my own!  Changes I made:

- Used Drunken Sailor Spiced Rum.
- Warmed Maple Syrup before mixing with Rum.
- Added 1 cup Heavy Cream.
- Aged in refrigerator for 2 weeks.

Leftovers were consumed as shots and were delicious!

This was very good and similar to my favorite maple whiskey that is only available in Canada.  I will make this again for sure.
