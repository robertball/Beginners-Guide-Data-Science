I LOVE this. I always use it inside taco's though. I double/ triple the recipe and make it in a large casserole dish - *skip the biscuit bottom* - and when it's ready out of the oven spoon it into taco shells or eat with nacho chips. A huge hit every time. I always cook the meat with some extra beef stock powder (OXO of whatever) to add extra flavour. Sometimes I will add a bit of cayenne if I want some extra spice to it, or use taco seasoning instead of the chili powder and I always skip the green pepper. Using FRESH tomatoes is a must and I dice them instead of slice. YUM.

A good idea for sure!  I used the seasonings as stated with a little bit of cayenne to kick up the heat.  I substituted hot green chiles for the green pepper. Topped that off with a little green chile salsa b/c I didn't have any tomatoes.  I loved the idea of the biscuit mix for the "taco shell."  I'm sure I'll be experimenting with this again soon!

This was a good base recipe to follow.  Glad for the idea!  I used taco seasoning, reduced the mayo and cut out the peppers/tomato for my family, but I topped mine with salsa.  It was quite yummy, served with corn=)

These are really quick and easy to make. The flavor though can be a little bland with the biscuit bottom.

This is an AWESOME dish! Very Hearty!!  I tweeked it a bit cuz I did not have all the ingredients.I used taco season instead of individual spices & replaced ricotta cheese for Sour Cream. I added a layer of shredded cheddar before the mayo mixture , and added 2 minutes broil time after baking. This is definately a keeper!!
I'll be serving this dish at my next  dinner party !!

A good change of pace from just plain tacos, but it seemed to be missing something...the zip, the zest, the something wasn't there.  The recipe itselft was good, but a do again would require more seasoning or flavoring or something.

Very easy and tasty! I used taco seasoning (as someone else suggested), but other than that kept it the same. The "sauce" on top made the meal. I found the portions to be a bit small, but I was eyeballing so that could have been my fault! Nice change to plain ol' tacos; and not as messy either!

Awesome idea. I made tacos earlier this week and had some left over meat I wanted to use before it went bad. This recipe provided the perfect twist using basically the same ingredients needed for tacos. I didn't have biscuit mix, so I used Pillsbury crescent rolls instead. They were delicious, thanks!

Thought this was easy and fast.  Had a great flavor.  I omitted the Tomatoes and peppers because I didn't have any on hand.  Will defiantly make this again.
