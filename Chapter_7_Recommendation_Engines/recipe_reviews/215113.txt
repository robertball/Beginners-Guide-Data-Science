This was my first attempt at any sort of salsa and I am REALLY pleased with how it came out. It's an amazing blend of sweet and spicy. I added a second Habanero pepper and a little bit more cilantro and pineapple and it was a MAJOR success!

My tree had an over abundance of apricots this year.  I have a party to go to and thought this sounded tasty so I doubled the recipe.  My husband couldn't get over the flavor and even later came in and said what a great taste it left in his mouth.  I make lots of salsas and let's just say, half of the salsa I made for the party is staying home, I am not sharing.  Can't wait to try on a pork tenderloin tomorrow for dinner.

Excellent! Pairs extremely well with the "Marinated Pork Tenderloin" recipe on this site.

This was a refreshing change, but I have to say make sure your apricots are not too ripe or the salsa will become too mooshy/saucy. Also it tends to discolor a tiny bit overnight. I ended up increasing the pineapple and adding some chopped fresh jalapeno instead of habanero. The rest of the ingredients I added to taste.

Pretty good! I had gotten a bunch of apricots in a food share and wanted to use them. Not really an apricot fan, but gave this a shot and I am glad I did! Easy to make, and Iâ€™m thinking it will be better after sitting overnight. All real food. Served over chicken for dinner tonight, and may use as an actual salsa with chips at lunch tomorrow. Thanks for a nice fresh recipe!
