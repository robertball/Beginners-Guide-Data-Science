I made this and I believe that there was too much butter. Was it perhaps supposed to be 1 and 1/2 STICKS butter instead of cups?

Absolutely! Cut the butter to 1.5 STICKS...had to ladle off 3/4 C while baking....still was VERY buttery but chewy crust like we like, very good.

Following recipe, result was drowning in butter. The pastry was wonderfully simple but reminded me of raw homemade noodles. On the positive side, I was able to use some peaches that were not flavorful enough to eat uncooked.

Even 1-1/2 sticks was too much.  I did not care for this at all.  0 stars for me.  Sorry.

WAY too much butter - thanks to the other reviewers for the heads up.   1 1/2 STICKS of butter is more than enough and you could probably use just 1 stick of butter.
