We tried this while camping over the weekend.  I don't like to substitute the first time I make a recipe, but I looked at THREE different stores for hot chile paste and had no luck.  I substituted  hot thai chili sauce, so I don't now how much that altered the recipe. I did everything else exactly as instructed and we LOVED the results.  

When I told hubby what I was making I could see the look of doubt on his face -- "wrapped in lettuce leaves???" But I lost count of how may he ate and he has already requested that I make it when we go camping again Labor Day Weekend.  I served this with Far East brand Ginger Sesame Rice which was a great accompaniment -- we'd add a little to  our lettuce bundle before wrapping and eating.  YUMMY! 

I'm not sure whether to keep searching for the chile paste or stick with the chile sauce.  Either way THANKS for the great recipe and a nice addition to our camping trip menu!

Would not make again. There are many other Korean recipies on here that are much better.  Try the Korean BBQ chicken.  My family liked the marinade better and beef and chicken.

I marinated steak bites for 48hrs and used the remaining sauce over the meat and brown rice (no lettuce leaves - I was worried we'd make a complete mess since the sauce was so runny).  Really good flavor though.  I also had to use regular white wine since I didn't have rice wine.

This was really good, but I think it would make a better stir-fry than grilled dish.  Also, I would use more chili paste next time to give it more kick.

One of my family's all-time favorites!!  My daughter asks me to makes this all the time.  Just the smell of the marinade starts everyone drooling.  Thanks!

This smelled wonderful as it cooked on the grill & tasted pretty good too. I used green leaf lettuce instead of bibb & leeks instead of scallions. served with soba noodles.

Very tasty -- even my kids ate it up.  Wrapped in bibb lettuce, it is fairly healthy and the sauce is delicious. I didn't have hot chile paste so I just left it out and it was still wonderful.  Rainy day -- I cut the sirloin thinly, marinated then broiled it in the oven.

While it may not be the most authentic Korean dish (my Korean mother-in-law would chuckle), I'm not sure how some of the people on here get off saying it would be better stir-fried versus grilled. If you stir-fry it, it's a completely different dish. Just based on food chemistry alone, it would be different. As for finding the pepper paste, look for this Sunchang Gochujang. It's a very good and popular gochujang. Most Asian markets will lean to one ethnicity over others while serving the broader Asian population of their market.

This was in the Baltimore Sun about 10 years ago.  Since that time, friends and I have made it when we get together, as it is so easy and we all LOVE it.  (even the Korean friend whose dad is an amazing cook)  I was always losing my copies, electronic and paper, so it's nice to know I have it saved here.  I have made it without the chile paste for the kids, and it is still good that way.

This was a very good recipe! I think that next time I use it i will use reduced sodium soy sauce, also I would cut the meat smaller for more grilled flavor.

Very tasty recipe and easy to prepare.  Not sure how authentic it is, but delicious regardless.  4 stars instead of 5 because I felt the depth of flavor just wasn't there.

I made it according to the recipe, I found the sauce was far too thin to eat on lettuce.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I thinly slice it, then put it in a grill basket and put hickory chips in the smoking basket and it is wonderful. I  think it gets more smoke and marinade flavor when you slice it before you grill it.  We can't get enough of it.

We modified this recipe a bit.  I put all of it except the onion and lettuce in the slow cooker on low for several hours along with some chopped up ginger.  Then shredded the meat and put it back in with the liquid.  We made this into tacos with a slaw of cabbage, the green onion, radishes, cilantro, plain Greek yogurt, and lemon juice.

I marinated the meat for about 36 hours. The first day, I wasn't a fan of the flavor. It didn't taste authentic I thought. The next day, it tasted really good.  Not sure why but the flavor kind of mellowed and evened out. Still not what I've had at Korean BBQ restaurants, but good.
