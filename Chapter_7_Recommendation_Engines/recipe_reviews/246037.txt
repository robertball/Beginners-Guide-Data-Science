I'm impressed with this recipe. I love Brussels sprouts and I love pakora, so I gave it a try.  I used fresh sprouts, and mine were so tiny that I didn't bother to cut them at all.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn the sprout haters into lovers, but those of us who already adore them really enjoyed the recipe.

Very good. Makes lots. Used leftover batter on a fresh yellow pepper and fried. We will enjoy this again.
