These were delicious! However, I would have liked the parsnip flavor to be more prominent.

I used almond milk instead of the broth and omitted the green onions, used a potato masher and hand mixer instead of food processor. This is pretty tasty, my husband loved it, I liked it, but I think parsnips might be a bit too horseradishy for me (I've never had them before). But overall a yummy and easy recipe!
