This recipe is almost identical to something my mother in law has been preparing for years, and it was as big of a hit at my party!  Even people who normally don't like shrimp enjoyed it!  Hint: make double the quantity because the first serving disappears fast!

This is good with taco chips. I used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. I think the next time I make it I will try adding a little red pepper or old bay seasoning to the cream cheese mixture to spice it up a little.

This is a fabulous dip with either crackers or tortilla chips.
I make it for almost any occasion and it is the first dip to go! 5 stars

Great to share with assorted crackers.  I use shrimp from a pre-frozen shrimp ring.
