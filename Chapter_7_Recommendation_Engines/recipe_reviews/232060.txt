This is a staple in our house. I add a little dry chicken base and unsalted butter to the oil and garlic. Adjust your salt. Make sure you squeeze all the water out of your escarole (very important).I'm a garlic freak so I use a lot more. If you like hot peppers try roasting some Hungarian hots and put on top of greens. Serve with crusty bread.

Liked this very much.  Didn't have escarole so I used Kale and cooked longer.  Added a little "Better than boillion" non chicken flavor for a little extra taste.

Loved this! I used spinach instead of escarole because, depending on the season, sometimes I find escarole to be a little bitter. Also, instead of water, I cooked the spinach in chicken broth. I would absolutely make this again!

I love greens and beans!  This is also a staple in my house.  I want to offer an alternate method that only uses one large skillet and no pre-blanching.  At my supermarket you can buy bags of cleaned and chopped escarole - I start there.  In a large nonstick skillet add 3 TBLSs olive oil, and 5 cloves rough chopped garlic.  when the garlic is fragrant add escarole and toss with tongs for 3 minutes or so to cover each piece with  with garlic oil.   Add I can drained cannelinni, 2-3 cups chicken broth,   hot pepper flakes, oregano, and bring to a rapid boil over high heat.  Cook to reduce for 10 -15 minutes.  Turn off heat and sprinkle  liberally with fresh grated parm. cover and let stand  for a few minutes.  the 'sauce' is cheesy and and great for crusty-bread dipping.  we usually have this with spicy grilled chicken sausage.  Easy, fast, economical, healthy, and delicious.

I found this just ok. I like all the ingredients and there wasn't anything wrong with it, just didn't thrill me. I added a little white wine for extra flavour. I think I will use the leftovers in chicken broth and small pasta for a quick soup.

This is SO good! I did make a change- I used arugula because I always have it and that eliminated the need for boiling the greens. (when I added the greens I also threw in some shredded leftover rotisserie chicken and turned it from a side dish into a complete meal) Will definitely be making this more.

Absolutely love it.  Use a good (or flavored) olive oil.  Wonderful with fish.

Stumbled upon this and will only add that I had some leftover collard greens (cooked with sauteed onions--a lot of onions--and garlic w. a bit of pepper flakes); and I added the RINSED can of white beans as recommended and re-heated on the stove top. Very good!

First time making greens and beansâ€”turned out great! I added turkey sausage and angel hair to make into more of an entree. Would definitely make this again.

Add some fresh lemon juice  and maybe some parsley at the end then this is a 5 star dish.

A quick and easy side dish.  I sauteed  the greens in virgin olive oil  instead of boiling them and used mixed greens because I didn't have escarole on hand. This recipe will work with most any greens.

I was trying to duplicate a recipe we had at a little Italian restaurant, so I added sausage to it, to make it a main dish.  Boy was that great!  Yummy recipe, thank you!

This was so easy to make.  I used kale in place of escarole and it was so good.
