Buckwheat and avocado make a great flavor combination.  There is no need to rinse the buckwheat after cooking (you just pour those vitamins and minerals down the drain)!  Thanks for the recipe idea!

This is a terrific recipe. I grew up in a country where buckwheat was popular and I did not enjoy it that much. However, in this recipe avocado  complements it very well, while lime and red onion add a nice blend of flavor and color. My wife served this salad with fried chicken liver and we liked it a lot.

Pretty good, though next time I’ll skip cayenne or add just a pinch (because I don’t like spicy food), and maybe a bit less lime juice and more avocado. One of my kids didn’t care too much for goat cheese, but I liked it. I might try it with a different cheese too.
