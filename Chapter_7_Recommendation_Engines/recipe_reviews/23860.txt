Soak peas over night in water; when done discard water. This step gets rid of all the gas in the peas and easier to digest plus less flatulence. Follow soup directions.

This was easy and good, and just the right thickness.  I used all green split peas, and didn't have any salt-free seasoning (such as Mrs. Dash) on hand, so I just used about 2 t. curry powder and 1/4 t. black pepper for seasoning.  I like a little texture in my pea soup, so I only pureed about 3 c. of the soup in the blender, then added it back to the pot.  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmmm... best ever indeed. It came out yummy. I did not puree the soup at the end because I liked the chunkiness. Also, it looked ready after only an hour, and the peas were all soft, so I took it off the heat. Recommended!

This soup was wonderful.  I had never had split pea soup that did not call for ham so I was concerned that it would not have enough flavor.  I was quite surprised.  I just put all the ingredients in a crockpot except for the oil and the salt free seasoning blend (I didn't have any).  I only used green peas and I doubled the recipe except for the water.  I used 12 cups of water instead of 16.  I also used Wyler's Shakers boullion that is chicken garlic and herb flavor.  Then I slow-cooked it for 6 hours.  It came out great.

A solid easy to make puree of split pea soup. Suggest adding potatoe and a 1/4 tsp of curry powder.

This recipe was amazing!  I have been a vegetarian for years and have been afraid of trying split pea recipes without ham.  However, this recipe was so savory, with just a few changes.  Along with all the vegetables I added 2 cups of diced potatoes, also replaced chicken broth with vegetable broth.  Also, I did not have a seasoning blend, so added 1Tbsp of curry powder, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp ground thyme, 1tsp parsley flakes and 2Tbsp soy sauce.  After simmering for 2-1/2 hrs as suggested, the flavors were perfectly melded and I blended 1/2 the soup and left the remainder chunky.  Absolutely yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is truly the Best Split Pea Soup Ever. This recipe is so good that I became an allrecipe member today. I made two substitutions to the soup. I used 1 cup of lentils for the green split peas, so my soup was 50% yellow split peas and 50% lentils. I also added Country Ham cubes. For my seasoning I used Ms. Dash Table Blend. The Soup turned out Great!

Note: Since the split pea breaks down when cooking I do not recommend pureeing the soup but that is just a preference.

This is a great and easy recipe, the whole family loves it and when I ran out of chicken broth one time I used beef broth instead it was a great alternate.

The soup is delicious. After only one hour I added a cup of diced ham and simmered another 15 minutes. I found that 75 minutes of simmering is plenty instead of the 2 1/2 hours stated. I too used an immersion blender (so much easier to blend right in the pot). I've made this twice now. When I told my husband I was going to make this (for the second time) he said "Like the last time? Cooool! Mmmmmmm!" Don't for get the crusty bread to go with it.

Great recipe even though I had to tweak; I left out the celery and didn't use the seasoning blend-in fact salt and pepper was just enough. I also used vegi broth instead of chicken. The reason why I gave it a 4 would be because I found that 8 cups was too much--it cooked for the 2/12 hours but seems a bit watery. I'll defintitely follow this recipe again because the taste is there but cut the broth by a cup or maybe 2. I also threw it in my magic bullet and pureed it--nice!! Thank you!

A basic split pea soup that is long on flavor. Simple to make. Added 1 tsp. of fresh rosemary and 5-7 bay leaves for a slight flavor boost. Recipe can be easily modified for individual taste preferences, including adding ham if so inclined. Followed directions other than simmer time reduced to about 1-3/4 hrs. If you like a chunky split pea soup, reserve some carrots, celery, and possibly split peas instead of running everything through a blender or food processor. Give this a try!!

My whole family, including my 2 and 1 year olds, love this! They get grilled cheese sandwiches to dip in it, and hubby and I get homemade french bread. Yum! The only change I make is to use all yellow split peas and I add one sweet potato. This will be a winter staple in our house.

Excellent! I pureed half of the soup and used green split peas only (because that's all I had). However, I used low-sodium chicken broth along with the amount of salt that the recipe called for and it was too salty. Next time I will cut the salt in half.

Good recipe.  I was looking for a vegetarian split pea soup.  I used vegetable broth and had no need to puree the soup as it was nice and thick already.

This is so simple, yet so good. I just used a one-pound bag of dry green split peas. I also added two bay leaves, which I removed before pureeing with my immersion blender. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. This can be made as smooth or as chunky as desired. I froze half the recipe for later. Next time, I will have to try adding curry as another reviewer suggested. This is a good recipe for the beginning cook as well, so will be letting my stepdaughter make it too. I think she will be so proud of the results!

Instead of chicken broth, I substituted Knorr's chicken bouillon and did not add additional salt.  I used the slowcooker after cooking the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 2.5 hours and because I didn't want to puree the entire, I used a potato masher to smash the split peas, which left most of the carrots and celery in tack.  This was a very delicious soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I made this in my crockpot @ work..in fact..I still smell it simmering away :D  The only changes I made was I added 2 cans of chicken stock (4 cups) and a can of water (2 cups).  I dumped 2 cups of green split peas in along w/ the broth.  I didn't measure the veggies.  I used 1 small onion minced, 3 med. carrots, finely chopped, and 3 stalks celery finely chopped.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic, and the Salt-Free seasoning blend. (oh yeah, and salt. lol)I added 3 strips of bacon, diced and I simmered for 6 hours on low, then used an immersion blender to mix it up a little.   It came out so yummy!  I'm planning on serving this w/ croutons or crusty bread.  Thanks!

Excellent! To speed it up, I start cooking the peas, while chopping the other ingredients. Cook time is onoy about an hour or so till correct consistency. I also add cut up ham steak. This gets rave reviews from pals at work.

This truly was the best ever split pea soup. I didn't use celery and put a little turmeric in instead of the seasoning blend. I also didn't need to puree any of it because it came out perfect without it. :)

I made this for my husband who loves split pea soup. the only changes I made was taking another's reviewer's suggestion and  instead of the salt free blend, used the blend of rosemary,thyme cumin, garlic powder, and curry powder and only cooked  it 75 mins. My Husband who is picky loved it and asked me to make it again and  although I thought I didn't like split pea soup am a fan now as well. Thanks for the good recipe!!

The right consistency, but I didn't blend it.  I cooked it for an hour and 15min and that was enough.  The peas broke down and I left the carrots chopped for some texture.  I think it needed some more seasoning, but it was pretty good as is.

This is the Best Ever Split Pea Soup I have ever eaten.  I am not a fan of ham so this recipe called me to try it.  Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Filling, Delicious & will make many times again.

True to it's name: BEST EVER! I cooked this in a crock pot and used a stick blender to puree before serving. Turned out great!

Fabulous.  I hate peas and I loved this soup.  Even my husband, notorious for asking me if there's "more" after we finish eating, felt full with just one bowl of this meatless soup.  Amazing.  Tonight I'm making it with diluted ham drippings instead of chicken broth...already smells delicious!  Note: I thought it was better when pureed.  Also, I think a few more carrots would be delightful too in order to dress up the color from "pea" to "pretty".

Very good and very easy. I made it with veggie broth and omitted celery (blech). I used Italian seasoning and an equal amount of curry powder too.

Very delicious pea soup. I like how it is pork-free! I used swanson's fat free, low sodium chicken broth. Since i dont have a seasoning blend, i added some black pepper and garlic. I would suggest adding only 1/2 teaspoon of salt or none until you finish cooking since it is already salty if you're using store-bought canned broth. Season to taste in your own bowl or when you're ready to serve. For color, I used only green peas and added a dash of cayenne, which also adds a nice kick. My family has split pea soup (erwtensoep in dutch) around christmas, it's a family tradition, and i love how easy this recipe is!

EXCELLENT  Used 4 cans of low sodium ck broth.  Scored 3 small smoked pork hocks.  
Also threw in 3 large bay leaves. Simmered 2 1/2 hrs.  when finished, I put about 3 cups of soup in a bowl and blended with my immersion blended.  returmed soup to pot and it was so thick the next day that I had to add another can of broth.  Will definately make again. P.S. Hardly any meat on the hocks so I added 2 cups chopped baked ham.  Had some leftover in fridge.I make this often and don't use the blender any more.  If I think it needs to thicken up a little I just add instant potato flakes.  Works like a charm.

I am used to pea soup cooked with a ham bone, but this is healthier and not bad at all. I made sure to saute the vegetables thoroughly before adding the remaining ingredients since I didn't want the onion to overpower the flavors. I didn't really see the need to get out the blender and puree any of the soup, so I left it as it was. Very good.

Followed someone's suggestion to use curry powder and pepper instead of the salt-free seasoning. Did not purée as I liked the consistency once it was cooked. Loved it!

This was so easy, and it came out absolutely delicious! I didn't puree it since I don't have an immersion or regular blender, but it thickened up nicely while cooking. I soaked the peas for about 6 hours before beginning. I cut back a bit on stock - 4 cups chicken stock plus 1.5 cups of water. I added a few dashes of cayenne pepper for extra heat and added a cut up ham steak. I topped it with shredded cheese (asiago, pecorino, romano) and served with french bread. I will definitely be making this again!

An absolutely delicious soup!! I put everything in a crockpot and cooked it on low all day. I made two small adjustments to the recipe to suit my taste by adding one small ham steak cubed and a generous pinch of hot pepper flakes. I may have used more liquid than called for as well. I put in two large tetra boxes of chicken stock and then filled the slow cooker to about 3/4 full with water. It turned out just right. Because I added the ham cubes, I did not blend the soup but I used a potato masher to smooth it out a bit. I will definately make this again.

Excellent recipe! Super easy, relatively cheap, and delicious. The serving size is listed as 8 (which amounts to about 1 cup per serving) so if you're going to be using this as a main dish, make a double batch!   A really great way to kick it up as a left over is to add a dollop of sour cream, some chopped tomatoes, and lots of pepper. Yumm.

Very good! I didn't have leaks (used a little celery) or bay leaves, but was still very good. Could have lost the rosemary. I only used three strips of bacon, but still very tasty... though I'm sure even better with 6. I also used some yellow split peas too.

I loved this recipe. Its hearty and flavourful! I didn't have celery or green split peas so I doubled the amt of yellow ones I added.  I also chose to try some without putting it through the processor - I like my food to have a lot of texture - and it was great that way too. But if you are cooking for two servings or less I should warn you to watch the time it can take as little as 45 minutes to cook.

Usually I like to add a little meat to split pea soup but this one doesn't need it. I've made it as submitted and its very good. Also, one time I was short on chicken broth but I had a can of Trader Joe's onion soup in the cupboard. That was very good also.

I am only giving this a 4 stars because it really isn't the BEST EVER split pea soup in my book. But it may be the best without ham or bacon or some other kind of meat. I reduced the recipe down to two servings and didn't need the full cook time. I added so many different spices I just can not recall. I used two packets of NO-sodium broth. with two cups of water. I added frozen broccoli and cauliflower in place of the cellary, as I did not have any and added a lot of cellary seed as well. All was good and served its purpose. Would make again! Thank you. Oh, and mine was not soupy like in the picture. It was exactly the consistancy split pea soup should be.

WONDERFUL!  I am so glad that I found a great tasting split pea soup recipe!!  We just made a huge pot of it and will be freezing some and canning the rest.  The only changes: all green peas instead of half yellow (the green peas were cheapest), 3 t of salt and 1/4 t black pepper.  We also used chicken stock from a chicken I stewed last night, so it wasn't fat free, but I do skim the fat off the top before I use it, so it's fairly lean.  Didn't have to puree it to get it to be creamy - we left it on the stove long enough that almost all the peas cooked down well.  Thank you - my two year old LOVED it for lunch, and what a money saver - around $4 for at least 16 servings in my opinion (it's so thick, we eat about two ladle fulls a piece and are full) - it's way cheaper than buying it canned, especially if you buy all organic like we do!

I've tried many recipes for split pea soup, but this one is by far the best.  Loved it.

This was outstanding, although I did change the recipe to suit my tastes and what was available in my pantry.  I used only yellow split peas, and included some diced potato instead of celery as I'm accustomed to potato in split pea soup.  I also did not use any of the seasoning blend, but instead just added some salt and relied on the vegetables and garlic to flavour the soup. I also did not puree the soup, as I didn't think it necessary. I ended up with a thick, flavourful soup that was a big hit with everyone.  I will definitely be making this again.  Easy to prepare, nutritious, and extremely tasty. This will be great for those cold winter nights!  Thanks.

Very good. I used all green peas and drizzled balsamic vinegar on top just before serving.

absolutely wonderful recipe for split pea.  i add two ham hocks to the recipe as well to give it even more flavor.  i skip the step that calls for it to be put in the food processor because the texture seems fine after 2 1/2 to 3 hours of simmering.  a great recipe for a cold winter day.

have made this twice and it's turned out great both times.  you can be flexible with the ingredients... i never measure the veggies, and last time i only had green and red split peas, which turned out fine.  i also add way more garlic than it calls for, and didn't use fat free broth (didn't have any)  thx for this yummy recipe!

Outstanding! This is now my new "Go To Split Pea Soup Recipe". I doctored the recipe a little (as I do with almost everything I make) by adding a medium potato and using celery seed because I didn't have celrey. I also cut back on the chicken broth to about 6 cups. This, and the potato helped to thicken the soup without having to add flour, which I think tends to bland soups. However, the base recipe was responsible for creating a wonderfully tastey soup that Robin should be proud of!

I was not impressed. The flavor was fine, but it came out nearly as thin as water. Adding flour helped slightly. I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what went wrong.

This was delicious.  I didn't have salt-free seasoning mix, so I took suggestions from other reviewers and used the following:  1/4 tsp each of rosemary, thyme, cumin, garlic powder (not "minced") and celery and 1/2 tsp curry. I didn't use any fresh celery. Also, instead of chicken broth, I used 1 Tbsp chicken flavored broth powder. I will definitely make this again.

You know what?..my first time attempting this kind of soup and I have to say it was awesome!! I followed the recipe exactly except I added a smoked ham hock (I like meat) and simmered it with the soup...Every one in the family loved it including my picky 12 year old who ate 3 bowls after being forced to taste it...This is a definite "make again"

This soup was terrific. I made a couple of changes: used 1 1b. of green split peas instead of mix of both kinds, and also added 5 tablespoons of precooked bacon (the kind you can buy in the bottle from Hormel) for a smoky flavor. I also pureed the soup right in the pot with an immersion blender--very easy.

This is delicious!  I've made this more than once, and it turns out wonderfully each time!  Love the fact that it's so healthy, too.  As a variation, I have added 1/4 tsp liquid smoke to the soup, which gives it a bit of "ham bone" flavor without the extra calories.

I used a total of 7 cups of liquid instead, sauteed 3 strips of turkey bacons before adding all other ingredients.  But with all the vegetables in it, I don't think it needs any bacons for flavoring!  Will definitely make it again! and it freezes very well.

I tried to impress my mom who loves split pea soup when she came to visit. It didn't work. As soon as I tasted it I knew she would be disappointed. I was very careful to follow the recipe EXACTLY as written. I will admit I've never made soup before, but don't know where I could have possibly went wrong. All I know is it did NOT taste like pea soup. She did say to try a little less onion next time and it would be fine, but I think she was being nice.

wow! This recipe is really great in taste and texture. I don't care for ones that have "potato" in them because it makes it really thick. This recipe still has that "thickness" without it being too heavy and yet it's very tasty! I made a few changes that included using leeks instead of onions, added "spike" salt-free seasoning and added a couple of smoked ham hocks while simmering. I pureed the whole thing then added the meat taken off the bones. I also added a cup or two of water(to compensate for the added saltiness of the ham hocks) then reheated the soup. Wonderful! Next time I'll omit the ham hocks and try the soup as is. But in my opinion, spilt pea and some kind of ham is why I love this type of soup!

With all the great reviews, I had to try this out.  My husband complained it tasted like onions. If I make it again I would only use half the onions, and would not puree. (it looked more appealing before pureeing)

wow! this is wonderful and easy split pea soup! i would not puree it next time, though. also, don't worry if it doesn't look like there's enough liquid half-way through. it will get there. i added diced baked ham during the heat-through.

Robin! We are sitting enjoying a bowl at this moment...we just had to write and say THANK YOU for the fantastic recipe. All we can say is that we're shocked that a simple soup such as split pea can be this good. We made it vegan by using artificial chicken broth powder (mixed with water) and since we lacked carrots and non-salt seasoning we did without and it still proved amazing! Blending about half the mixture gave it a perfect consistency. Thanks again!

The thing that amazes me about this soup is its rich flavor achieved without the help of any cream, butter or meat. Great recipe! This is definitely going into my list of favorites.

we like split pea soup & i've made it in the past however this was my first time using yellow peas. they seemed to have a slightly milder flavor. i followed this recipe exactly as written with the lone exception of adding the meat from 2 smoked ham hocks. thank you robin!

I love this recipe. It's just proof that you dont need any ham or other fatty meats. Good for kids, there isn't any "Yucky stuff" to pick out (like meat). The  blender step makes a major difference. If you want some texture, only blend 1/2 or 3/4 of it, then add it back. Yum!

This is the first time I've made split pea soup and my whole family loved it (including the 4 and 7 year olds!)I threw in a ham bone and simmered it the whole time for extra flavor.
Delicious!

This soup was so good Robin.  Hubby has been on a mission to eat healthier and he gave this 2 thumbs up!  I chopped up a medium sized ham steak and added this to the soup along with some dried thyme and crushed dried rosemary.  This gave the soup a little extra flavor and I will make it again this way.  Thanks for posting.

Indeed, this soup is delicious! Easy and relatively quick to make and let sit on the stovetop for a healthy family meal. I will make this again!

I soaked the peas overnight and cooked this in my instant pot. I put the carrots onions garlic and celery in the pot with some bacon grease and put it on sauté for a few mins, stirring often until the onions were translucent. Then I added everything else and put it on pressure cook high for 10 mins. It probably only needed about 6 mins because the peas were mush after 10. I then used my immersion blender to purée the soup. Perfect and fast!

This was an amazingly delicious soup. I did not soak peas overnight. I rinsed them and put everything in the pot at one time. Cooked for approximately 2 hours . I will definitely make this again.

We had never had split pea soup, but were wanting to add more lentils to our diet so I'm glad I found this recipe. 

I stuck to procedure, but I definitely changed a couple ingredients and spiced mine up a bit more. I think it would be too bland without the added spices, but that is just preference. 

First, I used gee instead of the oil to cook onions, etc. 
I added several spoons (not measured exactly) of rosemary and ginger (probably 1 tablespoon). I also used a spiced salt blend. 
In addition, we were out of celery so I did about a 1/2 cup extra of carrot, about 1/2 cup of dried celery & some celery seed. 
I liked it so much that I sent out pictures and now have family members asking which recipe I used and what I added so they can give it a go.  We will definitely make this again.

This soup is fabulous.  I followed the directions except for the non-salt seasoning.  I didn't have any, so I used dried thyme.  The soup disappeared too quickly, so I'm going to be making it again this weekend.

I couldn't find any yellow split pea but, I had a bag of lentil bean so I substituted that for the yellow bean. I also added a 1/4 tsp of pepper. Also I had to let the peas simmer for 4 hours before blending. I was pleasantly surprised. Almost like pea soup but thicker.

Seriously the best. I'm vegan so I use vegetable broth. My kids (ages 9 and 10) and their friends love it so much they ask for it, and get excited when I make it. They lovingly call it "Barf Soup" because of the color and consistency. ??

I have made this a few times. The first time I made it as written, this time I added leftover ham, cut into cubes. It is great both ways! I don't have pre-mixed salt free seasoning, so I added pepper, tumeric, and dried parsley and thyme. I also make it in the pressure cooker, high pressure for 10 minutes, rather than simmering in a traditional pot. Quick and delicious!! I think the large quantity of veggies gives it great depth of flavor.  A keeper recipe.

I had soaked the peas overnight, but it still took a long time to cook...about 2 1/2 hr.
Had only used 6 c veg broth, instead of 8 c.
Maybe, the flavours will blend in better the next day.

Soup came out delicious!  I was looking for Lysanders split peas in a bag with the seasoning packet already in the bag but apparently they are out of production.  I'm soooo glad I found this recipe. It was even better. I did make some additions though. I boiled 4 cups of water with the split peas, removed it from the heat and let it sit for two hours. Then I drained the water out before making the soup.  I made it for the Jewish holidays and wanted to put meat in it. I browned a few short ribs in olive oil before sautéing the vegetables. I also added a chopped potato halfway through the cooking.

Very yummy.  Followed other reviewers and used curry and pepper - well received.  I also liked it not blended.  Next time I will add a little more stock as it was all absorbed leaving a thicker consistency. Will make again for sure!

Made as is, but I added a bay leaf, 1/2 tsp of marjoram, 1/4 tsp of thyme, more garlic, and black pepper. Amazing!!!  Also, sometimes I add a little smoked sausage for the last 30 mins of simmering. Makes it extra amazing!!!

This was simple and really good, I only used green peas and I didn't puree as it thickened up by itself. The amt of liquid listed in the recipe was perfect. I also threw in a ham hock.

I really enjoy this recipe.  I never give 5 star if I alter it though...  I cut the broth by a quarter and replaced that with water to lower the sodium a bit.  For flavor, I added a teaspoon of cumin, a teaspoon of thyme, a bay leaf and 1/4 cup of sherry.  Really loved it!

So delish! Read other reviews, and used 5 cups of broth. Also added cumin, turmeric, and some Worcester sauce. Yuuuummmm!!! It came out incredibly flavourful, Perfect comfort food for winter :)

I grew up eating split pea soup and this recipe is a great start, but for extra flavor we always use a leftover ham bone or smoked turkey leg. My mom used to add cut up pieces of polska kielbasa which she pan fried first. Omit any extra salt if you do this. I also like to add 1/2 tsp of oregano and 1 tsp pepper. Try it this way and you will be coming back for seconds. :)

Delish!! My changes: only green peas, instead of salt-free seasoning (didn't have) I used black pepper, curry and 4 bay leaves. I also did not add additional salt during cooking. I did not puree as I thought it was thick enough.
There was a bit of broth and I liked that the carrots and celery were still mostly intact. Worried I wouldn't like it without ham bone/ham chunks. Needless energy waste. It was very tasty and I will make it again! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a very good basic vegetarian split pea soup.  I really like it and add a little sriracha to my bowl.  My daughter is vegetarian, so I am always on the lookout for something we can all eat so this is a keeper for me.

I used 1/2 cup onion instead of 2 (we don't love onion), simmered a little over an hour and it was ready to blend.  An immersion blender worked great but it was hot!  Probably should have let it cool a bit first.  For salt free seasoning I used equal parts (about 1/3 tsp) tumeric, paprika, sugar, garlic powder and some dried onion. Only complaint is the color is orangish and not green when blended. Tasted great!

OMG this was soooo good. I think i added too much broth so it came out thin (my fault).  Instead of salt free seasoning blend (didnt have) i used cajun seasoning. Put the whole thing in a blender after cooking it for several hours and man o man was it stinkin delish! What i really loved too was that prep work was so easy and took about 10-15 mins

Wow!  I used bacon drippings from breakfast to saute veggies and garlic.  Added a little white wine :) to get all the good stuff from the bottom of pan.  Used Tony Chachere's Salt Free Seasoning (no MSG).  Simmered with a smoked ham hock, two bay leaves and a teaspoon of dried thyme.  Immersion blender worked like a charm to obtain a smooth and silky texture.  My house smells AMAZING!!!  Thank you for an awesome, basic split pea recipe that can be played with, or not!!!

I always make soups from scratch and this one was fantastic.  For those who like a little more excitement, definitely add more spices, like curry powder.  But even the regular taste was a hit with my we-only-eat-grilled-cheese kids!

DH and I loved this soup! Ours was pretty much ready to eat at about the 2 hour mark of simmering since our stove has a higher than we'd like simmer. We didn't even puree any of this soup as it was fantastic just the way it is! Thanks for sharing.

It turned out perfectly, and it didn't even need to be blended to be perfectly creamy. I added a few peices of bacon, which really gave it a great meaty and buttery taste. I also only used carrots and zucchini for veggies, because that's what I had on hand. I halved the recipe, and it was about enough for 3 big bowls.

Not so good.  This soup would not thicken up as is (I followed the directions exactly).  So I put in another half bag of split peas and it turned to cement.  Will continue looking for a suitable Split Pea recipe.  Also, shouldn't a true split pea soup have celery?

I was a little skeptical of this recipe as it did not call for any type of ham/bacon.  However, this soup is very flavorful!  The only change I did was use 4 cups regular chicken broth and 5 cups of fat-free low-sodium chicken broth. I didn't have any Ms.Dash seasoning and just used 1/2 tspn salt.  Also, I didn't puree it.  The consistency of the soup was ideal for us (on the thinner side).  The only complaint I have is the amount of time it took to chop the onions, carrots and celery (gotta get a food processor!).  :)

this was delicious.  We had company over and used it as a side dish.  It was hearty - my friend who is pregnant loved it.  She is grossed out by pork right now so it was nice that it is meatless since a lot of pea soups have ham in them. I didnt have yellow peas so just used all green.  Also I didnt blend anything.  Let it just simmer.  I eyeballed all the ingredients - guessing that it was pretty close to what was listd and it was great.  A little curry was a nice touch.  I simmered the soup for 75 minutes as many reviews said you could shorten the time; but the peas were not fully cooked (barely noticeable).  Next time I would simmer longer.  Very good, and the our friends kept saying how delicious it was. Happy cooking!

This soup is wonderful.  I like to make lots of extra and freeze what we don't eat.  Then when I want some for lunch on a cold winter day...I have some on hand.

Easy to make but low on flavor. Can be improved by serving with cheese and black pepper sprinkled on top, and crusty bread on the side for dipping. Also, would be better with ham thrown it, as a lot of other reviewers suggested. I picked this recipe because I had everything on hand, but next time I think I'd make the trip to the store and try a recipe with more seasoning.

I made this with all green split peas and used 7 cups of vegetable broth instead of 8 (4 14oz. cans) I added the last can after it was done cooking.  It was very good and I can't wait to make it again!

Great recipe! Flavorful, cheap, and filling. I didn't have salt-free seasoning, so I used some cumin and oregano. Cumin tastes GREAT in this soup. I bet different seasonings would be good as well. Yum, this recipe is a keeper!

This is truly the best pea soup I have had.  I finely chopped up the veggies in my little processor and added about a 1/2 tsp of curry powder to give it a little zing.  I used a hand blender to puree it. It turned out beautifully. I am the only on in my home to eat it, but who cares, the more for me :-).

I love split pea soup and this is great! I left out the chicken bouillon and instead, added half of the ham flavoring that came with the green peas. Also, I didn't have any salt-free seasoning, so I added several shakes of curry to the pot and a good dash of cumin to each bowl. I will definitely make this again!

This was decent. I was unsure as to what "salt free seasoning blend" meant, as it was very unspecific. I added parsley, salt and pepper. Don't think I'll try it again though.

very disappointed in this soup considering all the 5 star reviews...not sure what it was, I am a big fan of meatless soups, but it was just okay....

I used half the onions as someone suggested, and made sure they were well sauteed, but it still came out tasting like onion mush...will not be making this one again.

This turned out a little too salty. I used Swansons chicken broth that was regular sodium. It was very good when I tasted it halfway through, but at the end it was too salty. Also I ate half without puree. The second half I pureed...I didn't like the texture and it intensified the saltiness. Also used half onion since I don't like strong onion flavor. I would make this again without the salt.

I made this recipe as a first course with Easter dinner and it was wonderful.  I didn't change a thing and kept the recipe as stated.  I'm so glad to have found a soup with such wonderful texture and taste.  Add a little croutons when it's done and you have one great soup starter.  Thanks Robin!

This was my first time making or eating split pea soup-(split peas were on sale at the store so I thought I would give it a try!) Though it was a bit on the thick side, it has a wonderful flavor.  I added just a bit more water to give it more of a "soupy" texture.  I didn't even bother putting it through the blender, and I added some chopped up leftover ham.  A cheap, filling meal- I will be making it again!

This was so delicious! I rearranged stuff a bit, based on my tastes, such as--I used dried onion instead of fresh, left out the celery and the olive oil, only used 2 whole carrots, cut up, and I cut the chicken broth down to 4 cups. I also used "Emeril's Essence" for the "salt-free seasoning". But I grew up on a basic "water, peas and salt" soup, very blandish, and this turned out tasting better than even canned pea soup! My whole family loved it. This one's a keeper!!

It was very wholesome, healthy good soup. However, silly me cooked it a day in advance for a party the next day and I had a shock when i wanted to rehat it the next day when i found it had became more like a dip than soup. So the advise is never cook ahead for this soup. Always serve immediately.

Yummy!  I didn't have any seasoning blend so I used a little rosemary, thyme, and curry.  My husband thought it was the best he's ever tasted but said it could use chunks of ham.  I thought it was already very tasty w/o it.  It truly is the Best Ever Split Pea soup!

So simple and so so good makes this a perfect recipe.  My husband says it's the best soup he has ever eaten!  Only variation I did was I used veg broth instead of chicken, my split peas were done in 30 mins and used the inversion blender to whir it up a bit. Awesome!!

This was my first time making split pea soup and I couldn't have started with a better recipe.  I did use all green split peas and didn't have any salt-free seasoning so I added a little bit of curry instead as well as a few pieces of canadian bacon.  Very good recipe and I will definitely make it again!

A wonderful soup!  I didn't puree it because it cooked up so nice and thick.  Also, mine was done after only about 1 3/4 hrs. (of course, the extra time simmering just added to the flavor).  Will definitely try it with curry; that sounds great.

I used 99%, instead of fat-free, chicken broth.  I didn't bother to puree this in the blender.  After cooking, it was creamy already; the only pieces left were the carrots which I didn't mind.  I'd suggest adding some more broth or water as needed, when cooking or reheating though.  You may need more salt & pepper as well.  This was a nice recipe as it tasted fine without adding any ham or beef for flavor.

Mine came out a little salty, and not as thick as I would have liked, but it's good nonetheless and really easy to make!  I didn't have celery or the seasoning, but it worked well still.

Dee-licious!!  I used leeks instead of onions, and forgetting to buy celery, added extra leeks plus some green beans.  Simple and very good!
