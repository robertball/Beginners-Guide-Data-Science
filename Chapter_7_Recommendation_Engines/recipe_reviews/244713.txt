This is quite delicious. I used brown miso, not white. I intended to use it as a dressing so added water as written, and added a bit too much. Regardless, it was tangy and biting. Thank you for the recipe.

I added water, double the vinegar, and honey for a perfect salad dressing!

I made a no sodium version.    Used 3 carrots, no miso, doubled the ginger and used double the amount of oil(flax seed). Also had to add about 1/3 cup of water. Came out pretty good. Will likely make again.

I didn't have the miso paste and I'm not sure how that would have changed taste. Since I planned to use it as a dressing then I added a little more rice vinegar and some water. I minced all the vegetables and did some immersing on 2/3 of mixture. I could taste the carrots and sesame oil which I like. Next time I'll try get some miso paste.
