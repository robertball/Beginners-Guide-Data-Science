Really enjoyed this and I'm not even that big a fan of raisins.  I sub'd 1/2 cup of the raisins for 1/2 cup of currants just because I had them on hand.  It makes a wonderfully moist loaf...not really pudding-ish at all.  Will enjoy this especially at breakfast time.  50 mins was spot on as far as baking time for me too. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this without the Brandy. It was WONDERFUL even without it. :) (I "plumped" the Raisins in almost-hot Water for 10 minutes before adding. I think that helped.)
