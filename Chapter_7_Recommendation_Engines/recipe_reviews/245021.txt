Another pound cake to love. I used mini chocolate chips and they sunk anyway. Next time, I'll try dredging the chips in flour as I've heard that keeps the chips from sinking.  I used gluten free all purpose flour and even my gluten eating family loved it. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it exactly by the recipe and it turned out to be very good. I figured out that it would be a big cake, so I used two loaf pans instead of the tube pan, so I could freeze one. It came out perfectly, but it took longer to cook, about 15 minutes more.  I will do it again, when the extra frozen cake is gone! Thanks for sharing!

Original review from when this was a personal recipe 8-25-13 ~ This is a delicious pound cake recipe. I'm not big on chocolate chips in my food with the exception of chocolate chip cookies. Well, I can now add this recipe to the list. There was too much batter for my Bundt® cake pan so I used my angel food cake pan. This baked up so high (3 3/4") and beautiful in the pan. It sliced up perfectly without crumbing up at all. I took part of the loaf to a young man at Butler University and sliced the rest and froze individually wrapped pieces to put in lunches. Jan, this is a winner!  MMMmm MMMmm good!!

Delicious cake! I made the recipe as posted, except that I dredged my chocolate chips in a teaspoon of flour to prevent them sinking in the batter. Took the cake to work, and it was a huge hit! (I work in a restaurant, so my people are "expert" witnesses!) Some people said "It tastes like a giant chocolate chip cookie, mmm.

This is in the oven now, I had to make 2 substitutions because of what I had, sour cream for the cream cheese and half and half for the whole milk. I tried the spatula after getting it in the bunt. Oh my, I can't wait to try if the batter is any indication!!!!!!! Happy Mothers day to me Yum! Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I've made this so many times that I can't even count! It's fabulous and so easy to make. I also like that it makes a nice big loaf. Everyone who tries this always asks for the recipe and some cake to take home, lol. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe with us! :)

YUM!  I had the pleasure of making this recipe before it was "kitchen approved".  My review went as follows...YUM! I replaced the chocolate chips with a container of Reese's Peanut Butter dessert toppings as it was all I had. Because the container was only 4 ozs. I divided the ingredients by 3. I followed Keni's lead and used my Wilton mini loaf pans because I wasn't sure how much batter there would be. 30 minutes baking time at 325 degrees was perfect. This made 3 mini loafs which is more than enough for Hubby and me. We certainly enjoyed this recipe, Jan. You never let me down. Now to go put them in the freezer with my pretzel dogs! Thanks for sharing WFDM!!

Thank you for sharing the recipe! I made it as is, but added peanut butter icing. It was delicious! It made enough batter for a fancy Bundt pan and the Bundtlette pan. It also freezes well.

Absolutely delicious!! Quick & easy to make plus it makes a lot. I used both a bunt pan and a 8x8 square pan with one recipe of batter. I also used regular sized chips which look fantastic in the bunt cake. Perfect! Definitely making this again. Thank you for the great recipe.

OMG...this is the best CC pound cake I've ever made! Made exactly as recipe says and turned out perfect. I mixed my mini CC in with my last portion of flour mixture and then folded that into cake. Used a chocolate ganache in it. Delish.

Edit update 7/18/17.....I don't understand how I loved this cake the first time I made it.  But every time after that, it has been disappointing.  It's not very moist and the flavor is bland.  I made it only because R requested it again.  Definitely will not make again.

I made one 9x5 loaf, and 2 mini loaves from this.  Very good.  The bigger loaf took a lot longer to cook, so it was more drier than the mini loaves.  I used only half the bag of chocolate chips, and that was plenty for me (although the kids wanted more chocolate).  Despite, the amount of fat in the cake, it was really nice and light and not greasy.  It was also not super sweet, but just the right amount of sweetness.  (I did cut back by 1 or 2 tbsp sugar).    I would make again!  And next time, I will make 4 mini loaves and a smaller 9x5 loaf ( so it doesn't dry out ).

Update:
Made it again....this time I reduced sugar by 1/4 cup, and still sweet enough.  I loved it the first time, but this time I guess I wanted a more flavorful cake.  Also, even though I wouldnt call it dry, it could be more moist.   Probably won't make again
