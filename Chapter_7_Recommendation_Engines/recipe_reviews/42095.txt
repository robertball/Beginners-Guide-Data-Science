Something is seriously wrong with this recipe.  I had to add at least 4 times as much milk as it called for.  It got to the point that I was just pouring it in and not even measuring it because the dough was so dry.

Thanks goodness my printer malfunctioned the first time I looked at this recipie.  I followed the revised instructions exactly and the result was a very nice cookie, not too sweet, not too spicy, not too chewy... just right.  Thanks for sharing it Angie.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I made them for Mother's Day.  The recipe made alot of cookies and the plate was empty at the end of the cook out we had for my mother, not to mention the "missing cookies" my husband kept taking as soon as they came out of the oven.  Do add the whole cup of Milk, I did, came out just right and they were nice and soft.  I used currants, but not the dried ones.

I just made these cookies.  This is just the recipe I have been looking for.  Just like the ones my Aunt used to make us all the time.  I am going to add more raisins though.   Very good!

Outstanding recipe - EXACTLY what I was looking for!  I read the comments about the milk and found that only 1/2 cup gave me the perfect consistency.

These cookies turned out very well.  We used these with my daughter's girl scout troop as part of earning a badge and they enjoyed making them as well as eating them!  I wasn't able to locate currants though so we used golden raisins.

Good cookie, I used 3/4 cup of milk and a lot more raisins. When I make it again I'm going to top them with a glaze, that will be the finishing touch they needs.

This recipe is great! Just the right amount of spice and just chewy enough. I added ground ginger, which worked well.

The corrected amount of milk made for a perfect cake like cookie. I'm not one to alter other folks recipes however,I did tweek this one to make it a bit healthier. Instead of using real butter, I used a heart healthy buttery spread. You know, the one in the yellow, green and red tub?
They came out great. Thank you for sharing a recipe that has made it through so many generations.

Quite nice, but a bit plain. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added some ground ginger and some vanilla. I thought these were best eaten within 2 days or they went a bit stale

Pretty yummy, if a little bland. I sprinkled the tops of the cookies with turbinado sugar before I baked them, and that sweetened them up a bit. Very cakelike texture.

Nice, easy, a little bland to my mind, but a big success when you're called upon to bring a batch of cookies to an event since they look smart and give the vague appearance of being healthy.

I really liked these! I was generous with the spices (also added some allspice) and sprinkled the tops with coarse sugar before baking for extra crunch.

I loved these, but they didn't go over that well with the rest of the family. Texture-wise, they are very cake-like, so they seem more like a recipe for muffins than for cookies. That said, I personally was a huge fan. They go great with a mug of tea in the afternoon, and I plan to make more! I didn't have currants, so I used the dried berry mix I happened to have in the pantry, and they turned out great.

I have been using an almost identical recipe (same ingredients, different amounts) for Spice Cookies all my life.  I got it from my mom who got it from her mother who was Czechoslovakian.  This is my favorite cookie ever.  I always thought of these cookies as being Czech cookies and not English cookies as the lady who submitted the recipe claims.   I am confused now as to the origin of the recipe.

Yum! I loved these cookies! I have made them twice now with the full amount of milk and a little less for crispier cookies and both are great, it's just a matter of preference. I didn't have raisins so used chopped dates and also have used a combination of brown and white sugar due to being short on white sugar, which worked well. I had to bake about 25 minutes in my oven but overall, this is an adaptable,  very easy and delicious recipe.
