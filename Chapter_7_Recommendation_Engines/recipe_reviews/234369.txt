I made 3 or 4 changes. I subbed ground beef for stew beef as that was what I had on hand, olive oil instead of vegetable out of habit, didn't have canned figs so I used fresh/dried, also didn't have red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar. Overall, my family & I really enjoyed it. It was a little too sweet for my personal taste but that can be fixed pretty easily. I fully intend to make this again as it is well worth the time put in.

I did make a few changes.  I used dates instead of figs (couldn't find figs) and used walnuts instead of almonds.  And, rather than cooking anything, I just put it all in the crock pot and let it sit for 5-6 hours on low.  It was a bit sweet, so I'll cut the honey in half next time (and save a few calories).

I don't know what serving size you are using, but I'm using about 12 oz for a serving size and according to websites for recipes, the calorie count is actually about half of what this recipe states, so they either use high calorie dense foods or double their serving size.

I used lamb, plus rehydrated figs.  It turned out delicious.

Although I omitted some major ingredients (didn't have canned figs and almonds on hand) and substituted beef stock for the water, I really enjoyed this dish. It was different and I like how the honey added a bit sweetness to the other savory ingredients. It was so simple and took very little ingredients or effort. Served it over couscous. Will try it again with the figs if I can find the canned variety.

This was different! It was coming out watery so I added beef bouillon. Not a fan of the fig in this-it became chewy and sticky. Also would have liked more veggies.
