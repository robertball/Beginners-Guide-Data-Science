The words that come to mind when drinking this smoothie: Definitely different. Oddly sweet. Wonderfully fresh and spicy- I used a whole jalapeño. Surprisingly addictive-I drank both myself. Everyone needs a jalapeño in their smoothie! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made this with a couple of alterations:
1. I used a whole jalapeno.
2. I cut the bananas, mangos, and jalapeno and froze them overnight.
3. I used half milk and half water.

It still turned out delicious and will definitely make again. Thanks!

It's... interesting.  The addition of a jalapeno is a bit strange.  I'm not sure if I'll make it a second time without tweaking it a bit more.  I used orange juice in stead of water, which I think made it a bit more sour than it should be.  This stuff might actually make a decent marinade actually.

I took the advice of adding a whole jalapeño plus I used plain unsweetened almond milk instead of water, and added pea protein. Perfection!!

I'm going to try this.  I am cutting the mango and using apple juice instead of water.

I love this smoothie. I used frozen peaches instead of mangoes because that’s what I had in my freezer, still delicious! I used a whole jalapeño & next time I may add a little more because I love the spicy, slightly sweet mix!

This smoothie was great, I really enjoyed the addition of the jalapeno, I also put extra jalapeno in mine as I like spice.  I think next time, I might try just a little bit of lime juice too for some brightness, but it was great as is!
