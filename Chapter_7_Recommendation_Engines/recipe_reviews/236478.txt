These are very unique. The buckwheat was still very hard after 10 minutes so I drained it (reserving the water) and resoaked them for another ten minutes in boiling water. This helped, even though they are still crunchy after cooking them in the batter. I used buckwheat flour instead of  spelt in order to keep it gluten free. I did not add the honey, drizzling over the pancakes instead. I also added some blueberries to the batter. Thank you for the recipe.
