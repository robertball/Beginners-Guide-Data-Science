The recipe does not say whether to wash off the salt.  I did not, and the ginger turned out too salty.

It is nice to know how to make our own pickled ginger. I sliced the ginger thin when it was raw, then added it to the boiling vinegar mixture and simmered it for about 5 minutes. I then put it in to the jar, cooled it, and stored in the refridgerator. We used it the same day with our sushi...perfect!

Very good. Surprised at how easy this was, just hard to wait! To peel ginger, just use a regular spoon and the skin comes right off.

The pink color has nothing to do with the quality of your rice vinegar. Only very young ginger will turn pink during the pickling process. The ginger root you buy at your supermarket is not young ginger. I doubt if any companies are using coloring to create the pink color, unless it is really cheap ginger. Any Japanese-made pickled gingr will be young ginger. If it really bugs you that it's not pink, try to find young ginger - you will probably have to go to an Asian market or a large public market in a major metropolitan area with a large Asian population. I like mine just fine white. This is a great recipe, just the way I make mine. You will love the taste, don't worry that it's not pink!

Good recipe. I used apple cider vinegar with a dash of balsamic as I had ran out of rice vinegar (We live 150ks from nearest supply) did not have the natural pink color still tasted good and cleaned the pallet. Next time I might add a little finely sliced chilli.

I used my mandolin slicer for my ginger and still it didn't turn out as thin as I like. (I like mine paper thin) I'm still trying to figure out how to get it thin enough...  The flavor was really good and you can just keep adding more ginger to the pickling as you go along.

Fantastic!  Only stored it for 2 days in the fridge and it was great.  Sliced it thin on my mandoline before.  It didn't turn pink, but my rice vinegar might have been "okay" quality.  I aslo used splenda instead of sugar.I may have sliced it too thin, but for the salad Ginger Cabbage Salad recipe I used it in I think it was fine.

I didn't know this would be so easy to make. I didn't have any rice vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar, next time I make it I will try the rice vinegar and see if there is a difference.Mine tasted great.I used a regular potato peeler and it came out fine.I love having this on hand.thank you

Almost perfect. This tastes much better than the store brand and comes very close to some of the restaurant quality gari.

Great recipe.  I used stevia instead of sugar, turned out perfect!  I used my awesome Breville food processor on the thinnest setting to get the ginger paper thin.  I also simmered the ginger in the brine for a few minutes before I put it in the jar, as someone that reviewed this before me said to do.  I did not use a whole lot of salt, and I did not rinse it off, so the saltiness is perfect.  Turned out awesome!  No, it is not pink, but it's natural and homemade and delicious!

This came out amazing!  I used a potato peeler to slice as thinly as I could and I added a drop of red food coloring for the pink effect. Super easy and super tasty!

A tad sweet, but good.  I shaved ginger with a vegetable peeler. I also added an additional 2oz of Chinese  red vinegar.  Instant pink color.

Easy to make. I peeled the ginger using a spoon and then used a potato/veggie peeler to peel the cleaned ginger so I could get nice thin slices. I did this with the raw ginger before I added the hot mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

Followed instructions to the letter and it came out perfect. The ginger packs a punch. I did select the youngest ginger I could find and was rewarded with a slight pink colour. I will be making wasabi eggs with this soon. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it right by the recipe. It is delicious and I love it!! My problem was being able to slice the ginger as thin as I wanted it. I used my mandolin  and it sliced too thick, I tried a vegetable peeler, but that didn't  work well either. I ended up using a knife, which took longer, but gave me the the very thin slices I wanted! Thanks for a great pickling recipe!

Recipe gives the right results, except one minor thing: It did not explicitly tell the difference between young and mature ginger. I believe traditional Japanese gari uses young ginger, which gives that pink colour. Also, it is easier to slice paper thin. I mistakenly used mature ginger.

I added a bit of White Vinegar because I didn't have enough Rice Vinegar... Actually turned out better this time.  Was a 2:1 Ratio (Rice Vinegar:White Vinegar)

Has always been my Go To Recipe for Pickled Ginger!

The recipe itself is okay. I recommend slicing the ginger very thin. My ginger turned out like a crunchy pickled ginger. I had expected that it would be more wiggly so-to-speak, like the ginger that comes with sushi. Maybe I need to cook the ginger and then pickle it. I don’t know. For crunchy pickled ginger this is a fairly decent recipe.

This is a great base recipe that can be adjusted based on preference. We like our pickled ginger more on the sweet side so I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and one scoop of Stevia extract. To get the desired pink color, I added one  leaf of red cabbage in the vinegar when it was simmering. I tore it into pieces, cooked it down and sieved it out with a wire mesh strainer right before pouring into the ginger. When picking out the ginger at the store look for ones that have a pink blushing, they are easier to peel and slice, and are more tender once pickled.

I actually did like another reviewer, by putting the ginger into the boiling liquid for 5 minutes, and then put the mix in the jar. It is very good, and keeps a long time in the refrigerator.

Very good recipe. I used raw sugar and apple cider vinegar and simmered the ginger for about a half an hour since we were going to use it with our sushi that day. It turned out wonderful and will be a staple in our fridge from now on. InshaAllah

Did it with the same ingredients . I swapped  the rice vinnegar to the mix of 1/2  red rice vinegar ( you can buy the red rice vinegar at the oriental market) and 1/2  white rice vinegar. The brine is pink and the  ginger  turn to light pink.

As a pickled ginger it was very good and easy to make.  I decided that I didn't really like pickled ginger at least not in the volume the recipe made.  I did wash the salt out before adding the vinegar as was suggested by many.

Making about every 3 months, we love pickled ginger and this is on the easiest and rewarding recipes I've tried on this web site.
