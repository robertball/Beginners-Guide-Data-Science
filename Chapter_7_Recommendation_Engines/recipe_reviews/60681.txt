This was so delicious! A friend of mine from South America raved about it as well. I did make a few changes. After browning the pork on the stove top, I put it in the slow cooker. I deglazed the pan with the liquids, including a splash of white wine, and poured that into the slow cooker. I added extra juice to cover the meat. 45 minutes before serving, I added cubed potato, slivered onion and chopped tomato (20 minutes before serving). I thought this made the dish more authentic when compared to our local Peruvian restaurant.

My family thought this was wonderful for a change. I took advantage of another reviewer and added potatoes and carrots. I also added cayenne to spice it up. I would have thought that this is what is called a curry dish. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice now, and second time's the charm.  First, save yourself work:  rather than cubing the meat, cut it into larger pieces and marinade all day.  The larger pieces makes browning the meat go faster.  I'm not even sure browning adds that much.  Second, I used cider vinegar and cut down the orange juice by a third the second time I cooked it, giving it a more mellow and lass acidic flavor.   Third, and this was special:  This last time, when the meat was tender (and before thickening the sauce) I removed the meat from the pan, put the liquid through a fat separator, added enough water to bring it to 4 cups, brought it to a boil, added 2 cups well-rinsed basmati rice, cooked the rice until nearly done and returned the meat to the pan to re-heat.  The rice was a beautiful color and had great flavor, with one less pan to clean.  Serve with plain yogurt, if desired.  Broccoli or cauliflower make good side dishes.

I thought this was pretty good.  Not as spicy as I thought it was going to be.  Next time I'll add some cayenne.  I cooked it all day on low in my slow cooker.  I also added some baby carrots for some veggies.  Served over rice.  Thanks Kimber

I tried it. It was ok. This was a little too sweet for my taste, I might try it next time with 1/2 the OJ and add 1/2 cup lemon juice.

Made this recipe with bone-in pork shoulder (rather than cubed) and it worked well.  I marinated the meat in a plastic-zipper bag.  Before adding the o.j. and water to the skillet, however, I first poured it into the bag to capture remaining spices, etc.  I didn't find the liquid to be too much OR too little.  Added vegetables as others suggested, including larger chunks of fresh zucchini. Since I browned the meat in an oven-proof skillet, I just slow-baked it (325 degree oven) right in the skillet for two hours; adding the veggies midway. Personally, I loved the flavor, the sauce and the addition of veggies.  Will definitely make this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Unlike prior reviews, I did not find it difficult to make at all! (ref: not worth the time).  I too added a dash of hot sauce.  When you first brown the pork it will not really leave much sauce in bowl.  As it browns drain marinade back to its bowl; but let it brown!  Then add back the marinade.  I would make it again.

This recipe is outstanding!  Lovely flavour and texture.  I added a few florets of cauliflower and a little more water to the meat on the second day, simmered it gently for about 20 minutes or so and it was delicious!  I also served it with buttered, steamed potatoes and it made a lovely meal.
Many thanks Kimber.  This is most certainly a "do again".

Over rice, this is an inexpensive and filling meal. The flavors reminded me of an Indian dish served in an authentic restaurant. I prepared the marinade and pork the night before, so it was a snap to cook up. I did add a sprinkle of cayenne pepper: I'd suggest that for anyone who wanted it actually SPICY. Thanks for sharing.

I didn't find this hard to make at all. I made it as written and found it was more tangy than spicy. The next time I'll try adding a bit more cumin and maybe some cayenne. I really enjoyed the dish! Thanks Kimber!

We enjoyed trying this uniquely flavored dish, but it was a bit too strong for our tastes.  I also think the portion size is a bit off.  2 1/2 lbs of pork makes more than 4 servings at our house.

This was pretty yummy but I changed the recipe up a bit. I roasted fresh garlic and onions along with green chilis and tomatillos and pureed it all together. Instead or marinating, I dredged the pork in flour and quickly seared it. Cooking the flour adds better flavor. Then I threw it all in a crock pot and let it go for a few hours. I chopped fresh cilantro in just before serving and it was yummy!

I instead used pork chops because that was all I had in my freezer at the time. I also added a teaspoon or two of aji amarillo paste for spice and served it all over plain white rice. Pretty tastly.

We recently spent 2 months in Peru and can't say that this dish reminds me of anything we ate while we were there, however my husband and I really enjoyed this pork.  I used apple cider vinegar and added some of the orange juice to increase the marinade liquid and then let the meat marinade for 8 hrs.  I also added cayenne as others suggested  to make it spicy.

4-5 star 'if modified'. There's a few problems with this recipe. It's a good base but needs a lot of help. First off it's not spicy unless you add a lot to it. Secondly the 'marinade' isn't possible when the only initial liquid is 1/4 cup of vinegar and a bunch of dry spices. There's no way to just put the marinated pork in a pan to brown then add the marinade because the pork and spices absorb the small amount of liquid.   Here's what I added to the marinade: cayenne pepper, sliced red bed pepper, multiple fresh garlic cloves, carrots. I did the marinade as stated but since there was no liquid to separate from the pork I put it all in the pan at once including all the things I added. Also this was put over white rice in the end so plan on making that too. Without that I'm not sure what you would do with it. Marinate the above, throw it in the pan, simmer for 40 minutes or until the pork is tender by fork, the add the orange juice, water, onion... etc for 4-5 minutes, then the flour to thicken. Serve over rice. Ends up tasting more like a mild spicy curry dish than anything else.

This was ok, but a lot of work for the result.  The tumeric gives it a terrible yellow-green color that is quite off-putting!  I won't make it again

Made as written, this is incredibly bland. Added some more seasonings but it was still pretty boring. Not quite sure what I could have done to improve it further. The orange juice and cumin flavors are a little weird together also. Thanks anyway.

Thank you for sharing recipe. It is pretty good with little modifications: pork needs to be seared quickly and finish cooking in slow cooker or in the oven on low. Marinade should be definitely doubled, with more cumin. Use fresh garlic and onion for best flavor - not the dry one. If you want spicy dish, after it's done sprinkle red pepper flakes on the top - this way you can have some of the pork spicy and some not, for those who do not like spicy. Lastly, do not use water - use white wine instead, same amount; deglaze pan with white wine after you cooked pork in it. Vinegar in the marinade evaporates with cooking, so there is no way this dish is vinegary. I agreed with other members -  added some cubed potatoes and sliced roma tomatoes in the last 30 min. Because of tomatoes the dish was not green-yellow, but more orange, very festive looking.
