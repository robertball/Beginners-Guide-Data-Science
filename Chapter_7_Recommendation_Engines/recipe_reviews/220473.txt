This revisits a common recipe of a solid performer.  This classic, standard pound cake recipe is so popular and so enduring because it’s delicious and turns out perfectly every time.  On this occasion, I used the batter for cupcakes for my grandbaby’s Baptism.  I filled them about 1/3 full, dotted them each with 1/2 tsp. of seedless raspberry jam, then added more batter to about 3/4 full.  I baked them at 350 degrees about 23 minutes, then frosted them with a Vanilla Buttercream.  The combination of the cake, the raspberry and the buttercream couldn’t have pleased me more.  The flavor variations in this cake are limited only by your imagination – in this case I used 1-1/2 tsp. of clear vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond flavoring;  but rum, coconut, orange, lemon are all just a few of the many interesting alternatives.  Bake this dependable pound cake recipe with confidence, and beware of those recipes with changes in the amounts of sugar or, most particularly, butter.  (Now, cross your fingers for me that these make it intact to Minneapolis tomorrow for Andrew’s Baptism!)

This butter-bomb is not for the faint of heart (!), but it is outstanding. It resembles a rich pound cake. I sifted some powdered sugar on top, but thin slices would also be great with a fresh fruit sauce and whipped cream.

Egg-xactly what I was looking for...something Irish on St. Patrick's Day and a way to use up some of the excess eggs my hens are laying these days.  My eggs were warmer than room temperature as they were straight from the hen house (yes, I did get pecked!) but the cake turned out incredible.  So decadent! First class!

I made cupcakes using this recipe. They were little bundles of moist buttery goodness. I used cool whip buttercream frosting tinted orange for Halloween. Had to take them to work so we wouldn't eat them all.

Delicious and very dense. I had to bake it for closer to 2 hours but it came out fine. I loved this because it's not super sweet and a great festive treat.

OHMGA!!!  This is the best butter (pound cake) I've ever made.  So easy!  Oh so delicious!!  Hands down, the best, easiest pound (ahhh, butter) cake I've ever made.   I did take some of Naples34102 suggestions to not change the basic ingredients though.  Since I made this cake for St. Paddy's Day and to celebrate my 60th Anniversary of coming to America, I only ADDED ingredients.  That is, I added 2 oz Irish Whiskey, two scrapes with a toothpick of Wilton's Leaf Green GEL food coloring and 1/2 cup of roughly chopped Pistachio nuts.  I added these along with the vanilla extract and before adding the sifted flour.  I also cooled the cake completely INSIDE the pan and when completely cold, turned it out onto a serving platter.  I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar and added a green rose (for decoration).  Served with home-made vanilla ice cream and topped with crunched pistachio nuts on top.  Just DIVINE!!

Easy cake to make.  I substituted 1c white sugar and 1/2 c of coconut sugar (instead of 3c white) and found it to be sweet enough.  Delicious and extremely moist.

You must make this if you love cake! My family and I LOVED it. I made it St. Patrick’s Day weekend and I served it with custard sauce I had made the previous day for another Irish cake. I will definitely be making this cake again!!

This turned out great!  Everyone appreciated it.  I served it with an Irish Cream sauce.  (I used a brandy sauce recipe and subbed Irish Cream for the brandy)

The cake was easy and turned out beautifully. The flavor was okay, a bit dull I thought. My biggest frustration was the dryness of the cake. I expected a moist cake and it simply was not, even after I followed the measurements precisely. I believe a glaze or maybe some berries and whipped cream could save it.

I baked an additional 15 minutes. This turned out great! This would be good with berries and whip cream. Doesn't really need any frosting. I just dusted mine with powdered sugar. Made it for St Patrick's Day, and dyed it green. Turned out pretty

First of all...if you like pound cake, this is the ultimate recipe.  It is extremely dense and buttery.  It has just the right amount of sweetness and doesn't need a frosting, although I used a buttercream to top it off.  I made no changes other than I baked it in a 10" spring form pan, since I don't have a
Bundt® pan.  Baked at 300 for an hour and 10 minutes.  Turned out perfect!

I chose this recipe as it sounded very firm and dense and I wanted to make a 6"x6" cube cake for my nephew's 1st birthday-to resemble a musical toy he loves. I bought a 6x6x2" cake pan and thought the baking time would be significantly reduced due to the small pan. BOY was I WRONG! It took almost an hr and 45mins to bake out clean! and while my cake was level thanks to the damp towel wrap trick-- the top of the cake was like a crisp cookie and had lifted away from the cake below. I also greased and floured the pan very well and still had difficulty getting it out of the pan cleanly. There is no direction how long to cool it before unmolding and I did run a knife around the edge to loosen before overturning. I did 3 layers so I tried 3 different ways to grease/flour, cool before freeing and different utensils around the edge but to no avail. Also the cookie like top cracked and chipped apart when overturned.
Tastewise-OMG I wanted to just sit down and eat the batter--oh I also added a Tablespoon of vanilla instead of a teaspoon YUM!
Well we will see what happens when I take the chilled layers out for assembly and decoration tomorrow. Wish me LUCK!

I made this cake exactly to the recipe. It baked up beautifully. The finished product turned out visually appealing, very full and dense. The flavor though was just okay for me though. It is, as other viewers have indicated, a very rich cake. This, in my opinion, is too rich of a cake to serve to guests for formal occasions or to family for informal occasions. Despite my lack of fervor for this cake, my husband quite enjoyed it.

Maybe I screwed something up; it wouldn't be the first time, but I did not care for this.  Given all the wonderful, rich (and costly) ingredients, I would not try this again.

Tried this recipe on the recommendation of another AR member.  It was amazing!  I made with just a few tweaks.  I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour because I prefer the texture you get from using cake flour in pound cake.   I also used 1 tbsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of almond flavoring.  I did have one problem.  The cake came out perfect, but, as it cooled the cake seemed to sink and top cracked and crumbled.  Luckily, I used a bundt pan, so, once I flipped it the top was hidden.  Not sure what caused the cake to settle, but it was moist and very flavorful.
