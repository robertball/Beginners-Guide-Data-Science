This was a good recipe.  I didn't have parmesan cheese so I used mozarella and cheddar.  I also rolled the cheese ball into crushed almonds and it was really good.  I pretty much polished off the leftovers this morning right out of the fridge!  (Warning: do not keep cheese ball and yourself unattended in the same room, as this may lead to overeating, feelings of guilt, and spending an extra day at the gym!)

This was pretty good, my guests seemed to like it. The only thing that I did differently was to refrigerate the mixture for about an hour before forming a ball. It seemed to work pretty well. I rolled it in walnuts.

I had to change my rating to 5 stars after bringing the leftovers to work - it really went over well!

I've made this every New Year's Eve for 3 years, and never rated it until now.  This is awesome!  Love the flavor.  I usually divide it into 2 small balls and roll one in chopped nuts.  I also add some shredded cheddar.  I like to use light cream cheese and mayo so it's not so fatty.

Great cheese ball recipe- it was a huge hit with my family. The only things that I did different was to replace the parmesan with monterey jack cheese (dad hates the stinky cheese) and add some minced red peppers for color and some added crunch. I also added some more of the spices until I was happy with the flavor and let it all sit in the fridge overnight, which I think made it all the better. Can't wait until Christmas to serve it again!

After my neighbor brought us a cheese ball for Thanksgiving that was AMAZING, I have not been able to find a recipe that even came close; until now.  LOVED THIS!!  Can't wait to make it over and over and over.  Definitely worth having to put on my running shoes after!

Looking for an easy cheese ball recipe as part of my New Year's Day appetizer spread, a quick read of the ingredients told me I'd need to alter this recipe to suit our family's tastes. Here are the liberties I took with my first ever homemade cheese ball: added 1/2 tsp garlic powder plus an entire tsp of minced garlic, onion powder, black pepper, and parsley flakes to taste (didn't have chives, so I subbed a little basil instead), 1 tsp worchestershire, a couple splashes of red wine, and 3/4 c of a parmesan blend cheese. Lined a small bowl with plastic wrap and chilled for a couple hours. Rolled ball into some crushed candied walnuts from Trader Joe's, which was a pleasant contrast to the tangyness of the cheese. Awesome and addicting!  Will definitely use this recipe as my base again. Thanks!

Loved this recipe - very flavorful.  My husband hit it every day until all leftovers were gone.  :)  I added shredded cheddar/jack, since I had it on hand.  I also used more than 1/2 c of Parmesan, but it was hard to estimate how much, because I was grating by hand.  I substituted green onions, as I didn't have chives on hand.  Will definitely keep this recipe!

This is a quick and excellent recipe for a cheese spread. At first when I tasted it I thought it tasted a little like ranch spice in cream cheese, even though it is not in there. However, after I tasted some on a wheat cracker it was very good. It almost reminded me of a cream cheese version of Boursin cheese. I also liked that I normally have all of the ingredients in the house but the cream cheese. I even used lite cream cheese and mayo and it didn't seem to be a problem. I made a 1/2 recipe to put on a tray, like the picture suggest, which I might decorate with a jack-o-lantern face for a party tommorrow.

I can't believe that people actually like this recipe. I usually make mine with just the cream cheese, onion, worsh. sauce and some chopped dried beef, but I thought I'd try something different. The addition of herbs sounded good, but it's not enough. I used fresh chives from my garden, about 1/8 cup, but it didn't give it much flavor so I added a slice of diced onion to it too. 1/2 tsp worsh. sauce? I put in a full tsp and still added more after that. I took it that way and got complaints from the family asking why I didn't put any beef in it. This is a very bland cheese ball.

This has become a tradition in my family for Christmas Eve.  I do it a touch differently, though...  I purchase a superior quality artisan sourdough loaf and I cut a hole out in the middle, which I fill with the cheese mixture.  I rip up the large piece of bread that I removed and serve it around the round, along with variations of crackers, veggies, and ciabatta crips.  I also add a bit more Worcestershire to the recipe, but that's mostly because I am addicted to Worcestershire!  All in all, without this recipe, I would have no tradition!  Thank you so much!

This was tasty  :)   I added extra minced garlic and oregano, rolled it in cheddar cheese. When I rolled it into a ball, I used plastic wrap so it wasn't messy.

This cheeseball was unlike any other cheeseball I've ever had in the past. I make a different one every Christmas and this one was one of the best! It does have a very strong parmesan flavor, so skip this one if that's not up your alley.

Easy to make, got great reviews at an office party.  I did not have chives on hand, so instead of 1/2 tsp. oregano and 1/2 tsp chives I went with 1 tsp. italian seasoning.  (It likely would have been better with chives, but not worth worring about it).  Also, I rolled mine in choppd pecans.  Set up well and looked lovely!

This was well received. It was the 1st time I made a cheese ball, easy! I added dill and did not have dried chives. I also switched a monterrey jack cheese blend for the parmisian cheese. I rolled it in chopped pecans. It was great and I would make again for sure!

Super easy and was a big success at holiday parties!  I separated into 2 cheese balls and refrigerated.  Right before I was ready to serve them I rolled them in almond slices.

My adult sons loved this cheese ball.  Both commented on how spreadable it was.  Split it into two balls and rolled in sliced almonds, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I don't eat cheese balls at all, but will be marking this recipe to make again.

My family RAVED about this cheese ball recipe. I made it with one regular cream cheese and one light cream cheese (just to cut back on a few calories and make it a bit more spreadable). In addition, I used Light Hellmanns' mayo instead of full fat. The texture and taste were not compromised one bit. I also doubled the dried chives and added a bit more garlic powder. Otherwise, I followed recipe. I spooned it into a large piece of tin foil and semi-shaped it into a ball before I wrapped it up. I unwrapped it the next day and rolled it in a combo of crushed sliced almonds and dried parsley. Everyone loved it! One ball was the perfect amount for a 4-pack box of Ritz crackers. I will most certainly make this one again.

I always get compliments when I make this cheese ball, and it's so simple.  I follow the suggestions of others and add season salt and cheddar cheese for extra flavor.  I use fresh oregano and chives when I have them, and after allowing it to setup in the fridge for awhile I cover it with nuts (almonds so far, but I think pecans would taste good too).  This recipe makes a lot, but can be easily halved.  It has become a mainstay quick recipe to make when guests come over.

This was AWESOME!!!  Made it for Super Bowl and it was to die for.  Everyone loved it so much!  I took the suggestion of some others by adding some garlic powder and a bit of season salt.  I did add a little shredded cheddar but was not necessary to hold it together. It held together wonderfully.  I rolled it in chopped walnuts as I had no pecans, then shaped it into a football.  It was a hit.  Was perfect!!

I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano and it turned out great!  I also rolled the ball in sliced almonds.  My friends were begging for more!  This will become a party regular at my house.

This is awesome! I made exactly as written. Rolled in crushed almonds. My husband asked if I would make this in a container for him to spread on bagels for breakfast. The only difference was I doubled the recipe. Made one for a friend's party and made one to keep at home.

We really enjoy this recipe.  I have made this cheese ball twice.  Once I rolled it in pecans and once in almonds.  Both were nice.  Be warned this makes a big cheese ball.  So if making for a family, you might consider cutting the recipe in half.  One other tip, let the cheese ball sit in the refrigerator overnight before serving.  It lets all the flavors come together.

This was delicious and easy to make!  After I finished the recipe, I grated some cheddar cheese and rolled the cheese ball in it to add more to the look.  I made it for a get together and I received a lot of compliments!  Yum yum yum!

This was by far the best cheese ball I've ever made! I halved the recipe for a dinner party and they were scraping the plate clean. I added a few things to the recipe as well:finely chopped green onion, garlic salt, onion powder, a dash of seasoned salt and just a bit of grated cheddar to help hold it all together. Yum! This will be my new & easy standby for parties. Thanks!

My husband thought this was the best.  It tasted better after being in fridge overnight.  I added a bit more worcestershire sauce and would be real careful measuring mayonaise next time.  I used fresh garlic and you only need 1/2 to 1/4 of the clove.  I rolled in walnuts but will try pecans next time.  Very easy to prepare ahead of time and looks as good as it tastes.

This was very good for how easy it was.  It uses ingredients typically found in a kitchen, other than cream cheese.  Next time I would slightly reduce the amount of garlic pwd.  I would like the garlic to accent the cheese flavor, not over power it.  I opted to roll it in nuts and I think that added a lot.  Over-all I think it is a good basic cheese ball.  Thanks Elisa.

This thing was so sour!  I took about 1/2 package of Vann's Gluten Free cheese crackers, crushed them up, divided the large ball into two, and rolled the cheese ball in the crackers, making two logs.  This took the edge off and gave it a nice cheddar boost.

Best and easiest appetizer ever, and it's always a hit! With absolutely no tweaking! People can't get enough of it. I've never tried to make it into an actual ball -- I just serve it in a pretty dish on a platter of crackers.

I felt the urge to add ingredients to mine (and didn't actually measure anything), so I did, and it turned out amazing. I added just a little ranch dressing, a little paprika, cheddar and old cheddar cheeses, (green onion instead of chives), minced garlic, and a little italian seasoning mix. I think that's it. Including the ingredients in the original recipe of course. Soo good.

I loved this cheese ball (as did my guests!).  It was light and fluffy and had wonderful flavor.  It reminded me a bit of the Boursin spread that I love - but I didn't have the Boursin next to me to really do a taste test - but I don't think it's a copycat recipe or anything.  Just good flavor.  I made sure the beat the cream cheese in my stand mixer until it was creamy and lump free, and then I added the mayo and beat it until it was fluffy.  It made it super easy to spread.  Great appetizer!    I'm going to try to find a way to make it low fat so we can have it more than once a year.

I made this for my mother's 80th birthday party last month and it was a HUGE hit. The only thing I added was 3 drops of Tabasco and rolled it in crushed pecans. Everyone wanted the recipe and there was very little left for me to eat afterwards. Will make this again and again.

This was the first cheese ball I've made and I used this recipe for the cheese ball in a cheese ball igloo.  I added a bit of mozz. and cheddar for a bit more diversity in taste.  It just didn't have any kick.  There was most of the cheese ball left at the end of the party.  Maybe I'll try salmon or something else to give it a better taste and keep people coming for more.

I made this cheese ball exactly, and it just tasted too much like cream cheese and garlic powder. I doubled all spices, except for the garlic powder. It tasted a little better. Thanks!

So easy and so good! I added some white cheddar and onion powder as others suggested and added double the dried chives and garlic powder. I also used reduced fat cream cheese and replaced the mayo with nonfat plain yogurt to try cut calories.

This was so simple and was wonderful! It travels very well, and everyone loved it. I am making another one in a few days for us to keep here at home during the Holidays.

Loved this cheese ball.  I added about 1/2 t season salt and 1 t dried parsley to the mix along with 1 t of dried red bell peppers (I get them at Penzeys Spices) and about 1 T finely chopped green onion. I used lower fat cream cheese and it was great!
