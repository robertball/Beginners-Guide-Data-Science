Great, after mixing the cereal, chocolate and peanut butter ina bowl, I put mine in a plastic gallon bag, sealed it up and tossed well until coated with all of the powder sugar. It was much easier.

Love this stuff.  Made it for Christmas and the only change I made was to reduce the amount of sugar...way too much.  I wanted to be able to taste the peanut butter and chocolate.  I had forgotten about this tasty treat.  Thanks for the post.

Boy this is sweet.  I little will go a long way.  It was easy to make for the most part.  I had trouble with the mixing because I didn't have a paper bag or a bowl large enough and so ended up making a big mess.

I have been looking for this recipe for a VERY long time.  In fact a couple of days ago I e-mailed a long-time friends mother just to get it.  I found it here and it is just as I remembered.  It makes SO much so I was able to take to work and also gave some to my neighbors.  They have all raved about it and are demanding the recipe.  The one thing I would change would be the "paper bag" part of the recipe.  There's got to be a better way to mix the chex with the chocolate/pb mixture.  Any suggestions?  The idea of putting my food into a paper bag kinda creeps me out.  THANKS!!

This was so much fun!  I had everything in my pantry already, and it took like 10 minutes to make.  My husband 'chowed' down while playing video games and half is already gone.  Thanks Liz for a fun recipe.

Not bad but the Chex Muddy Buddies are much much better. They call for more peanut butter and less sugar.

I had made this a few times when I was younger, upon finding the recipe entitled 'People Puppy Chow' in a column in my local paper. I loved it, so you can imagine how distraught I was when I lost the recipe a few months later. And I'm sure you can also imagine how elated I was to find it again, here at allrecipes! And this version of the recipe didn't disappoint. It tasted delicious, the consistency of the chocolate/peanut butter mix was just right, and the recipe turned out beautifully. A refreshing change from your average snack food. A fantastic recipe!

I really can't say that I enjoyed this recipe.  I found that it called for way too much confectioners' sugar.   I used half the amount and still felt that it overpowered the chocolate/peanut butter flavour.  Maybe I did something wrong?

One can also find this recipe on the Corn Chex cereal box. They are actually called Muddy-Buddies. It is an awesome recipe, you have to try it. Actually its good not to make them that often since they are so addicting. Rice and Corn chex are the best. The wheat chex don't come out very good. You can also us it to cover many other things, It is a moddified basic peanut butter fudge recipe (with yummy chocolate added.) I actually used the mixture from this to add to a peanut butter fudge recipe that I found. It came out Great!

I made a double batch of this wonderful treat and I'm glad I did because it didn't last long. My only regret is that I made it while my daughter was at preschool so she didn't get to help. Perfection!

My aunt has been making this for ages! We all refer to it as "Puppy Chow" cause it looks like dog food, making people hesitant to try it, but once theyve tried it, they cant stop eating it!

What a fun recipe! We used a giant stainless steel mixing bowl instead of a paper bag. (To keep it more sanitary.) I microwaved the chocolate mixture in 20 second inervals until it was melted. I poured the chocolate into the bowl and mixed with a wooden spoon until combined. Use care not to crush the cereal, my 5 year old and I kind of kind of "gently tossed" it. After that, we added the powdered sugar (2 cups at first) on top of the mixture, and gently tossed again. I found that we needed a total of about 3 cups powdered sugar to completely coat. It's a keeper! Makes a lot. And I can see why you would use a paper bag, doing this in a bowl was messy, but fun! And after an hour in the fridge, it was ready to eat. Soooo good and easy .Also, we used Godiva chocolate which made it that much better!

I had this growing up at a friend's house and they called it by this name. It's also called "Sweet Minglers". The only difference is that we add about 1/2 cup of dry roasted peanuts which would balance out the sweetness that many people complain about. We use Crispix as the cereal, but can be made w/ others. And from my recipe, I only use 1/4 cup of peanut butter and only ONE cup of confectioners' sugar. 4 cups is entirely too much. 
It would be good to pack for lunches for older kids for school and husbands for work. I would fear that younger children would go into sugar shock if they got one bite of this - which is why I wouldn't let my 3-year-old near it!

I loved this and could not stay out of it, however my husband said it was too sweet.  I didn't use all the conf. sugar, but it was still coated nicely.  I ate about 1/4 of it, and he picked at it and then I sent it to work with him because I would eat the whole bowl if it was in front of me!  I did it in a paper bag like the instructions said and it coated perfectly.

I've always loved this recipe.  It's easy to throw in a sandwich bag and take on the road.  A really great crowd pleaser.  My only problem was that I had too much powdered sugar on the cereal.  I will cut back next time - but really great!  Thanks Liz!

People chow or puppy chow...its all the same. It makes for a great snack, which is also used for bag lunches. I let my daughter shake the bag and she has a blast. We make this now ALMOST once per month...its that easy & quick.

It's GREAT!! I've been using the recipe for years. Everyone here in Dallas refers to it as "Puppy Chow", which makes people kind of worried about trying it. But once they do, they can't stop eating it. It is a MUST to try!!

make sure your chocolate/butter mix is melted just right and thin enough to coat the cereal easily. 2 cups of powdered sugar is plenty. this is just as i remember it from being a kid. yum!

We make this in the microwave for a totally easy and kid-friendly treat.  Serve this to the guys on poker night and it gets eaten up every time!  Yum!!!

Delicious as is, but cut down on butter like the Chex muddy buddies recipe to cut down on fat!  You won't notice a few Tablespoons less.

Delicious! We made a whole mish-mash of sweets and treats this afternoon and "People Chow" was in the top 3 favorites for my family. Would be great with pretzel sticks too. Thanks for a great Christmas staple!

What a fun recipe, especially to make with little children. I have always known this as Puppy Chow. Thank you for the recipe and the memories it invokes. By the way, I never used more than 2 cups of sugar. 4 seems excessive.

Super easy to make.  People snarfed this up by the handful!  I think I will cut down on the powdered sugar next time, as there was a lot at the bottom of the container after the chow was gone, but it was no big deal.  You sure can't hide that you have been munching on this either, as you are left with the white evidence all over your shirt if you are not careful.  yummie.

Just like they sell in the grocery stores, but without the spendy price tag.  Everyone loves this tasty treat.

This stuff is good and addictive...but after a handful I get sick at my stomach.  Then, a few hours later, I'm digging back in!  I used Life cereal since that's what I had and mixed it up in a large bowl since I was out of paper bags. I think this would be good with some kind of nuts thrown in. My kids enjoyed this too.  Thanks for this treat.
