Fantastic! I sampled the butter mixture as I was applying to the corn, it was so good I made more to put on sliced potatoes and onions - wrapped them in foil and grilled alongside the corn! (hint - to make the mixture easier to spread on the corn, pop unmelted butter in the microwave for 20 seconds, then mix the other ingredients in. It makes a thicker paste and is easier to spread)

This is my 2nd review after having some of this excellent basting sauce leftover.  I sliced some red potatoes and micro'd them for 3 minutes, tossed with the yummy sauce, placed in foil, on med heat on the bbq, turned to not burn, about 10 min. I micro'd them because I remembered about the leftover sauce right when I started some bugers, so if you plan ahead, you can prob just bbq them longer without the pre-prep. OMG! They were soooo delish! You could prob use this sauce on chunks of scrap wood and it would be wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was the best corn on the cobb I've ever had!  I used olive oil instead of the nut oil and it turned out great!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! Forget the macadamia oil - it's not needed! This is great on corn on the cob, even good on canned corn! We drain canned corn & put on aluminum foil. Pour some of this all over, wrap up in double layer of the foil & grill it when we don't have corn on the cob handy and it's EXCELLENT. The other thing we love it on is diced, boiled yukon gold potatoes. Put them in a foil packet w/ this & grill - I swear, I completely forget about the steaks that are right beside them on the plate.

Fantastic!  For over 30 years I've grilled corn in foil with only butter, salt, and pepper.  Now I have a new recipe.  For those having trouble getting the corn just right, you need to time your grill.  I rotate my corn 1/4 turn every 6 minutes for even cooking.  My old grill required 8 minutes per side.  So try this recipe several times until you get the timing right. :-)

Fantastic. Great taste. Great because you can make it ahead before your company arrives. Good with any meat grilled. I even used the cheap canned parmesean I had on hand and it was fantastic (with EV Oil). Have made 3 times now and company always wants the recipe. It's the only way I'm going to grill my corn from now on.

This was the most tender corn I have ever made. I soaked in water for about 2 hours, then brushed with mixture, then grilled for about 30 minutes. Hubby loved it, but got mixed reviews from the rest of the family. Will make again, but will probably play around with the spices a little to meet the tastes of the whole family.

This is absolutely the best grilled corn.  Serve this at a home BBQ and your friends will love it.  It's better than any grilled corn I have ever had and I LOVE grilled corn.  I can't believe I haven't found this recipe until now. To the ones who have already tried this--Don't you wish all recipes were this good.

Simply delicious! There's nothing quite like grilled corn on the cob during the summer. I soaked my corn in cold water mixed with a little sugar and salt and left the corn in the husks. I softened the butter and used a little olive oil since I didn't have macadamia nut oil on hand and then added the rest of the ingredients making a spread. I grilled the corn as I usually do in it's husks and when it came off the grill I spread the butter mixture over top. It's definitely a savory herb mixture to compliment roasted corn - YUM!

Just the smell, unwrapping this corn after grilling, was enough to make our mouths water!  And the taste was amazing.  We will make this over and over.

So Yummy! I have been wanting to cook corn on the grill for a long time but my husband begged me not to ruin perfectly good corn. Apparently he hasn't had much success with grilling corn in the past. I made this recipe for guests and what a wonderful turnout! Our guests asked me for the recipe and my husband now wants it every night now that sweet corn is in season. I did use olive oil instead and didn't have any sage but still just as great! Thanks for proving my husband wrong. I love it when that happens ;) Enjoy!

This was too "herby" for my group.  The idea was good if I would have stuck to garlic, salt and pepper, parm cheese.  These are just our personal tastes.  I did love how the corn cooked in the foil on the grill.

Wonderful recipe.. Made a few changes that works great for someone with a dairy allergy.  I used a combination of olive oil and non dairy butter substitute with fresh herbs.  Basted  the corn and wrapped in foil about 2 hours before grilling.. this gave the corn time to absorb  the flavors.  Will definately make this again.  May even try some other herbs or adjust flavors, just for a change...

This was fantastic.  It's pretty simple and I didn't soak the corn first.  Still came out great and smelled really good too.  I used regular vegetable oil and Italian seasonings.

Good but it kind of covered the corn flavor. Try butter, soy sauce and tarragon mixture and do the coern the same way. Go easy on the tarragon.

This was really good! I loved the blend of herbs. I never would have thought to add most of them to the melted butter, but it turned out great. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to soak the corn for a full 1-3 hours, but I don't think it really affected the taste at all. This is a great side dish at a summer barbecue!

The blend of herbs on the corn was perfect. I used frozen corn since it's out of season, and it still only took about 30 minutes cook time going from the freezer to the grill. I forgot to add the Parmigiano, which is a shame because parm makes everything better, and macadamia nut oil is hard to come by where I live, so I used olive oil. Great recipe!

This was OK but think just too many spices for our taste.  Will stick with butter, garlic, and cayenne.

I didn't use any sage because I didn't have any, and these still were GREAT! Will make this again and again!

Like others, I used olive oil, instead of macademia nut oil. I bought fresh corn from a farmer's stand. We both really enjoyed the corn this way.

Really nice taste, very good, better than others I've tried. I followed recipe exactly but I only had regular EVOO and it was fine. I'm making for the second time today for July 4th !!!

This recipe was such a hit with my family we have made it over and over. We love the blend of herbs and had alot of them on hand fresh. Wow - Great Flavor ......I am going to get some macadamia oil and see if you get any added flavor, I just had olive oil. Thanks for sharing.

I enjoy just plain corn on the cob, but this was a nice change for having guests over. Next time, I wouldn't add butter and oil. It was too greasy/oily for my tastes, but that's preference. Cooking time was spot on and prep was easy. The spice mixture is delicious...next time it's going on potatoes too!

This recipe is delicious. I use this every time I make corn. I have not tried with macadamia nut oil because I need to go buy it. I will do that soon but I use olive oil or vegetable oil and it comes out good. Everybody loves this corn and be at the grill waiting for their piece when I have cookout. I am the corn person at all the cookout now. Thanks for sharing. If it's not cookout weather I do the same thing and bake the corn. Just put a little water in the pan and watch the water so won't burn my corn..

Seriously, the BEST grilled corn flavor ever. I have made this for my husband twice, and the second time he asked "Is that the good corn? Yes!" Haha. We grill them in the husks after soaked in water, then baste etc, but that is the only difference! Thank you!

If my family were reviewing this one, I think they'd give it a full 5 stars.  The only reason I didn't is because I have a few others I enjoy more. Still, if you're a Parmesan fan, this is a tasty, easy and unusual way of grilling corn on the cob.  Will definitely work it into "the rotation" from now on! :)

These were very good but I think they could have used a little more flavor. Plus the butter and spice mizture seemed to stick to the tin foil after grilling.

I don't even cook that much, but I am known for this dish. Macadamia nut oil can be hard to come by (I found it at Whole Foods) but it really makes the dish. I have made it several times substituting olive oil for the mac. nut oil and it's still very good. I also almost never have time to let the corn soak for more than an hour, if even, but it hasn't seemed to matter. I'm asked to make this for all my friends' BBQs. Highly recommended!!

For someone who likes the pure taste of corn on the cob without salt or butter, my husband and I thougt this masked the sweet taste of sweet corn. We vowed to try it again, but for the calories, I think just the pure taste of corn on the cob is sufficient.

Sooo good!  I didn't have sage and I forgot to add the parmesan cheese, and it was still delish!  I think you could use any variety of spices that you really like.  Can't wait to grill again and make some more.

idea is great, but the choice of herbs in the mixture doesn't blend well for a pleasant taste and the cheese does not stick to the cob. it ends up in the foil. very disappointing

I thought this was outstanding! We made this for our Labor Day cookout. We used 6 ears of corn, skipped the soaking, skipped the macadamia nut oil (didn't have any) and cut the garlic down to 2 tsp. Fabulous! The  herb taste was not overwhelming, just subtle, but the corn was juicy and uber-delicious. I had rather large ears of corn, and grilled 5 minutes, gave it a 1/4 turn, grilled 5 minutes, gave it a 1/4 turn, etc. I think the total cooking time on the grill was about 25 minutes. Next time I make this I'd like to spice it up a bit, but this was great for the folks (who don't like any spice at all). One of the best recipes I've run across on this site! Thanks!

We just didn't care for it espcially my children. The butter mixture smelled great & so did the corn when we opened the packets. The cheese stuck to the tinfoil & there wasn't much on the corn. Will not try again.

I don't think I'll ever cook corn a different way again. It's easy to make subtle changes by choosing your own combination of herbs and spices.

Yum! I didn't have any sage, so I skipped that, and I used olive oil instead of macadamia nut oil. I had never grilled corn before and WOW these were good! I also used a little extra garlic. :)

Everyone loved the flavor of this corn, but I thought the corn was a little tough, but good flavor. The next time I make this recipe, I will boil the corn for a few minutes prior to brushing on the seasonings, wrapping in foil and placing on the grill.

YUMMERS. No time to make it, lots of fun flavor. I agree, corn on the grill doesn't need much to be good, but this is a really good and really easy "jazz it up" recipe to impress company. Will definitely be doing it again! Oh, used EVOO as I didn't have the nut oil. Still fantastic.

I'm giving this recipe a 5 because my guests and husband loved it (he said it was the best corn on the cob he's ever had).  To me though, corn on the cob needs nothing more that butter, salt & pepper.

WOW..This is delicious...I ran out of corn before I ran out of "mixture"..that's only because I didn't have enough corn to begin with...so I used it on cut up veggies...summer squash, onions, tomatoes, peppers, wrapped tem in foil and grilled them...everything turned out amazing.

Very good!  We ran out of propane for the grill, so ended up baking this in the oven.  Can't wait to try it again on the grill!

Oh my gosh this was wonderful!!!!! We didnt have the macadamia nut oil, so we omitted that and also forgot about the parmesan so left that out too. We melted the butter and mixed everything in and brushed on the corn....SOOOO GOOD!!!! :)

I am ALWAYS looking for tailgating and grilling recipes--this was amazing!  I am sad to say that I have  only tried it with olive oil and not the nut oil it called for--unavailable unless I drive for an hour to a bigger city! I will get that and let you know then if it makes a difference!  We are doing this corn again  this weekend for a  nascar tailgate.  GREAT GREAT GREAT recipe for  corn! I have done both fresh and frozen--both work wonderfully!

The best corn we've ever had (including my husband). Will definitely have this over and over again. I accidentally added too much parmesan and it still turned out so good. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe for grilled corn is wonderful. I didn't have any macadamia nut oil so I actually just used dry olive oil instead and added some more cheese. It turned out great! Thanks-

We loved this!  This is such an awesome combo of ingredients.  Thanks for is recipe.  I doubled the recipe and made the compound butter the night before.  I debated whether to emulsify it before putting it in the refrigerator.  I think I will try that next time.  I took the suggestion of another and used EVOO since I didn’t have any nut oil on hand.  Like another reviewer, I also had some of the cheese stick to the foil.  Maybe I can solve this problem by spraying the foil with a non-stick spray before wrapping the corn

Addition to review: I added about half of a teaspoon of this compound butter to 3 eggs before whipping them with my emersion blender and scrambling.  This was yet another awesome way to use the butter mixture.

I've made this a few times and it's always a hit! I use olive oil instead of macadamia nut oil. I also add whatever fresh chopped herbs I have in place of dried. In this case I had basil and parsley. I omitted the sage this time too and added some crushed red pepper and some lemon zest. I've made this with the soak and without and both are fine (probably depends more on your corn really). Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!!

I used olive oil.  I didn't have rosemary and just estimated quantities but this was fabulous.  The sauce was great on potatoes also.  I microwaves potatoes for 4 minutes then cut up, covered with sauce and put in foil on the grill.  Perfect!!

This was very good!  The coating didn't stick as well as I'd hoped.  I admit that I didn't soak my corn first, since I didn't see that direction until we already had the grill fired up.  I will try that next time.

This was delicious - mainly for the flavored butter.  We will likely just use frozen sweet corn - easier - but I love the herbed butter with fresh basil from our garden.  Will likely omit the parmesan cheese and oil next time.

Wow these were soo yummy!  I skipped soaking the corn (we like ours crispy) and forgot to cut slits in the foil, they did fine and didn't burn.  A good alternative to regular butter/salt/pepper.

This is has a very stong flavor.  It was good, but I would use it very sparingly.  I used only 1/2 of the recipe on 8 mini ears of corn that I baked in the oven wrapped in foil.  It was good, but overpowered the corn.  All you could taste was the seasoning.  I would also cut down on the sage, it is too strong.

This is a great recipe!  The corn gets to tender on the grill and the flavor is awesome!  I didn't have macadamia nut oil so I used olive oil, other than that I changed nothing.

Did not like this recipe at all! The cheese just burnt on the corn and it tasted like the corn was left out on the counter over night not wrapped. Wont try again......

I am honestly amazed that so many people raved about this sweet corn recipe.  Because of that, I couldn't wait to try it. Boy was I disappointed! It wasn't fabulous, or even delicious. It was just "alright".  The seasonings that cooked into it overpowered the wonderful flavor of the corn.  It really tasted like the corn had been boiled and then rolled in Thanksgiving day stuffing. 

We are used to grilling sweet corn in the husks and the grilling intensifies the sweetness of the corn. I am so disappointed that we wasted the corn and the spices. We won't be making this recipe again. :-(

This wasn't terrible, but we didn't think it was great.  I think I'll stick to the salt, pepper, butter we usually use.  Maybe I'll add garlic.

As for taste, I give this one star, but because I made some changes and a big mistake which I believe was the cause of the "failure" I will give it four.The changes I made were: to reduce the yield for two. (I often find doing this makes a difference in the outcome.) And because I did not have macadamia nut oil, I used O.O., another change was using poultry seasoning in place of rubbed sage; and no salt because of a restricted "no salt" diet my husband has.  I thought with all the herbs and seasonings, this would not be missed. I followed the directions for preparing until the step of punching holes in the foil. I forgot to do this! When we opened the foil to check the corn, all the herb mixture had caked and mostly burned. We ate the corn as it was not burned but it did not have taste, which I take the blame for. If you make this recipe, DO NOT FORGET TO DO THIS IMPORTANT STEP! I will try this once more, as it should have been very good I think.

I did not slather it on, but gave the corn a light coat. It has a distinct, slightly off-putting odor off the grill, but the taste is surprisingly fresh and very tasty. Next best thing to plain grilled corn.

My 15 yr old daughter made this & made substitutions: light olive oil for the macadamia nut oil, fresh rosemary rather than dried; minced dried onion instead of the garlic (this was an accident she made) & no thyme- also she used frozen corn- it was absolutely delicious!!  I highly recommend trying the dried minced onions- best corn we ever had.

Very good.  The seasoning was different than we've had with corn, but it was good.

This was very good, although I did have a problem getting the mixture to really stay on the corn...I think next time I might soak the corn in the mixture itself before grilling!
