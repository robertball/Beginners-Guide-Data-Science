I did some tweaking, but these sure are tasty!  I used agave syrup instead of sugar, used only 1/2 tsp. salt, only 2 pkg. yeast (4 1/2 tsp), and changed the flour to be 1 cup rye, 2 cups whole wheat, and 1 cup all purpose.  I did not use the egg wash.  If I can rate these as excellent, with the changes, then I will!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are so yummy!! My kids couldn't stop eating them. I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and they were delicious. Otherwise I made them exactly as written. I made them with Chunky Potato Soup and it was the perfect combination for a cool fall evening. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very nice and simple recipe for some cheddary rolls. The completed product reminds me fairly of cheese nips :). The current recipe is made very well by adding some ham pieces in with the cheese, or by mixing the cheese throughout.

I don't know but I thought these were terrible.  They tasted more like tomato than cheese.

This is a very good recipe and works with less yeast if you are short. Easy to make...thank you Mollysmama!
