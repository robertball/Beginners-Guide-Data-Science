Great idea, the kids loved putting the legs on.  Didnt have raisins, just used cheese, pretzels and crackers.  Thanks!

These need to be eaten quickly and cannot be made ahead of time, because cheese will turn ends of the pretzel sticks mushy. You will also need a big plate,  if you plan on serving these at a party.

I have made this many times using peanut butter in the crackers (my girls have no allergies but it's important to check before sending these to school) and they are always a hit. The kids love them, it's easy for even young ones to help and they're really good anytime.

I made these for a halloween party this year and all the kids loved these, especially my ten month old son who ate these stacks every day for about a week and he won't eat anything more than once in a row.
