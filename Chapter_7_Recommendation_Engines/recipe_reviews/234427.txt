Other than using the Paderno spiralizer for the squash, I made exactly as written, tasted, and thought the olive oil dominated too much.  I then squeezed another half lemon onto the salad, and it was just a about perfect for us.  In the future, I'll use a ratio of 2 parts lemon juice to 1 part olive oil, but again, personal taste preference kicks in here.  It's crisp, bursting with freshness, and a very nice light salad.

I really dislike both summer squash and zucchini but this was amazing. I think the lemon helped get rid of that squeaky texture of the skin and the mint helped with the flavor.  We will definitely eat this again.

Refreshing option when it comes to zucchinis.Used the Starfrit  spiralizer for the zucchinis,  lime in stead of lemon with both fresh mint, spearmint and a hint of fresh tarragon ; no oil.
