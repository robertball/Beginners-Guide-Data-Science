Amazing and I am so thrilled I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used a sweet German white wine.  This recipe is really unbelievable.  My husband and I would take a bite and then exclaim its awesomeness.

This was amazing and easy and quick in 35-40 minutes we were eating. I used asparagus instead of peas because I don't like peas and it was really good too.

Awesome recipe!  Sautéed the onions and garlic in a couple of tablespoons of reserved bacon fat instead of olive oil.  Added fresh asparagus after deglazing with the wine and cooked for two minutes before adding the shrimp.  Didn't need to reduce the sauce after adding the pesto and cream...just gave it a good stir and it was the perfect thickness. Will make this again and again!

This dish is rich and filling. It makes enough to serve a crowd and is also tasty  the next day. Easy to prepare and also easy to reheat; just add a little milk and low heat. My husband loves this dish and has a list of about 15 people he wants to serve it to. Will be making this again.

This is the BEST recipe that I have ever made from Allrecipes.com. I would rate it 10 Stars if I could. It was so easy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I used frozen cooked shrimp and canned lobster. Absolutely to die for. You can purchase canned Lobster from Maine on line at Walmart. It is all natural.

It was very good.  I didn't add the half and half and it was still very good.  I also used gluten free spaghetti.  Great New Year's Eve meal.

I didn't add the parmesan because the dish has enough flavor! I did add in more red pepper flakes because I am a big fan of spicy food !! My fiancé loved it!!

I loved this recipe! No Langostino lobster in my area so I doubled the shrimp. I also used asparagus in place of peas as my husband prefers it. It was fantastic! This was my first time using Pesto and I will definitely use it more! Loved this recipe. Easy to follow and delicious.

Wow! This was amazing! I usually don’t make creamy pasta dishes but I bought langastinos and didn’t know what to do with them. The only changes I made was to use asparagus as another reviewer suggested and I used 1 cup of milk with 1 Tbs flour whisked in place of the half and half. It was so good I’ll be buying langastino more often just to make this!

Mushrooms instead of peas, evaporated milk instead of half and half and angel hair pasta on the side. Two lobster tails and half lb of shrimp. All only bc it’s what I had. Little less oil due to diet but that is just a personal thing. I highly recommend.

Unreal. I made this last night for my wife and kids and it was a HUGE hit. My kids (3, 5 & 7) ate every last bite. My so. (The picky one) was the first one finished! My wife made sure I saved the recipe so I could make it again. This was really easy to make and the leftovers also reheat well (with out the shrimp and langostino’s getting tough). Fantastic recipe, I will be making this again soon.

Halved the recipe for two. Made it with Atlantic lobster as that is what I had on hand. Reduced the amount of pesto to 1/4 cup and added 2 Tbsps of lobster tomale (thought that 1/2 a cup of pesto would overpower the seafood).  I also added my seafood at the very last and only heated through as my seafood was already cooked. This was amazing...hubby said it was restaurant quality.  See the photo added for presentation. Grated parmesan over pasta before I added a couple of claws and grated fresh black pepper over everything. I'll make this again.

This was amazing. I used asiago and parmesan cheese, that's what I had. Also only used shrimp. I would add a lot more red pepper flakes next time. I like spice. Very easy and elegant.

Excellent recipe!  I subbed some Chardonnay wine and used just fresh basil.I love garlic, so I used 6 cloves in the saute.  Raves around the table.

I substituted 1/3 cup butter and 3/4cup milk for cream,  Kirkland brand parmesan pesto for pesto and parmesan and I only used about 1/2 cup.  Instead of peas I used about 1/2lb  fresh zucchini and squash.  Once it was done I cut up some grape tomatoes on top with a little fresh parm. Ohhhh so good!

This recipe was amazing! I left out the peas because I just don't like peas, and made a couple of substitutions to make this a little more budget friendly. I used plain white cooking wine (in place of pinot), plain parmesan cheese (in place of parmegiano reggiano), and imitation lobster (and left out the shrimp entirely). This will definitely be made a lot at my house!

This is one of my new favorites! The only modification we made was we used gluten-free pasta (Ancient Harvest organic corn and quinoa blend) because my wife has celiac disease, but other than that we followed the recipe and it turned out fantastic. Hint: If you happen to use gluten-free pasta, follow the directions on the box for cooking the pasta rather than the recipe.

This.Was.Fantastic.  I had to omit the dairy because I can't eat it (and made my own pesto using a vegan parmesan cheese (halved it,) which is really easy to do).  Seeing as I didn't have as much "sauce"  I added a little more olive oil to the pasta to mix everything evenly throughout.  I didn't have either peas or asparagus (or french beans, ....) so I roasted some grape tomatoes and tossed them on top.  Pretty!  Costco sells lobster with their other flash frozen fish.  Totally worth the price.  You'll even have enough left over lobster for salad the next day.  Yum.  PS  Using a sun dried tomato pesto in this recipe is also delicious.

This is delicious.  I used asparagus too as I don't like green peas.  I am going to make for our Gourmet Dinner Club later in the month.  Yum!

I made this for Xmas Eve.  The only thing I did differently was I added some pasta water and the cheese at the end then simmered for another few minutes. Very good, very heavy and I agree that next time I will add more red pepper flakes as I could not taste it.  I'll get my cholesterol checked in a few weeks!! :)

The leftovers of this are not so good, but the fresh dish is wonderful, so make sure to invite enough people to eat it.
