This is one of my favorite summer salads. The best thing about it is it's adaptable to whatever vinegar you have on hand. I've also made it with white wine vinegar and balsamic and it always turns out fantastic. I like to use fresh garlic in this salad. This also makes a wonderful quick bruschetta.

Fast and easy for sure!  I used 'Seasoned' Rice Vinegar & an Italian seasoning blend.  Perfect summer lunch.

These are some very tasty tomatoes. I did have to modify it a little because I didn't have any sweetened rice vinegar. I used red wine vinegar instead and added 1/2 tsp of sugar to the recipe. Turned out beautifully. My man even likes it. He said it tasted like they were marinated in italian dressing. He loves italian dressing. I will definitely make these again.

07.27.17 ~ Yum!  I love tomatoes, all kinds of tomatoes, and we have a lot going on in our garden, at the moment.  I made a small batch of these using rice vinegar, as I'm not sure what 'sweetened' rice vinegar is.  It tasted light and refreshing and the tomatoes had the right amount of seasoning.  A nice use for an abundance of tomatoes.

I bought a huge container of grape tomatoes from Costco and didn't know what to do with them.  This was an easy and delicious recipe.  Ate it for lunch. May try adding cucumbers/onions or fresh mozzarella next time! Didn't change anything except added salt and pepper

I sub'd apple cider vinegar & used rosemary instead of oregano and added in avocado & mango for a few more flavors since I had these 2 things on hand, but the recipe itself is just as good, no avocado or mango required! This ones a keeper!!!

This was very tasty.  I made this as a snack to munch on while dinner cooked.  My 6 y.o. and I enjoyed it very much.  Thank you so much for sharing it! I am sure we will be making this again :)

I enjoyed this salad very much. I added some black pepper, but thought it had a great, unique flavor overall.

Made as per the recipe. What a great way to make grape tomatoes worth eating again, since, unless your grow them yourself, they are disappointingly bland by themselves.
