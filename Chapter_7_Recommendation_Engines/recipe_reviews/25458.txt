Is good. Left out the "MSG" and added granulated garlic in its place. We thought it was great, trying it on Steak and Pork loin next.

This has promise, but needs a little tweaking. As is, it's very salty. I made the full batch, but didn't use it all. I'll be adding some additional sugar (maybe brown sugar), garlic powder, and more paprika and black pepper. I may add some cayenne for some heat. For a smoky flavor I used smoked paprika (the recipe didn't state what type of paprika to use, and I have four different varieties.) Thanks for a good base recipe.

Very good rub.  i took a hint from the other reviews and made modefications myself. i changed the salt content to two tablespoons, substituted the white sugar for brown sugar, went to a table spoon of chili powder and a table spoon of onion powder, then added a tablespoon of flour because i anticipate the brown sugar to harden when stored.  here's hoping the flour works.  oh, i omitted the MSG because my body does not like that stuff and i hear that from many others.  i hear that MSG is not good for you.
now that i look at it, i made more than just a few changes, but that is just me.  
Enjoy all!!

I like this recipe, it's a good starting point for a rub. I left out MSG and added a little meat tenderizer instead. Also a dash of ground ginger and ground allspice. 
Has a lot of possibilities.
