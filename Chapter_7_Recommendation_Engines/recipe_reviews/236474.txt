This was Delicious! Very moist and loved the contrast of the salty and sweet.  The only thing was with the glaze, getting the brown sugar to dissolve, I couldn't get it to dissolved until I added the cream.  Then it did almost immediately.  It was a fairly easy recipe.  I did need to bake it 55 minutes.  We cut into it immediately after I transferred it from the pan to a platter and poured on the glaze.  Yumminess!!

5 years later and it's still a favorite! My coworkers are always asking me when I'm going to bring in more! So good!!

Absolutely incredible! Ended up pulling it from the oven after 45 minutes exactly and it was perfectly fluffy

This recipe was great! The picture is not quite accurate. The bread in the picture is darker than it turns out, when it actually comes out of the oven it is a nice golden brown and the top is not flat. The glaze is not white like it shows in the picture but a light chestnut color. It has a beautiful flavor to it. Although I did not have kosher salt, I cut the amount of kosher salt in half and substituted the kosher salt for Mortan salt (table salt) but it added such a unique flavor to recipe that it really completed the flavor and rounded the dish.

This was a great recipe!! I added a tiny bit of cinnamon to the bread mixture as well as some walnuts. Sooo good!! Can't wait to make this again. THanks for the great recipe! Oh and I only used 2 bananas and it was fine.

The glaze added unexpected finish to a classic banana bread! I doubled the recipe for the bread itself, but didn't double the glaze and there was still plenty of glaze to go around. Thanks for sharing this fun recipe!

Oh dear. Made this for breakfast the night prior and had to have it as a midnight snack. It tasted so good. Definitely a dessert bread or special breakfast.

This is a great variation for banana bread. I added a tsp of cinnamon to the dough. The salted caramel sauce is easy to make and I will be using it for my caramel apple cheesecake bars. Moist and delicious!

Probably make again.
I was letting it cool for a few minutes before putting on the glaze, my other half noticed it cooling and helped herself to a slice!

I made this in smaller loaves because I found that the center didn't cook as well in the larger loaf pan.  But, wow it was good.

I made no changes. This turned out pretty yummy, the carmel topping gives it a salty touch, something i wouldn't do all the time, but all-in-all it is good.

This was good, but to me had more of a cake texture than a banana bread.  Already thinking about what I might also use that good glaze on...

Very good!  I cooked mine exactly 45 minutes (I'll cook it a bit longer next time) and it didn't get quite done enough right in the middle, but other than that, bread and glaze were yummy...........warming our tummies on this cool Fall afternoon.

The bread itself was dry and boring. The glaze was good, but that was the only good thing about the recipe. Next time I will make using Janet's banana bread (on this site)and add the glaze from this recipe.

I don't see any nuts listed in the ingredients but I see them in the picture and why does the topping look green in the picture. Sounds good just the picture is deceiving. Will probably try the recipe for my self.
