AWESOME!!! Really quick and simple.  I used 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of a real lemon and served it with Lipton-Knoll rice and Steamfresh veggies.

This was very good.  Amazingly all my kids loved it and even said the broccoli hidden in the rice gravy was yummy (which is surprising since it's green and ususally that means, and I quote 'ewww')  I used a can of campbell's broccoli cheese soup instead of cream of broccoli which, I think, inhanced the flavor ten fold.  I also seasoned the chicken with garlic and onion powder and a touch of crushed red pepper and then I added an extra dash of lemon to the mix.  It turned out delicious and absolutely wonderful over rice!

Pretty good! My husband loved it even though he doesn't like cream sauces. I used cubed chicken instead, cooked with 1T garlic powder and 2t lemon juice (didn't really taste it anyway). I simmered cream of chicken together with broccoli, 1/4t oregano and a pinch of dill. Then added the soup to the chicken to simmer for 5-10 minutes. Server over rice. This will be great for winter.

I followed to recipe exactly, even measured ingredients, which is rare for me and this was not even edible and I love lemon and it was way too much for me.  Would recommend leaving out the lemon entirely although it would just be broccoli chicken but it would be edible

This was good as the recipe was, I used brown rice and poured the broccoli lemon sauce that the chicken was in over the chicken and the rice. It was really good, thanks.

I thought this recipe was perfect for a mid-week dinner. It was quick and quite delicious for the simple ingredients. I didn't use the fresh lemon or the lemon slices, but instead used lemon juice and it turned out just fine. Paired with rice and broccoli, this recipe was an easy and healthy feel-good meal that me and my boyfriend will be making again.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I scaled everything down for just one serving since I only cook for me and it still turned out well.   The lemon flavor is just enough without being overpowering and I thought it went well with the broccoli soup.

Tastes OK.  I actually added extra lemon - unlike another reviewer, I couldn't even taste the lemon with the standard amount. Unfortuanately, the SMELL is horrible. This is due to the Cream of Brocolli soup - it stinks all by itself when made as soup and that doesn't change when it's used in a recipe like this. I doubt I'll make this again.

Mmmm this was delicious! I used 2 cans of soup instead of one (the rice sucks it up) and adjusted the milk accordingly - 1 cup instead of half a cup. I also used broccoli cheese soup (the supermarket was out of the other kind)in place of the cream of broccoli called for. I added some frozen broccoli to the skillet as well and more lemon juice (about 1 tbsp or so more)too. I would definitely make this again! Really creamy and guilt free if you use the 98% fat free soup. Yum!
