Batter came up quite thin.  I think I will use less milk next time.  Otherwise good.

Even better if you roll the fish in dry cornmeal before frying!

Very bland and tasteless. I think it would make a nice base to make your own batter, however, it needs a lot of help. It really needs more salt and spices. No one in the family liked it.

Great! Easy recipe. Great alternative to the traditional heavy cornmeal coating. I served it with the "Jalapeno Bread". Great combination.
