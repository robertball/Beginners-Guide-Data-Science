I liked this a lot, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because I had to add a lot to it to make it taste good.  I added extra bean sprouts and about 5 oz of choipped water chestnuts.  I also added an extra teaspoon of soy sauce to each serving.  The water chestnuts really helped to keep this from being too bland.  I will definitly make this again, but with my modifications.  
The portion sizes were pretty decent and I felt they were very filling.

Was looking for a simple asian noodle dish to use the sugar snap peas in my fridge.  This was very, very tasty and filling with my adaptation to the sauce:  I used 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon mirin and 1 tablespoon chili and garlic sauce.  I dissolved about 1/2 tsp of cornstarch in the soy sauce, mixed the sauce ingredients and then added to the sauteed but still crisp veggies.  Then added cooked angel hair pasta and simmered for a few minutes.  The taste was a 5 but I'm rating this 4 because I added.

I served this as our main course with egg rolls on the side.  Great recipe to experiment with by adding to.

Mine turned out a little bland. I had to add some bottled stir fry sauce for flavor, but otherwise was pretty good.

Good base recipe. I used wheat pasta and added a bag of stir fry veggies. The veggie mixture included water chestnuts which I thought were important for the texture and crunch. I used canned bean sprouts and added some garlic and teriyaki sauce. Served with Sesame wings from this site. Thanks!

This recipe is basic and bland, but I did liven the flavor up by adding more ingredients. Since I used this for a side dish I used half the amount of fettuccine, then added more bean sprouts and a bag of thawed stir fry veggies. added 1 tbsp. reduced sodium soy sauce, a few pinches of cayenne and garlic powder, and also added a few pinches of Thai seasoning, and garnished with chow mein noodles. This made the recipe very delicious.

I had to add a lot to this to make it suit our tastes, but for the basic idea I thought this was wonderful.  I added some frozen peas/carrots, lots of extra soy sauce, and some fresh minced garlic and ginger. Served with my own version of terriyaki shrimp and mushrooms.

It's an easy dish to make.  I recommend adding a sauce, though.  We added shitake mushrooms, tofu, and a peanut sauce.
