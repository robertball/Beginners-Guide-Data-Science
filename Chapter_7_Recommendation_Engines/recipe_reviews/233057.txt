I've been making this recipe once a week for about a year now.  The only difference is my recipe calls for mixing sugar with the cinnamon for the topping.  This is so good!!! I serve it for a casual dinner. In fact that's what we're having for dinner tonight!  By the way, I use Panera's Cinnamon Raisin bread and have it sliced thick.

OUTRAGEOUS! So good it should be illegal!!!!

Although I think this is a very good recipe, the first time we made it, we didn't give it enough time to cool.  The kids liked the flavor but didn't like the consistency towards the center.  The second time I cooked it, I combined all ingredients in a bowl for thirty minutes before adding everything to the pan.  Cooked it a couple minutes longer and let it set up for half and hour before serving.  It was much better the second time around.

Everyone raved about this. I had a big loaf of old raisin bread and it was so tasty.  Easy to make I will certainly make this again.  I doubled the recipe and it was perfect.  Planning to make again for friends visiting.  Am going to use Apple bread I got on sale at Lowes Food Store.  I bet it's amazing.

Excellent and easy to make!  I did as others suggested and let the cubed bread soak in the egg and milk mixture for 30 minutes before baking.  I also added one tablespoon of cinnamon to the egg mixture and the second tablespoon I sprinkled on top of the casserole along with a teaspoon of granulated sugar before baking.  When it came out of the oven I let it rest for 20 minutes before serving.  I might cut this back to 15 minutes next time.

Made a double batch and let the bread soak for 25 minutes instead of 10 minutes.  Added some additional sugar and a little less milk.  Baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for about 55 minutes but checked the middle to determine if it was done.  Covered it with foil when it started to get brown.  I let it cool and then refrigerated it overnight.  Next day, I warmed it in the microwave (10 min on 20% power) and it was great.

This was so simple and delicious. I did NOT have raisin bread so I used challah and added extra cinnamon and a cup of raisins. I assembled the casserole the night before and refrigerated till the next morning when I was ready to bake. I also loosely tented it with foil when it started to brown too much. This is a great make ahead breakfast for company or the holidays. Thanks so much for sharing.

I used a cup less milk due to the other comments. I was so worried about it turning out gooey that I over cooked it and burned the bottom. :( although it had a burned bottom I still enjoyed the top. I will make this again but just be more careful about over cooking!!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was absolutely delicious!  Like a bread pudding or very rich French toast.  Perfect in every way!  Make no changes.

I made this yesterday and baked it this morning. DELISH!!! The only thing I did was add chopped walnuts to 1/2 of the casserole. Bobbi

I just made this recipe, early in the day, for the kids to heat up for dinner tonight. My husband and I must go out for a business meeting, so it is 'serve yourself' night. I had a loaf of homemade Cinnamon Raisin Bread that my neighbor gave me, and went a bit unnoticed in the back of the fridge for a few days. It was a bit dry, so I searched what recipe I could use it in. Saigon Cinnamon, milk from Switzerland, Vanilla from Guatemala, and good bread made in the USA. Organic eggs and Rapadura sugar- it almost makes me feel like I just made them an incredibly clean, healthy meal, that smells like the best dessert ever! My entire house smells delectable, and I am positive this will be a huge hit with the kids. If it makes it until dinner time...

This was my first bread pudding, and it was tasty. 
I prepared it the night before and baked it for 45 minutes in the morning. I ended up mixing the cinnamon in with the milk and eggs. 
I feel like it was still missing something.. Not too sure what exactly. Maybe more vanilla, a Pinch of salt or some sprinkled brown sugar on top. 
Served mine with some Greek yogurt and berries.

I used the thick Chinese raisin bread loaves (so two for this recipe = 10 cups bread), which doubled the batch, so doubled on all the ingredients except only 1/2 stick = 4Tbl butter instead of 6Tbl, and put it in 10x13 glass baking dish. I also mixed the cinnamon into the egg mixture to let it soak into the bread for at least 30 minutes. I sprinkled additional cinnamon on top after laying slices of butter all over it. Everyone enjoyed this recipe...will definitely make it again! Great idea for the holidays too...has that warm yumminess to it!

Easy & delicious! I substituted coconut milk for the milk and used cinnamon & sugar for topping. It didn't need syrup on it. The whole family said it was a repeater!

I used plant based milk (oat) and butter.   It came out perfectly.   The flavor was perfect and it was a big hit at the potluck.

I made this and it turned out amazing! I did read some of the suggestions and let it sit for 30 minutes before putting it in the oven. Then did one last stir and popped it in.

Kids and husband loved it!

I reduced the amount of milk to one cup but found it still too gummy in texture. More like a quiche. Unfortunately my kids, who love raisin bread, didn't care for this, nor did I. Not sure how I could adjust to improve, but I was definitely initially hopeful for this one!

Made it by the recipe and family loved it.  I did let the bread soak up the egg mixture for about 20 minutes before baking.  Will definitely have this again!

Made exactly as written and it turned out GREAT!  Nice and fluffy when it came out of the oven but it did deflate and I was concerned that it would be a dry brick but it wasn't.  Nice and moist but not soggy.  I did add sugar/cinnamon  to the top before baking. (Instead of just the cinnamon so one small change. Personal preference)
