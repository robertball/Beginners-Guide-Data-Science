I was a little skeptical (seafood and Mexican have never seemed compatible to me), but I had some fake crab on hand so I tried it. It was very good! I sauteed the mushrooms first, used low fat mushroom soup, and used fat-free cheddar singles instead of the regular cheese and it was STILL really good! I mixed half of the enchilada sauce with the filling and used the other half on top. I also made some with corn tortillas and some with flour. I liked the corn ones better.

I made this twice.  The first time it was missing something. The crab is very delicate in taste, so you need bold flavors.  The second time I added a can of Progresso cheesy enchilada soup and mixed it with the regular red enchilada sauce.  This added so much more flavor! If you add the soup, these are to die for.

I used this recipe as a base to start from...so my rating is for the idea/combinations contained in this recipe!

I sauteed up imitation crabmeat, fresh mushrooms, and shallots.  Added a tablespoon of hot sauce and addded a little milk mixed with one tsp. of cornstarch.  I mixed with 1/2 cup shredded cheese, then spooned into a baking dish.  Then I crumbled white tortilla chips as the next layer, then a layer of fat free refried beans.  Then another layer of crushed tortilla chips, then topped with shredded cheese and sliced jalapenos, and baked for 25 minutes.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe.  I modified it a little because of the things I had on hand.  I had some green enchilada sauce and some mild salsa that I mixed and used instead of the red enchilada sauce.  I only used about 2/3 of the cream of mushroom soup and 1-6.5 oz can of sliced mushrooms.  It's very good, easy and quick.

We really did not like this with the mushrooms in it, even though we love mushrooms.  It just didn't seem to go with the crab and red sauce.

My family didn't like the mushrooms they said they didn't cook all the way. So the next night they wanted beef enchilida and i used the same recipe with beef and olives (instead of crab and mushrooms)and they loved it. Easy to do, will make again.

this was a simple recipe to prepare and it was pretty tasty if you like imitation crab - i used a fairly spicy enchilada sauce which gave it a little more flavor...worth making for a change of pace.

Wow! When I first saw this I was extremely sceptic but I had mushrooms and tortillas I needed to use so I figured it was worth a shot. I'm so glad I did! The little ones at first were wary but even the littlest one who detests mushrooms ate it up and asked for seconds! The changes I made were I used cream of chicken and for the cheese I chopped up colby, muenster, provolone, and cheddar (remnants of sandwich stuff) and for the top I chopped and mixed a few jalapenos in with chili powder and paprika. Will probably use black olives with the mushrooms next time. Wonderful!

Pretty good.  I did have alot of extra stuffing that I had to throw away.  I added about 1/3 white onion and next time I will also add some green pepper (and will use less crab).  Would also be good with chicken. Overall easy and good recipe.  I will make again...with changes.

Delicious and simple! I made my own mole sauce instead of canned red enchilada sauce, and they were spicy and fantastic. A really easy crowd pleaser!

This turned out pretty tasty. I read previous reviews before hand so I decided to change the condensed soup to Southwestern Pepperjack (best I could find) and I cooked the mushrooms until they started to brown. It was easy to make and tasted pretty good.

This always stuck me as an interesting recipe and although it did take me a while to try it, we enjoyed the crab, mushroom, enchilada sauce combo.  I used a can of golden mushroom soup which has a bit of beef broth, tomato, and wine as well as 4oz of jalapeno cream cheese that needed to be used up.  I wish I would have added some corn or diced red bell pepper for texture.

This was okay. With some changes I believe it can be much better. First of all, and I stress this! Flour tortillas should be used with burritos and chimichangas, corn tortillas should be used for enchiladas! If you have left overs of enchiladas made with flour tortillas the tortillas become a soggy goop with every reheating. It’s gross! So the next time I make these it will be with corn tortillas, which I think  will be a huge difference. I think the biggest negative for us was the cream of mushroom soup. I’ve never liked that soup to begin with but I always try to make the recipes as written first. I still don’t like that soup! So changes I will make moving forward is to find a way to substitute the soup with other ingredients. Maybe sour cream or cream cheese. Or maybe just making this into a cheese, crab, and mushroom enchilada.

I made this last night, mixing the can of enchilada sauce in with the mushrooms, crab, soup and cheese as the recipe stated  Then, when I reached the end of the directions, it said to pour the enchilada sauce over the enchiladas before putting in the oven???  Which one are you supposed to do?  They turned out good, my husband and I both liked them, but I am confused as to whether the enchilada sauce is supposed to be mixed in with the filling or go over the enchiladas.  I'm surprised no one else noticed this discrepancy.  I guess next time I'll put half in the filling and half over the enchiladas.

I will make this again!! I did make a few changes. I accidentally bought green chili sauce, I also added a dash of hot sauce to the filling for and added "Kick".  I also topped it with Sour cream while baking, I also added salsa and Jalapenos to finish it off. It was an ABSOLUTE HIT AT HOME!! All I heard through out the meal was comments on the burst of flavors!

very good.  I had some extra crab that I didn't want to go bad, so put that in, and I also chopped it up smaller.  I sauteed onion and mushrooms together and then dumped the rest of the stuff in for the filling.  I softened corn tortillas in some hot oil and used those instead, it's what I had on hand.  I can see how a spicier soup would help things out.  It was kind of plain, but still o.k.

I love fake crab, but these flavors just do not go together.
