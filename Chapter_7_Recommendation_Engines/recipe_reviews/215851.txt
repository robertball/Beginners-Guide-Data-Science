Yummy and easy to customize.  I used 1 lb. of ground round, a 32 oz. jar of Arabiatta Sauce from Trader Joe's, and 1/2 lb (half box) of spaghetti.  A whole box would be way too much - as it was, it just fit into my largest Pyrex casserole dish.  I first sauteed a large onion in olive oil.  Then I browned the beef, seasoning it well with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and chopped garlic. Then I added the spaghetti sauce and let it render down well, so the sauce wasn't runny. I cooked the spaghetti for 6 minutes, so it wasn't too soft.  I layered the spaghetti/sauce mix, mild cheddar, the remainer of the spaghetti, and more cheddar.  I let it cook for 15 mns, then topped it with a nice layer of shredded mozzerella.  I baked the dish about another 10 mns at 350 degrees until the cheese was melted through.  It came out tasy and surpringly light, and not runny at all.

This was very easy to throw together at the last minute.  Next time I will add more sauce as it was a little dry.

I, like so many other moms, have NO time to really cook like I use too. It stinks but recipes like this make my life so much easier! This was a family favorite the first time we had it and leftovers the next night!! I have seen all the variations so I know I can kick it up a notch when I have the time but this basic recipe is quick and easy! I made it in the morning before work and heated it up when I got home. This is a keeper!

Tried it.... wasn't impressed, easy to make but not a lot of flavour, and dry...needs more sauce, and more flavour.

I layered it pasta, cheese, pasta, cheese. I added more cheese than was called for, so it came out pretty moist.  I'll be interested to see how well it reheats, but overall it came out pretty good.

Yumm! I didnt add meat and i seasoned with garlic salt and pepper. I added three eggs to the pasta and 26 ounces of sauce on the top of the pasta while i cooked it. Perfect! Thanks for the basic part though.(:

Really easy and good! It made a ton. I made a 9x13 inch pan as well as a small casserole dish. I know I used more meat, we like alot of meat though. Fast and will make again I'm sure!

This was filling and hearty. It was an easy meal to prep but not something we would eat again. The cheddar cheese made this very greasy on top and it would have been better with an Italian blend cheese like Mozarella and provolone instead.

So yummy!!! Used four cheese classico sauce and added onion powder and garlic powder to beef. Used Italian blend cheese and parmesan cheese in place of cheddar. Very easy recipe that yields fantastic results!

Perfect & Easy.  I like mine with more sauce, so be prepared to have more sauce on hand.  This meal is my standard to deliver to my friends that just had babies.

I made my own variation because I have celiac disease. I used a pound of turkey, 12oz gluten free speghetti noodles, 24oz Classico four cheese sauce then topped it off with a fiesta cheese blend, mozzarella cheese and pepperoni. Can't wait to try it out, it's baking now.

I made this recipe for my daughters softball team dinner this week.  It was a huge hit--pun intended.  :)
