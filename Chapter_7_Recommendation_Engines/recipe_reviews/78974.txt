It sure sounded like too much mustard, but tried it and it was!! Maybe it is a misprint and should be 3/4 Tablespoon.

This is like my grandmother used to make.  And yes, the mustard should be tablespoons, not cup!  We always use diced pickles instead of the pickle relish as well.

I reduced the amount of mustard and probably needed a little more.  I also forgot the paprika, left out the celery and used only 6 eggs.  I should have used more eggs, mustard and maybe even mayo so it would be a little creamier.  Everyone enjoyed it and my daughter LOVED it.

The ingredient amounts sound wrong to me for potato salad. I only put about a teaspoon of mustard in a cup of mayo - 3/4 cup sounds like it would really be mustardy!

I followed the recipe exactly an dit seemed like there wasn't enough dressing or eggs. Maybe my potatoes were too big. It was very good though. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you all for bringing the mustard issue to light. I made it for 125 homeless people and I can just imagine the mess I would have had 80+ cups of mustard! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! Thank You!

Too much mustard the first time I made it.  Cut it back the next and it was great.  Love the egg in it.

This was a great easy potato salad for someone who doesn't want a sweet, potato salad. I loved it, I always used more mustard than most in my potato salad.

I simply cut back in the mustard a bit and we all loved it. I like the cracker! My family thought it was fun to scoop up the salad. I have never known potato sald to be eaten that way, but we have started a new tradition.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars based on the assumption that the mustard amount is a misprint. I really liked this recipe but i also love love love pickles. If you don't, you may find the pickle taste a bit overwhelming and want to try a lesser amount and add to taste.
