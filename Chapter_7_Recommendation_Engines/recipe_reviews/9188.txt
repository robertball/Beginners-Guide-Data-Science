Awesome and easy! I did the individual cheesecakes and it worked great. I used a ginger snap in the bottom of a cupcake liner and then filled it about 3/4 full of filling. I cooked it for about 14 minutes and then added the topping. I cooked it for about 4 more minutes. So, so yummy! The cookie softens a little and makes a perfect no fuss crust. I did not need extra topping, in fact I had a little left over.

I make this every Thanksgiving and there is never a slice left.  Even if you don't like cheesecake or pumpkin pie you will love this.  I always double the pecan and brow sugar topping...I like it to completely cover the pie.  Happy Eating ;~)  My husband always ask if I'm going to make that Pumkin Pecan Cheesecake again.  He loves it.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2005 and it was a HUGE hit with my family... they said it tasted like the Cheesecake Factory, which was what I was hoping to hear. I didn't find the topping to be enough to cover the cheesecake, so I doubled it and it was great. I also made my own graham cracker crust and pressed it into a springform pan, which gave it an authentic cheesecake presentation. The pumpkin butter is divine and can be used on just about anything... I made only half of what the recipe called for in the other entry and served it with some scones that I had made for breakfast Thanksgiving morning. Everyone raved about the pumpkin butter in the morning and when I served the cheesecake that night, I told them I used the same butter to make the cheesecake - they said that stuff should be bottled and sold! FABULOUS RECIPES, ELEANOR! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

OK, I made some changes but I don't think it would have changed the out come of this wonderful cheesecake. First I doubled the whole recipe so I could make a larger dessert. Used a 9" spring pan with a graham cracker crust made with 1 1/2c crushed crackers, 1/2c butter, and 1/2c white sugar. I didn't pre-bake the crust and just put the filling right in on top. I baked it at 325 for one hour with out a water bath. When the 1 hour was up, I added the double topping mixture and baked for five more minutes to set the topping and melt the sugar. Turned the oven off and run a knife around the edge of the pan a put back in the oven to cool and set for 5 hours. Put in the fridge over night and enjoyed the most wonderful flavors this evening at a party. The pumpkin butter was so good here. There were no leftovers! BTW. I got the baking idea (cooling in the oven) from another cheesecake recipe on this site and used it because of the good success of cheesecakes with out the usual cracks in the top and no water bath to mess with.

This is one of the best cheesecakes my family and I have ever tasted.  It is so smooth and the pumpkin flavor is not too overwhelming...it's just right. I did double the topping because I like the crumb topping to cover the entire cheesecake.  The left over pumpkin butter is also a huge bonus!  This is also a wonderful treat, my husband would eat it by the spoonful if I would let him.

OMG!! I do not normally take time to rate the stuff I make on here but OMG these were SO SO good!!  I doubled the topping, poured into cupcake liners (with a gindersnap cookie layed into the bottom for a no fuss crust) baked for 15 minuted, added the topping and baked for another 7 minutes. These are better than sex. Will make over and over!

My husband took 2 bites of this cheesecake and said "I'm in love".  I like it because it only calls for 8 oz. of cream cheese.  Some pumpkin recipes call for 3 or more 8 oz packages of cream cheese.  I don't feel so guilty eating this one. I'm taking it to a Thanksgiving dinner to which we are invited.

I decided to make a dessert for Thanksgiving and this was the first to catch my eye and it was also the first to disappear from the dessert table! Not my favorite cheesecake, but definitely something I'd make again.  I added some pumpkin pie spice into my graham cracker crust which was a great addition.  I also made a little mistake by adding too much butter with the topping mixture and it looked a bit oily when it came out of the oven (see picture). But it looked and tasted awesome the next day after it had cooled overnight!  P.S. The extra pumpkin butter is perfect on EVERYTHING!

This pie was a hit on Thanksgiving. It was easy to make and I'm still enjoying the pumpkin butter that was left over. I chose this one because it only calls for one bar of cream cheese, as opposed to three. It's not really like a cheesecake but more of a creamy smooth pumpkin pie. Definitely a keeper!

Not really a pumpkin-flavored cheesecake, but more of a creamy pumpkin pie. Used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and it turned out great! Everyone loved it.

Good but no actual pumpkin.  I really like the pumpkin butter.  I also omitted the pecans because I don't really like nuts on my cheesecake.  I would make this year round, but not instead of pumpkin pie.

A huge hit!! I made them individual size by using a ginger snap cookie as the crust in a muffin cup. Turned out great! Only cooked for about 14 minutes.

I think something must have been left out of this recipe because it never rose ...it came out of the oven and it was still about  an inch high....very disappointing.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe! I made it twice for Thanksgiving (for my family & my husband's family), & it was enjoyed by everyone. My dad & brother even said it was the best dessert I've ever made (and I'm always the one in charge of dessert)! It proved to be a bit time-consuming, what with having to make the pumpkin butter & all, but I think the outcome was worth it.

It was tasty, but I love cheesecake, and this just didn't do it for me when it came to the "cheesecake" side of it.  If I wanted a pumpkin pecan pie I would've made that, it tasted like a creamy pumpkin pie, NOT like pumpkin cheesecake.

This was the best pumpkin cheesecake, and the best cheesecake in general, that i've ever had! I've never had pumpkin pie or cheesecake topped with brown sugar or pecans, but it was the perfect toppingto compliment the spicy and creamy pumpkin cheesecake. I can't wait to make it again and pass this recipe on to my friends and kids when i have them XD

Good recipe.  I would say that it's definitely more pumpkin pie-sh and not as cheesecake-y.  A very creamy pumpkin pie.  I really liked the pecan topping, but would recommend cutting it back slightly, there was a little too much topping.  I really liked the pumpkin butter recipe and scaled the recipe back to make just enough for this recipe, plus a little for my toast the next day.  I used 10 oz. pumpkin (2/3 of a 15 oz. can), 1/4 cup apple juice, 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, 1/8 tsp. cloves. I did modify the proportions of the spices to suite my tastes. This resulted in about 1 cup of pumpkin butter.

This dessert is wonderful.  Made it for two Thanksgiving functions and got rave reviews. I agree with another reviewer who said that the pumpkin butter recipe on this page is too strong by itself, but it is great in this dessert and is enough to use for four of these pies.  Once you have that made the rest is easy.

The best pumkin dessert ever.
I never liked pumkin pies. I was hoping while making this recipe for thanksgiving dessert, that It wouldn't taste very pumpkiny. I didn't. I loved it and so did my husband and my in laws.
The only thing I would change next time  is doubling the topping.

I just made these and they are yummy! Because I wanted individual servings, I lined a muffin tin with cupcake liners. At the bottom of each I placed a Nilla wafer in 1/2 of them and a ginger snap cookie in the other half. Both of them were really good, but I love ginger snaps so I preferred that one. Each cup held about 2.5 Tbs of the mix. It made a total of 14. I also used fat free cream cheese and added about 1 Tbs of corn starch. Double the topping as suggested in other reviews.

Oh my god this recipe is to die for!  It is heavenly.  I burnt the top a bit because it was my first experiment with the broiler feature of my oven.  But I picked off the burnt parts and it was amazing.  I will surely make this again next year.

Though I didnt get any negative feedback about this tasty dessert, my one complaint is that it wasnt cheesecakey enough.  It tasted just like pumpkin pie. I will say however the recipe for pumpkin butter was great! I even added a little bit of it into my french toast batter and it gave it a lovely flavor! The cheesecake was good but I definataly expected more chesecake flavor for a cheesecake.

I am neither a pumpkin pie nor a cheesecake fan but LOVED this pie - it is simply divine! I made mine in a 10" deep dish pie pan with homemade graham cracker crust and it was cooked to perfection at 30 minutes. I sprinkled the nut mixture over just half of the pie since my husband can't abide pecans and I really love the topping. If I had to top the entire pie, I would definitely double the topping ingredients. This is going to be our Thanksgiving pie from now on. Finally! I will look forward to dessert! PS I did make my own pumpkin butter for this recipe and think it is well worth the effort!

Being in a hurry, I accidentally put the streusal on prior to baking.  After deciding to just roll with it, I was happily surprised.  It was really good! The topping sank in and tasted like it belonged.  LOL.  Very good.  Like other reviewers, I must agree that this is less like a cheesecake and more like a different-tasting pumpkin pie.  Note that most pumpkin cheesecakes call for two bricks of cream cheese, this is only one.  Still delicious!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was the "most eaten" dessert there.  People just loved this!  My husband, who hates cheesecake, thought it was so good.  I have to say, after you make the pumpkin butter, this is a super simple recipe with a very short list of ingredients!  Just beware:  the pumpkin butter recipe that is listed is just perfect when adding to this recipe, but it (in my opinion) is just too strong by itself.

Holy cow, this is so amazingly yummy!  I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit!

I will admit that I was put off at first that I had to make pumpkin butter in order to make this cheesecake but it was *well worth the extra step*.  It was no problem at all and the pumpkin butter noted in this recipe is also amazing.  Do it...make this dish now!  BTW...I also went ahead and doubled the amount of topping in order to better cover the whole of the pie.

I made this in individual mini graham cracker pie crusts.  It made 12 and worked well as a dessert to take to a party.  No one had to mess with slicing it and everyone loved it. I will say however, that making it this way took away from the pumpkin-y flavor just a bit because the pecan topping was stronger.  Delicious, but stronger.

Very nice recipe.  I made it in individual small graham cracker crusts, which was nice for serving, but made it difficult to contain the pecan topping.

This was very good! My husband said, "Too bad you can't taste the cream cheese." It is a great pie, but not what I would consider cheese cake. The pecans made it extra yummy, don't skimp on those. I used low-fat CC too (could that have been why it did not taste so cream cheese like?) I recommend this recipe for anyone who wants a "new" pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving or Christmas, (or anytime).

This cheesecake is incredible!  I made it a couple of years ago for a holiday party, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I also made the pumpkin butter recipe that was attached, and there was enough left after making the cheesecake to give everyone a small jar to take home with them.  This is definitely one of my favorite cheesecake recipes!

This. Was. Awesome. Everyone gobbled it up and asked me for the recipe.  My recommendation is to let it chill for over a day and serve it room temperature.  First slices we had were after it chilled 8 hrs and served room temp.  Then we ate the final slices the next day and it was even better!  Served with homemade whip cream, this is a winner!

I would have preferred if the pecan topping was more like pecan pie.  I was under the impression this was like a 2-in-1 pie but it was more like a pumpkin cheesecake with pecans on top.  Really good, just not what I was expecting.  I also will double the pecan topping next time I make.

I  made the mini cheescakes in a regulare muffin tin with paper liners.  Put a whole gingersnap cookie on the bottom before filling liner cups instead of a crust.  Added the nut/streusel topping when 10 minutes left to cook.  Excellent.

Easy to make and delicious! I'm not a huge pumpkin fan (but the family is) and even I loved it! It has a creamy texture and the pumpkin flavor is just right. Not too overwhelming. The topping just makes it all the better :)

In one word: AMAZING! This is actually fun to make (and not too complicated once you make the pumpkin butter) and tastes amazing. It got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. I doubled the topping as recommended and it added a lot of sweetness and crunch. I would recommend making a homemade graham cracker crust-it adds a lot of personality. It has just the right amount of pumpkin flavor, too. Thank you, Eleanor! :)

Amazing pie. I doubled the topping, which my family loved. The topping made it a bit too sweet for my taste and I thought it detracted from the pie a bit, but I was the only one (of six) that felt that way. Next time I'll try doubling the entire recipe to see if I can make this a deep-dish pie. So easy, too. What more could you ask for?

Great surprise as I don't like pumpkin pie! So I accidentally had poured in the pecans into the batter (oops), but surprisingly it made it awesome. I still added the pecans on top as well and it had just the right amount of nuts. I'd say next time I would add in less pumpkin butter and a maybe more cream cheese as I didn't taste much cream cheese. Still a keeper either way. Must try it!

I have been making this one for years and it is amazing.  I came on here to find the recipe and decided I should add my input.  I am not a huge fan of pecan pie or pumpkin pie but when you combine it like this it comes out excellent.  This year I have about 5 different families requesting this cheesecake.  I make it just as described and it is very easy.  You won't be disappointed!

This was great! I won my bake off contest with this! Getting requests for it for our next potluck luncheon. So easy and YUMMO! I added extra pecan topping because I just love the good stuff! :-)

This was AMAZING!  I like that it was small ( i.e.only 1 brick of cream cheese).  I also doubled the topping.  It was just a tad sweet, but sooo good.  It was an absolute hit.  In the future, I would like to double the recipe and use a springform pan to give it that authentic cheesecake look.

This is so good I've already made it three more times. Freeze extra pumpkin butter to use next time.

Love the recipe! However cut down on the sugar of the filling. I doubled the recipe and only used 1/2 cup of sugar. Next time i might not add sugar to the filling at all since the pumpkin butter is very sweet. I used the pumpkin butter recipe in the link  of the recipe. I cooked it in the microwave for 6minutes stirred and and cooked another 6min
 Let cool completely.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was so good, I’m making it again for Christmas. I love pecans so I did double the topping. Used Trader Joe’s pumpkin butter and the entire jar is 3/4 cup so no measuring involved. Have to make sure to stock up on it next year because it is seasonal.

We enjoyed this but I felt like it was a bit flat. I felt there wasn't much filling to the pie.  I also had a devil of a time serving it in proper pieces. It just crumbled all over the place. I think I'm going to try it with the filling doubled and in a traditional crust next time.

Made this for Thanksgiving and my family accused me of buying it - they loved it.  We are not fond of graham cracker crumbs so I made the base that I prefer which is 1/2 c butter, 1/3 c sugar, 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1 cup flour,  mixed together til crumbly and then pressed on the bottom and sides of a 9 inch springform pan.    Making the pumpkin butter was easy peasy.  This will definitely be produced again.

Very yummy! I used homemade pumpkin butter made from fresh pumpkin, and put some Spekulatius cookies into the crust (no graham crackers in Germany). I doubled the pecan topping as other reviewers suggested, but I found that it was just too much. When I make it again, I won't be doubling the tooping.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out very well. My sister liked it so much that she demanded I make it for her baby shower the following March. 
I doubled the recipe for the shower (so she could take one home) and it turned out just as well as a single batch. My sister describes her relationship with this cheesecake as "unhealthy," which I take as a compliment. 
Also, the pumpkin butter in this is very good on toast. If you reduce the sugar it could be probably be considered healthy too.

Really good! Be careful if you use a bigger springform pan to double the recipe.

I made this and it came out delicious. The only thing I would change is adding another pack of cream cheese.
