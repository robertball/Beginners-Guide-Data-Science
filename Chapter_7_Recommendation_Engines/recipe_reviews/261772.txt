Delicious.  This was so tasty... I had it by itself and also in  wrap.  Good even without BBQ sauce. It's got a lot of sweetness so if you do use a BBQ sauce, I'd use a spicy one rather than sweet

Excellent flavor and a cinch to make.  I did leave out the salt.  There is enough in the bacon to suit my taste and like in so many flavorful recipes such as this, there is no need to add the 2000+ grams of sodium found in a teaspoon of salt.

FANTASTIC recipe! Made it just as written, although my tenderloins were about 2.8 lbs. Wonderful flavor, even without sauce as so may have stated. I did make a spiced up version of 'Big Al's KC Bar-B-Q Sauce' from this site and that just put it over the top. This is my recipe for pulled pork from now on! Thanks so much for sharing.

This didn't need bacon or BBQ sauce ! 
I used jack Daniels winter Jack for the bourbon. Put cole slaw on top (just because) and it was amazing! Truly the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. My husband agrees completely. You knocked it out of the ballpark with this one !

This was delicious and loved by all ages in our family.  I followed the recipe but eliminated the salt, as suggested by other reviewers.  I added the crispy bacon and BBQ sauce to the shredded pork, and served it with white rice and tortillas.  This was so good!  Everyone wants me to make it again and again!  I will!

I did make this recipe, with two pork loins, the only thing that I discluded was the salt and bourbon. I found that it was very Bland. A little bit of a disappointment. In the end I had to doctor it up so that it had flavour. I just don't think I would make this again.

This far exceeded expectations in ease and flavor. The pork just fell apart on me when I went to turn it in the crockpot, and I let it cook another couple of hours shredded in the juice. It was so flavorful (a little on the sweet side) I just ate it straight without bothering with the bacon or bbq sauce. I will probably add a bbq sauce  when I do the left overs as a sandwich.

Loved this!  I made in instapot but used all same ingredients. Instead of BBQ sauce, I served on buns with Pepper Bacon Jam that I had. Delicious!!!

Made exactly as written but forgot the bacon in the end (hah!) but it was super yummy! Didn't need bacon. It was really sweet. Topped with coleslaw was awesome! Whole family loved.

I have made this many times for just me and my hubby and a friend with an ill husband... all to rave reviews. I do use 2 tsp Liquid Smoke as do some of the other reviewers. It adds a great depth of flavor.  It is now my "go-to" recipe for pulled pork.

I made this twice, once for my sister and once for my son and grandson.  They all loved it, as did I.  The only thing I would add is to turn the loin halfway through cooking, if possible.

It was easy, no argument there. Disappointed in this since it had three of my favorite foods. But it was too sweet, and there was no heat. Didn't taste any bourbon in the end (and would like my half cup of bourbon back pls). Won't make this again.

No changes. Definitely again. 
Great taste tender and juicy. 
Eight hours for a two pound pork is perfect.

Would most definitely make again. It was amazing. I used both light and dark brown sugar. Gave it a nice deep taste.

I made this as written. It was easy and very tasty! A nice change from traditional pulled pork. I also like that it was made with pork loin (I used tenderloin since I wasn't sure if this meant a loin roast or a tenderloin) instead of pork butt, which tends to be fattier. Will definitely be adding this to my recipe file!

Even though we LOVE bacon, will likely omit in future as we didn't find it really added anything.  Also, we like a BIG punch of flavor so doubled the garlic/onion.  Delish--so good that I made another batch the next day!!!

Delicious, easy! My family can't wait for the next time I make it. If you like leftovers, you may want to double the recipe.

What a waste of Makers Mark. There is nothing special about this pulled pork recipe. We used it for tacos. I added cilantro and onion as a topping and those had more flavor than the meat.

This was an amazing dish. We put it on a bun with some Rudy's barbecue sauce and jalapeno bacon and it was a huge hit.

I made 15lbs of pulled pork using this recipe just by Addis my proportions. It was amazing and the hit of the party! I did forget the bacon but no one knew and it was all gone! No leftovers. Bummed a bit but it showed how delicious it was. Even with all the bourbon in it, it went great with our Tanglerose backyard red Cabernet. Thanks, Rod

I used this pulled pork recipe exactly as given over the Memorial Day holiday and it was a big hit!  The bourbon and bacon added a great, subtle flavor. I did use extra Sweet Baby Ray’s - Sweet ‘n Spicy sauce after shredding the pork because my family likes a little extra sauce. We always add coleslaw to our sandwiches too. This will be my new “go to” recipe for pulled pork. Thank you!

I made this recipe tonight for supper and it was a HUGE hit.  I followed the directions exactly with the only exception is that I used Stevia Brown Sugar rather then regular brown sugar.  I loved it just the way it was, and didn't add more BBQ sauce to it.  Others in my family did add some to theirs.  The BBQ sauce used was Sweet Baby Rays.  Everyone raved about this pulled pork and it was nice using pork loin in the recipe as it wasn't as fatty as other cuts of meat.  Will be making them many more times!

FYI: Your time is labelled as an 8 minute cook time, not hours. 

I look forward to the recipe!
