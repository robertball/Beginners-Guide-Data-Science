This satisfying and filling breakfast in a  potato is easily a five star recipe. I went ahead and mixed the eggs, bacon, and sausage together. Will definitely make again and top with pico de gallo or a few shakes  of hot sauce.

These are pretty good but I think it would have been quicker and easier to chop up a potatoe and fry it... just saying...

I have made it two times.  My family asks for it again and again.  As the cook's note says, the options are many for this recipe.

It was awesome. I make an everything breakfast with all the same ingredients but with fried potatoes. This was definately less work and not as time consuming
