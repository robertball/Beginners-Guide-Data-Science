This was the first time my husband or myself had tasted pumpkin pie. (We're not American.)  It was good, although very sweet.  Definitely try again!

Absolutely wonderful. I used fresh ginger as I didn't have any ground ginger. This is my new best recipe.

I made this as it was the closest recipe to the one I used to make as a kid.  I did substitute brown sugar for the white sugar and switched the measurements for milk and evaporated milk.  It makes a creamier custard and gives a better flavor.  Just like when I was a kid.
