Added potatoes instead of mushrooms because thatâ€™s what I had on hand. This soup is really, really good. This is another meal for otherwise fussy eaters.

This was good! I personally think it needs some more seasoning/salt and more hot sauce but to each their own. Go with what you like and you can't go wrong!
