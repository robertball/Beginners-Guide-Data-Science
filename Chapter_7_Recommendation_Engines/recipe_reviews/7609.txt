i've been making this cake for years and people request it now!  Jell-O brand does not make blackberry, it's Royal brand that does.  Royal can be found at some smaller stores, but i substitue half black cherry, half black raspberry and it turns out just fine.  the glaze should be cool and the cake not hot or it will be runny.  it should look like the glaze on a donut.  i use 2 loaf pans or 6 mini loaf pans instead, and leave out the nuts.  mmmmm smells great!

The reason I am giving this recipe a low rating is because the blackberry gelatin is impossible to find.
I even called Kraft Foods and they told me it had been discontinued.
Does anyone out there have a good substitute they have tried in this recipe?
Sounds great and I would love to make it!

The cake tasted great, would have been 5 star if not for the glaze!I made the recipe glaze the first time-BLAH! The second time i put a stick of butter, i cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water in a pan and boiled it until it thickened. Then i took it off the heat, let it cool for about 3 minutes and added a cup of blackberry wine. I left the cake in the pan and poured the glaze on the cake and in the pan. I also used half grape,half raspberry jello in place of the blackberry jello.

Since blackberry jello is no longer available, I use 1/3 C of blackberry JELLY instead, and it works really great.  This glaze is whack, though.  I just dust with powdered sugar instead and serve with blackberries and heavy whipped cream.

I had my doubts about this one, but I had all of the ingredients (except I used black cherry gelatin).  Turned out very good, and went over well at the office.  I did have trouble blending the glaze, and found warming the wine first helped melt the butter.

This is a great cake! I have also tried raspberry wine and raspberry Jello-O and it is wonderful. Just a few tweaks to the glaze...I use 1 1/4 c powdered sugar and add 1/4c water. I poke holes with my long tined fork immediately after taking the cake out of the oven. After cooling for 10 minutes, I take the cake out of the pan, pour 1/2 of the glaze in the bottom of the pan, return the cake to the pan and pour the remaining glaze over the bottom of the cake. Then I cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit overnight in the pan. Turn out the next morning onto your cake plate. It is so nice and moist! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I left out the nuts. The cake is nice and moist and has a lovely pink color to it. Perfect for a tea party, bridal shower or book club event. Instead of pouring the second half of the icing over the cake, I brushed it on with a pastry brush every 15 minutes until it was all gone. This resulted in beautifully laquered look.

The cake came out great.  Before I made this I asked several people and they suggested going for the alternative glaze recipe as shown on this website "Blackberry Wine Cake II".  Those two combinations makes a  good Blackberry Wine Cake!

YES!!! to the cake NO!!! to the glaze.  Done exactly as the recipe indicated, it would NOT incorporate.  I had to put the it on top the stove and heat it to get the butter to work into it.  Then the whole lot was WAAAAY to liquid (even after cooling for hours) so I had to add at least a cup more powdered sugar.  If it were to make this again, I'd start the glaze by creaming the (soft) butter and sugar first. THEN adding only as much wine as necessary to make a good consistency.  I couldn't find blackberry wine or Jello so I made a raspberry version.  Good taste!

Blackberry Jello is unavailable, but Blackberry Fusion Jello is available and tastes amazing. Second, you need to melt the butter for the glaze, it really doesn't work otherwise, and melting it doesn't hurt anything in the recipe. Good luck.

made with black cherry jello I had on hand and the black cherry wine that my dear husband brought me when I asked him to bring home a bottle of sherry for my fresh green bean casserole recipe!  lol! Well, turned into a pretty yummy mistake.
followed other reviewers tips on a successful glaze and everyone liked!

I halved the butter for the glaze.  I found red raspberry/blackberry Jello brand gelatin, so I used that.  I made this cake for my family Thanksgiving gathering.  Everyone said it was good, but maybe could have used more glaze because it wasn't evenly moist, and the moister parts were better.  I personally think it had a funny aftertaste, but I would like to experiment with the recipe. Maybe next time I'll try orange gelatin and orange juice.

Delicious! I could not find blackberry jello so I subbed raspberry. We were given some homemade blackberry wine so this was a perfect recipe to try out. Made this for hubby and he loved it. I did not make the glaze instead just tossing the blackberries in sugar and placing on top. Thanks.

Impossible to find blackberry jello so I substitute raspberry jello instead.  I have never been able to get the glaze the way I would like it but regardless of how the glaze turns out the cake is always wonderful.

I absolutely love this recipe!  It's easy and consistently makes a great cake!  Everyone is super fascinated that it has wine in it and it's a conversation piece.  I have swapped out different flavors of wine sometime I use the Maninschewitz Cherry or Elderberry Flavors. For the first time I used a strawberry cake mix because I could not find white mix. I know some folks are worried about no longer being able to find blackberry Jello. I use any kind of dark berry family flavor...i.e. black cherry, raspberry, black raspberry, berry fusion and others. This last time I made the cake and ran out of the blackberry wine, I had enough for the batter for the cake but not the glaze. I happened to have some Moscato wine & some Raspberry schnapps (razzmatazz). I blended the two together maybe a fourth cup of each to make the half cup I needed for the glaze. It was awesome...my husband actually like this doctored version even better. My other tip is once you remove the cake from the pan, I make the glaze(I actually melt the butter) and put it into the still warm pan. I then place the cake back in the pan, upside down and let it sit and soak up the glaze like a sponge. Check in about 45 mins, and then I refrigerate the cake, keeping it cool helps with the moisture.

This cake is delicious! Moist with lots of flavor!  I used a homemade blackberry wine and I didn't have any problems finding blackberry jello.  I found the Jell-O brand blackberry at meijer this morning.  It's the blackberry fusion gelatin.
