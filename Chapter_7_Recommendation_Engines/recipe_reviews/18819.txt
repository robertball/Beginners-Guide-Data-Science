this was awesome. Instead of soaking the eggplant in salt water, though I chopped it up, put it in a collander, and sprinkled salt on it. Then i let it sit for about an hour and rinsed it off. Not only does this work a lot better, but it saved time! Also, I threw a carrot or two in. I ran out of garlic so I just threw some garlic powder in and it seemed to work just as well.

This was so delicious!!  I did not soak the eggplant though, because I thought it would be too limp. It came out great anyway.  The other reveiwer was right about the portion size.  I cut it down to a three serving size and it still made six to eight servings.

Very tasty.  Way too much food, though.  Scaled down the recipe considerably.  
The vegetables are GREAT wrapped in a tortilla.  Really enjoyed the flavor and heats up well.  Even
my non-vegetarian friends like it.

We had a dinner party for four, two were vegetarians. I halved this recipe and added a couple other vegetables to the mix..carrots, butternut squash. Also omitted the eggplant. We placed the vegetables on a big platter on the table, had heated honey wheat pitas and different toppings. (shredded lettuce, feta cheese, olives, chopped scallions, cucumber ranch dressing.) Everyone was able to prepare their pita to their own taste. It was a festive hit!

I thought this was wonderful!  What a great blend of flavors.  I modified it a little, using less eggplant and substituting zucchini, omitting mushrooms, etc.  The recipe is very forgiving and works well, staying withing the basic proportions of the ingredients.  I decreased cooking time, cranking up the heat a little because I was on a deadline, and it was still great.  With the higher heat, mine came out a little on the roasted side, so it was hard to recognize what each of the vegetables were, but I found that to our advantage with the kids.  It became a melange of wonderful flavors!

I'm not a vegetarian but with recipes like this, I could easily be convinced to become one. This is an OUTSTANDING recipe. I substituted butternut squash for the summer squash and scaled it down to 3 servings. I cooked it in my Pampered Chef stonewear casserole and it came out perfectly. I made "Peppy's Pita Bread" (recipe on this site) to go along with this and I just couldn't get over the flavor of this dish. Wonderful...thank you!

This is a very tasty recipe.  However, it takes some time to assemble and is difficult to determine when it is fully cooked.  The directions should be clearer

I'm glad I took the advice to cut the recipe in half--however, it still made 20 servings!  It was wonderful, though.  I used a 28-ounce can of plum tomatoes, undrained, rather than the fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I also used dried spices.

I REALLY LOVED THIS RECIPE AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE EGGPLANT THAT MUCH.  IT WAS REALLY QUICK TO PREPARE EXCEPT FOR THE EGGPLANT AND SIMPLE TO MAKE.  DEFINITELY A WINNER.

This was delicious! I cut down recipe for two and it could have easily fed four! I substituted zucchini from my garden for the squash, added shredded carrots and instead of the can of tomato sauce I used a can of organic whole peeled tomatoes which I cut up before pouring on top prior to putting in the oven. I found the veggies gave off enough liquid so I did not add any water. During the last five minutes I topped it with smoked mozzarella & some parmesan/romano cheese until bubbly. I served it with a brown rice medley from Trader's Joes and garnished the plate with sliced avocado. It was a wonderful meal!!!

Made the 9 serving version of this recipe with a few alterations:  One butternut squash for 2 summer squash, used the whole can of tomato sauce, added about 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar and dropped the cooking time down to 1 1/2 hour.  Turned out VERY well.  My roommate described it as "one of the best things he's ever eaten."

This is very tasty and healthy dish. The reason for keeping eggplant in water is to avoid blackness which comes with oxidation. All the other veggies doesn't take time to cook, but eggplant does, so I cut one eggplant, put in a bowl, add half a cup of water and microvwave them for 4 minutes. Then I drained them, and mix everything and baked them for 1.5 hours. Switched off the oven and left it there for another hour or so, they came out perfact. Filled Pita pocket with veggies and Feta cheese, even kids ate them up!!!

I was hoping for something more from this but it was pretty bland. I scaled it down to 6 servings. It is certainly edible and healthy so it gets 3 stars. If I made it again, I would have to add more tomato sauce and up the seasoning and garlic.

Really tasty. I only made a quarter of the recipe, and added more herbs than listed. I didn't have any green beans of mushrooms,  but it was still good. I think next time I would bake the potatoes for a little while first or boil them for a few minutes, then add the rest of the veggies. I don't like mushy veggies, and the squash and eggplant cooked through much faster than the potatoes.

This is excellent.  I used a quarter of the vegetables in recipe & it still filled half a turkey roasting pan. Salted & sweated eggplant for sev hours ahead, then rinsed.  Used red bell peppers & red skinned potatoes. Omitted dill & used 1/4 cup each of fresh basil & oregano, increased olive oil to 1/2 cup & used about 10 oz of really good jarred tom sauce.  Did not need extra water, but stirred once 1/2 way through.  Done in about 2 hours. Added fresh parsley at end. Served up in bowls for dinner...family lapped it up!

Somehow it never ocurs to me to make a veggie casserole. It's unnatural somehow - but do not be mistaken, this is a great recipe. I re-sized this for 2, and used Vidalia mushrooms, onions, zuchini, summer squash, and green beans - omitting the eggplant, potato, bell peppers, and tomatoes based on 'low carb' and personal preference. Easy, fast (It only took 35 minutes back time for 2 servings). Thanks for sharing!

I skipped the eggplant and didn't have pasta sauce around so on a whim I used a small can of pizza sauce (I significantly decreased the serving size) and it turned out wonderful! I also served it in tortillas as another reviewer had done. This will definitely be going into my regular summer rotation!

This reminds me of my favorite ratatouille recipe, only with even more flavors. It reheats well, and I love to reheat, put it on a kaiser roll with a slice of brie and broil just till the cheese begins to melt.

I made this last night and altered it slightly. I obviously put it to calculate a lower serving size and still ended up with 2 pans worth: 1 9x13, 1 8x8.  I used 3 small red potatoes, b/c I do not eat them--only my husband & child do.  2 small eggplant (of 2 varieties) and I did salt & place in a colander (rather than water) and it worked just fine for me.  I ended up using 2 8 oz. cans of no salt added tomato sauce, which was perfect, and dried herbs.  I limited my salt b/c I knew I'd add feta after it cooked.  1 lrg. green pepper, 1 med. onion, 3 summer squash, 2/3 pint mr, 1/2 pound green beans, 6 garlic cloves, and the amt. of spices indicated for 6 servings.  
It cooked for about an hour and was perfect!  My husband had seconds, as did I.  My child doesn't like eggplant, so he ate around that.  We served it over brown rice and it was delicious!  I would definitely make this again!!

Very good!  I salted my eggplant in a collander rather than soaking it - took much less time.  I decreased the recipe to about 4 servings but still used all of the 8 oz can of tomato sauce (didn't want to waste it), which I would definitely do again.  If you significantly decrease the serving size, I would suggest decreasing the cooking time - after about 1 1/2 hours, my veggies were starting to burn.  Oh, and I served it with toasted pitas and feta cheese - wonderful!

Great recipe.  Can't beat it with all of the fresh stuff.  I reduced it to one 9 x 12 pan and used asparagus instead of eggplant.  Very adaptable.

This recipe did not work for me.  I cute the veges into 2" cubes and they looked awful BIG to me but I prepared the dish that way anyway.  Well, the potatoes did not cook very well so we ate around them, and the other veges were too big, we had to cut them up.  Flavor was bland but we had it with Tzatziki sauce, which helped.  Good luck!

Really Good, Really Healthy, served withPita, Feta cheese and Ranch dressing. I printed recipe to serve 8, and used fresh cilantro and Italian Parsley instead of dill.  Also, added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, low sodium.  Then just added a little water half way through. Yummy!

This recipe is absolutely delicious, and probably one of the best vegetable/vegan dishes on this site!  I scaled it down to 5 and I have at least 8 servings.  I added a bit more tomato sauce to the veggies.  In my oven they were done at 1.5 hours, not 2.5.  If you have the full batch it will take longer probably.  Also the veggies cooked down to about a third of what they were initially in the pan.  It's not summer so I had to swap summer squash for zucchini and leave out the tomatoes, but I definitely plan on making this again when veggies are really in season.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe!

This was delicious!!! Although we aren't vegan, I'm always looking for recipes that omit the meat and dairy without sacrificing flavor, and this definitely fits the bill.  Note that this recipe serves 36!!!  I made a quarter of the recipe, and barely fit into my huge roasting pan (needless to say, the pan measurements in the recipe don't appear to be correct). I followed the recipe except for replacing tomato sauce with 3 cans of fire roasted tomatoes.  Since I like a little kick, I also added a few teaspoons of cayenne pepper.  Yummmm!

This recipe is fabulous. I just made it tonight. I definitely cut this recipe down to 1 each of the vegetables used as I made this for myself alone. The roasted garlic really made a huge difference and this turned out to be fantastic. I just used the concept of this recipe - not measuring the herbs and such - I did soak the eggplant as suggested. I will say that when I added the water half-way through I added too much, but now I know for next time. I simply drained it at the end....I did add a tiny bit of Parmesan cheese to the top during the last half. I also found that the vegetables were more than cooked at 2 hours and I pulled them out. (Most likely because I had a much smaller portion.)

This was so delicious!!  I will be making this one again!!  I used sweet potatoes instead of regular, and used more tomato sauce and olive oil.  I covered the pan with foil and cooked for about an hour and a half. Use the fresh herbs as the recipe indicates...it does make a difference! I served it up with some feta cheese and warm pita bread.  Delicious! 
Definitely scaled this recipe down.

Very tasty but difficult to down-size for a family of 6.  Labor intensive with cleaning and cutting vegetables.

I thought this recipe was FANTASTIC!!!!!! Alot of food though, so I cut it in half. Great with pita bread or couscous. I took it to work for lunch for a week, never got tired of eating it!! Tastes even better on 2nd day, when flavors have the opportunity to blend longer.

Made a smaller batch for my family of 5 1/2.  8 B-sized red potatoes, 2 small eggplants, 1 large zucchini, 2 tomatoes, 1 small onion, 1 cup mushrooms, kept the garlic about the same...small can tomato sauce and 1/3 cup olive oil.

Boiled potatoes in advance, then put them in the pan as layer one and sprinkled a bit of garlic salt on top.  Mixed the oil, tomato sauce, and herbs together and tossed the other veggies with that before adding to the pan as layer two.  Baked at 375 for 1 1/2 hours and it was awesome!

Left the skin on the eggplant.  I didn't have summer squash. Changed the serving size to 9.  PERFECT AMOUNT for a family of 4, and there are plenty of leftovers.  No need to add water half way.  I cooked on the middle rack for 1 hour on 400.  Smelt good, and tasted great.

I chose this recipe to use the abundance of veggies from my CSA box. Chopping all the veggies was labor intensive, but it came out tasty. I reduced the serving size to 12 instead of 36, but still ended up with two large pans full. Lots of leftovers. I also chopped veggies a bit smaller than instructed, and this shortened the cooking time by about 30-45 minutes. BF and I had it by itself, over fresh pasta with a little extra sauce, and as a topping on homemade pizza. Overall a good dish and versatile as well, but really nothing spectacular.

I'd just been to the farm picking vegetables this weekend, so I made this. The vegetables kind of steam and roast at the same time, so they get tender, but there are some nice, caramelized bits in there for more flavor. Today, I'm having leftovers on a pita with some homemade goat cheese.

I am definitely going to make this recipe.  My only problem is downsizing it to a meal for two or four people.  Downsizing option does not adjust the cooking time.  I may omit the eggplant to save prep time

I was surprised by the negative comments since this is a very basic recipe.

This was a really good recipe, although I had to turn the heat down because the outside of the vegetables were cooking before the inside (but I live in high altitude, 5300 ft).  I suggest eating it with rice!  

After making it according to the recipe the first time, I added more tomato sauce the next time and I left out the squash and added more potatoes instead.

This recipe is very adaptable; it's easy to make it how you like!

I don't understand what the big deal is with this recipe. It's just some oven cooked veggies with tomato sauce. It took sooooo long to cook (almost 3 hrs) even though I halved the recipe! I knew I had to give it some time in the oven, but geez, by the time I was able to serve this with the rest of dinner, everyone was starving and pretty P...ed off. And still everyone hated it. What a waste. I would've had better results if I'd just sauted the veggies in a pan with salt and butter.  WILL NOT MAKE AGAIN!!

I scaled this down to 9 servings from 36; I found I only had to bake 1.5 hours. For extra liquid, I added a little red cooking wine diluted with water. I sprinkled feta cheese when serving for extra flavor. Will make again

It's not really a casserole; it's a big serving of lots of good and tasty vegetables and tubers with some excellent flavor.  I used FRESH not dried spices.  My vegetarian friends loved it!  And it's lactose free!

I made this for a neighbor's family who has one vegetarian daughter, and they all raved about it.  My family enjoyed it as well, although we are meateaters in general.  It has to be cut way back in proportions to be reasonable for a normal dinner at home, and you can really add any vegetables you like to it.  It's awesome.

I don't know what went wrong but this dish did NOT turn out to be what I thought it should be (based on the ratings).  I followed the recipe exactly with 2 exceptions: the eggplants were in the water for nearly 4 instead of 3 hours; I used dried instead of fresh herbs/spices.  The dish turned out to be bitter and not much else.  Quite disappointing. Definitely won't make this again.

It took me a long time to chop the vegetables, the squash was particularily hard.  I made pita bread with a bread mix and the dough selection on my breadmaker, then rolled it out to 8 circles and pan fried them in a dry pan.  I put mozzarella cheese and low fat ranch dressing on the vegetable pita's, and they were awesome.  I couldn't wait to have one for lunch today, well worth the effort!!

This is a very flexible recipe.  I used zucchini, a red pepper, and a yellow pepper instead of the summer squash, grean beans and green pepper.  I adjusted the seasonings since I didn't have any dill and also added few sundried tomatoes in oil that I wanted to use up.  I probably used a little more olive oil than the recipe originally called for and more tomatoes but no tomato sauce. We had it on naan flatbread with feta cheese sprinkled on top. Very tasty!  I will definitely make it again.

This was quite good--a less tomato-ey ratatouille.  The house smelled great while it cooked.  That being said, we both thought the recipe needed "something", maybe some balsamic vinegar?  The addition of chipotle Tabasco added a needed kick to some of the leftovers.  Even modifying this for 8 servings, it's still a lot of food. I think the three stars is more because I'm getting bored eating it.    I probably will remove the potatoes and freeze the rest.

I love vegetables.  But this was awful.  I served it for dinner to a group of friends and I was embarrassed by how bad this was.  I adjusted for less servings, but I followed the recipe to a "T."  It was lackluster, bland and not worth the time.

For a vegitarian meal that has everything in it , it was a delicious meal.  If you put some sliced sausages in it to at the end it will satisfice a meat eater ( just broil the sausage, slice and serve on top).

This was an awsome recipe! I give it two thumbs up. I cut it way down and it was great.

Delicious! I added fresh parmesan cheese to the top as one of the other reviewers suggested. It made a lot, but it was superb!

The veggies are great but as a side dish. Must reduce the serving size!

LOVE this.  So easy, super delicious.  I made two modifications to utilize ingredients I had in my pantry.  I used a jar of marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce, and I used half a jar of Trader Joe's Red Pepper spread with eggplant and garlic, because I only had a few fresh mini red peppers.

This was absolutely INCREDIBLE! My husband raved about it and didn't even miss having meat. It was very filling and very flavorful, yet it was so very simple and easy to make. Win win all the way around! Will definitely be adding this to the recipes we make over and over. :)

Excellent.  Cut the recipe WAY down to serve a family of four.  Freezes well.

I soaked the eggplant in salted water (to "draw out the bitterness") like the recipe stated, but it was still bitter.  Next time I'll replace it with extra potatoes or just leave the eggplant out completely.  It's definitely worth a second try, though.

This is soooo good! My husband & I are vegetarians & we both really enjoyed this dish. I reduced the recipe to “5 servings” & a roasting pan was the perfect size to bake it in. I covered it while baking & it took 2 hours. I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce, since I wanted it to have a bit of “broth” & a red bell pepper, since I didn’t have a green one; but, other than that, I used what the recipe called for. I served it with warm, crusty French bread & it made a very satisfying meal...I’ll be adding this to our regular rotation of “go to” meals.

The veggies were not getting dry, so we followed the recipe, using tomato puree.  However, they burned to the bottom of the glass casserole.  They were done in less than 2 hours.

Giving it two stars because I could definitely eat it.

First of all, I trimmed this recipe WAY down because I don't have 36 people to feed. Kept the proportions about the same and followed everything to a T other than cook time (since I made about a 6th of what the recipe does). 

I really do like the seasoning blend, but everything else was sub par. I have absolutely no idea why you would need to add water. Mine came out soggy and had a ton of water in the bottom of the casserole dish.

What is a "chunk", by the way? Are we talking 2 inch cubes? If so I don't think the potatoes would have ever cooked until the rest of the ingredients became complete mush. I cut the "chunks" in half after about an hour so that I could still potentially foresee being able to eat the rest of the dish. 

Maybe I just suck at cooking, but I have successfully made every recipe I've deemed worthy of trying on this site without issue. 

Something isn't quite right with the recipe and I'm pretty astounded that it has such a fantastic rating.

This was pretty good, but it makes sooooo much! I halved the recipe and I still had so many leftovers I could not even give them away! Gave it three stars just because I don't know if the taste is worth all of the veggie prep.

I love this recipe. I make it again and again. The only changes I make are to add Greek seasoning to it and serve it with a sprinkling of Feta cheese. I does make a lot but you can change the servings according to your needs.

I agree on the portion size. Too much for two of us. I'll be freezing a bit of it. I used Japanese eggplant and all the veggies from my garden. I did not put in green beans or potatoes. It came out great anyway! Also, I grated pecorino romano cheese on top for garnish. I'll be making again and again.

This is delicious.  Leftovers taste even better.  The recipe makes a lot. I adjusted recipe to 5 and still had to cut  out the green beans and mushrooms, only because no more would fit in my baking pan.  I will be making again and again.  i did not soak the eggplant just removed the skin and chopped. (the skin is the bitter part)

This is awesome!  I can't explain why it tastes so wonderful, because it is really just a bunch or roasted vegetables, however, it works!!  Using fresh herbs really brings out flavour.  I sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on it, or vegan cheese to keep it vegan!   Everyone in my family, plus teenagers and friends love this.  I make it time an time again, and it's a huge hit.

My family loves this recipe. I followed another review and put the eggplant in a bowl added 1/4 cup of water and microwaved for 4 minutes. I adjusted the veggies to fit our tastes. I add a 1/2 cup of lentils, that have been soaked for 5-10 min., and an entire bottle of marinara sauce (instead of 1/4 cup). We eat this dish with parathas.

This was ok, but not fabulous. I scaled it back to 4 servings, which was still enough for 8, in my opinion, and cooked for only 1.5 hours, which was  plenty. Served topped with a dollop of plain Greek yogurt on toasted whole wheat pitas for a healthy vegetarian meal. Thanks!

I was really disappointed in the way it turned out.  Everything looked so fresh and yummy before hitting the oven.  This came out way too mushy for my family.  Maybe I should have cut down on the cooking time too.  I scaled it down to 3 servings and still had way too many unwanted leftovers.
