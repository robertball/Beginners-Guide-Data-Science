Made this yesterday and it was a huge hit! It has a cheesecake like texture with a hint of lime. Sooo good and so easy! I will make this again!

I cut the recipe in half and made 6 mini pies. I could taste the avocado or could it be because I knew it was there? It is creamy but I don't think it is cheesecake-like. There is a hint of lime but it does not taste like a key lime pie. It was fun to experiment with this but I won't be making it again.

It was fine, creamy texture and very light taste. I like avocado but don't think I would make it again.

Very good.  I used low fat cream cheese, fat free condensed milk and 1/2 cup key lime juice (instead of lemon and regular lime juice).  Tasted like a creamy key lime pie.  Very easy recipe.

This was a fun and simple pie to make. However it doesn't get all eaten in the same day, it browns.

The first time I made it it was a bit overwhelming, very rich.  Second time I used less sweetened condensed milk, used a regular crust, and added a bit of extra lime juice and fresh blueberries on top.  A few more tweaks and I may give it five stars--like reduced fat cream cheese (I used 2% sweetened condensed milk the second time).

This  pie is amazing! My whole family loved it. I took the advice or other reviewers by tripling the lime juice and doubling the lemon; I also served it on a coconut graham cracker crust with coconut whipped cream. The results were divine! 
Before I blended everything I thought to soak my avocado in the lime and lemon juice; I figured that might keep the pie from browning .  Three days after making/first cutting into the pie, it stayed that pretty pale green. Will definitely make again.

Trust me and try it.  Even though I love avocados, this does not taste like plain avocados in a pie crust.   I love this!  It is just the right amount of sweetness topped with whipped cream.  I did adjust the recipe as follows:  I tripled the amount of lime and doubled the amount of lemon juice.

For some real decadence, I whipped heavy cream with a little sugar added into a beautiful topping and covered the entire pie top and garnished with a few lemon and lime slices dipped in granulated sugar before placing it in the refrigerator.  Yummy!

Tip:  Make the filling according to the recipe and then adjust filling ingredients to taste, i.e. taste it and then add a little more juice if you want.  Even with my adjustments, the filling was firm after chilled in refrigerator.

The consistency reminds me of cheesecake and the color is beautiful. The flavor was a little hard for me to get used to. It is very easy to make and I will try to make it again with a different fruit...maybe bananas.
