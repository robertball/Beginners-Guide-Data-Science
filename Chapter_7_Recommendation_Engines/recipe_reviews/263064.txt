Overall really good! 

I think it would pair well with almost any way you want to make the steak, I grilled ours since I was grilling the corn. Might try a lime marinade for the steak next time, though.

Definitely don't leave off the feta, it really added a nice savory flavor to the sweeter-than-expected dressing. 

Otherwise wouldn't change a thing, the flavors went excellently together.

This was really really good! Wonderful summer salad, fresh and the dressing was so simply and good! Followed the recipe exactly for the dressing, boyfriend loved it and would for sure make it again. To the salad I did put in some avocado as well!

We loved this salad!  I prepared all the veggies and the dressing ahead of time, and then was able to enjoy a glass of wine with my love while he grilled the steak.  The cilantro and lime add so much freshness to the dish- it’s perfect for summer evenings outside.

I made this recipe as listed.  I did find the dressing made fresh had a bit strong cilantro taste.  But the next day, wow it was so much better!  So my only suggestion would be to make the dressing a day ahead if you can.  Elsewise, this recipe has become our favorite for a weekly dinner.   It’s pretty on the plate, and has excellent flavors.  Thx for a great recipe!
