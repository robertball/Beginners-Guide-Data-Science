we call this fluff in my house!  We totally love it...only thing we do differently is we don't cream the cottage cheese...it all just gets dumped in a bowl and mixed...yummy!!!  oh and we use all kinds of different flavors...and if you want to get real bold...use crystal light instead of jello!

At my house we always called it dump salad, and we added a small can of drained pineapple tidbits with our lime flavored jello. YUM!

This is one of my favorite "church potluck" recipes. I know it as "green stuff", made with lime jello and mini colored marshmallows. Good stuff. A must have at any family potluck, church dinner or holiday gathering! NOTE: You can pretty much use any SF jello you prefer. It's good with just about any.

We have always used strawberry jell-o and a can of drained crushed pineapple in the cottage cheese and whipped topping.  Just dump it all in a bowl and mix, no food processor needed.  We call it "pink stuff" and all the cousins fight over it at gatherings!  You can also add chopped pecans for texture but my kids rather I didn't.  Enjoy!

I have been eating this since I was a child.  It is a staple at every family gathering or holiday.  We have found the best flavor jello to use is orange, and to add a couple cans of manadarin oranges.  We also just throw it all into a bowl, don't do anything to the cottage cheese.  The kids usually prefer the regular kind--cottage cheese, regular cool whip, and regular jello(1-2 boxes depending on how bold you like it).  The orange recipe also works with this low cal version of course.  Another good flavor is strawberry jello and fresh(or drained frozen)strawberries.

This makes a nice snack. I used strawberry jello and only used one box (I think two boxes would make it too sweet). I also added sliced strawberries and used light cottage cheese and light cool whip. A dessert or snack that won't make you feel guilty.

SO GOOD! With orange jello it tastes like dreamcicles.    I used Sugar Free whipped topping instead of light. No difference in taste.

I wish I could rate this higher ... but it was just ok.  I used regular gelatin mix (I don't like my family to have the artificial sweetener that's in the SF).  It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be (despite the sugar in the jello mix) and the cottage cheese made it taste grainy.  My 3 year old loved it, but my 1 1/2 year old wouldn't eat it (and she eats everything!)  Maybe if I don't process the cottage cheese like other reviewers mentioned and it won't be as grainy?

I haven't had this dessert in years--My grandmother made it as a special treat.  She used apricot jello which has become difficult to find.  Also, it works fine without pureeing the cottage cheese.

We've been making this dish for years, usually during holidays. We use orange jello and add a large can of crushed pineapple and a small can of mandarin oranges, both well drained. I also drain the cottage cheese. It's quick, simple and looks beautiful in a glass trifle dish or other pretty dish. Everyone loves it!

Quick...easy...what more can you want in a dessert? I happened to have all the ingredients in my pantry. Bonus!  I used mango-flavored gelatin. WOW! I bet this would be great served with sliced mango on top. I didn't cream the cottage cheese first, I just dumped everything in a bowl and mixed it. If you use regular gelatin instead of sugar-free, make sure to let it sit for 5-10 mins for the sugar to dissolve. I made half the recipe to start. It was so good that I just dumped the remaining ingredients in and made a full batch!

I first began making this dessert in the 70's and have used Cherry, Strawberry, Lemon, Lime and Orange Jell-O flavors.  I also include miniature marshmallows in mine.  Just about every time I attend a function and bring this, it is usually the first thing GONE!

The recipe submitter said we could use any flavor gelatin we prefer, so I used strawberry. I really prefer this with the addition of drained, crushed pineapple and 1/2 the gelatin. I also just dump the ingredients together, not using a blender at all.

I used low fat cottage cheese, strawberry sugar free jello, sugar free chocolate chips and sugar free whip cream and chopped strawberries.  The flavor was great but alittle strong. next time I'll add half the jello.  As other said, I just added everything to a bowl and mixed.  You can also freeze in between gram crackers for a frozen desert.

This is wonderful! I have to use sugar free, low fat products and this taste so good, it satisfies my sweet tooth. Its been a lifesaver for me whenever I want something sweet and to be able to eat it without guilt. I don't put the cottage cheese in a food processor, I just dump it all together in a bowl and mix, its great!

This dessert was awesome !  It is a great sugar-free option for diabetic's or those who simply want to limit sugar in their diet but still enjoy a dessert.  I was glad to have a beast of a food processor.  I suggest really processing to get the cheese curds as smooth as possible.  I used sugar-free lemon jello and added a few blueberries and an ever so light drizzle of blueberry syrup (less than 1/4 teaspoon) over the top for presentation.  Served it in wine glasses.  It looked very pretty and tasted delicious.  Everyone loved it and did not believe me that it was a sugar-free dessert.

5.28.16   This past week I've been cleaning out the pantry, fridge, and freezer, and I had some cottage cheese and box of island pineapple jelll-o® nearing their “best by” dates.  I made half a recipe, and instead of using the food processor, I used my mini chopper that came with my immersion blender...it worked beautifully.  The cottage cheese texture was smooth and creamy, and the pineapple flavor was subtle.  At first bite, I thought a little about cheesecake.  At any rate, we liked it, and it came together quickly.  It was a good recipe  for a BBQ dinner dessert, nothing fancy.

The Cottage Cheese Fluff has as good flavor with sweets in it. Unfortunately, I cannot give you 5 stars for 2 reasons. First of all, the texture was not what I expected. Its very grainy and it made it seem unpleasant. Second of all, the tittle said "Cottage Cheese Fluff". The desert was not fluffy, but very creamy. I need to know how to get what it looks like on the picture or you're gonna need to change the title.
[If the only option is to not blend it in the food processor, I wouldn't go for this desert because I don't like biting in cubes when eating deserts.

I use regular everything, jello,whipped topping, cottage cheese, not the light or sugar free. My husband likes fruit cocktail, drained,a little coconut and chopped nuts, walnuts or pecans. Any time I take this to a dinner, everyone loves it. I also just dump it all together and stir. For the people that complain that it's gritty, let it's it over night.

I did not use jello, instead I used fresh thinly sliced strawberries to mix in and added the cool-whip. I found that the addition of cool-whip made it sweet enough and no additional sugar was needed. I also did not cream the cottage cheese as per some other reviews. I might use this as a topping on a bagel next time.

Im sorry but I would never make this recipe again. I followed directions and I used strawberry jello and 2 boxes is to sweet and the cottage cheese is not really compatible with jello and cool whip
