Excellent. A couple of minor flaws, however.  (Let's get that over with first, then let's talk about how good these are) First, the recipe calls for 4 egg yolks and 1 egg white. Since they're all beaten together it would make more sense to read, "1 egg and 3 egg yolks."  Second, unless, perhaps, you're using a mini muffin pan, there's no way these would be done in 15 minutes - 22-25 min. is more like it.  Check them at 20 min. if you must, but be aware that if you check them too soon you risk them falling, or caving in on you!  Now, for the good part.  There are just so many ways you can describe a cake and after awhile it all sounds the same.  Yes, these are MOIST.  Yes, they are pleasantly SWEET as well as LIGHT and FLUFFY, not heavy and dense as I saw them described, unless you didn't beat the batter properly or are comparing them to a cake mix. Interestingly, they taste kind of like a sugar cookie and they even have a crackly, somewhat crispy top like one too. The almond flavor is noticeable, but pleasantly so.   But how to distinguish these from a million other cupcakes described the same way?...  How 'bout this - I ate two of them hot, right out of the oven. Knowing they're not at their best that way, they have to be plenty darn good to eat a second one the same way! And tho' I vowed not to, I had a third right after I frosted them (with a vanilla buttercream - take your pick from any of the wonderful recipes on this site).  Now that's good.

This is one of those recipes that I never would have found had it not been for the review section on this website.  I saw Naples' review yesterday and decided I had to try these.  I usually just stick with a boxed cake mix after trying a few scratch cake recipes that just didn't turn out.  This one also calls for almond extract- my favorite flavor.  The dough reminds me of a wetter Spritz cookie batter.  And these are definitely light and almost sponge-like instead of dense.  I was able to get 24 mini and 9 larger cupcakes out of this recipe with a little left in the bowl for me to lick clean.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

The first day I made these they were great. As someone else stated, by the second day the tops had hardened like sugar cookies. Not the worst thing that could happen, they still tasted really good, I probably just wouldn't make these to bring anywhere. As for my family, they loved them. My mom ate them plain for 3 days, the rest I frosted with a strawberry cream cheese frosting, topped with fresh strawberries. Still really good, just not the best yellow cake.

I used 2 tsp. of vanilla instead of using almond extract.  I also used all room temperature ingredients.  The recipe was easy as cupcake recipes go, and these didnt taste bad.  The draw back is that the tops get hard and taste like sugar cookies and the center is chewy.  Again, they didnt taste bad at all, its just the hard exterior and chewy interior.  If you like that, then you will like this recipe.  For my purposes, I am still on the hunt for the best vanilla cupcake that is moist throughout, with great vanilla flavor.  This wasnt it.  If anyone has one, please share!

I made these cupcakes for my sons birthday and they are wonderful! I did find they are denser, more like pound cake, which my family really enjoys.  I made a cherry buttercream frosting and they were outstanding! I loved the slightly crunchy sugar tops!

This was wonderful.  Just what I have been looking for to try to replicate the ones my grandmother used to make. Gale, I would love it if you could point us in the right direction for a good vanilla boiled icing recipe with a clear procedure.  Thanks again!

These cupcakes were somewhat dry and lacked taste. Followed recipe exactly, only baked for 16 min. I don't think they were over done. The milky way frosting did help, don't think I will make them again. To many other cake recipes to try.

I am giving 4 stars because I didn't make cupcakes.  I used an 11x7 inch glass pan.  It came out ok, but a little dry.  With cupcakes you wouldn't have to cook as long.  I frosted with a broiled coconut frosting and that was delicious.  Good combo. This reminds me of a coffee cake.  I will try the cupcakes next time.  Sorry!!

Yes, heavier texture and sugary sweet -- these probably could last in a cookie jar a good long time. (Perhaps why it's persisted since the Twenties?). Timing for the cooking may be way off for the same reason. My husband cooked this for 30 minutes to be done as cupcakes -- It kinda crystalized the outer dome.

This was good but a little dry, maybe more milk would help (don't want to make it too heavy by adding more butter). I used 3 thawed egg yolks and one "fresh" egg. (Note:  frozen egg yolks are like jelly, they won't liquify any more, don't heat them!) The cake had a great flavor. I love almond extract so I may add more next time.

Yummy!  These have a heavier texture than cupcakes, but are so delicious.  I love the addition of almond extract, really adds a great flavour.  Thanks!

These turned out very pound-cake-y for us.  They were way too rich with strawberry buttercream frosting and lemon cream cheese frosting on top.  If I were to make them again, I guess I would try the boiled frosting that it recommends (I had the others leftover in my fridge and wanted to use them up).  I can see how the  recipe would be from 1923, it tastes like something my grandmother (who was born close to then) would have loved.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what you usually think of as a cupcake, if that makes sense.  Not at all light and fluffy, very dense and rich.

Very good recipe; I did not make any changes. I did bake the cupcakes for 22 minutes, which was about a minute too long. I will make these again though, so next time they will be better. Thanks!

Extraordinary! I didn't expect it to be this good! a tad too sweet but very nice texture. I had to increase the milk more than the recipe calls for.

I just tried this recipe today and it is a good recipe. I do not do many homemade cup cake recipes at all but I will try this one again. I took the suggestion of the first reviewer with the eggs and used one whole egg and three egg yolks. This cap crumbles it doesn't come straight out the muffin paper cups but it is still a good recipe and I will use it again.* Everyone lets keep in mind that the era of this recipe is from the 1923's it is not of today so things will not be what we taste today but this is still good I would say they ate very good cupcakes or cakes back then.*

I saw the photo for these a few days ago from mominml and I had to make them. These were incredibly dry! I followed the directions to a T with the exception of making them in a mini muffin pan, and decreasing the cooking time due to this. I did enjoy the almond flavor, but overall this cake was nothing to write home about.

Great Easy recipe! The tops were not that hard on mine and they were perfect in the center! I also so made them mini cupcakes and they still required 18 mins. baking time, which is not a big deal. I used only 1 tsp. of vanilla and the flavor was lovely. You could do 2 if you wanted. I did how ever add a splash more milk after mixing it all together, batter was a little thick, but still turned out great! You can make a cake or cupcakes or mini cupcakes. This will be my go to for yellow cake of any kind!

I added some fresh cherries that I had boiled out and added a bit of sugar to and WOW it became an amazing cherry cake!  I love the thick rich batters and this one was amazing, and since my son can't have much dairy I used an equivalent amount (1/2 cup) of the cherry juice instead of the milk.  Still came out quite amazing!

I had a bunch of egg yolks left over, so I made these Golden Cakes. I thought they tasted pretty good--they are really rich. I added some cinnamon, about 1 t. However, I'm not sure they are worth all the calories.
