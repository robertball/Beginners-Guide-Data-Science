I had all of these ingredients on hand and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Next time I may add some hot sauce to the butter.

I did this exactly as the recipe was written. It was super easy I already had everything to make it and my boyfriend loved it. I served the scampi over whole wheat linguine.
