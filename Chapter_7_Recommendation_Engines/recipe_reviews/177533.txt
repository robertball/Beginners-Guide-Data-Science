I love Texas Toast and happened to have a package in the freezer.  This was a good way to use it up!  I didn't bother with the extra step of coating and frying the bread. (didn't have time)  I simply baked it according to the directions and sandwiched some fresh mozzarella, tomato slices and fresh basil in between.  The marinara on the side was a nice touch!

I liked this recipe because it wasn't too complicated but it looked fancy, and my guests liked it. Best of all it used some ingredients I had on hand.  I made small sandwiches that I did cut in half and I used as an appetizer, so mine were bite size.  (I had some fresh mozzarella I had to use up and some bread that I bought for something else that I also wanted to use up.) But I would like to try it with the Pepperidge Farm bread which I am sure would give it great flavor. Anyway, I was very happy with the result.

We liked this okay. We all thought it would have been better made without the coating. Next time, I will try it without. Instead of serving it with dipping sauce, I made homemade tomato soup to go with.
