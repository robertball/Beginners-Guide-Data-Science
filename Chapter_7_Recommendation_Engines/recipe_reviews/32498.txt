very refreshing! the honey is a great touch. i changed the recipe a little though... to avoid the sugar grittyness i made a simple syrup with sugar and water, added the honey to that, and steeped in some mint leaves. the result was smooth, fresh, and delicious... yum!!!

I liked this drink. I think next time I will make it without the honey flavor.  It's good, but different. The sugar sweetens the drink enough. 10 medium limes equaled about a cup of lime juice for me. 

P.S.- To anyone who thinks they are making this drink more "healthy" by using artificial sweeteners instead of sugar, artificial sweeteners are anything BUT healthy. Add the sugar and bask in your vitamin C allotment.

I made this exactly as written and found the amounts of lime juice and water to be perfect.  However, I really didn't notice the honey at all and, given the title, "HONEY Limeade," I found that disappointing. Next time I'll add more honey and reduce the amount of sugar. I want to taste that honey in there! As written, this is a good, but average, limeade recipe.

Just the right amount of tartness in this recipe! YUM! We used a garlic press to juice the key limes, which made it much easier and faster to get 1 cup of juice.

Very good. The proportions were perfect for our tastes. It took six medium limes to make a cup of juice. I did make a simple syrup with one cup of the water, then added that. I was worried about grittiness of the sugar. This one's a keeper.

Oh my goodness! 1 c. lime juice, 4 c. water, 1/3 c. white sugar, 2 Tbs. honey = perfect for those of us who like it TART! I also heated 1 c. of the water in the microwave to help the sugars dissolve better.

This was good but had to double the water the original recipe is way too tart and sweet. Would use less sugar if I it make again.

This is a wonderful, refreshing drink. Okay, so it's only around 60 degrees out right now, but come summer, I'll be whipping this up to sip by the pool. I had a bag of limes that needed using as they were starting to turn. I wanted a quick, simple drink recipe and found this. I'm so glad I did! Thanks for a winner!

Great recipe! It had the perfect sweetness and sourness that I thought it should have. This was my first time making limeade, and my family and I loved it. It tasted just as good as I thought it should. You can't really taste the honey, but that's fine with me! Five stars for this!

So Refreshing.  Did the simple syrup as others suggested.  Replaced the honey with maple syrup and added a few sprigs of fresh mint.

Really delicious.  Husband thought it was too sweet, but I think it is just right.  I really enjoy the honey flavor in there.  I thought that perhaps, the recipe didn't call for enough honey, but that too, in my opinion, is just right.  Husband likes it with a little fresh rosemary in his drink, he thinks it balances out the flavor.  Will definitely make this on a regular basis, regardless of the season!  Even in cold and dreary PNW rainy storms.

I made this exactly according to the recipe except I didn't have honey, but kept all the other measurements the same and it was perfect for my taste!  I like the little extra tartness of lime over lemon.

Florida has been having above average temperatures in the 80's, I found beautiful limes on sale, so that was the inspiration for making limeade in January.  I've made this twice, the first time exactly as written, and for our taste, it was too sweet.  This time I used 1/2 cup Splenda Granulated (to cut calories) in place of the sugar, 1 Tbsp honey, and it had the perfect amount of sweet-tart for us.  I'll be making this one all year (not just summer), delicious!!

Very refreshing.  I like mine a little sweeter than most probably, so I added an extra 1/4 of sugar.  Thanks for sharing.

You can have this anytime of the day to refresh yourself. At times when you are tired and feeling the heat add a pinch of salt insted of honey. Just Lime+sugar+salt and its more than enough.

Very delicious- but not quite limey enough for me.  I, too, made a simple syrup and added the honey into that.  This is delicious and so fresh!  For me next time, I'll make it a little more tart.

I thought this was wondefully refreshing on these unseasonably hot days we are having here in FL.  This was especially good when you pick the limes right off the tree.  I also used honey from one of the local orchards that has a citrus essence.  Thanks so much for a great hot weather drink.

This was a little sweeter than I like so next time I will use less sugar.  Also, I juied the limes myself and have to say the fresh lime juice was great!  I will need to get a juicer though, it really was more work than I bargained for.

Good recipe! Made three times. Once according to directions. Once with 1 tbsp grenadine extra. Once with 1 of the tbsp of lime juice substituted with Rose's sweetened lime juice and 1 tbsp grenadine. The middle recipe--per directions w/ added grenadine--was by far the best. Was worried about the honey but it came out great. Thanks!

Made this with the exact ingredients listed, although I, like others, made a syrup with the sugar and some of the water (1 C.) first in a pan on the stove, then I put the lime juice in a pitcher and poured the warm sugar syrup in there with the other four cups of cold water.  I would recommend pouring it over ice, not only to chill, but maybe to dilute a bit.  I tried some with some grenadine, and it was yummy, too.  We still have some in the fridge, and I'm thinking of trying some with vodka...oh, the possibilities! :)

Exactly what I was looking for. Maybe too sweet for some, but just right for me. I made it as written once, and once with a few dashes of grenadine. It comes out pink and cute that way. (I used less sugar the second time, since the grenadine is super sweet, even for me)

WOW!!!!!  This was great!  I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and use double the honey, because I was in a honey flavored mood today.  Next time I'll try it as written.  Really wishing I had some fresh raspberries as a garnish!

I made it exactly as written, since I had some lime juice I needed to use up. I just didn't find this drink very exciting - I guess I like lemonade a lot better.

Since I love limeade, I tried this out, and it is exellent exept for the fact that if you put to much honey, the dish can really go wild with sweetness. I love sour things, so this was not to my TOTAL liking. overall, i reccomend this it is really good.

This was so easy to make and so delicious. I doubled the recipe and it turned out beautifully. We used to get limeade when eating out in Mexico all the time, and this is the closest to that I've ever had.

I made it boozy by turning it into margaritas. I added 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, triple sec & tequila. I did heat up a cup of hot water and dissolved the sugar & honey in that first. It was definitely yummy.

I combined 1C hot water, sugar, and honey to dissolve, then added the limejuice. I then filled my 2C measure cup with ice and water, added remaining water and it was ready instantly!

This is really good. It was really easy to make. It has a good lime flavor and the honey is detectable (my kids immediately noted the honey flavor). I personally would have added a bit more lime because I like a little more tartness, but that's just personal preference. This is a good, all-around recipe and should be easy to tweak (i.e. add cherries, berries, more lime, etc). Thanks!

I thought this was really good. What I did was put one cup of water, the sugar and the honey into a sauce pan and let it warm on medium high until it was a mixture and then added it to the other four cups of water. I also blended up a cup of frozen strawberries and a cup of water until smooth and added it to the beverage. I think that really improved it.

We really loved this.  I did heat the sugar and honey in a little water to dissolve it first.

Delicious! I had no problem with the sugar dissolving in cool water and didn't think it was too sweet or tart. I thought the recipe was perfect as is.

This is a perfect balance.  Next time I'm going a little heavier on the honey, mostly because we like the taste; a little lighter on the sugar; maybe add some lime zest, but keep the ratio.  The recipe is perfect as it sets.  Thank you!

My family loved this! Followed the recipe exactly and took another reviewers advice and heated one cup of the water to dissolve the sugar and then added the lime juice and the rest of the water. Perfect and delicious!

As written, I found this recipe to be too sweet. I reduce the sugar by half or more in each batch (depending on my mood). The proportions of water:juice:honey are just right.

A very nice refreshing drink for the summer or the winter if you want to pretend youre somewhere warm.  A perfect balance of sweetness and tartness.  My kids love it and its better for them then the juice drinks.

I really liked this recipe. Yes, it is tart, but so refreshing. I used key limes and took the advice of another reviewer and used my garlic press to juice the limes. I also strained the juice through my garlic press to be sure of no large seeds. yum!! Thanks for sharing this!

Very nice, I added some mint for a bit of extra kick! I only had raw sugar though and it made it a slightly disturbing color though still tasty.

My husband loves limeade more than lemondade.  This was a huge hit with him.  We love the fact that it calls for honey instead of so much sugar.  We are trying to cut out some sugar.  Thanks!

Pretty good balance between sweet and tart, but too strong for us--I added more water.  I also used half brown sugar (the mexican kind that's natural and comes as a cake to be scraped off) because it has a refreshing taste all its own that I thought would complement the limes well.  It did!

I make this recipe all the time!  It is perfect for my likings.  It is a little on the tart side, but that is just how I like it!  I usually double the recipe and make a gallon and it works out fine.  Sometimes I put half lime juice and half lemon when I double.  Both are wonderful!

I'm not a big fan of the honey flavor, so I just follow the recipe as it is and add some extra sugar.  I've tried it with sugar substitutes, too, and it still tastes fantastic, for anybody else out there who's a health freak like I am.

Very good, Made recipe as written.  Great strong limeade, which is what we prefer.  The first recipe I tried was too weak for us. Next time though I will try substituting honey for half the sugar because I didn't think the honey flavor was strong enough in the original recipe.

Delicious! I made it just as written and it was perfect - not too tart nor too sweet.  I used regular limes (not key limes) and used about 6 1/2 to obtain one cup juice.

This is delicious and easy. I didn't need to make any adjustments to the recipe--it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I used key limes, and they were so good!
