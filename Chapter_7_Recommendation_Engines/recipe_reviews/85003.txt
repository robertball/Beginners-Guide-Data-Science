This one absolutely ROCKS, I take it everywhere, have passed the recipe out at least 5 times by request.  It's also great if you have a vegetarian living with you...make one batch of this and it's lunch for a week.  My mom commented that it's just like one of the salads sold at Whole Foods, only this doesn't cost $8/lb.

I use Roma tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes because they maintain their shape a bit better...and a word on couscous...make sure you check the outside of the box about how much one box makes.  If you use Far East brand, you have to use 2 boxes instead of one.  

Two chopped red bell peppers seem to go over better than mixed ones.  I also put in a larger container of feta.

If your grocery store doesn't have greek salad dressing in a bottle, mix together 1/3c each of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and that works, too.

When not making this for a party, I serve this as the side dish sometimes with "Cousin Cosmo's Greek Chicken," also on this site.  We call it Greek Night, and my 3 kids LOVE Greek Night!

I scaled this down to 7 servings (of which 2 people ate nearly all!). *blush*  I didn't have any boxed couscous mixes on hand, but did have plain whole wheat couscous; so I sauteed it in butter, then simmered it in chicken broth, a splash of chardonnay, along with Italian seasoning, garlic & onion powders & some salt. Used grape tomatoes & Girard's Greek Feta Vinaigrette (yum!) and this was a hit! DH asked me to make it again.  Thanks, Gourmet631!

Very good salad with beautiful visual presentation. I also used Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing as others recommended with very good results. I used garlic-herb feta and tossed in extra veggies. The great thing about this recipe is it can be customized so easily. Add left over chicken and you have a meal. Thanks Gourmet631.

I cut this back using ONE box of couscous mix. Because I could not find garlic and herb couscous mix, I added in some homemade greek seasoning and fresh minced garlic. I cut everything else back except the cucumbers and tomatoes. This is divine! I can't stop eating it. This is one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. This recipe's a keeper.

I made this receipe with whole wheat couscous--Trader Joe's--and it was wonderful!! Healthy, more fiber than a pasta salad or even a rice salad.  Great with the feta. Have made this with my own and with Paul Newman's Greek Dressing--both work well.

Great for picnics or large gatherings. Made (for 50) the night before, left in fridge overnight and added salad dressing before serving. Brought this to my boyfriend's church picnic and two ppl asked for the recipe. :)
Only changes would be to use English cukes (no seeds) and add more cherry tomatoes. I thought the feta was a little low but the bf loved the balance of grain, veggie and cheese. Will certainly make again. Enjoy!

I tried this out before making for our upcoming block party.  I thought it was good, but nobody in my family cared for it - and most of them love couscous!  Maybe it was the flavoring in the couscous...

This is FANTASTIC! I was picturing a much bigger mound of food, so I'm a little relieved - perfect amount for sharing at a picnic or potluck! I used a roasted garlic couscous, quartered my grape tomatoes, scooped my cucumber seeds out, and forgot the bell pepper so I just omitted it (next time, when I DO get one, it'll be an orange or yellow one - those colors would be a great addition). I was debating tomato basil feta but in the end decided that between the couscous, olives AND dressing, there were enough bold flavors already. And yes, definitely used Absolutely Fabulous House Dressing... it's my favorite anyway, so why not! :)  This was delicious exactly as written, but my little girls & I made the executive decision to increase the veggies, parsley & cheese by half again, and I'm SO glad we did!! Taking to a party this afternoon, IF we can stop sampling it. We've been scooping out the dry pre-dressing mixture then adding just a little drizzle to the bowl, which is how I think we'll do it every time we make this for just us at home. Thanks so much for the recipe! **ETA: we made again, and using just two boxes of couscous but the written veggies/parsley/feta amounts is the PERFECT ratio. Left out the bell pepper again; I think it's even better that way!

Very good, several people wanted the recipe! I used the  Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing on this website and it was excellent too. If you scale the dressing recipe down to 5 servings, it makes exactly a half cup which was perfect for this recipe. It took me less than 5 minutes to make the dressing and the salad was quick too.

Great salad! I used a big English cucumber - removed seeds, fresh water packed feta and big fresh kalamatas. If you live in MI or Chicago, Leo's Greek Dressing rocks this (buy at restaurant or grocery store), but I'm partial. :) I like lots of goodies, so I only used 2 boxes of couscous. Will try whole wheat couscous next time!! Thanks Saveur, will make this many times this summer!

I loved this and already made it twice in one week.  I took it to a potluck and it was gone FAST!!  I did add some chopped green onions and also some red onions in the salad.   You cannot go wrong with this.  It is so quick and easy and look very gourmet.

Every time I take this to a cookout, people ask for the recipe. I love this easy and tasty recipe. I use the larger couscous (found in Whole Foods bulk section) and use Panera Bread's Greek Dressing. It is delicious! The kalamata olives and feta really enhance the flavor.

If you are like me and don't LIKE couscous that much, but eat it just because you know it is good for you, do this: go crazy on the greek ingredients.  I added tons of fresh tomatoes, kalamata olives, green onions, cucumbers and a bit more dressing than the recipe called for.  For me, the balance of couscous to other ingredients was perfect. Enjoy!

This couscous recipe is the BOMB!  I scaled it down to 13 servings since it only required that I use 2 boxes of couscous.  I left out the cherry tomatoes since we are not big fans of them...it was delicious!!  I will definitely make again and highly recommend using the "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" recipe found on this website.

This made a nice change from pasta salad. I used two packets of vegetable and herb couscous and used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek House dressing from this site. My daughter was hoping for leftovers today but there weren't any. Many Thanks.

I was very surprised that everyone really loved this recipe, since I dont make couscous very often, but it was so easy to make and had a great flavor, I used Ken's steak house brand greek salad dressing and it tasted great. I did wait until the last minute to add the feta since it does tend to get soggy if marinated too long. But otherwise a new favorite :)

I used quinoa instead of couscous (a similar, yet more healthful substitution).  The recipe seems to be lacking something in terms of seasoning.  I added salt, pepper and Greek seasoning, but it still didn't have the Greek flavor I was hoping for.  Maybe I'll try again with a different brand of Greek dressing and more calamata olives.

This is soooo good! I use whole wheat, unflavoured couscous and cook it with vegetable or chicken broth. I also add in orange pepper, a teaspoon of garlic powder, a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and one or two diced garlic cloves (I love garlic :). I omit the tomatoes sometimes, and olives and it still tastes great. I also sometimes use Zesty Italian salad dressing if I don't have Greek on hand, and again, it is amazing. I have made it many times for many occasions and everyone loves it! :)

This was a GREAT couscous recipe. I didn't have olives, so those were sadly omitted, but I didn't miss them at all. Also used a Champagne vinaigrette instead of the Greek, and scaled the recipe down to just 1 box of couscous since I was only cooking for 2. As the recipe owner suggests, this is easily adaptable. Overall, a fantastic recipe that I will be holding onto! Thank you!

I made this to take to a friend's birthday celebration and it was a huge hit! I used 2 8 oz packages of couscous and it made more than enough. I think I may add more feta next time. And I took everyone's advise and used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek Dressing recipe from this site - I used a full cup of dressing and it was incredible. I think the couscous may have been a bit dry with if I'd only used the half cup that this called for. This one's a definitely a keeper!

This recipe was really good and super simple! I did add some chopped red onion, but did not make any other changes. All five of my children loved it and so did my husband. Great side salad, that is quick, easy and semi healthy!

This was gobbled up at my work potluck. I used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing from this site and two boxes of Far East couscous. I've made variations of this recipe with different vegetables and just eyeing amounts. You can't really go wrong.

Great idea!  I made this with Tabouleh instead of Couscous (more substantial and healthier).  Scaled down to 7 servings (one package of Tabouleh).  The mix already had lots of spices, so I omitted the parsley.  Also left out peppers and tomatoes since hubby doesn't like them.  Made the night before and put in fridge for hubby to eat for his lunch the next day.  He ate it with some gyro meat and some homemade hummus and veggie chips.  He said it was Awesome :)

Brought this to work and ended up handing out the recipe on the bulletin board. It tastes very light and rich with flavors but is extremely healthy. You can never go bad with veggies and soft textures because the combo triggers your taste and feel senses. Amazing!

This recipe was excellent! It was very easy to tweak and make my own. I used chicken stock, a little garlic powder and granulated chicken bouillon in sun dried tomato and spinach couscous. I also used a Ken's Steak House Greek vinaigrette to dress it. This was a very unique tasting dish with a nice Greek flair.

When they say "Party-size" they are not joking..  I made this and took to the lake for Memorial Day.  We had 17 people and I still had left overs to take to work on Tues.  I did add many more Tomatoes, feta cheese and 1 bottle of salad dressing.  This is a very nice cool summer salad.  I believe next time I'll only use 1 box of Couscous!  By the time you add all the other ingredients it should feed plenty..  Very good.

I think that I would have liked this better had I made it with plain couscous. I made a small batch using just one box, and restaurant greek dressing from AR's site. The flavors were just a little strong and didn't mix right. I would definitely try again with plain couscous though. Thanks!

I made 7 servings of 1/3 of the original recipe. I used whole wheat couscous so I added a little Greek seasoning to make up for the flavour loss. I omitted the cherry tomatoes because my son doesn't eat them, added green onion, red & green peppers, cucumber and carrot diced finely. I served the olives and feta on the side because it was at a BBQ and not everyone likes them. Salad was well received and made lots. My children loved it and my son demanded I pack the leftovers for his lunch today! Great salad to make when you don't want to heat up your kitchen, I make the couscous in the microwave.

This is an easy and tasty salad that makes a large bowl.  It was so tasty that I didn't even need to use the Italian dressing - it was flavorful enough on its own!  It was a big hit, even with people who don't normally like couscous.

Great for SUMMER! I made this recipe with one 6 oz box of roasted garlic couscous, 1/2 of a large cucumber, kalamata olives, reduced-fat feta cheese, and 1/4 cup greek salad dressing. It has gotten better after being in the fridge and I keep adding more of all the ingredients besides the couscous whenever I eat a bowl. It's delicious and you can totally make it your own by adding or leaving out ingredients!

I made this a year ago for a baby shower and it was wonderful.  I think I added walnuts or maybe almonds.  Anyone out there ever do that?  Just trying to remember how I made it last year since it was so good then.  I have a bad habit of changing recipes and then forgetting how I did it.

What a hit! Next time I'd probably add a little more feta (I LOVE feta!) but it was a big hit at my grandma's 80th. Everybody loved it. The recipe is HUGE so I'll probably halve it next time if I'm making it for home. I can tell I'll make this again and again...would be great in lunch boxes.

This was beyond good. I added olive oil, minced garlic, vinegar and salt. Great for a bbq or party.

Love this. Don't put in olives, personal prefernce, but otherwise follow it exactly. I lossely follow the Absolutely Fabulouse Greek/House Dressing recipe from this site for the dressing.

This is delicious & a nice change from the usual pasta & potato salads.  The next time I make it, however, I will modify it because it's too salty.  I will definitely make my own oil & vinegar dressing & maybe even use less feta cheese & olives.

Brought this to a church picnic and kept getting asked where I got the recipe.  Most of my friends had never heard of couscous but after trying the salad wanted to know where they could buy some to make this recipe themselves!

YUM!  The first time I made it was for a pitch-in and everyone raved about it.  Of course, if there is an ingredient in this recipe that you don't care for, then don't add it.  Any combination of the ingredients would be terrific.  If you really like feta, then add more feta.  You really can't go wrong!  I think it is also fairly healthy.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I took it too a barbecue and didn't get any comments on it. I can only conclude they weren't couscous fans. However, I loved it and have eaten the leftovers for the past 3 days. Followed the recipes exactly

GREAT!  I scaled this recipe back as I only had 1 cup of couscous left...cooked in vegetable broth and then added all of the other ingredients - with the exception of the kalamata - sigh, which I didn't have!  Added Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing, excellent!

I've made this three times, and it has had rave reviews every time.  Just be sure to use Kalamata olives, I used regular canned sliced black olives and it was definitely not as good.

Huge hit at the 2 parties that I made it for. Very tasty. I sprinkled the Feta right before serving and used less olives since the Kalamata olives are stronger in taste.

It has a very strong flavor to it, so it only tastes good in SMALL portions. Personally, I thought it was alright, but none of the 30+ people we had over last weekend agreed. It sat there all night - lonely and full to the brim. Not a single person went back to it for seconds. Several of our guests were active duty soldiers, and according to them (including my husband) it is exactly the sort of food that the native Iraqis eat. It's a decent enough (and very unique) dish, but I won't be serving it again.

I've made this a few times now and always have rave reviews.  I've also made this same recipe using brown rice or lentils in place of the couscous and I've added quinoa (about 1/4 c in place of 1/2 of the couscous)  Always turns out great!

This is a really great side dish that is so easy to make! I have made it a few time already and my friends love it.  Since I couldn't get kalamata olives, I substituted black and green sliced olives and it worked great.

Easy recipe.  Great change from traditional salads.  I ended up doubling the feta, cucumber, olives, and peppers as there did not seem to be enough compared to the couscous.  I took it to work and it was a hit.

Great addition to the BBQ table.  I used all diff types of peppers, vidalia onion, carrot, fresh parsley and basil in addition to all the other ingredients listed.  This is a dish that you can throw anything in to your liking and it will come out delicious.  I used absolutely fabulous greek dressing from this site and it was wonderful.  I made the morning of my party and added the dressing when I served like suggested.  Thanks Gourmet for a fabulous side dish.

I pared down the recipe to 7 servings which brought it down to one box of couscous.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly.  My guests enjoyed it, but I did not.  I think it was the garlic flavored couscous that threw me off.  I probably would have preferred a couscous without flavoring.  I do not think I will make this again.

This is a great light salad.  Very tasty. I have made this twice so far, once with orzo and once with quinoa.  It was great both ways.  I will make again.

Very good. A hit at 2 family gatherings. Also used bowtie pasta instead of couscous and added pepperoni chunks for  a variation once. Everyone loved this also.

I was looking for something fairly simple to use up some couscous I had sitting around and this recipe did nicely. I made quite a few "amendments", mainly because I was making it for only myself and I also had spending limitations. I highly recommend this recipe - it tastes great - and it's not too often you get a good Greek meal.

Made it for thanksgiving side. Everyone loved it! Made the couscous in the rice cooker. Made the dressing at home with 1/3 balsamic vinegar and 2/3 olive oil, salt and pepper to taste. Will make again.

Made this for a dinner party for my mother’s birthday and everyone raved about it! Based on the reviews, I only used 2 packages of couscous which was plenty.

Followed recipe but added extra veggies  (and served the Feta Cheese on the side only because my husband is not a big fan).  This size tray took 5 boxes of Near East brand couscous.   Accompanied with Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House dressing.  We really enjoyed both!!!!   I would definitely make it again for a crowd.

This salad is wonderful, everyone I feed it to just loves it. However,  since it uses a bottled dressing please know that the dish is only going to be as good as the salad dressing you use so if you don't have the inclination to make your own (by far the tastiest option) then at least put in the extra couple of dollars to buy a quality vinaigrette. Also, this salad is MUCH better after having sat for a while (preferably overnight) because that gives the couscous and veggies time to soak up the dressing (you might have to add a little more dressing the next morning too). If you mix it and serve it right away it can be a tad bland.

Very good! I served it warm and it was still yummy.  I definitely would have doubled the cheese and increased the peppers and olives. My guests liked it a lot!

The next time I make this I will add more tomatoes, cucumber and peppers.  I only used 2 boxes of couscous and found the ratio of couscous to vegetables wasn't to my liking.  Next time I will use some other reviewers suggestions and add red onion or peperocini.

Awesome, easy to prepare and super healthy. I left out the feta cheese because I think it's VERY strong flavored and it was still delicious. My husband LOVED this! We will make it often, thank-you!

This is a great salad.  My husband is a huge fan.  I added artichoke hearts and hearts of palm because I had them on hand.  We are a great fan of the dressing Absolutely Fabulous Greek House dressing from this site as recommended from another reviewer.  Thanks.

Made this for the 4th and no even tried it. What a shame! My husband and I loved it! I used flat leaf parsley and it had somewhat of a strong flavor. Think I will cut down on that next time. A nice change from the pasta salad etc.
