Considering how easy this is, it's wonderful.  It's a little bland for me, but some black pepper (or white pepper) should fix that up.  I found canned peas to be a little too mushy, even when added at the last possible second, so I think we'll just have them on the side next time.  My only question is why this is called "One Dish Chicken Noodles" when the recipe calls for two large pans?  Oh well, it's still easy, fast and even nutritious if you choose the ingredients well.

This is good. I have a similar recipe that uses canned cream of chicken soup instead of the gravy...just add some water to get the consistency you like. I like to have corn on the side.

This recipe was great, I read several reviews and took some advice to complete my dish.  I started out by using 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, to saute 1 clove of fresh garlic and half of a medium onion.  I added my chicken was the garlic began to brown along with a little Seasonal Salt, sweet basil, and pepper.  From there I followed the directions to a "T", but once finished, I added a coating of Parmesan cheese.  This is a great dish and a do over in our household!

Awsome & simple.  I used Healthy Harvest egg noodles and didn't use any chicken as I dont really like meat that much, and used ALOT of can peas, it was sooooo yummy.

THIS WAS SO EASY AND SO GOOD. THE ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS USING CANNED PEAS INSTEAD OF FROZEN. THIS ONE IS A DEFINITE KEEPER.

The dish was a little bland, so I made sure to add enough pepper as well as sauteed some garlic with the chicken to add some flavor!  It tasted like a hearty chicken soup, without all the liquid.

Good.  Don't like peas, so I stir fried some broccoli.  I added a splash of soy sauce and a little ginger too.  Yum.

This dish proves you don't need a long list of ingredients and complicated steps to make a tasty dinner. Thank you for sending this in! My family, especially the teen in our house, loved this. The only addition I made was some pepper.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My husband, who is very picky, also ate it too days in a row. He hates leftovers!  I added a can of cream of chicken soup per other reviews and cracked black pepper and garlic powder.

Bland. It needs more spices. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic before I cooked it, and added some parmesan cheese to the mixture and it was still a little bland. Probably won't make this again.

Not bad for a quick meal.  Used homemade gravy rather than bought.  And used broccoli in place of peas.

My husband I both enjoyed this. We omitted the peas and added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the chicken as it was browning. This is a wonderful quick, weeknight recipe that you can prepare with items from your pantry. I will definitely add this to my go to list.

I'm always on the lookout for easy recipes with minimum cooking involved.  This was very easy and very good.  My husband and son liked it, and my son is actually going to cook it when he's on his own in a few weeks - now that's an easy recipe!  And the chicken, noodles and gravy make it a comfort food dinner.  Thanks, Susan.

This would a good start for a good recipe. The only thing I don't like is the taste of the chicken gravy. I did add the gravy but tweaked it by mixing 2 tablespoons of flour with a cup of milk to make more of a cream gravy. It totally changed the taste. I'm a country girl and there just isn't anything better than cream gravy .

I didn't make any changes except to add carrots as it was pictured.   I wish I had, this was bland and just tasted like the gravy from the jar. Terrible...

i made it according to the posted recipe.  It needed a little extra spice for my taste.  Added a little garlic.

Very easy and very tasty. I seasoned chicken with garlic, salt, pepper, and onion powder. I also used frozen peas and carrots just for a bit more variety.

This was so bland I could barely eat it.  This needs a lot more seasoning.  Maybe i will try to doctor up the leftovers since it made such a huge amount.
