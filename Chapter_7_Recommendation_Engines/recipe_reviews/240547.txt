I made it as written except I used brown sugar instead of agave. I used a Vitamix to blend it and a nut bag to strain it. Then I put half back in the blender with two cups of additional water and blended it again. I did the same with the second half. I got one half gallon out of this recipe. I felt it was more like the consistency of store-bought. I was unhappy about the additives in processed almond milk. I used the leftover nut meal in my morning cereal. I am very happy with the results of this recipe. Thanks!

Made for a second time using Vitamix so interval blending wasnt necessary.   Strained twice - second time folding cheesecloth 8x - Super smooth.  Used one date for slight sweetness instead of Agave. Dried pulp in oven 170degrees to avoid waste.  This is a keeper! Thanks.

I have made this several times. Once I had forgotten to soak the almonds overnight so I soaked them in very hot water for a few hours and it worked out very well. I have also added vanilla extract in the first step and let the almonds soak it up overnight, that also turned out very good.

Worked like a charm! I left mine unsweetened for personal preferences. I followed the recipe quantities for almonds and water exactly. Mine rendered approximately 700 ml or roughly 24 ounces. I don't know where the difference comes from. I even spilled about 2 Tbsp because I used an immersion blender and it got wild for a minute. Regardless, thank you Steph S. for the recipe. I won't buy store-bought ever again! It's too easy and better for both me and my wallet this way!

Soaked the almonds until they couldn't absorb anymore water, then let them soak for longer. Blended, strained, reblend, strained until the remains looked a bit tan. Got a little over half a gallon. I sweetened with honey. I has a slightly nuttier flavor than store bought that i like. I gave my one yr old a taste test and she ditched her cup of cow's milk for the almond. 5 stars

I omitted sweetener, added a splash of vanilla, and put the sea salt and vanilla in at the beginning so I didn't have to clean my blender twice.  This  homemade version is really yummy and has no chalky flavor (which I remember from tasting a manufacturer's sample at Costco).

Made this for the first time yesterday. Definitely going to make it again! Very easy and taste great. I did not add a sweetener but did add a pinch of salt and a half teaspoon of vanilla - oh so good!

This recipe works perfectly. Tastes great with or without sweetener. Don't expect this to taste like store-bought almond milk, this actually tastes like almonds! I used cheesecloth to strain it the first time but I found a muslin bag that works a lot better in straining the little bits out. All almond milks will separate in the fridge so just shake it up a bit before serving. Will be making this again and again.

Great recipe that is very simple and easy to make! I soaked the almonds for about a full day before blending. I didn't have a cheesecloth nor a nut bag, so I just strained the mixture through a very fine mesh strainer several times until no grittiness was left. I also left the milk unsweetened, but did add a tiny pinch of sea salt. Taste and texture turned out great!

Easy to do, and tastes great.  I'm a beekeeper, so I replaced the agave with our honey.

This was soooo good and super easy to make.  I skipped the agave nectar.  I didn't need to add any sweetener it was perfect without.  I will be making this on a regular basis.

Made as written, and it is delicious! I will say this, I would have given 5 stars, but the almond flavor is more present here than in the store bought versions. This is not a bad thing, but I think that could be due to not using blanched almonds...so next time I will try blanching the almonds and update this review with my results. Also, I will probably cut the agave nectar in half.

Wonderful recipe, I love that it is sweetened with agave and not sugar like the store bought brands. I love sweetened almond milk better than regular milk, but I don't like the sugar so when I don't have time to make it I buy the unsweetened almond milk at the store, then when I first open it I take a half cup out, heat it up (on the stove until just very warm or in the microwave for 20 seconds) mix in a teaspoon of honey for each serving in the container (I like raw, unfiltered honey from Trader Joe's or Safeway/Vons) and then pour it back in the container and give it a good shake. It comes out as sweet or sweeter than the "Original" Almond milk from most store-bought brands (depending on which honey you use) with no refined sugar and all the benefits of nature's best sweetener.

I love this recipe, it is very easy and the milk is perfect. I didn't put any sweetener as it has a natural sweet taste to me. Thank you for this recipe.

This was real easy to make. I followed some of the other suggestions as well. I wanted unsweetened almond milk so I just added vanilla. It came out really good and tasty and I used in my protein shake this morning. I also added back some of the nuts into my shake.  Yummy!!!
