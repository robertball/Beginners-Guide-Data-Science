Tangy and delicious! Let me start with the crust which is sent from the bakery Gods to give us an idea of what heaven is like. This crust is crazy easy to make and tastes just like a shortbread cookie. It puffs up a bit when it cooks, but shrinks back down as it cools. It was hard not to eat it alone! The filling is a nice balance to the crust. It is very tart (much more so than a lemon meringue....think lemon bar from the bakery), which I love. I will make this again but I would blend the sugar up in a processor first to make it a finer grain and help it dissolve better. It was pretty grainy, so I found I had to whisk the filling for quite a while to get most of the sugar blended in. Also, FYI the pie did not set in the oven! The recipe says to cook it until set, so I had it in for almost 35 minutes. But it actually did not set until it cooled. When it does, its a very pretty presentation (see photo). I sprinkled with confectioners sugar and topped with homemade whipped cream and homemade raspberry sorbet. Perfect after an Italian meal. Thanks so much ChefChristi!

Great recipe, loved by all who have eaten the 20 or so that I've made.

I use 2/3 of the crust recipe to even out the pie dough in the pie pan. I use the side of my fingers to nudge the material into place to get even thickness where the sides meet the bottom.

113 grams (1/2 cup) butter - instead of 3/4 in the recipe
67 grams (1/3 cup) granulated sugar
129 grams flour (this is 2/3 of 1 3/4 cups)
Healthy pinch of salt
1/2 - 1 tsp vanilla

Shave chilled butter with a cheese grater into sugar. Mix with pastry blender, add vanilla and salt, then flour. Use the pastry blender. Press into the pie pan with your hands to feel a uniform thickness, only 2/3 up the side of the pan otherwise the shortbread will break up.

I chill the crust for at least 45 minutes. Heat the oven to 350 and bake the crust for 15-18 minutes on the lower rack. Let the crust chill before baking with the filling in it. No modifications to filling, except more lemon zest to kick it up a notch. 

Bake 30 minutes.

Cool overnight. Get ready to be loved.

Lovely, beautiful, yummy, delicious were among the few comments I received when I brought this lemon tart to morning tea at Uni this morning. Everyone raved about it and I had 2 request for the recipe and of course I told them I got it from here. Love the mix of tangy, sweet and crunch and yes I agree with AZ93, the crust itself, on its own, is yummy :D. I also love the fact that the filling doesn't have cream in it for personal reasons but, if you do prefer it to be creamy, you can always add a dollop of whipped cream on top of it. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks, ChefChristi1221 :)

Very good and super easy. I made it exactly as per the recipe except my tart pan is 11 inches. It worked out great, crust was nice and thick and the filling set fine in the oven for me in 20 minutes.

Absolutely perfect combination of sweet and sour!  Love how lemony this is, I'll try this next with a brown sugar meringue, but the dusting of icing sugar was great too.  The only thing I did was to reduce cooking time on the tart crust, and increase cooking time on the filled tart.  I've made this 3 times now and the filling didn't set any of the times without adding about 10 mins.  The tart crust got just a tad overdone this way, so I'd reduce the baking time slightly when baking the shell.

I only used the recipe for the filling and found that it was not that tart and tangy. Was rather sweet for my taste. Also, it did not come out all that yellow and lemon tart looking at all! Try another recipe if you can...

Modified the recipe a bit to make personal tarts in a cupcake pan.

If you decide to make smaller tarts, you either need to double the crust recipe or halve the filling recipe. The current recipe makes enough for about 12 tart shells and has enough filling for 24.

Almost a perfect recipe though. Garnish with mint leaves and a raspberry for that extra wow factor.

This recipe saved our evening.  We were stuck in a snow storm and I had all of the ingredients save for the lemon.  I had bottles of lime juice and lemon extract.  I made according to the recipe substituting all of the lemon items with 1/8 cup lime juice and 1/8 cup lemon extract and 1/4 cup water.  I had to cook it about 10 additional minutes to make it set, but it was delicious!!!  Thanks for saving our evening!!!

This recipe was PERFECT! I made exactly how much the recipe yeilded and it was gone in a night. It was a great balance of tangy and sweet, my mom couldn't get enough and even asked for the recipe! The crust was soft and delicious. I'm definitely going to make this recipe again.

I tried this recipe and let me tell you it was to die for. The crust was so soft and I even made shortbread cookies with it. The filling was so lemony and sour and I love that I do recommend trying this because once you try it, it will become your top lemon tart recipe! I'm telling you!

Great recipe and easy to make. I will definitely do it again. My guests loved it. I changed the amount of lemon juice and replaced half of it with grated whole frozen organic lemon. This makes the taste just a bit more intense, I presume. Thanks for hint that the filling can set after taking the tart out of the oven and for the remark that it tastes even better the second day! It worked out just fine!

Unequivocal RAVES!!~  I use store-bought shells so I can make these quite frequently.  My elderly friend, who was hopelessly addicted to ice cream now prefers THE BEST LEMON TART EVER.

I was really looking forward to making this, I prepared the crust, put it in the fridge for 30 minutes, and half way through baking the crust melted!! I used room temp. butter. Very disappointed.

I was really excited to try this recipe given the great reviews. I baked the crust in a pie mould for 30mins before it turned golden brown. The crust puffed up quite a bit causing it to loose its shape...when I took it out to rest I patted down the crust to resume a tart-like shape. The crust tastes wonderful on its own and smells great baking! I substituted .5 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar for the 1.5 cups sugar filling. The brown sugar caused the filling to turn a darker brown color. I had to bake for 35mins before the tart in its entirety set. To finish, I dusted with powdered sugar when cooled. All-in-all tasty recipe. I gave this 3 stars because of the chaos from the rising of the shell...might benefit from adding a weight while baking.

The tart was very tart. It was eatable with tea. The next day it tasted much better, not so tart. The crust was nice and crisp. I made it as written except I used 12' tart pan and it was perfect.

Amazingly simple and a show stopper every time.  Tartness balanced with buttery density of crust. With a tart pan holds its shape so nicely it looks like a bakery shop tart!  Take it to your in-laws and smile at the compliments.

This is an excellent lemon tart plus being very easy to make.  I was asked to bring a dessert for an Easter dinner. Everyone really liked the tart which I served with fresh raspberries and whipped cream.  I used a 10" tart pan and followed the suggestion of another reviewer to blend the sugar for the filling.  It took 30 minutes for my tart filling to set.

absolutely killer.  I added 1/2 cup of lemon juice and substituted brown sugar for the white -- fantastic carmel-lemon flavor.

I made this recipe for my husband on his birthday. He loved it and I think it is any easy recipe to follow. I loved the shortbread cookie crust and the lemon filling is very delicious. You can't go wrong with this wonderful recipe...

Pastry was delicious, however i found the filling far too sweet. If I made it again I would almost halve the amount of sugar in the filling, but in all honesty i probably wont make this again.

This was so much more delicious than I thought it would be! It was simple to make, but I didn’t bake the crust golden in the first bake, but let it brown up in the last bake. When it was cool, I covered it in lemon curd, sugared up some of the remaining peels, whipped up a super light buttercream, piped some florets along the edge, and sprinkled the candies peelings over some of them. A huge hit! One I will repeat often!

Delicious! Buttery crust, and tart lemon flavor. Followed the recipe as written. Made twice. Had to add baking time with my oven, in order for the tart to set. Baked for 30-40 minutes. It was a hit each time! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

I liked it and I do think I might make it again.  The only thing I changed was I added almond extract to the crust in place of vanilla because I ran out of vanilla.   I actually liked the flavor the almond extract gave the crust so I think I will do the same next time.    I think the sweet and lemon flavor was balanced.   It wasn’t super tart but I am ok with that.    It took 30 minutes to set up but that could’ve  just been oven variants.

Amazing result, especially when compared other more complicated  methods! I was sceptical at first because this recipe has way more sugar compared with other lemon tart recipes and I've been using more elaborate methods previously but this turned out beautifully! I just added more salt to the crust because I like them savory

It looks amazing. I did cut back on the sugar and added more lemon zest and a bit more lemon juice, because I like it more tart. I also used a pre-made dough. Pâte Sablée. Left it in the fridge for about 30 min then baked it for about 10 min. Poured filling in and continued baking for about 30 min. It set perfectly.

the recipe is great but the filling turns out a bit thicker than i would like. So i’d recomend to use a bit less flour or more lemon juice. Depending on how sour you want it to be

Tasted fantastic, but I would recommend cutting the amount of crust  you make a bit as it was a pretty thick crust for a 9 inch tart. I also had to add around 10 minutes to the bake time for the filling to set.

Loved this recipe. The shortbread is easy to make and the fact you don't have to rest the dough and roll it out is a real time-saver. The crust bakes up beautifully and the filling is rich and easy to make. I did protect the edges on the second baking and they stayed a nice golden color. Everybody, especially my husband, loved this recipe.

The crust recipe is good. The curd comes outbound how it looks like in the picture with the small bubbles. Inside of that though is very liquid. The top layer is soggy and more curd like but the inside is almost complete liquid. I recommend using a recipe where the curd is boiled first then cooled and where a picture of the inside of the tart is shown

Tasted surprisingly good for such a simple recipe. I used a store bought pie crust mix so I just had to make the filling. It was very tart and lemony.  Tasted great with a little cool whip on top.

This is an excellent recipe - the tartness of the lemon filling is balanced by the smooth sweetness of the shortbread crust.  I agree with other reviewers that this probably belongs in a larger tart pan - I used an 8" springform pan, and the crust ended up a bit too thick even with getting it up the sides enough to contain the filling.  However, if you don't have a tart pan, I will tell you that the springform pan (I would use my 10" next time) is just great - I had no problems with sticking (even without treating the pan in any way) and it held its shape nicely when I removed it from the pan and plated it.

One suggestion, since the timing of this is in question.  I researched how to tell if the lemon filling is done, and the test I found that seemed to work for me is the touch test - lightly touch the middle of the tart, if the filling springs back, it's done.

Incidentally, as another reviewer noted, it does become sweeter the second day, so if you don't want super tartness, make it a day in advance and refrigerate overnight.

This recipe turned out good. It was a lot sweeter than I expected and that's saying a lot considering I have a sugar addiction and love sweets. I didn't sprinkle powdered sugar since it's already sweet enough. I think this would be good with some plain vanilla ice cream to balance out the tartness with some creaminess. Next time I will bake the crust for 15 min instead of 20 min and the filling for 25 min so it sets well and the crust doesn't burn and stick to the pan like it did this time around. Next time, when preparing the crust to bake, I need to first push the crust all the way up on the sides, then the bottom so the filling doesn't cover the whole top like it did this time around.

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST LEMON DESSERT RECIPE YOU WILL EVER OWN!!  I'VE MADE THE RECIPE COUNTLESS TIMES AND IT ALWAYS TURNS OUT FABULOUS.  IT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RICHNESS WITH THE SHORT BREAD CRUST YET THE FILLING IS LIGHT AND LUSCIOUS TASTING.  FOR A SPECIAL TREAT SERVE IT WITH RASPBERRY COULIS AND A SPOONFUL OF WHIP CREAM ON THE SIDE.  DIVINE

Excellent tart. Delicious crust that is buttery-sweet and balances well with the tart filling. I do think the recipe quantities match better with an11" tart pan - crust was very thick and tart required 10 more min bake time than called for - tasted GREAT tho. Don't omit the zest!!

It's a decent lemon tart recipe. You definitely need to refrigerate it longer than 30 minutes... The lemon zest comes on very strong, so I removed it and added it as a garnish on top. I also added more flour to the lemon paste and baked the entire thing for 15 minutes. It sets really nicely, tastes tart, and looks pretty too. Try it!

I've made this twice.  The first time it was fabulous!  The crust was lovely and the filling was sweet, lemony, and a good texture.  Tonight I made it again and  it boiled over and a was a horrible mess.  I'm trying to remember what I did differently...

I put the filling in small tart shells and cooked it all together like the recipe said and after 10 minutes the filling was dense and hard. It wasn't good at all. Maybe if the recipe had said to chill in the fridge it could have been better

Delicious! As another review mentioned, if you are making it in smaller sizes, you will either need to up the amount of crust or decrease the amount of filling. I made 33 mini-tarts and had enough filling left over for two 4-inch tarts. Those 4-inch tarts were superb! Will definitely be making this again in a full size version.

I will definitely make this again! My 11 yo son took 1 bite and said,"mom! Make lots of these." The only thing I did differently  was that I added a very thin apricot glaze when it was cooled. I just didn't like the "dull, frothy" finish that it had out of the oven. Maybe I over whipped the filling? But rave reviews all around :) THANKS FOR THIS EASY, DELICIOUS RECIPE!

I reduced sugar in the filling from 1 1/2 cups to 1 cup. My wife, a native of Eastern Europe, grew up during the Soviet Era when sugar was very expensive. Therefore, she prefers desserts only mildly sweet. By reducing the sugar by 1/2 cup, the tart turned out perfect for us!

The buttery shortbread crust isn't only a supporting actor in this performance, but should receive co-star status with the filling.

My wife told me that I'll definitely be making this one again.

This is i thiught the best Lemon Tart ever!!! Until i did some changes with the crust and now i can say this IS the best tart ever!
Less Sugar by half on everything that includes the lemon filling then crush pecans into crust dough add a few tsp of brown sugar onto bottom of dough in tart pan and BOOM!  Little Sandy Cookie Crust Lemon Tart.

My expectations were high after reading the reviews.   And I was very pleased with the lemon tart.   The right combo of tart and sweet and crust to filling.   And easy to do.  My husband plans to keep lemons in the house in case I get the urge to make this tart.   The stand mixer is strongly recommended in order to make the crust properly.     In the first half of the baking time, I had a pan under the tart pan, in case of spill over.   The filling would not set, so I took the pan away.  It started to set  a couple of minutes later..

This is amazing! Not too tart and not too sweet, But for the filling I used brown sugar instead of white and I put 1 zest of a lime as well because I just love lime. My family was basically moaning while eating this.

An excellent tart filled with lemony wonderfulness that the whole family raved about.  We did find the filling quite sweet so next time I'll try reducing the sugar to 1 cup. I used an 8" tart pan and I made an additional six 3" tarts -- and still had some left over!  Leftovers froze perfectly wrapped in plastic wrap. Definitely a keeper -- thank you ChefChristi!

Great simple recipe! To add a little zing to the crust I put a tablespoon of lemon zest in the sugar and mixed them together with my fingers to release the aroma. Also added a bit of ginger to the filing. I ended up having a bit extra crust dough, and not quite enough filing (but I like my pies filed high) so now i make a third more filing and a third less crust.

Prepared exactly as recipe given. I was a bit skeptical at the way the crust was baked and the filling was setting... however, the dish came out wonderful! Sweet/sour and tasted great! Very easy to make. A definite addition to my recipes! For those first timers: the crust must be blind baked u.til lightly brown ( it will still be soft and may rise a bit, it will settle down when cooled) the filling may not completely set within 20 or30 minutes but when cooled it will set nicely! I used a glass 9" pie dish, worked awesome! Thanks for this recipe! Puckered Good!

This recipe was amazing!! I made it for my husbands birthday. I was a little worried because it looked a little watery,  so I left it in the oven for 10 more min.  Everyone was amazed by the awesome taste. I had to steal me back a piece.  Must make again!

Make this recipe exactly all the time. It's so good, the lemon filling sets perfectly every time. I use a tart pan where the bottom is removable pops out perfectly each time. Our friends & family are always happy to see this tart on holidays or get togethers. Decorate with powdered sugar... so tart & so sweet with the sugar on top just perfect. Thanks for a fabulous recipe. This recipe will always be in my recipe box.

Perfect tang to this tart filling, not to sweet, not to sour! I want a tart that makes my mouth water and this one did. Next time I make it I will reduce the sugar a tad only because I like my tarts on the tart side

 I used mini tart pans for individual servings and they turned out perfect. Just reduced the baking time a bit but I  did keep an eagle eye on the filling toward the end.  Going to make again for guests using full size pan .

On a side note about the crust, I added in some green tea matcha powder and the combination of lemon and green tea was to die for

This was deceivingly simple to make, tasted delicious, and looked beautiful! I skipped the sprinkling of powdered sugar and piped on some whipped cream for decoration around the outer edge and in the center. It was a huge hit with my guests! Very lemony and smooth with a fantastic shortbread crust. I'm definitely keeping this recipe for future use.
