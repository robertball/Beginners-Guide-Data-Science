I made it for my lunch today and it was pretty good. I made the following modifications: I doubled the amount of feta cheese(coz I`m a huge fan of it), added a pinch of cumin + dried parsely to the egg mixture and a few drops of hot sauce to the omelet.

Like many others, I felt this was a good base recipe from which to add your own ingredients to make it 4+ stars.  Personally, I added fresh mushrooms, scallions, and onion to the feta mixture.  Next time I might add fresh garlic or sun-dried tomatoes.  Rolling the omelette seemed to really pull the ingredients together in a lovely way.  Will make again!

I was very pleased with this omelet. Delicious just as it is. In the future, I will use it as a base to make different kinds of omelets with additions such as bacon, onion, tomatoes, and especilly spinach. But loved it very much just as written. Simple and delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Very good and basic recipe.  I halved and just made a regular omelette. I buy feta preseasoned with garlic and herbs.  Yum.  I did add some bacon bits.  Great for brunch!

I added fresh basil and oregano to the feta mixture.  I made this for a light dinner (2 egg omelet) with a salad and glass of wine.  Very good!

Good omelet.  The instructions and method are perfect for me, a self proclaimed omelet scaredy cat.  I love eggs but am scared off of omelets due to the preparation.  This was easy for even me!  I read most of the reviews before making, and I added parsley to the egg itself and sun dried tomato to the feta mixture.  I can see why others thought this was bland--it does need a bit of jazzing up.  I used plenty of salt and pepper, especially since I used egg beaters.  Not entirely sure how I did this, but I made the two omelets in batches and ended up with 3.  I served with toast and pears--nice breakfast, thanks for the recipe.

I loved this omelet. I thought the feta was perfect in the center and the flavor was great with the egg and pepper. I sprinkled with a dash of salt on top just before eating, but it didn't really need it, the feta added so much flavor. Thanks, this is wonderful!

Yum! A tad bland, though. Next time I will add garlic salt. I really liked the way the feta melted into the eggs.

Upon reading some of the least positive reviews, I decided to try and work out what it was 'missing'. For my tastes, it was dill. I added about a teaspoon of dried dill. I think also that the majority of those who were unsatisfied with this dish were missing the 'cheesy' aspect of an American omelette. I would suggest using heavy cream in place of milk, if you have it. The addition of bacon was well received. Salt should be added to this recipe. Rosemary would be a good choice for this recipe as well. I also added a touch of garlic oil, which gave it that final savory note. Caramelized onions and mushrooms would be good as well.

This is so easy and delicious.  I love when I can have next to nothing in the fridge but make a meal this tasty.  I made this as written, but I can see that this would be an easily customizable recipe.  Way to go!

very good!  I added 21 seasoning salute from Trader Joe's because I love that stuff :-) but would have been tasty without it as well.

My kids love this! It is very quick - and quite easy to prepare. I actually used slices of American cheese in place of the feta cheese and milk - as my kids do not like the very salty taste of feta. I prefer this method of making the omelet and then rolling the cheese in it to making the omelet with the cheese broken up in the raw egg liquid - as the cheese remains soft and gooey and tasty and does not get dark and crispy. I made half the recipe at a time and placed a toothpick in the omelet rolls - to keep them together. I will be making this again!

Based on other reviews, I guess I was expecting too much here.  I too added a little oregano, but when all was said and done, it was just OK.  Seems like it's still missing something. Probably won't make again.

A basic omelet with a twist. I like lots of flavor so I added garlic powder, basil, and oregano to the eggs. The cheese didn't melt much; next time I'd add it in sooner.

The milk added in with the feta cheese worked really well for me, it did keep the omelet nice and juicy. I did not care for the rolling method of making omelets, the top and bottom rolled fine but then rolling the sides made everything pucker. For my own preference I added a fresh herb to the eggs (basil I had on hand). Thanks for sharing.

Not very good.  I added some basil for more flavor, but it didn't seem to help.  And I love feta--so I don't know why it didn't appeal to me.
