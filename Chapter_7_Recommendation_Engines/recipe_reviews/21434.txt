Our family has enjoyed this shrimp dish for 36 years. I use 3 to 4 cans of shrimp, and always rinse the canned shrimp very well. We put this in a fish mold and always serve with triscuit crackers.

Actually I've had this recipe before and it's delicious. My aunt use to make this every year for christmas but I think she only used 1/2 can of the soup and green onion rather than regular. Great with vegetable crackers!

This is an old stand-by recipe.  I do prefer using fresh, or frozen shrimp, rather than canned.  (When you read some negative reviewers total reviews, you will begin to notice they didn't like much of anything they had tried.)

Great recipe, it is also great with chicken in the biskit crackers. I garnish top with some parsley and a hard boiled egg. I also used a fish mold and used hard boiled egg for eyes.

I love this dip.  My mom used to make it for special occasions.  Somehow I was just craving it and found it here. I will be making it this weekend.  Delish.

'Not enough shrimp.  'Not enough flavor.  'Not worth the money.  I'd enjoy an onion soup mix & sour cream dip better.

My husband made this for a party we had last weekend; it was delicious! In addition to the two cans of shrimp, he added 1 can of crabmeat. He omitted the green peppers.  We ate it with Truscuits, and when those ran out we used carrot and celery sticks!

This recipe is delicious. My mother in law used to make it and I could not find recipe until now. I omit horseradish and it is still wonderful. Great with triscuits!

This dip takes a little time and cooking and needs to be chilled ahead, but the taste is worth it!

I've been looking all over the internet for a shrimp dip or spread that uses horseradish.  Shrimp just isn't right without it for this girl!  Thanks for posting it!

I have been making this dip for all family functions for years, always a huge hit.  Only change is I skip the green pepper because my sone doesnâ€™t care for it, not missed at all. Great with wheat thins.

My mum made this shrimp dip every year at Christmastime, when she seemed to be constantly hosting. Her recipe had double the amount of onion, and she also just sprinkled the gelatin powder on top of the tomato soup as it was heating, so I made those two changes. I loved it then and still love it now.

This is an old favorite of mine. I add tarragon, a little old bay and use 3 cans of shrimp. Have also substituted the 'fake' crab for this and get rave reviews. Crazy as it seems, you can also leave out the gelatin, add a little milk and have a great cold (or hot)soup for entertaining.
