I doubled the recipe and substituted the vegan margarine for the soft Imperial margarine that I had in the fridge. Quite pleased with the results. 20 Minutes at 350 was enough in my oven. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Love this simple recipe! Lemon zest is the key to being out the sweetness in this recipe. The almond milk makes it surprisingly moist! Will definitely be making this a lot!

Very good.  Just used a cup of blueberries since I didn't have raspberries.  Also used soy light vanilla milk since I didn't have almond milk.

I made 6 jumbo muffins. They were delicious, but took about 40 minutes to bake

I agree with another reviewer who said the muffins turned out flat on top.  Mine did too and I followed the ingredients and instructions exactly.  They were tasty but did  not rise at all.

A very good muffin recipe.  My only problem was that the muffins came out a bit flat on top.  Perhaps user error!  Taste was delicious, presentation okay.  I used Original Almond milk instead of vanilla.  I will make these for non-vegan friends too.  It's really a good recipe!

My daughter and i really liked these. We added about half the oil and made up the other half with applesauce. They are a bit lemony and for my husband too fruity...but hey, that's what they are!
