These were fabulous and very easy to make! I thought the whole packet of Taco Seasoning would be overwelming but it's just right. Not too salty at all, this is very kid friendly and we had no leftovers!!! YUM! Be sure to give this one a try!

Excellent recipe, served mine with french fries and a green salad. My only complaint was, when I looked at the amount of ingredient for the breading, I thought no way will this coat 2 lbs. of chicken. So I doubled the cornmeal and flour, thank goodness I did, I just barely had enough at that, but I only had the one package of taco seasoning. So the spicing was pretty subtle and needed a little salt added at the table. But my two-year-old loved it! So I think when I make it again I might try 1-1/2 packets of seasoning so the flavor is still mild enough for the kids to enjoy but a little stronger for the adult's palates. I also think I will bake the strips instead of frying them (although the coating stayed on beautifully during the frying, which is a rarity in my experience.) Thanks for the recipe!

These were great!!  Nice twist to the same old chicken strips.  I actually didn't have cornmeal on hand, so I used breadcrumbs in its place.  I will make these again for sure!

This was good but i think it needs more of a taco taste. You cant really taste the taco seasoning.

My whole family loves this recipe. I bake the chicken instead of frying it and it always turns out great.

im giving the idea of this a 5. i didnt follow the recipe.i cut chicken breast into 'nugget' size pieces. tossed them in the taco seasoning mixed with a little flour. then into an egg/milk mixture. and finally into plain panko bread crumbs. baked them @ 375 on a greased sheet pan. they were super yummy this way.

This recipe is really good.  Even my daughter, who doesn't like chicken fingers or nuggets enjoyed these.  They are also good with ranch dressing.
