It tasted like a peanut butter and jam sandwich.  Next time I'll just make a regular strawberry pie.

Loved it! Wow! Puts two very different flavors together for a fantastic and super easy dessert! I made it in a regular graham cracker crust - delish!

Tasty and fairly easy. Not enough crust mix, I made 50% more crust mix than it called for and it ended up working out perfectly. I also used granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar in the whipped filling mixture. The longer you chill this the better, overnight would be great.
