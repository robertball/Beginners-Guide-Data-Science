Terrific recipe! I also like to give the ham a spritz (from a spray bottle) with a good bourbon.

I wasn't looking for a holiday recipe, just wanted to do something a little different.  I didn't dress it up with the fruit which I'm sure would only make it better.  The ham turned out great!  Tastey and easy!

This recipe could have been better if it weren't for the downfall of the ham being SO salty.  That's the problem with smoked hams, so perhaps I'll seek another ham alternative.  I used honey along with the brown sugar and butter to create a sauce that I poured over top of the ham before cooking it.  A few times throughout the cooking, I basted the ham with the sauce.  The ham is juicy and the sweetness of the brown sugar and honey help disregard some of the saltiness.

I used this recipe for my first Thanksgiving.  It was quick and easy.  Great for the novice cook.

This is now my recipe ( in the family )! I am asked to bring this ham everywhere I go. For the last half hour...I start to baste the ham just like you would a turkey...it really spreads the sugar around and keeps it juicy! We tend to buy large hams and double the recipe...the ham is great on sandwichs the next day!

I scaled this down to 9 servings, and just used the brown sugar, dried mustard, and balsamic vinegar.  It was great!  I'll definetly use it again and again.

To the bronw sugar mixture, I added some horseradish, which we all thought enhanced the flavor.

I used a precooked ham and it still turned out great.  Excellent flavour for a ham lover.  I used pineapple rounds and mandarin oranges instead of cherries.  Its in my recipe box forever now.

I did this for yesterday's Easter dinner- Yummy!  I actually baked it with orange slices toothpicked on- it gave it a tangier flavor.  This ham is so beautiful looking and oh so tender.  This will be my permanent ham recipe from now on! Thanks!

This glaze was very good!  I thought maybe a little less orange juice, but hubby thought it was perfect!

Perfect, we loved this! Very simple to do and that's the best part. I didn't bother with the fruit, well actually I didn't have it. But it was fabulous without fruit, I'm sure it's even better with it. Thanks for this keeper!
