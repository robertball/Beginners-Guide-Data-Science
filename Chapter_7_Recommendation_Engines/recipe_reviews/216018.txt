Sounded good but had no flavor. The upside is that is very cheap to make and can be tweeked.

I made this, replacing the broccoli cheese soup with fiesta nacho cheese soup (after reading complaints that it was bland and the broccoli didn't work well) and substituting fresh mushrooms for canned (a matter of personal preference).  
I thought that it was delicious, and especially recommend substituting in the fiesta nacho soup, it has a nice zip to it.

I thought it was a great comfort food, as did the rest of the people who ate it.  As for it not having flavor, I didnt feel that way, but you can always add seasoning.  The onion thing is an issue, just remember to add it to the ingredients you get.  AND it warms up nice :)

Onion? What onion? No mention of onion in ingredient list. Will use something other than broccoli cheese soup for this, really doesn't go with this dish.

This dish has no taste.  The directions refer to adding onions but there aren't any listed in the Ingredients.  And you shouldn't be sauteing peppers, onions and sausages all at the same time, the peppers take much longer to soften.  I put them all together as the recipe directed and had to let it cook much longer so the peppers would soften up.  It is completely bland, there is no taste to it at all.

Based on reviews I did alter this recipe slightly...I started to saute the peppers first while I chopped the onion and added 2-3 cloves of fresh garlic minced...I let that cook for a few min.  then added the sausage. I followed the rest of the recipe as is minus the mushrooms and I didn't mind the broccoli cheese soup I also added salt and pepper to taste and sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on top! I thought it turned out fine I think the garlic helped to add some flavor. No leftovers so didn't get a chance to try it reheated. This wasn't the best dish I've made but it's quick and easy so i'm sure I'll be making it again in the future!!

I used the wrong sausage, so it didn't taste as good as I thought it should, but it still turned out out pretty well.

As always, I took a look at the previous reviews to see, what if anything, needed to be improved or reworked. I always add onions to everything, so I was glad to see that they were, indeed, an ingredient that was just omitted from the list.

1. I sauteed the onion and pepper in olive oil with a little garlic powder, then added the sausage. 
2. I used shell pasta (8 oz. or 1/2 box) instead of rice because we'd had rice twice already this week.
3. I added some seasoned salt and fresh cracked black pepper to give it a little oomph at the very end. 

All in all, it was quite tasty. I agree with others that another cheesy soup (Fiesta, Nacho, etc.) might boost this flavor more.

Sub fiesta nacho cheese soup or add green chilies.  Cut the rice in half.

I waited until after I made it to read the comments (I was in a hurry). I agree with most of the other people, replace the broccoli cheddar with something else, or just leave it out completely. I thought the combination was good, besides the cheddar broccoli, which did not go well. Personally, I think it ruined the dish.

I added salt and pepper. And would recommend cooking the onion, pepper, and sausage separately (and use a little oil for the onion and pepper).

Making this tonight for dinner! Thanks for putting it up. I had a copy from a magazine, but can't find it, and the Hillshire Farms website recipe is all messed up. Thanks again!
