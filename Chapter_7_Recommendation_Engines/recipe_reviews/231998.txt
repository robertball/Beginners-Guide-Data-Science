This is phenomenal. I added about 3 TBSPs of BBQ sauce, an extra egg and a half cup of uncooked oatmeal. I made this the night before my dinner party and refridgerated it, which really help to "set" it and bring out the flavors.  Because it was initially chilled it was easy to remove from the meatloaf pan and it sliced very well without crumbling. I sliced it all up before reheating and serving. I served this with a traditional brown gravy. All my guests talked about it for weeks afterwards.

Almost an epic fail!!!  I didn't have 3 cans of black, so I threw in a can of garbanzo...which didn't like to be mashed...things got messy...but anyway--

I used 2 cans black, one garbanzo, 7oz can green chiles, one egg, sleeve crackers, onion, a little taco and ranch dip, frozen sweet corn, cheese.  

Put in a dish like brownies, didn't form a loaf.  My family LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  Served with brown rice and garlic and butter sauted green beans and spinach.  Big hit :)

Next time I will make it with maybe a can of Northern beans, the garbanzo beans were a tad dry, and will try to make it vegan.

Fantastic!  I added one can of diced black olives, minced 3 cloves of garlic, and two diced adobo peppers, (we like it spicy) and it was AWESOME!  Great recipe, the kids loved it, and it's healthy!  Thanks!

This was a huge hit in our house.  My son was claiming the last piece afraid he wouldn't get another bite after 3 pieces already.  I did put in BBQ sauce because I thought it might be dry.  I didn't have Ranch seasoning mix so I made my own with 3tbsp parsley, 1 tbsp dill weed, 1 tbsp granulated garlic, 1 tbsp granulated onion, 2 tsp salt and 1tsp pepper.   I used the whole eggs (opps).  I served it with guacamole on the top.

We ate it with Mexican Rice, Garden Salad and Pineapple.

Things I would do differently.  I would not add in the jalopenos directly into the mixture but let people add there own heat on top afterwards.

Great Recipe.  Thanks for sharing it will be on our supper rotation list.

Great.  My concern about the thing turning out to be too dry was groundless.

I subbed one of the cans of beans for refried beans,  added a half a cup of cooked rice and garlic,  onion,  cumin,  coriander, spicy mrs.dash, worstershire and 1/4 cup of beef broth.  It was great.  Didn't even think about meat, and I am a huge meat eater. I'm delighted, I'll be making these meals more frequently.

Made this exactly as written, vegetarian friend said it is definitely a "keeper".  I did as one other review said and refrigerated for several hours before baking.  Tasty, nutritious, would be even better as a side with taco-flavored shredded chicken or carnitas.  I found the end result to be slightly dry, but ended up great with salsa topper.
