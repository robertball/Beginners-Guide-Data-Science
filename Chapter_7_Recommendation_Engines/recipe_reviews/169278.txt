I wound up making a couple small modifications to this. I didn't have cooking wine nor did I have fresh garlic. I omitted the wine and subbed 1/4 tsp garlic salt for each clove.  It was easy and worked out to be rather tasty. I'll happily make this one again.

Really great recipe!! I tried it last night after having recently switched over to becoming a vegetarian (or more accurately a pescetarian), but it was fabulous! I cut it into strips and served it over salad! It was fabulous! A great substitute for steak! Will definitely cook again!

This is basically what I've always done with portobellas when I'm in a time crunch, so it was nothing special to me, but that doesn't keep it from being a fast, easy go-to. Two notes: 1. For those who thought it was too vinegary, it could be the quality of your balsamic. The longer it's aged the sweeter and mellower it tends to be. 2. Cooking wine is pretty much bad wine with salt added. Never cook with wine you wouldn't drink and trust me, you would never drink the stuff sold as "cooking wine."

Scrumptious!!! The best tasting mushrooms....so good that I made them last night, and I went to the store this afternoon to make them again tonight!...I used only 1 tblspn of the balsamic and kept everything else the same....I did use white wine cause thats what I had on hand. I bet red wine would be even better because its richers and the portobello is a very "meaty mushroom". Thanks so much for this very tasty dish.

I have to say, I really enjoyed the flavor of this. I cooked as directed, except I used my favorite red drinking wine instead of cooking wine (a bit less than called for) because I had it on hand. Then, after it was cooked, I made 'burgers' by putting the mushrooms on toasted whole grain burger buns and topped with bleu cheese and spring mix salad greens (instead of lettuce). It was great and I didn't even need any other condiments because the mushrooms came out very juicy! I will say that they do shrink up quite a bit during cooking, and I could have eaten two easily. Next time I would add something to the menu to make it more of a meal. My last little tip - toasting the buns will keep them from getting too soggy. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

Very easy and very good. Forget the cooking wine; use a drinkable middle-shelf wine (you need a glass to go with your meal anyway, right?). The mushrooms shrink up quite a bit; one is definitely not enough for a serving. I'm going to try sprinkling them with freshly grated Parmesan during the last ten minutes of cooking.

My only advice is to use regular wine instead of cooking wine and you will have a 5 star side dish. Delish!

This is great!  Quick and easy.  I made this into a sandwich with roasted red pepper and a slice of fresh mozzarella on a ciabatta role with basil pesto. YUMMY!

left the wine out, but the mushrooms were amazing!! i LOVE balsamic and this is def. not lacking in the vinegar flavor. Used over a spinach and tomato salad without salad dressing. Enough flavor to carry the salad

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but these were too vinegar~y.  I tried to add some bleu cheese on top like some others suggested, but still the vinegar was overpowering. Bummer.

These were decadent!  I had no wine--it never gets saved for cooking ;)--but I replaced it with chianti vinegar, which was very suitable.  I doubled the garlic and crushed the cloves to release more flavour.  I also added a generous amount of fresh ground pepper and basil.  I sauted them until soft, and the skillet captured all of the mushrooms' savoury juices, blending them with the other flavours.  Delicious!  What a perfect complement to beef!!!

Very Easy, I put mine into a ziplock bag to marinate. Then put them onto a cookie sheet to cook. Wonderful flavor and soooo easy. Will be making this again.

I knew this was going to taste good, I just didn't know it was going to taste AMAZING.  I used some Two Buck Chuck Cab Sauv for the wine, and drank a glass while the mushrooms marinated.  I served it over whole wheat couscous with string beans and water chestnuts on the side.  So savory and delicious!  I haven't had meat in a very long time and don't miss it one bit, but this would be an amazing substitute for steak.

I used a small glass pan to make two big mushrooms with this recipe, and they turned out great. I also took a couple of whole garlic cloves and roasted them along with the mushrooms. As a finishing touch, a flash of fresh parmesan cheese, a touch of bread crumbs and a few slivers of green onion make it look stellar.

The only modification I made was to double the recipe because I had five mushrooms.  I used red wine that I already had in my pantry.  I did not like the flavor, my son said it was "okay" but did not have seconds as he normally does.  This was just not my kind of flavoring I guess.

Really good.  I didn't have a lot of time, so I put all the ingredients in a frying pan and sauted each side until cooked through.  I served them on whole wheat bagel thins with pepperjack cheese on top.

I loved this!  Super easy and they were so juicy!  My only suggestions (and what I did) are to definitely use a wine that you'd drink and a quality aged balsamic for richness.  I'll be making these again and again for sure!

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Unfortunately, the mushrooms were far too vinegar tasting. I will make again but halve the vinegar next time.

This is the best portobello recipe I've ever tried!! I left out the cooking wine, added dried parsley, and served over warm couscous with tomatoes, green onions, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper in it. My whole family raved about it, including my 3 and 5 year olds. I've just found my recipe for our Valentine's dinner :)

Delicious as a burger! A lot of marinades tend to use so much vinegar it becomes all you can taste. The wine provided a nice balance. I marinated whole caps (using a nice Merlot in place of cooking wine). I also used Tamari in place of Soy - probably not a big difference but it was all I had. All the ingredients were whisked together in a measuring cup and poured inside of the caps. After a while I flipped them briefly to get a little of the marinade on the outside as well.

I then grilled the caps with a sprinkling of Gorgonzola, and served them up on a hard roll. My boyfriend had only had portobellos once before and had not been sold on them then. With this recipe he could not stop raving about how delicious they were, "...better than steak" were his exact words.

Who needs beef when this is available! I do not use alcohol so I had to ask the clerk at liquor store for advice. Don't do that! Just get a mid shelf white wine, not the cheapest you can get. Even with cheeeeep wine this was still very good, easy to make.

I've been looking for a marinated portobello mushroom recipe since my boyfriend loves mushrooms and this one is the best yet.  I love the sweet-sour tang of the vinegar, perfect over rice and couscous.  The marinade makes my kitchen smell yummy.  I've made these twice in one week after the BF gave his overwhelming stamp of approval, and I can stop looking for recipes!

Use regular red wine in place of cooking wine and it's a winner. I personally throw some red peppers into the marinade and remove them before cooking then saute them before the mushrooms are done. Throw it on some focaccia with greens and you've got a winner.

I love these mushrooms. I usually make them with baby portobellos instead of full caps and serve it over brown rice.

Very nice. I grilled these instead of baked, and melted some low fat swiss during last few minutes of cooking. Served on some whole wheat sandwich thins with horseradish sauce, spinach, grilled onions, and tomatoes. Tasty burgers!

Pretty good, served with rice pilaf with asparagus. Will try a dash of Worcestershire sauce, a little more soy sauce, and reduce a little balsamic vinegar to try and make a touch more savory, more like meat.

This is good, simple recipe. Made it without cooking wine because I didn't have any. It's still good without it! 25 minutes in the oven had them to the tenderness I like.

Made it as directed, except I had no wine.  Still came out perfect, and smelled wonderful while it was baking.  Superb, this will be added to my regulars!!  Looking forward to trying it as  Portobello sandwich with mozzarella, roasted red peppers on a wrap.. may add some fresh spinach as well

Delicious!  Paired with quinoa and roasted red potatoes.  Substituted soy sauce with coconut aminos and olive oil with coconut oil.  I used a new bottle of white wine, the taste stood out a bit, but it was still great.

Ever since I found this recipe I've used it as my go to for a portobello mushroom marinade. I make the recipe mostly as is, here are my changes:
1. Use red cooking wine, doesn't say which to use, or can use whatever red wine is on hand at the time. 
2. Minced garlic, the one found near the produce not dried, vs garlic clove. 
3. Then I add a some water to make more liquidy. 
4. If needed I add a little more of stuff like garlic or vinegar to taste. 
5. Place the mushrooms stem side up and spoon some liquid into the cap and let sit. Remove stem if grilling and marinade as well. 
We prefer to grill them, so this works better for us and is still very flavorful!

I did not make any changes.  Made it exactly how it said and it was the tastiest mushrooms I have ever had!  Never knew mixing those ingredients together could make such a marvelous dish.  Will most def be making this more often.  Not to mention the aroma the house had from it cooking was tantalizing!

The only change I made was to use a drinkable cabernet instead of cooking wine. I served mine on toasted buns with pesto, goat cheese, roasted red peppers, and beet greens. My fiance said he would eat "like 18 more of those", and I agreed. So good!

This was delish!! I  used 1/4c cooking sherry in place of the wine and doubled the garlic. I also cut the mushroom before marinating/baking. Served over mixed green salad and used the liquid and garlic as the "dressing" it was so good!

This is really good.  I only use 1 tbsp of the vinegar though.  I also use the marinade as a soak for meats sometimes.... Really good on pork chops.

I made this as part of my husband's birthday dinner because he loves mushrooms. I used smaller mushrooms because it was to serve as a topping for gourmet hamburgers otherwise I followed the recipe as written. They were fantastic! In fact, I do not like mushrooms at all and usually omit them from any recipe but these were delicious!

This recipe is GREAT and I'm going to agree with earlier reviews (thank you, btw) because the 1 tbl spoon of balsamic and a regular wine went a long way! We also added a teaspoon of mustard and used BRAGGS instead of soy sauce for the marinade ;-)

After they were cooked we put a little white/fresco crumbly cheese which we sprinkled with dried rosemary, a bit of comte and a dash of asiago. We broiled it to brown the cheese and then made it into a sandwich! It was "mmmm" in every bite!

Mushrooms turned out excellent! Made some slight modifications - instead of soy sauce used Worcestershire Sauce, used Sauvignon Blanc and added some Rosemary.  I also added more olive olive than called for to cut down on the acidity.

The flavor was kind of sour and not really my cup of tea. I think this was a personal preference type thing though. Feel free to try it if you want. Just know that I wasn't too fond of it.

I made this last year as a vegetarian option to sandwich meat at the Welcome back luncheon for our teachers.  It got rave reviews by vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  I will be sharing this recipe widely and will definitely use it again.  I took the advice of others and used a mid-level wine we had on hand.  Scrumptious! *** 8/20 - UPDATE *** I am still using this recipe 3 years later and this consistently gets rave reviews by vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.  I just use a mellow, red wine instead of cooking wine.  I double the amount and do 4 portobello caps at a time.  I re-use the marinade to do another round after taking the tray out of the oven.  For in-school sandwich buffets, I slice then refrigerate the mushrooms and serve them close to room temperature on the buffet.  Thanks again for sharing!  Amazing!

I used marsala wine and it turned out great! I used just a touch less vinegar than the recipe called for (about 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of 2).  Same for the soy sauce.

Very flavorful, and easy. Next time I will use red table wine, rather than cooking wine, and use a low-sodium soy sauce. I found the dish too salty for my taste. This is definitely a dish worth customizing. I imagine adding a green vegetable and onion to the marinade, perhaps green beans. Tonight I roasted cauliflower, and served cheese garlic bread.

This recipe is SO so so good! It's become my go-to for perfect shrooms everytime, whether I finish them on the grill for meaty mushroom burgers, or use in a saute, or make baby bella stuffed mushrooms. I follow the recipe but use drinkable red wine and regular soy sauce. After the mushrooms cook, the cooking liquid/marinade is like liquid gold....it's delicious!

Husband and I loved it. Used port wine and 2x the garlic. Found it really easy to put together and  bake. Totally adding this to our rotation of meals.

I cooked these with no modifications and they were great on a bun with all the fixings. Also used cut up in some rice and bean recipes also very tasty.

Here's an accident you may want to do on purpose! I had started marinating the caps, being sure to spoon plenty of marinade into the caps themselves, when I realized I had forgotten the garlic.  I minced up the two cloves and decided to put all the garlic directly into the marinade inside the caps with none in the outside marinade. I baked them for only 20 minutes with no flipping. With tongs I pulled the mushroom out draining the marinade but leaving all of the garlic bits inside the caps. Garlicky yummyness!

Very good! I used red drinking wine instead of cooking wine and only 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.

It's a good try, but I thought it was too vinegary too!  Used real red wine and only half the balsamic.  It was okay,

These were so super easy to make, and I picked this recipe to try because I actually had all the ingredients on hand.  It was so simple, and DELICIOUS!  These are definitely a keeper.  I ran out of garlic cloves but used powder in it's place...
