Wonderful soup! Hit the spot on a cold Winter's day! Immediately upon reading this recipe, I knew I had to use more of some of the ingredients ~ I used three carrots, 1/2 cup barley, three cloves of garlic and a tad more Italian seasoning.  I also used hot Italian sausage.  I might take the advice of other reviewers and add a can of diced tomatoes next time too! Another thing...this feeds way more the four people it says.  My large crockpot was overflowing!  That's not a problem, though, because now I have some for the freezer!

This is a really good and hearty soup.  I used 8 c of chicken broth, 3 carrots (per other reviewers) and doubled the amount of barley, since I'm a huge barley fan.  I cooked the soup in the crock pot for 8 hours (overnight) and then put in the fridge to later be heated up when I got home from work.  I think it really let the flavors marry.   Maybe next time I will try making this with hot Italian sausage (use bulk; easier to cook) and will keep the sausage in bigger pieces.  I will definitely be making this one again!

This is my new FAVORITE soup! I used hot sausage and it was amazingly good. Doubled up on the seasoning and garlic and used one bag of baby carrots. AWESOME!

Well, I made a couple of changes to the original recipe based on other reviewers' suggestions, and it turned out SO GOOD!  :)  I used 3 carrots instead of 1, added quarter cup each of frozen peas & carrots, a can of italian style diced tomatoes, and 2 beef bouillon cubes.  Unfortunately, my soup ended up cooking for 11 hours while I was at work, so my only complaint was that the spinach was a little slimy and the veggies and barley were mushy...but it certainly didn't detract from the awesome taste!!  As others said, it isn't the prettiest soup in the world, but it tastes so good, that I will definitley make this again (and would for company, too!  :)

Delicious! I used hot Italian sausage, cut into chunks, and it gave the soup such a kick. I used two carrots and a little more barley (1/3 cup) as suggested, tossed in some dried basil/oregano/garlic salt (didn't have Italian seasoning on hand) and skipped the spinach, as I haven't had luck with keeping spinach non-slimy in soup. It was so good! We heated up the left-overs the next night and it was still just as delicious. The light chicken broth complemented the spicy sausage really well.

An excellent soup for a cold day!  I added shredded carrot (I don't care for sliced carrots), a can of diced tomatoes, a can of sliced mushrooms, and used hot sausage.  I don't understand comments that it didn't look good--it looked like homemade soup!  And as for it being thick as a leftover, well, that's how we like our soup.  Great flavor!

I used hot Italian sausage, real spinach, extra barley and mushrooms when I made this.

I made this twice for a group of guys doing construction in near zero temps. Both times they thought it was great and asked me to send the recipe to their wives. Really warms a cold belly!

This soup was alright - certainly not up there with some of the others I have tried.  I made it exactly as written, without modification.  The soup was absolutley swimming in spinach, green in appearance, slimy in texture.  The sausage was a nice change, and the barley was good.  The leftovers went uneaten (a rarity in my house).  Would not make again.

We really liked this soup. I used some turkey smoked sausage I had on hand, slicing into small pieces. It was good, but I think using Italian sausage as written is more suited for the soup. The carrot and spinach were really good, I used 6oz fresh spinach with no problems. I agree with reviews that you should increase the barley, at least to 1/3c, maybe up to a half. I did make this on the stove to suit my schedule and it worked really well: cook up the sausage/onion/garlic in a soup kettle, add broth and seasoning and bring it to a boil, add barley and cook in the soup according to package directions, about 20 mins before it should be done add in the veggies and finish cooking. Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely a wonderful winter soup. I used hot Italian sausage and it was even better to eat the next day.

I'm not sure how anyone could say this soup has little flavor if you used the ingreds suggested by the submitter! 

I doubled the garlic, tossed in some fresh Basil (in the last 20 min of cooking), added a can of mushrooms including the juice from the can, and about a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  

Everything else was used/measured exactly as suggested.  

The spinach was not slimy or over powering.  All in all it was a very good, rib stickin', hearty soup!  

PLEASE NOTE*
The next morning I decided to do something WILD with some of the leftover soup.  I scooped out 2 lg heaping ladles of the soup, and place it into a strainer. I saved the juice in a bowl. I picked out the carrot chunks.  I whisked up 4 lg eggs with about 3 T. of the reserved strained off juice. I heated a cast iron frying pan with about 2 T. olive oil it. I sliced in some left over baked potatoes and laid them in a flat layer. I let them warm up a bit, and then poured the whisked egg soup juice mixture over the spuds. I then spooned the well drained soup mixings over the eggs.  I put on a lid to help heat up the egg mixture, but watched close so I didn't scorch the spuds in the pan.  I used a wide spatula to gently cut the mixture into 1/4 ths and gently flipped it over to brown the top side.  I kept the heat at a gentle medium.  

This sounds insane, but it made a GREAT Frittata!! True gourmet flavor! My Sweetie said it was off the charts! I have to agree.

Overall it was good. I ate more than my husband did, and after a few days the dog got the leftovers. It wasn't quite the right flavor combos. It was missing something. It also was a bit oily for my personal tastes.

The only change I made was that I substituted 1 lb. of mild sausage meat that I precooked and drained before adding to the soup. A wonderful cold weather dish that tastes as good as it smells when cooking! When served I sprinkled the top with Parmesan cheese. It's a keeper I've made several times.

This soup is very good. To avoid slimy spinach, I used a bag of fresh spinach and added it just before serving.

"I would eat this every night!!"  A direct quote from my husband.  I made it on the stove, with brown rice, added more veggies, and used turkey sausage.  Delish!

After reading the reviews, I decided to use kale instead of spinach, which worked wonderfully. If you want to stick with the spinach, I would only add it during the last few minutes of cooking. The kale can go into the crockpot at the beginning.

the flavors mingle perfectly in this soup into a taste sensation! my husband hates spinach but I didn't tell him what it was and he is addicted to this soup. I make it at least once a month.

Excellent soup after a few additions.  I made it according to the original directions but found it lacked the "oomph" I wanted.  I used 3 carrots, extra onion, 1/2 C barley and a can of tomatoes.  It is awesome.  This is a make ahead soup as it is even better the next day!

Wonderful soup.  I tripled the barley.  Used turkey sausage and added spice with lots of ground red pepper flakes and pepper.  Used vegetable stock concentrate (which is high in sodium) so it was a little salty (but my mistake for not using vegetable broth).  I will make this often.  Wonderful cold weather hearty soup.  Oh - used the crock pot for ease.  Thanks for the recipe.

If I could give 10 stars I would!  We absolutely loved this soup.  I used chorizo sausage and that gave it a nice little spicy flavor.  This is a new favorite around here!  Thank you!

I took the advice of some others and added more carrots and barley as well as a can of diced tomatoes.  I also used fresh spinach.  I would suggest a low salt broth, I didn't use one and it was a little salty but all around a very good recipe. I will definatly make it again but will probably skip the browning step, it wasn't really needed.

I've made this recipe several times and love the simplicity of it. It's my "simpler version" of wedding soup.  Personally I like it with the spicy Italian sausage, more carrot and barley.  I like my soups to more stew-like.  I've also added a 1/2 c. of dry white wine at the end of the onion, sausage and garlic cooking time - I love the added flavor component it gives this soup.  Great topped with grated Parmesan cheese and completely well with some warm crusty bread and a glass of white wine.

I followed this recipe as witten but to be honest I was not a fan. The flavors just did not seem to complment each other.  The over all taste was way to bland even after adding seasoning.  Pretty sure this is something I will not make again.

Absolutely fabulous. I did make 2 small changes. I used poultry Italian sausage and I used escarole instead of spinach.
 I will make this part of my regular menus.

This recipe was awesome!  My husband and I really loved it!  I made only one change...instead of italian sausage, I used Hillshire Farms Smoked sausage.  I did not do the step where you brown the sausage, I just cooked the onions and garlic and then added the sliced sausage to the crock pot.  I'm sure that the italian sausage would be awesome too!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I halved recipe using just 1 spicy Italian sausage (crumbled).  As written, I'd have to give it a 4* (for our taste buds anyway).  Ended up throwing in a chunk of parm cheese rind which really gave it a boost of flavor, but it was still missing something.  Finally threw in a handful or two of cooked small shell pasta which really turned it into more of a stew ... but it was delicious.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Love this recipe!! Did increase the barley to 1/2 cup and used hot Italian sausage. Such a hearty flavorful soup. Will definitely make this recipe again!

Great flavor and variety of ingredients. We used frozen peas instead of spinach, adding them a couple of hours before eating so they didn't get mushy. I quadrupled the amount of barley.

this recipe was just ok. It is exactly like wedding soup (party italian wedding soup from this website) only it uses sausage instead of meatballs. This recipe is much better made with meatballs. The only thing I may take away from this recipe is the barley...I will use it on my wedding soup.

Taste was good, but appearance was not. It made a large pot of soup and we had so many leftovers, but they were not very good. By the next day, the barley had soaked up all of the broth and it was way too thick for my taste.

Good soup, and the flavor will vary depending on what kind or brand of sausage you use.  I added two carrots and think it could use at least three.  I also thought 1/4 c. of barley wasn't enough--definitely needs at least 1/2 c.  Nevertheless, it is a good soup and a good change from usual chicken or beef soup.

this was my first crockpot recipe ever.  i prepared the ingredients the day before and i threw everything in the next morning.  husband tried some at lunch and called me at work to say the soup was good.  son and daughter enjoyed the soup too.  i enjoyed the soup; however, found it a tad bit salty even though i added no salt.  next time i will substitute some of the broth for water.  this one's a hit in our house and i especially appreciate dinner being ready when i get home from work.  will definitely make again!

This soup was very tasty.  It was sooo easy to make and made the house smell awesome.  I added extra carrot which made it a little thicker.  I also plan to add more barley next time I make it.  My 3-year old loved it and she is a very picky eater!

Brilliant fall dinner.  I used sweet italian turkey sausage to cut down on fat. I also added mushrooms (sautéed in olive oil with garlic and onions).  I added three carrots, as others have done and doubled the barley, and used 64 oz of low sodium chicken stock.

It was delicious.

Took 5 minutes to prep and 4 hours to cook in the slow cooker! And plenty for the freezer, too.

I was surprised how yummy this soups actually was. I will make again. I took the advice of others and added extra carrot, barley and garlic to this recipe as well as replaced Italian sausage with spicy sausage. The only issue I see with the instructions is adding the garlic and Italian seasoning before draining the meat. You will loose all the seasoning u just added. Cook the onion and sausage until almost brown, drain and then add garlic, seasoning to the meat a cook for another couple minutes before moving to the next step. Don't pour all the flavour down the drain.

This recipe was delicious! I followed the advice of some other reviewers and used 8 cups of chicken broth (instead of 6 cups), hot Italian sausage, fresh spinach, and I added mushrooms. I didn't add the fresh spinach to the slow cooker until an hour before it was done so it was not so soggy.

A wonderful winter warmer. I added 8 oz of sauteed mushrooms, tripled the barley and used a little cornstarch to thicken it. I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen.

Wonderful soup! I used hot Italian sausage, added an extra carrot and doubled the barley, per reviews. Next time I will substitute kale for the spinach because it does hold up better to long cooking (spinach was indeed a little slimy). This was pretty spicy so I imagine you could use sweet Italian sausage and add a small amount of red pepper flakes to spice it up just a little if  hot sausage is too hot for your taste. We loved it and will definitely make this again. A great crock pot recipe!

Wonderful  winter soup! Prepared as directed, except the barley. I Forgot to buy barley so we cooked rice separately and served over it.  I read through some of the other reviews.  I agreed over powering in spinach. Will add a can of diced toms next time and use hot or spicy sausage.

Im very confused with this recipe. I love soups, I love barley, I love sausages... yet this soup tasted bad.  I went by the recipe step by step. How could me outcome be so different then all the other high reviews? Really, Im left totally confused.

I forgot that this was ideally a slow cooker recipe and so I ended up making it on the stovetop instead when I was pressed for time.  I still thought it came out pretty good, and I imagine it would be even better if the flavors had blended together all day.
I liked this because with the spinach and  barley and carrot (I actually tripled the amount of carrots) it felt "healthy" but the Italian sausage kept it from feeling TOO virtuous.  
I added substantially more of the Italian seasoning and barley than the recipe called for, as written it would have been a bit underseasoned for my taste.

AMAZING flavor!  I used an entire onion, two carrots, and a full cup of hulless waxy barley.  Because I used Hot Jimmy Dean sausage, I omitted the garlic and Italian seasoning.  4 hours in the crock pot was perfect.  We like spice, and the Hot Jimmy Dean gave this soup the kick we were looking for.

I have made this a few times, and what I do now is: - add 1 bag baby carrots - add more minced garlic - use Chicken sausage - Put the italian seasoning, onions, and garlic together to sautee and do the sausage separately so that the onions don't burn - add Cheese tortelloni instead of barley.. makes for a MUCH heartier soup! - I use two boxes of organic chicken broth (64 oz total) so I add one beef bouillon cube to make it a little more hearty - sometimes I get a can of peeled whole tomatoes and crush them in my hands and add them, but my husband doesn't like tomatoes so I usually leave them out - Just before serving add a dash of "Texas Pete's HOTTER hot sauce".... makes it FABULOUS!  Hope this helps.. enjoy :)

The whole family enjoyed this, including young kids.  I sauteed the onion, a green pepper and some garlic first, then added a large bunch of fresh spinach.  I used turkey kielbasa (sliced it up very small) and added a can of italian diced tomatoes (it's what I had).  Excellent!

Yummy and very flavorful!  I made this with italian turkey sausage (using the Homemade Italian Turkey Sausage recipe from this site).  I added the spinach the last two hours of cooking.  I got 6 servings out of this.  Thanks.

I hate to be one of the few dissenters, but I really don't like this soup.  It's just not good or anything to rave about.  We used hot italian sausage and doubled the recipe.  Everything else was as written.  It tastes so green like the spinach overpowers the soup and the flavor lacks complexity.  This one won't be making our book of saved recipes.

Yum!  We really liked this!  I used hot italian sausage, doubled the carrot and used about 1 cup cooked barley.  My package of barley said to cook it before adding it to soups, so that's what I did.

Great soup!  I used spicy Italian sausage and a bit more barley than it called for (I love barley)  I doubled the recipe and froze some for later.  I also put in a bit more carrots.  A very delicious and hearty soup!

This soup was enjoyed by everyone in the family and that is rare!  Doubled the recipe and it was enough to feed five of us for two meals.  I added a little more carrot and more barley.  I used quick-cook barley, cooked it separately and   added it right before serving.

I thought this was wonderful, especially for a slow cooker soup. I added more barley and stock and it was great. Omitted carrots (not a fan).

Wow! This is my new favorite soup. I can't wait to make it again.  The only change I made was to add a healthy pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, and simmer it in a crock pot all day.

This is really good.  Only thing I would change is to decrease the amount of spinach.  I put all 10 oz in and it seemed like way too much, so I added more chicken broth to try to compensate.  Still a lot of spinach.  I would put 1/2 the amount called for.  I cooked mine in a stockpot on the stove for about an hour (for as long as it took the barley to cook).  I also put in more Italian seasoning and a dash of red pepper flakes for some kick.  Would make this again!

I thought this was a decent soup recipe.  It is definately not my favorite from this site and due to the time it takes will probably not make often.  Overall good but not great.  Thanks anyway!

Wonderful soup -- better with beans!  I soak 1 c. dried cannellini beans overnight. I add them to the soup mixture along with an extra 3/4 water. (I suppose you could use extra broth instead.) I've made this with ground pork and ground beef instead of sausage. Great every time.

In my never ending attempt to find different ways to use Italian sausage, I stumbled across this recipe and I am so glad that I did.  I used garlic cheese seasoned Italian sausage and the only changes I made was to add chickpeas and a package of frozen veggies that contained spinach, but also green beans, peas, and edamame.  My kids loved it and my husband couldn't get enough of it, which is always a good sign!  Great recipe!

This recipe is fast, easy and tasty anytime of the year. It's also one that you can change up by adding various ingredients like a little tomato paste, different meats, herbs, different vegetables or pasta/rice in place of the barley.  Try it and see.

This was so bland and unappetizing the first day that I put it in the fridge and made something else instead.  It was more edible the next day, but still not a great dish.  I even added extra seasoning, tomatoes, and so on as recommended.  This was way too time-consuming and expensive for the result.  I won't be making it again.

This was very good.  I did add the tomato's and extra carrots.  It isn't that attractive but the taste outshines it looks.  My whole family loved it.  I did sprinkle with parmesan cheese before serving.

Truly a treat!  Followed the recipe with the addition of a 1/4 cup each of frozen peas and corn.  Also added two beef bouillon cubes for some depth in the flavor.  Will certainly add this to our soup recipe rotation.  Yum delicious!!!!

Great for dinner on a cold night!  Very easy to make!  I added 5 chopped tomatoes with the carrots and some red pepper flakes.  We served it with a loaf of french bread.  Needless to say our family of 5 ate it all up at one meal.  The teenagers wanted to know when we are making it again.

What a find! Thank you for sharing. It was a chilly, rainy day and I knew this was what we would have. I did follow the basic recipe with some mods: Added a parm rind to cook in broth, a half cup or so of red wine, 3 carrots, 5 garlic cloves, can of diced Italian tomatoes, and added fresh spinach and basil at the end. Because I didn't have hot Italian sausage, I used mild but added fennel seeds and some red  pepper flakes. It was soooo good with hot, french bread.

This soup was absolutely delicious.  Another on our list of favourites.  I made two additions.  I doubled the barley and added a 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes.

I’ve made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe as written. I felt it was more spinach soup than barley. This time, though, I used a cup of barley, substituted fresh kale for the spinach. I added a little more chicken broth to make up for the liquid that was supposed to come from the frozen spinach. Came out more of a stew than a soup, but oh, so good!

This soup was delicious, definitely a keeper! I used 3 carrots,  1/2 C barley added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and 1 C sliced mushrooms. Two ways to avoid slimy spinach: for slow cooker, use chopped cabbage instead to cook all day.  For stove top, add 3 C chopped fresh spinach 5 minutes before serving. I Always enjoy both the recipes and the comments!

I have a diverse family and everyone  loved the soup.  I do not have a slow cooker, but I did a low stove top simmer and that is the trick that blends the flavors.  I added extra zucchini from my garden and extra carrots and this soup was a nice change from the ordinary!!!

Tasty, but I would make some changes next time: for my personal taste it called for too much sausage, not enough carrots, not enough barley.  If I make it again I will make these changes. Oh, and we sprinkled grated parmesan cheese on top after placing in our bowls.

Needs more body.  Added raw mushrooms before cooking.  Next time I would saute the mushrooms first with the onions/garlic and sausage.

This soup was really good.  I used ground mild Italian turkey sausage, 1-1/2 lbs.  Also increased the amount of carrots, barley, garlic and broth.  Cooked on high 5 hours and it was amazing.  It made a good amount, with plenty for leftovers.

I've made this soup for years and it is a hit with friends and family alike.  In fact, I served it to a friend who had two helpings and then fell silent.  Concerned by his continuing silence, I asked him if anything were wrong.  "No" he replied, "I'm just trying to think of when I've had a better soup...."
My preparation of this soup differs but slightly from this recipe. 
1.  I add half a cup of barley instead of a quarter cup.
2.  I defrost and wring out the spinach in a towel, then add it just a few minutes before serving so that it doesn't become "slimy"......

I agree with Tammy - this is a wonderful soup! I did the same things she did by adding more carrots, 1/2 c. barley, more garlic and threw in celery and kale (I didn't have spinach on hand). My husband was falling all over me with praise. It was worth every simmering moment. (I used mild sausage, not hot)

The recipe did not call for a specific mild or spicy italian sausage, so i used both. Otherwise I made no changes and this is delicious. Made it today for the guys at work and it was a huge hit.  Thanks!

This was so hearty and delicious!
I took the advice of some other reviewers and changed a few things.... I used hot Italian sausage instead of regular.  I used half a pound bag of baby carrots instead of one regular carrot.  I added a bit more garlic.  I doubled the amount of barley.  I added a can of diced tomatoes and a few dashes of salt and pepper. I did not add the spinach in the beginning. While the soup cooked, I allowed it to defrost and right before serving, I squeezed out as much liquid as I could and then added it to the soup.  Served it with a nice crusty sourdough bread.

Wonderful! Perfect soup for a cold and blustery day. I added more Carrots (several handfuls of  "Baby" Carrots) and I used a whole Onion. I also added a can of Diced Tomatoes.

This recipe puts me in mind of an Italian Wedding Soup -- not exactly, but an easier version. I first made the soup following the recipe and it was good, though it definitely needed some salt and pepper. I made it again with chicken and thyme instead of Italian sausage and Italian spices and it was better. My husband really liked it. I made it a third time with andouille sausage and cajun spices instead of the Italian sausage and It. seasoning and my husband LOVED it. Now he asks for "that Cajun Wedding Soup" on a regular basis. I always cook it in the crockpot overnight on low. What seems like too much spinach at first ends up being just the right amount of spinach after slow-cooking all night. The sausage I use doesn't make hardly any grease so there isn't much to drain; but I can imagine if the meat is greasy, the soup will be, too, no matter how much you drain the meat. So, the verdict is: Italian sausage and Italian spices- four stars / andouille sausage and cajun spices- five stars.

This was excellent! I did have to add more chicken broth. I used about 5 cups and about 1/2 cup of white wine. I also doubled the barley and used only 1/3 of the spinach. I will definitely make this again!

This was a great soup! I used 2 carrots and wish I would have added more barley as I love barley but it was wonderful soup. The rest of the family added hot sauce to their bowls so I think hot sausage would be an awesome idea also!

I actually stuck pretty close to the recipe, except made it on the stove top instead of the crockpot.  Easy and tasty.  Will use again.

Great winter slow cooker recipe. My mods - spicy sausage for a little more flavor, three carrots to have more veggies, better than bouillon instead of canned broth (I think the flavor is much better), and nearly doubled the barley so it was more stew-like.

I added one can diced tomatoes, three carrots, and doubled the barley as suggested by other reviewers.  This soup was delicious!  Next time I will try making it with turkey sausage for a lighter soup.  I also froze it as leftovers, and that worked out well.

I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! AS IS! We love it so much we make it quite often. It's FULL of flavor (we often use chorizo if we can't find hot italian sausage). And it makes great leftovers as well.

This was a quick (prep time), delicious, hearty, fall soup.  I used about half the sausage (all I had left), and 1 tsp oregono, 1/2 tsp thyme and a bay leaf in place of the Italian seasoning.  In addition to the 1/4 cup barley, I added 1/4 cup wheat berries and like others added mushrooms and left out the spinach.  Will definitely repeat!

I really like this soup a lot.  The last time I made it, I didn't measure the barley and put WAY too much in there.  I had to add a whole extra can of chicken brother to thin it out.  I'll make sure I measure better next time!  It's a nice, simple, comforting soup.

I made this for dinner tonight and my boyfriend and I loved it! I added one can crushed tomatoes, used two onions instead of one and added double the Italian seasoning.  I also added one can of great northern beans and used spicy Italian sausage.    I put everything in the crock pot for 6 hours and it turned out great!

This is a wonderfully hearty stew-like soup. Like several of the reviewers, I doubled the carrot, and increased the barley to 1/3 cup. Because my sausage was highly seasoned, I chose to only add salt and pepper to the soup rather than more Italian seasoning.  I've also made this using fresh kale and it was fantastic!

I added a large can of crushed tomatoes, and doubled all the other ingredients except the chicken broth.  It turned out very thick (which I enjoy) and hearty.  I also added some red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Overall a good, hearty meal.  Perfect for cold fall/winter days in upstate NY.  Even though you don't get a bite of sausage in every single spoonful it still feels like it sticks to your ribs.  All in all a good recipe, fun to play around with and modify on your own.  Freezes very well, so you can make a lot and save a lot for later!

Really good; I also used spicy sausage, added more italian seasoning, doubled the barley and used more chicken broth since the extra barley absorbed the liquid (9 cups).  It hit the spot on a cool fall day - it would be perfect with a crusty bread.

I used chicken link sausage that was already cooked--put all the ingredients straight in the slow-cooker and skipped the browning sausage/onions/garlic step (less time, less clean-up). Smelled incredible and tasted great.  Good way to get the kids to eat spinach.  Will definitely make again.

Loved this soup!!!  I used turkey sausage (removed from casings cause I couldn't find bulk turkey sausage) and doubled the barley, italian seasoning, and garlic as I like hearty soups with intense seasonings.  I used four 14 oz cans of chicken broth.  I also thawed then drained the spinach before adding it to the soup.

With the left-overs, I tried adding a chunked up baked potato (skin removed) and it was very tasty - my husband said it was very close to the Zuppa soup at Olive Garden.  The second day of leftovers I added a scoop of leftover mashed potatoes which made it creamy.  My favorite was the first day without the addition of the potatoes but it's nice to be able to easily re-invent leftovers.

Especially with the ease of using a crockpot, I will be making this again SOON!

This is a good soup, and it is relatively fast and easy. I do make a few changes. I use turkey italian sausage, and for sure add more carrots. I use baby carrots cut into thirds. If you are not a huge spinach fan (which I am), cut back on the spinach. Since I am a registered dietician, I will also point out that made with turkey sausage, this is a high-fiber, low-fat recipe!

My husband said I could make this again.  :)  I liked it, too, but felt like the spices were a bit "off", if that makes sense.

This was quite good, and reminded me of Italian wedding soup.  I used 3 carrots instead of one and used fresh spinach rather than frozen... I only added the spinach during the last 10-15 minutes of cooking (I cooked on high in my crockpot for 4 hours).  Yum!

I made this soup for dinner tonight...YUMM!!!  The ONLY problem is that my carrots were a bit al dente...but I used baby carrots...next time I may chop them up.  I didn't have spinach, so I added some diced tomatoes for flavor.  I grated a bit of parmasan cheese on top.  I will def. make this again...and try the spinach too!!

This soup is delicious and easy to make!  I used chopped up browned Italian turkey sausages because I couldn't find ground Italian Sausauge anywhere and dried minced onions instead of fresh as they are easier on the gut.  Four people have already asked me for this recipe.  YUM!

This is a great recipe for the stovetop (which I did, due to time constraints and lack of early a.m. planning!) I even used quick cooking barley, 3/4cup, and broccoli crowns (cut up), no spinach...didn't have....We really enjoyed it and it froze nicely.  Thanks!

Great on a cold snowy day like today. We're holding our "Date Night" right here at home. I started with ground turkey breast. I used a commercial sweet italian sausage seasoning to mix with ground meat (used by the butchers), 3 cloves of garlic, used baby carrots cut in 3's, added 2 ribs of celery & 1 diced potato, 5 cups of water with a heaping TBSP. of Vegetarian chicken broth powder, used extra barley (quick cooking kind),  & since I had no spinach, I skipped it this time, but look forward to trying again with the spinach. Seasoned to taste with sea salt, italian seasoning and a dash of poultry seasoning. Also added one tsp. of low sodium dry onion soup mix. I gave this a five star rating. DH gives it a 4 point 995...he's being a bit technical, I'd say. Will be making this one again, for certain, as I just loved it.

Amazing!!! I tweaked a few things in this recipe... for one, I made it in a stockpot on the stove. I simmered the vegetables in the broth while I was making up the sausage mixture, and added the barley towards the end (cooked for maybe an hour and a half overall- covered part of the time to conserve liquid). I also added more onion, garlic and carrots (definitely add more carrots!!!), and tossed in two celery stalks I had lying around. The soup came out absolutely fantastic, rich, hearty and flavorful; this is definitely a make-again recipe!!!

Very tasty and easy. I will certainly make this again with only these minor changes.
After draining the sausage, I will put on a paper towel covered dish  to absorb more of the grease before putting in the crockpot and will cook for only 4 hours on low, perhaps adding the spinach after 1 hr.

I made this just as written, with the exception of throwing in the whole package of Italian sausage (more than called for).  My husband and I loved it--very flavorful and tasty.  We ate nearly the whole pot ourselves for supper during the recent cold snap here in south Georgia.

Excellent - great flavor, great texture and thickness.  Hub won't do spinach right now due to health scare, so I subbed with what was on hand - tomatoes, eggplant, cauliflower.  I  only used 32 oz of broth and the remaining 16 oz water to cut the sodium.  I  added 2 heaping tbsp of ground flax seed.  Crock pot all day - and it was truly great.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

This is delicious! I have made it twicw so far, using sweet chicken sausage once and chicken sausage with romano cheese and broccoli the second time. I don't add as much broth as   in recipe and do add  extra barley. Comes out thick, but I like it that way. Also added more carrots. This is definitely something I'll make frequently!

This soup tastes good but doesn't look very appetizing in the bowl. I used drained canned spinach but I am sure frozen would taste even better. I also used German sausage. But even my son ate the entire bowl, while trying to avoid looking at it.

Very good and nice change from the usual. Easy to throw together in the morning or the night before.  I agree with the previous reviewer and would add more carrots ( 3 or 4) and 1/2 cup of barley. Thanks for a very good recipe.

Wonderful soup. I used 1/2 cup of barley, went heavier on the onion and garlic, heavier on the carrots and used smoked turkey sausage. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and cooked this on the stovetop. It was very yummy!

This is a favorite in this house, but it is a bit salty for our taste.  I would suggest using salt-free chicken broth and definitely do not add more salt.  

Also I STRONGLY suggest adding the frozen spinach immediately before serving without a lot of simmering... otherwise it will somehow become a slime-y mess of spinach. Trust me on this. 

Try this recipe...you'll make it more than once. It's a favorite of our picky grandson.

This recipe was really filling.  Our family really enjoyed this soup, even my 4 year old son.  The only alteration I made was by adding 2 tbsp of ketchup to give it a little more flavour. It reminded me of an Italian wedding soup.  I think that next time I may throw in some orzo pasta instead of the barley.  This is definately a recipe that I will continue to put into our meal rotation.

My family loved it with the exception of my 2 youngest who are 2 and 4 but they are picky. My husband usually goes and adds things or seasonings during cooking but he didn't and he thought it was great. It is funny because most of them do not like spinach but they loved it in this. I am not a big sausage person but I enjoyed it too. Thanks for such an easy dinner that almost all of the liked! ;) Krissa

I made this to the T with Venison Italian sausage.  Turned out really well for me.  I added a little more carrot since my carrot was a little on the small side.  It didn't say to thaw the frozen spinach, so I just tossed it in.  It began to break apart as it cooked, so no problem there.  I love slow cooker meals. DINNER IS DONE! Thanks for great recipe!

Fantastic!  I used 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups beef broth, 1# hot Italian sausage, 1 can tomatoes with chili, mushrooms and carrots. I started with 1/2 cup barley, then added another 1/2 cup. After 4 hours in the slow cooker it was wonderful. Very thick. Probably too thick for most people who really want soup. The taste is hearty, flavorful but not heavy.   Thank you for the great recipe!

YUM!  After reading several reviews I made a few minor changes.  I used 3 carrots, hot Italian sausage, 1 diced large tomato, upped barley to 1/3 C, doubled Italian seasoning, added about 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, ground black pepper, and salt, and a bay leaf.  Any time a soup depends on sausage for so much of its flavor you're somewhat at the mercy of how flavorful/well-seasoned the sausage was to start with so I can't blame the recipe for any of my changes and YMMV!

I add extra barley and leave out the spinach ( I don't like the texture of it in the soup)  I also add a can of diced tomatoes.  This freezes well.

Simply outstanding!   The only ingredient I missed was spinach - simply because we didn’t have any and I didn’t want to run to the story.  Lazy me.  This was everything I hoped it would be and then some! Next time for sure I’ll buy the spinach :)

Great flavor!  We added many more carrots, a bit more seasoning and fresh cilantro cut up. Used fresh, finely chopped spinach rather than frozen and it was delish.

I doubled the barley and tripled the carrots. Yum! Easy! After 3 hours on high in my slow cooker, I had to stop cooking it on high because it was splattering out from under the lid.  I left it on warm for the last hour and the barley and carrot were plenty cooked.

This got a very quick "make this again" from the family. 
I did make some changes based on other reviewers. 
I used 16 oz of Italian Sweet Sausage, 6 small carrots, 3 celery stalks, onion, fresh mushrooms and 5 oz fresh spinach, 48 oz beef broth and 1/2 cup barley. I added everything to the crockpot and cooked on low for 6 hours.  I added the spinach 10 minutes before we ate. It is a thin soup and I think I could have added more veggies and barley.

Great flavor!  I took the recommendation of others and added a can of diced tomatoes.  I also used beef broth rather than chicken.  This makes a hearty soup that’s perfect for cold weather.

This was a delicious soup!  Very flavorful!  My husband thought it was “excellent” and didn’t even complain about the cooked carrots which he usually refuses to eat.  Lol!  After reading other reviews, I used spicy sausage as well. I also switched out the frozen spinach with 10 ounces fresh spinach (added at the end).  Besides those two changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely be making this soup again!

Husband and kids loved it. Used 64oz of stock as suggested, and fresh spinach, which wasn’t slimy at all. Also used baby carrots instead of sliced carrot because I had it on hand. Didn’t add barley until the last half hour. Will definitely make again.

I doubled everything except the broth (64 oz) and the carrots (6 medium).  I didn’t have a second pound of Italian sausage so used 12 oz of Andouille sausage and added it to the slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients.  It made a hearty soup that we had with crusty rolls.  We both loved it!

I wound up making this on the stove instead of in a slow cooker.  After accidentally cooking out most of the liquid :( I added some additional water.  It still turned out great.  I found it too salty so the added water (about 1.5 cups) really helped out.  It's a nice fall recipe with delicious flavors.

I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was to add fresh herbs (basil, rosemary, sage) in afdition to the  dryed Italian seasonings called for.  It was soooooo good.  Even my celiac daughter can eat this when made with gf chicken broth and withholding the pearl barley.

I had to substitute due to lack of ingredients. This was an excellent starter and the modifications didn't hamper the end result one iota. For a cold damp day, this works very well and can be altered to meet anyone's taste buds if they know how to cook.

This was a very good soup and quick and easy to make!  I adjusted it a bit for my taste...which spiced it up a bit.  I used spicy pork sausage (you could use spicy turkey sausage as well). I added more carrots, a can of spiced and diced tomatoes, fresh garlic, cilantro, a chopped jalapeño (without the seeds), additional onion and a few drops of liquid smoke.  And I added quite a bit more barley to make it hardier. It turned out fantastic and I’ll make it again!

Excellent soup and gets better the next day.  I did not add the spinach but did add some green beans I had frozen instead.  Just a personal preference.  Sprinkled a little cheese on before serving. Will defiantly make again. I also added more carrots and barley to make it a thicker soup.  Perhaps 3/4 cup.  I measured out 1/2 cup and then sprinkled in a little more.  Came out nice and thick just as my husband likes soup.

This soup was so simple yet so delicious! My son couldn't get enough of it. I accidentally used both chicken and beef broth (instead of all chicken as the recipe calls for) and it was perfect. The only thing I might change is the amount of barley. I would have liked a bit more. I would also like to try adding some different veggies like zucchini, mushrooms and substitute escape or kale for the spinach.

It way "okay," but my family didn't really love it.  After adding more seasoning, salt pepper, cayenne, and cajun, it was more palatable.  I probably won't make this one again.

I used roasted basil chicken sausage and really upped the spices, using Curry Vindaloo (thanks William Sonoma) and it really is great. Maybe I just like a lot of flavor, but it really was a bit too mild to love. I also left out the spinach, after reading about the slime issue. so I added in about a pint, a bit more, of my homemade canned, roma tomatoes, which made this taste great. But a good bones type of recipe!

Very good, but i did make  a few changes. I added a can of stewed tomatoes and used 2 large containers of chicken broth. I only used 1/2 bag of fresh spinach.  Definetly a keeper.

Made as written, and have to agree with Karinok - swimming in spinach and unpleasant slimy texture.  Inedible.

This is a hearty soup/stew ( I like mine  thick). Made a double recipe but only added 1 1/2 x the chicken broth.  Served with salad and crusty bread...big family hit!

This soup was so easy to make, and wonderful for a rainy day.  I lessened the amount of spinach cause of some reviews I read.  I added mushrooms and black-eyed peas cause I had it.  Next time I'll add more barley.  I felt it could have used more.  Great texture. Will definitely make it again.  Hubby loved it too!

I didn't have a carrot handy so left that out. I used fresh instead of frozen spinach (about 8 oz.)  I also had a bit less broth than called for so I added a cup of water. 

I used hot Italian turkey sausage because my husband cannot eat red meat. After transferring the sausage mixture to my slow cooker, I deglazed the pan with some of the broth and added that to the cooker. 

I used the 1/4 cup of barley called for, but I think I'll increase to 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup next time.

Soup is delicious--very flavorful. A keeper.

Made this recipe and the whole family loved it!  Hearty and delicious!  The only thing I changed is that I removed the casing from the sausage, as I preferred the meat minced rather than sliced.

Delicious! Made in the slow cooker, prepped the night before and had it the next day. Will definitely make again. I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen and 1 quart and 2 cans - 14oz each of broth.

Use fresh spinach and coarsely chop.
I used a bit more seasoning.  1 tsp each of oregano, basil and 2 Tbs of dried parsley. 
Does get better the longer it sits.

Very good!  A bit  salty, but that may have been from the Italian sausage, or that I used only 1/2 of the spinach. I did add more barley, and chopped fresh garden tomato that needed to be used. I will definitely be making again, being cognizant of any additional salt. Perfect for a cold Wisconsin winter's night!

I don't like to cook so always look for the easy ones....this was good.  The only thing I think I might change is a little less spinach....other than that it was yummy.!   I even froze some for later when I don't have time to cook!   I should also adds that I sliced some small carrots that I had that worked perfectly.  I also added a can of fire roasted tomatoes....I think this was suggested by another maker of the soup!  I think one could add a variety of things, beans, other veggies, etc.  It's a good starter recipe.......

I used jalapeño turkey sausage. (for my hubby) Instead of one large carrot, I cut several petite carrots in half.  Since I used turkey sausage I used 320z vegetable broth and a 16 oz chicken broth. I used fresh spinach and added the last hour of cooking. I made in the crock pot and loved how the flavors blended!  It had a kick to it! I will be making it again!

Made multiple changes, all of necessity: no barley, so used faro. Fine. No stock, used beef bouillon cubes. Added black beans corn and a can of tomato basil soup.  Result probably nothing like the original, but really delicious.

No changes, except used only three sausages as that's what I had on hand.  My son and daughter-in-law loved it.  Soooo good.  Used Hillshire brand sweet Italian sausage.  Also used fresh spinach which I added toward the end of cooking cycle as spinach does not need extensive cooking.     Going to store today for more sausage.

As others suggested I used three carrots, 1/2cup barley, a bit extra Italian Seasoning, 6 cups of broth and a small can of diced tomatoes. Easy and yummy.

This was an easy recipe and delicious and healthy.  The hardest thing about this was finding the barley in the grocery store.

This is my first review ever.  Great recipe but I made many changes. After reading other reviews, I doubled the barley to half cup,  used a whole package of  hot Italian sausage links cut in 3/4 inch pieces (20 oz total), used a whole onion, 1 TBS Italian seasoning, 2 bay leaves,  at least 1-2 tsp salt, 1 small dried hot whole chile pepper ,  1 can stewed tomatoes drained, 2 large carrots,  1 bunch fresh spinach and 1 TBS  minced garlic, 8 hours on low in the slow cooker. I will make this again , but cook for 6 hours on low, and add more barley and some celery if on hand.

My family, including two teenage boys, devoured this soup.  I did not use the crockpot!  Just follow the steps and let simmer an hour or less.  I will reduce spinach by a quarter. Next time. Additionally, I used 10 minute farro from Trader Joe’s to speed cooking time.

This soup was so incredibly easy for a quick Monday night dinner. Some changes 1) I added a batch of sliced mushrooms 2) added 1/2 cup of barley instead of 1/4 cup 3) added 1/2 cup of Locatelli romaine grated cheese for a nice nutty flavor. Served with extra crispy garlic bread! 8 year old loved it, 7 month old loved it (I blended it) and so did my husband! It was a hit!

I am not a crock pot fan so I cooked on top of stove. I used fresh kale, half cup of fresh mushrooms, 3 carrots, heaping quarter cup of barley and added a tbs of beef  better than bouillon  to the broth. Simmered it for an hour before we tore into it. I am sure it will taste even better second heating. Just add some more bouillon and water if too thick.  Don’t add salt.
Yum!

I read the other reviews and adapted it as follows: added 3Tbs garlic, a can of diced tomatoes, and 1 1/2 c barley. My broth was a bit weak and so I added some chicken bullion, and salt and pepper. It was more like a stew, if you want it to be a soup don't add so much barley. But we like it thick. Made enough for dinner for 2, three times. So left overs went in the freezer.

Delicious!  Made a batch for our Sunday football-watching dinner.  Doubled the barley but otherwise followed the recipe.  Would add more carrots and reduce the spinach by half.   Served with shredded mozzarella.

Definitely a keeper! Essentially, I followed directions but used extra onions, garlic, carrots and barley. The  first couple of taste didn't grab me but after 3-4 spoons of this soup I was hooked. Based on other reviews I added spinach at the end, turned up to high and cooked just long enough to heat through and for it to come to a slow boil.

This soup is perfect for a cold day!  It's hearty and full of flavor and it's easy to make.  We added a healthy pinch of crushed  red pepper flakes, but hot Italian sausage would be good to.  It's a keeper!

Made this and used beef broth and 1/2 cup of barley. I also added some winter BN squash and fresh mushrooms during the last hour. This is a hardy and  tasty soup. Thanks

definitely will make this again, could be a nice time saver using canned and frozen too-and delicious.  couple of things I did -- I always cook my barley separately and in chicken broth. Add the barley after the soup is done.  I used 2lbs of sausage and I made sure to DRAIN every drop of grease.. and rested it on paper towel as well. I used stock instead of broth and added crushed tomatoes - I used Kale, stronger flavor than spinach.  I used fresh carrots and onion, added parsley, more garlic, more italian seasoning and pepper for a bit of a stronger taste.. this is a really versatile soup and I love it when so long as I have the base, sausage and Kale (spinach).. I can add what I have on hand and... YUM.. Next time in place of barley.. Im gonna try white beans :) double Yum

This turned out awesome! I followed some advice from other reviewers and doubled the barley (increased the broth to 8 cups), used half a bag of baby carrots sliced (not sure what that equates to in "real" carrots), double the Italian seasoning and added a little salt since I'd upped the barley, and diced 2 stalks of celery since it sounded yummy. I used smoked sausage since that's what I had and added a dash of crushed red pepper. Cooked it in the slow cooker on high for 4 hours and it was delicious! Full of good things and tasty too! Definite winner!

This is our new favourite soup. I use a local honey garlic sausage and followed suggestions to put in more barley and carrots. We like to make the soup quite thick, almost like a stew. I make it over the stovetop and substitute fresh kale for the spinach, which I put in 5 minutes before serving.  The key to this soup (and any soup in my opinion) is using a homemade chicken stock instead of canned broth. My husband always gets a stock going right after a roast chicken dinner and then I make the soup. Perfect combination!

I am rating it as it was written.  I added more meat (because I was using up what I had) more garlic, some red pepper flakes and 1/2 C more barley and 2 C more broth.   Also added 1 can diced tomatoes.  It was delicious, but I felt the additions made it more of a 5 star vs 4 star, but might just be personal opinion.  I used a food  processor for the garlic, onion and carrot, so it was pretty fine.  I can tell that the original would make more than 4 servings.  Mine filled a large crock pot 3/4th full.  Hope this helps.

My family loves this soup, even my daughter who is super picky! She looked at it and didn't want to try it but after she finally took a bite she loved it and asked for seconds. I made a few adjustments the second time making it as their was not enough barley. I added 3/4 cup barley and substituted the spinach for a bag of mixed veggies (green beans, carrots, and corn). To me it turned out better, the first time i made it it was swimming in spinach which wasn't bad, I just preferred the mixed veggies.

This was pretty good. Since the recipe didn't call for salt and pepper  I added a little salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. (I think the amount used depends on the type of sausage you use - I used mild, but next time will use a combo of mild and hot) I did add more garlic, Italian seasoning, and carrots than called for. I also used 1 carton of chicken broth along with 2 cans of broth with roasted garlic, and added 1/3 cup of barley.  I didn't want to dirty extra pots, so instead of cooking it in the crock pot, I used  a soup pot and simmered it on low on the stove.  Served with crusty bread, this was a tasty meal that my husband I enjoyed very much.

Next time I make this I'm making more because it is so good. While the barley makes it seem best for cold weather, the spinach enables an easy transition for a well balanced year round soup.   Didn't change a thing.

I used homemade smoked chicken stock, spicy sausage and fresh rather than frozen spinach and added fresh mushrooms.  Made it on stovetop, rather than crockpot.  It was very good, actually ate it 4 days in a row, which is unusual for me.  Will absolutely make again!

Amazing! I think I could make and eat everyday. Thank You for recipe!
Due to ingredient malfunctions I did a few things differently. 
1/2 cup barley 
1 whole diced onion, Italian sausage and some stewing beef
1 tsp of garlic powder, then 2 cloves garlic
1 can diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning
2 small Yukon gold potatoes cubed
1 cup baby carrots, diced

Browned meet, sautéed onions and garlic, cooked on high 4 hours, added the carrots at 2 hour mark. 

Friends had thirds! I had left overs for breakfast, and yes....it was even Better the next day. Soup has kick, you just need to get the right hot sausage. 

As a rule of thumb I try to follow recipes as originally described and then read about 5 comments to see commonalities. 

Super easy to make and Possibly the best soup I have ever made!

As per other reviewers, I made some modifications to the soup. I added more carrots and increased the seasonings and garlic. I had some corn going to waste in the refrigerator, so I added corn from two ears. I also made this during  a snowstorm...so when I didn't find barley to add, I added red lentils instead. 
I didn't give it a 5/5 because it is a bit greasy. I even tried soaking up some of the grease before adding in the cooked sausage. 
Overall, a delicious soup. I'm happy I made it. Great for the cold winter.

This tastes so much more amazing than I imagined. I didn't use slow cooker because I don't like spinach cooked for  a long time.  It gets slimy. Other reviewers mentioned this as well.  I just cooked it on the stove top until the barley was done. About 40 minutes. I didn't add carrots.  Totally unnecessary. For a kick I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper.

This soup is great, I've made it many times and my family loves it. I tend to add lots of all different types of veggies depending on what I have on hand. The major change that I have made is to substitute chopped kale greens for the spinach.  They hold up nicely and don't get slimy at all.

If you put in as much spinach as it calls for it will be A LOT of spinach. I put just a small amount and it was plenty. Also added more carrot. Otherwise, a good soup that I will make again.

This was a welcoming change from our regular weekly crockpot. I tripled the carrots, garlic and seasoning, only added a 40 oz broth, added fresh spinach before serving, and probably quadrupled the barley. I've never used it before and now I am wondering why! It made an amazingly hearty and creamy stew without all the fat. I don't feel it was untrue to the original recipe either, I'm just not a big broth soup fan.

I had organic lentils, and barley but didn't have chicken or sausage. I omitted both and used 2 2" slices of bacon and cooked it with the onion.

I tried this using hot Italian sausage and Kale instead of spinach. I used more barley and more carrots.  It is a hit at home.
I made it on top of the stove in my big pot.

I loved how this soup turned out. Did I make changes per other reviews? Yes. I think that regardless of those changes, it is a great recipe to make your own. I added a can of diced tomatoes, mushrooms, 1 tsp red pepper flakes, extra Italian seasoning, 1/2 cup of barley, more carrots, and 2 cans of water. Will be making this again.

This is a delicious and versatile soup. I added three carrots and used 1/3 cup of barley as suggested by other reviewers. I had a leek so I put that in as well, used vegetable broth as that is what I had and cooked it on the stovetop for 30 minutes. I added fresh spinach just before serving. It tasted even better the following day.

This soup turned out to be so tasty! My new favorite slow cooker recipe.

Thanks to the other reviewers, I made some changes: I used 3 carrots and 3/4 cup of barley (maybe more). I added the frozen spinach about an hour and a half before it was done cooking so it wouldn't get too mushy. I also added red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper to spice it up, and it had such a nice hot flavor! I will probably use hot sausage next time I make this.

Thanks for the recipe!

very good, made in the crockpot on low for 6-8 hours, used 3 carrots and 1/3 c barley, added a bag of fresh spinach the last hour or so.  Could consider adding a small can of diced tomatoes to this as well, and would probably be great with hot sausage.

Made as above again and yummy, I still think the hot sausage is a great idea, and maybe the tomatoes too

One word - yum. I am not a huge fan of sausage, so I wasn't sure if I would like this soup, but I have to say that I absolutely loved it! Perfect balance and blend of flavors. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great cold weather soup.  Just a few modifications, mostly at the suggestion of others.  I doubled the Italian spice, doubled the garlic, added one can of chopped stewed tomatoes, one beef bouillon cube, and one can of drained northern beans.  The beans are a must!  It's a keeper for sure.

This was a good soup recipe. I had to use canned spinach instead of frozen because I didn't have any. The canned is never the same. I think if I make this again I will add more substance to this soup. There was too much broth for me and I like a hearty soup.

Flavor is not bad - I followed the recipe exactly (but not in the slow cooker) and was going to add spinach at the very end, but it turned out i was out, so had to add frozen green beans.  Soup is still delicious :)

Fabulous Soup - Can't wait to have it again.  I used ground hot italian sausage, skipped the carrot, added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms, extra barley and about 1/4 cup red wine.  Sprinkled parmeson cheese  in bowl before serving.   Also, cooked it on the stove.  Better the second day.  Delicious!

Great recipe...like others advised I added more barley..used 1/3 cup..next time think I'll use 1/2 cup..I added a little more 'hot stuff' a pitch or two of ground cayenne red pepper..I also cooked it day a head of time and let it chill so I  could remove the sausage grease from the top..when I was ready to reheat, I heated on the stove and added the spinach..a great success..my guy couldn't stop talking about how much he enjoyed it..thank for a great meal,,

My 16 month old ate 3 bowls of this!  He couldn't get enough of it. Needless to say, this was delish.  I substituted chilimac for the barley and omitted the spinach.

I love this soup - it is very tasty.  I only made a few changes when I made it - I used 1/2 c. of barley, 3 carrots, and vegetable stock.  I thought using stock gave it a little more flavor than just using broth.

this was easy and good. i didnt have spinach but i had cabbage and mushrooms to use up so i used those instead. it ended up being a cross between a mushroom barley/sausage cabbage soup. i added a dollop of sour cream on some of the leftovers and it was good that way too. was yummy w/ some homemade bread

My favorite soup ever! I've made this several times and have adjusted it to my particular tastes by adding an extra carrot (or 2), extra chicken broth, adding a tablespoon of crushed red pepper, and substituting ground turkey. Healthy, hearty, and delicious. And makes great leftovers!

This soup is awesome.  We made it just as directed and even my picky 6 year old loved it.  Next time we will add more barley, and for my taste I would add red pepper flakes, though i doubt the kids would like that!

My husband and I LOVE this soup, especially on a cold snowy day with homemade crusty bread.  Thanks for sharing it!  I usually add more carrots, but change nothing else.

I followed the suggestions of others and increased the amount of carrots and barley.  I also added diced turnip and some celery along with the onion but I did not use the spinach. The soup was very hearty and nice on a cold winter day.  I will definitely make it again.

We all loved it except for our 12 year old. I had used some ground sausage from a friend and added pepper flakes, thyme and sage to it. Then used beef broth that I had leftover from cooking beef. Which also had thyme in it. I also used half the spinach it called for. Then did all the rest of the recipe as it was written. My 12 year old thought it to spicy. However, everyone else had seconds and thirds! We served it with homemade bread. Awesome!

Great flavored soup! I followed the recipe using turkey italian sausage plus I added 1/4 c. uncooked lentils. I used the stovetop and my soup was ready to eat in under two hours.

Wonderful soup, very much like Campbell's Italian wedding soup.  I used low sodium chicken broth and added the spinach during the last 20 minutes, and it was perfect.

The flavor on this recipe was very good. The only change I would make in the future would be too add more liquid, which is not usually the case with slow cooker recipes. I thought 1 can was not enough, but was hoping more liquid would come from the spinach. Next time I'll add another cup or so at least of chicken broth.

This was interesting, but no one in my family cared for it much (and my family is not picky!). The frozen spinach seemed to give it a rather strange taste... if I try it again, I might try fresh spinach, or cabbage.

This soup was easy and delicious. I made mine on a stove because I don't have a slow cooker and the flavors were still amazing. I also added a large fresh tomato and low-fat turkey italian sausage. I will definitely make it again.

Loved this thick soup. Used Jimmy Dean zesty tube sausage and doubled the carrot. Added 1/2 tsp salt and did in the slow cooker. Wonderful!

I made this with chicken sausage with basil and pine nuts from Trader Joes, already precooked, so just sliced and browned in the same pan as onions after they cooked.  Cooked in crockput for 4 hours but barley seems a little overdone, will do in less time next time.  Because it is absolutely delicious!

This was a very good soup, I cooked it on the stove top. We enjoy spice so I doubled the italian spice,garlic and added some tobasco to give it a kick. This was my first time cooking barley and I was surprised how such a little amount makes so much when fully cooked. This is a great fall/winter soup even though it was 96 degrees in California today.

Very good soup, excellent flavor.  I would recommend draining the sausage before putting it in the crockpot so the soups is less oily.  Will make again.

This soup was excellent with plenty of flavor.  The only thing I changed was that I added 2 potatoes cut into small chunks.  That really gave it what I was looking for.
