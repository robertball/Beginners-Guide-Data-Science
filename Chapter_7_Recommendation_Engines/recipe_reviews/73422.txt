I thought it was MUCH better as a cold dish. I de-seeded the cucumber and tomato. This is a very, very light tasting dish, so much so that I used 1 cup of dressing versus the 1/4 cup stated. Next time I will use tomato flavored feta as well.

I live in Greece and made it for Greek people, and they loved it.  You definately need to make it and chill it.  Stir in the dressing before serving.  I used my homemade feta, olives, and olive oil to make my own dressing, which makes it so good!!!

This was very good, thank you.  I was looking for a warm recipe with cucumbers and pasta in it.  I didn't have feta and used parmesan as another reviewer suggested.  I also used canned organic tomatoes since I didn't have fresh.

I ate this hot and then ate the left overs cold and I liked the cold MUCH better. Still good hot, but I think eating it cold as a pasta salad made a big difference.  I can't get used to the idea of warm cucumbers for some reason.

I used Greek salad dressing instead of Italian because it sounded better with the Greek flavors in the salad. I definitely preferred this as a cold side dish. Great in the summer.

This is a refreshing substitute to classic pasta with marinara. I am pleasantly surprised with this recipe. It's light, fresh, super easy, quick, and full of flavor. Plus, it gets better as leftovers. What more can you ask for?
To boost its health benefits, I used Ronzoni's Smart Taste pasta (I have recently found this and am in love...lots of fiber and calcium without the toughness of wheat pasta). I also used reduced-fat feta and italian dressing (I used a little bit more than 1/4 c.). Next time I might try fresh herbs, but it is great as is.

Definitely better as a cold pasta salad than it is warm.

My husband and I love pasta salads, and this one was terrific.  Because of dietary concerns, I substitute fat-free zesty Italian dressing and added onion and black olives.  Very Yummy.

This is a great recipe, easy to whip up and room for customization. I replaced the italian dressing for Italian Ranch. Tasted delicious.

It's pasta salad. Been making this for years and just changing up the cheese - sometimes mozzarella, sometimes provolone, sometimes Parmesan, sometimes feta, etc. I also add a little minced red onion or finely sliced green onion. Start with this recipe and add what you like - sliced olives, finely diced pepperoni, toasted pine nuts, etc. 

It's really not all that good when it's warm. It tastes best at room temperature. You can adjust the amount of dressing to taste. In fact, dress the pasta warm then taste it after it cools. You might find it needs more dressing.

I made this tonight as a quick meal after a busy day, and it was delicious! It was so light, but filling. Didn't take long at all, and inexpensive. Will definitely be making again!

The first time I made this I followed the instructions exactly. I really did not care for it. If you are serving this as a main dish, then maybe this could be 8 servings. If you are serving it as a side dish, it is more like 16 servings. Also, the ratio of pasta to other ingredients is off, in my opinion. The first time I ate this, the pasta was overwhelming. I could hardly taste any of the other ingredients, and I did not care for the Italian dressing. Maybe I needed to use better Italian dressing?? (I used Kraft's Italian dressing.) The second time I made this, I doubled the tomato and cucumber, added some kalmata olives, and used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing (approx 1 1/2 cups) from this site instead of bottled Italian dressing. I served this chilled as a side dish at a cook-out. I enjoyed it much more the second time with these adjustments.  I would give this 5 stars with changes; however, rating the recipe as submitted, I can only give 3 stars.

I made this for my daughter's school lunch and my husband who works outside and does not have access to a microwave.  Really nice alternative to a cold sandwich.  We all liked it.  The only thing I may change next time is to use less pasta or use more dressing.  I only used a 12 oz box of bow tie's but left all other ingredients the same.  But I thought that the pasta was still a bit dry.  However, this may be because we did not eat it right away and it absorbed some of the dressing.

This pasta recipe is wonderful.  It's so easy to make and very tasty.  I've received many, many compliments from friends/family when I've served it.   It's also easy to take on a picnic or other  "bring a dish" type get together. Try this one you will really enjoy!

This was nice because I had everything on hand. I think next time I would add a few more ingredients though - olives or mushrooms or even just more tomato and cucumber. I liked the Italian dressing and feta was just the right touch. I'll make it again.
