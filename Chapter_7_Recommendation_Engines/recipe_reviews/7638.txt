This frosting is AWESOME. It is rich and creamy and very tasty. I might suggest that people had problems with it being runny etc. because they did not beat it long enough in the mixer. Mine was creamy and fluffy and I beat it on high for at least 3 mins. (I also used whipping/heavy cream instead of milk.) Try this! Excellent on dark chocolate cake.

Smooth and velvety frosting, made extra rich and creamy from the egg yolk and lengthy mixing time. My only caution is that if you need a pure white frosting this may not be to your liking--in that case egg whites could easily be substituted with an equally good result.

This is to DIE for--It really does taste like bakery cake frosting. I ate it right out of the bowl and some didn't even make it to the cake! :)

This is a thick creamy frosting. I beat mine on high for 3 min to make it a bit fluffier. For a rich chocolate version of this frosting I  substituted 1/4 cup of sugar for cocoa powder. It turned out great!

Good tasting very much like the bakeres. I just don't like the two raw egg yolks in it.

This frosting was the absolute best I have ever used.  I make and decorate a lot of birthday cakes and the consistency was perfect for the types of designs I make.  Loved the taste too!

This was a very good recipe. I frosted a white cake with it and everyone loved the frosting.  I tinted it green for St. Patrick's Day.  I was wondering though if the frosting needed to be refrigerated since it had the egg yolks in it.

This was so good! Really creamy, and lots of flavor. I used it on plain white cupcakes, and they were delicious. I could have eaten it by the spoon!

Very good frosting, my only issue is that the yolks make it a yellowish color when finished, not a pretty white like a real butter cream.  The taste and texture are wonderful however.  I might try whites next time or a whole egg instead of yolks to see if the color is lighter.

This could be my current fav buttercream frosting...I'm not positive because they all kind of taste the same, but I do really like this one. I followed the recipe to a "T" w/half and the other half I subbed almond extract for vanilla extract.  Great consistency & flavor (though, the egg thing did/does kind of throw me for a loop)...TY for a great recipe!

It was good. I didn't have to add milk. It didn't frost that well, the icing slid off.

You can use pasturized eggs, found in most grocery stores, which are completely safe to consume raw. Just thought I would mention that alternative. :)

This frosting was awesome. Some of the most delicious frosting I've ever made. 

For me, I thought that 4 cups of the confectioners sugar seemed to make the icing a little dry. I used about 3 cups, and also added in an extra teaspoon of milk. 

I warmed all of the milk before adding it, because it seemed to help as well, and make it easier to mix in.

For an extra twist for the cupcakes I was making, I tinted the icing green with just four drops of neon green food dye, and I also added in 1.5 teaspoons of peppermint extract. 

The result was the best icing I've ever tasted. Much better than the store-bought type!

I managed to beat the eggs into the frosting smoothly and then add in the milk that restored a whiter colour, so that the icing didn't turn yellowish, and ended up off-white, which is definitely better than yellow frosting! Another things is to make sure that you beat the frosting well, so that it turns out light and fluffy. To me it seemed that the consistency was a little off, and after about 2 minutes of beating, it was perfect consistency.

i was extremely dissapointed with this recipe. I am a frequent baker and have tried many recipes, but none that have ever called for 4 cups of sugar. That was just absolutely ridiculous. And, I felt that even though I had used confectioners sugar, I still had sugar crystals in the frosting that I could literally bite down on. I added some heavy cream to the recipe because it pretty much tasted like only sugar without it. I also found that the frosting was running down the cake and wasn't thick enough. Ew. All in all, I did not like this recipe at all and I will definately not be trying it again.

I just made this frosting and I'm very disappointed.  It tastes just like a plain old powdered sugar frosting that my grandmother used to make for graham crackers.  What is the use of the egg yolks when all you need is powdered sugar and milk to get the same result.  I'll never make it again.

I think this is an excellent recipe for frosting- it has a great consistency, and great taste. I used two egg whites and vanilla sugar to keep it whiter. If it was too thin, I just added more powdered sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this to frost Old Fashioned Kentucky Nut Cake from this site.  The cake wasn't that great, but the frosting was. This frosting is delicious.  It is so easy to make.  Make sure the butter is soft.  I micowaved mine for less than 10 seconds and it was perfect.  I makes more than enough frosting for a 9x13 cake.

The egg yolks really made it creamy but the 4 cups of icing sugar made it WAY too sweet. I baked a cake for a function at work and not even half of the people ate the icing... and I don't blame them!

I whipped up the butter and salt only to realize that I only had 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar (that other bag was shredded coconut. . .yikes!).  I didn't make any other adjustments other than not adding the milk and the recipe worked out just fine!

I doubled the recipe and needed 3 more cups of sugar, so I ended up using 2 cups brown sugar and 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder. It was great! C: I'm definitely using it again.

THE BEST!!! I have been testing several butter cream frosting over the past several days, was reluctant to try this because of the raw eggs, but caved out of desperation. So glad I did!! The taste and texture is amazing!!! I made another batch for a detailed character drawing in which I added almond extract and much more milk - again, wonderful. You will NOT be disappointed with this frosting - I promise!

This was a hit. The only suggestion I have would be to taste it before you add the 4th cup of sugar, it gets pretty sweet. It's weird some people say it was runny. I mixed mine by hand with a freakin fork and it was still creamy and deliscious...I hope they only used the egg yolk and not the whole egg. Also, make the butter room tempreature when you measure and use it- do not melt it completely in a microwave!

excellent recipe.  I did take the advice of other raters and took my time mixing and preparing the frosting.  I let my cupcakes cool while I made this.  Perfect amount of time too.  I subbed the milk with butter milk, and needed to add a bit more milk because of it but still very good.

Oh My!!!!  I  just made this frosting and it's unbelievable.  I did double it and whipped it like theres no tomorrow.  So fluffy.  I also kept adding the Icing Sugar .  It was perfect.  I iced a Zucchini Chocolate Cake.  Tinted the Frosting Rose colored.  It was a hit.
Thanks again

I don't know how or why you'd need to improve on this frosting. I slathered it on a home made chocolate cake this morning and WOW... so good!

This frosting was so good! I don't like frosting, but this was perfect. For me, though, it was a little sticky/dry, so I added just a tad bit more milk which not only toned down the sweetness a little, because it tasted way too much like pure sugar, but it made it less sticky and easier to spread. I totally recommend this frosting, it was excellent, and everyone, whether or not they like frosting, enjoyed it.

Very good, I used it for my parents 32nd wedding annivarsary cake. But I wished I would have refrigerated the cake leftovers-it went bad in about 2 day. (I imagine from the eggs)

Yumm. I could not stop eating the cupcakes with this frosting. I did add just a tiny splash of orange extract to the mix. It adds just a bit of brightness and depth without an "orangey" taste.

Four cups of sugar was toooo much. I ended up creaming the rest of my butter afterward (about 1.5 cups) and mixing in about 2/3 a cup of the original icing I made. (I then proceeded to throw the rest away...) It tasted much better but needs to be refrigerated or else it gets a bit too soft.

still not what i was looking for. it was a little sweet, and turned out heavy, even after adding additional milk.  I beat it in the KA for a good 10 min and still didn't fluff up.

So I've made this twice now. The first time I accidently used something that wasn't all butter and it came out real runny but that was my fault. This time I used real unsalted butter and whipping cream instead of milk cuz its what I had and it turned out fabulous! its not white, so if you're looking for a real white buttercream this isn't it. But its perfect for coloring we dyed it purple and it was great. Thanks for the easy & delicious recipe!

Simple recipe that yields a WONDERFUL frosting.  I received multiple compliments with this on a standard yellow cake.  Highly recommended.  I did add a bit more vanilla than called for in the ingredients - provided a little more flavor.

It's ok.  As others stated it was not that thick even after beating it on high speed with the mixer.  It is also VERY sweet. Even more so than bakery icing.  I was expecting a creamier not as sweet icing.  I won't be making this again.

This recipe was easy enough for my Husband to make it and it turned out really well! It's a pretty sweet frosting so it worked well with the not-so-sweet cake that it was put on. We had adjusted the flavoring to 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extracts so as to coincide with the flavor of the cake that was made. This frosting and the 'Heavenly White Cake' (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Heavenly-White-Cake/Detail.aspx Submitted by Carol) were a hit at my birthday!

This frosting is simply fantastic. It's thick, creamy, and has a rich flavor that isn't too sweet. It was the perfect choice to top chocolate cream filled cupcakes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/26018/cream-filled-cupcakes/), and all 36 of them were gone in 2 days. 

If your frosting is too thin, use your mixer and continue to beat the frosting until it has the thickness you desire, which will probably take at least 3 minutes.

This was the direction that I wanted to go. Like grandmothers. But FOUR cups of sugar? I ran out with two and that was too many. As Laura said, I literally bit down on powdered sugar. I'll keep it in the recipe box but do 3x the vanilla, 1/2 to one cup of sugar and go from there. Maybe some sour cream or cream cheese. New to baking but loving it!

Wow this is pretty good!

I started making it and then went to grab the milk....it had started to sour and I didn't have any fresh stuff on hand. I decided to use it anyways. It doesn't appear to have made a difference, it's still very yummy!

I used my Kitchen Aid Mixer and mixed it for quite a while until the consistency was just right.  At the beginning I was quite concerned as it was quite dry/crumbly with just the butter/sugar mixture. Adding the vanilla, milk and egg softened it up just the right amount!

This recipe was fantastic.  I used heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  I varied the amount by added a 1/4 tsp of whipping cream more than the recipe called for milk.  Really spread nicely on a frozen layer of ganache poured over my yellow cake.  I'm sure there won't be any left after my co-workers get there hands on it.  Happy Birthday Mr. Greene!!

Definitely an awesome recipe.  I substituted half and half for the milk, made it a little thicker, since it was a bit runny for me.  For those worried about the "raw egg" thing, there's nothing wrong with raw eggs.... any bacteria would be on the outside of the shell, not the inside.  If you're worried about it, just wash the egg before hand, and you'll be fine.

I give this a 1 for the taste, it was pretty good.  However, it was a mess.  I was making it to frost my husband's homemade ice cream cake.  After mixing for 10 minutes, I figured it wasn't going to get hard.  I added 2 additional cups of sugar and 3 tablespoons of flour.  It still was not hard enough to frost.  I figured that since the cake had been in the freezer for 2 days, maybe it will stay on when I get it back in the freezer,I came back 10 minutes later and it was all over my freezer.  However you look at this, it was a diaster!!!Never again will I make this.

I made half of these recipe as a "test" for my son's birthday next week.  It was good.  The next time around,  I will defintely not use all the sugar it calls for maybe instead of 4 cups something like 2 1/2 or 3.

oh my God! amazing!  but i did have to mend things a little bit.  i used only 2 cups of sugar since i cannot stand it being too sweet. i know... i'm weird.  and even with 2 cups it was too stiff so i had to add 1/4 cup of heavy cream.  but the results was AMAZING!

This recipe was very easy. It frosts wonderfully well. I tinted it and piped it onto cupcakes. I added a 1 1/2 tsp of almond and it was delicious. I may cut back on the sugar amount just a little bit next time because it was a tad sweet for my taste but everyone else loved it. Will definetly use again! Thanks!

Just made this. It IS the closest to store bought I have made but not quite.. and it's taking a bit of mixing to firm up(maybe I'm impatient). Other than that the flavor is really tasty! It could maybe use more vanilla but I do like how the flavor faintly tastes sweet instead of flavor punching me in the face like some other frostings. I'm keeping this one ^.^

This is a good frosting, although it doesn't taste like buttercream frosting from a bakery.  The eggs made it a bit more rich than the standard powdered sugar/vanilla/butter/milk frosting that my mom has always made and it was certainly very sweet.  Spread nicely and set well too.

OMG!!  This turned out delicious.  I made a batch of regular and another of chocolate taking the advice of another user and adding some cocoa.  The texture wasn't spot on but I was in a hurry and didn't take time to measure or fool with it too much.  My new go-to!!

it is so delicious and easy to make.  It came out fluffy and perfect, although I did use one whole egg instead of two egg whites.  It was not at all runny, if you mix it on med-high speed in a stand mixer it will come out whipped perfectly

I needed a fast frosting for a birthday cake.  I found this and boy am I glad!  It's so easy and I had everything on hand.  I didn't have the full 4 cups of confectioners sugar, but that is a good thing.  I used 2 cups and that was enough.  The butter really came through.  I also used cream instead of milk, since I had some on hand and also because someone recommended it.  I didnt find this runny at all!!  I won't be buying store bought frosting ever again .

Turned out very well. I was skeptical about the u cooked egg yolks but since no one fell over I guess they are ok in the recipe. I would definitely make again.

I never knew an icing  could be dense AND fluffy at the same time! The flavor it great, too! My only complaint is the same for all buttercreams - they just don't hold up well in high heat or humidity. (Better than marshmallow or whipped cream, though, to be fair)
I used this for a cake for my parents anniversary. Paired it with a white cake and fresh berries. I took a small portion of the icing and blended it with a small handful of the berries to make a flavored filling to go between the layers. Turned out beautifuly!

This is probably the bets frosting that I have ever had!  Love this one.  Will be my go to frosting recipe.  I think it needs to be doubled in order to actually frost a cake or a good amount of cupcakes.  I found Pasteurized eggs at Sprouts.

It's an okay buttercream.  I'm not a huge fan anyway.  It does spread well for use as a base under fondant (my preferred use).  Does set up nice and firm in the fridge for some great presentations and takes an egg wash well for that extra shine.

Excellent fronsting. Smooth and creamy, just as frosting should be. I used one whole egg, beat very well before adding in and a little half & half rather than milk, although milk would do just fine. The trick with this frosting as with any buttercream is be very careful adding the liquids, and don't try mixing by hand. Use an electric mixer for the right consistency and spreadability. Oh, I also added a touch of coffee flavor. Three heaping teaspoons instant to one tablespoon hot water, and let it cool in the fridge before using. With this frosting you can use just about any flavoring you want, just remember to decrease your milk.

I followed the directions just as is, being very careful because I didn't want to mess it up and was really hoping for the best. Unfortunatley, I was very disappointed. Did not taste like butter cream at all! I will continue looking for a good butter cream frosting recipe.

This is AMAZING.  I actually halved the recipe.  I used buttermilk instead of regular and added slightly more powdered sugar and twice as much vanilla.  WOW is all I can say.

this was very good!!!  I forgot to refridgerate the cake afterwards and had to throw it out, since it has raw eggs.  The cake was a hit!  I think a lot had to do with the frosting!

This frosting was thick, velvety, and delicious. The recipe made enough to frost a 9" double layer cake with a little leftover. Will certainly use this recipe again.

This frosting is fantastic! I was pleased with the texture and thickness I achieved. I was 1C short on powdered sugar, but 3 c was plenty. Its very sweet. I did use 1 whole egg vs the 2 yolks. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for a great frosting recipe!

This was a pretty solid buttercream recipe. I only used 3 cups of sugar and more milk than it called for. I also added lemon zest for a little extra flavor. I frosted an angel food cake recipe (heavenly angel food cake) I found here and it was delicious.

I was looking for an easy frosting for a chocolate pound cake (mainly because I wanted to use ingredients I had on hand). I must say, not only was it simple to make, but it was absolutely delicious. I did not have the 4 cups of confectioners sugar that it called for but it was great just the same.

This buttercream icing tasted great! It was very easy to make and it was delicious. I had no problem with it being runny. Maybe it's runny if you melt the butter instead of making it creamy.

Wonderful and easy.  My family loved it on our Valentine's day cupcake.  I added red food coloring to make them pink :)  The taste wasn't too rich either.  It was a soft, sweetness that brought out the flavor of my chocolate cupcakes.

I liked it. It was pretty good. I was a little leary about using the raw eggs but i was convinced after reading the reviews. I used it in a strawberry cake and this is the first time in a long time that i enjoyed the frostiong more than the cake.

Perfect! Came out really fluffy with an awesome taste first time making frosting from scratch, and I will definitely use this recipe again!
*note* Used whole egg no just whites, still had great taste.

I loved this frosting! I used heavy cream instead of the milk and beat one whole egg before adding to the mix. I was sure to beat the mixture for abt 3 minutes as LESLEYCAN suggested. I frosted cupcakes with this an my husband 
loved them.

This is the perfect recipe to use when decorating cakes with stars! It was perfect for the dora cake i made, though i probably ate more icing then what went on the cake:)
