This is more like preserves.  If you want jam, I would suggest using commercial pectin, instead of the apples. The flavor was exceptional. Very good recipe.

This recipe has an excellent flavor.  One thing I found was that 24 kiwis makes more than 3 cups of mashed berries. Mine made about 5 cups.  Also - I had to cook longer than 30 minutes.

what did i do wrong?? i am an experienced jam and jelly maker using commercial pectin.  this recipe would not gel!  i ended up using commercial pectin and adding more sugar which affected the taste.  i researched and found that once apples (or any high pectin fruit) ripen they don't have the high concentrate of pectin.  USE SLIGHTLY UNDERRIPE APPLES!!!!! ended up not tasting good and feedback from tasters was don't waste my time.

This jam is great! When you peel the kiwis it is easer to cut them in half and spoon out the inside.

I would call this recipe "Kiwi Syrup" rather than "Kiwi Jam" because it wouldn't thicken properly, but it tasted soooo good on pancakes and waffles that I couldn't possibly give it a bad review!  I think it might be the fact that the apples were too ripe and juicy, or they were too big.  I'm going to make this recipe again!

This has a wonderful taste. As for the fact that it's "runny", most homemade jams (that is, "natural" jams not using commercial pectin)are always runny. This affect has no bearing on the taste however.

This came out great.  My classroom of kindergartners loved it.  They thought it looked like frog eggs.

What a way to use up all of your well-intentioned kiwi purchases! I scaled it down to five fruits and it made about 1 1/2 cups of deliciousness. Here's the thing, though - I didn't like the taste of apple infringing on my kiwi. I took them out and just kept the jam in the fridge. Awe-inspiring with ricotta on croissants, crepes, muffins, cardboard, anything really!

very easy to make for a first time jam maker and it really taste good! very yummy! Instead of following the instructions I put all the kiwi fruit, apple plus one small piece of fresh pineapple (cos I don't have pineapple juice on hand) into a blender and blended them with the lemon juice before putting them into my bread machine. After one hour its done! taste very good! thanks for sharing and will definitely do it again.

Surprised myself with how great this jam tastes! If you can get past the not-so-typical color of this jam, it's a real treat!
I didn't have under-ripe apples for this recipe (used for the natural pectin) so I used the light certo pectin instead.

My jam came out perfect.  It was firm and held it's shape when I scooped it out of the jar and I didn't change anything except the temp and how long you cook it. Oh and be sure you use a really firm or tart apple like a Granny Smith, which has more natural pectin. The recipe says to lower heat and "simmer"... don't do this!  Heat it to a roiling boil and let it cook at that high temperature, stirring frequently until done... It was delicious!

First time making jam so I only used 1/4 of the measurements.  I found I had to cook it for almost an hour to get the apple more to a sauce consistency. This amount made 1 small jar of delicious jam. My husband said it was the best jam he's ever had and I have to agree.  I will definately make this again using the full measurements and it was so easy! Thank you!

This recipe is great if you interpret it correctly.  For every 3 cups of mashed kiwi you need to add 4 cups of sugar, 1/2 lemon, 3/4 pineapple juice and 3 apples ( I used nine apples for the whole batch, 2 lemons and just one serving of pinapple juice because I was worried it would be runny( but- it's a bit thick) .  Mine made 8 cups of kiwi (so that is how I calculated the recipe). I got three quart jars of jam.  It set up very nice, just like the picture.

My kids loved making this and the really love the sweet and tangy taste.  I must admit that you have let it boil and stir for a long time but it's worth it.

Delicious! 13 kiwis made just about 3 cups mashed. Added a little pineapple to make up the difference. Used an immersion blender before ladling into jars to blend the apple peels. Not too sweet, just right! I certainly hope to make this one again.

I made kiwi jam and sent my dad who lives in the south a jar.  He called and said, honey, this looks like frogs eggs in pond scum.  Now, that's the name of my kiwi jam!  Love it!  MP in Chico.

Good!  Both my 6 yrd and hubby loved it.  I did add a little green food coloring to make it look more appealing.
