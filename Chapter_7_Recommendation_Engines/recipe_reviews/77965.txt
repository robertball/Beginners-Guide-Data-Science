This recipe was fantastic. The brining technique made it the juiciest turkey I have EVER eaten.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't have the ancho peper, and I used dried herbs rather than fresh,but this was sooo good.  my husband and friends loved it and I'm pretty sure it will be my holiday recipe from now on.  thanks!

This is the only recipe I will ever use again for turkey! It was the most succulent turkey our family has ever had and now I'm the official turkey baker!

Absolutely the best!  I soaked it in a garbage bag in a bucket overnight, added the herbs and rub, and got rave reviews.  People who don't like turkey because it's too dry like this turkey!  I made it for Thanksgiving and am looking forward to making it again for Christmas.

Delicious turkey!  I have made turkey with a more complicated brine - this was simple, delicious and easy.  Next time I may try the citrus brine just to compare - 5 stars for both ease and taste...always brine - it's the way to ensure juciness!

I wanted to try a new recipe this thanksgiving and gave this one a try.  It was the best!  I always cook in a reynolds oven bag and did this one in a bag as well. (so I followed the oven bag directions for baking).  I was nervous about brining... but it was very tender and juicy.  I was REALLY nervous about all of the spices I was to rub on the turkey... very heavy on the cumin... but it worked well and was delicious! I'm doing my turkey like this again next year too!

Great recipe, and it made a very flavourful gravy...I added a bit of rosemary and oregano to it.
