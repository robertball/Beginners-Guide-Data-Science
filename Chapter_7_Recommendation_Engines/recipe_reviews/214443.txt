This was very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly except I did not add any cheese. It made a lot so we had leftovers but my family loved it!

Cooked this the other night for the first time. It was absoluetly delicious! The only two things I did different was used regular smoked sausage and used a 'Chipotle' salsa. Just fantastic recipe and full of flavor! Very filling too! Will keep this in rotation....

Very yummy and super easy to make. Even better on the second night as leftovers.  I didn't add the bell pepper, but it didn't matter.

I am sooo mad that I forgot the zucchini.. that was one of the reasons why I made this recipe was to use one up, but I totally spaced it when I was preparing this. Still good even without the zucchini, but would be even better with it. I liked this and it was fast and easy to prepare. I didn't have the bag of frozen corn with green and red peppers and onion, but that's easily fixed with a diced onion, half a diced green pepper( and red pepper if you have it on hand, I didn't so I left it out) and half a bag of frozen corn. You could also use a can of mexi-corn. I sauteed the onion and green pepper before adding the chicken sausage and then following the rest of the recipe. I bought the chicken sauasge when they were on sale not knowing what I was going to do with it. I am so glad I found this recipe! Chicken sausage is good.
