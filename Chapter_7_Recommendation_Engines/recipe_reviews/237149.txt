I thought ahead before I made this smoothie. I did not have fresh pineapple but I did have one large can of pineapple chunks. What I did was drain the can of pineapple chunks and froze half of it the night before I made this. I did not need the ice. The kids thought this was great! They asked me to make this again tomorrow.

Yum, this did taste like a pineapple creamsicle! I used all of the ingredients but changed up the amounts due to what I had and what I knew would work best. I got about 3 servings. I used 1 large frozen sliced banana, 1 1" thick slice of fresh pineapple I had in the freezer. I just cut it in half for easier blending. 1 6oz container of Greek non fat vanilla yogurt (Kroger brand), 3/4 cup of homestyle orange juice, and 8 ice cubes. Will definitely make this again. TY

This was absolutely delicious!  Definitely my new smoothie go-to recipe.  This is also great with some fresh kale and ground flax for an added nutritional boost.

I used about 1 cup fresh pineapple, plain Greek yogurt (had both on hand and needed to be used) and probably a bit more OJ just to get the consistency I wanted. Also added a few scoops of vanilla protein powder; my banana was frozen so skipped the ice. No flavor seemed to dominate using the amounts that I did and not overly sweet...just the way I like smoothies! Thanks jenateare, nice recipe!

I was expecting an overbearing pineapple drink and was pleasantly surprised.  We've tried this with mango juice in lieu of the orange juice and it's just as good.  I add spinach which doesn't change the flavor.  My picky twin 4-year-olds love this smoothie too so now we have 2 smoothie recipes they will drink!  Thanks for sharing.

Mmmm-Mmmmm! I used half can of pineapple chunks and only 8 cubes. We have some lactose issues in our house so I used lactose free yogurt. Great smoothie! Thank you jenateare for sharing.

Yummy! As soon as I read this recipe I ran to the kitchen to make it! I did not have fresh pineapple but I had the canned kind...I used that with the juice in it, and frozen bananas (I added extra banana) and used Greek vanilla yogurt...and of course OJ. It was very good, I didn't need the ice because the banana's were frozen!

My husband is a big pineapple lover , so I knew he would love this smoothie. As soon as he took the first sip I knew he loved it. I put a little bit more pineapple than the recipe called for and it still tasted wonderful! Great recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe suggested and it was absolutely delicious!  It was a perfect complement to our bacon, eggs and hash browns and both of my children loved it.  I can hardly wait for a hot summer day to enjoy this refreshing drink.

I used frozen pineapples and bananas and pineapple orange juice. Didn’t use any ice and added a teaspoon of honey and the consistency was perfect and it tasted wonderful. It wasn’t to sweet . It was just right.

The pineapple flavor dominates, didn't get much of a creamsicle flavor, but still liked it.

Came out perfectly! Not too sweet, either! The only thing I changed was the amount of ice cubes. Instead of adding 32, I only added 16.

Absolutely delicious!!! I’ve made it 4 days in a row! I use a can of drained pineapple in its own juice. I also use lite orange juice. I add a bit of Splenda. I could live off of this smoothie!!! Side note: I’m not even a banana person...but love it in this smoothie!

I did not have any orange juice so I used a fresh orange, frozen pineapple, frozen bananna and some vanilla protein powder. My husband and I both enjoyed it.
