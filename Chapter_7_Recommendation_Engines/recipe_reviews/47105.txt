I wish I could give more than five stars.  These were the best ribs I have ever tasted.  They were slightly sweet and had excellent flavor all the way through.  I used a honey lager beer in my marinade and the taste did come through so I would recommend you use a good quality beer.  Also, this is not the rib recipe for you if you don't like the taste of beer.

I received so many compliments on these ribs! I boiled the ribs at home and then left them soaking in the marinade. Then place them on the grill and basted to add flavor.  GREAT recipe! You do not need that much beer. I used only 2 bottles. It makes enough bbq sauce for you to keep and use later.

We made this recipe last night.  We like the idea of soaking them in Beer and spices overnight, then into a low heat oven.  We think the sauce tasted wonderful, but it just didn't thicken up...so, we added a some flour when cooking the sauce to help it get to the right consistency...all in all this was a tasty recipe!

These were very tasty, but a little on the tough side. They actually marinated for over 36 hours. I halved the recipe, but only used a total of 3 cans of beer instead of six. I marinated the ribs in a Ziploc freezer bag with two cans of beer and used one in the sauce. It was very runny at first, even after cooking for the prescribed time. I put the rest of the sauce in a foil-wrapped pan on my grill and allowed it to thicken up as the ribs cooked. By the time the ribs were finished, the sauce was nice and thick. This sauce has a wonderful barbecue flavor.
