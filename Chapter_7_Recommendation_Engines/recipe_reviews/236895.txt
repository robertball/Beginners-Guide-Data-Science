This was surprisingly good, outstanding as a matter of fact. How can you go wrong with avocados? Avocados need garlic salt so I used garlic salt to taste in place of the garlic powder and the celery is a must for that added crunch. I did add a bit of fresh lemon juice to keep the avocado from oxidizing. As for that stinky hard-boiled egg smell try making "Hard-Steamed Eggs" from this site and you won't have that problem. Thank you Nadia for sharing this great recipe.

I added fresh squeezed lemon,  a few drops of red hot sauce and spread a bit of brown mustard on a toasted pita and topped with sliced pickles.  This added some tangy delight.

I made something very similar before finding this recipe. I used mayo & spit cream instead of yogurt. Also added some yellow bell pepper & scallions. I recommend a shot of hot sauce & a little citrus. Also sprinkled with paprika to add some contrasting color & a little richness.
