This recipe is an old favorite that I am so happy to have found again.  It is comfort food for those who enjoy the mild taste of white fish but prefer the health benefits of salmon.  I love the creamy texture.  My only change is an additional tablespoon of flour to create a thicker sauce.  I also use the sharpest cheddar available.  Thanks for publishing this.

I made this recipe for the 1st time today.  I made it for my husband and my in-laws.  We all loved it!  It's very simple and tasty!  
The only change I made was I added more cheese to the top.

We really liked this, but I made some changes.  I doubled the sauce but used less ketchup and added a little mustard and hot sauce.  I also added sauteed onions to the mashed potatoes and used 3 cups of flakes.  The last change was to add about a cup and a half of peas on top of the salmon layer.  It turned out really well this way and I'll make it again!

One star is generous.  There is no flavor, it is a bad blend of mush.  Nice try, but it needs some flavor and texture.  I'm going to try to fry up the leftovers in a pan like potato pancakes.

I had leftover salmon and mashed potatoes, so followed another suggestion and used what I had. Other than needing some pepper & maybe a little salt, I liked it. I will fix it again.

I followed the directions exactly, except I used leftover baked salmon and homemade mashed potatoes. It was delicious! My kids even ate it! The only thing I might changed next time is to use a bit less cheese and mix it into the mashed potatoes on the top of the casserole.

I made some changes based on other reviews. I added a layer of caramelized onions, and added some more cheese. I also put french's fried onions on top.  This was a pretty good meal, but it still felt like it was missing something. Maybe more crunch? Next time I'll try adding a veggie like peas or broccoli.

This was o k.  The canned salmon, itself, was kind of gross.  It looked really nasty straight from the can and didn't taste too good in the casserole.  The expiration date isn't until 2011, so who knows how long that fish had been dead.  Next time I will definitely use FRESH salmon!!!  I also made the mistake of doubling the cheese because I am a big cheese lover, but one cup is definitely enough!!  Next time I think I will also try it with broccoli scattered on top to add a little more flavor variety.

After reading many of the reviews of this recipe, I made a couple of changes that increased its rating from a 3 to a 5...  First, I used the Herbed Garlic Mashed Potato recipe from this website as a base(I reduced the amount of thyme from 1 T in that recipe to 1 tsp, which was a wonderful change since no seasoning overpowered another).  Secondly, I used salmon filets instead of canned salmon (...simply because I prefer the taste of fresh or frozen filets over canned).  Thirdly, I added 1 tsp of Old Bay seasoning to the salmon mixture and cooked it for about 15 minutes in the saucepan over medium heat.  Not only did the extra time thicken the mixture, but the flavor was excellent! At that point, it could have been served alone, honestly.  My family absolutely loved it and gobbled it up!!!! My girls are 2 and 3 years old, and my husband grew up land-locked, so adding seafood to our regular rotation of meals is a treat for me!! :)

It would have been bland BUT I made it with my special french onion dip mash potatoes. I use half a tub of french onion dip in my potatoes to make them super creamy. Also, in the sauce I added garlic, onion powder, and a little curry powder. I didn't use cheddar, I used Monterey jack & cheddar mix like in the picture. It was good for a rainy day lunch. Nothing special.

After reading some of the reviews, i was not sure whether to try this one or not, but went ahead and made it, with some modifications: I used boiled potatoes, mashed them up n added some cumin powder, coriander powder and some salt. I doubled the sauce and added some hot sauce (half tablespoon). Since we dont like peas and I didn't have broccoli at home, I just added a layer of canned sweet corn over the salmon layer. Turned out fantastic! I added some black pepper over my portion and hubby had some hot sauce on the side. We'll definitely be having this again, easy and tasted great.

Definitely not my favorite and my husband agreed. It wasn't terrible, but it needed something. The flavor was just ok, but possibly adding something with more texture would be good. Not sure I will even attempt to do this one again with tweaks since it was such a flop in my house!
