Wonderful!!  I cut down on the fat by reducing the butter to 1 Tbl, and using fat-free half-and-half instead of heavy whipping cream.  Didn't affect the taste at all!  Note that 10 carrots is the same as 4 cups whole baby carrots (chop before adding).  I also used 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper - would do that again.  Be sure and puree the soup after cooking, or carrots will be chunky.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is surprisingly good! I am not even that fond of carrots. The one thing I highly recommend is making it into a puree. I tried it both ways and it is far better if you whip it all up in the blender. Plus it's a beautiful orange color!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used the ingredients that I had on hand, which means that I used reduced sodium chicken broth (and I would again) and half and half instead of whipping cream.  I also didn't have any marjoram or dill weed, but didn't miss it at all.  I also pureed the soup prior to adding the corn starch and half and half.  I would definitely make this again!

Wow! I can't get enough of this soup! The subtle blend of flavors is perfect. It's a great accompaniment to quiches, sandwiches, or hearty salads. I use vegetable broth instead of chicken, and half & half instead of cream. Yum!

I made this soup because I had tons of carrots and needed a way to use them up fast. I had never had carrot soup before. I was very suprised that everyone loved it..including two picky toddlers!  I prepared the ingredients just as written then I smoothed it out with an emulsion blender and added some crumbled crisp-cooked bacon on the top.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

A thick, rich, creamy DELICIOUS soup.
We really enjoyed it for dinner last night.   And I have been making soup for 2 years now every Wednesday and this is one of the best I've made.
One thing tho ---use a food processor to slice the carrots --I did mine by hand & it took forever to do.

I LOVE carrot soup but have never made it myself.Come to think of it I don't make many soups myself but this intrigued me because of the dill.The 1st time I ever had carrot soup it had dill & that set the pace for my love of it.This was a good recipe but I used fresh dill & found I really had to put a lot in to get the flavor that I like.Due to previous reviews I choose not to cut the carrots up but to grate them & after trying the "finished" product decided to puree 2/3rd of it. This way it was smoother but still left a bit of the "chunkiness".

Although this soup smelled fanstatic and looked beautiful, my husband and I were underwhelmed by its flavor.  I used rather large "pinches" of the seasonings, but the soup still tasted rather bland.  If I had ordered it in a restaurant, I wouldn't have been disappointed, but neither would I have been eager to order it again.  If you like subtly flavored food then definitely give this recipe a try, but if you prefer more robust flavors (as I do) you may want to give this recipe a miss.

Absolutely loved it! Used 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups vegetable broth, added a pinch of cayenne and a dash of nutmeg. Pureed the cooked carrots with a little stock and cream, then added back to the pot. Didn't even need the corn starch!

I thought this soup was very tasty with just a  few minor enhancements to the seasonings.  After tasting the finished soup I added a tablespoon of curry powder, celery salt, lots of white pepper and sea salt.  After pureeing in the blender I was hoping not to have to use the cornstarch, but as written this was too thin for that.  Next time I think I'll cut down a bit on the broth, and/or up the carrots for a thicker soup and skip the starch.  A wonderful, fresh, springtime soup!  I bought a huge bag of carrots for $2, so it's very economical, too!  Thanks for sharing this with AR!

What a great flavor profile.  I didn't have all the dried herbs on hand so I used dried Italian herb mix and forgot to add the cornstarch.  I guess I had simmered the soup for so long that it didn't need cornstarch at all.  I highly recommend using butter instead of margarine because it adds more richness.  I pureed the soup like everyone said.  So good, and it ended up being my boyfriend's favorite dish for dinner.

I'm not a huge carrot fan but this soup was pretty good. I made it exactly as written and didn't really like the look of it or the big chunks of carrots so I pureed the rest of it in the blender and I preferred it that way.

Very soothing comfort food ... I didn't have any dill weed, but the soup still tasted great. Definitely should be puréed, though.

This was the easiest soup I've ever made. I pureed the whole mix when it was done for a creamy texture and used half n half instead of heavy whipping cream. I especially like it because it's guiltless so I can eat quite a bit of it. I think next time I may put in some cilantro or chipotle for a little extra seasoning.

Agree with others that soup lacked flavor due to meager use of spices although others found it just right for their picky eaters, including toddlers. Adding your favorite spices or multi-blend seasoning is a very simple fix to tailor the taste to your preference. Other than seasoning, the only other change was to use a high-speed blender to puree 1/2 of the soup into a creamy texture, and the other 1/2 quickly pulsed a few times to leave it with flecks and small pieces. With the adjustments, this would get a 5* rating; w/o adjustments, a 3* rating. Next time this is made, may adopt a change or two noted by reviewers that might improve the end result (e.g., reduce chicken stock to 4-5 cups & replace heavy cream w/ whole milk or coconut milk).

Great carrot soup. Good way to use up the extra large carrots from my garden. I added a pinch of ginger powder as well for added flavor. Also pureed it. Would definitely make again.

We all loved this soup!  I don't normally care for carrots, but this will deffinately get me to eat them.  I had a three and five year old I cooked for and they loved it, the three yr can't get enough.  I'd like it pureed better, but my husband liked it better as is.   To make it healthier, I used EVOO instead of the margarine and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.  Personally, I might add more onion next time, but I love onions.  I love soups and will be cooking this many times, might make it a traditional thanksgiving appetizer (and keep the leftovers myself.)

I've made this a few times, and my tongue is watering thinking about it!  It tastes a lot like butternut squash soup. I pureed the carrots and onions after they were cooked. I made it again with a boxed white wine flavored chicken stock and it turned out great too. I prefer it to be a little thicker, and more like carrots instead of chicken, so I reduced the amount of stock to 4 cups (one box). It was about the consistency of runny mashed potatoes. I ate the whole pot myself in a day.  FABULOUS!

If you like cooked carrots, you will enjoy the flavor of this soup. I did as others suggested and pureed most of the carrots.  Because of this it was so thick I did not have to use any cornstarch. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and only 1 TBSP margarine to make it less fattening. I'll eat the entire recipe, too, because my husband loves raw carrots, but he doen't like them cooked!

This is an excellent soup! I didn't look at the reviews before I made this, so therefore did not puree my soup. I really, really loved it just the way as written...the only change I made was to use evaporated milk instead of heavy cream, because I didn't have any. I think this could very easily be made with fat-free evaporated milk and be very rich and creamy with very minimal fat. I only made a half batch because I wasn't sure if my family would care for it...they loved it! Everyone ate it up in one sitting, and some people didn't even get as much as they wanted. This recipe is a real winner, and I will be making it often!!! Thanks for sharing!

This soup is dynamite! Everyone loved it! And my family is totally picky, yet, I was very surprised when I looked and found all those empty bowls :-)! It is soooo good, yet healthy and totally kid-friendly and guilt-free!!!! Yet, it tastes more like a butternut squash soup than a carrot soup. I just found this flawless! Absolutely divine! I will definitely make this for the whole family again and again and again. A nonstop crowd-pleaser! Highly recommend!!!!!! A+++++++++++

Yum! We really liked this. I had a ton of carrots I needed to use and this was perfect. All of my kids loved it as well! I did use cayenne pepper instead of black pepper and left out the salt. Also cut the broth down to 5 cups. This was a delicious, easy, healthy and economical meal. I topped it with a little bit of sour cream. Thanks!

A very solid recipe.  Pureeing is definitely reccomended as it makes a nice smooth and attractive soup.  Two notes:  Using standard canned broth it comes off a bit too salty and chickeny; so I'd recommend diluting the broth 2:1 which should take care of both.  Also, per a NYTimes article, boiling carrots results in a higher nutrient content than steamed.

I would've rated this a 3, but my husband loved it, so I am giving it a 4. This soup is obviously supposed to be pureed, but I think the person submitting it forgot to put that in the recipe.....in the picture it is pureed, and I cannot imagine it otherwise. I also used veggie broth and real butter, which added a nice flavor. I added extra dill and a few drops of tobasco, but I still found it a bit boring and bland.

I prepared this by using baby carrots that I had halved lengthwise.  I sauteed them with the onion and seasonings along with a pinch of brown sugar to add some caramelization before I added the chicken broth.  Also a few drops of hot pepper sauce to kick the flavor up a bit.  Then I pureed with my immersion blender and swirled in some sour cream before serving.

I loved this recipe!  I found that one lb. of carrots is just about the right amount.  I only used thyme because I love the taste of thyme and carrots.

I loved this soup.  Changed a couple things.  Used half the amount of butter.  Added one celery stalk to the onions.  Also, pureed it all which was definitely the way to go.  Added 3 tbps. of half & half and a little extra dill.  I'll be making this again for sure.

Like other users, I skipped some of the seasonings, just used thyme and parsley, s $ p. Also, I omitted 1 C of the broth, and at the end just added one can of evaporated milk.  I skipped the cornstarch all together.  Great with crusty bread on a rainy day!

This was good and I would probably make it again. I shredded the carrots in a food processor first and once cooked smashed them with a potato smasher to break up the carrot pieces more.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 and also 1/2 veg broth and 1/2 chicken broth.  I think next time I'll add some chx to it! Yumm

I made this soup for a luncheon.  I added some chopped fresh tomatoes and that added a nice tang to the already delicious soup!  We all felt nourished by this soup.

This is a great soup.  Very tasty and very easy to make.  Next time I will try pureeing the soup because my husbands only complaint was too many carrots chuncks and he would like to try it pureed.

So I doctored this up and it turned out amazing. I added a diced jalapeño to the butter/garlic/onion mixture. Then I took advice from other reviews and added celery salt, cayenne, and nutmeg. I also chopped up fresh cilantro, dill and ginger. It definitely takes a good while for the carrots to soften, but then used a hand blender to mix. I also added heavy whipping cream at the end.  This was yummy!

After reading the reviews I basically doubled the amount of herbs and spices. I had no cream in the house so I substitiuted greek yogurt and milk.  I also like chunks in my soup so i removed some of the cooked carrots before blending so I have a creamy chunky soup.

Very good, except recipe seems to be missing step 3 .. puree the veg/broth. I doubled the dill and added 1 celry stick since I didn't have parsley.

Great stuff if you up the spices! The measurements listed just aren't enough unless you like the barest hint of flavor, in my opinion. I made half a recipe and probably ended up using about 1 teaspoon each. So I would say for full recipe use 2 teaspoons each, or you can start at 1 tsp and taste it and adjust to taste. Great combination of flavors, it just needs more of them! ;)  Definitely blend it in the blender for a smooth consistency! I found that since I left the lid off while boiling the carrots that I didn't need cornstarch to make it thick.

This soup is fantastic and full of flavour. I followed other reviews blending most of the soup and it turned out perfect. It's a great way to get the soup creamy and thick and you honestly do not need the cream or cornstarch at all if you do this. Fantastic recipe.

I didn't have parsley or marjoram.  I used chicken stock, dill, thyme, chili pepper flakes and fresh grated ginger. When it finished cooking I blended it and added the cream.
It was awesome!  This will be a nice soup addition this winter!  Next time I'd like to use coconut milk instead of cream to see how that would taste!  Yummy!

Very good soup!  Never had it before and what a wonderful surprise this was.  I only had 4 cups of stock but it was perfect for us.  Also added a stalk of celery to the onions and the taste is wonderful.  Increased the spices by a few more pinches but that was to our taste.  Really good and will definitely make again.  I also omitted the cream altogether and used 3T of butter.

I had a whole load of carrots that i needed to use up and decided to give this recipe a try. It was absolutely delicious. I had no Dill or Marjoram and only had fresh parsley, I also added a sweet potato and used butter instead of margarine (prefer a natural product over a manmade chemical!). Once I pureed it there was no need to add the cornstarch. Served with fresh bread this was a delight.

I added a sprinkle of ginger and ground mustard to this recipe which gave it a great kick! It's a little bit spicy which is exactly what my husband likes. I used only 2 tbsp of butter and omitted the dill weed and marjoram since I didn't have any on hand.  Great recipe, I will definitely make this again.
