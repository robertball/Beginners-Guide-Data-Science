I served this to 15 people and everybody loved it. I used butternut squash ( couldn't find buttercup). I used Jonagold apples and reduced the white sugar to 1/8 cup. I also reduced the brown sugar in the topping to 1/3 cup. I cooked and mashed the squash the day before so it was very quick to prepare. Thanks for a great dish!

Absolutely awesome!  The whole family loved it!  Squash is hard to peel (this was my 1st time) & the only way I found to make it any easier was to have my husband cut it into small pieces and then I peeled them.  I put it together the night before, but didn't cook it until about an hour before the event.  It came out awesome!!

Yummy! I made this for Thanksgiving and had a request to make it for Christmas too. Liked by everybody. At Thanksgiving, I made it with buttercup squash (looks like a smal green & orange pumpkin), but it was VERY difficult to peel even after microwaving for 5min. Probably the easiest way to use the buttercup squash would be to cut in half, scoop out seeds, bake for about an hour at 350 degrees, then scoop out the squash and then prepare as the recipe says. For Christmas, I used butternut squash and it was much easier to prepare and just as delicious. I used a mix of apples including macintosh and cut them up into small wedges (not sliced or diced). For topping I used Special K with cinnamon and pecans for the cereal. Lastly, I put everything in the crockpot instead of baking and kept on low until ready to eat.

This recipe was wonderful as it stands.  The only thing different I did was use Butternut squash instead of Buttercup only because it was what I had bought.  I served it for Thanksgiving Dinner and everyone had two helpings, some had three!!

Wonderful!!  Even my kids ate it.  Next time I will dice the apples instead of slicing.  And will mix in. Some spoonfuls did not get down to the apples on the bottom.

This is wonderful!  Of the 8 dishes served to 12 people, this won the prize!  I used butternut squash and followed the recipe with no changes.  Unbelievably good!

I just ran across the recipe again and wanted to review it :) I made it last year for Thanksgiving, it was so good, everyone loved it! I added dried cranberries in with my apple mixture, only because I like the tart taste. Very good, give it a try!

Wow this is amazing! I was a little skeptical but the other reviews convinced me to try it. I used butternut squash, gala apples and instead of butter I used the best life spread made with olive oil.   The only thing I had to change was the topping because my family is not a big fan of any type of nut. I was also out of cornflake cereal so I had to improvise. I used 1 cup of rice crispies, 1/2 cup brown sugar (but could have probably used less) and 2 tbsp melted butter. I mixed it all together and sprinkled it on top, delicious!   My EXTREMELY picky 2 year old even likes it, thank you for such a wonderful recipe! I will probably make a big batch for Thanksgiving too :)

Awesome!  I made this for a holiday potluck recently and it was a BIG hit.  At least 5 people asked me for the recipe and it was one of the only dishes to go home completely clean.  I did, however, make a few minor additions to the recipe.  1)  Added 1 teaspoon of fresh minced ginger to the squash mash along with a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice.  2)  Added a generous sprinkling (maybe 1/4 tsp) salt to the cornflake/butter/sugar crunch topping.  Delicious!  This just moved into definite go-to holiday side dish.  Fantastic!  Thanks!

This is so easy and delicious! I adjusted the amount of topping to fit the pan I used for baking. Also, I accidentally used the wrong type of squash (butternut). But wow it was tasty. Will definitely make for a holiday dish or possibly to use up squash in the future. Also, if I had more squash I would have layered it - some apples, squash, topping, apples, squash, topping. Mmm good.

Took this for thanksgiving and most of it was still left afterward.  Make sure that you completely puree the squash, I used my food processor and it was still not pureed enough. It had a very odd texture that was hard to get over.  I would also cut the squash amount down to 2lbs as the flavor was almost overpowering.

Had buttercup squash in my CSA box and since I'd been inundated with squash, I wanted to try something other than baking/roasting or making a quick bread.  Took this to Thanksgiving dinner and boy, did it go fast!  Everyone LOVED it.  I ended up using buttercup and acorn squash in this and I diced the apples rather than sliced, but otherwise followed the recipe.  So good!  Passed the recipe on to everyone there!  Thank you so much for sharing.  This is a keeper!

I made this last night as a "rehearsal" for Thanksgiving. My husband and I loved it!! I did add about two tablespoons more of the brown sugar and I cubed the apples. It was easy to make and tasted wonderful.

This is a great side dish. The only thing I will do next time is to cut the apple pieces into smaller pieces. I sliced the apples pretty thin, but the slices were just big enough to make serving awkward.

Delicious!  I used butternut squash that was already cubed to make it easier on myself and I cut the recipe in half to serve four people.  It was wonderful-could have been a dessert!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit...even with the kids!  I also used butternut squash as I have never heard of buttercup.  Next time, I'm going to try using frozen butternut squash in order to save some prep time.
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Made this over the Christmas holidays and it was definitely a favorite among squash lovers.  Next time, though I'd cut the apples into smaller pieces.  The topping was delicious.

My brother-in-law who will eat no vegetables, actually asked for seconds on this one.  It was truly more like a dessert than a vegetable side-dish.  It was really spectacular.

Awesome!  Hand-sliced apples were a little too thick, so next time I will use the mandoline to get thin slices, then cut them in half.  Family LOVED it, and it will be added to the holiday recipe list.

I read a lot of reviews saying that even if you don't like squash you'll like it in this recipe. Well, I found that not to be true. I found the squash to be overpowering. I would make this again but i'd add more apples to even out the squash. The cornflake, pecan topping is amazing.

I used butternut squash, cubed apples and squash and simmered together in a deep skillet until tender, then drained and added butter and used brown sugar instead of white as I was out of white sugar, and brought back to a boil. I did not purée squash due to limited time. I then placed mixture in baking dish.  For topping, I didn't have corn flakes on hand so I used Post Great Grains with raisins, dates and pecans and blended with softened butter and brown sugar. Wonderful! I will make this at Thanksgiving!

I love this recipe but alter in the following ways: carmelize the apples by cooking over high heat uncovered, then top casserole with apples followed by bran flake crumble (I use flakes out of Raisin Bran cereal and cut brown sugar to 1/4 cup)

So I love to bake, and in the interest of using the buttercup squash I've had with no idea what to do with it, I seen this recipe and thought I'd try it. Like others, I've made a couple alterations myself. I seeded and quartered the squash and baked it in the oven on 350 for about 30 minutes, just till it was soft enough to peel off the skin. Then I cut it in chunks, thru it in my blender (don't have a processor) and added 4 tbls butter, brown sugar and roughly 3 tbls vanilla, pureed it until thick and creamy, poured over apples in the pan (used granny smith's) and used cinnamon toast crunch cereal and blended that into crumbs, poured it over the squash puree, baked and topped it with whip cream. Shared with the neighbors and they brought back an empty pan and asked for the recipe. Good idea to use a squash!

Very good! My family was a bit uncertain when they heard it had squash in it, but the dish was almost empty when dinner was over! The only things I did different was I used honey nut cherrios in place of cornflakes because that was what I had, and I didn't use the pecans because I didn't have any, but next time I will!

I made this for a church potluck, but didn't do the apples, because it was a last minute decision and I didn't have any.  Everyone loved it, and I got lots of requests for the recipe.  I'd make it again for sure.  maybe next time I'll actually think ahead and buy apples!

LOVED this recipe!  Served it at our Canadian Thanksgiving celebration and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe to a T, including the boiled squash.  Worked like a charm!

Awesome, could be used in place of sweet pots. I did add about 1/8 tsp cinnamon.
