Made as written, but for ten servings instead of twenty. I divided it into individual portions using whisky glasses. I love the idea of pumpkin in a tiramisu but we didn’t care for the whipped cream in it. Next time, I’ll try it without the wripping cream. It’s a beautiful dessert that gives a stunning presentation.
