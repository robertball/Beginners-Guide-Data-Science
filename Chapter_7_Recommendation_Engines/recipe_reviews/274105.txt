I usually have no problems with Chef John recipes, but this did not work out at all.  The eggs cooked almost completely although I followed instructions--perhaps the heat (medium) was too high.  Most other Gelato recipes have the eggs tempered (slowly added) into the warm milk & cream rather than starting out with the eggs heating up with the milk and that has worked for me beautifully.   I  will revert back to that process. I made a double batch and had to throw it out.  :-((.
