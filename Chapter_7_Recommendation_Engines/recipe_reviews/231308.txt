I made this for dinner last night and it must have been very good because there was none left by the time I got around to eating!  Everyone loved it.  I added a little fresh, finely minced ginger with the garlic because we all love ginger.  I used a 10 oz package of noodles as that is the size they came in.  When making this don't over cook the noodles or you will end up with mush.  4 - 5 minutes is all they take.  Have everything chopped and prepped as this comes together really fast and there is no time to stop and measure or chop.

To all those who say this meal doesn't have very much flavor, I want to remind you that chow mien is a  mild dish with subtle flavors. It is not a heavily spiced or spicy dish. I prepared this dish exactly as written being very careful with accuracy in measuring. I followed the preparation as written. The chicken was very flavorful and moist. I did salt it slightly after browning it in the pan. The veggies added the right amount of crunch and sweetness. The flavor was subtle but I thought it was very flavorful. I cooked the noodles 5 minutes, and after assembling all the ingredients together, I brought the broth to a boil, then turned off the burner and let the noodle mixture sit for about 5 minutes. This let them absorb most of the liquid, which made them just the right consistency and the sauce thicker. This is the best chow mein recipe I have ever tasted. Thanks

This is amazingly flavorless in a way that defies physics, cooking and all reason. I dumped in an entire bottle of teriyaki sauce & a cup of peanuts to attempt to coax it back to life, but nothing could be done; our dinner had flatlined.

Watch the video if you haven't yet.   This is really great dish.  I added a bit of coleslaw mix instead of bok choy when I realized I had forgotten to buy some.  Not the same, but it worked out beautifully.  I've used pork instead of chicken, and we've used both.  We love this meal,  I add mushrooms to ours, sometimes little corn on the cobs, whatever we have in the pantry when we get a craving for this chow mein.  It's delicious!

The recipe did take a lot of prep work but the taste was as good as the lo mein noodles in a Chinese restaurant without the greasy taste.  My children loved it and asked for seconds.  I especially appreciated the additions of vegetables.

Changed it a little by replacing the zucchini with bean sprouts and didn't have oyster sauce on hand so just used broth.  We used dry noodles instead of the cooked noodles.  My husband loved it and he is very pick about his Chinese food.

Great recipe, easy to modify... Using what I had on hand substituted skinless thighs, and instead of marinating cooked in very light sesame oil with minced ginger and soy sauce, removed the bones as they cooked & added the cornstarch mixed with a little cold water and 1 Tbsp soy sauce plus a little garlic/onion powder after the broth/oyster sauce/sugar mix.  Also used only 1 head bok choy, but upped to 1 whole small zucchini and added a little celery, 1/2 can water chestnuts and 1/2 can cut baby corn.  Very flexible.  As prepared, it was really flavorful.

This was bland. I did make a couple changes that probably affected flavor some, but I doubt they would have changed the overall flavor enough to make much of a difference. Instead of sesame oil, I used canola oil plus a very generous amount of sesame seeds to get the sesame flavor. Instead of Oyster Sauce, I used 2 T chicken broth + 1/4 tsp white vinegar. To make it palatable, I needed to add a lot more green onion, soy sauce and garlic salt. This is probably a good base recipe. Will play with it to try to make it really good.

This dish is awesome! I must say I modify the recipe by increasing the amount of garlic (8 cloves), add a good splash of oyster sauce to the chicken marinade and increase the amount of sesame oil and soy sauce. Those who have commented that it is flavorless can also try to considerably increase the amounts of sauces. Oh, and instead of 250 gr I put 500 gr of chicken. Simply delicious!! Good food must be made with generous hands, so don't stick too rigidly to the recipe!!

This was really good. Not bland at all, with just the right amount of spice/flavor. I believe this was because what I had on hand was spicy oyster sauce and hot chili sesame oil instead of regular sesame oil. I used two 6-oz packages of precooked yakisoba noodles. I omitted the zucchini. We all enjoyed it and will be making this one again.

Very good.  I put more snap peas in and probably more carrot, but less bok choy and it was much more than 4 servings!!  We definitely have dinner for tomorrow.  Also, I used baked tofu for the chicken and "Not chicken" bouillon (for vegetarians)

Excellent! Made with pork instead of chicken just because I had a surplus of it. Could make with protein of your choice. I used two packages of ramen noodles and my usual stir-fry  veggies: carrots, celery, bell pepper, onions, broccoli. Hubby and I loved it. This is a keeper. Thank you!

It needs more flavor.  I added teriyaki sauce and hot sauce, but still felt like it needed something to spice it up.  Will try it again and vary the vegetables.  Plan to add a lot more garlic as well.

I've made this 3 times now and each time I tweek the ingredients. The last time I made it, it was spot on. I use teriyaki marinade to marinate the chicken and make twice the broth it calls for. I add mushrooms and carrots for more veggies. I won't use bok choy anymore (bok choy in sounthern indiana is way too expensive). I use a large head of cabbage instead and we think it adds much more flavor than the bok choy. I also just use thin whole wheat spaghetti noodles because we tried the organic ramen noodles and they weren't any better (and cost 3 times as much) than the spaghetti. I only gave 4 stars because I switched things up a bit to our taste but this is such a wonderful recipe and is now a once a week dinner in my house!

I doubled the recipe and I diced up two thick pork chops as I didn''t have chicken!  I used the veggies that I had: onion, green onion, carrots, cabbage, our first zucchini from our garden and extra garlic.  I also used Sesame Oil for stir frying everything.
It was wonderful! My husband called it "World Class"!

Delicious! Only I added a can of baby corn to enrich the healthy flavour. Added extra oyster sauce on my own serving as well, which increased the salty taste. Additionally, I used a whole zucchini instead of half, and peeled them to create zoodles. Tricks the tongue into believing beautiful greens are extra carbohydrates!
Next time; however, I would prefer to saute my green onions with the rest of the vegetables, since it is not my preferred taste as a raw garnish. Definitely would cook this dish again!

Did not have any thawed chicken but I had pieces of fish which worked just as well.  Did not have bok choy but used a fennel and added mushrooms.  Did not have chow mein noodles but had flat spaghetti.  All worked just as well.  Drizzled sesame oil on top of final dish.

This was wonderful! Like another reviewer I substituted about half a bag of cole slaw mix (still added carrots since there aren't many in the mix), and I didn't have any oyster sauce but tossed in a little soy sauce and a bit of thai chili sauce. I did use 12 oz of chow mein noodles since it made sense to use the whole bag. I'm not sure why there were complaints about lack of flavor - it doesn't have tons of flavor but it's tasty on its own and nice that everyone can add sauces to their own taste.

Sauce was really tasty. I had to sub a 1/4 tsp of sirracha for the heat (which was the perfect amount). I also doubled the sauce and served it over rice as we had no chow mein noodles.

This was very good flavorful chow mein. The kids liked it, hubby loved it. I used a variety of veges I had in my CSA box. Bok choy, green onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, bell pepper. To me it needed something, I might add some red pepper flakes time.

I used Fortune Yakisoba noodles (2 packages without their seasoning).  I doubled the vegetables (3 green onions also).  I used Coconut Secret Aminos instead of Oyster Sauce.  I used lite sodium Tamari soy sauce.  This dish is great.  I set the chicken aside.  I  cooked the vegetables in batches and combined with the noodles.  I added chicken to the plates of those who wanted it.  Very adaptable.

The store was out of bok choy so I used 1/4 head of regular cabbage instead.  It was very good.  The carrots were a little too crispy for my taste but it could be that I didn't  slice them thin enough.  We will definitely be making it again.

The whole family loved this dish! The chicken was the best part and everyone asked for more chicken in the dish next time we made it. Sesame oil can be a strong flavor, but this was very good. This is going on the regular rotation of meals.

Good easy chow mein dish, takes a bit of prep work but the final result is delicious. I couldn't find "chow mein" noodles at the Asian grocery store or any of the substitutes like Hong Kong noodles, so I used a thin yellow wheat noodle labeled "Canton noodles" which apparently are a Philippine version of Chinese noodles. I will make this recipe again with a thicker noodle.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago and it turned out really good. The whole family liked it but I did double the recipe to make enough for four adults and one child. There was none left. It was easy to make and the video was nice because it showed how to cut the veggies. I will definitely make this again. Sprouts even had new lo mein noodles and we got chopsticks for the authentic Chinese dining experience.

Taste so much better than take out.  Amazing flavor. Next time I will use less noodles. I used two 9 ounce packages of fresh Chinese noodles.  For ratio to veggies. I totally recommend making this. I will definitely be making this part of my menu.

I made it exactly as written and thought it was quite bland and had too much liquid. It’s a good place to start but would definitely make adjustments.

It is true that this doesn't have a ton of flavor, but what flavor there is, is nice.  Instead of sautéing the vegetables in vegetable oil, I used sesame oil.  I also used a full zucchini (it was small) and used 12 oz. of noodles.  In order for there to be enough liquid, I used 1 cup of chicken broth and a little more of each ingredient to flavor the noodles.  We had plenty of leftovers.

Our family loved this one.  All left overs were consumed next day before I could get any by three teenagers.  I used green pepper instead of snap peas, they did not look good at grocery store.  Been making Asian dishes for years and this is the best one we have found.  Thanks for sharing.

It was good, just needed more sauce for flavor.  I tripled the sauce portions and it still could have used more flavor.  It was a good dish, relatively easy to prepare.

I thought that this was excellent! I added onions, and sauted them  in sesame oil before adding the other vegetables, it really added to the flavor. Also I added a bit more soy sauce and oyster sauce for more a more intense flavor.

Love it! It doesn't have a real strong soy sauce flavor, mild, nice and fresh tasting. Much better than a Chinese Restaurant. I doubled it, added top ramen noodles, minus the packets. Next time a touch more sugar.

I added mushrooms and been sprouts and had frozen chicken so I cooked the chicken with the marinade.  Don't think it made any difference in the flavor.

Delicious & easy. I used leftover chicken breasts from last night's dinner and substituted fish sauce for the oyster sauce. (I didn't have oyster sauce on hand) I also added a half teaspoon of ground ginger and served it with a side of steamed rice. Everyone loved it!

This was a very good recipe, sauce just like it is supposed to be. I did sub veggies for what I had on hand and I made quite a bit more sauce than called for, just because I wanted more sauce.  Chow mein is a non-spicy dish, add red pepper flakes if you want more heat.  Thanks

For my meat lovers, we doubled the marinade and the chicken. The marinade makes the chicken quite tender and delicious. In the future, we will use only one book choy, but add more of the other vegetables. Bean sprouts might make a good addition. I'd prefer cooking the green onions, rather than having them as raw garnish.

I've made this at least half a dozen times now. My husband, sisters, in-laws, and 2-year old niece love it. When I made it my niece kept begging for "more noodles", and she can be a picky eater. What we love is the flavour and taste. When having company I have never gone wrong serving this and I always get rave reviews. I cook this in a large cast-iron pot and it works just as well!

This was an easy and tasty dish. I added carrots and yellow and red peppers.
I would double the peanut sauce and add some Thai sweet chilli sauce or something to kick it up next time.

I have made this a few times now, and we really like it, a lot!  Some of the critics thought it was a little blah, but that works for my family, because not all of us like to much spice.  Having said that, I do add exra garlic and fresh ginger to my oil,& my husband & I like it spicier, so at the table we drizzle a tad of hot chilli oil on it.    love it!

I made this for myself and my 3 little boys tonight for dinner.  The only change I made was to put in more cornstarch to make the sauce a bit thicker.  End result - all 3 boys loved it!  That NEVER happens -- especially with a relatively healthy meal!  This is a definite make-again.

The only thing I changed was substituting out some of the vegetables. It was okay, but I think it needs some added seasoning.

The large variety of veggies is what led me to try this.  It needed more soy, or maybe it's because I used the low sodium variety that it lacked taste and the sauce was too thin, so add more cornstarch.  Ginger might help too and maybe sherry for part of the liquid. Also had it over rice instead.  Also added regular onion along with the garlic. I will try adding ginger to the leftovers.

The flavor on the chicken was amazing.  My whole family loved this Recipe.  I used yakisoba noodles instead of chow mein. This will be in regular rotation at our house now.

This is one of my go to recipes now. I add about a tablespoon of chili garlic sauce for extra kick and put in some bean sprouts instead of all noodles. I also only use about one tablespoon of oyster sauce but that's just personal preference. My family loves it every time.

This is an amazing recipe. It does lack flavor in the end so I always add a bit of Thai sweet chili sauce on my plate portion. I dump in a lot more veggies too. And don't over-cook the veggies, it is delicious when they are a bit crispy still. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

I just made this for dinner tonight and my husband called it "The best thing you've cooked in a long time."  He polished off two bowls!  It was a little bland, but we added more soy sauce and hot sauce at the table.  I also added a generous amount of fresh grated ginger to the chicken / soy / cornstarch mixture.  Will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!!

the marinade was good but bought the wrong noodles. It turned mushy.
