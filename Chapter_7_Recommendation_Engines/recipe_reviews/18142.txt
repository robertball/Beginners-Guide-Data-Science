I've made much better chocolate waffles in the past. The taste is so-so. It's thick batter and hard to get out of the waffle maker even if it is sprayed. These do taste somewhat like brownies not so much like the yummy chocolate waffle taste I was expecting. My husband agreed.

I brought these to Thanksgiving and people raved about them and the unique look. I sprinkled just a bit of powdered sugar over the cooled cookies. They sort of had a "snowflake" appearance. These don't have your typical "cookie" texture but they are good. They're also very good as a base for a dessert - waffle cookie scoop of ice cream and hot fudge.

I was so excited for these but they let me down. They had a very boring flavour once cooked. I ate them warm but as they cooled they did get a little better. Won't make these again.

There is simply no reason to make any other chocolate cookie than this. I ice with a one-minute chocolate icing (very tricky) and my family went berserk. You have to take them off the iron just as they get firm exactly one minute cooking on a very hot iron. It's a labor of love but so worth it.

I will definitely make these again. For sure spray your pan. I don't have to spray my pan with waffles but I do with these cookies.

These don't taste like brownies. They aren't very sweet either. They're kinda boring. Don't think I'd make them again. Thanks anyway.

Not spectacular but pretty good. I like that they're not too sweet. I had a hard time getting them out of my Belgian waffle maker...maybe a shallow iron would work best? I might make these again...they were tasty.

Waffles were delicious! Added some cinnamon and chocolate chips to make them better. Had trouble with them in the waffle iron though. Eat them with ice cream and is just like a chocolate waffle cone!

I made these in a heart-shaped waffle iron. Added cocoa nibs and used maraschino juice instead of water as one reviewer suggested. Left them in the waffle maker about a minute and a half. Chewy and delicious! Next time I'll use Amaretto instead of cherry juice for an adult kick. I'll make these again.

I haven't had these in years. I just purchased a Black & Decker 3 in 1 waffle maker mostly to make waffles and waffle cookies. I used a combination of unsweetened and VERY dark chocolate and a chocolate frosting I found in an old 1940s church cook book. Were AWESOME. Darn now I'm hungry for waffles. Maybe some waffles and Black Pudding for lunch. Thx for the recipe. Recommend.

Try spreading the cooled cookie with peanut butter and frost with a chocolate icing. Delicious!

I added a 1/2 tsp of salt because some said they were bland. It must have worked because these were delicious! I also used a 1/4 c. of coconut oil instead of butter to make them dairy free. I don't keep melting chocolate around so I just used 1/4 c. of semisweet chocolate chips. They are a little tricky to get off the waffle iron. They tend to fall apart but firm right up after cooling for a few seconds. I tried to cook them longer thinking they would be more firm and easier to take off but this just made them crispy when they cooled and they were still hard to get off. They really only take a minute or less to cook. They are yummy with coconut pecan frosting. It's like a German chocolate cake cookie??
