Simple, tasty bars that are very fruitcake like. I substituted half brandy, half orange juice for the apple juice and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. They baked up glossy, so didn't need any glaze. I think 48 servings is optimistic. They are thin (which is fine) so I cut 24 to suit our appetites, 32 would have been possible.
