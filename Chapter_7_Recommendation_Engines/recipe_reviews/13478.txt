I took a gamble and made this for Thanksgiving without "testing" the recipe first, and am happy I did.  This is such yummy sweet potato casserole! I doubt I'll try another recipe again, this one was perfect!  I added a little more brown sugar, so it was like a dessert.  A little tip is that if you stir in a cup of mini marshmallows before putting this in the baking dish and stir them around a little you have marshmallow surprises throughout the casserole and not just on top.  Thanks for this recipe!

this recipe was simple, quick, and hit with my family & coworkers.
I used canned sweet potatoes, and it came out great, 1 one pound can with this recipe.
I added a dash of vanilla extract just for kicks. I made this recipex3 to make enough, then
when I had left overs I scooped it into a graham cracker crust with fresh marshmallows on top,baked @350 degrees until marshmallows are light brown, the pie was a hit too.

I added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp *fresh* nutmeg, and 1 tsp orange peel spice. Wonderful! 5 sweet potatoes doesn't make enough for a 13x9x2" pan though - use a 1 1/2 qt. casserole dish instead.  If you want to use a 13x9x2" dish, use 9 slim sweet potatoes, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 tsp. fresh nutmeg, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp. orange peel spice, and 1/4 cup butter.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!!!  I got many compliments on this at the Thanksgiving table. 3 hours after dinner was over my sister went back to heat up more of this!  I made the recipe as is, but I added a "streusel" topping - mix 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup Quaker quick cooking oats with 1/2 cup softened butter until it is like coarse crumbs and sprinkle this over the marshmallows.  It tastes just like the Sweet Potatoes at Boston Market! I also covered mine with foil and baked for 10 min., then uncovered and baked an additional 5 min, so some marshmallows had melted but most of them got toasty.  The only change I would make next time is to add some milk when mashing the sweet potatoes - I would have liked them creamier...all in all extremely yummy.......I will make this at Christmas too! ('05)
P.S. Thanksgiving '07- I used this with 3 cans of canned yams this year to save time.....worked great!!!

This recipe is really good.  The second time I made it, I used half the amount of orange juice, and I preferred it this way.  The entire amount of oj overpowered the sweet potatoes. You can make this a day ahead and refrigerate.  Bring to room temp., heat covered for 30 min., uncover and add marshmallows and cook for 10 more minutes.  When reheating leftovers, you also have to add fresh marshmallows.  This is really a yummy recipe!

Made this for Christmas and even the pickiest eaters loved it.  One tip, I made it with drained canned yams to save time and effort.  Delicious!

My family has done a variation of this recipe for as long as I can remeber.  It's great.  Important to note that using an electric mixer is important for removing all of the strings from the potatoes, so dont shake the forks off.  Also, if preparing hours in advance, dont't put the marshmellows on to bake.  wait until 5mins before serving, stick them on and put dish in to brown for 3 to 5 mins.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was good but didn't seem to wow anyone. I agree with the other reviews about that "orangey" taste -- it just wasn't something that many people warmed up to. If I made them again I would nix the orange juice as well. I tried a diff recipe for Christmas and overall it was a much bigger hit with the same people.

Very easy to make. I used canned potatoes and it turned out well. Next time though I will use a little less orange juice. Found it a little to prominent in the overall taste. My family loved this recipe.

This is a classic holiday favorite! I think it's so much easier to bake the yams until fork-tender, about 25 minutes, rather than boil them because then the skin just comes right off. I mash them up with the ¼ tsp. of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg, ¾ cup of packed light brown sugar, ¼ cup of real butter and 3T. of fresh squeezed orange juice. Lastly, I sprinkled a layer of crushed pecans on top of the sweet potatoes and mini-marshmallows. I place the sweet potatoes back in the oven and bake at 350 degrees for 2 to 3 minutes until the mini-marshmallows melt and becomes slightly golden brown. The yams are always sweet and creamy, the marshmallow topping is nicely toasted, ooey and gooey- a nice touch. The crunchy pecans and brown sugar topping which adds a nice carmelized crunchy texture on the top of the sweet potatoes! The orange juice gives a nice layer of flavor! The yams (sweet potatoes) are high in fiber so I indulged with absolutely no guilt!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving last year and was looking for it again for this year's menu and realized I hadn't rated it!  Of course it was wonderful or we wouldn't be coming back to this recipe.  I loved a lot of things about it -- you can add anything, coconut, pecans, or just keep it as is and it will be great.  You could use a little less sugar, but we are used to the sweetness of this recipe with our traditional Thanksgiving dinner.  

My absolute favorite part of this recipe is no eggs!  I hate the eggy taste in some casseroles and this one holds together just right with no eggs.  Great for people with allergies too.  Thanks for this recipe which will be making it's second Thanksgiving appearance with my family!

Great. My only suggestion would be to halve the orange juice since I felt that the original amount was a little overpowering. No one else noticed so maybe I did just because I knew it was there!

Wow, really yummy! I added some graham crackers, brown sugar and butter to make a crunchy topping.  I also only used 1/2 the bag of marshmallows.

Absolutely delicious!  So easy to make and my entire family gobbled it right up.  This one is a keeper!  My first try, I made the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect.  The second time, I didn't have any mini marshmallows so I tried marshmallow fluff.  This did not turn out as well.  It was rock hard.  The marshmallow got hard and gelled into one large lump.  I lifted it off and threw it away.  We still enjoyed the sweet potato portion, though.  I will only use mini marshmallows going forward.  I also tried adding 1/2 cup chopped pecans for a different texture.  A great variation!

I did not care for the consistancy of this, but I did use a hand mixer to "blend" the mixture. If I had just mashed them slightly it would have possibly been better.
This was way too sweet. All sweet potato casseroles will be sweet. The key is to get the ingredients, textures, and flavors to blend to a sweetness which compliment each other. This was not so. Sorry!

Excellent recipe.  This was my sister's dish to bring over on Thanksgiving, but she's moved away and didn't join us this year.  I was very happy to come across your recipe. My sister's ingredients were the same, but I didn't have the exact measurements to prepare.    Now I can continue the traditional sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. (The only thing I added was a pinch of vanilla extract.)

The reason I rated it low for Kid Friendly was that my 8 year old daughter and her 4 & 6 year old cousins wouldn't touch it since it was "orange and mushy."  I'm sure if they would have tried it they would have loved it.

Oh what a delicious dish! We adore sweet potatoes around here and eat them at least once a week in various forms. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving the first time, and it was just awesome. The only changes I made were to add some powdered ginger, and to use a potato masher to mix everything up, because we like a few lumps. So yummy, and good for you!

The yams are always sweet and creamy, the marshmallow topping is nicely toasted, ooey and gooey- a nice touch. The crunchy pecans and brown sugar topping which adds a nice carmelized crunchy texture on the top of the sweet potatoes! The orange juice gives a nice layer of flavor! The yams (sweet potatoes) are high in fiber so I indulged with absolutely no guilt!

This is a classic holiday favorite! I think it's so much easier to bake the yams until fork-tender, about 25 minutes, rather than boil them because then the skin just comes right off. I mash them up with the ¼ tsp. of cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg, ¾ cup of packed light brown sugar, ¼ cup of real butter and 3T. of fresh squeezed orange juice.

This was ok. Nothing crazy and will probably not make it again unless I have all of my nephews/nieces over for Thanksgiving. Didn't make any changes to the recipe. I wasn't sure what the right amount was for 5 potatoes as they clearly vary in size. I had 5 huge ones but only ended up using 4.  Also, I used a 9x9 dish and the recipe roughly filled it about 2.5 inches high (without the topping).

I prepared this dish last night for Thanksgiving, following the recipe exactly, and it was super easy to make and really delicious.  The only note I wanted to share is that this recipe renders a lot more servings than you think.  We had so many other dishes (mashed potatoes, salads, stuffing, etc.) that most people only took one scoop, especially since it's a dish that is on the sweeter/richer side so most people won't have more than that.  We had 8 people at our table and the recipe that makes 8 servings could have been cut in half and still would have been plenty.  I had more than half of the 9" x 13" pan leftover.  So if you don't want a whole ton of leftovers then I would suggest pairing the recipe down a bit.

I grew tired of my old candied yams recipe and found this.  I used 2 29 oz cans and only 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  After reading reviews about the OJ being overpowering, I cut it down to 1 tablespoon.  I also added way more than a pinch of cinnamon (also some nutmeg and ginger).  It turned out delicious and I think I may have a replacement for our traditional holiday fare.

This was very easy and a quick dish to prepare, made it for my holiday pot luck at work and everyone loved it. I used canned yams instead and it came out delicious!! I made it the night before, warmed it the next day, add marshmellows with the broiler, came out great!

Made it for the first time and everyone loved it! Despite all the marshmallows, the dish wasn't overly sweet. It was just right :) 

As per other reviewers' suggestions, I've added 1/2 tsp. fresh nutmeg, 2 tsp. cinnamon, and a pinch of cloves.

Made this for Thanksgiving for my parents, followed the directions exactly, but it wasn't well received. I think for out family, it was just the spices. Normally the sweet potatoes are prepared without spice and I didn't realize since I never actually eat them. Thanks for the recipe, might just have to try it out on them another time.

So delicious! I use canned sweet potatos and mix everything with my kitchenaid. It makes it pureed- so yummy.

My picky eaters loved this!. I did it for Thanksgiving and will be doing it again this weekend with a ham just because it was so easy to do. I used frozen sweet potato cubes and did mine without the marshmallows but with some extra brown sugar crumbled on top (only a tiny bit). (We're not marshmallow eaters here.) It was a huge hit.

I made this for Thanksgiving, used canned sweet potatoes with syrup and all other ingredients...No one in my family cares for sweet potatoes so of course everyone frowned when i put this dish out...It was fantabulous!! It was gone, I wish I wouldve made more, I was so proud of this recipe!! Thanks Stephanie!

Pretty good.  I forgot to peal the yams, so that was not too good- but that was my mistake.  Tasty with the orange in it. My thanksgiving company liked them.

Great recipe! I served this over the holidays and was told it was better than family's recipe for sweet potato casserole. I added a little more butter than this recipe called for and I used real butter. I also added some nutmeg. I love this recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  I got lots of compliments on it.  It was very easy to prepare.  I made it the day before and baked just before serving time.  It will be a regular!

I used six sweet potatoes and butter instead of low-fat margarine (it's Thanksgiving, live a little!).

I think the receipe as written calls for way too much sugar -- I used half the amount called for and probably would reduce it more next time as sweet potatoes are already, well, sweet. 

Also if you used a whole bag of mini-marshmallows you'd end up with a 1:1 ratio of sweet potato to marshmallow. I prefer a single layer of marshmallows on top.

The amount of oj was good to my taste.

This recipe is excellent, I did however use a "secret ingredient" my grandma used to use.... about 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk mixed in.... also before placing marshmallows on top of potatoes I lightly drizzled syrup to give it extra sweetness. This is a MUST for your Thanksgiving/holiday dinner. Thank you

Absolutely PERFECT just as the recipe states!  Others' will always tweak to their liking, but no need for that with this winner.  Also I've found that when the spices are the star of the show (such as this recipe) be sure to use "good" cinnamon.  It makes all the difference.  Thanks for a great recipe Stephanie!

This is very good it reminds me of the sweet potatoe casserole from Boston Market so I sprinkled the top with some quick cooking oats and it turned out great along with a little sprinkle of cinnamon on the top

I made this recipe today, January 12th, 2014 and it is absolutely the best.  I didn't have marshmallows so I used some Marshmallow Fluff I had, the flavor from the simple ingredients was outstanding.  Will 
most definitely made this again.  My husband was really happy with it.

Thank you so much for this recipe, it will definitely be in my make again recipe batch.

Tried this recipe 3 year ago and it was a big hit! Kids ask for this one every year. The only thing I do a little different is that the pinch of cinnamon has gotten bigger every year, yum! Oh and I use real butter never margarine! Lol. This has become a great family tradition and one that my kids associate with good memories. Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good, as far as sweet potato casseroles go. Next time I will add nuts like I do with other recipes. I also used canned sweet potatoes instead of fresh and thought it was pretty good.

Very nice for Thanksgiving dinner. Good basic recipe that I have been making for years. Next time though: use less sugar and a touch of nutmeg. Also my 2 "pinches" of cinnamon were a little overpowering. (how much IS a pinch?)

I absolutely love this recipe!  I made it for Thanksgiving and was asked to make it again for Christmas.  I took the others advice and used 2 tablespoons of orange juice and I mixed in toasted pecans.  Definately a winner!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving for my in-laws dinner. My husband ate this and said it was very good, which he is very honet about my cooking. When I was growing up my aunt made this all the time and I LOVED it!

I know I'm in the minority, but I really didn't enjoy this recipe.  I followed the directions to the tee, but the combination of orange juice and marshmallows was too sickly sweet.  None of my guests liked it, either.  It was the one dish that was left on each of their plates.  If you like a spicy, nutty, grounded dish, this is definitely not for you.

This is a very good recipe! However, I did change a few things. I used 1/2 cup of butter, Canned Yams, and I substituted Honey for the orange juice. It turned out great! My boyfriend asks for it every weekend!

Leave out the orange juice and you have the perfect straight-up sweet potato dish! On theory the flavors SHOULD be good together, but in practice it's just a little off. Without it, though - homey goodness on a spoon, covered in marshmallows... what's not to love?! I use one 29oz can, smoosh them up with a potato masher (leaving some lumps) and add back approx 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the canned syrup until they're not quite so stiff. I'm pretty generous with the "cinnamon" (which in my house is actually pumpkin pie spice) - a good 5-6 shakes. With one can, you'll fill a pie plate rather than a 9x13 dish. I'm dying to try the streusel topping that MomSavedByGrace added to her review, but it's definitely yummy without it!

Not hard to make at all. I followed the recipe to a tee.I didn't put it in a 13 x 9 baking dish I put it in a 2 qt casserole dish. It came out fine. It is sweet maybe next time I will cut back on the sugar. It is very good though.

Great recipe! Followed the suggestions of others and cut down on the amount of orange juice. Also did a mixture of brown sugar, butter, & pecans to add under the layer of marshmallows. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

This came out great.  I did add a bit more butter and brown sugar because I like them really sweet.  Also I did not use the OJ because I did not have any on hand.  They came out perfect!

Way to sweet!!!! I am a sugar fanatic so I thought the sugar wasn't unreasonable until I ate it!! Maybe because I was eating it with a meal, I don't know, but it was more of a dessert. I also did not whip the sweet potatoes. I just boiled them an cut into chunks. I will make this again, but next time I am cutting the brown sugar in half!

OMG! So easy & so good! I too omitted the orange juice and added a pinch of nutmeg and a dash of vanilla.  I love the crunch on the marshmallows as well.  Super yummy!  Thanks for a great no-fail recipe!

This sweet potato casserole is AMAZING! My husband said they are the best he's ever eaten! I omitted the orange juice, though, and sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the marshmallows. SCRUMPTIOUS! :)

I have never given a bad review before, but I can honestly say that if I could give negative stars here, I would.  This was cloyingly sweet.  I was expecting it to be sweet because of the ingredients, but this was so sweet it was sickening.  The addition of the orange juice was much too overpowering. Don't make this.

I make this every year for my annual holiday party and it's always a hit with the guests!  I never have any leftovers of this and its a dish I'd make again and again for years to come.

I've made this dish several times for different groups of people and everyone likes it.  This year I tried it with a 1/4 cup sugar instead (half the amount called for) and everyone still loved it or liked it more, so I'm sticking with that change.  I'm also a fan of baking the dish in a 9x9 pan because it fits in that size and isn't spread as thin that way.  For that size pan, I only ended up using approx 4 oz of mini marshmallows (1/4th of a 1 lb bag), and that was covering the entire top.  I recommend boiling the potatoes longer than called for by a few minutes, just to be sure all are completely baked through.  I had a large, awkward-sized one that didn't get completely baked through and it was a pain when it came to mashing it up.  One other tip is to serve this dish immediately after it's out of the oven.  Otherwise some of the marshmallows deflate and the dish doesn't look as good, although it still tastes great.

Using a 9x13 pan, I could only stack half a 10.5 oz bag of marshmallows 1-1/2 deep.  Any more would have been messy and overly decadent.  Otherwise, the recipe was spot-on!  Thanks for sharing this! :) Oh, we also used two large (40 oz?) cans of sweet potatoes, which made this recipe a breeze.

Wonderful flavor. My sweet potatoes mashed up fairly dry, so I added some evaporated milk to make them creamier, before adding the other ingredients. In the past, I've made candied sweet potatoes, but this recipe is easier and just as flavorful. And guests loved the slight orange flavor, so I guess it's just personal preference. Try it out before eliminating the juice.

Used this recipe for Christmas and it was a big hit - I received may compliments and was asked for the recipe. Very easy to make and the marshmallows were a nice addition. I did not use the whole bag of marshmallows, though!

Fantastic, but if you have to substitute the large marshmallows for the small ones, look out because they swell up and can hit the top of the oven!  Great recipe!

Recipe is quick, easy and unfussy (although I dulled my potato peeler).  The dish was too sweet for my taste, so I may try again with half the sugar and marshmallows.  I used about half a cup of o.j. which I found just right; I may even try 3/4 cup next time.

OH YES!!!   I loved this recipe.  No changes what so ever.  
The citris flavor does surprise you but it is so light tasting in your mouth instead of heavy/overpowering like a traditional sp casserole. 
YUM and Thank YOU for sharing.

It's not that the basic recipe isn't good, but marshmallow topping?  Too sweet...toasted pecans are MUCH better.

This recipe was everything I hoped it would be.  I was out of orange juice so I omitted that, and substituted unsalted butter for the low-fat margarine and added more brown sugar along with a bit of pumpkin pie spice.  And I used a 9 inch square baking dish instead of a 9x13, which I think would have made the casserole way too thin.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but all were minor so I don't imagine the taste of the finished dish was altered too much.  Either way it was delicious!

Wow!  The orange juice adds a tiny tang to the sweet potatos that is just fantastic.  Highly recommended!  This is also very good without the marshmallows on top, if you want to make it a bit healthier.

Everyone at the table this Thanksgiving loved this recipe, but I didn't mash the yams. Here's how I made it: I cut the yams into bite-sized chunks (not too small) and boiled as directed until they were fork tender.  Then I drained them and laid the cooked (unmashed) yams out into a baking dish. I melted the butter in the microwave and mixed it in with the orange juice, cinnamon and brown sugar, and poured that over the yams.  Then topped with 1/2 bag of marshmallows not the whole bag, and baked for about 15 min.  Came out perfect.

This was WONDERFUL!  My family loved it, even my very picky 8 year old daugther.  I made it twice during the thanksgiving season.  Once I used spleda instead of the sugar.  It tasted great.  This will be a recipe I will use all year round.

This recipe turned out just the way I wanted.
 However, lots of judgement is necessary because the recipe is not very specific, especially in regards to how much potatoes (it says "five," but they can vary in size greatly!). A great recipe is extremely specific so that there isn't a lot of variance. 
Also, low fat margarine? Are you kidding me? Do you know how much sugar you add and then you want to pretend to be healthy? Butter it up!

Loved this recipe as-is, I didn't make any changes. My only disappointment was that at the end, my marshmallows didn't look all white and puffy, instead they seemed to have melted into the casserole. Still tasted great.

Slight change: I added a peeled and eigthed honey crisp apple to the boiling  5 sweet potatoes; added a tsp of ground cinnamon; tbspn of salt;  and, added 2 tbspns of chèvre to enhance the creaminess and give it a hint of HUH.  Was a HUGE hit amongst the entire spectrum of ages from infant to the 80 year olds.

Next time I will leave out the brown sugar altogether, add salt, and use real butter. The brown sugar made this dish way too sweet, even for me with my sweet tooth.

This is awesome! Didn't measure the brown sugar or OJ, just did them to taste. It is WAY more than 8 servings though. Everyone went back for seconds & we still had tons of leftovers! I will say this though: people use "yams" and "sweet potatoes" interchangably and they are not! They are two different things. If you want the pretty orange casserole like the pictures show you want to use yams. Sweet potatoes barely have more color than a normal potato. I used 1/2 of each as I like the orange, but sweet potatoes are supposed to be better health wise.

So Good!  I omitted the orange juice and marshmallows, but added sea salt.  The salt really pulled out the flavor of the potato, and the sugar and cinnamon was just the right touch of sweet.

The orange juice definitely adds a nice touch.  Next time try using the normal large marshmallows instead of the minis.  Gently press them down INTO the potatoes so just the crowns of the marshmallows are exposed.  As the potatoes bake the marshmallows will "melt" right into the sweets!  YUMMY!  Pull it out of the oven when the tops of the marshmallows are golden.

For me, the orange juice only took away from the flavor. If you like your potatoes a little tangy, leave it in. Otherwise, I think you'll find they taste better without it. Also, add a pinch of nutmeg and ginger like another reviewer suggested, it can really be worth it.

I don't eat sweet potatos and have never made a sweet potato casserole.  But I decided to go with this recipe for thanksgiving.  I didn't have orange juice, so I had to do without, and I'm glad I did.  Everyone said it was great, the best they'd ever had.  My husband even said it was better than his mother's, which is a big deal!

I'm not sure if it would have been different if I used fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned but using canned it was 4 stars. Alot of people complained that it was too sweet but in my opinion it wasn't sweet enough. lol. There also wasn't enough to fit in that sized pan so I mixed up a little more. I added the marshmallows throughout because I'm pregnant and have been craving them and I think that saved this for me. haha. Everyone else said it was great but there was still some on some left on their plates. I'll probably make this again with more sugar and cinnamon.

This is the first time in my entire life that I've EVER liked sweet potatoes! This was delicious even before I baked it! I added pure vanilla extract like one reviewer suggested, and it was deLISH! This is the easiest and tastiest sweet potato dish I've ever tried. Thank you!

I have made it several times and everyone loves it.  It's also a perfect side dish for picnics.  Sometimes I used canned sweet potatoes if I'm in a hurry.  I also use 1.5 TB orange juice.  Thanks for publishing this!

I like my sweet potatoes just as well or better without marshmallows.  I have a big sweet tooth, but I'd say this is too sweet.

Overall the recipes was delicious! I added marshmallows and pecans to it for the topping. I would use less orange juice next time even though everyone really liked it and didn't complain about the orangy flavor.

Really good. It had more depth of flavor than any dish like this I've had before. I added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg to sweet potatoes, and I sprinkled the whole thing with cinnamon before baking. I used the hand mixer right in the 9x13 pan, anything to avoid washing another bowl! Easy and good!

This is a great recipe.  Last year, I made it as is, and got rave reviews.  This year, I increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp vanilla, and added "a few pinches" of nutmeg.  Delightful!!

When you add the "Streusel topping" suggested by Momsavedbygrace this is a 5 star recipe every time.  This will be my second year making this recipe for the family holidays and it is always a hit.

Not overly sweet and has a nice tableside presence to it.  It was tastie and everyone had another helping but I prefer sweet potatoes with a bit of consistency left to them.  After mixing the potatoes with the mixer it was more of a puree.

Who the hell knew something that I love so much could be so easy for me to do?  I added some nutmeg and sprinkled from hand rum to the top of the potatoes before adding the marshmallows.  Freaking amazing!  Thank you.

This casserole is amazing, I am not big on eating leftovers and I ate this for 5 days! I did add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the potato mixture to give it some crunch. This was a hit with my entire family, even the 18 month old loved it!

Very good. I made this for Thanksgiving. It was wonderful. I added a splash of orange extract as well as the orange juice to give it a little more citrus flavor. I also didn't whip the potatoes, I just lightly mashed them because our family likes them chunky. Excellent recipe...will make this again - every year.

These were good, but oddly enough, I didn't think they were sweet enough for me.  I am fond of the streusel topping so maybe that's what I was missing, but over all I recieved good reviews for this recipe.  I only used half of the package of marshmallows and that was enough.  Thanks Stephanie.

Really good recipe.  Next time I will cut back on the orange juice to 1 tablespoon as it was a bit too "orangy" for our taste and increase the margarine to compensate.  Served this with the Fruity Grilled Pork Tenderloin and applesauce on the side, and it made for a delicious dinner!  Will be making both these recipes again.

I never had sweet potatoes mashed before.  I had only ever had them in chunks.  I LOVED this and will never eat chunky sweet potatoes again.  Mashed is the way to go!!! Everyone loved this.  I will probably continue to make this each Thanksgiving and maybe throughout the year!!!  I didn't have orange juice on hand, so I used apple. I used canned yams instead of peeling and slicing the sweet potatoes. SO SO easy.  It was great - the best sweet potato recipe ever.

Made this exactly as written & everyone raved about it. Even had 2 ladies ask for the recipe. Very simple!  My only adjustment for future versions is baking the yams instead of peeling, slicing & boiling...much easier on the hands just popping yams in the oven & scooping out the soft tater. This of course will increase the prep time but peeling & slicing was a pain for me. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is delicious! First time having a sweet potato casserole and I was absolutely disgusted by the idea of it. Well the joke's on me because this is amazing and I've been depriving myself for who-knows how long. Very easy and tasty. Will be adding this to special family dinners.

Sweet Potato Casserole II Haiku: "I didn't like this. But Christmas guests disagreed. So we'll say it's good." My daughter wanted to inject her own side dish tradition into our holiday meals, so she chose this recipe to make at Thanksgiving, where we followed it as written and weren't entirely blown away. Making it again at Christmas, we added nutmeg, reduced the OJ, and sprinkled toasted, chopped pecans on top and it was better. I guess it tastes too much like dessert to me which is why I don't like vegetables that are prepared this way, but everyone else enjoyed it, and better yet was having my daughter willingly help in the kitchen!

Wow this could NOT have been easier.  I actually made these using canned yams (because I was having a pretty considerable "episode" with my lower back issues, and peeling/boiling from scratch didn't sound fun).  I barely measured anything.  I threw three 32oz cans of can yams (drained) and the 1/2 cup packed brown sugar into my kitchenaid mixer, and started beating them on low.  Tossed in about 3/4 of a stick of softened butter, and then eyeballed pouring in some Sunny Delight (that's what I had on hand) and shook some cinnamon in right from the jar (I also didn't want to do many dishes haha).  Once that all looked pretty mixed together, I spread it into my casserole dish, covered it and put it in the fridge to take to a friend's house later.  There, I baked them for 30minutes, uncovered at 350, until they were nice and hot, then threw on the marshmallows and kept an eye on them until they were golden brown and puffy.  Everyone loved them, and I will definitely be making these again as a "regular" side dish--not just holiday.

This was so easy to make and came out picture perfect and very delicious. I did read some of the reviews, but mostly followed the actual recipe. Only differences were: used real butter instead of margarine, cut orange juice in half, and added a tiny pinch of nutmeg. Everyone was taking pictures of it, it looked so beautiful, and then raved about the taste. It's a keeper!

Made it at thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I only modified by using earth balance (vegan) butter and Dandies (vegan) marshmallows. Actually,  I've made it twice and the Trader Joe's marshmallows which happen to be vegan worked even better but they are only in stock for like two weeks a year :(  
Dandies will do fine though. Also, I didn't use a mixer. We like the texture. Only problem now is my daughter wants this every day...

This was absolutely delicious.  I  substituted this for another recipe I have made before at the last minute.  Everyone loved it.  Instead of boiling the potatoes, I baked them on 400 for one hour and 30 minutes.  It just seemed easier since raw sweet potatoes are like rocks and very hard to cut.  I forgot the cinnamon, but they were so good that next time I will probably leave it out.  They were surprisingly sweet with not huge amount of sugar.

Simple. Classic . I added a bit of vanilla extract, more light brown sugar (Instead of half a cup, I used 1 cup)a dash of nutmeg and about 2 1/2 tablespoons of orange juice.  This turned out to be awesome. I added more sugar only because I doubled the amount of sweet potatoes.

I find that sweet potatoes vary so much in size that it's tough to make this work if you can't eyeball the equivalent of 5 "average" sized potatoes. I too reduced the amount of orange juice by half. And I put a layer of  chopped pecans between the sweet potato mixture and the marshmallows. Ooey gooey goodness!!

I usually don't like sweet potatoe casserole, but I love this one!  Used one 40 oz can of yams in syrup and skipped the cooking part.. then I goofed; I cooked it at 325 degrees for 30 mins and once I realized that I put it in the oven at 350 for maybe 5 minutes and it came out perfect!  I loved the toasted Marshmallows on top and the orange juice helped make it fresher and not as bittersweet..  Will definitely keep this recipe around for the future!

I love this recipe!! It was very simple and easy to follow. The only tweeks I made was to add a splash more of orange juice which enhances the flavor, 1/3 cup more of brown sugar to decrease the bitterness, and sprinkled a little more cinnamon to where it was just enough, not overpowering. But I will definitely be incorporating this more in the future.

Love this! It's so good! And really easy. I only have an 8"x8" pan so I only used 3 sweet potatos and didn't change anything else, except I used regular size marshmallows, and it turned out perfect :) thanks for the recipe!

Amazing - the OJ added a bit of zing.  Also, not a fan of margarine - used butter!

I didn't want a billion ingredients or a ton of work. Found this little treasure and all were smacking their lips thanking me. If it isn't easy, it's not in my recipe box. Thanks! :)

I picked this recipe because 1.) had the least sugar than all the other recipes and 2.) it was by far the simplest to make! I also needed a kid-oriented dish so the marshmallows will entice the hardest to please in our house. :) 
The only qualm I have with the recipe is that it calls for margarine... not the healthiest option with the trans fats. Butter is better. Easy replacement and the recipe is perfect! Thank you!

For the first time ever, I actually ate a sweet potato casserole.  There wasn't a drop of this casserole left.  The entire family loved it.

Great base recipe. I'm giving it 4 stars because it IS such a great base-and no eggs! 

Didn't like the orange juice, and thought it was way to much sugar. I used half the brown sugar, and added 2 tbls of Maple Syrup instead. Also added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, and just a pinch of chayenne to add a little zip. 

I also found with all the holiday baking-instead of boiling the sweet potatos, I roasted them on the bottom rack. Made a MUCH sweeter caserole. And there were no extra pots to wash. All in all, my kids favorite by far-is the marshmallows! But they'll eat anything coated in toasted sugar.

Made this last year and it became my hubby's favorite so it's been at every holiday meal since.  I stripe mine on top with cornflakes (to give it some crunch) and marshmallows.  Great recipe!

I did a test run before taking it to a Holiday feast, and with the marshmallows in addition to the brown sugar, it was too sweet for me, and I have a pretty big sweet tooth.  When I make it for the feast, I will leave out the brown sugar altogether, add salt, and drastically reduce the number of marshmallows used.

I loved it and so did my whole entire family (all picky eaters)! It tasted more like a dessert than a side dish. I'm happy to say there are leftovers.

This is the exact recipe I grew up with!  The only thing my mom adds is 1/4 cup crushed pineapple (strained).  I went above that and add a dash of nutmeg and fold in a few handfuls of fresh cranberries in there too.

SO DELICIOUS!

Yummy! Never made these, and I WILL again. I id not think the mixture was initially "sweet" enough so when I placed the mixture into the pan, I sprinkled brown sugar on top and then cinnamon before putting on the marshmallows.

I love this recipe. It took no time to prepare and bake. It's a must have if you have sweet potatoes left over and don't know what to do with them!

This was a big hit!  Used real butter and added pecans.  Could maybe use a bit of salt... and I'm intrigued by the other reviewers suggestions of sprinkling some brown sugar on top.

I made this following the recipe exactly (no subs, no additions), and brought it to my son's preschool Thanksgiving lunch. I thought it was pretty good, although something seemed to be lacking... the flavor was a bit flat. Maybe it needed some salt? (I know it's a sweet dish, but even dessert recipes call for at least some salt.) Anyway, all in all not bad, although I will probably search for another recipe next year.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving with a few changes.  I used 1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 tsp allspice,  1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt.  I would make this again.

Great recipe. I added a pinch of nutmeg and used pineapple juice in place of orange juice. I baked my sweet potatoes whole instead of boiling them, much more convenient when cooking multiple recipes at once. Also you can bake them the night before!!! Love these Traditional recipes.

Delicious!  Just like my childhood memories!  I prepared it with canned yams, and I felt the results were excellent!  I also added just a little bit more marshmallows, to cover the entire top.  Excellent!  No leftovers!

Delicious!  Just like my childhood memories!  I prepared it with canned yams, and I felt the results were excellent!  I also added just a little bit more marshmallows, to cover the entire top.  Excellent!  No leftovers!

This dish was great! My family who doesn't even like sweet potatoes loved it! I didn't have any orange juice so I substituted for vanilla.

this was fantastic and just as I remember Sweet Potato Casserole should taste!  I didn't use orange juice as recommended by other reviewers.  I also added some vanilla and used 2 cans of sweet potatoes instead to save my sanity.  It came out perfect!  This is definitely going in my recipe box.  Thank you for the basics!

This Thanksgiving was the first time I've ever made sweet potatoes this way and this recipe did not disappoint. The potatoes were wonderfully light and fluffy, and it was great to find this out during a meal where most o f the foods are heavier and more filling! Great stuff! This is a keeper and is going in my Holiday Favorites!

Fabulous!  It was a bit different from the sweet potato casserole of my childhood; I wasn't accustomed to the OJ, but I found it to be the perfect addition.   I added a layer of pecans and brown sugar under the marshmallows- YUM!

Althought difficult to determine what one sweet potato equals since I seemed to buy the super sized ones during thanksgiving, I estimated them to be average sized in the recipe and was right.  This casserole was a hit both years i made it! And if its not sweet enough during the cooking process, you just simply add more marshmallows. I made triple the recipe last night and it came out awesome. I now save this one as one of my permanent recipes! Thanks a bunch.

This was really good, I used canned yams instead of fresh. Seemed like it was missing something but still really tasty.

This was amazing!  I baked the sweet potatoes rather than boiling them.  I halved the OJ.  I used 1.5 tsps cinnamon and pinch of nutmeg.  I also used real butter (it was a holiday after all).  This was a treat!  Thanks for the recipe.  Just like my grandmother used to make.

I thought that this recipe was very good, however the family said it wasn't sweet enough. I also omitted the orange juice because of some of the other reviews. Again I thought this was very tasty.

This recipe has been a family favorite and a tradition for many years.  The OJ gives it a bit of tang, but the butter and brown sugar give it something special....and the marshmallows - well!?!  Our family likes this better than candied yams

An excellent classic recipe.  The cinammon really adds something special to this recipe.  I cooked the day before, placed the marshmallows on top, but didn't brown the marshmallows until 30min prior to dinner.  That created a gooey mess on top, but I just added more marshmallows on top of the goo and it turned out great getting many comments.

This was really good with thanksgiving dinner. I made too much and next time will make it according to the amount listed. I added chopped pecans in and on top. Also a bit of nutmeg. Definatly will make again but will not double the recipe. It is very sweet and a little goes a long way!

This was great!  My family doesn't like the sweet potatoes with marshmallows, so since they weren't here, I wanted to have it.  I resized the recipe smaller, subbed skim milk for the orange juice, and used Splenda brown sugar.  I also left the skin on the potatoes and baked them instead of boiling.  It took longer, but it was wroth it!  Yum!

Good recipe, I made this as a thanksgiving side dish. Next time I would decrease the orange juice by half even though my 1 1/2 year old ate it up and asked for more.

Very good! We cut our sweet potatoes into chunks instead of slices and didn't mash them, as we like ours chunky. The perfect amount of other ingredients for a great dish!! :)

my daughter made this yesterday, and it was very good.  my youngest, who rarely tries anything new, ate three helpings!  she didn't whip the potatoes, but mashed them slightly, leaving large chunks which gave a nice textural interest.

I used canned sweet potatoes in order to same some prep time for this casserole. I blended the ingredients with a fork which left the potatoes "chunky". Everyone enjoyed this addition to my Thanksgiving menu.

These were really delicious.  The splash of OJ keeps them from being too sweet.  My father-in-law is not a huge fan of sweet potatoes and he loved them.  Will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks!

Was looking for a recipe like my mom used to make. I never remembered her using orange juice, but I went with it, and it was fantastic!

My boyfriend made much adieu about not liking sweet potatoes, but agreeing to try them because I made them, and he ended up eating three servings!

My grandmother has always been the one to make the sweet potato casserole in my family. This is our first holiday w/o her, so it fell to me to make the casserole. I found this recipe and everyone loved it and agreed that it was almost as good as hers.

p.s. my sweet potatoes were HUGE, so I added extra brown sugar, cinnamon and butter to accommodate the amount of sweet potatoes.

This was my first time baking sweet potatoes. I really loved it and so did my guests. I increased all of the ingredients by a half because I was serving more people but still cooked it in a 9x13 pan. It turned out fine. I used half the marshmallows and added nutmeg.

A good recipe for Thanksgiving. Not overly sweet but just right. My family liked.. especially the marshmellow topping. My only reservsation about it was the time involved. It certainly would have saved some time to not have to cut up and boil the sweet potates first especially when your preparing a large holiday meal. But, the preparation is the tradition of Thanksgiving, right?

Made this one for Thanksgiving dinner, and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  However, I did end up using about 2 tbsp more margarine and 1/4 cup more brown sugar. The OJ was a nice touch, although I didn't use as much since I didn't want it to overpower the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  Also, this recipe calls for WAY too many marshmallows, I only used enough to lightly cover the top of the casserole dish!!!  Will make again...with my adjustments.

My family loved this recipe.  It was simple to make, I actually used a can of yams which had been in sweetened syrup and I added a small can of crushed pineapple.  .  One of the comments was that it was "very sweet".  I think that's because of the yams being packed in syrup.  But, my point is, this was super easy to make and was a big hit with my family.  I will use this recipe again, and again, and again.......

My family loved this recipe.  It was simple to make, I actually used a can of yams which had been in sweetened syrup and I added a small can of crushed pineapple.  .  One of the comments was that it was "very sweet".  I think that's because of the yams being packed in syrup.  But, my point is, this was super easy to make and was a big hit with my family.  I will use this recipe again, and again, and again.......

Delicious! I wanted it to be more of a souffle style, so I added 2 eggs and 1/4 cup of evaporated milk. Will definitely make this again!

This dish is very good, but it was too sweet for me. I will cook it again, but I will add lots more potatoes and keep everything else the same. Of course you can't prepare the dish any faster than the potatoes will cook, so the quickness depends on your pans. For the kid friendly rating, most children won't eat anything orange and mushy.

I dont usually include sweet potatoes with my holiday dinner but I was hungry for them this year. This recipe looked close to my moms so I added a half can of crushed pineapple, mashed it all together ( I baked my sweet potatoes ahead of time) baked it like the recipe said for 25-30 minutes. Marshmallows were perfectly browned and even my finicky eater, loved them!! They are now permanently on our Christmas menu.

Oh my goodness is this good! After reading the reviews, I put in 1/2 the amount of orange juice.  I also added brown sugar to taste and a T of butter for health purposes. The day before, I cooked and mashed the fresh sweet potatoes adding just a little milk to make it creamy. The day of, I added the marshmallows to the top and baked till the marshmallows were toasty brown.  Everyone loved this and with some simple changes, it was more healthful.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I’d never made a sweet potato casserole before. It was delicious. I improvised a bit by putting in a bit more margarine than called for and, in addition to the orange juice, I liberally sprinkled ground orange peel in to give a bit stronger orange flavor. It worked well. The taste was still primarily the sweet potato but with a nice hint of orange.

It was as good as the first time I ate it. It’s hard to peel and cut raw sweet potatoes, so I picked smaller baking size and just boiled them whole and when they were soft through with a fork, I drained, cut in half and popped the flesh out of the skin and mashed them, then continued...

Good base recipe and in addition to the recipe,  here is what I do:

Hold off on the sugar and orange juice.

Bake the sweet potatoes until they are soft when pierced with a knife. Let them cool until they are just warm. Cut off the fibrous ends, and then hand peel them, which is easy.  Baking brings out their natural sugars. 

 Add some crushed pineapple bits, liquid and all. Add melted butter or margarine--you can go by the amounts listed. Roughly mash and blend with a fork--keep some of it "lumpy". Add 1/4 bag of the marshmallows in (I use miniature), and top with the rest and bake.  The baked sweet potatoes, marshmallows, and pineapple add more than enough sweetness. I also add a bit of nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon to taste to this as well.

Very delicious, I made a vegan version  with vegan butter and vegan marshmallows, perfect for when you want something sweet, but not too sweet :)

MY family has  been making a variation of this recipe for years...  we add a can of drained crushed pineapple per pound of sweet potatoes and usually go a little lighter on the brown sugar, though the slight tartness of the pineapple works to cut the sweetness a bit in its own. For liquid, the pineapple or a combination of pineapple and orange juice works well.

My husbands family loved this! The marshmallow topping was a huge hit! For something my mother-in-law thought no one would eat a lot of it was all gone at the end of the night! That’s quite the achievement for my husbands picky family.

This recipe has been my go-to for every Thanksgiving for the last 4 years, and I brought it to Christmas Eve this year as well. It is excellent! I do add a little more cinnamon than what it calls for but that's only after I had made it according to the recipe measurements. It is a great complement to the more savory parts of the meal like turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. Try making it and you will be asked to make it for many more special occasions. That's a promise!

I followed the recipe as directed the night before. I had to work on Thanksgiving but left detailed directions with my husband on what to do. Usually me and my mother in law are the only ones that eat it so I only made a 8x8 size pan. I almost didn't get any. Thanks to my husband he said something as my nephew was about to finish it off. I've been asked to make more for the family Christmas dinner. Going to triple it.

I love this recipe for sweet potatoes. But I made the mistake of using canned sweet potatoes once. Won't do that again. It just wasn't as good as using fresh.

I made the dish and was very happy with it!  I used butter instead of margarine. It's healthier that way.  I used the brown sugar, but you can use maple syrup instead.  The best was when I put the cooked potatoes into the food processor.  They came out like pure silk.  Delicious!

This receipt is great! My family loves it! I made the sweet potato ahead of time and put on the marshmallow last and just popped it in the oven for a little bit to brown them. The flavor is amazing. We probably shouldn’t make this dish too often. It’s dangerous!!

This turned out better than I expected because I had less potatoes than required and no orange juice. It was very easy to make. I prepared it the night before I cooked it so I just needed to pop it in the oven.

This year I will double the recipe for Thanksgiving because  we ran out.  My family loved this, and I didn't know that they liked sweet potatoes.  In fact, my son wanted me to send him the recipe so he could make it  for his office pot luck lunch.   I make this during  the year also and every time it is a huge hit.

Delicious! I used one tablespoon of orange juice instead of three (as other reviews suggested) and I used a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for. It was great, will definitely be making it again!

This was super easy and nummy.  I took the advice of another reviewer and made the potatoes the night before.  I didn't use any orange juice either (based on what other reviewers said).  I will keep this one on my recipe list for next Thanksgiving!

Everyone liked the dish & was an overall hit. The only change I made was using butter instead of margarine. I personally found it a little sweet & will probably cut back on the OJ next time & add more cinnamon.

My family LOVES this sweet potato casserole. It is SIMPLE and TASTY, but not too much work that it would interfere with other holiday dishes. I used the marshmallow topping and also added in the center the crumbled nut topping from Chef John's Sweet Potato Casserole, using cashews (had those at hand). It was delicious!!! Will certainly make again.

This recipe was okay.  I'm unsure why it calls for orange juice.  It kind of takes over the flavor.  Thank you for posting the recipe.

Really good. I do suggest buying large potatoes. The orange juice really livens up the flavor and it was super easy to make. When you boil the potatoes raw, the skin rolls off the potato like toilet paper being pulled off a roll. Very easy and barely a mess to clean.

I tried a couple years ago to make a sweet potato casserole from my Mom's old recipes. It was a flop! My kids begged me to make it this weekend so I tried this recipe. It was easy and soooo delicious. We added additional butter and more cinnamon.

I roasted the sweet potatoes in the oven Instead of boiling them.  I also  added toasted pecans to the potato mix before baking.  They tasted great!

i have been bringing this recipe to thanksgiving for four years now and STILL get wide eyed compliments of how delicious it is! Family members who have confessed to hating sweet potatoes (and only trying because they didnt know what it was) are crazy about it!! This recipe deserves to be top of the list for holidays, it makes you famous in your family and it tastes like you are having dessert with dinner....which is my favorite part! :)

I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving (October), and any that didn't go at the table was requested for the take-home packages!  It got raves!  I didn't add the OJ, but I did toss in a couple punches of nutmeg (next time, might add a bit of Allspice). Easy to make, inexpensive, great reviews = WINNER!

Love this casserole.  I add crushed pineapple and use the pineapple juice  instead of the orange juice.  I bake the casserole, then add the marshmallows the last ten minutes.

I used 4 large potatoes and milk instead of OJ, added chopped pecans to the marshmallows.  Will try the oats and brown sugar mixture another reviewer listed next time.  Really yummy!

These were the most complimented dish for our Thanksgiving feast. I skipped the orange juice, and used an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar, as well as a little vanilla. The result was far superior to any store-purchased dish, and much better than canned sweet potatoes.

I have made and eaten many different sweet potato casseroles, but this is absolutely my favorite. I made it to go with Thanksgiving dinner today, and I'm already looking forward to making it again for Christmas. Easy to make (and make ahead) and absolutely delicious.

A word of caution.  Do not use colored marshmallows as I did one year. Simply easy recipe that always tastes great.
Oh, also if you cheat and use canned sweet potatoes, DRAIN them first!

This dish reminds me so much of Texas Roadhouse's loaded sweet potatoes! The first time I made with the exact ingredients. Like other reviewers, I was turned off by the orange-y taste so I leave the juice out. As sweet potatoes raw are hard to peel, we cut them in half and boil them with their skins, then after they cool, the skin peels right off. This is a new favorite holiday dish.

Followed it exactly, except cut orange juice in half and added a handful of marshmallows into the mixture, in addition to the ones on top. I loved it & thought taste was great. Kids said it wasn't sweet enough....I think they are crazy, lol.

My family loved it!  I usually bake sweet potato pies but decided to try a new recipe.  My family members and guests were in love with it!  I actually made it a second time for a friend's "Black Friday Celebration".  Her guests raved about it!

Oh my goodness!! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was AMAZING!! I did everything exactly as outlined by the recipe.  It's best if you eat it immediately because the marshmallow doesn't heat well in the microwave.  Next time I'll try the oven for a reheat.  SO GOOD! Highly recommend!

Another great recipe. When I make it again though, I'm going to cut back on the Orange juice. I could REALLY taste it in the finished product here. Not bad, just not the flavor I was ultimately going for.

By far, my favorite sweet potato casserole recipe.  Instead of boiling, I baked the sweet potatoes as I had other things to do in the kitchen.  This was a time-saver as I only had to split them open and scoop them out.  They weren't too sweet.  My husband actually liked them where he normally does not care for them.

So I accidentally got white sweet potatoes instead of the orange ones (what some people think are yams, they aren't a yam is a different thing) but still used this recipe and they were fantastic. If you have someone who doesn't like the orange sweet potatoes because they are too sweet and the texture is too soft I highly suggest the white sweet potato.

Great recipe I added 2 pinches of nutmeg with the cinnamon and pecans to the top before putting the marshmallows on. Was a huge hit my husband hates sweet potatoes and he even liked them.

I did this for Thanksgiving this year.  First of all, I do not care for sweet potatoes but it seems that everyone looks for this as a side dish, so I decided to use this recipe.  I have to say that it was the hit of the dinner, everyone loved it.  There was no left overs for this dish. The only thing that I may have done differently was that I made this dish the night before and reheated it. I will keep this recipe and make it for Christmas as well.

Delish! I've always been a HUGE fan of sweet potatoes covered in toasty marshmallows (mmmm...). It's been a family tradition for as long as I can remember. Every bite of this was like taking a trip down (childhood) memory lane. :) My only (minor) gripe is that this was not sweet enough for my liking (yes, I like SWEET potatoes!). My potatoes were quite large, so this could be the reason why. To compensate, I added ~ 1/4 c. additional sugar, another T or so of OJ and a t of pure vanilla. NOTE: For those of you who don't care for "stringy" sweet potatoes, use a mixer to combine them with everything else. All the strings will "wrap" themselves around the beaters. Just be sure to NOT scrape after beating! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Stephanie! This is and always will be one of my holiday favorites! :-)

Excellent!  Loved the flavors.  I used about 1 tsp of orange zest instead of orange juice just because I didn't have any.  Worked great.  I also used allspice, extra cinnamon, and the streusel topping like other reviews and loved it!  Thanks so much!

I started making this on my own a few years ago after having it at a party. However, like some I did not care for the orange taste and replaced it with molassas. This gave it a smoky flavor and my family really likes it.

My mother was coming over to spend a pre-Christmas lunch and I needed a quick, simple sweet potato casserole for my last minute procrastinations.

This recipe saved me and was so simple to make. Also, it was really yummy. The pinch of cinnamon is a wonderful touch. Thanks. Definitely gonna make this again!

I tried this recipe this Thanksgiving and loved it.  My variations: I mashed the potatoes instead of whipping, used fresh orange juice for a very nice subtle taste, and added 1/2 cup raisins just for fun.

I myself truly loved this recipe for thanksgiving this year.  My oldest son loved it. Not sure about other members of the family.  I have one son who is Autistic and is very picky regarding food and texture.  I found myself eating it as a dessert it one point.  I did find though that the marshmallows on top were a bit chewy if not warmed up again.

Personally, I don't like sweet potatoes very much, but my family adored the dish! I added the streusel topping that another reviewer suggested - it really made the dish. I also only used 1/2 a tbs. orange juice, threw in a splash of heavy cream, and added a little extra cinnamon - we are cinnamon fanatics in my family!  I baked it covered in foil for 15min at 350 degrees and then broiled it, uncovered, for a couple of minutes to brown the marshmallows. Delicious!! Thanks for the simple recipe!

I used a 23 oz. can of sweet potatoes and cut everything else in half. This was good, but a little too sweet for my liking. Was also a little runnier that I expected.

This was awesome.  Much better than most sweet potato recipes.  The juice added a nice sweet flavor.

This is okay.  My family prefers the way I usually make sweet potatoes but I was looking for something different.  I think I will try this adding some whipped egg whites and see if I can get a lighter, creamier texture. I would cut down on the marshmallows next time too.  Very sweet.

This was the Thanksgiving favorite! It was so yummy alongside the turkey.  It will definatley be on next years Thanksgiving menu!!  I increased the recipe to 9 sweet potatoes and kept the rest of the ingredients the same just to make sure it wasn't too sweet...it came out perfect!

i made this last night for THanksgiving ive never made sweet potatoes at all before i thought it was very easy to follow and the results were great.  I did however only add 2 tbls of orange juice and it was just fine. My 11 year old said it was the best and begged me to make it all the time now.  I loved the crispy marshmallows on top.

This was good, nothing exceptionally special, but easy to make with good flavor.  I will probably try a new recipe next year, maybe something with a streusal topping.

The best sweet potatoes I've ever made; even my husband, who doesn't like s.p.'s liked them.  I used fresh orange juice from half an orange, and didn't mash the potatoes (it's hard enough to keep them from being too heavy anyway, I thought the chunky texture would help out) but had them cut into 1/2 - 1" chunks, and added about 1/4 c cream to the brown sugar and butter sauce, and went light on the marshmellows.  Very pleasant flavor, not heavy as some can be.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I loved the ease of this recipe.  I used garnet yams instead -- delicious!  The yams were so sweet I could probably have halved the brown sugar or even left it out.  The cinnamon gives it a delightful twist. Next time I'm going to try it if I just layer the ingredients instead of blending it -- just to give it a little more texture.

My husband made this yesterday. I have never liked sweet potatos with mashmallows, but these potatos were good. Sweet potato size varries greatly... we used 3 pounds and it worked great. Thanks for your recipe.

This rating comes from others who I served this dish to since I do not care for sweet potatoes.  I am not sure they were being completely honest though as only a little portion of the casserole was eaten!  One of the problems, could have been my fault.  I did not have any plain cinnamon so I used pumpkin pie spice.  I thought that perhaps the mixture of spices would give it good flavor.  I had one person comment that they didn't care for the spices very much.  That it almost tasted bitter.  I explained that it was probably the nutmeg in the pumpkin pie spice and they agreed that was probably it.  So, just using cinnamon may have helped but I still don't think much more of it would have been eaten.  I am done trying sweet potatoe casserole as this is the second year in a row and second recipe that has just not been a hit with my family.

So Good! I did not have any orange juice, so I used a tiny bit of orange extract instead. I also added a little bit more cinnamon and brown sugar. It turned out more like a dessert. But everbody still loved it. Thank you!

This was pretty good.  But as is usual for recipes in allrecipes, it is pretty sweet.  I cut the sugar in half and used a whole lot more cinnamon and it turned out pretty good.

I'll never use another sweet potato recipe again! My friends and family who don't like sweet potatoes will devour this! (My kids, too.)

Served this at Thanksgiving.  Everybody loved it.  I used a little more sugar &  butter (real not diet) than recipe called for.  I whipped potatoes with electric mixer to save time. Really fast and easy.
