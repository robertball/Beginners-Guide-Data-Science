I used this exact recipe provided to make a raspberry vinaigrette. I then added 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup rice wine vinegar, and pepper to taste. Placed it in a bottle, shook it up, and drizzled it on my salad. It was wonderful!

I didn't mash but put it in the food processor and blended I dreaded of mashing. It was just easier for me. I did wait for it to steep and cool before doing it. It may be a little thicker but the taste was still good. I used a little more than 1 c of raspberries too. Put it in some fresh lemo aide and it was delicious!

Great recipe for making one of my favorite cocktails - Raspberry Limoncello Martinis.  I keep frozen raspberries on hand so I can make this at any time. Thanks for posting!

I made this using frozen raspberries to use in raspberry lemonade sangria. This was so easy and came out wonderfully! I doubled it with no problem. I didn't mash and strain because I don't have a fine strainer, but I used my immersion blender and it is fine. I'd probably boil it longer to thicken it for anything but drinks.

Multiplied due to 5 cups of raspberry sauce. Came out pretty runny. Should have cooked longer to thicken.

Good recipe.
You can also replace the sugar with a substitute such as Splenda for a sugar free option. 
I doubled this recipe and it made about 2.5 cups. 
You don't have to be exact with the measurements,  but don't stay too far. 
Make it multiple times and adjust to your personal liking. 
Share the results!
