This is a great recipe but instead of using canned peas, beans and corn I used frozen and added a few handfuls of barley to round out the nutrition. Thanks for sharing!

This is exactly like the Autumn Soup I have made for years in the Fall.  It doesn't seem like it would be tasty but it is wonderful with crusty bread.  I have brought this to work and everyone wanted the recipe.  An inexpensive, flavorful meal.

Hobo Beef & Vegetable Soup: "I'd give this a 2. But my family ate a TON. To me, it lacked 'oomph.'" Watching my husband and daughter gleefully devour their bowls made me nudge my rating up a star. This is definitely one of those soups that can clear out the remaining bags of frozen veggies, which is the way I went as I'm not a fan of the texture of canned green beans, peas, or corn. I followed the recipe exactly, (w/ the exception of the frozen veggies) and I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. The end result, while tasty, wasn't mind-blowing, although when I went to simmer it on day 2, I added 1/2 c. ditalini pasta, which helped sponge up a bunch of the liquid. It's just a soup that can't decide if it wants to be chili, or a stew, so if I made it again, I would either sub stew meat for the ground beef (going the stew route), or decrease the liquids and sub kidney beans for the green beans & peas (going the chili route.) But regardless of which direction I took this recipe, I would most definitely bump up the seasonings; more garlic, pepper, thyme.

I can't give 5 stars because I did make some changes.  I used stew meat, celery salt instead of seed, a bag of frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned and a 15 oz can of tomato sauce because we like it more saucy.  This was a hit and I will certainly make it again, using the same changes.

Delish!  I changed a few things this time I made it. I used plum tomatoes that I smashed w/ about 8 ozs of tomato sauce instead of the canned tomatoes. Added two extra potatoes and about 3 cups extra beef broth. I will DEFINITELY be making this again--also great the second day!!
UPDATE: This time I also used fresh green beans instead of the canned and cooked the soup in a pot on the stove-top. Way good with all the fresh veggies! Thanks for a great recipe. :)

This is a great soup and I've made it several times. One time I was in a hurry and put the ground beef in the crock pot raw and it cooked up fine. Another time I used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned. My husband doesn't like chunky stewed tomatoes so I use tomato sauce. Half way through I add more beef broth because it usually needs it.

This was very satisfying after a full day of yardwork. I only had a 32 oz carton of beef broth so I skipped the potatoes since I thought they might soak up too much liquid. I followed the advice of the reviewers and used a half bag of frozen veggies. The only reason I took away a star was because I added some Italian seasoning and am glad I did. It made it perfect for us. I liked that the broth was more beefy than tomatoey. I will make this again with the potatoes but will make sure to have extra beef broth on hand as the recipe states.

Yummy. My crock pot filled up before I could add the beans and peas, which was okay, because I didn't have them anyway. I was planning to add frozen mixed veggies in their place, but the soup was good with all the other veggies already. Oh, and I didn't have celery seed, so I used a little celery salt instead. Thanks for a good recipe.

I didn't read ahead and didn't realize this was a slow cooker recipe - I made it on the stove top - simmered with canned carrots rather than fresh and 1 can of sliced potatoes - added Tony Chacere's seasoning - served with corn bread and it was great! Husband loved it and had left overs!

This is a great soup but I might make some changes next time I make it. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular, but the soup was too sweet. Also, there wasn't a whole lot of flavor. I will add more herbs next time.

This is almost exactly like my soup, I call Hamburger Soup.  I too use whatever I have.  The only difference I see is I use more fresh celery and leave out the celery seed.  I also use Sweet Basil instead of Bay leaves.  I don't like bay.  You can use 3 or 4 bouillon cubes with water instead of the beef broth.  Just be sure to taste it for saltiness after each Boullion cube is added.  They are salty but handy to have on hand in the cupboard.   Add salt very last thing or another bouillon cube instead.  Chicken or beef bouillon works great.  This is my go to recipe when I'm in the mood for soup or it's cold outside.  I also like to add some bell pepper at the beginning  and yellow squash (frozen or fresh) at the end so it doesn't get cooked to pieces.   I'm sure you will add the veggies you like and whatever that is, it will come out great with this basic recipe.

I make this but instead to make it more of a "Hobo Soup" I buy 2-3 cans of mixed vegetables and 1 chopped onion and minced garlic and 1-2 cans of chopped tomatoes (not stewed tomatoes they are too sweet) and add the broth or instant bouillon and add the ground beef raw and place all this in a crockpot or stock pot and just like the hobo would do-all in 1 pot. Add the spices according to taste or just rely on the ones in the canned veges.  quick and easy and very economical!

I was excited to make this recipe and I did it exactly as written . However we found it bland. I love the good mix of ingredients and if I make it again I would add more seasoning maybe soy and Worcester like some others suggested.

Feeling like we were coming down with something,I decided to make this soup. I made it on the stovetop instead of slow cooker. It was exactly what the doctor ordered. Jam  packed full of veggies, yum! I served this with French bread. Delicious soup, and easy to adapt to stovetop! Next time I will use the slow cooker. Hubby really liked this one too!

Very good soup. I took other reviewers' suggestions and subbed stew meat for ground, frozen veggies for canned, used Italian tomatoes, added seasonings (Italian herbs, Worcestershire, soy, Tony C). Also added sea salt since I used unsalted stock. After browning, just threw all in crock pot for 6-8 hours on low. Toward end I cooked 1/2 cup barley separately and added that. Best veggie-beef soup I have made so far.

This is hands down the best soup recipe i have ever gotten off this site. It is delicious, nutritious, easy, filling and pretty good calorically. I added about 28 ounces of water to the 32 ounces of broth to make it a little soupier, along with a tsp. of salt and 1/2 tsp. black pepper. I have made it many, many times, and usually add a jalepeno pepper (left whole but with 2 slits cut in it) when browning the onions, etc. And then remove the jalepeno before adding the potatoes, etc.. It gives the soup a nice flavor.

I gave the receipe 5 stars because I am not a soup eater...however this soup has changed my mind. Although I did not follow the directions directly...it's the type of receipe that doesnt have to be. As many of the reviews said you will need some extra beef broth. I also added some Mrs. Dash & black pepper. I could not find celery seed but I had the fresh celery and celery flakes. Also, I had some left over ground beef already cooked so I omitted making the ground beef mixture on the stove, I just added everything to the crockpot set it to 10hrs and went to bed..I used frozen veggies vs can and they were not soggy but nice and crisp once the soup was complete.

This is a recipe that has similar ingredients of a stew my mother used to make, except she made the ground beef mixture into meatballs. I tweeked this recipe to match the one she used to make. I sauteed the garlic, onion, and 1/3 cup of chopped green bell pepper, until soft and the onions were translucent. Than I mixed up the ground beef with one egg, in a large plastic bag with a zipper. I kneaded the mixture, until the egg was combined with the ground beef. I added the sauteed garlic, onion, and bell pepper, and kneaded it all together until it was all mixed in well. I browned the meatballs in a little olive oil, just until browned. I finished cooking the meatballs in the can stewed tomatoes. The recipe is the same from here on. Taste just like my mom's...well almost! :)

This soup made lots and is a good way of working vegetables into your diet. I used frozen vegs. instead of the canned ones. The only thing I would change is add some seasoning as it is a little bit bland.

I made this in my Slow cooker and made a few changes.  Used celery Salt instead of the Celery Seed, added a packet of the Swanson Beef Flavor for extra flavor (had used 3 bouliion cubes before but was better with the Flavor packet) Another thing that really picked it up was I added a small head of Cabbage to it ..   Really Great tasting.

I give it 5 because the base flavor was really good and you could play around with the vegetable choices and ingredients to suit your own tastes. Unfortunately I had to throw it together in a pot instead of slow cooker but the flavor was still there. While the potatoes were cooking I added some rice and instead of green beans and peas I used spinach. It ended up being a really hearty and healthy meal.

A good meal on a cold winter's night. Next time I will either dice the potato small instead of medium, more probably add them (diced med) with the carrots as they didn't get quite tender enough for us. Also, I paid attention to the reviews and agreed there needed to be more flavor so I added Italian seasoning, crushed thyme, kosher salt, and cracked black pepper. I also felt I could have used more beef broth, but didn't have any so I used vegetable juice, knowing this was a great variance from the original recipe, but it worked well. One last tip - use a sachet (tied cheesecloth bag) for the bay leaves to make them easier to fish out at the end.

Wonderful soup!  I followed exactly but did add a little salt and pepper to the finished soup. Made homemade biscuits to serve with this and I will be making this again.  Thanks KA187 for submitting this recipe.

This was delicious.  Was an easy way to get my son to eat his veggies.  Great with cornbread.

I have received rave reviews on this one. I do add more beef broth to mine, less carrots and no peas. I have made it with hamburger and stew meat. Both are good.

This was really good and hearty!  I'll have to use this in Fall and Winter!  I did make some subs based on what I had at home today. I used ground turkey and chicken broth instead of beef.  I also threw in Mrs. Dash in place of parsley and celery seed. For the tomatoes, I used Trader Joe's fire-roasted diced tomatoes and they provided a nice kick. 

I also subbed the green beans for frozen spinach, and used only one potato. Next time, I will try with two potatoes, as per recipe. 

Can't wait to make this again. Super easy!

 It would go well with warm, crusty bread.  Next time!

I have been making this soup for years, but never got the flavoring right - it still tasted like ground beef and vegetables.  Then I added a couple of teaspoons of Italian seasoning, and that did it!  I gave it more flavor, but didn't make it taste like spaghetti sauce.  I do leave out the celery as I am not fond of the flavor, and used frozen mixed veggies.  Inexpensive and filling.

I was looking forward to this soup. I am from the Midwest and love comfort foods. However, this was bland. Kids thought it was OK, but not worth making again.

It needed flavor enhancers...I used worchestire and pepper, and I thickened it up a bit... but it was good after that.

I make a big batch and portion it out to freeze so I can grab and go for lunch. I limit the types of veggies  to just corn, because the beans and carrots just don’t freeze and reheat well. I LOVE this stew and make it several times a year.

I followed the directions, but after four hours in the  slow cooker, the potatoes were still hard so I transferred the soup to the stovetop for about a half an hour. It tasted somewhat bland so I added extra salt, pepper, garlic power, onion flakes, a can of tomato soup and a sprinkle of sugar.  I will make, this again--it 's makes a boat load of soup,  but I will doctor it up with more seasoning for additional flavor.

I have also made this on the stove top and simmered it for 2 hours. Absolutely delicious! Instead of stewed tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes from a can and used frozen vegetables and real carrots and Potosi.

Really good soup! I added more broth and some tomato juice to cover the vegetables.  I also used stew beef rather than the ground beef.  Next time I'll try the ground beef.  We will definitely have it again.

I used fresh corn and left out canned veggies.  Also used venison instead of beef.  Finished product with fresh bread was delicious meal.  Also cooked potatoes right in with carrots.  Saved time.

Good, but too plain for my taste. I even added in a little buffalo steak cut up in small pieces and extra garlic, basil and oregano.

Great recipe!  Made 2 changes.. used 1 cup of tomato sauce and one cup of water to replace stewed tomatoes and omitted celery seed.  It was delicious!  I'll be making this often. ??

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if possible.  It was good but as others said, it does lack something.  I took suggestions such as adding additional onion, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, beef bouillon but it still missed something.  I also used frozen veggies as I cannot tolerate canned.  What I may do next time is to serve it very thick and spoon over mashed potatoes kind of a Shepherd's pie dish.  It is very hardy though but once I tweak it to figure out that little extra that's needed, it will be a keeper for sure!

This was so good.  It got a  little cold outside and this really hit the spot.  I love the flavors in it.  I did take the bay leaves out after I cooked the carrots and added some basil and a small amount of oregano and this really gave it some more flavor.
