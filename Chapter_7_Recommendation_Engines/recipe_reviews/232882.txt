Very rich!  So yummy. A popular request when I bake for birthdays. The ingredient list includes 3/4 C cocoa powder but it is not included in the recipe?? Leave it out. I made the recipe with it and without. If you add it to the flour mixture the batter is too thick and takes longer to cook and is more like a muffin texture (I make the recipe into cupcakes)
