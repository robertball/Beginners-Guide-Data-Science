This cake is awesome!  This was the first time I made this cake, so I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1/4 cup butter and 2/3 cup evaporated milk.  The filling was the perfect consistency.  I made the cake on Friday afternoon, frosted it Friday night and refrigerated it overnight.  I took it out of the fridge around 5pm and served it at about 8pm and it was wonderful.  Also, I melted the caramels, evaporated milk and butter in a glass bowl in the microwave at 100% power for about 4 minutes, stirring after every minute or so. Thanks for a great recipe.  It's definitely a keeper!

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!  I took this cake to work for a co-workers birthday, it was a HIT!  I used the recommendation of the 1/4 cup butter and 2/3 cup evaporated milk in the caramel sauce and it turned out wonderfully.  To quote a co-worker, "This is definitely a recipe to share" and share it I will!

Added 4/15/05:
I shortcutted this recipe this time to decent results.  German chocolate cake mix and made per directions.  Instead of making the caramel sauce, I used caramel ice cream topping.  Then I used "Pour and Frost" icing for the cake instead of making the described icing.  Decoreated and made a ring around the edges with leftover choco chips and pecans.  VERY RICH but very good and gooey!

This cake is awesome.  I didn't change any ingredients, but if you melt caramel mixture before backing first layer, it will cool and thicken slightly while first layer bakes, stopping it from pooling to the edges.  Also, I found that if you sprinkle the pecans and chocolate chips first and then pour caramel mixture on top, this too will help with caramel pooling at edges.

This is a great recipe.  I have now made it twice.  The second time I used less butter in the filling and a little more milk (1/4 c. butter, 2/3 c. evaporated milk).  The caramel filling seemed a little thicker which is better.  The cake was even better the second day.  The hard part is keeping my family from eating it all the first day - it is delicious.

I made this for my husband's birthday and am getting ready to make it again!  He LOVED it!  It is delicious!  I did read the reviews and used a little more evap. milk and a little less butter.  This is an awesome recipe and I will make it again and again! (Note: this recipe calls for 14 OUNCES of caramels NOT 14 caramels!)

Wonderful recipe.  Has become a big hit at my house and office. The first time I made it some of the caramel filling dripped in the oven and caused it to smoke.  Now when I put the cake in to bake the second time around I set it on a large swiss roll pan, increase the temperature to 360 and bake for 25 minutes instead of 20. Turns out perfect and no messy oven.

I made this for a coworker's birthday, and it was a hit. Several people asked for the recipe and I was happy to direct them here! I wonder if this could be made with an 8-inch round cakepan? Presentation was the only area where the cake seemed to be lacking.

Wonderful cake and is even better the second day which is great if your having a party and want to try and get some stuff done ahead of time. I did use 1/4 cup butter and 2/3 cup evaporated milk, worked perfect. Also used one of those "whipped" frostings in the can (chocolate)and that worked well too. As I said before don't worry about making it a day ahead, it's great..........

I forgot to add the pecans and chocolate chips on top of the caramel mixture so I mixed pecans into the frosting instead.  It turned out to be very tasty.  I brought it to a birthday party and it was well received by everyone.  I found it very rich  - so no need to make serving sizes large.

Good in theory but the carmel mixture runs all over and trying to add half the cake batter on top just makes a mess.  It doesn't cover the cake and mixes with the carmel.  Pre baking half the cake for 15 minutes then the carmel and other half the batter baking for another 20 just makes for a burned cake on the bottom and a gooey, half baked cake on the top.  It got one star because I couldn't give it a negative one.  I am an experienced baker and sell cookies as a side business, so it's not that I don't know what I'm doing.

THIS.IS.INCREDIBLE!
I followed the suggestions from other reviewers, topped with caramel sauce, chocolate sauce and leftover pecans, and the cake turned out absolutely perfect. I have absolutely no complaints. It was SUPER rich, so eat it with a glass of milk :) 
Everyone who tasted it asked for the recipe, and I'll definitely be using this recipe for years to come! USE IT!

OUCH!  I was in a hurry and didn't take the time to read the other reviews (shame on me).  What a lesson to be learned.  I made it just the way it was written and the caramel floated to the edges.  It was still soooooo tastey and I will definitely make this again with the revised version...less butter and more evaporated milk.

This is very good and very rich.  I used the caramel bits, (found in baking isle), so that eliminated the unwrapping.  However they are only 11 oz. not 14 oz.  So I used 2-1/2 TBSP butter, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 1/2 cup of evaporated milk to melt the caramels in the microwave.  I nuked for 3-1/2 min. at 70% power.  That way the caramel thickens.  Do try the evaporated milk as it intensifies the caramel flavor.  I thought the chocolate frosting too sweet so I upped the chocolate to 1/2 cup of bitter-sweet chocolate chips.  I thought it was very decadent, and I would be proud to serve this to family and friends.  Thank you for sharing your lovely recipe, K. Casler.

My family loved this recipe. The only thing that I did was do 1.5 times the caramel and 3/4 cup evaporated milk. I also did 1.5 cups of pecans. Everyone loved it. Even my mother in law said "Small Children should not watch my reaction to this cake." It was awesome!

Very good but not excellent or amazing. I had no problems getting rid of this at my party -- it was moist, had a decent texture, and I love chocolate. But I wanted more caramel flavor. I went with the suggested modification and regret doing so because I think the texture was off. But either way, I don't think 14 caramels was enough for this cake. I also wasn't thrilled with the icing. It was good, but not great. I am going to keep looking for that out of this world cake.

My daughter and I were looking up cake recipes and she opted we go with chocolate vs. spice...so we looked and found this recipe and thought it sounded good...it was great!  I didn't have German Chocolate Cake Mix on hand, but had the Butter Rich Chocolate Mix instead and it turned out pretty good...rich, but good none the less.  My husband said that the German Chocolate Cake Mix would have probably made it less sweet.  Either way it was yummy :o).  I didn't feel like making the icing and thought the cake was good with out the icing.  I will definately make it again (with German Chocolate Cake Mix next time!).  Enjoy!!

I don't have a German chocolate cake mix available in our place so what I did is I made my own chocolate cake from scratch. I substituted the caramels with a home made one since I didn't want to go the market (1 can condensed milk submerge it onto the water and boil for 3 hours, make sure it's submerged so refill the water every now and then). It came out great also! I scratched some of the items in the ingredient list (caramels, butter and evaporated milk) I used walnuts instead (that's the only available nut in the pantry haha) This is really really good it come out perfectly moist and rich at the center :)

Excellent cake! I took a reviewer's advice and used one jar of Mrs. Richardson's Caramel ice cream topping instead of making the sauce, and it was fab. I definitely recommend this recipe! It's great served with vanilla ice cream.

Made this cake over the weekend, when i poured the caramel mixture over the cake it went all around the edges. When I tasted the cake there was no caramel to be found anywhere on this cake. It tasted like a plain chocolate cake with nuts.

FANTASTIC!  I made this cake for the very first time (with the suggested modifications) and it was a huge hit with the birthday party crowd.  It is definitely a favorite that will be repeated many times in the future.  One additional modification I made was to use Chocolate Fudge Cake Mix instead of German Chocolate for a more chocolately turtle cake.  It turned out well.  I'm so glad I found this recipe!

A chocolate lovers dream!  This cake was a little too rich for me and I would probably eliminate the chocolate chips next time. I did not have enough carmel (only 6 oz) and will add more next time. I made my cake a double tiered cake which required me to double the frosting ingredients (which is a very good frosting recipe)and I would suggest you use a mixer to whip up the frosting.  Don't forget to add the ingredients (eggs, oil, butter) from the cake box to your grocery list - luckily I had enough eggs to make the cake!

This was a hit for my mother’s birthday. I followed the tip regarding 1/4 butter and 2/3 c evaporated milk in the caramel sauce and I melted it in the microwave for 3 minutes, stirring after every minute. At first I thought it was way too thin, but as I continued stirring as it cooled it darkened in color and thickened. I thought it odd to bake half then top and then pour the rest of the batter on the top, but it worked since I used a 9x13 pan as suggested.

Very yummy! Would advise to start the carmel mixture first so you have plenty of time to get it melted and combined well.

I love this recipe, it's so easy to make. If you're after something wickedly good and very bad for you then this is for you. I'm in Australia and we don't have german choc cake packet mix, so I opted for Betty Crocker's Devil's Food Cake. It turned out fantastically. And for Aussie's out there I used Pascall's Columbine caramels with less butter and less evaporated milk. As for corn syrup, I used "Glucose Syrup", apparently derived from corn so just check out your local supermarket in the "Cake aisle", its a clear, very thick and comes in a jar. I would recommend using a good quality dark chocolate for the frosting.

This may be the best cake I've ever eaten!  It was so rich and moist, and the flavors remind me of wonderful turtle candy.

Excellent, sinfully delicious!  I followed the suggestions from other reviews to use less butter and evaporated milk.  I will definitely make this again.

Question: the pic from Earnesta shows a lovely dome. The recipe says to bake in a 9X13. How do you get the dome effect? Also confused about baking batter on top of a baked cake, how does that work? Thanks for the tips.

I made this for my husband's b'day and it turned out wonderful!  I made the changes to the butter and evaporated milk that others had suggested and it was perfect.  Rich and Delicious!

a bit too much frosting, but I couldve stopped instead of using it all :).  Other then that it was rich and very tasty.  Everyone at the party loved it.

This cake was really good! The only problem I had was that the cake baked with a curve so the caramel sauce pooled in the corners and the edges and was sparce in the middle. Other than that, very good! Also the icing was a hit. My husband insists that I use it on my brownies.
