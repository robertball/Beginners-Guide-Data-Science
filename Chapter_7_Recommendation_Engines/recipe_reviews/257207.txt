Definitely a keeper.  Made it in a loaf pan. Very light and moist texture.  Just added a little nutmeg.

Mine turned out amazing! Made it according to the recipe and just added some walnuts to the muffins. So delish! And scented up the house with the best baked bread aroma!

Great recipe. Delicious and moist. Not a nut fun so just left those out. Bread pan bake took 50 mins in electric oven.

It was delicious!  I add a cup of chopped black walnuts. I also used 4 ounces of vegetable oil instead of the butter and only used 1/2 cup of applesauce. I used a teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. I made it in a large loaf pan and cooked it for 70 minutes. It was so moist and my husband and I loved it!

They live up to the name.  These were terrific and I’ll be making again, for sure.  I used 3 large bananas, but didn’t measure. I used half of the quantity of white sugar, since I was using sweetened applesauce and I’m glad I did as they were perfect for us.

These were well loved by my family. I made with gluten free flour and they were light, fluffy and moist. I did have to bake longer than the recipe states, it took 25-30 minutes.

Super moist. Made a dozen regular size muffins and 18 mini muffins. The grandkids added a few white chocolate chips. 

I did bake them longer then the recipe called for. Will definitely make these again.

I've made this several times, and even with changes, it comes out delicious!   I've only made loafs rather than muffins. Some alternate changes... add 1 handful of walnuts.  I've added a dash of clove, allspice & nutmeg, and it was sooo good.  I rarely use applesauce because I have a ton of homemade apple butter that I have on hand.  Anyway, this is a winner of a apple banana cake.

The muffins tasted amazing and one thing we would add is some more banana because we barely tasted it.

Made these for my little guy who loves them! A great finger food snack! Substituted the butter for more apple sauce (1 1/4 cups total or 3 of those snack sized ones because that’s what I had left in my fridge lol!) 

The batch made 24 mini’s and 9.5 regular muffins. Super moist, delicious and I was able to clean out my fridge a little!

I made a 1/2 recipe - very good!  I added 3 T melted butter and 1 spoon of sour cream (I always have to change up recipes).  I also added a couple of spoonfuls of granola.  I didn't add as much cinnamon as the recipe - it was all good!
