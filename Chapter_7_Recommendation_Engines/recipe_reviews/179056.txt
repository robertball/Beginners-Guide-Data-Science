This was so good!  The only change I made was the plum tomatoes.  I didnt have any so I used a small can of diced tomatoes (drained).

Simply delicious! I made this for a ladies lunch. Not many of us like zucchini so I substituted a bit of fresh spinach for it. (Though you should add the spinach late, for around five minutes of cooking time to retain its freshness.) I also added a sprig of fresh rosemary since I had it on hand. The soup was an instant hit! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This one's a keeper! I might omit zucchini next time, it got too soggy... maybe just cut them thicker

Loved this, tho’ I did improvise somewhat (and once I tinkered with it a 5-star soup). I detested carrots as a kid and still do – and I detest the sweetness they lend to stocks and soups, so I left them out.  I didn’t cook the celery and onion in the broth itself, but instead sweated them in some olive oil and added minced garlic.  For the broth I preferred beef to chicken for its heartier flavor, and I just happened to have some homemade in the freezer that I had made with the bones of a prime rib roast – and the bits of beef in it were nice in this soup.  I omitted the thyme, and frankly used no other seasoning than a good glug of red wine and a finish of freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano at the end.  Sure, additional or different vegetables could be used, but I enjoyed the simplicity of just the zucchini and plum tomatoes (if you can’t find red-ripe ones, DO use a good canned tomato instead for best flavor).  I had the cutest little teeny squash-filled ravioli (from Italy) and used that instead of the tortellini.  As for the beans, I used the more fitting, in my humble opinion, cannellini beans (white kidney beans) rather than the red.  This was excellent and unbelievably prepared in the time it took to boil the pasta.

This was very tasty! I substituted one bag of mixed frozen soup vegetables for all the veggies listed, and didn't add tomatoes. I also added fresh spinach and Italian seasoning. I made it for a "soup day" at work and it was all gone in 20 minutes!

Made just as written. It was quite tasty but missing a bit of zing. I think some ground mild Italian sausage would add the kick it is missing. I added white pepper to my servings and that helped a bit. Very hearty and comforthing!  One hint--I cook the tortellini in a separate pot--that helps it from absorbing so much of the broth.

This soup sure puts the one I made last time to shame.  My tortellini soup was basically broth and torts.  The beans give it a nice pasta-fazooool taste to it.  I had no celery.  I had no onions.  I DID have bell peppers, which gave it the celery crunch, and I had onion flakes.  I also added the rosemary, and  basil, and oregano.  Couldn't help myself.  You could smell it all the way upstairs.  Mmmmm.  Hearty.

This was wonderful!  I didn't have thyme, so I added some italian seasoning, orageno, garlic salt, salt and pepper (all to taste).  I also included a pound of italian turkey sausage.  It was amazing!

My husband likes one dish meals, I like easy to make meals, so this really made both of us happy! I couldn't find decent tomatoes, so used a cup of canned, diced.   I will definitely make this a regular for us.  C39r49

This was so good my 8 yr old son ate 2 bowls! I did have to make some changes based on what i had. I used frozen peas and carrots. Added leaks and bite size pieces of cooked chicken breasts. This is a keeper!

I just made this dish tonight for dinner for myself and my mother, and in short the entire house helped us to eat this. It was so flavorful! If only I had known, I would have made a double batch. The next time I make this I will lessen the kidney beans. I just learned that I don't really care for them. I did add some fresh spinach to the soup as I read from another AR cook that it was a nice addition, she was right. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken as I am transitioning to a vegetarian lifestyle. ;)

I didn't follow the recipe exact and I usually don't rate them if I do this but I was close enough to it that I can give my opinion.  I used italian seasoning instead of thyme, no kidney beans but added chicken for protein, 1 can diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and no zucchini.  I sauted the onion with the garlic and celery first to mix flavors then added the other ingredients.  It was a good pretty quick dinner.  Adding the cooked chicken I think enhanced it to be a heartier meal.

Did I do something wrong? I followed the recipe exactly and it was so bland except the tortellini itself.  Perhaps a different broth could have helped, but I used a lower sodium healthy one like the one in the recipe. Very disappointed... :(

Very delicious!  I just made a couple changes.  I didn't put zuchini in it because I simply don't like it.  I added a can of tomatoe sauce for a heartier broth.  I also added a couple of boiled chicken breasts.  It was so delicious!

Very good soup. Instead of zucchini, I added steamed broccoli right before serving. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of red pepper to give it some more flavor.

This recipe is delicious! it was my first time making soup from scratch and it turned out wonderful. A great hearty soup for the fall. A couple of things I changed was I used Italian seasoning instead of thyme and tiny tri-colour heirloom tomatoes instead of plum. I would definitely make this again!

I found it needed more broth than the recipe called for. Used organic veggie broth instead of chicken broth. One daughter and I thought it was worth 5 stars, the other daughter thought 4 stars, and my husband said 3 stars because it didn't have any meat. He used to be OK eating a vegetarian meal once a week (I am vegetarian and he isn't) but maybe not any more. Next time, I will slice up some Italian sausage to put in his. Thanks!

It was very bland without the tortellini. I added cooked ground beef mixed with 1 chopped onion & 2 chopped stocks of celery sauteed. Five minutes before end of cooking time 1 can corn niblets and 1 cup frozen peas. What a difference.

This was really enjoyed by the adults that ate it, but not by the children. They couldn't get past the zucchini in the soup, so they ended up eating the lentil soup I had made for me. (I am a vegetarian).  The only change I made was to substitute cubed chicken for the kidney beans. ( I thought the kidney beans would turn off the children) All in all a great recipe that was loved by all the adults who tried it. Will definitely make again.

this soup was soooo good.  I made a few changes the second time around and I loved it this way... I used 8 C. chicken broth, I left out the zucchini and added 3 hot Italian sausage (casing's removed and it was very spicy, so if you don't like spicy use some sweet sausage for the hot) and added fresh spinach when there was only 5 minutes of cook time left...DELICIOUS!!

Very delicious and healthy.  omitted the tomatoes and only used one zucchini.  Doubled the broth for lots of yummy soup, and threw in some cooked, crumbled Italian sausage for more flavor.  A keeper!

I have been looking for a similar recipe for years. It was a favorite recipe when my kids were growing up but lost my cookbook with the recipe and forgot about it! I can't wait to make it for dinner. Thanks for sharing it again.

I cooked turkey italian sausage into small pieces before the first step. I omitted (because I didn't have them) zucchini and celery. Very easy to make!

A nice, simple soup. The only changes I made were to leave out the celery (didn't have it) and saute the onion, carrot, tomato, and garlic in some olive oil before adding the broth.  I had gorgeous tomatoes and that really helped with the flavor, and a sprinkling of Parmesan was just the right finishing touch.  Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this soup.  I don't know about anyone else but I had to add 4 more cups chicken broth that I just made from bullion.

This is so easy and tasty and - on top of that - it has to be healthy, too, with all those vegetables.  This is definitely a winner.

This is a great recipe for eating healthy. My boyfriend hates "diet food" so I made this without telling him it was low cal and low fat. He LOVED it! And so did I. Will definately be making this again and again. And it is so easy!

Really good.  Served to my girlfriend at lunch, then my husband for supper -- will definitely make again.  Had some fresh spinach which needed using so tossed that in along with a handful of fresh mushrooms.  Would have been great without any changes though.

I made this last night and it was excellent. I forgot to buy the Roma tomatoes so I used a couple of cans of diced. Next time I will try it with the Romas. Only other difference was I left out the kidney beans- had enough veggies in it already. Very flavorful soup and will def make again!

This was the first soup I ever made and it turned out really well!  My mistake, though, I didn't look at exactly how much tortellini to add (I used trader joe's dried tortellini) and after adding the tortellini to everything else that was in there, there was no more "soup" in the pot!  So I had to add two more cups of chicken broth and two cups of water (just because the sodium content was going to be too much for me).  Also, I used two stalks of celery that must have been off some giant stalk because there was a lot of them in there.  I didn't use zucchini or plum tomatos (husband doesn't care for them) either.  Despite all my mishaps while making it, it was FANTASTIC and my husband finished his large bowl of soup with lots of "mmmmmmmmmms" and "delicious baby!"
