I love that you use toasted sesame seeds as an addition to this salad! Personally didn't care for using lemon juice for the dressing instead of the traditional rice vinegar or substitute of white wine vinegar so in the future for a touch of lemon flavor for others who might want it will serve garnished with a lemon wedge. Oh, to save peeling time I used English cucumbers which have a very nice thin skin :-)

This was oddly addictive. I loved the toasted sesame seeds and it went well with the mild cucumber flavor. I used baby seedless cucumbers and sliced them with a mandoline slicer. I skipped step 1 and didn't peel or deseed and simple sliced them. I didn't let them sit salted first. No, I just tossed the dressing with the sliced cucumbers and tossed in the sesame seeds and let this sit in the refrigerator for two days before eating it. I loved this! I thought it needed something a little more though like onion to take this up a notch. It is a solid recipe as written though. I did cut this down to use 2 cucumbers and it made plenty for 2 servings. This had a sweet and tangy flavor. A little sour but not really. More mild and really really good. I'll happily fix this again.

This was wonderful!  I wasn't sure about the lemon juice, but it truly was different and refreshing.  We did miss the onion and pepper in our normal recipe, but this was a change in a very good way!

Very good. I like to make it with some sliced onion, use rice vinegar, add some shrimp or some lump crab meat.

We thought this was a nice mix of sweet and tart. I used rice wine vinegar and it worked out nicely. I would recommend this as a side salad or an afternoon lunch!

Delicious.   I use food processor to slice the cukes.  Only hard part is squeezing out the water.
