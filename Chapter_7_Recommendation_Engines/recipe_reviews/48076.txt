My family has enjoyed this recipe for a long time.I usually use Uncle Ben's wild rice mix. I have also added green or purple onion, feta or provolone or mozzarella cheese. This is one of those recipes that you can get really creative with. We love it.

This was just ok.  I would not make it again, it was certainly easy, I would add more spinach and tomatos like the other reviewer said.

I really did not like this.  If you make it, I would not add all the spinach that it says.  Maybe add more tomatoes??

Delicious!  I used a whole bag of spinach, extra tomatoes and doubled the amount of dressing put into the rice.  Will experiment with other kinds of rice and veggies.
