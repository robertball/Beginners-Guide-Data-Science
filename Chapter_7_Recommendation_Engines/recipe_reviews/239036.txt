I enjoyed this dish! The orange-herbed butter was pretty light and a refreshing compliment to the salmon. After marinating, I broiled it the 5 mins time and it was very moist! However, I couldn't escape the albumin that formed on the side of the salmon. I basted the cooked salmon afterwards with some of the butter I melted down with the juice and then I also topped it off with a dollop of the remaining butter mixture that I had set side and didn't melt down. What can I say - I love butter! I would definitely make this again, but will most likely play around with making the salmon skin extra crispy for more texture to this recipe.

I wasn't a huge fan of this.  While it was easy to make and fairly quick, it was just a little on the bland side for me.

With no fresh herbs on hand, I shook a bit of dried thyme on each piece of salmon, then marinated in the OJ.  I don't quite get why the recipe calls for making 3T of herbed butter, when you're only going to use 2t after the fish is cooked...  Anyway, I used half the amount of dried herbs in the butter, then spread about a teaspoon on the fish before and after broiling.  I believe this helped give more flavor.
