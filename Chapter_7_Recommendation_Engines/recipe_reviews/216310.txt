I give it 4 stars because the time in the recipe was way off and the chicken, tho cooked through after adding about 20 minutes, was very tough and chewy. Next time(there will be a next time as the flavors were wonderful) I think I will either cube the chicken or cut in strips. It also could be pounded flat, then the cooking times would be correct. That said, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. By the way, this could be cookied in the oven or crockpot and the flavors would even be better, I think.

Very good, easy recipe.  Chicken cooked in a skillet comes out perfectly and juicy in 10 minutes.  You have to heat the pan to high with the oil, throw the chicken in and cover the skillet.  Cook 5 minutes each side.  It will be done through if properly thawed.

This was absolutely delicious!  I did not have olives but will use them next time and I did not use oregano because my kids don't like it, but the sauce was soo good and very low fat.  This is one of my new favorite recipes!

Very good. I actually grilled pounded down chicken breasts and added them to the skillet for about 5 minutes (simmering). I also had some strips of poblano chiles that I needed to use, so, I tossed those into the mixture as well. The blurb by Campbell's states "sun dried tomatoes" --- and recipe calls for diced plum tomatoes....hmmmm...also, it doesn't seem to accept any other photos. Might be a Campbell recipe deal

Good flavor.  My chicken was also too chewy.  Next time I will keep the chicken separate from the sauce and see how it turns out.

this dish has great flavor! I used chicken strips instead of whole breasts and a can of diced tomatoes drained instead of the roma.  The meal cooked quick and was very easy to make.

Pretty good. The chicken took longer than what was listed but wasn't an issue. Used plum tomatoes (vs the description by Campbells' day sun-dried). I think the kalamata olives provide a strong flavor so make sure you like before you add. I did get the reduced fat Cream of Chicken but will try to use that next time since to lower the fat amount. Makes ALOT of sauce - not sure if you can freeze so be prepared to either toss or have extra for a few days. Will make it again!!

Very good! Followed the recipe exactly, except I used chicken broth instead of water, and a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Also, I used 1.5 lb. of meat, but this dish makes alot of sauce, so you could even use 2 lb. of meat, and still be fine.

This was an absolutely fantastic recipe; I seared the chicken in a pan before baking and I didn't have any kalamata olives but the recipe is perfect as is.

My crew just isn't big on too much balsamic, which this seems to have.  I thought it was okay.

I made this as directed, and we will be making it again in our house. I didn't think the recipe was as tasty as it sounded. I thought it was going to be a 4, but I rate the taste a 3. My husband on the other hand thought it was going to taste like a 3, but he rates it a 4. All in all it's a 3.5 for us!

We very much enjoyed this Greek inspired dinner with it's creamy twist.  Good flavor and very easy and for us it made us of ingredients that we almost always have on hand.

Tasted like a dinner made with canned soup. It was quick and easy, but neither I nor my husband thought it had much flavor.

I and my guests loved this, and didn't think it was blah at all! I did make some changes, though. I sliced the chicken into smaller pieces and cooked it by itself in the skillet until it was only a little pink in the middle, then put it into a glass baking dish and covered it with the vinegar/soup mix. I used 2 Tbsp regular balsamic vinegar and 1 Tbsp cinnamon pear balsamic to give it more flavor. I added sliced cherry tomatoes to the dish (skipped the olives) and baked it at 350 for about 10 minutes. When it came out, I topped it with mozzarella cheese and served it with orzo and rosemary sweet potato wedges. I would definitely suggest trying with an infused balsamic!

Yummy and easy.  The kalamata olives really MAKE this recipe so don't skip those or it might be bland. I added salt and Spike spices and used chicken broth instead of water. I added asperagus in the last 4 minutes.

Made it several times at Oporto - Careful with the quantity of balsamico, 'cause too much will eventually fade out any other taste there is.

This was very easy and had an excellent flavor! My kids even loved it and they really don't like chicken breasts. I served it over some leftover angel hair pasta from another meal and a side salad.

This recipe was just as awesome as it was easy.  I followed other reviews and diced the chicken before cooking it and tossed it with penne pasta instead of orzo.  I will definitely be making this again!!
