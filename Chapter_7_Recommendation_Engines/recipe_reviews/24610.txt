Fun recipe.  I had just bought a huge bag of "just add water" pancake mix from my warehouse store and wanted to find some other way to use it up.  I heated up my electric fryer to 350 degrees F.  I added a few teaspoons of spicy powdered seasoning until the mix was slightly pink (I used Old Bay, but I have tried Cajun, Curry, and Seasoned salt and pepper too.  I dredge chunks of food in the dry mix and set aside.  I then mix a little beer into the dry mix to make a thin batter, re-dip the food in it, and then drop them gently one at a time into the hot oil.  I fry until the food floats and turns deep golden brown.  The oil stays clear because the batter sticks to the food, holds up really well to heat and complements a variety of flavors.  Try it with chunks of chicken, seafood, eggplant, carrots, onion rings, squash, bell peppers, cheese stuffed jalapenos, peapods, green beans, hot dogs, broccoli, cauliflower, etc.

I felt that this recipe required some seasoning so I added my usual garlic and onion powders, a special blend of bread dipping spices, hot sauce and I replaced the liquid with beer. Even though I dressed this up a bit, I'm still giving this recipe five stars because using pancake mix is ingenious. I used Bisquick. I also floured my onions first to help the batter adhere. For those who mentioned that their onions were greasy probably did not have the oil at the right temp. It should be about 350 degrees. A simple candy thermometer will help with that. My family loves onion rings but rarely orders them in a restaurant because they hate how the onion always slides out from the coating. Amazingly, this did not happen (maybe due to the flour coating) and my gang said that these were the best rings they had ever eaten. Can't thank you enough "T"!

This batter was really good. I coated the rings in the dry pancake batter to start with and then put them aside. Then I used 1 cup of beer in place of the liquid and added lots of seasoned salt. Then when they came out I sprinkled with salt. The only problem was that I set the stove at med/high heat and it was way too hot. The rings became too browned after cooking only 10 seconds. Even after I turned the dial down to 4, they were coming out the same way. I had to stop frying them because my whole kitchen was filled with the smoke that was coming out from inside the pot and the smell of onion rings has still not gone away after 15 hours (and I've kept my windows open all night) I would not make these again unless I used a deep fryer.

Are there even words to express how GOOD these are? we are a family of 9 and we all loved these. I have never made onion rings before.I had a bunch of brown onions and needed to use them up.I used buttermilk pancake mix that said to mix with water, not milk.I added some salt,pepper and seasoning salt.Love at first bite.Somebody pinch me...have I ever tasted anything so good?My 12 yr old screamed when she ate these! I added too much salt to the second batch...had to throw them away...better go easy on the salt, you can always salt them when they are done. These are the bomb!

Not bad but not great. The batter coated and stayed on the onions well. This is my first time deep frying but the recipe worked well. It lacked any real flavor it tasted just like the recipe says. I liked the slightly sweet flavor but everytime I had a bite I couldn't help but think it was lacking spices. I probably won't try this *exact* recipe again but may try and "imprve" it by replacing the water with beer and adding salt, pepper and maybe some additional spices. Thanks

WOW!! I used Krusteez pancake batter and it was perfect!  It didn't even need salt.  I used the batter for french fries and that was awesome too, but with potatoes it did need some seasoning.  I will never have to order onion rings again!  Super Super Super! (Do make sure your oil is hot enough--mine got cool at one point and the rings were greasy and spongey and yuck--as soon as the oil returned to the right temp they were perfect again!)

I was so excited to see that pancake mix was used in this. I'd never thought of it and I have struggled for years to get my batter just right and now I can say NO MORE STRUGGLING. I used this recipe and added a little season-all for a spicy kick. WOO HOO.

My kind of recipe!  I used Krusteaz Buttermilk Pancake Mix that only needs water added.  Even my husband liked these and he is not usually a fan of onion rings.

These were so easy, and yet so good! I used buttermilk pancake mix, and I didn't have enough milk that the box called for, so I used evaporated milk for the rest. I also added some salt and pepper to the batter. Most of my children don't eat onions or onion rings, but they all went for these!!

I use Bisquick for pancakes.  So I used 1 Cup Bisquick 1/2 Cup milk, 1 egg, 1 tsp baking powder.  Then instead of adding vanilla like I do for pancakes, I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/8 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp black pepper.  I only used enough oil in a pan to cover and just did a few at a time after dipping in batter.  These were great!  I will try a little more spice yet, these were very puffy, because of the baking powder. Thanks for the idea.

DELICIOUS! A PERFECT '10'!  INITIALLY I USED THE DEEP-FRY BASKET TO DIP THE ONION RINGS DOWN INTO THE OIL, BUT THEN COULD'NT REMOVE THEM FROM THE BASKET DUE TO THE BATTER STICKING TO IT...BUT IT WORKED GREAT TO SIMPLY DROP THE ONION RINGS DIRECTLY INTO THE HOT OIL! a WONDERFULLY SIMPLE RECIPE! THANKS 'T'!

This recipe is too easy! They are very tasty. I would recommend that you put salt and pepper in the batter first though. I have tried many onion ring recipes, and this one tops them all!

This recipe is the first one that lead to onion rings that didn't fall apart or look just awful.  I tweaked it from the start by using an ale instead of water, 2 teaspoons of garlic salt and 2 teaspoons of Cajun spices.  After removing from the oil, I finished them off with some sea salt sprinkled on top.  Thank you so much for your recipe!

This was my first time trying onion rings in a deep fryer, and it was a success.  Thanks to other peoples additional suggestions, I would definitely advise coating in flour first and the suggestion to keep them in the oven at 225 until all are done was brilliant.  One thing to be careful of, do not make the batter too thick.  I will definitely thin it out next time, but with additional spices to taste it turned out well.

So easy.  I added a couple pinches of taco seasoning mix, a teaspoon of garlic powder and a few dashes of tabasco.  Just make sure your batter is thick enough to cover your onion.  My batter was a little too thin in the beginning so I had to add a little more batter to thicken it up.  Came out beautifully.

These are good, but very greasy. Although mine are a little uglier than the other photos, I appreciated that the batter stayed on my rings - unlike my last attempt at onion rings. Seasoning the batter is a must. If you like beer batter-type coating, you will love this recipe. Thanks!

These onion rings were gone faster than I could fry them up ... honestly, the first whole batch went in my belly while I was still cooking. 
I used pancake batter mix but substituted beer for water and added some spices - just what I came across: lemon pepper, garlic powder, paprika, ... - I don't think that there are any limits :-)
Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I LOVE onion rings, and this recipe helped me make them at home. I found that after frying them a couple seconds, and then dipping them AGAIN in the flour mixture made them better.

I am only going to rate this a 3 right now.  I used bisquick mix and I want to try it with some others before I finalize this.  I would not use it with Bisquick they did not have much flavor.  They seemed to be lacking something.  That is why am waiting to fully rate it.

You could not get any easier than this recipe.  DH was so surprised that you can use pancake mix.  I use my own home-grown onions and it all comes out perfect!

Whoda thunk? Pancake mix! I've been looking for the perfect onion rings recipe for years and here it is! I didn't quite understand the "lazy" comment. I love to cook from scratch, but I'm all about easy & delicious. I cooked these in a really heavy pan on the stove on high heat, turning them once and they came out perfect! I didn't add any seasoning, but I might play around with that next time. Thanks!

We added some hot sauce to the batter and some salt and pepper, which definately "kicked them up a notch", also 1 tsp of baking powder to "puff" them up a bit.  However, while they were really crispy, for us, they turned out really greasy, too.  I guess, when you think about it, pancakes are, well, "cakey", and these were a little like grease sponges when frying.  We'll try them again, I think.  All the other reviews are great, so maybe it was something we did wrong ??

These are good onion rings! We added all-season salt to the batter and took the advice of others that dipped their onions in the batter, then beer, then batter again before tossing them in the deepfry.  Be sure to coat them well!

I just saw this recipe and made a small batch to try it out.  I was surprised at how well pancake batter handles a deep fryer.  The wife and kids can get enough!! Needless to say I had to make a couple more batches after they sampled the first..

Thanks!

Great sweet onion ring recipe, but missing something.  I took others advice and added some seasoning.  Salt would be best, but since I don't use salt in cooking (heart healthy-ish), I used a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash origional, 1/2 tsp paprika, and 1 tsp of pepper.  Still could use something so mixed in italian flavored breadcrumbs- that was good, but still needed a bit of salt.  I also soaked the onions in beer, although I could not taste it.

Awesome batter!  It stuck well to the onions.  Of course I added some additional seasonings and a lick of salt once they were done.  Otherwise, I love this recipe

1st run I only used krusteez pancake mix, but the onion rings tasted bland. So, just like some of the other reviewers have noted, I added garlic powder, onion powder, cajun seasoning, and a little frank's red hot sauce. The onion rings were outstanding. I also didn't see a spanish onion so I used a vidalia onion. I'm juiced that I can make onion rings now. Great recipe thanks.

I usually like any kind of onion rings. I didn't like these. I went ahead and ate them so not to waste food, but my husband only ate one. :( I won't make these again.

These were extremely easy and yummy. I used Fiber One pancake mix and yellow onions instead of Spanish onions because that is what I had.  They turned put extremely well and tasted delicious!  By the way, I was a little nervous because I have never fried anything except an egg. My husband and kids also enjoyed them.  Will make this again!

Pancake batter was so clever!  I added garlic and Italian seasoning to the batter, then sprinkled the rings with seasoning salt after frying.  The sweet and salty was a nice combination and everyone raved about it.  First time frying and this was super easy!

I cooked one to taste before cooking them all.  It was a bit too 'bready' for us and a bit bland so thinned the batter a little more and added my favorite Cajun seasoning and they were better suited for our taste.  Some reviewers stated they were greasy---make sure your oil gets no lower than 350 degrees.  I usually start frying with an oil temp. of 360 degrees because the temp. will drop when adding what ever you are frying.  Be sure to not over crowd.  I always drain my fried food on a 'cookie cooling rack' with paper towel beneath supported by a cookie sheet pan; this keeps fried food crispy all around.

Great recipe. I cooked them in a deep fryer. In order to prevent them from sticking together, I only fried about 3 or 4 at a time. Also, if you set them into the deep fryer basket and then lower it into the oil, the rings will stick to the basket and make a bit of a mess. I dropped them into the oil with the basket down, and once they were fried used the basket to pull them out.

This was my first successful attempt at onion rings. It turned out pretty good too! Also, they LOOKED amazing! (Hey! Presentation plays a part also!)

I agree that these were a little greasy (but we are talking about onion rings) and a little bland. I will try this recipe again, but I will add some salt, paprika and cayenne to give the taste a little kick!

P.S. My wife said those were the best onion rings she had ever tasted!

I thought these were great.  I used Jiffy baking mix. The mix stayed on the onion very well. As soon as I took them out of the oil I added salt.  These were just as good as any restaurant.

I have never made onion rings before although I LOVE them! I made them tonight and they are fabulous!! I added about 2 tsp of pepper and the same of "season-all" to the mix. Just right! I would suggest making more batter for one onion though, I didn't finish all but half an onion and ran out of batter. Thanks T!

Works great! Be sure the oil is hot enough first, the rings should go in and out. I can't believe something that eluded and intimidated me for so long was so simple to make. Genuis recipe.

Love this quick easy recipe. I would suggest rolling the onion into dry batter then dipping it into the prepared wet batter. I used krusteaz buttermilk batter because it's my favorite that I always have on hand.

4 stars because they are so easy to make. Follow the directions and they will turn out just like in the picture. This is the most simple and guaranteed-to-work batter/deep-fry recipe I've ever tried.

I think these onion rings are missing some texture and flavour though. Kids will like them but they taste rather bland to a more discerning palate.

Rated at a 4, but a 4.5 is probably closer.  Really enjoyed this recipe.  Easy too.  My husband taught me to never make pancakes from a box, so I used the Better Homes and Gardens recipe.  (If you have never made homemade pancakes, I recommend trying it.  It's not that bad, and you find out all you are really paying for in the prepackaged stuff is flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, and possibly dehydrated milk.  Homemade is much better!)  I agree with the comments that say there is a lack of seasoning.  I will leave the sugar out the recipe next time.

They were good, but by the time I finnished cooking all of the rings, the ones I had done first became mushy. I had coated the onions in flour first otherwise the batter all came off once in the oil. Maybe If I put the completed onion rings in the oven on warm they would stay crispy, but I don't know.

I was skeptical about this recipe. It just seemed too simple. I made these for my family last night and they devoured them. My sister even said they were the best onion rings she's ever eaten!

These were great! Here are a few tips: you can throw in some spices with the sweet pancake batter, like salt, a pinch of red pepper or garlic. To get the batter to stick to your onion rings, put some dry pancake mix in a plate and, as soon as you cut your rings, dust them with the dry powder. Then, the batter will stick to them better. Make sure your oil is very hot, or your rings will get soggy! To get the coating on your ring thin (so it'll be crispy) just hold it on a fork and tap the fork a few times to get the excess off. These are easy, cheap and delicious!

I really really loved the recipe!!! I read alot of the reviews before hand and came up with an good idea on how i was going to prepare the rings. So I kinda like my rings a little sweet so I added some sugar to the batter and some seasoning salt and fried them up. They were so good and really crisp iLoved it will be using this recipe alot more.. Thanks T

good taste, i used the Krusteaz pancake mix and replaced beer for the water, also coated onion in dry mix before dipping in batter. they were a little bready i prefer a super thin crunchy onion ring. overall though very good tasting ring.

Didn't have buttermilk for my usual onions rings so I decided to give these a try because I had lots of Krusteau pancake mix.  I floured the onions before I coated them in the mixture (which I substituted beer for the water).  They were perfect!  I used two cups of the pancake mixture with 1 1/2 cups of Miller Lite beer.  This was enough to coat about 1 1/2 sweet onions (which by the way fed 8 adults with leftovers).  Will make again and again!

Great recipe, very easy.  I added water to a mix that was supposed to have milk and eggs (but I didn't have those).  It worked well anyway!
I did add seasoning.  About 3/4 tsp of salt and a dash of season salt.  
It cooked quickly, and didn't stick to the bottom of the pot.  It was crispy and slightly sweet.  Awesome.

Loved these...me and my daughter just made them. Use a large vidalia onion, used a buttermilk complete pancake mix which you only had to add water to. I did add a little salt and fresh cracked pepper to the batter. They were great! Reminded me of the onion rings served at carnivals or fairs, light crispy battered coating. Thanks!

I'm an onion ring fiend! This recipe is super easy, and when you've got your eye on the rest of the meal, these are a blessing!! I added seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper and cajun seasoning. The spices cut the "sweet" a little for those turned off by it. I also dredged the rings in cornmeal after the batter for some crunch. Even my onion-hating five-year old loved these. I've always got pancake mix and onions "lying around" and these are gonna be a staple. I'm gonna try baking some on a silpat next time to see how they turn out.

These were pretty good considering there weren't many ingredients. I added salt, pepper and a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash. My batter didn't come out as thick as some of the pictures but my husband likes them and the coating has a good texture/taste. Once cooked leave them uncovered or they will get soggy. I made the mistake of putting mine in a covered warming pan and they got "soft". We ate some beforehand so we knew how good they really were.

Great recipe, extremely simple and easy to make. I used Krusteaz which only requires water and they came out great (there maybe something special about this brand that makes these good because many others who also used Krusteaz said they were great as well). Mine didn't come out as neat as the picture, but no matter because they were delicious.

Fantastic way to make easy onion rings! I just add spices to the pancake mix (salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic) to taste and perfect! I've used this idea to bread fish as well

These were a hit! I added some seasoned salt, garlic and onion powder. My family devoured them. They were simple and too easy to make. Thanks for sharing.

We eat gluten free, so I made our favorite pancake mix King Arthur Flour Brand Gluten Free Pancake Mix (best ever found in 7 years of being gluten free) and the onion rings were awesome. A little sweet but everyone in the family enjoyed them. Thanks for the idea.

Mmmmmm!  Couldn't stop eating them.  I added seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper to the batter and they were delicious.  Loved them.  Who knew you could use instant pancake mix?  Great recipe.

I have made these a few times now and they always turn out great.   Just add some spices (garlic, salt, pepper or whatever you like) to the pankcake batter.  Couldn't be easier.

This recipe was easy but, I won't make it again. The onions get lost in the puffiness of the batter and they are bland. I tried to put second batch in flour first, this helped but not enough.

i just made these and they are delish! i have used pancake batter before for chicken balls when i make homemade chinese. but i usually just add water. for these i used beer like some others used, and added a little french fry seasoning, cayenne, and chives (i got the idea from TGIF's onion rings) came out GREAT! served them with a little honey for dipping on the side. my boyfriend LOVED them! will deffinetly make these again, since im kind of an onion ring addict!

This recipe is so good!  I'll never eat fast food or frozen onion rings again.  I added a little onion powder, pepper and Lawry's salt to the dry mix and subbed beer for the water.  I don't have a deep fryer so I just heated some oil in a pan and fried...sooooo delicious and filling!

Thought his was a good and easy recipe for onion rings.  I like the sweet flavor that comes from the pancake batter.  I did add some seasoned salt when they were drained on paper towels and that also kicked them up a knotch. Will definitely make again.

I thought that this recipe was great and really simple, but like the others I added a little cayene, salt and pepper, and had to dust my rings in a little bit of flour before diipping them in the batter so it would not fall off in the oil.

Not what I expected.....Some helpful advice..If you follow the instructions on the pancake box you would find that it too thick so may have to add more water...I sure did.And this recipe definitely calls for seasoning...I had to try at least three batches until I found out what worked...Even then still didnt like it but husband and daughter stated that they were pretty decent...I also tried cutting them thick but found it to be too much onion at one time when eatting them...I think I will try to make onion rings again but a beer batter kind....

I made this exactly as the recipe is written.  I loved how the batter completely coated the onion rings, however it was lacking some serious flavor.  Seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper? Not my favorite onion ring batter, but then again I'm a bit of an onion ring snob. :)

Great idea!!! I have a GINORMOUS bag of Krusteaz pancake mix (just add water) and this was a great way to put it to use. Loved the batter with some creole seasoning. Thanks for sharing!

These were delicious. Like other reviewers, I used a light beer instead of water and added some cayenne & garlic salt into the mixture. My pancake mix recipe called for an egg, so I also added that. The batter was the perfect consistency & stuck to the onions very well. They turned out very light & fluffy and my skeptical husband said they were very good & ate more than his fair share of them.

I am late in reviewing these. But when I saw they were not getting rave reviews, I had to put in my two cents. We made these last summer for a family get together and EVERYONE raved about them.

To be quite honest, I was worried these onion rings would not taste right using pancake batter, but as I had it on hand I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because they were great!  We used standard yellow onions.  These onion rings tasted just like something you would order from a restaurant.  They cooked very quickly too--about 65 seconds and they were done.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Good!  Seasoned the batter with old bay.  Used my deep fryer at 350.  I also reheated the left overs the next day in the convection oven and the crisped back up.

Truly the best onion rings I've EVER eaten. I added a small amount of seasoned salt to the batter. 
I'm glad I didn't make a bigger batch or I would have eaten that too.

This is now my 2nd time to make these onion rings.  The 1st time, I used a pan on the stove to fry them.  The onions needed more batter since it would slowly slide of the onion while cooking on the stove.  They tasted great, but looked messy.  This last time, I used a fry-daddy.  Wow, what a difference.  Less  batter was needed to coat the onions when using the fry-daddy, and they turned out wonderful.  Not only do the look good, but they taste just as good.  Check out my photo, its the one with the burger and ketchup.

I was skeptical that such a simple recipe could be good. Even though I read all the reviews, I still made up my usual onion ring batter (it takes 3 hours of sitting time). I made the first batch with that batter and then used this pancake mix recipe for the second one. I did a taste test on my 6 hungry guests and the pancake mix onion rings were the clear winner. And it could not have been easier. 

I added Laury's seasoning salt to the batter and used Walla Walla Sweet Onion Rings.

I will never use another batter!  We gathered over the 4th of July weekend with 26 other camping friends at our campground and fired up two turkey fryers. Everyone raved over the onion rings!  Best tasting rings all had ever tasted.  We went crazy with the batter.  We even battered pickles, oreos and hot dogs too!  Hint, make the batter up an hour or so prior to dipping so the batter starts working a little and when food is dipped, a thick coating just clings to the food items. Loved the onion rings and pickles the best!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  There were many happy families enjoying it over the holiday!!

Awesome rings.  I cut them thin like one review said but I didn't like that they got so crispy.  Next time I will cut them thicker cause I like them soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.  I will probably try some other veggies as well.

I dipped rings in dry batter and then wet batter,  batter stayed on rings very nicely.  i had the batter too thick, need to water down a little more, too much batter for the rings.  need to cut the rings in nice thick slices. be sure to spice up the batter with tabasco/garlic/celery/paprika

These are pretty professional looking onion rings.  They taste great.  They are crispy and do stay crunchy (as another reviewer said) when left in an oven at 225 degrees.  I'll definitely make this again when the mood strikes.

These were really good if you like a thickly breaded onion ring.  I used a pancake mix that required eggs and water, but I substitued the water for beer.  I also added some spices; garlic salt, oregano, whatever you have... Also, I used enough beer to make the batter slighly thinner than pancake mix would be--but still thick enough to stick to the onions.  Oh, and either dry the onions or put some cornstarch or flour on them before battering.

These turned out nicely!! They were very light and crispy and my kids loved them. I made them with 2 med sized yellow onions and just put the pieces that were too small to batter in a ziplock bag for my omelet tomorrow morning.  The only problem I had with this recipe is that they seemed extra 'greasy', despite the light texture.  I don't know if this was somehow my fault or maybe I should have used a different type of oil for frying...or maybe it's because I don't have a deepfryer with a basket.  I just heat the oil in a saucepan and drain with a slotted spoon.  At any rate, I will definitely make these again...they are simple and yummy...but I will be more vigilant with the draining...and maybe use more paper towels!!!

I liked the way that some of these turned out...unfortunately I had a very hard time keeping the batter on the onion while frying.  I didn't have the sweet problem like some other reviewers and those that turned out ok tasted really good.  Thanks for the post, but I think I will keep trying to find a recipe that will work better.

Great idea to use the pancake mix! I would highly recommend using your choice of seasoning. The only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars was because the coating is a little spongy. Will add this to my recipe book.

Sorry, but I hated this recipe.  I liked the idea of not having to prepare an "old-fashioned" batter because of the ease of mixing the pancake mix, but it turned out to be a mess.  The pancake mix creates a "spongey" coating.  I would rather have used regular seasoned flour or bread crumbs instead.  Like I said... it was a nice idea.

Didn't like this one at all!  The breading ended up too spongy--soaking up the grease in the process.  The taste was strange too--a little too "sweet."

Awesome recipe, I added granulated garlic and Lawry's to the mix.  My husband and I like the onion to remain crispy so I soak the onions in cold water before putting them in batter.  Also makes AWESOME mushrooms, great for cauliflower and broccoli too!!  Make sure your oil is HOT so they don't get "greasy". My 1 & 4 yr olds loved them!!  This is a keeper!! Thanks T!!!

Absolutely amazing! I used a buttermilk pancake mix (which only needed a 3/4 cup of water). I added a liberal amount of garlic powder, oregano, pizza seasoning and pepper to the batter. They came out perfectly! The use of pancake mix is ingenious! the onion rings came out fluffier and lighter than most i've had. I'd definitely make this again. :)

Wonderful!  My mom used to make onion rings when I was growing up. One more addition you can make to this recipe for extra crispiness is to coat your rings with instant mashed potato flakes after dipping in the batter. Messy work, but worth the result!  Thanks for posting this recipe T... brought back happy  memories! :)

Delicious, quick recipe. I needed a way to use up some extra onion I had and this did the trick. Next time I'd definitely season it (salt, pepper, maybe some Old Bay per other reviews) but even without seasoning, it was yummy!

I used bisquick - 2 eggs - milk, a somewhat thick batter. I tried it with red sweet onion and white sweet onion both were delicious. Next time I will try it with some apple cider vinegar and try marinating the onions first with some spices and acv. For a dipping sauce I used ketchup with some Franks hot sauce added. YummO

So simple to make, but it tastes like pure magic! I don't think I've ever had onion rings this delicious, who knew caramelized onions inside of a ring of pancake batter would be so good?

I suggest cutting your onion rings into larger rings to help prevent them from fusing together into one giant onion-pancake-cluster.

Also instead of cooking for 3 minutes straight, I would do 2 minutes, then lift the basket out of the oil for 1 minute, then put it back in for 1 minute. Then lift it back out of the oil and let the excess oil drip off for another minute or two before finally putting them on some paper towels to soak up more oil.

I don't know why, but everything I deep fry like that comes out much less greasy and a little bit crispier. Fries, chicken, onion rings, everything.

Used my regular old  standby homemade whole wheat pancakes recipe and family and I fell in love with the result.    
So simple - used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 egg, about 1 cup of American Pale Ale beer,  1 tsp. Onion Powder, 1 tsp. Garlic Powder, 1 tsp. Paprika, 1 tsp. Sugar and 1 tsp. Baking Soda.     Also want to thank Linda McLean for her excellent tips, along with Cynthia and Jennifer72_00.  Putting it all together has resulted in non-greasy, fast and delicious onion rings.  So good I threw away the frozen store-bought ones this afternoon.  Thanks, T and everyone!

The batter stuck well on the onions. Adding salt and spices worked well. I just didn't like the puffiness. I like my onion rings just plain crispy. These were a little crispy on the outside with the softness of a pancake on the inside. I didn't care for the slight sweetness either.

I made these tonight and while I did adjust the recipe slightly to adjust to my tastes, I was very impressed this that I still rated it 4 stars.  I did dip the onion slices in dry flour to help with the sticking and the coating ended up being crispy and delish.  I spiced up the pancake mix slightly by putting in seasoning salt and a few dashes of hot sauce and it turned out perfect.  Will make again.

Simply amazing!   We will never eat onion rings outside of our house again!!!   I also used ale with my "Hungry Jack" pancake mix and added creole seasoning then let the mix rest for 5 minutes before dunking flour dredged onion rings into the batter.  In place of regular vegetable oil we used our "seasoned house oil", that we made from leftover oil from frying chicken and pork.

My family ate over half the batch before dinner.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I love how the sweetness of the Vidalia onion paired with the sweet pancake batter.  The only problem I had with this was not necessarily with the recipe- more of a word of advice for fellow first-time-fryers:  Definitely fry these in a pan!  I used our countertop deep fryer and the onions cooked right into the fryer basket because of the batter.  By the time I got it all scraped off the basket, the onions were in a million little pieces... keep this in mind!  I'll definitely try these again with a pan.

I made the pancake mix as directed but ended up with soggy onion rings even though they were almost burnt looking from frying. BLAH! I added seasoning salt, salt & pepper and they tasted really good (minus the half burnt flavor). Not sure what I did wrong... I'll probably try another recipe next time:(

These were really good.  I have been looking for the right batter for my onion rings, and this was the closest I have found.  I think some beer in the batter might just be the final ingredient that I am missing.

I just tried this recipie today, and it was super easy. I substituted beer for the water in the pancake mix, and added a few different seasonings because it was a tad bit plain. All in all, this recipe was just okay. If it weren't. For the fact it was very easy and fast I wouldn't have rated it at 3 stars.

This is an easy and quick recipe and tastes pretty good but i would recommend frying them in a pan with oil i put them in my deep fryer and it sorta glued to the net and was pretty much a ball of crunchy  but if fried in a pan they turn out perfect. So go and make some right now if you have never had it before and if you have make it again.

Making onion rings has never been this easy! I had heard about using pancake mix as the batter and didnt think much about it, but it gives it a nice different taste. Thanks a lot I will definitely use this over and over again.

This was fun to make. It took some time to get the oil at the right temp. If you are using and electric range- set it at just a smidge under medium heat. They ARE really greasy- but who cares? They are onion rings!

I thought get real pancake mix but they were very good and so easy! I used Aunt Jemimas just add water mix and added some salt and pepper and they came out terrific. Thanks this will save me loads of money on store bought rings.

Good, but time-consuming to fry, as you cannot do too many at once, or they will stick together.

We only gave this 2 stars, though easy to make, it was not something we really found worth 4 stars. Which I was quite surprised about. After the reviews I thought it would be very good. I was disappointed and the kids who love onion rings normally, would not even eat more than one bite and I follow the recipe exactly adding nothing else. :(

I liked the idea of this.  Maybe my batter was too thick, but it was too much batter for the onion.  I didn't really get much onion flavor.  Using the pancake mix was a great idea. I used the same batter for smelt, and liked that better, since the smelt were bigger and had a better filling-to-batter ratio.

Not only is this one of the best ways to make a delicious onion ring, it is so versitile! I made this with a few moderations. I added some garlic powder, paprika, and dried parsley to the dry pancake batter. I then pre-coated them with the dry mix. After I made the pancake mix as directed (just add water). and coated them in that. I fried up 1/2 of them (350 degrees in the fryer for ~2-3 mins) just like that! Delicious. Then with the 2nd half i coated them in a breading mix (I used crushed up stuffing flavored croutons as it was the only thing I had on hand) and then fried those up too (same batter) and they were even better. this recipe was just so great I had so many compliments.

These came out perfect! I coated the rings in flour before dipping in batter and added some garlic powder and bread dipping spices. My nine yr old does not usually like onion rings but these were a hit with her!

Super easy and delicious.  This recipe is perfect as is, bu I love everything spicy, so I added cajun seasoning, red pepper flakes and a little garlic powder.  These beat restaraunt rings, hands down.  Yum!

These are just okay as written, spice up the batter and they're a five. I made haystacks-sliced them super thin, dipped them into the batter and used tongs to pull them back out, then fried. Faster, easier, and a lot less mess.

These were great! Perfect texture, crisp and light, and the onion stayed with the coating. The pancake batter works perfectly. I dredged onions lightly in flour first as another reviewer suggested. Added some spices for the heck of it (just a touch of: paprika, pepper, garlic powder, dry mustard, and cayenne), but would be fine without too. I'd never deep fried before; I used a cast iron skillet, about an inch of oil, and played it by ear with the temp, adjusting as needed. Fun and easy recipe!

I'm not too great in the kitchen, but my 93 yr old grandma loves onion rings.  Thought I'd give it a whirl and take her some on our next visit.  This was so simple.  I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Along with the onions we tried zuchinni.  Just wonderful.  My 10 year old HATES onions but she gobbled these up!!  Great recipe! (PS  I think I'm going to have to make another batch, these never made it to grams)

Texture is nice and crispy, but these are very bland, I think I'll try these again but add something to the batter to give them some much needed flavor.

For ease, 5 stars, for presentation, 3, so I'm giving it 4.  I had a hard time getting the batter to stick to the onions.  We deep fried them in our fryer.  They did taste very good and we would definitely make them again!  As a side note, we used reduced-fat Bisquick and followed the pancake recipe on their.

These were really good. I will be making these again for sure. Thanks for such an easyand yummy recipe.  I would have given these 5 stars but they seemed to be alot more greasier than your average onion ring, but other than that, they were yummy.

Sooooo crispy and good!  I'm always happy when my kids tell me something is better than when they have it at their fave restaurant.  I made no adjustments, but I'll try some Old Bay next time as one reader suggested. 
Thank you!

Very good.  I used with bisquick but for a less "cakey" batter, I may try omitting the egg in the batter.  Still, quite good!

These rings are easy and very good. I have a preg. neighbor whos been craving for rings and I made her some that fulfilled the craving. I added a few spices to the batter depending on our moods but they are very good alone with a  bit of salt when they are done frying.

This is the best recipe for onion rings. I add a few spices and they taste just like the BBQ restaurant down the road. YUM!

These were ok.  A little too light and spongy for me though.

These were pretty good but a bit greasy.  I made the batter too thick and they puffed up too much.  Would probably make these again but make the batter according to the box directions.

Great and easy recipe. I made them for the first time tonight and everyone on my floor loved them. Remember to lay finished onions down on paper towels to absorb excess oil. Also, sprinkle each batch with a bit of salt just after removing from oil.

I made a few changes such as using a regular yellow onion and adding seasoning salt to the buttermilk pancake batter and after dipping in batter I coated the rings in bread crumbs.  After cooking in oil, I sprinkled the onion rings with seasoining salt.  The result was almost exactly like A&W onion rings. Delicious!

Awesome!  I added just a bit of water to the mix to form a really thick batter.  Delicous!  I tried a thinner batter, but it wouldn't stick to the onions.
