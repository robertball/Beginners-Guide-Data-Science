I really wanted (and expected to) like this one, but we really didn't care for it at all.

I made this and put it over baked potatoes cooked in coals also and it was delicious. It's much more fun watching your food cook on the campfire instead of over the boring stove. It serves as a meal for us. I made this the same as presented with no modifications.
