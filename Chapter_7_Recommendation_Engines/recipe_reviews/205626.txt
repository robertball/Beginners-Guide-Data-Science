Instead of using grapefruit juice, I used a 24 ounce jar of grapefruit segments and juice and I also subbed the blueberries for a mix of raspberries, marionberries, and blueberries. I blended everything and put it into my icecream maker for 20 minutes and it turned out WONDERFUL!! Its already half gone after less than 24 hours :)

I was given a bottle of grapefruit juice and didn't like it. But I am not one to make waste. I made this in the blender with frozen blueberries and no vodka. I poured it into an ice cream maker and has a wonderful sorbet 20 minutes later.

This is delicious!  It took a really long time to freeze, probably because I added the vodka.  I might try leaving it out next time, to see if that makes a difference in the consistency.  It never did freeze really solid, and you had to eat it quickly before it melted.  But it was really yummy!  A relatively guilt-free sweet treat.

Great recipe that allowed me to use fresh blueberries from the garden.  I like a tart sorbet so I only used 1 cup of sugar.  Other reviewers questioned if the alcohol needed to be added and it does - it keeps ice crystals from forming.  I only used 1/4 cup of gin (didn't have vodka on hand).  Whatever alcohol you use, make sure it is good quality or you will get a bitter after taste.
