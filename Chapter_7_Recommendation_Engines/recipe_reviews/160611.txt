Fabulous, reliable, can be made with oil instead of butter for those keeping kosher. I have a sea-level recipe that is not nearly as good...planning to try to adapt this one to sea level this week!

Great recipe.  It only took 20 minutes to bake.  I am sure this is because of my low altitude. Looks and tastes great.
I am glad I found it.

This recipe uses a ton of eggs compared to other challah recipes, and I love it for that. 45 minutes seems to be the right time for the second rise - one batch I rose for 1 hour 15 minutes and that was too much - it flattened out a little when baking.

We live in New Mexico so we have an obligation to put green chiles in literally everything - I put 7 extra-hot chiles diced right into the dough before kneading and it came out unbelievably delicious and the whole house smelled like chile.

Love this bread, family loves it!  Made 4 loaves this weekend, kept one at home, and took 3 to a church potluck.  There's not even one slice left.  Just a note... I use the leftover egg whites from the separated eggs to brush on the loaf before baking, works great.

I have used this recipe for a couple of weeks and it is wonderful! I live in Colorado, so it helps that you live here also! The only thing I change is how much flower I use, I only use 3 cups. When I use an extra half it gets a little to dry.

Great recipe, and easy. Don't think twice about using 2 packs of yeast. The result is tasty bread with a wonderful yeasty aroma. I live at 3600 feet and this is now my go-to bread recipe.

I am new to the very high altitude baking. We live at almost 9,000ft. I am also new to the world of baking bread. Let me tell you, this was one of the best breads I've ever made. I substituted coconut milk and I also used olive oil instead of butter. This turned out so crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I will definitely make it again and next time I might try making a sweet glaze for over the top. My boyfriend compared it to a croissant ??

Worked well at 6500 ft. At this alt use 25% less yeast.  I used the left over egg white to brush on the bread before baking . Will use again.

We live at 5,280 feet, and this recipe worked perfectly for us! It looked gorgeous, too. We followed the directions exactly, except we braided the bread with 5 strands, and we sprinkled sesame seeds on top after the egg wash but before popping it in the oven.

Works great although I'm not sure it needs that much yeast. I used a mixture of WW flour, AP flour and bread flour. Also, there is enough to make 2 smaller loaves with this too. As this is my first challah, I'm not sure what is good and what isn't. This is overall a good bread for sure.
