I use roughly the same recipe, but sometimes when I have an abundance of currants, I need to freeze.  In this case remember to use less water from frozen currants.  Also good to note that when picking the currants, take stem and all.  The currants lose their own pectin if taken from the stems when picked.  Since the berries are strained anyway, the stems can be strained then:-)  All tips provided by a 94 year old friend who gave me her currant bushes.

This recipe worked fantastically even without the added pectin! I haven't had it fail yet. I also add herbal flavourings such as rosemary during the cooking phase. It adds a nice touch to the final product.

I am a 47 year old man, that has never made jelly before. I had a bumper crop of currants this year and hated to see them go to waste. I used this recipe almost exactly as written and the jelly turned out great. It tastes between cranberry and rhubarb.

This is the exact recipe that is included in the Certo brand liquid fruit pectin box.  I actually used 5 cups of sugar instead of 7 and it's still tasty!

Outstanding Jelly!!! I was only able to get just under 3 pounds of currants from my bush so I had to modify the measurements some but it turned out great. First time making jelly and after having this jelly I can safely say that I will never buy another jar of jelly from the store again.

Very easy and straightforward.  I increased the juice to 6 cups (that is what I had)and used 7.5 cups sugar, and 6 oz. of liquid pectin and it turned out wonderful.  Thanks for the easy recipe, I was thankful it worked out so well after taking the time to pick all those currants!

I was hard pressed to get that last cup of liquid from 4 pounds.  Next time I would add more water.  The 7 cups of sugar seemed like a lot to me but I followed the recipie this first time around.  Next time would proably cut down by 1 cup and possibly 2.  What I didn't like is that the Certo packets are 3 oz so you have to cut into the second packet and throw out the balance.  Maybe next time I'd just go with the 3 oz packet.

Excellent recipe. One thing: leave the stems on the currants when you cook them, enhances the flavor and you won't need to add pectin.

This recipe is delicious! I only wanted (and had enough berries) for 1 jar so I changed the serving size to 16 and it was perfect! I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4 because I didn't want it to be too sugary. It says to only use 1/4 cup of water and I was about to add more but I'm glad I didn't, at the end when you pour it in the jar it has just the perfect amount for my jar (only a little extra just perfect for a little taste test). Also at the beginning, instead of a jelly/cheese cloth, I just used a wire strainer and let it drip out (after I couldn't drip anymore juice out, I just mashed it down with a spoon) into a pot. Great recipe and can't wait for next year when our lovely currants come out again.

good recipe, but I have always filled as close to the top as possible, wiped the rim with a clean hot damp cloth, then turned jars upside down after securing lids and bands.

I made no changes to this recipe. I did win first place at the county fair this year and can't wait until next year to make it again.

I never made currant jelly before and my currant bush finally got big enough to bear (almost) enough berries for a batch this year.   I was short some so I follwed the recipe for 75% of everything.  Instead of cheese cloth and waiting for it to drip, plus thinking there would be no way I'd have enough juice, I smooshed it through a fine mesh sieve.  I was still short in the amount of juice I needed so I added unsweetened Apple juice to bring it up to the amount I needed and it all turned out great!  Will definitely be making this every year!

This was my first attempt at jelly and I didn't have pectin. But as others had mentioned they didn't use pectin with currants,   did a bit of research and learned that currants produce their own pectin. So, I felt confident trying it without the pectin. I didn't have 5 cups of juice so I just reduced the recipe which was easy and this was AMAZING!  Even my husband, a jelly fan and skeptic, was a big fan. I had about 2.5 cups of juice and got 5 jars of jelly!  It is sweet (I did equal parts juice and sugar) but not too sweet. It is great on toast and with PB&J.   Easy and delicious so there is no reason not to try it!

I always test my jelly using a drop of jelly on a  cold plate to ensure that it is starting to thicken.

It was OK,  I didn't use any pectin at all as I never have with red currants. I prefer the crystal clarity produced by straining overnight in a jelly bag and this was a tad too sweet, I think I will continue to use Delias'  Eliza Acton recipe. Probably because I'm so used to it!

Great tasting recipes, but my current jelly never sets up!! I live at 5000 ft. Maybe I'm not boiling it long enough?? Any suggestions
