I love the orange juice/cranberry combination with sweet potatoes! I can't see why you would want to use shortening...maybe if you were allergic to butter? This recipe is much better with butter or coconut oil. Sorry Crisco...but thanks, for the great recipe.

Since I'm the only sweet potato lover in the family I scaled this back to one potato.  I cubed the sweet potato and roasted it before adding the sauce.  I know that this is a Crisco recipe, but I used butter instead of shortening.  Same flavor combo I use in my cranberry sauce, definitely Thanksgivingish.

I cubed the potatoes and roasted them and then poured the sauce on top. Oh my, that sauce was yummy! I got lots of compliments at dinner!

My wife made this dish with the exception that she cubed up the sweet potatoes and roasted them.  The sauce was to die for!  We are already exploring the possibility of using it on other dishes.  My wife was literally eating it from the ball jar we used to save the extras.
