Nutrition surely is in the eye of the beholder—but for those who love pizza and want to limit processed white flour (as is generally recommended) this crust is a good start. The calories, fat and carbs really are concentrated in the toppings, not the crust. So if you’re concerned with counting calories, try alternative toppings—as you would any other pizza that fits your dietary guidelines! I especially love how the seeds add crunch, iron, fiber and protein to the cauliflower crust, and the convenience and cost-effectiveness of starting from frozen cauliflower.  Hope others will try this crust as it’s been a super healthy  & weight loss-friendly substitute for me. As a flatbread I have frequently substituted it  for wheat flour bread, buns and pizza crust — all while losing 20% of my body weight to limit diabetes risk. FYI I  probably should have labeled this as serving two rather than one; I did have leftovers.

Interesting idea, but didn't taste that great.  Liked the topping better than the crust!

I tried this recipe and a similar one many times in the past.  I have to stay away from carbohydrates of go diabetic and I had high hopes for this pizza.   I found some satisfaction from the cheese, pizza sauce and toppings, but there is absolutely nothing better than a great gluten crust pizza - nothing beats that.   I haven't had a "real pizza" in eight years.  However this is a healthy alternative. Put on lots of toppings and cheese.   Give it a try and then submit your review.
