I made a few minor changes, so I am rating it as I prepared it, not as written. Changes: I used a 7.5 oz can of salmon instead of a 5 oz fillet. I doubled all the other ingredients except the onion and garlic because I was worried too much of the raw veggies would overpower the other flavors. I cooked the lentils in half chicken broth and half water for more flavor. I used regular bacon and white onion. Specifics: Since it doesn't specify which kind of lentils or mustard, as an FYI, I used red lentils and dijon mustard. It was really good. I'll probably start making this regularly.
