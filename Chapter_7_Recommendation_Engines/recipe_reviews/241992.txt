Delicious soup, and very easy! This will be perfect this summer when everyone's garden is overflowing with zucchini! The only change I made (not by choice) was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken because I didn't realize I was out! Keep in mind this is why it may be a little bit darker in my picture. Still delicious though! I used an immersion blender and blended everything right in the pot instead of using my blender. I'll be making this one again!

My family loved this.  I used yellow squash instead of zucchini and made this in the instant pot.  It was so easy.  Sauteed the onions in the instant pot and added everything else so there weren't a bunch of steps.  Cooked it on manual, high pressure for 8 minutes.

surprisingly  delicious.  I only made a few changes.  I only used one onion.  I added two crushed garlic cloves and sauteed it with the onion.  I also added the potatoes with the  cooked onion and stirred in 2 tablespoons of flour  to it  before  I added vegetable broth, then immediately added the carrots and zucchini  and simmered 15 minutes.   Was figuring that I would need to add more spices when I tasted it, but it is so good, no need to.  i didn't even add the basil.

Loved this!!  So flavorful. I made it almost exactly to the recipe with a few minor changes. I had to add a couple of yellow squash to the zucchini to make the 8 cups. I also added minced garlic while boiling the veggies. The only other thing different was to add some dry dill and a couple of splashes of half and half I had on hand. That made it a little creamier. However I tried it before I did that and it was still amazing. This will definitely go into the rotation.

light and tasty soup. The directions could have been a lot simpler. I sauteed the onions then added all the veggies, broth, spices and herbs ( used dried ) and simmer everything for 30 minutes. I used immersion blender to blend in the same pot.
I can see this soup flavored  with other herbs that go really well with zucchini, like thyme and dill.

Never would have thought to turn squash into a soup. This was so simple and surprisingly delicious! My husband even added some shredded cheddar to his bowl of soup and liked it both ways. No need to make changes to this recipe though and we'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this many times due to an overflow of squash and zucchini from a crop share. Each time I've made it it's been just as good, and each time it's been a different set of squash. I use whatever type of squash we get for the week and have also substituted sweet potatoes for the regular potato. This is my go to "empty the fridge" recipe as it really is good use of a lot of things.

This is a great tasting soup. I made it with turnip roots instead of potato for lower carbs and I added some smoked paprika.

I kinda went rogue with it and it turned out amazing. I added a little curry which is really nice and some garlic salt along with some other spices. I also added cream cheese, shredded mozzarella, and a little milk. Love this recipe :)

Love this soup, a good way to use up that over supply of zucchini. I also freeze extra zucchini in 8 cup packs for those cold winter days. I use an immersion blender and leave it a little chunky.

I thought there wasn't enough flavor to the recipe, so I added 2 small cloves of garlic and 3 bay leaves (removed these before puree). After trying it with these changes, I still felt something was missing, so I added 4 slices of crumbled crisp bacon. I also followed another person's suggestion and added canned white beans. These additions made this recipe a keeper.

It was good as is, but was missing something for us. Added a tablespoon of curry and teaspoon of celery seed. Going to make it again, roasting all of the veggies first, with a jalepeno or two.

I halved the recipe and still it made a lot of soup. It seemed a bit bland so I added some red pepper flakes and a healthy shake of no-salt herb/garlic spice blend, and blended with immersion blender.  Recipe is definitely a keeper. Great way to use the squash now in farmers markets or perhaps your own garden.

It was great.  I used hearty vegetable broth instead of chicken and I use yellow squash.

Tasty! Used vegetable bouillon, added celery and cumin. Added mushrooms after blending. Lots of chopping, next time I’ll try not chopping since I have a Vitamix.

7 30 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/241992/summer-squash-soup/ ...  Initially, "chicken broth thickened with potatoes".  It essentially is, but with good chicken broth, it is a warmer-upper soup.  I'd add more basil - a T or two more; a little crushed red pepper or green chiles would be a nice addition.

This soup is amazing.  Full of flavor.  You would think you are eating a fattening soup with cream in it.  But there is no cream.  I recommend this soup for everyone.  The vegetarians will love it(use vegetable stock) and you can also make it vegan. Thanks for the recipe.

A great way to use up those zucchini and summer squash!  I thought this was a lot of veggies--it was a lot of soup!  Will be freezing it for later.  Only had enough squash for 6 cups instead of 8, still worked fine.

This was a thick and hearty soup. I made the mistake of making a half batch the first time, it was good enough that I should have made a double batch.
