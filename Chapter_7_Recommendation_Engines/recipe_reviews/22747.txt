Great recipe!  I adapted a little, as I had lots of dried apples on hand.  Just rehydrate them and use approx 3/4 cup.  Then, I pureed in blender afterward to get proper texture.  I would suggest adding a little cinnamon, but otherwise great!  The pumpkin flavor isn't overwhelming...great blend of flavors.  I am giving a jar of this to my aunt as a Thanksgiving hostess gift.  My advice...TRY IT!

This was so flavorful and delicious. I used apple cider instead of juice, and added a little cinnamon too. Perfect.
