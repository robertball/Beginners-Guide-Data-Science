These are those cookies that are similar to cake. Definitely reminds me of pumpkin pie! I used a whole 15 oz. can of pumpkin and butter in place of shortening. They are addicting little cookies! I can imagine how extra yummy they would be having cool whip!

Unfortunately, we did not enjoy these.  I threw the remainder of the batter away after baking the 1st batch.  Wierd flavor and texture.

I doubled the recipe and made some changes. I used about a third a cup of shortening and 2/3 butter since I didn't have enough shortening. Also did a cup each of white and brown sugar just because I prefer brown sugar. Also added mini white chocolate chips. 
Cookies were a bit doughy but I dont like hard cookies so I thought they were great!
Would definitely make again

Yuk!  Center doesn't cook consistently, and they are rubbery, even with nuts added.  Threw them out!

Easy to make. A little less flavorful than I was expecting.
