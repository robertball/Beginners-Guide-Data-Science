This recipe should be titled cupcakes - not brownies.

This recipe is the best! So easy and has become my go-to dessert for when I make meals for friends or treats for work. Everyone begs for them and then they blame me for making them because they are so good :-)

Awesomely easy, fun and delicious! Everyone I shared these with LOVED them. I'm thinking of trying a couple w/ icing on top, not that it needs any, I just wanna see if it takes them to the next level. These would be great with different flavors of oreos too. Great recipe and I will def be making them again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy and delicious!

Two notes, though.... Using 2 eggs gives you a cake-like brownie.  Also, the oreos rise up! Our brownies ended up looking like chocolate popovers with little hats!

These were soft, moist, and yummy! The one thing I would improve is that the oreo taste did not come through as I thought it would. It was there, but not very much. I would put 2 oreos for each muffin next time! Thanks for the amazing recipe’

I didn’t have vegetable oil, so I used coconut oil. I greased the pan, but hadn’t used liners and I wasn’t able to get the muffins out of the tin. They were very, very soft. I ended up eating a few with a spoon, right out of the tin. They didn’t stick, they were just so soft that they didn’t stay together. Delicious, however!

It’s really good by itself but to make it even better I added cookie dough to the bottom of each muffin cup before the brownie and sandwich cookies. This really accentuates and enhances all the flavors making it a perfect dessert for kids and adults.

Made in a 9 inch square pan. Added some bittersweet chocolate chips into the brownie batter. Put some chocolate fudge icing on the top. Chocolate delight.

I followed the recipe as written and used double stuff Oreos. I ended up with 17 brownie-cupcakes. They turned out good.
