These came out very well. I reduced the oil a bit and used more orange juice to keep the liquid the same. Muffins were moist, and had good flavor. They were a pretty good size too.

I really liked these muffins (as did ALL my family members).  I added extra choc chips and extra raspberries.  These are a HIT - I will for sure make them again.

I loved this recipe.  Was looking for a way to use up some raspberries and this was great.  The muffins rose nicely in the oven, and are moist.  I added extra fruit and chocolate, and used apple sauce and lemon juice rather than orange juice.  Worked great!  Next time I'll cut down the sugar a bit - they didn't need to be quite so sweet.  Also, they need to be left in the tins for a few minutes or they fall apart when you take them out, but this may have been because of the extra fruit.

Very good recipe. I used 2/3 C whole wheat and 1 cup unbleached regular flour,reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, increased raspberries to 1 cup. Made the house smell wonderful! Will definitely make it again!

This really was wonderful! I made them exactly like the recipe. They were warm and moist when we had them! SO GOOD! I used fresh raspberry's and it really was delish.. I think next time I will try to substitute applesauce for some of the oil, just to reduce a little of the fat. REALLY WORTH TRYING.

These were a little on the dry side but otherwise good.  I used applesauce in place of the canola oil and substituted a third of a cup of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I think it would have been nice to have some additional raspberries.

These came out a bit dry for my liking and I didn't think they were quite sweet enough. Next time I will try adding milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet and maybe switch to brown sugar rather than white.

I substituted strawberries for raspberries because that's all I had and they turned out delicious. I did add a little extra of the strawberries since they are not as flavorful as raspberries. I did not find the muffins dry - even the next day. In my opinion the texture was perfect for a muffin - not too dense like I have found with some other muffin recipes. Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this recipe instead as a loaf with fresh, homegrown raspberries because we get an abundance of them in our yard.  I cook at the same temperature as the recipe calls for but instead use a greased (with REAL crisco, not spray) loaf pan and bake for 50-55 minutes.  Turns out great!  The nice thing is you can then freeze them to have all year long.  Just thaw unwrapped on the counter for an hour ang it is ready to eat.  For an added treat, toast slices in the toaster oven and then slather on a thin amount of butter.  Yum!

5 stars for taste--these are delish! 4 for appearance-soggy bottoms! My chips and berries sunk to the bottom of the muffin making that part stick to the baking cups. I did add a few more chips and raspberries than the recipe but not a lot. Any suggestions on how to prevent this?

Oh my word these are absolutely delicious! I even posted on Facebook my love for these and I've had many people ask for the recipe! So moist and heavenly, I was kind of worried that either the Raspberries or Chocolate would overpower one or the other, but they were in perfect balance. Huge upside is that my apartment smells wonderful!

These are fantastic and easy muffins! I did replace most of the oil with applesauce to decrease the fat content and used almond extract in place of the vanilla for one batch.  They came out beautiful, moist and delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!

These are excellent!  I used blackberries and raspberries and cut the oil in half and substituted applesauce for the other half.  My kids loved them so much we ended up making another batch the next day. These are now our favorite muffins.

Yummy. I don't really like it when people change a recipe and then complain about it. So I won't. I used alittle 1/2 cup sodapop instead of all the milk (I'd doubled the recipe) These are wonderful. I actually ended up with 30+ muffins. Will freeze what don't get eaten. I love these. Thank you for posting.

My muffins are flat! (I probably just overmixed the batter.)  My muffins turned out soft, not dry. :) I used frozen raspberries.   I can't wait to try these with dark chocolate chips!

These were pretty good muffins.  While we enjoyed the raspberry chocolate combination, the oats gave these an odd texture.  Maybe soaking the oats in the milk and OJ before adding them to the batter would help.  These baked up beautifully.

These are sure tasty morsels!  I have had only one so far and the chocolate chips were still a little melted from the oven.  Just delicious!  I forgot the vanilla, but didn't seem that there was anything missing.

These are really moist.  I used extra applesauce and lemon juice for the OJ, whole wheat flour, granulated fructose, and almond milk.  And extra raspberries never hurt anyone.

These muffins are full of flavour. The combination of tart/sweet raspberries and the chocolate is divine. The addition of oatmeal gives the muffins a dense texture not cake like at all which is what I look for in a muffin. I substituted lemon juice for the orange juice because I had no orange juice available.

Really easy to make, and the texture was great.  However, I think I decided that raspberries are too strong for muffins.  The chocolate chip flavor sort of gets lost in these.

Recipe was very simple to make and the taste is amazing with the hints of so many flavors. You can taste the tartness of the berry, the homey flavor of the cinnamon, the comfort of the chocolate, and a very small hint of the orange juice that ties all the flavors together in just one bite. This is definitely a keeper for a recipe. They were so moist and I didn't alter the recipe at all.

These were awesome!  I made some changes to the recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. Used low fat buttermilk instead of milk. Added 2 very ripe bananas and 3 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  Used white whole wheat flour in place of the regular white flour.  Added 2 tablespoons of ground flax.  Increased the berries to 1 cup.  They turned out moist and very flavorful.  Love the chocolate chips with the raspberries!

I questioned whether I would like this recipe, but I had all the ingredients to make it, so I decided to give it a try.  Instead of raspberries, I used blackberries and blueberries from the garden, and instead of making muffings, I used a loaf pan and baked it in my solar oven.  It took about an hour to bake in the solar oven.  Both my husband and I love it, and we can hardly wait to have it with coffee in the morning.

Delicious. I used 2 cups of frozen(unthawed) raspberries and could have used more. I used apple sauce for most of the oil. I didn't have baking soda so just used 2-3 extra tsp baking powder and a pinch of salt. I only cooked for about 18 mins and the tops were a lovely golden.

I swapped out the egg with applesauce and skim milk with plain (original) almond milk. I also doubled the chocolate chunks and raspberries. I made them a tasty vegan muffin =)

I liked the combination of chocolate and raspberry, but they were a little dry.  I even added an extra Tbsp of orange juice and a little extra milk.  I would also a little more of both the berry and chocolate chip.

Unlike other readers I did not find these to be dry, but it might be because I use applesauce instead of oil in my baked goods, and that usually keeps them a little more moist.  Everyone that ate these loved them, and they do taste wonderful.  The only reason I rated them a 4 is because they are horribly ugly to look at.  The combination of the berries and the chocolate turns them a funky gray-ish color.  So I don't know that I'd serve them at anything fancy or upscale, but if you want something for family/friends and don't care about presentation then these would be perfect.

These were sooo good.  I used frozen raspberries which release a lot of juice when they thaw.  I don't like piec of soggy fruit in muffins, so I broke up the raspberries.  I used the juice as part of the liquid.  I broke the raspberries into pieces that were too small to really appreciate them in the muffins.  Next time I will leave them in bigger pieces.

Made these for a Valentine's treat and they were wonderful, especially warm.    I had to make them egg and milk free, and still came out great, I did add 1/2c more chips-next time will stick to 1/2c stated.

Pretty good, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolate and fruit together. From no fault of the recipe, my raspberries were tart. :P Nevertheless, I think a big fan of chocolate and raspberries would, I am sure, love this recipe. :)

I used dark chocolate, but I'm sure it was just as tasty! I made these for my girlfriend, friends and roommates and they absolutely loved it. I would definitely would make them again!

The muffins were superb. I am new to muffin making, so was apprehensive about what they would turn out like. They were faaaantastic. 

I did substitute buttermilk for the milk, and apple sauce for the oil as other peeps have done in various tweaks.

Loved the combination Of chocolate and raspberry. Got rave reviews on these muffins.I used old fashioned oats, fresh raspberries and I just love the mini chocolate chips. I also added a little white glaze to the tops.Yum!
