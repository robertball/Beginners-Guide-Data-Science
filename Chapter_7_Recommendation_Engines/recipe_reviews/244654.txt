Wow!  You don't need a holiday to make this.  This recipe is wonderful!  I didn't have any wild rice, but substituted with Basmati rice.  The blend of spices , peanuts, toasted rice was so tasty!  It went very well with roasted pork loin, and I can see myself making this for our next Thanksgiving dinner!

Combing wild rice with bread cubes plus adding the crunch of roasted peanuts is the secret to this delicious twist on Dressing. My family loves their dressing with a slight crunch yet they also want to taste the familiar flavors found in traditional dressing. It's quick and easy too! A real winner for your Holiday Table or any other time of year!
