I love the combination of fig preserves and goat cheese, so I was intrigued by the addition of the veggies to this sandwich.  I had some tasty 5-grain bakery bread on hand, so thatâ€™s what I used (good choice, too).  The cucumber gives it some crunch,  the perfectly-ripe tomatoes some sweetness, and the basil lends a nice fresh taste.  Thanks, Jeannine, for a great new sandwich.

Total hit! -- Even my son, who never eats things like figs and goat cheese, loved it. We couldn't find fig preserves so we used chopped dried figs. Excellent!

I have had my eye on this recipe for awhile now. I absolutely love sandwiches. So when my husband said he would make me whatever I wanted for Mother's Day, I had him make this. HOLY COW! This has to be one of the best sandwiches I have ever tasted. He snuck in thinly sliced avocados and finely chopped red onion and it was great but it didn't need it. As written it truly is a sandwich masterpiece.

Love this! Used freshly made Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls also from this site. A very fresh tasting sandwich. Thanks so much for the recipe!
