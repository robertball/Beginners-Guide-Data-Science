I've been making this drink for years!! YUM!! You must try these changes.  Use white tequila, use Corona Extra & instead of the water use 12 ounces of 
7UP!! Big Difference!

Absolutely love this recipe - you can't taste the beer and everyone's surprised if you tell them it's in there.  I've done several variations - one I like the best is to use the full can of frozen lemonade instead of the smaller lime ade and add the juice of a whole lime.  just keep the ratios of water and tequila equal w/the size of the frozen juice - use the container to measure (still one beer).  So simple!  Also, sometimes I put in Cointreau or Grand Marnier in place of some of the tequila - maybe 1/4 cup - it's sweet so keep it minimal.  I always serve mine on the rocks.  Or you can use another carbonated bev, such as ginger ale or one of those Smirnoff drinks. If you won't drink the whole batch in one sitting, just don't put the beer in to the pitcher; add it to each glass - that way you can save the batch for weeks and drink it as you want.  I think it's best if the mix is at room temperature so the ice melts some. One more thing - I recommend using a lighter color beer so you don't make it look funky.  Enjoy!

Like others said, this is a STRONG recipe, but people raved like mad.  I had to email the recipe to everyone that came to the party. Use a mexican beer, as someone else recommended. I accidentally used Corona Light (I hate light beers) and it was still just terrific. I went out and bought a set of margarita glasses on the strength of my belief that I will make these margaritas at EVERY party I ever throw for the rest of my life. Use the coarse kosher salt, by the way, for the glasses, because you can use that sort of salt in lots of other ways, rather than getting "margarita" salt. Much cheaper, just as good.

these are great! like other reviewers, i did not put the full amount of tequila... but they still pack a punch! i used Mike's Hard Lime instead of beer for a lime-ier taste... delish! tip for those who want to make it blended (it IS possible): do NOT blend it with the beer mixed in! it will foam and overflow your blender. instead, blend all ingredients except the beer with ice and make it thick. stir in beer and viola! blended frosty margaritas for your enjoyment!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  Love, love, love Beer Margaritas.  I have passed this recipe all over work.  I have used both Sprite and Water, either works.  Corona Light is the best beer by far to add to this concoction.  I have also found that this is better if you let sit over night.

I made them first with Sprite as others have suggested and then as the recipe called for and used water.  Water was by far better. It was much too sweet for us with the sprite.  They were great.

I have made a recipe similar to this before but it didn't call for water and I always thought the limeade was a little overpowering.  I tried this recipe with the 12 oz. of water and it was delicious.  It makes one of the best margaritas I have tasted!

We made these margaritas with both the sprite and with just water and we prefer the water ones. With the sprite we found them to be too sweet and carbonated.I will make these again for a party in the near future and we will see how they go over with guests.

we are beer-and-liquor drinkers, so margaritas are never on our menu. but we tried these, and were very pleasantly surprised. the beer really takes away the extreme sweetness, but adds a great flavor. we'll only use this for margaritas, i'm sure. thanks!

Beer Margaritas are great!  (Be a little wary, though, they go down very smoothly and you may end up tipsier than you intended. *wink*)   NOTE: As good as an idea it seems to blend them, DON'T PUT BEER IN THE BLENDER, as it will explode all over the ceiling.  Blend the tequila, limeaid, water and extra ice together.  THEN stir in the beer and serve. I speak from experience on this one.

This recipe is awesome!  Try it with 12oz of 7up soda instead of water.  Gives it some extra zing!  Wonderful!

This is a satisfying, easy, mess-free recipe and great for a crowd.  I use club soda or sparkling mineral water instead of water to cut the sweetness.

This is a very quick recipe.  After making it, place it in the freezer.  The next day you have frozen/slushy margarita.  This is great for guests-or- to keep them over a week or so.  You don't need to drink them in one evening.

I have been using this recipe for about 5 years now, and we LOVE IT!  It is the ONLY at home margarita mix we use.  And to top it off, it's so CHEAP to make!  It is requested whenever we go to any get together.  To make it on the rocks we usually just add a few more cans of water....which is PERFECT to take in a jug when you're camping!!

I've never cared for margarita but it was Cinco de Mayo.  I like beer and it was hot so I've decided to try this for a change.  I made a mistake and bought "Minute Maid Frozen Lemonade" instead of limeade but I made sure to buy some Corona as many reviewers said was a choice of beer for this recipe, and a bottle of Sienna Mist.  I love sweet drinks but I also like to try recipes as they're written for the first time.  I've read you can keep the margarita mix for a few days if you don't add beer, so I just mixed the frozen lemonade tequila mixture and poured 1/3 cup each water and beer into my big glass with ice and add 2/3 cup of the mixture to try.  WOW, this was super delish!  It was sweet enough as is.  I was so happy with the result, I even brought a glass for my neighbor.  Then I had another try out with Sienna Mist instead of water.  It was good.  Sweeter, of course, but again, I love sweet drinks so it didn't bother me.  Here is what I thought: if you like sweet drinks and you're only having drinks, then the soda version is fine.  But if you're having the drink with food, like at a dinner party, then the original water version might be better otherwise it's like you're having some dessert wine with your dinner.  But for those who can eat your dessert before your dinner, go for it.  Either way, it's a very good margarita.  With Corona, I didn't taste the beer so I might experiment with some other beer.  I think this will be my Drink of the Year!  Yum, yum, yum!

HOLY MARGARITA! These are simply THE BEST margaritas I have ever had... and I made 'em! I use Heineken as my beer and follow the recipe exactly. So easy, so yummy and so very potent. They go down very easily because they're very, very, very smooth, so be forewarned that you'll be Wasted Away in Margaritaville if you drink too many. These are certainly a crowd pleaser and people will be begging you for the recipe (if they're able to still talk!) A great, great recipe for parties because you can make them in large quantities AND very quickly. Salud!

These have, without a doubt, become my go-to "bring to a party" drink.  Every time I whip these things up, I hear nothing but ooo's and aaa's. And they are SUPER easy.  I usually use a silver or blanco tequila of decent quality (but definitely not patron or anything). I have used everything from regular water to sprite to ginger ale to lime seltzer (in place of the regular water), and while some batches are sweeter than others, they all still work just fine.  I have also used frozen margarita mix in place of limeade when I couldn't find it.  The recipe is forgiving, and it always seems to be good.  I prefer the limeade and feel like I like the seltzer water best.  I also rarely use as much tequila as the recipe calls for, and they are PLENTY strong, even if I half it (I am a pretty regular drinker). Either way, this recipe is awesome and will make you popular with your friends and fellow party goers! :)

AMAZING!  I made these for a gathering and followed the recipe exactly, if you are not a heavy drinker I would put less Tequila in this, as a full can of Tequila made for a lively and fun party but make sure you have a designated driver to take people home! Went through 4 cans of Limeade and a big bottle of booze. Salted the rims and served over tons of ice in big tall glasses. A definate keeper and you can use whatever light beer you have on hand. That icky sweet taste that has stopped me in the past from serving these for friends isn't in this drink!! ENJOY!

A friend made this with cranberry juice instead of lime and also with orange juice...they were excellent.  Also very good when you mix the two!

Everyone loves it when I make these beer margaritas. To keep them on hand, I pre-make them and put them in freezer bags and freeze them.  They don't freeze completely because of the alcohol.  When I take them out of the freezer, I pound on the bag and then put the slush in glasses and serve.

Yikes...doubled this for tailgating prior to a Jimmy Buffett concert the other night - very tasty with some margarita salt on the rim and it certainly served its purpose - we were feeling the love! Now the morning after was not fun, but we asked for it...

I have been hunting for the "Perfect Margarita" for over 25 years and have seldom encountered perfection.  I have come to the conclusion that I am a Margarita snob.  There I said it.  HOWEVER, I was in charge of making Margaritas for a crowd and even though I do not enjoy Beer, the cost of ingredients forced me to look for a less expensive recipe than traditional Margaritas.  I was amazed that these Beer Margaritas were perfect.  I will never make "real" Margaritas again!

OMG!!!!!!!  just made a pitcher of these.  They are to die for.  Will have to make sure and put limits on these or it will be lights out very early...LOL.  Used bud light with lime for the beer and you cannot even taste a beer flavor.  Delicious!

I told my hubby about this and he was so intrigued that he went to the store and bought the ingredients right away,  WE LOVED IT!  The only thing we didn't do was add the water.  We filled a pitcher with ice and poured the mix on topl   I snuck in (the husbund) I agree that this is a good mix and as you all can see, it can be tweeked to fit your needs. . . oh, we are out, got to go.

I decided to try these based on the rave reviews.  I'm a beer drinker, but thought this would be a great party drink.  I made it according to the recipe, except I followed the advice of some other reviewers and substituted diet lemon lime soda for water.  A little sweet, but a refreshing summer drink.  Thanks for a change of pace recipe!

These were terrible - I was so excited to try this out and the people I wanted to share them with are beer drinks so I thought, great - WRONG.  Nothing like margaritas and too strong of lime.

We take these to parties often and they are always a hit. The only thing I do different now is add 4oz. Triple sec. It just makes it a smoother drink. 
Thanks!

YOU MUST TRY THESE! Do it! NOW!  These are so good. The only change I make is to use 7-Up/Sprite (or any lemon-lime soda) instead of the water. The last time I made it I used Sam Adams Summer Ale  (brewed with lemon peel - yum!). Basically any light beer would do the trick. I'm not even a beer fan and I LOVE these margaritas. You don't even taste the beer.  These are a staple at my summer cook-outs now!

I'm not especially fond of tequila, but I do love these margaritas.  I was skeptical about using the 12ozs. of tequila, but I made it according to the recipe using a "lite" beer in a glass filled with plenty of ice.  I was surprised that no adjustments were needed.  All who have  tried this recipe agreed that this is an excellent recipe. This is the only margarita recipe I will use in the future.

Ok, when I read beer on the list of ingredients I was a bit leary, but, I served this at a 4th of July bbq and everyone LOVED these! I used Sauza gold tequila and Michelob Ultra cactus lime beer. Also added a splash of seltzer water on top, which was a nice little something extra. I will definitely make these again!

LOVED THIS DRINK!!!!  I used corona Lite for the beer and Diet Sierra Mist instead of water.  The beer should be added last after blending the all the other ingredients.  (I don't like beer and I could not taste the beer at all.) Just an important NOTE.. you cant stop at just one pitcher....

This is my favorite margarita recipe!   I usually use Corona or Corona Light, and add fresh lime juice to mine.  And to cut the sweetness, I add orange juice instead of water.  These have become VERY popular in my neighborhood!  I can't wait to use the Bud Light Lime as someone suggested. Yum!

This is an amazing recipe. I followed it exactly,using Corona Light as the beer. It was absolutely perfect, and I would not recommend making any revisions to the recipe. I think substituting lemon/lime soda for the water would make it too sweet. I used a generous amount of fresh lime for each glass. I have been using a frozen margarita mix for many years, but I won't need to anymore. This is definitely going to be the only way I make margaritas from now on!

This is a dangerously delicious recipe. It's light and doesn't make you feel full and bloated, but still packs quite a punch.  I made a 5 gallon pail for a party and it was guzzled in no time.  Everyone loved it!

We used Natural Light for the beer and substituted Diet Sierra Mist for the water. It was fantastic and the cheapest margaritas you can make! Wonderful!

I will definitely NOT be able to go back to regular margaritas! I'm a huge fan of carbonation so it tantalized my taste buds, but not my husband's. After awhile the drink grew on him though...especially after enough Tequila! I used Diet 7-up instead of water and also added just a little bit of Rose's Sweetened Lime Juice to the finished product to sweeten it up a little. But you know the most surprising fact of it all is that I could not take the beer! The beer added a smoothness to the drink and I just used Busch Light. In fact, I increased the amount of beer to make it even more smooth and still didn't taste it!

I looooove beergaritas.  This one is delicious.  I also added triple sec because I had it, but it really didn't need it.  The drink was 5 stars as is.  This will be my official summer drink.

We make these using a Bud Light with Lime -- delicious!  And we have tried different brands of tequila and nothing compares to Jose Cuervo Traditionale.

It was good, but I tasted the beer and am not a beer fan. I used a light beer. I also tryed with Mike hard Limeade in place of the beer and it was really good.

ok..this was VERY delicious as the recipe goes..BUT~ to make it even better I accidentally bought the Miller 64 Lemonade one day and as a beer it sucked..so..I decided to use them up by making them the beer in the recipe.  I now buy them specifically for beergaritas!  great recipe!

Made these for company a few weeks ago.  Great warm weather drink!  I used a little less liquor, and a little more water...only because I was running low on tequila.  Everyone loved it!

I always get asked for the recipe when I make this drink.  Instead of water I use diet Sprite - gives it a little more sparkle, and fresh lime wedges are a must.  YUM!

This is a great recipe!  We loved it but added 2 Miller Lites - we are BEER LOVERS and it helped cut the sweetness.  Try this if you don't like a sweet drink!

These were really good! I made them for a party, and even the beer-haters loved them! This recipe is nice because the margaritas are not overly sweet, nor do you taste the beer or tequila to any great extent. They aren't really strong, so if you are looking for a more potent cocktail, I would up the amount of tequila you use, but the recipe as-is is very good!

I've made these before, but done it "6,6,6".  6oz tequila, 6oz, frozen lime juice concentrate, 6oz beer and a blender full of ice.
Excellent on a hot summer day!!

This was soooo good! I used what I had on hand so it was just a tiny bit different.
I had some beer that my husband and I did not love (it wasn’t a bad beer, just not what we thought it would be) and so I decided to look for a way to not waste it :) 
I used an orange blossom ale and frozen raspberry lemonade instead of limeade. Will make again, especially for summer bbq’s!

These margaritas are awesome!!  Mom shared the recipe years ago.  They're great for having friends over, super easy to make.  I use 7up instead of water.  You can serve them on the rocks or frozen.  You can make them ahead of time but remember - the longer they sit, the stronger they get :) which isn't always a bad thing.  I took them out on the lake last year & they were a HUGE hit!!!

I was seduced by all the good ratings, but found this to be only an okay recipe. This is a good 'restaurant' margarita... an appleby's margarita if you will, but I'm a firm believer that a margarita should have a nice tequila flavor. This recipe this was too sweet and too bitter. Too much limeade. Adding the beer helped a lot, but it didn't all come together as well as I had hoped in the end unfortunately. Definitely good, just not great.

I just decided to make a nice summer drink and while a Margarita is what came to mind I didn't have any Tequila in but I did have Mango Vodka....Followed the recipe but change Tequila to Mango Vodka and then instead of using 12oz water I used 8oz mango juice (Naked brand- tastes great!) and only 4oz water. Also I decided I wanted to make them blended and as per other reviews I mixed everything BUT the beer and then blended with ice and added the beer once I'd put the ice mix in the glasses. Great! Will definitely make again!

These are dangerously delicious!

Just keep the juice concentrate, water/7UP, beer, and tequila in equal proportions and drink up!

Wow...these are really good and strong ;-p They are a tad on the sweet side for me but that can easily be adjusted next time. I used Corona Light and Cuervo. I'd like to try it with a higher end tequila next time. This makes for a light and refreshing margarita...and you don't even taste the beer!

Great margaritas!  I made these for the first time for the 4th of July and they were a hit!  I adjusted the recipe slightly.  I used two cans of beer (Coor's Light) -- one can replaced the water.  I also added a little Cointreau and fresh orange juice.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this all the time except I use 12 oz of 7up instead of water and it's terrific!
I use Corona for the beer.
Perfect for parties, backyard BBQs!

Wow! Great recipe!!! I only had microbrews and Coors Light on hand, so went with the latter. It was still very good, but will probably take the suggestion of others and go with Corona next time. I also replaced the water with Sprite Zero, which made it a tad sweet. Countered that by salting the glasses (fold a paper towel into quarters and soak it in water, pour some kosher/sea salt onto a plate, dab the rim of your cup on the paper towel then into the salt), and they were perfect. Will be making these again tomorrow for our big Memorial Day Bar-B-Que! Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC!!!  My new favorite margarita recipe.  Made them for a party last night with used Sprite Zero, instead of water.  The drink sneaks up on you!!!!  Made the night a lot of fun!  Can't take taste the beer at all.  I am NOT a fan of the sweet mix or bucket mix you can buy in the store.  This recipe has a nice tart/semi-sweet taste and taste more like they do in Mexico. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!

I have been making these Margaritas for years and find that using Jose Cuervo Especial works the Best. Don't go cheap on the tequila, they don't taste as good. I also use a can of Sprite or 7 up. To cut down on the lime taste, add alittle more soda. They DO creep up on ya!

Easy recipe to remember - 12, 12, 12, & 12! but this is the one you'll be using 24, 24, 24 & 24 because the first pitcher will be gone before you know it! Delicious and refreshing - perfect for any get together and for those people who say they don't like beer, they'll never know it's in there.  Enjoy!

My new favorite drink!  I usually cut down on the water just a bit (not a fan of watering down my drinks).  Its also easy to add additional ingredients to make flavored beergaritas.  Sometimes I might add some fruit (peaches or strawberries) or blue curacao or other liquor-- but cut down on the tequila so it won't be overly strong.  

I've gotten my boyfriend and our friends hooked on this drink (us college students are big fans of cheap good drinks).  I made it also for my mom's 50th birthday.  She and her friends were all a bit apprehensive at the thought of mixing beer and tequila (they're not strong drinkers), but were HOOKED as soon as they tried it.  They demanded the recipe and now they all make it for all their get-togethers.

Sorry, this just tasted awful, the beer (I used a light pilsner) was not a good mix for us, we thru out the pitcher and stuck with our Limeade/Tequila/Triple Sec recipe.  You just can't make a good margarita without Triple Sec, and I think the Triple Sec cuts out a lot of the "green color"

I would give this more than 5 stars!  I usually just make them from a mix, but will never do that again.  I did use diet 7 up instead of water and they were just wonderful.

I only used a pint of tequila, which was sufficient, and premixed everything but the beer in a pitcher.  As I poured drinks, I topped them with the Corona Light and gave them a quick stir.

I have found the perfect margarita! The beer seems to cut out the strong limey flavor with out tasting the beer at all. I used Corona beer and will keep using Corona beer for this recipe. I myself would not add anymore water than the recipe calls for. If it's still too limey tasting for you, add a little more Corona. Also, use sea salt or a quality salt for the rim of your glass. Not table salt. If you like margaritas... You're going to LOVE this recipe!

Made these with super nachos for girl's night. Two weeks later and my friends are still talking about how good these drinks are. I thought they were a bit strong. We made them individually so 6oz of everything and 1/4 can of the limeade in each jar. Next time I will cut the tequila in half but I did use a very good quality blue agauva. Bud Light Lime added an extra nice lime flavor.

Made these for Super Bowl and they were a big hit!
Used Corona lite and followed the recipe as shown.  I'm sure we will make these again and again.

These are great! I cute the Tequilla in half and used Corona Extra and you couldn't even taste the alcohol. I would suggest adding just a little pinch of sugar to knock down some of the tartness of the limeade.

These are SO awesome!  I've made these for several parties now, and I worried that they would be too strong.  If you use a light enough beer, you really don't taste the beer at all.  Just beware - these really pack a punch.  I sometimes sub out some of the tequila with triple sec to keep the potency down a little bit.

This is the best margarita I ever had! I made some changes after reading the reviews. I used 1/2 Sprite and 1/2 water...I also used lemonade concentrate instead of limeade. and I used a light beer. I put the mixture in the freezer for a few hours to make it slushy. This is the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a hint of tartness! Perfect!

We have tried different types of beer including Corona Xtra but  we like the taste of a Hefeweizen style beer. A white tequila 100% Agave works best with this recipe.

I followed the recipe & found the marg to be a little sweet.  I added more water and made sure to have it over the rocks. You could not taste the beer at all.  An easy recipe to follow, will definitely make again.

Really easy and refreshing. We ran out of limeade so we used more beer and fresh lime juice which I liked even better.

These are a summertime staple!  We add 6 oz. vodka + 6 oz. tequila.  Because they are strong, we add an additional can of 7-UP with the water.  Believe me, they are still strong, but go a little further!  Try pink lemonade concentrate for a fresh alternative!

When we lived in New Orleans this was called "Gotcha". Only difference was substituting Jack Daniels Bourbon for the Tequila. It sounds awful, but sure warmed you up on a cold Mardi Gras morning. (We omitted the water and the lime).

I've used this recipe many times using crushed ice in my blender instead of the water. Adding an ounce of triple sec gives it a boost. It's a real keeper.

Delicious!  As good as any margarita I've had... I did use very good tequila and Corona Light, and water as was written in the recipe.  It'd be FAR too sweet with soda as some reviewers have recommended.  Dipped the top of my glass in lime juice and then kosher salt.  Fabulous and so smooth!

my friend mixed these up in our hotel room this past weekend for a bachelorette party using one can bud light, one can tequila, and one can sprite zero instead of water. we downed a few pitchers of these before heading out they were SO GOOD. it was my first time ever seeing someone add beer to margaritas but she made a believer out of me!

Great recipe!  I added sparkling lime water to the mix instead of plain water or 7up.  It added the more bubbly it needed and another little kick of lime.  Highly recommend adding a little sparkling water to the mix.  It was so yummy, I had to call a friend to share it with me!

We've been making these at our marina for years as "Marsharitas" because our dock buddy Marsha introduced us to them. 

I like to give Marsharita kits as birthday presents: a gift bag with the recipe, a good bottle of tequila, a bottle of beer, a diet 7-up and (at the last minute) a can of frozen limeade. Everyone always appreciates them, and they're so much more personal than a plain old bottle of booze. I'm in the market for an unrefrigerated substitute for the frozen limeade if anyone has any suggestions.

Have only made 1 batch.  Just because of what we had stocked I opted for diet Sierra Mist instead of water and Miller Lite for the beer. Turned out pretty good, will probably make again.  Refrigerated leftovers were much stronger the following day though.

I do not strain the pulp! I love it :o) This is identical to a local recipe I have called "Lake Martin Lemonade" except it uses 12 ounces of Sprite or 7Up instead of the water. This is a huge improvement that everyone should try!  It's a great drink either way of course ;o)

Fun and easy to make!  I like to add a bit of triple sec to the recipe.

Easy, delicious, PERFECT!  I was skeptical at first, but WOW!  I used Bud-Light Lime as the beer.  Will do it again!

I was SO skeptical of this but now, I'm a believer!!! Count me in among the rest who left rave reviews. These were delicious! I used Corona Light with great results... you definitely want to choose a VERY light beer. Also, I made 2 batches and left one pitcher in the fridge overnight. I must say that the longer it sat in the fridge, the better the taste. Thanks for submitting this one... it was quite a pleasant surprise!

These were awesome!  I did use water and not sprite like other reviewers had suggested, it would have made the drinks way too sweet.  There is plenty of sugar in the limeade.  My husband does not care for margaritas at all, but loved these and we drank these up very quickly while bbq-ing! This is the recipe we will use from now on, and these would be perfect on a hot summer day.

Got this recipe from my husbands client and thought "beer" ugh! But he just went on and on about it, so i tried it. We had friends over and they LOVED them. This is so easy. I made 3 pitchers that night for just the six of us...we were told it was a must to use Corona Extra. I have given this recipe out more times in the last 2 weeks then any recipe of any kind in a long time. It is sooo good!

I couldn't believe how good these were, and easy enough to remember the recipe once you've had a few (pitchers). ;-) I used plain ol' Miller Lite and they were great - I'd bet the quality of the tequila has a lot more to do with the outcome than the quality of the beer so spend wisely! :)

Oh these are sooo good! Be careful--a whole pitcher will be gone in a flash, and they are relatively strong!  I use corona, what better for a margarita? It isn't the prettiest color in the end, but I assure you it will be finished quickly.  Have more ingredients on hand to make a second batch.

When I made these my husband thought I was crazy but he ended up thinking they were the best margaritas he's ever tasted.  I got this recipe from my mother-in-law and the only difference was that instead of 12 oz. of water, her recipe called for 12 oz. of lemon-lime soda in place of that.  Very good!!!

My husband made me use his Sauza silver teq instead of the good stuff because his expectations were low...  He was pleasantly surprised!!!  I used 3 oz less teq and added 3 oz of cointreau.

Loved it!  It makes more than 6 servings so get a large pitcher.  Make sure you buy an extra can of limeade because you will be asked to make a second batch for sure!

I am from Austin, and I drink a LOT of margaritas.  I loved this recipe because it was not sweet, but pleasantly tart.  I hate mixes and usually squeeze my own limes and just add silver tequila and cointreau. This is much easier, less expensive, and almost as good.

This was a good recipe for margaritas.... I think the tequila you use makes quite a bit of difference. We use some middle of the road tequila and if we had used some better stuff it would have came out even better.

The first time I made this, I used Sprite instead of water, as several other reviewers suggested.  We really liked the outcome, however it was a little sweet for our taste.  Last night, I made another batch using the water.  It was better, but still a little sweet, so we added a 2nd bottle of beer.  (We used Miller Chill.)  Delicious!!!!  It was perfect for our tastes, and this is how we'll make it from now on: Per the recipe + a 2nd bottle of beer. :)

Bless you, Bless you, Bless you!! This is the greatest recipe. I made these once and now I feel like having one every night because they are so easy and can last a while (atleast a week) in the fridge. I just used cheapo tequila and cheapo Keystone light beer. I have made them with water and with lemon/lime soda. Both good. Next I will try the Corona instead, another excuse to make them again!

This was fantastic! I used the limeade can to measure the fluids and instead of a full can of tequila, I filled it up 3/4 of the way with tequila and the rest of the way with triple sec for a more complex flavor. It was so delicious! I also used Corona light and Sauza Hornitos tequila. Amazing!

WOW..this is wonderful.  I compared this recipe to margaritas with fresh squeezed lime, and I liked this better.  I have passed this on to numerous people.  Being from San Antonio we like our margaritas with Tex Mex food.  Yummy....

I was floored by how good this recipe was! I served it to friends and my wife, and they all raved about it. Best margaritas since I was in Mexico.

Edit: I have used this recipe for years, but my wife is diabetic so I modified the recipe so it is sugar-free by substituting the limeade with the juice of 4 limes and a cup of Splenda mixed in a cup of water. Turns out great every time.

I made these tonight and they were great!  I used Corona and 6 oz of tequila.  Thanks for this great idea.  Who would have thought?

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  Everyone at my Cinco de Mayo party commented that they went down really smooth and were not very acidic like most margaritas.  I think the beer really mellows them down.  No one could taste the beer....just said they were the best margaritas they'd ever had!

Fantastic! Best I've ever had!I made these for an end of school year stress relief get-together and everyone at the party loved them. I was worried that mixing beer and tequila would cause a hangover, but not at all!

On simplicity alone, this is a definite 5 star, but made as directed, lime is a little strong, and it has a big kick. At 1.5 drinks, the drinker said, "This is number two, right?" As if perhaps it could have been number 3. Asked how they were and got a giggly, "I'm loving them right now!" SERIOUS KICK. :)

I cut the tequila in half (it was all I had on hand) and used lemonade instead of limeade.    If you're not a tequila lover, this is a great variation!

FINALLY! I have tried to find a margarita mix that I like for years.  I followed the suggestions of using 12 oz. Sprite plus about 1/2 can of water and reducing the tequila to about 8 oz. I used Corona Light. I'll be making this again!

Surprisingly delicious! As I prefer blended margaritas, I substitute a full limeade can of ice instead of water and blend. I am now the official margarita bartender!

Wow!  If there are any typos in this blame it on the margartias and not my spelling!  My husband was skeptical, till the first tentative sip--we're hooked.  We used plain ole old milwaukee beer and jose cuervo.  This is the perfect drink for a hot Saturday!  Thanks for sharing.

These were OK, but I could taste the beer.  Maybe I should try 6 oz. beer, 6 oz. of 7up next time.  And probably not so much tequila, it was strong!

I was quite skeptical about trying a margarita made with beer.  Having lived here in the Southwest for the past 12 years, Tucson specifically, I have had my share of margaritas – none to my knowledge made with beer.  However, I thought I would give it a try given the one-posted good review so far.  This skeptic has become a believer.
The beer adds just the right touch of mild carbonation and rounds out the flavor of the margarita.  To be precise, here are the ingredients I used; Sauza clear tequila, Minute Maid limade mix and Samual Adams Ale (happened to be on hand at the time).  I mixed all the ingredients as suggested and poured into a glass filled with ice.  Quick, easy, tastes good and packs a powerful punch.  Thanks Bueno!

I made a few changes due to the suggestions. I used white tequila, limeade, triple sec, juice of one lime, some lemon-lime soda and a Corona beer and crushed ice. Wow! That was soo good! And potent! My friend wasn't sure about the 'beer' part until she tasted it! Then she loved it and said I could come over and make cocktails anytime I want to!

I have made a similar recipe for years.  You must make it the day before, put in one can each of Limeade, beer and tequila and two cans of water, put in the freezer over night.  Makes a great frozen margarita!  We call them Beach margaritas as our family makes them at the beach every year!

Best margaritas ever! Everyone loved these. Definitely will make again and again. Only thing I did differently was only add 8 oz of water and the other 4 oz I used Triple Sec instead of water.

I think we made these at least once a week this summer!  They taste wonderful.  Based on personal preference (and my lightweight status on drinking alcohol!) we cut the tequila in half and added a splash of Triple Sec.

I made it just as written, using Jose Cuervo Silver and Corona Light. It made for a refreshing drink to go with a catered meal from Chipotle. I wasn't sure how much ice to add, and probably diluted the alcohol too much when I added about the same volume of ice as there was liquid. Made 36 quarts (including the ice)and there was not a drop left after 3.5 hours, between 20 people.

Cut the tequila in half, added 1/4 cup of Cointreau and made my own lime simple syrup as I didn't have any frozen limeade. LOVED it. Didn't make it full blast after reading reviews. Tastes great with less tequila.

I've been making this beer rendition of Margarita with the exception of using a full ice tray of ice, and no water. I like it frothy ice cold right from the blender.

I'm famous for my Barbi's Beergaritas!  Skip the water and just use 2 bottles of Corona.  Don't use a blender for this, the beer will foam up and you will have a HUGE mess on your hands.  Been there, done that, LOL.  I make up several batches of these and keep them cold in my large cooler with the spigot at the bottom.  Guests can get ice for their glass and fill up with another beergarita.  Great for entertaining.  These are tangy and tart and you don't taste the alcohol so they go down very easy, they have a lot of alcohol in them, so make sure there are designated drivers for those guests that are driving home.

If you switch out the Tequila and use Vodka instead, they are called "Strip and Go Nakeds."  Just as dangerous.  Don't let anyone tell you weren't warned :)

YUM!  I do NOT like beer, but in this recipe I can't even taste it - yet it gives an added flavor to the margarita that just makes it even better!  I used MGD beer and Tequila Silver - perfect!  I would not change a thing about this recipe - it's not overly sweet which is perfect for me.  To store the leftovers, I just poured the rest into 8-oz mason jars and put them in the freezer to enjoy later!

Used water as recipe said and cannot imagine using 7up because it is already so sweet. Want to try with a better quality tequila next time and maybe with white tequila.

This is my go-to margarita recipe to make at home. I follow it exactly and they always turn out super tasty. It's a very smooth and mellow taste, so proceed with caution. I always serve with a salt-rimmed glass.

These were awesome! I made them for a mexican dinner party and everyone loved them. We actually had to go back out and buy more mix and tequila to make more. We did use 7-up instead of water. Will be making often. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  Perfect margarita.  You can even freeze it uncovered and drink off of it for days/weeks.  When frozen, makes a nice slushy.  Others say it is strong, if too strong for you, add more water or don't drink as much.

Great, easy margarita recipe! I used a very light beer,silver tequila and water with the limeade.  Still a little too sweet for me so I added some sparkling lemon-lime water to my individual serving. Perfect!

Yes made this last weekend and it was very good. I used 7-up in place of the water and added about 1/2 cup of triple sec. Mixed the beer in and stirred, served it over ice and very happy with the results. I am making them again this weekend and can't wait. It was not to sweet at all with the 7-up. So easy to make a pitcher and relax with company. Thank you for posting! PS I hate beer and could not taste the beer. Used a light lime beer. My new favorite summer drink.

We served these last weekend and blended in a VitaMix blender.  I eliminated the water, due to the large quantity of ice and added a splash of Cointreau.  Restaurant quality drink!!

Thank you so much for this recipe!!! These are the most delicious margaritas I've ever had!Tthe only changes were using water instead of soda and using corona light - I'm trying to watch calories. Everyone I share these with loves them, as well!

I'm not usually a margarita drinker, so I was skeptical about trying this recipe for a cinco de mayo party. These were a huge hit w/ guests and 4 batches later we ran out!  I used corona, which I think complements the flavor of the limeade best.  My new go to recipe!

Absolutely the best margaritas I've ever had! My friends said the same! DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES!! Follow recipe exactly... I would imagine adding sprite or 7up would make it too sweet. Be warned though, these margaritas are potent. So if you like a less tequila taste, start with 8oz, and add according to your taste :) Yum!!!

Most requested drink.  Make with Jose Silver Tequila, Bud-Light Lime, Squirt instead of water.  Tinted them green for St Patricks Day.  Have also substituted Smirnoff Ice for the beer and Ruby Red Squirt for the soda/water.  Combinations are endless!

I'm 66 years old and remember my then-boyfriend-now-husband making a variation if these back in the day.  Back then it was whiskey sours -- same method, just whiskey instead of tequila.   Always the hit of the party!!

Simple and tasted just like a margarita you'd have at a Mexican restaurant.  Still it wasn't anything overly exciting.  The simplicity makes it worth trying though.  All I had to do was buy limeade at the store and it was ready to be made.

Made these for a party. The store didn't have limeaid, so I used frozen margarita mix and added lime juice. I think this recipie is very forgiving and you can mix to your taste. I used corona light and an inexpensive white tequila. Everyone was hesitant about the idea of combining beer and tequila, but everyone liked the results! I will make them again!

These are awesome!  Not sickeningly sweet like other margaritas usually are.  Perfect mix of flavors. Used Patron Silver and Michelob Ultra.  Delicious!

The easiest, best margarita recipe EVER. I don't like it very sweet, so I cut back on the limeade and add more water (or tequila!). You can also use many types of frozen juice concentrate to shake things up a bit. SO easy to make for a party -- pour everything in a pitcher and serve!

I learned a simular recipe when I was living in Texas. The only ingredient I did not use was the water...triple sec was what I used. Plus I used less tequila than what this recipe is calling for. They are delish!

OMG...these are awesome...we only had a lager and yet was still great...color a bit off but not bad. I did add diet sprite instead of water. So refreshing on a hot summer night.
Update: We have  had these so many times, we still use our favorite beer. but don't like too much sugar and discovered club soda is the best replacement for the water. Cheers.

These were a bit hit at my BBQ! I subbed sprite zero for the water. I also topped each drink off with some sprite to take the edge off (they were STRONG before I did that!).

Simply has to be the best!  Forced to give recipe to all my friends who tried it!  Easy to remember; no fuss, no muss, just mix and enjoy.  For those who like a lesser-strength margarita, add extra water & still tastes great!  Thank you; thank you; thank you.

Delicious!  We had a huge party for 50 people and went through around 3 gallons of it.  People were raving about the Margaritas and they were shocked to find out the beer.  You cannot taste it.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  A must try!

I've made these at least 7 times since Super Bowl 44. Everytime I have a gathering, it is the most requested drink. I took another reviewer's suggestion and use 7-up and Corona Extra.

It was hard for me to first make this because of the weird list of ingredients... but WOW I'm glad I did. It works out perfectly. I can't even get a better margarita than this even when I go out to dinner! The only other thing that makes this recipe perfect is to wet a paper towel and dip the glass rim in it and then to dip it in salt. Thanks for posting.

Amazing recipe! Doesn't have a beer taste, and isn't sickeningly sweet like so many margarita mixes! I've made this 3-4 times for summer parties and it's been a huge hit every time.

holy cow! my hubby and i decided to stay in this friday night and make street tacos and fish tacos on the grill out by the pool. i just made these and ive already got a buzz taste testing them! i have them in a ziplock container (like another user suggested) in the freezer so they can slush up. you might ask "well why didnt you just add ice and blend them?" for one i didnt want to dirty up the blender because ive already made a huge mess and for two (like another user said) who the heck puts water in a margarita? i used the original fresca flavor and these are perfect. we don't have big sweet- tooths' so i imagine sprite/7up would be too sweet for us because the limeade is very sweet. i used corona light beer. i also used a lime to rim 2 glasses and then put salt & sugar on the rims. the glasses are now in the freezer chilling.  THESE ARE THE BOMB and i will make again and again.

I have been making these for a few years and boy are these popular!!  The key I found is to mix them and have it sit overnight~much better flavor!  As I am not big into strong drinks I only use half the tequila and corona for the beer.   Super tasty!!

This was Awesome!! Not too sweet and tart. I was a chicken though and didnt use all 12 oz of tequila. I used probably 7oz. It was so easy to make. This is going to be my 1st choice margarita recipe from now on.

These were okay, probably would be good for a party because they are easy to make, too sweet for us and we didn't think they were strong.

Awesome if you like margaritias. I have tried them with Corona and they turned out very good. (it is also adds extra taste if you use a mixture of sugar and salt around the rim).

Easy peasy limeade squeazy!! I was leary of making this, but after reading the reviews and talking to people who have made these, wow!  What a pleasant surprise and yummy too. I added half Fresca half water, that was the only thing I did differently.  Will be making these for Superbowl tomorrow.  Would be good as a tailgate party drink.

Delish!  Super easy & tastes great.  The only bad thing is that the limeade settles to the bottom of the pitcher, but just keep stirring & it's all good.

I have made this recipe for years and I never added water or 7-up. Just Lime Tequila and Beer and Ice Cubes and then BLEND! Don't water it down.

This is a great idea.  The beer cuts out the too sweet and overwhelming sour that leaves your stomache wishihng you hadn't gone there.  I'd skip the pop because it makes it too sweet and masks the booze,  and add a few onces of triple sec.  If you can't taste the booze its too weak.  It is an alcoholic beverage after all, not juice in a box.

I had to make this with frozen lemonade since I couldn't find the limeade.  As another member had suggested, I added the juice of a lime in it.  For more lime taste, I also added the zest of the lime.  I made it the night before and strained the zest out before serving.  Great taste and easy to make.   I substituted the water with 7up.  It was a hit.  Thanks.

These beer margaritas are awesome! Instead of water I put in Sprite and added diced limes in the bowl. The guests loved it! Served it in tall glasses, decorated with salt, slice of lime and a straw.   I served margaritas with enchiladas and the dinner was an absoulte success! :)

A tiny bit on the sweet side for me so I added 1 - 1 1/2 tsp of lime juice per glass (2-3 tablespoons, if you're doing the whole batch at once, or 1 to 1 1/2 fresh limes).  All this recipe needs is a fancier name. Will definitely keep this one in my bar rotation.  Cheers!

This is a great drink! I made it with a few of the suggestions in the ratings, like using 7up instead of water, corona for the beer, and using a white tequila. Nobody believed me when I told them there was beer in it. Be carefule, these are so delicious you may not be able to stop, you may wake up with quite the hangover.

I liked these A LOT.  I used a little less beer because I was afraid of the beer taste, but other than that, I went by the recipe.  I would recommend making these if you like your margaritas a little bit sweet.  These are both sweet and tart.  If you don't like that, try another recipe.  I will definitely make this one again, next time maybe even using 7UP in place of water, but still... very good as is...  It's better than any of the others on this website that I've tried.  Thanks for submitting it!

Made for the first time last night for company.  The verdict = Awesome!   Added one 12oz. Sprite in place of the water and used Corona for the beer.  Will make again & again.  Thanks!

I got rave reviews for making this for 100 people last night at an event I do.  I purchased a $19.00 5 gallon insulated beverage container at Home Depot and used the all recipe calculater for 75 servings.  It was so easy to replenish during the evening the evening.  I hate, hate beer and was very nervous about trying this for such a big event.  I asked tons of people what they thought the secret ingredient was...and nobody guessed.  You can't taste the beer at all!  I used Bud Light Lime and left lime wedges and an ice bucket next to the thermos.  Super yummy margaritas and a ton of happy people!  This was the perfect complement to the BBQ dinner we served.

I made this for a birthday party this pass weekend and it was a big hit!I made it in advance, about 6 hours, then served it over ice. I quadruple the recipe, used 1 can of 7up and 3 waters. Turned out perfect! Not a drop left!

Everyone that has ever tasted this recipe has loved it.  It's my all time favorite margarita mix.  It is very much requested.  Occassionally I'll cut down on the tequila.  It is very potent.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh yeah - this went down DA BOMB with my guests.  I doubled the recipe for eight people and should have tripled it - a double recipe was gone in about an hour.  I followed the recipe exactly but added one can of diet sprite to a tripled recipe - I thought it was just a smidge too tart and the diet sprite took care of that.  I floated sliced limes and lemons in the drink and it looked really pretty.  Served over rocks.  Everyone thought it was the best margarita they'd ever had and they couldn't believe the beer was in there!  You can't taste it at all!  Only down side was a friend with wheat allergy couldn't partake due to beer (but the rest of us enjoyed her share...).

When I made this for about the fifth time, I realized I hadn't ever rated it!  Since I like my drinks strong (and short), I don't add the water--just serve it on the rocks.  Corona is my choice for the beer.  It's nice to have a jar of this in the freezer, ready to go!

This recipe makes yummy and very strong margaritas! I used 6oz. water and 6oz. of Sprite Zero instead of 12oz. of water, and I used Corona Lite for the beer. I made this for a party and I had to water my own glasses down a bit, but several guests said they liked it the way it was.

very good margarita.  I followed recipe but used a cheap tequila and wasn't impressed, it was ok.  The second time I used El Jimador tequila and club soda instead of water and it was so much better, could not taste the beer at all. Used Budlight and Minute Maid limeade.  Good stuff and a keeper.  Thanks.

Served these over the weekend for a party -- went over great!  I used 6 oz water, 6 oz diet sprite, and then used about 10 oz tequila, and topped it off with 2 oz triple sec.  Definitely use Bud Light Lime for the beer as you get that extra lime flavor and you cannot taste the beer at all!  great!!!!

We had a Tequila tasting/Margarita party last night and we were really skeptical about this recipe.  After the first taste we were blown away!  Bravo!  This is a keeper!   I must say, Allrecipe's 5 star rating (with at least 50 ratings) has NEVER let me down!

I made this for my Cinco de Mayo party and it was a big hit.  I made four batches exactly as written and all were consumed.  I made two of the batches in advance and put them in a pitcher (except for the ice and lime.)  It made it easy to just pop it in the blender, add ice and garnish with lime at the time of the party.  People were surprised to hear that it had beer in it.  Instead of a lime wedge, I floated a slice of lime on top of each glass.

OH MY GOD.  These are AMAZING!  I made them last night for Cinco de Mayo and they ROCKED!  I went to the beach last week and had the BEST margaritas ever and was hoping to find a recipe that could match what I had there.  THIS IS IT!!  I agree with the person who said to add light mexican beer tho...I added dos eqquis (sp??) and, although it was so yummy, it made the margaritas turn a weird color.  I am going to make these again and again! :-)  THANK YOU!

I make these all the time, especially in the summer and they're soooo good. Even people who don't like beer or tequila like them! I'm a tequila snob so I always use Patron. Usually use Corona for the beer part. I usually do Sprite or club soda for the h20. Sometimes I'll add a splash of Patron Orange liquor or some Midori. After doing these for so long, I don't think I even remember how to make a 'regular' margarita!

Our son(a college grad)first made this recipe for us; it's the best margarita I have ever drank, even better than the top shelf variety. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

These are awesome - I like to use diet 7-up instead of the water and usually use Corona as the beer. Make sure you have enough for 2 batches!! These are better than you'll expect them to be!

Wonderful recipe. I made this for a party this summer, and they were a HUGE hit, and I have been requested to make them many times since then. 

I like margaritas with triple sec, so I use 3/4 tequila and 1/4 triple sec, sprite and follow the recipe as instructed. 

These are good the next day too.

Excellent! Big hit at parties! I use ice instead of 12 oz. water. I also put mixture in the freezer for a while to make it slushy. I always have people ask me for the recipe.

Very, very good.

I took Dena's suggestion and used margarita mix instead of using limeade, as that was all I had on hand, and left out the water. I also used Corona and Tarantula tequila. I was surprized at how tasty it was. Very smooth goin' down.

I prefer to use Mr. and Mrs. T's Margarita Mix instead of the frozen Limeade - eliminates the need for water also, but depends on how you like it.  I like it on the rocks, and with a good shot of beer, this margarita definitely ROCKS!!

Great recipe! I made it as directed except I left out the water. My new way of making margaritas from now on. I only had Natural Lite beer, next time I will definitely make it with Corona! Use a good tequila for sure! I used Milagro Reposado.

This has to be the "Perfect" margarita!  Absolutely wonderful!  We use either Chill or Corona Light as the beer and good tequila like Patron.  Can't wait to have them again!!!!!!!!!

I have made these multiple times using whatever beer I have on hand.  Very easy recipe to remember.  They aren't too sweet either.  Corona beer made the best!!

Consuming this as I review.....Outstanding! This is perhaps one of the best Margaritas I have ever tasted. I will most likely never make a Margarita any other way. It's hassle-free to make, and very, very easy to have more than one...or two..or...three.....or.....

These are easy to make and has a great taste. Very simple, just measured all the rest of the liquids in the limeade tube since it is 12oz.  Keeper! :)

Oh heck yeah. Once you have a margarita with beer in it, you will never go back. I bought a tall can of Tecate beer and added a touch more than the recipe called for. Other than that, I followed it to a T.  Not too sweet, not too sour. Perfectly refreshing!

I doubled the recipe, 24oz corona, 24oz diet sprite, 24oz tequila, and 2 frozen limeades.  I put it all in a punch bowl, cut up some lime wedges.  Served ice and margarita salt on side, it was awesome.  Everyone loved it.

I'm afraid I have to be the odd-one out on this recipe.  I followed as stated, plus the 7-UP-for-Water substitution suggested in other reviews.  My crowd found it way too sweet.  Perhaps without the soda this would not be so bad, but overall I doubt I would prefer it to the traditional recipes (not to be confused with the pre-made "mixes", which I avoid.)

Very good!  I am not a big mixed drink fan, but this one is great.  I used Sprite Zero instead of water (think it might have been too dull without it) and Corona Extra.  They are easy to drink (I had several *blush*)and the perfect refreshment after a long hot day working in the flowerbeds :>)

Thanks for this recipe, these were delicious!  No one could believe there was beer in them.  Very authentic tasting.  I only added half the amount of tequila (lightweights!)and it was still very good.   We'll be having these often.  Plan on doubling the recipe if you have more than a few people.

This  are amazing margaritas. Folks always drink it down and ask for the recipe when I make it. I mixed everything together then froze them to make slushes. They were awesome for a hot TX day. Thanks for sharing!

Made exactly has written and they are great. Definitely no beer taste; used Corona Light. They taste just like something you'd get in a Mexican restaurant & they're so easy!

Perfect!  Big hit every time I make it.  People can't believe there is beer in there.  My favorite is to use Carona Lite.

With the changes that I made, I give it 5 stars!  I blended the Corona Light, Tequila, limeaid with ice in the blender and added a little bit of Triple Sec.  It made a huge batch and I tossed the leftovers in the freezer!  Mmmm!

Quick and easy.  NOT the best I've had but they'll do.  I HATE beer but I couldn't even taste it!  One pitcher between my fiancee and I and we were done!  I read the reviews and used 7up instead of water and added a little Grand Marnier...

This is a very interesting recipe. As other reviews stated, we used white tequila and Corona.  We also added some sprite to it.  It was good but not something that I would write home about.  we will try it again I'm sure.  Cinco De Mayo probably.  I will say this - take it EASY while consuming these.  I couldn't really taste the tequila and we'll just leave it at that!!

Too good!  Delicious Margarita taste-- even better than the bottled mix.  The ingredients are so easy to remember, you can make it anytime.  (Similar recipe to the delicious "Summer Beer" on this Website-- just substitute lemonade for the limeade and vodka for the tequila!)  Great party drinks!

The recipe is good as is but several of the variations already mentioned have proved delicious as well- Try a can of 7-Up instead of the water, and add a little Triple Sec to the mix for a true margarita flavor. You can't go wrong with these! We call them Beer-garitas.

I made a half batch of these to try last night.  The first taste I wasn't so sure, but then before I knew it I had gone through two glasses!!  These are great!!  But for me, adding an equal part of water would have made them too watery, so I just added a splash of water to my glass.  So easy and good...thanks!!

These were really light and tasty.  I actually expected them to be packed with more of a punch, but they were middle of the road in alcoholic content.  Seemed as though everyone who had them at a Mexican Fiesta/Memorial Day party really liked them!!!

These were excellent!  I made them on Cinco de Mayo for my brother's fiancee's graduation party.  She said she hated margaritas, so my mom made sure to have other beverages available and only bought one container of limeade.  Turns out my bro's fiancee liked the margaritas a lot after all!  They were quite good and enjoyed by all, including my husband, who is a margarita connoisseur.  I made one recipe and because we were all using a lot of ice and 6 oz glasses, we got about 12 servings out of this recipe.

Like other reviewers, I too used about 3/4 of a limeade can of tequila and 1/4 can of triple sec.  My beer of choice was a Corona and I used just plain old water for the "water" ingredient.  I couldn't imagine adding 7-Up or Sprite (even diet) because these were pretty sweet to begin with.  I like a tart margarita, so I adjusted the flavor by squeezing a lime into my glass of ice before pouring in the drink.

I will definitely make these again.

We loved these. I was looking for a margarita recipe that did not have Cointreau in it as it was $40 a bottle and I didn't want to spend that much. I wasn't sure about the beer but now I will never make them another way. I did make two changes. I measured 3/4 of a limeaide can full of tequila (9 oz) and filled the can the rest of the way with triple sec (3 oz) and I used 2 ice cold bottles of Corona Light. I also threw in some thin fresh lime slices. I let the pitcher set in the 'fridge for a little while so it got really cold. They were so good "on the rocks" with crushed ice. Careful...they go down way too fast and will sneak up on you. Good news...no tequila headache the next day!

YUMMY!! I told my brothers about these and they were hesitant to try them, but once I made them, they couldn't get enough! Now every time we get together they ask me to make them.  The recipe is so easy to remember and u can use the limeade can to measure the tequila! I used 7up insted of water. DELICIOUS :)

These are the best margaritas you'll ever have.  They definitely have some kick.  Great on a warm summer night.

WOW! I really wasn't expecting this to be any good, but I had the ingredients so I made it anyway. I was really surprised. This was really good. I only used half of the tequila because it was all I had. I used about 3/4 of the water and everything else was as instructed. I'm on my 2nd glass...buzz buzz. So if disreguard any spelling errors.

I think the flavor is actually about 4 stars, but the fact that these were so easy brought it up to 5 stars.  We just made them on a whim and it was so simple.  I want to try them frozen, too- I'm planning on using ice instead of the 12 oz water and just toss them in the blender.  Should be good!

I was the most popular gal at our camping potluck when I started making these!  Someone had a magic bullet so we blended them to crush the ice.  They were delicious, the beer cut the tang of the limeade for a perfect margarita flavour.    Because there were many of us drinking I cut the tequila to 9 ounces and used 3 ounces of water.  Still perfect!  I can't wait to make these for my friends here at home.

These were just okay.... very watery.. maybe using a margarita mix instead of frozen lemon-lime juice would have been better.

after making these countless times, i finally have to rate this recipe.  these are fantastic, but the concept alone of adding beer to other recipes/mixes is what is great.  thanks a lot for sharing - we absolutely love these!

I have real margarita glasses that were in storage, and after tasting my first sip of these I had to get them out and use them for the rest of the pitcher.  This is by far the best Margarita I have ever had - and I bartended for many years and made many different variations of Margarita.  I used Corona and Bacardi frozen Margarita concentrate.  These are dangerously good!  I also used a gold tequila.  Thanks Bueno!

Wow - I had heard rumors of a margarita recipe with beer...but until I tried it, I was skepical.  Man, it is sooo smooth and great.  Watch out.  Easy to drink...and just one was enough to start feeling it.

What a great discovery!  I adjusted the recipe a little to suit our tastes.  We are such lightweights these days, that 1/2 a glass of this gave us a little buzz.  Next time, I would use 1/2 to 3/4 the amount of tequila.  I doubled the amount of water and used 1/2 more can of beer.  The flavor is jsut like  that of a real margarita.

El mejor margarita siempre.  Esto era delicioso!  I think I said "best margarita ever.  This was delicious!"  I made two pitchers - one with limeade concentrate and one with cranberry concentrate.  I used Corona beer.  (Both of these ideas were from other reviews!)  We truly enjoyed both pitchers - I'm moving a bit slow today - maybe we enjoyed them TOO much!  Will do again.

I made this with Blue Moon Beer.  Yum!  So smooth and tasty.  Couldn't fit the full 12 oz of tequila in b/c my blender started to overflow.  I probably squeezed about 9 or 10 oz in there.  This makes more than 2 glasses - I had to pass some out to the neighbors.  Very fast and easy to make.

We used to make these all the time but we called them Beergaritas.  Three bottles of beer, one can of frozen lime juice and a third of a 26 (750ml for you yankees) of tequila.  We would have a couple jugs of these and get completly snaked out.

I used to work in a bar and decided to make this drink.  2 Shots of tequila,2 bottles of beer and lime juice to top it up.  Cut it into two glasses and enjoy.  I was passed out on a golf course and in bed by 10pm after a few of these one night.

Terrific drink.  almost as snakey as absinthe

This is good, however, with a couple of changes, I would easily rate this with 5 stars.  I would cut in half both the beer and sprite (instead of water as suggested by others).  With the full cans, it takes away the bite of the limeade that I love.  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for the post!

I am sipping this now, and it's happy hour perfect! I really wanted to try this recipe but only had the frozen orange juice concentrate on hand so I took a chance and made a half batch, squeezing in a bit of fresh lime juice. It might be a tad sweet because of the orange, but I will try it with the limeade next time. Thoroughly enjoying this one!

I have a similar recipe called "Mambo Margarita" Instead of water I use lemon-lime soda. You can do it in a pitcher as directed or put the limeade, ice and tequila in the blender. add the soda and beer after. Either way, these are the best margaritas!

This is super easy and good for a crowd. I like that you can use the limeade can to measure the tequila and water, too. I made mine in the blender, with extra ice, and added a Corona beer after blending to avoid fizz-over. I also tried a version with frozen strawberries in place of some of the ice. Very fruity, and not beer-y at all!

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone at our BBQ was intrigued by the name and wanted to try them, and everyone agreed that was a pretty darn good margarita - especially when it only had four ingredients!

Why would you water down a drink, add a can of squart pop. Been making them this way for years. Would give it 5stars with the squart.

I sent this recipe to my son.  He tried it and now makes it every time he has company. I wasn't sure if I would like it but when I went to visit he made it for me.  I loved it.  Next get together that I have I will definitely be serving this.

Great Diet Margarita. We make the beer Margarita starting with a dry package of diet lemonade, (2qt.size) and add a couple of oz of lime juice. A little triplesec and then the small bottle of Corona, add the White Tequila and water to total 2 c.  Usually I use equal amounts.  Blend and enjoy a very low calorie version of a margarita.

I thought it was very good! I used lemonade concentrate and lemon-lime soda. The lemon-lime soda made it a bit sweet but as the ice melted, it was better.

When I was choosing a new cocktail recipe to make for dinner last night, I immediately went past this one. Not a particular fan of regular margaritas, prefer the fruity variety. However, it was for date night with hubby and he likes traditional margaritas, so I backed up and decided to try it since it had such a complimentary rating. It was absolutely SUPERB!! After one sip, we both agreed that it was restaurant grade stuff! We did use Sprite instead of water, as suggested by another reviewer. Perfection and you couldn't taste the beer as I was concerned about that. Will make this again and again! Thanks for posting!

I used corona light, diet 7up, cut the limeade to 6 oz, and added 2 ounces of triple sec to the recipe. Awesome. My wife and I thought they were too sweet the first time with 12oz of limeade, but the reduction was perfect for our taste. I may reduce tequila next time due to potency, not taste. lol

Made these for a friends BBQ last week. They were just okay. Didn't really cut the sweetness and weren't very strong. By the third batch, i have to admit, i was mostly mixing beer and tequila! Would definitely whip up again though. They were still a huge hit.

So I forgot the Sprite; I used 12 oz lemonade since that's all I had. I also found some frozen pureed mango in my freezer, added that too with an extra ounce or so of tequila.  What an awesome Cinco de Mayo bebida, delicioso!

Wow!  I am not sure I will ever make margaritas with margarita mix again.  These were perfect, and even those who didn't want a margarita started drinking them after tasting one.  I subbed ginger ale for water and used Corona light for the beer.  Only added ice to the glasses, not the pitcher.  My only major suggestion is to buy more limeade so you can make more than one batch because these will go quick!

this was a good alternative to a traditional margarita.  Was waaay too sweet for my liking, so I added another beer, a splash more tequila and lots of ice and that did the trick.

Delicious! Because I cannot leave anything alone and I like my drinks on the sweet side, I added maraschino cherry juice and coated the rim in sugar. Loved the color and flavor.

Delicious! This is a super quick and easy recipe, double it and use a big pitcher for summer gatherings :) Can easily be adjusted using less tequila or more water.  I used Bud Light Lime and the extra lime kick is great! The adults will enjoy a pitcher or two of these with our Mexican Cinco De Mayo meal!

I've had this recipe forever from my parents but with one big change. Use rum instead of tequila. Then it is called a Boomerang. And it's much better since tequila and I don't get along! Very potent!

Swap the water with two more beers (three beers total); Corona is usually the go-to.  Been making them like this for years and they're delicious!

We've made these several times now and they are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and it's good the way it is written but we've also tried it with coconut rum instead of the tequila and it was just as good.

Hottie you are spot on. Add a 12 oz can of sprite or 7-up. I have been making these for quite some time and never heard of adding water. Definitely use Corona Extra.

Super Sweet!  It was a bit much.  I need to read other reviews to what they used.  I can see how it could be very good.  Maybe more beer/water and less limeade.  As the recipe stands, though, it is just too sweet.

I love, love, love this recipe. A friend brought them over for a barbeque and I have been searching ever since for the recipe. I agree, Corona is the best for this recipe b/c it goes so well with lime.

This is the absolute PERFECT mix of alcohol.  Who would have thought that beer would be the secret ingredient to a margarita, but it is!  I used Sam Adams Summer Ale.  Beware though...these pack a punch!

Very good and very easy to make.  Just don't forget to add the water.  Yikes!  My first batch was strong and I kept wondering if I added the water or not.  After second batch, I made sure to add the water and it was less strong.  Either way, yum!

Made these individually this past week for Cinco De Mayo.  They were excellent, the only change we made was to eliminate the water and add a splash of 7up.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

We make this all the time with a few changes.  We always use one bottle of Corona, one can of Fresca (not as sweet as 7-Up or Sprite), 12-oz frozen limeade, and fill the limeade container 1/2 to 3/4 full of Tequila.  Freeze in a flat Tupperware container and you'll have slushy drinks to enjoy. I absolutely hate the taste of beer and I love these, and why would anyone add water to a margarita!

I've been making these for years.  We call them "Skip & Go Naked"!  We use 7-up instead of water or Sprite.  Sprite was a little too sweet.  Great recipe with great results!!!

Make these with ginger ale instead of the water and it cuts the sweetness and makes these perfect! Delicious but very strong!

So easy and so good!  Not sure if I originally got the recipe from AR, but I have used this for many years, but cut the tequila in half as my preference is not to have such a strong drink.

I have only made this with Corona, we might try it with Corona Light tonight.  Not too sweet, we used salt to rim the glasses.  We went through 4 batches last 4th of July and there were certainly no complaints, only "when are we doing beer margueritas again?"

Love this recipe! I use a Corona Lite and sugar free 7 UP. It keeps it from getting too sweet and has the perfect flavor. DO NOT MAKE IN BLENDER!! Your kitchen will be wearing it all over! I love my pampered chef mix & stir 2 qt pitcher.

A friend makes something similar, and it is delicious. The difference is he doesn't add water, adds ice-cubes instead and a banana. The rest is pretty much the same. He mixes everything in a blender. Yum!

I too was a bit skeptical about the addition of the beer, although there is no recommendation for a particular beer, we had fun mixing that ingredient up.  We made these for my daughter's wedding party, they were a HUGE HIT!!!  Definitely keeping this recipe and will reuse over and over. Thank you for the submission.

This was wonderful! My husband who is always a skeptic when I try to change a tried and true recipe really liked it! I followed the recipe to the letter. I used Miller Lite beer and there was no way you would ever know there was beer in it! I will use this recipe a lot.

Great stuff! This was very easy to make and very tasty. I stuck with the recipe and used water, 7-up sounded good but I didn't want them too sweet. I used Corona for the beer. I'm sure this will become a regular for me over the summer!

For the beer I used Bud Light Lime and it tasted awsome!  My husband thought that it was too sour so next time I won't squeeze the juice from the lime into the pitcher like another reviewer suggested.

These are so good!   I followed the recipes exactly except I added two splashes of triple sec.   I used a Landshark beer.  It is hard to believe that there is beer in this margarita!

I'm not usually a big margarita fan, but these were absolutely amazing. I omited the water and used ice instead for a frozen margarita. My boyfriend and I drank the entire recipe: I was a very happy Cinco de Mayo!

My preference is fresh squeezed lime juice but this is easy for entertaining and not too sweet.  I like to taste the booze in my drink so this ratio was perfect!

This was delicious!  So delicious, in fact, that it can be a little dangerous.  I read on other reviews that using all of the tequila is too strong, so I started with half.  That was too sweet for me, so I ended up adding almost all of it.  Ole!

I like beer, I like tequila, I like lime,...so what's not to like???  I've had these with sprite instead of water and they were very refreshing. Not really like a traditional margarita, but definitely delicious!

really sweet so I added an extra can of water.  also, I divided the tequilla in half and it was still kinda strong.... I could not even imagine adding the whole 12 ounces!  that would have been like a shot!

Since many reviews said these were strong. I decided to only use 6 oz. of tequila. And just added extra water. I am so surprised at how you can't taste the beer. I used Corona Light. It really helps cut the sweetness. A good margarita and much cheaper!

These are the best. Way better than the pre-mixed bottles of margarita, and hardly any more work to make. I used Corona and Jose Cuervo with generic limeade. The only change I made was to tone it down with extra beer instead of extra water. These will sneak up on you FAST!

Honestly this is one of the worst margaritas I have ever had. And believe me I have had a lot of margaritas in my life! I have no idea how it has gotten such good reviews. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it was easy to make. We followed the recipe exactly.  We used Corona for the beer and Patron for the tequila.  We drank the whole pitcher because we didn't want to waste the Patron, but will never make these again.  We will stick with our recipe (Brian's Fresh Margarita).

These ARE super good. I recommend keeping the recipe the same. Lemonade makes it too sweet. We also add extra tequila. Super easy, not too expensive, popular - goes a long way.

I love good cheater recipes....this makes a great margarita.  I did the water thing...not the sprite/7up thing because I love the sour factor in lime margaritas.  It was great.   Also...used corona light but i'm not sure the beer would matter as long as it is not a micro.

These are the perfect margaritas!  Husband was a little leary of them when I told him they had beer in them, but was a believer as soon as he tried it!  I used a light mexican beer.  Can't wait to make again, and again!

I have been making this recipe for years.  The difference is my recipe uses vodka.  Even cheaper! I also add a dash of triple sec. For those that can't tolerate tequila give it a try. it is just as delicious.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used sprite instead of water, cornona and white tequilla.  Very smooth and full of flavor.

Had these for New Year's along with some mexican dishes.  It was like Cinqo de Mayo in December!  Fantastic!  Love the fizz from the beer. Only alteration was I increased the beer to 1.5 bottled and probably could have done 2.

This drink is very good and so easy to put together.  I made it as the recipe states.  If you are expecting a traditional margarita, (like a friend of mine was expecting) it isn't. It's a delicious, different and fun spin on an old favorite.  Enjoy!

I give this a five star because EVERYONE wanted this recipe at our party.  I'm not a huge magarita fan so I am not a fair judge.  I must admit that it is very easy to prepare for a crowd.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

These are a little too good. Make sure to pace yourself because they are so tasty and refreshing you'll be tempted to drink a lot (like I did). I had them a couple of weeks ago and I'm still recovering. lol

I have tried these margaritas before at my sister-in-laws house and remember not being very impressed at all by them.  Sometimes she will improvise too much - so I thought I would follow the directions exactly and see what they tasted like.  The only drink I drink is Margarita's - it does not matter how cold or what we are eating, that is all I drink, so I know a good Margarita...plus I live in Texas and we have lots of Tex-Mex Restaurants that specialize in Margarita's.  Anyway, I did not care for the Margarita's at all and could taste the beer in them.  I had one guest that would flat out not drink it after she tasted it and some other people said that they were "o.k." - So I just don't get all the 5 STARS.  I guess if you know a good Margarita, then this recipe would just rank around 3.

Wow! A great (and quick) margarita recipe. I'm really impressed!!! I usually only like frozen margaritas, but this, served "on the rocks", is perfect. I'm also surprised b/c I do not like beer (of any kind) at all. Made this tonight with salsa chicken and taco rice (recipes on this site). I followed the recipe to a T (no diet sprite / 7-Up here). Used light Corona (accidentally picked up a 6 pack of light beer) and my bf (who is a beer lover) didn't notice a difference in taste. Made 4 servings, but we had WAY more than 4 margarita glasses full (haha!). DEFINITELY a keeper. Thanks!

I made this for book club and was very pleasantly surprised....and I don't even like tequila. Gonna make them again this week-end cause I have a craving. I couldn't decide if I should use water or 7-up so I decided to do half and half. All the girls loved them.

Holy Tequila, Batman!  Made some adjustments the second time around based on the taste of the first batch.  Here's what I ended up with.

I used Corona for the beer.  I'm not a fan of Corona - but it was good in this.  Used Sprite for the water and doubled it.  Doubling the sprite kills the strong limeaid taste.  Used 6 oz of tequila and 6 oz of triple sec instead of the full 12 oz of tequila. 

Very good with those modifications!  And quick too!

These are the best Margaritas ever!!  We add 1 can of diet Sprite and 1 can of Fresca for a not so sweet taste.  We have not tried the recipe with the water, but plan to.

I made this drink today. I can't say it's my favorite or that I'd make it again. The beer added almost a bitter quality to it. The limeade was over powering. I did use 7up as suggested and doubled that, as the lime flavor was just too much. Sorry, but I thought it was a real waste of tequila.

Yummy, yummy, and did I say yummy?  For the first batch, I followed the recipe exactly and everyone thought they were perfect.  The second batch I used 1/2 water 1/2 Sprite, and it was good, but we preferred the recipe just with the water.  Perfect beverage on a hot night.  Oh, I used Corona and Jose Cuervo Especial.  Will be making again soon.

Fabulous!  I couldn't taste the beer at all.  (I used Coors Light).  Watch out, they work fast.  Only took 2 for me to be done for the evening.

This is the first time that I have rated a recipe and we LOVED the margaritas.  I double the batch the night before and did what most reviewers suggested. I used half gingerale and half sprite.  I do not like really sweet margaritas and these came out perfect!  We also used Corona for the beer.  We also just added a lime wedge at the end.  Great and EASY recipe!

WOW!!! My new favorite margarita! Loved how it was so easy to make.  I followed the recipe exact and wouldn't change a thing.  I used Landshark beer.

This is one of the best drink recipes yet--I made it for a Memorial Day get together and everyone loved it!  They couldn't believe there was beer in it!  Beware--this drink does creep up on you!!

SOOO easy!  SOOO good!  I can not imagine replacing the water with pop though.  I like the lime flavor, but I also like my margaritas on the rocks with no salt.  Yes, it may not be a premium margarita I would get at a restaurant, but for how easy these were, I have to think I will enjoy these more, sitting on my deck after a day of working on the lawn. We used the Miller Chill and it was great.  Highly recommended.

Quite yummy and potent. I much prefer a margarita made with fresh lime juice and cointreau,but this is a great way to make margaritas for a party, and do it cheaply. Can't taste the beer!! As written they (without sprite or water) they are on the sweeter side.

I made these last night, adding Sprite in place of the water as recommended by another reviewer.  I don't drink beer and my husband has never liked tequila but we loved this concoction, so much so that we made another batch tonight.  This recipe is perfect to beat the heat and humidity that accompanies our favorite activity ~ Tennessee porch sittin'.  I can't wait to introduce "beeritas" to my sisters at our annual sisters slumber party!

This is excellent. I used to use corona but now I use Miller Chill. The lime & salt already in this beer is a perfect combo! Enjoy!

I'm not a big fan of Margaritas but I made these for our Cinco De Mayo party and they were a huge hit...I loved them as well!  I followed other reviewers and used Corona Light for the beer and made them the night before.  Excellent!!

Perfect margarita! This recipe is a slam dunk! I followed others suggestions and substituted the 7-up for the water and used Corona beer, Yummy! It is our new recipe.

I've made this several times, the first time as posted and the second time I used 6 oz of tequila and 24 oz of Sole beer and that seems to be the better of the two... a must try... these are dangerously delish!

I made these for a pool party this past weekend - EXCELLENT! I was very skeptical when I read the recipe and saw it had beer in it (which I love beer) but the thought of mixing all that together sounded awful. After reading all the rave reviews I decided to give it a try anyway and I'm glad I did! I did substitute 7up for the water and used white tequila and Corona Light. I think next time I might put a little more 7up or some water in it as the limeade was a teeny bit to strong for me.

Ok, we tried what others suggested by using 7up instead of water and Corona or Corona Light for the beer along with the limeade concentrate. I liked it ok with the 7up, but my husband did not. He said that it was way too strong. So, the second time I made it, I used Corona Light, Water (not 7up), limeade concentrate, and only 10oz of tequila. This made it perfect for us.

I made these for the superbowl party.  Everyone loved them, even my mother-in-law didn't have anything negative to say!  I used 7-up instead of water like many of the reviewers said and also used Corona beer.  They are very smooth and delicious!  And they are so easy to make.  Great recipe!

I don't like beer.  My hubby doesn't like sweet drinks.  However, this recipe we can both enjoy.  When I have a small gathering, I mix up one pitcher in advance, and have the ingredients ready for a 2nd/3rd pitcher.  Sometimes one with appetizers is enough, other times we serve it all evening.  Either way I always hear, "This is really good!"  (Best bet ingredients are Corona & Quervo Gold)

These are very good.  I don't like beer or tequila either one, and I loved these. I thought the limeade was just a little strong, but it was still very good. I might add another 1/2 cup of water next time to dilute the limeade a little more.

So simple so good. Great base recipe. I used Coors beer and it was great. I think I added just a bit more tequila but I like my margaritas to pack a punch. Floating a bit of orange liquor isn't a bad idea either - gild the lilly.

Really good as is, no changes. I had a little 'fiesta' and made this to go along with the theme. I used Corona Light and Lunazul tequila.  YUMMY

Awesome!  I made these to take to a tailgating party and they were a hit!  The only thing I should point out is that this recipe only makes 6 margaritas-I had to double it to bring to a party.  I also replaced the water with Sprite. Some people mentioned it was a little tart for them, so I think next time I will use 3/4 of the limeaide and replace the rest with more beer!! 

Thanks for sharing!

Got lots of groans when I said "Beergaritas" but once everyone tasted them I got apologies!  They were gone in a flash!  Used Corona Light and left out the h20.  Great recipe!

This was a great drink recipe--delicious and super easy. I used the 12 oz. of water, let it set overnight (just so I wouldn't have to mess with it the next day while preparing the food) and served it on the rocks with salt and a twist of lime.  I buy the Chi Chi's pre-made margarita mix and this was just as good, better even.  Will definately make again--my friends have requested it!  Be careful.  It packs a punch!

These are awesome Margaritas !  Been making them for years. Substitute Sprite or Diet Sprite for the water.   Makes them a lot better.

These made a big hit.  They taste really great, but they do contain quite a bit of alcohol.  It would be easy to overdo it.

These rocked!  So easy to make and a big hit at the party. I brought a pitcher for my "BYOB" and I had other guests asking to pay me for a cup of it after taking just a sip. (I just shared!)  We did add more beer because it was a little too sweet.  I used Corona and Jose Cuervo Gold.

Wow!  My aunt made these for me, and even though I detest beer I loved these!  She cut down on the tequilla and added Triple Sec, and I think she used bud light.  Now I can use up all the beer that people leave at my house.  Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!

I was skeptical about these, but man, after my boyfriend and I pretty much blew threw the entire pitcher, I realized they were delicious! For being so quick, needing so few ingredients and containing a great balance between sweet and tart, these Beer Margaritas earn all 5 stars!

These are great!  Definitely use a mexican beer - I prefer Corona Light - and I used two beers to cut the sweetness of the limeade concentrate.  I am usually not a big margarita drinker, but these were refreshing, and delicious!!  Will be making these A LOT this summer!

The best! Used this for Cinco De Mayo get together and I was pleasantly surprised to see that all the hype was true! Not that I don't like it, but you can't taste the beer (or for that matter much tequila- I'm not a huge fan of tequila.) So watch out, these are super tasty but will catch up with you in no time. Perfect!

Very tasty and so easy.  I took a pitcher of this stuff to a party and it got rave reviews.  It's pretty sweet but you can always tone it down a bit if it's too sweet as is.  It packs a good punch, just one will make you a happy camper!

Really loved this recipe. It is the first time I have attempted to make margaritas and I don't have to look any further.  I used a light beer and a little less tequila for fear it would be too strong--next time I would use the full amount (what the heck, right?!!)  My only problem with this recipe is I should have tripled it instead of just doubling it!  It went in a flash!  Make it and enjoy!

Wow!  I think this makes a perfect Margarita.  You'd never guess there was beer in it.  Beer just adds the perfect amount of "fizz" to this drink.  If you serve with lots of ice, its not too strong.  I can't wait til summer!  No more store-bought buckets for me.

These were so good!!!  I put the ingredients in a blender (but didn't blend them!) so I didn't have room for the water.  You don't need it, THEY WERE GREAT!!!  I tried these before using liquid limeade, it was better with the frozen limeade.  Thanks for sharing!

superbowl here we come, YAHOO!! ((cough) go bears...)
 we "test" drank these on saturday night and got a whole hearted thumbs up. used cuervo and corona. decreased the tequila slightly (by 3-4 oz)and increased the water by the same so we wouldn't be tanked off one. that did the trick. 
just mixed up a batch now for this afternoon. we did float ours with cointreau, which was yummy. you could certainly do the triple sec or a touch of oj if you wanted as well. delish. thanks for sharing.

I have made these for two parties now, I love them.  The name sounds strange but the taste is fantastic.  Definitely try this!

This is good, but is better with one can of mountain dew instead of the water.

These are so delicious - and so easy I just can't believe it.  Very fresh lime taste...doesn't give you that too sugary taste and occassional heartburn.  I used Corona Light.  However, after 2 pitchers I ran out of Corona and Regular tequila and used Miller Lite and Cuervo Citrico which was very good - more limey but very good!  Thank you so much for this recipe - and my friends thank you too!

My wife and I prefer our margaritas less sweet, so we added 4 nice sized limes to the 2nd batch we made, and it was much better for our taste.  
Overall, these are Great!

EASY - YUM - EASY - YUM! Just my style. I have taken these to 3 different parties lately and I am starting to get sick of the phone calls from people asking for the recipe!! ADVISE: You can get by with less that 12 oz. of tequila. I started using about 8 oz. With 12 oz. I was having to drive too many people home because the margaritas crept up on them because they are so yummy.

These are to die for and so easy to make! The addition of the beer makes these much less sour than a traditional margarita.

Verry good margarita.  A bit strong but good.  Not a good margarita to gulp but good one to savor like fine wine.  Next time will try with little less tequila.  Very good though.

Definately add more water - these are limey!  I used fairly good beer as it was all that was available, so I might try them again with the cheaper stuff! Interesting flavor and people really wondered how I made them!

Very quick and easy and super yummy! I used frozen lemonade and no lime wedges because that's what I had and I only used around a half cup of each because it was just for me while my husband drank the rest of the beer. Not the best I've ever had - I have another recipe that is THE best I've ever had, but definently my first choice when I want to go quick and easy. I couldn't stop drinking it!!

2020 Super Bowl drink.  This was a big hit!! All the guest loved the Beer margaritas. I did add an extra bottle of beer instead of extra H20.  Go Chiefs!!! I will definitely make this drink again.

I love this recipe and make it whenever I have a crowd to serve.  The only thing I change is to omit the water and use Squirt soda for a less sweet grapefruit flavor.  I also always use a splash of Grand Marnier at the end.  So good!!

Nice recipe. I like my drinks strong, so I cut out the water and just added a lot of ice. I also added a little pineapple juice to take some of the sharp edge off. This is a good, easy to make, crowd-pleaser...at least in our household.

It's better when you leave out the can of water.  This has been our margarita recipe for 30 plus years - my husband picked it up when he was in the Navy.  We use Heinekin Beer.

These are wonderful. I’ve been making them for a few years now and everyone always loves them. We love margaritas and have tried so many recipes but this one is by far the best frozen margarita recipe out there!!

I make this all year long, depending on the brand some lime aid's tend to be sweet (Seneca brand) so a squeeze of fresh lime helps. Everyone loves these!

I use Squirt Soda instead of the water or Sprite . It is much less sweet. If you really want to bump it up, add a splash of Grand Marnier.

Family favorite for years.  Its fame has spread so that it's nearly impossible to find Minute Maid Lime Frozen Concentrate (the best)  around certain holidays.  When we find them, we clean out the store and put them in the garage freezer.  We've tried others, but they don't taste as good as M).  Yes, we are hoarding!  So if the "big one" hits, we will be well lubricated.  Delish!

Not quite as good as a regular margarita but really close.  Still prefer the more fruity flavor of a real margarita.  Would make again, especially if out of triple sec.

I used a Sam Adams Boston lager. I did not have frozen line are, so I used frozen lemonade. I also added 12 ounces of orange juice.

A very tasty and refreshing summer drink.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I did not add ice to the entire batch.  I just filled each individual glass with lots of ice and topped with a squeeze of lime.Update:  a splash of orange liqueur takes it up a notch!

I’ve been making a version of this for years. We use 1 small can frozen limeade, 1 small can frozen berry punch, 1& 1/2 cans tequila, 1 bottle beer (12oz) and 1 small can water.

3.9.18  Who knew that beer could be so good in a margarita??  I used Jose Cuervo Gold and a lager, so the color was a little darker than most margaritas, but you positively could not taste the beer in this drink.  Very nice.

We love this drink and I've been making it for about 2 years now. Sometimes we switch out the water for 7up and sometimes we make it exactly as written. Super yummy and easy! One tip, don't buy fancy expensive tequila to make this drink. It's better when you can taste the tequila bite!

Made the original recipe and we loved it.  Squeezing a fresh lime wedge in each drink made it delicious.  May try adding some cointreau next time...

I have made these for years!!!! I use a clear soda instead of water, 7 up, gingerale, whatever - it works. You can adjust it to your liking - add triple sec or whatever. Best tip ever: Freeze left overs in jelly or mason jars - screw the lid on! As a matter of fact - we make them in advance and keep them in the freezer. So much fun to pull one out on a hot day or for a guest!

I never leave reviews. Never. But I made this for July 4 weekend, and I just had to. First off, I am a margarita purist. I really, really love a good one, and bad ones just tick me off. So when I read this recipe, with BEER in it, I expected to hate it. But a friend told me the really excellent Mexican place near her house puts beer in their margarita, so I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used 9oz tequila instead of 12. I ended up adding an extra splash, though, so probably closer to 10 oz. HOLY COW!!! 1000x better than expected! I immediately texted the recipe to everyone I know! This is my new fave. None of the heartburney effect of a normal Rita, and it tastes better than anything I have ever made at home. Hubby and I went through 2 pitchers (since the kids are at Grandpa's)!!  Good times were had by all!

I have been making a version of this margarita recipe for years. It is the best at home mix going. My recipe is a bit different. I will share mine with you. 
1 12 oz can of frozen limeade (save can)
1 12 oz can of tequila (hence saved can)
1 bottle of Cirrona beer, I prefer bud light lime
1 can of sprite ( replaces water)
Stir mixture until the limeade has melted
I pour the mixture i to a large pitcher full of ice.
I have made this in a thermal cooler that has a pour spout and taken it to the lake.  It will last all day in hot weather. 
I have also made the same mixture, with crush ice, in a frozen margarita machine. Either way you will never find a better margarita recipe. Cheers!!

I love margaritas.  I was a little leery making them w/ beer, but after reading the reviews, I gave it a try.  Following other suggestions, I used (diet) 7-up in place of the water.  I was shocked how good these were.  Will definitely be making these again!

I've used this recipe for nearly 45 years. Got it from a bartender at the (former) Village Inn in Coronado Island, CA. Back then we couldn't afford expensive prebottled mixers, or anything like expensive tequila. The beer smoothed out the taste of the raw tequila we bought in Mexico, and the girls and guys loved it - still do! Just adjust the amount of water to your individual tastes. One can of water is a good starting point!

I have made these for many years.  I always add two beers and two diet sprites or 7-up and no water.  I use select 56 and diet pop to cut down on sugar and calories-you won't be able to tell the difference !!

The real recipe calls for equal parts limeade and tequila, a bottle of Corona and 12pz of 7UP and NO WATER!  With these changes it is a 5* recipe and we have a pitcher at most gatherings.  I was told it was the "Red Hat" recipe.

So fun. So easy. Buy lots of limeade. They go quicker than you think. Also best if you have a heavy duty blender.

When I lived in NM we used the same recipe but substituted Vodka for the Tequila and called them Bullfrogs. All I can say is YUM and WHOOPIE! ??

Both methods are flawless!

This is a keeper!  I doubled the beer (Corona) to cut down on the sweetness, used Quervo Silver, and exchanged a small amount of tequila for a little triple sec.  Everyone who's tried it loves it!

Very simple take on beer margaritas (also termed coronitas) by using simple limeade  as the flavor source. It is VERY strong with tequila. However, the amount of beer was actually very little (25%), whereas many of these recipes use more. I recommend adding  replacing 6oz of the water with 6oz of more Corona. If you like it weaker, cut the tequila down to 9oz instead of 12oz. Will make again!

Made this with Corona and 1800 tequila. There were only two of us drinking this so we halved everything but the beer, and still the beer did not taste too powerful. Good-quality tequila is really essential since there are so few ingredients. We later had just a mix of beer and the limeade and found that it was much more well-balanced with the water and tequila added in. 

Definitely a simple but delicious drink to sip on during the summer months.

Very good! Use water not soda like others mentioned as it'll be too sweet otherwise. Makes about 5 larger servings.

For me who hates beer but is always down to try new thing, this was still too much  beer taste for me. My parents who like beer didn't think it tasted like beer at all. We used Coors Banquet. I guess that's not very helpful but if you really hate beer, you probably won't like them but it wasn't terrible by any means so give it a go!

LOVE this very simple drink, but simplified even more!  
I do not add any water, but add 16 oz (2 cups) of crushed ice in place of the water .  I then place everything in the blender EXCEPT for the beer ~ BLEND! 
Pour into a glass and leave room to top the drink off with the beer, gently mix and place a slice of lime in the drink.
Excellent!

Really tasty stuff!  The only change I made was to cut the water to 10 ounces and add 2 ounces of triple sec.  I put all ingredients, except the beer (I used Corona) in the blender to eliminate any pulp from the limeaid, then added the beer after blending.  At first, it was a bit sour, but after sitting in the fridge until party time, it was fantastic!

I have been making a slightly different version of his for years and love it! Same lime aid and tequila but no water and add 3 12 oz. bottles of corona. Always mix the lime aid and tequila first and then gently stir in the beer so you don't make it flat. Fill a glass with ice and garnish with a lime.  Yummy!!!

I doubled this recipe and took it to a neighbors house for dinner. It got RAVE reviews. Everyone loved it and some said it was the best margarita they've ever had. Plus was that they are quite potent! A++

I followed the recipe exactly, I think that substituting the water with soda would make it way too sweet.

I know this doesn't sound good, but I was taught to use milk instead of water.  just try it once.  I put it in the freezer and when I am ready for a drink I mix 1 cup of the mix with a cup of crushed ice and blend very well.  oh my, so refreshing.

Very good, but it's better if you sub Mountain Dew in place of water. gives it a nice tangy flavor

I've wondered about those beer margaritas!  Love it!  I made just one at a time so didn't make a pitcher worth.  I used a healthy serving of tequila, about 1/2 bottle of Corona, a large scoop of frozen limeade, ice (no water - there's enough of that in the beer and the ice) and boom!  Yummay!

This is so refreshing! Made this as specified but I did decrease the water by 1/2, added 4 oz of triple sec and the juice of one lime.  I doubled the recipe to serve a crowd and everyone loved it! It does not taste like beer or a margarita really, but it is good!! Tart, tangy, slightly sweet and so refreshing!! Goes down way too easy, so watch yourself!!

This recipe is fantastic as written!  VERY easy, and even folks who don't care for beer won't be able to taste it.  I did use Bud Lite Lime but won't hesitate to use plain old garden variety beer next time.  This will become a summer-time standard at our house!

We were anxious to try this recipe, but were disappointed with the outcome. May give it another chance with one readers suggestion of white tequila and 7 up instead of water

My mom gave me a margarita recipe that is very similar that, instead of blending with ice, you freeze overnight in a gallon freezer bag.  Take 'em out, knead to breakup for perfect consistency and no dirty blender to clean!!

Love this.  Got recipe from other shopper in grocery store when i was trying to buy frozen lime juice.  Her recipe was exactly except she added 6 oz. grand marnier or triple sec.  I have even frozen it and it doesn't freeze into a cube...it stays slushy.  Yum!

I have been adding beer to my margaritas for well over 20 years..  it truly enhances the taste.  Only difference with my recipe is that I use 6 oz of limeade and 6 oz of Lemonde.

Love this drink recipe! There's absolutely nothing to it, but it was a huge hit for the grown-ups at my son's taco dinner birthday party. I used to make a similar recipe in college, except in place of the water we added 12 oz. of Sprite or 7-Up. That makes it a bit sweeter for those who feel that this version is too tart (which is never a problem for me).

I drink alcohol 2-3 times per year and it's usually wine.  But I decided to give this a try at one of our parties.  That was the first beverage to go and everyone who tried it, loved it, including me.  I will be making this again.

there is a much simpler and better way to do this.  I shot of frozen limeade, thawed; 1 shot of tequila and 1 beer.  Make sure to mix the limeade before measuring out the shot & it's the perfect beer margarita.  Foster's beer makes the best one.

These are the best margaritas we've ever had.  They aren't overly sweet, and I would never guess beer was a main ingredient.  Didn't change a thing, and used corona light.

This has the perfect Margarita flavor as far as I am concerned!  Amazing! Made a dbl batch for a get together over Memorial weekend, and It went quick.  Just did this again over this last weekend.  Sipped on a pitcher with a few friends over a hot day and it was perfect!  Making this again this weekend to take to the lake...  Love it!

I've made a similar recipe for years but instead of water use a can of 7 up and a Corona or lime beer.  They are way too strong with a whole can of tequilla for me so I use about 2/3 of the can from the limeade concentrate.  Fast and easy recipe that can be on hand for impromptu parties.

Great start to a maragarita! I use ginger ale in place of water and add 6 fluid ounces of triple sec. This is such a good summer thirst quencher!

This does make an excellent margarita. I first got this recipe from the Sweet Potato Queens recipe book and it is fabulous.  I normally put a little less tequila in it though. I have wimpy friends :)

This was great. I used Miller Lite with Lime (it was the cheapest) and the store brand limeade mix. Cheap tequila and water. I blended everything except the beer and then stirred that af inter. Has quite a kick! I've made two batches and put what we haven't drunk in the freezer so that they are slushy for tomorrow. I just hope I can stay away from it tonight so that the pitcher makes it tomorrow!

I would use Budweiser lime beer instead of the frozen limeade which is too much high fructose cornsyrup....yuk. The Miller lime beer is not good but somehow Bud got it right...although I swore I would not buy anymore Bud last year when they sold out to overseas. But I will to make these...prob w/less water.

Great for a party mix. I modified the recipe by replacing the water with another beer because I like stronger drinks. It came out way too sweet for me personally, so next time I'm going to start with half of the limeade. I'll just add another beer and some tequila to the one I just made. This recipe is a good alternative to making large amounts of margaritas for a party and not having to use a mix.

If I could give this recipe four and a half stars I would. I think needs one to one and a cups of ice but otherwise the best margaritas I've had and will use it as a base recipe.

OMG, so simple, but so good... and I am NOT a huge margarita fan.  I believe I added a bit of Grand Marnier to this recipe and me and my husband, mom and family sat around one day watching a football game and marvelling at how good these were!  And I don't even like footbal either.  Planning to make two pitchers of these to serve for the pre-Thanksgiving dinner cocktail hour at my house tomorrow.  Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!

Made this as directed with a Coors Lite, generic limeaid from the local supermarket, and some reposado tequila.  It was waaaay too sweet.  Even cut with extra water and almost another entire beer, it was still quite sweet.  Maybe the local limeaid is extra sugary?  As it is, I'll stick with traditional margarita recipes.

My husband and I both loved these! I tried the recipe twice - once as the recipe stated and once using 7-up in place of the water and I really couldn't tell much of a difference. Either way they were delicious! I'm recommending this recipe to all my friends.

This is a great Margarita mix!  I followed the ingredients exactly.  The only thing I did differently is mixed everything but the beer and ice the night before and added lime and orange slices to the mix.  The next day I added the beer and ice.  We all enjoyed the Beer Margaritas and enjoyed the fruit slices that had soaked up the yumminess! I will make this again and again!

I made these Saturday night and got a look of suspicion when people saw me adding the beer.  I was very skeptical myself.  However, when everyone tasted this drink they declared it the BEST margaritas ever.  It was fast & easy!

These are pretty good. I didn't give them 5 stars though because there is something just a little off about them.  Maybe a little less water or more beer.  Probably won't make them again though.

Yea, I was skeptical too. I took the ingredients to a party and mixed up a pitcher. Everyone loved it. Someone else brought the stuff for a regular marg and we did a taste test. The Beer Marg won. This was an "expert" group as we drink a lot of Margs and since we live in New Mexico I consider the group to be pretty savvy.

So glad I tried these!  Great, easy and you can't beat having a whole pitcher or two waiting in the fridge for you.  I will be making a lot more of these. Thanks.

A friend shared her recipe and I've been making them ever since. To make a pitcher I use 1 can limeade, 4 lime beers (miller chill, corona, etc) and 1 cup tequila. Perfect everytime. People are absolutely amazed when they try it.

Awesome! I made them fozen: in a blender, with only 6oz of water, and ice to the top of the pitcher. The boyfriend and his roommates (beer and margarita FREAKS) were skeptical at first, but soon demanding more. :) We made the second batch with only half a can of limeade and about 2 cups of fresh strawberries. GREAT RECIPE/MARGS!!

These are amazing! I made them last Saturday for me and a friend and joked with my Mom that i was going to make her one too (she HATES beer and tequila so this was not something she wanted to even try a sip of) i ended up bribing her to try some anyways though and as she got ready to wrinkle her noise after the first sip she just looked all surprised and said..."Actually, that's pretty good!" She ended up asking me for one for herself later on! Haha. As far as the ingredients go I used white tequila and Corona and followed all other instructions perfectly! Awesome! I will be making these again!

Very good and easy margarita! Beats having to make a simple syrup! The taste was different, but I expected that since it has beer in it, however, it was a nice change from the typical margarita. Well worth trying. We drank them on New Years Eve. I must say they taste better and better the more you drink them! :) I will definitely make these again, but I do prefer a more traditional margarita over these, just personal taste.

These pretty good. They didn't have quite as good flavor as regular margaritas. They were pretty tart, but were better after we mixed it extra. I might try it again just since it's so easy to make. We made a gallon for a party, and it was all gone by the end.

I made a big bucket of this for the beach. I didn't tell anyone the secret ingredient (the beer). Everyone loved that it didn't taste at all like the neon mix. I then told everyone about the beer and all were shocked! My one friend who doesn't like beer couldn't even tell. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Wow, this drink is amazing!! when i told my husband about adding beer into a margarita he said "don't even try it", since i read all the positive reviews i made it and I let him try it he couldn't believe it was so good(i used a lite beer).  

I also cut back on the tequlia only adding 8 oz and made up the difference with 7-up since I don't like really strong drinks.  Had a family get together yesterday and went threw 3 rounds of them yummmm..

I ended up adding a lot of extra beer to this recipe. With only 12oz, it still tasted quite sweet. I think I was expecting a beer taste with a light margarita taste. If you like the sweeter taste, stick with the recipe as is. I think we added about five beers total and it was pretty yummy. :) It's really a foolproof recipe you can make however you like!

I'm pregnant so I didn't get to try this one.  My guests all seemed to like it, although some said they tasted a lot of limeade.
I would recommend straining the pulp before you serve.  It would look a lot more appetizing that way!  Otherwise, good margaritas!

I made this recipe with the user suggestions below for a bachelorette, opting for Corona and 7up. I left the ice out and allowed the drinker to add their own to keep it from watering down. I used starfruit and lime to garnish - the ladies RAVED about this drink. Good Job!

I read this recipe and the reviews out of morbid curiosity. I thought there was no way this was going to be any good. We were having another couple over for dinner, and my husband had marinated the meat for kebabs in a mixture of lime juice with some garlic, herbs and a tiny bit of olive oil. So, this beverage was a perfect preview to the lime-infused shish kebabs.

Instead of 12 oz of water, I used about 6 oz of ginger ale, and 6 oz of water. I forgot to use the lime slices as a garnish, but even so, our guests were raving about them. I'll probably make them again when I can afford to buy another bottle of tequila. :)

This is a supper yummy recipe! I used water not lemon/lime soda. I did not want them too sweet. I used 9 oz Cuervo, 3 oz Cointreau, and corona beer. Make sure you double or triple the recipe. They go fast!

I am a Margarita drinker, and have never been able to make one that is both delicious and easy at home.  This is by far the easiest and tastiest made at home Margarita ever.  I made it just as written and its perfect over ice!!

I made these for a Canada Day party we had and they were excellent!  I used white tequila and Corona beer and apart from that, didn't change a thing and these were a huge hit.

These are great!  I've tried every margarita concoction out there and time and money wise this is definitely the best!  The flavor was great!  I tried it with Sprite but we much preferred the water.  The ingredients were inexpensive.  Plus, I made a few pitchers and they were ready for our dinner guests.  No more mixing drinks all night!

I reluctantly made these only because I thought so many people couldn't be wrong!. They weren't and they are so good. So easy to make when you are having people over. All have been suprised to find out the ingredients and everyone wants the recipe. My only change has been to add 2 shots of simple syrup to the can before adding the water. Delicious

I can't even count the times I've served these up ... and always recieve compliments on them.  Naturally it's fun to pass along the recipe since it's so easily memorized, and see folks raise their eyebrows when you say, "and a 12 oz longneck".  :)

I've never left a review before but I had to for this one. Quite possibly the best margarita I've had (& definitely the best margarita I've ever made). Used Corona, water (not 7-up), & Cuervo Premium Silver. Served on the rocks with salt.

I wish I could give this one 10 stars!!  The best margarita ever!  Be sure and use good tequila and beer.  I used Jose Cuervo Gold tequila and Corona Extra for the beer.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted 12oz. of sprite for the water.  I made a triple batch for a party and it was the hit of the party!

Wow...Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!! The best margarita I've ever had. Took other reviewers suggestions and used lemon-lime soda in place of water. Defenately double or triple the recipe. One batch will not be enough!! Yummy!!

This recipe is best when you use the silver Tequila, Corona Extra and Sprite instead of water. I stumbled on something a little different one time when out of Sprite...I used Mt Dew and it was great!! Try it...

I made these for Father's Day.  I thought they sounded weird, but my dad likes beer and margaritas, so I decided to give it a chance!  They were absolutely fabulous!  I used Corona and everyone loved their drink.  I will definitely make these again.

Very close to a regular marguerita. Couldn't find "Limeade" so I went with lemonade mixed with lime juice. Replaced water with 7-up. Used Corona Light. Crowd loved it!!

I followed the exact recipe.  I used Budweiser because that is what my hubby brought for me.  I served this at a Father's Day BBQ - all the ladies liked it.  It did not taste overly sweet - it was refreshing on a lazy sunny day.  I will make again.

I found this recipe and I am so glad I did!  It is easy and really yummy.  I have to still try it using a can of 7up instead.  I did not have plain tequila but I used Cuervo Golden Margaritas with Grand Marnier mix and it worked awesome!!  If it sits in the fridge overnight is tasty but no fizz, still enjoyable.
I just made another pitcher just now, yay! Thanks!

Very good and easy to make.  These were a hit at my Cinco de Mayo party last night!  I substituted the water with 7Up as others suggested and used Corona.  Yummy!!!

Yikes, only one beer is far too strong.  I use four beer and serve them tall over ice from a jug.  Just don't mix them too much as they can foam up.

This is a great party margarita. I made up two large pitchers for a summer party and everyone loved them. When asked for the recipe, people couldn't believe one the ingredients was beer. The beer gives the margarita the perfect amount of fizz. Be sure to serve with plenty of salt & ice. Yum!

I have also made this for years. Best to go with a light colored beer. I usually use these for frozen margy's in that case. In a  blender put in use 1/2 can lime juice, 1/2 can of beer, 1/2 a can of tequila and a splash of triple sec or o.j. if I have no triple sec. Save the remainder of the lime concentrate in a zip lock (you'll use it up quickly)and a couple of generous handfuls of ice, blend smooth, enjoy...repeat with the rest of the ingredients. Tip (buy extra lime juice, these will be a big hit) you DO NOT taste the beer at all.

Awesome!!! however as I always do modify ingredients in recipes.  I used silver tequila, Corona lite and instead of 12oz of tequila I used 9oz and 3oz of triple sec. I also used 6oz of frozen limeade and 6oz frozen lemonade. I also used 7-up instead of water.  I chilled it for hours before serving and it was the best.

I brought these to one of our monthly "Girls Night Out" gatherings and they were a huge hit.  I used 7-Up instead of water which I think makes them extra yummy.

A friend taught me how to make these years ago.  Her mother was born in Mexico.  Never added water but will try it because one reader did say it helped tame the limeade, though I like mine tart. They definitely will sneak up on you.

Very quick and easy. Make sure to chill this for at least 2 hrs before serving. It tastes much better cold. Be careful how much you have they sneak up on you. I hate beer and I actually like these.

I made this recipe last night for a football party and YUMMY! I substituted Sprite for the water and left the pulp in it. Everyone loved it, even the non margarita lovers!

AMAZING!  Have tried several marg mixes, and this one is cheap, and much better, although they will definetly sneak up on you, I am not kidding.  I made them following suggestions of others, with 1/4 cup triple sec, and also 3/4 sprite (although, I like mine limey and the pop was a little to sweet)  Try them, once you do, you won't go back to a mix!

I'm not a big margarita drinker, but I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  It's fast, easy and tastes more authentic than the typical margarita mix.  I thought the beer would be a weird addition, but I couldn't even taste it!  This is a KEEPER!

We love these margarita's!!  Instead of water we add a can of Sprite or 7-Up just to give it a little bubbly.  Easiest and best homemade margarita's I've ever had.

It seems that all of my girlfriends love margaritas! This one is our new favorite. I didn't tell them, at first, that this had beer in it and they loved it. I think it is best using Corona but if you don't have that use a light beer. Don't use a fancy, dark or ale beer - they distort the flavor. We all think it tastes better the next day.

These didn't taste exactly like a margarita, but that could be the beer-we used Budweiser, and I'll use this recipe to get rid of the other six cans in the fridge.  Also, used diet Sprite instead of water.  These are definitely smoother if you let the ice melt a little, otherwise they're very strong but YUMMY either way.

Great recipe!  These were awesome and a great change from buying the mixes..  I, too, was questioning the beer, but it was wonderful!  Mike's Hard Limeade worked well also... Thanks for the great recipe...

i'll go ahead and give this recipe 5 stars, but it will be even better using lemon-lime soda in place of the water.  beer margaritas are a staple in our household.  they are awesome and always a crowd pleaser!

These are so good and couldn't be easier to make.  I made this for a group of friends and told them it was made with beer.  I loved watching everyone taking a tiny sip when they tried it. We all loved it! Next time I'll try it with Sprite as others suggested just see how it turns out.

I found this recipe last summer and made it for 2 different parties.  Everyone loved it.  It is amazingly simple and amazingly good!  We blend it in the blender with some ice and it makes a great frozen margarita.  One of our friends has renamed the recipe to beeritas.  Has become a standard drink for card night.

Surprisingly good!  The best part was that you could mix them up and keep the pitchers chilling in the frig, bringing them out as the current batch depleted.  Really great and our 40+ guests loved them.

Ok, I know margaritas and was very sceptical about this recipe but....this is the BEST margarita I have ever tasted!! The only change I made to it was I used half of the tequila it called for and used Cointreau for the other half. AWESOME.  I am having a Mexican Fiesta themed wedding reception this weekend and this is going to be my featured drink.  Be careful though, these drinks go down way too smooth and sneak up with a punch!!!

The other "skeptic" reviewers gave me encouragement to try this one.  Glad I did.  This was terrific!  I used Squirt soda-pop in place of the water.  Even if you're a light-weight and water these down, they're still delish!

This is an awesome margarita!  It does have a little kick and you can definitely taste the tequila, but I like it that way.  You CANNOT taste the beer so don't let that scare you if you are not a fan of beer!  I squeezed a little fresh lime in and used diet 7Up. Thank you so much for this recipe!
