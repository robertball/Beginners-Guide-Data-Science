Pretty good. Had everything on hand when my family wanted to snack on something. My major problem was it burnt my pan pretty badly from the sauce dripping off the rolls and as someone else said the sauce just melted off the rolls and would not stick so when I pulled them out of the oven I used a basting brush and basted the sauce back on. Not sure if I would make again just because of the mess.

These were a little disappointing. Basically tasted like orange glazed biscuits. But they were simple and I had all the ingredients on hand.

These were very good my boyfriend said to add these to his favorites. A nice change from the same old cinnamon rolls everyone makes. The can of biscuits I used only made 8 so I will probably double it next time. I also added more pecans. Delicious!

This was ok but maybe I didn't do something right. The rolls stuck to the pan and tore a bit and the topping seemed like so much it poured off the rolls. I'll try it again though cause we love orange and honey!

These were really good! After reading other reviews I baked them in a pan lined with Reynolds non-stick foil sprayed a little Joy of Baking spray and they came out with no problem...plus I had no pan to clean!

This are so good. I make them for dessert when I have company come over. They are the best right out of the oven. Use foil or parchment paper on the bottom of your pan for easy clean up.

It was a hot mess. Made a 2nd batch and rolled the biscuits out; crimped together and made seamless. Laid everything out in it under the same principle as cinnamon rolls. I didn't have anymore orange to zest and used marmalade instead. Rolled up tight and cut into 1" slices and laid them in a pan with non stick spray. I dressed them up with a light sprinkling of my favorite thrown together spice blend. Then into the oven. Came out much much better:)
