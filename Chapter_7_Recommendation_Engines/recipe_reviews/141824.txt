This was a good but different shortcake.  It really is more of a pound cake.  If you don't have cake flour, you can use 1 3/4 cups all-purpose mixed with 1/4 cup cornstarch.  It took 1 hour 20 minutes to bake and I covered it with foil the last 20 minutes because the top was getting too brown.  The cake itself was a little dry but that's OK because you top it with the cream.  I did not coat my strawberries in sugar because it's just needless calories - they're sweet enough!  Now, the cream is really not a whipped cream.  The recipe doesn't say to, but I beat mine for about 10 minutes in hopes it would thicken.  With all the yogurt in there though, it really didn't get thick like whipped cream.  I think next time I would use 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream and only 1/2 cup yogurt and make whipped cream.  It doesn't say what flavor yogurt to use, but I imagine anything would be fine.  I used vanilla.  Made as written the "cream" is quite runny and basically just yogurt.  So for me it needs some tweeking, but still a good recipe and easy to serve.

This is tasty, but it is a pound cake. Be prepared for that before making it. It does state "pound cake" in the description. Therefore it is a very dense, heavy cake. Mine was a little on the dry side, though it wasn't over-baked. The strawberries do taste great with the poundcake. I'd planned on making the yogurt cream, but found that my yogurt had expired. I made homemade whipped cream instead and it worked very well.

An excellent recipe, but as said in the other review, the "cream" is too runny. Good recipe, though.

Excellent pound cake base for strawberries.   Do use cake flour because there really is no good substitute.  As to complaints about it being dry this was not a problem here.  Also liked the tangy topping which, as recipe stated, just stir together. Makes a very nice change from whipped cream. Much to prefer this cake type base for fruit than the popular biscuit type.  Thanks for submitting...highly recommend if made exactly as written.

I didn't have cake flour on hand, so I just used all-purpose flour and added a bit of cornstarch. Since many reviews mentioned the dryness after baking, I decided to add some milk (about 1/3 - 1/2 cup) to the batter. I opted out of the cream topping and the cake was still delicious with the strawberries alone. Great recipe!
