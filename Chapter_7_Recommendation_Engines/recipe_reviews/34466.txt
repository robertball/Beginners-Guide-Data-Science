This is a masterpiece! I was able to make a "healthy" version of this recipe. I used Ronzoni whole wheat blend spaghetti instead of Penne. I think this is the best whole wheat pasta out there because it doesnt have a gritty texture and actually tastes like pasta. I used fat free half and half instead of cream and thickened it with 1tsp cornstarch dissolved in a little water before pouring it in. I also suggest topping this with some fresh chopped parsley. This was fast and delicious. Thanks Traci!

DEE-lious! I coarsely chopped the artichokes and julienned the tomatoes (drained, by the way. But reserve a couple of tbsp of the oil), as suggested by others. Made a couple of additions...
Saute a couple of large cloves of garlic in the reserved oil until soft and fragrant, dicard garlic. Add shrimp and/or scallops, sprinkle with 1/8 - 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes. Stir and cook a minute, then add the artichokes,  tomatoes and 1 tbsp fresh or 1 tsp dried basil. After adding the cream and parmesan, stir in the chopped olives and 1 - 2 tbsp drained capers, salt and white pepper to taste. Toss with the pasta and heat through.
I served it with a caesar salad and garlic bread. My boyfriend went crazy, he loved it. Says it in his top ten fav's. Kudos to Traci for this recipe.

Didn't follow exactly,but the base premise of it is great!  I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil, added juileened sun dried tomato's, added 1 pound of scallops and 1/2lb. shrimp, 1 large handful of baby spinach.  Sauteed, deglazed pan w/ 1/4 to 1/2 c. of dry sherry.  Added 1/2 and 1/2 and about 1/4 c. of parmesean cheese.  Served over pasta.  YUMMY!!!!!

My husband gives this recipe a "10." Something he's only done a few times in the ten years I've been cooking for him.  Next time I would julienne the sundried tomatoes and chop the artichoke hearts (maybe the olives, too) so that I could get a little bit of everything in one forkful.  The flavors are heavenly!  Absolutely divine!

I used all listed except I used 1/4 of a pint of cream.  I think the reason some found it to have too much juice is because when the scallops are cooked, they add juice.  I strained out the juice and reduced it, added 1/2 of the small carton of cream, cooked it and then added it back to the scallop/shrimp mixture.  Then, I added 1/2 the pasta.  This way, there is more seafood and less pasta to enjoy.  It turned our perfect.  My husband loved it and asked that I make it again.  I had cooked up the whole package of pasta and used the other half the following night to make a cold pasta salad.

I like all the stuff in this recipe, but I think it gets too liquidy. Plus, it makes A LOT! It's easy to scale to the size of your party. My advice is to be careful with the heavy cream. Also, I buy the frozen shrimp (no-tail) and scallops. They work great, don't be afraid to try them!

Absolutely yummy.  The only change I made, was (of course!!) the addition of garlic, just sauted in the pan in some olive oil before adding the other ingredients.

I thought this was delicious and actually easier to make than I expected.  We used thawed frozen sea scallops and peeled and deveined shrimp (uncooked) for this dish. I diced everything pretty small per some reviews so I could get a little of everything in every bite.  I used fat free half and half to make it a little healtheir and mixed in a couple tablespoons of flour to the half and half before adding it in as I like my sauces pretty thick and creamy.  Finally, I added about 4 or 5 leaves of fresh basil at the last minute because I had it on hand in the garden.  I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.... it wouldn't be too hard to have all of the ingredients on hand without making bi-weekly trips to the store.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Really tasty... found I didn't quite have enough sauce so had to whip up a little something else for the left overs.

A couple changes, we're not fans of olives so we took those out. 
Drained the sundried tomatoes (only used a bit of the oil). Chopped those and the artichokes into smaller pieces.
Instead of cream I used milk with cornstarch, and about a 1/4 cup of white wine. (Would have added more but it was all I had left!)
Added garlic! Was a bit bland before that.

I made this for my aunt, wife, and 2 kids. Everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was I removed the olives (we all hate olives) and added 1 pound of back-fin crabmeat. The crab gave it a thick texture that was off the hook. Very easy to make. Just make sure you follow the recipe for cooking procedure.

I made a few changes to this recipe... I sauteed garlic before the shrimp, and omitted the scallops totally.  I also omitted the olives and used grape tomatoes instead on sun-dried (I'm not a fan) and added baby spinach toward the end.  It is a fantastic recipe!

The look on our faces when we took the first bite said it all. This recipe is completely off the hook. My only changes were 2 chopped garlic cloves added with the shrimp & scallops, I chopped the artichokes & sundried tomatoes and added fresh parsley at the end. I may not add this to my weeknight dinner rotation as the ingredients are expensive, but I will make again. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now.

YUMM!!  This was fantastic.  I halved the recipe and still probably got 6 servings out of it - so if you are making the whole recipe, be prepared for a lot!  I used half cream and half milk to cut down on the calories, and mixed in a little bit of flour to the milk before adding to make sure it would thicken up.  It was very fast and very tasty!

I added capers and garlic to my sauce and sprinkled the shrimp with red pepper and basil and cooked in the tomato oil. I think spinach and/or mushrooms would also work well; however my husband says he wouldn't change a thing- he also said this is one of the best things I've ever made- which means this recipe is exceptionally delicious or I am not as good a cook as I've been led to believe!

This is soooo delicious.  I've had something similar to this at a restaurant and haven't been able to duplicate it until now.  I changed a few things just because of what I had on hand.  I used marinated artichokes, drained and chopped, sundried tomatoes without the oil, julienned, half of a large onion finely chopped, two cloves of garlic, some cream sherry, fat free half and half and cornstarch, some crushed red pepper and a little bit of pasta water to thicken the sauce a bit.  It was out of this world.  Can't wait to have it again.

I brought this as a contribution to a potluck Christmas dinner and it was demolished. What I loved the most is that I made it 5 hours before which took the pressure off the rest of the day. Some things I changed a bit. I sauteed sun dried tomatoes, julienne d from a packet(couldn't find them in a jar) w/ 1lb scallops, & what I thought was a 14oz jar of marinated artichokes but what turned out to be a 14oz jar of marinated Mediterranean Blend, a blend of artichokes, roasted red / green peppers, & baby corns. I removed the baby corns & added everything else. I could only find the size shrimp I wanted (medium) precooked so I added that to the saute at the end just long enough to take on the flavors. I added my cream & cheese and simmered till it thickened, than turned my pasta in to that. I moved it to my crock pot and let it set on the counter unplugged till just warm. About an hour before we left I plugged it in on low, added a splash of milk, and gently turned it with a lg spoon. I repeated that when we got there. I never had to turn it up past low. It was creamy and delicious. The only suggestion I would make is to spice it up. The recipe doesn't address spice & it felt right to add freshly ground sea salt & pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder, & 2 tsp ea. dried basil / oregano.

I had to really think about how to rate this recipe. It's so good and I love kalamata olives, but they are so wrong in this recipe. I will make this again but I will leave out the olives and, if you knew me, you'd know I never, ever say "leave out the olives".

My family didn't care for this dish, but I loved it. I ate it for lunch and dinner for almost a week. I cooked some garlic and red pepper flakes in some of the oil from the tomatoes, then added the seafood. I think that gave it a little extra zip.

Very, very good.  I did use some cornstarch to thicken it up, but other then that and some garlic and salt and pepper I made as is.  I was very impressed with the taste and will most certainly make again.

This dish has become a favorite for my boyfriend and I.  I saute a few cloves of garlic in 2 or 3 teaspoons of olive oil before I add the other ingredients. Also chopping the artichokes, tomatoes, and the olives ensures a little in each bite.  Fresh mushrooms are a great addition.

This is a favorite at our house. We don't always have scallops but it still taste delicious with just shrimp. Often I'll simmer the shrimp and artichokes in white wine. My husband and I enjoy a thicker sauce too so I sprinkle flour into the sauce until it reaches desired consistency.

This was excellent. We followed the recipe exactly. Not sure if the sun dried tomatos were to be marinated in oil but the ones I bought were. We also used bay scallops

Yum!  My family loved this one, even the picky eaters.   My husband said it was like eating an expensive restaurant meal - I know, he's corny!

Delicious!  I used the bay scallops, next time I will cut the shrimp down a bit and use regular scallops - this was delicious!

This was super easy and awesome.  My girlfriend and I had another couple over, served with homemade Caesar Salad, & breadsticks this was a winner.  We left out the olives as they didn't seem to go and used half & half for the cream.  We also used mozerrella cheese (not a ton) and grated parm.  Will make this again for the parental units when they visit!

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  I halved the recipe and used all the shrimp, but no scallops and there was still plenty leftovers after two servings.  The only other thing I did differently was added a little garlic.   Thought the leftovers tasted even better!  Have already sent the recipe to a friend.   Definitely a keeper!

This is a very easy and tasty recipe.  I did substitue hot grilled italian sausage for the scallops, it seemed to give it a nice contrast, I also used both pesto and sundried tomatoes. We had a couple over for dinner and they said it was the best pasta they had ever eaten.

Sorry, I dont know what everyone sees in this recipe. There are far better recipes on this website for pasta with sundried tomatoes or seafood. Together with artichokes, they just don't taste good. Though simple to make, its a waste of good ingredients.

Fantastic dish! I halved the recipe for my husband and I and we still had left over’s. I used whole wheat penne, added garlic and red pepper flakes for a touch of spice.  I also used sun dried tomato pesto like a few of the others recommended. I used double the whipping cream though.  I like saucy pasta dishes.  I certainly don't think it was too much. ...just extra fattening. :)

This was good.  I used dried basil, because I didn't have fresh and I will definitely use fresh next time.  I also used fat free half and half to try to try to make healthier and I don't think I will do that again.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed.

I've been looking for a recipe that duplicates one I can't get at a restaurant any longer called "Mediterranean Pasta" that had artichokes, olives and a cream sauce. This recipe comes close so I gave it a shot. The differences were sauteed chicken instead of seafood and a splash of Ouzo (a clear anise-flavored liqueur from Greece)is added to the sauce. It came out great! I might give the seafood version a try too, but I definitely think the Ouzo gives the sauce an excellent flavor.

This recipe calls for way too much cream.  You can get away with using less than 1/2 that is called for.  I added fresh garlic, mushrooms and tomatoes and used chicken instead of seafood. Very good!

So good! Tastes like its from a restaurant. I love olives...but I didn't like them in this. I thought they were a bit overpowering against the seafood. I will definitely be making this again! (without the olives)

added garlic as suggested in other posts. Avoiding carbs at the moment so opted for roasted zuchinni and eggplant instead of pasta.  will add mushrooms to the mix next time.  Wonderful base recipe.  will be using again and again.  Thanks!

Loved, loved, loved this! Made the following modifications: started by sauteing garlic in a little butter, added frozen shrimp (didn't have scallops), marinated artichokes (drained, from a jar), roasted red, yellow & orange bell peppers (drained - from a jar), olives, capers, a little salt & pepper. Skipped the cream and added some flour to thicken the juice from the ingredients.  Used whole wheat pasta. Added parmesan and asiago cheeses. Yum!!

This is really a 3 1/2 star! It was good but had a lot going on. I subbed FF 1/2 & 1/2 for the heavy cream to lower the calorie count. I think that I would have preferred it with just the shrimp instead of the shrimp and scallops. Tastey but a little too fishy for me. Will try it again tho and see if I still feel that way!

Delicious!  Omitted olives (preference).  Like others, I sauteed a few cloves of garlic in oil from the tomatoes first.  I cut back on the amount of heavy cream used and it was still nice and creamy.  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than enough for two people.  Will make again.

Ok, great recipe but added a few things.  First, I sauted fresh garlic in a very small amount of olive oil before adding fish.  Second, I added fresh parsley and cayenne pepper to taste.  Just enough to give it a kick- Very nice

My neighbor made this recipe tonight and called after they were done to see if we had eaten because they had so much left over - and boy was I glad!!! My husband and I had very hearty portions after they did the same, plus she had left overs for lunches tomorrow. This recipe is excellent - and she even used fat free half and half. Can't wait to make it myself!!!!

It seemed to taste better the following day after a quick zap in the microwave. I think all of the cheese made me feel that it was too fattening to fully enjoy :(

This recipe is a hit with family and friends. It's great for the holidays too. I use a light cream and some milk instead of the heavy cream. Leftovers are even better tasting; just add a little milk.

I made this at the last minute, I didnt have the sundried tomatoes or the olives so I expected it to be maybe a little bland but it was delicious, rich, cheesy and anything but bland. I did think the scallops were way overpowered, but I used bay scallops (the small ones) so maybe sea scallops would have been a better choice in that respect but it still tased great. Also this was my first time preparing shrimp and they came out perfect. My boyfriend requested I make this again after the first few bites and he even had seconds, which is rare. Great recipie, thank you for sharing it!

My gosh this was good!  I didn't have the olives so I omitted them.  My family including my five year old son, loved this dish and so did I!  I will make this again.  There were plenty of it too.

I used fat free half and half but otherwise followed the directions and it's good.  However, I think it would be better vegetarian or maybe with chicken.  I like scallops for their light, buttery flavor and texture which got lost in the heavy sauce.  On the other hand, my husband doesn't like scallops and he went back for seconds.  So, I guess it's a matter of personal preference.  Next time I'll save my scallops for a lighter dish, but I'll keep this recipe because I thought the rest of it was really good.

Wow, hands down my favorite recipe on this site.  Definitely add some garlic and julienne the Sun dried tomatoes, other than that, this is bliss.  The flavors are so wonderful together, just be careful not to get too many biiter olives.

This was so good, but I didn't have all ingredients on hand so I had to modify. Cooked up 2 cloves of minced garlic in butter then added SDT, artichoke, shrimp and scallops. Cooked around 7 minutes. I took the shrimp out because I didn't want to overcook them and put them back in toward the end...add 1/3 cup of white wine and simmer for 3 minutes. Slowly add 8oz of heavy cream and bring to an almost simmer. Without straining the cook pasta just add it to the sauce with P. cheese and let simmer for a few minutes. I did cut up some (maybe 8) olives and added them.  

I just used what shrimp and scallops were in the freezer...it wasn't a pound and I didn't use the whole jar of artichoke or SDT either. I just added what I thought would be enough. Served with a baguette and butter. So, good!

My offical "eater" said that this was the best dinner I've made yet. I used shredded parm instead of grated because it was cheaper and it didn't seem to make a big difference. Yum, will make this again but maybe substitute crab meat for scallops.

I only give this 4 stars because it's not the BEST pasta I've ever had, but it's definitely a regular at our house.  I do add a few more artichokes and tomatoes than the recipe calls for and a touch of Essence, but that's just my taste.  It's good w/o those modifications --- just don't forget the olives!  They really take this dish from fine to GOOD!

Simple, easy and decandent. My family loved this recipe (I have 2 picky teenagers). The sauce was a little thin, but the overall blend of flavors was fabulous. Be prepared for *lots* of leftovers, this is very filling.

I took the advice of another reviewer and subbed in the sun-dried tomato pesto for the sun-dried tomatoes.  The pesto combined with the cream made a nice rich sauce.  Great dish!

I was so excited.  The recip[e was wonderful, just like the others I used the Sun-Dried Pesto mix and ommitted the olives. Great taste

This is an excellent easy dish!  I loved it and so does evereyone I've made this for.  I used all shrimp.  I omitted kalamata olives I don't feel I lost a bit of flavor.  Instead of the sun dried tomtotes, I used a sun dried tomato pesto that adds a great touch.  I just threw in a few spoonfuls of the pesto while cooking.  This is a regular in my dinner rotations!

This has got to be my all time favorite recipe.  I have made this so many times since I discovered it here.  The only thing I do differently is to use sundried tomato pesto instead of sundried tomatoes.  It just blends better.  Fabulous recipe!  Kudos to the creator!

Followed directions  for cooking, but first I sauteed garlic in the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.  I also sliced up the artichoke hearts and the sun-dried tomatoes, as well as the olives.  This recipe makes a ton of food, but since my picky husband loved it, it is all good!!  This was quick and super easy, but classy enough to serve to company.

BTW....I noticed that some reviewers thought it was too liquidy from the juice from the scallops.  Before I added the cream and cheese,  I scooped everything to one side of the pan, tilted it, and used a "sponge" of about 3 folded paper towels and did a quick blot.  Consistency was perfect!!

I used half and half but, just personally don't care for creamy sauce. Think I might try again with just olive oil or butter and sauteed seafood and veggies. Little bland for me.

I changed this so much because of what I had on hand. I used 2 pounds of shrimp and no scallops.  I didn't even have sun dried tomato's but I did have a little leftover spaghetti cause.  I also had some leftover shrimp scampi so I separated the shrimp and then chopped up those noodles. I also had to make the cream by heating 2% milk and butter of heat with some flour.  The kids "say" they don't like artichoke hearts but they were cut up small and had no idea they were in there.  I also added garlic. After cooking the shrimp with the artichoke hearts and garlic, I mixed everything together and served over more noodles which the kids loved.  Not sure I could make this again the same way but this base recipe was a big help to me.

Great flavor.  I did cut up tomatoes.  I added some flour to thicken it up.  I think garlic would be ok addition, but it tasted great either way, just too thin.

I omitted the olives but otherwise changed nothing. The flavor was good, but the sauce was way too runny - I think the heavy cream could have been cut in half.

Made this with reduced quantities and it was easy and delicious.  Used some tomatoes from our garden that I dried and froze.  Therefore no oil except a little I used to saute seafood etc.  Added a touch of garlic.  This one is a keeper.

AWESOME and impressive restaurant quality dish!  Only input- used bay scallops and they got lost in the dish.  Pat dry seafood to help cut down on water.  Maybe even sauté scallops separately?  Sundried toms definitely need to be sliced up.  I left our olives because I am not a fan but I can see how they would really add to the dish- guess the suggested capers would be a nice fill in.  Made our own artichoke hearts out of 8 small artichokes from Trader Joe's (2 packs of four).  This adds much more prep time, of course but they were so good!  If you choose to try-Clean chokes, de-hair, slice up and drop in lemon water bath to prevent the immediate browning effect.  Steamed for about 7 mins til tender, add as directed.  To solve the need to thicken the sauce without overcooking the seafood, we used the butter technique:  turn off heat when done cooking, add 1/4 stick of butter and stir until thickened.

We went with a 14-15 ounce can of artichoke hearts packed in water, which we reserved and used to adjust the consistency since we only used half the cream. We also added a few cloves of minced garlic, chopped the artichokes and julienned the tomatoes. Really an outstanding combination of flavors that takes to any number of impromptu spice additions. A great recipe to sneak in some whole wheat pasta, too!

I made this as a non- meat option for a Christmas  family gathering, had a "Key West" theme going.  Everyone raved about this dish, huge hit!  Had great flavor. I made one change to cut back on some of the fat. I cut the cream in half and replaced with a cup of non-fat plain Greek yogurt.  Definitely making this again, will be experimenting with ways to reduce the fat content, yet keeping the creaminess and flavor.

Made this for my family. Even my grandparents loved it. I didn't use the artichoke and I used whole plum tomatoes and they ate the whole pot.

This was really delicious! I had to make a few adjustments; Rotini instead of Penne, and I omitted the shrimp because I don't care for it. My parents LOVED it and told me "it's a keeper!" I agree, thank you for the great recipe!

I really liked this - probably would have been better with the real cream but I used half and half. Sadly, the rest of my family doesn't care for artichokes so I don't get to cook with them very often. I thought the rest of this recipe might sway them but it didn't work :( I tried to punch up the flavor by using garlic, red pepper and basil but it wasn't enough. I'll spice it up a little more next time, maybe even add a little lemon juice.

Quick, easy and good!  Everyone in the family loved as is.  The sauce was a little runny the first day.  I added a little extra cheese to thicken.  Was perfect the 2nd day.

Excellent...and very easy to tweak based on what's in the fridge --- I used roasted peppers instead of sundried tomatoes...added some leftover asparagus...and some fresh garlic as another review suggested...served it over angel hair.....Worth trying....Thanks...!

I'm giving this a 3 because I had to doctor it a bit to try to get it flavorful enough for us, and it was still sort of bland.  I sauteed garlic and hot pepper flakes in olive oil, then added the shrimp, artichokes and tomatoes, and scallops at the end so they wouldn't get too tough.  I then removed the fish and vegies from the pan and added fat-free half and half, and cornstarch mixed with a touch of water.  When this had started to thicken, I added the fish and vegie mixture back to the pan with the cheese and olives.  I mixed in the pasta to absorb some of the sauce, and served with additional cheese.  I am sure that whole cream would have added "something", but I am not sure it would have been worth the extra calories and fat.  This is a great starting point, but I will have to play around with the recipe to get it to where there is enough "oomph!" to suit our tastes - I'll get back to you with the results!  Thanks for a good starting point -

Better than I expected! I didnt have scallops so I used chicken breast instead.  It was a bit bland we added garlic powder and salt/pepper.. could probably have used SOMETHING else, just not sure what the something would be!

I cannot rate on the original, since I didn't have a few vital things (its not fair, but I'm sure it would have gotten 5 stars anyways!). I encourage you to try it even if missing some things. I had no artichocke hearts or olives. I used all shrimp, a little less cheese. I put about a tbs of butter in with shrimp and 2 tsp of minced garlic before adding cream. Also, my sundried tomatoes were dried so I blended them with some olive oil and let sit 10 minutes before adding. It was so delicious!!!!!

Delicious recipe! Served over bowtie pasta. Didn't use olives for personal preference, but the artichokes were a hit! Didn't have sundried tomatoes, so added a couple spoonfuls of sundried tomato pesto I had in the pantry and the flavor was a great addition. Will definitely make again!

This was very good, and easy to prepare. I doubled the shrimp, added chopped garlic, and used a small amount of alcohol free white wine.  Used FF H&H with cornstarch to thicken.

This is one of our favorite meals, but it makes a lot so you might want to cut the recipe in half.  My husband made this for the first time the night he proposed to me.  He loved it so much that he asks for it all the time now.  It is very rich though.

I omitted the olives because I'm not a huge fan, and I didn't really like the idea of them with the other ingredients. I personally didn't mind the sun-dried tomatoes but Husband didn't like them at all. If I were to make this again, I would leave them out too. I used a slosh of the oil from the jar of artichokes which added a little bit of extra flavor, and prevented the shrimp/scallops from sticking to the pan. This was a nice meal but not mind-blowing. With a few tweaks, however, it definitely could be. Thank you.

Fast prep, but it seemed to be missing something ... maybe garlic? I halved the recipe to use a full pound of shrimp (to omit the scallops) and skipped the olives, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This dish is good, but it was almost like all the different ingredients were trying to stand out the most. There are so many distinct flavors in this recipe, it's almost an odd experience to eat, but I liked it! I followed the recommendations and sauted some garlic before hand, and added garlic sald and pepper to the recipe for a little seasoning. I'll make this again, but probably alter it a little.

I served this for a dinner party of 8 and it was well received. It was a very hardy dish, but, I thought the taste was pretty different. I wouldn't make it again for myself, but, the rest of my family loved it. Its definately not your typical pasta dish.

Fabulous! I made this with sun dried tomato pesto as suggested in a previous review and it was perfect. This one's a keeper.

Delicious!  I used all shrimp and omitted the kalamata olives.  I served this at a party and it was a hit!  This one is a keeper!

i made this for a special "just for two" dinner, and it was a big hit.  next time, i think that i'll use the smaller scallops since the big bay ones broke up any how.
