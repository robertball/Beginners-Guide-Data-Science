Holy cats, this was good!  Since fresh corn isn't available this time of year, I used frozen corn.  The result was a very sweet tasting corn and very tasty dish!  I have been asked and will definitely make this again very soon!

This was great! I added onions and red bell peppers (for those desiring to do so, Pictsweet makes a seasoning blend in the frozen section that has diced onions, green bell peppers, and red bell peppers! A real time saver!!!)..I also added a dash of black pepper and onion salt. I have also tried this recipe with frozen corn yielding great results. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I've made this recipe for ages, varying it up each time. During the summer, I use fresh corn from the cob but during the winter I've used frozen corn with good results. When I use bacon, I use very little drippings.  However, if I don't have bacon around, I add red peppers (in addition to the green peppers) and saute them in a TBLS of butter. Also, I always add some chopped onions. Nothing fancy but they go great with burgers!

My husband really enjoyed this. I used a thick-sliced maple flavored bacon and also canned corn and a frozen medley of green, red and yellow peppers and onion. Looked pretty. Added fresh cracked black pepper.  I will make this again.

We've been making this forever (it's called Sqaw Corn in my family) - it's one of my favorite summer side dishes. You can also add in finely chopped onion and a bit of fresh cracked pepper for extra flavor. You can also freeze it to enjoy during the winter.

My entire family loved this recipe. Although, it was missing something, so the next time that I made it I changed it a little.  I used 1/2 pound hickory smoked bacon.  I didn't drain any of the grease before adding the green peppers and i used the entire bell pepper instead of half.  I think the hickory smoked bacon made a huge difference.  After I made it this way, we can't get enough of it.

I usually love anything with bacon, and this is absolutely no exception!  I usually leave out the bell pepper and add a little finely chopped garlic.  Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.  This can also be made with canned corn in a pinch, but definitely better with fresh!

This recipe was great!  I was leary of the bacon, expecting that it would make the corn too greasy, but it wasn't at all.  I will fefinitely fix this again.  My husband loved it, too.

I used red pepper instead of green due to personal taste, and I used more bacon grease.  This was very good, I'm sure we'll make again!

We loved it the first time. Second time I added 3 eggs beaten well, added to the hot corn mix and cooked until done. Great. Husband likes it for dinner with fresh biscuits.

Yummy. I did not allow the bacon to become fully crisp (in a hurry, and another recipe I was looking at specified NOT to crisp the bacon) but my hubby and I both remarked it would have been better with crisp-crumbled bacon like the recipe specifies. I added a healthy sprinkle of seasoned salt and pepper blend, but that's what I put in most everything I make. I do think this needs some chopped onions too. Thanks so much for sharing.

I did not use the bell pepper (for my child), but think it would have been very good.  I used frozen corn and took the suggestion of cooking it early and letting it sit and absorb the bacon grease.  Definitely add salt and pepper.

Oh my gosh, this is so good. I used canned corn for this recipe, about 3/4 drained. I would recommend NOT serving it fresh out of the skillet, but rather cooking it and serving it later, because it gives the peppers a chance to soak up the grease. I'd also recommend adding butter, salt, and pepper after it's cooked, to make the taste even richer. Thanks for sharing!

Used ham as I didn't have bacon on hand + TB butter. Added 1/2 a small onion and a clove of garlic. 1ts salt and about a 1/2 ts of paprika. We found this boring as written but with my doctoring- my family loves it.

Really good! Dont like bell peppers so left that out. Added a dash of heavy cream and a tablespoon of sugar at the end, though probably would have been perfectly fine without the extra calories. Cant wait to make again, next time with frozen corn.

Wow, so good. I used red bell pepper because it is sweeter then green. I also added a small jar of drained pimentos. Pork fat rules.

Very very good.  I add Lawry's Seasoned Pepper instead of black pepper. (you really must try it - truly awesome flavor - much better than black pepper) I have also used frozen corn when corn is not in season.  Either way this is delicious!!

I made this after reading the reviews. It was mediocre at best...I didn't like it at all. I had made it for a get-together and honestly, no one else there liked it either.

I didn't have fresh corn on hand, so I used a bag of frozen sweet corn and added a jalapeno instead of the green pepper...WOW!  This was so good, and extremely easy to make.  I've added it to my go-to recipes when I'm short on time, and energy.  :)

Delicious!  I modified the recipe a bit:  sliced bacon instead of crumbled, used diced onion, about 2 cloves garlic, orange pepper instead of green, salt and pepper and frozen corn.  It was simple to make and awesome with our ribs!

This is a very good side dish but I take it up another notch or two by adding onions and less bell pepper,a little flour or milk,also fresh tomatoes,lima beans and okra,also known as succotash, makes it very filling....enjoy!

This is a great way to use fresh corn. I will eat almost anything if its got bacon on, in, or around it! I didnt have any bell pepper so I used sweet onion in its place. Very good!

I liked this very much.  I wouldn't have put corn and bacon together, but YUM.  Didn't have green pepper; I used what I had on hand, which was red onion.  I used frozen corn, but will make with fresh corn and green peppers this summer!

This was good but the same taste could be had with a can or bag of grozen corn kernels warmed up.  And of course sprinkling bacon on anything makes it better.  The green pepper taste really didn't add much to me.  But I do love corn and it was still a great recipe and prettier than a can of corn heated and dumped in a bowl.

A quick and easy recipe. I used sliced ham instead of bacons because that was the only thing I had in my fridge.

i thought i'd try this before corn on the cob went out of season. we likes how the fresh corn flavor stood out & was complimented by the bell pepper & bacon. no changes were made aside from adding a few grinds of black pepper. note: after scraping the corn off the cob downward, carefully scrape the cob upward to release any extra milk. thanks mary!

I didn't have ears of corn on hand, so I used frozen corn instead.  It came out a little chewy,but that could be my own fault.  I also added about 1 tbs of butter to the bacon grease, only because I did use frozen corn and was worried the 1 tbs of bacon grease alone wouldn't cook it through.  I'd love to try this with fresh corn sometime!

Pretty good. made it for company and they seemed to like it but didn't say anything special about it. Corn got a little dry for some reason. Maybe I cooked it too long? I also used red bell pepper for some nice color.

I have made this recipe several times and I always get grand reviews.  If you have the time always use fresh corn in this recipe.  It is worth the extra work.

This was good and simple as apple pie. I did add about 1tsp of flour. My grandmother use to do this when cooking fried corn. It gives some thickness with the natural juice I scraped from the cob. I also added .25 of red, yellow and orange bell pepper along with two packs of substitute sweetner. Nice  colorful presentation.

This was incredible! I've never had anything like this before. It goes well with jambalaya. I fried the bacon first put it aside,and used the pan with drippings instead of oil. I also used frozen corn and it was still absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try this recipe with fresh corn in the summer.  Do not hesitate to try this!

Delicious and simple. I put some red bell peppers in with the green for color and added a splash of sriracha. MMM!

So good!  Only two of us in my family like bell pepper so I left it out and added onion instead.  Delicious!!

Tried this recipe tonight since I had fresh corn on hand.  It was fenominal!!
I did however substitute onions for the peppers and added a pinch of salt.  We couldn't stop eating it.
