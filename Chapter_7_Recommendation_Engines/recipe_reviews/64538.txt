I subitted this recipe.  It will take a lot more than 12 oz of beer.  I usually end up with at least 4 beers to cover.  Not sure why it was changed to 12 oz.

Being raised with two very German parents, I was forced to eat bratwurst quite often. I really disliked it, so now I never go near it, BUT, my Scottish hubby and my kids all love the stuff, therefore, I make it several times a year. Even if I don't like what I'm making, I always taste before serving and I must admit that this was really delicious!! I did the opposite of what the recipe stated; instead of grilling the sausage after coming out of the slow cooker, I grilled the brats before. I used a lot of peppers and added more beer. The sauce was very tastey and the bratwurst was amazingly tender and REALLY flavorful. The family loved this recipe and I thank you!

This is one of the best brat recipes I've come across. Everyone who I served this recipe to loved it. The brats come out so tender! I cook this on low in the crockpot for approx. 7 hours instead of the 4-5 hours the recipe recommends to get them extra tender. They're great right out of the pot, no grilling is needed afterward, if it isn't convenient during inclement weather.

yum, yum, yum!!!!!

I made this for the folks at work for a German themed meal. They LOVED it! I could not locate any honey mustard bbq sauce, so I just purchased honey bbq and added a little spicy mustard. I will definitely be making this for a football party or tailgating! Thank you! GREAT recipe!

Pretty good. We have 3'foot snow drifts, so we couldn't grill outside. Instead, I pan grilled the brats on the stove before putting them in the crock pot. I used nearly 4, 12 oz cans of bear and added sourkraut to the onions and peppers. Liked the liquid smoke flavor.

Excellent bratwurst! I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first. Brats in the slow cooker???? Boy was I wrong!!! Slow cooking makes them fork tender (and deelicious!). Made half the recipe so that my dad would have something to eat when he came to my house to work on a bathroom remodeling project. Because I didn't know when he'd show up (and I was working all day), I made everything the night before. I pretty much followed the directions to a T except for a couple of minor changes. I followed Linda Mclean's suggestion of grilling/basting the brats prior to slow cooking (I used an indoor grill for this). Instead of half an onion and half each of green and red peppers, I used an entire sweet onion and 2 medium-sized green peppers. Also, in order to completely cover the brats/onions/peppers, I used 2 (12 oz.) bottles of Michelob Amber Bock (the cheapest beer I could find - you don't need anything fancy here, just a dark beer for flavor). Cooked on low for 4 hours, but 5 would have been OK too. My house smelled so good! Since I had left-overs, I brought some to work with me. When warmed up in the microwave, the scent of beer permeated the air (yum!!!). For those who couldn't find honey mustard BBQ sauce, look for Kraft brand (they make it). Overall, this is a great, easy recipe that me and my dad both really enjoyed. I'll have to make this for my bf too. Thanks for sharing : )

I thought these turned out really good.  What I liked most was how easy it was to make.  The addition of the bbq sauce was great.  The house did smell good while it was cooking.  I also skipped the red bell pepper as I didn't have any and used two green instead.  I added more garlic than called for as I do with most dishes.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were alright. They were fast and easy to make in my crockpot. They weren't anything special though so I'm not sure if id make them again. The brauts were so tender from cooking that it was sort of an odd texture eating them because you expect that snap from regular brauts.

These are awesome!  We like to eat our food spicey, so I added jalapeno and hungarian hot peppers to the mix.  Guests always rave!

These are the best brats! We normally par-boil our brats in beer and then grill them.  But if we have the time, this is what we do now!  They are so tender and yummy!  I make them in our Nesco cooker, which can fit up to 20 brats.  The more peppers the better!  We've served these at a few family functions and even the people who don't usually like brats went back for seconds.

I used to use a spicy honey mustard bbq sauce, but can't find it locally anymore so add a little hot sauce to the crockpot. I also throw some sauerkraut in a pan and pour in some of the juice from the crockpot and heat it up. I put the sauerkraut with the peppers and onions on top of the brats and it's awesome. :)

Because of my work schedule, I grill marked the brats on my grill the day before, for just a few minutes.  I did make the recipe the following day, per directions and it turned out great.  I did use more beer than required, but beer can be good.  I will absolutly prepare this again, in the fall for Monday night football, so it is ready when I come home from work and the game is about to start.  (side note: for all of you bear and packer fans out there, GO VIKINGS!!)

So I took this recipe and cut corners... it worked!  I sauteed onions in butter in a pot and then added 4 12 oz beers, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/4 cup dijon mustard; heat to boiling.  I boiled the FORK-POKED ONCE bratwursts (I only buy Johnsonville) for 20 minutes.  After that, I grilled the bratwursts for 20 minutes and they came out beautifully brown.  The beer-onion mixture I simmered the whole time on LOW until 5 minutes before the bratwursts were done.  I drained the mixture so that the onions and pepper remained.... what a heavenly topping!  Serve on buns!

Good stuff.  Not a fan of peppers so I just omitted them completely.  I think the recipe was missing something...but still good.  Thanks for the post.

Neither my wife nor I is particularly fond of green peppers, so we substituted a yellow pepper. Regardless, the recipe is awesome! It's a terrific thing to make on a football playoffs Sunday, and then to enjoy during a game along with a beer or two.

I made this last weekend, to try it out before our first home game this season! And it's a definate GO for our tailgate!! I cut the recipe in half, since it was just the two of us, but used 1 whole green and red pepper, and  1 whole onion. Ended up using 2 bottles of beer for 1/2 the recipe. To be honest, we ate the bratwurst right out of the crock pot- didn't bother to put them on the grill!! For our tailgate, I will cook them in the crockpot at home, then take them to the game, where I plan to heat up the peppers, onions, and sauce, and then will grill the sausages to warm them up! Can't wait!!

This was a great brat recipe! My geuss is, those who didn't like it are not familiar with brats in general. I've tried them many different ways myself and loved this version! I did take Andi's suggestion and added a diced jalepeño to the slow cooker which added just the right amount of zing. I also toasted the hoagie rolls inside & out on the grill just before serving which added a nice texture. Other than that, cooked to spec using the 4 beers recommended by the original poster in the 1st review (yeah, read them all). Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a pretty good recipe ~ I did grill the sausages before hand.  Next time I will add the vegetables in the last two hours, as the way the recipe is written they were just mush! But a nice tasting and easy meal.

Great recipe, make sure you add extra onions and peppers if you like them.  And, for the people who didn't add peppers.  Of course something was missing, it was the ppers!  That's why they're IN the recipe.  Even if you don't like to eat them, you should still let them slow cook with the brats for that flavor.

Fantastic recipe.  We skipped the peppers as we don't like them.  After reading the author's comment, I decided to double the sauce instead of just add more beer.  (I used 2 cups BBQ sauce, 2 12 oz. beers, and 2 tsp. of liquid smoke.)  The brats came out very flavorful and tasty.

Didn't feel like starting up the grill on Super Bowl Sunday so put the brats under the broiler for a few minutes then returned them to the crock pot to serve.  Everyone liked them.

Great recipe!  Followed the instructions except for not being able to find honey-mustard barbecue sauce in three different stores.  Added mustard to honey barbecue sauce to make it work.  Ate them right out of the pot on italian rolls with more mustard and lots of the peppers and onions.  My husband loved it, and I will most definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a good recipe; HOWEVER, I do not use beer (too much sodium); I use Coca-cola (not diet, must be the "real" stuff), and it tastes wonderful.  Beer gives it a bitter taste in my opinion, but I don't like beer.

I made this for a cookout with twelve people. ONE person would eat it but he will eat anything!!!! Everyone said it was way too sweet... ruined the flavor of the brats!

MY HUSBAND LOVED THIS, I USED THE EXTRA CAN OF BEER ALSO, AND HAD TO ADD MUSTARD BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND HONEY MUSTARD BBQ SAUCE, I LIKED THE FACT THAT THE BRATS ARE COOKED, SO IT DOESN'T MAKE A FIREY MESS ON THE GRILL.

My husband said these are the best brats he's ever had.  However, my girls (who love brats) think they are too spicy.  If you take meals to people (ex. new moms) this is great.  You can take it over anytime during the day and it can continue to cook.  Then both families can eat at their own convenience.

Way, Way, Way better than the traditional Brats, Beer, Onions. The only thing I added was brown mustard on top. What flavor. Amazing, I used to not like brats but had to cook them because my husband is a Green Bay Packer Fan, and Packer Fans must eat brats on game day! Go Pack Go!!!

Gobbled up quickly at Super Bowl!  I combined hot links and brats. Could only fit in the 10, but ended up using almost twice as much beer and sauce to 'cover.'  We ate these right out of the crock pot, no barbeque finishing.  Used the peppers and onions, and the sauce to make these sandwiches really messy, but delicious!!

As a single guy I only made half of this recipe... kinda. I only cooked 5 brats but used the rest of the recipe as directed. The taste that these brats have is very(!), very good. However, the casing seems to lose consistency and become soft. The brat did not have that explosive crunch/burst that is mandatory. Perhaps less time in a crock would help. A local butcher might be able to help here as well. 5 hours softened the brat to the point that a grill could not bring it back. Overall it was good but lacking the classic brat crunch that I needed.

This was a pretty good recipe.  Nothing to get to terribly excited about, but not many leftovers either because it was all eatten up.  May make again sometime.  It's defintely a different way to eat your brats, but I still love the old school way with saurkraut.

Pretty delicious, but the result was a little soggy.  I will drain or try to absorb some of the liquid before serving next time.

Made this for dinner at our "Girls Weekend" at the lake.  There wasn't any leftovers to snack on the next day.  The brats had very good flavor, the peppers and onions were cooked just right.  This recipe is a keeper for an anytime meal!  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't care for the strong beer taste, but maybe it's just cause I've never had my brats this way. I added more barbeque sauce and let it all sit in the slow cooker for another half an hour and that seemed to do the trick.

I thought this was tasty, coming from someone who doesn't really like brats. (I think this would be SLAMMIN' with Italian sausage) I followed the recipe as written. I do recommend Dave's famous Georgia Mustard barbeque sauce--delish!

We all thought these were just so-so.I think they were a little too "sweet" flavored for me,but a couple people really liked the sweet taste.I'll probably make these again and make a batch of more tangy flavored ones that way everyone's happy.

This was excellent. I made this for a bbq we had and there was no leftovers.  I even used extra onion and green peppers based on the reviews posted.  Boy it was a hit and I'm sure to make again.

I do not normally like brats, but I decided to give this recipe a chance.  I actually liked these very much.  All the boys I cooked them for commented that they were very good and did not taste like normal brats- they had a sweet taste.  I left out the liquid smoke and bay leaves; I also had to use a 4 quart slow cooker but they still turned out great!

The closest thing I could find was honey bbq sauce, so I just added some mustard.  I thought they tasted good.  I was also out of charcoal, so I cooked in the slow cooker and then finished in the broiler.  It was a nice change from our normal brats.  I did have to add more beer to cover the brats.

Wow, fantastic!  This was so good and so easy.  We used turkey brats, which seem to be leaner.  Also needed 2 bottles of beer to cover everything.  Do use the hoagie rolls - we used regular buns and they just weren't big enough for all the good extras!

This was OK, not great.  I cooked on low in the crockpot for 6 hours.  I also had to add some more beer to cover the 8 brats, onions, and peppers.  I have leftovers so we'll see what they taste like tomorrow night.  Sometimes sitting overnight in all those cooked onions and peppers can make a big difference.

These were very good.  Since I made this in the winter I did not grill them so we just ate them out of the crockpot for supper.  I can't wait to try to grill them!  I didn't have liquid smoke, so I just left that out and it didn't effect the flavor any for us.  Great recipe.

I made this for our Super Bowl party.  I had really high expectations but it was just ok.  The flavors were bold but I feel that they didnt really compliment each other.  It was just okay.  I will not make this again.

These are soooo good. We make them every time we grill. I always use honey brown beer and use about 1 1/2 bottles. Buy extra bbq sauce. I always need more. But I usually use extra peppers b/c they make such a good topping on the brats after they're cooked. This is a recipe that everyone must try!

These brats were great!  I made them camping and everyone loved them.  I also made them for a party and made way too many so I froze the ones I didn't grill.  They were great re-heated on the grill.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  I'm making it for the 2nd time in 2 weeks....family RAVED about the taste.  The grilling definitely adds the final touch to the brats.  Planning on making this for a large crowd for college football games this fall, too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  Based on others reviews, I doubled the amount of onions and peppers.  The consensus was that it was a good recipe, but nothing spectacular.  Will hang on to the recipe, but probably won't make again any time soon.

This turned out really good.  However, I needed this for dinner so I made it on  top the stove.  Seared the brats first, then added the rest of the ingredients.  Kept it at a slow simmer for an hour until the sauce reduced by half and the brats were cooked.

I tried this recipe for a BBQ.   Most everyone liked it but I felt the sauce was too thin.  I cooked it down to thicken it and give the peppers and onions a little coating.   No one asked for the recipe so probably will not make it again.  I gave it four starts because hubby thought it was good.

I made 36 of them for a July 4th party. The only things I changed about recipe was that I used a combination of red, yellow, orange, and green peppers along with the onions and put them on high heat in crockpots due to time constraints.  They were amazing!!  Everyone absolutely devoured them!  I'll definitely be making them again.

Worst thing I've eaten in months.  The reviewers who asked why one would want to eat a bratwurst that had been essentially boiled for hours was dead on. I should have listened.  I was so looking forward to these but they were totally inedible.  I followed the recipe exactly! Really awful. Both hubby and I threw the entire batch in the garbage and were forced to eat toast for dinner.  I warn you off of this recipe.

I followed the recipe with the exception of I only put in 1 tablespoon of garlic. 2 tablespoons of garlic seems excessive  I was right it was great just didn't make enough.   Need to double the recipe.  Also I did Grill them and put additional sauce on when I grilled them, made it great!

The sauce this creates turns out amazing.  I've made it with brats and Polish sausage and got equal rave reviews.  The only thing I change is that I tripled all the veggies because we love them.

These are so delicious. I only made three since it is just my hubby and I. Cooked them in a small slow cooker and it still took a whole can of beer and a bit of water. I did what others suggested and grilled them first, on my George Foreman grill. I didn't have honey mustard BBQ sauce so I made Mustard Based BBQ Sauce from this site. Sooo easy and good. We will have these often.
Thank you RICOCHETRABBIT for submitting a winner.

Meh! I tried them this way to see if I was missing something and found them to be way too sweet. I like to cook mine in a smoker for HOURS or boil them in beer with onions and get some char on them from the grill I also saute the peppers & onions to develop individual textures and flavors.

My family absolutely loved this! We will definitely make these again.....and it is very easy!! The only change I made was instead of honey mustard I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce  honey flavored, then while eating put some mustard on top with the onions and peppers. Also....I omitted the bay leave..I just don't like them. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing

The brats came out tender and everything was very tasty.  We do not have a grill, so I browned the brats before putting them in the slow cooker.   Another reviewer mentioned she needed 4 beers to cover the food, and I did too.

This is a really easy and good recipe! I do not usually make Brats but decided to give these a try. I also could not find honey mustard barbecue sauce, so used honey sauce and added some spicy mustard. Used onions, red and yellow peppers. I did not have time to grill but they tasted great anyway. I will probably grill the next batch as the weather is improving.  Thanks for the recipe it is a keeper and I intend to use it lots this summer and into my favorite season of all football time!!

This was pretty good. I feel bad rating it at four stars, as the flavor might have been because of the beer we used. Next time I'll choose a different brew.

These were so good.  I too had to add Dijon mustard to honey bbq sauce and I also left out the bay leaves--didn't see any reason for it.  Cooked on high for 20 min and low for 4-5 hours.  The pepper and onion mixture was so good.  We also ate the right out of the crock pot.  Next time (and there will be a next time)  may put them on the grill as I am sure that really enhances them.

I never cooked anything with beer before!  I happened to buy brats because they were on sale, and found this recipe.  I'm glad I did.  The only change I made was I used honey BBQ sauce and added dijon mustard.  I did not grill mine, but put them in the oven and broiled for five minutes.  I don't know if that step was 100% necessary though.  Hubby and I both loved them.

My husband and I don't drink. So we hated this meal. (We don't mind the taste of beer or wine in meals) We think it was the beer we used. So if you drink beer maybe use one that you enjoy. This meal was very easy to make so I'm sorry it didn't work out.

This was an easy and great brat recipe---it didn't even stink up my house! I skipped the peppers because of hubby's heartburn issues and used a good dark beer--Michelob Amber Bach. Husband was not too happy about that part. Too bad. If anyone's having trouble finding the bbq sauce, Kraft makes honey mustard bbq sauce and I found it at Walmart---this was a shocker because our Walmart sucks and is typically out of whatever I need. Husband AND 3 kids loved it---even the picky one. I'll definitely be making this again, but I'll probably wait until there's not a foot of snow on the ground.
