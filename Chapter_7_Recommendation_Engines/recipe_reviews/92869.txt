I made this according to directions but didn't think it was all that good and I doubt I will make it again. It was dense and not fluffy. I ate one small piece, was not thrilled. Maybe something went wrong in the process but I don't know what.

Awesome!!!  My mother-in-law is known for her desserts and this was, by far, the best we've had.  Everyone at Thanksgiving thought it was far better than just the normal pumpkin pie.  It was the perfect closure to an amazing Thanksgiving dinner.

Really delicious and easy!  I used pumpking puree instead of the prepared pumpkin.  Had to cook for additional 5 minutes.
