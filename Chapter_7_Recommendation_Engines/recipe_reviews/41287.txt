I put them in a baking pan over a thin layer of sauerkraut, covered with the sauce and then added the V8.  Then I covered with foil and baked at 350 for an hour, removed the foil and baked another 1/2 hour.  I made the recipt for 20 servings and everyone loved them.  These are absolutely the best cabbage rolls I have ever had.

I used the slow cooker-4 hours-perfect. 
It's a fool-proof recipe because you can easily substitute some of the ingredients depending on what you have in the cupboard, ie: marinara sauce for the stewed tomatoes, Clamato juice for the V8, more or less of either meats,etc.  Very good using savoy cabbage.  Reheats well,freezes well.

These are YUMMY. My husband loved them. I usually make them using tomato soup. This recipe is much better using the stewed tomatoes. Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband really loved this recipe. It's a keeper. I cut down on the brown sugar. The next time I will omit it entirely. It was just a little too sweet, but that didn't stop us from cleaning our plates.

I don't think cabbage rolls are ever a quick to fix dinner, but this was quite simple.  I used brown rice and pureed diced canned tomatoes for a more tangy sauce.  It was great!  I did cut a v-type cut at the bottom of the cabbage leaves to remove the tougher part of the leaf.  Well worth the effort.

This recipe was wonderful my family and I truly enjoyed this one.  I did leave out the Italian sausage and the Italian stewed tomatoes I used regular stewed tomatoes instead and I also used minced onion instead of real onion.

You can treat this as a baked dish and practically triple the recipe as follows:  Increase pork to a full pound and use 3/4 of the cabbage head, cutting the larger leaves in half.  Cover and bake at 300 degree F for a couple of hours covered.  Remove cover and bake for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate.  For a more thick and hot-sweet-sour sauce, add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, a pinch of very hot dried pepper spice, increase brown sugar to 1/3 cup and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes before pouring over rolls.

Theese were great!  I did have to make a few substitutions though.  I did not have italian stewed tomatoes so used diced tomatoes and added a little italian seasoning.  I used brown rice instead of white, and ground chicken and turkey sausages instead of beef.  I also put a layer of sauerkraut in the bottom of the pot.  My husband and I loved these, I will definately make again.

This was a really good recipe. Found I had too much meat mixture, but well worth making again  I didn't add the V8 juice but will try it next time.  Yummy!!

I had fun with this one.  I assembled it at home in my dutch oven, added black olvies ... then took it camping and set it near the campfire for about an hour and a half. Dont lift the lid and dont set it too close. Wonderful.

I've made these for a few years now.  I have experimented a bit w/ the flavor of the sauce and I add vinegar to add some tang and so it is not too sweet. Try it, it is delicious.  Not much, equal or a little more to the brown sugar.  Also I have learned to definately use some V8 on top or they become too dry and harder to cut and eat. (Cabbage can actually become somewhat tough w/o enough liquid) These are definately a winner!

I did not care for this recipe.  I dropped the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and layered the ingredients, rather than forming rolls.  I like garlic but four cloves were too many for me. I baked it in a 350ÂºF. oven for 1 hour and found that there was a great deal of watery liquid at the end.  I didn't even care for the flavor.  Won't make again.

These are sooooo yummy!  I followed some advice of others by leaving out the brown sugar and tomato juice and used ground beef (lean) instead of pork and used brown rice instead of white.  Since I'm used to my cabbage rolls being cooked in the oven, I did cook mine in the oven at 350 for about an hour covered in foil....delicious!!!

Good except the cabbage had to be boiled for 15-20 minutes. The flavour of the sauce was good but it was very watery. I will probably add a can of tomato paste or something to thicken it up next time.

This was so easy and fun to make.  I have never made cabbage rolls before, but I will make these again  for sure.  I made it for my parents and my sister and my husband, and everyone liked it.  Thanks for sharing!  Oh, the V8 juice says optional, but I would definitely use it just to make sure the rolls don't get stuck to the skillet.  (If you slightly over cook them, like I did!)

AWESOME!!!  THE SWEETNESS IS IN THE STEWED TOMATOES.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WEETNESS, USE CHOPPED ITALIAN-STYLKE TOMATOES, AND ADD AS MUCH BROWN SUGAR TO SUIT YOUR TASTE.  THIS IS A KILLER RECIPE.  LOVE THE ITALIAN SAUSAGE.

I read previous reviews before cooking, I added only a touch of the brown sugar, and baked on 350 for 1hr.  There was a lot of filling, enough for 6-7 rolls.  I don't recommend the V8 juice, the sauce was rather watery on its own.  But they tasted wonderful!!!! My husband gobbled them up.

Delicious!  Read reviews before making these so I left out the brown sugar.  One reviewer mentioned forgetting the whole "roll" thing and layering the meat, cabbabe and sauce (which was an idea I liked--anything to save time) so I tried it and it worked out great.  I put it all in a 9x13 pan, covered with aluminum foil and baked.  Much easier and quicker.

Very Good! I suggest using a LARGE head of cabbage for bigger leaves. The medium head didn't provide enough big leaves - the outer leaves fell apart and I couldn't use them (boiled 10 mins, too!). So use a large head - and save or toss the excess. I made exactly as stated except placed rolls in a baking dish, covered with foil and placed in preheated 350 degree oven for 1 hour.  I think on the stovetop they have a tendency to scald and taste burnt (too close to the heat). I opted to add the V8 and next time will skip that - there was entirely too much liquid! Besides, if you don't have an extremely large skillet, it all won't fit, so the oven is a nice way to go (it's what restaurants do)! Overall a very tasty roll! I like steak sauce on top - adds a nice zip!

This is a great home made sauce, but, I found it a bit too sweet too.  I just added a little ketchup and vinegar and toned down the sweetness.

I made this and my husband thought it was wonderful. I thought it was too sweet, even after cutting the brown sugar in half. I used plain, stewed tomatoes instead of Italian and no V-8. I did use quite a bit of garlic...definitely wll make again.

I made this for my father-in-law's birthday.  He loved this dish and the leftovers.  I used pork sausage instead of italian sausage and only added one tbsp of brown sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!

Simple recipe - it was quick and easy!  Even my teenagers liked the cabbage which was a bit surprising!  I changed the ingredients a bit for the meat - just to suit our family's taste a bit better and I baked it in the oven 350 for 1 hr - but used the basics of this recipe and went from there.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe. After reading some of the reviews, I cut the brown sugar in half & omitted the V8. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper & chopped fresh green pepper in the sauce and in the meat mixture. I love the contrast when using brown sugar.

For all you health minded folks, I used ground turkey, turkey italian sausage, brown rice & sauteed the onions in olive oil & it turned out fantastic. This one is a keeper.

This was a very good recipe, although I did make a few changes.  I omitted the brown sugar after reading other reviews and they were still too sweet.  Maybe the cabbage?  I didn't add the V8 and still ended up draining liquid from the baking dish twice during the baking.  I will season them more next time, also.  Overall, they got rave reviews from my husband and my toddler who skipped the cabbage but loved the meat filling.  My Grandma has made galumpky (Polish cabbage rolls) since time began and I've never been able to replicate them.  These are so different that there's no comparison - yet they're equally good.  Thank you for the recipe.

I boiled half a cabbage for 10 mins, but the leaves were completely unworkable, falling apart before I could stuff them. I boiled the second half for about 5 mins, and it was fine. I needed quite a bit of tomato juice to keep the rolls and sauce moist, but even so the roll filling was a little dry. This is rather  a lot of work for something pretty run-of-the-mill. I doubt I'll make it again.

Quite tasty. I didn't use the V-8, and used olive oil instead of butter to be more heart-healthy, and to save time (and use what I had on hand), I added brussel sprouts to the skillet rather than rolling the meat in cabbage.

Made this last night, and everyone loved it. We ended up using ground venison meat mixed with pork sausage, wonderful flavor. Also cooked mine for about an hour and a half at 350 in the oven. We like additional sauce, so I added one of those Large cans of tomato soup to the sauce mixture, and put some of the sauce in with the rice and meat mixture, the rest of the sauce I put on top. Very flavorful. Kids ate all remaining leftovers today. Will make again.

AWESOME! They turned out perfect and so tastey; the only thing I did different was bake them in the oven instead of stove top for 1 1/2hours! Even better than my moms. Will definitely be making again very soon.

This was delicious.  It is far better than the other cabbage roll recipes I have tried at this site.  I didn't have garlic, so I added garlic powder and I also added dried minced onion instead of the real onion (my son hates onions) and it was still delicious.

I don't like cabbage, so I made this for my husband, but I ended it up liking it - he loved it.  I didn't use the sausage, worried about how much grease would be in the skillet & sauce, so to replace some flavor, I added a little garlic & italian seasoning & extra beef for the sausage.

I've never really had nor made Cabbage Rolls before. This recipe turned out better than expected. Instead of 2 cans of Stewed Tomatoes, I only added 1 and a Can of Tomato Soup with about 1/3 cup water. I left out the brown sugar and added some Crushed Red Pepper Flakes and used brown rice instead of white.  My dinner guest, who is an extremely picky eater, went back for seconds. I did not have enough large cabbage leaves to make more rolls, but had a bit of filling left over. I layered cabbage and filling in a small casserole dish, topped it with the tomato sauce and Parmesan Cheese and baked it. It was a great way to get rid of the leftovers and it turned out just as good as the rolls. Thanks for the recipe, I will make them again!

This recipe is a little labour intensive but well worth the time. This dish is excellent. My husband isnt so much with the tomato saucy recipes. I added a touch more brown sugar and he raved about it. Very good.

This recipe was very different from my mothers Polish version. The tomatoe sauce was different from what I'm used to. The filling on the otherhand was very delicious. My filling usually comes out very dry. This one was very moist. I'll make this recipe again using this filling and my mothers sauce.

I should have read all of the reviews before I made the sauce.  It was a little too sweet.  Next time I will omit the brown sugar.  The recipe was easy to make and my family loved them.

My first time having cabbage rolls.  Husband loved them.  Overall pretty good, but I had twice the filling I could possibly use, froze the unused half.  
Also, I think it would have tasted better using tomato sauce in the filling instead of the tomato soup, I could really taste the soup.

Tried this recipe as a Russian Orthodox Christmas Eve dinner (January 6).  My husband is a Slovak and grew up on cabbage rolls. He just couldn't stop raving about these! "Better than my mother's!" What better compliment can you get?

The flavor was good, but it was a lot of work.  I'm not familiar with cabbage rolls.  Why not simply layer the beef mixture, cabbage leaves, and tomatoes, rather than forming rolls?  If I make this again that's what I'll do.  Maybe that misses the point, but I'll have the same flavor with much more ease.

I made these once before and they were a big hit here, but that was a few years back.  This time I doubled the sauce and filling so that I  could use the entire head of cabbage.  This made about 12 rolls and I was able to freeze a batch.  I still had cabbage and sausage left so I made soup, just chopped everything up, added 28oz can of tomatoes and lots of stock & seasoning (or whatever you like).  If you feel like spending time in the kitchen, this is a great, freezer-friendly meal.  We all loved it...again:)

My boyfriend has a huge appetite and loves home cooked meals.  I made these for him and he at all but two in one sitting.  To me, that's the best rating anyone could get.
