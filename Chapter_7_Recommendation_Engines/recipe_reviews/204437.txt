First off I love hummus and basil! I've also tried all flavors imaginable.  This is one of the most flavorful recipes i've ever tried.   I made as is exept I cut back the olive oil a bit to cut some calories and I personally don't like some of the hummus you get that is just sitting in it.  I cannot wait to make more (ours is all gone) for my hummus loving family memebers!  Thx so much for the great recipe.

Was very good after I added only half the amount of basil. I also added 1/4 cup more of the sun dried tomatoes than the recipe called for, but came out good. Consistency was great, not runny at all.

This recipe mentions BASIL in the title. Of course you should expect that flavor to come through. I enjoy basil and this was an excellent use of a number of leaves from my many plants. The flavor of it comes through nicely and does not overpower the other flavors in the hummus. The garlic adds a nice bite as well. Thanks, Leslie A, for sharing your recipe!

I skipped the olive oil and used tahini and a little lemon juice instead.  I also used around 1-2 tsp basil.  Good!

This was quite good although very strong on the basil - afterall, this recipe IS for Sun-dried tom. & basil! :O)  Next time, I'll use a bit less for my own taste.  Overall, GREAT recipe!

This recipe sounded very tasty, but in fact I found it had too much basil and not enough olive oil and next time (if there is a next time) I will add more sundried tomatoes and cheese because it was pretty bland other than the extreme basil-y after taste. Even with chips, or pita, it is hard for me to enjoy. thnx anyways!

Great tasting hummus! I rinsed off the beans to get the skin off the beans and the extra sodium. I also make my hummus in the blender! This really helps to make the hummus super smooth. And you can cut back on the oil or cut it out completely if you are trying to go oil free for better heart health! I left out the oil and it was still great!

This just didn't do it for me. The flavor was just too bland. I think it needs some lemon juice. I also think I would have enjoyed more if I made this with feta instead of parm, but I don't think I will make it again, sorry.

I usually don't like hummus, but decided to try this for a couple events I needed to take an appetizer to.  It was a hit both times!  :)  One tip -- I made this in my Vitamix.  Next time I will use the food processor.  I think it will mix the ingredients more evenly.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!  Texture is perfect and goes great w/ Stacy's Naked Sea Salt Pita Chips.  I did not measure the basil, cheese or olive oil - just eyeballed it and it was marvelous.  Serving at a dinner party tonight.
