I didn't like this recipe. I tried it with crushed pinapples and club soda. Still couldn't get past the texture. Will definitely not try this again. Not even to change ingredients. It was not good.

Several problems: More sugar (1/2 cup sugar) Needs a bit of oil Needs 2 eggs Beer must be very mild in flavor! I hoped it would work for me but nope it needs these changes!

Ok so i read all the reviews and was very leary of trying this...but it's all i had in my cabinets and we had to have breakfast... so i altered it thus: I added 1/3 cup BROWN SUGAR rather than white I used crushed pineapple. I layered the bottom of the pan with melted butter crushed pineapple and brown sugar mixed together. I used homemade cherry wine instead of beer. The kids loved it. It was like pineapple upside down BREAD instead of cake but it was good. the wine flavor still came through but the topping with it was okay.

Extremely easy. The beer taste stayed with the bread. I would use crushed pineapple next time and may be try a different beer.

I give it 3 stars for the novelty aspect. I would leave either the beer or the pineapple out. They don't go really well together. Otherwise it came out pretty good. I followed the advice of others and did some of my own. Here are my total tweaks: I used 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 eggs 1/2 tsp vanilla 1/4 cup oil and half a bottle of beer. If I were to do pineapple without the beer I would probably up the sugar to 3/4 cup or 1 cup.
