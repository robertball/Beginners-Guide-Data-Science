These are absolutely amazing and impress everyone who tries them! I used a darker Ghiradelli chocolate (less sweet) and instead added a bit of Swerve (no calorie) sweetener to keep the total sugars down. I served them with some after dinner Port. Fantastic combo! I'll be making these again! The only issue I had was shaping them into balls - they melt VERY quickly and get all over your hands, so you must work quickly!
