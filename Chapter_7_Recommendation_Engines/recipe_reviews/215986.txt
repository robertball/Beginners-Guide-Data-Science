We love this recipe! Though I admit to some changes: I use riccota instead of the mayo called for - and I add the minced garlic to the spread mixture. I use sourdough bread, which I slice thickly and then toast a few minutes in the pre-heated oven (no soggy bread!). I spread the cream cheese/riccota mixture on the slices, THEN I cut the slices into cubes. It is a bit messy - and I did have to lick my fingers, but the mixture is so good, it is definitely not a problem! So far, I have also used frozen turkey meatballs - for ease - and I cut them in quarters. One of these days I am going to make the meatball prtion of the recipe, too! Oh! I don't add the water to the sauce, either - I just use 4 cups of sauce instead . . .

Although the taste of the meatballs were really, really good, the bread got soggy and the cheese mixture was funky tasting with the mayo.  I think that I would make this without the mayo and put it on a bun rather than in the casserole.

I love this but it is so diet unfriendly!  I make my own meatballs (using garlic, onion, bread crumbs, egg, milk, and beef - basically its my meat loaf recipe).  The first time I made it the bread came out too soggy, so now I use frozen garlic toast that I bake ahead of time.  This is a variation of a recipe I have used for years, and any pasta sauce that you like works fine.

I thought that I would like this but something is missing. It was just a bit too rich though.

The hubs enjoyed the meatballs (actually picked them out!) He thought the bread was too soggy. He didn't even eat the left overs :(

I liked it. It's much easier to just buy the frozen meatballs, but it was good and a change from some of my staples.
