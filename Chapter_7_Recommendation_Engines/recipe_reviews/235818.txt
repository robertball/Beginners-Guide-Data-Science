Too Cute! I'm an admitted peanut butter addict so I had to find an excuse to try this so when I had my niece over I figured it would be a fun thing to do and she just loved it! It's an easy, quick, inexpensive, healthy and delicious snack that I felt good about giving her. Plus it was really fun to make! You can sub almond butter or nutella for peanut butter and chocolate chips for the eyes. I didn't have cherries on hand so I used dried cranberries. No matter how you create your "reindeer" you'll love this not only for its simplicity but for the smiles it brings. Thanks for a great recipe!

What child (inner child even) wouldn't like this? This sandwich certainly brought a smile to the face! Chocolate chips for the eyes and a red hot for the nose work just fine when one is out of raisins and cherries. Thanks for the idea, T. L.
