This is just awesome atop grilled steaks.  Combine ingredients, chill or freeze, top the steaks, then put under the broiler to brown the cheese and slightly melt the butter just prior to serving.

You'll have to be a Gorgonzola lover for this one. You can also use a combination of Asiago and Gorgonzolla to cut the bleu cheese flavor. This butter is great on baked potatoes or to use by the dollop to flavor your meat or vegetable dishes. Thanks for sharing.

This is awesome served with steak.  First tried it at a nice restaurant and found the easy recipe here.  Now we don't eat steak without this!

This was amazing on top of Filet Mignon!! I cooked my filets' on the grill and then right before they were done I topped them with a spoonful of the butter. I then took them off the grill and then put them on a baking sheet, put them under the broiler for about 3 minutes!! They were amazing!! Gave such an amazing flavor!

I am not such huge fan of this cheese...but my husband said this was really good. It gave the meat just a little bit more of a kick...Thanks.

Really good.  I would suggest halving this for 3-4 people.  We added a little horseradish.  Then it was perfect!

Very good. I'll definitely be making this again. It melts all over the steak making a delicous sauce!

Yum! This was easy and yummy. I halved the recipe, and served it with steak. My husband cleaned his plate! (we are both gorgonzola lovers)

Thanks for sharing :)

This is so simple and easy to get together, but, was wonderful!  I topped my grilled porterhouse with a couple of pats and it gave the steak wonderful flavor!

If you're a hardcore Gorgonzola fan, you'll love this. If not, steer clear. :) Seriously though, it was very good melted over steaks. I did add a little garlic to the mix, which kicked it up a notch.

This is great, I use heavy cream and gorgonzola in a food processor for the same result. For some reason, there is something comforting about using a good cream and making my own butter from it. It's all yummy though.

Simple and delicious.  I don't have a food processor at home so I did a lot of hand mashing in a bowl with a fork which was simple and this was wonderful.  We used it as a topping on beef tenderloin servings; YUMMY!

This turned out great. We used it on our corn on the cob and then we had left over tough steak from a restaurant and it was divine.
