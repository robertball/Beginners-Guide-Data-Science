This was really easy and good.. Hubby does not care for tomato based sauces, so I substituted a jarred alfredo type sauce.. Still worked excellent. Daughter loved it too! Will definately make again.

Delicious!  I boiled the noodles before hand though (I was nervous about them not getting cooked well enough or becoming soggy) and I baked the casserole for 30 minutes at 350.  I also sauted onion, mushrooms and garlic and added that to the mixture.  Easy and soooo yummy!!

It took an extra 20 minutes to cook this dish completely even though my oven was preheated and I followed the recipe precisely.  At the descried time, the food was only very warm in the oven.  The pasta was soft but extremely doughy and uncooked, not unlike pasta put into a bowl of warm water for a length of time.  The taste was very bland and "cheap" and my husband didn't like it either.  I won't make this recipe again.  The only thing I can think that could have helped would have been to start the cooking process with boiling water instead of cold, except then it would have been difficult to mix completely prior to cooking.

I had left over ham and chicken from Easter and thought I would give this recipe a try.  I did cook the noodles 1/2 way first, before adding to recipe (I couldn't help it). Since I cooked the noodles a little, I also cut the water down to 1/3 of jar. Cut the temp to 375 and away it went.  The recipe was wonderful! Love the combination.  Thank You so much for this little find. Yum.

I changed this recipe a bit. I pre-cooked the noodles to just under al dente. Used ham, Cream of Celery (10.5oz) combined w/10.5oz 2% milk, and jalapeños. Topped w/cheddar & monterey jack cheeses. Turned out fabulous! :) Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

We had a ton of extra ham after Christmas dinner and were so happy to find this recipe!  We had all the ingredients on hand and it was simple, easy, and very tasty!  Thanks!

As previous reviewers had done, I also sauteed some sliced mushrooms and onions with garlic and added to (Paul Newman's) marinara sauce.  Other than that, followed the recipe to a tee and it was delicious!  The pasta nearest the top of the casserole were slightly more al dente than I would prefer, but all in all, this was a tasty, quick and easy dish to make and it pleased the whole family.  I will definitely make it again!

This was an easy meal to prepare, I did make a few changes. I added more ham, and baked it twice as long. I also added more of a variety of cheeses on top, since that's all I had available. Family loved this recipe, didn't even have leftovers. Will make again!

Easy and delicious!  Great way to use leftover ham.  I really liked that I didn't have to precook the pasta.

Very easy and quick dinner recipe.  Use any tube-shaped pasta.  And I usually have mushroom-flavored spaghetti sauce on hand.  Not crazy about onion or garlic powders, so I sautee chopped onions, minced garlic, and sliced mushrooms in a little olive oil, add spaghetti sauce and water and then combine with pasta and ham.  Italian turkey sausage is a great substitute for ham.

This was great, but I only gave it 3 stars because the nutritional information is very wrong. I chose this recipe because of the calorie count, but became suspicious after eating it. I analyzed the ingredients and it came to 421 calories per serving, and the other nutrients are more too, obviously. 

I did add onion, mushrooms, and green peppers, but they have insignificant nutrients, accounting for 15 calories per serving. Otherwise I used exact ingredients. 

How can we trust this 300 calorie section if incorrect nutrients are given? 

Otherwise, the recipe was great.

This was good and easy to throw together. I did not cook the pasta before I baked it and it turned out fine, just mixed it a couple times part way through cooking.

I was worried about the pasta being cooked all the way as well, I found that stirring every 15 minutes or so really helps. However, if you don't have time to do that, it could be inconvenient. I've also used chicken instead of ham. I love the melted cheese added at the end! Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

This was easy to make and everyone liked it, including my three toddlers... Lots left over for tomorrow night when I work. I added diced onions and green peppers. The dish was really runny, I had to use a server with holes to drain the extra fluid off the servings.

I tweaked the recipe a bit, cut it in half, didn't use exact measurements on the ingredients but close enough and used a Mexican mix shredded cheese instead of the mozzarella/parm and it came out great!  I like how quick and easy it is and the fact that the pasta cooks while in the oven...Pretty tasty!

Great idea!  Since I thought I'd play around with it, I used an alfredo sauce instead of a tomato base, and instead of regular ham, I went with a mix of prosciutto and pancetta.  The wife absolutely loved it and I think this one is a keeper!

This was great! I threw this all together the night before so I only had to pop it in the oven when I got home from work. I didn't have a problem with undercooked pasta probably since it was soaking overnight in my fridge. I loved that I didn't have to precook the pasta and it was something very different for leftover holiday ham.

Recipe was very basic, yet a good recipe for a quick spare parts meal. I added diced tomatoes and I'm sure this recipe would be great with banana peppers.

No problem using uncooked pasta-I have even made lasagna with regular uncooked noodles with no problem.  I have also made a version similar to this using cream cheese mixed in but did used cooked pasta then so it would melt a bit.  This is a good solution if you don't like using sauces. Very simple and the ham adds a lot IMHO...love to top with lots of mozzerella too!

I tweaked this recipe a bit to use up leftovers.  Instead of ham, i used chicken and crumbled bacon.  I fried it with minced garlic and onions before adding to the dish.  I didn't have rotini, so i used fettucini noodles broken into three.   I did read other reviews, so i boiled my noodles for approximately 5 mins before adding to the casserole to get them started.  I followed everything else exactly and it turned out perfect! This is a great starter recipe that can be tweaked and turned so many ways! There are endless possibilities with this basic start.  Thank you for sharing!

It's easy to make, but pretty bland in flavor.  I'll keep it solely for using left over ham, but I sure wouldn't buy a ham specially for this one.

This was pretty good.  I had some leftover cubed ham (only about 8oz) and I did an ingredient search to find this recipe.
I used macaroni noodles and cheddar cheese and as mentioned only had 8oz of ham.  Everyone liked it.  I would use 1/2 the pepper next time though.  It was a little spicy for me.

Kids especially enjoyed this recipe.  Used real garlic, and added red pepper and peas for colour.  Had no trouble with the cooking time, it was ready in 40 minutes.  VERY easy.  Our family would probably like a few more spices in it.

This was a great recipe! I accidentally added the cheese as I was mixing the ingredients and it still turned out great. I did use sharp cheddar since that was what I had on hand and used gluten free rotini and the dish was delightful! I will definitely prepare it again.

Added sautéd onion and red pepper.       And cooked penne pasta for 5 minutes before adding it.        Baked for 1 hour at 350 and then added cheese and baked at 400 uncovered for about 5-10 minutes to brown cheese slightly.

I will definitely make this again, but I did make a few changes. I only used the mozzarella, not the parmesan. I used white pepper instead of black and I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I also used a garden spaghetti sauce instead of the recommended one. But this came out very good! I loved it.

I gave it a try even though I think ham and tomato based sauce are not well suited together.  I still feel that way.  It was ok.

I made it tonight and like others added sautéed mushrooms and onions, and also cooked the noodles before hand. I don't like heavy tomato sauces so I made it with half spaghetti sauce and half 4 cheese Alfredo sauce. I used diced pepperoni in addition to the ham. When I added the cheese at the end I also topped it with some French's french fried onions. It turned out well but it wasn't a favorite.

After reading the other reviews I also cooked the pasta before mixing it in and cooked it for 30 minutes on 375 covered and then 5 minutes uncovered. I also sautéed some onions and garlic before mixing it in too. Everyone loved it! Will defintely be saving this recipe

I chose to cook the pasta first, omit the water and bake at 370 for about 35 minutes.  For my family's tastes, this recipe needed a little more flavor and some family members did not care for the ham with the pasta.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, Danielle M!

Spaghetti just got easier!  This recipe was great, just with a few little tweaks.  I was a little concerned about the pasta getting fully cooked after reading other reviews.  This is not surprising because almost every recipe online does this.  Well, all I did was raise the temperature to 450 and set the timer to 45 minutes, and I also used a wider pan.  Be sure to tightly cover with foil and stir half way through so the pasta doesn't stick to the pan.  I'll be making this again - yum!

Needed to do something with almost a pound of leftover ham, and this worked. Don't know why these recipes seem to not include salt, since I find all pasta recipes need salt - pasta having virtually no flavor without salt. Anyway, I found it acceptable as a way to avoid having to throw away ham, but other family members really liked it. I did pre-cook the pasta for 5 minutes since I personally do not care for the heavy starch taste in the food when the pasta is cooked with the rest of the ingredients, cut the water back to 1/3, and baked it for 30 minutes without the aluminum foil, just like I cook baked macaroni and cheese - the cheeses melted over the top were a nice addition.

This is fabulous!  Nice and spicey.  Leftovers are great for my lunch at work.  I only use about 1/2 the parmasean because 1/4 cup is too much for me.
