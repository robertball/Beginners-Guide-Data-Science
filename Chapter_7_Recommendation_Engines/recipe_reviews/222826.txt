My sister gave me this recipe years ago and I make them quite often. Fresh rosemary is great in this. I like the potatoes a little more browned but when I cook it long enough to brown the potatoes, the garlic gets a little brown too which makes it bitter.

I didn't think that the timing was correct. I cooked them for an hour and they still weren't soft. I think it'd be yummy sauteed over a skillet.

These were pretty good they way they were but next time I'm gonna use more cheese and add some additional seasonings for a little more flavor.

These turned out really good.  The cooking time seems to be a little on the low side, as mine ended up taking 50 minutes. I topped with a little more Parmesan than it called for, but that's just due to preference.  Will definitley make these again.

I loved how the potatoes came out. I didnâ€™t have 4 medium size red potatoes. Instead I used 6 small potatoes for recipe. It cooked well either way.
