This was just incredible for a number of reasons. First, it's super easy and takes mere minutes to prepare. Second, it makes for a beautiful and impressive presentation. Third, this is great for those watching their carbs. And last, it's delicious! I used turkey cutlets, but I think pounded flat chicken breasts would be better (hubby disagrees vigorously on this point, preferring the turkey). I browned them, for just a couple of minutes, in a mixture of olive oil and butter and, of course, the minced garlic.  I used fresh asparagus rather than frozen. Most important, for the sauce, I used part milk, part water, and added some fresh lemon juice, which I think gave it a huge boost in flavor, as well as a little tang. I had debated adding some fresh tarragon to make it a Bearnaise sauce (since I have it growing in my garden anyway) and really wish I would have. The good thing is that I can always try that next time, since I WILL be making this again.  Too easy and too good not to! I garnished this with a sprinkle of finely chopped parsley and the result was a dish worthy of serving to company.

What a great idea! I made this as directed except I used 1 lb fresh asparagus for 4 people instead of the frozen.  The finished producut looks especially impressinve!  We were not that impressed with the texture of the turkey cutlets, so next time I'll use boneless, skinless chicken breasts pounded thin.  Thanks for and easy impressive recipe!

We all enjoyed this dinner. I also steamed fresh asparagus like other reviewers. The sauce could have used some lemon juice, and I will try it again with that addition. I also tried 1/4 t. dried tarragon, which someone else suggested & enjoyed the flavor boost. This was an easy & enjoyable meal... thanks!

We had this for last night's dinner and it not only was picture perfect but also delicious.  As suggested by a prior reviewer, I used skinless boneless chicken breasts which had to be pounded a bit and fresh asparagus cooked in the microwave.  The chicken had to be cooked more than 3 minutes on each side. I used Knoor's Hollandaise sauce made as directed on the packet but next time will add a little lemon juice. Easy to make and totally delish.

This was really easy & everyone loved it! I used chicken breast pounded flat, imitation crab meat instead of shrimp, and made the hollandaise from the "Blender hollandaise sauce" recipe on this site.

This was excellent and quick. I also used Knorr Hollandaise mix and added lemon juice and a little bit of tarragon. I used chicken breasts that I pounded out a bit. My fiance' thought it looked and tasted like something you would get in a restaurant. Not a morsel left over!

I was a little bit skeptical about making this recipe.  I was thinking, turkey and shrimp in the SAME dish? How could that be? It actually turned out pretty good.  Really fattening though, but hey once in a while is okay right.  Especially when I didn't have asparagus in the plate :S. I used chicken instead of turkey.  DEFINITELY pound the chicken.  I added a splash of lemon juice with the shrimp.  Served it over linguinie pasta (mixed with butter again) and lemon juice.  This recipe should not be made often.

I used chicken instead of turkey, butter instead of marg, and fresh asparagus. This was good but the packet Hollandaise sauce I used was pretty blah. Thanks, Colleen!

Fab recipe, loved it! As suggested added lemon juice and tarragon to the sauce as well as salt and pepper.  Used fresh green beans since I didn't have Asparagus.  Pounded turkey breasts, sprinkled with S&P and sauteed in smart balance with the garlic. Removed & added shrimp.  Put cooked shrimp & beans into sauce to rewarm & poured over fillets. (also I cut the shrimp in thirds).  The flavor was great

Good recipe, but the hollandaise packet needed a little spicing up.

My turkey cutlets were thin so they came out a little tougher than I liked, but otherwise the flavor was wonderful.

I'm giving this a four because the recipe has good beginnings. I used boneless chicken breasts because I feel that turkey can be a little dry, and I believe that fresh asparagus is a must for this kind of recipe. Used evoo in lieu of the margarine and added some seasonings. I had frozen crab in the freezer which I subbed for the shrimp. Very elegant dish that your guests would enjoy. "Cooking 101"; you're so cute and thank you so much Colleen for a very nice recipe that we all enjoyed!

I used low sodium canned asparagus and I am sure it would have been so much better with frozen or fresh, but all the same it was really, really good!!!  It caught my eye   because I had purchased turkey cutlets and was browsing the recipes.  We have a dachshund named Oscar, so it was a no-brainer.  Did not disappoint.

A tasty dish!  I didn't change anything but next time instead of the turkey cutlets, I'm going to use pork cutlets.

I thought this was okay, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough to make very often. My 8 year old daughter loved it, but I think she'd eat anything smothered in hollandaise sauce. I used fresh asparagus because I never use frozen. I also didn't add the shrimp in because I didn't have any. It was pretty easy to make.

This turned out great.  We used left over white turkey meat cut thin.  Turned out great.
