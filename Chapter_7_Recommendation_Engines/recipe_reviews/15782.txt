These cupcakes are easy and delicious. I did make a couple of modifications, though. The recipe just didn't seem chocolate-y enough for me, so I doubled the amount and added 2 extra Tbsp of sugar. Excessive, perhaps, but mmmmmm. 
I substituted a 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 the oil. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1 tsp of cinnamon. I forgot to put in the nuts and didn't frost them.
4 for the original recipe - 5 for my revised one!

Absolutely terrific! Per the other reviews I doubled the chocolate and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup (didn't need to add any applesauce to make up for it, but there is additional fat in the extra 2 squares of chocolate.)  I grated golden zucchini with the skin on and used white whole wheat flour because I try to get as much fiber in as I can for my kids. I used white chocolate chips instead of nuts because my kids won't eat nuts.  They turned out GREAT! Oh, and get this, I was gonna' make frosting, but my 11 year old son (who normally thinks frosting is the best part,) told me not to.  I made a batch of mini-muffins with the batter first and sprinkled them with powdered sugar because the kids were hungry and I was running out of time.  My son had one and said the powdered sugar was perfect, and frosting them wouldn't make them any better!  Try them; you'll like them.

I made two small changes in this recipe--I cut the sugar back to a cup and I halved the vegetable oil and used one half cup homemade applesauce. Baked at 350, mine were done at 20 minutes. Mine did not turn out like cupcakes, they were more like muffins. Even so, the flavor of these was fantastic......even with the substituted applesauce. VERY moist. The whole family loved these. NOTE: I got 18 "muffins" from one recipe, not 24.

These were easy to make, and they turned out really well -- very moist.  I was looking for a cupcake recipe that wasn't too sugary (because I worry about all the sugar that kids are fed) for my son's third birthday.  I left out the nuts because I wasn't sure if the kids would like them.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla just to give the batter a richer taste -- I don't know if it really made a difference or not.  I frosted them lightly with a simple buttercream frosting.  Delicious!  (And the chocolate color hides the presence of the zucchini from picky young ones.)

These are absolutely delicious!  I think, after making these, I actually prefer these to regular chocolate cake, because they are incredibly moist and yummy!  I made a few changes: First, I doubled the chocolate in these, to add a richer flavor as some other reviewers mentioned.  Second, I used 3/4 C applesauce, and only 1/4 C oil.  I am a health nut, and I can't in good conscience use 1 C of oil!  The result was perfect, and these are de-lish!

These cupcakes were great.  I received an extremely large zucchini from my brother's garden and decided I needed lots of different recipes to experiment with and this one definitely made the grade.  The cupcakes were moist and the chocolate frosting is a great addition.  My husband was a little surprised when he bit into one because he thought they were just plain chocolate cupcakes, but he said they were good even with the zucchini added.  This will be a great way to get the kids to eat their vegetables.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these for a social gathering and they were snatched up immediately. I had actually used whole wheat flour instead of white which seemed to give the cupcakes more of a muffin-like texture.

Fantastic!  My kids had no idea there was zucchinni in them at all!  :)  As per other reviews, I doubled the chocolate and used 3/4 cup applesauce & 1/4 cup oil.  I din't have baking chocolate, so I used cocoa powder (2T unsweetened cocoa powder & 1 T vegetable oil for each chocolate square, and I used whole wheat flour.  I will definitely use these again, and would even make them more frequently because it's a treat I can feed my kids that's special, yet more nutritious.  I did use chocolate icing with sprinkles, but lightly--just enough to make the sprinkles stick.  **update** These are also good without icing on top as just plain chocolate muffins!  We now make these about once a month, freezing half for later in the month, and eat them as muffins for snack or desert.  Wonderful recipe!

Wow! What a good cake! Everyone around asked for the recipe!
It's even good without egg & nuts (removed because of my daughter's allergies). Good idea to use cupcakes.

Wasn't that impressed.  Maybe it was because I used applesauce instead of oil.  Seemed like it was missing something.  Maybe, I'll try once more and add vanilla as someone suggested.  The frosting was the best part of these.

These were really good muffins and a great way to use the zucchini in my garden.  I used a buttercream frosting and topped them with baking m&m's.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are not a deep, dark chocolate so swapping out the nuts for chocolate chips really made these double-chocolaty special.  The zucchini is not apparent, except for the obvious moistness it contributes to the cake.  In addition to great flavor and moistness, the top develops a little crust to it, almost like the outside edges of a cookie.  I frosted these with "Mocha Frosting," also from this site.  I wasn't sold on the nuts, nor did the "package of chocolate frosting" appeal to me.  But the combination of the cupcakes, studded with semi-sweet chocolate chips and a milk chocolate frosting, was simply awesome good.

Thanks to reviewer Henry Smith for his suggestions on using 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate (I used 1 ghirardelli unsweetened chocolate baking bar), substituting a half cup of unsweetened applesauce for a half cup of oil (didn't miss it!), and adding 1 tsp of cinnamon was a way nice complement to the chocolate. I don't think you need any extra sugar if you are using frosting on these babies. I also left out the nuts and they were so light & chocolately. Rather delicious & fun to eat!--for kids or adults.

Wonderful recipe. I made this into a two layer cake and frosted it with a fudgy frosting. My family doesn't like zucchini bread and loved this recipe requesting it again.

These were terrific!  I always substitute applesauce for oil, whole wheat for white flour, and Splenda for sugar when I bake (I used a combination of the Brown Sugar Blend and regular Splenda since I didn't have enough brown), and I also took the suggestion of doubling the chocolate.  They were moist and flavorful without being overly rich or sweet at all, and with the Sugar-Free Frosting recipe from this site (Lite Cool Whip, neufchatel cheese and sugar-free choc. pudding mix) came out to about 170ish calories apiece! I'll be making them again for a charity bake sale - dieters need goodies, too! Might even try crushed pineapple instead of applesauce and omit the chocolate... :-p

Excellent, it's like a chocolate brownie, very moist.  Made a few changes, 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 applesause.  1 1/2 t. vanilla.  Half of the batter, I added 1/2 c. coconut and mini chocolate chips.  Topped it off with a fluffy white icing.

These are chocolatel-y good!  Doubled chocolate like everyone else (any less and chocolate flavor would be weak) and used 3/4c applesauce + 1/4c oil.  Shockingly delicious!  Will frost with Rich Chocolate Frosting from this site. Perfect birthday cupcake!  The flecks of zucchini will totally go unnoticed!

I'm always confused as to whether I should give a '5' when on the very first try, I make modifications.  That being said, I do think this is a great recipe... with a few changes.  First, call me crazy, but I'm not a big fan of chocolate zucchini cake, so I left all chocolate components out.  Secondly, I cannot wrap my head around using a full cup of oil, so I used 1/2 c. of oil and one 8-oz. can of drained, crushed pineapple.  The pineapple makes the cupcakes SO moist and garnered lots and lots of compliments!  Furthermore, I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon for a great, spiced kick!  Funny enough, I got 24 cupcakes and 2 mini loafs out of this recipe.  To take the cupcake up a notch, I covered in cream cheese frosting.  It's a keeper in my book.

really good recipe.  My four year old made faces and gagging noises when I added the zucchini, but he loved the finished product.  A word of warning though, if you're looking for a rich decadant type cupcake, this is not it. These are perfect for kids.

We really loved this recipe. I made these for my 5 year old daughter's birthday party - the parents asked for the recipe, and the kids asked me to give their parents the recipe too!  A huge hit. The only modification I made was to use 3/4c applesauce and 1/4c oil in place of the oil recommended, and omitted the nuts. I topped them with a quick homemade vanilla buttercream instead of store bought.  Fantastic.  The only thing I would "warn" about is that they are not super chocolate-y, so if you are looking for a chocolate fix you probably will not get it here.  They do however have a delicious flavor, are very moist, and excellent texture.  Try them!

Wonderful. Couldn't tell there was zucchini in them at all. used half oil half applesauce because I had some leftover homemade applesauce to use up and that worked great.

These cupcakes were great! My preschooler and toddler loved them. I pureed the zucchini and left out the nuts. Since I only had cocoa powder, I used 6 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons of shortening to replace the unsweetened chocolate squares.

Yum! My first batch I followed the recipe exactly and loved them.  The second batch I used white sugar instead of brown as I was out of brown sugar, and added 1 cup of miniature milk chocolate chips.  They were so yummy!  I topped them with homemade chocolate butter cream frosting.

These were just what I was looking for! I substituted cocoa powder, and doubled the chocolate as suggested. So, I used 6 T cocoa powder, and the full cup of oil to make up for not using melted chocolate. I also added a teaspoon vanilla and a half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Yum! I've eaten one plain so far, and it was perfectly moist and had great texture. I plan on topping them with lots of cream cheese frosting, which will probably cancel the healthiness of th zucchini, but will be so delicious!

These are great! I've made them a few times already and everybody loves them. I changed the recipe a little bit by adding a little cinnamon ( suggested below) and using half wheat flour and half white flour. They still turn out delicious!

These cupcakes were very tasty. I followed the recommendations of Henri Smith and used a 3.5oz Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate bar, applesauce and cinnamon. I thought that the walnuts added a nice touch to the cupcakes but they would have been good without them also. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent.  Moist. Very flavorfull.  I increased the chocolate to 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate.  I added 1/2 cup of applesauce and only 1/2 cup of oil.  Didn't miss the oil.  I also used Splenda brown sugar but cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 Cups.  (Every little bit helps) I didn't have nuts so I put 5 chocolate chips on top of each muffin before cooking them.  My kids and neice went nuts over this receipe.

Very Good! I doubled the chocolate (and used a Ghirdeli bittersweet bar) for extra chocolatey taste. No one could tell that they had zucchini in them and the texture was great! I left out the nuts since I was serving them to company and didn't know if they liked them. They were great with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site. Thanks!

I've made brownies with zucchini before and wanted to give these a try.  Very good with a few modifications...  Used 4 (1 ounce) squares of unsweetened bakers chocolate.  It still didn't seem as chocolatey as I was hoping.  Used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup natural applesauce.  Left out the walnuts all together and frosted with homemade chocolate buttercream.  They were good plain (and very moist) but I wanted something a lil richer in flavor.  I think next time I might put the zucchini in a food processor to really pulverize it.  The strands of zucchini were too large for me but it didn't subtract from their overall taste.  I think in the end maybe the brownies I've made suit my taste more but it's all personal preference.  I would still make these again.

I think that overall they were pretty good.  I definitely added more chocolate and feel that it was a little dry.  Next time I will add more oil/applesauce or even a box of pudding to moisten it up a bit.  thank you for the recipe!

Nutty and flavorful!!  Glad I followed the advice of others and doubled the chocolate.  I also used half brown and half white sugar as it was what I had on hand.  All else was the same, although I used homemade chocolate frosting.  These were so delicious and the kids LOVED!

Love this recipe! The only alteration I did was omit the nuts due to a food allergy in my son's class.  This will not make or break the recipe. (I do love nuts..but they were great even without)  I highly suggest anyone trying this recipe out...it will change even the most hated squash/zucchini haters hearts! Enjoy :)

Wow, these must be the best chocolate muffins I ever ate! Moist and chocolatey, but also crunchy because of the nuts. Really, really good. I made a few minor adjustments, like doubling the chocolate, using less oil and sugar and just leaving out the frosting (personal preference). They still turned out amazing and I'll definitely be making these again soon!

I am a huge fan of zucchini desserts so I was super excited to try this one!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except (like others) I used 1/2 cup oil & 3/4 cup apple sauce and a splash of vanilla. Turned out really yummy and moist! Everyone in the house was skeptical when I told them there was zucchini in the recipe, but after they ate 'em they were hooked. I used a cheese grater to grate the zucchini (came out in matchstick size) and you really can't taste it at all (if that matters).

I am giving only 4 because I did make two changes - I cut back on the oil by 1/4 c, and I doubled the chocolate.  But let me tell you - this was delicious.  I mean, so good I literally may never make chocolate cake any other way again.  It was moist, had a great texture, an absolutely fabulous flavor, and held up well over the next day or two.  The cake didn't last longer than that!  Definitely try these - if you look chocolate cake you will not be disappointed.

We thought these were pretty good...I did change a few things tho.  I used powdered cocoa and followed the directions on the package to make it the equivilent to the chocolate squares, I also tossed in roughly 2 T of milled Flax Seed.  My boys will not eat nuts if they can see them so I used my chopper to make the walnuts as small as I could.  I also tossed in a package of dark chocolate choco chips.  My kids have no clue about the zucchini being in them...and they eat them up every time.  I make homemade choco icing (following recipe on the powdered cocoa box) sometimes we ice them, sometimes we don't.  They are so moist and delicious!  My step father is very picky about desserts....doesn't want to eat anything that is high in fats/sugar/etc. He LOVES THESE!  He actually has requested these...he's never requested any desserts from me before!  To make him even more happy I tossed in some cranberries at Thanksgiving.  :)  He loved them!  I'm thinking I may add some cinnamon next time we make them.  :)

Great cupcakes!  I also altered the recipe is bit by increasing the chocolate to 3 ounces, using 1/2 c oil, and 1/2 c applesause, and 1/2 chocolate chips instead of nuts.  They turned great and even my picky eater ate two cupcakes and never noticed the zucchini!

I am only giving this a 3 because of the lack of flavour.  Even doubling the chocolate wasn't enough we had to add some cocoa powder as well. Not bad but not great.

I made these just as the recipe suggested, except that I doubled the amount of chocolate and didn't bother with the frosting. To be honest, I didn't get as far as the frosting, as my Labrador Retriever helped herself from the kitchen counter while the cakes were cooling and snaffled 6 before I realised. My family and Rosie the dog thought they were great!

Henry Smith made the best call on doubling the chocolate!  I also used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil, and tossed in a splash of vanilla.  These are AMAZING!  But the best part?  My four year old vegetable hatin' boy won't be hip to the fact that zucchini is in these, because with all that chocolate, you CAN'T SEE IT!  Ha!  Haven't frosted them and honestly, don't see the need.  **Updated** Today, I made these again, and used (instead of oil) 1/2 cup baby food prunes and the rest applesauce), to help out the lil' guy.  And, I frosted them with SHINY CHOCOLATE GLAZE for fear that the prune flavor may come through - but it didn't.  File this tip away, parents!! You may need a trick up your sleeve in cases like this.

Great recipe! I made mini cupcakes and brought to my daughter's Kindergarten class and they all devoured them! I didn't tell them about the zucchini:)
I added the cinnamon as per somebody's recommendation and substituted the nuts for mini chocolate chips. Yummy! It made 72 mini cupcakes (reduce baking time to about 15 minutes)that looked and tasted great topped with a bit of pink icing and heart shaped sprinkles for Valentines.

Family and guests loved it. I followed the recipe to a T but because a lot of them are watching their sugar intake, I decided not to frost it. Also, instead of muffin cups, I baked it in two small loaf pans. Great especially if you have kids who do not like to eat their vegetables.

These are really good and I like the healthy changes substituting applesauce for oil and increasing the chocolate and adding vanilla.  These aren't to-die-for, but they are great and I love using zucchini in it to add moisture and texture.  These bake up beautifully and it made 24 perfect cupcakes that taste best warm and fresh!

These were sooo yummy. By accident, I added double the amount of chocolate, but no complaints here! It made it even better. I also added a little extra zucchini and walnuts. Next time I'll try replacing the oil with applesauce and the flour with whole wheat. This is also fun to see what I can slip by my finicky older sister, who has sworn off most vegetables, as they are "disgusting". Ha! We'll just see how she stands up to these goodies.

These are incredibly delicious. My son gave them 10/10 because 5/5 just wasn't good  enough. Following other suggestions I added 1/2 c. applesauce for part of the oil, cinnamon, vanilla and 1c. mini chocolate chips. I used the Cherry Cookie Chocolate Frosting. YUM...

This makes a mildly sweet muffin with a delicate chocolate flavor.  They are delicious alone without any frosting at all.  I frosted mine with the following recipe because I did not have premade frosting on hand . . . 

1/3 cup white sugar
1/4 cup water
1 cup mini chocolate chips

Combine sugar and water on stove, heat to boiling.  Whisk until sugar is dissolved.  Remove from heat and add mini chocolate chips.  Whisk until dissolved and smooth.  Let cool to desired temperature and use immediately.  Makes enough to frost at least 36 muffins generously.

I used about 3 squares of chocolate, 1 1/4 c rapadura, 1/2 cup olive oil, ~1/2 cup applesauce, and whole wheat pastry flour.  They had a nice texture and the zucchini made them very moist.  I think I may try adding a few chocolate chips next time, and probably move up to 4 oz of chocolate.

Wow, amazing!! I got so many compliments on these.  So light and moist! I did double the chocolate, used 3/4 c applesauce and only 1/4 oil.   I didn't peel half the zucchini, but next time I will as the green skin didn't totally dissolve!!

This was wonderful!  I kept it the same, as I don't like to alter recipes (unless I don't have ingredient), and my daughter (very picky and doesn't like veggies), has been eating them like nothing! I did change frosting, using canned white frosting though. Made second batch as I needed more, using semi-sweet chocolate since out and no nuts, and came out a lighter brown color.  Liked these much better. :)

I don't know what I did wrong, but this came out with a very bitter, unpleasantly strong zucchini taste.  My only theories are that I grated the zucchini too coarsely (used the grating attachment on a food processor-- so the pieces were roughly the size of matchsticks) or that the zucchini was too old.    I'll try grating it more finely next time, but for now, I'm not all that impressed.

Excellent Recipe! You can't even taste the zucchini in them...and we put about an extra 1/2C in it! We cut out 1/2 of the oil as well because we added more zucchini, and of course, added 2 more squares of baking chocolate as did many other readers. Will Definitely make again!

Fabulous! I made several modifications: - Used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil - Used 6 Tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder (didn't have chocolate squares) - Added 3/4 Cup dark chocolate chips - Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 Cup white flour - Omitted the walnuts. Perfect!!!!!!! The zucchini makes them very moist!

Tasty - had zucchini from the garden that needed to be used up... Made these for a bridal shower I was hosting. Didn't have much time, so just used store-bought icing for on top. I usually like chocolate things like this warm from the oven, but I find anything baked with zucchini tastes better the day after. I also didn't have enough chocolate squares, so instead I used 3 tbsp of cocoa (plus an additional tbsp of oil) for each square.

These were all right day one, much better the second day and actually pretty good when frozen and then thawed. I did increase the chocolate, used half oil and half applesauce and used half whole wheat flour. I would make them again but only with intention of freezing. Much healthier treat for my kids.

Very similar to the Taste-of-Home cupcakes we used to make before we went gluten-free and threw out the recipe.  Anyhow, these make great gluten-free cupcakes, with the following modification to the original recipe:  Use 2 cups of Carol's sorghum blend (35% sorghum flour, 35% corn or potato starch, and 30% tapioca starch), plus 1 1/2 tsp of guar gum (or 1 tsp xanthan gum).  I also went with 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, and doubled the chocolate, although I actually thought they were TOO chocolaty (this from a chocoholic)... but I think I was used to the taste of home recipe that wasn't very chocolaty.  I think with the original amt of chocolate they could pass as "muffins" (sounds healthier) but with the doubled chocolate they are definitely "cupcakes"...  actually, they are more like brownies, as my 5-year-old son pointed out.    BTW, I also had to increase the baking time considerably (~35 minutes).  FYI:  I made another gluten-free batch again substituting yellow squash in place of zucchini and  1 1/2 tsp vanilla instead of the chocolate, and all oil instead of my original applesauce substitution.  They turned out GREAT.  I might have considered putting vanilla frosting on them but the kids gobbled them up anyhow, so I didn't bother.  They turned out carrot-cakish, so if I want a carrot cupcake I'll just use this recipe and throw in some carrots too.

Cupcakes with a hint of chocolate...The're excellent.  I did'nt have walnuts so I added Pecans instead (delicious).  I also added chocolate chips to half the batch and that definately hit the spot!

No one knew that they had zuccini in them...for those picky eaters: these babies were a hit!

I rated it 5 stars with the modifications.  These cupcakes were absolutely delicious, i didn't even ice them (no extra sugar for the kids please :))  I subbed 3/4 applesause and 1/4 oil, subbed whole wheat flour for half the ap flour, and used half a bag (6oz) mini chocolate chips.  My kids were begging for more.. they were so good!!  Thank you for this delicious and healthy recipe.

Very moist and yummy. The only problem is that they didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped. Maybe I'll add a little bit more chocolate next time.

These were great un-frosted.  I would prob. frost w/ vanilla or cream cheese frosting, as choc. might be too much.

I substituted 3 Tbsp. cocoa pwd + 1 Tbsp. oil for each square of chocolate.

I used Ghiardeli Semi-Sweetened chocolate and 'Enova' Cooking oil instead of vegi oil and they turned out a moist, shiny dark golden brown...these looked so delicious I hated to frost them.  We tried both Chocolate cream-cheese frosting and regular cream-cheese frosting and both were perfect for a variety.  Beating the egg and sugar mixture for the approprite length of time is essential, also.  I would reccommend muffin cups for ease in removing from pan to cool.  Pull out as soon as done and cool on a rack before frosting.  YUM YUM!!!

These were delicious - even without frosting! I did double the chocolate as advised by reviewers and subbed applesauce for 3/4 of the oil. When grated into shreds smaller than coleslaw/shredded cheese, zucchini was still visible in cupcakes. Couldn't figure out whether to squeeze water out of zucchini or not, so I just kept it in and it was right on point!

This is a nice snack cake.  They rose beautifully and looked fabulous topped with a simple cream cheese frosting I had made.   I wish it had a little more chocolate flavor, but I will just substitute chocolate chips in place of the walnuts the next time.

I needed a good idea for the first 2 zucchini's to come out of my garden. I followed other reviews and doubled the chocolate, lowering the oil.. and adjusted for altitude. These were perfect!!! I made my own frosting, piped it on and added sprinkles.

These cupcakes were awesome.  I followed some of the advise from other reviews and only used 3/4 c oil and added 1 tsp cinnamon.  They were very moist and delicious!!  Will make again and again.

These came out a little heavy, which is probably to be expected.  They were very moist and everyone loved them.  I made 18 large cupcakes and 12 mini.

with the extra chocolate it is great and with half the oil turned into applesauce it was great.  I undercooked a batch (about 16 minutes) and the middle was gooey... bit more like a brownie. I also used half whole wheat flour so they were pretty healthy too!! double bonus! xox

4 stars as original, 5 with changes:  Doubled the chocolate, but only had semi-sweet baking squares and I should have reduced the sugar.  Also, substituted 1/2 applesauce for the oil.  Very tasty.  The batter was very liquid-y, but after 20 minutes, they were done and look great.  Thanks Jen!

Wonderful! I was a little worried about using zucchini in chocolate muffin......but they taste great! I made some changes: doubled the chocolate and added a tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder; didn't put walnuts. Cooking time is perfetct. They are more like muffin, not cupcakes.

Great Cupcakes :) Swapped chocolate for 4 tbsp cocoa powder, used slightly less oil (maybe 2tbsp less than 1c), substituted choc chips for walnuts, and will turn the weights into cups etc. Keeps well too - just glad it makes a lot!! Easy to do all in cake mixer. Highly recommend - am tempted to try a candy cane icing on them. Fed them to colleagues and boys no prob.

With a few modifications, this recipe is amazing. Like others, I doubled the unsweetened chocolate. I also sifted in about 4 TB of unsweetened cocoa and the end result was AMAZING. I also added a tsp of vanilla and a cup of mini chocolate chips. I also just threw in all the zucchini that i had shredded with ended up being more like 2 1/2 cups. I did not have any nuts, but was still great without them. The top of the cupcake gets this slight crunch that melts in your mouth. Was delicious warm with the melty chocolate chips. They also do not rise that much so I filled up cups about 3/4 way full and they looked really nice when baked. It does not really need a frosting. However, as a chocaholic, I would do a thinly spread chocolate ganache on top for special occasions.

This was an easy to follow recipe that yielded yummy, moist and flavorful cupcakes.  I'm not sure how much chocolate I used since I had a big block of it but I think it was more than 2 oz. I also did not use any frosting and it was still very good.

I made this for a kindergarden treat. No one suspected the zucchini. I used 3 oz of chocolate and substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil. I topped them with sifter powdered sugar. A great treat for kids and adults.

I loved these cupcakes! The rest of my family does too! Like other people, I added 1 tsp vanilla. Will definitly be making these again to help use up all the zucchini I get! These cupcakes definitly need the icing... my mom and I tried them before I put on the icing to see if they really needed it... which they did.

okay, for the record i love zuccini, and i love chocolate! if u have kids this is such a great way for them to be snuck veggies, heck, toss some carrot into the mix as well :D lol ... the zuc makes it sooo moist and delicious. ive loved this kind of cake/cupcake since like for ever. i didnt put walnuts as the texture bothers me, so i put in almonds, and it was just as well. i made 1/2 for a girl who doesnt like chocolate and added the extra chocolate to the second cake pan. great decision! lol

i had to steal a slice. i wasnt sposed to have ne until wednesday lol, but thats alright. mmm

I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed with the recipe. As I was putting it together I realized that there wasn't much chocolate in the recipe so I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour for cocoa and added chocolate chips and even then it wasn't enough for my tastes. I am rating it 3 because it is a good cake, but when I make a chocolate cake (zucchini or otherwise), I want it to be chocolatey.

I made this without the frosting, but with icing sugar sifted on before and after baking, with a pecan half on top. 

The zucchini is not that noticeable. It might be a good way to sneak some veggies into kids, but really mostly tastes like chocolate cupcakes.

I used the same revisions that others mentioned (applesauce, cinnamon, etc) and these cupcakes were a big hit, even with my husband who normally loathes even the hint of zucchini.  Very moist and flavourful. Baked perfectly for me at 20 minutes.

Wow!!  These were great with the revisions made by reviewer Henry Smith.  You would never guess these have zucchini in them. Nice and chocolatey. I frosted mine, with milk chocolate icing and these put me in chocolate heaven.  These were a different way of using up zucchini and better than other chocolate/zucchini cakes l have tried.  Thanks for posting this one.

A great cake!!  The texture was excellent-not to heavy.  My family is not that fond of frosting.  So, I used whipped topping garnished with chocolate shavings.

Tasty and easy.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and also frosted them with melted chocolate.  A great treat - especially if you've got guests who can't have dairy.

Very good. Mine came out moist with a sponge cake texture. I did follow other reviewers by substituting apple sauce for most of the oil. I also used coconut oil in place of vegetable oil. I only had cocoa powder on hand so I did add a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil so that it would not be too dry. I did add semi sweet chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. So glad I did. I'my not frosting them since I want to keep them on the healthier side and they really don't need the extra flavor anyway. Mahalo for the great recipe!!

Huge hit at the birthday party!!  I doubled up on the chocolate squares, used Egg Beaters instead of whole eggs, used whole wheat flour (sifted), substituted 1/2 cup oil for a 1/2 cup of applesauce, added chia seeds for additional nutrition, sprinkled with powdered sugar, fresh strawberries, and served with strawberry frozen Greek yogurt. YUMMY!!!

Yummy with these changes for a Gluten Free recipe. I Pureed 1c of the zukes. Replaced sugars with 1c coconut sugar. Flours: 1/4 c. white rice, 1/4 c brown rice, 1/4c almond meal & 1/4c sweet-white sorghum. 
1 tsp. xanthum gum, 8 tbsp. of cacao powder; mayan super-food, 1/2c applesauce & 1/2c cocount oil + 4 tbsp of pureed avacado. GF vanilla extract powder, 1 tbsp of cinnamon, 1/2c waltnuts, 1/2c GF chocolate chips. 3 large organic eggs, 1/4 tsp of salt. Omitted baking powder. I used organic eggs, and the baking soda, but not the baking powder. Rate this a GF 5 *. Moist, cake-like and "chocolatey".  Will add coconut next time.

Very tasty, but more like a muffin than a cupcake.  I doubled the chocolate -- and would add some cocoa powder next time.  Added 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup of applesauce.  Skipped the nuts, although they would be good if included.  I would also grate the zucchini into smaller pieces next time... especially if I try to pass these off as cupcakes.

These are very good and moist even though I used 1/2cup applesauce for half of the oil.I also replaced the nuts with some mini choc. chips and toffee bits.They don't even need frostening this way.

These cupcakes are AWESOME!  Celebrating a friend's birthday this weekend so I was looking for something extra chocolate-y and decadent.  I read every review on this recipe and decided to make a few minor alterations:
 Instead of 1 C oil, I use 1/2C oil and 1/2C melted unsalted butter.
Instead of chocolate, I used 1/2C unsweetened cocoa powder (Dutch) and put 1/2C of semi-sweet chocolate chips in.  
Followed the recipe otherwise as directed, and these come out SOOOO moist and chocolate-y and people have NO CLUE that there is zucchini in them (unless you study the muffins as you bite into them, as I did).  
They are delicious without any frosting, but since I made them for a birthday party, I did find a rich chocolate buttercream recipe to frost these with.  
The only thing missing is the shot of insulin we'll need after eating one!!!

The only 2 changes  were:  to add more zucchini (probably about 3 cups in total--I didn't measure), and I used 2 oz powdered baking cocoa instead of squares. Wow, these are just so delicious! Moist, chocolatey, and some veggies thrown in! =)

These are amazing!  Super moist and delicious!  My daughter is allergic to eggs and milk so I substituted the egg with flax seed/water and used her milk.  She doesn't like super sweet foods and she loves these! So happy!  Thanks for sharing! I will be adding this to my favorites! :)  Note that I use the chocolate frosting recipe on here to make these into cupcakes and wowza!  Amazing! I've had people who don't have allergies ask me what is in these because they are shocked at how good they are.  :)

Absolutely delicious. Everyone in my family loved them. The zucchini was a nice aftertaste to the chocolate, but a little more chocolate wouldn't hurt.

I wasn't wild about these cupcakes.  I used ingredients as noted with the the exception of the vegetable oil. I substituted light olive oil which I bake with all the time. I thought the taste was lacking something and I also thought they were dry.

Will definitely make again. I made one change: I added 4 T powdered baker's chocolate instead of the chocolate squares as that's what I had on hand. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly as is and they came out moist and delicious. 

My 11-year-old ate them without frosting. I tried them with homemade butter and cream cheese frosting, but it's really not necessary, as other posters have pointed out, too. Very good recipe!

I thought this was one of the better chocolate zucchini recipes I've tried. As others suggested, I added about a teaspoon of vanilla, and I wanted to add cinnamon, but was all out. Instead of using chocolate squares, i used a heaping 1/3 cup of a special venezuelan hot cocoa powder, which contains cocoa powder and cocoa butter. I omitted the nuts because i wanted my super picky toddler to eat them (she did). Otherwise, i followed the recipe, and will be making them again.

These are really good - moist and chocolately.  I did, however, as others suggested, doubled the chocolate and added chocolate chips, reduced the sugar.  Left the nuts out. They are more like muffins but that's ok.  They don't need frosting then either.  Will make again.

I give this cupcake four stars for texture, nutrition and ease of making. However, I agree with other raters who have mentioned it needs more chocolate. Also, because the recipe uses oil, not butter, as the fat, you need a flavorful icing. The cupcake itself does not have much flavor, beyond sweet. That said, it had wonderful texture, a tender crumb and good "mouth feel." The second time I made it, I added additional chocolate, substituted melted butter for 1/3 of the oil, and added vanilla, a bit of espresso powder and  a bit of cinnamon. Also used whole wheat pastry flour. Frosted with chocolate ganache. Superb!

Wow amazing recipe! Let me try another one JUST to make sure...Yep still amazing! I didn't use walnuts in the mix but I did top some of the frosted ones with chopped walnuts and the others with sprinkles just because I know some were not a fan of walnuts and WOW what a moist and yummy cupcake even the next day! I love baking with zucchini, it's always a treat! I filled my cups half way, left enough room for frosting and this made more than 24, though you wont hear any complaining from my family about the extra cupcakes! :D

I made this recipe as written, with a bit more walnuts. I made a chocolate buttercream icing rather than store-bought chocolate frosting. It was amazing! Next time I will add a dash of cinnamon.

I followed the recipe 100% they did not rise at all and bubbled over the edges. Not sure what happened. I think to much moisture after adding the zucchini

I skipped the walnuts and used cream cheese frosting. AMAZING! I would maybe add mini chocolate chips for a little more chocolate if you choose not to do the chocolate frosting. Even the kids kept coming back for more of them!

Liked it alot! 1st time made cupcakes with zucchini.  Super moist.  Did what a couple of reviews mentioned: 1) substitute 1 cup oil with 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce, 2) reduced sugar to 1 cup since apple sauce is sweetened, 3) added 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. 4) didnt have chocolate squares so substututed 3 tablespoon cocoa plus 1 tablespoon oil per square.My toddler is devouring it and says it good (without frosting).  Only downside is the zucchini gives it a little bit of a green tint.  Definitely will make again, good for freezing.  As many reviews said, this is not the indulgent chocalate-y cupcakes.  But still yummy!

These cupcakes are so yummy. I did make a couple of changes but that's what I love about this site is reading the comments and suggestions. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site.

More muffin-like and not very chocolatey. Very moist though. I also did the 1/2 apple sauce, added some vanilla.

My family really likes these and I will definitely make them again (I did leave out the nuts though for my daughter). I will try them with the extra chocolate & reduced oil next time.

These are awesome! Made them for my son's class pot luck, and then for his school cake walk. Huge hit with all the kids and adults! Definitely a keeper, did not add the nuts though.

Really good!  Doubled chocolate and used 3/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil.  Replaced nuts with chocolate chips.  

Used Creamy Chocolate Frosting  by Tracy Larsen found on this site as well.  

Soooo good!

You cannot taste or notice the zucchini at all.  I made these cupcakes according to the recipe but added one oz extra chocolate as other suggested.  They are fantastic and super moist. I made a whipped chocolate ganache for the frosting. I used a cupcake scoop and the recipe yeiled about 28 cupcakes that were flat on top. I love this recipe!

So these didn't turn out as well as i would have liked.  I made some minor changes...applesause instead of oil, no nuts.  Other changes i would recommend if you want to try these would be a dark chocolat frosting, i used milk chocolet and it just wasn't right.  And triple the amount of chocolet you put in.  I doubled it, and it wasn't enough.  I would also use a semisweet chocolat.  My family liked them, but there were major changes needed to the rescipie.

This is probably one of the moistest chocolate cakes I have ever eaten. Even though there seemed like a lot of sugar was going into the recipe, it wasnt to sugary at all. The only thing I changed was to cut oil by 4 TBS and melted my chocolate in 4 TBS of butter. Also for frosting I used 4 oz of melted chocolate and 16oz of cream cheese that was all and it was so delish. Defenitely will be making this again.

i substituted 2 TB of unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 TB oil for each square of chocolate.  I doubled the chocolate and it still didn't taste as chocolately as I like.  But I will make again next summer if I have an over abundance of zucchini like I did this year.  :)

This is a great adult cake.  I wouldn't make this for a group of kids because the zucchini pieces are very visible when you slice it and they look a little strange.  Overall, the cake is not too sweet and is delicious without frosting.  I made it exactly as written but at the end, I split the batter into two and added 1/2 tsp vanilla to one.  I baked them separately and the one with vanilla had a richer flavor.  My kids enjoyed it but I can see where pickier kids will turn away bc of the zucchini.  You could always leave it out.

These are probably ok as is (hence the 3 stars), but, I figured it needed more chocolate to taste really chocolatey.  I added 6oz melted chocolate and 6tbsp cocoa to the batter.  These were rich and chocolatey!  For the frosting, I made a chocolate ganache (pour 1 cup boiling heavy cream over 8oz chocolate chips. stir til blended.  put in fridge for about 45 min to 1 hour til cool and just firm, whip for 2 min).  These were really good, moist, and had a nice "crumb"!

These are delicious!  Very moist and tasty!  I made a few changes.  I did not beat the eggs and sugar for 10 minutes since I only have a hand mixer and not that much time! It did not seem to make a difference.  Then to the dry ingredients, I added 1/2 cup unsweetened coco powder since I did not have baking chocolate bars.I used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I also skipped the nuts. I had enough left-over to make a small loaf of cake, yet now I wish I had used the batter to top off the cupcakes.  This recipe probably really does only make 24 cupcakes because I found that they do not rise very much, so you can fill almost to the top of muffin pan. I topped the cupcakes with home-made cream cheese frosting and they were perfect!  Brought to a family picnic and they were finished off very quickly. Because of the coco, nobody even realized that there was zucchini in these!  Will make again!

These were fantastic! So moist and flavorful. I did double the chocolate and added about 1/4 cup of dutch processes cocoa (chocoholic here). I only put half the oil in, also. Will definitely make these again.

To simplify my life I used a commercial chocolate cake mix, making it high-altitude (I live in the Rockies).  Since the family is watching its fat intake, I used a prune-based baking substitute in place of the oil, and used the two cups of shredded zucchini in place of the water.  Walnuts were my nut of choice.  The cupcakes turned out wonderfully moist and absolutely delicious.  No-one could believe the "secret ingredient".

Delicious.  I didn't frost them and left out the nuts so I could feed it to my baby.  The kids loved it and couldn't believe they were eating zucchini!
