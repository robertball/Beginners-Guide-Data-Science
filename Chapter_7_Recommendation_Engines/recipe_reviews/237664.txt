I love muffins, and I had some frozen blueberries and cranberries to use up, so I decided to try this today. They are tasty, and we will eat them all, but we thought they were just OK. They had an unusual gummy texture, which I think was from using so much water and the cooked oats. Perhaps it was from using 2 eggs; most muffin recipes I make only use 1. Or maybe I didn't get enough water out of my frozen blueberries. We thought they needed something to give them some oomph, so I made a glaze with lemon juice and powdered sugar, which really went well with it. Be aware that the recipe directions do not mention the eggs; I put them in after I put the smoothie mixture in the bowl. Also, I can understand why the recipe submitter may have called for making more smoothie than needed. I made a double batch, so I doubled all the ingedients except what went in the smoothie. I got just 2 cups of mixture--just what was needed for the double batch. I think the issue is cranberries and blueberries are round and different sizes; how they fit in your measuring cup will vary. I think Cheerios wanted to ensure that exactly 1 c of the mixture was used, becauce you could end up getting more or less than someone else. If I'd had any remaining, I would have just made a smoothie. Thank you for the interesting recipe.

I followed the recipe, with 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 white, and just one egg - I was hoping to avoid the gummy texture that another reviewer mentioned. Unfortunately, it was still there. I think the combo of fruit providing all the moisture and the cooked oatmeal meant that it was inevitable. I like the idea of using the fruit smoothie mixture to add flavor to a muffin because my husband doesn't like if there are pieces of fruit, but it didn't work out like I hoped in this.
