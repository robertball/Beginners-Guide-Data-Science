Really great granola. Good peanut butter flavor, not too sweet, and no processed sugars! It's super fast to make and I could see adding almost any dried fruit, nut/seed, or even some dark chocolate chips into it. I substituted chopped walnuts for the pumpkin seeds, but kept everything else the exact same. Thank you for the recipe!
