This is a mind teaser.  My head says it is a burger, but the taste buds say it is ribs.  This is fantastic, but for me not something I'd eat as often as a regular burger.  This is special & would be a treat. My husband asked if there was liquid smoke in it, nope. He couldn't believe either how much it tasted like good ribs.  I didn't have apple cider so didn't use anything in its place, just left out.  I really don't see what it could've added because they were very moist & you have to put in the freezer for the 30 min to keep them firm.  We didn't know if you'd use ketchup on these or what.  I'd recommend just butter the bun & crisp them up. We did try a little BBQ sauce on a bite or two & it still tasted like a good rib with BBQ sauce then.  I'm still having a hard time getting my head around how teriyaki sauce, apple, red pepper, ginger & soy sauce, onion & bread crumbs come out like they did for the flavor.  Sorry, can't say enough, so good & juicy with lots of flavor.

These are very delicious.  I followed the recipe as written, other than that I cooked it on the George Foreman due to cold, wet weather.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Excellent recipe! I ground the pork myself with my stand mixer attachment and pushed the apples, bell pepper and onion through the grinder with the pork. The chilling of the patties is super important or they will fall apart. The first time I made this recipe, it turned into Asian inspired pork sloppy joes!

What an incredible blend of flavors!!  Adapted, as others, to what I had on hand: omitted bell pepper, applesauce in place of cider, flour in place of bread crumbs.  Added 1 TBSP minced garlic and teaspoon of all spice.  I also substituted an apple chipotle sauce for the teriyaki, as I was anxious to try the chipotle sauce. Just the aroma was tantalizing!  I look forward to grilling these burgers this summer, but this time they baked for 20-25 minutes on a broiler pan in a 400 degree oven, turned at 15 minutes, and broiled on high for an additional 2 mins on each side to brown the burgers slightly.  Topped with slices of apple, additional chipotle sauce, and mozzarella for the last 2 minutes of broiling - though I would've preferred a sharp white cheddar in place of the mozzarella (but we had none on hand).  I'm confident these would've been exceptional exactly as the recipe is written, but they were also easy to adapt to what was on hand, and DELICIOUS and so moist!  (Served with side of chipotle sweet potato fries.)  Thanks, Norm, for the great recipe!

There are only two of us, and two pounds of pork would last us forever, so I proceeded to cut the recipe in half. I used 1 pound of ground pork, half a small Granny Smith apple, and 1/4 of a green bell pepper. We like onion, so I used 1/2 a small red onion. Some of the other reviewers mentioned that it was hard to make the mixture stick together, so I used more bread crumbs and all the liquid the recipe called for. It still wouldn't stick together. I added more bread crumbs, but I still couldn't form the mixture into patties. The only other thing I could think of was to add an egg. I did that, and still couldn't make patties. So I put the mixture in a loaf pan and made a meatloaf out of it! I baked it at 350ยบ for 45 minutes. It was just OK. It won't take the place of my usual meatloaf, and I won't even try to make burgers from this recipe. It didn't have much flavor, but part of the reason for that is that the recipe doesn't call for adding any salt.Even I thought it desperately needed salt, and I don't usually add salt to anything.

Loved this recipe!  Great flavors, easy to follow, moist, and delicious.  The only change I made was I had to use apple juice instead of apple cider since that's what I had on hand.  I served mine with some PF Changs egg rolls and fried rice from the freezer section at the grocery.  The whole family loved it, would definitely recommend!

Great recipe! I had to omit the bell peppers and soy sauce because I didn't have any, but other than that I made no changes. We topped our burgers with chopped cilantro, grated baby carrots, sliced onions and a bit of sriracha sauce to add to the Asian flair. I'll be making this again!

Excellent! We made these for Father's day. I am so glad I found and tried this recipe. The phrase "bursting with flavor" really fits this one. I had yellow and red peppers to use and they really gave the burgers a spark of color. After forming into patties they were very wet so placing in the freezer before grilling is very important to keep them falling apart on the grill. Mine were in the freezer for almost 2 hours before I could get them to the grill. We were very impressed with the final visual outcome of these patties with the colorful specks of peppers contrasting with the dark grill marks. This recipe is definitely one I'd be comfortable serving to guests. I am already looking forward to making these again. Thank you Norm Walker for submitting your wonderful recipe!

This was absolutely delicious, easy and different.  I try to follow the recipe exactly when reviewing it but realized 75% of the way in that I didn't have ground ginger.  I used Chinese Five Spice instead which was excellent!  Will make it again with the ground ginger.

This was a fantastic burger!  I served it with a slaw on top, which went so perfect with the apple in the burger!  Also subbed the bread crumbs for panko, since that's all I had...delicious!!

Made these last week. A very nice change of pace, but I agree with a previous reviewer - needs more teriyaki. The original recipe is pretty mild. I will make these again, but with kicked up teriyaki and more ginger.

I made these as sliders on King's Hawaiian rolls, and the whole family loved them! I used apple juice instead of cider, because that's what I had, and yellow bell pepper instead of red. I topped my burgers with sautรฉed onions and sriracha mayo. Delicious!

Didn't have cider, so used apple juice instead.  I added 1Tbsp fresh ginger instead of powder, and 1tsp garlic.  Pan fried the patties 4-5 minutes per side. Served the moist patties with rice and veggies on the side.  The pork patties were tasty, but not overpowering in any way.  Everyone liked it, even the son who dislikes onions and bell peppers.  Made extras for the freezer too!

I followed it to a tee, aside from using applesauce instead of diced apples. I always make mini burgers, and I chilled it just as long. As soon as I flipped the burgers they broke apart, and what I was able to salvage from the grill, I had to cook on the stove top. They disintegrated and I ended up making Asian pork sloppy joes. The flavor was good, but it seemed like they needed a hard sear in a pan in order for them to have retained shape.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but am going to tonight. I was looking for a ground pork recipe and stumbled upon this.  It looks delicious.  A suggestion for Mrs. J (who is gluten intolerant) - I too am gluten intolerant.  When I have a recipe that requires breadcrumbs, I usually substitute them with either cooked quinoa or Udi's Gluten free Multigrain Bread.  If I use the bread, I just crumble up slices to the amount required in the recipe.  I even used it this year at Christmas to stuff my turkey, and nobody knew the difference.  Hope this helps to make your recipe turn out the way it should when you try it again.  Also, if you are gluten intolerant, you should check the labels on the teriyaki sauce and soya sauce.  Soya sauce definitely has wheat in it.  Anyhow, I'm looking forward to it.  I couldn't submit my comment without giving it a rating, so for now it's 5 stars.

This was a delicious burger. I used Trader Joe's Soyoki and omitted the soy and teriyaki sauce. I didn't have any apple cider so I used red wine vinegar. My husband loved the burgers,  which really surprised me because he doesn't like red peppers. Definitely will make this again.

Great recipe as listed.  Had to sub apple juice for apple cider, worked just fine.  Followed recipe exactly except for that.  No issues with patties and they tasted amazing!  Topped with just additional thinly sliced Fuji apple and some hoisin sauce.  Absolutely spectacular!

THIS was amazing. It tastes like the fillings in pork dumplings. I omitted the apple, but otherwise followed the recipe. I finely chopped the pepper and onion since I was suspicious of the burger holding together with just regular chopped peppers/onions. Instead of buns we ate them with butter lettuce and made wraps.

I was skeptical, but this turned out amazing. I will make this again, and I will chop the Apple, onion, and bell pepper much smaller than a typical โchopโ. I will either mince them or maybe even put them all in the blender or food processor for a few seconds. I wouldnโt omit or change anything as it was really good just the way it was. I did not freeze the burgers for 30 min and they still turned out fine with the 5 min per side grill time.

I made one small addition to this... I added 1 teaspoon of garlic. These were a huge hit with everyone. I ground my own pork with my meat grinder and added the veggies in there too. I topped it off with home made come slaw and served it with rice on the side. In the future I think these would make great sliders as an appetizer.

This recipe is really delicious! Thanks Norm. My pork was pretty moist so I should have compensated with more bread crumbs. Oh well,it turned out great anyway. I served the burgers on whole wheat buns with a topping of spicy cole slaw and Soy Vay teriyaki sauce. So good!

Definitely use ground ginger, i minced and it was little strong.  and MAKE SURE to chill at least 45 min in fridge or it will fall apart.  Also good to chop apple, onion, and pepper as small as possible

I didn't have any apple cider, so I used apple juice. This is one delicious burger!

I am not sure what went wrong here, I followed the recipe (sans apple, we had none) and it was a big sloppy mess. There was no way to form them into burgers. I tried to add a binder, no such luck.

I left out the red/green pepper but otherwise followed the recipe.  My wife and I really enjoyed this and I will fix again.  Half the patties started to break apart when I went to flip them as they were sticking to the grill a little bit.  Next time I will use my bbq griddle to solve the problem.  I poured a little bit of Teriyaki sauce on the burger the second time I fixed these and it added a nice flavor.

Overall great recipe... Had to use less pepper because my husband hates it and wouldn't be able to pick it out... But this recipe is growing on him. Also didn't have teriyaki or ground pork... Just put a flavored tenderloin thru the food processor and continued from there... Easy and I didn't have to get teriyaki so I wouldn't have to throw it away later due to it being in the fridge too long. I am talking years.

I love this recipe as it is. We belong to a local CSA meat share, and get ground pork and ground pork sausage, and this is my go-to preparation. I make up a big batch, freeze the patties in foil packs of two, and have a great ready dinner in minutes! Very flavorful and moist burgers.

Followed it without the apple chunks because I didnt want to eat really chunky burgers. I also finely sliced the onions and peppers so they wouldn't be super chunky. I added a little cayenne pepper + mexican chilli pepper to spice it up and they turned out great. I halved the recipe because it was only for 2 people. Next time I'll certainly make the full amount because we devoured the 4-5 hamburgers it made and still wanted more.

I like this quite a bit! I left out the peppers as I don't like too much chunks in the patties and used applesauce instead of cider as I didn't have it. This is yummy burgers for sure! I will definitely make this again! Thank you for a great recipe!
