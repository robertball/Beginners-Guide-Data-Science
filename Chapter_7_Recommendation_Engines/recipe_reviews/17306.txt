I had leftovers from jmass' leg of lamb and all the other stuff in the pantry so I gave it a try.  Never would have imagined lamb, risotto and artichokes in the same dish would work so well.  I thought the vinegar from the 'chokes would clash, but they melted in your mouth. It's like porridge, except not at all slimy. You can mix the rice and all the liquid in either a rice cooker or pressure cooker and do this without stirring and fussing. Just warm the other ingredients a bit by stirring into the rice the last few minutes, and covering pot.  I have also tried adding green peas, asparagus, or olives to the the mix.  I have used this recipe as a base with different wines, as with other leftover meat or raw defrosted seafood as well and it works.  Whatever you alter, do not skimp on the best olive oil, butter, wine, shallots, and cheese.

This was excellent! I used leftover lamb from jmass's "Roast Leg of Lamb with Rosemary" from this site. I also took another user's advice and used white wine instead of red, for a more visually appealing meal. I added the garlic in with the onions in the beginning instead of waiting until the end. I will be making this again next time there is leftover lamb.

It's funny how much people change the recipes to suit their own personal tastes, but I guess that's what makes this website great is getting other's suggestions.  I don't care for Lamb, so I simply made an artichoke risotto.  I wanted to cut down on the fat, so I used frozen artichokes that I thawed and chopped.  I also used white wine for aesthetics.  This turned out delicious and made a wonderful side dish.

I gave this a four star rating because although the taste was a 5 all around the presentation leaves something to be desired.  The risotto turns purple when you add the wine, the artichokes of course are green, the lamb brown, not to appetizing to look at, but once I got past that and tasted it, it was so delicious that I just determined not to look down

This was a great recipe for leftover lamb roast!  Im not sure why people had so many issues with presentation.  I think they used too much red wine. I used 1/3 cup Merlot and it definitely wasnt purple as described. My big chain grocery store did not carry Arborio rice or any short grain for that matter. So ended up using medium grain.  There is only 2 of us so used 1 cup rice and 3 cups broth. I used hot marinated artichokes for extra flavor and it came out great.  I was worried about under cooking the rice but turned out slightly overcooked by the end. For the med grain next time I would use maybe 2 3/4 cups broth instead.

I loved this recipe.  I made it with leftover leg of lamb.  I did not have Arbiaro rice, but I used regular rice.  It didn't turn out as creamy as regular risotto, but it was still delicious and a definate comfort food.  I will make this again!

Made without the cheese and it was STILL spectacular.  We used Fleur de Sel instead (a really expensive salt) cause we're on a special diet now with no dairy allowed.  This is great, I can't wait to try it with cheese!

SECOND REVIEW:

Okay so I made it again, 1c of red instead of 1/2 cup, needed to add more liquid than called for, and FINALLY got to add cheese :O)  STILL spectcaular, we have fantastic left over lamb (pasture raised organic leg of lamb, OMG amazing).  Honestly the cheese was great but we could have left it out.  Also used both times leeks instead of shallots.  Used red wine, not white, and don't care about the color as soon as it hits your tongue :O)  Pairs wonderfully with a Blanc de Noir sparkling wine.  TRY THIS RECIPE!!!

Great way to use leftover leg of lamb. My only change was to substitute frozen artichokes for the marinated. Wonderful combination of flavors--lamb, wine, cheese, 'chokes. Delicious!

Looking for something to do with leftover lamb.  I found this recipe and being a risotto fan, I had to try. Followed the recipe as written.  I thought the red wine gave it so much flavour and went well with the lamb.  Delicious!! (even if it is a little high in calories)

I saw this recipe and knew I wanted to make it.  When I went to the cabinet I had everything but the Arborio Rice.  So I substituted Qunioa (red).  I thought since someone said the red color from the wine was not appealing the red Qunioa would be normal.
I can't wait to make this with the Arborio Rice because it was to die for with the Qunioa!  Loved the red wine, I don't think I would want to use white wine as some suggested. Great flavor.  My husband loved it and even took the left overs to work today!

This is the second time I've made this. Fantastic!!! I substituted heavy cream for the Asiago cheese (a personal preference) and it was great! The first time I made it I cut every ingredient by half except for the lamb, artichoke, onion and garlic - very flavorful! Easy and yummy!

Wow! This was my first attempt of risotto and it came out absolutely delish! Even the kids liked it! The artichokes really make the meal.  Did use white wine instead of red.

We really enjoyed this dish. I was hesitant about adding the juice from the artichoke jar, but it was fine. A great way to use lamb leftovers.

Using two cups of leftover leg of lamb, I followed this recipe but probably got 8 to 10 helpings.  I switched pans once and it still nearly overflowed the larger 3 quart pan.  Like others we used white wine. I will half the Risotto the next time I make it, to give more onion, meat & artichoke flavor.  Also added some Allspice seasoning which is good with lamb.

Very nice recipe.  I added additional garlic in with the shallots and stirred in fresh parsley at the end.  Used a full-bodied cabernet  as well.

Excellent combination of ingredients.

My husband and I thought this was pretty good. The wine choice is important. We used a dry white wine as suggested. We didn't have any leftover lamb, so I grilled some lamb chops with a mustard-like barbeque sauce. I used artichokes packed in water and drained them before chopping and adding them to the dish.

For the Johnsonsville campaign, I changed out the lamb for their hot Italian sausage. Very nice as a substitute. Alos, when I reached for the Arborio rice, I had none, so I used Japanese sweet/ sticky rice. It was fine as a substitute, but will stick with the real deal next time.

In the picture it looks like a very unappetizing dish, but I had a lot of leftover lamb and the reviews were great. It was wonderful! My guests couldn't stop raving over it. And it did look just like the picture.

We use this recipe for leftover lamb, and it is outstanding.  Had to cook longer than indicated, but well worth the stirring!  I also used Parmesan Reggiano and it was heavenly. And the risotto isn't all that pink....delicious!

This was OK but quite bland so I added some hot english mustard to the pot and that gave it a bit of a kick.  

Any leftovers that you can serve to unexpected guests without being embarrassed and can be put together with cans in the pantry gets my vote.

I just finished serving this dish and was very pleased with the results.  I did add a bit of salt. The reason I rated it a 4 is for the presentation.  This is great for the family but I don't think I would serve it to guests. Everything seems to be the same color.

I left out the artichoke hearts (mostly because my kids saw me cutting them up and started whining) and served it with "Lamb Chops with Balsalmic Reduction" from this site and steamed green beans. It was very pretty, and the balsalmic reduction perfectly suited the risotto as a contrast. Next time I'll do it in a non-stick pan!

My husband, who does NOT cook, made this for me all by himself on Valentine's day... had I not been home to watch him cook, I would ahve thought he had the meal catered! The risotto was AMAZING... all the flavours intertwined well with one another, and, according to my husband, was simple to make! He didn't have any leftover lamb on hand, so he roasted a few chops we happened to have on hand, then deboned it. Loved it!!!

I recently bought a bunch of ground lamb (it was on sale $4/lb at WholeFoods) so I used ground lamb instead of left over, also I used white wine instead of red since it was what we had readily available, added asparagus, corn, and mushrooms and the whole meal turned out fantastic!

Quick and easy to prepare.  Tasted great!  Forgot to add the artichokes but it was still enjoyed by the whole family.  I enjoyed it so much I had the leftover leftovers for breakfast.  I think I'll add mushrooms next time.

Incredible recipe, the only problem I had was that the wine turned the rice pink.
