I cut the recipe down but otherwise followed it as written, adding just a little more lemon to it after tasting it while it was warm.  This offers a unique taste for sure!  I served it alongside some pork tenderloin that we had, and it was a nice accompaniment!  Thanks, Raven!

I honestly have no idea what a chutney is supposed to taste like but I liked the idea of this. It is really good. I used it on a flounder filet to liven it up and it did the trick! I also imagine it would be good on chicken or pork. Or a piece of bread ;-) It has a great flavor and I will be making it again!

Fail, my fault not yours I was suspect of the onion from the start went without my instinct and was disappointed.
