This is really good. The perfect blend of sweet. heat, and acidity. I made it as a dipping sauce for egg and spring rolls and wanted it a little thicker so I let it simmer a bit on the stove. Either way, the taste is great!

It was edible and better than something I would have imagined. I think putting less soy sauce would make it better. It was very salty. I will make it again with measurement adjustments. Cheers and enjoy!

I made this as a sauce for stir fried veggies over rice. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was a little too runny for this meal, so I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce. Then I let it simmer for about 8 extra minutes and the consistency was perfect. As for the taste, I think I’ll use a touch less vinegar next time, but otherwise a hit with the entire family (including the picky toddler!).

Okay, yum. This is such a straightforward and easy recipe with things you usually have in the pantry! Instead of using white vinegar, I substituted apple cider vinegar and I didn’t have any minced garlic on hand so I just used the same amount of garlic powder. I let it simmer for a bit on the stove so it could really meld together but it was super yummy and is definitely my go-to when I make stir fry from now on! Loved it!!

Good recipe.  I used some corn starch to thicken it up at the end. I wish I had let it simmer longer to let the flavors continue to meld together.

I was making a stir fry the other night.  I usually use our store's brand of frozen vegetables which includes a stir fry sause.  I discovered that my husband had purchased a different brand of vegetables that did not include the sauce.  I did not know how to make it but I was really hungry for stir fry so I decided to make my own.  I found your recipe but doubted that it would be the same.  I was right.  It definitely was not the same.  I loved the blend of flavors .  It was so easy to make.  I kept it in my collection.  I will not be needing that sauce packet ever again.However, when I make it again I will try to thicken it a little.  It was a little runny.  Great taste.

I made about half the recipe and it was plenty for an entire meal. I liked it so much, next time I think I’ll make the full recipe and keep the rest in a jar for next time. It tasted a little vinegar-y when I tasted it alone, but once on the stir fry it was excellent!
