Hubby gave this 5 stars.  I couldn't eat it because of the cucumbers but everyone seemed to enjoy it very much.  Thanks!

I also really liked this.  The V8 adds some extra flavor.  I didn't use the canned tomatoes, as the tomatoes I used were fresh from my garden, so I just used more of them.  The avocados were a great addition to gazpacho.  I also used REALLY good quality olive oil; it added a wonderful richness to the flavor.  Best if left to "set" overnight; the cucumbers soften up a bit more.  But super easy, and oh so tasty.  Would serve this as a beginning soup to a nice meal for company anytime.

Very tasty.  I ate twice what I normally would but the calories are so reasonable and the dish so healthy, who cares?

My husband just loved this. It was perfect for a summer day when it's too hot to cook. I will definitely make it again!

I thought this was great!  I used red onion instead of green, and only used red pepper not green.  And I used balsamic vinegar.  Posted the picture on FB and it looked so delicious everyone wanted the recipe.

So good!  Added shrimp as another reviewer recommended and left out the can tomatoes, but added an extra fresh one.  The avocado really made this satisfying.  I'll be making it again.

I enjoyed this soup. I was looking for a different type of soup to take to work now that it is getting warmer. This is not a recipe that my family would eat, so next time I will half it or give half to my mom, since she would really like this as well. This recipe was light and refreshing. I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and add a pinch of  chipotle flakes. Next time I want to add a spring of thyme, basil and I can't wait to use fresh tomatoes. I think adding shrimp, as mentioned in another review would taste great.

This was great for a summer dinner!  I added some cooked shrimp and served it with whole grain rolls.  It was yummy and was extra delicious the next day for lunch.

I love this recipe!  The olive oil certainly adds flavor and texture as well!
