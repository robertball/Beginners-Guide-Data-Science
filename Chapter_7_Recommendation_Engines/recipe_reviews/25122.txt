Wonderful recipe.  I read about the concerns of too much oil.  I added 1/3c of oil and 2/3c apple sauce.  I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon.

I have not tried this recipe yet, but I will say that if your bread/bars are not cooking up right, you really HAVE TO squeeze all the liquid out of the shredded zucchini BEFORE you measure it.  That is imperative!!! Zucchini is a very watery vegetable and that may be the problem.

Very good recipe, although I have to say I would call this Zucchnini Cake due to the texture. To me, bars are more chewy. 

That being said, I have had rave reviews on this recipe. My family loved the first batch, so I made another to take to a picnic and they were a hit there too. I tried adding some spice to the second batch like some users recomended, but it didn't seem to make a big difference in the taste - maybe I didn't add enough. However, I like the taste of the original recipe anyway - I think if you add too much spice it would overwhelm the taste of the batter. 

The frosting was a little too sweet for me, so in the second batch I added the confectioners sugar a little at a time and tasted as I went along - I ended up using far less than what was called for, I'd say about half. The second batch of icing was much less sweet and I thought a perfect topping for the bars.

Bottom line is this is a good recipe to make as is or to tweak to personal preferences. And DEFINITELY squeeze the water out of the shredded zucchini - it made all the difference in the world.

These are easy but I think there is too much oil in the recipe. I made to a T except I added some cinnamon. They taste good but they are too oily. It is extremely important to drain the zucchini. Just put the shredded zucchini in a dish towel and wring out. When you see how much water comes out you will see why it is so important to do this. My bars still took about 15 minutes longer to cook than what the recipe stated. If you make the frosting, make sure you add about 1 cup of the powdered sugar and taste, then keep tasting until it is the taste you prefer. Thank you! 
I had to change my rating on this. I guess I rated it too soon. My family loved these so I changed rating to a 5! They are very moist!

These were great! I added nuts the 2nd time I made them. The frosting was a bit to buttery for my family so I decreased the butter and increased the cream cheese.

This was a great "starter" recipe!  I added nutmeg, cinnamon and some applesauce and it tastes like a great, moist breakfast cake!  The grownups love it can't see why the kids won't too!

Very, very good. I added vanilla to the frosting and also a little more cream cheese because the frosting was a little buttery. Overall a good recipe.

I'm not sure if it's something I did wrong, but these did not come out at all.  I cooked them until the edges burned, and the middle was still completely uncooked.  I did try a little piece off the edge before I dumped it out, and it had a great taste.  The cooking time is just off!

This recipe is really more like cake than cookies.  It definitely needs some spices added.  I made it exactly as written and it has a sweet, but oily taste.  I will try it again.

Fabulous icebox cake! I took the advice of others and used 1/3 c. oil and 2/3 c. applesauce instead of all oil.  I used a 15x10 pan, baked for 30 mins.  and used a favorite cream cheese frosting recipe:  1 c. butter, 1 8oz pkg cream cheese, 1 box powdered sugar and 1 t. vanilla.  Frosts the sheet cake perfectly.  Store it covered in the frig.  Huge hit with everyone!

Made this twice and everyone liked it.  I am somewhat concerned about the veg oil amount.  Frosting is also good.

"Better than Paula Deen's zucchini bread," was my husband's review (and we both love her bread).  I used a sheet pan to make this and it was the right choice.  It took 20-25 minutes to cook, and it was fantastic, plus it makes more bars.  And the more of these, the better because they will be gone fast!

I used 1/3c oil and 2/3c of applesauce (instead of 1c of oil) to make it a little healthier. For more flavor, I also added 1/2t of cinnamon. Also, it takes at least 30 min to bake if you use fresh zucchini.

For the icing, I used 1/4c margarine and 8oz of cream cheese and it tastes best if you let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours before icing the cake. Using the recommended amounts of margarine and cream cheese makes it very sweet and buttery tasting - using more cream cheese than margarine made it more like carrot-cake cream cheese icing.

Excellent. I didn't dry the zucchini or diminish the oil, but I used less sugar for the frosting as other reviewers suggested. I used the wrong grating dish so the zucchini was not really grated but minced. Still the cake was superbe and the zucchini blended well in the batter.

I have never baked zucchini bars before, and this was the best ever! I actually made it twice in one weekend because everyone loved it soo much. The second time i didnt have exactly the amount of zucchini so it was a little dryer then the 1st batch but it was still great. So tip: add more zucchini for really moist bars.

These bars are moist and delicious. I add less butter to the frosting and it still tastes wonderful.

Simple recipe to follow, I omited all the oil as I felt it was too much, I used 3/4 cup of oil rather than the 1 cup.  I also added 1/2 tsp of organic cinnamon. YUM !
Very fluffy like a cake, next time I would pour into my bar pan from pampered chef! I also had to bake 10 minutes longer too.  if it was in a bar pan it would of only taken 20 minutes!  Will make again :)

I was simply looking for creative ways to use up zucchini when I found this wonderful recipe.  I did substitute Egg Beaters for the eggs.  I removed it from the oven as soon as the toothpick came out cleanly.  This was so moist and delicious.  My husband is not a dessert eater, and he liked this.  My daughters, who scoffed at the idea of zucchini in cake, had seconds.  A simple yet delicious dessert.

Great recipe to use up zucchini.  I added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.  It had to bake about 30 minutes, but came out perfect.  It was a hit at my house, thanks for sharing!

Delicious. I didn't have any issues with the oil and I did squeeze all of the water out of the zucchini before I added it. I do agree with the reviewer who said that it is more like cake than bars, but it was still wonderful. I did cut down on the sugar, as I usually do in most baked goods...I used about 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups. Enjoy!!

Really good.
Squeezed the water out of the zucchini, so I think I ended up being a little short on the 2 cups....should have put more in but the rest of my zucchini was still frozen.
Going to try to add some spices maybe next time.
I liked the frosting, but husband thought it was too sweet, add less powdered sugar next time.

I loved these, but I did drain/wring out zucchini and they took an extra 30 minutes to cook.
I added cinnamon and nutmeg and walnuts also.
Delious!

I definitely should have read the reviews before cooking this recipe.  It was good, but the icing was too buttery ( I added a lot more sugar), the middle did not set in 25 min (more like 40) and it did turn out like a cake instead of bars.  My recommendation is to read all the other reviews and apply the changes and then it will turn out perfect.  Love the twist with zucchini - something different from traditional zucchini bread.

If I hadn't totally messed this up, it'd be great--although definitely more cake-like than bar.  I drained the zucchini, but apparently that wasn't enough.  My middle would NOT set up, so I'll definitely squeeze the zucchini next time.  I also took the advice of others and reduced the butter in the icing (to 1/3 c) and powdered sugar to half (1 1/4 c) and increased the cream cheese to 4 oz.  I thought it was great and can see how it would be too buttery and sweet as written.  It was terrific and hopefully I'll get it right next time!

I added 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder to the flour mixture to make this a chocolate version.  I used 1 cup of Splenda and just 1/3 cup sugar with excellent results.  Cut the oil in half -- instead of 1 cup, I used 1/2 C. oil and 2 very ripe bananas.   Threw in some chocolate chips, too.  Nice variation.  Rated this 4 stars, because I think it's too sweet with so much real sugar.

Did not like these at all. I cut them up thinking it was like a bar as the title lists and brought it to work not looking good. I thought I would frost them when I got them there and ended up just throwing it away. Even with the my favorite frosting- I did not like it.

The bars were yummy, but 1/2 the amount of frosting would have been better. Very sweet.

These are awesome but here are the changes I made:
1/3 cup of oil ILO (in lieu of) 1 cup of oil,
1/2 confectioners sugar ILO 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar,
butter ILO margarine,
cane sugar ILO white sugar,
whole wheat flour ILO white flour
6 oz of light cream cheese ILO 3 oz regular cream cheese.
I added cinnamon and nutmeg to taste in batter.
I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts after I poured batter in pan.
Also DO NOT forget to put your shredded zucchini in a clean dish towel and wring it out to get all the moisture out!
I baked it an additional 10 minutes too!

I made this once, and it came out delicious. :)  I did make a few modifications first, though: 1) Added probably about 1/8 tsp of ground cinnamon to the flour mixture. 2) Mixed in probably a little less than 1/4 cup of ground walnuts to the dough before pouring into the pan. 3) Added some chopped walnuts to the top of the cream cheese frosting after spreading onto the cake. 4) Cooked much longer than is specified here. One commenter suggested squeezing the juice out of the zucchini, which strikes me as defeating the purpose of the zucchini in the first place. I just cooked for longer (until a knife inserted about 1 inch off-center came out clean - probably about 10 minutes longer, although I'm not sure), and it came out perfectly.

This recipe has wonderful flavor and the frosting is awesome!  However after 26 minutes the center was still completely uncooked..I believe I ended up cooking it at least 10-12 minutes longer.

I made these exactly as written (which was in error, as I intended to lessen the oil per the advice of some reviewers) and I agreed that they were too oily.  I did wring out the excess liquid in the zucchini and I also had to cook them for about 35 minutes; the middle jiggled like jello at 25 min.  But they taste really yummy!  So my husband and I decided to rate them at 4 stars.

This recipe was very good tasting..but needed a lot of baking time.  I think a bar pan would be better than a 9x13...

Thought this was a good basic recipe.  After reading reviews, I decreased oil to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  I squeezed the water out of the zucchini.  My bars took 35 minutes to cook.  I used my own cream cheese icing recipe with includes vanilla.  Everyone loved them.  I wished they rose a little more.

I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil and it turned out great!  I also baked the recipe in a jellyroll pan (13x18?) to make it more of a bar and less of a cake.  Excellent!

Excellent cake! 
I made it exactly to directions. I did need to bake it for about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated, and I squeezed the water from the zucchini before adding to the batter. Apply the frosting liberally to use it all up.

This was really good, but I would rename it "zucchini cake" 'cause that's really what it was.  Very tasty, but not so much a bar.

I followed the recipe for the bars to the letter and found the result dissapointing.  It had to bake for at least 15 minutes more than what was called for to be done in the center and even then they fell.  I'm thinking maybe I didn't get enough water out of the zucchini? too much oil in the recipe? or a bar pan rather than the 9x13 recommended in the recipe would be the fix for this.  I will probably just explore for another bar recipe...I have enough zucchini to perform quite a few expirements until I find the one that works.

This did not turn out at all! I made 2 batches and both were - black on the outside and under-cooked on the inside. By the time I was done it was 8:00 pm and i was making these for a early morning meeting. I ended up making Pumpkin Bars. I will not make these again.

Not really sure how to rate these. I too had an issue with the cooking time. For one, the recipe needs to say to squueze the water out of the zucchini. It is not something that I use frequently by any means so I never thought of it until I already had mixed everything and went to put the rest away and noticed all the water in the bottom of the bowl :-( This also should be classified as a cake, not bars. Had I known, I would have only made one batch and divided it into 2 9x13's. The cooking time is WAY off. This took more than double the time it says. I had to cover it after 25 minutes because about 2 inches around the edges were done and the entire middle was still batter. It smells amazing and from what I tasted off the foil so far, it has a great taste. I don't think I will be using this recipe again though. Wish I would have read more reviews before I made 2 of them today.

I had trouble with this recipe.  I could not get the center done.  We ate the edges and they were very good.  I just wish that I would have had more success.    I do not think I will make this again.

this has been in oven for 25 minutes as directed and it is so far from done. Set timer for 25 more minutes. In reading the reviews I now see the zucchini should have been squeezed. Wish it had stated that in recipe. I have a feeling this is going to be put in the garbage!

I also cooked it for the time it said, and my middle was also uncooked.  I followed the directions, and as 1 reader suggested, maybe I should have "squeezed" out all the water in the zucchini, Idon't know.  Disappointed though, really was looking forward to trying this :(

Awesome! I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the frosting and used applesauce in place of half the oil. I did have to bake mine for closer to 40 minutes. Great flavor in the bars and the frosting adds just the right touch of sweetness. Yum. Thanks! :)

This should be called Zucchini Cake! It was delicious! I used 1 cup of oil, and it wasn't oily at all. I also added chopped pecans and mini-chocolate chips. I made a different cream cheese icing, with a brick of cream cheese, 1 cup regular sugar and some vanilla.

I couldn't give these five stars because I followed some of the suggestions of other raters. I cut the oil down to 1/3 c and used 2/3 cup applesauce, and I used a different recipe for the cream cheese frosting. They turned out great! I cooked them in 2 9in round pans and brought one over to my parents. My mom reported later that my dad ate over half the pan himself! As we have a seemingly endless supply of zucchini, I will be making these again soon!

Very moist, very easy.  Everyone loves it.  The frosting was too sweet for me the first day but seemed to tone down a lot the following day. Definitely a repeater!

Ok I make these  this time of year and my changes are  2 eggs beaten not 3, and 2 cups of flour not 2 1/4  and i add 3/4 cups of quick oats and 1 cup of either chopped walnuts or chopped pecans  and I sprinkle some nuts on top of the cream cheese icing. I make them in at- 11x14 pan and bake 350 for 20 minutes and perfect every time!

Only use fresh zucchini.  I tried using frozen (semi-thawed) zucchini and drained off as much liquid as I could - but had to double the cooking time which left the edges crispy and the inside still soupy.  I've never had problems using frozen zucchini in breads and muffins, but I guess in one big pan it makes a bigger difference.  I'm glad I saw comments about adding cinnamon and nutmeg, otherwise I think this would have been very sweet, but otherwise flavorless.

These bars are DELICIOUS!!  I substituted applesauce for sugar and they were sooooo moist and tasted sooooo good.  Took some over to my son's family and were eated IMMEDIATELY!  Even the grand kids liked them.  Then a few days later my daughter and granddaughter came over and finished what was left.  I will definitely  be making these often!

Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews first.  Definitely way too much oil.  If I choose to make this recipe again I'll try apple sauce instead

This cake was moist and tasty. I also was concerned about the oil amount, so I substituted 1/2 applesauce for half the oil. I also used 100% whole wheat flour. It turned out great. Such a great way to use zucchini.

Made this tonight with last of my bak8ng ingredients.  "Cake" has now been baking for nearly 45 minutes and is nothing but soup in the middle.  Very disappointed in lack of recipe detailing to press all liquid out of zucchini first.  As I am sure that is the problem.

First of all, these taste AMAZING! I can never let a recipe be the way it is though so I  made a few tweaks. As suggested, I squeezed as much water out of the zucchini as I could. I used a coffee filter (to keep as much of the zucchini together as possible) and did one cup at a time. Worked great! I also replaced the oil with applesauce as well as added a dash of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I didn't have a big 9 x 13 pan, so I used two round ones. I had issues with the cooking time also, but I just realized I put in 2 C apple sauce instead of one, so maybe that was the problem. I cooked for 20 min, reduced heat to 300 deg F for another 10 min, then turned the oven off and left them in 10 minutes more. Turned out perfect. Also, I didn't think the frosting was too buttery at all. I used real butter, instead of margarine. Not sure if that made the difference or not.

Let me start out by saying I don't consider myself a novice cook. Followed the recipe exactly.  Per other review it turned out overcooked on the edges and not done in the middle.  Cooked longer and still not done.  Finally turned the heat down to 320 degrees and cooked longer; seems like it is finally finished.  Haven't tasted it yet.  My guess is the pan size is wrong, per other reviewer, and it needs to go into a jelly roll pan to cook properly.

This recipe left me in a panic.  It wasn't even close to being done in 25 minutes.  It is more like a cake than bars.  It has to cook much longer or be  put in a 15x10 pan.  I was making it for company and thought I was going to have to quick make another one.  It eventually turned out well.  I also added nutmeg and cinnamon.  Will make it with less powdered sugar if I make it again.

This cake is irresistible! I topped it with a vanilla bean buttercream icing and coconut. I also followed the advice of previous bloggers and drained the zucchini and also replaced some of the oil with plain non-fat greek yoghurt for a perfect moist cake.

Recipe called for 3 oz. Cream cheese for the frosting but it actually should should say 8 oz cream cheese and less powdered sugar.  With those changes it was excellent.

Good, but not great.  They were very oily as others have also said, and cinnamon or nutmeg would have given the flavor a boost.  The cream cheese frosting recipe didn't really seem to make enough, and there really needed to be more cream cheese.  It ended up more buttery tasting.  I probably wouldn't make this again.

I have cooked and baked with zucchini numerous times and I have never once had to squeeze the water out. At 25 minutes, this recipe was far from done. It started to get pretty darn brown, but I cooked it for a total of 40 minutes. Still think the middle could have used a little more time to cook, but it will be at least edible. I'll keep searching-this zucchini bar recipe just wasn't the one.

These bars did not bake in the center even though I continued to check them every few minutes.  Finally, the top was so overdone I had to remove the pan, and discard it.

Yummy!! Baked in an Air Bake Pan, so had to increase baking time by 15 minutes or so. Used another Cream Cheese Frosting recipe that used 8 oz. of cream cheese, just because I knew if I only used 3 oz of pk, the rest would go to waste.

Scrumptious! But it's really the frosting that makes it.

I incorporated a few changes that others suggested and the bars were great. I substituted apple sauce for oil and 1 cup of white flour for 1 cup whole wheat flour. I only used 1 cup of sugar but added a tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice. I also added 3/4 C golden raisins. For the frosting I omitted the margarine and used only low fat cream cheese. Definitely makes a cake-like bar but they were delicious.
