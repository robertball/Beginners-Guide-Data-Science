I made this just as written and had to scrape off the topping....all that Hoisin sauce completely overpowered a great meatloaf.  Surely this was a typo that should have read 1/2c catsup & 2T Hoisin..... although I had better luck with 1/4c catsup & 1-2 teaspoons Hoisin....but the meatloaf itself is wonderful.

I really enjoyed this meatloaf. It sort of tasted like a big potsticker. As much as I love hoisin I would have to agree with the other reviewer that the glaze would have been overpowering as written (I adjusted to 1/4 c. ketchup 2 T. hoisin). I also added some chopped cilantro. Would definetely make it again.

This meatloaf tasted horrible! I am Asian, and this definitely does not taste like an Asian dish. If you're looking for a great tasting meatloaf, try the Brown Sugar Meatloaf on this site. It's awesome!

Was a bit disappointed with this one. It was bland for our tastes. I think we'll be sticking with some of our other meatloaf recipes. We enjoyed trying it though, so thanks for sharing!

I found the taste of the meat loaf itself to be mild. Next time I will add some garlic and be sure to chop the onion finer. Baked as 9 mini-loafs with no problems. Used better plain ground pork and did not have to drain fat. I used 1/4 cup soy granules instead of 2 of the 3 slices of bread - worked well.

My husband, who as a rule, doesn't care for ginger, loved this. I adore ginger, but wasn't crazy about the flavor combination! It was easy and unusual, though, and I'll make it again just because my husband enjoyed it so much. Served it with roasted asparagus topped with toasted sesame seeds and jasmine rice.

Excellent recipe.  I used ground turkey to make a bit lighter and instead of celery I used chopped water chestnuts.  Added a great crunch and a bit more Asian flair!!

I LOVED this, but I'm a BIG fan of Hoisin sauce.  My DD and DH thought the sauce was a little heavy, but what do they know?!  Next time the only thing different I will do is cut the celery and onion up a lot finer.  Other than that this is really good and different thanks for sharing.

omg, did i love this!!  the rest of my family ate it with no comment, actually my DD said she didn't like it.  my DH asked where the gravy was even before he ate it...to me gravy is to cover up the flavor of stuff, and boy you do not want to cover up the flavor of this meatloaf....i will make this again, but as meatballs for a party or something.  i used green onions and a garlic/ginger paste instead of just the ginger.  i also took the suggestion of using 1/4 cup ketchup and 2 TB hosin for the glaze.  if you like the taste of pot stickers, you will enjoy this meatloaf!

5 stars all the way! I added 2 jalapenos and toasted the bread slices before I chopped them. Also sliced a few green onions to toss on top when serving. This was fabulous - the  boyfriend and I devoured it! Thanks so much for the recipe ;)

I thought this meat loaf was AWESOME!  I used ground turkey instead of beef/pork, and ginger paste instead of minced ginger.  This was a really good recipe, the only change I will make next time is to get rid of the celery, it was kind of weird tasting.  I highly recommend this and served it with mashed potatoes and creamed corn.

I have made this twice and given to friends who raved.  Awesome with some little changes... I have used both ground chicken/pork and ground turkey/pork combo for a lighter texture.  Definately use fresh bread(not dry crumbs)- I used some home-made sour dough I had on hand. I would follow the changes noted by others on the top sauce.  Reverse the catsup and Hoison amts.  Also add a few pepper flakes. Very delicious.

This was a wonderful variation of meatloaf.  I also added red/yellow peppers as well as a tsp of adobo sauce for some additional spice.  In the final stage of covering, I did the 1/4 c. ketsup as well as the 3 tsp of Hoison.  I added as splash of rice vinegar and a squeeze of lime.   Served with white rice and was great!

I thought this recipe was a 7 out of ten,I added dry mustard (very good!) and little extra ketchup to the topping, two large finely chopped jalapenos and some chopped garlic to the loaf.  It tasted good and was moist but firm and had a great texture if I make it again I will add another jalapeno more garlic and maybe try bread crumbs or oats instead of bread

This was very, very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly except I used all ground beef and bread crumbs instead of broken up slices of bread.  I'd definitely make this again one day!

I love hoisin sauce and meatloaf, so I was very excited to try this recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I flipped the proportions of the ketchup and hoisin, and it still tasted plenty hoisiny.  The meatloaf was very good on top of a pile of white rice.

I love this recipe and tend to double the sauce (to each his own!). I've made it with beef only or a mix of pork and beef - both are great.

This is ok - and that's what my partner said - "It's OK" which means he wouldn't ask for it again so I am going to shelve this one.  I agree with so many of the reviewers re the sauce - it must be a typo.  I also ended up reversing it using 1/4 cup ketchup and 2 Tbsp. of Hoison sauce - the sauce part was very good.

This was pretty good with a few changes.  I used low sodium soy sauce, and used all beef.  I liked the taste of the ginger, may add more next time.

I did change the recipe slightly by using very lean beef, and adding a couple cloves of garlic, a healthy dose of ground white pepper, and a red bell pepper.  My entire family loved it! It was a nice change from most ground beef recipes.

A different twist on an old favorite.  I was a bit low on hoisin sauce so prepared the sauce with just under 1/2 C. ketchup and 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce.  Very good.  Will try more hoisin sauce and less ketchup in sauce next time.  Edited addition - Made again w/2 T teriaki sauce in loaf (i/o hoisen sauce) then substituted BBQ sauce for ketchup with the hoisen sauce on top of loaf.  Fabulous!

This was great! I used two pounds of ground pork and beef to make a bigger one. I also added some soy sauce and more ketchup to the glaze, because I thought the hoisin was a bit too much. I could not believe how delicious this was! I will definately make this again.

I really love this recipe and have been making it for years! I don't eat pork or beef or lamb, so I make this out of pure ground turkey and it is SCRUMPTIOUS! I tend to pair it with egg noodles and some sort of green veggie (like broccolini, broccoli, green beans, or snow peas). Also, because I make a turkey meatloaf, I suggest serving it with a white wine or even a plum wine.   I highly recommend a Chenin Blanc!  Enjoy!

very good recipe.  I used ketjap manis, an Indonesian sauce, rather than Hoisin and tamari instead of soy-sauce because I am gluten free and everyone loved it.

I substituted the celery for green pepper because it wasn't in season in the Netherlands and difficult to find.  I also added a little garlic powder and black pepper.  Everyone is looking forward to the left-overs.

I have made this a couple of different ways now. I used low sodium soy sauce to cut out some of the salt. I used ground turkery instead of beef, which kept down alot of the fat in the bottom of the pan. Everyone that I have shared it with loves it and asks for more. I like the fact that its easy to make. Definatly recommend to anyone...

Excellent! I also took the advice of previous reviewers and adjusted the measurements of the final hoisin sauce and ketchup. My father and I have an ongoing competition for the best meatloaf, which I've never won, but I think I've got him on this one! And I don't think he'll mind! Thanks!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this unique style on meatloaf.  It came out very moist.  I did make the change other reviewers had suggested and changed the ketchup/hoisin sauce measurements and it worked out perfectly.  Cooked in a meat loaf pan.  Will make this one again.

this is the first recipe I have ever made from here that I hated...it smelled good and looked good but the main and overwhelming flavor was SALT.I will not be making this again...but if you do try it-watch the soy and hoisin levels and definately reverse the topping ingred amounts or this will be another waste of  ingredients.

GREAT!  Like another reviewer said:  "good from the usual-type meatloaf.  I've made it 2 times.  Went exactly by recipe the first time, 2nd time I used 'purchased' breadcrumbs and used only 1/2 cup.  This is a "keeper" for us.  Our family all liked it.  Do NOT add salt.  Hoisin is already salty enough.

My husband and I loved this moist meatloaf.  I agree with the suggestion to decrease the amount of hoisin in the sauce.  I am definitely going to try it with chopped cilantro next time, that sounds great!

Omg soooo good..I just made this meatloaf its amazing, though I did make it with a few changes, i used 2lbs beef and 1lb hot ground italian sausage,I used oatmeal instead of bread and made the hoisin sauce myself. I also topped it with m&m meats Thai sweet and spicy sauce instead of what the recipe called for. Omg sooooo good

This is the worst recipe I have tried  from this site.  No one finished and the daughter wouldn't eat it.  I was hoping that it wasn't my fault for such a terrible dinner.  I looked at the recipe again and I followed it to the letter.

Everyone loves this recipe! I get asked for it all the time! 

I don't include the ginger because no one in my house likes ginger, and it still comes out perfect!

It's very quick to make! I also once made it with all beef when I found I had no pork ready to go, and it still came out great as well.

I thought this was an OK meatloaf, not bad but not great. Added about a teaspoon of dry mustard powder to glaze and thought it was very good. Would make again but will keep loking for a great meatloaf.

I didn't have any celery so used a grated carrot and some garlic instead. Also put half the glaze on the bottom of the dish and half on top. The meatloaf was moist and full of flavour. Very nice!

I enjoyed the change and combination of unusual ingredients.  

My husband thought it was so gross that he refused to eat more than 1 piece and would not refrigerate the remaining portions.  We fed it to the neighbor's dog.  Will not be making this one again.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I made this recipe with 1.25 lbs of ground turkey, used only one egg, two slices of bread, added a heaping spoonful of minced garlic, and left the remaining ingredients the same.  This recipe is now my favorite meatloaf.  It had a great refreshing taste, and the hoisin sauce adds the best flavor.

This was great.  However, I did make some minor alterations. Since I did not have any ground pork, I used 2 lbs. of ground chuck.  I used 1/2 cup breadcrumbs instead of the bread slices.  I did not use the celery or the ginger but used garlic powder instead and about a 1/2 cup of chopped bell pepper.  And like other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 2 tablespoons of hoisin sauce for the topping.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was a great recipe.  I made a couple of changes.  I added about 2 cloves of fresh garlic, substituted the celery for celery seed about 1/4 tsp or less, and used more bread crumbs and an extra TB of hoisin sauce.  I also switched around the measurements for the glaze using 1/2 ketchup and 2 TB hoisin sauce.  This was very good!

My husband and children raved about this recipe.  I am no great cook and am just beginning to enjoy it, and this recipe was simple and tasted great.  I used straight Hoisin sauce on the top instead of mixing it with ketchup, but that was just my personal taste.

I made this as appetizer meatballs without the topping, I prepared the meatballs the night before and just popped them in the oven when I needed them. They were good served with  Sweet Chili Thai Sauce which complimented the saltiness of them.

As a meatloaf it would be way too salty in my opinion, the salt actually over powers the ginger and other flavours.

Quick and easy ! The best part is the meatloaf was so tasty and moist, just the way my family loves it. To add an extra touch, after the first bake time, carve off a top layer and add some mozzarella cheese and bake for the last 20 mins.

This was really good, I meant to put minced garlic and fresh cilantro in it but I forgot. Did chop some fresh cilantro and put it on top though, was great. Definitely a mix up with the amounts for the coating sauce.

Like others, I slightly modified the recipe. I added 1 clove of garlic, used cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs, and used 1 lb ground beef, 1/2 lb ground lamb, and 1/2 pound ground pork. I did use the 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and did not find it to be too salty. Even my boyfriend, who is not adventurous when it comes to food, enjoyed this meatloaf.

I made this for my husband who had never tasted meatloaf before, and he thought it tasted great!  I didn't have any ground pork so I used 1.5lbs of ground beef.  I also added diced mushrooms.  I had some trouble draining the fat out of the pan, I couldn't come up with any better method other than tipping the pan carefully one corner at a time. I also switched up the hoisan/ketchup amounts for the top like others had suggested.

This is definately a "keeper" Meatloaf isn't huge in Australia but I am glad I tried it as the whole family loved it! I sort of flatten mine out in a casserole dish so it cooks quicker. Great weekday meal.

My husband and kids thought this was a very good recipe.  I did add an additional 1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs. I made sure that the onion and celery were finely chopped. I also took the other reader's advice and used 1/2 cup ketchup and 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce for the glase on top. It turned out moist and it held together well.

I made this meat loaf, instead of bread crumbs, I used saltine cracker crumbs and all beef. My husband loved it...raved and raved....very moist...also I think it is important to make sure the celery is finely chopped, I used a chopper. It is definately a keeper....I would not hestiate to serve this to company...it is wonderful.

I liked this but found it a little salty for my taste.  Next time I'll try it with just 2 Tblsp soy sauce instead of 3.  I added about 2 cloves of minced garlic and used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground chicken.  I'll be making it again.

Instead of the three slices of bread, I added 2 cups of cooked rice (I had it left over) and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.

This is really quite delicious. I used ground turkey and ground chicken thighs so I had to add a few dry bread crumbs as it was a little wet.

My family really really liked this.. a great "twist" on the same old meatloaf.  Moist, easy to make.  My Mother in law thought I was so clever to serve this version of meatloaf!

I used all beef (2 lbs), homemade dry Italian bread crumbs, and finely chopped celery leaves.  A must to have the celery leaves as they enhance the taste.   I love Hoisin sauce but used equal parts Hoisin and ketchup, 3 T. each.  Next time, I might add an extra T. of Hoisin.  I made 8 mini loaves.

Too sweet - Maybe different brands of Hoisin are sweeter than others, but I didn't use but maybe 3/4 of the called-for amount for the glaze and it was still too sweet.  I also left out the celery, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Since my family refuses to eat meatloaves, but will scarf down meatballs like they're going out of style, I made the recipe as directed, but made meatballs instead that I pan sauteed until they were brown on all sides.  Then I turned down the heat, poured on the remaining basting sauce, and simmered until brown all the way through.  Served them with flatbreads, jasmine rice, and steamed veggies.  HUGE hit!!  I also plan to make these as a twist on your usual cocktail BBQ meatballs.
