This is one of our favorite summer meals. I use my own fajita seasoning, organic black beans and my own homemade salsa. This is also good with avocado. I like to mix the salsa with a tablespoon of sour cream with the salsa to make it stretch a little more and to make it creamy. This is a great way to stretch the little meat you do have on skinny week's before payday. To make it a little more filling, you can also add in cooked mexican rice. This makes a great filling for wraps, too.

Great for a quick and easy meal! I grilled my chicken vs. pan frying and used a homemade fajita seasoning. I used regular corn and left it cold as well as the beans. I also didn't bother adding any additional fajita seasoning. I added some Mexican blend cheese and some thin sliced avocado. I topped it off with a dollup of sour cream and some thin sliced green onion. This was great served with Ranch dressing and tortilla wedges on the side.

This is a very tasty salad and a great change from ordinary Taco Salad. It's also very flexible. I made a couple additions- avocado, cilantro, and mango. Also I found a jalepeno ranch dressing in the produce section at the store and put it on the side. Delicious! Don't forget the tortilla chips!

YUM!!  My husband and son loved this, and asked that I serve it again very soon!  To get maximum flavor for the chicken, I cut the breasts into 1/2-inch strips and "marinated" them in 1/2 of the fajita seasoning in a baggie for about an hour.  I also kept the bean mixture separate, spooning in onto individual salads, so the lettuce wouldn't get soggy if we had leftovers...which we didn't!

Yummy recipe! Since I'm not fond of salsa in salads I left it out, and for the dressing, I substituted a cup of Caesar dressing to which I added 1/4 packet of dry Taco Seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.Garnished with a dollop of sour cream...and Voila! Everyone at my ladies luncheon enjoyed this and wanted the recipe. Thanks Mary!

Absolutely delicious!  The cheese and crushed tortilla chips definately add to the salad nicely.  My husband liked his with ranch dressing too.  This salad does not keep well as leftovers though, so eat it all up when it's fresh!

This salad is quick, easy and delicious!  I've made it several times with chicken and last night with ground beef.  We top with chopped avacado, black olives, shredded cheese and sour cream.  It's definately one of our favorites.

this is so good! Next time I will not even worry about the chicken- it is not necessary and its sometimes nice not to worry about meat (especially when married to a meat and potatoes man). I used a Zesty ranch dressing and made my own tortilla strips (corn tortillas cut and fried in olive oil and then dusted with garlic and onion salt.) Now I have lunch for the rest of the week. (Keep the salad and corn/bean mixture separate and make individual servings)

Instead of rubbing the fajita seasoning on the chicken, I marinated the chicken with the spice and a little water, for about an hour.  It's much easier to cook when it's wet, and made the chicken very flavorful and moist. I also added water to the frying pan during cooking a couple of times.   Great recipe.

used my own epic slow cooker mexican shredded chicken recipe, along with spinach/refried beans/corn/cherry tomatoes/avocado/cheese/sour cream/salsa. Super tasty, similar to taco salad but with greens instead of tortilla chips. Easy to make+very good thank you!

Very good salad.  As a dressing, I used the "Safeway" brand salsa which contains corn and black beans.

This was tasty, and easy to make.  A nice variation on salad, for those summer days.  I diced the chicken in fajita seasoning and fresh garlic, and sprinkled onion powder & a little salt & pepper.  I put this in one bowl.  I put the bean & corn & salsa mix in a separate bowl.  And the salad went in its own bowl.  This way, people could make their own salad the way they wanted.  For the salad---  I added cilantro, a small avocado, used a small red onion (not white onion), and added diced green bell pepper...  they were all welcome flavors to the salad.  I also had plain lowfat yogurt and shredded sharp cheddar cheese available, to "top" the salad with.  I feel the yogurt & cheese also added good flavor to the salad.    I think next time, I may use a little less onion, and just use some frozen corn (I didn't think it needed a full can of corn).  Overall, a very nice dish and I'm sure I'll make it again!

Wow, is this yummy. I grilled the chicken on our George Forman with the fajita seasoning and added some cayenne pepper and garlic pepper to it. Everything worked together so well in this salad. I used a little bit of light Ranch and my DH use a bit of Blue Cheese dressing. My DH told me he would eat it again next week! I didn't combine the meat and corn/beans with the salad so that I could enjoyed the leftovers for lunches at work without it being all soggy. The ingredients work well in a wrap as well. Love it!

TASTY!!!! this has currently become one of my favorite salads to make.  I went by the recipe the first time I made it and it was fabulous.  The second time I used just half of the fajita seasoning to cut down on sodium and lightly drizzled the salad with chipotle ranch and it was still fabulous!!! I highly recommend this salad....also very easy to make!

Chicken Fiesta Salad Haiku: "Colorful salad! Had to change just a few things. Tasty meal, ole!" I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and marinated in the fajita seasoning mixed w/ a little EVOO and lime juice. After cooking the chicken, I didn't see the need to set it aside, so I simply tossed it w/ the beans, corn, salsa and additional seasoning so it was easier to serve. Doing so gave the chicken a bit more flavor, as it had a chance to simmer w/ the salsa/beans. Scooping the fiesta feast over baby spinach w/ red onion, tomatoes, grated cheddar and a handful of finely-chopped cilantro resulted in a vibrant, healthy, filling meal.

This is outstanding.  I added 1/2C sour cream to the bean/corn mix per another suggestion and it really made the dish.  Me, hubby, and my 4 kids ages 15, 14, 11, 10 all LOVED it.

This salad was perfect for the crazy hot weekend we had in PA. I added some pepperjack and cheddar cheese and used ranch dressing for this salad. It was easy and delish. This is a keeper.

Wow this was soooo yummy!!! I made a few changes...I used taco seasoning, just because it is what I had, I used 11 oz sweet corn and put a touch more salsa in to moisten it a bit more. I followed the suggestion of another review and put the salad on the plate, beautiful blue corn chips around the outside of the plate, The bean corn mixture on the center, topped with chicken. I garnished with green olives, avocado slices, tomato slices and shredded cheddar. Oh yes...and a dollop of sour cream. It was really lovely. I had some taco seasoning left over. I will definitely make this again!!!

I was really skeptical about this recipe when I first read it. But I am glad I tried it anyway. My family just gobbled up and it was gone in 10 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, it did not need any other salad dressing like others mentioned. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Delish!!! This is a great way to use up left over corn on the cob from the night before. I sprayed mine with some PAM - seasoned it with Morton's Season Salt - and threw it on the grill for a few and cut it off the cob! I had some left over cilantro so I snipped some into the corn/bean mixture and used up half a lime I had cut.  Super fresh dinner salad!  Thanks for the idea!  Oh and the chicken must be done on the stove top as to not dry it out on the grill. The possibilities are endless with this salad!

Now that's my kind of salad....I cheated slightly and used already cooked and cut into strips Perdue chicken cut-ups....Southwest flavor. I made a huge salad with mixed greens, red peppers,  broccoli,  cukes, red onion and cherry tomatoes.  Topped with the chicken strips,  black beans, frozen/defrosted white corn and sliced avacado! Omg....so good! I made Margarita Dressing from this site. Can't wait to make again....delicious!

This is what I call a cop-out salad. It was very easy to prepare but just wasn't that good. It is confused whether it wants to be a burrito or a salad....

I just had all the "parts" lying out and made it a sort of a build-your-own salad.  It was so easy and delicious!

So easy, healthy and delicious.  I thought I had black beans in the pantry but was wrong so had to use a can of kidney beans instead but it did no harm.  Also, can't get Mexican corn in Osaka so just chopped up red and green bell peppers and lightly sauteed them before adding in the corn, salsa etc.

Just Delicious. I marinted the chicken, which I had chopped up in the fajita mix and lime juice over nite. When I cooked up the chicken, I also sauted the onions.. Dumped everything else in but the lettuce. Took very few minutes to prepare. I added a little Low fat parmesan ranch dressing to the salad. It was wonderful and I cannot wait to try the leftovers.

This is a very nice salad.  Be careful on the type of onion you use as I used a jumbo yellow onion and the taste was very strong.  I'm goig to use green onions or may be a red one the next time.

Yum!  Thank you for sharing!  Used some of the suggestions (letting chix sit for about 1 hr with some fajita/taco seasoning rubbed in, grilled chix, and did not warm black bean/corn/salsa mix).  Did add fresh cilantro and 2 tsp lime juice to bean/corn/salsa mix that made it really flavorful - used frozen corn that I cooked and chilled before adding to the mix.  Also topped salad with spicy ranch dressing as suggested (ranch w/ taco seasoning mixed in).  Just had the left overs for lunch and can't wait to make it again:)  Keeper - thank you!

Even my kids are eating their salads with this recipe!  We did skip the tortilla chip topping and used grated cheddar cheese instead.  We also added ranch dressing and this is a favorite dish around my house.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It’s been so hot here, that entrée salads have been on our menu a number of times in the last few weeks.  I coated my chicken with just a little oil, placed it in a plastic bag with some taco seasoning (not fajita) and shook to evenly coat.  Then Hubs grilled these.  I used half a can of black beans and froze the other half for later (works great), and I used frozen corn instead of the Mexican-style corn.  I didn’t heat up the corn and beans, but just layered my salad ingredients and topped them with the grilled chicken.  I skipped the salsa because I wanted to try a new dressing on this, Dorothy Lynch Style Salad Dressing, also on this site.  Very good and the dressing tasted great with this.  This is one we’ll no doubt repeat.

So happy to find a chicken salad that isn't drowning in mayo or sour cream! Grilled the chicken and then cut into pieces. Added green onion and pepper because I had it. Didn't warm the bean/corn/salsa dressing - just combined and mixed. With the chicken and beans, this makes a very hearty salad!

A real winner!  My husband is a real meat and potato kinda guy and he loves this salad!  I use the Jalapeno Ranch dressing that another reviewer suggested and we can't get enough of this salad.  I grill the chicken also after marinating the chicken for the day in a baggie with the fajita seasoned watered down a bit.

This was a great hot summer day dinner.  I made it as written and dressed it with a cilantro salad dressing that I got at Trader Joe's, and crumbled tortilla chips it added just the right touch.  Next time I think I'll set out some shredded cheese to add for those that want it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I like this recipe and made it as is. The only thing was i made it with homemade fajita seasoning and added a little lite ranch dressing. Next time I will do the salsa, beans, and corn chilled not warm. But that's just me.

Great summer meal! Even the "men folk" were pleased and satisfied which rarely happens with a salad meal at our house. I only made a couple tiny changes that were mostly about my taste really. I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces before coating with the seasoning mixture then stir fried. I didn't have canned corn so I used frozen and it came out great. I did NOT drain the black beans because it made them a bit more saucey.  I used yummy little grape tomatoes instead of big ones only because fresh garden tomatoes aren't in season yet here and I'm very fussy about my tomatoes. I used a hot salsa which would normally be too much for me but mixed in with the beans and corn it had just the right amount of kick. Last but not least I topped with some shredded sharp cheddar. When I make it again--and I surely will- I may add some black olives and maybe crumble on some corn chips. This was DELICIOUS easy and quick-everything I look for! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really yummy and super easy.  My boyfriend BBQ'd the chicken, which made it even easier on my part.  And the "delicious" compliment in the end was nice too!
I did add a little bit more salsa, and chopped up cucumber, and avocado to the greens.

This was great - and super easy.  We had it all together in about twenty minutes.  Threw some cilantro in, like others, and thought it added to the recipe.  Didn't use as much salsa as it called for, but by the time the chicken got mixed with everything else, I didn't think it made a difference.

I make variations of this very often. The bean, corn, and salsa mix can be frozen if you're eating for one and a can of black beans and a can of corn is more than you can eat within a few days.  I usually mash up some avocado with plain yogurt and add a hit of tabasco for a cool little healthy "dressing" or garnish. Yum!

This was sooo yummy! My husband and I both loved it! I made a few changes. I used 2 chicken breast halves cut into strips and used a different fajita recipe from a cookbook. 1 tablespoon lemon juice (because I didn't have lime) 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1/2 tablespoon brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon taco seasoning. Mixed it all together and cooked for a few min. on the skillet. Then removed the chicken, added the beans, corn, salsa, and some more taco seasoning. For the salad I used red onion and added some avocado. I also made a dressing using mayo, vinegar, parsley, dill, salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. Layered the bean mixture on the salad, the chicken on top of that, and you have an absolutely delicious meal!

This recipe is very versatile.  I added green peppers and sauted the onion and peppers with chopped chicken tenderloins to make it more like actual fajitas.  I cooked the salsa/bean/corn mixture in a separate skillet while the chicken and peppers cooked.  You can use any kind of salsa you have on hand, I only had bean and cheese salsa and it was great.  I used one package of fajita seasoning for each skillet.  When everything was done I layered the salad by laying down a bed of tortilla chips, followed by lettuce, topped with chicken/onion/pepper mixtures, topped with corn/bean/salsa mixture, then added cheese and sourcream to top it off.  Tomatoes on the side made for nice presentation, plus baby tomatoes are all I had.  There is a lot going on with this salad but it all work sso beautifully together and tastes amazing.

I didn't care for this.  It needed some sort of dressing to pull it together.  It tasted like what it was - a bunch of different things on the same plate.

This was incredibly easy and delicious! I didn't use any onion but instead used vidalia onion dressing. Also, served it with Jalapeno Bread II. Better than any restaurant salad!

Excellent!!!  I followed others suggestion and served it with tortilla chips and I tried it with Ranch dressing and without.  I loved it both ways!!  The possibilities are endless.....next time I'll try some avocado and cilantro.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!!

I do not think I will make this one again.  I did however really like the Mexican corn flavor. I had never bought Mexican Corn before and I will from now on with my mexican dishes.  It was good but not great!  Good family thing..but not for company.

Yummmm!! It's like it came straight out of a Mexican restaurant! I circled the outside of the plate with tortilla chips, the inside with salad, and then all the rest on top. Even the presentation looked great!

I'll definately make this again! :)

I made this last night but instead of making it a salad. I did the chicken/salsa/corn/bean mixture and put it over rice.  It was yummy! I also used frozen corn instead of canned and didn't do any measuring just threw it all together.  It was very easy and it would have been quicker if I wasn't a one-handed chef :)

I really liked this salad. The only thing that I added was to throw in some celantro into the corn/bean dressing, just because I enjoy the flavor. I will be making again.

The mix of beans, chicken, corn, and salsa was great -- super-tasty and easy to make... although I still haven't decided if I like it over cold lettuce, it's certainly worth making again -- with or without the salad greens.

Great salad. Everyone who tried it loved it. I did add a bit of low fat ranch dressing to make it a little moister.

Excellent recipe. We love it. We add monterey jack cheese and tortilla chips to it. We also dress it with equal parts of ranch dressing and honey barbeque sauce. Great refreshing recipe.

I was skeptical, but the reviews were so great I decided to give it a shot.  It was fun and easy to make and I knew it was a hit when I saw my boyfriend eating the beans and corn straight.  he was so excited when I told him there were chicken and vegatbles too.  Didn't last long!

I cut up a couple of corn tortillas into strips and fried them in oil to lay underneath the salad.  Super Yummy.

This was very good!  I marinated two chicken tenderloins in buttermilk and fajita seasoning all day, then breaded them in Panko and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I mixed together a can of black beans, rinsed and drained, with some home frozen corn and mango habenero salsa and heated slightly.  I layered the salad greens, chopped green onion, the chopped chicken (turned out I had no tomatoes but didn't miss them).  I then topped with the bean/salsa mixture.  I had made the Dorothy Lynch salad dressing (from AR) and drizzled a little of that on top.  This was very good and flavorful and will be made again.  Thanks!

I made this vegetarian by substituting Quorn "chicken tenders" for the chicken. I didn't have taco season mix, so I used cumin, chili powder, and smoked paprika. I left out the corn, and added organic corn chips (I put them in the bottom of our bowls.) I used cilantro and lettuce from the garden, added sliced black olives and topped with gaucamole.... Yummy!! A nice change from our regular bean-based taco salad.

I used pre-cooked chicken (I cook several chicken breasts at the same time in the slow cooker with broth then freeze them in packs of 2) so I just had to heat everything up in one skillet using the liquid from the can of corn.  I added shredded cheese and sour cream on top. Super simple and delicious. Would work well in burritos too.

Very delicious. Used southwest-style corn instead of the mexican-style but other than that stuck to the recipe. This is a great recipe and you have room to add additional items like crumbled tortilla chips, guac, cheese, etc.

We loved this salad.  I made my own taco seasoning and used half for the chicken and mixed the other half w/ ranch dressing.  I used mexi corn, jalapenos, black beans and onion and mixed it with taco sauce (didn't bother to heat it). I added avocado to the salad as well. It looked like a salad that would be served in a restaurant.

This is a really good salad! I didn't think the tomatoes would be necessary with the salsa but they really add extra flavour. This is delish!

This is the first recipe I've rated on here, and boy, does it deserve it! It was restaurant quality and so simple to put together. It has so many possible variations you can do to it, but it is perfect the way it is!

This salad is so FAST to make!  And so incredibly delicious with the bean/corn mixture.  I didn't have salsa, so I just chopped up an extra tomato and threw it in with the bean/corn mix.  Oh, and avocados on top finished it off perfectly!

This is a good main dish salad. My family likes medium salsa mixed with lite sour cream for the dressing. I mix it all in a giant bowl, cheese, crunched tortilla chips, beans,corn, onions, lettuce(usually a few hearts of romaine chopped)and the dressing. Serve immediately so it doesn't get soggy. I add the chicken on top, lastly, mainly because there is a vegan in the house! Supper yummy and fast!!

This was an excellent salad! However, for my preferences the quantities in this recipe were way off. I used 3 chicken breast halves, a little less than 15 oz can beans (maybe 3/4 the can) I didn't use corn since I didn't have it and don't like canned corn (but I didn't miss it at all) and I used almost 1 cup salsa. I threw the chopped onion in along with the beans and salsa and taco seasoning. Then I did everything else according to recipe, and topped it with shredded monterrey jack and a little ranch dressing.

Very tasty. I added a squeeze of lime to the bean and corn mix, just to freshen up the canned products. I also skiped the salsa ( because I forgot--oops) but I did add a little tomatillo taco sauce to some ranch to the top. Will make again! Next time I want to add some cilantro and perhaps some rice? Nice recipe to play with to fit what you like.

I make this salad a lot (and love it!), except I don't add the salsa directly to the salad, I mix it with unsweetened non-fat yogurt for my dressing.  It's a nice healthy salad - if you want to make it quickly, just use the already cooked fajita chicken strips that you can buy at the grocery store.  I like to top mine with some shredded 2% sharp cheddar cheese too.

OMG!  This is DELICIOUS -- even for a salad! lol   I made this EXACTLY per the recipe and it only took me 15minutes or so to fix!  Light enough for a nice, hot-weather Summer lunch or al fresco dinner, but filling enough you won't go away hungry!  Wow!  I'm having left-overs for lunch today (store the corn/black bean relish seperately so that your salad greens don't get soggy). Top with a dollop of sour cream & sprig of fresh cilantro as a garnish.  I'll be making this (with a glass of Sangria) for my "girls" night next month!

I think this is a great, easy to make salad. Not only am I completely satisfied after eating one, I also feel like I've been eating healthier [I like to add lots of croutons, cheese, dressing, etc to my 'healthy' salads but with this nothing extra is needed!]

I liked the concept behind this but made some adjustment.  I only did half the dry seasoning and then added some salsa. I think the salsa helped make the mixture more of a salad dressing

I followed the advice of other reviews and didn't mix everything all together last night so for lunch I put the leftovers in a tortilla and had a yummy wrap. Good recipe, much healthier than my usual taco salad.

I have made this recipe too many times to count. Everyone in my extended family now makes it, too. The picture you have posted does not do it justice. It is extremely fast and simple to make. To save time, you can use packaged salad greens. To save money, cut up heads of romaine lettuce purchased in bulk for not much more than you will pay for the bagged greens. I place the greens on a very large platter and put cherry or grape tomatoes around the perimeter. I always add a sprinke of taco or mexican cheese on the warm corn/bean/salsa topping. Serve with Spicy Ranch dressing on the side. If you want left-overs, only mix together what you will eat for that meal. Save the rest of the components for another meal. This is my daughter's favorite left-over lunch. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I substituted red beans for black beans (because I can't find them in a  can here) and next time I'll use mild salsa (the store only had hot and I was in a hurry... I'll be more patient next time!). Thanks very much!

This was very good.  I did grill the chicken instead and put the onions in with the bean/corn mixture.  We had some left over bean mixture when it was all done so the next day I put that into a tortilla shell with some sour cream, shredded lettuce and mexican cheese for a great meatless taco.

GREAT! I changed this into a quick lunch by using canned white meat chicken and then adding everything but the lettuce together. I would top with cheese and heat up for a different version. When I finally made it how the recipe calls, I was floored! All those months eating what I thought was awesome enough wasn't anything on actually following the recipe!

Very Bad! Too dry. Not enough flavor.
I love Mex and I love salads so I thought I would like this but it was a waste of the ingredients. I couldn't even finish the plate.

Excellent recipe everyone loves.  Instead of rubbing the dry mix on the chicken, I mixed the marinade according to the directions on the package & marinated the chicken for a little bit before making.

This recipe was not good.  I was looking for a good salad on a hot night and this certainly did not fit the bill.  I'm not sure why anyone would want to put the wet bean/corn mixture on this salad.  I found it boring and flavorless.  One good point...the chicken cooked well and tasted good.

This was good - a lot like taco salad, but with chicken instead.  The chicken had great flavor with my homemade fajita mix, but maybe that is just because I life fajitas so much.  I did crush corn chips on top and that was probably my favorite part!

I made this last night - it was very very good.  I even had to alter it, using taco seasoning (instead of fajita seasoning), can corn (instead of mexican style) and
diced can tomatoes w/ green chiles (instead of salsa)and I used light ranch dressing - hey it was a last minute decision so I improvised AND it was still DELICIOUS !

This salad is so easy to prepare.  We make it often.  I usually don't heat the bean mixture, and I don't use the whole packet of fajita seasoning...too salty for me.  It's good as is, but my husband like to add shredded cheddar and Southwest ranch dressing.

Very good and healthy.  The cans of beans and corn were bigger than called for so I added more salsa, probably double.  Even my picky son liked it, all the men suggested a jalepeno pepper to spice things up a little.  Even without the extra spice it was really good.  I also used 3 chicken breasts because they were smallish.

Prepared my chicken breasts a day ahead of time when I was cooking something else so they were very cold when they were put into the salad. My husband thought it would have been better if everything had been cold like the chicken and lettuce. Very easy to prepare and it looked like you went to a lot of trouble when you didn't. Will make again and try the honey BBQ/ranch dressing idea.

I used pinto beans in place of the black beans and added a chopped jalapeno to the mixture.  I topped off the salad with shredded colby and crushed blue corn chips.  This salad is so good it is hard to believe it is low in fat!  My husband's response, "This is quite possibly the best salad I have ever had."

This dish is wonderful!!  I made this to eat for lunches during the work week,and I found myself looking forward to lunch every day so I could eat it. (I did store bean/salsa mixture separately from greens so it wouldn't get soggy.) I was a little short on chicken breasts, so I ate it twice with chicken and twice without. I found it was just as good without the chicken.  It was a bit spicy because I used a little more than half of fajita seasoning in bean mixture (since I was short chicken).  If using more than half of seasoning packet, I would recommend using MILD salsa to help tone it down a bit.  Great recipe!  I highly recommend! Thanks for sharing.

This was really good.  It reminds me of a salad that I order out at a restaurant here, so now when I have a craving, I can make it myself!  Quick and easy.  I grilled the chicken ahead of time.

****** Very good recipe! I marinated the chicken in 1/2 cup water and half the dry marniate then sprinkled some chili powder on the chicken as it cooked, I also added two dashes of hot sauce to the corn/bean dressing mixture. Best if served warm with fat-free cheese and toasted tortilla strips or tortilla chips. Great as leftovers, if you have any left, but don't mix the salad with the dressing and chicken until just before eating and be sure to heat the dressing and chicken in microwave to warm before adding to the salad.

My family really enjoyed Chicken Fiesta Salad. I grilled the chicken breasts, and used a four-cheese blend. I think it would be excellent in a taco shell, as a taco salad, or rolled up in a tortilla, as well. It is a 
good "company dish" as you can make it earlier in the day, then just assemble the bean dressing just before serving. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

One of the best recipes I've tried in a long time, yet so simple!  I did what most others did and added more toppings.  I had some leftover garlic lime chicken that I shredded and mixed with taco seasoning.  I tossed the lettuce, tomato, and onions and put in two bowls.  I topped with red beans and corn (I did not add the other ingredients to the corn mixture).  I added a few more slices of tomato and avacado to the sides.  Then added the chicken, topped with cheese, and some taco shells broken up to the top.  , garnished with cilantro.  It was soooo good.  I served it with a side of sour cream that we did not use, nor did we use dressing.  Will be making this again soon!

Delicious!! I added a couple things and left out a couple of things due to not having what the recipe called for.  I cooked the chicken in a skillet with salt and pepper and taco seasoning and then I used refried beans and mixed that with the corn and salsa and the rest of the taco seasoning and heated it up. I left out the onion and tomato wedges but used tortilla chips and shredded cheese on top and it was very good!

Healthy 1 course meal! Used green onions saw some suggest cilantro lime dressing which I would like to try. Also a little crunch on top is nice!

Yum... And the bean mixture is even good by itself. I might add a dash of lime juice next time, but this a keeper.

We love this! It is a nice, light change of pace from regular taco salad. We didnt even feel cheese and sour cream were necessary, the flavors from the salsa, corn and beans combined were plenty to make everyone happy! I, like other posters mentioned, sliced the chicken into strips and fried them up that way! Delicious!

This is awesome! I marinated chicken tenderloins in lime juice & a chipotle marinade spice & taco seasoning (had no fajita seasonong) for about an hour. I was lazy so I skipped the onion & tomatoes..and added cheese & some crushed tortilla chips & some cilantro.

This was very good. I used spinach and a frozen southwest blend of corn, black beans, onion, peppers, etc., so I left out the onion in the salad. Next time I will use more chicken.

WOW.  Super easy, healthy and yummy!  What else could a girl ask for??  This is very good with or without the chicken!  When I make it with chicken, I marinate it instead of rubbing it with the fajita seasoning, it's just easier to me.  I also drizzle spicy ranch dressing on top.  This has become one of our favorite recipes.  No need to add cheese, it's healthier without it and very, very good.  Thank you so much for submitting it!!

This is healthy and tasty.  I didn't use the fajita rub only because I had marinated chicken leftover which was highly flavorful.  So instead I warmed up the the other half of the fajita mix with the salsa, and 1/2 cup of sour cream, corn, and black beans and added some garlic salt. Then I mixed in the chicken.  Turned out great. Thanks!! Next time i will try the recipe as is just to be fair but I'm sure it's just as good.

I usually make taco salad with vegetarian crumbles, but this is so much better!! Instead of the mexican style corn and the salsa, I used frozen corn and a can of southwest style diced tomatoes. I also sauteed about 1/2 cup chopped onion before throwing everything else into the pan. Cooked the chicken on the grilled, cut it into cubes, and mixed it right in with everything else. I loved this meal - feels like you're being bad, but it's actually healthy!

This was excellent!!!  Something different and easy.  I did add some pepper jack cheese to put on top.  I think it may be better if it's grilled rather then on the stove.  Will definitely make again!

This had fantastic flavor and was a nice change from our normal beef taco salad with taco seasoning. I thought the bean & corn salsa tasted a lot like Qdoba's salsa. The only change I made was adding 1 Tbsp. of light ranch dressing for extra creaminess, but a little light sour cream would work, too. We're adding this to our weeknight dinner rotation!

This is excellent and not too fattening.  I accidently opened a can of kidney beans instead of black beans so I tossed them in too and it turned out great.  I added the whole packet of seasoning to the bean mixture since I was using leftover chicken.

This salad was great! Made it last night for dinner and my husband and I both loved it. We don't cook any meat in our home so I easily substituted Quorn Chik'N Tenders (pre-cut Chik'N Breast) for the chicken and ended up heating up the beans, corn, and salsa all together with the chicken. Left out the tomato and onion because I was looking for a quick, no prep dish and it was delicious! Threw a little shredded cheese on at the end.

This was very good.  I used green onion instead of regular onion and added fresh cilantro.  I also cut the chicken breast in strips, then dredged it in the seasoning before frying it in the skillet. Instead of using another pot for the corn, beans and salsa, I used the skillet since it was already seasoned from the chicken.  All in all, a good meal.  I look forward to leftovers tomorrow.

This was excellent.  I received tortilla shell baker for Christmas, so I baked some flour tortillas and put the ingredients inside.  Yum.  My family topped theirs with some guacamole, ranch dressing and grated cheese.  I just used chunky salsa.  Will definitely make again!

I'm giving this a four because it just seemed to lack a little something.  It was good...but we had to add sour cream, or dressing...and that wasn't quite it either.  Maybe it needed a little kick of heat?  Overall..pretty easy and good.

I made this tonight...and with a few additions, was fantastic!  I cut my shicken up in strips and then seasoned with the fajita mix.  I also added fresh cilantro to the bean/corn mix, the chicken while it was cooking and also topped the salad with it.  I also added fresh avacado and a squirt of lime juice.  Like other users, I also added some (low fat) Ranch dressing.  This was so super tastey and my BF and I both were suprised at how filling this is!

This was an awesome recipe!  I added cilantro left out the chicken and doubled the fajita seasoning on the corn and bean mixture.  We also added sour cream and  avocado for those who didn't mind the extra calories.  A big hit!

This recipe was great! I didn't change a thing and it was perfect. I think next time I make I will cut the chicken into strips and cook them. This is a nice change to the everyday salad and it's easy to make! You won't be disappointed with this choice!

Wow Mary!!!! I made my own fajita seasoning mix so that I could control the salt, added red onion, scallions and avacado. Fantastic salad!

I made this quite a few times its great. Since homegrown tomatoes season is not here I would suggest canned diced tomatoes, For a more tomato flavor.

Loved it!  I wasn't sure since I don't like black beans but this way surpassed my expectations.  This is hearty enough for a meal for sure!
I couldn't find mexi-style corn so I used normal corn and it was fine.  The flavor of the salsa I used was enough to make up for it.  I used green onions and I probably used a cup of salsa instead of 1/2 cup.  I also added shredded cheese and broken up tortilla chips.  We devoured it!

This recipe is awesome and so easy.  This is my quick get together lunch when I have unexpected company.  The recipe is great as is.  I use cajun seasoning that I have on hand instead of buying fajita packets, and I use red onion.  Very yummy!!

This salad was wonderful!  I pan-fried the chicken in a bit of oil and it came out so juicy and flavorful.  The corn/bean dressing was excellent.  It makes a great chip dip as well!  My husband and I LOVED this recipe and will definitely make it again...soon!  I think that I will slice some avocados to go on top of the salad next time.

This was really good! I too added some extra goodies in the salad. You can really make it any way you want and it ends up great. Careful not to make it to spicy by adding to much fajita mix!

The major plus of this meal is that it's quick and delicious.  At prep time i found that I only had half a pouch of fajita seasoning remaining...which actually turned out to be just enough for the chicken and veggies.  The "foreman" type grill that we have has been a lifesaver for this hubby who is helping out his wife.  The chicken cook time just slightly longer than the veggies. Start the veggies a few minutes after and you'll have a meal that assembles quickly.

For salsa I used diced veggies, specifically Salsa Fresca.  We found that the salsa/veggie combo gave ample flavor enabling us to omit any additional dressing.

From start to finish the meal took us about 20 minutes max...happy cooking all.  This one is in my permanent book.

My husband and I loved this dish.  It was so easy to make and is a healthy meal in itself.  I used Chef Paul Prudhomme's Fajita Magic seasoning instead of a packet of seasoning.  I just sprinkled it on my chicken and grilled the chicken on my little indoor grill.  I served the meal in a big pasta serving bowl.  I surrounded the whole salad with tortilla chips.  My husband and I agree that this definitely needs the chips.  It adds a great texture to the salad.  I would highly recommend this as an easy and tasty meal.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making it again for sure!

This salad was delicious!  I made a few minor changes though.  Instead of the salsa, I used a can of petite cut tomatoes with jalapeno peppers.  I also kept the hot mixture separate from the salad so I could save it.  I just added it to each portion.  I took a previous posters advice and used ranch dressing.  It was perfect!  Will definitely make again!!

Superb!! This definitely ranks on my list of 10 best salads ever! I have small children and they loved it too.  I doubled the recipe and used the Fajita packet to cook the chicken in and used a taco seasoning packet in the dressing.

This was delicious!! My two-year-old loved the chicken and he is a very fussy eater-he even ate some of the beans and corn as well. My husband and I defintely decided this was a keeper - especially with Ranch dressing - It was fantastic.

What a great, easy, quick meal this is.  My husband and I both love it.  It's healthy but very filling, and just delicious.  I use the grilled chicken strips you can buy already cooked to make it even easier.  Great recipe!

I used frozen corn and added 2 tablespoons of water.  Also, sour cream is a nice garnish.  Very tasty.

My dad loves Mexican food and salads, too.  I fixed this for his birthday dinner, and it was a big hit!!!  We added salad dressing and thought it made it even better.  Later on, my husband ate the leftovers wrapped up in a tortilla, and we thought it was even better that way!!

Really tasty Mexican salad.  Be sure to add tostada chips for extra interest and texture.

I really liked this recipe. It will soon become a staple in my house. I added some cheese because everything is better with cheese :-). My grocery store was out of mexican corn so I substituted a can of corn and jalapeno.

My husband I eat this on a daily basis. It's really simple to make and great for leftovers! I usually make it the bean/corn/salsa mixture and cook the chicken on the weekends and then we just reheat and throw it on the top of a salad for the whole week.

If you plan to keep it this way, you can make your chicken even more flavorful by storing it with the beans and corn mixture.

A little bit of spicy ranch on top of the salad really does the trick!

FINALLY found a way to get my husband to eat salad. This salad was so good, I did not see "mexican corn" so i just used a can of white corn instead. I skipped the salsa and added cilantro to the recipe. I also used ranch dressing on it which gives it an extra kick.

Yummo!!!! I took one persons idea, cutting the chicken breast into strips and marinated it in 1/2 the fajita seasoning and about 1 tablespoon olive oil.  As the chicken cooked, I doused it with a little lime juice.  To the salad, I added cilantro and chopped green bell pepper.  I used thinly sliced purple onion. Everything else stayed the same.  I served  it with cheese quesadillas.  To make these, I spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one side of a tortilla put the tortilla in a non-stick frying pan - mayo side down, spread tortilla with shredded cheese, and cover with another tortilla with mayo spread on the outside.  I toasted on both sides and cut into slices.

The flavors were a good combo, but it was a mess to eat. I cut the breast into tenders and marinated them in olive oil and spices.

This recipe makes for a great, easy weeknight meal.  I served over arugula, and the heat of the cooked chicken warmed the greens which I personally really enjoyed.  I'll be making this again in the near future for sure!

Quick and delicious salad.  We used regular canned corn, and iceberg lettuce because that is what we had at home.  I made my own fajita seasoning instead of using a packaged one, and added avocado to the salad.  YUM!  We can't wait to have this again.

This recipe is AWESOME for the summer months. I wanted a recipe of a salad other than your regular salad with "X" dressing. I followed the recipe and I added sour cream and avocado at the end. I loved the spicy flavor with the beans, corn and chicken. My husband loved it too. This is a keeper for sure. Thanks for sharing it!

I followed the instructions to a T except I used the grill instead of a skillet to cook the chicken.  I cut back on the seasoning because I'm a complete wimp in terms of spicy foods.  This salad was delicious.  Our only complaint was it seemed to lack a coating/dressing.  Perhaps there's a good sauce/reduction/dressing that would compliment & add that moist/creamy texture we were missing.  Even a tiny side bowl (side! I emphasize) of ranch would do the trick.

Pretty decent quick salad.

I messed up on the chicken and ended up burning it while cooking with vegetable oil, so I grilled it instead.

It's delicious fresh, so I would suggest that people eat this either as a one and done dish or just save the chicken and the sauce aside so you can have hot chicken and sauce on top of a cold salad, as that combination makes this dish good.

Excellent! I just added some fresh cilantro, shredded cheddar cheese, and some tortilla strips. (I like Sante Fe style and you can find those in the crouton isle at the grocery store.) A little taco seasoning in ranch dressing tops it off just beautifully. I love how you blended the beans with the corn and salsa over the stove. Thanks for the recipe and I am craving it again already!

My mouth was dancing it loved this so much.  It was really easy but really tasty.  My husband couldn't believe it tasted so good and was also not that high in calorie.  The main thing I did different was I only used 3/4 of the fajita flavoring packet instead of the whole thing, and I cooked the chicken in Italian dressing w/ the seasoning instead of just oil and the seasoning.

This was a super easy meal to make and it was delicious.  I added green chili to it as well as hot instead of medium salsa. I would serve it again and add jalapenos.  I served it with a dollop of light sour cream and some shredded Mexican blend cheese.  I recommend it for a night when you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen but want a filling and flavorful meal.

Yum, this was a hit, and so quick to throw together. I added some shredded cheese and avocado slices on top. For the seasoning, I have been using bulk taco seasoning by Club House for years in fajitas and it worked well. Also I substituted red kidney beans for the black beans because I had them on hand and it was excellent.

This was a great salad; I am so happy I made it!  It is very simple to do and was very flavorful while still using healthy ingredients.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and omitted the onions and tomatoes.  We did sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top and made it even more tasty

I followed the recipe exactly. I ended up feeling that this was just ok. My kids liked the corn and black bean mixture. I didn't feel the fajita seasoning added much flavor.

We all were impressed with this summer salad!  If I hadn't taken someone else's suggestion, tho, to use Dorothy Lynch style salad dressing from this site, I don't think it would have been so delicious!  I would definitely make this again!

This is a very tasty, easy to make meal with a really good combo of flavors! It tastes better than it looks from the pictures! We added sliced tomatoes and put shredded cheese on top. We doubled the recipe and used more fajita mix than called for--definitely worth it!

Made exactly as written only no chopped onion. Topped with sour cream. It was good, but not the greatest thing ever. Healthier than from a restaurant, so might make again. Will probably use taco seasoning instead of fajita next time.

This salad was just so-so. It wasn't spicy enough for my tastes, and it was definitely too dry. It needs some sort of dressing. On the positive side, it does look very colorful and appetizing, and was easy to prepare. I think it's just missing something.

This meal is delicious, simple and relatively healthy! I did make a few changes, though. 

I cooked the chicken with chopped onions and green peppers as well as a little bit of minced garlic. I also added the chicken to the corn/bean mixture as well as 1/2 tsp of chili powder and a tbl of lime juice. Finally, I topped the salad with tortilla strips, cheese with a dollop of sour cream on the wide. Wow! Sooo good!

This was a very yummy salad :) I also added mixed cheese, and a green bell pepper. MMMM. :) My only suggestion would be to let the chicken marinate in the spices for an hour or two, and cut into into strips before cooking. Thanks Angl!

A variation of taco salad. Very tasty and pretty healthy, too(as long as you don't load it up with cheese, dressing and chips!). I will make this again many times.

Easy and quick to make, and tasted really good too! My boyfriend, who normally prefers fried foods, even went back for seconds. I also cut the chicken into strips after cooking it. A perfect summer meal.

I'm new to All Recipes and this was my first recipe to try.  Boy was it ever a winner!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference was that I chose to use Southwest Peach Salsa instead of regular salsa since my family doesn't like extremely spicy foods.  The slight hint of sweet with the fajita spice was absolutely delicious!  My hubby crunched some ranch flavored chips up on his as well as adding some shredded cheesed.  We all loved it!

Awesome salad, this is definitely a family favorite. ! I added a few drops of lime juice to the bean mixture, which turned out fantastic. I also served it with Tortilla chips and jalapeno ranch dressing.   ~enjoy!

This turned out very good.  I used 1 chicken breast that I poached instead of frying it and used some tofu as well.  My boyfriend didn't even notice the tofu haha! I also added a little bit of cilantro for garnish and some corn chips.  Delicious and fast and easy!  I will definitely make this again.

Simply delicious! I already had to hand out the recipe the next day after friends tasted the leftovers I took to work. You can play with the salsa amount in the beans to your liking.

I loved this salad! The corn and bean topping makes this salad special and very filling. Also put a small amount of ranch on top to make it more like a salad.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it came out GREAT! My husband said, "you better keep this recipe!"  I recommend not making the salad as one big salad, but make it per person by bowl or plate.  I am going to use the leftover bean mixture as a salsa dip!

This was sooooooooo good. I ommitted the onion and added some shredded Mexican cheese blend. I topped with tortilla strips and spicy chipotle ranch salad dressing. My husband doesn't like chicken so I made his with ground beef and seasoned with a packet of taco seasoning. I ate the chicken. I bought raw chicken tenders and they cooked in a couple of minutes. This is a tad spicy but not too bad. Will make again - soon!

Easy and excellent!  The salad is perfect without these additions, but I added a couple of my favorites - fresh cilantro to the bean & corn mixture and avocado.  My family and I really enjoyed this salad.  Thank you for the recipe!

I agree, this salad was "feisty". Have been doing low cholesterol recipes recently and have found they all seen to lack flavor. This one did not lack. It was great! Made no real changes to the recipe. Highly recommended! Made it again Oct 09' and it made it to 5*!!! Only change was to add crumbled Doritos on top! What a GREAT salad!!!

We did not use the onion or tomatoes so the kids would eat this salad.  It was SO good.  A lot of differant tastes in all.  I make homeade salsa so it was better than it would have been with a jar.  If you used jared, I would add some cilantro.  I did not use the ranch due to the extra calories & it didn't need any extra moisture.  The moisture from the bean mixture is plenty.  We put a little bit of shredded cheese & a few crushed tortilla chips.  YUM!  We will definately make again!

This time I cooked my chicken in the crockpot with some left-over juices and the packet of fajita seasoning. I love this recipe, it is so easy a husband can make it on a buy school night.  I make it all summer long.  I use green onion because my oldest son is alergic to white.  I am also going to add cilantro to my salad mix this time.  I am going to add some diced avocado and jalapeno on the side.

This is my new favorite salad!  The only thing I changed is I used regular corn, added some shredded cheddar and didn't put in the onions.  I sent this recipe to my mom and she and my dad loved it, too!  It made about twice the beans and corn that my husband and I could eat, so I froze the extra and made the salad again the following week with more chicken etc.  My husband, who hates salads, actually liked this recipe, too!

This was a fast, easy and delicous side dish. It went fast at our table, with no left overs. I used taco seasoning instead of fajita, because that's what I had on hand. It worked great.

Great easy recipe.  I keep the bean/corn mixture separate since my husband doesn't like beans and add to my salad.  Great with either ranch dressing or just extra salsa.

Needs a sauce or dressing like chipotle. Marinating chicken before hand would be great. 
It took longer to cook on the stove top than the recipe called for.
I used the same amount of corn as beans.

It thought this was delicious! I added a little more salsa than called for but I love tomatoes. I loved that I didn’t have to use dressing because it replaces the need. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is incredible! While making it, I thought "this is not going to be good--it's too simple!" I'm so glad I was wrong. The corn/salsa/chicken mix flavor perfectly complements the salad greens. 

We barbecued the chicken first, but otherwise made this as written. This one's going to become a regular for us! We loved it!

This was pretty good, I squeezed some lime juice on top for some extra flavor. Next time I might try adding a little sour cream and avocado.

Delicious!  Easy to throw together and very tasty.  This is a great weeknight meal and good way to use up extra chicken- I used leftover chicken that we had grilled over the weekend.  This is delicious as written with warm toppings but I liked the leftovers with cold toppings as it was very refreshing.  This would be wonderful with avocado or any other Mexican toppings, even a sprinkling of Spanish rice!

This was excellent, although I went to 3 supermarkets and couldn't find Mexican corn, I just used frozen. Also used sliced Baked Split Chicken Breast (recipe here). Will make again for sure!

This was pretty delicious.  I went by the recipe and it made a nice lunch.  I did mix up a combo of ranch mix, sour cream, and fresh cilantro to top it with.  I also used green onions.  I think this would be great in a tortilla bowl.  Next time I won't heat up the salsa, bean, and corn mixture, and will omit the extra fajita seasoning.  I think the salsa mixture would taste better left cold/room temp, when topping over the salad greens.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect summer salad.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used fresh corn instead of canned, and added avocado, a few tortilla chip crumbles, and a good squeeze of lime.  Really easy and filling.

We really enjoyed this, I was actually surprised the my fiance went for seconds. The only change I made was to add red pepper halfway through the heating of the bean and corn mixture. Next time I will added shredded tortilla chips for crunch.

Absolutely delicious. I cut the two breast halves in half, chopped up my own fresh salad greens, and used grape tomatoes in lieu of cutting a tomato into wedges. It made four large portions.

This is just a glorified taco salad. I think it would be better just using taco seasoning instead of fajita, our preference. Also no need to make preparing in 2 pans. For presentation layering is nice, but again not necessary.

Really salty. After making it, I reread the positive reviews and nearly everyone made their own fajita seasoning. Maybe that would be helpful. Also hot food on salad made everything wilt. Won't make again

This was a big hit at our house.  I wanted to use up some chicken that was already cooked, so I skipped the first step and just diced the chicken and tossed it with the fajita seasoning, then warmed it up in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.  Next time I will add some shredded cheese and chopped avocado.  Yum!

We liked this very much. It was one of those nights when everyone was eating  at a different time and this worked perfectly. Made the fajita seasoning from this site. There was more than enough for our  4 so I didn't add the corn, but I will do that next time.

How could anyone not like this salad ?  You don't have to follow to a "t" just add or leave out what you like or dislike.  We top with crushed tortilla chips and cheese,  also avocado if there is a ripe one on hand.  You can mix ranch dressing with salsa to pour over the top.  Very versatile recipe, thank you for sharing.

My husband and I loved it. I must admit I used what I had in my kitchen so it is a little different  but a wonderful filling salad that  we eat as a main meal. I always have a large container of taco seasoning so I used that instead of the fajita seasoning and I just used a regular can of corn vs mexican corn and romain lettuce vs a bag of mixed greens. I did topped the salad with some crushed Doritos because we like a little crunch in our salads and I had a some Wishbone Chipotle Ranch dressing that I also added. It was wonderful!

I followed the recipe as written. While it is tasty dish the chicken could use more fajita seasoning. An excellent dinner main course.

Really great salad, and I typically don't like salads.  I added a bit of frank's hot sauce to the salsa, which helped make it a bit spicier.  In the future, I might only top the salsa on the salad I'm going to eat, instead of the entire dish.  The salad gets a little wilty if it's all mixed together and stored.  Still tastes great though.

I made this recipe and surprisingly my husband really enjoyed it. I only made one additional and that was cooking a cup of instant white rice on the side to add to the salad. By adding the rice it made the salad more fulfilling. I also sprinkled shredded cheese on top. This is a salad I will make again and recommend.

Awesome, and as others have indicated, a great salad to jump off on to create your own blend! I stirred the beans, corn and salsa right into the skillet with the chicken, and threw the onions into that mixture too. Added some grated marble cheese to the skillet as well which made the mixture all gooey and yummy! Grabbed some tortilla chips I had, crumbled them on top of the greens & tomatoes before layering on the chicken mixture. Added ranch dressing like others. Deeeeelishhhh!

WOW!  So much flavor.  Both my husband and I couldn't get over how good this was.  Only thing I changed was I rubbed chicken breasts with taco seasoning (I didn't have fajita seasoning) wrapped in foil and baked at 375 for 30 min (thin cut chicken breasts).    I didn't add any seasoning to the bean/corn/salsa mixture.  Served with a little cheddar cheese and a little ranch dressing.  So good.  Can't wait for the leftovers for lunch.  If you plan for left overs do not put the bean/corn mixture on until you are ready to serve again.

Made this recently and it was delicious. I used a minimal amount  of fajita sauce because I did not find the dry fajita seasoning, but it still tasted pretty good. I also added about less than a handful of  Tri-Color Tortilla Strips  when I was about to eat it.

This was a delicious salad, especially considering it only took about 25 minutes, start to finish!  The hardest thing you have to do is turn the chicken occasionally.  My family loved it.

I sauteed orange and yellow bell pepper with the onion, then added the corn, beans, salsa and seasoning. I even used chicken breasts that were already cooked. Just sliced them thin  and warmed in a pan with fajita season and olive oil. I served this dish with sour cream.

I boiled my chicken breasts with a homemade fajita seasoning, then shredded them. I did heat up the corn and bean mixture. My husband didn't like it on the lettuce, but other than that, it was a big hit at home. Others commented on how good it smelled when my husband took the leftovers to work...

This was delicious and my whole family enjoyed it! Based on what we have in the house, I used flat chicken breasts seasoned with taco seasoning, sliced in large slivers. We tossed in cherry tomatoes (helps contain the tomatoes for those tomato haters), and instead of adding salsa, we put it on the side, in addition to a choice of chipotle-mango-yogurt dressing (on the side of course). We also skipped the onions this time, and had feta as an option for the grown-ups to toss in. That cheese made me so happy. Yum. Everyone loved this salad, which is such a joy.

I liked this ok.  The fakey flavor of the mexicorn threw it off a little for me, and it really needed something creamy to blend it together.  My second try I mixed sour cream and salsa together as the dressing, but it was still missing something.  I also think my choice of greens was unfortunate for this recipe.  I used a mixed green blend with a lot of peppery arugula, and I think it overpowered everything else.  I would add cheese and some crumbled tortilla chips.  I might try this again with some milder greens and without the canned mexicorn.

Used this as a base and did add avocado, green onion and mango and fresh grilled corn. Also used the cilantro lime dressing recipe from this site and it was great.

Really good! Even the picky husband enjoyed it:) I used red onion since it didn't say...the only thing that I might change would be to find a homemade fajita seasoning---I didn't care for the packaged one that I bought. Also, next time I will not add the extra fajita season to the vegetables--it really just took over and you cant actually taste the veggies....but besides that, it was really good! Thanks for sharing!

Mom really liked this dish - I added in avocado and it was delicious! I will probably home-make my fajita seasoning next time. I am not a huge fan of onion, so I only put about 1/4 in and it was perfect as a background flavor.

Arreeeeba!   Easy-peazy and delicioso.  Did not put it on top of greens, but arborio rice.  The bean/corn mixture kept it all nicely moist.  Also added a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.    Will fix as a salad next time----definite keeper.

Fantastic! I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a T of light sour cream to bean/corn/salsa mixture. Also, added a couple tsp of lime juice.  Delicious and healthy if you grill the chicken.

It was good but I think it would have been better without the lettuce. Maybe use rice instead and make it a fiesta rice bowl. Or turn it into a burrito

As with so many recipes this was very good and so many ways to make it easier and cheaper. When ever possible I use store bought rotisserie chicken in chipotle seasoning. As noted by other posts I did not heat the dressing ingredient.  Dump lettuce mix into a pretty bowl top with canned black beans rinsed, canned southwest corn,cheese and top with shredded chicken. I us a simple dressing of sour cream and Chunky spicy salsa.  You can never go wrong with this combination.

We love this!  We make it at least once every other week in the summer.  We don't really change anything, but we add a bit.  We add avocado on top, sour cream, tortilla strips, and a little shredded cheddar.  I spritz the salad with lime juice as well.  The bean and corn mix is great for leftovers too.

This is a keeper! Very simple & good! I coated chicken tenders and made the bean mixture the night before. This is great in a soft or hard shell. The chicken is very good with the seasoning and will make this alone too! Thanks for the great new meal!

I like this recipe for it's ease and quickness in preparing, however, the flavor was just average for us.  I think that a homemade fajita seasoning (if I could find a good one) and fresh greens in lieu of bagged would make it more to our liking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, ANGL8277!

This was very good- could've used a bit more flavor.  Next time I make it, I'll add the onion to the bean/salsa/corn mixture, as tossing it in with the salad just resulted in it falling to the bottom of the salad bowl.  Also, I'll add in some garbonzo beans for added protein.  Very versatile dish, healthy, and so easy to prepare at the end of a busy work day!

This dish is absolutely great! I marinate cut up chicken in fajita seasoning for about 3 hours. Then I bake it in the oven with the marinade poured over it with lime juice added to it. I set it out as a buffet so that my family can choose how much chicken and bean mixture they want added to their salad. Even my pickiest eater has seconds. We also have out crushed fritos with sour cream and cheese they can add.

Very easy  to make. It really makes a great dinner salad. I left out the onion since I don't like it that much and I threw in some crushed tortilla chips to add a little crunch.

Such a deliciously light meal. I add avocado, cilantro and a touch of chili powder. We like it spicy! Also, I like to mash some pinto beans and use as the base for the salad. YUM!

I added cilantro (good extra kick) and jalepenos (WOW very hot).  Next time I will saute the jalepenos with the corn and beans to help with that heat.  Will definitely make this again.

Sorry wasn't real impressed..but could be partially my fault for using a homeade faita seasoning rescipe.  Still didn't really care for the corn and black bean mixture, just wasn't for us.

This recipe is wonderful and you can do so much with it.. I liked it because the taste was wonderful and goes nicely with my diet, but if you wanted to be bad you could.. add the sour cream,, corn chips ect... I imagine you could do this in a wrap. Very nice!

thia turned out great! I can't find black beans or mexican corn here in the UK, so I had to use regular sweetcorn and pinto beans. It turned out spicy and fresh, and was a great way to get my husband to eat a salad. We put some sour cream on top and I fried up some tortilla strips to add a bit of crunch. I will def make this again.

my husband loves anything hot and spicy..(that's why he loves me!) ...he enjoyed this salad but compared it to one on this site that he prefers. (taco salad II.) i think he was hoping that the chicken fiesta salad would have had more punch to it. good though!

I agree, really really good!  Our favorite part is the bean/corn mixture, and I have used that mixture as a salsa too.  What's great about this salad is that the recipe is delicious as is, but you can also add whatever you want to it--cheese, sour cream, tortilla chips, etc.

Very easy. A nice recipe for a "zippy" chicken salad during the summer.  I used romaine lettuce and added chopped cilantro to both the onion/tomatoe mixture and the meat/bean mixture.  I used taco seasoning intead of fajita mix with a little cumin added.  Would put a dollop of sour cream on top next time but I didn't have any.Quick and yummy!

This was fabulous!  I made it for a teacher luncheon at my daughter's school and it went over very well.  I made extra chicken and saved it for dinner to add to the other ingredients.  My husband and 12 year old daughter both asked for it to be a regular meal of ours.  I just served it with some warm bread and it was a tasty, light, delicious meal.  We love it!!
