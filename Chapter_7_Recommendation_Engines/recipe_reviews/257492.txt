This smoothie is awesome!! I must admit, I hate green smoothies. I have been trying to find one I like for a long time and finally SUCCESS! I did substitute the Agave syrup for the Stevia, and it makes a wonderful pick me up. It is quite filling, I brew my green tea and let it set in the refrigerator overnight so it ready in the morning. Give this recipe a try, you will not be disappointed.

Perfect summer morning smoothie recipe- loved the blend of spinach and mango. The stevia gave it just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering.

I've made this smoothie twice and love it!  My boyfriend liked it too. Very smooth, and I added an extra bit of stevia because I like it sweet.
