Very good.  I think that cream cheese instead of goat cheese will taste great too!

I liked this recipe because it was extremely simple to make as well as easy AND it tasted good. Next time, I think I will brush the bread with olive oil before baking and maybe add a little garlic. The taste is good and simple but I think it could be jazzed up a tad.

I made this recipe at a party and it was a hit! The great combination of flavors created a light, tasty appetizer. If you like black olives, you'll love this recipe.
