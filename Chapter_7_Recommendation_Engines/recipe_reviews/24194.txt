I didn't have high expectations going into this recipe as per the other reviews, but to my suprise this was actually pretty good. Perhaps the fact that when you take the chicken out of the pan it doesn't look extremely appealing to the eye was what turned others off?
Whatever the case.. I think I will make this again b/c it's quick and very easy and pretty tasty.  I won't change the amount of the ingredients, because the extra makes for a good sauce for dipping.  The only thing I may try different next time is to brown the chicken a little before putting in the margarita mix into the skillet, to make it more brown and to make it look nicer.

I made some changes to this recipe based on some things other reviewers suggested.  I also cut the margarita mix down to 2 cups.  I still thought the sauce was a little too sweet.  I think next time I may use 1 cup margarita mix and 1 cup chicken broth.  I browned my chicken in a little olive oil before adding the sauce mix so it would have some color.  Finally, once the chicken was cooked I removed it from the pan and boiled the sauce down.  I will probably make this again.  My husband really liked it.

I prepared this recipe with only 2 cups of the margarita mix.  I also dredged the chicken breasts in flour (with some Mrs. Dash added) before browning them in 1 tablespoon olive oil.  I removed the chicken from the pan while mixing the sauce, brought the sauce to a boil, then added the chicken breasts back to the pan.  The flour from the dredging helped to slightly thicken the sauce.  I served the sauce in custard cups on the side for dipping.  It was much sweeter than I expected it to be.  The husband LOVED it!

This recipe was great, and everyone LOVED it!!!
The one thing I would change would be the amount of margarita cocktail needed to make this... You really don't need all that much.  When I prepared it, I marinated the chicken in the mixture and pan seared it with a bit of Mrs. Dash...

I was eager to try this recipe. It was very easy, but I won't make it again. It had a very odd flavor that neither my husband or I cared for. We didn't finish eating this dinner.

I was very excited to try this recipe. I took other poster's suggestions and used  just 2 cups margarita coctail and added about 1/4 cup tequila. I dredged the chicken in flour and grilled it in olive oil on a grill pan while bringing the sauce to a boil, then added the chicken to the sauce. It came out pretty good. I made it for company, which all complimented it. Still, I had hoped it would be a little better than it was. I will try it again after modifying a bit more.

I was a little unsure of this dish, but it came out really tasty!  I followed suggestions from other reviewers and browned the chicken first and used less mix than required.  I added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Really really sweet and also really sour. Children may have a problem with the sourness of this recipe.

The sauce turned out really soupy, in part to the fact that I didn't add any alcohol and have a "proper" margarita mix to add. Next time I will take antoher reviewer's advice and add some cornstarch. Overall this dish is delicious. The lime taste is very worth it.

This tasted okay, but I wasn't overly impressed.  The instructions said to simmer, but I think they meant to bring the sauce to a mix first, then add the chicken and cook that for a while before just simmering.  It also took 20 minutes to cook on high heat instead of the 15 the recipe said on simmer.  The liquid didn't boil down to a glaze either.  Most of the liquid was still left in the skillet when the chicken was finished.  It was okay, but I probably won't make it again.

WAY too sweet for us.  The mix was overpowering, even for the chicken.

I used the advice of the previous reviewers of this recipie and the chicken came out great.  I browned the chicken with 1 Tbsp of olive oil, drained off the excess water, and simmered the chicken in 1/2 of the amount of margarita mix that the recipie called for.

It wasn't a bad idea in a pinch, and I got rid of my extra mix, but I wouldn't make it again unless I didn't have ingredients on hand to make something else.  However, what i did find made the mix a little more "glaze like" was that I heated the mix first, then whisked some flour in, THEN put the chicken in.

I changed this recipe a little (borrowing the advice of others' comments). I first marinated the chicken breasts in lime and three fresh garlic cloves. I added one packet of "sazon goya con culantro y achiote," one cup of margarita cocktail mix, one cup of chicken broth.

I used the frozen magarita mixer you can buy in the frozen juice section and followed the directions on the can as well as the ingredients above. I let it marinade for about two hours and it was absolutely delicious! Served it with red beans and rice and corn and we will definetly use this recipe again.

We enjoy this a lot.  After making it many times, I have changed it a little.  I mix the sauce ingredients and boil it hard for about 5 minutes before I add the chicken to thicken the sauce.  I cut the chicken into small pieces and serve it with tortillas and avocado chunks - then we make margarita chicken tacos.
