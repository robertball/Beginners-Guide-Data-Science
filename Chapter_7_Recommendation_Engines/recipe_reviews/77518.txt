I was very dubious about this but I decided to try it because it was so full of healthy ingredients.  I was pleasantly surprised! The recipe turned out great and tasted delicious.  What an unusual but clever combination!  The dressing was probably my favourite part - so good I forgot it was non fat until I came back here to rate the recipe!  I will serve this next time we have company.

This dressing was phenominal.  I was so pleasantly surprised at how good it actually tasted.  In lieu of honey, I used 4 T water and 3 pkg. Splenda.  I'm sure that the recipe is even better as written, but I wanted to cut as many calories as possible.  This was awesome.

Fantastic recipe, the curry dressing really pulls the flavors together. I have made it with & without the onion.

A good salad, I used all balsamic vinegar, 2 teaspoons curry powder, toasted the pecans and used more blueberries, freshly picked from our local blueberry farm, to regenerate even more of those new brain cells :).

I thought this salad was absolutely delicious! The dressing really brought all of the other ingredients together. I substituted sliced almonds for the pecans to suit my own tastes. Great recipe!

I served this at a dinner party and got rave reviews.  I added a little olive oil and splenda to the dressing.  I love the combination of berries.

This caught my eye because the dressing sounded so easy and tasty.  I was not disappointed.  It was light, very flavorful and complimented the leafy spinach, tangy purple onion, and the sweet fruit.  A little goes a long way too.  I didn’t have strawberries so I substituted chopped nectarines.  I also left off the nuts only because I didn’t have any.  Topped the whole thing off with grilled chicken breast. Very delicious main-meal salad!  A keeper!

I never thought I would eat spinach let alone spinach and strawberries but I tried this for company we had over and decided it would not look good if I didn't at least eat some too. Instantly fell in love with it. I eat this 4 or 5 times a week. Is that addiction? Thank you so much. The dressing is magnificent!

i can't speak to the salad recipe as a whole, but the dressing alone is delicious! a little heavy on the vinegar, but i happen to like my dressings tangy. i used it on a salad of wheat berries, roasted butternut squash, red onion, dried cranberries, and pecans. so good!

We really enjoyed this salad.  I added some raspberries and some chopped apricots I had just purchased.  I rummaged through my freezer looking for some pecans I knew were in there, but for the life of me I couldn't find them.  So I put in sliced almonds instead.  Of course, I found the pecans later whilst looking for something else.  The dressing as written was very potent, I think it could possibly be used as fuel, so I added a couple tablespoons of water to calm it down.  Otherwise, the salad was very good.

I love this salad and make it frequently.  I'm especially crazy about the dressing, which I whip up often to drizzle over salads or fruit.  It has lots of zing, while being naturally fat free.  For a main dish I sometimes add grilled chicken to this salad.  DELISH!

I'm not good at eating salads and never care for salad dressing. Since trying out this recipe, I have been carrying salad for lunch (that's a first). I also served it to my guest and they could not get enough of the salad.

This is my second review, but I have to tell you that I have adopted this non-fat curry dressing for so many things.  It is an excellent marinade for chicken.  but my favorite way to use this dressing is as a base for pizza.  Brush this dressing on pizza dough and then top it with chunked chicken, spinach and feta cheese.  It is incredible.

Amazing!  I used Trader Joe's Dijon which is very spicy, so I used more honey than called for.

Delicious!  Had to make some substitutions based on what had on hand (pine nuts instead of pecans, cider vinegar instead of rice, and brown mustard instead of dijon), and it was still fantastic.  Can't wait to bust this out for our Mother's Day BBQ : )

Excellent Salad! The dressing was spicy with a nice warmth and sharp bite. I loved this combo of sweet cool fruit and the heat of the spicy dressing. I used red curry powder. This was so delicious!

What an excellent healthy and visually beautiful salad perfect for dressing up any table when entertaining! Our family loved the unique blend of the fruit with the curry and this salad landed a spot in our regular rotation. Since we have made it several times now we had a chance to play with the dressing. Try this option using French Vanilla yoplait yogurt to create a creamy curry dressing! I'll do my best here to share what we did but you may have to play with the ingredients a bit to get the exact taste you like as we don't have the exact measurements but this is close!  One French Vanilla Yoplait Yogurt  2 tsp of Curry (Mc Cormick) brand is excellent curry 2tsp Dijon mustard or spicy brown mustard 1/2 tsp Balsamic Vinegar if desired not necessary though  And that's it! Just play with those ingredients sometimes I add more curry and we usually don't bother with the vinegar. Refrigerate the remaining dressing for a second salad.

Love this salad & have made it a number of times.  Try making it a main dish by adding some diced cooked chicken breast and penne pasta (wonderful!!).  Also,I have found that red grapes are a good substitute for the blueberries as they can get expensive.

I tried making this because i'm looking for healthier recipes for our family but the curry was just too much for us.  It seemed to colash with the spinach.  We wont be making it again.

Excellent recipe. This is very similar to a salad I made from a Weight Watchers cookbook. That recipe had all the same salad ingredients but also added some toasted ramen noodles on top. Just break up ramen noodles from one package in a dry skillet and toast on medium heat with the pecans for several minutes. This adds a nice crunch to the salad. The dressing was also similar with the curry and balsamic except it used a blend of sesame and olive oil (no longer nonfat though). Personally I like the dressing in this recipe with the Dijon and honey but the sesame oil adds a nice touch too. This one is a keeper!

I liked this. It's a good salad, very different. Complex tastes but easy to make. I used just under 1 teasoon of curry powder, but kept everything else the same. I'm not sure that I will make it again though as I prefer my salads that have fruit in them to have a sweeter taste. If I did make it again, I would put a bit of olive oil in the dressing and sweeten it slightly more (like some others suggested)

This salad was very fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that the curry was a bit too strong for me but, I'm not a huge curry fan and so I'm sure it is the perfect amout for most people. This salad screamed nutrition and low-fat. I was very pleased.

We really loved this salad. We ended up adding a little bit more honey because I think that we originally added a bit too much vinegar and/or curry powder and it was initially too tangy. In addition, we added feta to the mix, which turned out to be a nice addition. We were surprised at how well the spicy/tangy dressing complimented the sweet fruits. We swore that the dressing made the strawberries fizz as we chewed, sort of like pop-rocks (in a good way!) All in all, a very nice recipe. Thanks for posting!

I love the idea of this recipe, but as written, the dressing is a bit heavy on the vinegar for my tastes. Definitely loved the curry flavor with the fruit and spinach. Thanks for sharing! :)

I liked the mix of fruit and vegetables in the salad, but I did not like the dressing at all. I will make the salad again but will use a different dressing.

The curry dressing is excellent!  It tastes great on salad as well as a dipping sauce for veggies.  I've even used it as a marinade.  A very refreshing and healthy salad for the summer.

Very pleasantly surprised with the curry in the dressing - I served this on fathers day for all of my picky eaters and everyone loved it.  I will make this again for sure.  I am always looking for ways to jazz up my salads.  Try it - you won't regret it!

New Favorite Alert! I was looking for a salad to use up some blueberries and got interested in the curry/balsamic element of this one. This has got to be one of the very best dressings I've had in my life. If I was looking for non-fat dressing, I would be thrilled with the find. Since I'm not - I'm still thrilled, and I added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil for a better cling factor. Still low-cal, but let's face it: even great things are a better with a little fat. Thanks for the recipe!!

I added a splash of EVOO and served it with roasted turkey and feta on top.  It was still a little on the tart side even with the honey, so next time I will add a little splenda.  Thanks for sharing a good healthy recipe.

This was fantastic! I had some leftover boiled shredded chicken, plain, and shook up a little bleu cheese with the salad/dressing and crumbled some more on top. Also added 2 tbs olive oil and only had 2 tbs worth of honey but used honey dijon mustard and it tasted great. It has a few more calories but with the chicken & bleu cheese, this turns into a filling, yet healthy, dinner.

Was not my favorite, but that is personal taste. I did substitute olive oil and balsamic vinegar as my dressing, which may have had an impact.

Awesome! I was looking for something low fat and different, and this fit the bill.  Everyone  was skeptical about curry dressing, but everyone loved it!  My daughter was disappointed that there was no extra.  Will y make this again real soon.

Delicious dressing!  Made the dressing exactly as written - the curry adds a wonderful flavor that makes it different and special (but thankfully not weird).  For salad I used a spinach mix, blueberries, pine nuts, and a little feta.  I think any dark green salad/spinach with a berry and nut would work great as a base.  The dressing complements it so well.  Served with salmon and pasta to rave reviews!

I made this the other night for a friend who has crones disease.  It  was sensational.  It met all her requirements while being delicious.  I have had it three times since and will be making it for lunch tomorrow.  The only change I made was to omit the rice vinegar and add an extra tablespoon of balsamic.  Yummy.

Awesome.  Not a big salad guy, but with my GF wanting me to eat better, I am glad this turned out great.  I look forward to making and eating this.  I don't use all the dressing, no blueberries, and added feta cheese.

I'm thinking its virtually fat free.  Great choice of dressing and fruit.   Although we toasted the pecans for sweetness and used apple cider instead of rice vinegar.  Next time I might add a little blue cheese and bacon.

Great recipe. Everyone is right about the onions and dressing mixture blending in perfectly. I ran out of blueberries so I used raspberries the second time I made this. Was still great and I make this several times a week!

This was great.  I did a little different because I didn't exactly have all the ingredients but followed the main idea and it turned out wonderful.  
I didn't put strawberries and I used green onions instead of regular onion.  Also, I didn't have dijon so I just used regular yellow mustard and it was still wonderful.  Great tasting.

Delicious, beautiful, and low calorie. Just what I was looking for. I left out the onion, as I thought it would overpower the rest of the ingredients. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really great salad! I had to leave out the strawberries because mine were moldy, but the salad was still great without them. I really liked the curry dressing... I can't believe there was no oil involved!

Excellent light salad.
I used pumpkin seeds instead of the pecans.  Finding the dressing a little tart I added a small dash of olive oil, and I also used whole grain dijon mustard.  Yum Yum

Really good! I used a mix of frozen berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, etc.) and that was really good. Didn't have any rice vinegar so used all balsamic. I think my curry powder is not very fine because every once in a while I would get a strong curry taste, not good, but when all blended well the flavors are great together. Will make again for sure.
