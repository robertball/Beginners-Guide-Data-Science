Chicken en Mole is what I always order at Mexican restaurants and this was similar, but not good enough. I added more sugar and even semi-sweet chocolate chips to make it sweeter.

This was a good recipe! I didn't use as many onions because I had less chicken breasts. After the chicken was cooked I shredded it and added it again to the mole, then used it for burritos. The combination of chicken mole, rice, beans, and toppings for the burrito made it very good.

This is not like any other mole that I have had.  However, with that said, I don't think it's that bad of a dish either.   I used leg quarters vs breasts. Usually, I think mole is served with chicken pieces.  I think it added some additional flavor.  Just know what you are getting into.

I followed the directions to a T and couldn't even bring myself to serve it for dinner. A great way to waste your ingredients...will never make this recipe again. EVER.

This recipe was very tasty, if you are into mole with a lot of veggies (onion and tomato.)
I loved the dark chocolate/cinnamon combo and have added this into my permanent recipe box! Thanks!

We doctored this a bit, added chicken stock and cooked it down, and pureed the veggies. It was still not the mole taste I was looking for. There's definately something lacking here, and I don't see how there could have been anything closer to mole had the recipe been followed exactly. Not too bad to eat, but not good, either.

I cut back on the peppers a bit because I am a wimp and used dried oregano. This was tasty, but for my tastes needed just a tad more sugar. I added a pinch more and it was perfect. I'm gobbling this stuff up
