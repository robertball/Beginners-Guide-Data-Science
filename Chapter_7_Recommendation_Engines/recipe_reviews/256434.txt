Made molded candy leaves (without the hearts & sparkles) and they were perfect.  I use Wilton's candy melts, but I'm sure any melting chocolate would work well.

Fun recipe - I made a couple of changes.  I added chopped walnuts (chopped small) and sliced fresh strawberries and cut a   "V" at the top to shape into a heart rather than the freeze dried ones.  I'll add a picture as well
