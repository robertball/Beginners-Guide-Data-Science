Outstanding!  Added the tomatoes at the same time as the shrimp while cooking.  Also, doubled the garlic and the cherry tomatoes from the recipe.  Used broccoli alongside - excellent choice.

I prepared this with white rice and minus the tomatoes. I also added a little butter, for flavoring.  We LOVED it!  We had NO leftovers!  I will DEFINITELY prepare this one again.

Really quick and easy. I have made a few changes. I add some cayenne pepper and other spices that my family likes when marinating the shrimp. And sprinkle the halved  grape tomatoes with parmesan cheese.

I was not impressed with this dish. I thought the paprika was overpowering. I will not be making this again.

I read the recipe as saying the saute is quick, not neccessarily the whole recipe. I still consider this quick and easy, as you put the rice on and blend the shrimp, walk away, and 50 minutes later come back to take off the rice and cook everything up. But semantics aside, this is a really delicious dinner. I don't cook with paprika often, and I enjoyed the flavor of it, the pepper, and garlic. I'd like to try spinach in here, added with the tomatoes, for color and my own preference, but as-written this is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This is actually a bit tasty!  Instead of shrimp, I added mock-chicken.  I also added onions for zeal and a small bit of red bell peppers.  You may be able to add white cooking wine for a even better taste.  You can reduce the amount of salt as it tends to be a little too salty.  To cure the salty taste I used a pinch of cumin.

This was very good, especially for a healthy recipe. I made this exactly as stated (and added the tomatoes during the last minute of cooking), and it was simple, quick, and tasty - with just a touch of heat. The only thing that took some time was cooking the rice (about 35 minutes total for Uncle Ben's Original Recipe Long Grain & Wild Rice, microwaved). Also, the shrimp took a couple of minutes longer to cook than specified when I made it. Overall, I'm very pleased with this. I will definitely make this again soon.

My family liked it!  I got around the long cooking time for the rice by using a box of mixed white rice and wild rice.  (I just left out the seasoning packet it came with.)  That may ruin the value of the recipe for the diet plan it was made for (I have no idea), but that didn't bother us since we're not on any specific diet.

So it's a little bit time-consuming to make the rice, but overall, this recipe is the best! Very similar to a shrimp recipe I have, only you add in a couple of green onions -chopped-, a bottle of Kraft Italian salad dressing -it goes right in the pan with the shrimp-, and top with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Really good over pasta too, thanks for sharing this variation.

I added more cloves of garlic and threw in some frozen spinach with the tomatoes at the end.    i also threw some leftover brown rice in the pan to heat it up, and it soaked up the flavor of the shrimp and garlic well.  It was delicious!!!

This was good.  It is NOT QUICK AT ALL, as another reviewer suggested.  Wild rice takes over an hour to cook.  It takes at least 65 minutes to cook on the stove top.  The longer you cook it the softer and more like "almonds" it tastes.  I love wild rice so I tried this.  I did not think, reading the recipe it would be that good.  I am glad I made it.  Add the tomatoes when you start cooking the shrimp or shortly there after.  A five star, but allow at least 1 1/2 hours cook and prep time.

My BF and I really liked this!  Only use 1 teaspoon of paprika and a lot more garlic.  It was a quick, easy and low calorie meal and I will be making this again!

This was easy and good. I used frozen chicken tenderloins (partially thawed and cubed) rather than shrimp. I also used golf-ball sized tomatoes chopped, and a box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice. It took about 30 minutes total, and was really tasty for a healthy dish.

My husband, not a big seafood person, but who will tolerate shrimp, LOVED this.  I ended up using jumbo shrimp, because they were on sale.  But the flavor was great, and I can't wait to make this again.

This was yummy.  Easy leftovers for lunch.  Just saute the shrimp and warm up leftover rice.  You would never know that it's lite.  Beef up on the paprika if you like it hot.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very tasty. I made it for my roommate and myself and we both loved it. It is very filling but not heavy. I made some changes, however. Double (at least) the garlic, and reduce salt and paprika.

This was surprisingly tasty for a "diet" recipe! My husband went nuts over this. I forgot the tomatoes but I'll add them next time - that would've made it even better. I also had some alfredo sauce (from the Easy Alfredo Sauce I recipe) and I used a little to make the wild rice a little more palatable - that was good too. Will definitely make again.
