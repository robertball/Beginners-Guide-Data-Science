HUGE hit. Huge. Unequivocally the star of the show. This dessert brought grown men to their knees. Never mind dinner, I could have served this and this alone and I think everyone would have been happy. Hubs had requested I make an ice cream dessert for our Memorial Day cook-out and I was less than enthusiastic. None of the recipes really tripped my trigger, but I finally settled on this one, I guess because it called for something homemade and not processed - the fudge. Sure, you could take the easy way out and use a jarred fudge sauce but this was so easy to make it's not really worth it to take the shortcut. I wasn't expecting much from this dessert. After all, it's basically just a hot fudge sundae, right? WRONG. This stuff is good - awesome good. Just a few cookie crumbs, some ice cream, fudge, peanuts and some whipped topping, but man, put them all together and you've got a dessert that everyone loved and that truly made a dinner get-together finale memorable. None of us knew what a Buster Bar was, but all agreed this was "D good." This was the first, but not nearly the last, time I'll be making this.  Other than using butter rather than margarine, I followed the recipe exactly, but thought the dessert would look a little naked so I topped it with Cool Whip and sprinkled it with more Oreo cookie crumbs. (One other bonus - the crust actually comes out of the pan intact!)

Awesome.  I made this in a 9" springform pan and I layered the crust, ice cream, some fudge topping, then ice cream, peanuts, and the remainder of the fudge topping.  I will never buy a $14 ice cream cake again.  This is great!

THE BEST!  I will never go to DQ again for this! I crushed one package of Oreos in a plastic wrapper and the cream filling stuck to the sides...so I threw the bag in the freezer for 5 minutes and rubbed the two sides together and the cream filling fell right out! I used milk choc. chips and it tasted awesome...definitely a repeater!

This was a huge hit with my family.  I poured the chocolate sauce on too early so it did not layer..but rather melted the ice cream a bit....but the taste was delicious. Just wait till the topping is all the way cooled down!

How could this not be good??!?
This was a DUTCH favorite (As my church friends and family called it) in my hometown, Bellflower, CA.
Add a half cup peanut butter to chocolate mix for more peanut taste.
Buy mocha ice cream for mud pie taste!

Really a great and easy recipe!  YUM. I substitute spanish peanuts so it is even more similar to a dairy queen peanut buster parfait. My mouth is watering just thinking of it...

This was yummy.  My only suggestion is to take it out of the freezer about 15 to 20 minutes before serving.  Otherwise, it is just too hard to cut.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and layered this in a 9" springform pan (crust, ice cream, fudge sauce, ice cream, peanuts, fudge sauce.) It looked fabulous and it tasted great. Only 4 stars, though, as the fudge sauce seemed to be missing something. Next time I will use 6 oz. of good quality semi-sweet chocolate instead of chocolate chips. Am eager to make this for company now that I've done a "test-run"!

This is OK, but really so rich.  No one could finish their portion, I would cut them small!  I made the mistake of not letting the chocolate sauce cool enough before I poured it over the ice cream.  SO the top of the ice cream melted a little and came up through the chocolate sauce.  Did not change the taste, just didn't look attractive.  Make sure to let the sauce cool, I would make that first next time.  I really don't think I would make this again though, just too rich.

Loved the combination of all the textures and flavors.  The crunch of the peanuts was so great, the richness of the chocolate topping, the crunch of the oreo crust, and creamy ice cream.  I did take the advice of others and added more vanilla ice cream and was glad I did. I couldn't stop thinking about having a piece, until it was gone!  So good.

This is my go to option when I need to bring a dessert. I make it in 2 9 inch premade chocolate crumb pie crusts to save time.

This is absolutely phenomenal!  This goes way beyond a sundae.  I gave some to the neighbors and they were still telling me how great it was a week later!  In the picture it looks as though she added whipped cream to the top, even though that wasn't in the recipe.  I tried it and it was delicious, although I didn't really think it was necessary.  This dessert is seriously heavenly.  I ate about half the pan by myself!  I wish that was a joke, but it isn't.  You HAVE to give this recipe a try!

Got his recipe years ago from my sister-in-law. Always a tremendous hit. Would like to add some caramel sauce to it,. Tried to add a layer of caramel sauce but it froze, made it viturally impossible to cut and hard to chew.

This is an easy five stars!  The chocolate sauce on it's own is fantastic!  The only trouble I had was in trying to guess how much a pound of oreos was and I don't think I did a good job with that because my crust didn't stay together.  Can hardly wait to make this one again!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!! Only changes I made were used butter instead of margarine. I layered fudge and peanuts on top of cookie crumbs ad froze for about an hour. Then layered ice cream and topped with more peanuts and remaining fudge. Served cool whip on the side as aoptional. I brought this to a BBQ and it was devoured! Tastes like a Peanut Buster Parfait from DQ!! YUMMY! Will be making again very soon!

Wow super rich! I couldn't finish my piece- and I have a huge sweet tooth! I used a spring form pan. After making the fudge sauce I poured it into two bowls and put about 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter into one. I added the cooled chocolate fudge to the chilled oreo crust, put it back in the fridge for an hour, added the ice cream, then put the spanish peanuts and peanut butter chocolate fudge on top. Next time I'll halve the fudge (but still add the peanut butter!) if I use the spring form pan and use fewer oreos (I took the icing out)

Delicious! I have to stop myself from eating it or I'll get sick. We used a cheap "store brand" ice cream and I would recommend splurging on the good stuff, because the recipe is worth it.

This was awesome.  My husband is hoping it is on the menu every weekend.  I didn't have evaporated milk and substituted 6 oz heavy cream and 6 oz 2% milk.  Also used butter in place of margarine.  The chocolate syrup was delicious (definite keeper) and will be used in other desserts.

Just like my grandma's recipe!  Don't use anything smaller than a 9x13 pan, though -- I used an 8x10 because it was the only one clean.  The chocolate didn't set up well because it was too thick.... but it still had the perfect flavor!  I used as many peanuts as I could cram on there, too, the more the better.  Yum!

While I haven't eaten this as a whole, I tasted each of the components and it's going to be amazing! (I made it for a dessert menu special at work and couldn't cut into it quite yet.) The fudge sauce is KILLER!! Paired with a tasty oreo crust and delicious vanilla bean ice cream, how could this not be an awesome treat?!  A great treat for a hot summer day! This fudge sauce is a keeper!

I have to say that this was good, but with the overwhelmingly excellent reviews I was really expecting something more. I liked how easy the recipe was. I did use butter instead of margarine, so perhaps that made the difference, although I find that I generally prefer butter in a recipe over margarine. I think it should be pointed out that with the chocolate sauce (and maybe this is only true if you use real butter), you should spoon the chocolate out onto the top of the peanuts, avoiding dumping the leftover oil onto it. The oil acts as a great lubricant so that the chocolate doesn't stick to the pot, but what little oil got onto my dessert gave it an undesirable "glazed" looking effect upon serving. As I said, the taste was fine, but it's not "the best dessert I've ever eaten". I'd make this again, certainly.

Very tasty. The crust is a tad too thick tho. So next time I make it I will use less. I also agree that Spanish peanuts make a big difference. I topped my crust with caramel topping. All in all it was super duper tasty!

Fantabulous!  Wow!  I didn't change a thing.  The fudge is fantastic and I will make the fudge to put on ice cream instead of buying the awful stuff from the store.  I put a layer of whipped cream over the fudge after the fudge layer chilled and sprinkled extra cookie crumbs on top.  Thank you for this amazing recipe.  You will NEVER buy a store bought ice cream cake after you have this.

Young and old love this.  Always a hit.
Adaptations:
Must use SPANISH PEANUTS.  It makes all the difference.
Save time, put the cookie, sans cream filling, in a food processor.  
I baked the crust for 8 minutes in order to give it a sturdier base when serving.

I made this with vanilla oreos (since the kids ate all the chocolate ones)...VERY TASTY.  Of course, I was so eager to get this made, I kind of rushed the fudge sauce cooling...so it rises to the top of the dessert.  Doesn't affect taste, but definitely make the fudge the day before if you can.

This was outstanding!  It was easy to make, and surprisingly easy to cut even though it was frozen.  It was a big hit with everyone!

This is a great dessert everyone loved it!!!  Next time I will do a layer of caramel for a Snicker Bar taste.  It is worth making your own hot fudge, it is really good!

This is a dead-ringer for the famous DQ Buster Bar. Summarizing reviewers tips that I used: 1) 9" spring form pan works great, 2) semi-sweet chocolate squares, 6 to 8 ounces, and 3) Spanish peanuts. Here's what I learned: 1) as the chocolate mixture begins to boil, turn the heat down (once it begins to boil, it will continue even at a lower temperature) because the chocolate can stick if you are using a low quality pan, 2) it goes without saying, but use a high quality vanilla ice cream, since that's a major ingredient, 3) The recipe calls for a pound of sandwich cookies, but does not mention removing the centers, which I did and I assume is correct, but that is something that should be clarified for inexperienced cooks.

High marks to Tym for an excellent idea.

Colossal success!  I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  One of my guests ended up having 4 pieces before the night was over!  I don't normally like ice cream desserts, but the combination of flavors in this is just too good.  Just as everyone has said, it really does taste just like a Buster Bar!  The only thing I did differently was add an 8 oz. container of Cool Whip on top.  I will definitely be making this again...it's a keeper!

YUMMY!! I made this for our youth group at church to celebrate the September birthdays, and although it didn't look pretty, they tried it and just loved it! They came back for seconds, and even invited their parents to try after class! I will certainly make again!

I had my doubts, but this was a hit! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday. (He's Dairy Queen’s biggest fan.) He raved for days. I took the leftovers to work and it was gone within minutes. Had lots of request for the recipe, too. Well done!

Holy Cow!!!  This was served to a group of 20+ people, and everyone just raved.  The chocolate layer is just decadent!  I think when I make it again (and I definately *will* be making it again)  I will chop the peanuts, otherwise, simply a perfect summer dessert!

Awesome, the only change I would make is to either add a bit more ice cream or cut back a bit on the fudge.  it was very heavy - but unreal

Another new dessert to make again and again!  It was very good.  All I did different was to cut down on the powdered sugan in the chocolate layer.  There was no one who did not like it.

Absolutely my favorite desert!!  Since I was a child, my aunt has made this and it is so special to me! This recipe is right on!  This is a CROWD PLEASER!  If I take it to a party and am afraid of peanut allergies, I'll leave the last third without nuts!  Otherwise, it's perfection.  Just don't count calories!!

This recipe was easy to make and it was the perfect desert for a hot day. 

I served it very frozen and found that the crust was a bit too hard to cut so the next time I would cut down on the amount of cookies to make the crust thinner.  I would also recommend making sure that the ice cream is very frozen when assembling this cake - I let mine soften to make slicing it easier but it turned out a tad too melted. Also, make sure that the fudge topping layer is very chilled or else it will melt your ice cream when you spread it. 

I hope those tips help - this recipe is a winner.

We are buster bar fans and I saw this recipe and had to try it.  It's excellent!  I did do a double layer of peanuts (doubled the amount used) like the actual bar on top of the crust layer and then on the ice cream as called for. Yum!

I made this for dessert last night and my guests all went back for seconds. It was amazing. My husband told me that he will have to eat it for lunch because he can't wait until dinner time to eat it again. We have decided that this will be the dessert for the next party. Delicious.

WOW!  Yummy!  We loved this.  It was so easy to make and is so good and rich!  This fudge sauce is so good - I think I'll be making this to have to put over ice cream.  We had it last night and tonight at dinner we were already commenting we couldn't wait to have dessert!

I will never have to go to Dairy Queen again.  This was a wonderful dessert that tastes just like A "Peanut Buster Parfait."  It serves alot because it is so rich.  I did add more ice cream to make the ice cream layer a little thicker.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Fantabulous!!!  Deliciously addicting.  I grew up loving the Dairy Queen Buster Bar Parfait, so I used Spanish peanuts as suggested by others and simply loved it.  Wonderful in the summer, but so good you'll want to crank up the heater in the winter to enjoy it then too!!!

Very, very rich and wonderful during the summer months. TIP: This melts slower if you can tuck the dish into a large Igloo ice chest. You'll want to make sure everyone is ready to eat this when you go to serve it!

Holy Moley.  Sure to inspire some praise if you take it to a party. This recipe really brought back memories as my midwestern mom used to make it for a summer dessert.  We called it peanut buster parfait -- like the ones at Dairy Queen, except with the oreo crust.  This is why I use the Spanish peanuts instead of the dry roasted because it makes it more DQ peanut buster parfait-like.  I also add some more peanuts on top of the chocolate sauce because it just looks better.  Very very important to make sure that chocolate sauce is cooled before you layer it on the ice cream.  Next time I make it, I'm thinking of experimenting with perhaps mint oreos, or switching up the ice cream flavor.

Wow!  This is sinfully delicious.  I substituted butter for margarine in this recipe but followed everything else exactly.  I think my favorite part of this dessert is the chocolate topping.  I thought about substituting chocolate fudge from the jar (as I was stirring over a hot stove for 8 minutes!) but after trying the recipe as it is, I would never substitute a jarred chocolate.  It is absolutely heavenly.  I made this for company and they couldn't stop raving about it!

I made this for our neighborhood luncheon and everyone loved it.  I added about a half cup more chocolate chips to the sauce because I wanted it to be darker, but otherwise made it just like the recipe was written.  You could slice the ice cream thicker, using about 3/4 gallon.  I think that's what I will do next time.  I made the sauce while the crust was freezing and let it cool, that worked out great.  I garnished with chopped peanuts.  It was pretty!  I will make this many times, I'm sure.

This is a crowd pleasing dessert that everyone was raving about.  The topping stays soft and the whole dessert tastes wonderful.  After reading reviews, I used oreo crumbs as opposed to crushed cookies, which worked well (I sprayed the dish with PAM, so the dessert came out easily too.)  Also used butter, not marg.

I needed a fancy homemade cake, but my oven has broken down and this recipe came to the rescue. I did alter it, however. I used a 10 inch round pan, made extra crust and pressed it up the sides, doubled the ice cream (using chocolate and vanilla swirled together), I mixed chopped M&M's in with the vanilla icecream only, put one layer of ice cream, one of peanuts and one of fudge sauce, another ice cream layer, peanuts, sauce, then one more ice cream layer. I topped it off with this recipe: 2 cups cream, 1 cup icing sugar, 1/2t vanilla 1/2 cup cocoa beaten together and piped on the top. Spectacular dessert. Once cut the fudge layer seems to ooze out so I pressed cardboard against the sides of the leftover cake and that did the trick!

This dessert was a BIG hit with the kids (and the adults!!) And with me being an ice-cream freak, I was in heaven!!  This dessert will definitely yield 20 servings.

I totally screwed this up tonight.  Was tired and tried to take shortcuts - and I lost my sauce because of this.  Anyway I got to reading reviews and had to smile at one who said they actually removed the oreo filling from all of the oreos?  Really?  I've always just put the package of cookies in my processor - pulse till fine crumbs and its perfect ... I would hate to remove the white fillings from the oreo's - omgosh what a job that would be!  Then you'd be forced to eat the white filling :-)  Anyway I put my sauce in a stainless revere ware pan and put the burner on 6 - nice bubbles formed - left the room after setting timer.... about 4 minutes into it I went in the kitchen and found a horrible smell and totally burnt bottom of the pan - PEEEYU .... someone did mention to watch for this disaster as it could happen with a cheap pan - but this was not a cheap pan ~ totally my fault though for not baby sitting it longer I suppose - So I will devise a new fudge topping as I need this dessert tomorrow ... but how to get the stench out of the kitchen ... such a ditzy thing to do!  I loved the idea of slicing the barely softened ice cream and just putting the slabs on top of the crust and smoothing it out - super duper easy way to handle it - chopped my peanuts in the processor till more fine - it will be good once I figure out a substitute topping - to save the day .... or I'll go to the store in the morning to buy more ingredients!

Great recipe. I served the peanuts on the side since we were serving it to young children. I liked it that way because then I could top mine with fresh fruit, which I wouldn't have enjoyed as much if it had had the peanuts in it. Will make this again and will be fun to experiment with different ice cream flavors, etc.

Very good!  I made it in two springform pans, and it was beautiful. One of my boys does not like nuts "in" recipes, so accommodating his "food mixing" issue was my only adaptation.

I made this for a group of people (about 15) and it was a huge hit!  In fact, my sister-in-law, who I shared the recipe with, said her family is now calling it their favorite dessert.  I wasn't sure the dry-roasted peanuts were the peanuts I would have chosen if I made this recipe up, but stick with dry-roasted, and not any other kind.  It was the best!!!

This has been a family standby for decades(3+).  I make it even easier by skipping the recipe for the topping and subbing hershy's hot fudge topping.  Easier and less expensive than making it.  My adult children and nephews cannot tell the difference.  You can turn this into a turtle torte by adding carmel drizzles and subbing pecans for the peanuts.  The next generation now fights over any leftovers.

This was fantastic! I made this for a family party and everyone raved about the recipe. My family said it was better than a traditional store bought ice cream cake. I used store bought fudge in place of the chocolate mixture to save time. I wouldn't recommend this becuase the fudge oozed out a little after I cut the dessert. I also created layers starting with the crust, ice cream, crust, peanuts, ice cream, and fudge.

Fabulous dessert - family loved it. Loved the choc. sauce and the dry roasted pnuts were fine. Next time I will bake in springform pan as others suggested - 9x13 pan takes up alot of space in the freezer. Also as someone else said, take out of freezer about 15 minutes before serving - very hard to cut.

This dessert was super easy and tastes awesome.  I put it in a 10" springform pan which I lightly greased as others had suggested. I used slightly less ice cream than the recipe called for and reserved some of the cookie crumbs to sprinkle on top of the ice cream along with the peanut.  It was easy to cut and remove from the pan after setting out for 10 minutes.  I plan on making more of the fusge sauce to keep in the fridge as this is way better than any store bought fudge sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll be making this one again!

The first time I made this recipe, I modified slightly due to ingredients I had on hand. I used three sleeves of Girl Scout Thin Mints for the cookie base (two sleeves = one box seemed just lighter than I wanted), and I did not use nuts. I made the mistake of not boiling the topping for the full 8 minutes, so it never thickened properly and ran slightly after I sliced the dessert. The second time I made this, I was all out of cookies, so I made a basic brownie in a 9 x 13 pan, but then cut out a 8" circle from there to set as a base in a springform pan like others recommnended using. I then topped the cooled brownie with chocolate mint ice cream, and took the remaining brownie scraps that were left from the cutout and broke them up to peanut size and sprinkled those over the ice cream. I them made sure I boiled the topping for 9 minutes, to be safe, and topped it off. I froze it for 24 hours before serving. It was extremely rich and absolutely wonderful!

This is an outstanding ice cream dessert that really does taste like a Buster Bar from DQ!

I did a slight modification by using a 9 inch springform pan rather than the 9 x 13 baking dish.  Instead of slicing the ice cream into slabs, just let it soften to the point you can easily scoop it into the springform and spread it in.  Then you put it back into the freezer just until it's set up so you can sprinkle on the peanuts and chocolate sauce.  

The dessert will be very tall...about 2.5 inches...so it looks like you bought one of those fancy ice cream cakes, but didn't!

This is great!!  I made it for Father's Day and the whole family loved it.  As suggested, I made it in a 9" springform pan.  Instead of making my own fudge sauce, I used a jar of Hershey Hot Fudge and it was perfect!!!

Went to 2 BBQ's yesterday and brought one of these to each.  Everyone went crazy over it.  Unfortunately, when I was making them I realized I bought the ice cream in round tubs which made cutting it in consistent slices impossible.  It was all bumpy, so I just waited a few minutes to let the ice cream melt a little and then smoothed it out. Back in the freezer until frozen before adding sauce.  I used milk chockolate rather than semi-sweet.  I also used a blender for the oreo's.  Used a large serving spoon to cut through the cookie mixture, which worked great.  I think next time I will use more oreo's and more chocolate sauce.  Absolute heaven!  Thanks for the post.

I made this for dessert for our family's Christmas dinner.  It was perfect!  Like one of the others, I bought store-brand cookies, evap. milk, chocolate chips and ice cream.  The only thing I did differently was increase the amount of peanuts.  Everyone really liked this and the kids wanted seconds.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

We absolutely loved this desert!  I used chips ahoy sandwich cookies and light vanilla ice cream.  Next time I'm going to experiment with different kinds of ice cream.  I couldn't believe how easy this was to put together.  This is a perfect desert for a summer bbq.  It's a keeper, thanks Ginny!

This recipe is awesome!  I don't like chocolate myself, but my husband raves about how this is identical to Dairy Queen's Peanut Buster!!  I brought it to a party and not a crumb was left!  I even make the sauce seperate and leave it in the freezer for everyone to pour on top of ice cream whenever they want!!

Love this recipe!  I always make it for get togethers with friends and family.  The chocolate sauce on the top is rich and fudge-like, a nice finishing touch to the delicious dessert.  One change I would make, though, is using less margarine for the crust.  Using 4 tablespoons is plenty, compared to the whole stick of margarine that the recipe calls for.

Excellent icecream dessert.  I followed the exact recipe but added cool whip on top sprinkled with cookie crumbs to complete.  I will never buy a dairy queen icecream cake again.  This is just as good if not better.

I served this to company and it was a hit! I added a caramel topping layer in the middle of the ice cream and it was good but not necessary. There was only a little left and my husband gobbled it up after. I did have trouble cutting through the cookie crust so perhaps I pressed it in to hard because frozen it was difficult to cut through when frozen. It was also very easy to make!

everyone loved this! The fudge sauce is to die for....could easily make and store for regular use on ice cream, etc. It is better than anything store bought! The layers on this go so well together and the peanuts give it just the right amount of flavor and texture. I even had fun making it! Thanks!

This is the best! I didn't have any evaporated milk so I used 1 1/2 cups whole milk and mixed in 1/4 cup vege oil into the milk(tip from another website) and it worked perfect! What I did different is used a spring form pan and put 1/2 of the fudge and nuts on the crust....Oh and I used spanish peanuts instead of regular ones.  This is a keeper!  Forget that expensive ice cream shop for cakes, this is it!

My family would rate this very highly and since I am not a huge fan of ice cream I will take their word for it.  It is very rich, and a little bit goes a long way.  I would make this again, as I'm sure it will be requested.

YUM! this was awesome...used a little less margarine in the base, a few more chocolate chips in the fudge, but otherwise, followed directions exactly.  We had it for about a week (just 2 of us!) and it just seemed to get better every day as the fudge sauce flavours really came together.  will definitely make again!

This was great! I used spanish peanuts instead of the dry roasted, I would highly suggest that. Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and cookies, it does not get any better. Definately take the time to make the hot fudge it is worh it.

Based on the response I had serving this at a family get-together over the weekend, I had to give it 5 stars. Everyone was impressed that the fudge saunce was from scratch- and it wasn't difficult at all! This is the first ice cream dessert I've really done, I usually bake something. It was nice to not turn on the oven for a dessert. My in-laws were thrilled that I gave them the leftovers.

I made this for the 4th of July and it was a big hit.  I heard a lot of the same comments though....the crust is WAY too thick.  You could barely cut through it.  I would probably use half of it next time.  Also, I think Spanish peanuts would taste better.  Very good overall.

This is so good, didnt change a thing except added more ice cream. Took advice of another reviewer, and made the sauce first, so it had time to cool. It does taste like a buster bar. This is a keeper.Thanks for the recipe.

I made this dessert yesterday for my brother's birthday, and everyone licked the plates!! I didn't do any changes or substitutes - and found the top chocolate sauce to be a little too sweet. I will be making this dessert again next Saturday for a family barbeque and the only thing I'll do differently will be cutting down the sugar to half cup, I think. But that's obviously my taste of sweetness! Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was a fantastic recipe! I made it for a get together, and we all thought we would have a bite of it before lunch......well, it turned out to be our lunch! Eveyone at two huge pieces, and skipped lunch! Worth every minute, and the fudge sauce tastes just like DQ's.

Yummy! This was a real treat! The vanilla ice cream I bought had already disappeared before I got around to making this, so I used a caramel chocolate chip swirl flavor, which just added to the good taste.

I would give this 5 stars but I think the fudge sauce could be better. Maybe with some peanut butter and no powered sugar? I also made the mistake of not waiting for the fudge to cool enough so some of the ice cream melted up over the fudge. I was upset it didn't look nice but everyone ate it and said it tasted great.

I've made this for several family gatherings, and it is always a hit!  It is so rich and creamy that you can serve smaller servings and make it feed a crowd.  It is my son's favorite dessert.

This was very good, but I think the fudge sauce could be better, so I can't give it 5 stars.  I did make the fudge sauce a few days in advance and I think that ended up helping the flavors blend - it tasted more full and richer after it had been in the fridge a few days.  The day I put the dessert together I just microwaved it a minute to make it pourable (but not hot).  I also used unsalted butter which I think gave the sauce a richer flavor.  I crushed the Oreos in a ziploc bag and the stuff that stuck to the sides I threw out - I think it worked better that way, so I had 99% just chocolate cookie crumbs.  Lastly, I put the peanuts on top of the fudge sauce layer for a pretty presentation.

Excellent! Made this for a family get-together. As other reviewers have suggested, make the fudge sauce first so it has time to cool.

Excellent.  I made it once exactly to the recipe and loved it.  Tried a variation with mint chocolate chip ice cream and shaved some Andes creme de menthe candies over the top of the frosting layer for a Christmas party.  Big success.

I helped my daughter make this two times in one week. We used the cheapest ice cream and generic sandwich cookies and it was a huge hit both times. Everyone who tried it loved it. A great dessert for any time of the year.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! I made it in a round springform pan and used chocolate ice cream.  My daughter is allergic to nuts, so I used a mixture of cookie bits, mini chocolate chips and chocolate sprinkles instead.  I layered the ice cream, caramel and chocolate mixture over the crust.  Everyone said it was better than Dairy Queen!

I took this to a Labor Day picnic and I came home with an empty dish.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Will definitely be making again. I made my cookie crumbs in the food processor.  It took no time at all.

I have never tasted anything so wonderful in my life.  Definitely a keeper.  The family loved it.  It reminded us of the good ole days when we took trips to Dairy Queen and ate Buster Bars.

This was AWESOME! Made this for a BBQ and it was a huge hit! Tasted just like DQ's Peanut Buster Bars. Definately adding this recipe to my "pot luck favourites".

I tried this recipe for my daughter's birthday over the weekend and it turned out great! In fact she says it is her 'new favorite dessert'! :)
It was so easy to make and looked very impressive when displayed. Used cashewnuts instead of peanuts and I'm sure almonds would taste great too. It was a tad difficult to cut so I tried heating the knife first and that made things much easier. Will be saving this recipe and will definitely make it again and again and again and again....

Unbelievable!  Made it for a family reunion and it was gone in 15 minutes.  Wish I'd of made 2 of these since a lot of people wanted a second helping.  The fudge made as written is what makes this dessert!

Amazing!!! I couldn't find evaporated milk so I used sweetened condensed, and skipped the sugar. Next time I'll cut WAY back on the butter in the sauce, as it cooled a ton of fat leaked out so I was pouring it down the sink. I'm not sure the point of butter in a chocolate sauce anyway? Maybe I'll try a tbsp or two instead of 1/2 cup.
I poured a peanut butter sauce (heated PB, added icing sugar and a little vanilla) over some of the crust. I poured a homemade caramel sauce on the other half. Both were equally as delicious. I can't wait to make this again and again.

I used a ready - made Oreo chocolate crust and Hershey's Hot Fudge sauce-needed to cut other ingredients about in half to fit the 8" crust, but it cut down on the calories a little and sure is easy! The Oreo crust comes with a lid you can invert to store the dessert in the freezer or take to a friend.

My husband and I are huge ice cream fans. I gave this recipe a shot and it turned out great! It was so easy to make. I also put toffee chips on top of mine. I think that the next time I make it I will use more ice cream than the recipe suggests (thicker slices) so it does not seem so rich....But I am not complaining, just my preference.

Delicious, rich and yummy!  Agree with other reviewers, very decadent and small portions a must!  I lined 13x9 with wax paper before putting in cookie crumbles (and used butter throughout recipe, no margarine).  When it came time to cut them up after staying in freezer overnight, I took them out via lifting wax paper, peeled off paper and cut on a cutting board - the result, perfect squares to wrap up! Next time will mix up ingredients, family wasn't crazy about whole peanuts, thinking coconut.

Followed directions but added my own flare, melted peanut butter and drizzled onto crust before placing in the fridge and I added cool whip as another suggested. Perfect dessert and I liked the variations of mocha ice cream to make mud pie. That will be my next one to try. Thank you for sharing

Perfect recipe as is. I've made this many times and use the fudge topping for other desserts.  So easy to omit the peanuts and use other types of ice cream when you want to change it up.

This was the perfect dessert for a large Mother's Day gathering. I made it in a 9" round springform pan. I can see how it throws off the proportions a slight amount given that the area is now only 64" instead of 117" when using 9"x13". The crust was thick and sometimes hard to cut through. Definitely needs to sit out 15min or so before cutting with a hot knife. The fudge layer on top was also think and ended up being rich for some people due to the quantity per piece. Next time I will make it as suggested in a rectangular pan.

Making homemade fudge instead of using the jarred kind was awesome. I used dry roasted peanuts and thought they were a little salty. Next time I will find Spanish peanuts and try those. Overall, a very delicious summer treat that will make you the star of the party.

If I make this again, I would use chopped almonds instead of peanuts, and only use about half of the chocolate sauce.  I ended up scraping half of it off because it was just too rich.

Does it get any better than this?? Even while I was making the choc. sauce the neighbor kids were saying "what's that delicious smell?" and were very disappointed to hear that it was for the Mother's Day meal and wouldn't have a chance to try it. It was given all thumbs up by the family esp. my husband who is addicted to peanut fudge parfaits. The serving size is true, so be prepared to feed a crew. Thanks so much, this is going in the "official" family recipe folder. Everyone has to try this!!!

Yummmmy!  This recipe was fantastic, was very good and did indeed taste similar to an actual Buster Bar.  It was a big hit at a dinner I recently had.  Will definitely make again.

I'm not a big fan of the Dairy Queen version of this dessert and almost didn't try it because of it.  I'm glad I did!  It's fabulous!

Very good....wasn't overly excited about the frosting on top...I put a small layer of chocolate ice-cream, and vanilla icecream for variety.  Otherwise we loved it. Keeps good.

This was a great recipe! My husband and I loved it. We're both very big ice cream and peanut fans so this was perfect for us. I cut the ice cream in about 1 inch slices and used slightly more chocolate chips and peanuts. I definitely recommend this!

Yummy.  I served it with a variety of nuts and marshmallows and let my guests put what they wanted.  I have a daughter who is allergic to nuts and wanted her to enjoy this dessert so she had it with marshmallows and enjoy it, she did.
