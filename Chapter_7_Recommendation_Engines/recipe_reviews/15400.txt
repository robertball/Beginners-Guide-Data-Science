I wortked at O'Charley's restaturant and this is their recipe exactly - except they boil the large cans.  I make this for family holidays using 2 small cans of low fat or fat free sweetented condensed milk.  You have to put it in a bowl and "whip" it for a minute to get the lumps out.  Everyone loves it!  Try nuts and whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.

This pie is rich, delicious, and easy...a couple of tips though... It takes 2 cans to fill one pie crust, and make sure cans are completely submerged in the water at all times.  If the water evaporates and leaves the top of the cans dry, the caramel will have uneven texture and may taste "grainy"

I didn't have a pie crust, but my curiosity got the better of me. After spooning a bit of the finished product into a small dish, I set it into the freezer for a few minutes to let it cool and thicken. While slowly savoring each and every delicious spoonful, one thought kept running through my mind- "Father, forgive me, for I have sinned..."

Okay this recipe is close to the recipe the waitress gave me at O'Charleys restaurant but you use 2 cans cond. milk and only boil for 2 hours , you then cover with whipped topping and mini chocolate chips and pecan pieces. It is DIVINE !!!!!!!

Very good. The safest way to make caramel from swc in the can is to put the can(s) in your crockpot, Add enough water to cover the can(s) by an inch,then cook on LOW for 8 hours. No danger of water running too low and having to repaint the kitchen.

Rich, rich, rich! To make the English "Banoffee Pie", add 1 1/2 pounds of sliced bananas on top of the caramel and top with fresh whipped cream with a small amount of instant coffee dissolved in it before beating.
*CAUTION 
It is extremely important to add more boiling water frequently during the cooking of the sweetened condensed milk. 4 hours is a long time and if it is allowed to boil dry the can will explode causing a mess and possibly injury.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving.  It reminded me of O'Charley's  Ooey Gooey Caramel pie.  I made the sweetened condensed milk for 4 hrs and a day ahead of time so it would be just right to put in the graham cracker shell.  I made it and after the first piece was taken out it started to run to the open space.  Should I have whipped it with mixer or what.  It was thick and creamy when I put it in the pie shell.  I made sure to keep it refrigerated but it sunk in anyway.  What can I do next time to keep it from sinking into the extra space? I want it to hold like pies should.  Please tell me what I should do next time.  E-mail me at lori76@cox.net

This was the easiest thing I've ever made!  It tasted amazing too.  My husband loved it!  I will second everyone's comments about using two cans though, one isn't enough.  Also, I only boiled mine for 2.5 hours, not 4.  The caramel was a perfect consistency and tasted great.  I also took a handful of chocolate chips and stirred them into the caramel when it was still hot, so they melted and gave it a nice chocolaty taste.  Just be careful when opening the cans.  Wait until they've cooled down enough to where you can hold it in your hand and not burn yourself.  Then after you puncture the can with the can opener, wait a second for the air (and a bit of caramel) to escape before you continue opening, otherwise you'll have caramel on your ceiling.

My curiousity got the best of me on this one and I had to give it a try. The previous reviewer is correct- the consistency when you are done boiling it is similar to cream of mushroom soup and is not asthetically pleasing. However, once it cools it resembles lemon meringue in consistency. And the taste is wonderfully rich and buttery! I topped it with cool whip, sprinkled some Heath candy pieces on top, and drizzled chocolate sauce over it. It looked great and tasted delicious! Will definitely make again.

AMAZING!! I've made this recipe many times but this is what you have to do. Boil 3 cans of sweetened condensed milk for 3.5 hours (add water as needed). Make sure the water is a rapid boil the entire time. Take the cans out and place on one end for 30 minutes - put upside down on the other end for another 30 minutes. Then open cans and place the "caramel" in a bowl and stir til smooth. Put in one large graham cracker pie shell or 8 small ones...ENJOY!!

So delicious but sooo rich.  I cooked mine for four hours and it was nice and thick.  Does anybody have any reservations about cooking in the can?  There is a warning on the label...  what kind of metal is it? Just found this...   "Even if you've never had trouble, the Nestle and Eagle Brand Web sites recommend caramelizing the sweetened condensed milk in a different way.  The stove-top method is this: Pour one can sweetened condensed milk into the top of a double boiler; place over boiling water. Over low heat, simmer 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until thick and caramel colored. Beat until smooth.

You can cook your condensed milk in the presure cooker. Leave the can sealed and put water in the cooker. Once the cooker has started to jiggle, I turned down the heat and let it cook for 30 minutes. Let the pressure go down on its own. Works great!!

I followed the directions exactly and while the caramel tasted good, it had a terrible consistency, like cream of mushroom soup from a can, that made it difficult to spread. It also didn't fill up the shell. I won't be making this as a pie again, maybe as something layered in parfait cups...

In South America, this "caramel" is called "Dulce de Leche".  Unless you can find an Argentinean store that sells it, this is about the only way to make dulce de leche unless you want to stand over a stove top stirring it for hours on end.

My family has been making dulce de leche this way since they moved here 50 yrs ago.  Like someone else mentioned, you can make it on in a pressure cooker, after the pot builds up it's pressure and starts jiggling, lower the heat and cook for 30 - 45 minutes, turn it off and let the pressure release on it's own.  Once that happens, open the lid and let the water get down to room temperature, once that happens, then you can open the can.  NEVER open a hot can or when boiling let the water get below the top of the can, or it will explode.  That is the only danger in cooking this in the can.  If you are diligent and careful, there won't be any problems and it's delicious. 

When I've cooked it in a regular pot, I've never cooked it for 4 hours, that just seems so long!  2 hours max.  But with the pressure cooker, as long as you put enough water to begin with, then you don't have to worry about it boiling away in 30 minutes, in a regular pot, you have to be vigilant.

this is deadly! i ate one very small sliver of this pie and my hands are still trembling. its good, but i wouldnt consider 2 cans.. the amount of sugar in this with just ONE can is enough. Im thinking i might use it as a layer for a cheesecake or brownies.. it should be eatten with something. The whipped topping is important. it cuts the overload of sweet down and makes it eatable.   excuse me while i go try and burn the sugar rush off.   wondering if i should have a second piece..

I have been making this for years and years.  I usually make at least 4 at a time since they take so long, though, mine only take 2  1/2 hours.  I put the cans in the pot, cover with water and bring to a boil.  Then I start the time, adding water as needed and boil for 2 1/2 hours.  I have never had a problem if the water was not covering the cans as long as you don't let the water all go, then it will have a burn taste.  Then I put the cans in the sink and pour cold water over till I can handle to cans.  Open, pour in a bowl and wisk till smoth and pour into 4 reg baked pie crust.  When they cool spred the cool whip and then I sprinkle with either nuts or shaved chocoalt.  I think I will try some with some canned apploes in the bottom-caramel apple pie!  Personal taste, but I think they are better in a baked crust rather than graham.  Also I think they taste a whole lot better tahn O"Charlies pies!

WOW. This pie is sooooo sweet. Heating the cans in the water scared the beejeebes outta me though. Next time I will go with the double boiler idea. It is just as easy to do. I even toasted some pecans and poured the caramel over them in the pie shell to make a type of pecan pie. I kept the pie in the freezer with a pie covering over it. This kept the pie from becoming 'watery' after cutting.

This turned out excellent for me! I boilded my can of sweet condensed milk for 3 hours instead of 4. The caramel set nicely for me. I didn't have any problems with it being "soupy" as a few others mentioned. I did briefly whip the caramel and then I topped the whipped topping with chopped pecans that I sauteed in butter with a dash of salt. Oh, and I only used 1 can of caramel. I suppose you could use 2 cans if you want more filling, but due to the richness, I didn't think it was necessary.

I found I had to boil the cans much longer... I'm not sure if its because I used fat free condensed milk or what, but they were delicious. The first few were fail, due to the fact that the caramel was not solidified. The next time I cooked them much longer

My rating is only on the caramel part of the pie since that is the only part of the recipe that I followed. It was rich and amazing! I made my own cinnamon pecan graham cracker crust and placed sliced baked cinnamon apples on top instead of using a store bought crust and whipped topping. My husband loved it and he doesn't even really like sweets. My children thought they died and went to heaven.... happiest faces ever!

I wondering if some of the other cooks didn't let the milk completely cool before judging pie. I let milk cool completely, apx. 3 hrs in the can, and then placed in the shell. Came out fine and was very rich and tasty. For sure will cure the sweet tooth! Spkinkled a sifting of cocoa on top.

This pie is always a hit when I make it and people think I put in a lot of work! I do turn my cans once every hour so they "cook" evenly. I also whip the caramel with a hand mixer, add fresh vanilla whipped cream on top and sometimes a sprinkle of chocolate chips. Chopped pecans would be great too!

I have made this pie several times and its always been sinfully delicious! Be sure to whisk caramel well before pouring into crust. I've used both a graham and a pastry crust, hubby prefers graham cracker crust. I usually top with homemade whipped cream and either chopped pecans or toffee bits. It is very rich tho, so a thin slice will do ya. I use this method for most recipes calling for caramel and have never been disappointed.

Wow.  This was simply way TOO sweet.  I did everything as suggested and it turned out well--it set beautifully and looked lovely.  But neither my husband nor myself could even eat a whole piece (and it was a small piece).  What a disappointment.  I'm amazed that so many people could eat this and rate it so highly because it is just too much.  Huh.  Well, I will keep in mind the clever way to make caramel.  Maybe for drizzling a little on ice cream or something.

SO good! I added 4 bananas, chopped, on top of the caramel, then the whipped cream. Such a great flavour combo! I also used regular pastry, I thought graham craker would be toooo sweet. Delish! Also, I think 4 hours was maybe alittle too long for the caramel. Maybe 3 or 3.5 would be perfect.

Delicious. For the record, allow the cans to cool before you open them. They will spew boiling hot caramel all over the kitchen. Makes sense in hind sight, what with the pressure while boiling, but the recipe didn't say to allow them to cool and I was worried they would solidify in the can.

My mother made these pies back in the 70's. It was always my favorite. She would cook 3 cans of condensed milk and it would make 2 pies. We would line the graham cracker pie crusts with bananas and sprinkle with pecans and pour the cooked milk on top and top it with cool whip. I have never made one because I am too tempted to eat it all!!! but I think I'm going to have to make one and use self-restraint :)  (This would be good with apples somehow too)

I made this with two cans of milk, boiled for 3.5 hours, which I left in the cupboard overnight.  Spooned it into a chocolate graham, topped with two bananas, then with Cool Whip.  Tried to write Happy Birthday with Hersheys topping and sprinkled with chocolate pieces.

I did not think I would be able to tolerate this pie.  I got the idea from a friend, then came to this site to check out recipes.  It was decadent and yummy and I not only tolerated it, I ate a full piece and wanted more.  It was good...  and I am still marveling at the magical caramel that comes out of the can.

Next time, I will use the slow cooker method I read about.  The boiling method was easy but the hard water from water dripping on the stove top left a bit of a mess.  

THANKS!

P.S.  Posted this review on another recipe from this site for caramel pie because I read both before I proceeded.  I think it's pretty hard to mess this up.

This is absolutely fantastic!  I made it exactly according to the directions, and it came out perfect.  A few reviewers suggested using two cans, but I think that it would make it far too rich to enjoy.  That said, the next time I make it, I plan to modify by making my own graham cracker crust, adding a handful or two of chocolate chips, and sprinkling almond slivers on top of the whole pie.  This could easily become one of my family favorites...yum!

Haven't tried this yet, but know it will work. I've been hunting this recipe for more than 10 years! The wife of a Southern Illinois pastor/dairy farmer made it for a Bible study group party, and it was incredible. I've been searching for the recipe for years to no avail, and tried to make it myself only to create a goopy mess. Thanks for the recipe!!!

i had no idea this was how you made caramel. it was excellent caramel. really rich, though.  i think the pie is a  little plain, but this gets 5 stars for showing me how ot make great caramel. just would be better with chocolate worked into the pie or something.

This was decadent and delicious. This is the first pie I ever made and everyone loved it. I used two cans of sweetened condensed milk and cooked on low in slow cooker for eight hours as was suggested by another reviewer. I topped with extra creamy whipped topping and drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce. Perfect!!

If you read a review that says it is runny, they did something wrong! If you read a review that says it is too sweet, then they are likely sensitive to all sweets, because it is not too sweet. I have been making this pie for a few years now, and it turns out perfect every time! I made it for our yearly Bake Off at church, and I won first place!  ** I do use two cans per shell, and boil for the full 4 hours. It is HOT to handle. The cans I use have a pull tab. I turn the tab away from me,  hold the can with a pot holder, cover the can and my hand with a clean towel, and use pliers to pull the tab.

It was a wonderful pie and I will be making this again! I suggest letting the milk rest after you get done with it for a few minutes. I had the perfect consistency after I let it set in the fridge for several hours. Thank you for this recipe!

advice...follow directions people!  this is good if you like, and i mean really like caramel. when you initially pour out the caramel, it is a little soupish but it will not look like that when it's served.  once topped with cool whip, it's beautiful. i gave 5 stars because it's exactly what the recipe says it is and easy to make but i personally thought it was bland and boring.

I used the pre made can of caramel, it took 2 cans to fill one 9 inch pie crust. I heated them a little and hand mixed them before adding to prepared crust. My sister and I always top ours with some semi sweet chocolate chips and pecan pieces, it’s like a huge turtle, it really compliments the richness.

This recipe worked perfectly. You have to make sure to stir the caramel in a bowl after you open the can. I opened the can after 10-15 minutes of letting it cool, so it was still quite hot. I stirred in a bowl until completely smooth, then added to the crust. I used a chocolate crust instead and it is deadly! Only tip is to definitely watch the water–– it evaporates quickly!

Great pie! Very easy just time consuming. I would suggest using 2 cans of condensed milk. One can filled the pie shell about 1/3-1/2 of the way. **be careful when opening the can** my first attempt exploded and Carmel went everywhere- walls, floors, etc. after that, I'd say it was a success.

Pretty good recipe, decent guidelines for beginners, but the condensed milk only needs to be boiled for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, since 4 hours burns the caramel. I give this a 4/5

This recipe is my favorite! I like to make my own whipped cream for it though. It makes a big difference. Super tasty!!

i sprinkle semi-sweet chocolate chips in the bottom of a homemade butter pie crust then add the caramel while it is still warm.  When it is completely cooled and topped with homemade unsweetened whip cream you may serve it and you have a type of chocolate coated pie shell.  It is sweet and salty - perfect.

This pie takes time but it is so easy and delicious when done.  Well worth the preparation time.  I shave some chocolate and caramels on top.  Everyone I have ever made it for asks for the recipe.
