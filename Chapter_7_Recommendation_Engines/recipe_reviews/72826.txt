Delicious! A simple yet elegant sandwich. We didn't have the cranberry in the house so I used some apple preserve to fill in the sweet part. Very satifying. The additional tanginess of the cranberry will make the next sandwiches even better! Can't wait to go get some... thx

This was excellent. I've tried it several times and it is addicting. I had never tried Camembert cheese so this was a first for me and a truely enjoyed it and felt like I was eating in a gourmet sandwich shoppe. I baked mine in the toaster oven rather than in a skillet.

I really liked this sandwich. It is definitely an adult grilled cheese. Neither one of my two little kids liked it. A loud "Yuck" was heard by each. My DH didn't care for it too much either. But I enjoyed it a lot. There is a skin on the cheese that didn't melt and it was a little odd but I thoroughly enjoyed the cranberry on it. I agree with other reviewers who said ham would be great on this. However, I doubt I will buy camembert cheese again just for me. I did enjoy it's mild and creamy flavor and texture. I put it on Triscuits and put them in the microwave for 8 seconds and that was really good too.

I thought this was really good and would have been better with the right ingredients.  I used ciabatta bread.  The store didn't have Cemembert so I used brie.  They didn't have cranberry relish so I used blueberry jam.

This was amazing!  I was a little skeptical, but based on the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I agree that the more rustic the bread used, the better the flavor.  I used a little extra basalmic to offset the sweetness of the cranberry sauce.  I found camembert in my local run-of-the-mill grocery store next to the brie.  Although I love brie and can see it working in this recipe, the camambert's flavor was more mellow and seemed to mesh well with the craberry sauce.  DH doesn't like whole cranberry sauce so I used jellied and it worked fine.

I had never tried Camembert cheese before, but I liked the sound of the recipe.  I did not like the actual sandwich though.  I had a few bites and tossed it.  Now I have $6 worth of cheese.  Wonder what I will do with it!

Terribly incredibly yummy!! Twisted sandwich I really dig. Even my mom wolfed down mine after had one-bit of it, made me have to whip-up another. Will try to lay on smoked chicked next time. The idea seems delish!

This was a very good sandwich, but I'm going to try it without the balsamic next time to see if I can improve the flavor.

Not much going on in this sandwich, but it is good and smelled just as yummy. I was a little afraid of the balsamic vinegar being too strong, so I only put it on one half, and I didn't even notice it.

sorry, we thought the camembert was just too high fat for a sandwich. it was just too rich and the cheese just disappeared--with all the fat separating out into the bread making it greasy. next time we will try fontina or gruyere something strong but meant to melt.

I used a nutty, crusty brown bread and I added red onion.  It's not to everyone's taste but I certainly liked it.
