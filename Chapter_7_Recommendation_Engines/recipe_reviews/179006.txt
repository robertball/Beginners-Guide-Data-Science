This was really tasty and super simple, but I did take it up a notch.  I used leftover diced chicken from a roasted chicken about 2 cups instead of the sauteed chicken breast.  I added 2 cloves of diced garlic instead of garlic powder.  I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/4 cup of milk, no sherry.  I also added a cup of swiss cheese and 1 cup of grated parmesan. I salted the water when I cooked my noodles.  This was really, really delicious with the changes.

Really delicious.  I used cream of chicken soup because I was out of cream of mushroom.  I also sauteed minced garlic instead of using garlic powder.  I didn't have any sherry on hand so I substituted chicken stock.  I didn't have to fight with my kids at all to get them to eat this, and my husband and I loved it too.

very good! I omitted the sherry, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk, and added some chopped sundried tomatoes and fresh garlic. It was exactly what I was wanting. Yum!

Fast and easy, but...this was quite bland even after adding extra onion, garlic, pepper...even chicken bullion to spice it up a bit. Good base recipe but needs much more zing. I had to cover my portion in pepper to make it flavorful and even tried adding some sour cream.

Super easy, super fast.  End result is good - as expected with a canned soup recipe, but anything you can knock out in less than 30 minutes that tastes good is certainly a plus.  I added asparagus as I had some that needed to be used and it was great so I assume you could up the health factor by adding just about any veggie in addition to the mushrooms and onion.

This is a quick and simple dish. We didn't have any sherry, so we added white wine instead -- had a good flavor and nice texture. As there were only two of us, it made ample leftovers. Great as a weeknight meal!

My wife and I both enjoyed this. We didn't find it bland, despite being anchored and/or primed by the other reviews. We did add a little bit of parmesan, but we were out of garlic in any form, so that's a wash. Don't get me wrong, I love a dish that punches you in the face with flavor as much as the next guy, and this wasn't that dish... but it was still a perfectly enjoyable weeknight meal.

hmmm was very excited as the sauce looked & smelled terrific while cooking but as another viewer mentioned, final dish was bland even though I added pepper, red wine (instead of sherry), basil, onions and fresh cloves of garlic. Was ok but I likely won't make again. Will stick to Chicken Marsala.

This is a great recipe and so easy!  I also added parm cheese to the sauce for more flavor.  I will make this again and again.

My husband and I thought this was very good. I cooked the chicken in 2 T. butter. I also cooked 2 cloves of garlic, a jar of sliced mushrooms and the onion in 2 T. butter and omitted the sherry. I cooked the noodles in chicken stock and this meal was very tasty.

Very bland.  I used several cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder but it still lacked flavor.  I don't usually add much salt to my food, but this recipe needed a lot of salt.

Good but not great. We felt it was a little boring. My 2 toddlers did enjoy it though :)

This was quite good! Used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and baby portabella mushrooms. Served it over mashed potatoes. It was a big hit!
