I confess I made this prepared not to like it. I don't like "sweet" in my salad - ever. I only made this as I am leaving town tomorrow and am desperately trying to use things up so as not to waste them. Knowing I don't like anything sweet in either the salad or the dressing, I immediately knew I would eliminate the sugar in the recipe altogether, thinking the honey itself would make this plenty sweet enough.  I was right--it was "just right" sweet.  What I was NOT right about was how I would dislike this--yes, I was wrong!  I'm a convert! This was absolutely delicious!  What a wonderful and tasty surprise! This salad is not only lovely to look at, but the buttery mushiness of the avocado, the sweet tang of the strawberries, the crispness of the greens, the nutty crunch of the pecans and the smooth, slightly sweet honey and lemony goodness of the dressing (I made it a point to get it all in one mouthful) is an extraordinary combination of flavors unlike any I've ever tasted.  You CAN teach an old dog new tricks, and if it wasn't for the fact that I was cleaning out the fridge I would have never known it!

My girlfriend and I went strawberry picking this past weekend and I printed out several recipes from this site.  Being a huge avocado lover and having 11 pounds of freshly picked strawberries, I decided this was one of the dishes I would try.  I have to admit, I've been using this site for years now and this is the recipe that made me register and finally post a review.  All I can say is that this has to be one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  The combination of the Avocado and strawberries was breathtaking. The way the pecan matched perfectly with the dressing and the fruit was perfection.  I listened to some of the other reviewers and halfed the sugar for the dressing, which was plenty sweet.  The only addition I would make would be to add goat cheese.  This is simply a preference but the salad was lacking that tarty goodness that goat cheese brings to the table.  All in all, this recipe was excellant.  My girlfriend ended up making the salad again for her family on Father's day, which everyone loved.

A great summer salad that is very refreshing. The dressing is delicious (sweet and tangy) We added some wasabi powder to it which seemed to enhance the tangyness.

Loved this salad. Used a little less sugar in the dressing the second time around. Threw in some chicken and had a great meal.

This is quite yummy and very healthy too I might add. I used organic strawberries, which are very sweet, and omitted the sugar.

Very good recipe. I added only 1/2 teaspoon of sugar instead of 2 tablespoons. The rest of the dressing ingredients I left the same. With this change, the dressing was just sweet enough and complemented the avocado and strawberries perfectly. I left out the pecans, but that is just because of personal preference.

This salad is sooo yummy!  I made it as is and the flavors combine together wonderfully.  Next time I think I will add some cheese, maybe feta or bleu.  I think it would also be good as a meal with chicken!  Try this, you won't be sorry!!  

Then, I made it again, this time with roasted chicken, blue cheese, and blueberries and it was a delicious dinner salad.  I had to double the dressing in order to accommodate for the extra toppings and it was WONDERFUL!!!

Such a great salad, and so easy.  Used Emerald Pecan Pie Glazed Pecans...wow!
Update:  Found a recipe for Candied Pecans. Rinse 3/4 c pecans in cold water. Drain, but do not dry. Combine 4 tbsp icing sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Coat pecans in the sugar mixture. Spread pecans on baking sheet (spray first). Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.  
Oh, and we left the honey out of the dressing and just added more sugar; left out the avocados and it's now by far our favorite salad recipe.

This was fantastic, and the fact that it was actually healthy is a plus!  I used about teaspoon of truvia instead of sugar and only 2 teaspoons of honey since I don't like things too sweet, used almonds instead of pecans because that's what I had (I love almonds!) and served it over baby spinach.  Great for lunch...will make again...thanks!!

Great salad.  Added very thinly sliced red onions to the salad, and 1Tbsp poppy seeds to the  dressing.  It seems like it doesn't make enough dressing, but it is plenty!  
I agree with the reviewer who said adding goat cheese would make this salad superb! 

Hubby normally hates fruit in his "green" salads, but he loved this.

Very good, and healthy!!  I used spinach instead of lettuce.  I also just used a bit of balsamic vinager for the dressing with a tough of raw sugar.  Very good!!  Highly recomend!

The honey vinagrette dressing is the best! I'll be making this dressing for the rest of my life, I think. I don't really like fruit in my salad, but the strawberry, avocado, and dressing were made the perfect balance. I had walnutes on hand so I used those instead of the pecans... And I love nuts, so I threw some walnut halves (didn't chop them) in the toaster oven for a few minutes... *Edit: One more thing. I used red wine vinegar because I already had it and it still tasted heavenly.

Pretty boring overall, and I would eat ANYTHING with avocados in it. Might eat again, but would add bacon, red onions, and raisins.

Wow...what an amazing salad. I don't do sugar if at all possible and so I used 2T of honey instead and added some poppy seeds (still tasted wonderfully sweet but not too sweet). The creamy Hass avocado along with the sweet tang of the strawberries, and crunchy pecans, all combined together so well. We had some grilled chicken along with this and I ended up mixing it all in one bite with chicken too.

This was a delicious salad with the addition of feta cheese.  I omitted the sugar and it was still too sweet for our taste, so next time I will omit the sugar and only use half the amount of honey and will use agar or cornstarch to thicken.  Lovely recipe!

Delicious and versatile.  I don't use the sugar, just the honey, and I use lime juice and zest instead of lemon juice.  (juice of 1 lime)  I also like to add finely chopped cilantro.  For the salad I usually use Romain lettuce, and I add all sorts of other veggies as well.  (fresh garden peas, peppers, cucumber etc. )  For the crunch, sometimes nuts, sometimes seeds, and sometimes crunchy tortilla strips.  Just depends what's on hand.
This is delicious and light.  Goes very well with bbq chicken or ribs!  Yummy!

Very good salad.  The dressing is very light.  I cut out the sugar entirely and used maybe 2 tsp of honey bc I'm not a huge fan of sweet dressings.  It worked out very nicely, and this salad almost doesn't need a dressing--the sweetness from the strawberries, the richness from the avocado, and the crunchiness from the pecans work well together.  The dressing nicely works with it all.  This is very filling; I couldn't finish, but it was more because I was full than because I didn't like it!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but it seemed to be missing something. Maybe the tartness of feta? I'd try that next time and perhaps candy the pecans before tossing them together. The dressing seemed REALLY unappealing when I tasted it before tossing it together, but somehow the flavors do work after they are all in the bowl.

This salad was amazing!  I brought it to a party and it got rave reviews.  I used lettuce from my garden and strawberries that I had picked the day before - so good!  The only change I made was that I didn't have pecans on hand and I used toasted walnuts instead.  I bet it would taste great with some goat cheese on it like others recommended, although I didn't make it that way.

This was a delicious and easy salad. My husband and I really liked, although the kids didn't care for "strawberries and lettuce mixed together." I won't have too often, though, because it is very high in fat.

I didn't have any pecans so omitted them from the recipe, but everything else was DELICIOUS!!!! A definite keeper.

Surprisingly good combination! I used grapeseed oil and omitted the sugar in the dressing. Used walnuts bbc that's what I had.

I usually add a bit less sugar than it calls for, but other than that, it's perfection! Sooooo good!!!

This was amazing! I didn't change a thing. The dressing was very light and not overbearing like some other dressings with vinegar. I made the recipe using 4 servings of greens but 2 servings of the dressing and it was still great. I will DEFINITELY make again.

I made this salad to go with our Valentine's dinner and thought it was excellent.  It has a unique flavor - different than any other green salad, which was nice especially for my husband who gets sick of eating salad.  I had some Feta Cheese on hand so I threw some of that in and thought it was a nice addition.  Will make this again.  Thanks.

My husband and I have never been avocado lovers but since moving to Costa Rica our new neighbor is always bringing us fresh fruits and vegetables from his farm.  The other day, he brought us 10 avocados so I set out to find something to do with them.   I came across this recipe and just happened to have strawberries and lettuce in the fridge so I thought I’d give it a try and I’m certainly glad I did!  The sweetness of the dressing added a nice flavor to the avocado transforming it from bland and tasteless to heavenly sweet.  The addition of the crisp lettuce, crunchy nuts and fresh strawberries made this dish a great option for lunch or a side salad at dinner.   We loved it and I will be making this again!!

This was really good! I left out the 2 Tbs sugar entirely. It was sweet enough with just the honey! I would suggest leaving the sugar out, then tasting the dressing, and if you feel it needs more for your tastes, adding sugar.

YUM! I can't get enough of this salad - I even save my leftovers and eat it on an english muffin or bagel! I never even use cream cheese anymore, just avoid those calories and use mashed avocado or this recipe! Plus the avocado will keep you feeling full all day!

I omitted the sugar from the dressing and added a bit of extra honey instead - I think it would have been way too sweet otherwise. I also substituted croutons for the pecans, which are pricey.

I too reluctantly tried this recipe, and didn't expect it to turn out that great.  Wow was I wrong!  This salad was a big hit with the hubby as well as my teen age son!  I doubled the recipe and had enough for 4-6 servings.  Delicious!  Try it!  You won't be dissapointed!

This was delicious!  Toasted my pecans and used raspberry blush vinegar because I didn't have cider vinegar.  Added goat cheese and craisins instead of the strawberries. Everyone loved it!

Great recipe.  Instead of using white sugar for the dressing, I used a packet of splenda.  I didn't have any pecans, so I just left it out.

I was doubtful that I would like this salad and my bf isn't too fond of salads either but I made this last night and he scarfed it and said it was "the best salad he's ever tasted" and having tried it last night for the first time as well...I couldn't agree more. Best salad I've ever tasted.

What a delicious and super-simple salad.  I absolutely loved this dressing.  Makes just enough for two servings, perfect for hubby and me.  The combination of flavors is great for summer.  Would be a great pot luck salad in quadrupled amounts.  Thank you for your submission, I enjoyed this very much.

I think i used way more salad greens than it asked for. And i left out the nuts, because we are allergic. But very easy and very tasty. And very sweet.

I'm surprised by how positive this salad's reviews are.  The dressing was too sweet, almost like pouring syrup over my salad.  I didn't hate it, but as written, I wouldn't make this again.  I tried adding feta cheese and then more lemon juice, but although those cut the sweetness, they didn't make this salad as good as I had hoped.  I like the combination of strawberries, lettuce, avocado, and nuts, but the dressing doesn't make the cut.  I probably won't try this again, but if I do, I'll leave the sugar out of the dressing or just use another dressing entirely.  (This review might be sounding too negative - it was a fine salad, and I ate it all, but I just don't think I'll make it again.)

Both attractive and delicious! In the dressing, the sugar was gritty, however.
Next time I'll probably reduce the sugar slightly and perhaps heat the dressing over very low heat to melt the sugar since the grittiness was detracting.

This is delicious recipe... I love sweets and this salad is very, very sweet!  If you're not crazy about sweets, this may not be the salad for you... It's the dressing that makes the recipe, so if you don't have a sweet tooth, I suggest using a lighter, fruity, but not overly sweet dressing.

I loved this salad and the dressing! I've made other salads with greens, berries, pecans and goat cheese but always used a balsamic vinegar dressing! The avocado with the nuts and berries was a great contrast and the honey flavoured dressing complimented it very well! It was visually a very nice salad and I will certainly be making it again! Thanks for sharing!

I couldn't get over the fact that I made this delicious salad with this amazing dressing. I LOVED it and so did my mom. I made it with baby spinach, used 1 tbs of sugar and added some almonds and cashews.

This salad is wonderful! I agree with the other reviewers who suggest eliminating the sugar--the honey adds just the right amount of sweet. I've also added shrimp and/or bacon to this when I want to make a full meal out of it. After the first time, I've just made the dressing by taste. Simple, sweet, delicious. Highly recommended!

Delicious, fresh salad! After reading other reviews, I chose to leave out the sugar and I'm so glad I did. The dressing was excellent, and just a bit sweet, even without the sugar. No pecans on hand, so I used sliced almonds. Very good!

This is a wonderful salad.  I made the recipe as stated but omitted the sugar and found the  dressing was perfect for us without the added sugar.  Also, I forgot to add the pecans but it was still delicious without them.  If you are looking for a tasty and different salad for summer cookouts you should try this.  It’s really, really good.

This was extremely popular with my family! Cut down the white sugar amount by about 75% which was great because then there was just a hint of sweetness. Made a triple batch and there was barely any left over =]

This rocks plain and simple! My only suggestion is, like others said, reduce by half, or eliminate, the sugar. Also, serve this immediately. It's much better served that way.

delicious recipe. Omitted half the sugar. Made pralines and added crumbled goat feta. Don't usually critique a recipe that I've tweaked but this was so tasty when I first made it, I just had to punch it up a bit. TWIMC "Definitely" has no "A" in it. Drives me nuts!

Very tasty salad.  I didn't have cider vinegar, so I subbed rice vinegar.  LOVED the combo of flavors.  Would not recommend making more than you're going to eat right away, as I don't think this would make good leftovers.  Thank you for posting this yummy salad recipe!

This salad was too good.  I had avocados and didn't know what to do with them so made this amazing salad and everyone loved it so much.  It's such a beautiful sald with the red strawberries.  I am going to be making this again and again.  Next time I would cut back on the sugar...too sweet, especially when you add strawberries.

I thought this was good, but the dressing was wicked sweet. I might try a salted pecan to counteract that next time. It did have beautiful colors though!

This is my new favorite salad. Made it last night for some guests and everyone loved it. Based on some of the reviews I cut the sugar in half, and to be honest, I think it would have been just as good without the sugar at all. I also used cashews instead of pecans, since that's what I had on hand. The honey gives it plenty of sweetness. I will be making this again and again!

This salad was great and a hit at my bbq. I added raspberries, blackberried, feta cheese and craisens to it, which made it even more enjoyable. Everyone loved it! Not good the second day though, the dressing makes its super soggy.

This tasted good and was simple and quick to make. I cut the sugar by half and it was more than sweet enough. Next time, I think I might not add sugar at all. Also, I found it a bit too oily, so I may cut the oil in half next time as well. But it tastes yummy. How would it be to add feta to this? Any thoughts from good cooks? (I just know how to follow instructions)

This is hands down the BEST salad I have ever had!! The only thing I changed was doubling the recipe for the dressing and I only used 1 teaspoon of splenda instead of the sugar called for. Sooo good, can't wait to make again. Thanks!!

Delicious!  Also cut back on sugar,  used baby spinach leaves and added 1/2 tsp. poppy seeds.  Was a huge hit at Memorial Day bar-b-que.

I have a very similar recipe but  it calls for candied pecans which are a bit of a nuisance. The dressing method is quick and simple. Definate keeper.

this was excellent. As good as salads in high-end restaurants. The dressing is sweet, but really lovely. I used candied walnuts becase that is what I had in the house. pecans, regular walnuts, sliced almonds all would be excellent. Thank you for this impressive recipe.

Amazing salad! So delicious. I used a baby blend of spinach and romaine. At first bite the vinegar takes precedence, but the flavors mellow and it is all great together. I love the creaminess of the avocado with the rest of the textures. The olive oil made this a little oily, but I think I used too much dressing on mine when I drizzled it is all. Great salad, pretty too. Thanks, this is a keeper!

This salad was amazing. I used maple syrup instead of honey, and it came out nice. I added a little more strawberries for that valentines day flavor. I will absolutely make again.

Made this for company and we ALL had seconds.  Loved the feta-it compliments the strawberries and delicious dressing so well...and it isn't overpowering.  We will definitely make this often this summer.  Thanks for sharing!

Good base recipe for the dressing.  I would add thinly sliced red onion to the salad, a dash of tobasco to the dressing, and would carmelize the pecans.

I was out of cider vinegar and had to substitute red wine vinegar.  This was so simple and so delicious!! We both cleaned our bowls.  We'll defintiely make it again, maybe with some blue cheese on top.  Thank you!

I found this recipe while browsing one day and decided to try it.  My gosh -- it is so good!  It is now a favorite of all my family.  I make it all the time and it always a hit.  I recently made it for a dinner group we are involved in and again, rave reviews -- I ended up sending the recipe home with one of the couples.  Try it -- you won't be disappointed I promise you!

This salad is yummy!  I gave it 4 stars because I think the dressing was a little sweet.  I will definitely try it again, half the sweeteners, and maybe with a little goat cheese or something to give it a slight bite.

I added some Kiwi to the salad.  Next time I'd use a little less sugar, but the flavors were great and the eye appeal was definitely there.

The dressing was a perfect compliment to the strawberries and avocado. Truly a summer dish. Don't be shy and bring this salad to summer parties - your guests will truly enjoy the fresh, sweet flavor. 

I substituted the cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar and it still was delicious.  =)

This was pretty good. The dressing alone was not something I was excited to eat, but it was wonderful with the salad and strawberries. I think next time I will sugar the pecans and decrease the sugar in the dressing.

This is really good. Like a previous review, I didn't add the extra sugar to the dressing. I think blue cheese or feta crumbles would be the perfect addition.

Great just as written and also fun to experiment with different ingredients. I have substituted  with pomegranate, grapes, toasted pecans, smoked almonds, different types of greens etc.  The one thing I keep the same is the avocado and the basic dressing although you can adjust the sweetness to your taste. Thank you for sharing!

Very good!  A little too sweet for me.  I think next time I will add some chicken and subtract some of the sugar.

I have now made this 5 times and it has become one of my signature dishes. After the first bite the resounding response is that this is"my new favorite salad"  I have made it for a little as 2 and as many as 12 and fortunately never have a leftover in site.  I changed it up a little by putting the avocado on just before serving and I throughly mix the salad with the dressing as opposed to a light drizzle. Lastly try Natural Cane Turbinado Sugar instead of white sugar.

Love this recipe for a quick meal on a weeknight or entertaining friends with a glass of wine! The honey vinegarette gives just the right amount of sweetness although I left out the sugar for a healthier option. Also added some blue cheese and toasted the pecans for about 5 mins on 375. Delicious!

Much too sweet of a dressing for our tastes, but basics for a good salad is there. Will make again but probably omit the sugar next time. The honey is probably good enough as a sweetener. (We find candy and soda pop too sweet and generally avoid them; but the natural sweetness of fruits are perfect- just as a reference of where our sweet scale lies.)

Great salad. I wish I would have read the reviews before preparing this because just about every other reviews says the dressing is too sweet. The next time I make this, I will cut the sugar in half. Other than that, a wonderful combination of flavours and textures. My guests loved it. Nice one!

This salad was a huge hit at the dinner party I brought it to.  I used baby spinach instead of the torn salad greens, replaced the honey with agave, and cut down on the sugar by half.  It was delicious and everyone asked for the recipe.

I LOVE this salad.  I could eat it all day, every day.  It's fabulous as is, but because I like to eat it so much, I've started subbing all of the sugar for honey, as some other reviewers have suggested.  It is still just as delicious!  I've also subbed other types of fruit for the strawberries depending on what's on sale or what I have on hand--blueberries are probably my favorite alternative.  Highly recommend!

I was a little bit leery to try mixing strawberries with avocado, but I have to admit that this was a very tasty dish.  I brought it to my monthly cooking club when we had a strawberries theme.  I would make this one again.

We loved this salad.  I changed out the pecans for sunflower seeds since we had those in the pantry.  Next time I make it I'll add either feta or blue cheese crumbles.

This salad is wonderful! My 13 year old daughter's favorite recipe from AR. I always use butter lettuce for my greens and double the salad dressing, but use only a little over 1/2 the olive oil the recipe calls for. This salad is a perfect light summer treat and is also an awesome addition to a fish dinner.

Pretty appearance, easy to make, refreshing salad! I only gave it 4 stars since it was too sweet and the sugar gave it a grainy texture. It will be a 5 star recipe after I eliminate the sugar. This made more than enough for 2 but we ate it all any way since it was so yummy. However if you are having a big dinner you may want to make a bit less since it doesn't seem like it will keep well. Please see my lovely photo :)

This recipe was sweet, light and delicious! I will be making it again! The dressing was a little too sweet for my taste, but I tend to like salty more than sweet. I will add less sugar the next time we make it. Thanks for sharing!

Light and refreshing. Left out the sugar, used agave nectar instead of honey. Toasted the pecans in a skillet for just a few minutes. DELIGHTFUL!

This was SO much better than I thought it would be. I doubled it, but I didn't need all the dressing. It was very refreshing!

Oh my gosh, this salad was so very, very good.  I have already made it 3 times and cannot get enough of it.  I am not big on changing recipes, but I did cut the sugar out of the dressing as another reviewer suggested (I like my dressing a little more tangy) - this did the trick.  I also prefer cheese on my salad so I added some gorgonzola cheese.  The combination of the avocado and strawberries was excellent.  I never would have thought to combine but now I think this is one of my all time favorite salads ever.  Very, very good.

Oh man, oh man was this good!! I followed the recipe exacty but didn't have any pecans. My husband normally doesn't like salads and has never eaten avocados, but he went back for seconds and thirds and all but licked the salad plate clean!! What a refreshing summer time dish! Thank you for such a great recipe!!

Husband didn't care for this salad, but I liked it--thus the 3 stars.  I do recommend that the avocado not be too ripe and use fresh strawberries.

This is surprisingly delicious!  I wouldn't have thought to put this together but will be making it often.  I did omit both the sugar (based on other suggestions) and pecans (based on personal preference).  The dressing was plenty sweet and fabulous!

I love this salad and dressing.  My Husband does not like sweet stuff so I used the honey and did not add the sugar at all and it was still very sweet. You could possibly add more cider vingar and lemon and less honey as I did when I doubled the recipe. Thanks for sharing great summer salad.

It is a very refreshing dish. Make sure to use the Spring Mix greens. I like candied pecans so I altered the recipe a bit. Wonderful taste.   Recommended Candied Nuts recipe - http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Dawns-Candied-Walnuts/Detail.aspx. A great one.

What a treat for the tastebuds. It's very sweet, though, so you may want to cut down on the sugar in the dressing and add more lettuce. I use spring mix.

YUM! I did substitute Splenda for the sugar, and used a little less as I find Splenda to be sweeter than regular sugar.

Like other reviewers' suggested, I cut back the sugar in the dressing to only 1 Tbs.  It was still a bit gritty from the sugar so I popped it in the microwave for 15 seconds or so to dissolve the sugar.  I also added one thick slice of red onion, finely chopped, for some more depth of flavor.  If you are using one bag of salad greens, you might want to double the dressing ingedients.  Also, if your avocado is on the small side, you might want to consider using 2 avocados.  Hubby loved it!

The best salad recipe I've made off this site!  Defintely cut the sugar, per the other reviews.  Really fantastic salad, I served it at a dinner party and everyone got seconds & scraped the bottom of the bowl!

It's also great with a little crumbled feta on top, especially if you skip the walnuts. And the dressing is fantastic -- you can use it on a lot of different salads. A big 'thank you' to whomever posted this recipe -- it rocks!

I used Splenda in place of sugar.  This is an excellent salad.  The dressing is superb!  Thank you for sharing it with us.

This is a great summer salad and would be great for a barbeque on a warm summer night. The only thing that I would alter a little is the dressing.  I found it to be a little too sweet though so next time I will cut back on the sugar or I may just leave it out completely.  I left out the nuts because I am not a huge fan of nuts.

I have made this recipe twice.  The dressing was a hit both times especially with the need for a sweeter dressing to not take away from the addition of the strawberries.  I loved everything on the salad.  I did have complaints about the use of avocado from family who suggested the use of mango instead.  Mango was a good substitution, but I personally preferred the avacodo.

Excellent salad!  My husband loved it!  I might try serving the dressing on the side next time because the salad gets soggy at the bottom and doesn't last overnight.

So I made when we had company.  Big hit!  I thought it was delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't have fresh strawberries, so I used frozen, which weren't great, but still tasted delicious.  Also forgot to add my nuts, which I'll have to do next time.  Still adding it to my salad rotation!

My family has repeatedly asked me to make this since we first tried it last week. I agree with others that it is a bit sweet, but if that's what it takes to get my 8 year olds to request salad, I'll take it!  Easy to make with ingredients usually found in my kitchen.

I saw this salad on a take out menu I was reading.  I realized that I had all of the ingredients on hand so I set out to find a recipe online.  My search led me here.

I needed to use up some strawberries and an avocado and this salad took care of that for me.  I even had a small amount of candied pecans that I had no idea what I was going to do with.

I skipped the sugar all together but used the honey and it was plenty sweet.  I will probably cut that back a bit next time because the strawberries were sweet on their own.  The candied pecans lent even more sweetness to it, but I was just using them up and never buy them.  They came in a gift basket and had been hanging around  in my fridge.

Allrecipes always has the best recipes.  I love this site and I love this recipe.

The description in the take out menu mentioned thinly sliced red onion so I might have to give that a try next time as well.

WAY to sweet.  I dropped the sugar and only used the honey and added mustard and more EVOO, salt, pepper and some cilantro.  Much better.

Delicious.  Brought to a friends bbq.  Loved by all. I too omitted the sugar in the dressing and added some feta.  Nothing left.  Dressing was delicious plenty sweet without the sugar

I put this on fresh spinach for a nutrition pop and milder flavor. Absolutely DELICIOUS salad for summer. Everyone at the table loved it, even my picky eater. I'll make it many times.

I chose to use less sugar In the dressing, and will probably get rid of it all together next time. I also didn’t have pecans on hand so I replaced them with crushed walnuts. It turned out great.

I made it this evening, and although the presentation was nice, the dressing made the salad way too sweet. We had increased the cider vinegar, but I don't feel that the ratio of acids to sweets (sugar, honey) was not proportional.

People who know me know that I like things sweet, but...even without the sugar--IT IS SWEET!  So, do not add the sugar until you taste it otherwise, you may need to throw it out.  Otherwise, it is a good combo of flavors!

I needed a recipe for a salad to use up my avocado and decided to give this a try.  Wow! Delicious and my husband really loved it too.  I liked the dressing and didn't find it too sweet although I cut back a bit on the sugar as some recommended.  I made twice the amount of dressing and it was just right..

*Sort of* thought the avocados and strawberries would go together... and WOW, did they ever!  I was looking for a light summer salad recipe for some family coming to visit, and this salad was a HUGE success, despite this particular family not being fans of "sweet" salad dressing.  I only used half the amount of dressing required, and upon reading others' comments-- next time I might try just using half the sugar.  I can imagine that adding a little goat cheese would make this salad a 6-star.  Yummmm!

I omitted the sugar as other reviewers and salad was great. Honey provides plenty of sweetness. I made a large batch and served to friends who gobbled it up. Recommend adding avocado at the very end. Will be using this dressing a lot. Thanks for the recipe!

The dressing was a bit sweeter than I would have liked it, but I added some s&p and that helped. I think next time I'd stick with a balsamic vinegar dressing instead.

Good flavors &  balance of textures. I also added radishes, carrots, cucumber, sun dried tomatoes (which added a smoky flavor), gorgonzola and a Romaine & cabbage mix. It was a hit at our family Sunday dinner. It's a good summer salad. Delicious.

Loved the salad.  I personally prefer not to use sugar when possible, so used only the honey called for.  Added a little mustard for the same reason, though the dressing was good without it.  Do yourself a favor and toast the pecans.

I halved the sugar & honey and it was still a bit sweet to me.  But all in all, this was very good.  I used baby spinach, Splenda granules and walnuts and it came out beautiful and very tasty.

Fab combo of colors and flavors!    Like many others, I reduced the sugar significantly.   With ripe & extremely sweet berries, I actually omit the sugar.    Many friends enjoy the addition of goat cheese.

This Salad was Awesome!! I did leave out the sugar and added salt and white pepper to taste,  just because I don't like very sweet things.  I added very thin sliced red onion, I toasted the chopped pecans and used a little feta cheese crumbles.  I put  it  all over sweet butter lettuce and red leaf lettuce.  I brought it to a family reunion and there was nothing left.
Thank you for the wonderful summer salad!

Made it exactly as directed and it was delicious. The dressing was perfect and I plan on using it in other recipes. The strawberries, avocados and pecans complimented each other wonderfully.

This is such a refreshing salad! You won't want to stop eating it. The dressing is perfect too...I absolutely loved it.  The only thing I did differently was add an extra avocado and I think next time I'll add more walnuts too.

I've always been skeptical of fruit in salad but this was amazing!  Even my children enjoyed it and they don't eat salads. I will be making this again and often!

This was wonderful!  I did add goat cheese crumbles to the salad every  time.  I used pecans several times and then changed to walnuts pieces a couple times just to add a change. I added some kale to the salad greens a couple to add another flavor and enrich the vitamins.  The salad combination and the dressing were just great.  I loved the dressing and will probably keep that recipe to use instead of buying one because so many have fructose for the first or second ingredient.  I did cut down a little on the sugar.
Wonderful, healthy salad!

A big hit at our Easter dinner.  I had all of the vegetables and dressing ready, but cut up the avocado just before tossing and serving.  I didn't  add sugar to the dressing, just honey. Added fresh lime juice instead of lemon. Requests for the recipe.

Delicious salad.  You can use less sugar.  I toasted the pecans, which added a lot of flavor.  To meld the flavors, I made the dressing ahead of time, but served it separately.

This was good. Didn't add sugar, already sweet enough.  Added some digon as well. In the salad portion, I added red onions, blueberries, raspberries, and chevre.

I give it a four because as written I think the sweetness is overpowering.  Otherwise, the recipe is wonderful.  However, I never stick to a recipe exactly as it is written, so here were my changes:

I used 1 tsp of honey and 1 tsp of organic coconut palm sugar (lower glycemic) in place of all of the sugar/honey listed.  I also eliminated the lemon juice (I didn't have any on-hand) and added 1/2 tsp of prepared mustard so that the dressing would emulsify.  You can really play around with the ingredients a lot.  I used plain almonds instead of pecans (didn't have those on-hand either) and I also added a cored, seeded and cut up yellow delicious apple.  The avocado is a MUST.  You can really use any salad greens you have.  I prefer Romaine lettuce, but really anything goes here.  If you are sticking with arugula, you might wish to keep the sweetness factor a little higher than I've posted.  Got rave reviews from the family!  Thanks for the idea!

We didn't refrigerate prior to serving & it was just fine so maybe had we let the flavors blend together it might've been even better.  I didn't have any torn greens so used spinach otherwise everything was as called for. I can't believe I've had this recipe in my box since 2007 & hadn't tried it.  Will make again that is for sure.

Delicious! Like some other reviewers, I left the sugar out, using only the honey as a sweetener. I made a quadruple batch, which was quickly gobbled up at the dinner party I attended.

I had everything but the pecans for this one. It was very good, different but very tasty! One thing I thought I would do different is not add so much of the dressing all at once. It was a little too "drippy" or too much dressing.

My SO went back for thirds! He is not a greens eater, so I was thrilled to see it. Didn't have the pecans, but I threw in some chunked feta. Wonderful! Served it with a crabcake and lobster tail for a Greek Lenten dish.

Yummy!  We added grilled chicken to make a complete meal, but it would have been great without chicken, too.  We also used walnuts instead of pecans just because that's what we had.  I took off one star only because the dressing, though delicious, did mask the flavors of the strawberries and avocado just a bit.

Top notch!  I made it for my wife for Valentine's Day, and she couldn't stop raving.  And it's so easy to make!

Now I make it whenever we want to knock the socks off of our guests.

Wow, what a simple and wonderful recipe! I sliced my strawberries thinly, and also added cubed Roma tomatoes, and red onion. Alos, I used cinnamon-sugar toasted almonds instead of pecans. The only thing was that the dressing was a little too sweet for some tastes. Since there is honey in it too, half or even 3/4 of the sugar called for can be used. Delightful.

YUMMY!  I made this as a starter for our Easter diner and everone LOVED it!
I substitued the pecans for pine nuts and used baby spinach as my greens.  It's a keeper.

I tried this one on Valentine's night for the first time & it was wonderful! I roasted the pecnas in a cast iron skillet for a little extra flavor,and my husband had 2 helpings before digging into the main course. We'll have it as a filler w/grilled chicken early Easter afternoon and save the big meal for later that evening.

This is as good as it sounds. Not really amazing, but very tasty and very healthy. We had this fruit and sauce over spring-mix, but we think it would taste better over spinach.

I was afraid this was too sweet but when drizzled and then refrigerated it came out great.  You don't need much of the dressing on it otherwise it is too sweet.  I will make this again!

I thought this sounded a little strange, but wanted to try something different so I made it.  First of all I read others suggestions so I left out a little sugar, other then that it was wonderful. My Dad who is negative about everything loved it and asked if I would make it for the next family party.  It was great!

Loved it!! My husband was afraid of eating the avacado's but was pleasantly surprised. I didn't have lemon juice so I used a mixture of lime and orange juice. Yummy!I'll definately be making this again. And it's pretty enough for a holiday table.

This is one of the best salads I have ever made. The dressing is perfect for any summer get together, and the avocados give it a "creamy" texture. I get asked to bring this to almost every family gathering!

I made this tonight for 6 people and 3 of them liked it, 2 said it was okay, and 1 definitely did not enjoy it.  I went straight off the recipe and I will probably try it 1 more time with a few tweaks before making a final decision.

This salad was wonderful!  I did make a few changes though -- I added a couple chopped tomatoes and also some blue cheese.  It is wonderful for a work party or a picnic -- I get requests for this dish all the time!

This had a new twist so I thought I would try it. It was great! I think that nuts, sweet fruit, and cheese are a beautiful conbination.

This was refreshing but it lacked something. Maybe I'll add some crumbled blue cheese next time.

I just tried this salad and it was incredibly good.  So good in fact that my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing in one sitting.  That was the first time that ever happened with a salad.  I did make the substitution of using balsamic vinegar and only used one tablespoon of sugar.  What a delicious meal.  Next time I plan on using spinach instead of lettuce.  This salad is a definite must try for anyone considering it.

Made this salad for a school picnic and it was quickly gone! Very yummy! Sweet taste which I loved. Great salad for summer. I will definitely add this to one of my favorites.

This was a really tasty salad.  I made it without pecans, since my boyfriend is allergic to nuts.  It's a very refreshing salad that is perfect for summer!

Fantastic!  I added a sprinkle of blue cheese crumbles.  Next time I'll add a little less sugar.

Ohhh this was good. The dressing was wayyy too sweet for me, even though I added less sugar and honey. It really does compliment the strawberries in the salad though.
