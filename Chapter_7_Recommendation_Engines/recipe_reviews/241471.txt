These are not only easy, they are delicious and beautiful. I piped mine with a large star tip and made them into Christmas trees. Can't wait to share these! While I LOVE the coffee flavor, I can see making a couple different varieties to set out at Christmas gatherings. Perhaps tinted green and flavored with a bit of mint extract. May try that tomorrow. These take so little work- just spend 10 minutes then go wrap presents or watch a movie. Shaped as trees I could see these as part of a gingerbread house's yard-with white chocolate on them for snow (which is much more finicky to melt- has to be done low and slow unless you buy that almond bark, which wouldn't taste as good). Everyone would fight over the trees for sure! Just one note- mine whipped to soft, and then to stiff peeks faster than the recipe indicated. Make sure not to over whip- it can happen in as little as a few seconds. Thanks for the best meringue recipe I have ever made or eaten!*****just made these again, but shaped them smaller, like the star shape suggested. I had a harder time dipping them in the chocolate neatly. I much prefer the taller "tree" shape.

Love this recipe.  Very easy to make, even though the baking time is quite long. I actually used powdered sugar because I was out of granulatedsugar.  Everyone that ate them said it reminded them of malted milk ball candy.
