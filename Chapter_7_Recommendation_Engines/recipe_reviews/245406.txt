I have indeed made this recipe and it was quite delicious as written.  The second time I made it, I added about a dozen julienned baby carrots for color and omitted the sugar altogether, as the carrots imparted the sweet balance.  Thank you for sharing your wonderful recipe!

The first time I made it the only thing I changes was the sugar.  Instead of white sugar I drizzled about a teaspoon on honey in at the end to make it Paleo.  The next time I made it I sauteed a half of chopped onion with the bacon and caramelized at and added a minced garlic clove at the end.  The first time was 5 stars, the 2nd time I hit it out of the park.  This is a keeper.

Yum, yum! These were simple to make and full of flavor! I only used 2 teaspoons of sugar instead of 2 tablespoons and that was the perfect amount of sweetness for me.  The house smelled so good while making these. This would be an impressive side dish for Thanksgiving! Thank you Brandi for the recipe!

hands down the best way to eat Brussels sprouts.  I've been making it this way for years, without a recipe.  However, I don't use bacon (or the grease to fry in) or sugar.  I saute in olive oil.  Adding fresh mushrooms to the mix and lightly sauteing them is also delicious.

I've been making brussel sprouts like this for decades only I never add sugar. I caramelize the onions, so that adds enough sweetness. If the sprouts are large, I will add a bit of chicken broth and steam them in order to softened them quicker and I toss the bacon in for the last minute or so to blend the flavors. Be sure to taste them before adding the salt to taste, sometimes the bacon will give you enough salt.

The last time I ate Brussels Sprouts was when I was a child and that (horrible) memory has stayed with me.  However, I know my palette has changed as I have matured.  So I thought, why not give them a try?  I like cabbage...  My husband and I really liked this recipe.  The bacon and onions give it some additional flavor and the taste definitely doesn't resemble the bitterness of my childhood memory.  I also like the addition of the sugar which adds a hint of sweetness, although I used maybe two teaspoons instead of the  two tablespoons.  I too added garlic.  This recipe is a winner!  I can now stop badmouthing Brussels Sprouts. :)

This recipe is amazing, this is my go to recipe in lieu of the sugar I add 2 tablespoons of white wine, preferably Riesling... which is a sweet wine.  After you've sautéed the sprouts for a few minutes add the wine, cover and simmer for 2-3 minutes.... Yummo!

We really love this recipe though I usually replace the sugar with a turn of honey in the pan, toss with toasted pine nuts and add a sprinkling of diced green onions at the end.  Pure decadence!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to cook the bacon medium rare first and drain the grease and remove the bacon to a paper towel lined plate. I then added 1/2 a small chopped onion and a spoon full of chopped fresh garlic to 2 Tbsp reserved bacon grease. After the onion/garlic cooked for about 3 minutes, I added the sliced Brussels sprouts and sauteed for 5 minutes. I then added the chopped bacon back to the pan and drizzled some white wine ,(because I didn't use all the bacon grease) & 1/2 tsp sugar ( I do think the sugar added something),  (2-3 Tbsp wine , you can never have enough) as another reviewer added, to keep everything steaming,and salt & pepper, for another 5-8 minutes until fork tender. Excellent taste and not so greasy!
Hubby said " I love Brussels sprouts!"(In case you were wondering, I served with Montreal rubbed pork loin, (roasted) and southwestern ranch dressed salad with kale and spinach).

This is a good recipe for sprouts.  It's not high on the health chart, but the flavor is good.  If you can't tell by looking at the photo, slice the sprouts into the same thickness you would maybe slice carrots.  If you just slice them in half you won't get as much flavor.

The best brussel sprouts can get... from someone who's not a fan. Add sugar and bacon? It would probably make a shoe taste good.

I had 1# of Brussels Sprouts on hand to use with the bacon and onion.  I used turkey bacon to minimize calories.  I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth to moisten the extra Brussels Sprouts.

Bacon should be diced, not in bite sized pieces.  Using half the bacon recommended is fine but add a bit of EVOO when sautéing the onion.  Dice a whole onion as it adds a lot to the recipe.  Use a splash of white wine to deglaze the pan.  Skip the sugar as it just isn't necessary.  Perhaps the onion made it sweet enough.  

I am planning to make this for Thanksgiving so to experiment, I prepared ahead of time and reheated in the microwave.  It was perfect.

Before discovering this super easy recipe, I've NEVER eaten Brussels sprouts--so this was a bold move for me to try this ( done per directions ).  LOVED IT!!  Worth the extra effort to thinly slice the sprouts.  About my only change was I cooked the sprouts a bit longer, getting that nice semi-crunch that paired beautifully with whispers of caramelized onions and BACON!! ; otherwise--it looks exactly like the dish pictured.

I made this one evening when I knew my teenage son would not be home for dinner.  My sister and I loved the taste but we had some leftover.  My son came home late, warmed the leftover and asked for more!  "Best greens you ever cooked Mom!  What kind of veggie was that?" You just never know

After reading the reviews, I added carrots in place of the sugar (mostly because I already had them and needed to cook them). It was fabulous. Will add more carrots next time. Also doubled the bacon because you can't have too much bacon!

This was great! I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar.  It was great... could probably do without the sugar, however the grease makes this completely unhealthy, so might as well throw the sugar in - lol

Was not a huge fan of this recipe. For the amount of effort involved I was hoping for more flavor where as this turned out kind of boring. Adding balsamic helped but as written this was not a house favorite.

Loved this recipe. Because my printer was broken, I tried to memorize the recipe. It wasn't until after we had finished dinner that I remembered I had forgotten to add the sugar. Honestly, my husband and I decided it was perfect without it..

It turned out very good. Only problem was the onions were over cooked. Next time I'll only give the onion a 1 -2 minute head start, not the 5 they recommend.

I made two pounds of sprouts for Thanksgiving, and there weren't any leftovers.  My S-I-L said "you rock, Gramma!", and was sad at clean-up time that the sprout dish was empty!  Great recipe.

Delicious! I only made a few adjustments: I did not add any sugar or salt (plenty of salt from the bacon) and at the end, put sharp shredded cheese on top. This is a keeper!

Turned out terrific.  Prepared in my cast iron pan.  I did not have bacon, but I did have bacon grease so the flavor was still achieved (bacon pieces would have been yummy though!). I also added a tablespoon of maple flavored siracha.  Some people mentioned that they omitted the sugar so I tried it without, then added it.  It is a small amount of sugar and it helps soften the flavor a bit.  I will definitely make again!

Tasted great! Will make it again, my wife and skeptical, "I don't eat that!", cousin even liked it. If pairing it with a salad, no ranch dressing. It affects the tastes, not in a good way.

Delicious!! These are a frequently requested side dish in my household--even by my 2 & 4 yr olds. I omit the sugar. I just throw everything into the pan at once with a dash of olive oil and cook it all at the same time. Sometimes I sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top before serving. Super yummy recipe!

I am not a brussel sprout fan. Everything tastes better with bacon!!!! This recipe is Delicious. I will now eat brussel sprouts (made this way). I did change one thing in the recipe, I used less sugar then the recipe called for. I can't tell you exactly how much I used, I just sprinkled a little in, then tasted, then sprinkled a little more and tasted again, then it was just right for me. This recipe is a keeper!!

Brussel sprouts are not my favourite food but they were purchased so I decided to find a recipe!  I am now a lover of brussel sprouts.  I  followed  the recipe exactly as written except for reducing the amount of sugar and they were great and liked by everyone in the family.

9-9-2020 ~Brussels sprouts with bacon is always a winner.  Come to think of it, anything with bacon is always a winner.  I added fresh minced garlic and skipped the sugar and it was just to my liking.  Buying the Brussels sprouts already conveniently trimmed and sliced (don’t forget to wash ‘em!) was to my liking too.

This recipe is delicious  ! 
Only thing i changed was the bacon , I actually used Turkey bacon because i already had it,  and i added some oil while sauteing the Brussels because the turkey bacon doesn't have much fat . It came out amazing !
Highly recommend this recipe .
Thank you for sharing it

Very good and easy. Added ~ 1/2+ cup of shallots and left sugar out. Once the Brussels sprouts were cooked, added the bacon in and topped with parmesan flakes and allowed to melt over top

I made mine with minced garlic, omitted the sugar, but thought it lacked flavor, so I added "Tastefully Simple" Garlic stir fry sauce, which gave it some sweetness. Mighty tasty!

I never cared much for Brussels sprouts, but have recently learned to like them, especially cooked this way. I usually leave out the sugar, but hit them with a splash of vinegar or lemon juice at the end.

This recipe is soooo good. I kinda thought the bacon grease would be enough for saltiness, but it wasn't so I just sprinkle on a little pink Himalayan salt right before serving and that does the flavor trick. Perfection!

The family loved it! Made it just as described. Wouldn’t change a thing. My 20 year old said, ”Brussel Sprouts, really?” She loved it. She said it really surprised her how good it was.

I made these using 3 thick pieces of bacon and cut the Brussels sprouts in half, skipping the sugar.  Overall they were pretty good considering that I have never really liked Brussels sprouts.  To me they were a little to crisp, even after cooking for 20-25 minutes.  I prefer my veges on the softer side.

OMG! I've made this before, but forgot to leave my review.  The only thing I did different was I added a little chicken broth near the end. 

Once we sat down the eat, it got a little mixed in with my rice and it was amazing! (Yes, I made awesome rice. Nothing plain about it).

Maybe I should have used the sugar because these weren't as good as I was expecting and I love Brussels sprouts. I did use turkey bacon so I that forced me to use olive oil instead of using the bacon grease to cook them in because there was hardly any grease.

Super easy to make!  I did not add bacon to mine because I did not have any at the moment.  But I did have a jar of bacon grease (I save bacon grease in a jar to use when I refry beans...so bad yet so GOOD).  So I fried the onions and sprouts in the bacon grease and it tasted really yummy.  Went great with the chicken drumsticks that I baked.

Excellent recipe but I ditched 1/2 the sugar and added craisons. Off heat add fresh parmesian cheese and skip the salt. There is plenty with the bacon & cheese.??

We liked it, but, I made the mistake of following a review of another member. I added chicken brother sonthst they wouldn't be too crunchy. It made them totally mushy, -without the crunchy sear I was hoping for. They were still good, but next time, I'll cut them into quarters and slip the chicken broth!

I rated this a 5 because my kids said to.  They were crazy about it!
BUT, that's because I added minced fresh garlic to the pan at the same time as the sprouts.  And more than half an onion.   And some fresh mushrooms I needed to get rid of.  May try red pepper flakes next time.
Either way, it's a keeper!

Loved it. Was hesitate to add the sugar but I did and it really adds a nice extra flavor. I used brown sugar. Way to make something healthy a little less so, but delish....

Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!! I never ate Brussels sprouts because the best I can remember they were so yuck, but with so many good reviews I had to try this. I didn't use bacon, just olive oil and I can't imagine it tasting any better.

I sautéed mushrooms using white wine and stirred them into the mix. I did not use sugar of any kind. It came out great! The next day I added grilled chicken to the leftovers. Again. Turned out great. I plan on making this again soon for a family night.

Great and simple dish.  Be careful not to cook the onions too long before adding the brussel sprouts.  I also added minced garlic right before incorporating the bacon back in at the end.  I left out the sugar as a personal preference but I bet this would add great flavor.

I've made this with the bacon/bacon grease and don't get me wrong, it's fabulous, but if you want to healthy it up, this dish is also delicious sans bacon, using olive oil and reduced sugar.  The key is to char the brussel sprouts a bit.  Love this recipe.

I didn't use the sugar, we like cabbage and saurkraut, so didn't think it necessary.  I don't think it needs the extra calories. 
The second time I made this for my family reunion I doubled it...they were GONE!  I didn't get to bring any home. Good, yet sad no left overs.

This was a great recipe.  I don't like Brussel Sprouts and actually enjoyed this...the first day.  Not so much the leftovers.  I did not use the sugar and it was fine.  I assume it is there because the bitterness of  Brussel Sprouts as a rule but the bacon took care of that.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't use bacon as I had to make  it suitable for vegans so I used olive oil instead.  I used onions as directed and also added one  chopped shallot when the sprouts were almost finished as shallots take no time at all to cook.

I agree with one reviewer who added carrots in lieu of sugar.  I will make this again.  I'll probably add a garlic clove next time.  My daughter wants me to add truffle oil.

This recipe tastes great, especially for someone like me who rarely eats brussel sprouts.  However, I would ensure the sprouts are cut in uniform pieces to insure even cooking.  Also I needed to saute at least 10 minutes to have slightly crunchy sprouts.

I took the onion out of the pan after 5 mins. and cooked the sprouts separately . Did not use the full bacon grease along the way.  Cooked the sprouts for double the time and got it nice and browned.  Didn't see another comment until too late b.c next time I will make with fresh garlic. Instead I used garlic powder, and just a sprinkling of the sugar and S&P.

Used turkey bacon. Had to add a bit of olive oil to cook the onions and Brussels sprouts. It was great! My husband ate a vegetable??

This was a disappointment.  I needed to add extra oil since the brussel sprouts started to burn before they were tender.  It also didn't have the kind of big flavor I was expecting. I love brussel sprouts so it was ok, but certainly not good enough to make again.

Pretty good.  Easy, but I had to cover the pan and cook a little longer as my brussel sprouts were quite large and per the time recommended they would have been hard and raw in the middle.

This was tasty! I only had precooked bacon (which isn't crispy emough for us) which I left it in the pan while cooking the onions. There wasn't enough bacon grease to coat the sprouts so I added 3 Tbs butter. And 1 tsp sugar. Also threw in a few chili pepper flakes. Yummy!

This is delectable. I think I will use this as my side dish for Thanksgiving. My 10-year-old eats just about 20 items in the world, and is very picky. She loved it. I did add a little bit more bacon, though.

Added diced bell pepper and garlic and cooked for two minutes before adding Brussels sprouts.  When sprouts just started turning brown, turned heat to low and added thick sliced pepper jack cheese.  Covered and heated until cheese melted.  Got rave reviews!

When we were forced to eat Brussel Sprouts by Mum when a kid, I was dubious. But thought I'd give it a go. First time I followed the recipe, but second time cored the top off the Brussel Sprouts and placed the bacon pieces inside, then replacing the top of the cored Brussel Sprouts. Forget the sugar as not needed,

I've made this a few times now and the hubby and I love it!  Only thing I've added is Chicken Broth to help soften the sprouts and then let it reduce down.  Oh, and I don't use the sugar.

I was not a fan of Brussel sprouts but my husband loves them. Up until I found this recipe he would make himself the frozen ones.  This recipe has changed my opinion totally. I look forward to cooking and eat fresh sprouts now. The only change I made was I added just a little garlic.

this is a good recipe as Wally World and other places sell bags of pre-sliced brussel sprouts - we follow the recipe, but we don't add sugar and instead add chopped pecans and a Tbsp of real maple syrup - the brussels sprouts do stink up the house, though!

I will try this again and will cook the sprouts a little longer. They were too crisp for me.  Next time I will fry the sprouts first then add the onions which cook up faster than the sprouts. I omitted the sugar.  Thanks Brandi

My husband LOVED it! We had a steak dinner with this as one of the sides and Spinach Orzo. He thought the sides were much better than the steaks. I will cut the sugar in half. I felt guilty putting sugar on my veggies, but it really balanced the tartness of the brussel sprouts. I am definitely doing this one again.

I made this last week and it came out good.  I used Italian Bacon because it comes cubed and has a great taste.  I also only used 1 teaspoon of sugar and added some white cooking wine in an effort to cut down on the fats and my family prefers a more well cooked Brussels sprout  when I can get them to eat them.  To my surprise, everything was gone without any complaints about the Brussels sprouts so it was a big MISSION ACCOMPLISHED for me!

The key to this is using the bacon drippings to cook the Brussels sprouts. Be careful not to overlook them as that is what makes them bitter. I have converted a number of previous sprout haters with this recipe. I've never added the sugar. Doesn't need it!!

Excellent!!  Adding a splash of white wine at the end really gave it a 'fresh' taste.

The only thing I added was fresh mushrooms in with the onions.  I will make this over and over again, great recipe!

I made this with shaved brussel sprouts and it was divine.   I didn't add the sugar, just salt & pepper.    I cooked the sprouts until they were very dark, turning often.   It brings out the sweetness.     I make these every week or so and always make extra so we'll have leftovers.

I made this exactly as written and we did enjoy it and will be making it again with some improvements. I will cut back on the sugar to less than half, adding a couple cloves of minced garlic would be a nice addition. I will also just pre boil the sprouts a bit to soften them up quicker as it took longer to cook than what the recipe suggested. My dish didn't turn out as pretty as the pic, the sprouts tended to turn more brown as I was pan frying them.

This is delicious. Of course lots of things cooked in bacon grease is. I really liked this. I may try turkey bacon next time... however I don't think the turkey bacon will give you enough grease to cook the Brussels sprouts. You would then need to add chicken stock like another recipe uses.

Instead of pork bacon; I cooked turkey bacon.  Turkey bacon doesn't have too much grease so I used a tablespoon olive oil to sauté.  I bought mini Brussels sprouts.

The is a tasty dish.  I made the recipe as written.  I will make this recipe in the future, but I may not use all of the bacon grease since there seems to be more of the grease than I needed for the amount of Brussels sprouts that I cooked.

Very good recipe. I did take the suggestions of another reviewer and added a clove of minced garlic and a little honey in place of the sugar.  Also I cooked the sprouts for a little longer than the recipe suggested, more like 10 - 15 minutes.
Al in all a very good recipe; I will make it again.

I will make it again, as it was very easy and tasty.  I put one tablespoon of sugar in and that was a little too much.  I can't imagine doing a second tablespoon.  I'll separate it next time and try some with and without.

Also, I don't pan fry bacon much anymore and mine was done way faster than the estimated 10 minutes, more like 5.  So I recommend watching that closely.
