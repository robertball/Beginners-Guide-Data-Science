These taste and have a texture like a wonderfully nutty whole wheat roll. They are rather small if you divide the recipe into 6 pieces, but they are filling. If you want full size hamburger buns I would divide the recipe into 4. Fantastic!

Made exactly as written. At 24 minutes, the buns were still slightly undercooked inside. Otherwise, this recipe is quite nice.
