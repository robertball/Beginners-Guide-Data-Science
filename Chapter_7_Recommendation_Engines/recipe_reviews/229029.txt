I love/hate this cake, which I’ll have to call my Ugly Duckling Cake.  The instructions for assembly just didn’t work for me – nor did my alternative, tho’ I believe it’s the better of the two options.  The common problem with both methods is that there’s just not enough batter to divide in half and “spread.”  If you “spread” enough batter to cover the bottom there’s not NEARLY enough to “spread” on the top.  I added the blueberries to the batter rather than in two layers, and it would have been an even bigger nightmare to “spread” had I not.  As I tried to “spread” the second half of the batter, the batter took the topping WITH the offset spatula.  I tried my best I but I nearly pitched the whole thing in sheer frustration and disappointment.  But I figured I had nothing more to lose except the cost of the electricity to bake this mess. Topping it with the remaining cinnamon mixture camouflaged the disaster underneath, but I was anxious to see what it looked like inside.  It took longer to bake than indicated, and now I’m calling this a complete and total failure.  I let it cool, cut into the slightly overbrowned topping, carelessly plopped a piece of the cake onto a plate and tasted…. it was heaven.  Moist, buttery rich, with a sweet and flavorful, cinnamony topping.  No, I’m not throwing this out.  No way. It might not meet my standards in terms of prettiness for Hubs to take to a meeting tomorrow as planned, but we’ll enjoy every crumb of this difficult and ugly cake.

For everyone who had trouble getting it to spread out and look pretty:
I read the reviews for this beforehand, so I knew what to expect when layering the coffee cake, and I took a risk. I added about a tablespoon of milk to the 2nd half of the cake batter after spreading the first down, and that thinned it out just enough to spread out easily without affecting the way it baked. 
This was an excellent coffee cake! Rich, buttery, nice texture, definitely an A+.

Sooo good! Definitely going to make this again!  When spreading the batter and layers, there was a point where I thought the recipe didn't make enough batter for the pan, but I decided to trust the recipe and it turned out great!  "Spreading" the batter after putting the layer of berries and sugar/butter crumbs was a little tricky...but it turns out fantastic!  I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream; more nutritious and less fat.  Definitely recommend this recipe!

I like homemade blueberry muffins, but rarely eat fresh blueberries (tart texture). Anyway before I made this I reviewed the comments and agree it would have been a challenge to divide the batter and spread the top layer. So, I made the batter then folded the blueberries into it. Then I put the crumble topping on top before baking (I should have halved the topping bc it was a bit thick and crunchy). It was also easy to make. I made this for my fellowship meeting tomorrow and HAD to try it first. I loved it. The cake was so moist and the blueberries were delicious. It was like eating a fluffy blueberry streusel muffin. Brilliant!

This cake is delicious, but allow me to make a suggestion that will make your life a lot easier if you enjoy this cake.  Don't bother dividing the batter.  Just pour the batter into the pan.  Spread it.  Add the blueberries.  Add the topping.  Bake!  It's beautiful, and delicious and not a difficult to prepare hot mess.

This is a very delicious coffee cake. I read the reviews about the batter being hard to halve and spread. What I did was drop big spoonfuls of batter in the bottom of the greased pan, then bring the globs of batter together. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of how to halve the batter in the pan. I did the exact same thing with the other half of the batter. I had no problems with it being done this way. I took off one star because this took an hour and twenty-five minutes to bake. At the one hour mark, it wasn't baked in the center. When this had cooled slightly, it was moist, rich and buttery tasting. This really is a great and easy recipe that I will be making again.

This is the best Blueberry Cake recipes I have ever made and tasted!  I didn't have any issues with making the layers, I simply plopped the blueberries on top of the first layer of batter, creating a deep ribbon of blueberry in the middle and did the same with the remaining batter.  It doesn't have to be a smooth layer, there is baking powder in the mix, and it helps puff up the batter and topping.  I added a little bit of nutmeg and mace, as these are alway my fav spices with cinnamon.  Don't be put off by the reviews...this is a keeper!
I just made it again tonight, with some extra blueberries, and subbed part of the sour cream for vanilla yogurt.  Creamy and rich, and a little less fat.  I would like to tweak this recipe to get the fat and calories down,  maybe next time!

I have to agree that it is slightly tricky to divide the batter when making this recipe.  When it comes to the second layer of batter, I put dollups of batter over the area, and then spread it.  It seemed to work.  After placing all the ingredients in the 9 x 13, I baked the coffee cake for 45 to 50 minutes and when I was pulling it out of the oven, it was still jiggling in the middle so I knew it wasn't done.  I had to bake this cake over an hour and maybe 10 minutes more to get it done!  I brought it to work and they loved it.  It is very moist and yummy.  I may make it again.

I Use an 8x8x2” (brownie pan) or standard 9” round or a bundt mold.  This way they all ensure there is enough batter for both layers as well as for the better height of cake after it is baked.  I use double the berries, coating in flour so they do not sink, and almonds in lieu of pecans. Also I love the creamy texture by using homemade creme fraîche (takes 1-2 days, zero work). Sour cream yields tang, creme fraîche yields moisture and depth.  Creme fraîche:  1.  5 parts heavy cream in a jar, 1 part buttermilk. 2. Give it a stir, 3.  cover loosely with a coffee filter, rubber banded to the top and set out in warm place 24 hrs.  4. Stir, will be thick. Replace lid tightly and pop it into fridge another 24 hrs. Finito! Enjoy!   I use this in cream sauces where sour cream would curdle.

I have it in the oven NOW...I had no trouble doing it just as instructions said. I see it rising and tasted the spatula  after it was in the oven, wonderful flavor.  This will be a keeper and I usually do not like, if it is not chocolate.m

This is delicious!  I make some slight changes.  First i used a 9x9 square pan. (Silicone). Next i mix the blues berries into the batter.  I also have used regular and light sour cream and found no taste difference  I have baked with and without the pecans.  They aren't really necessary as the cake is amazing without.

I made an all organic version & it turned out amazing!  Only a few subsitutions which made it less guilty... 
I substituted the sour cream with organic Greek yogurt, I also used organic cane sugar instead of both the white & brown sugar. 3/4 cup butter works well in the batter... I added 1/4 cup extra yogurt to make up for the difference. I couldn't find fresh organic berries but had my own frozen organic from summer. Defrosted the berries, which left a little juice. I also substituted the slivered almonds instead of pecans.
When making the layered mixture I put batter first, then crumble, then added all the berries (drizzled the juice on top of berries, then added remaining batter, then added remain crumble & slivered almonds. I used a spring form pan to cook. The cake took about 65 minutes to bake but well worth the wait! So yummy!

This recipe has A LOT OF SUGAR!  I didn't end up using all the crumb mix and it was plenty.  I used about half.  The way that it is written is confusing.  The crumb topping ingredients need to be separated.  Also, the way that the batter is made is too complicated.  Just the typical "cream the butter with sugar, add eggs" is totally fine.  Then add the dry ingredients and sour cream and vanilla.  No need to do all that work to get a creamy result.  I used frozen blueberries.  Tasted just fine without half the  sugar in the topping.

I should have known better after reading through the recipe.  This is without doubt one of the worst coffee cake recipes on the web.  Too sweet, too thick, a sticky nasty mess.  I am NOT a novice  cook and by no means is this  my first rodeo with a coffee cake, but don't waste the ingredients  or time.

Okay.  i made this exactly as written.  Couple things.  The texture was really nice.  it was light and fluffy.  However, I didn't get the topping done just right - and i thought it needed more blueberries and less of the top brown sugar stuff.  i little sweet for me.

Just finished making this, and still not sure what will come out of the oven, or if this is worth the effort.  As others found, it was impossible to layer the blueberries and topping. With a greased pan, the batter slid all over, and it did not seem like there was enough. I finally just folded the blueberries into the batter and dumped it into the pan. The topping never formed moist clumps and I added 2 additional tablespoons of melted butter. I think 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1/2 cup melted butter would work fine. I just sprinkled half of the topping from the recipe on the cake, froze the remaining, and threw it in the oven. Baking time was closer to 1 hour 5 minutes. Results were OK. I am sorry to say, with so many good recipes available, I am not sure why you would fight with this one.

I really liked this. I do feel with the current instructions the bake time is not accurate. I had to put it back in the oven multiple times to get the center cooked. I’d say my total bake time was approx 65 minutes. That was using a glass 9x13 pan and doing two layers of batter as described in the instructions. I think if done in a single layer it would be a lot faster!

Be sure to whip the butter/sugar/egg mixture until very fluffy before adding the flour mixture to have enough batter to spread in the pan.  I added extra blueberries which increased the moisture and baking time.  The flavor is buttery and very good.

I wanted to use up some blueberries and found this recipe. I follow Naples, who cooks all the time, and was SO discouraged by the trouble she had preparing this, but I read through the reviews and found an option that worked very well for me, thanks to the trials and errors of other cooks! I've posted photos. First, I lined my baking pan w/parchment paper to make getting the cake out of the pan a little easier. Second, I dropped spoonfuls of batter all over the bottom of the pan and used the back of a spoon to gently spread it. It was a bit of a challenge as I had already sprayed the parchment w/non-stick cooking spray so the batter wanted to lift up. I used a finger on the other hand to "hold" the batter in place as I gently spread. Then I layered the blueberries and streusel mixture and dropped dollops of batter again on the second layer and used the same "technique" (if. you can call it that!) and spread it very gently and carefully. It worked beautifully. I continued with the final layer of blueberries, streusel, and pecans. The pecans were the last to go on the cake and they had a great toasty flavor when we ate it, but could certainly be left out for those who don't care for nuts. The only other change I made was to use 4T of butter for the topping (simply because I had used 1/4 cup of butter for another recipe and didn't want to throw out the extra tablespoon of butter) and did not melt, but blended the topping ingredients with a pastry cutter. This cake is absolutely

Next time I will not have it made in two layers. Took to long to bake. When doing the toothpick test the center didn't bake in the 45-50 minutes. I had to add 20-30 minutes in order for the toothpick to come out clean. I would make one layer than add the blueberries and the coarse crumble with nuts on top. Coffee cake was good. Remember to coat the blueberries in flour so they will not sink to the bottom of the batter.

I used thawed frozen blueberries, which may have added to the overall liquid; the baking time increased by nearly 25 minutes to compensate, but the finished cake was delicious. It was very sweet, so plan on cutting back the white sugar to 1 1/4 cup next time, as the crumble topping is sweet enough.

I followed some of the other reviews and decided to be as easy as possible on myself. I folded the blueberries into the dough before putting into pan. Than just used about half the crumb topping on top. In my opinion the crumb topping could have used more butter. It was really hard to get the crumbly texture I was looking for. It was more like cinnamon and sugar with a few balls in in instead of crumbles. With all that said this was very delicious and sold really well at our fundraiser.

I will be making this again. You have to cook it longer than the recipe tells you (as most of the reviews tell you) but I made it for out of town guests. Everyone loved it.

Hard to do half and half, so I just put the blue berries in the batter and the crumb mix on top with a few dolops of butter. Excellent recipe.

This was absolutely the best blueberry cake recipe that I have ever made! I ran out of sour cream and had to use some ricotta to make up the difference. It was perfect!

I made this cake yesterday and after an hour tested and it came out clean so I took it out to cool and later noticed it was not cooked. My husband ate a piece anyway, but reluctantly, I doubt if ill make this again but if I do Ill have to make sure i cook it for a lot longer than specified in the recipe!

I made a few adjustments.  I took the advice of the reviewer that put the topping on all at once instead of layering.  Instead of sour cream I had a container of full fat Greek plain yogurt and used that instead.  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 pan .  This does not bake up to a tall cake so be mindful of that.  The flavor was excellent.  I also used a little less sugar for the topping.  Would make again.

Wow...so many things wrong with this. I will skip the layering part if I make it again. The two layer process is just not feasible. Waaay to sweet...and the baking time. I had it in the oven for 75 minutes. Checked it...toothpick came out moist but appeared to be done.  Let it cool...cut into it and discovered many raw spots of dough. Its back in the oven again at a higher temperarure probably for another 30-45 minutes.

I made this for my coffee group and they loved it.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I did make a change to the amount of  brown sugar topping. It really only needed half of the amount.  I followed the recipe and it was way too much topping. I'll cut it in half next time.

I made this for a staff meeting for work and everyone loved it!! I am VERY inexperienced when it comes to baking and I felt like this recipe was very do-able. When it come to spreading the batter, it worked to just to spread it with a large table spoon that I kept lightly wetting the back with water so it wouldn't stick to the spoon. I even shared the recipe a few times to those who enjoyed it!

This cake is delicious. I did notice that the batter was a bit thick, so I added 1 tlbs. of half and half to the entire batter. It made it much easier to spread. And, the easiest way to spread the second half is to dollop spoons of batter over the streusel layer and use wet fingers to spread it out. As long as your fingers are really damp, the batter will spread without moving the underneath layer. Try this cake now that it is blueberry season. You will not be disappointed! It is really good.

Used frozen red raspberries instead of blueberries and it turned out sublime! I also used 4 tablespoons of butter instead of 3 for the sugar crumble mix.

This recipe is spectacular.  I make it for get together and serve it with Cool Whip.  I always get many, many, “This is so good” statements.  The only thing different from this recipe that I find is the baking time.  I always find that I have to bake it longer than the stated time. I think it has to be in the oven at least an hour and maybe even more.  Make sure you check it with a toothpick or knife and that it comes out clean because otherwise you will have a mushy, doughy center.  But the taste is fantastic and you won’t have any left, if baked correctly.

Since there’s only two of us I cut the recipe in half and baked in 8x8 baking dish. Instead of layering I just pressed the blueberries lightly into the batter and then added the topping. Topping was a bit dry so I added a little more melted butter. Baked as directed, cake out great!

Very tasty warm. Very moist too!   I am thinking I might make it for a special occasion but might want to reduce some of the sugar. One cup of brown sugar would probably be better.   It took over an hour to bake with the middle set.

Huge hit at Easter brunch today! Everyone LOVED it! I listened to the other reviews and did not divide the batter. I filled the pan then added the blueberries on top. I pushed them down a bit into the batter then sprinkled the topping. I only used maybe half of the topping. Thanks for the great recipe!!

The Sour Cream Blueberry Coffee Cake tasted wonderful.  I followed instructions carefully and baked it for 20 minutes more than the recipe called for but the center never got completely done.  The outside 2" around the edges came out like coffee cake but the entire center had a consistency that was more pudding-like.

I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and I followed what some of the others and just folded blueberries in. It turned out great!

Delicious breakfast cake altho the baking time is way off.  I don't even know how long it finally took to bake because I just kept extending the timer & double checking my oven thermometer.

It takes a lot longer to cook than specified. It's delicious I tried the toothpick method to test it. It came out clean but went to cut it and it was still raw. Put it back in for another hour or so.  I had to look again to see if I did something incorrectly, didn't. Just took a long time to cook.

Deliciously moist coffee cake filled with tender blueberries! The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was how the edges and bottom of the cake slightly overcooked while waiting for the center to finish. *I followed one reviewer's advice and added 1 tbsp milk to the top layer of batter for ease of spreading, which did not seem to affect the overall texture and flavor, but did make it easier to spread. Also followed the advice of several reviewers and mixed all the blueberries (unfloured) into the batter rather than layer them in the center and top, which worked out well- was easier to spread and they didn't sink to the bottom. Will definitely make again, next time insulating the sides and bottom of the pan to even out the baking time- I want ALL the deliciousness!

Everyone loved this at our last gathering so it is a success by any standard.  Like everyone else, I had difficulty forming the layers  because the dough wouldn't stretch, but I did thin the top layer of batter with a tiny amount of milk and it worked.

Wow this was so very moist and yummy. I made as directed and after reading reviews i decided the easiest way to spread the batter was to dot it on and use finger and spoon to spread, it helped. Will definitely make again.

This was just great.  I am not a baker, so my husband helped.  Cut the sugar a little (sorry, don't really know how much)  Husband thought it was a little dry , next time may add more liquid.  Tasted almost like the one my mom used to make!

I made this for our tennis group and everyone really liked it.
It's very rich and moist and delicious. I highly recommend it. It is difficult to spread the batter on the top - so when you get to this step, just spoon out small portions all over the top and don't worry that doesn't spread perfectly. It will work out.

I liked it.  I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup and it was still sweet enough because of the topping. My husband loved it and he is not a sweets fan. I will make it again.

This is a fabulous coffee cake, with one exception. I baked for the recommended time and my cake tester came out clean, however a good portion of the center was not cooked through.  I will definitely make this again but just bake longer.  It is delicious and was a big hit.

I gave half to my neighbor and she said it was delicious. There was one review that said there wasn’t enough after for2 layers and can understand that.  I just made sure the bottom was covered enough and used the rest for top. My husband said it was very good.  It is a keeper. I though it was very good too. With me it was the crumbs, I get never get them to crumble that much, but  It was still excellent.

Recipe went together as directed.  Although I had to bake it at least 30 minutes longer than directed.  The center was not baked through by 50 minutes.

Great coffee cake.  Like others, I spooned on the second layer of cake batter to help in the spreading process. I also wet a butter knife to help with the spread.  I changed nothing in the recipe and used a 9” X 13” pan.  The cooking time was 1 hour 15 minutes.  Not sure how this could be fully cooked in just 45 minutes.  I'll make again.

Followed the recipe spot on and we all agreed that this entire dish is nothing more than eating a huge spoonful of sugar. It is terribly sweet and not flavorful in any way.We will not be making this ever again.

Soooo delicious!!
After reading the other reviews this is what I did:
I used 1 1/2 cups sugar instead of the 2 cups. And I baked it for 55 minutes because I was nervous that it wouldn't be done. I also used frozen blueberries - dusted them with flour and followed the directions.
I did the layers and it turned out great. I love streusel, so having two layers sounded great to me!
Yum!!

I first want to take a moment to thank all of the reviewers who took the time to suggest changes and to help those who were having problems with this recipe.  I love this site because I can always depend upon others to help fellow bakers/cooks have success with their efforts.  For this cake, I followed prior suggestions to reduce the white sugar by 1/2 cup,  fold the blueberries in after dusting them with flour, and to "glop" the batter in large spoonfuls for each layer, GENTLY smoothing with an offset spatula occasionally dampened with hot water.  It was a breeze to get the batter  cleanly in layers this way.  In addition, the crumble required at least two additional Tbsp of melted butter, and I found the recipe's amounts to be exactly right!!  So, I am hoping that this helps others out there to make and enjoy this recipe.

Made this as directed, very good cake, not too sweet, not too spicy. I did use frozen blueberries (not in season here) and it turned out just fine. I thought it was going to be a very flat cake, but it rises during baking. I did bake it an extra 15 minutes as cake-tester in middle came out wet. Would be good with any type of berries or fruit I imagine, might try something else next time.

For an easier time spreading, I dropped dallops of the batter around the pan and spread it out with a spatula. Second layer started mixing up a little at the edges, but that didn't affect anything at all. This recipe is a keeper!

This has a delicious flavor.  All of the ingredients together are fabulous.  However, I followed the recipe to the T, but I had to bake it for almost 1 1/2 hours.  It just did not set.  It came out like a very dense cake.  It still taste great!

I. Haven’t made this yet , because I’m wondering if I could use drained canned blueberries or cherries, I have quarts that I canned and want to use up, I’m going to make this and write another review. I like making a recipe as written the first time and the next time make adjustments if needed, but this time I’ll use my canned blueberries drained and maybe cut back on the sugar ( I didn’t use a lot of sugar in them) , my main concern is that the canned blueberries will make it sloppy, wish me luck

I used frozen blueberries so maybe that is why I had to bake it 10 minutes more that what the recipe called for. Spreading the second half of the dough was difficult. I put tablespoons of the dough on then spread that out. It was delicious!

This coffee cake is delicious, rich and buttery.  I will make it again and again. Who doesn't love sweet blueberries! Those of you who had trouble spreading the 2nd layer of dough, don't spread, push dabs together over the blueberries. You need to put 1" spoons of dough all over the blueberries, then with the top of your spreader or knife, slowly join those pieces until you've covered the top.  Takes a little more time, but the layers are so pretty. One change: I don't think I'll bother with the pecans next time because they don't stick to the struesel and fall off. Besides, it's already a crowd pleaser. In this case, for church coffee hour. I should have made two.

Did not read the reviews before I made it. Totally agree that there is not enough batter for the second layer but the cake was not bad in the middle. Was a bit thin and sugary on the outsides. Will try a smaller pan if I ever make it again

Very good!! We picked blueberries yesterday for jam and I had some extra.  DH loves coffee cake and blueberries, so this fit the bill.  I had very little problem putting this cake together as directed, but did cut by 1/4 the amount of topping and was plenty for inside and top.  I can see how some were frustrated with the process.  I put in half of the batter in the pan, added crumbs and berries (skipped pecans). I did use the 9 x 11 pan, for me it would have overflowed in an 8 x 8.  (It makes a lot more than 12 servings)  For the top layer, I added about 2 tablespoons of milk to thin it up a bit.  To spread the batter on top, I used a jiffy peanut butter spatula, but any stiff plastic spatula would do.  Rubber spatula was not going to work, I quickly discovered, as it grabbed the batter too much.  But no problems spreading with the stiffer plastic one.  Then added the rest of the crumbs on top.  It did take 15-20 minutes longer to bake than the instructions stated.  It turned out beautifully!

There is NO WAY that you can spread half of the batter onto the bottom of a greased 9x13 pan, let alone the 2nd layer over blueberries and crumble! This recipe is not enough for a 9x13 pan either. I kept checking the measurements to ensure that I measured correctly, and I did! 
IF I make this again, it till be in an 8x8 pan but the batter is still too thick to "spread", as another person mentioned. Something is not right with the recipe and the instructions.

12.30.16 ~ Delicious coffee cake! Every year we get together with the same friends for NYE. I make a coffee cake for them to have for their NY Day breakfast. We were out of town, this year, but I had to carry on with my tradition. So I made up this recipe and baked in two pans to be able to share them. I didn't have any problems dividing the dough to have the blueberries in the middle of the layers. I did beat the butter and sugar for about 5-7 minutes to make sure it was light and airy and then continued with the recipe. My only issue was the baking time. They were no where near done at the 45-50 minute mark. I had to bake them about 70 minutes. We put them in the fridge and half of us liked it cold from the fridge and the other half stuck theirs in the microwave for about 30 seconds. A great recipe that is worthy of repeating. When we left Kentucky, we left the leftovers of our pan for our son and DIL.

Yes I have made this coffee cake it is yummy. 
 The list of ingredients are off, not the same as in the mixing instructions. I did alright with  that because I'm a seasoned baker but if it was someone just starting out the would probably throw me off.

This was delicious! I did have some troubles like others with spreading the second half of the batter over the blueberries and crumbles. Had I read the reviews before I made it I would have added a little bit of milk to the last half of the batter.

I mixed the blueberries in the batter and used half of the brown sugar mixture and sprinkled that on top of the coffee cake and none in the middle as the recipe says.  I baked it an extra 5-10 minutes. It was yummy and received many compliments.

This is a tender and delicious blueberry cake. I made it with frozen berries twice and had to add about  10 mins to the baking time but it turned out wonderful.  I've layered the berries in the middle as directed and also folded them in, the second time.  They both work fine except, when I folded them in, it was a bit of a hide and seek game, looking for where the berries landed.  Stirring too much turns your batter that ugly gray  color, so making a solid layer in the middle works better, for even, berry distribution.  We love this cake, I'll make it again and again.

This coffee cake is great.  I did not put blueberries in the middle section, only on the top.  I think that might be the trick to putting the top layer of cake  mixture over the middle crumbs.  I also put dollops of dough over the center mixture prior to spreading it and it worked very well.  Will make again.

I just made this coffee cake and it is in the oven! I read the reviews before I started and was fearful of spreading the dough.  I didn't have any trouble spreading the dough as I used a table knife. The trick to spreading the dough  is taking your time.  I did use extra cinnamon and vanilla and used frozen berries which I thawed and drained well. Can't wait to try!!

This was okay. I would give it four stars but the  second layer of batter was hard to spread on top of the second tier of berries and crumble mixture. I reduced both sugars and found the cake sweet enough. Also, I cut it into 16 pieces...12 would have been way too big!

Amazing!!! I used frozen blueberries and I think that was a mistake. I baked it forever trying to firm up the middle. Eventually I took it out of the oven and overnight it firmed up. But would definitely stick with fresh blueberries. Wonderful, wonderful delicious recipe!!!!

Amazing flavor!  I didn't find it hard to divide or spread -- just dropped the batter in spoonfuls on top and then spread a little to cover.  I didn't melt the butter, just softened it to make for crumbly sugar mixture & I added an extra tablespoon of butter to the sugar mixture the consistency needed.  Wonderful recipe, will definitely make it again!

We absolutely loved this recipe.  I made half of the recipe and baked in an 8" x 8" baking dish.  The batter is thick so in order to spread, I dropped it by spoonfuls in the prepared dish and then spread with an offset spatula. I baked for about 48 minutes before it was done in the center. I allowed it to cool and then sliced.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Mrs.Encinas:). It is definite keeper!

This was amazing! I use blueberries I had just picked.  Unfortunately, I didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to substitute.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I only had one sick of butter, so I added some shortening and applesauce. I also used half whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar. I couldn't really spread the batter over the top, but it didn't matter.  It baked up beautifully, but did take almost an hour.

This coffee cake was very good and as for the problem some have with spreading the batter over the berries and crumble, I have been doing this for many years with another recipe I have and what I found to be best way is to dip a knife in hot water from tome to time and slowly spread. It makes it a lot easier and no hassle at all.

So delicious! I made it for a potluck so I used white flour and all the sugar it called for. It was very smooth (I prefer the heartiness of whole wheat flour) and SUPER sweet (I will cut the sugar in half), but good nonetheless. I used frozen raspberries and blueberries and I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It gave it a dense yet fluffy texture
