Taste is sensational (but be prepared to spend some time.)  They were sticky, even on the wax paper! But, truly the best crepes I have ever tasted.  (By the way, we used turkey sausage for a healthier dish.)

I changed a few things.  I cheated and prepared a packet of hollandaise sauce.  For the egg mixture, I scrambled 5 eggs and 1/4 c. milk - omitting the egg whites and cheese.  I mixed those with the sausage - vegie mixture along with a can of sliced black olives .  When making the crepes, I only used 2-3 T. of batter per crepe.  I put the stuffed crepes, seam side down, in a 9x13 pan, covered them with the hollandaise sauce and shredded mexican cheese (next time I may sprinkle the cheese on the inside of the stuffed crepes).  I baked them at 350 for about 10 minutes - until the cheese was melted - and served with salsa.  Time consuming, but worth it!!  Thanks for the great recipe idea!

looks great, one question. Is line #3 the hollandaise sauce?

I omitted the hollandaise due to calorie counting, and the recipe was still delicious. My kids each ate a large crepe for dinner without complaining, and hubby asked for a repeat. Cilantro brightens all the other flavours, which are already a great combo.

Wow.. these are delicious! I used homemade turkey sausage and a hollandaise mix and used skim milk and butter flavored powder in it. This isn't difficult. You could make the fillings ahead of time and then reheat is and make crepes fresh when you are ready to eat. I will make this again... for certain

These are so good! The only thing I do differently is the hollandaise. I find it bland, so I add hot sauce to kick it up a notch.

This was nice. It was my first attempt at crepes and they turned out OK, though I think I need to cook them at a lower temp because they started to cook before I got to swirl the batter around. I did find that there was way too much filling to crepe ratio, and way way to much egg filling. Will make again but probably half the egg filling and double the crepes. I got 6 very full crepes using the recipe as written.
