These were excellent!  We are from Louisiana and have had our share of crab cakes.  My husband said these were the best he has had.  I made a couple of changes.  I used Tony's Cacheries seasoning instead of tarragon and I broiled them 10 minutes each side in the oven to cut down on fat content. Great recipe!

Super good, made them for Xmas Eve party everybody loved them. Did a double batch as I had 2 /16 oz cans of crab.  Didn't have tarragon replaced it with minced garlic on one batch and hot sauce on another, also did half lemon juice and half worcestershire, amazing! They are wet, added a little more cracker crumbs, chilled for an hour before cooking and coated them with italian bread crumbs, totaly amazing! I think the buttery crackers is the key ingredient in making these cakes taste so smooth.

Really good and easy too.  I didn't have tarragon so I just used some Old Bay seasoning and it was great.

This was the first time I've ever made crab cakes and they were the best ones I've ever tasted! I did add old bay, used a little extra crabmeat and rolled them lightly in bread crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese because I wanted to seal in the flavor and wasn't sure if they would stay together properly without. I always had crab cakes with alot of bready type fillers and never really cared for them until I made these. Huge hit with hubby, can't wait to make them again!Thanks!

This recipe is a mild flavor.  It is great.  We are not a seafood-loving family but we really liked this.   Since I have an allergy to wheat I substituted cornflakes for crackers.  I bet the crackers would have made it better.

I've never liked crab before, but for some reason I found myself with a whole fresh crab and I needed a recipe!  This seemed to be one of the easier crab recipes and to a nonseafood eater--it was okay!  I had everything except the tarragon--had no idea what to replace it with.  Easy to make, and my husband said it tasted like other crab cakes he's eaten!  If you aren't a seafood type, I suggest a little less crab and more crackers...maybe more seasonings.  I'd eat them again!

absolutely superb.  My husband could not stop raving about it.  I bought crab legs from the market and shelled them and had fresh crab meat to make the crab cakes.  What a wonderful recipe... Thank you thank you. Daffydilone

This is a great recipe -- enough filler to "stretch" crabmeat (which is pricey even here on the Maine coast) but not too much to mask it.  Thanks!

EXCELLENT and very easy. I substituted old bay for tarragon, vidalia onions for green, and whole grain cracker crumbs.  Everyone raved! I served it with a chilled sauce of 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup salsa, 1/8 t white pepper, 1/8 t old bay. Really delicious!

This was the first time that I have ever made crab cakes. These turned out to be the best that I have ever had! I used imitation crab and could not tell the difference between the real crab. These were lemony tasting and not fishy at all. I will definitely make these again. I liked them so much that I made 2 batches in the same day. The only change that I made was using imitation crab meat and a light sprinkling of dill. I would also recommend baking them rather than pan frying because they hold together much better. Bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes, turning over after 10 minutes. Thanks for posting this recipe.

This was my first time making crab cakes, and they were amazing!!  I love this recipe!  I was nervous that the crab cakes would fall apart when I cooked them, but they didn't!  I doubled the recipe, since the can of crab that I bought was 16 ounces.  I also substituted panko for the crushed buttery round crackers.  I found a recipe, on allrecipes, for a red pepper sauce.  I was very pleased with this sauce too.  I had a few leftover crab cakes, so I froze them and reheated them two weeks later.  They were as good as they were the first time.  These crab cakes are easy and delicious.  I would make them again.

Doubled this recipe and made it for Christmas. Used Old Bay instead of tarragon per other reviews, and also rolled in bread crumbs and grated parmesean cheese. Used remoulade sauce on the side. Very easy and VERY good!!!

These are THE BEST!!!  These were so incredible!  I used reduced fat Ritz (all I had) and doubled this recipe.  I used both Tarragon and some Old Bay.  I also increased the crushed red pepper.  I baked these in my convection oven for about 8 minutes per side.  Served these up with fresh squeezed lemon and some Tabasco and we were in HEAVEN!  The best crab cakes I've made.  A must try!

I like these and they came together quickly. However, you just can't make crab cakes without Old Bay so I added that and left out the tarragon. I'll be serving these for New Year's Eve. Thanks! :o)

The crab cakes were ok. Kinda bland. I felt like it was missing something but couldn't put my finger on what.  I did use can crab so that may have been the problem. I think fresh crab would have been better. It seemed the mayo and lemon over powered the crab. I added more crackers but it still was very runny.  Next time I will use less mayo and lemon juice.

I made this tonight with fresh crab meat.  We have a place on the SC Coast and blue crabs are plentiful.  I used claw meat as well as the lump (body) meat and doubled the recipe.  Like other reviewers, I also coated my cakes in Italion bread crumbs before frying. I also added a touch of Old Bay to the crab mixture.  They held together just fine and looked great.  Everyone agreed that they were delicious.  I love crab cakes but I am picky about them.  These were more crab and not so bready like some.  As good as any I've eaten anywhere and worth the trouble to pick fresh crabs! The recipe itself is super easy!

This recipie is really easy and my husband (who doesnt like seafood) loves them.  The only thing I have changed is I use garlic powder instead of the tarragon as I dont have that in the house.  I let them sit in the fridge for an hour prior to putting them in the oven.  Once in the oven at 350 degrees I cook for 6-8 mins per side and then broil them for until I have the desired crispiness which is usually for another 3-5 mins per side. I serve it with my ceasar salad and some tartar sauce.

Super yummy!  I made these on a whim with a two dollar can of ghetto wal-mart crab meat and onion powder instead of green onions and they were still good!  (Now THAT is saying something)  For a sauce I ate them with a mix of mayo, sour cream, and cilantro.   nice little lunch!

Works with tuna! I didn't have crab, red pepper, or tarragon, but these sounded so good I wanted to try them. I doubled the other ingredients, used 3 - 5oz. cans of tuna, and 1 teaspoon of Pride of Szeged fish rub for the spices I didn't have. Sorry to mess with a perfectly good recipe, but these are great. Mine made 10 cakes.

These are the best I've made in a long time!  I did not have tarragon so used Old Bay, the crab was Bumble Bee brand and I used two cans - will try to find fresh next time although the can is fine.  I did add a few more crackers too.  Served with corn on the cob and Tartar Sauce II and Wild West Coast Seafood Shrimp Cocktail Sauce.

These were perfect as is. I'm new to cooking, so didn't know butter could burn so fast, next time will use lower heat. Otherwise terrific!

It's a good base recipe. I had never made crab cakes before so I was going into this as an experiment.
I am a home cook, but my ambition says I am a professional chef.
I decided to give mine a Mediterranean flair.
I replaced the Mayo with Greet yogurt, used a tablespoon of lemon juice and a teaspoon of cooking wine, and I used a generous amount of sage, orange peel and paprika. I also used panko instead of crushed crackers. I just added until I liked the consistency. Honestly, if you follow this recipe I would use much more seasoning that it calls for. Never underestimate the power of salt and pepper, either.
Crab is a VERY strong flavor, and you don't want your spices to surrender. Good to pair with Mediterranean spiced grits or Tzatziki sauce.

I made these for the Preakness Race in 2012 and they were incredibly good!

These were the changes that I made:
*1 packet of Old Bay Crab Cake Seasoning
*4 Tablespoons of Panko crumbs instead of the cracker crumbs.
*I sprayed a baking sheet with Olive Oil Pam and baked at 350 for 8 minutes on each side.  Then, I switched the oven to broil and broiled until golden on each side (about 3-4 minutes each side).

This recipe made 15 4.5 inch patties.

I garnished them with a fresh lemon slice and a sprinkle of fresh dill and served them with Tartar Sauce and Brown Spiced Mustard.

These were really good! I made them tonight for dinner & they were very good! I doubled them & made them exactly as called for except I didn't have tarragon so I replaced it with crushed fresh garlic. Then I added 1 1/2 sleeves of crushed ritz crackers to the mixture cause it was very wet. After I mixed everything I formed patties & dipped it in italian bread crumbs to give it a coating.  They were very good although I felt they could use a little sauce & the thought of mustard wasn't appealing so I will have to find a sauce for them, but other than that they were great!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful.  The only complaint I have is I should have made more!

Really good and easy too. I didn't have tarragon so I just used some Old Bay seasoning and the sauce really complemented the flavors. They freeze very well too.  My family loved them and want them all of the time.

I recently went crabbing in Oregon at Netarts Bay and caught our limit of Dungeness Crab. We ate as many crabs as we could and decided to make the remaining crab into crab cakes. I pulled up this recipe and was not disappointed. I wouldn't change a thing. They were great.

My first time making crab cakes. They were quite delicious. I live on the Gulf Coast in FL so we had blue crab. I followed the recipe pretty close however I wanted a little more spice so I made up a cajun seasoning using salt,  dry mustard, onion powder,  garlic powder,  black pepper and cayenne pepper. I didn't have any tarragon so I used the cajun seasoning instead. Then after I mixed it up it was a little wetter than needed so I put panko bread crumbs on the outside and fried in coconut oil!  The hubby and I were very happy! ! Great quick easy recipe.

Great recipe. very easy. I used Old Bay Blackening seasoning and didn't have tarragon. I used more green onions than called for and wished I didn't. As written, I'm sure the onion level is fine.

I made these with canned salmon instead of crab because that's what I had in the pantry. I left out the tarragon and replaced the buttery crackers with Panko crumbs. I then added a couple of tablespoons of Asian Chili/Garlic sauce for flavor and color. All other ingredients were the same as the original. I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, until slightly browned on edges. Nice and spicy!!

These are fabulous!  They are one of the best crab cakes I have had.   I recommend buying the freshest lump crabmeat you can find.  That will produce the best tasting crab cake.  Thanks for sharing!

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I changed a couple of things to suit our family's taste.  Instead of  tarragon, I put in 1/2 tsp of seasoning salt. I also used 1/16 tsp of Cayenne Pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  Even with those changes, the crab cakes were simply amazing!

I tried all the other recipes for  cake with the million ingredients and none tastes as good as this one.  Simple but delicious.  My husband loved it.  My father n law (who likes nothing) loved them too.

These were WONDERFUL!  I used a bit less mayo and cracker crumbs than the recipe called for, and I do not think they could have been improved upon any further.  I used lump blue crab meat and thought it was perfect for this.  I will definitely make these again.

wonderful recipe. I used fresh Alaskan crab from Valdez. I used onion powder but I know onions would be good too. Go a little easier on the red pepper flakes if you want a kid to eat them, otherwise GREAT

Good, but not the best ever.  No Marylander in her right mind would put tarragon and green pepper in a crab cake.  The whole idea of making and enjoying crab cakes is the sole factor that blueshell crab is to be mostly enjoyed for the full, absolutely, full taste of the crab.  Green pepper and tarragon take the crab in another direction.

These crab cakes were AMAZING!  And so easy to make!! We prepared them just as instructed with one exception - we split the mayo amount in 1/2 and with the remaining 1/2 used whole grain mustard.  Perfection!

These were really good! I didn't have tarragon on hand, so I used fennel instead, and I also broiled them instead of making them in a skillet. I also substituted crushed garlic croutons for the buttery round crackers and the crab cakes held together nicely. I served baked sweet potato fries as a side. Delish!

This was so good!!  I served it with Cucumber-Mango Salsa over lemon dill rice, and it got the best reviews at dinner time!  I wish I had pressed the liquid out of the imitation crab I used though and chopped it up, it was too mushy although it held together when I cooked it.

Wonderful flavor!  I was looking for something different than the Old Bay/Worchestershire/Mustard flavoring and this was it.  I didn't have any tarragon so substituted dill as I think it goes great with any seafood.  I took another reviewers suggestion and broiled them about 7 minutes per side.  A nice crispy result without any butter or oil. Even though it is the middle of January we had these with cole slaw and potato salad guess we're just wishing for summer.  Also topped them with  unseasoned roasted red pepper.  Will definitely be making again.

These were excellent! I took some other members' advice and added old mill seasoning instead of tarragon and I added more than the suggested amount of cracker crumbs, so that the mixture wasn't as wet. I also added a couple dashes of hot sauce and about half a teaspoon of spicy brown mustard and I rolled the cakes in italian bread crumbs and brushed them with butter before broiling them for about 10 minutes on each side (until golden brown). They had an amazing, rich flavor to them, and my (somewhat critical) fiance actually loved them! This was my first time ever making crab cakes and it certainly will not be my last!

Great recipe! Very basic and all you need to make a restuarant quality cake. Go easy on the breading if you want it to be very "rich". I didn't have tarragon but added a few dashes of old bay as others suggested. Also didn't use butter in the skillet but fat free pam instead.

Very good crab cakes. No crackers on hand so I used Italian bread crumbs instead. I doubled the recipe and made 6 crabcakes which three average size adults consumed without problem together with steamed asparagus and salad.

I thought the amount of tarragon was high, so I cut it in half and added the same amount of creole seasoning.  It was still too much tarragon (but a hint of tarragon definitely adds something to the crab cakes).  If I were to do the recipe again, I would cut the mayo in half too. All the mayo and crackers was too much filling.  I liked the fact that there was no celery or peppers in there though.   Lots of good thoughts in the recipe; just needed to be brought together.

Really great recipe! Next time I will use less mayo and add diced red pepper and garlic. I used leftover capinno from a seafood restaurant in Minneapolis. Best leftover idea!

Pretty simple and pretty tasty. I recommend chilling the crab cakes before frying to help them stay together.

These were good, and would probably have been better as a large meal size crab cake, which is what the recipe intended. I made smaller appetizer sized cakes and the consensus was, smaller cakes require a bit more pop, where as a larger one needs to be milder.

After substituting old bay for the tarragon these were some of the best crab cakes I've ever eaten.  It will definitely stay in my recipe box.

First off I have never had a Crab cake, but I do like Crab legs so I thought what the heck. Long story short I ended have Three Corn Dogs for dinner. I am not sure if it was because I baked them instead of frying them, or the fact that the crab taste was so strong but I will not be making these again.

Now my wife on the other hand loved them. She not only ate both of her extra large patties, but also scooped mine off my plate and ate them too. I also followed another reviewers advice and made the "Remoulade Sauce A La New Orleans" recipe from this site. She loved that too. I even think I caught her spooning some into her mouth. As for me the Crab taste was just too strong.

These were great,however I made some changes. I added 2 table spoons worcester sauce and topped them with a little bread crumbs and old bay. I then baked them at 375 for 20-25mins.

Thanks for posting this terrific recipe!!  Added Grey Poupon, Old Bay and some minced bell pepper.  These were some of the best crab cakes I have ever had!  Served with Remoulade a la New Orleans from this site (which is also delicious)!  Thanks again!!

These were very good and browned nicely. But i was unable to form a nice patty the mixture was very wet, so i added more of the breadcrumb mixture, which over powered the crab taste.So next time i will defintely add more crab because i love a lot of crab taste.Otherwise very good will make again. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic!  We came back from the shore with a bunch of leftover crab meat that we had picked from our steamed crabs and decided to try this recipe for crab cakes.  Boy, are we glad that we did!  They are as easy to make as they are delicious.  Didn't last long in my house!

This is a good recipe that's easy to make adjustments to. I had some canned crab that I bought on sale, so I used it. I didn't have buttery crackers so I used quick cooking oatmeal. I used some freshly dried tarragon from my garden and sauted the cakes in olive oil instead of butter. They were beautiful and delicious! I can't wait to try this recipe again!

I used regular bread crumbs and I didn't have tarragon so I used Old bay seasoning TM and added a little garlic powder and tobasco and a little dijon mustard and it was wonderful! My husband LOVED IT!!! He's very picky and said these were the best crab cakes he'd ever eaten. It HAS to be the best. :-) Thanks!

It was good, but kind of bland. I think this may be my fault as I used can crab instead of fresh crab.  There wasn't much going on here, more like crab biscuits... Served with Creamy Dill Sauce (always good). Would try this again with fresh crab, possibly imitation crab. Just needs more flavor.

These were so easy to make! I used real crab meat, but also used ingredients I had already, which was bottled lemon juice, Old Bay and Tony Chachere's Creole seasonings (instead of tarragon), yellow onion (instead of spring onions). I also added a couple of dashes of ground black pepper and Himalayan pink salt/black pepper/garlic mix. I made crab balls  instead of cakes, baking for 30 mins. at 350°, then on a Hi broil until the balls were slightly crispy on top (about 7-8 mins). My family loved them!!! Will definitely make these again.

I did not use tarragon because that is too a flavor. I used Old Bay, but Cajun seasoning is appropriate too.  Make sure that when you make this or any other crab cake that you use only blue crab meat.  Additionally, buy either lump or jumbo lump.  For a pound of crab, you need add only one sleeve of crackers, and saltines or ritz are both fine, the less the better.  Gently form the crab it into balls or mounds, not patties. THen refrigerate for an hour to firm.  It is unnecessary to  coat in anything.  You can broil or sauté.

In fairness, I live in Baltimore. We know crab cakes. Where’s the Old Bay? Trust me on this folks.

Delicious!  I added extra lemon juice and extra crackers. I will heat the skillet on medium-low next time, as they got pretty charred on the first side I cooked. DONT FORGET to serve with a delicious sauce!

These were delicious! Only recommendations I have are substitute old bay for tarragon (same amount) and cook in cast iron to get a beautiful, crisp exterior.

I added a little bit of spice with some Cayenne Pepper,  Chopped Red Orange and Yellow Peppers and Slap Ya Mama Seasoning.  Replaced the Butter Crackers with Panko Breading and the Crab Meat with Canned Chicken Breast due to Shellfish Allergy.  Delish!

I made these on Valentines Day. I've never made crab cakes before and they are great.  I did have to put them in the freezer for 1 1/2 hours before frying them because they were so runny. I used a seafood seasoning and Sylvia's Lemon Pepper instead of tarragon and canned crabmeat with crackers .  The next time, I"ll use both canned and lump crab. I made a sauce of sour cream,mayo,yogurt, Dijon, lemon juice, green onion, Sylvia's Soulful Seasoning and pepper and refrigerated it for an hour -longer would be even better.  We loved it and my man is still eating the sauce with a spoon!  Fantastic recipe - but be able to tweek it like I had to. I doubled the recipe and had 6 normal sized portions. I will be making them again soon!  Thanks!

I did not drain the canned crab meat nearly enough, making the mix so wet I had to add WAY too much crushed crackers to it to get it to a consistency I could use. That meant that the overwhelming flavor was store bought crackers. Next time I think I'll use dryer meat, and also perhaps a more neutral binder, like breadcrumbs.

I tried the recipe with Old Bay seasoning instead of tarragon but I should have cut the measurement by half, ended up a bit too salty because of the Old Bay Seasoning.

When I saw the "Best Ever" in the title, I was curious and had to try the recipe, even though I already have a favorite.  This proved to be very good, but it can't compete with Shirley Phillips Crab Cakes from the Phillips restaurant at the Baltimore Inner Harbor. The "Best Ever Crab Cakes" have twice as much bread/cracker filler as the Phillips version, which is the main reason that I prefer the latter. If you can't find Phillips Seafood Seasoning, you can substitute Old Bay, which is available everywhere.  I can't  tell the difference.

A mild but lovely flavor. I think next time I'll try adding a little old bay seasoning myself, and perhaps maybe add a little parm crust to it as well.

I've made plenty of crab cakes, but these were super good! I think the tarragon puts them over the top. Only addition I made was a little spicy brown mustard in the mix. I usually put a few capers in mine but didn't have any and still loved them. Hubby said best ones he's ever had. Thanks so much for an easy excellent recipe!

The crab cakes turned out great!  I used a 16 oz. can of super lump crab meat so I doubled the recipe.  I did not use Tarragon because I did not have any on hand; however, I did add two teaspoons of Old Bay Seasoning.  I am always looking for ways to cut calories so I used light mayo and reduced fat Ritz. The mixture made five large patties.  I put them in the freezer for about an hour before frying in a mixture of butter and olive oil.  I lightly covered each side of the patties with Panko bread crumbs before frying. I will definitely make this recipe again.

These were a little bland to me. The second time making I modified it quite a bit. So I guess I created my own recipe. I added salt, Dijon mustard,parsley, sautéed onion and green pepper. I liked it much better.

Outstanding! Used Old Bay instead of Tarragon and Panko for the bread crumbs. Like others rolled the patties in Italian bread crumbs with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Baked for 8 min a side at 350 then broiled for 3 min a side. Made a Cajun Ramoulade  and there were perfect.

we so loved the crab cakes.. used plain panko crumbs and only used 1/4 of a cup.. only added 2 T of homemade mayo.. added an additional 1.5 t of lemon juice.. substituted 1/2 t of minced serrano for the red pepper flakes.. and added 1 t of old bay to two of the patties.. pan fried with a very light coating of veggie oil.. we equally loved both types of patties.. i would rate this as a 4.5 star recipe.. but i'll give it a 5 star rating bc of the versatility.. ty for the start of a very delicious treat

Made there for my wife and she loved them, but said they could have been a little more flavorful. I did have to use Old Bay seasoning like some others because my local super market didn't have tarragon. It was pretty easy to make but I also had to use more crackers than what was listed to get the right consistency.

Delicious and easy.  I'd love to find a tomato relish dressing for them like the kind I've had at Kel's in Corvallis.

Crab cakes are so easy and delish!  Instead of cooking them in a pan I put them in the oven on 350 for 10 min then broiled them for 5 min.

I'd like to try these and def going to use the suggestions of Old Bay... in Maryland they just don't seem like crabcakes without it...i saw where people fried or baked...has anyone broiled them? if so do they stay together? thats my favorite way to eat crabcakes but don't want to waste it(meat expensive here too) if it won't work..sounds delicious! will repost back afterwards..Thanks!!

These were fantastic!  The recipe made 16 small appetizer-sized ones.  I served them with stoneground mustard, but also with a dip made of mayo, lemon, dill, pepper, and capers.

These were delicious.  I had a pound of fresh crab meat - so i doubled the recipe. Didn't have tarragon, so added some Tony's cajun season - added a little onion and garlic powders.  i made 8 crab cakes and broiled 4 of them on a stonewear baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray - cooked the other 4 as directed in skillet with butter and honestly couldn't tell the difference ...both great.  i did roll a couple in Panko bread crumbs before placing in skillet and those had a nice crunchy outside - but not any better -just different.
 GREAT recipe...thanks for sharing

These were great!  I had never made crab cakes before, or cooked from scratch with any type of seafood for that matter, and these were pretty easy!  I like that you can make them ahead too.  I like crab cakes, but my boyfriend LOVES them.  He said that these were better than those we ordered in restaurants, so I was pretty pleased with that.  This is a good dinner for two adults - each person gets two cakes.  My only criticism of the recipe is that that the cakes should be cooked on low-medium heat, not medium.  I had my burner set to medium (per the directions) and I burned the butter and had to re-do that part.  Other than that, it was perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!  We will make these a lot, I'm sure!  For the sauce, I used the "Crab Cake Sauce" submitted by Sal on this website, and it was great (though it was way more than we needed).

We substituted 1/2 cup crushed sesame crackers (gluten free) for the ritz crackers, 1/2 tsp Old Bay for tarragon, and added ground black pepper & celery seed. These turned out perfectly! Browned cakes completely on one side, flipped, cooked lightly on second side, then put under low broiler until everything else was ready. This made 8 small patties for crab cake benedict, served with Knorr hollandaise sauce, which we seasoned with extra lemon juice and a little cajun hot sauce for kicks.

I really liked this recipe.  The flavor was excellent and they were easy to fry in the pan without falling apart.  I make mini crab cakes with this recipe and put a dab of cajun aioli on top.  Yum!

I added a little more cracker and I also baked them.  They were perfect.  No oil or grease to get in the way of the crab.  My family loved them.

This was my first attempt at making crab cakes and they were awesome!  I don't think I can ever order them from a restaurant after having them.  I made a few minor changes, I took another reviewer's suggestion and broiled them rather than frying them to reduce the fat content, and I finely chopped green and yellow bell peppers (1/4 each) and mixed them in with the cracker crumbs.  I had fresh Dungeness crab and used about 15 oz because I wanted them to be very crabby :)  In all this was an excellent recipe, thanks!

I made adjustments to make 6 crab cakes, because I had 12 oz of crab.  I'm rating this a 3 only because we have never had crab cakes before.  So maybe we just don't care for them at all.  Nothing against this recipe.  I don't know.  Either way, we didn't like them enough to make them again.

These were great .  I substituted Old Bay for the tarragon and used vegetable crackers as I had them in the pantry.  I added more crackers until I felt that I could work the mixture without it breaking up in the pan.  I made smaller crab cakes to serve as an appetizer.  Served with cayenne mayonaise.   So easy and so delicious.

I'm sorry but these would be lacking in flavor for sure.  I came from Maryland and the best crab cakes are with mustard as well as mayo and a dash of ground mustard too. Please read the can of OLD BAY Seasoning and you wll see the difference in the two recipes.  WE broil the crab cakes since all we are cooking is the egg and heating it through  along getting a crisp outer coating on them.  Also, for the BEST crab cakes, you need to make them with the backfin meat which is the loin of the crab and not to break it up too much.  Thanks, Tom

My sister LOVED this recipe for lump meat crab bakes.  She liked it more than the several other recipes she has made.  It was pretty simple, too.   Tasted better the day after.

We loved them.  I was skeptical because I've made various fish cakes with bread crumbs before, and always liked them.  These were light and delicious.   This is definitely my new favorite recipe.  We didn't have tarragon.  I added in more green onion than the recipe called for and extra red pepper flakes.  I've already made this recipe twice in less than one month.  I can't wait to try it with other fish.

Defiantly use chunk crab meat. Some brands say they are chunk, but they are mush. This one did turn out as well as I would have liked so I'm going to try it again with better crab, fresh lemon, and no tarragon. I likes it, but my Wife didn't care for that flavor. I'll update after I try again.

I made the crab cakes, but for the herbs I used dill, parsley and chives. Also, 2 1/2 T Mayo, 1/2 tsp sambal, 1/3 tsp mustard, dash of Worcestershire along with 1/2 lemon juiced, 1 tsp smoke paparika and chili flakes.  The buttery crackers were a nice balance

Best crab cakes I have had since I had some on the east coast. I did add 1 1/2 teaspoons of old bay to the mix. Fresh crab is not always easy or cheap to come by in the midwest. I used great blue brand crab the last time and they were just wonderful. Family favorite.

Love these, stuck to the recipe and they were very tasty. I made 8 small patties, rather than 4 large, and was glad that I did, they will last a little longer! Will make these again with a pinch of salt.

Thanks these were great! I tripled the recipe and sautéed the white of the green onions, 3 T finely chopped red pepper and a jalapeño.  Also added minced Italian parsley. Yummy served with mango chutney!

The crab cakes are pretty good - I did not use canned crab - fresh in a plastic container - if that can be considered fresh.  The recipe was easy to follow - I followed I closed.  Cooked just fine, but had a "fishy" smell (that's the crab, not the recipe) - maybe I"m not a great fan of crab cakes.  I liked the ingredients; was easy to form the cakes.  I think I may have used a too small version of the crab meat - if I do again, I'll get the medium sized lump crab meet.  I think the 4 star rating should go against me, not the author of the recipe - it was probably my choice of crab to use was wrong.  I don't need to add a picture since it looked exactly like what the recipe showed.

I can't  believe the cost of one 8oz can of  back fin crab can make such great tasting cake. Better then store bought which byw cost of one equals the can.

I didn't have tarragon, and they were still great. My other recipe uses hydrated stuffing mix for filler. Each is delicious cold as well as fresh out of the pan. And each is delicious with honey-mustard salad dressing for a "dip".

I live in Maryland and crab cakes are our specialty. We never put fillers in our crab cakes! No crackers ever in them. Coating them in bread crumbs or the crushed crackers to fry them!

After many years of preparing various crab cake recipes i settled on this one a couple years ago.  It really is the best i have found.  I add a little more than 8 ozs if crab and chill them before frying.   I like Old Bay in them.  i prepare them very close to the written recipe.   I am not looking for another recipe.  This is  the one.

The crab cakes came out great! I used left over crab from some king crab legs. I did substitute old bay, only because I did not have the other spice. Otherwise I followed the recipe.

This was the first time I ever made crab cakes and I have to say it really was easy but i don't think it has as much flavor as i would like. Next time I will add Old Bay to give it that seafood taste. Also more crackers are needed to hold it together although only one of eight (I made a double batch) fell apart.

I didn't have buttery round crackers (ritz style) so I just used the plain square ones (like the ones you eat when you're sick) and still these were the BEST crabcakes I have ever eaten anyway...I felt better than any chef and I super impressed my fiance...he asked me to make them the very next night again #winning

"They're the best crab cakes I've ever had!" (my husband).  I didn't have buttery round cracker (Ritz type), so I used  Ranch Wheat  Thin crackers. Additionally, I did break the crab a little, and used (dare I say) imitation crab meat.

I have had crab cake at many different places and this is the absolute best recipe. I did coat each side with plain bread crumbs and made a sweet orange marmalade sauce to dip in. This was a big hit with my family.

Almost perfect, unless you come from Maryland or Virginia, then you add a little Old Bay Seasoning the way that I did!  That and the tarragon put them over the top!   They were great!

So easy and delicious!  I read a review saying the recipe was wet, so I made sure to drain the crab well and it turned out the to be the perfect consistency.  I subbed 1/2 tsp of dill for the thyme and 1/2 tsp of dijon for the red pepper.  These are the best crab cakes I have ever made, they didn't stick to the pan,  browned perfectly and didn't require too much butter.  They were so yummy on their own they did not need dipping sauce, but we did like them with a little tabasco.

This is my second time making it. Originally I found it too lemony and missing something. I didn't care for the recipe too much. On my second try I took the lemon down a bit, added a bit more of everything except the egg, and used mash potatoes. That was the ticket! Much more tasty!

Okay...I added the following ingredients:
Sour Cream, Dijon Mustard, red onions, smoked paprika and Chipotle Chili pepper.  I didn't have the green onions or tarragon. Also, I used bumble bee canned crabmeat. These crab cakes were totally delicious. I'd rather use sour cream than mayo.

It was pretty good! I did not have the tarragon (I need to buy some) so I substituted with a little garlic salt. I think next time I would add minced mushrooms for more flavor.

Absolutely the easiest crab cakes I’ve ever made. Only change was I added more crab since we live on the west coast and catch our own.

I made them and they were pretty good.  Although, I only got 1 my family at the rest.  I did change up my seasoning .  I don't like spicy so I eliminated the red pepper flakes but had a garlic seasoning mix that went great.

pretty tasty, but I had a hard time forming the patties. I think the mix needs to be thicker, with either more cracker or bread crumbs, or add some flour or starchy substitute.

These really are the best Crab Cakes I’ve ever had! I’ve made this recipe multiple times & it’s turned out delicious every time! I like to add more mayonnaise to the consistency I prefer & it’s just perfect! I even used imitation crab meat with this recipe too. I just used two packages imitation crab meat diced as fine as possible. It tasted so incredibly similar to real crab cakes. I also served with a homemade remoulade sauce over fresh raw spinach & greens. It’s so incredibly DELICIOUS!!!

Crab took on the tarragon flavoring and that's all it tasted like. So, if you LOVE tarragon, you'll love this recipe.  I like the hint of tarragon, this was too much.  Also, if you make this, crunch up some extra crackers.  How much you need will depend on how wet the crab meat is.  I needed more crackers, not much more though.

I substituted Old Bay for tarragon, and mine needed extra crackers. Not fishy at all! Even my teenagers loved it! Great on its own or with tartar sauce, but I may look for a more interesting sauce.

Loved this one! Easy to make and the taste was great! Someone commented to use fresh crab, I used caned and it was still very good! Next time I will try it with fresh crab and I am sure it will be wonderful again.  Would recommend this as an easy meal during Lent!

I made this, and it had so much filler that I could barely taste the crab.  After reading other recipes, I think the only thing that needs to be tweaked on this one is the process...not necessarily the ingredients.  There was so much dressing relative to the amount of crab meat, I had to add too many cracker crumbs to get it to hold together.

I can see how the size of the egg might make a noticeable difference in the volume of dressing.  And compared to others, this recipe substituted 4 tsp of lemon juice for a TB of the mayo, so it  certainly is runnier by design.

Next time I will put the crab meat into a separate bowl, then add the dressing a little at a time (tossing by hand) to just coat the crab meat, and then add the crackers a little at a time (tossing by hand) to get the desired consistency.

Other recipes called for upping the flavor by adding 1 tsp each Worcestershire sauce and mustard (Dijon, or yellow, or dry).  I'm also thinking that using Ritz crackers might have overwhelmed the crab flavor, so I might try Saltines next time, or perhaps a 50/50 blend.

Usually I would have jumped right back in and tried to make it again with my modifications, but at $16 a pound for crab meat, my appetite for experimentation is not all that great.

This is the first time I made crab cakes. This recipe was very good. I made it as the recipe indicated except added some old bay to the recipe.  Everyone who had some at dinner really liked it and I thought it was good too.  I think the canned crab might have been a bit bland.  I am wondering what the use of something other than the buttery crackers would be like, so might try some variations next time.  Over all a very good recipe.

My son-in-law and I threw this together during an hors d'oeuvres party I threw for New Year's Eve, and it was AMAZING. We failed to shred the crab (missed it in the instructions), so we had to use more bread crumbs than called for, but otherwise no modifications. AMAZING. DEFINITELY will be making again.

Phenomenal.  Goal was to find a recipe that was more crab, LESS filler. I think the crackers are the secret ingredient.  Followed the recipe perfectly, no need for modifications.  Don't mess with perfection!  Made Christmas Eve dinner delicious, paired with the Lobster Bisque Recipe. Thank you AllRecipes!!

These are great. I used salmon instead of crab because that’s what I? had in my house but it was still really good!

These really are the best crab cakes! I double the recipe and freeze half of them uncooked. Later just thaw In the refrigerator and cook in butter.

I wanted to make eight cakes so to keep costs down, I used  two 120 g cans of crab and made up the rest I needed with fake crab. It was delicious!

I thought these were very good.  The only changes I made were that I added 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard and a dash of Old Bay seasoning to the mix.  I also sprinkled fresh lemon juice over them as they cooked in the pan.  My wife and I loved them though.  Really very good.  We will make them again.

I made the recipe exactly as it stated, as I like to see what the recipe is like before I tweak it. These were outstanding crabcakes - probably the best I've ever had. We had 12 fresh Dungeoness crab! to use up!!    I will definitely make these again and am sharing the recipe with my friends. Who would've thought that coarse ground mustard would be so delicious on  Crab cakes? My husband and I mixed shrimp cocktail sauce and  Gray Poupon Country Dijon mustard for an absolutely spicy & delicious dipping sauce!  It was EXACTLY what these cakes needed to sing!

Thank you for the recipe-first time making crab cakes.  Simple and delish. Liked using the butter crackers instead of bread crumbs.   I didn't have tarragon, so I used a creole seasoning, along with Trader Joe's 21 seasonings, plus a little dry mustard, and some srirachca sauce . .they are the bomb-or they were the bomb-they are gone!  Right now is Dungeons Crab season in OR-Oh Yeah!  Need to make these again and again.  Not sure if I would make it with can crab-might be okay.  Would imagine you could use any seasonings or other ingredients with the base of crumbs, egg, and crab.  Next I'm going to try with a little mayo/Mexican sour cream . . salsa, chili and lime.

Made these for my parents and they said the recipe is a "keeper"! I added 1/2 tsp Old Bay and a bit more than a cup of cracker crumbs, refrigerated for 20 min to set and broiled on middle rack on lightly greased cookie sheet for 5 min each side.

I made one change only because I have a large herb garden. I used fresh  tarragon and it was not overwhelming at all. 
This was my first try at making crab cakes and my husband loved them as did I.

These are to die for! I literally make them at least once a month. Highly recommend! I don't make any changes to the recipe, just make sure to drain the crab really well if you're using canned crab.

These crab cakes were the easiest thing to put together! I did tweak this just a little. I doubled the ingredients but to save on cost just a little I did a mix of 8oz fresh crab meat and 8oz imitation crab meat. Canceled out the green onions. They turned out amazingly!!

Fantastic!  I was lucky enough to use the meat from some snow crabs and the flavor was most wonderful.  I opted to bake them and they held their shape nicely.  Everyone raved about them.  Make these!!

These crab cakes were amazing!! The seasonings make all the difference!! I made a few slight changes since I didn't have all the ingredients listed. I subbed two crumbled pieces of toast for the cracker crumbs and sour cream in place of the mayo. Delicious!

I made these, but i did make a change. I diced regular onion, although i will try with green onion next time because im sure its way better, but the real change i made was i used teriyaki sauce instead of lemon juice. I figured the flavor would suit my family better. I didnt have tarragon either, so i added parsley, and just moved on. ;) They were great! I will make them again.

I made the recipe as it was written. I do not like reading reviews that have been changed in any way. The minute someone changes the recipe, it simply is not the same recipe. I used real first quality crab claws, fresh squeezed lemon juice, real mayonnaise etc. I lived on the east coast and have had crab cake all up and down the coast. I also live in Europe, traveled all over the world and I can honestly say, these are some of the BEST CRAB CAKES I have ever had. The recipe is also very easy to follow. Crisp on the outside,  tender and moist on the inside. They did not fall apart like so many crab cake recipes do. Not using bread crumbs was a brilliant idea!  Tip: 1. Use a room temperature  egg. 2. Once you put the crabs cake in the hot butter, do not flip them until they are ready to be turned. You can give the pan a light shake to make sure they are not sticking to the pan, but give them at least 4 or 5 minutes to cook on each side.

Followed the basic recipe but substituted Old Bay Seasoning.  Didn't have lump crab so used 12 oz of premium white crab meat and added imitation crab meat fit the lump effect.  Chilled for an hour, coated in Italian breadcrumbs and cooked using clarified butter in the skillet.  Turned out fantastic and very flavorful.

I used Old Bay seasoning instead of Tarragon and pepper flakes. And I didn't have the right crackers so I used bread crumbs that I sauteed in a little butter. I will definitely save this recipe and make it again!

Made it as-is without even looking at recommended changes just to have a "baseline." It was WONDERFUL and so, so easy!! Found a YouTube video on how to clean dungeness crab and had a great time from start to finish. Used Ritz crackers for simplicity. Easy peasy and SO GOOD!! 

Now, I'm going to read what other cooks have said.

Followed recipe pretty closely but added a teaspoon of Old Bay, some pepper and maybe a bit more red pepper flakes.  Used Bumble Bee White Premium canned crab (2 cans).  Crab was not fishy smelling at all, and that eased my fears.  Crab is packed with a paper lining so that eliminates metallic taste in fish.  Added perhaps more minced onion than indicated.  Otherwise, it would have been a bit bland.  Also coated cakes with flavored bread crumbs.  The mixture held together nicely, and wasn't wet like the Grandma's Salmon patties which I tried last week and reviewed here.  Cooked in fry pan five minutes a side and they came out perfectly golden brown.  Am not an experienced cook by any means, so I am proud how nice these came out.  Will definitely make again, and these would couple nicely with corn on the cob.  Served with dill sauce which recipe can be found here.  (Basically dill and sour cream.)

This was my first try at crabcakes! I made them for my father. I, unfortunately, cannot eat shellfish. But Dad said they were quite good. The only thing I changed was the number of servings. Will definitely make again in the future. Very easy recipe!

These were amazing and quick. I didn't have fresh crab so I used imitation for the first go around. The overall flavor and texture were great. I did halve the amount of salt though to make them a bit healthier. The whole process took less than 20 minutes. I highly recommend these as a date night option.

Delicious. Few changes....Used old bay instead of tarragon, used half lemon juice half Worcestershire, added minced red bell pepper and 3/4 teaspoon of dry mustard.  I also added a little olive oil to butter to fry. Served with a simple spicy mayo sauce. These were better than last ones I had at an expensive restaurant!!!

Very good!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it needed some more seasonings....maybe some old Bay Seasoning?  I will add some next time.

I didn't use red pepper flakes. used fresh tarragon and added the zest of the lemon too..  I substituted fresh chives for onions/scallions.   I also used fresh rustic bread toasted and chopped in blender for half the crumbs as well as buttery Multigrain crackers from trader joe's as the othe half... i recommend doubling the recipe for four people... keep crab in big chunks...  they were really loose and delicate. i browned them well on both sides.. in butter in skillet. served with tarragon sauce... fresh tarragon, fage greek yogurt, mayo, lemon juice, zest, garlic powder, salt and pepper, pinch of sugar, drop of rice vinegar. drizzled sauce over cakes and grilled asparagus (olive oil, salt, pepper, dash of garlic powder)  everyone loved them. truly best ever!

I loved the crabcakes besides the parts where there is too much mayo and butter.
I would give It a 96 out of 100.

We added 5 slices of thick cut bacon, crispy fried & crumbed into crab mixture, added some Creole Seasoning & pattied out the crab mixture, then fried them in the bacon grease.
PURE DELICIOUSNESS!

There is only one crab cake that I had in a restaurant in SC that I liked better.  The kids didn't like it all that much, but the adults really enjoyed it.

The crab cakes tasted very good, first time making some.  I used 2 tablespoons instead of 3, salt, pepper and garlic powder  because I didn't have pepper flakes or tarragon. Very easy recipe.

My boyfriend said they were better than the crab cakes I had previously bought from a restaurant! I doubled the pepper flakes and served over greens with a lemon-olive oil dressing I mixed up. So good! Definitely going to make them again! Also, would be fun to make with kids... have them crush up the crackers in a ziplock bag and if they are older they can help with measuring and step 1.

followed directions, but added a little Old Bay.  Crackers and then Panko till consistency was good (not enough crackers)  I had 2.5 pounds of crab,  for an anniversary party.  Made 17 4oz cakes.  Because of the amount, I set the cakes on 2 cookie sheets, melted butter in saucepan, brushed tops with butter, broiled for 4 minutes, flipped, brushed, broiled 4 more minutes, and waalaa...  Worked perfectly.

I made these and they were good. I added a few changes. I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce,  2 eggs instead of 1, a whole sleeve of Ritz crackers, crushed, some torn up bread ends, 1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs, garlic powder, dried minced onion, and Mrs Dash seasoning since I didn't have Tarragon or Old Bay seasoning. Then I fried the patties in 4 Tbs. Extra Virgin Olive oil instead of butter. Delicious! Thanks!

Linda, Linda, Linda. These were the best, most succulent crab cakes I have ever had! I used lump crab meat and followed the directions exactly except, I did have to use some cheez-its because I ran out of Ritz. Plus, I doubled the recipe because I had a 16 oz container of lump crab meat.
 Use lots of lemon juice and when mixing use minimal crackers so the crab meat is the star of the show!!
 Thank You, Thank You, Thank You...

Had a can of crab meat from Costco, I made this recipe because it seemed the easiest.  I made a couple of changes and it worked out great. We didn't have any red pepper flakes so we used California red chili powder, great. We also took the advice of another chef and used Tony Chacheries seasoning instead of tarragon, also great.  Instead of 8 oz of crab we used 12 oz, made them really crabby, my new favorite crab meal.

We loved this recipe the first time we tried it. There were a few things we did differently. We used minced garlic instead of tarragon and added shredded Parmesan cheese to the mixture. We used ritz crackers, which were great for frying in the pan and I added some extra crushed ritz crackers to bread over he top before putting it in the pan. My husband made a sauce for he crab cakes but it would have been good alone as well.

I love crab cakes....I crave them all the time so my boyfriend and I decided to make our own. This recipe is great! After trying crab cakes at so many places, these are definitely on top of the list! We used Italian seasoning instead of tarragon and we used some Dijon mustard. It came a little runny after the mustard so we added more crackers. Before putting them in the fridge for about an hour, we put bread crumbs all over. They came out amazing .... ! (I won't lie, I put one of mine a burger bun and ate it with attar sauce ... YUM!)

These were Great!  My family does a classic 7 fish dinner for christmas eve, and this year I traded cod cakes for these.  I followed the advice of  "yummycook" and others and substituted old bay for tarragon.  I also Made "Yummycook's" sause": a chilled sauce of 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup salsa, 1/8 t white pepper, 1/8 t old bay. Really delicious!

My changes: 1. imitation crab meat 2. no red pepper flakes or tarragon 3. Added about an 1/8 tsp. of celery seed. We loved these crabcakes. I did have to watch the cooking patties carefully because mayo acts just like butter and browns beautifully and quickly.

I always laugh at all the reviews that say how great the recipe is and then go on to say how they totally changed it and yet here I go doing the same.  I guess I'm rating my own version more than the actual recipe. 

I wanted to make a tuna cake po'boy bc my daughter doesn't like crab.  So I used this recipe replacing the tarragon with old bay and the crab with an equal amount of drained canned white tuna. (I also omitted the red pepper flakes bc she does like spicy things and I think the cake was the worse for it) It was a little wet so I used slightly more Ritz crackers than the recipe calls for.  I also made them ahead and refrigerated before cooking which worked fine.  

 I made a sandwich on a toasted and buttered roll with bacon,  tomato,  and a mesclun mixed green.  For the adults, I added a roumalade from this site which was great and would be equally good on a burger.

It was really great and my daughter loved it,  tho she said to add more bacon next time.

My first time making crab cakes!  Super easy.  I used Blue Diamond gluten-free crackers (cheddar) instead of breadcrumbs.  Also added a dash of Worcestershire, a couple large shrimp to the crab claw meat (the package only had 6oz. of meat) and grilled them in my bbq on a slotted tray.  My co-worker, a crab cake snob, couldn't stop raving.  And my husband said, "You can make those again anytime".  Coming from a guy who hates tarragon, I guess I will!

We doubled the recipe. We never ate a crab cake w/o  Old Bay seasoning,  so we added about 2-tbsp.  We also substituted Panko for crackers. We made them into 5 fairly large balls. I melted the butter and put into a metal baking pan. I adjusted shelf in oven one above the middle and we broiled them til browned. We switched the oven to 400 degrees and cooked til done, about 5 minutes. We never had better crab cakes.

The 4-star rating would be a 5 if you asked all but one person in the family, me. It was a very simple recipe to duplicate, even with substitutions such as oregano replacing tarragon. The taste was good I'm simply a downer for imitation crab meat which was all we had. Being a very open-minded eater, capable of menudo, seasonal game, etc. I was surprised I didn't enjoy it more. The texture got to me a little, even though we used extra crackers to try & help hold it together. I would still recommend this as a fun "family-prep" meal item.

Good recipe, My family absolutely loved these and they only took minutes to prepare. It is really hard to find affordable crab meat that isn't that imitation stuff. Lately I've been ordering my crab meat from amazon, Trader Joe's brand is the best.

Wow! These are amazing! I have never made crab cakes before because I have tried them other places and didn't care too much for them. We had some left over crab legs, so I though I would give them a try. I am SO happy I did. My husband and I both loved them. I made the recipe the way it calls except that I didn't have any tarragon so I replaced that with basil. They turned out great! I cannot wait to make these again.

Probably some of the better crabcakes I've eaten. It's a relatively traditional/non suped-up recipe, but that's okay because the simple combo of butter, crab, and lemon are a pretty bomb-proof taste. I bet they'd be good with a little garlic or cilantro too, they seem like a good canvas for experimentation. I didn't have lemon on hand (I know, shameful) so I used lime instead but they were still great.

I made this tonight and it was delicious!! I will definitely make it again! I adjusted it a little to fit the ingredients I had on hand but it was wonderful, and I had never even eaten crab cakes before. It would also work very nicely with salmon. I used canned crabmeat and plain soda crackers. I didn't have tarragon so I used a very small pinch of curry powder instead. Loved it!!

I used gluten free bread crumbs instead of crackers. They definitely need a sauce on top. I suggest a creamy avocado sauce.

Just made this today. DELICIOUS. The only thing I did differently was add old bay seasoning, salt, and pepper. I had to add more bread crumbs outside if the buttery crackers to help hold it together. I will make again.

I enjoyed this recipe.  One of the other reviewers described it as having a mild taste.  I agree.  I couldn't taste the red pepper flakes.  I used chives because I had no green onions, so I think I'll use green onions next time.

Didn't have tarragon so I subbed Italian seasoning. I also doubled the recipe and broiled these for 10 minutes on each side to reduce fat. DELICIOUS. My husband gave them 5 out of 5 stars and he's a very tough sell. I'll be making these again!

I've made this recipe three times... I didn't add the lemon because I like lemon on the side. I also left out the tarragon because I don't like it. I also lightly sauteed regular saltines in 1/2 stick of unsalted butter to coat (but that's because I doubled the recipe). It was delicious!  My guests could not get enough of of them. I used a high quality fresh crab from the fish market. I never use imitation crab for anything.  Excellent recipe!

This was a good recipe. I am from Baltimore and we know our crabcakes! However, this one was delicious but maybe a bit more flavor. Garlic perhaps.

Fabulous recipe!  The only thing I added was to coat each crab cake in cracker crumbs.

Very tasty but bordering on too much filling. Added a little more crab to offset the mix and we were happy happy campers.

Really good, makes about 8.  Cooked for about 3 minutes on each side.  I added more red pepper flakes than the recipe suggested.  My mom thought they could have used a little more salt and pepper.  Fried in corn oil turned out great, really quick recipe.  I didn't premake the patties I just put a blob in the pan and squished it flat with my spoon.

So good. I made two batches. I used one and a half 6 oz. cans of crab and 3/4 cup crackers per batch. I served it with roasted asparagus and wild rice. Will make again!

It was ok -- we prefer Old Bay to tarragon -- The ratio of other stuff is about right.. -- Also make sure you check you crabmeat for shells -- even the stuff that is marked hand picked usually has a few.

These were delicious! Didn't have any tarragon but added a dash of Old Bay seasoning and dried mustard. I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks!

we had to use extra crackers b/c it was too runny, but aside from that it was easy and delicious.  we served with garlic aioli
