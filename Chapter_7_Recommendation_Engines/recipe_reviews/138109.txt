THank you so much for sharing this recipe! i have been looking for such a long time for it that i had given up. My husband is 1/2 filipino and was raised there so every so often he craves these delectable sausages. These are wonderful! Everyone loves them!

Awesome recipe, made as instructed first time second time I modified by adding brown sugar rather then white, 3 tbsp of soy sauce and 1 heaping tbsp of worcestershire  sauce, let melt in refrigerator for 12 hrs then froze and used when needed. Just awesome skinless as ground meat for a Sunday breakfast or mid week street tacos.
