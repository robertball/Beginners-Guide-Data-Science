This cake truly melts in your mouth. I have never tasted a cake this good. The one thing I did different is with the cake box recipe I used 1 1/2 cups of water. If we share this cake with everyone, there would truly be peace in the world...ok, maybe thats pushing it.

This cake was fairly easy to make. Frosting the cake was not easy for me;  perhaps my frosting wasn't as spreadable as it should be.  I also didn't have 1 Tbsp of red food coloring. I only had .25 oz; it worked out just fine though.  I would make this again if someone requests it.

This cake tasted more like chocolate cake. I will never use this recipe ever again. My husband said the frosting was t0o sweet.

I am rating this based on the cake recipe only, because I used store bought frosting - I liked that it used real chocolate which gives it a really dark color, rather than another recipe I tried which calls for pudding mix.  However, my friend that tried both cupcakes thinks this recipe is drier than the one that calls for pudding mix.  The color is perfect though and this received several compliments :)  These do bake up quite fluffy so only fill about 2/3 of the cup.
