Absolutely delicious!  I made several different nut recipes today, and this is the one I can't stop eating.  The only change I made was to use Splenda instead of sugar.  This is so good!!!  It's just slightly sweet and slightly spicy, which is a refreshing change from most recipes for nuts that are incredibly sweet or way too spicy -- plus, it's an interesting taste to have both in one recipe.

I just finished this Great recipe, made as directed. Yum! Very addictive, keep "tasting" while they are cooling. So far it seems the sugar will stay on nicely when I jar them.  Others I made a lot of sugar mix was at the bottom of the jar.  I think the honey makes it stick well.  I tried a few with some cinnamon they were super as well.  Will add the cinnamon for the holidays. Recommend!
UPD: sugar stayed on & didn't end up in the bottom of my jar....a winner!

Simple Recipe. I made a few changes for what I had on hand. I toasted the almonds on the stove for about 5 mins (watch them carefully. I halved the recipe. I used honey instead of the sugar- so they stayed a little sticky- that shouldn't be a problem if you use the sugar. The coating made just the right amount for the almonds. Not too sweet and the pepper adds just a touch of heat. I'll probably put in more next time.

I made these last night for the first time and they are great! I followed the instructions exactly and they were very easy to make. After tossing the almonds in the liquid, I used a slotted spoon to move them to the spice mixture. There was some extra liquid left in the pan, and I didn't want to dump all that into the spices. These really are addictive! I think they may steal the show at Thanksgiving this year.

Love these - very addicting. I had tons of nuts and seeds that I wanted to use up (brazil nuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans) so I added them all. You can definitely make these with any nuts/seeds and it's delicious.  Next time I may add a smidge more cayenne.

This was fantastic!  My only suggestions would be to drain the extra liquid before adding the sugar mixture (to avoid clumps of sugar) and to stir occasionally while cooling to keep the almonds from becoming a solid mass.  It was quite sticky and wet at first so I stuck it in the oven at 250 for a while, but in the end it was still wet and sticky until it had cooled.  The oven probably wasn't necessary.

This was easy and fantastic. Although i did find the sugar/salt/spices mixture to be a bit much so i gradually added it in and ended up using half of what the recipe called for. I also added a bit of cinnamon and some ground tamarind for an extra tang. for the liquid mixture i added maple syrup instead of honey. it really added a lil extra magic to the entire recipe! Delicious!! i'm eating them right now!!

So good! I added another teaspoon of cayenne because I like spicy. Next time I might cut down the sugar just a little bit.

Delicious!  Tweaked it by swapping white sugar for cane sugar and macadamian oil for olive oil, and reduced the cayenne to 1/2t.  Oh, we also did a combination of cashews and almonds!  Loved it!

Just made these as a Christmas gift for a Korean guy at work who loves the habanero bbq spiced almonds you can buy at the grocery store. I doubled the cayenne (the man eats jalepenos on his sandwiches) and accidentally used 2 tsp of salt rather than the 11/2 called for.  After they cooled, I sampled a few and couldn't stop. Let's just say that it's a good thing I bought a big bag of almonds at Sam's! They are wonderful, I considered trying Chipotle Chili powder for the cayenne as a change, but why mess with perfection?

I made this exactly as the recipe called for.  They were delicious...just the right amount of sweetness and heat.  They were a little sticky, but not enough to keep them from being a 5-star.

I made mostly as directed.  I let the liquid mixture boil for a minute before adding the almonds, then I kept cooking the liquid/almond mixture over the heat another minute or so to cook out the remaining liquid.  I then tossed the hot nuts into the sugar.  The sugar became more of a crunchy glaze over the nuts which I liked, but I may let the nuts cool slightly next time & see how that tastes.  LOVE this recipe!!

Very easy and tasty. I accidentally did a tablespoon of cayenne ... Oops! Still good but will do less next time. Perfect for holiday parties and cubicle snacking. I added roasted soy beans because I didn't know what else to do with them!

Loved the flavor (I added a dash of cinnamon to the cayenne, salt, and sugar mixture) but hated the sticky/gooey mess that resulted at the end.  They made a complete mess of your fingers and as a result were not fun to eat.  Will maybe try again by spraying the almonds with cooking spray, then coating them with the sugar, salt, cayenne, and cinnamon mixture then baking them.  As the recipe is written, however, I will not make it again.

These are soooo good!  I made them for a group of people on New Years Eve and everyone loved them and couldn't stop eating them.  The sweetness and the heat were perfect!  The only thing I did different was I only added 1 tsp. salt because I didn't have Kosher salt, only sea salt (table salt).  I will be making these often!

I doubled the recipe, added the hot almonds right out of the oven into the saucepan, mixed together until all liquid was absorbed then added them to the sugar/spice mixture ( I added cinnamon). I let them cool to room temp. No problem. Wonderful recipe.

My husband can't stop eating them, he already asked if we still have almonds because I'll have to make it again, lol. Thanks for the recipe!

I absolutely love this recipe.  I can't stop eating them....never enough to share ...lol.   I follow the recipe until the last step.  After I have added the almonds to the mixture on the stove I just sprinkle the sugar/salt/cayenne pepper combination into the pan and stir to coat.  Turn the heat off of the pan and once they are coated put onto baking sheet to cool.  Seem sticky at first , but they have always set up for me as they cool.  I have tried many other nuts and combination of nuts and they all work fine.  I have also used cinnamon rather than the cayenne pepper and it is wonderful too !!  I wonder if you used some kind of sugar substitute other than honey , since there is already honey in the recipe, if that would work??

These are very good. It's hard to stop eating them. I would recommend mixing the dry ingredients and pouring them over the almonds because otherwise it's hard to get it all mixed onto the nuts.

Love it, though I use less cayenne than it calls for since one can always add more later. I drain the extra liquid from the almonds, then toss the sugar & spice mixture in the pan. My husband gobbles these up like kurazay.

I made these last Night. They were good but I added more salt. Next time I will add a little salt to the honey mixture, because I dont think they were salty enough.

Loved this recipe!  Had company coming in about 1-1/2 hours and wanted something to make plain almonds more exciting to serve.  The recipe was super easy and when done I put it into the cold garage on a cookie sheet to speed up the cooling process.  First time making it some of the dry ingredients clumped and didn't disburse evenly.  I may try either a bit less liquid or sprinkling dry ingredients over moistened almonds then mix to avoid clumping.  Not overly sweet and has a nice bite without being too spicy.  Recipe is a keeper.

Really good and easy too. Not too spicy, just a little bite at the end. Terrific as an appetizer or to have on hand for snacking.  We put in a zip lock bag to toss, made prep even faster.

Very simple recipe, with delicious results. I tried the recipe w both whole and sliced almonds - the sliced are more versatile. Lightly sweet and spicy, these nuts are great in salads, on chicken, in breads, and best of all...by themselves in big handfuls!

These almonds were very addicting . After mixing the salt, sugar, & cayenne I gave it a taste. It was too salty and spicy for my taste, so I made adjustments and they turned out very good.

Used brown sugar instead, didn't have white sugar. Turned out amazing and yes addictive. Good thing almonds are filling so you really can't do too many.

Sweet, salty & spicy - something for everyone.  I was able to make this in a short time while dinner was baking in the oven.  May daughter and I both liked this.  Will definitely make it again to share with friends and family.

Great snack I make it all the time, I have added two extra ingredients to mix in with the dry ingredients.

1/2 tsp of cinnamon
1/8 tsp Sriracha spice - it give a nice smoky flavour taste and to kick it up a notch.
everyone just love them!!

This was very easy to make and quite tasty. I did find it a bit spicy and we'll use a bit less cayenne pepper next time. I used Sola in place of sugar.

Made these almonds for a Christmas snack but made two small changes.  I added just a dusting of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  After coating the nuts with the sugar mixture, I places them back into the 350 degree oven for about 5 minutes until the sugar melted and coated the nuts (careful not to over bake them as they burn quickly).  This made them much neater to eat (no sugar on your fingers) and gave them additional crunch.  They were a bit hit.  Even better the next day!  I'll definitely make these again.

I am pleasantly surprised! I tried this recipe to use up some almonds i had and wanted to use ingredients I had on hand. My husband can't stop eating them! I ended up having 3 cups so I had to make more of the liquid mixture and sugar mixture. I did everything as directed and they are awesome! I highly recommend!!!

followed recipe exactly..flavor is EXCELLENT... perfect balance of sweet/salty/spice.. whole family loved them. but, even after cooling, they remained too sticky to be able to store well. Fortunately, they were so tasty don't have to worry about that this time but will need to figure that out for next time.

I've been making this recipe for years. So easy and delicious. My go to "take along" to holiday parties. At least 15 people have asked me for the recipe. I always double the recipe and use equal amounts of both pecans and almonds. The only other change I make is that the original recipe is waaay too salty. I cut back the salt by 1/2 tsp for the single recipe and by 1tsp when doubling.

Totally yummy. Perfect amount of sweet and hot. I had a variety of almonds to use up, some were roasted and salted, so I only used a teaspoon of kosher salt in the coating. I followed another reviewers advice and used a slotted spoon to transfer the nuts from the liquid to the final coating, although I didn't seem to have an excess of liquid. I stirred the nuts several times as they were cooling and I was surprised at how well the sugar/spice coating stays on the nuts. Will make again for sure!!

I was looking for something easy, but tasty to take to a women's retreat and this was a major HIT. Several ladies thought the nuts were store bought and practically everyone asked for the recipe when they found out they weren't. 

They do not taste "hot' at all, so no worries there if you are sensitive to spicy foods.

I used whole almonds and they took about 12 minutes to toast. Be careful not to get too much of the liquid on the nuts, otherwise the sugar/spice coating gets a little soupy.  They kept fine all weekend in a lidded glass jar on the counter.

We are on our 5th batch in two weeks. They are addictive, not too salty, not too sweet.  The first batch was a little sticky so I baked them a little longer the next time.  If your almonds are not roasted when you buy them, be sure to roast them before    you use the recipe.

Quick and easy. I had expected more of the sugar mixture to cling to the almonds. I was hoping they would be spicier: I like a lot of heat. Next time I would increase the amount of cayenne if I  were making them for myself. As a gift for someone who is less tolerant of heat, the recipe is fine as-is.

These were superb!!! Wow and so easy to make! I am not a cook or baker so really anyone can mak these.   Recipe is perfect.  Only change was I didn't have  olive oil so used vegetable oil.  I had the perfect amount of liquid, followed recipe exactly and measured all ingredients.
I had to go buy more almonds as want to put in treat gift bags and share with others.
These will become an annual Xmas  traditionI

These were so easy to make! The measurements and directions are spot on! Made these for a baby shower. Only issue is you will make several batches, so keep your ingredients out. Thanks for sharing! Yum yum!

When I put the dry mix together I thought it was going to be way too spicy.  However, once I made them and let them cool, I found them to be delicious.  I am going to make more and package them nicely to go in with Christmas gifts for my daughters -- they love spicy things.

This was so simple and turned out great!  I keep in mind what others said about the amount of liquid, but I didn't have an issue.  I made it as written.  The one thing I did do was hold out some of the sugar spice mix.  After ?I put the almonds in the bowl with the remaining spice I sprinkled the part that I reserved over the top and then tossed.  It made coating all the almonds easier.   Great recipe.

I've made these twice now (the second time a mix of pecans and almonds)They are fantastic and crazy addicting! The ONLY thing I do differently is make sure all the left over pooled liquid at the bottom dissipates before dumping into the sugar mixture.

i made these to go on a spinach salad along with goat cheese and raspberry vinaigrette dressing. delish! i cuz the sugar in half, added some garlic powder and a bit of cinnamon. will definitely make again. 
i don't know why people say it was too wet - the amount of liquid was very small and coated the nuts just enough to get the spice mixture to stick. yum!

Followed recipe almost exactly (used regular table salt, because we didn't have kosher. And only used 1 tsp of it).  Delicious, yet easy to make.  Just the right amount of heat for us too.  This recipe is on my list of favorites now.

Based on other reviews, I added a bit more cayenne as well as some cinnamon.  Didn't have any honey, so used maple syrup and came out fine.  Next time I might scale back on the cayenne, though--the heat's fine for me, but not sure about the people I'm planning on giving them to.

Was a favorite at my Christmas Open House. I used cinnamon instead of cayenne and substituted pecans for the almonds. Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Wow! So simple.. Since I didnt't have all the ingredients, I substituted sea salt for the kosher salt and sage honey for the plain honey. It is definitely addictive and not too spicy, just the right kick. Other than that, I followed the rest of the recipe.

AMAZING!  Followed it exactly - was shocked at how easy it was to do (I've burned nuts before trying to make these sorts of nibbles).  We snacked on them for Thanksgiving and for days afterwards.  Now I'm gearing up to make them again for Christmas.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Wow - so good!  I am not a 'spicy' person, so I halved the cayenne pepper.  Enjoyable with just the right amount of heat for me.  Even my husband, who likes spicy food, thought there was enough.  After I put the almonds in the honey mixture, I kept stirring it on the stove for a minute before dumping them in the sugar mixture.  They turned out perfect.
