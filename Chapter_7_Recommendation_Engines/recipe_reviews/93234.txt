yum!  i used cornstarch instead of the flour it called for and it worked just as well.  instead of boiling the pecans in sugar water, try toasting them in a sauce pan with 2 tbsp of butter and then 2-3 tbsp of brown sugar.

Oh my gosh! I *absolutely love* honey walnut shrimp, but I didn't think that the recipe would be as simple as this. Like my display name says, I'm clueless when it comes to cooking. The only part that took me a while to get down was separating the egg whites, but other than that, if you're craving for some honey walnut shrimp, THIS is the recipe to use!

Also, don't forget about the cabbage! Just shred some cabbage and spread it on the bottom of your container. After you coat the shrimp with the sauce, the cabbage can catch the extra sauce, and you've got yourself a delicious salad!

This is hands down the best thing I have ever done with shrimp!  Maybe even better than PF Chang's version.  I like my walnuts crispy, so I threw them in the hot oil for a moment (maybe 10-20 seconds) after boiling with sugar. Note that this will dirty the oil a bit, so if you are concerned with presentation you might want to use fresh oil for the shrimp. I used cornstarch instead of the rice flour, and mixed to an "Elmer's Glue" consistency. The batter was enough for a pound and a half of shrimp, but if you use that much you'll need to double the sauce.  I never quite got the shrimp to a golden brown color, but I pulled the shrimp after six minutes and they were fine.  The batter is bland, but it lets the sauce showcase itself.  I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce for a bit of tang, and served with honeydew melon chunks. Will be making again!

I registered just to rate this recipe. Honestly this taste better then some restaurants Iâ€™ve had this dish at. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit. The effort should be made to use mochiko because it has a different texture that corn starch or flour can not duplicate. My husband suggested that I use the egg white mochiko mixture to coat chicken and make orange chicken. Thanks for sharing I will diffidently be making this again.

The question of authenticity is difficult because of regional variations.  I would say that this recipe is not what I would prefer.  It's too greasy and too sweet.  My preferences run toward light, flavorful, subtleties, and this dish, as listed, does not fulfill that requirement.  A far better method for treating shrimp in this manner is the standard wash of the walnuts in 1 cup of water and 1/3 cup of sugar.  Forget the egg white batter--it brings the wrong texture to this dish.  Instead, a very light egg wash with corn starch and panko is spot on, and the dip should be made minus the condensed milk with a very small touch of pressed garlic, so that you have what is essentially a very lightly touched aioli sauce with a honey sweetened linger on the palate.  That's the way you improve on what has been lost in translation.

I used another recipe for the egg white mixture.  1/2 egg white.  1/2 cup cornstarch.  Make sure to add shrimp to oil individually so they don't stick togehter.  Used Missy's Candied Walnut recipe to cook walnuts.

I used cornstarch instead of the mochiko...a little more than 2/3 cup to make it pasty and doubled the recipe for the sauce. My husband said it was really good and my daughter asked me to make more sauce next time. Tasted just like a dish I usually get at my favorite chinese restaurant.

Thanks so much, great recipe. I've been looking for this recipe for a long time now, and I'll look no further! The proportions were just right. One thing I did do differently was to cut the large shrimp into smaller bite-size pieces. They fry fast, and the yummy sauce sticks more evenly. Just like the restaurant! Yum-yum!

I used regular flour and meringue powder/water equivalent instead of the listed ingredients. I liked the fact that the shrimp coating did not get soggy after the sauce was added. I also doubled the sauce recipe to make sure there was enough. I deep fried the walnuts for about 3 mins in addition to 
the boiling in sugar to make them crispy. The first thing my picky husband said was "This is heaven, it tastes exactly like the restaurant!" This one's a keeper.  Thanks so much.

So delicious, even tho' we aren't big on mayonnaise. Small adjustments & tips: NUTS: Unless you want soft & uncandied nuts, reduce water to approx. 1/2 cup so it's a syrup. Make in advance enough so that it has time to air-dry after draining. Altho' very lightly candied, I then fried them for about 15 seconds, after frying the shrimp. BATTER: Rather than be left w/ 4 yolks, I used powdered egg whites/meringue to make the equivalent of 4 whites. (2 tsp. powder + 2 Tblsp. water= 1 white). Since I didn't have mochiko, I used approx. 2 parts plain rice flour to  1 part cornstarch. Yielded a mostly crisp, partly soft coating. Tossed in 1/8 tsp. Aleppo (hot red chile) pepper; it wasn't noticeable, so will add more next time to contrast the sweet sauce & bland batter. SAUCE: I doubled the sauce, but a 50% increase would've been better, as I didn't use it all. I heated the sauce in last few minutes.  FRYING: I used a deep fryer because it has a temperature gauge. 350 F worked nicely. Add shrimp 1-2 at a time to avoid them clumping. Fry in several batches. 31+ shrimp per pound is a good size to have a shrimp in almost every bite! SERVING: Add shrimp & nuts to sauce at serving time, so they don't get soggy. I served it on individual portions of rice with a garnish of sliced green onions - for much needed color, & a delicious extra taste. Asian stir-fried broccoli & carrots on the side completed the meal. ~Serving it on a bed of shredded cabbage or lettuce is a good alternative.

I've made honey walnut shrimp 4 times now, using two different recipes.  I like this sauce recipe best and I'm VERY happy to be turned onto the mochiko, it has made all the difference!  My fav. restaurant recipe has shrimp with the faintest coating, which I was finally able to duplicate by simply dusting/dredging the shrimp in nothing but the mochiko (no egg whites).  I've tried cornstarch = tasted like cornstarch..... flour/cornstarch + beaten egg whites= WAY heavy breading, not like my rest. fav.  ALSO, the mochiko by iteself will make it look like the pic., and the recipe takes like 2 minutes to make without the egg whites!  I use the candied walnuts from the produce section, so much easier.  And I add about 4 tbsp milk to a doubled sauce recipe to stretch and keep the sauce from being so gooey.  DON'T forget the cabbage, it is amazing with the sauce!

I have made this many times and have served it in restaurants and home and everyone always loves it!  First thing is camelize your nuts in butter and brown sugar don't boil in water.  I mix the entire can of milk with 2 T miracle whip and 2T honey.  After I fry my shrimp I toss it the sauce which I heat in microwave just enough to warm a little as shrimp will be warm.  I serve over rice that I pepper as the pepper works as a balance to the sweet.  I add green onions to rice a must for taste and color.

Very tasty. Kind of time consuming, but maybe I just went about it strangely. My suggestions- deep fry the walnuts at the end for just a few minutes to give them some crunch. Make the sauce before you start frying- the shrimps don't fry that long. To coat all the shrimp easily, dump them into the mix, mix them in with your hand, and pull them out, shake a little, and drop into oil. Doing them one at a time was killing my soul. I served this in bowls individually and let people dish the sauce as they wanted- delicious! (I also used the mochiko- it gave it a wonderful flavor that I think cornstarch wouldn't.)

Just tried out this recipe with all the inlaws and what a hit! Here is what I did. I used chicken instead of shrimp, and I used an elctric mixer on low to make the batter. I do NOT recomend using cornstarch, I did a test run with a little batter on some potatoes and the batch I made without c.s. was perfect. The one with c.s. was too tough.  I used regular rice flour as well. This batter worked so well I deep fried a bannana :D the sauce is phenominal. I made 2 test batches too; one with fat free con. milk and light mayo (Helmin's always) and it was just as good. All in all, this recipe is a winner. Did I mention I have a wheat gluten allergy, so nice to have battered anything!

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes. Thank you so much for sharing. I use only 3 egg whites since the 4th egg white seems to make the batter taste too eggy. Also, I boil the walnuts with brown sugar instead of white sugar with a tablespoon of water. This way the brown sugar sticks to the walnuts and adds a little more of a caramelized appeal.

my husband and i loved this! we didn't think it was too sweet,as others had mentioned. the mixture was perfect for just one pound of shrimp! bought regular rice flour at the 99 Ranch Market for only 99cents :)
and for people complaining about what to do with a can (minus a tbs) of condensed milk ... there are a thousand recipes you can use it (its not going to make or break a recipe if you're short 1 tbs!) i used the rest for the Mounds Bar Recipe ;)

I've made this dish a few times and I think it's amazing!  I know some people thought it was a little sweet, but that's contingent on who's tasting it.  I would suggest starting with half the amount of honey and sweetened milk first and adding more according.  But I love it!!!

OHHH  MYYYY  GOODNESSSS!!!    This was sensational!!!  I only changed three things based on cook's reviews.    #1.  I cut the honey down by 25%.    #2.  I could not find the Mochiko rice flour locally so I tried the cornstarch in the whipped egg whites suggestion. It worked!    #3.  I made the candied walnuts from in here that another cook suggested (Dawn's Candied Walnuts).  I served it over a pre-packaged shredded salad mix which was easy and super DELISH!   I would not let my hub come into the kitchen until I served it...and he was blown away at the flavor!  He was "humming" while he ate..LOLOL    This was AS GOOD as what we get at our local Chinese restaurant!      Try this.......it's worth the effort FOR SURE!*********************** PS~ FINALLY FOUND MOCHIKO FLOUR- it was not with the regular flour at the store.  It was hiding in the ethnic area of the store where they have soy sauce, chestnuts, Nori, Asian noodles etc.  It comes in a small box.

This was great!  I had this same thing from a local Chinese resturant and was so impressed, I wanted to make it myself.  This is it exactly.  It's a pain in the butt to make, but so worth the effort.  you won't be disappointed.  Thanks.

Tastes exactly like P.F. Chang's version! I added honeydew balls because that's what the restaurant does & served white rice with it. The Mochiko flour is a MUST!  I found it at our neighborhood Albertson's. I made the recipe exactly as written except to cut down on time, I bought the walnuts already candied! It was so yummy...BIG hit!!!

I noticed that most people used cornstarch instead of the mochiko....which is what I should have probably done but I like to try something new.  I followed the recipe nearly exactly except for the batter, following the recipe you WILL get a pasty texture but how are you supposed to dip shrimp in paste? Riiiiighhhhtttt, anyways I ended up adding ice water about 1 cup and pretty much had the same consistency as tempura batter.  I also need to add....to NOT fry the shrimp for 5 minutes like this recipe says.  Shrimp will overcook guaranteed and it will be not good (I tested one shrimp of course, FAIL).  I recommend frying on high for 35 sec- 1 min minute, if ur using peanut oil or fry at medium high for 1-1.5 min using vegetable oil.

Even better than the restaurants!  I thinned out the sauce by adding about a tbsp. of 1% milk and I only ended up using half the sauce.  I didn't have mochiko flour, but I had tapioca starch, so I used that and the shrimp were light and crispy and soooo good!  I too used the shortcut by getting Trader Joe's candied walnuts and they were just right.  One last thing... this dish is really rich!  The recipe says that it serves four, but I can't imagine eating 1/4 of this.  I ate about eight shrimp (71/90 count) and was in heaven, but I knew to draw the line there!

It will take a couple tries to get it right...The sauce is great! However, the walnuts are very hard to perfect. They burnt on me!
EDIT: a few years later...I did not burn the walnuts, but they weren't very sweet. I fried them up really quick, and they only tasted sweet and yummy when mixed with the sauce. The proportions of the sauce are a little bit off -- just play with it until it tastes good. The directions and proportions of the breading is perfect, just make sure your oil is hot enough and use mochiko, it really was perfect!

This was amazing! Walnut prawns is quite an expensive dish so I was thrilled that this recipe came out as well as what I would get at a restaurant. I use Dawn's candied walnuts for this dish, wish are much closer to what you'll find in a restaurant. Also, for the sauce I used about half condensed milk to half mayo so it's not too mayo tasting. Use jumbo shrimp or prawns to get the full restaurant effect.

Very good dish. My family and i agreed that the honey taste was too strong so i would suggest next time use a little more mayo and less honey. But even with the strong honey taste it was still a delicious dish.

This was freaking DIVINE. Please, please, please get some raw organic honey(Trader Joes or your local Farmers Market) to make this with!  It is so much tastier and more complex than supermarket honey and that is why I think mine tasted better than any like it I had tried before. 

Because I am not fond of carbs, I will try it without the breading next time.  Maybe just a dusting in rice flour would do, I believe that is how my local restaurant makes it. 

You know what I will do the next time I want to impress a guest? Make this dish.  You know what I will do the next time I want to drown my sorrows?  Make a double order.

Make the sauce a day ahead of time, the night I made this for dinner it was okay but nothing special, after letting the flavors meld overnight the leftovers had me licking my plate. I don't recommend making a cornstarch batter, use the special flour or a tempura if you need to substitute.

This recipe was decent. The batter was way to eggy, and wouldn't adhere to the shrimp...a lot of it came off during frying and didn't reach that golden color (as pictured) without overcooking the shrimp. Perhaps dredging the shrimp in rice flour before battering would help, but not sure what to do to make the batter itself less eggy. The sauce calls for way to much honey. I recommend decreasing the honey by half. Save yourself some time and use purchased glazed walnuts. Some reviewers stated that they couldn't find Mochico rice flour. Is is available in Asian markets, or ion most major grocery stores, usually in the "ethnic foods" section. It comes in a small, white box (about the size of a Mac N Cheese box.) Also stated in many reviews is that the battered shrimp was bland, Yes, but the sauce compensates for that. Note that the sauce is sweet and this dish should be served with something to counter-balance that. I served it atop a bed of cabbage...actually, I used a bag of the pre-shredded coleslaw mix (from the produce section.)  Overall, good recipe, but needs some tweaking. If anyone has any suggestion as to how to make the batter any better, please share!

This was pretty darn good!  I took a couple of the reviewer's tips and did the following:  Used about half the mayo and a little more condensed milk.  Also doubled the sauce.  And used cornstarch instead of the mochiko called for.  Will definitely make this again!

This was so yummy and very close to the taste of my favorite dish at a restaurant.  I used cornstarch instead of mochiko flour and sauteed the walnuts after boiling to make them crispier.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, now I can re-create the dish on my own without having to go out!

OH MY GOSH!!! I love this! This is my favorite dish to get when we go out to eat and I've spent forever trying to get the recipe. Well I've finally found it! I would not change a thing on the recipe. The only thing I did was made extra sauce just in case. My whole family loved it and I even made extra for our lunches the next day. My husband called me from work just to express again how much he loved it. This is the best recipe yet! If your contemplating about trying it don't be. Its very easy. You may have to go to an oriental market to get the rice flour, but besides that it's so simple. You wont be disappointed. I guartantee it!

I made this for my mom who was yearning for PF Changâ€™s version.  It turned out pretty good; the rice flour really makes a difference.  You do need the condensed milk so donâ€™t substitute it with milk or Â½ and Â½.  I thought it was a little dry at first so I added more sauce.  That was a mistake.  Had I left it alone it would have been great.  The shrimp were very light and tasty.

These were great. The only errors were my own. Next time I will make more batter to really coat the shrimp, and cut off the tails so it's easier to eat. I did have to thin the Mochiko though with a little extra water to make it thin enough to dip the shrimp.

Very very good.  Just like the restaurants if not better.  I couldn't find the moshico flour and tried the cornstarch like every said, but I didn't like the corn taste, so instead I used tempura batter and it was SOOOO much better.  I doubled the sauce with light mayo and it was perfect.  Next time I might try putting the walnuts in the oven to make it more crunchier, but either way is fine.

This recipe definately needs some tweaking. I made it once following step by step and the sauce was WAY too thick for me. The 2nd time I made it I used panko bread crumbs instead of the rice flour. I also used the same recipe for the sauce but added a few ingredients, I also put them into a sauce pan on Low heat. I added a little little splash of Grand Manier and then slowly stirred in  1% milk to get the sauce to a thinner consitency that I like.  I mixed butter and brown sugar and melted it in the microwave then tossed the walnuts in and spread it all on a cookie sheet bake it on 400 for about 5 min. Yummy!!

Overall, the recipe was just what I was looking for.  We enjoy honey walnut shrimp at the Chinese restaurants so I thought I would try to make it at home.  The walnuts did not turn out crunchy as I had expected but it wasn't a huge letdown as the walnuts are not the highlight of this dish.  The sauce was really good - identical to what you get in the restaurant.  The advantage of making it at home is that you can vary how much sauce you want to use on the shrimp -- I know that sometimes the restaurants pile it on!  As for the shrimp batter - I took an easy shortcut by using prepackaged tempura batter - the end result was a light crispy batter that was perfect for this dish.

LOVE this one! Honey loves it too! Just as good as PA**DA EX***SS! My only change: after battering the shrimp, roll in Panko crumbs, then deep fry. They stay crispy after tossing in the sauce! OK, too many exclamation points. But this one is a favorite.

I recently had honey walnut shrimp for the first time on vacation in 
Oahu's Chinatown.  My friend loved it so much that we decided to try to duplicate it using your recipe.  I made some adjustments, during and after tasting it.  I used 1/4 cup of corn starch to 4 whipped egg whites and had quite a bit left over even tho I used more than a pound and a half of 21/26 shrimp.  I would start with 2 beaten egg whites and add enough corn starch to make a fairly thin, but not soupy batter in the future.  The shredded cabbage is a must!  It adds texture and makes the presentation quite attractive and tastes great as other reviewers have mentioned, by catching and holding the sauce.  I doubled the sauce recipe and adjusted the taste by squeezing a 1/4 fresh lemon to add some lightness. Regarding the walnuts - I dissolved the sugar in 1/2 cup water and boiled for 5 minutes.  Drained and dried on a cookie sheet. I didn't think they needed further treatment.  I will definitely make this recipe again and will likely also use it with chicken as others have suggested.

Ugh, I hate writing bad reviews.

At first, I was very enthusiastic and hyped up about this dish. I had eaten Honey Walnut Shrimp before in a Chinese Restaurant, and wanted to make it at home. I was unfortunately very disappointed...
The fry batter around the shrimp was very thin and  rough--very uncomfortable to eat. The walnuts were not candied at all--very bland to eat.
The sauce was not my type.

Maybe I'm just not a Honey Walnut Shrimp fan. Because of my experience I will not be eating/cooking any shrimp-based dishes soon.

Absolutely love this when I go out to dinner so thought I'd try to make it.  Success!  It was so easy and tasty.  The sauce was ridiculously simple to make and so very good.    At prep time I thought I had prawns, but when I opened the frozen shrimp they were the little ones for like a Shrimp Louie salad.  I was worried it wouldn't work, but I tossed them in the mochiko & egg white batter then into the fry pan.  Some stuck together and made little shrimp clusters, but being coated and fried it did not negatively impact the taste.  Drained the clusters, mixed them into the creamy sauce.  I served it over steamed rice garnished with the walnuts.

If you are going for the PF Changs version omit the egg white and mochiko and just dust with corn starch.  Then saute in a 3T of oil instead of deep fry.  I also left the honey out because the honeydew was so sweet and the honey turned the sauce brown.  The sauce is just 1/4c mayo and 2T lemon juice add some condensed milk if your honeydew isn't sweet.  Heat honeydew just until hot and serve immediately with Diamond candied walnuts as a garnish.  SIX STARS for my version

Very easy and great tasting.  I only used 1/2 tablespoon of the sweet condensed milk and it was enough.

This is a very good, sweet side dish to your chinese meal!.. I made only two changes;  putting the sugar over the walnuts in a pan without the water...  Let the sugar melt and it begins to carmalize.  Also, I didn't have rice flour so I used white flour and it worked fine!  I dumped all the shrimp right into the batter, stirred them in and then plopped them out one at a time into the oil... Turned them over once.  The rest of the dish I followed exactly to a T!  I served over a bed of shredded cabbage mix and along with steamed white rice.  I will make this again!

I've been looking for this recipe for a while so I'm very glad to have found it.   There is just one thing, the restaurants that I have been to that have it, it looks nothing like the photo in the main recipe.   The pics in Joanna S. is EXACTLY what I'm looking for.   How do I get it to not look like shrimp in a pile of mayo?   Simply not add as much?  Any suggestions?

I've made this recipe twice now, and the only thing I changed the second time around was using less of the mochiko and more water to make the breading. It made the shrimp easier to coat when the mixture was a little less pasty and a little more soupy. This is such a good recipe, we love it! Thank you!

this was wonderful! my boyfriend was so excited to come home to this meal. I used the candied walnuts you can buy in the snack section of the grocery store instead of making my own.we doubled the sauce recipe, and its really good over rice too! (i also made the Local Kine Wontons from this site, which were excellent!)

This is truly a restaurant quality recipe!  The glut. rice flour makes the world of difference and the shrimp even crisp up perfectly in the toaster oven for leftover.  I toss the shrimp in the sauce over a low heat so the whole dish was heated through and the sauce thinned a bit.  SO good!

Don't over beat the egg whites or your batter will be too dry.  If that happens add a little water to thin.  I added about twice as much mayo, but I think that's because I wanted the sauce to taste more like our local Chinese take outs.  Otherwise, extremely pleased!  Walnut shrimp is one of the most expensive dishes on the menu.

Oh. My. Goodness. I have made this several times now b/c it is amazing! I think it tastes better than the restaurant version! When I discovered how EASY this was to make I was dumbfounded! Even my boyfriend thought it was simple! I definitely make sure to take all the tails off the shrimp. The first time I made this it was so messy! I have learned since then! I make sure to use spoons to place the shrimp in the oil. I play around with the sauce until I like the taste. I sometimes omit the walnuts if I don't have them. And I use "Missy's Candied Walnuts" recipe for them when I do make them. An all around awesome recipe!

Just what I wanted! Took others' advice and first dipped the shrimp in the egg white, then tossed it in the rice flour before frying. Kept the oil really hot so it browned quickly and stayed crispy. I doubled the sauce recipe but it was really too much. Next time - since I know there will be a next time! - I'll stick with the amount called for.

The sauce tasted perfect but it was thick and pasty and hard to "toss" with the shrimp.   I wish it had the consistency to "drizzle" over the shrimp and then toss it. I would make twice as much sauce next time for 1 lb. of shrimp.

This dish was super easy and incredible. The only thing that was weird was the rice flour and egg white mixture - it did become a paste and then how can you dip? I added some water and blended it in and it was perfect. We have shrimp allergies in our family, so we made this with chicken which was fantastic. We'll be making this again soon!

I made this tonight for dinner and I thought it was okay while my family really enjoyed it! I made a few tiny changes to the recipe. I added about a tbsp. or less of honey into the walnut sugar syrup after it was done boiling, drained and put them in the oven on 350 for about 10-15 min or until it was golden, A LOT better than just boiled sugar. Added a tbsp less honey to the sauce and a little more mayo. Turned out pretty good but I wish the batter was more crispy, didn't want rubbery shrimp so I did not cook it for 5 min in oil.

This was actually better the next day!!! Why? Because some of the honey had separated out of the sauce. I would recommend using much less honey than in the recipe. Don't be fooled by the time either, it took me over an hour to make it. Otherwise, it's probably one of the best dinners I've made, and I will make it again.

WOW, this is good!  This is really good with fried or white rice. I would double the sauce and would toast the walnuts in the oven instead of putting them in the sugar water. I will make this again.

THIS IS FABULOUS !!!  Make This as written. Make sure you use rice flour. Fry at 350 deg. Shrimp stay crisp even when sauce is put on. Love it, Love it. My kids even loved it.

I made this last night with some changes. I cut the breasts lengthwise in half, pounded them a bit, added seasonings and dusted them with Wondra. Browned in butter and olive oil. When they were brown and crispy on both sides and cooked through, I removed them to a warm plate, added a bit more olive oil and a couple of tablespoons to Wondra. I let that brown some, added some chicken broth and when the sauce had thickened, I added some lemon. Served the breasts with the lemony sauce and also served a side dish of the new steamer bag veggies which had some potatoes in it along with green beans.  It was delish!

Very easy and very good!  I ran out of mochiko but flour worked just fine.  I added more flour to get the right consistency.  I will line the cointaner with shredded cabbage next time just as someone else suggested and just like the Chinese restaurants do it.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!!!!!!

Loved this!  It tasted just like the restaurants make!  I used candied walnuts that I bought from Trader Joe's, instead of boiling the walnuts.   I also would have liked more sauce.  I served with rice and broccoli.

VERY sweet. We cut the amounts of sugar and honey down to almost half and they still turned out very sweet. Couldn't find mochiko either, so I used plain flour...my end result didn't turn out too well. Luckily the shrimp weren't too expensive where I got them from but I will not be making this again.

Absolutely yummy! This is my favorite dish at a local restaurant and it tastes just about the same. I will use less mayo and more milk next time, also will heat shrimp with sauce for a warm meal. My neighbors LOVED this. (My hubby hates shrimp) I will make it for a girls night for sure! Thanks Celia for the awesome dish!

too much mayo, and i really love mayo. but it just made it unappetizing. and i added a good amount of cayenne for some kick, since it was simply too boring without it. i've never ordered this in a restaurant, and i can see where another recipe for the same dish would be good, but this one just doesn't strike me as the one.

Loved it! My bf and I love this at a local Chinese restaurant and he'd been wanting me to try to make it for awhile.  This was the perfect recipe, with a few small changes.  I didn't have mochiko so I used regular rice flour.  However, I used 3 egg whites instead of four, whipped until nice and foamy.  Then, I added the rice flour (didn't measure, just stirred until a thick paste).  Because I love the texture at our fav restaurant, I wanted a sort of tempura batter, so I also added Sprite...again, I didn't measure, just poured and blended until it had about the consistency of elmer's glue.  I also seasoned my shrimp. The last tweak I did was to the walnuts.  I boiled water and sugar, but also added about a teaspoon of honey.  I threw in the walnuts and let them cook until the sugar water had cooked down to a syrup.  I let the walnuts cool on wax paper, and after cooking the shrimp, threw the walnuts in the hot oil for about 15-20 seconds.  They came out beautiful.  I made my sauce without measuring, but tasted along the way since some complained about it being too honey flavored, or too mayo-ey.  In the end, it was so spot on perfect, with a nice golden, crispy battered shrimp, delicious sauce, and yummy walnuts! I served over homemade fried rice (I used jasmine rice).  This was super delicious...so much so that I created an account just to add a review, something I've NEVER done! Thanks for the recipe!! I would have posted a pic, but the shrimp was gone before I could!

Quick & delicious; the full sink of clean-up is well worth it. I served it on top of angel hair & asparagus, and thinned mayo sauce with regular milk because I didn't feel like opening a can of sweetened condensed for a tablespoon; worked fine. ;)

We loved this recipe!!  My daughter is a very picky eater and she raved about how much she enjoyed this recipe.  I thought it was better than a restaurant.  The only change I would make is to double the sauce amount.

The first time I substituted corn starch for the mochiko but the second time I just used regular flour and it came out way better. As good as the chinese restaurant's.

A really delicious dish! The directions were easy to follow. I used flour instead of mochiko, since I didn't have it. I wonder if there is a healthier version. It uses sugar, honey, and condensed milk... which kind of scare me thinking about the amount of sugar that adds up to.

Good recipe, but the mayo sauce was way too sweet, I had to throw away the first batch to make a second one. I used 1TB of honey and still though it was amazingly sweet. I added more mayo cause I like more of the mayo taste. And I used jumbo shrimp. Everything else was to the exact recipe. I put the sauce on the side, so people can choose the amount of sauce they wanted on their shrimps.
I kinda turn it into a Thai wrap by wrapping them in Romain lettuce, and they were delicious. The lettuce makes the meal feel less heavy and sweet.

I am normally not big on leaving reviews, but this one deserves a little extra effort to do so - I must say this recipe is perfect the way it is and the rice flour does make all the difference; only thing I think I might do different is candy the walnuts in the microwave so they are a bit more crunchy. Overall, Fantastic and super tasty!

I candied the walnuts differently- Lightly toasted them, the melted margarine and dissolved a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar. Let it cook down to thicken, hence coating the nuts then let it 'dry' on a chopping board (I chose to chop the walnuts slightly to evenly distribute). I did not find mochiko at the regular grocery stores nearby (will look for it if and when I hit the Asian markets) so I used a combination of cornstarch and flour which worked well. The coating is bland, but that is to showcase the sauce... You can easily season it to your liking but be wary of overpowering the sauce. To make the sauce I mixed 2 tablespoons each SC milk & honey and roughly 3 heaping tablespoons of mayo. I would make 1.5 times the sauce next time to coat the same amount of shrimp as it was barely enough. I thought the dish was good as-is though I would season the shrimp batter a little next time but the BF thought this was bordering too sweet... Probably because of the nuts, but he still enjoyed it. We ate it over rice with spring rolls.

I made this last night for the first time. It was pretty good, but a tad too sweet for me. I will for sure be making this again, however, I will probably use half the condensed milk next time, if at all.

This is a great recipe!  I doubled the sauce ingredients (cuz I like things saucy!) and added some sambal oelek for spice and a bit of fresh cilantro for some color and flavor contrast.  I may add a bit of salt to the batter prior to frying.  I was reminded, at times, of rice crispy cereal from the mochiko rice flour.  Still, definitely a great recipe that is easily doctored.  I also left out the candied walnuts and as not lacking for taste or texture :)

Fried up golden brown and light. A perfect batter with conrstarch. I used slightly more cornstarch because my eggs were large and that worked well. I did squeeze a dab of lemon juice in my sauce. I will do this again and again.

This was quite yummy! But I have had this dish at restaurants where the prawns were not battered or deep fried. I never deep fry anything at home so it was an 'interesting' task... and the mess I made! Having said that, the sauce was good and I will definitely make this again but just by sauteeing the prawns instead of deep frying them.

Abosolutely loved this recipe and it was very easy. My husband thought it taste the same as from the restaurant where we usually get it. Costs $18 there. Saved a little money and have a new crowd pleaser. I did not see the rice flour at the supermarket so I used cornstarch as some of the others had. I will go to the asian market to get the rice flour for the next time I prepare it. I love recipes that are inexpensive and don't take that much time. You can still be on a budget and have a great meal.

Love this recipe! I substitute the shrimp for chicken and the walnuts for pecans!  I also like to add chunked pineapple to the sauce-Delicious!  My husband and toddler agree.

This recipe is JUST AS GOOD as P.F. Changs Shrimp with Candied Walnuts (minus the melon)! I was very impressed! It's simple and inexpensive to make as well! For the price of one serving at PFCs I was able to make enough for my family of 5 with leftovers! I served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli.   I only made minor changes to the recipe. I used cornstarch instead of the rice flour and it worked great. And I used a pound and half of shrimp. I didn't have to double the batter. There was plenty. But I did double the sauce. I highly recommend this restaurant quality meal! You definitely won't be sorry you spent way less for the same meal you'd get at your favorite restaurant!

Wow!  Easy, and much like the restaurant version.  I added a little club soda to the rice flour/egg mixture which created an even lighter crispy shell.   I served the shrimp on a bed of shredded cabbage and carrots, as suggested in one of the reviews, along with Jasmine rice.

Wow.  this was DELICIOUS!  I ended up with suprise dinner guests so I added some cut up chicken tenders to the meal and they were just as tasty in the batter and sauce as the shrimp.  Everyone loved it!  We talked about adding some orange juice and zest to the sauce next time just for variety, but absolutely wonderful just as it was.  Had to search for the rice flour, but worth it.  Thanks for a definate keeper!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only substitution I made was I used rice flour (gluten-free) because I couldn't find mochiko. I also double the sauce recipe like several other reviewers suggested. I will definitely make it again. VERY GOOD! :)

Very good - I used gluten free chestnut flout and chopped walnuts and served with white rice - this was delicious.  I'll definitely make this again, hopefully with the ingredients called for in the recipe.ingredients

This was very good, way better than I expected and just as good, if not better than our local favorite restaurant. We used cornstarch instead of the mochiko. For flare, sprinkle some shredded coconut on top.

This was such a wonderful dish!!!! I was completely head over heels.  I followed everything to the T, except for the batter for the shrimp. Instead of the rice, and egg whites, I made a tempura batter which consist of 1 cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of very cold water.  I dipped the shrimp, one by one.  Wow!!!! This was better than the restaurant, and much cheaper!!!

Now I don't have to go to a restaurant to enjoy this dish. It was delicious! The first time I made it, I used glutinous rice. It turned really soggy after I added the mayonaise mixture. The second time I used panko, which held up pretty well after mixing the shrimp with the same mixture. I know I'll be making this dish many times.

this recipe disappointed me so much that i couldn't eat more than 4 bites. first off it calls for WAY too many egg whites. the mochicko batter was too pasty and the shrimp didn't stick to it at all so i had to add a little water so it would coat it. it doesn't call for enough sauce but that wouldn't have mattered because the egg flavor was so strong it was all i could taste. i LOVE honey walnut shrimp and so i am going to give this recipe another shot. but next time i am going to add water to the mochicko batter so it actually coats it. i will use two eggs whites, at the most, and i will for sure double the sauce. anyway, hope this helps someone else.  UPDATE!!! ok so i gave this recipe another shot and left out the eggs all together (only because I didn't have any, which i recommend not making this at all if you don't have at least two) and i think i know what makes it taste like eggs so much. it's the batter it calls for. it was still eggy. i will make this again because i have faith it will one day turn out amazing but i think next time i will use cornstarch.

I used chicken and shrimp.  Too much batter; could make with 3 eggs, maybe two.  Needed more sauce.  Made own condensed milk using milk, sugar and butter.  Everyone loved it.

Oh Yum, this is so good. I used reg. flour and I used the butter and brown sugar for the walnuts someone else suggested. Excellent. My family loved it and it didn't take as long to prepare as I thought. Served with Brown Rice. NOT low calorie but worth it.

FREAKIN'AWESOME!!!  Honey Walnut Shrimp has got to be one of my all-time favorite Chinese dishes.  I used to go to the Chinese joint up the street to feast on this delectable crustacean every week to satisfy my constant craving for it.  But, as time went on it just got too expensive!  It's cost about $13 for about 6 shrimp!!!  It almost brought a tear to my eye after taking my first bite when I was done preparing this recipe.  First of all, it's SO EASY!!! Second of all, it cost nothing to prepare at home. And third, it taste just as good if not better than the restaurant up the street.  The only thing I'd do different is prepare the walnuts differently by making them more candy like. Other than that...6 STARS!  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!

I thought this was excellent.  Glutenous rice flour is hard to find.  I used 1/2 soy flour and 1/2 reg flour and it was fine.  I didn't think it looked like enough of the honey sauce so I doubled it.  This was a very tasty dish.  I will definately make it again!

I'd never eaten anything like this before, but I was about to make a Million Dollar Pie (from this site) using sweetened condensed milk, and I had some shrimp in the freezer, so I decided to give this a try.  This requires a lot of different steps, so I found it a little labor-intensive.  (Especially when I had to start over again with new oil after my son thought it would be cute to dribble some water into it.) I mixed flour, cornstarch, and breadcrums for the shrimp breading, which worked well.  I served this over white rice mixed with green onions - the mix of the sweet and savory was delicious.  My four and five -year old kids liked it as well.

Great recipe.  The water sugar bath seems to make the nuts soggy.  The restaurants use the candied walnuts and are more crispy which is important to the dish.

This is a really good version. Not as good as the two resturaunts in town that serve this dish. One major difference to what I have tasted before is the sauce. I would like a creamier sauce. The resturaunt versions have a creamy white sauce. Same taste but different texture. please contact me if you have a recipe/idea for this sauce. Thanks

We really liked this and followed the recipe as stated.  There are certainly 3 things we will change next time. 1.The shrimp batter was bland and we might try to spice it up a little bit more. 2. The sauce was a little too sweet. We will modify to our taste next time. 3. We will cook the shrimp for less than the stated time.

Awesome!! This is my fav. dish at Chinese restaurants so when I saw the receipe here and the great reviews, I had to try it. I must say, I am very picky and this passed all my tests. I did everything just as instructed except for the nuts - instead of boiling them I sprinkled with sugar and a couple drops of butter then roasted them. They were pretty good but next time I will try boiling them like the recipe says but instead of letting them "dry" (??) on a cookie sheet I'll go ahead and roast them in my toaster oven to bring out the flavor. I served this dish over a bed of Jasmine Rice and some shredded lettuce under that. It looked beautiful and was delicious. You must try this. (Sidenote: I thought the mayonnaise amount was just right.) You can't go wrong with this.

This is great! I have never used Mochiko before, but it was wonderfully light and delicious. Tossing in 1/4 cup raw mayo was a little much for me....so I think I will decerase the mayo. I will follow this other recipe I found for the sauce : 2 Tbs Honey
3 Tbs Mayonnaise
1 Tbs Fresh lemon juice
1/2 - 1 Tbs Condensed milk. The candied walnuts cut down a lot of work and make it a more realistic mid week dinner at the end of my 10 hour day. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my family and they LOVED it.  Tastes better than our local Chinese restaurant.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated the first time and my husband couldn't get enough of it.  The 2nd time around, I used less mayo.

Better than what I've had at most restaurants! I shared this recipe with my mom and the whole family loved it when she cooked it too! Use the ingredients it calls for...corn starch doesn't taste as good.

Made this tonight and my wife said it was THE best she's ever had (and its one of her favorite dishes so she's picky) I did what another recommended and subbed the mochiko flour for corn starch and it worked great for the batter. I do recommend messing with the combo for the sauce, as the mayo you use may try to overpower with tangyness and mayo flavor so you may have to use more condensed milk & honey like I did. put it over rice and you have yourself a great meal! also, I cooked mine for about 6-7 minutes instead of 5 to get desired results

Absolutely delicious!! Loooooveeeed the batter - you could use it for any Asian recipe and probably even to make funnel cake. It crisped up nicely and didn't leave a mess of burnt crumbs in the frying pan as bread crumbs do. Definitely a keeper. Walnuts were a great addition. I found the honey used for the mayo mix a bit too strong tasting. Next time I will try using maple instead. I also wonder if the condensed milk was really necessary. Just a thought. Love this recipe as is and would be just as willing to play with it.

Everything was good but the sauce. it didn't taste anything like you would expect for honey walnut shrimp and tastes more like cake batter. would use a different sauce but i like this method of frying shrimp.

I've been looking for this recipe since 2001 !! I had it one time and couldn't remember the name of it or how it was made.  So thankful to come across this great recipe.  2 thumbs up from even the pickiest eaters at the table.  I only made a few changes. I candied the walnuts on the stove with a little butter, sugar, water and vanilla.  I didn't have rice flour so I used a AP flour/cornstarch combo and it came out thin and crispy.  I did add vanilla extract and sambal to the sauce because we like heat with our sweet.  Glad I doubled the sauce or it may not have been enough.  Amazing and can't wait to make it again.

This was super yummy! Made half of my batch as directed (except that I cheated and bought my candied walnuts) and added chipotle to the other half...deelish! I also fried my candied walnuts and it was perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delish and pretty easy to make. I couldn't find the rice flour so I used corn starch like the reviews recommended and it was perfect, I suspect that the restaurant where I used to order this probably used corn starch too since it rated identical! Will definitely make again, I may even try it with chicken since my husband hates shrimp.

I, too, used cornstarch, since I couldn't find mochiko at my local stores. WOW! This was amazing! What was changed was what was suggested in the comments. Sauteed the walnuts with 2 tbs of butter and 3 tbs of brown sugar, although next time I'm only going to do 1 tbs of brown sugar. It over powered the walnuts to much. I also whipped the egg whites and then folded in the corn starch, doubled the sauce and then added chives! This was awesome!

this was too sweet for my taste, i was not a fan of the walnuts and though the shrimp tasted well at first, after a few bites it was just nauseating.

I didn't really care for the shrimp batter or the nuts. But the sauce was a keeper. The batter had no flavor and had an odd styrofoam texture. I did ues the corn starch that others suggusted. Next time I will use the sauce but maybe make a tempura batter. The nuts never "dried" I would try another candied nut recipe also.

Made this as a test for a potluck party.  The guest of honor requested honey walnut shrimp from our favorite Chinese restaurant.  So many people are showing up, I needed a money saving alternative.  This is perfect!  Came out great, and will save me a bunch of money!  Thank you for sharing!

I just love honey walnut shrimp so when I saw this recipe,I just had to try it out.I like how the condensed milk gave it a really good sweet flavor.I use a little more condensed milk than called for,maybe about 4 tablespoons.

I used corn starch instead of the rice flour as some suggested since I couldn't find it, I also dipped the shrimp in the egg whites first then covered with the corn starch and it worked perfectly, the shrimp came out with a nice crunchy coating.  However, the sauce is deathly sweet and then to add the sugar coated walnuts on top was just too much for me, I cut the sweetness with some soy sauce but something was still off my husband said it reminded him of candy corn with shrimp needless to say I won't be making this again, and now what to do with a can of sweetend condensend milk with a tablespoon missing???

I have eaten this two nights in a row. My husband was out of town, so tonight he had it. As my sister said, "to, die for" The only change was I made it for two, and used cornstarch instead of the rice flour, I am on a gluten free diet, and burnt out on rice flour. YUM.

Very delicious! Easy to make. I made a mistake of adding all the mochiko to the egg whites so it was a like a big ball of glue rather than a batter, a little water helped with that. Tastes just like the restaurant. Happy cooking!

This was an absolute hit at my sisters baby shower! I emailed this recipe to a few people because they were surprised how easy it was.  The only thing im trying to figure out is how to keep it crisp and not soggy.

Wow!!!! I just finished eating this with home-made chicken fried rice. Soooo good. My husband is extremely picky about the foods he eats. I've tried so many recipes and he will always suggest a change to make it better. However, this recipe is a smash hit. My family absolutely loved it. And yes, we will definately be making this soon in the future

These were pretty good but not at all like what I usually get from take out.  I was out of Mochiko so I used corn starch which is why I gave this 4 because that may have altered my results.  I think my prawns may have been too big as they were barely covered in battered after dipping many times.  I even had to cut them in half. They were tiger prawns, next time I'll try smaller. they sauce was really good but a bit different from what I'm used too texture wise. I think I'll stick to the restuarants

I CAN'T BELIEVE I MADE THIS FROM SCRATCH! It was very easy (well, except for the deep frying part...it was easy but kind of took a while).  SUGGESTION: Double the sauce and it will be the perfect amount!

I omitted the walnut stage(hubby doesn't like walnuts)  I used corn staech, as another reviewer sugusted.  I made batter with 6 eggs and only had a little left from my lb of shrimp....minus the tails.  I made double the sauce.  This was sooo messy and time consuming.  I will not make this again for this reason, if it wasn't for  that I'd make it again, it had great flavor.  Next time I'll cheat and buy pre-battered shrimp and use this sauce recipe:)

This is a fabulous recipe.  I followed it exactly as written except that I used far less oil for frying.  My husband and son both agreed that it tasted just like the Honey Walnut Shrimp that we get from our favorite restaurant.  Serving suggestion = add a small handful of thawed peas in for added flavor and color. - Thanks Celia for a great recipe!

I followed this exactly and really didn't like it at all. The sauce was ok but that was the only positive part.  I did serve it alone. Maybe some rice would have helped. I will not be repeating this recipe.

I liked the coating very much, nice and crispy. Used cornstarch instead of mochiko. I think this would be good as a coating on homemade fries!

I tried making this at home.  It came out good, but reeeally sweet - almost too sweet (if there is such a thing) =) .  Instead of shrimp - I used chicken breast.  Is there anything I can use as a substitute to lessen the sugary tast?

This is a great recipe! I would definitely add a little less mayonnaise next time but it really wasn't a big deal, I'm just not a big mayo fan. If you have any Kewpie (Japanese mayo) on hand I would recommend using half normal mayo and half kewpie for I little twist. Thanks for such a great recipe! :)

My husband and I made this for a multi-birthday celebration for the family.  There are a few changes that we made.  First, the batter seemed to be very thick, so when we fried it, it turned out very puffy.  We thinned the batter quite a bit, to the point that we could see the shrimp through it.  It turned out crispy with a very thin bread coat...perfect.  Additionally, I found that the honey flavor was very strong, and I prefer this dish to be more on the "tangy" side as it is in restaurants.  I therefore used more mayonnaise and a little more condensed milk, and some fresh lemon juice as I had seen in some other recipes online, again....perfect!  Because we were feeding around 20 or more adults and children, we opted to buy candied walnuts.  We made 4 pounds worth of shrimp, and it was devoured in about 5 minutes!!  I had no idea that this recipe was so easy.  As for Mochiko, you can usually find this in the asian section of most supermarkets.  Being half Filipino I have baked with this on numerous occasions and have never had a problem finding it.  Enjoy...great recipe and very forgiving as far as adjustments go.

This was pretty darn exceptional! I have a restaurant near me that sells this as an entree and I absolutely LOVE it! This is a GREAT recreation of it! The only suggestion that I would make would be to use less honey. With less honey this would be exactly like Hunan's!

Just like at PF Changs!!!!  Try adding honeydew.  You can scoop them with a melon baller and it adds a refreshing natural sweetness to the dish.  My boyfriend thought I bought it at pf changs and tried to pass it off as my own!! THAT gooooood!!!

Excellent recipe for a special occasion.  The shrimp I used were very large (7ct/lb) so I suppose the size of the shrimp would determine how much batter was needed, but I had batter left over even using 2 pounds of shrimp. For the batter, I used an electric mixer to get the egg whites foamy, substituted cornstarch for the mochiko, and added salt & pepper.  I also doubled the walnuts in a single amount of the sugar water; afterwards I put the walnuts on a small cookie sheet in a toaster oven for 10 min on 200 degrees so they wouldn't be soggy. A doubled amount of the honey sauce was just right.  I served the crispy shrimp and walnuts over some stir fried onion, celery, broccoli, and bamboo shoots which I layered over Jasmine rice.  Next time I would add more salt and pepper.  A very impressive dish.

Very good.  The batter ended up being a tad more firm or thick? (once fried) than I prefer.  I dont know if this is because I used regular rice flour and not mochiko??  (I don't even know if there is a difference because I am not familiar with the latter.)  Or because maybe over-fried?  Anyway, it was still very good and I would make it again (and I used reduced-fat mayo.)

These were awesome! Will definitely make again. I followed the recipe exactly as is. The only drawback was we waited about 15 minutes until our rice was done to have dinner and they became a little soggy, but still delicious.

Excellent recipe, simple and straight forward, the rice flour is essential.

Another way of making glazed walnuts is pan cooking the walnuts on medium heat with sugar until the sugar melts and fully coats the nuts. I used a quarter cup of sugar per cup of nuts ratio, add more or less depending on how much sweetness you want.  For another twist, adding a dash of cinnamon or toasted sesame seeds is also effective.    

I also found that adding a tsp of lemon juice to the mayonnaise and condensed milk mixture brings out the sweet and tangy taste of the sauce.

Great flavor!  Had a little trouble with the rice flour.  Didn't coat the shrimp well.  It must have been the brand I bought.  Overall this was a great recipe.  Will make again.

The recipe for the shrimp is good but time consuming to fry up if you don't have a deep fryer. We use the sauce on braised jumbo scallops and it was just like a asian seafood place we love!

This was part of an early Chinese New Year get-together.  Scoured other on-line recipes and consulted with friends and family (Chinese).  Way too sweet as written.  Purchased Japanese mayonnaise (brand name 'Kewpie' on west coast) which is sweeter and creamier than western mayo.  Squeeze of lemon and a little more than 1/4 c. of sweetened condensed milk.  No honey.  Used already made walnuts (Trader Joes).  2 lbs. large shrimp also from Trader Joes.  Mounded atop lots of crunchy cabbage.  Guests raved. Thanks for the inspiration!  ps - my Chinese friend said most restaurants use Miracle Whip as base for this dish (and not mayo)!

The batter was a little chewy, but these were great! I might try to adjust the batter next time so it's a little lighter.

This really is a good if not better than restaurant dishes. After reading many reviews and following the recipe, it is better to toss the walnuts in a pan with a bit of butter and brown sugar as oppose to actually boiling it in water. This makes the walnut crunchy and more appealing.

Sorry, but I didn`t like this recipe at all. It was a waste of large shrimp for me. Egg whites and rice flour don`t make a good batter. The sauce was way too sweet.

i couldn't find mochiko so used tempura breading. The recipe was good, but not quite like the walnut shrimp I have had at restaurants, and the time and effort wasn't quite worth it.

hands down the best meal i have ever made with shrimp! it was soooo amazing and a lot easier to make than i thought it would be. my boyfriend and i ate ALL of it in one sitting. i made extra sauce too nd served it with steamed broccoli and jasmine rice. SO GOOD...i did add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract to the walnuts while i boiled them, then reserved some of the liquid to add to the sauce. wheni made the sauce i used an extra T of honey and condensed milk and also added 1/4c of fat free milk too. i didn't want the sauce to be so thick the way it was before i added the milk and reserved liquid from the walnuts. i also used flour for the breading because thats what i had...anyway, it is definetly something i will be making again!

This is wonderful just as is, although I agree it's probably best to toast the walnuts in sugar rather than boil them.  Anyway, this was my first foray into Americanized Chinese food and I was shocked by how easy and fun it was.  This only took an hour start to finish, and I was going really slowly and peeled and cleaned my own shrimp.  I've always wondered how to make the thick batter you see in the restaurants, and this is it!  It's worth it to try to find the mochiko (we're lucky to have a Super 88 nearby) to get the right consistency, I think.  The sauce is very sweet, but that's the point, and I did think it was overwhelming at all.  I served it over white rice and will certainly make it again.

I made two types of sauces, the first one was as directed on the recipe. It came out too sweet for my taste.

So I made a second one, except this time, I customized it.

I reduced the condensed milk to 1 TBS and I took out the honey, and replaced it with  1 1/2 tsp of coconut extract.

the second sauce turned out wonderful! Absolutely delicious!

This might be the best thing I've ever cooked!! I would give it more stars if that was possible. I did not change a thing from the original recipe. I did have a hard time finding rice flour in my grocery store but finally found it in the organic food section. The sauce is so good! I served it with steamed jasmine rice and steamed snap peas. I will definitely make this again.

I just made this tonight! My husband and I both LOVED it! I will definately make it again and again. I did substitute corn starch also. Worked great. I think I might even try cutting up chicken breast nuggets and doing them the same way. I could eat the sauce on anything! Thanks ALOT!!!!!!! :)

Had this dish in PA at least 8 years ago and wasn't able to find it in the Midwest.  Found and tried this recipe two days ago and it was awesome!  My husband who doesn't like anything sweet (outside dessert) absolutely loved it.  The honey & mayo sauce was incredible as well...Thanks!!!

This turned out really well.  I couldn't find the flour it was calling for so I made a substitution.  Some here recommended regular flour and some corn starch.  I used half of each (and a tablespoon of lemon juice).  It turned out great this way.  I didn't have any problems with the batter staying on the shrimp and it still turned out light and fluffy. I also put the sauce, shrimp and walnuts in a pan to warm it before serving.  Husband said it was better than what we get at a restaurant!

The best shrimp I've ever had (husband too).......I can not say enough about this recipe. A million stars!!! 
I was concerned because when I went to batter the shrimp it was very thick and didn't stick very well. After I got the hang of it however, it was fine. I'm sure this needs to be made with mochiko, not regular flour.
I had this dish several years ago at Hampton Beach in NH and have been trying to find it ever since. This blows that away.
THANKS FOR SHARING!!!!!

I've been dying to try this recipe out!  It came out real good, better than the ones I order from Chinatown restaurants.  I had used potato starch instead.  I had broccoli and mash potatos on the side.  Since there was time contraint I couldn't really candy the walnuts but the recipe is still fantastic!!

Excellent shrimp, the flavor was just what my husband was looking for!  Only thing I hated was only 1 tbls of sweetened condendensed milk and what are you supposed to do with the rest of the whole can??  I doubled the walnuts but that was really too much.  Next time I'm going to chop the walnuts in somewhat small peices before boiling them because they will so much better spreading over the shrimp with sauce.  I also added about another tbls of mayo with the sauce and it was PERFECT! Thanks for the recipe!!

Wow, this recipe came out just like the restaurant version! My boyfriend and I both loved it. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but decreased the amount of mayo and increased the amount of condensed milk, and increased the amount of sauce overall, as other reviewers had suggested. I also served the shrimp on a bed of thinly sliced cabbage. Yum!

A very good, easy recipe. I'm not a great cook by any means, but I managed to pull it together and thought the results were excellent.  Only problem I ran into was with making the batter.  Using 4 egg whites with the mochiko flour yielded a dough-like consistency, so I added 1 more egg white. The other reviewers didn't seem impressed by the candied walnuts, so I skipped that all together and just made the honey shrimp.

Maybe I expected too much from this recipe.... I got so excited when I came upon this one because I had been looking for such a recipe for the longest time, and was never able to find one, but although taste was good, it was not quite the same as the ones we had before. Thank you though for posting.

My grandparent are crazy about this recipe.  I did not batter the shrimp and I candied the walnuts with butter and brown sugar.  I personally don't care for this recipe because the mixture of sweet and shrimp are not my thing but my grandparent request it again and again.

This dish wasn't as crispy as I had hoped, and the honey sauce also didn't have same restaurant flavor that I'd hoped for.  It might cook up better for people who are experienced in making this dish, but it definately didn't come out as well as I had anticipated.

The fried shrimp was good, but the sauce had a bit more honey than I am used to for this dish.  Next time, I will reduce the honey.  Other than that, it was pretty good.

This was different but really great!   I didn't have rice flour but one reviewer mentioned switching it with cornstarch and it seemed to work just fine!   I will def make this again.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe 100%. Make sure you use fresh walnuts. I used what I had in the pantry and they may have been a little stale. Would definitely serve this meal with guests. Very tasty!

This is a recipe that my husband, Sister, Friends and I get every time we go to a certain mandarin restaurant.  Well, this is the exact recipe!  It is so delicious.  I did buy the rice flour, and itâ€™s not cheap, so one reviewer said they used cornstarch instead.  I wish I would have read that and it would have saved me some $.  Thank you for this great recipe.  Try it, you wonâ€™t even be disappointed.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I had my doubts about the batter because it coated the shrimp very thickly, but once it fried in oil, it was actually perfect!  My family really enjoyed it.  Next time I will try it with actual walnut halves to make it look pretty.

2 stars for the recipe overall, the sauce kind of was a transition from honey sweetness to extreme mayo. So I made several alterations to the sauce and it ended up being a meal everyone enjoyed! We would definitely make this again but change up the sauce (I added sugar, soy sauce, and orange sauce)

Made this recipe a while back for Thanksgiving and it was a hit with the family! Tastes as authentic as whatâ€™s served at the Chinese restaurants! My only gripe would be that it took me an hour and a half, but it was my first time

Very easy recipe. Followed instructions provided except I substituted chicken for the shrimp. Love the lightness of this batter, Iâ€™ll be incorporating it into other dishes as well!

Very good recipe. Did not have rice flour so I put enough panko in my mini food processor to come up with allocated amount needed and it came out great. Will make again.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  Had to add another egg white in order to be able to apply batter to the shrimp.  Not nearly enough sauce.

This recipe is FANTASTIC exactly how it is. You can use regular ground rice flour, available at most grocery stores in the department where the "Bob's Red Mill" flours and grits are. We always make this with steamed broccoli. Family and friends line up for this one.

I must say that I was thrilled with the results of this recipe. I have had this dish in a little restaurant  near home and it has been one of my favorites for a long time. I can not have gluten and it is gluten free.  My other half was thrilled also, he keeps reminding me to make it again...you can bet I will.

I used black tiger shrimp for this recipe. It was delicious on it's own - dipped in the mochiko batter. It was a hit with the kiddos. I'm glad I stumbled upon this recipe. I no longer have to buy the high priced honey walnut shrimp at Chinese restaurants.

I love the blend of flavors. I made substitutions but will make it again with the called for ingredients. One problem I encountered was I blanched and shocked the shrimp and did not take that out of cooking time so my shrimp was a bit tough.

I couldn't find the flour specified so I subbed corn starch.  I also doubled the sauce.  Excellent taste.   The candied walnuts were easy to make.  Definitely saved this recipe for future meals.

Made this with lobster instead of shrimp. Simply cut up some lobster tails into bite size pieces. Also I added about a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar to the sauce. This cuts a little of the fatty texture from the mayo and addd a bit of a zip to it. All in all great recipe.

Delicious, just like the restaurant only better! I had to add 2 extra egg whites to get the right consistency to the batter, and it was a bit messy, but MAN!!! Yum! The walnut candying seems to be unnecessary, next time I'll try it without that step.

Recipe was easy...I did use the glutinous rice flour which made for a nice texture. If your store doesnâ€™t offer many varieties of flour I suggest cornstarch. I bought candied pecans instead and just toasted them in oil with shallots. I also added more mayonnaise and honey...the sweet condensed milk is really the key for this recipe. Donâ€™t skimp on a cheap can. All in all an excellent version of this recipe.

Couldn't find mochiko locally and I live 90 miles away from stores that carry it. So I substituted Krusteaz Gluten Free flour in the batter. It worked well maybe not quite as sweet as the mochiko would have been. But the family loved it. So quick and easy. I will definitely be making this again.

Followed the recipe and Loved the results. The only change I made was that I candied the walnuts with maple syrup instead of white sugar. Better for you and better taste.

I too, only registered to rate this recipe.  5 stars aren't enough - this is by far the best shrimp feast ever!  Family and friends suddenly appear from nowhere when I make this.  Use the mochiko flour and double the sauce.  Winner, winner, shrimp for dinner!

Recipe was great. Made with my wife and had a guest over.

Used pecans instead of walnut, toasted them in the oven once they were dried after the candying. 

With the pot we were using (just a stainless steel saucepan), 1 cup of oil wasn't quite deep enough. We basically just used enough to makes sure we could submerge the shrimp in the oil. Stirring slowly while putting it in so that the batter doesn't get stuck on bottom or side of the pan. 

When the batter was too thick, I added a spoon of water to thin it out to get a more even coating.

In the sauce, we added another tablespoon of condensed milk since initially the sauce still tasted too strongly of mayonnaise.

Served with steamed broccoli and fried rice.

I have not tried this yet (it looks delicious) but I was wondering if this is a copy of the PF Changs similar dish that also has honeydew melon? Anyone know?

Saw this recipe and even though I'm not a shrimp fan, this is the one shrimp dish I like.  Made it and I loved it and so did my hubby..knocked out in a food coma after eating.. I only substituted cornstarch for the other flour (as others suggested) but kept the recipe in tact.  Thanks for a lovely recipe.

I used corn starch as some reviewers stated.  I don't know if that made the difference or not, but shrimp didn't come out too crispy.  I used the 1 tbs of condensed milk, but now what do I do with the rest of the can?  seems almost wasteful unless I want to make a dessert or something.  Not sure if I will try this again or not.

I loved this recipe. I cooked it for my parents and they loved it. I might use a little less mayo next time though because it was just a little bit too much for my personal preference.

Easy and delicious..if you make this for company....you will be giving the recipe out left and right. I took the easy route...and purchased the glazed walnuts instead of making them. Serve this with a fantastic fried rice and homemade egg foo young and you've got a yummy dinner all will rave about

You need to candy the sugar by boiling it until it starts turning brown, then put the walnuts in before it gets thick.   Otherwise the shrimp part is good.

I would definitely make it again. I cooked my shrimp a little more than some might prefer, but I like the crispness of it. The Mochiko took some finding, because I didn't want to just use white rice flour. I live in the inland empire in California, and there ain't a whole lot of asian cuisine ingredients at the local grocery stores. Luckily, we have a 99 Ranch Market (AWESOME place if you ever want to find authentic asian foods or hard to find fish and meat selections like Rabbit or different kinds of poultry). I think next time I'll up the portions given for the sauce, because the portions called for didn't yield enough sauce to cover a pound of shrimp to my liking (not too dry, but not dripping, either). I think I'll also add some green onion or pepper next time. Overall, though. It was delicious, and fun to cook, too (although beware of the oil bombs! ;)

Thanks Celia!

I made this exactly as written. The mochiko was available in my regular grocery store. I used top quality shrimp so this was BETTER than restaurant quality. Will make a key lime pie today with the leftover sweetened condensed milk and egg yokes. Thanks for a super recipe that I'll make often.

My husband loved it! I followed the recipe as is and it came out as expected. This would be an occasional dish to make since frying the shrimp in the egg white-glutinous rice flour mix seemed like a lot of extra work on top of deveining and peeling the shrimp. To balance it, I served it on top of a bed of blanched broccoli and some rice.

This was such a great recipe! I followed everything but the walnuts part. I took another cook's advice and toasted them in 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp brown sugar. I burned the walnuts a bit, not knowing how long to toast them for, so I'd say only a few minutes. Aside from that, everything else was delicious and tasted just as good as restaurant honey walnut shrimp, if not better. Will definitely be making this again!

My kids love Panda Express's Honey Walnut Shrimp, so I knew I had to try this recipe to see if I could make it even better at home. I think this was BETTER! I didn't have any of the mochiko, so I used corn starch, as recommended by other reviewers. It worked well, I think I just need to get the consistency right, as it was a bit too "batter-y". I will try this with the mochiko next time. Overall, this is one that I will definitely make again.

PF Chang's has nothing on me anymore lol! Easy to make and so delicious! Used Trader Joe's candied walnuts. Served the shrimp over cabbage with rice on the side. Not healthy with the frying and sugar but what a treat! Thanks!

Very good, but the sauce was too sweet for hubby and I.  I added another 3 tablespoons of mayo to make it less sweet which made it perfect.

This was my first time making this recipe and it was DELISH!!!!!! I followed the recipe exactly as it calls for and it was a great hit at home. I was worried when the batter became very "Elmer's glue" as another cook mentioned but  get discouraged (it's sticky just work with it). Make sure you have more than enough oil to properly fry the batter through to make your shrimp crisp. The sauce was great if you know you like extra sauce make sure to double the sauce recipe to your liking. I cheated and bought pre packaged candied walnuts and they worked just fine and saved me the time. I will be making this again for sure.

it was more like tempura. I know I did something wrong because I always read the reviews before I try a new recipe, and all the reviews were positive. My mouth was watering after reading the recipe. This took almost more than an hour to make. and the mess with the oil, then by the time I was done making everything, its all cold and has to be reheated....

OMG!!! The best recipe ever.. Highly recommend this recipe.. Now I dont need to go to the chinese restaurant. Followed all the steps and ingredients it was the BOMB! The only thing was a bit hard was getting the shrimp stick on the batter but the easiest way to do that is mix the shrimp to the batter evenly and turned out awesome. oh yeah I forgot I used cashew nuts instead. It was GREAAAAAAAAAAT! Hubby loves it!!!!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  CNot only was the sauce too sweet, but it was flavourless.  The batter was not appetizing, it came out soft.

I wasn't a big fan of this dish. Part of it is my fault, I didn't read it thoroughly and didn't realized it was a fried dish at the outset - I'm not a bit fan of frying. Even so, I wasn't very impressed with the flavor of the dish either. I made it exactly as listed. I found it to be too sweet.

This recipe was spot on. If you crave Panda Express honey walnut shrimp, this is the recipe! I used Goya rice flour and it cooked perfectly. Will be making this again!

This was an excellent dish. My husband and I had it tonight and we really enjoyed it. We cut the sugar in half that we simmered the walnuts in to 1/3 a cup, and we also added a bit more of the honey to the sauce mixture. All in all perfect. We also took other reviewers advice and used cornstarch instead of the rice flour because it is what we had on hand. Next time however, we want to try using Panko flakes for a bit more crisp, cause we like our shrimp very crispy. We served it with steamed rice and that was it. We won't be eating Panda Expresses again, thanks!

this was awesome!  i had about a pound and a half of shrimp.. so i just ended up doubling the sauce.. i tried to fry the walnuts as others said.. unfortunately i fried them first and had to change out the oil bc of the dirty bits.. not making that mistake again.. used regular flour and seasoned it with season salt and cayenne.. was running out of mayo so i had to use about a tablespoon or so of yogurt to finish it off.. used coffee creamer instead of condensed milk.. funny i know.. but it worked.. new dirty trick i suppose.. super tasty.. ty so much for the recipe

This was incredible. I used a rice flour. Was light and crisped nicely.  The flavor was delish. My family loved it and has asked for it again. I liked it better than my favorite Chinese food restaurant. Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Easy to follow (easier if you have a deep fryer like I do).  Tasted just like the Honey Walnut you can have at P.F. Changs!

This one was AmAzInG!! Definatly fills the craving when you can't get to restraunt style shrimp. Yum just be sure to only put sauce on the shrimp you will eat at the time. Storing in the sauce makes them really soggy.

I used tofu instead of shrimp and added some fresh coconut and cilantro in my batter. Also I shallow fried instead of deep, and this was a hit at home inspite of the changes.

Very crispy and tasty. Came out really well. I roasted the walnuts in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes instead. then used half the water and half the sugar. That's all you need to candy the walnuts.

Absolutely delicious! The only thing I will change next time is to heat the walnuts and sugar LAST. By the time the food was done the walnuts were cold and a bit soggy.

Great batter and sauce loved this recipe and very easy i would toast my walnuts next time before putting them in the sweet mixture i think i bought raw walnuts buts still taste great they got kindof cooked when i boiled the mixture for 10 mins don't repeat how long i boiled it for unless you are going to sit there and pay attention to it. I would like to add some coconut to this batter next time and maybe some in the sauce for a great coconut chicken

This is a new favorite recipe. Everything about it is so good! Even a novice cook can pull it off. I had no rice flour, so I used 1/3 c all purpose flour and 1/3 c prepared pancake mix.

This is an excellent recipe!!! I decided to look for this recipe because in my area, the restaurant charge $13.95 for this dish, and you only get a very small portion. This recipe tastes better than the restaurant!! I will continue to make this recipe often!!

Its more like 3.75 for me. I'm just not a sweet tooth kinda person. It was great after the first bite but then it just became too sweet to keep going. If you try the shrimp by themselves then you need to add a little salt and pepper so that its not so bland. I'll probably do the shrimp again for sure.

Very good!! Loved the way the shrimp came out when fried-light and crispy. Such an easy dish to make, very tasty too. Much better tastier the ones at the restaurants. I don't care too much for the walnuts, they didn't came out as crunchy as I expected but the dish is great without them. I'm so glad I found this recipe!! :)

Love Love Love this!! I made this dish using the cornstarch/egg whites mix that I have read in other posts.  I was very surprised at the light and crispy result by using just those two ingredients!  I also used the "Dawns candied walnuts" recipe for the walnuts.  My hubby also said this was a keeper and better than the restaurants.

This was very good, for a healthier option I stir fried the shrimp by covering it in sherry and corn starch.  It turned out really well

Just like at the restaurant. I substituted using tempura batter for the shrimp. Make sure you have a good ratio of shrimp to sauce otherwise it get's waay too sweet.

Great alternative to a restaurant!  Cut the recipe in half or even a quarter for four servings and fry the shrimp/prawns in small batches to avoid clumping.  Yum!

Absolutely wonderful.  As other's said I fired the walnuts and it needs double the sauce.  This is now on the family menu!

I loved the recipe.  I moved and haven't been able to enjoy honey walnut shrimp for a long time!  It came out perfect.  The only thing I will change is that next time I will try candying the walnuts as suggested by others.  Otherwise I will be making this over and over again!

This was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!! I candied the walnuts in 1/4 c of sugar. Put walnuts and sugar in a pan on the stove till sugar melts and turn out onto foil. I also added some garlic salt to the flour and a 1/4 tsp of cayenne to the sauce (we like things spicy). I doubled the sauce but next time will quadruple. Served the chicken over shredded cabbage with a side of stir fry veggies enhanced with soy and garlic chili sauce. This one is a total keeper!! We loved it =)

i did this recipe twice. i followed the first one exactly to this one. it was great. but after 10 mins of frying the shirmp, it got soggy. so i was looking into a different ways of doing it. i manage to get my mother in law's help. i used tempura batter with some salt in it. but very little. it came out better. so for 30 tiger shirmps butterfly at their backs. i put about 1/4 cup of tempure mix with 1/4 cup of water & 2 pinches of salt. mix them together & fried them. try it!

This recipe was different...I don't really know how I feel about it. I made it basically as stated except to batter the shrimp I found a recipe on this site to make a tempura batter. Overall, the flavor was pretty good and the texture was nice and crispy. The nuts are my favorite part. My boyfriend, who doesn't like shrimp unless it's breaded and fried even liked it some. I think I would have liked it more if I didn't know what ingredients were in the dressing. The mayonnaise plus condensed milk kinda freaks me out. I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

WOW! This is a stellar recipe and made me and my cooking talent look awesome in front of our dinner guests.  The meal was just as good as PF Changs!  It did make quite a mess on my stove top, due to the oil splattering and popping everywhere when the shrimp was frying but other than that it was a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!!  (By the way, I tripled the sauce recipe and am glad I did.  We had 6 people eat off of this meal and maybe had a 1/2 cup sauce left over.)

Of course not something that we can eat every week (although that'd be nice), but a nice treat every once in a while. There's never any leftovers.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. It was so yummy and much cheaper to make at home than buy at the restraunt. Even my kids loved it and they won't eat shrimp normally.

WOW!!! Scrumptious! This will be a new favorite in our home. I've never made anything like this, but it was really easy and quick.  I did use cornstarch instead of the mochiko as others had suggested and mixed it to the consistency of school glue.  You really have to try this!

I was looking for something like PF Chang's dreamy dish, but this wasn't even close. I don't think P F Chang batters and fries their shrimp, to start with, and the sauce is very light. The melon balls add a nice sweetness and the walnuts crunchiness. My family said this was good, and they would like to make it again, but it fell far short of PF Chang's recipe, in my book.

I hate hate hate to do this because I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time; It didn't work out for me. I guess I need to adjust my batter--The egg was too eggy for me and maybe I'll try Mochiko this time because I didn't have any and I just used corn starch. The sauce wasn't as good as I hoped as well. Sorry to be a ball buster, but I probably won't be doing this one again. And I LOVE Honey Walnut Shrimp =/

Great recipe! I had honey walnut shrimp at an oriental buffet a long time ago and loved it since, it was the sole reason of my repeat visits there. Now I can make it on my own.
I'm not a fan of walnuts in my food so I skipped them. I also made this recipe with cornstarch and it still turned out increddibly well!

This was pretty good. I love the recipe from the resturants and I didn't think this tasted as good but, it was still enjoyable. I actully did this with chicken because that is what I had on hand and I really like that. I also toasted the walnuts on the stove with butter and brown sugar. I will probably make this again but not regularly.

We loved this recipe, it is a keeper.  I varied only a bit - I added half the honey as the sauce was bit too sweet.  But I added about two cups of Honeydew melon balls (these were cold and added when with the walnuts/sauce at the end).  Ahhhh....  wonderful served with Jasmine Rice!!!

WOW this was so easy and SO GOOD!!! The batter looked a little odd, but I found the chicken easier to coat if it was dry. I wish I made more, and next time will double the batch of chicken. There should be more than enough sauce.

Dish was really really good. Although because I used regular flour, the coating didnt come out as good as it probably should have. I was really unsure about the mayo, but with the sweet milk it came out yummy. Not exactly what you find in the Chinese Res. but darn close. I paired it up with Fried Rice II and added a bag of frozen veggies. Will make again.

I couldn't find mochiko at my local grocery store, but I did find and use a gluten-free rice flour. B/c of its very fine consistency, I was able to get light and fluffy fried shrimp, just like they make in really good Chinese restaurants. The sauce was amazing. My husband LOVES this dish. Add a side of Jasmine rice, and you have a complete meal.

Soooooooo good! I've had this dish at just about every Chinese restaurant I've ever been to, and this recipe is keeps up with the best of them! Better than some, even! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! It does take more than 30 minutes to make (or I'm just slow), but it's well worth it.

This recipe was great!  I just added some broccoli and green beans to the recipe and it made it absolutely delicious (not that it wasn't already).
