This is the best horseradish I have ever had!! My sinuses were the clearest they have ever been. My nose ran, my eyes cried but my palate was quite happy. Thanks Chef John, finally a horseradish recipe I will forever use.

This is very similar to my Dad's recipe he made to go with the kielbasa on Easter. Ventilation is key, as a child checking out what was in the big bowl on the counter I inhaled and completely lost my breath. Learned that lesson very quickly.

I had my first horseradish harvest and used this recipe to prepare it. It was so easy! I was able to get it to the perfect consistency. I also liked that there wasn't a ton of vinegar in it--that let the flavor and hotness of the horseradish come through.

LOL... I seriously made this outside on my porch, just in case, and Iâ€™m glad I did. 

Sooo hot. Sooo easy. Tastes delicious to me, though the test will be tonight at a Christmas Party. I will update with comments from the peanut gallery when I have a chance.

Super easy way to use my homegrown horseradish.  Put some of this in the freezer as it was a large amount.  Tasted great, very strong! Might cut it with a little mayo if we need to, but we like it hot so I think it will be great.  Worked easier in my small food processor to chop the pieces pretty small to start with.

This was awesome! Made some extra and gave it to my neighbor, who immediately asked me for the recipe.

Finally! Real prepared horseradish that has the kick and heat I desire. I didn't have a whole pound of horse radish but was able to scale it down to what I had no problem. Make sure you are working in a ventilated area, or the tears will be flowing for sure! This will certainly clear out your sinuses! I had .25 prod and it made a little less than a cup.
