Perfect coleslaw for those who like a creamy sweet version - like me!

I used apple cider vinegar instead of white, nearly 4T of mayonaisse, and didn't use the pineapple juice (not something I generally have on hand). To the folks who found that their coleslaw was sitting in a watery, soupy mess after a while, here's the way to stop that from happening:

After you've shredded the cabbage, toss it with 1t salt in a colander. Let sit over a bowl or in the sink for an hour or so. 4C of cabbage will have sweated about 1/2C of liquid by that point! Rinse the cabbage, drain, and dry with paper towels. Proceed with recipe and get thick creamy slaw!

Delicious.  I made some changes: double (at least) the dressing.  Do NOT use low-fat mayonnaise (I should've known that) and mix mayo with brown sugar before adding liquids for creamier results (otherwise gets curdled appearance, even when using a whisk).  I added pineapple tidbits.  I left skins on apples (used 2) and chopped in shape similar to pineapple tidbits.  I garnished with apples slices and pineapple tidbits on top so everyone would know the unusual ingredients were in there.  Next time I might add FRESH parsley.  Very yummy.  Dressing was very light, nice alternative to the heavy mayo or the vinegar dressings.

Very tasty, but for children, I would decrease the black pepper to 1/2 tsp. Also added another 1T. mayo and dressing is great.

What a clever take on coleslaw! The honey, apple and pineapple give it wonderful flavor, much lighter than traditional coleslaw. I had a fresh pineapple on hand, so I added about 1/2 cup of that, finely diced. I subbed cider vinegar for the white, but I'm sure it would be equally good either way. To make it a main dish salad, I chopped up a grilled chicken breast and added it in. A very delicious way to eat my fruits and vegetables, thank you!

My family and I absolutely loved this sweet coleslaw! I didn't use pineapple juice, so it was likely not as sweet as it could be, but I didn't miss it. Instead, I added 2 teaspoons of finely shredded coconut right on top of the chopped apples (highly experimental) and the juice from half a lemon, and I was sooooo happy I did! The coconut flavor is light but noticeable and soooooo good with the apple flavor! I also mixed the wet ingredients together first like others suggested. Mine was not soupy at all because I used pre-shredded cabbage (cole slaw mix) from Sam's. I'm pleased with how light the dressing is because it doesn't make me feel guilty for eating it!

We loved the flavor of this "sauce" for the coleslaw.  We didn't want an overwhelming mayo flavor and this was perfect though I made some changes in the ingredients due to the items I had on hand.  Unfortunately I didn't have pineapple juice or an apple but the juice would have been an excellent tropical addition.  I added 2 green onions, utilizing all the green parts and the white part of one. I added 2 stalks of celery, finely sliced.  I also had garlic rice vinegar so I substituted that as well.  I added Mrs. Dash and salt in the seasonings. It was a great side dish to accompany our hamburgers.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great tasting coleslaw.  Nice and light, with a touch of sweetness.  Pineapple juice adds good flavor.  Definitely great in sandwiches!  Thank you.

not fantastic, but not terrible either.  I added an extra mayonnaise, as the requested amount didn't come close to coating all the slaw ingredients (i only added an extra 2 tablespoons to achieve this) I let it sit for 3 hours before serving and it had oozed heeps of liquid - it was swimming in it!! A good idea, but I will keep searching for the perfect recipe for me and my families taste buds.

It's a good cole slaw, but I like the ramen noodle/almonds/sesame seeds kind of coleslaw better.

Excellent flavor and textures.  I had to use apple cider vinegar as it was all I had on hand.  I used the pineapple juice from a can of pineapple chunks (reserved the chunks for a school snack).   One tablespoon isn't enough to make the coleslaw taste "pineappley".   

If you like a more creamier coleslaw, add another tablespoon or 2 of mayo.  If you prefer your slaw to be zippier, add a little more vinegar.

I LOVE this idea but I did a few modifications and I'm not sure it's even the same recipe anymore.  I kept the ratio of cabbage, carrot and green apple but to keep the apple from turning brown I put it through the food processor with three cubes of pineapple juice (I freeze things like that in ice cube trays so they are always on hand).  I swapped the white vinegar for cider vinegar and added a few tsp of lemon juice as well.  I did not use honey (though I'm a big fan of raw honey) as I've had trouble in the past with a strange taste when mixing honey and fresh veggies or fruits so I kept the brown sugar and added in 1/2 tsp pure stevia extract (I use this in place of most sugar) and a tablespoon of apple juice concentrate to sweeten some more because it wasn't sweet enough.  I also upped the mayo a bit because it wasn't "creamy" enough for me but I used a low fat type with olive oil for health reasons.  I did add the salt and pepper though I was actually worried about that and finally, I tossed in some raisins (1/2 cup or so) and I couldn't stop eating it! Neither could my youngin!  The apple really helps and the pineapple juice should not be optional.  Next time I will try it with the stated amount of mayo and some silken tofu for extra protein and lower fat.

This coleslaw is really tasty. I sort of blanched the vegetables a while before mixing with the sauce. I substituted apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar and it gave the dish an interesting twist. I left the skin on the apple and sliced it instead of shredding as it allows me to taste the apple. I had no problem using low-fat mayonnaise but I made sure to dissolve the sugar completely in the vinegar before adding other ingredients. This helps to eliminate the lumps of sugar if you mix everything all at once. I did not add the pineapple juice nor the salt as I felt the coleslaw was flavourful enough. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  A different take on coleslaw.  Don't leave out the pineapple juice.  I made it without the first time because I didn't have any on hand.  The second time I put the pineapple juice in and I liked it better with the pineapple juice.  This coleslaw is delicious with or on pulled pork sandwiches. One reviewer said they added pineapple tidbits, may try that next time. Thanks for sharing Yvette.

I made it exactly.  Very good - found dressing a little bland and overly peppery for the tasters' tastes.  Nice that it doesn't have sugar overload or swims in mayo like some coleslaws.  Recipe doesn't make much dressing - if you use even half a cabbage, I think you'll need more (I used 2/3 of a cabbage = 8 cups.).  So next time I will cut back the black pepper, add a nip of cayenne, double the dressing.  P.S. I salt-soaked the cabbage after shredding it - my first time and definitely the way I will do it again to get the right texture and avoid milky-runoff-puddle.

This coleslaw was just ok for us.  We love coleslaw and I've tried many different ones from this site.  Can't figure out what the off taste was for us, unless it was the honey.  Not a big fan of honey.  I did add the pineapple juice to the dressing.  I only made a half batch and we finished it, but will not be making this one again.  Sorry.

I have never liked coleslaw much, but I love this. It is the perfect mix of sweet and tart and slightly creamy. The apple and the pineapple juice are what makes this great. The only change I made was to double the pineapple juice.

It was not wet enough, nor was it creamy enough.  I dare say that it was also not sweet enough.  I am a tough critic when it comes to coleslaw.  I like my very wet, creamy and sweet.  This was none of those.  I almost doubled the sauce and it still was seriously lacking...for me( and my family)

I liked this a lot. I make a lot of coleslaws & pretty much like them all. I make whatever recipe uses what I have on hand, and I had the Granny Smith apple, so tried this one. Really liked the dressing, even though I had no pineapple juice. I did add in some dried cranberries & sunflower seeds, like I do with most salads. I will make it again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe as a side with Barbeque Pork Two Ways (on allrecipes). It was very light and more like a salad, which both my guests and I enjoyed.  The only substitution I made was that I did not peel the apple, I left the skin on. Great for a summer food or light side.

I tried this since it got such great reviews, but I found it to be very bland....but since I don't make cole slaw very much, I wasn't sure what was missing.  There definitely was NOT enough dressing to cover the slaw.

I ended up adding quite a bit of celery salt and cinnamon.  The cinnamon REALLY seems to pull the flavors together...but I'm not sure if it's going to be a crowd-pleaser tonight or not.  I'll report back.

I added a small amount of canned pineapple instead of pineapple juice. I did not have honey on hand but used my gourmet standby: pancake syrup as a substitute. This was good and I'll make it again--possibly adding chopped red pepper for more color.

Fabulous! Always get rave reviews when I serve this and many have asked for the recipe. Of course, I direct them to allrecipes.com. I have tried adding a few raisins and that is good, too.

This is one of my favorite coleslaw recipes! My boyfriend dislikes coleslaw but even he likes this one. I add a tbsp of dijon mustard and use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar when I make it.

I just made this recipe.  I didn't have any pineapple juice, so I subbed  it for orange juice. It's way at the top of my list of the best coleslaw that I've ever had! I can't wait to see how it tastes after it has sat in the fridge for awhile. This one goes into my recipe box for sure!

This recipe was really good, except I altered a bit, for one, instead of regular cabbage I used red cabbage and then I added 1/2 cup raisins to the salad. It was very good!!! A great alternative to pineapple coleslaw!!!

Awesome coleslaw recipe.  I has become my new coleslaw recipe.  The only change I made is I use red cabbage instead of green cabbage.

Very good and sweet slaw.  I have made this several times with a few changes.  Instead of white vinegar I've used apple cider vinegar and it works the same but heightens the sweetness.  I always add purple cabbage, I like the flavor, cripness and sweetness of this type of cabbage.  I also love taste that poppy seed dressing adds to this slaw. It blends the flavors well. I add about 1 tbsp of it.

I had to improvise because of lack of ingredients. I used red cabbage and did not add pineapple. I make this all the time now. I serve grilled pork chops over coleslaw and it complements the meat wonderfully. Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this recipe many times and my husband just loves it every time! The measurements are right on, as we don't particularly like goopy coleslaw. I never liked coleslaw before, but I really like this. We add raisins to make it a little sweeter. Thank you!

We enjoyed this coleslaw with a couple of changes.  I omitted the honey, pineapple juice and brown sugar...and added only one teaspoon monk fruit.  We try to cut down on sugar in recipes...the apples made it sweet enough.

This recipe is a little sweet for my tastes, but I added  1-2 T yellow mustard and a little more salt. It helped to neutralize the super sweetness by just enough. I'm serving it tomorrow with Pulled Pork Sandwiches and am hoping the flavors will balance well!

This was perfect as a side dish to the turkey burgers I made from this site.  It was light and slightly sweet.  You could make more dressing if you are ok with the extra calories and a more creamy consistency.  May not be the most exciting coleslaw recipe in the world but as a refreshing and healthy summer side dish, it fits the bill just fine.

I used half the pepper and it was still pretty strong tasting. I didn't like this recipe as much as other apple coleslaw recipes on this site.

I made it exactly like the recipe to take to a church pot luck and everyone loved it. We had just enough left over to have it the next day so I added some peanuts sprinkled on top and it was even more delicious, so another option. Thanks for a lighter cole slaw which was a nice change from the typical heavier mayonnaise cole slaw.

This was a perfect sweet complement to the spicy Carolina Pulled Pork recipe I also saved. I did add less brown sugar based upon the reviews that said it was really sweet, and I substituted Greek yogurt for the mayonnaise (which I do often in recipes). I would definitely make this again, and next time, I might reduce the honey by half. I want a little sweet to balance the heat, but not too much. Save the sweet for dessert!

When I first made this, I thought it was way too sweet. But after it sat in the frig, it mellowed out some and didn't taste so terribly sweet as it did at first. The apple gives it even more crunch and makes it very fresh tasting. I will cut the pepper in half next time, though.

This recipe was easy to make and gained me compliments from everyone at the table. I was a little concerned when they kept going back for second helpings because I wanted to have some leftovers for lunch. Oh well, next time I'll double up on the recipe.

Turned out great! I hate measuring things, so my amounts may have been off - but I added quite a bit more of the dressing, with a bit more mayo. Overall it was fantastic! I wish I had shredded my cabbage a bit finer; next time I'll correct that!

It was great, except I used 1/2 of a red cabbage and didn't have honey so used maple syrup and agave nectar also added walnuts optional at serving. Delicious!

First of all I will say I modified this a bit.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of shredding cabbage so I used a precut package of broccoli slaw and a bag of shredded carrots; chopping both a bit to more bite size pieces. Like others I added more apple (about 1 1/2 apples total) and I used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo. My hubby is a picky coleslaw eater as the sauce is usually too vinegary or too mayonnaisey. He loved the crunchiness and blend of sour (apples) with a light sauce with a hint of sweet.  It also kept well and didn't become soupy with the broccoli slaw.

A good coleslaw. I appreciated the tip about getting the water out of the cabbage (salt and drain for 30 mins). I ended up adding much more mayo to make it creamy.

Pretty tasty coleslaw. The honey was a bit odd to me but I added more mayo and vinegar to get more sauce and more zip and it reduced the honey taste. I didn't have pineapple juice.

I'm not a big fan of coleslaw but i loved this one. It wasn't to mayonasie and i loved the apples. I didn't add the brown sugar because i'm trying to cut down on sugar and it was still good.

I skipped the pineapple juice (didn't have any), put about half the pepper in and added an extra TB or so of mayo.  After those slight modifications, it came out great - very light and slightly sweet.  I ate mine on BBQ beef sandwiches and it added JUST the right touch.  Delicious!

Sweated the cabbage as suggested, but still ended up pretty watery in no time. All the same, I'll make it again to see if I can do it better; it was tasty nevertheless.

You goota tweak these recipes to your liking.I made some adjustments and it came out excellent! Little less cabbage and carrot, little more apple. Added 1 T of milk, 1 t T of lemon juice, and 3 T of onion. I used 4 T of lowfat mayo and increased the vinegar to 2 T for a little tsing. mmmmm nice change from the usual.
