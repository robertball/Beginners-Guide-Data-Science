Although I've only given this recipe 4 stars, I turned it into a 5 star recipe ( I think) by using kenal corn ( fresh or frozen)  3 Tbls cream cheese, and some green bell pepper and some onion to the mix. Top it off with some shredded cheddar and some diced red bell pepper on top. Very pretty and tasty!  Delicious stuffed into a pita or on a croissant or on a bagel.

A yummy way to dress up scrambled eggs.  I added the onion and I think I would like the green pepper too.

My husband added cheese to his and said it was better that way. I used egg beaters and turkey bacon and it came out find. I will make this again.

It's pretty good. I added the onions and the peppers. I got kind of sick of it though after a few bites, so I added ketchup because I think ketchup is YUMMY with eggs... and it tasted better!
