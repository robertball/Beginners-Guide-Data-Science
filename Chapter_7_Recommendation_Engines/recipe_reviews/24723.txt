To make this a really raw recipe, substitute extra virgin expeller or cold presses coconut oil.  It is heart healthy and much better for your body than vegetable oil.

I made it the first time and it was so good I made it again the next day.  Be careful not to blend too too much (as I did the second day) or it tends to get a little oily. It actually tastes better when you can taste little tiny pieces of the walnut and the raisins (as opposed to overblended).  As a matter of fact, I found I didn't need to coat my hands with oil at all, the walnuts provided enough oil to roll it up. I didn't use any almonds or other coating and I thought they were still so tasty.  Also, good source of omega-3 oils and fiber!

Cutting out sugar/candy entirely this month.  This one was great because it still tasted sweet and was also creamy.  I added some dried blueberries and strawberries to the raisin mixture.  As good as it gets to super healthy "candy".  Oh, and this one does taste better the next day cold from the fridge.
Thanks!

These are delicious. I used butter flavor Pam instead of oil, and I ground the almonds so they would stick better. Wow. They were a hit with my friend and her fourteen year old daughter, too!

DELICIOUS!!! I used peacan halves instead of walnuts because that's what I had and I put 4 stars because I found that the almond slices didn't stick to the balls that well, so maybe use chopped almonds instead of sliced ones. =D

PS: I got 14 balls out of this recipe and I made them about the size of cherries.

Even great without the almonds on the outside--you can use coconut instead or nothing.  This is a really great snack for kids--my daughter thinks it is "candy".  It is really sweet and tastes "bad" for you, but is instead a healthy alternative (moderation, of course!)

My chunks came out big because I used a blender and it kept getting stuck in the blades.  I added syrup & honey with the oil and still no luck.  So it ended up like a gooey trail mix.  But if I ever get a food processor I'll try again!

Wonderful, healthy and versatile snack. I followed this recipe exactly but scaled it down and made it in my coffee grinder! Made just enough of a snack for 1 person (see photo). I found I didn't need the oil at all and the almonds still stuck very well. The added bonus was that I took a few raisins and added them to my remaining ground almonds and made a delicious, sweet almond butter. Yum!

Great easy recipe.  I have put it in my Recipe Box!  Of course, it is not really Raw as the name suggests, but can be made raw by using cold pressed oils and soaking the acidity and bitterness out of the walnuts first.  I can't wait to try this "Really Raw Candy" version.  Thanks!

I love raw treats! I stay away from vegetable oil though and substituted coconut oil for a super healthy treat. I also added 1/4 cup ground cacao nibs, and rolled in unsweetened coconut. So many variations you can do with this basic recipe.

I liked this recipe, but made a couple of changes. I used chopped dates instead of raisins,  used coconut oil and heated the dates and oil slightly to break the dates down. I added the walnuts and coconut, stirred it all together.  place  this mixture into a foil lined baking pan, let it cool for an hour.  It will cut into bars easily.  Or rolled into balls and cooled.  It is so easy to make this your own!

I used a little cooking spray to keep from sticking to my hands and also the second time I made these I used 3/4 cup of raisins and 1/4 cup unsweetented dates.  Yummy!
