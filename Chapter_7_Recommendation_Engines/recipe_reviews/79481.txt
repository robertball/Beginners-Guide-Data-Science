I used crescent rolls and cut the triangles into 3 separate pieces. I tried the phyllo dough but thought it was too difficult to use! I pressed shredded cheddar cheese into the dough. Sprinkled with garlic salt and/or paprika. I tried the pimento stuffed large green olives and I also tried almond stuffed and Jalape√±o stuffed olives too. Very easy and my husband really liked them. He didn't think he would. Thanks!

These are awesome appetizers....and I don't even like green olives. When I had them at a party...the hostess had added cheddar cheese to the recipe. She finely shredded the cheese and sprinkled over dough and lightly pressed it in b4 rolling around olive. It made these little numbers even more delish!!!

I used the samller green olives with pimento and also larger garlic stuffed ones and the smaller ones worked best.  I would probable cut the big ones in half next time.  More pastry around the olive is not better!  These were easy,fun to make and tasty.  Great with cocktails.

These look like pinwheels.  Wrap the pastry strips around the green sides of the olives so that the pimiento is visible. This way, you have a nice red & green hors d'oeuvre
for Christmas.  These are different, with appropriate colors for Christmas. Tasty and interesting.

Everyone loved these, and they were so easy.  For the second batch, I sprinkled garlic salt on the pastry- which added a nice touch.  GREAT recipe!

Delicious and easy.  Taste even better when you press cheddar cheese in the dough before adding the olive.

These were fun!  I made this for my annual Halloween-themed dinner last night and they turned out well.  I pressed a little grated cheddar cheese into the pastry as well, and that made them even better, and kinda looked like creepy crusty skin on the eyeballs :)  The only bad thing was that the pastry stuck a little to my work surface, so as I tried to roll the olives the pastry stretch out a bit, and it ended up being more pastry around the olives than I wanted.  Still turned out great though, and my husband really enjoyed them!

I give this 5 stars for being perfect in itself and the perfect jumping off place for experimenting...next time I will at a little grated cheese pressed into the pastry, or a dab of pesto, or an anchovy rolled up....soooo good!

very easy and friendly to assemble, and nice to present. I had them for Xmas dinner, they were good, the kids liked them better than other more sophisticated recipes... so where is the drawback? only, they were nothing to write home about...

This is so easy and tastes wonderful.  Even people who don't like olives love these.  Try a selection of olives from the olive bar.   It's our favorite holiday appetizer.

I tried this with kalamata olives and grated parmesan cheese into the dough as some others had suggested cheddar.  I also did the melted butter and garlic powder on top.  They taste great, but as others have mentioned the kalamata olives pop out while they cook.  Next time I'll try with a different olive and see if they stay intact.

The olives made it a little salty, but I didn't follow the recipe. I used pillsbury crescent roll dough as another reviewer suggested, so maybe that is why. I also added cheese per another reviewer.

These werent as good as I had hoped, I kept thinking they needed "something".  They  were pretty bland and the olives popped out of most of them.

This was a very easy recipe to make and they looked cute for our Halloween party, but the taste was way over the top salty. I will stick to pickle wraps from now on.

this was a fun and easy snack to make, even for my 4 year old. We used large green olives and kalamata's. Some of the kalamata's popped out of the pastry as it puffed up. Next time I will show my child to mold the dough inward around the olive just a bit to avoid that. Also I baked them a bit too long and the pastry was a little crispy. Otherwise a good snack.

I made these for Christmas Eve today, but I drizzled melted butter over the top and sprinkled with Garlic powder.  Without the butter and garlic, they are sort of plain, but still yummy.   I will make again, will try adding the cheddar cheese.

I give this a four cause I made some exactly as the recipe stated and some with added cheese and of course the cheese ones turned out much better. They just cook better. I stuffed my own jalapeno olives. The spicy was perfect.

These were so cute! taste was pretty good with the cheddar, but still needs something. I think I'll add some finely chopped sundried tomatoes next time. Also, keep the pastry partially frozen when you start to make it easier to cut the strips (just soft enough to unfold). My pastry was 9" wide, so the recipe made 18 sets of eyes (and 10" long strips).

Nice an easy - if you have small kids maybe slice the puff pastry for them since if you don't use a sharp knife you can crimp the edges of the pastry and it won't puff as nicely.

Easy and delish. good one Syd

Easy to make and good finger food for guests. I will do this again, but cut the puff pastery a little wider. I used large black olives so some of them "popped" out of the pastery as they baked.

Made it like the recipe and it was too bready.  I'd like to try it again with a little less wrapping plus something added to the puff pastry to  give it some flavor.

We love olives ... so this recipe looked to be up our alley. Nope - this lacks flavor . Really needs something else in the center such as a crime cheese base or pimento spread BLAND and salty

Tastes good but needs a little more flavor, easy to make though. I think next time I'll brush with garlic butter prior to putting in the oven.

Flavor good for us who like olives.  Many of the olives popped out of the wrapping as the pastry puffed.  Need to have pastry wrap more around the top to hold in olive. This should be added to the instructions.

Had as appetizers before Christmas Dinner...Everyone loved them..I pressed  a little  grated sharp cheddar into the dough and sprinkled  Mrs Dash Herb and Garlic Seasoning on the dough before rolling  the olives. Absolutely delicious...will probably have for New Year's.. DEFINITELY A WINNER

Made these as the recipe describes. SO GOOD, SO EASY!  Will do these again and again, maybe with the addition of some grated cheese. So easy that I simply cut the strips, drained the olives, and then I had hubby roll and bake them. Keeps kids and spouses busy while they hover around me in the kitchen :)

I made half with regular green olives, half with garlic stuffed green olives. The garlic stuffed ones had much more flavor and were preferred. I also pressed cheese into the pastry before rolling as other reviewers suggested. Bland as is, but a great base to play with.

I made these for a 6 year old's birthday party, and the children and adults alike enjoyed them until they were gone!

Added shredded cheddar cheese. Ok; nothing overly special.

World's easiest appetizer.  Everyone at my party loved it.  I used a mix of all different kinds of olives.
